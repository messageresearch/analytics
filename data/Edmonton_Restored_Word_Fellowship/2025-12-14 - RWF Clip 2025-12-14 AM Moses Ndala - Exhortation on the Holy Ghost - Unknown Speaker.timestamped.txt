[0:01] Wonderful.
[0:04] Thank God for that. Thank God for now. I
[0:06] don't know which way to go.
[0:09] Everything has been covered, but we just
[0:12] thank the Lord how God has been leading
[0:14] and God has been
[0:17] to God.
[0:19] There's no
[0:21] nothing as important as Holy Ghost.
[0:27] Without the Holy Ghost,
[0:30] you just church member
[0:34] and one of the categories of those
[0:40] tribulation.
[0:42] Not trying to put the just trying to say
[0:45] that the Holy Ghost is a must.
[0:49] is a must not an option. It's a must
[0:53] must be born again must receive the Holy
[0:57] Ghost.
[0:59] Thank God for that inspiration
[1:02] from really each believer to be not in a
[1:07] doubtful way not try to create fear but
[1:11] just
[1:13] check me Lord
[1:16] am I born again
[1:19] I'm not I desire again
[1:23] there is one thing brother said so
[1:27] We can preach about it but only God can
[1:31] give you the Holy Ghost. No preacher can
[1:35] give you the Holy Ghost. No parent can
[1:37] give you Holy Ghost.
[1:40] God
[1:43] must be desire
[1:50] and God is
[1:54] just the Holy Spirit leading us.
[2:02] Think it was a very wonderful service on
[2:05] Sunday past Sunday morning.
[2:08] Those were not
[2:13] just very
[2:21] wrong side but it's good
[2:26] the power of choice of decision
[2:30] I think it was a prep service
[2:35] you must make a choice you have
[2:38] where you have to make a choice where
[2:41] you have to make a decision.
[2:44] God doesn't just fill you the Holy Ghost
[2:46] without you making
[2:50] then that would be wrong. Okay, I'm a
[2:52] son of God. One day I'll be saved and
[2:55] just la
[2:57] your life. No, that's wrong. That's not
[3:01] the message. So, you have to be serious.
[3:04] Make a decision. You are determined.
[3:08] Do your part. Do your mechanic. God has
[3:11] to do the dynastic
[3:16] part.
[3:18] Be baptized in the water in the name of
[3:20] the Lord Jesus Christ. The remission of
[3:23] your sins and then you be filled with
[3:25] the Holy Ghost. So there's a partition
[3:29] of where you have to be serious. You
[3:32] have to be sincere.
[3:35] And then we went to that Jacob. Jacob
[3:37] was elected before he was even born
[3:40] already. But he had that he had that
[3:45] something
[3:47] you have. It has to be
[3:51] but the preacher can come and try to to
[3:55] wake you up on that area. So you know
[3:57] you a son of God. So this is the part
[4:00] and then because each part each person
[4:02] is different. I was brought in the
[4:04] message
[4:06] not by teaching by life soiet
[4:15] not
[4:25] the message
[4:28] preaching on the ship. I like I tell
[4:31] that story many times
[4:39] the masterpiece
[4:41] a young boy of 10 years what a
[4:43] masterpiece message
[4:46] found that started me but I was desiring
[4:49] that life and then what a masterpiece
[4:54] and my mind over 10 years old
[4:58] I want to be and since then I've always
[5:01] been longing for that life. That's how
[5:04] my makeup is. It's different from
[5:07] others. Another person it is if you
[5:11] don't repent tomorrow you are dead
[5:14] and then he wakes up
[5:17] otherwise if something happens I'm dead
[5:20] and separated from God and that seat get
[5:24] another one was Just a paper and read a
[5:29] paper that's each one is made different
[5:34] but God brings you brother Philip no one
[5:38] talk to me just came to a church let me
[5:40] visit that church I always pass a
[5:43] neighborh
[5:55] just Right.
[5:58] But still my point is is to align with
[6:01] the brother
[6:04] I need the Holy Ghost. I desire the Holy
[6:07] Ghost. I want the Holy Ghost. So Sunday,
[6:12] Friday and brother said this message for
[6:14] the people
[6:21] of children you must be the Holy Ghost.
[6:27] And it is a promise for you.
[6:31] It is a promise for you. God has given
[6:36] people and it's important and it's our
[6:41] burden for us. We want you want
[6:46] to receive
[6:48] and
[6:51] obedience.
[6:53] You need obedience. You can't have the
[6:56] Holy Ghost without obeying the word of
[6:58] God. So you can't be la.
[7:02] No, you have to obey the word of God.
[7:05] You have to be obedient to your stress
[7:08] on that. You have to be obedient to the
[7:11] word of God. You read Lord, I want to
[7:14] align with you might be weak in the
[7:16] flesh, might be struggling, but your
[7:19] desire is I want to. I want I want
[7:28] the Holy Spirit. No, you know, you have
[7:32] to allow the seed that to be expressed
[7:36] fully, not only one time anointing or
[7:40] one time service when you leave the
[7:42] service and then it's a different life.
[7:45] No, it has to be the person of Jesus
[7:48] Christ.
[7:50] Jesus Christ is the anointed, but has to
[7:52] be a person. There has to be a
[7:54] relationship. There has to be a life.
[7:56] Amen. Thank God for how he's bringing
[7:59] all these things. I want to give you one
[8:02] one
[8:06] scripture. Luke 11:30.
[8:18] If he then
[8:23] if he
[8:25] being evil if he then being evil know
[8:29] how to give good gift onto
[8:32] how much more how much more
[8:36] shall your heavenly
[8:38] give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
[8:42] him,
[8:44] how much more
[8:48] can he give the Holy Spirit to them that
[8:51] ask?
[8:53] If you ask him sincerely, sincerely,
[8:57] he will give you the Holy Spirit.
[9:01] If he doesn't give you the Holy Spirit,
[9:05] Father, I have prayed. I have done my
[9:08] part. I've been obedient. I have I've
[9:11] done my I'm asking, father, you promised
[9:15] me you will give me the Holy Spirit. If
[9:18] my natural father can give me good
[9:21] things because I insist. I ask. How much
[9:24] more the Holy Spirit when I realize the
[9:28] importance of how much
[9:33] does it answer the question?
