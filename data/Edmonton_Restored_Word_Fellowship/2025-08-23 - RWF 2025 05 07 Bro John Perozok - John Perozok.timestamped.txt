[23:32] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[23:36] this pilgrim way for the hand of God in
[23:40] all my life I see
[23:44] and the reason of my bliss. Yes. The
[23:47] secret all is this that the comforter

[24:06] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[24:09] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[24:14] in me.
[24:16] Once my heart was full sin. Once I had
[24:20] no peace within, till I heard how Jesus
[24:24] died upon the tree.
[24:27] Then I fell down at his feet. And there
[24:30] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[24:34] abides in me.

[25:03] every care. I'm as happy as a bird and
[25:07] just as free.
[25:10] My spirit has control. Jesus satisfies
[25:14] my soul. Since the comforter abides with
[25:18] me,
[25:20] he abides.
[25:22] He abides.

[25:38] with me.
[25:40] There's no thirsting for the things of
[25:43] the world. They've taken wings. Long ago
[25:47] I gave them up and instantly.
[25:51] All my night was turned to day. All my
[25:54] burdens roll away. Now the comforter
[25:58] abides with me.
[26:01] He abides.

[29:09] will wake to join us for translation in
[29:12] this hour. Gentiles days will soon be
[29:15] over. Glory hallelujah to our God.
[29:20] Whose original life let's stand. The

[30:04] Hallelujah. Amen. The original life. the
[30:08] original seed.
[30:11] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you
[30:13] for your presence that's here, Lord. We
[30:15] thank you for liberty. We thank you for
[30:17] joy. We thank you for what you do for
[30:19] us, oh God. Lord, how you move among us,
[30:22] Lord. Lord, we thank you that you're
[30:25] that original life that's been birthed
[30:26] inside of us, oh God. And you desire to
[30:29] dwell with us and in us, Lord, even to
[30:31] the end of the world. You promised you
[30:32] wouldn't leave us or forsake us, Lord.
[30:35] Lord, we come to you tonight, Lord. We
[30:37] come, Lord, insufficient in ourselves,
[30:39] Lord. You know our humanity. Each one
[30:41] that's come, Lord, myself that's come.
[30:44] Lord, we're insufficient. We're nothing.
[30:45] But when you come, Lord, you make the
[30:48] difference, Lord. It's that life inside
[30:50] of us beyond our flesh, Lord. Lord, we
[30:53] want to see Jesus tonight, oh God. Lord,
[30:55] we come to you now. Forgive us where
[30:57] we've gotten it wrong. Cleanse us, Lord,
[30:58] and take us now in your hands. I pray
[31:00] you'd take this little thought and that
[31:02] you'd anoint it, Lord. You'd speak what
[31:04] would be needed, Lord. We commit our
[31:06] lives to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[31:10] Amen. God bless you all. How many's
[31:13] happy to be in church tonight? Amen.
[31:15] It's good to see each one. Thank you,
[31:16] brother Andrew, brother Peter. Good to
[31:19] the music and the singing. I appreciate
[31:21] it. And um each one that's here in the
[31:24] presence of the Lord. I was scheduled to
[31:25] be here a little while ago and now
[31:27] brother Moses had to travel. Is is he in
[31:29] Africa now? Yeah.
[31:32] Okay.
[31:35] Okay. Well, we'll be praying and may God
[31:38] comfort and may God lead in and all the
[31:40] things. And brother Zigg, I think, is
[31:42] away still, but he'll be back. And
[31:45] but we know that where two or three are
[31:46] gathered, he's he's welcome in our
[31:49] midst. And maybe we would just
[31:55] begin to open in our Bibles
[31:57] if we could turn to the to the book of
[32:01] to the book of Exodus, chapter 33.
[32:10] Take a little thought tonight. I'm just
[32:12] going to call it pressing behind the
[32:13] veil.
[32:15] I appreciated the prayer you prayed.
[32:17] Just was right in line. I didn't hear
[32:19] all of it, but I came out and was
[32:20] listening a little and just it was
[32:22] amazing to see that God God is moving
[32:25] and just in in line pressing behind the
[32:28] veil. Exodus 33:7.
[32:34] And Moses took the tabernacle and
[32:37] pitched it without the camp aar from the
[32:40] camp and called it the tabernacle of the
[32:42] congregation. And it came to pass that
[32:45] everyone which sought the Lord went out
[32:47] unto the tabernacle of the congregation,
[32:49] which was without the camp. And it came
[32:52] to pass when Moses went out unto the
[32:54] tabernacle, that all the people rose up,
[32:56] and stood every man at his tent door,
[32:57] and looked after Moses until he was gone
[33:00] into the tabernacle. And it came to pass
[33:03] as Moses entered into the tabernacle,
[33:05] the cloudy pillar descended, and stood
[33:07] at the door of the tabernacle. And the
[33:09] Lord talked with Moses. And all the
[33:13] people saw the cloudy pillar stand
[33:15] at the tabernacle door. And all the
[33:17] people rose up and worshiped every man
[33:19] in his tent door. And the Lord spake
[33:22] unto Moses face to face as a man
[33:24] speaketh unto his friend. Amen. And he
[33:27] turned again into the camp. But his
[33:29] servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young
[33:31] man, departed now, not out of the
[33:35] tabernacle. Maybe God bless you. You can
[33:38] have your seats and we'll be continue in
[33:40] a moment. pressing behind the veil.
[33:44] We know that man has always desired to
[33:48] see God face to face. There's been
[33:51] something inside of a man that has
[33:53] desired that there's a thirst and and a
[33:56] hunger and something inside that what's
[33:59] the purpose of my life? Why am I here?
[34:01] What is this that I see in the universe?
[34:03] What made the order out of the chaos?
[34:05] And and this burning in my heart, where
[34:08] is God? Is there a God? That's right.
[34:10] Man is there's been atheists, there's
[34:12] been agnostics, there's been faiths of
[34:15] all kind that but but behind it is a
[34:18] thirst to worship and connect with the
[34:20] creator. Behind it is a is a desire to
[34:23] meet God and to know him. Whether
[34:25] they're blinded by their own traditions
[34:27] or their own religion or their own
[34:29] unbelief or not, inside is a desire to
[34:32] see God. Amen.
[34:34] We know that God in every age has hid
[34:37] himself. That's right. He desired to be
[34:40] known by man, but for some reason and
[34:42] for some great purpose, he also is so
[34:45] simple and so humble that he hides
[34:47] behind a veil. He hides in a place that
[34:50] in in the Old Testament, as we read in
[34:53] in Exodus for a moment, and we'll go
[34:54] back to that, he hid in the tabernacle
[34:57] of the congregation. He hid in the Old
[35:00] Testament, they would set up the pillars
[35:01] and the posts around this tabernacle and
[35:04] they would build up the walls and they
[35:06] would cover it off ultimately with a a
[35:09] set of skins and then badger skins that
[35:11] would cover off where the glory of God
[35:14] would rest and dwell. And it was the
[35:17] place that man would go and and and the
[35:19] high priest would go and be the the
[35:21] mediator between God and men in a
[35:25] certain way and he would pave the way.
[35:27] But but ultimately it was that one man
[35:29] that could see God as close as he
[35:31] possibly could face to face. Now Moses
[35:34] was one of those special men.
[35:37] If we look at if we look at Exodus just
[35:39] a little farther,
[35:41] Moses begins to talk to God. He had gone
[35:43] behind and perhaps right in behind the
[35:46] veil. He was in the tabernacle. He had
[35:47] went inside and that that cloudy pillar
[35:50] was was stood at the tabernacle door and
[35:52] and and he went inside and talked to God
[35:55] as God would talk to a friend. And the
[35:57] Lord spake unto Moses, it says face to
[36:00] face as a man speak speaketh unto his
[36:02] friend. And Moses dropping down, Moses
[36:05] said unto the Lord, see thou sayest unto
[36:08] me, bring up this people, and thou hast
[36:10] not let me know whom thou wilt send me.
[36:13] Yet hast thou said, I know thee by name,
[36:15] and thou hast found grace in my sight.
[36:16] Moses says, "You say that you know me my
[36:18] by my name and I found grace in your
[36:20] sight, but but but you haven't told me
[36:22] who you're going to send with me. Now
[36:24] therefore, if I pray thee, if I found
[36:26] grace in thy sight, show me now thy way,
[36:29] that I may know thee, that I might find
[36:31] grace in thy sight, and consider that
[36:33] this nation is thy people." Moses says,
[36:35] "You've sent me out on a purpose." And
[36:37] we've all been sent out on a purpose to
[36:39] follow the Lord, to follow that presence
[36:42] wherever he would lead us to go. Amen.
[36:45] Moses has the same question that we can
[36:47] have often. If you've called me to go, I
[36:50] who's going to go with me? How am I
[36:52] going to be able to go? How do I know
[36:55] that I'm in the right path? How will I
[36:57] know that this is the will of God? How
[36:59] will I know? And God answers, my
[37:02] presence shall go with thee.
[37:05] And I will give thee rest. Moses, this
[37:09] is good for Moses. But he says, "If thy
[37:11] presence go not with me, carry us up not
[37:13] hence." He says, "That's good. And if it
[37:16] isn't going to go, I don't want to go."
[37:19] For wherein shall it be known here that
[37:22] I and thy people have found grace in thy
[37:23] sight? He says, "Is it not that thy
[37:25] presence goeth with us?" Dropping down,
[37:28] and the Lord said unto Moses, I will do
[37:30] this thing that thou hast spoken, for
[37:32] thou hast had found grace in my sight.
[37:36] Moses says, "I beseech you. I if this is
[37:39] true, if this is real, show me thy
[37:42] glory." Amen. Show me. I want to see
[37:45] you. I want to know you. And he said, "I
[37:47] will make all of my goodness pass before
[37:50] thee. I will proclaim the name of the
[37:52] Lord before thee. And will be gracious
[37:55] to whom I will be gracious and show
[37:56] mercy on whom I will show mercy." And
[37:59] God says, "Thou canst not see my face,
[38:02] for no man shall see me and live."
[38:05] Hallelujah. But there is a place beside
[38:07] me, and thou shalt stand on a rock, and
[38:09] it shall come to pass, while my glory
[38:11] passeth by. I'll put thee in a cliff of
[38:14] a rock. I'll cover thee with my hand
[38:17] while I pass by. And I'll take away my
[38:19] hand, and you shall see my back parts,
[38:22] but my face shall not be seen.
[38:25] Now, in the Bible, there's different
[38:27] moments where where where Gideon, for
[38:30] example, would meet an angel of the
[38:31] Lord, and it would set him out on his
[38:33] commission to deliver the children of
[38:35] Israel. And from that interaction, he
[38:37] makes a statement that's striking. He
[38:40] says, "When Gideon perceived that that
[38:42] angel was an angel of the Lord," this is
[38:43] Judges chapter 6. when he when he
[38:46] perceived that he was an angel of the
[38:48] Lord, Gideon says, "Alas, oh Lord God,
[38:50] because I have seen an angel of the Lord
[38:54] face to face."
[38:56] When Jacob wrestled with an angel and
[38:58] wrestled with him to the breaking of
[38:59] dawn, he was wrestling really with
[39:01] himself in a way. He was wrestling with
[39:03] God, but in a way he was dying out to
[39:06] self in that moment. And he was stepping
[39:08] behind the veil of of what was behind
[39:12] him was the old man. And be and and
[39:14] inside that place was going to be
[39:16] Israel. Inside that place was a nature
[39:18] change. As he wrestled with that that
[39:21] that man all night, that angel, that
[39:23] something. And that angel said, "I I let
[39:26] me go." The dawn breakth. And he said,
[39:27] "I I won't let you go.
[39:30] I'm pressing in behind the veil. I I'm
[39:33] pressing through." Amen.
[39:36] Jacob called the name of that place
[39:38] later pineal and he says for I have seen
[39:41] God face to face for my life is
[39:44] preserved
[39:46] God had told Moses my presence shall go
[39:49] with thee and I will give thee rest now
[39:52] that that word presence it literally
[39:55] refers to the front part of a man's head
[39:58] my presence shall go before thee my face
[40:02] will go before thee to be in the
[40:04] presence of God is to dwell in a place
[40:07] where the the face of God is known yet
[40:11] maybe not visible to our own five senses
[40:15] but the presence of God is known the
[40:17] face of God is known but God dwells
[40:20] behind a veil so it's possible to enter
[40:23] behind a veil but maybe not see him in
[40:27] the way we so desire to see him and we
[40:28] will see him one day
[40:31] but to see him
[40:33] now we can stand in the presence of many
[40:35] different kinds of people. If we if we
[40:38] go to a if you go to a some kind of work
[40:40] conference or you go to some kind of
[40:42] event, you can have many different
[40:44] people pass before you and there's
[40:47] different atmospheres,
[40:49] different pre presences. Sometimes
[40:50] someone is is just, Brother Brandon
[40:52] would describe someone with a welcome
[40:54] spirit, a Christian, or sometimes
[40:56] someone's just a positive attitude. They
[40:58] might not be a Christian, but they're
[40:59] welcoming. They're always talking good.
[41:02] Sometimes you have someone that's
[41:03] negative, always talking bad.
[41:07] Sometimes you meet someone and it feels
[41:08] like there's a wrong spirit there.
[41:10] Something's behind the veil. You don't
[41:12] know it. You can't maybe you can even
[41:14] identify it. You might not see the
[41:15] spirit. But behind that veil of flesh is
[41:18] something wrong.
[41:21] But the presence of the Lord is
[41:22] something special.
[41:25] It's something that's holy and pure. It
[41:27] it cuts through everything. It's a
[41:31] revealer. It's something. And it's also
[41:33] when you have the presence of God inside
[41:35] of you and and the other person has the
[41:37] presence of God, it's welcoming. There's
[41:40] a connection. You can go around the
[41:42] world and meet a believer and you know
[41:44] they're a believer. You know that that
[41:47] same truth that's preached here is the
[41:49] same truth in Africa and the same truth
[41:51] in in a Spanish country or or in an
[41:53] Asian country. All around the world, it
[41:55] doesn't matter. That presence.
[41:59] And yet that presence is veiled
[42:02] and and and maybe we don't see God. I
[42:04] I'm so grateful we have that picture,
[42:06] the Hoffman's head of Christ where we
[42:08] can have a a glimpse of what Christ will
[42:10] be and and was and is. But what a day
[42:14] that'll be to see him.
[42:17] Oh, what a day. Amen. Brother Brandham
[42:20] will say that in the presence of God,
[42:21] men recognize themselves to be sinners.
[42:24] We may feel pretty good when we're out
[42:26] in different places. We think of Isaiah.
[42:28] But when he came into the presence,
[42:29] that's right. Said, "Woe is me." Amen.
[42:32] But God came and took a coal off the
[42:34] altar and one of the angels came, one of
[42:35] the seraraphims, touched him, cleansed
[42:38] him. Because God doesn't desire to leave
[42:41] us outside of the veil. God doesn't
[42:45] desire to leave us separated from him.
[42:48] He desires to have fellowship.
[42:52] It's always, brother Brandham, another
[42:53] place in his presence, the message
[42:55] somehow or another. It's always throwed
[42:57] a great effect upon people to come into
[43:00] the presence of God. Oh, I want to know
[43:03] him. I want to know him more. I want to
[43:06] see him. I want to see him where he is
[43:09] today in his word. Now, Brother Brandham
[43:11] would would would preach different
[43:14] messages and he'd begin to lay out four
[43:16] different places where we can see God.
[43:19] The first one he would describe is is
[43:21] nature. He would say that I'll say it my
[43:25] way maybe, but we can see him in the
[43:26] rolling hills and the mountains and the
[43:29] the brook and the rushing river. We can
[43:31] we can see them even in the human body
[43:33] and the creation that that is or the
[43:35] animal bodies. You take one just just
[43:38] the human lungs and the the flow of
[43:40] oxygen in and out and the aoli however
[43:43] all that goes on and this and that that
[43:45] makes up just the lungs that transfers
[43:47] oxygen and carbon dioxide out and allows
[43:50] the body to live and it there's blood
[43:53] oxygen and there's all these different
[43:54] things. I don't understand it all. But
[43:57] just that alone, how could you say it
[44:00] that God wasn't behind it? How could you
[44:03] say it wasn't intelligent design?
[44:07] But in nature, we get a picture of
[44:09] whether it's the ecosystem or the beauty
[44:11] of it or or the stars in the sky in the
[44:13] perfect order that they hold. We can see
[44:16] God. Brother Brandham tells a story of a
[44:19] little boy how he would have desired to
[44:22] see God and he asked his Sunday school
[44:24] teacher, "Is it possible to see God?" He
[44:25] asked his mother and his asked his
[44:27] pastor and they all said, "Oh, I don't
[44:29] know. No, I don't think so. And I don't
[44:31] know what to say."
[44:32] But he was out on the boat with that old
[44:34] man, that old fisherman who was a real
[44:36] Christian.
[44:37] And there was the the rainbow came out
[44:40] and all the the view that was there and
[44:42] that that old man began to cry as he
[44:44] began to see God all around him. And the
[44:46] little boy looked at him and saw him
[44:48] crying and said, "I I old man, I've got
[44:52] a question that my mother couldn't
[44:54] answer and my Sunday school teacher
[44:56] couldn't answer and and the pastor
[44:57] couldn't even answer. But is it possible
[45:00] to see God?
[45:02] And that that that old fisherman hugged
[45:04] him up to himself. He was crying maybe
[45:07] even the more and and said, "Oh, little
[45:09] boy. Oh, it's possible. All I've seen
[45:12] for the last 50 years." Has been God. He
[45:17] had so much God on the inside of him.
[45:20] Brother Brandon would say, "If you can
[45:22] let God come and look through your eyes,
[45:26] you'll see God." Amen. Remember, it
[45:28] takes God on the inside to look through
[45:30] your eyes.
[45:32] Now, another place that we can find God
[45:34] is right in his word. We can see him in
[45:37] the the truths of the Bible, the the
[45:39] history that's laid out, all the types,
[45:41] even the math, every part that you'd
[45:44] begin to look at the word of God. It's
[45:46] perfect. The the mysteries of God. But
[45:50] but God desired to reveal himself in
[45:53] nature. And but that was only so far. He
[45:56] desired to reveal himself in nature. But
[45:58] even in our nature right now, it's in a
[46:00] fallen condition and can only express
[46:02] God so far. If that's all right to say
[46:05] it that way, because right now we see
[46:07] the circle of life and death, and we see
[46:09] the lion eats the lamb, and we see
[46:11] things that aren't quite in order yet.
[46:13] It's still not the perfect full
[46:15] representation of God.
[46:19] Now, and I'll say this carefully, and I
[46:21] I hope this isn't, but the letter, if
[46:23] it's only the letter of the word, the
[46:26] letter kleth, but the spirit gives life.
[46:30] So to only focus just just on the word,
[46:33] and it's all the word, and God is the
[46:35] word. In the beginning was the word. I'm
[46:37] not saying but the letter part, just the
[46:39] tradition of it, just the standards of
[46:41] it. We won't get a full picture of God.
[46:46] Now, the third place that God expressed
[46:49] himself was in his son, Jesus. 2,000
[46:53] years ago, we know that God came down
[46:55] and expressed himself in flesh. Jesus
[46:58] Christ born in a manger, the fullness of
[47:00] the Godhead bodily. And in it, he showed
[47:05] more of his simp simplicity, more of his
[47:07] humility. He showed that he was the the
[47:10] prophet of prophets and yet a man that
[47:12] would stand at Lazarus's grave and cry,
[47:16] weep and and and maybe the whole weight
[47:18] of the situation overwhelming. So I can
[47:21] say tonight if God's in our flesh and we
[47:25] face the situation and cry,
[47:28] it's no different than Jesus Christ.
[47:30] Amen. It's no different than the God
[47:33] that that spirit of God that was in a
[47:35] man in the fullness. And yet human
[47:38] circumstances came and he cried. He was
[47:42] tempted in every measure that we're
[47:44] tempted yet without sin. But he knows
[47:47] what the battle is. He knows what the
[47:49] mind battle is that we face. He knows
[47:51] what it is to maybe not feel certain in
[47:53] a moment or or or to know what what what
[47:56] what what what uncertainty or or
[47:58] discouragement is or or doubt. Not that
[48:01] he doubted, but to feel doubts batter
[48:04] his mind. to feel the the bee of death
[48:08] buzzing around him, to lose his earthly
[48:10] father, not his real father, at a young
[48:12] age. All of these different experiences,
[48:15] he knows, he understands, and it was God
[48:18] expressing himself
[48:20] in a human that was all God because that
[48:24] same man that cried straightened those
[48:26] little shoulders back and said,
[48:28] "Lazarus,
[48:30] come forth."
[48:32] And we can say with God in us tonight,
[48:34] we can speak to our storm. We can speak
[48:37] to our place.
[48:39] Now, the the Jehovah of the Old
[48:42] Testament that that that dwelt in a
[48:44] pillar of fire and that that went down
[48:46] and met Moses in the tabernacle was the
[48:49] same Jesus Christ that was on earth
[48:52] 2,000 years ago. And Jesus Christ is the
[48:55] same yesterday,
[48:57] today, and forever. Amen.
[49:02] Now there's a word brother Brandham used
[49:04] in the message. It was a is a Greek word
[49:06] called enmorphe.
[49:08] And it means that God would come and he
[49:10] would change his mask. Like someone that
[49:12] would act out a drama or a play. They
[49:16] might be the same character three or
[49:17] four times in the same drama.
[49:20] It might be the same person that plays
[49:21] the villain that comes out later and
[49:23] plays a hero and comes out later and
[49:25] sings a song. And it's all the same
[49:27] person. And if you watched them close
[49:29] enough, you could start to tell it's the
[49:31] same height of person or they they sound
[49:33] almost the same or they kind of move the
[49:36] same way even though it's behind a
[49:37] different mask. The characteristics of
[49:39] that person, the nature of that person,
[49:42] I think that's the same guy again. I I
[49:45] think that's the same person.
[49:51] Someone said, a Baptist minister to
[49:53] brother Brown, how can you say that
[49:54] Jesus and God would be the same person?
[49:57] Said, 'Well, it's very easy if you just
[49:59] let your own thinking get away and think
[50:02] the Bible terms of it. They are the
[50:05] self-same being. God is a spirit. Jesus
[50:08] is the body he was veiled in. Like in my
[50:13] home to my wife, I'm her husband. And I
[50:15] have a young daughter Rebecca, I'm her
[50:17] father. And I have a grandson and his
[50:19] name is Paul and I'm his grandfather.
[50:21] I'm husband, father, and grandfather.
[50:23] And my wife has no claims on me as
[50:25] father or grandfather, but she has
[50:27] claims on me alone as husband. And it
[50:30] goes on. Now that Greek word amorphe, he
[50:34] says, he spells it out. He says, if the
[50:36] tape is released, scholars will know
[50:37] what I mean by it. He might he didn't
[50:39] wasn't sure how to pronounce it, but it
[50:41] means that he changed himself.
[50:44] Something that could not be seen and yet
[50:46] it's there. And then it's changed and
[50:48] the eye can catch it
[50:51] like Elijah was at Dothan. He says the
[50:55] servant couldn't see all those angels
[50:57] around.
[51:01] And God just changed not brought the
[51:04] angels down.
[51:06] He changed the seeing of the servant
[51:10] all along in your situation, all along
[51:13] in your life. all along if you could
[51:14] follow your birth. From a child, I I've
[51:18] known you. The God would say, "From your
[51:19] mother's womb, I formed you. I I've
[51:22] called you." And from that moment that
[51:24] little life struck your body and and
[51:26] came in. And even before that, while
[51:28] your mother carried you, there was a
[51:29] guardian angel assigned to you. And an
[51:32] angel that's followed you ever since.
[51:34] And now the Holy Spirit has come and
[51:36] birthed you and made you alive. If we
[51:38] could see the angels around us, if we
[51:41] could see the God inside us, not that
[51:43] God would in that moment bring them
[51:45] there for you to see them. They're
[51:47] there. God's with us. He's in us to the
[51:51] end of the world. Hallelujah. So what
[51:53] I'm trying to say, brother Brandham
[51:54] says, so that what I'm trying to say
[51:57] that God that always was is here.
[52:01] Hallelujah. Amen.
[52:04] Now Jesus in himself in nature it
[52:07] couldn't fully express God. And just the
[52:10] letter of the word just to stay in that
[52:12] book couldn't fully express God. Jesus
[52:15] himself he was the masterpiece of God
[52:18] but but he wanted to express himself
[52:21] more.
[52:22] God could express himself so far in one
[52:25] man. What happens if God would get into
[52:27] a bunch of men and women? What what
[52:30] would happen if if if if they they they
[52:32] they they killed Jesus and out came 12
[52:34] disciples that and then out came 3,000
[52:36] on the day of Pentecost and that problem
[52:39] that they thought they contained with
[52:40] one just multiplied and spread
[52:42] everywhere. These 12 men, I think they
[52:45] would say about the the Ephesian church,
[52:46] this 12 person church, this 12 person
[52:49] church had turned the world upside down
[52:52] in their area. I think if we count
[52:54] tonight, we could turn the world upside
[52:56] down. God inside of us. Amen.
[53:02] Now, the fourth place brother Brandon
[53:04] would preach is God and his people, God
[53:08] inside of us. But I think I can say that
[53:11] the most visible tangible place we can
[53:14] see God, and we know this, we're taught
[53:16] that God dwells behind our veil now, our
[53:18] flesh. So, this is the most the most
[53:21] tangible place you could see God today
[53:23] is to look to your left or your right.
[53:26] That's the place that you can see God,
[53:29] but it's the most difficult place.
[53:32] That's right. To see it,
[53:35] it's the hardest thing to maybe believe
[53:37] in is to see God in yourself or God in
[53:40] your people. I think I can say that it
[53:43] would take the most faith to see that
[53:46] because brother Brandham says if the
[53:48] church only knew its position, the
[53:51] rapture will go
[53:53] when it knows what it is. Yes. To see
[53:56] God in yourself and to know your
[53:58] position and what you what what what you
[54:01] who you are, what you stand for that you
[54:02] can do the greater works makes you
[54:05] invincible. To know your position is
[54:07] rapturing faith. To know your position
[54:10] brings you into a condition where a
[54:13] translation that final part of the
[54:15] rapture will happen. But we're being
[54:17] raptured even right now. Even in this
[54:20] moment, we come in heavenly places.
[54:22] So to see God in yourself,
[54:26] God in your brother and sister. I
[54:28] believe that the message of the hour has
[54:30] come to show us who we are. And we've
[54:34] been seeing it for a long time. We've
[54:37] been in the we've been in the church.
[54:38] We've been under the hearing and
[54:40] listening and and watering and feeding
[54:42] of the word. And we're starting to see
[54:44] it more clearly. We're starting. But
[54:47] have we pressed into to say that's my
[54:50] position? Yes, I can go behind the veil.
[54:55] I can stay behind the veil. He abides.
[54:58] I can live behind the veil. I can dwell
[55:02] in a place of victory. Oh, the battle
[55:04] will come. That's okay. Jesus battle
[55:07] came. Our battle comes. To be behind the
[55:10] veil isn't to be without a battle, but
[55:13] in your soul there's rest. And there's
[55:16] peace.
[55:18] It's it's it's easy. Now, it can be easy
[55:20] to see, I I see God in that that
[55:22] visiting minister or that believer I met
[55:24] from a distance and I only know them
[55:25] this much, so I got to see God in them
[55:27] because I didn't see their humanity too
[55:29] much. Or or or in our brother and but
[55:31] but but is it easy to see God in
[55:33] yourself?
[55:35] Can you see God in in in that person you
[55:38] know so well that if you look at them
[55:41] right, you you'll see God, but if you
[55:43] look at them wrong, you'll see humanity.
[55:46] It's easy to see God in in this person,
[55:48] but that person that's close or or
[55:51] ourself because this stinking flesh
[55:54] disappoints us every day if we're honest
[55:58] with ourselves.
[56:00] We can get all, you know, oh, I'm
[56:01] perfect, but we're not perfect. We're so
[56:04] far from perfect.
[56:08] Here's a quote for you. I love this. All
[56:11] that was in God was poured into Christ.
[56:14] Amen. He says, are you ready? Here it
[56:17] is. It may gag you a little, but listen.
[56:21] All that was in Christ was poured into
[56:23] the church.
[56:27] The works that I do shall you do also.
[56:32] More than this shall you do, for I go to
[56:34] my father. Now, brother Brandham would
[56:36] preach the greater works. Maybe I'll
[56:39] leave that for a moment, but or leave
[56:40] that for now. Brother Brandham in
[56:42] another quote in the message, shalom. He
[56:44] says an interesting quote. He says, "But
[56:46] really, frankly, we have never seen each
[56:49] other."
[56:50] Did you know that we've never seen one
[56:53] another? You hear something speaking out
[56:55] of a body that impersonates whatever
[56:57] it's on the inside.
[56:59] So, when we talk to each other, we're
[57:01] not really talking to the body. It's the
[57:03] spirit inside. But the body is the thing
[57:06] that identifies the spirit on the
[57:09] inside.
[57:11] This body is being quickened to the word
[57:13] of God. We see it in this generation
[57:15] more than ever.
[57:17] Human bodies being, I'll say, quickened
[57:20] to what they're feeding on, we see
[57:22] people covered in tattoos,
[57:25] covered in the way they dress or the way
[57:28] they look. And you can tell often what a
[57:30] person feeds on. It comes out in the way
[57:33] they dress and the way they look.
[57:35] Sometimes not. Sometimes they're just
[57:37] averagelooking and and full of things.
[57:40] But but what comes on the outside even
[57:43] through even in someone's eyes you just
[57:45] might see a hardness or a pain or
[57:47] something. What's but it's a reflection
[57:49] of what's on the inside.
[57:52] Now a Christian I saw even just riding
[57:54] the I ride the train into work and and
[57:56] this morning I saw a girl and she had
[57:59] full dress, long hair it seemed like and
[58:01] and maybe wasn't perfectly messaged when
[58:03] I saw after but there's light shining
[58:05] there. Yeah. And then on the way home,
[58:07] another one walks by, different lady
[58:09] walks by, dress, long hair, and I
[58:12] thought the in this morning, I thought,
[58:13] does that there was someone standing
[58:14] beside her? Do they realize they're
[58:16] seeing light right now?
[58:19] Do they realize that that that woman is
[58:21] not like this woman? that there's light
[58:24] shining here. Whatever light they have,
[58:26] that is that simple, humble person that
[58:29] would put on a full dress and and and
[58:31] wear their hair and and have something
[58:33] real that that that whatever they have
[58:36] of of of God, that's light shining. And
[58:40] the world is so blinded to it. They're
[58:43] so blinded to light shining in plain
[58:45] view.
[58:48] But the way they dress, there's
[58:49] something going on. There's something
[58:51] they've been taught. There's something
[58:53] that would make them do that. And may
[58:55] they have the truth.
[58:57] Brother Brandon would say to be born
[58:59] again is to be birthed from above.
[59:03] Now, we'll take a a a thought for we'll
[59:06] maybe dial in on this thought. In the
[59:08] Old Testament,
[59:11] they had a veil. They had a tabernacle.
[59:14] They had an outer veil that would come
[59:15] and separate that outer court from the
[59:17] inner court. And they had another veil
[59:20] as you entered in from the east going
[59:21] west I believe and and and you would
[59:24] have another veil and it had cherubams
[59:26] on it and and it would drop down and
[59:29] behind that veil only one man could go
[59:31] one time a year for the for for the day
[59:34] of atonement
[59:36] and and that the high priest would be
[59:37] the one that would go in. I wonder if we
[59:39] could turn to Exodus chapter 26.
[59:42] I want to look at this veil pressing
[59:45] behind the veil.
[59:55] Is this okay tonight? Amen. Amen.
[1:00:00] Exodus chapter 26:E 30. This is part of
[1:00:04] the instructions that were given.
[1:00:08] Exodus chapter 26 verse 30. And thou
[1:00:11] shalt rear up the tabernacle according
[1:00:13] to the fashion thereof which was showed
[1:00:15] thee in the mount. And thou shalt make a
[1:00:18] veil of blue and purple and scarlet and
[1:00:21] fine twine linen of cunning work with
[1:00:24] cherubams shall it be made. And thou
[1:00:26] shalt hang it upon four pillars of
[1:00:28] shidamwood overlaid with gold. Their
[1:00:31] hooks shall be of gold and their upon
[1:00:33] the four sockets of gold. And thou shalt
[1:00:35] hang up the veil under the touches, that
[1:00:37] thou mayest bring it in thither within
[1:00:40] the veil of the ark of the testimony. So
[1:00:43] they'll hang up the veil that thou
[1:00:45] mayest bring in thither within the veil.
[1:00:48] Bring in the ark. And the veil shall
[1:00:50] divide unto you between the holy place
[1:00:54] and the most holy. And thou shalt put
[1:00:57] the mercy seat upon the ark of the
[1:00:59] testimony in the most holy place.
[1:01:03] Now, the day of atonement would come
[1:01:06] once a year. The priesthood was chosen
[1:01:09] of a a certain lineage coming from
[1:01:11] Aaron. And the high priest was a special
[1:01:13] one chosen among the priests and was the
[1:01:16] only one that could enter in on that day
[1:01:18] of atonement. He would go in, I believe,
[1:01:20] two times. One time with a sacrifice for
[1:01:23] himself for his own sins. Once he was
[1:01:25] clean and pure, he would come back in
[1:01:27] for the sins of the people. He has
[1:01:30] certain ritual to go through. He had to
[1:01:31] wear certain garments and they had to be
[1:01:34] done in a certain way and and and and it
[1:01:36] was such a a sacred holy place.
[1:01:40] That particular spot and it might have
[1:01:42] been just on a regular piece of ground
[1:01:44] that they moved the tabernacle. The the
[1:01:45] pillar of fire stopped and that was the
[1:01:47] place they set up camp and that
[1:01:49] particular piece of dirt for some reason
[1:01:51] in that moment became holy. Only only
[1:01:54] only one man could go in one time a
[1:01:56] year. Brother Brandon would say, "Now
[1:01:58] notice these holy places when you come
[1:02:00] into the courts. The first was the
[1:02:01] courts, the outer courts. The next was
[1:02:03] the altar where the sacrifices were
[1:02:05] made, the brazen altar. Outside of the
[1:02:07] brazen altar, there was a veil hung that
[1:02:08] went into the holy of holies. And there
[1:02:10] was the mercy seat. And there was the
[1:02:12] cherubams.
[1:02:14] Now the priest, he had to be dressed
[1:02:17] dropping down a certain way, a certain
[1:02:19] garment. Had to have a bell and a
[1:02:21] pomegranate one to one another. And when
[1:02:24] he walked, he had to walk a certain way.
[1:02:26] As he played, he played holy, holy unto
[1:02:28] the Lord. And those bells and
[1:02:30] pomegranates ring together. Why? He was
[1:02:32] approaching God, having the blood of the
[1:02:35] covenant in his hand, going before him,
[1:02:37] bearing the blood, anointed with certain
[1:02:40] perfumes. I I I I need to I want to
[1:02:43] confirm this, so don't don't take this
[1:02:44] I've heard this said. I haven't studied
[1:02:46] it to know for sure, but as I understand
[1:02:49] it, when they would even pick up and
[1:02:51] move the tabernacle, because as soon as
[1:02:53] the pillar of fire moved, they had to
[1:02:54] move. It wasn't that you could just, oh,
[1:02:57] now that the pillar of fire is moved, we
[1:02:59] just start tearing everything down and
[1:03:00] open the veil, move the ark. From what I
[1:03:03] understand, they would have to back in
[1:03:05] and even take down the veil, not looking
[1:03:08] behind, and let it fall on the ark and
[1:03:11] then take it covered. As I as I
[1:03:13] understand it, it was precious. It was
[1:03:15] you couldn't look at it. You couldn't It
[1:03:17] was It was a sacred thing that they had
[1:03:20] to cover and and keep covered.
[1:03:24] He was a He was anointed with certain
[1:03:26] perfumes. His his clothes had to be made
[1:03:28] with Holy Ghost filled hand and
[1:03:30] registered hands to make his clothes.
[1:03:32] The rose of Sharon, the anointing oil
[1:03:34] poured on his head, run down through his
[1:03:36] beard, down over his place with a royal
[1:03:38] perfume. He he he he couldn't just
[1:03:41] approach it any old way. In fact, as I
[1:03:44] understand it as well, they had a rope
[1:03:45] attached to him. Yeah. And and they
[1:03:48] would let him they would let him go in
[1:03:49] and and maybe they were in the outer
[1:03:51] court even, I believe, and and they
[1:03:53] would hold him and he would be attached
[1:03:55] to a rope and those bells would jingle
[1:03:57] as he would walk so that they knew he
[1:03:58] was alive because if he approached it in
[1:04:01] the wrong way and wasn't covered or
[1:04:04] didn't sacrifice in the right way, he
[1:04:06] would die. The bells would stop and they
[1:04:08] would pull him out. It was holy. It was
[1:04:11] death for any wrong person to enter in
[1:04:14] there. It was death for any sinner to
[1:04:17] enter in there. But he would go and
[1:04:19] offer the blood on the mercy seat once a
[1:04:21] year. And he was privileged to see the
[1:04:24] shikina glory, the pillar of fire, the
[1:04:28] amber light that come down.
[1:04:31] Oh, the glory of the Lord, the most holy
[1:04:33] place. How the congregation must have
[1:04:35] envied him. Brother Brandham says, how
[1:04:38] they must have envied him. He was a
[1:04:40] special person.
[1:04:42] But now tonight
[1:04:45] we know that Jesus Christ came. He died.
[1:04:49] That veil of the temple was rent from
[1:04:53] top to bottom. And and we are called God
[1:04:56] came and he he was veiled in human
[1:04:59] flesh. And he came and died to death.
[1:05:02] Amen.
[1:05:04] When that veil was rent, it opened a way
[1:05:07] and and an access that no other man had
[1:05:10] privilege to enter but the high priest
[1:05:12] once a year. It it it entered an access
[1:05:16] for us to go.
[1:05:18] We're kings and priests
[1:05:22] that we can offer spiritual sacrifices
[1:05:24] to God ourselves.
[1:05:27] Each one of us, men and women, young and
[1:05:30] old, each one of us has been given the
[1:05:33] privilege that that one high priest has
[1:05:36] been given. Amen. To come ourselves
[1:05:40] and enter behind the veil,
[1:05:44] that sacred piece of dirt
[1:05:47] that was holy. Now God comes and says, I
[1:05:50] want to take your piece of dirt.
[1:05:53] The Lord's prayer says thy will be done
[1:05:56] in earth as it is in heaven. It's not
[1:05:58] saying on earth. It says in earth in our
[1:06:02] earth in our flesh.
[1:06:05] As we enter the veil, that high priest
[1:06:09] that would enter the veil, I'm sure as
[1:06:11] soon as that that veil dropped, it was
[1:06:13] nearly soundproof. Perhaps it was
[1:06:15] soundproof. and those strong heavy
[1:06:17] curtains that would drop and those four
[1:06:19] layers that were on top of them. The
[1:06:21] world cut off
[1:06:24] the world to a to a dull nothing. I'm
[1:06:27] sure in the outer court that two million
[1:06:29] people surrounding you could hear them.
[1:06:32] But as he entered into the holy place
[1:06:34] and then into the most holy place, it
[1:06:37] was just you and God.
[1:06:40] Oh, you had he had to go back out again
[1:06:41] and face the world. In that moment, he
[1:06:44] could have communion with the king, the
[1:06:47] king of kings. God had come down in a in
[1:06:50] a theophony form in that pillar of fire.
[1:06:53] Amen. I don't know what was said. I
[1:06:55] don't know what was heard. I know Moses
[1:06:57] would talk to God. We don't know what
[1:06:59] the high priest what would happen in
[1:07:00] those moments. It was secret.
[1:07:04] How the world must have envied him.
[1:07:07] Now in our generation, in our time and
[1:07:09] in our our dispensation, those are
[1:07:12] shadows and types for a reality
[1:07:15] and what God has called us as a people
[1:07:19] is to press behind the veil. Amen. To
[1:07:22] enter in in the Garden of Eden when they
[1:07:25] when they sinned and were ushered out
[1:07:26] and told to leave, an angel stood
[1:07:28] guarding the way to the tree of life.
[1:07:31] But when Christ came and died and that
[1:07:34] veil was rent,
[1:07:37] No one had ever seen the the ark. If it
[1:07:40] is how I understand it, no one had seen
[1:07:42] it. They would cover it with the veil
[1:07:44] and it was covered and they would walk
[1:07:45] with it. There there was times where
[1:07:47] Eli's sons ran off with the ark and
[1:07:49] there was different things that had
[1:07:50] happened that were were wrong. But but
[1:07:53] no one was supposed to see it. No one
[1:07:54] was supposed to touch it. No one was
[1:07:56] supposed to to handle it in an improper
[1:07:58] way. It was death.
[1:08:00] But when Jesus Christ came and died the
[1:08:03] perfect sacrifice, paid for our sins, he
[1:08:06] made an access the veil. He was hanging
[1:08:09] on a cross and the veil of the temple
[1:08:11] rent from top to bottom. And the mercy
[1:08:14] seat was in plain view.
[1:08:17] Not behind the veil anymore. But the
[1:08:20] mercy seat was hanging on a cross. God
[1:08:23] had had died the death, tasted death.
[1:08:25] Yes. He couldn't taste him as the spirit
[1:08:28] God, but he came in flesh to taste it
[1:08:30] for you and for me.
[1:08:33] And he comes and he says now it's it's
[1:08:36] not death to enter behind the veil. It's
[1:08:38] death not to.
[1:08:40] God comes and ushers us. God truly isn't
[1:08:44] hanging over us an angry God. No. And
[1:08:47] God, as brother Brandon would say, God
[1:08:49] the Father, how he thought it was was
[1:08:51] God the Father hates me, but Jesus loves
[1:08:53] me. He found that Jesus was the very
[1:08:56] heart of the father. Amen. And God is
[1:08:59] ushering us. Come behind the veil. That
[1:09:02] veil with the cherubams and that that
[1:09:03] that ark that would come and and I would
[1:09:06] dwell between the cherubams and there
[1:09:07] I'll commune with you. I'll I'll talk to
[1:09:10] you from there. God says, I desire a
[1:09:12] bride to come and do that. Come behind
[1:09:15] the veil.
[1:09:17] What was it? Moses. He came and and and
[1:09:19] Moses if he would have when when he came
[1:09:21] and met God with that that burning bush,
[1:09:24] he had to approach him in the right way.
[1:09:26] Amen. He had to come and and and and and
[1:09:29] take his shoes off. Brother Brandham
[1:09:31] says if he would have just taken his hat
[1:09:32] off, that wouldn't have done it in our
[1:09:36] in our time and and in our moment. What
[1:09:40] what God calls for us. And if I could
[1:09:43] say it this way, I trust I'm preaching
[1:09:44] to the choir that we've all come to this
[1:09:46] place.
[1:09:48] But we must be born again. Amen. We have
[1:09:51] to to enter behind the veil in this
[1:09:54] generation in this time is to receive
[1:09:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Not
[1:10:00] just on our flesh in the outer court or
[1:10:02] or or fed by the mana in the outer court
[1:10:04] or or just on our spirit realm in the
[1:10:06] inner court, but we go back out again.
[1:10:08] But what God desires is a total death to
[1:10:12] self. Amen. And then a daily walk with
[1:10:14] him
[1:10:16] to enter behind the veil and be born
[1:10:19] again of the spirit of God in our soul
[1:10:21] and then daily come back. Daily enter in
[1:10:25] behind the veil.
[1:10:27] Brother Brandham says he never meant
[1:10:29] shake hands and join a church. He said
[1:10:31] you must be born again from above. not
[1:10:35] put your name on a book, but be
[1:10:37] regenerated
[1:10:38] and your soul changed, your entire being
[1:10:41] made new again. Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:10:45] in the token, he says when he said you
[1:10:46] must be born again, that don't mean jump
[1:10:49] up and down at the altar, that don't
[1:10:51] mean walk back and forth here and shake
[1:10:53] hands with the pastor. That don't mean
[1:10:55] all this foolishness that we've seen
[1:10:56] done. It means death to your first
[1:11:00] being. Amen. And life to your the second
[1:11:03] being. When that lamb, little lamb died
[1:11:05] or that goat died, it meant life for the
[1:11:08] person. It meant that their sins were
[1:11:10] covered. They were atoned for.
[1:11:14] It means that the blood has been applied
[1:11:16] and you've been identified with the life
[1:11:18] of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:21] What we need today is another baptism of
[1:11:23] the Holy Spirit. Have the real power of
[1:11:26] God that identifies the work that Jesus
[1:11:29] Christ promised for this day. No, not so
[1:11:32] much as what we we don't worry so much
[1:11:34] of what God promised for that day for
[1:11:36] for what? For a previous day, but what
[1:11:38] he's promised for this day. Amen. Is the
[1:11:42] baptism, the Holy Ghost? God himself.
[1:11:46] What is the Holy Ghost? The revelation
[1:11:48] of Jesus Christ personally to you. What
[1:11:50] is the Holy Ghost? God to come and
[1:11:52] tabernacle inside your flesh. Amen.
[1:11:55] God to to to go to a job, to go to
[1:11:59] school, God to ride the train, God to to
[1:12:02] be where where you are and what you do.
[1:12:05] To recognize that God's in you. We were
[1:12:08] at a family gathering just a few weeks
[1:12:10] ago and and my wife's from Saskatchewan
[1:12:13] and we were back home and and and
[1:12:16] I just was these thoughts were working
[1:12:18] through me that God lives in us and God
[1:12:21] just doesn't live in me, God lives in
[1:12:22] you. And I was looking at the family
[1:12:25] were in the kitchen. They wouldn't have
[1:12:26] had a clue that I was. But you're just
[1:12:27] thinking,
[1:12:29] God's behind that skin. If you if you
[1:12:31] can see your brother and look behind his
[1:12:33] eyes and see God, oh, it changes the
[1:12:36] picture. If you if you go home tonight
[1:12:39] and see God in your husband, God in your
[1:12:40] wife, God in your children, God, it
[1:12:43] changes your whole approach.
[1:12:46] that God would not just not just dwell
[1:12:50] in Jesus Christ but pour himself out
[1:12:52] into the church. A many membered body, a
[1:12:56] group of people that have gone behind
[1:12:58] the veil in their own life, stayed
[1:13:01] behind the veil, communed with God. Are
[1:13:04] we perfect people?
[1:13:07] Will we disappoint ourselves? Will we
[1:13:10] disappoint others? Will we contend with
[1:13:13] the veil?
[1:13:14] the flesh every single day. Brother
[1:13:17] Brandham says you can't be live sinless
[1:13:21] perfection in this life.
[1:13:23] It's miserable to try. It won't happen.
[1:13:27] Brother brother, the Bible would say
[1:13:29] this, and maybe we'll go down this vein
[1:13:31] in a moment. Unto the pure, all things
[1:13:33] are pure. What is it to dwell behind the
[1:13:36] veil? If I can take it down that
[1:13:37] channel. To dwell behind the veil. In
[1:13:40] that veil, it was pure. It was peace. It
[1:13:43] was joy. That priest that would dwell
[1:13:45] behind there, there wasn't anything that
[1:13:46] could get to him. He couldn't see
[1:13:48] anything wrong. He couldn't He couldn't
[1:13:50] maybe even think anything wrong in that
[1:13:52] moment. I I don't know. But he was
[1:13:54] behind a veil and all of the things of
[1:13:56] the world were cut off from him.
[1:14:00] In that place, it was pure. It was holy.
[1:14:03] The Bible says, "Unto the pure, all
[1:14:06] things are pure."
[1:14:08] Someone that dwells in in outside of the
[1:14:11] veil and dwells in filth and and all
[1:14:14] kinds of wrong thoughts and actions and
[1:14:16] attitudes, everything they look at and
[1:14:19] perceive and speak on will reflect that.
[1:14:22] A negative person can have a good day,
[1:14:25] but that doesn't mean they're not a
[1:14:26] negative person.
[1:14:29] There's something inside them that needs
[1:14:31] to be changed.
[1:14:32] a a a happy person, someone that's got
[1:14:35] joy can have a bad day, but that doesn't
[1:14:37] take away from the joy that's in them.
[1:14:40] Now, we don't just as Christians, we
[1:14:42] have deep trials,
[1:14:44] deep, difficult, discouraging things,
[1:14:47] and we can feel down in the fact that we
[1:14:49] feel down.
[1:14:51] Forget that. Those are the clouds.
[1:14:54] Our old pastor back home used to say,
[1:14:56] Brother Herald used to say, "The devil
[1:14:57] is deadly with discouragement."
[1:15:00] The devil is deadly with that to drag
[1:15:03] you down and to make you feel, well, I
[1:15:04] am a negative person. No, don't confess
[1:15:06] that. Never confess the negative. Only
[1:15:10] look to what God has made you to be. Let
[1:15:13] that little spark, that little spot
[1:15:15] behind the veil come alive again. That
[1:15:18] little place where God feeds you and you
[1:15:19] know that I'm his and he's mine be
[1:15:22] birthed again. be be not birthed again,
[1:15:24] but but the the in Psalms it says,
[1:15:27] "Restore my soul. Restore unto me the
[1:15:30] joy of thy salvation." And another place
[1:15:32] in the Psalms, "He restoreth your soul.
[1:15:35] He can make you new again. He can make
[1:15:37] you alive again, fresh again."
[1:15:42] when when when when God when when when
[1:15:44] that priest went behind the veil,
[1:15:47] it was it was something that was
[1:15:49] everything of the world was cut off.
[1:15:53] Now, in Adam's time,
[1:15:56] they had a veil of innocence.
[1:15:59] They had a place that they could dwell
[1:16:01] where in that humanity, they they they
[1:16:04] they were naked and didn't even know it.
[1:16:06] Yeah, they lived in in a place where
[1:16:09] where Eden was perfect and and and all
[1:16:12] of the animals were friends and
[1:16:13] everything was just in order.
[1:16:17] What God has call is calling us back to
[1:16:20] is is the same thing.
[1:16:23] God came in in and Christ is the
[1:16:25] mystery. He lays out and I won't take
[1:16:26] too much longer, but a three-fold
[1:16:28] purpose. God w God came down in Christ
[1:16:31] and he wants preeminence in his people
[1:16:33] and he wants to restore us back to Eden
[1:16:37] again.
[1:16:40] I'll go down this channel for a moment.
[1:16:41] I trust it's all right. But brother
[1:16:43] Brandon would would talk about the veil
[1:16:47] of of innocence.
[1:16:49] Compare this now. How much that man and
[1:16:51] his wife both in God God's Eden one
[1:16:54] didn't have a stitch of clothes on them
[1:16:56] and knew it not. Why didn't they know
[1:16:58] it?
[1:17:00] They were veiled to their senses of
[1:17:02] nakedness by the Holy Veil of the Holy
[1:17:06] Spirit. They could look right at each
[1:17:08] other and they didn't know that they
[1:17:10] were naked. They were veiled with the
[1:17:12] Holy Spirit of holiness.
[1:17:15] God's veil yet today, he says, can look
[1:17:19] and not lust. They turn their head
[1:17:23] to live behind the veil. Amen. Unto the
[1:17:27] pure all things are pure. You can look
[1:17:30] not turn your head. In in in that place
[1:17:34] behind the veil
[1:17:37] is where victory is, is where freedom
[1:17:39] is. In the place behind the veil, we're
[1:17:42] being restored back. And today, we're
[1:17:45] not perfect, but we will live in the
[1:17:47] first fruits of what's coming. The first
[1:17:50] fruits of a resurrection are divine
[1:17:52] healing. the first fruits of a
[1:17:54] resurrection, the quickening of our
[1:17:55] bodies, where we're overcoming sin that
[1:17:57] we couldn't overcome before, not of our
[1:17:59] own strength, in the first fruits of it.
[1:18:03] I I believe that we can dwell in a place
[1:18:05] where that veil of as we step behind a
[1:18:07] veil, that veil of innocence drops,
[1:18:09] begins to drop again and all the things
[1:18:12] of the world don't have that same effect
[1:18:15] on us anymore. The lust of the flesh,
[1:18:17] the lust of the eye, the pride of life,
[1:18:20] stay behind the veil. Amen. We can't do
[1:18:23] that on our own self. Of our own
[1:18:26] humanity will fail of our own eyes will
[1:18:29] fail. Of our own mind will fail. But
[1:18:32] that's why to get behind the veil again
[1:18:36] to dwell behind the veil again. Oh, the
[1:18:39] temper's quiet again and the the anress
[1:18:42] is quiet again and the peace raises up
[1:18:44] and and the temptation is quiet again.
[1:18:47] Oh, it'll batter. But inside,
[1:18:52] if I can say tonight, let's press behind
[1:18:55] the veil. It's where victory lies. It's
[1:18:58] where peace lies. It's where joy lies.
[1:19:03] One final veil.
[1:19:05] That veil that separated,
[1:19:08] brother Brandham would say, that veil
[1:19:10] that separated God from the people was a
[1:19:12] veil of tradition.
[1:19:15] the glory
[1:19:17] that that that veil and and we have that
[1:19:20] of our own humanity.
[1:19:22] Sometimes as we grow in God, we the
[1:19:24] first thing we you know the sin drops
[1:19:26] off and all some of the stuff drops off
[1:19:28] and we we we're tempted. We have to
[1:19:29] fight. But but then we start to walk in
[1:19:33] a more holy place. We start to walk in a
[1:19:35] more experienced place and we start to
[1:19:37] walk in a more mature place. And so we
[1:19:40] hope, so we think, so we desire.
[1:19:42] But then we can start to get our own
[1:19:44] little isms,
[1:19:46] our own thoughts on what the word of God
[1:19:48] means, our own bend on, well, I think it
[1:19:52] means this or I believe that this is it.
[1:19:55] Oh, I w the pastor ought to our own
[1:19:58] bend. I never truly t come and enter
[1:20:02] behind the veil
[1:20:04] and look, God, what do what what does it
[1:20:07] say? Sometimes it's as simple as
[1:20:09] studying it out for ourselves to look at
[1:20:12] the table app and and what did what did
[1:20:14] brother Brandham really say?
[1:20:17] The veil and that veil of tradition
[1:20:21] the way we think it is the way we've
[1:20:23] always done it the way that I the way
[1:20:25] that this has been done for so long so
[1:20:28] it must be right. God wants to come and
[1:20:31] have a people in this generation reach
[1:20:36] perfection which is completeness. Not
[1:20:40] perfection in the Bible I think
[1:20:42] typically wouldn't mean sinless
[1:20:43] perfection. It means maturity,
[1:20:46] completeness,
[1:20:47] wholeness.
[1:20:49] Wonder if we could turn to the book of
[1:20:50] Isaiah as we just close down with this.
[1:20:55] This just comes to me now. This is not
[1:20:57] in my notes, but we were just talking
[1:20:59] about this the other night or the maybe
[1:21:01] the other night or morning in Isaiah
[1:21:02] chapter I think 61.
[1:21:06] Maybe this is a place to close
[1:21:10] or somewhere around here. I'm going to
[1:21:12] you might find it before me.
[1:21:16] You remember when Jesus went to the
[1:21:18] temple and he preached the sermon for
[1:21:19] the for the and they they handed him the
[1:21:22] scroll from Isaiah and he read the
[1:21:23] scripture and he got partway through and
[1:21:25] he stopped and he handed it back and
[1:21:27] said, "This day is this scripture
[1:21:28] fulfilled." Let's read a little farther
[1:21:31] because a little farther is what we have
[1:21:34] today.
[1:21:36] Spirit of the Lord is upon me. Verse
[1:21:37] one, because the Lord hath anointed me
[1:21:39] to preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[1:21:41] hath sent me to bind up the
[1:21:43] brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
[1:21:46] the captives. These are beautiful
[1:21:48] things. This is what the preaching of
[1:21:49] the gospel does. Good tidings to the
[1:21:51] meek. Bind up the brokenhearted.
[1:21:53] Proclaim liberty to the captives. The
[1:21:55] opening of the prison to them that are
[1:21:57] bound to proclaim what is it? The year
[1:21:59] of Jubilee, the acceptable year of the
[1:22:02] Lord.
[1:22:04] He stopped.
[1:22:07] Here's where we can continue
[1:22:10] this. It it just keeps getting beautiful
[1:22:12] in this section of scripture. and the
[1:22:15] day of vengeance of our God, to comfort
[1:22:18] all that mourn,
[1:22:21] to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
[1:22:24] to give unto them beauty for ashes,
[1:22:28] the oil of joy for mourning, the garment
[1:22:31] of praise for the spirit of heaviness,
[1:22:34] that they might be called trees of
[1:22:36] righteousness, the planting of the Lord
[1:22:39] that he might be glorified. I'm going to
[1:22:41] keep reading, but I'm going to stop
[1:22:42] there for a moment. What's promised to
[1:22:44] us that are in Zion, the bride? Oh, it's
[1:22:48] promised to to comfort them that mourn,
[1:22:51] to appoint those that are mourning
[1:22:52] within the bride, to give them beauty
[1:22:55] for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,
[1:22:58] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[1:23:00] heaviness. Amen. And then it says in
[1:23:03] verse four, "And they shall build the
[1:23:05] old wastes.
[1:23:07] They shall raise up the former
[1:23:09] desolations and shall repair the waste
[1:23:12] cities and the desolations of many
[1:23:13] generations.
[1:23:17] The message has come. The message is
[1:23:19] sounded. We're we're generations into
[1:23:21] the message that sounded that Brother
[1:23:23] Brandham came and the prophet of this
[1:23:25] day came and brought us. The Holy Spirit
[1:23:27] came through a man and and brought us
[1:23:29] the message. And and what we're dwelling
[1:23:32] in now is we've been given the new
[1:23:35] birth. We've come behind the veil, but
[1:23:38] now the last few generations have come
[1:23:41] behind the veil and are being washed and
[1:23:45] perfected and are growing into maturity.
[1:23:49] What God desires is a people that will
[1:23:52] repair now the former desolations.
[1:23:57] the way that maybe this was the approach
[1:23:59] that was taken previously.
[1:24:02] But as we wash away the traditions, we
[1:24:04] realize actually the more right
[1:24:06] approach. This is the truth, but the
[1:24:07] character to handle the truth.
[1:24:10] This is the right way to to to this is
[1:24:12] the truth. And we it used to be
[1:24:14] legalism. Sometimes we would come and
[1:24:16] this is the way it's got to be. But God
[1:24:19] is taking that away to say, not only is
[1:24:21] this the sword of the word, but this is
[1:24:23] the character to handle the sword where
[1:24:25] we don't cut an an ear off like Peter
[1:24:27] did, but we go to the heart of the
[1:24:29] matter just in the right way
[1:24:32] where we raise our families in the right
[1:24:34] way that wouldn't cause so many hurts.
[1:24:37] There'll be hurts. There'll be things.
[1:24:38] But but we'd raise a family in a way
[1:24:40] that would be pleasing to God. Not just
[1:24:42] the letter, but the spirit, the
[1:24:45] something that will cause that child to
[1:24:47] thirst for God.
[1:24:50] If you're salty, they'll get thirsty.
[1:24:53] To raise up the former ways, the things
[1:24:56] that used to be.
[1:24:59] If we step and stay behind the veil, if
[1:25:02] we press behind the veil, even in our
[1:25:05] own minds, we have complexes.
[1:25:07] We have memories. We have failures. We
[1:25:10] have things that drag us down. We'll
[1:25:12] have things that were passed on from
[1:25:14] grandparent to to kid to to to us today.
[1:25:18] If the the sins of the the forefathers
[1:25:20] follow us down to the fourth generation,
[1:25:24] if we're not careful, we'll carry it on.
[1:25:26] But we don't have to.
[1:25:29] were called to break the cycle.
[1:25:32] They'll build up the old wastes. They'll
[1:25:34] raise up the former desolations. They'll
[1:25:37] repair the waste cities and the
[1:25:40] desolations of many generations in this
[1:25:43] generation.
[1:25:45] We're called to be reach maturity.
[1:25:49] God didn't come to to marry an immature
[1:25:51] bride, but he's coming to marry
[1:25:54] Christians that are full of the Holy
[1:25:57] Ghost. but not just full of the Holy
[1:25:58] Ghost, adopted,
[1:26:01] matured, complete
[1:26:04] ones that we're not perfect. We're not
[1:26:06] sinless perfection, but we know the ways
[1:26:10] of God like that one that would come and
[1:26:12] we'd see that actor cross the stage one
[1:26:14] time and cross the stage another time.
[1:26:17] When our time comes to cross the stage,
[1:26:20] any viewer could say, "I I see God.
[1:26:23] That's the way God moved before and
[1:26:25] that's the way God acted before. That's
[1:26:27] the nature of God before. They're behind
[1:26:30] a veil I didn't expect. They're they're
[1:26:32] behind a woman veil and a and a man veil
[1:26:34] and a child veil. But I see God. Oh, we
[1:26:39] want to see him. Oh, I want to see him
[1:26:41] tonight. I want to see him in me.
[1:26:44] Break down the wall of education.
[1:26:46] Brother Brandon would say the
[1:26:47] denominational veil of tradition. those
[1:26:50] veils that's hiding him from you. Break
[1:26:52] down the veils of pride. He says to the
[1:26:55] women, "You're king's daughters. Act
[1:26:56] like it. Live like it. Break every veil.
[1:27:00] For we've crossed the Riven veil." He
[1:27:02] says, "We're on the other side." And
[1:27:04] you'll see, if you'll just do it, break
[1:27:06] those old traditions and things and come
[1:27:09] to him. You'll see him standing, the
[1:27:11] mighty conqueror, the word of promise
[1:27:14] for this age made manifest. You'll see
[1:27:17] him, the mighty God unveiled. see him
[1:27:19] right among us, the mighty God,
[1:27:23] unconquered by traditions.
[1:27:26] Oh, may we see him tonight. If brother
[1:27:28] Peter, if you'd come. Maybe brother
[1:27:30] Andrew, if you'd come.
[1:27:33] Oh, brother, sister, are you catching
[1:27:35] it? He says, "Look, don't you see it?
[1:27:36] It's been veiled through these ages
[1:27:39] according to what God said, and it will
[1:27:41] be opened in these last days." Those
[1:27:43] seven seals would be broke. The full
[1:27:45] thing come into view of the people.
[1:27:47] Amen. That's what took place all along.
[1:27:53] Christ in us, the hope of glory. Christ
[1:27:57] in us, the hope of glory.
[1:28:01] Maybe turn your eyes upon Jesus. I'm not
[1:28:04] sure the key, but
[1:28:07] oh, turn your eyes
[1:28:11] upon Jesus.
[1:28:16] Look full
[1:28:18] in his wonderful
[1:28:21] face.
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:24] And the things
[1:28:27] of earth
[1:28:29] will grow strangely
[1:28:32] dim
[1:28:33] in the light
[1:28:36] of his glory
[1:28:38] and grace.
[1:28:42] Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:50] Look for in his wonderful
[1:28:55] face.
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:59] And the things of earth will grow
[1:29:04] strangeely
[1:29:06] dim
[1:29:07] in the light of his glory
[1:29:12] and grace.
[1:29:15] One last thought as brother Brandham
[1:29:17] would talk about seeing God in nature
[1:29:20] and he was running around a tree.
[1:29:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. and
[1:29:25] he heard a little squirrel chattering
[1:29:27] and he didn't understand why that
[1:29:29] squirrel was disturbing him from the
[1:29:30] presence of God and but he realized God
[1:29:33] must be in this somehow and and
[1:29:35] eventually he realized that little
[1:29:37] squirrel wasn't focused on him. He was
[1:29:38] focused on an eagle that was over there.
[1:29:41] And so he began to focus on the eagle
[1:29:43] and admire the eagle. And but he had a
[1:29:45] gun with him. And he he just couldn't
[1:29:47] understand why that eagle was still
[1:29:48] there. And he began to speak to the
[1:29:50] eagle even and say, you know, I could
[1:29:53] shoot you right now. I could
[1:29:56] Why are you so not afraid of me?
[1:29:59] And why are we why ought we not to be so
[1:30:02] afraid of our circumstances?
[1:30:06] What makes you so brave? I began to
[1:30:07] notice then he kept feeling those wings.
[1:30:11] You know how they move their feathers
[1:30:12] back and forth, pull their wings. I
[1:30:14] thought, "Ah, I see. God gave you two
[1:30:17] wings." And you know good and well that
[1:30:20] you could take them two big wings and
[1:30:22] get in them timber before I could even
[1:30:24] reach that rifle.
[1:30:26] God gave him them wings and he knowed
[1:30:29] what them wings could do for them. He
[1:30:32] says, "How much different is it with the
[1:30:33] human beings? God gave us the Holy Ghost
[1:30:37] and we still don't know what it'll do
[1:30:39] for us. He says that's right. It's
[1:30:42] unlimited
[1:30:43] what he'll do.
[1:30:46] Whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:30:48] pray, believe you get it and you shall
[1:30:50] have it. That eagle could trust his
[1:30:53] God-given wings. You know why? I think a
[1:30:56] lot of times that eagle had tried it
[1:30:58] out. He knowed what he was talking
[1:31:00] about. He says, this is an amazing
[1:31:02] quote. He says, "And we got the Holy
[1:31:04] Ghost and haven't tried it out."
[1:31:08] Oh, press through the veil. See what's
[1:31:11] available to us. Try it out. Taste and
[1:31:14] see that the Lord is good. If we'd just
[1:31:17] let nature work in us like the animal
[1:31:20] does. He knows what to take hold of and
[1:31:22] what not. Set your wings. When that
[1:31:25] little squirrel is chattering, that
[1:31:27] little devil, don't even look at him.
[1:31:30] Look to Jesus. Fly away. You've got two
[1:31:34] big wings. Why would you let a little
[1:31:36] squirrel bother you? Why would you let a
[1:31:38] little trouble bother you? Fly away. Fly
[1:31:41] away. Do you know that song? Set your
[1:31:44] wings.
[1:31:46] There are two roads. maybe is just as
[1:31:47] we'd
[1:31:52] there there are two roads
[1:31:55] that you may take
[1:31:59] one by side
[1:32:03] and one by faith.
[1:32:07] Take the word of God
[1:32:11] or what you see,
[1:32:15] what you believe
[1:32:18] [Music]
[1:32:20] is what will be.
[1:32:24] So set your wings
[1:32:28] to the wings of faith.
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:33] You can fly
[1:32:37] in a higher place.
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:42] Do not struggle.
[1:32:46] It's by grace.
[1:32:50] Set your ways
[1:32:54] to the winds of faith.
[1:32:58] Oh, what's your need?
[1:33:03] What's your cry?
[1:33:07] What's your mountain?
[1:33:12] Much too high.
[1:33:14] Oh, speak speak the word. Oh, speak the
[1:33:18] word of God. And by and by
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:24] it will move
[1:33:28] for you will fly.
[1:33:32] Set your wings
[1:33:36] to the winds of faith.
[1:33:41] You can fly
[1:33:44] in a higher place.
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:49] Do not struggle.
[1:33:53] It's by grace.
[1:33:57] Set your wings
[1:34:00] to the winds. Watch the eagle.
[1:34:05] Oh, watch the eagle
[1:34:09] in the sky. He doesn't struggle. He does
[1:34:14] not struggle. He does not strike. He
[1:34:18] does not
[1:34:20] the power that makes him rise. For the
[1:34:23] power
[1:34:25] that makes him rise
[1:34:30] is already
[1:34:34] in the sky.
[1:34:37] So set your wings
[1:34:41] to the wings of faith.
[1:34:46] You can fly
[1:34:49] in a higher place.
[1:34:54] Do not struggle.
[1:34:58] It's by grace.
[1:35:02] Set your wings
[1:35:05] to the winds of faith.
[1:35:10] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you
[1:35:12] for your presence, Lord. We thank you
[1:35:14] for coming tonight, Lord. We thank you
[1:35:16] for your word, how it's true, oh God.
[1:35:19] Lord, we just come now and commit all
[1:35:22] that's been said. Lord, you know every
[1:35:24] life, every heart, Lord, every every
[1:35:26] burden, every situation, Lord. Lord, you
[1:35:29] know where everyone would be, Lord. And
[1:35:31] Lord, I pray you'd come and take us
[1:35:33] behind the veil, Lord. Lord, may stay

[1:35:39] lives, Lord. Lord, I pray you'd come and
[1:35:42] Lord, where the the former things need
[1:35:45] to be built back up or may there where
[1:35:47] where the the mourning needs to be
[1:35:49] turned to joy or the the spirit of
[1:35:51] heaven heaviness replaced with a garment
[1:35:53] of praise. Lord, I pray you'd come and
[1:35:55] do that, Lord. Fulfill your word in our
[1:35:57] midst, oh God. Lord, I pray as we'd come
[1:36:01] each one of us behind the veil, even
[1:36:03] tonight, even tomorrow, even in the
[1:36:05] weekend ahead, Lord, in the the daily
[1:36:07] walk. I pray you'd meet with us, oh God.
[1:36:10] Lord, if your presence doesn't go before
[1:36:12] us, we don't want to go. But if your
[1:36:14] presence goes before us, Lord, greater
[1:36:17] is he that's in us, Lord, than he that's
[1:36:20] in the world, Lord. May we see you more
[1:36:22] and more and more, Lord. Lord, bless
[1:36:25] this church, Lord. Bless the the future,
[1:36:27] Lord. Bless Brother Moses, Brother Zigg.

[1:36:32] Lord. You know each part. Lord, you know
[1:36:34] the journey, each step of the way. Lord,
[1:36:37] I pray you'd come, Lord. The footsteps
[1:36:40] of the righteous are ordered of the
[1:36:42] Lord. I pray you'd move. Lord, I pray
[1:36:45] you'd pour your spirit out service after
[1:36:47] service. Lord, on Sunday when brother
[1:36:49] Max comes and Lord, when the different
[1:36:51] brothers would come and preach, move.
[1:36:53] Lord, I pray that you'd be free. Lord, I
[1:36:56] thank you for such a liberty to preach
[1:36:57] here, Lord. Lord, that's a a sign of of
[1:37:00] a people that loves you, oh God. And
[1:37:03] Lord, I pray that you'd be with Brother
[1:37:05] Moses said he'd be away and comfort the
[1:37:08] family, Lord. Be with the ones in
[1:37:10] Africa, be with the ones here, Lord.
[1:37:13] Lord, you have a special comfort, Lord.
[1:37:15] Wrap your arms of love around them. I
[1:37:17] pray that you'd move, Lord. And Lord,
[1:37:20] maybe we don't all see all things, but
[1:37:21] we know that you're in control, Lord.
[1:37:24] Bless Brother Zigg and Sister Anita.
[1:37:25] Lord, I pray you'd just continue to be
[1:37:28] with them and guide them and and and and
[1:37:30] comfort them and be with them, Lord.
[1:37:32] Lord, bless your people one more time,
[1:37:34] Lord, we pray. We commit each part now
[1:37:37] into your hands in Jesus name.
[1:37:41] Oh, set your wings
[1:37:45] to the winds of faith.
