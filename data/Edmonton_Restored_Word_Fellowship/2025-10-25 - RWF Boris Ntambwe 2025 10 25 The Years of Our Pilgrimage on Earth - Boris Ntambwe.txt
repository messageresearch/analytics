Description:
Brother Boris Ntambwe, pastor at Mount Zion Tabernacle in Winnipeg, delivers a sermon titled “The Years of Our Pilgrimage on Earth” at Restored Word Fellowship on October 25, 2025. He shares how life feels like a temporary journey, drawing from Bible stories to encourage listeners facing hardships. Using Jacob’s words to Pharaoh about his 130 years being few and difficult, Brother Boris explains that everyone experiences ups and downs, but these build strength and faith.

He recounts Jacob’s challenging life: born alongside his twin Esau, he tricks his brother out of his birthright and blessing, leading to family conflicts and death threats. Fleeing to his uncle Laban, Jacob works hard for love and faces deceit, salary changes, and jealousy. Returning home, he wrestles with fears, physical injury, and more family tragedies, like his daughter’s assault and his sons’ betrayals.

Brother Boris compares Jacob to other figures like Job, who loses everything yet stays faithful, and Abraham, who makes mistakes but is protected by promises. Brother Boris emphasizes that troubles don’t mean someone lacks belief; instead, they test and refine character, teaching forgiveness, patience, and reliance on higher guidance.

He describes life as a short passage from before birth to after death, trapped in imperfect bodies that bring sickness, anger, and disappointments. Despite this, people overcome by enduring problems without losing hope, knowing trials reveal inner strength and lead to growth.

In conclusion, Brother Boris urges listeners to view their struggles as part of a meaningful path, giving thanks in all situations. By holding on through tough times, like biblical heroes, everyone finds victory and peace, assured of a better end beyond life’s journey.

We invite pastor Boris and pastor Boris it has been our desire to for him to come here and um he's very busy and but he took some time to have fellowship with us. It's one of the rare of the of the rare people pastor Zigz recommended just think about it brother Moses make sure that he comes because he preached for us so well last time he still remembers the title most of the time or all the content. So we are I'm glad that I managed to bring him and you're going to be blessed. If your heart is open and expecting, God is going to bless us and just want to invite him. Let's sing the chorus as we invite the word and pastor Boris. Amen. [Music] Higher ground again. Just bring it in the chorus. Lord, lift me up and let me stand by faithful. God bless you. His favor, a higher than I have found. [Music] at my feet. I am May God bless you. May be seated. Um certainly a great privilege to be here again. And uh uh Pastor Moses has been very perseverant to have me here. I really didn't expect to travel uh this time, but I uh um just thankful to God for the opportunity to be here tonight. Amen. And uh uh to hear what Pastor Zav just said. I'm thinking, what can I do? I'm not a good preacher. If God doesn't come and help us tonight, it's going to be a disaster. Amen. So we are just trusting on the Lord to do something to give us something that to give us strength. Amen. And uh you know it's not easy when it comes to preach. Sometimes you don't know what to talk about. You know there are so many sermons and you don't know what's God want his people to hear at that particular moment. But the Holy Ghost knows and that reason we trust him that he will do what no man can do. Amen. And um so I'm from uh Winnipeg and um the church called Mount Zion Tabernacle. We have a pastor Moses came on our dedication and delivered a very wonderful service. Everybody remember on how to come to church expecting with a big big mug, not a small cup to get as much as you can. I'm hoping that somebody tonight have come with a very big big mug to receive more from the Lord. Amen. Well, God bless you. Um tonight I was just thinking I was struggling with so many things uh when what to preach. I thought maybe I'll give a message a foundation today with a message that will preach tomorrow. But then at the last minute my mind changed uh to bring something just to be of an encouragement um for each and every one of us. And um you know sometimes say I want to bring a message that will make you feel good. Hallelujah. If I can make you feel good tonight, I'll just be thankful to God. Amen. You love that? Amen. Praise be to God. Let us stand. We are going to read the word and we are going to go to Genesis chapter 47. Thank you musician. God bless you. Genesis chapter 47 and uh we are going to go to verse 8 to 9. And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, "How old thou thou?" And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my pilgrimage are 130 years. Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of the pilgrimage. Uh we can go again to Hebrews chapter 11 and we can take verse 13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you once again, oh Lord, for this opportunity we have to come into your house. Lord, as King David said, his heart rejoiced when he was asked to go to the house of the Lord. Father, he was a busy man. He was a king. He had his army, his government, and so many people. He had his wives and different things, Lord. But he said his heart rejoice when he was asked to go to the house of the Lord. Amen. Not when he was in the meetings with his generals, but when he was in the house of the Lord and we believe almighty God to this afternoon. That's how we feel. We are so happy to be in your house. Lord, may you now come and meet with each and everyone because you made a promise and I said if two or three are gathered in your name, you shall be in the midst. And we believe, Father God, right now you are here. May you touch our lives, Lord. Speak to us, Father. I'm not a good preacher. come and minister unto all of us. We want to hear from you, almighty God. My words will never bring life, but yours will bring life. Yours will bring change. Yours will bring happiness, healing, and deliverance. That's why Lord, we need you right now. Come, Lord, and have thy own ways. We commit the whole service in your hands. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, we have prayed. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Um so my message tonight is uh the years of our pilgrimage on earth and uh this message uh I brought it on the Thanksgiving day but I thought maybe uh because we are in thanksgiving it's a a different way of looking at thanksgiving and um uh the Bible says in all things give thanks unto the Lord. Amen. And sometimes we don't look at things the same way. Amen. And um so Jacob here is uh he he has he has called his the days of his life on earth as a pilgrimage. So he view himself as in a temporary uh journey towards a final destination because if you are a pilgrim that mean you came from somewhere you are going somewhere. Amen. So you have a clear place where you came from and a clear destination where you are going. So he knew where he was coming from. He knew where he was going. So Jacob call his earthly life as a pilgrimage. Amen. And I believe that we all of us here we identify ourselves that pilgrimage as pilgrims. So if we are pilgrims, we need to know where did we come from and where are we going and what are we doing here during our pilgrimage. So the destination here of our pilgrimage is not when you have more money or when you build a lot of houses or after you get married you say no now I can relax I'm happy you know that's not the destination amen we are going to talk about the destination today like Abraham God called Abraham uh from the city the land of of the child is and then he called me to go uh to a place and he he left his homeland. He was going to a city uh whose builder and Maker was God himself. And if he didn't know where he was going, but he was just led by God. God had given him a promise. Abraham was called unconditionally. Amen. And that uh covenant has been passed over unto uh Isaac his son. And the same covenant has been passed over also unto his uh Jacob, his grand his grandson. So Jacob knew that as a child of Isaac, as a child of grandchild of Abraham, he was under a covenant. He knew that there was a blessing following him. Amen. So um what I'm saying the message, my life story say all of us are pilgrims and strangers on this earth. We are seeking a city to come whose builder and maker is God. Amen. Amen. Amen. So we don't belong here. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. We are not of this world. As we used to sing, this world is not my hope. Yes, I'm just passing through. Amen. So, we are pilgrims and strangers here on earth. You know, sometime when you are young, you you don't feel it. But sometime when you're getting older, you start feeling that my days are coming closer and closer and closer. So, the reality of destination start becoming real. Amen. And when you are still 18 years old, you don't realize you're a pilgrim. But when you turn 50, 60, 65, 70, you start realizing that I'm I'm going I'm I'm nearing the end of my years on earth. So here, Jacob was here talking about his life. You know, Jacob has gone he has gone through a very rough life. But now he has come before Pharaoh because he was coming as uh uh Joseph called him uh you know he came and Joseph introduced him to Pharaoh and Pharaoh this is my dad. I said oh okay dad how are you doing? How old are you dad? He said I'm 130 years old and he said the days of my pilgrimage are 130 years and he identify his years as few compared to his father and to his grandfather and as evil. Amen. So we are going to look a little bit the life of Jacob to see few things because he's acknowledged that some of the days of his journey have been dark has not been pleasant you know and um this is what I want to focus on tonight so um but when I'm saying the message Israel and the church I'm just laying a foundation here before I'm I get into my message going in a strange land that you know nothing about That's Christianity. Separating from the things of the world because God has called you going to into another land to dwell among people that you know nothing about. To be a pilgrim. Amen. When I think of it, I can just hardly hold myself down. Pilgrim, stranger. You know, sometime people don't realize we are pilgrim and strangers. That's right. We forget that. We think we belong here. We don't belong here. Amen. We are a different people. We are peculiar nation. Hallelujah. So he said old Jacob in dying standing before Pharaoh he said I have been so many years in my pilgrimage. Amen. What was he? He began to come to himself. The little fellow had done so bad. He knew that he was only a pilgrim here. Amen. Amen. So Jack B say he he did so bad. He he start coming to himself. He went back to his life and he looked and he can see so many bad things that have taken place. Yet he was under a covenant. Amen. He knew that he was Abraham's seed and he had an inheritance. He knew that as Abraham's seed, God made a promise to Abraham that thy seed shall possess all the gates of its enemy. Amen. He knew that as Abraham seed, he was bound to victory. Amen. As Abraham seed, he knew that God is going to guide him through this pilgrimage. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. But sometime the way God guide us through this pilgrimage is not the way we think it should we should be guided. He has his own way of doing things my friends. And sometime we misunderstand God because he has his particular way of doing things you know as we go through I I believe God will help us get something here. Amen. So you see, let's look a little bit to into the life of Jacob. Because sometime we read the Bible, I always tell people when you read the Bible, it can just be like a book of different stories. But if you enter into the environment of the life of those Bible characters, then you start seeing great things that you've never seen before. You say, "Wow, it was so deep. I never realized it was like this." And you may think that we're the only one. Then you can start saying, "Oh, Jacob was there, too. This one was there, too. So, I'm not alone here. But they have the victory. So, if the God give them victory, he can also give me victory." Amen. So, you see, Jacob was born with his brother Esau. And as the prophet say was a lazy guy at home and hanging around the mother. And if you compare Jacob to Esau, Esau was more of a hardworking person, you know, a person you could trust. I believe if a young sister would have look for a a man to marry, would say, I'm going to choose Esau. Hardworking man. Nice guy. These are the guys always around his mother. I don't want that guy. Hallelujah. So when it come to choosing, you would have chosen Esau instead of choosing Jacob. Amen. So and and and as uh as the father uh Isaac was getting closer and closer, he has lost his sight and and he wanted to bless his firstborn, you know, because the firstborn they deserve a blessing now. Uh he he he called Esau. He said, "My son, go and get something. Cook me something that I like and I'm going to bless you because I'm nearing my my death." Now the mother heard the story. Now this is not a different mother. Is this the mother of the two boys? The two boys came from her womb. So Isa was not the child of another woman. It was her own child. Amen. My my question is how come a mother will prefer one of the child and the other one? Hallelujah. Amen. It's very difficult. But I believe that uh uh Rebecca had a revelation. He he had the mind of God. You know sometimes people think man is the boss, man is the head. God cannot speak to a to to my wife to a sister. But you look in the Bible, God has deal with women along all along the Bible. Amen. Even the children of Israel when they were born, it was the mother by the cry of where they were being born, they placed those children positionally in the land of adoption. Hallelujah. So here Rebecca has got the revelation. He knew something different about this child. Even he was a lazy guy, but he knew he loved the birthight so much. Glory to God. And he then the mother is telling Jacob, you know what? I heard your dad. He want to bless your brother. No, I want you to get that blessing. Hallelujah. The mother is teaching the child how to lie. He said, "No, mom, how can I do it? My voice, I don't smell like my brother. My dad will feel it. Just obey my voice. M do everything that I'm asking you to do. And then Jacob went and did everything that the mother asked her to do. And then the mother cooked the meal. And then the mother prepared everything to deceive the father. Hallelujah. He took some clothes of Jacob of Esau. He said, "You put his clothes so you can smell like Jacob, like Esau." And then he comes to the father and the father say I smell Esau. I feel Esau but the voice is Jacob. Are you truly my son Esau? Say yes dad I'm truly Esau. Hallelujah. Amen. And the father pronounced the blessings. As he was just done pronouncing the blessing and Jacob had just left, here comes Esau. Who is this? It's Esso. Esau. But Jacob was right here. I prayed for him. I gave him the blessings. I said, "Father, this how come it's me, Esau." I said, "I'm sorry." I said, "Don't you have any other blessing? You only have one blessing, Dad?" I said, "I'm sorry." I said, "Give me one some blessing." When he start praying, he said, "You shall be the servant of thy brother." Hallelujah. Now, Is he said to himself, I said, "Well, my our father is going to die soon and when he after he dies, I'm going to kill Jacob." And the news came to the ears of Rebecca and Rebecca again say my son your brother wants to kill you. Now you can imagine the dynamics of a family. It was not a peaceful family. The brothers were not talking to each other the way it should be. There were anger, hatred and death threat. This is the environment of a family of a person that was blessed. Are you there with me? Amen. Because you think when you are blessed, your family cannot be in such environment. Are you there with me? Let's move on. So now that the environment, what happened? He said, "No, you got to go to my brother Liban and stay there until the anger of your brother comes down. Then you will come back." Then he came to uh Isaac and Isaac blessed him. He say, of course, they were also unhappy because Isa married outside uh uh uh Israel. So yeah, outside the land that the people that God told him to marry, they he went to marry uh stranger women's and and uh Rebecca was not happy. She was very concerned. See, my first son, he's going to marry uh those Jezebel out there. I don't want her. I don't want him to marry this this Jezebel. She should come back here. There's a lot of nice girls in our community, in our in our land. God has allowed us to marry within ourselves. How can how come he can go outside but he told the Isaac told Joseph uh Jacob you go to your mother's brother and marry somebody from there one of us. Amen. Amen. So he left and he went with uh that death threat. So he was not at peace. He had the birthight because when Jacob Esau came to the father said father uh Jacob he took away my birthight now he's taking away my blessings this is too much I cannot stand that he has taken everything so he left so he had all the blessings he left and he went to Laban's house he got there he say oh I fell in love with Rachel Hallelujah Amen. Maybe when the first time he came. Oh, hello. Who are you? I am Jacob, the son of Rebecca. Oh, my nephew. Welcome home. This is your place. Come and stay on. And then he fell in love with the cousin. Yeah, I love Rachel. And then he said, "Oh, you have to work seven years before you get Rachel." He worked seven years. They gave him Leah. Another problem. You told me you're going to give me Rachel. How can you a problem with a father-in-law? No, no, no. Calm down. Work another seven years, then I'll give you Rachel. He worked another seven years, then they gave him Rachel. Not only that, but Laban noticed that everything that Jacob touched was blessed and uh he was becoming getting rich and getting rich and problem started arising and children of Laban started getting jealous and lean uh countness just changing and he found that my place is no longer here. There's the relationship with my in-laws it just not the best right now. I I can't continue like this. it can't continue like this. And then he told his wife, he said, "You see, your dad has changed my income 10 times." When it was 10% or 20% of of $1,000, it was easy to pay. But when it becomes a 20% of 1 million, it becoming a problem now to they start thinking, "No, that's too much money. We have to change the formula. We have to reduce the salary." So many negotiations start happening there and Jacob say he has changed my salary 10 times problems after problems. So it was not peaceful relationship it tension and problems you know all kind of problems. So, and then the Lord spoke to me say go back to your father's house to my father's house. There is Esau. What am I going to do now? I got to leave anyway. He took everything. He left. And Lebanon heard that Jacob fled and he went after him and he was he he was being pursued by his father-in-law and he was going to also face uh Esau. So he was between two fires but God interveneed and spoke to Laban and he said be careful when you meet Jacob don't you try to do evil unto him. So if it was not God intervention, Laban would have cursed Jacob and did everything. So he say I have the right to curse you. It was not God who appeared unto me. Hallelujah. So this is Jacob. Now he finished with his father-in-law and the victory there. But it was very peaceful life. Now he was going to face Esau. My friend, I'm telling you, you know, it was a very You read the Bible, you see what the Bible says. He took this family. He separate everybody because he didn't want everybody to be killed at the same time. He put this wife over there. You go over there. This one go over there. He scattered everybody over the place. So that if they got this one here, this other one could be saved. If they got this one there, this one could be saved. It was a very challenging time. A lot of if you can call mental health and depression, whatever you can call, he was going through because of terminology. We did not have it in those days. Science has created them in these days. About 50 years ago, there was no psychological abuse or mental health. All these things did not exist. But science has created it these days. And unfortunately, believers also are using the language of science. But God has given us victory. Amen. Hallelujah. But preach the message, let off the pressure. Glory to God. We have a way of escape. Amen. So what happened here now? He found himself alone. This is the man who was working hard and he made money. He he had so many camels and cattle and different things. Now he was going to face Esau. He said, "Oh God, do something for me." Then he went to pray. And when he was praying, an angel appeared unto him. And then he fought with the angel. He fought with the angel all night. And he told the angel, "You cannot leave me until you bless me." You cannot leave me until you bless me. He was a strong man. And then the Bible said the angel touched his hip and his hip be was dislocated and and then he he he start limping his whole life. No, this is the man was strong who was going to go and maybe meet Isa. But a limping E is Jacob coming he was not weak but it was when he was weak that he was strong because the prophet said God said to to Jacob your name has changed you are no longer Jacob you are now be going to be called Israel a prince with God and Bam said Jacob had power with God. So this man was powerful with God, but he was a leaping man, a weak person yet powerful. You know what I'm saying? The message Israel and the church. Oh, and watch it touches tithe. And Jacob walked different. Amen. I hope that goes way down home. When you wrestle with God, you walk different after that. Amen. On the other side of the brook, the little river, he was a strong great man. backslid and tough away from God, running from his brother, running from God, stout and sturdy. On the other side of the brook, a leaping prince that a prince before God, for you have power with God as a prince. So Jacob had power with God. Now he went to face his brother in weakness. Without any strength. Hallelujah. Amen. You know, sometimes God want to teach us some stuff here. When you want to face problem with your own strength, you're going to be defeated. You got to get to the point where your strength is gone. You say, "Lord, if you don't help me here, I cannot make it." And when we are weak, then we are strong because his strength is made perfect through our weaknesses. Hallelujah. God cannot fight for you when you are strong. If you can take the things in your own hands, God cannot help you. But he wants somebody who can say Lord I can't do nothing. Lord I need you. Somebody who can completely depend on him and then he can come and help you. Glory to God. So here Jacob now he has overcome this situation with the death death threat. Now he stayed there dealing with his dislocated hip and so many problems that he couldn't resolve himself. So he stayed in the land of Sakov. And um the Bible says that in Genesis chapter 33:17 that when he stayed there but he went to stay now in the land of uh people of Sashm. This was a prince with God. This was a man who has power with God. He had the birthight. He had the blessings. He had met with God. Hallelujah. Because we're going to talk about it because there's a a two there was a a little bit of a shift between the two lives, but I I'll get back to that later on. Now, you would have said his family should be the most prosperous family. He has only one daughter. And this daughter said, "Oh, there's a birthday party in the city. I'm going to knock out the doors of my there are different girls in the city. let me go. And then I went out in the city to to visit the girls of the city. And there if I will use terminology that we use today, his only daughter was sexually assaulted and raped. Yeah. Can you imagine what Jacob felt in his heart? Amen. to have his daughter as sexually assaulted, raped and destroyed. You can see the anger of the brothers who did this and circumcised. We're going to show them. It was a big issue in the family. So, it was not a peaceful life, but it was a blessed man. Amen. Hallelujah. With the blessing of God. Now, what happened? this guy, this man the land of sision they said no you know what we are so sorry you are good people we want to live with you what we are going to marry the girl we're going to give the diary tell us whatever we need to do we are going to do it I said no you are uncircumcised we cannot marry with you I said if that the condition we are going to get all the male circumcised and they get all the male circumcised after they get all the male circumcised. The third day when the male were weak, the boys, they went to kill all the men. Jacob, oh my kid, why did you do this? Their neighbors here, they went to kill me. They call the people around to come and kill me. Got all your stuff. Got all your stuff. We got to leave this place. We got to leave this place. We need to flee. We cannot stay here. Yes. Hallelujah. Amen. You see what he has been going through different things in his life after that he continue on he went then the kids when he went to the land of his father and then they needed some food and then people at home hatred started happening too between his children Joseph and his brother. Hate problems. problems, problems, no misunderstanding. Hallelujah. Anger and hatred until one day the children they took their brother. They sold him into slavery. And they came to their father. They lied unto him. Dad, we are so sorry. Look, Joseph has been killed by wild animals. And they saw the father crying. The Bible said he he mourned Joseph like nobody before. They saw the father brokenhearted. He he tore down his clothes. He took ashes all over his bodies. Oh, Joseph. Joseph, my son. And we're all looking at their dad. They knew it was a lie, but they kept it secret. They broke the heart of their father. He was very he he he believed the lie that Joseph was dead. It did not stop there. And when they come, daddy, daddy, you know, Reuben, our first the first born slept with one of your concubines. What? My son, my firstborn, he slept with one of my concubines. E, can you imagine all the disappointment around? Oh my. Hallelujah. And then he get to the point where the mother died and then after the death of Isaac, now he uh someday they told him, "Daddy, we went to Egypt. Joseph is alive. He want us to bring Benjamin." I said no way. I lost Rachel. I lost Joseph. You want me to give you Benjamin? Is when they left of I cannot do and they didn't know what to do. And they kept him there. Finally they convinced the father to come. And when he came he's the man who is coming before Joseph before Pharaoh. He said Pharaoh my pilgrimage has been over 130 years. My days were evil. Hallelujah. Amen. But it was a man who has the double portion, who has the blessing, the birthight, who for the angels, but look at his life. Look at his family. If he was in the church today, you'll say he's not a he's not a believer. If Job was in the church today, he lost 10 children in one day. In one day, one messenger came, he did not finish. The other one comes, he has not finished. Another one comes, he has not finished. Another one comes. You would have collapsed. Hallelujah. Amen. But if he was in the church, you say he's a secret sinner. No, no, no, no, no. You cannot suffer like this, brother. You must have done something. Tell us the truth. Hallelujah. So there's a way we perceive this work which is not right. Amen. There's a way we have a judgment that is not right. God has his way of doing things. Amen. You don't know what happened when he was dealing with with Jacob. Maybe he was teaching him uh forgiveness. Maybe was teaching him temperance. Maybe love. And maybe you don't know what was happening at that particular moment. You can see somebody they are blessed like God told Satan, Satan, where you coming from? Oh, I came from the earth. was just wandering around and looking around and oh did you know this job my servant oh yeah I saw him he loves you you blessed him you gave him everything and you know that's why he loves you he said no go and take everything except his life and the devil went he took everything he came back you see he did not deny me oh because he has his health everything okay go and take even his health he fell sick his wife said why don't you curse God and die. Hallelujah. If you see Job get to the point of cursing the day of his birth, that mean the trials. It was just unbearable. Hallelujah. But yet it was God who triggered that. It was not him. Hallelujah. So God can come and say, "Hey, Satan, have you been on earth? Did you see my my daughter there in Edmonton or maybe in Calgary or somewhere also God you bless her or you can go and try to shake a little bit his marriage. Try to shake a little bit his family. Try to shake a little bit this thing and it has shook something there. You see her husband left her. Now what you going to do? Oh you see she's still serving me. She still loves me. She still goes to church. She's there every Wednesday, every Friday, every Sunday, and she's happy in the Lord anyway. No matter what comes my way, I should still serve the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. There's a way we look at the overcomers different than the way God looks at the overcomers. To be an overcomer is to keep life in the midst of problem. Amen. Amen. God a promise that shall is going to take away problems but you keeping life in the problems is what make you an overcomer. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Now he said Pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are 130 years. Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of life, oh my fathers, in the days of the pilgrimage. Satan has come maybe try to torment your family, your daughter, your son, just to see how you're going to hold. Hallelujah. You can look back and say, I'm not the only one. Jacob was there. Amen. Job was there. Yeah, I'm identify with the same family. My problems, they also have the same problems. My issues, they also have the same issues. But Lord, I love you. Anyhow, when he came to brother Brandham, he took his wife. He took his his daughter, you know, and then somebody came to serve him. He went to kill himself. He tried to shoot himself. It didn't work. He tried to hold to h to the h to the power line. It didn't work. Hallelujah. Then he asked him the question, are you still holding on to your religion? He said, no, it's my religion keeping me. Hallelujah. It is him keeping me. It's not me. It is him keeping me. There's nothing that I have done. Hallelujah. You know there there are times the brother has gone through difficult situation even with brother Billy Paul. There came a time he start going out and drinking and smoking you know and he leave and go out and then he come early in the morning when sleeping on his toes dad is sleeping I don't want him to hear that I'm coming back then but when we son yes dad where were you last Right. You want me to tell you where you were? No, Dad. Don't tell me. Hallelujah. And he told him, "You have a choice. You live in my house, you stay with my loss. You don't want, you leave this house." Amen. Amen. That's your prophet. Yeah. That's your prophet. Amen. When you say pastor somebody, oh they son, the children, you don't understand God. Amen. You need to grow. Amen. You don't understand how God works. But that was the prophet. Amen. And Bipo left their house. He went to his auntie until he fell sick. Then he came back when Barbara prayed for him. The Lord healed him and brother took brother Bill Paul and start working with him. Hallelujah. So when you look at the pilgrimage of our life there are different things that God does. Amen. But many time we misunderstand it. But this is what I want to tell you something. What I'm saying here overcoming means he say overcome is keep life in you. H because God come to test you. This is where I want to show you something on my uh on my uh slide here. What? Uh give me the next slide. Do I have a No. Do I have something to move? No, it's okay. Now here. That's okay. Let's go like this. So, we are pilgrims here on earth. Where did we come from and where are we going? Verbam said, "We are out of eternity. Step into a little space here, a little time space here, and step out of time, back into eternity." Amen. We was before there was a world. Yeah. Amen. Then we come into the world and we go out of the world, back into the unknown to us. Now we are going through the unknown to us now. Hallelujah. Amen. So we were in God. Hallelujah. God did not choose you in time. He chose you before time. Hallelujah. God did not choose you because of good works. Because he chose you before even you did any good work. God did not choose you because you're a nice guy. No, he chose you because he chose you before the foundation of the world. He knew that when salvation shall come, you love it. And it is for knowledge. He had chosen you. Hallelujah. So when you come in this pilgrimage, what does it make you come into time? Because you were in eternity. The only thing that come make you to come into time, you need to become in contact with time. And to come in contact time, you were a gene in your father. Your great father, great great-grandfather, you were a gin. And they carried that gene. When the time came for you to be born through the bedding ground of your mother, your natural gene was manifested to carry the attributes of your father. Amen. But that gene comes with the weaknesses of the flesh. That gin will never be perfect. That's right. It carries death in it. It carries sicknesses, weaknesses, jealousies, anger, all kinds of problem. You can tell it's still in this body. Amen. This body is not the image of God. It is the image of animals. Amen. So your pilgrimage on earth, it's this flesh. Amen. And when this pilgrim is pilgrim is over, that mean you are done with this flesh. As long as you are in the time you are living with this flesh here. Hallelujah. So at the end of the pilgrimage that means you are done with the flesh. Amen. It's over with the flesh. It's finished with the flesh. No more jealousy. No more anger, no more sickness, no more death, no more parting again. Hallelujah. So Jacob referring to the pilgrimage, it was here in the time. And how are you manifested in time? How are you manifested in time is through the birth birth of the natural birth because you are a seed at the origin of every birth. There must be a seed. That's right. So in your natural gene, you were born out of a seed through the bedding ground of your mother. But you are also an eternal being with God. Amen. Before the foundation of the world, you are also a gene in God. And that gene also must come into manifestation through the bedding ground of the faith of a mortal. Amen. to bring the image of God, which is not this, but your faith in God's word bringing the manifestation of that image. Amen. That's another sermon. I'm not going to get into it, but I'm just showing you something here. So during this pilgrimage, there's a time that you lived with a record of your deeds. During this pilgrimage, there's a time that you live maybe like the woman at the well. She lived like a prostitute. She had a record of of deeds, a record of of everything that she did. Now there come a time where things have changed. God has taken this record of of deeds and threw it in the sea of forgetfulness. Because you have identified yourself with the lamb. Now your life is the life of the lamb. Now you you are manifesting the attribute of the life of the lamb. Hallelujah. I'm just laying a foundation again here before I move forward. So what happens here? God knew that in time, no matter if you are filled with the Holy Ghost from your head to the toe, as long as you have this flesh, you still have trouble. Amen. That's right. Someone may tell you, but if you have the Holy Ghost, you are fine. If you have the Holy Ghost, that's good. But but say when you have the Holy Ghost then you have more troubles, more fights, more wars to go through. Hallelujah. So you can see that the problem we have on this pilgrimage each year is just the gene of our natural birth. Now let's go to the next slide. So what mom say as you were the gene in your father you was a gene in God. Yes. Hallelujah. One of his attribute to begin with or you'll never be there. You come forth in the bedground of your mother and your fathers didn't know you. You were in his loins. Amen. Hallelujah. So the day of your pilgrimage on earth, you are talking about your natural gene. But beside that natural gene, God has planted in you a seed before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. He knew that when the s o n of life shall shine upon that seed, it's going to blossom into an image of a son of God, into an image of a daughter of God. The sons and daughters of God are not blood and flesh. The sons of God are the are the children of promise. Amen. In other word, to be a child of promise, it's like Isaac. Isaac was a child of promise. Abraham, his body was dead. Sarah, his womb was dead. There was her womb was dead. There was no way they could ever have children. The only thing that took place it was they faith in the promised word produced a child that is called a child of promise. So the child of promise is your faith in the promised word. The manifestation that comes out of it is called the son of promise. It is called a child of God. It is called the bride of Christ. It's not flesh and blood. It is word. Amen. Hallelujah. So here God knowing that to make you an overcomer, you must be in this pilgrimage. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Because the only way God could reveal his attribute as a savior, as a healer, as a joy giver, as a strength giver, you must be in the gene of your father. Amen. You must be in this natural gene in this pilgrimage. That's the only way God can take glory. That's the only way they can be a testimony. That's the only way they can talk about an overcoming. So overcoming is overcoming in this journey. Hallelujah. The jane of this natural birth by faith in God's word. Amen. Glory to God. Are you there with me? Amen. But God knew that no matter what he can do, this body here will always fail you. Always fail you. You will never be perfect in this body. This body must be get away with at the end of the journey. There's either the mystery of the translation or there is the resurrection. Amen. that will change this body to the atoms. That's right. Hallelujah. Because you are born in sin, shaped in iniquity, kept the world speaking lies. You'll have problems until you die. That's right. It comes with cancer. It comes with arthritis. It comes with this high blood pressure, diabetes, all kind of issues. We live with it until we dive in with it. But we know that we shall come. Amen. And pick it up again. Hallelujah. I know at the end of my journey, at the end of my pilgrimage, I have an inheritance. Hallelujah. I'm going to be just like him. Never to die again. Never to suffer again. Amen. This body will be changed in a twinkling of an eye to the atoms taking away everything pertaining to sin. Amen. Amen. Amen. Maybe you don't get it. Let me explain to you. When somebody dies and then they bury that person, their body goes to the grave, his spirit goes back to God and his soul goes into his theophony, takes it into the presence of God. The body stays in the grave and the bodies rot in the grave and become dust. Bam said, "I won't need my dad and my mom to come out. He shall call me and I will answer." Amen. Amen. God will call the test. God will call the atoms that made my body. And they will come back again without an intervention of a woman and a man. That's right. In other word, you'll have a body just like the one Adam had in the beginning. That did not come from sex. Hallelujah. And that body will have nothing of sex in it. So there will be no weaknesses that body. Hallelujah. So you know at the end of the journey, you know, at the end of the pilgrimage, I'll be done with this flesh. Amen. If it's not through death, if Jesus comes tomorrow or today, I know one thing, in the twinkling of a night, this body is going to lose everything pertaining to the birth of sex. It will be translated, changed completely, losing everything pertaining to to death, to sins. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. That's right. Now God because he doesn't want to lose you here. He know that this flesh you be tempted sometimes you hear things you want to hear. People will criticize you. Your affection your self love will be fight. Oh they say things about me. This one say this about me. Oh they don't love me here. Oh this and that. God knew that you go through that. Hallelujah. Says if it was not God protection, God would have lost Abraham. Can you imagine a man who lost? They they say, "Oh, first of all, his servant got problems with Lot." And then he say, "Oh, well, I'm going to Okay, Lot, come here. You You decide we want to take whatever you mean. I'll take Thank you. The second one. Okay. The second one is Sarah, you are so beautiful. When we go to Egypt, they're going to love you there. Please don't tell them you are my wife. Let them have you. but save my life. Tell them you are my sister. Is that the truth? That's the man we call Abraham. And then after that his wife comes um Abraham I don't think that that promised son will come through me. You take my servant here. Okay. It's fine. No problem. And then after they got the child, Abraham, I don't like that woman. Kick them out of here. And God say do what she says. Hey, go. Hallelujah. But that was the child of God. Brother said Abraham lied. Amen. Amen. Abraham left the promised land because of famine, because of problems. He left the word. He left his promised land. He went to Egypt that got into trouble and problems. But but say if it was not the uncondition covenant, God would have lost Abraham. So God knows that when this gene is under pressure, you you may do things that you don't want to do. You may get angry and start saying things that you don't want to say. But because you're a child of God, you always come back. Lord, I'm so sorry. Amen. And God has to protect you. God has to keep you. It said here, next slide, brother. Oh, I'll try. Is this I don't know if it's going to work. Oh, yeah. That's it. No. Yeah. Good. Here. So now to make sure that God doesn't lose you in time because he knows that this flesh is born in sin shape iniquity came to the world speaking lies. It will always what I'm said until you die this flesh will cause problems to you but don't lose hope because you know what it is. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Now God, he puts a covenant to cover time to protect you. That covenant is called the everlasting covenant, the unconditional covenant or the rainbow covenant to protect you in time. Amen. It said the blood of Jesus Christ is called the everlasting covenant. Yes sir. Everlasting covenant. It's an everlasting covenant which mean certain amount of time till time is up. There will never be another one. When time runs out, we won't need no covenant. But until time runs out, we need the covenant. So God need to keep you in time to protect you so you may not be lost. And David could say, "Blessed be the name whom the Lord doesn't impute his iniquity." Amen. When divine commentary came of Abraham, even of Sarah, the Bible says they've never doubted God. Hallelujah. When div commentary came about to David, he say he's a man after my own heart. But I don't know what kind of reputation David live with in the neighborhood. Oh, that he killed a man. He took his wife. Oh, he's very dangerous. Don't stay around him. Don't let your wife hang around that guy. He's very dangerous. But that's a reality. That's how people would think. Yeah. If he was in neighborhood, that's how you would think you would never let his wife be closer to him because you don't know what's going to happen. That's right. Hallelujah. But maybe that reputation that he he grew up or no, he he lived within the neighborhood or maybe people know about him. People knew even we today we know in the Bible that David took somebody's wife. All of us we know that he killed a man. Yeah. Hallelujah. You would think that man cannot go to to heaven but God says a man after my own heart. And actually it was through that woman that the seed of Christ came through. Amen. That's right. Hallelujah. And the Bible says soul after becoming enemy to God, he was still saved. How can you understand that? So there's a way we see the overcomer. That is not the way God sees the overcomer. To overcome is to endure the trial, to endure the test keeping life. And God can tell Satan, did you see? You took his job. He still loves me. His wife left me. Left him. He still loves me. He comes to church. He's serving me. He's an overcomer. Amen. But the world can see you see, oh, you you go to church, you you church, you why why are you separated? But I I didn't want to separate, but things happen. God knows why. He's able to restore it. If he wants to, if he if he should be that way, I still love the Lord anyhow. Amen. Don't stop serving the Lord. Don't quit church. Amen. Amen. Keep on serving God because you God is looking for overcomers those who endure the test and keep life. Amen. And endure the trial until the end because you know at the end of your pilgrimage there is a reward. There is an inheritance. You'll be done with this body. Amen. All jealousy, disappointment. You'll be done with it. Because the spirit that you have now, it's a permissive spirit. God permit you to have a spirit that has the five senses of the spirit. But when you come to your glorified body, you won't need that human spirit anymore. It's a corrupted spirit that causes all the problems that we have. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life. Hallelujah. So God not to lose you. He put this everlasting covenant around you and then he said I'm going to protect you. So you came from eternity. You step into time and you are going into eternity. But before you are in time, God knowing that you live in a gene of weaknesses and many things will happen. He said I have to protect you. He put a covenant. Amen. The everlasting covenant. Aren't you happy? He said, "I cannot lose you." God is determined to save you. He's determined to change things around your life. He's determined to give you happiness and joy. He's determined to see you come through. Hallelujah. You shall come through. You tell the devil, "I shall come through. I shall overcome. I shall come through. No matter what you do, I shall come through." Amen. Because I'm a seed of God. I have just been trapped into this body of flesh that is born in sin and shepherd iniquity. I'm tempted and I see things I don't want to see. I hear things I want to hear. I say things I don't want to say. I feel things I want to feel. But one day I shall overcome. One day a shall be over. Hallelujah. You can turn back and say the days of my pilgrimage. So many disappointment. I've been hated here. People did this to me. This one done that. Hallelujah. I don't know what we went through. But can you identify yourself with one of Bible characters today and say Lord I want to say thank you because the Bible says in everything give thanks to God. And he say many are the affliction of the righteous man but the Lord deliver him of them all. And the Bible says also everything works for the good of them that love the Lord. It is very difficult to see how good that is. You know one one brother came to brother say brother Brandham my wife wants to leave me and Bam said oh say keep on loving her keeping being nice to her. If she is a seed of God, she's going to come back. If she is not a seed of God, she's not going to come back. If you continue to worry about her, the devil wants to destroy your health. So you leave her, forget about her because what the devil is trying to do to destroy your health. Hallelujah. This is God talking to this man through his prophet. how he should handle this case. Now you would imagine that because he came to see brother the problem must be just solved. Amen. But he's still he's telling him if she's a seed of God she'll come back. If she a seed of God she won't come back. But you stop worrying about him about her. If she goes leave her alone because the next thing the devil wants to destroy your health. Amen. So if this man now stays with God, serving the Lord, loving the Lord, it's difficult to say, brother and sister, you don't want to be in that situation. But God is sovereign. He's the one who allow things to happen, you know, and the the only thing the other thing is it doesn't give you it does it doesn't tell you, you know, God doesn't tell you here. He doesn't tell you anything in between there. He say I'm alpha and omega. It doesn't say anything. If God tells you everything that will come in between, you run away. You run away and you ask God, Lord, there's no shortcut that I can just go from alpha to omega by passing time. He said, no, I want you to be in time. Amen. I want you to go through time. Hallelujah. If he would have shown unto Jacob, unto Jacob everything that will come after, he never thought that one day you'll be a limping man. He didn't thought about that. Hallelujah. He never thought one day that this beautiful girl that I had, oh baby, I love you, one day she's going to be sexually assaulted and raped. Hallelujah. Amen. And then Joseph, if God would have told him, Joseph, the sun, the moon will bow down before you, I'll make you big above your brothers. Ah, yeah. But this is the path. They're going to hate you. They throw in a pit. You're being to slold into slavery. You're going to be a slave in Egypt in the house of Portifer and his wife is going to lie against you. You're going to go to jail and after the jail then you'll become what I want you to become. God is there any other path any any any shortcut? You know this is a this is human mind. We want ways to get rich quicker. And when you are traveling, you want to have the road that will take you less time. Nobody wants something that take long and long and longer. Nobody wants that. But God doesn't like shortcuts. He want that his way that we got to follow. Amen. If you try to run away from his way, it's like a GPS, right? When you're driving, you leave the trajectory, it's a recalculating, recalculating. You losing time recalculating and they bring you back again. When it's doing recalculating, you are spending more years recalculating but just stay on the path. God will take you through. Hallelujah. So you see when you are going through this journey here, God has to protect you my brother. You are a seed of God. You are under his protection. Amen. No matter what happens your way, believe that you are a son of God. You are a daughter of God. God will make you go through it and you are going to be an overcomer. Amen. Amen. Amen. It doesn't say anything in between. Nobody chose his father. If people would have chosen their father, I think maybe somebody would say, I want to be the father. I want this millionaire man to be my father. I want this other meant very father. But it was not even in in your choice. You never chose your family. You never chose the way you should be born. So you find yourself as a victim of circumstances that you did not create in your life. Maybe you carry some disease in your family. Maybe diabetes, maybe something. You did not choose it. You got to live with it. But God want to let you know that no matter what you have in this flesh, if you are a daughter of God during this pilgrimage, at the end there shall be an inheritance. There shall be an inheritance. We shall overcome. Yes, sir. We are born to victory. Not because we are powerful, because God chose us before the foundation of the world to be overcomers in this age. Amen. We are not scared of the end times. The Bible say in the evening time there shall be in the last days there shall be perilous time but we are not scared because God will be with us. Amen. He promise he shall be with us. Do you love the Lord? God bless you. Hallelujah. I leave the pastor to come. Glory. Glory. Glory. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank God that he changed the note for us. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. I was just fellowshipping the other day, I think, with my wife. And can you put for me Romans 8:20 27? Pastor Boris has mentioned it. and um 8:27. We all know it, but I just want to um then just go down there. 28th. Actually, it was 28. Yeah, 28th. For we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose. And all things all things work together. And if you look at it, it's not um it's not like all things are good, right? Some of the things happened like really and look at the life of Jacob. Huh? Really?

Everything that happens in our life has a purpose. Amen. Might not understand when we are going through it but the there is a purpose because he loved us because of the grace of God in our life. Oh God help us to have to see what you see the way we see the way God looks at an overcomer. Sometimes we don't look at this as he said it so well.

Thank you for the word of encouragement. Thank you for speaking to our heart, Father. Thank you, Father, for bringing us back where we come from. That we come from you, Lord Jesus Christ. We have been loved with elective love. You loved us before the foundation of the world. Lord, you are the alpha and your omega. And our omega, Father Lord, is not the grave. Our omega is not, Father Lord, the sickness. Our omega is not a defeat. But father, our destination is heaven in your presence as overcomers. Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for your victory.

Thank you. Thank you, Father. Sister Katy, Sister Raymond, Sister Esther, if you can prepare to sing that song. Worship the Lord. Just uh I think it will be just appropriate now if you can prepare to sing for us as as getting ready for that. I just want to uh don't I don't want to add anything but just want to put a little bit as they're getting prepared just put a little thought here. Um you know the prophet says the love of God is the elective love is that that's the difference. Sometimes we see, oh, oh, but but if God loved me, why this? Why this? Why this? That's not how you measure God's love. God's love is elective love. As he put it so well, it's where you come from. That's the key. Where you come from determines where you are going. Amen. That's God's love. And and and and as God loved, he said, "Love, I loved Jacob. I hated Esau. Looked like a good man. like the one who was working hard and different things but God's love was more important because he put something in Jacob. Somehow Jacob loved the birthight. Somehow he just loved it. He just that what he was putting all his effort even to the point of lying just for that birthight because God put something inside of him is that love. And how do you prove your love towards God? by believing. How do we prove our love towards God? By believing what he said and by conducting ourself or myself with joy amidst the trials, amidst the hard things that you don't understand. But I still conduct myself. I still worship the Lord. I still express myself with joy because the finality of the journey of the pilgrimage, I will be with him. Amen. Despite what go this flesh goes through or the mind go through and situations go through. Thank God that he has given us the mind of Christ. Now we see different job. Job where were you? God didn't have to argue with him with situations here and all these things. I know they happen but where were you Job? That's when that's where that's the key. Thank you Pastor Bur.
