[15:59] [Music]
[16:52] My boat of life
[16:55] sails on the troubled seas.
[16:59] Whenever there's a wind in my sail,
[17:06] I have a friend
[17:10] who's watching over me
[17:13] when the breeze turns into a gale.
[17:20] I know the master of the wind.
[17:27] I know the maker of the rain.
[17:34] He can calm the storm and make the sun
[17:38] to shine again.
[17:41] I know the master of the wind.
[17:48] Sometimes I soar like an eagle to the
[17:52] highs.
[17:54] Among the peaks my soul can be found.
[18:01] An unexpected storm may drive me from
[18:05] the heights. May bring me low, but it'll
[18:09] never bring me down.
[18:14] I know the master of the wind.
[18:21] I know the maker of the rain.
[18:28] He can calm the storm and make the sun
[18:31] to shine again.
[18:35] I know the master of the wind.
[18:38] Sometimes,
[18:41] sometimes I soar like an eagle to the
[18:46] heights
[18:48] among the peaks. My soul can be found.
[18:55] Unexpected storm may drive me from the
[18:59] heights. May bring me low, but it'll
[19:03] never bring me down.
[19:08] I know the master of the wind.
[19:15] I know the maker of the rain.
[19:22] He can calm the storm and make the sun
[19:25] to shine again.
[19:29] I know the master of the wind. I know.
[19:35] I know the master of the wind.
[19:42] I know the maker of the rain.
[19:48] He can calm the storm to make the sun to
[19:52] shine again.
[19:55] I know the master of the wind.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Greater he that is in me. You can have
[20:08] your seats if you'd like. Let's
[20:13] [Music]
[20:18] start off with the chorus there.
[20:21] [Music]
[20:27] Greater is he that is in me.
[20:31] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[20:35] is in the world.
[20:39] On the day of Pentecost, a mighty
[20:43] rushing wind
[20:46] blew into the upper room and baptized
[20:50] all of them.
[20:53] With the power greater than any earthly
[20:58] foe,
[21:00] I'm so glad I've got it. Now I'm going
[21:03] to let the whole world know.
[21:07] Greater is he that is in me.
[21:10] Greater is he that is in me. Greater is
[21:15] he that is in me than he that is in the
[21:19] world.
[21:21] Satan like a roaring lion roaming to and
[21:26] fro
[21:28] seeking whom he may devour. The Bible
[21:32] tells me so.
[21:35] How many souls have been his prey to
[21:38] fall in some weak out?
[21:42] But God has promised us today his
[21:45] overcoming power.
[21:49] Greater is he that is in me.
[21:52] Greater is he that is in me.
[21:56] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[22:00] is in the world. Greater greater is he
[22:04] that is in me. Greater is he that is in
[22:08] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[22:13] that is in the world.
[22:22] When we all get to heaven. 403.
[22:31] Sing the wondous love of Jesus. Sing his
[22:38] mercy and his grace. In the mansions,
[22:44] bright and blessed. He'll prepare for us
[22:49] a place
[22:51] when we all
[22:54] get to heaven.
[22:56] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[23:01] when we all
[23:04] see Jesus.
[23:06] We'll sing and shout the victory.
[23:12] While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
[23:16] clouds will overspread the sky.
[23:22] Oh,
[23:23] bling days are over. Not a shadow, not a
[23:29] sign.
[23:30] When we all
[23:33] get to heaven.
[23:35] What a day of rejoicing that will be.
[23:40] When we all
[23:42] see Jesus,
[23:45] we'll sing and shout the victory.
[23:50] Let us then be true and faithful,
[23:55] trusting, serving every day. Just one
[24:01] glimpse of him in glory will the toils
[24:06] of life repay
[24:08] when we all
[24:11] get to heaven.
[24:13] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[24:18] when we all
[24:20] see Jesus.
[24:23] We'll sing and shout the victory.
[24:28] Onward to the prize before us. Soon his
[24:34] beauty will behold.
[24:38] Soon the pearly gates will open. We
[24:43] shall tread the streets of gold
[24:46] when we all
[24:48] get to heaven.
[24:51] What a day of rejoicing that will be.
[24:56] When we all
[24:58] see Jesus,
[25:00] we'll sing and shout the victory.
[25:06] Let us then be true and faithful,
[25:10] trusting, serving every day. Just one
[25:16] glimpse of him in glory will the tours
[25:21] of life repay

[25:26] get to heaven.

[34:45] the one behind the desk, oh Lord God.
[34:47] Father, we want to see you, oh Lord. We
[34:49] don't want to see a man, oh God. Lord,
[34:50] we want to see the Holy Ghost, oh Lord,

[34:55] the service, oh God, Lord. Father, we

[36:28] Amen. Exodus chapter 10.
[36:30] Amen. Exodus chapter 10. We'll read from
[36:33] verse 8 to verse 11. And then we'll jump
[36:36] to verse 24 to verse 29. Amen. Exodus
[36:40] chapter 10 from verse 8 to verse 11.
[36:45] Amen.
[36:51] Amen.
[36:54] And Moses and Aaron were brought again
[36:56] unto Pharaoh, and they said unto them,
[36:58] "Go serve the Lord your God, but who are
[37:01] they that shall go?" And Moses said, "We
[37:04] will go with our young, with our old,
[37:07] with our sons, with our daughters, with
[37:09] our flock, and with our herds will we
[37:12] go. For we must hold the feast unto the
[37:15] Lord." And he said unto them, "Let the
[37:18] Lord be with you, as you will let you
[37:21] go, and your little ones look to it, for
[37:24] evil is before you." And he says, "Not
[37:26] so. Go now ye that are men and serve the
[37:29] Lord for that ye desire. And they were
[37:33] driven out from from Pharaoh's presence.
[37:38] Let's jump again to verse 24. Read 24-
[37:42] 29. Amen.
[37:45] And it said, "And Pharaoh called unto
[37:47] Moses and said, go ye serve the Lord and
[37:51] let your flock and your herds be stayed.
[37:53] Let your little ones also go with you."
[37:56] And Moses said, "Thou must give us
[37:59] sacrifice and burnt offering that we may
[38:02] sacrifice unto the Lord our God. Our
[38:05] cattle also shall go with us, and there
[38:07] shall not and hoof be left behind. For
[38:10] therefore must we take to serve the Lord
[38:12] our God, and we know not with what we
[38:16] must serve the Lord until we come
[38:18] hither." But the Lord had on Pharaoh's
[38:21] heart, and he would not let them go. And
[38:24] Pharaoh said unto him, "Get thee from
[38:26] me. Take heed to thyself. See my face no
[38:29] more. For on that day thou seeest my
[38:32] face, thou shalt die." And Moses said,
[38:34] "Thou has spoken well. I will see thee
[38:37] thy face again no more." Amen. May the
[38:41] Lord add his blessing to the reason.
[38:43] Amen. You You may have your seat. Amen.
[38:51] Amen. I want to speak this evening on
[38:53] Amen. Reasonable no more. Amen.
[38:57] Reasonable no more. Amen. Reasonable no
[39:01] more. Amen. Reasoning is is one of the
[39:05] tactics of Satan. Amen. Satan has you
[39:07] know many tactics um that he uses
[39:10] against the children of God against a
[39:12] man humans. And and reasoning is one of
[39:15] his his his greatest tactics. Amen. To
[39:17] get people to reason the word of God.
[39:19] Amen. Boy, the reason why sometimes
[39:22] Satan will use reason is because
[39:23] reasoning can have an an element of
[39:26] truth to it. Amen. Reasoning can have an
[39:29] element of truth toward. Reasoning is a
[39:31] fine line between believing God's word
[39:34] and disbelief in God's word. Amen.
[39:37] Reasoning stands between doubt and
[39:39] faith. Amen. It seem to be a ground
[39:41] where you can stand and almost feel
[39:43] like, well, I I kind of believe what the
[39:45] Bible says or what God says, but at the
[39:47] same time, you reasoning and thinking,
[39:50] well, well, maybe this other way might
[39:52] be right as well. And so, Satan always
[39:54] likes to get the believer in that place.
[39:56] Amen. Because we know that the scripture
[39:58] says that a double-minded person, amen,
[40:00] shall never receive anything from the
[40:02] Lord. Amen. And so, Satan will always
[40:04] try to use reason, amen, to to get the
[40:06] believer to a place where they have a
[40:08] double mind. Amen. and they they have a
[40:10] second option or a a second plan. Amen.
[40:12] Because the reasoning can have a truth
[40:14] an element of truth to it. And Satan
[40:16] will always try to do that. Amen. And
[40:18] you know Satan, Amen. as brother
[40:20] Brandamo teaches. Amen. He shows us that
[40:22] you know Satan began his work. Amen. All
[40:25] the way from heaven. Amen. Or brother
[40:28] Brandam say that sin originated from
[40:30] heaven. Amen. And and what happened was
[40:33] that Satan Amen. began, amen, to to to
[40:35] to reason with with some part of the
[40:38] angels that were in heaven. Amen. We can
[40:40] read in the book of Revelation. Amen.
[40:42] And and the prophet begin to show us
[40:43] that it was a third part of those
[40:45] angelic beings. Amen. That that Satan
[40:47] drew with him from heaven. Amen. And
[40:50] cast down into the earth. Amen. But you
[40:52] see, he begin to reason with the angels.
[40:54] Amen. Begin to reason with them of of
[40:56] him being able. Amen. To to to to exalt
[40:59] himself. Amen. above God and be
[41:02] worshiped as God was worshiped. Because
[41:04] all that he desired was what? Was
[41:06] worship. Amen. And so he was looking and
[41:08] saying, you know, trying to reason with
[41:09] these angels, amen, to believe that he
[41:12] was going to be able to be greater than
[41:14] God. Amen. And these angel believe or
[41:16] were captivated, amen, by the reasoning
[41:19] of Satan. Amen. And we know what
[41:21] happened that as as they got together,
[41:23] there was a war in heaven. Amen. Where
[41:25] Lucifer wared against Michael in heaven.
[41:27] But we know the end of the war. Amen.
[41:29] that that that Lucifer was cast out of
[41:31] heaven. Amen. He couldn't stand in
[41:33] heaven. Amen. He couldn't stay in the
[41:35] presence of God anymore. He was cast out
[41:37] of there. Amen. Him and all his
[41:39] reasoning was sent away from the
[41:41] presence of God. Now we see how Satan,
[41:43] amen, will go on and and he'll come on
[41:45] on earth. Amen. And then as he's on
[41:47] earth, amen, there's a garden that has
[41:49] been set. Amen. And there is Adam and
[41:51] there is Eve in this garden. Amen. And
[41:53] and we know how Satan again will begin
[41:56] to approach mankind. Now we know how in
[41:58] the garden Adam and Eve were in perfect
[42:01] harmony with God. Amen. They believed
[42:03] the word of God. They they stayed behind
[42:05] the word of God. But man say that was
[42:07] their protection. Amen. It was the word
[42:09] of God that was given to them. It was
[42:11] their shield. It was their protection.
[42:13] So for as they stayed behind the word of
[42:15] God, there was no way that Satan was
[42:17] going to be able to get his way through
[42:19] and to them. Amen. But you see, Satan
[42:21] was able to isolate, Amen. isolate Eve
[42:24] into a certain place. Amen. and begin to
[42:26] speak to Eve. Amen. And brother Ben was
[42:28] say that all that he was doing was
[42:30] reasoning with Eve. Obey the word. Amen.
[42:33] He was reason with Eve. Obey the word.
[42:35] He was reasoning with her to say you
[42:37] know not everything that God has said is
[42:39] actually true. Amen. That God is away
[42:43] from you Eve. Amen. And so begin to
[42:45] reason with Eve. And we know how that
[42:47] Satan was able to make a way through to
[42:49] Eve and get Eve to believe. Amen. the
[42:52] reason of Satan and reject amen the
[42:55] faith in the word of God that was given
[42:57] to them. Amen. He used reasoning to get
[43:00] her to a place where she accepted his
[43:02] reasoning. Amen. Over the faith, Amen.
[43:05] in the word of God. Amen. And we know
[43:07] how that begin to bring a fall in the
[43:10] human race. Amen. And man begin to fall
[43:13] and and these things begin to happen.
[43:15] And you see when Satan realized his
[43:17] success, amen, in reasoning with man and
[43:20] causing them to fall, Satan begin to use
[43:23] that against the the the rest of the
[43:26] man. Amen. Mankind that will follow,
[43:28] Amen. after Adam and after Eve. Amen.
[43:31] And so up until today, Satan continues,
[43:34] Amen. to use his reasoning power, amen,
[43:37] to try to get the believer to reason
[43:40] against God's word. Amen. to accept his
[43:42] reasoning over the faith of God. Amen.
[43:46] But the one thing we know is that the
[43:47] believer, amen, today is living, amen,
[43:50] under the reality, amen, of a prophecy,
[43:53] amen, that has been spoken over her.
[43:56] Amen. Are you with me this evening? The
[43:58] believer is living, amen, under the
[44:00] reality of a prophecy, amen, that has
[44:03] been spoken concerning her. Amen. And
[44:05] the prophecy says, amen, that this bride
[44:08] in this age, amen, she is not like Eve.
[44:11] Amen. That there is a there is a
[44:13] distinction, amen, between you, amen,
[44:16] the second Eve, Amen, and the first Eve.
[44:18] Amen. He's saying that this bride is not
[44:20] like Eve. Amen. There is something
[44:22] different about this bride. Amen. But
[44:25] still, we have to realize that we are
[44:27] fighting an enemy. Amen. We are fighting
[44:29] an enemy, amen, that still wants to get
[44:31] us, amen, to reason the word of God.
[44:35] Amen. See, Satan doesn't care. Amen.
[44:37] Obey the fact that we are predestinated.
[44:40] Amen. He doesn't care that we are
[44:42] predestinated sons and daughters of God.
[44:44] Listen, he did not care. Amen. That Eve
[44:47] was the wife, amen, of Adam. And Adam
[44:50] was in the image of God. Amen. But you
[44:52] see, Satan did not care about Eve being
[44:55] the wife of Adam. All Satan's purpose
[44:58] was was to destroy the plan of God.
[45:01] Amen. So Satan is not looking and say,
[45:03] "Okay, okay, these are predestinated
[45:05] people." Amen. So I'm going to try not
[45:07] to reason against them. Amen. But
[45:09] actually, we are a target of Satan.
[45:11] Amen. Satan wants to target us. Amen.
[45:14] Get us to reason. Amen. The word that we
[45:16] have received in the sage. Amen. Because
[45:18] he knows that reason, Amen. will bring
[45:21] the word, amen, to a place where it will
[45:23] not be fulfilled in our lives. Amen. So
[45:26] Satan is not so much worried about it.
[45:28] Amen. We've been predestinated. Amen.
[45:30] And he continues in his tactics to try,
[45:33] Amen, to get the believer to disbelieve
[45:35] the word of God. Amen. Because when he
[45:37] was able to get unto Eve and and get Eve
[45:40] to reason, Amen. and do all this, for a
[45:42] season, it looked like Satan, Amen, had
[45:44] a victory. Amen. For a season, it looked
[45:47] like Satan had a victory. Amen. But you
[45:50] see, we are living in another season.
[45:52] Amen. We are living in another season.
[45:54] Amen. For a season, it looked like he
[45:57] had the victory, but the seasons have
[45:59] changed. Amen. Amen. There is another
[46:01] dispensation. Amen. A dispensation in
[46:04] which Amen. That there is a second Adam
[46:07] and a second Eve. Amen. You see the
[46:09] first Adam and the first Eve. Amen. They
[46:12] made their fall and made a mistake.
[46:14] Amen. But the prophecy is going forward
[46:16] that with the second Adam, Amen. And the
[46:19] second Eve, Amen, they will believe the
[46:21] word of God. Amen. They will not fall,
[46:24] Amen. like the first Eve fall. Amen.
[46:26] They will not reason, Amen. in the word
[46:29] like the first eve reason the word of
[46:31] God. Amen. But they amen
[46:34] the word itself amen has been made flesh
[46:37] in the believer today. Amen. In other
[46:40] word amen the word the bridegroom. Amen.
[46:42] The bridegroom in know was Jesus Christ.
[46:44] He is the word. Amen. And that
[46:47] bridegroom. Amen. From his side he
[46:49] pulled out a bride. Amen. And she is
[46:52] just like he is. Amen. Brother Brandon
[46:54] will say that. Amen. She is flesh of his
[46:56] flesh. Amen. You will say that she's
[46:58] born of his bone. Amen. You'll say that
[47:00] she's power of his power. Amen. And on
[47:03] the end, brother Brandham will say that
[47:04] she is him. Amen. So in other words, if
[47:07] if if Satan Amen. when Jesus the word
[47:11] was made flesh on earth, Amen. If Satan
[47:13] could not get Jesus to reason, Amen.
[47:16] Against the word, Amen. that was spoken
[47:19] concerning him. Then this bride also was
[47:21] in a position, amen, where she can stand
[47:24] as Jesus do. Amen. when he walked on
[47:26] earth in flesh and not reason, amen,
[47:29] against the word that has been given to
[47:31] her. Amen. Are you with me this evening?
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Brandon will say
[47:37] this. He said, always remember that.
[47:39] That's my message. He said, you must
[47:41] obey the word. And he said, "And know
[47:44] anything contrary to it, leave it
[47:46] alone." He said, "It may look good, but
[47:49] don't reason against God's word." He
[47:52] said that's the first first thing Satan
[47:54] did was reason against God's word to Eve
[47:58] and she never doubted it. I want you to
[48:00] notice that brother Brandham said she
[48:02] never doubted it. She just reasoned.
[48:06] Satan reasoned it. Amen. He said, "And
[48:09] that's and that's the way they do
[48:11] today." Isn't it reasonable that we
[48:13] should do this? Isn't it reasonable? If
[48:15] it's against the word of God, leave it
[48:17] alone. It's the voice of Satan. Amen.
[48:20] Amen. It said let the word Amen. It said
[48:22] if the word Amen. If the word abideoid
[48:24] in you and my word aboid and my word in
[48:27] you then ask what you will the Holy
[48:29] Spirit ye abide in me my word in you. He
[48:32] said that's the word made flesh. Amen.
[48:35] He said if you abide in him and his word
[48:37] abide in you that's the word made flesh.
[48:40] He said ask what you will and it will be
[48:43] done. Amen. He said that's the way. Get
[48:45] all the creeds, all things away and hold
[48:48] to the word because it is Christ. He
[48:51] said notice then it will manifest
[48:54] itself. Amen. We are living in a season,
[48:57] amen, where God has restored to us,
[49:00] amen, has given us the power of the Holy
[49:03] Ghost. Amen. And not only has he given
[49:05] us the power of the Holy Ghost, but he
[49:07] has also given us the authority, amen,
[49:10] to operate the power that is given to
[49:12] us. Amen. So, so we we are in a
[49:14] position, amen, as a bride in this age,
[49:17] amen, that we don't need to reason,
[49:19] amen, about the Holy Ghost that has been
[49:21] given to us. We don't need to be
[49:23] reasoning about whether you know this
[49:25] Holy Ghost is true or it's not. We know
[49:27] that it is true. We've had an experience
[49:29] of it. Amen. We know that it lives. We
[49:31] know that it's on the inside of us.
[49:33] Amen. And let me say this, if the Holy
[49:35] Ghost is real to us, amen, that is
[49:37] dwelling on the inside of us. Amen. Now
[49:39] we need to come to understand, amen,
[49:41] that just as as real that the Holy Ghost
[49:43] is, so is it real the authority, amen,
[49:46] that has been given to us by the Holy
[49:49] Ghost, amen, to exercise the power,
[49:51] amen, that is in the word of God. Amen.
[49:54] This is the same time, amen, the Holy
[49:56] Ghost has not only come to give us
[49:58] power, but to give us also the
[50:00] authority, amen, because realize the
[50:02] Holy Ghost is not in us, but Christ
[50:04] himself in you again. Amen. and is
[50:07] Christ in you. And the same authority
[50:09] that Jesus had is the same authority
[50:12] that the bride has today. Amen. To
[50:15] exercise, Amen. the promises that has
[50:17] been given her in the word of God. Amen.
[50:21] It is the exact same authority. Amen. So
[50:24] we don't have to reason, obey. Amen.
[50:26] Obey the Holy Ghost. Obey the authority
[50:27] that has been given to us. Amen. Because
[50:30] the word has already told us. Amen. That
[50:32] the Holy Ghost is for us. The world has
[50:34] already told us. Amen. You ask what you
[50:36] will. you want and it shall be given
[50:38] unto you. What is it? Exercise your
[50:40] authority. Amen. You see, we have
[50:42] received a message that has made us
[50:43] aware. Amen. That we were in Christ.
[50:46] Amen. Before the foundation of the
[50:48] world. Amen. We were in him. We were
[50:51] attribute. We were in his thoughts
[50:53] before the foundation of the world.
[50:55] Amen. And you see as we said that there
[50:58] was a war in heaven. Amen. We said that
[51:00] there was a war in heaven where Michael,
[51:02] a man, fought against Lucifer and his
[51:04] angels. Now, I want you to realize that
[51:06] when this war was being fought, you were
[51:09] in him. Are you with me this evening?
[51:11] When the war was being fought, you were
[51:14] with in him. Amen. Now, Satan, what he
[51:17] was doing in heaven, that he was getting
[51:19] the people to reason. Amen. To to
[51:21] believe that he was going to be greater
[51:23] than God. Amen. But you were in Christ.
[51:26] Amen. And you weren't a part of the
[51:29] reasoning of Satan. Amen. And when Satan
[51:32] was bringing an influence of reason in
[51:34] the realms of heaven. Amen. You and the
[51:37] thought of God, you took sides with
[51:40] Jehovah. Amen. You took so to stand with
[51:43] Jehovah. You took so to stand with the
[51:45] creator. Amen. And not to partake of the
[51:48] reason of Satan. Amen. But you took took
[51:51] part Amen to say that you will stand
[51:53] with the word of God. Amen. And we know
[51:56] that though we have bypassed our
[51:58] theophony. Amen. We bypassed our
[52:00] theophony. And we don't remember these
[52:02] things. But we need to realize that that
[52:04] same thought that was at the beginning,
[52:06] it is what has been expressed today.
[52:08] Amen. That same attribute that was in
[52:10] God at the beginning is the same
[52:12] attribute. Amen. That is in the broad
[52:15] today. Amen. It is the same God that is
[52:17] on the inside of us. Amen. So church, if
[52:20] at the beginning, Amen. before even a
[52:22] world war was if we didn't reason the
[52:25] word, Amen. and we've been now made
[52:27] flesh. Amen. manifested sons and
[52:29] daughters of God. Then we are still on
[52:31] the same position, amen, that we were in
[52:34] heaven, amen, to stand against the
[52:37] reasoning of Satan. Amen. We are still
[52:40] on the same position, Amen. Because it
[52:42] is the same attribute of God that is on
[52:44] the inside of us. Amen. It is the same.
[52:46] Amen. It is the same seed of God that is
[52:49] on the inside of us. It hasn't changed.
[52:52] The decision you made, Dan is the same
[52:54] decision that you will make today. Amen.
[52:56] Because if you were there and you've
[52:58] been expressed today, Amen. you would do
[53:01] exactly what was in the point of God.
[53:03] Amen. Let me say this, church. Amen.
[53:06] Listen, we we have seen, Amen. Many
[53:08] times we see it, amen, that Jesus walked
[53:10] on earth. Amen. Jesus walked on earth.
[53:13] And we know that he was the flesh
[53:15] parrot. Amen. It was God made flesh.
[53:18] Amen. Jesus was that. And he was the
[53:20] fullness. Amen. He was the fullness of
[53:22] the word. Amen. But I want you to
[53:24] realize that when Jesus was made flesh,
[53:26] when he was living, amen, he said that
[53:28] I'm going to send you a comforter. Amen.
[53:30] I'm going to send you the Holy Ghost.
[53:32] Amen. And we know that on the day of
[53:34] Pentecost, Amen. As as it will be there,
[53:36] that the pillar of fire came and it
[53:39] devoided itself. Amen. In other words,
[53:41] that logos, Amen, that was at the
[53:43] beginning, that one pillar of fire, it
[53:45] came and it devoided itself. Amen. And
[53:47] it hang over each and every one of them.
[53:49] Amen. You see what was happening in that
[53:52] moment? You see God flesh. Amen. Jesus
[53:55] had left the earth. Amen. The body had
[53:58] left the earth. But there was another
[53:59] body that was being born. Amen. Because
[54:02] you know the same God that was in
[54:04] heaven. Amen. That made flesh and came
[54:06] down on earth. Amen. When Jesus left his
[54:10] body, amen, is still here. He left the
[54:12] body here which is the church of the
[54:14] living God. That is filled with the same
[54:17] power and anointing. Amen. That same
[54:19] logos that followed. Amen. the children
[54:22] of Israel in the in the Old Testament.
[54:24] It is that same logos that came upon
[54:26] them on the day of Pentecost. And it is
[54:28] that same logos, that same pillar of
[54:31] fire, amen, that is here today and that
[54:33] has been made flesh in Detroit. Amen.
[54:36] You see, many of times we are looking
[54:38] for the pillar of fire and and we're
[54:40] trying to find it and we're trying to
[54:41] see it. But let me say this church, that
[54:43] pillar of fire is dwelling on the inside
[54:45] of you. That logos God has been made
[54:48] flesh again and the body is here again.
[54:51] Amen. He's walking again in bodies just
[54:54] at this time is not just one person
[54:56] Jesus but it is a many membered body.
[54:59] Amen. That Jesus is dwelling in and
[55:02] walking to continue in his work. Amen.
[55:04] So let me say this. If you did not
[55:06] reason, Amen. the word of God at the
[55:08] beginning and you've been made flesh
[55:10] today, you are in position, amen, to
[55:13] have no reason against the word of God.
[55:17] Amen. We in position not to reason the
[55:20] word of God but to simply believe the
[55:22] word of God. Amen. To believe the word
[55:26] of God and exercise the authority that
[55:28] has been given to us in the word of God.
[55:31] Listen, let me say this. The authority
[55:33] is not dependent on how good we are.
[55:37] It's not dependent on our physical
[55:39] power. It's not dependent on physical
[55:41] abilities. Amen. It's not dependent on
[55:44] our weakness. Amen. Brother Brandon
[55:45] would tell the story of this policeman.
[55:47] Amen. And he he would tell the story of
[55:49] how little he was and and how short he
[55:51] was. Amen. But but you see, Amen. He he
[55:53] said that this this this policeman had
[55:55] not even the strength to be able to stop
[55:57] stop a a runaway pony. Amen. But he said
[56:00] that that when when this policeman Amen.
[56:03] When when he changed, Amen. When he took
[56:05] off his normal garment that he wear
[56:07] every day to go out and do his business.
[56:09] Amen. But when he would change and he
[56:11] put on the garment, Amen. of of of an
[56:14] officer. Amen. Of a policeman. Amen. And
[56:17] he will go down the street. Amen.
[56:18] Brother Bren will say now it didn't
[56:20] matter anymore how little he was. It
[56:23] didn't matter anymore. Amen. How small
[56:25] he looked. Amen. But he had a garment
[56:28] on. He had something on that represented
[56:31] his authority. Amen. And let me say this
[56:33] church. We have been given a garment
[56:35] today. Amen. That we can wear the word
[56:38] of God that represent our authority. It
[56:41] doesn't matter. Amen. The weaknesses. It
[56:43] doesn't matter our failures. Amen. What
[56:45] matter, amen, is what are we clothed
[56:48] with? Amen. If we are clothed with the
[56:50] word, if the word is dwelling on the
[56:52] inside of us, if the word is filling our
[56:54] minds, amen, we have, amen, the
[56:57] authority, amen, to stop any power of
[57:00] the enemy. Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; We don't have to reason about it.
[57:06] Listen, this policeman when he put on
[57:07] his clothes, he wasn't reasoning about
[57:10] amening
[57:11] position to be able to control the
[57:13] traffic. Amen. He wasn't reason about
[57:16] him. Why? Because he was clothed with
[57:18] him. He had confidence in what he had on
[57:21] him. Amen. And let me say this. We must
[57:23] have confidence in the word that has
[57:25] been given to us and not reason with it.
[57:27] Amen. We have been clothed with a word,
[57:29] amen, of power. With a word of
[57:31] resurrection. Amen. With a word of
[57:33] healing. Amen. That's what we've been
[57:35] clothed with. Amen. And we don't need to
[57:37] reason it. What we need to do is to get
[57:39] oursel in that word. And when we are
[57:41] clothed with that word, Amen. The
[57:43] authority follows. Amen. Because the
[57:46] scripture said that these signs, Amen,
[57:48] what will they do? They will follow
[57:50] their believer. Amen. And what is the
[57:52] believer? The believer is the faith of
[57:54] God that moves in you. Amen. The
[57:57] believer is the one, amen, that takes
[57:59] the word and believes. And when they
[58:01] believe the word, the signs and wonders
[58:03] will follow them. Amen. Because they are
[58:06] exercising, they're walking in position
[58:08] of authority. And they don't have to
[58:10] reason about it. Amen. They don't have
[58:12] to reason whether it will happen or not.
[58:14] They know that it will happen. Why?
[58:16] Because the word says so. Jesus did not
[58:19] reason. Amen. To say, "Can Lazarus raise
[58:22] up or not?" He had had a vision. He
[58:24] knew, amen, the father had spoken to him
[58:27] and said, "Go and raise Lazarus." Amen.
[58:30] And he went there with faith believing
[58:32] that Lazarus was coming out of the
[58:34] grave. He was in position of authority.
[58:37] He wasn't reasoning about the word that
[58:39] was spoken concerning him. Let me say
[58:42] this, church. It's time for us to stop
[58:43] reasoning. Amen. And begin to believe
[58:46] what the word has spoken concerning us.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word has already said that we
[58:51] are the final voice. Amen. What voice is
[58:54] it? Amen. It is the voice of the
[58:56] beloved. What voice is it? It is the
[58:58] voice of Christ. Amen. In the bride
[59:00] being spoken again. Amen. It is not our
[59:03] voice. Amen. It is his voice. We have
[59:06] been told to prophesy again. Listen, we
[59:09] don't need to prophesy anything new. All
[59:11] we need to do is prophesy what the word
[59:13] says. Amen. All we have to do is speak
[59:16] what the word says. That is the word of
[59:19] prophecy. Amen. It's the word that he
[59:21] has already spoken. And if we will put
[59:23] that on our lips, it will manifest
[59:25] exactly what it says. Amen. We don't
[59:29] have to reason about it. Amen. But all
[59:32] we have to do is begin to believe it.
[59:35] Brother Brandham said, "And when a man
[59:36] and a woman is dressed in the full armor
[59:39] of God is that it ain't power, it's
[59:42] authority from an hoy." When he says
[59:45] devils, when he says devils will scream
[59:47] and breaks will squeak, is that even
[59:50] death itself will shut up and grace will
[59:52] open at the authority that Jesus Christ
[59:55] gave his church.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; The authority that Jesus Christ gave his
[1:00:02] church. Amen.
[1:00:05] He said, "All all men know this. These
[1:00:08] sign shall follow them that believe." He
[1:00:11] said, "Lift up the authority, the end
[1:00:13] sign." He said, "His hands raised up
[1:00:16] with with white glove." Speaking about
[1:00:18] the policeman, his hands raised up with
[1:00:20] white glove on. And he said, "And every
[1:00:22] car will stop." He said he hasn't got
[1:00:24] enough power maybe to stop a bicycle. He
[1:00:27] said, "But he's got authority to stop
[1:00:29] anything that comes across the street."
[1:00:32] Because why? The whole law of Phoenix is
[1:00:36] behind him.
[1:00:39] Amen. He has authority because the whole
[1:00:43] law of Phoenix is behind him. Why?
[1:00:46] Because he's put on, Amen. the clo that
[1:00:49] represent the authority of Phoenix.
[1:00:52] Amen. Are you with me this evening? And
[1:00:54] we received the word that we can put on
[1:00:57] that represent the authority that we
[1:01:00] have in heaven. Amen. We can put on, we
[1:01:03] can get dressed. Amen. With the
[1:01:05] authority of God. Amen. Listen, let me
[1:01:08] say this. All the law of God is behind
[1:01:11] this bride. Amen. All the promises, all
[1:01:14] the angels, everything is behind this
[1:01:16] bride. We have been cheered up to finish
[1:01:19] the race. Amen. And you know what the
[1:01:21] law of God is? The law of God is that
[1:01:24] whatever he says, it has to come to
[1:01:27] pass.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all of that law is behind this
[1:01:32] bride. That whatever she says and
[1:01:34] believes and does not doubt in her heart
[1:01:37] will have to come to pass. But Satan
[1:01:40] will try to get the believer to reason
[1:01:43] that word. Amen. Get the believer to
[1:01:46] reason. What if it doesn't happen?
[1:01:50] Amen. What if it doesn't happen?
[1:01:54] But it's time to cast their reasoning
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; and begin to say, "This is what the word
[1:01:59] says." Amen. Begin to say, "This is what
[1:02:02] the word says. This is the promise that
[1:02:04] has been given to me, and this is the
[1:02:06] law of God that whatever I say, so far
[1:02:09] as I'm speaking the word, it has to come
[1:02:11] to pass." Are you with me, church? You
[1:02:14] know, it's time to begin to go beyond,
[1:02:16] amen, our own intellectual reasoning and
[1:02:19] begin to take God at his word and begin
[1:02:22] to say, listen, if God said him, then
[1:02:24] he's ready to perform it. Amen. If God
[1:02:26] said him, then he will do it. Amen. But
[1:02:29] Satan will try to get us to raise him.
[1:02:31] It's time to begin to break those
[1:02:33] barriers. Amen. Begin to break those
[1:02:35] cycles and begin to say, "Listen, God
[1:02:38] said it. I believe it." And that settles
[1:02:40] it. Amen. Because all the law of God is
[1:02:43] behind this bride.
[1:02:46] Amen. It is all behind this bride. Amen.
[1:02:51] And he has given us the fullness of his
[1:02:53] word in this last days. Amen. The
[1:02:57] fullness of his word. He has given it to
[1:02:59] us. Amen.
[1:03:02] And he has made us now his made peace.
[1:03:05] Amen.
[1:03:07] To stand against the reasoning of Satan.
[1:03:10] Just as we stood, amen, right before the
[1:03:14] foundation of the world and we're not
[1:03:16] captivated by that reasoning, we have
[1:03:18] been expressed now. And he's saying now
[1:03:21] the full word has been restored to you
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; and you are being called back to where
[1:03:26] you were at the beginning. Your identity
[1:03:29] has been made known to you. And he said,
[1:03:31] now you can stand against the reasoning
[1:03:34] of Satan.
[1:03:35] Now you can stand when it comes and he
[1:03:37] said it can't happen. You can stand and
[1:03:39] say it will happen.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we've come to know who we
[1:03:44] are. We have received a message. Amen.
[1:03:46] That has come to reveal to us that we
[1:03:48] came from him and we are going back to
[1:03:51] him. That we are just here for a moment
[1:03:53] to be tested and to be tried. But in the
[1:03:56] testing and the trials, we've been given
[1:03:58] authority. Amen. To be able to overcome
[1:04:01] the testing and the trial by the word of
[1:04:03] God.
[1:04:05] Amen.
[1:04:07] And what God is asking us to do is put
[1:04:09] our faith in the infallible word of God.
[1:04:14] Put our faith in the infallible word of
[1:04:16] God because faith is what will destroy
[1:04:19] and and defeat reasoning is to put our
[1:04:22] faith in the infallible word of God
[1:04:25] because it is a battle. Amen. It is a
[1:04:28] battle. And we know that the greatest
[1:04:30] battle that has ever been fought is in
[1:04:31] the mind. Amen. And it is a battle who
[1:04:34] has Satan, our adversary. He is
[1:04:36] determined to not to stop until we ahead
[1:04:40] of this place. He's determined that
[1:04:43] whatever he can do to get us to reason
[1:04:45] the word of God, he will do us. Amen.
[1:04:48] But now we have the privilege to know
[1:04:51] the tactics of the enemy. Amen. Are you
[1:04:54] with me? We have the privilege to know
[1:04:56] the tactics of the enemy. That the
[1:04:59] enemy's tactics is to get me to reason
[1:05:01] God's word.
[1:05:03] Amen. So now that we know his tactics,
[1:05:05] Amen. what we have to do is to take the
[1:05:07] opposite.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have to take the opposite and
[1:05:12] say, "Okay, he wants us to reason, then
[1:05:15] we are not going to reason."
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are going to be reasonable no
[1:05:19] more. We are not going to reason
[1:05:21] anymore. Amen. But we just going to take
[1:05:23] the word as it's being spoken and we're
[1:05:25] going to believe it and stand on it.
[1:05:27] Amen. It doesn't matter how long it's
[1:05:29] going to take, but we just going to take
[1:05:31] that word and stand on it. Stand on that
[1:05:34] promise. Amen. Stand on it. No matter
[1:05:36] what comes or goes, just stand on it and
[1:05:38] not reason it anymore. Amen.
[1:05:43] Because Satan is still, he knows that
[1:05:46] because he was successful in the Garden
[1:05:48] of Eden with reasoning.
[1:05:51] Now he's saying with the second Eve, I'm
[1:05:53] going to try the same thing. I'm going
[1:05:56] to do the same thing. I'm going to try
[1:05:58] to get them to reason again. Listen to
[1:06:00] brother Brandham. He said the devil won
[1:06:02] the battle over the human race by
[1:06:05] reasoning with the human race.
[1:06:08] That's how he won the battle. Just
[1:06:10] reason. He said why it stands to reason
[1:06:14] this would be it stands to reason. If
[1:06:17] the reason is contrary to the word then
[1:06:20] the reasoning is wrong. Brother Brandham
[1:06:22] says again is that the word is right. He
[1:06:26] said just the way it's written. He said
[1:06:28] don't put any private interpretation.
[1:06:31] Just say it the way it's written and
[1:06:34] believe it like that. See God's took
[1:06:37] care of it. It's just exactly the way
[1:06:41] it's supposed to be. So let's just
[1:06:43] believe it that way. Is that now is the
[1:06:47] word every word is that the Holy Spirit
[1:06:50] in man. every sentence of the Bible is
[1:06:52] that the Holy Spirit in you will
[1:06:54] punctuate with a amen because the Holy
[1:06:58] Spirit wrote the Bible. Now I find this
[1:07:01] analogy incredible. Brother Brandham
[1:07:03] said the Holy Spirit that wrote the
[1:07:04] Bible is the same Holy Spirit that is in
[1:07:07] you. And so that same Holy Spirit can do
[1:07:10] nothing but believe what he wrote.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It can only do one thing and is to
[1:07:16] believe what he wrote. That same Holy
[1:07:19] Spirit that wrote the Bible is in us to
[1:07:21] believe what he wrote. And he said, "And
[1:07:23] if he is in you, you can you you how can
[1:07:27] he say, well, that's for another age."
[1:07:29] He said, "That's for this or that's for
[1:07:31] that." He said, "How can he say that and
[1:07:33] be the Holy Ghost in you?" He said,
[1:07:35] "Can't do it?" He has to say amen to it.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has to say amen to it because
[1:07:43] he's the same one that wrote the word.
[1:07:45] Amen. He can't reason the word that he
[1:07:47] wrote. Amen. He can only believe the
[1:07:50] word that he wrote. He can only say amen
[1:07:52] to the word that he wrote. Amen. And
[1:07:54] it's that Holy Ghost in you and me. It
[1:07:57] is not in us to reason. But it is Satan,
[1:07:59] amen, that is trying to infiltrate in
[1:08:02] our mind to get us to doubt the word.
[1:08:05] But the Holy Ghost in us is only saying
[1:08:08] amen to the word of God. Amen. You see,
[1:08:12] whenever someone amen has sickness or
[1:08:14] whatever it is, if you realize there is
[1:08:16] always something on the inside of you
[1:08:19] that believes that the sickness is not
[1:08:21] onto death, there is always something on
[1:08:23] the inside that believes that there is
[1:08:25] healing power. Amen. That believe that
[1:08:28] God is more than able to bring healing.
[1:08:29] God is more than able to bring
[1:08:31] deliverance. There is something on the
[1:08:32] inside that is present. Amen. That is
[1:08:35] saying, "I believe that this word, amen,
[1:08:37] is true. And if we hold on it, it will
[1:08:39] bring the healing. And we go into prayer
[1:08:42] and faith believing. Amen. And we see
[1:08:44] God come on the scene. But at the same
[1:08:47] time, while we're believing, there is
[1:08:49] another voice in our mind that is
[1:08:51] saying, "But it can be so because the
[1:08:53] doctor's report is too heavy to bear and
[1:08:57] begin to reason and begin to bring other
[1:08:59] thoughts." But you know the word says we
[1:09:01] need to cast down every imagination.
[1:09:04] We need to cast down every reasoning.
[1:09:07] Amen. Because the Holy Ghost is here to
[1:09:09] perform what the word says. Amen. That's
[1:09:12] what the Holy Ghost is here to do. To
[1:09:14] perform what the word says. Amen. That's
[1:09:17] all it's here to do. To perform the word
[1:09:19] of God. Amen. But you see, Satan is very
[1:09:22] territorial.
[1:09:24] Amen. He is very territorial. In other
[1:09:28] words, he likes to have ownership.
[1:09:32] Amen. He likes to have ownership. And he
[1:09:36] likes to have ownership of what doesn't
[1:09:38] belong to him.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; That's the way he is.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's territorial. He wants to have
[1:09:48] ownership and especially what doesn't
[1:09:50] belong to him. He could have the world.
[1:09:52] But Brandon said told us, you know, he's
[1:09:54] got the world and he's got loads of
[1:09:57] people in the world. Amen. He could have
[1:09:59] them. He can do whatever he wants. But
[1:10:01] yet he said, "No, I want this bride.
[1:10:04] I want this bride. He's territorial. He
[1:10:07] doesn't own it, but yet he wants it.
[1:10:10] Amen. He He wants to gain ownership of
[1:10:12] our body. He wants to gain ownership of
[1:10:14] our spirit. He wants to gain ownership
[1:10:16] of our soul. But you see, all these
[1:10:19] three realms does not belong to Satan.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It does not belong to Satan
[1:10:24] because the scripture shows us, amen,
[1:10:27] that our bodies has been bought with a
[1:10:29] price. Amen. And that our body is the
[1:10:31] temple of God. Our body does not belong
[1:10:34] to Satan. It has been purchased, amen,
[1:10:37] as a temple for God to dwell in. Amen.
[1:10:41] But Satan is very territorial. The
[1:10:43] scripture also tells us that our mind is
[1:10:45] a place where God wants to dwell. That
[1:10:48] we must have the mind of Christ. He has
[1:10:51] given us his mind so that he can dwell
[1:10:53] in that channel. Amen. That we can have
[1:10:56] his mind. And we know that our soul, the
[1:10:58] scripture shows us, amen, that our soul
[1:11:00] has been redeemed by the blood of Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ. Amen. So all these three parts
[1:11:06] being do not belong to Satan. Amen. But
[1:11:10] Satan is territorial. Amen. And he wants
[1:11:13] to gain ownership of these parts of the
[1:11:15] human being. Amen. He wants to gain
[1:11:18] ownership of our body. Ownership, Amen,
[1:11:20] of our mind. Ownership of our soul.
[1:11:22] Amen. But let me say this. God has
[1:11:24] already claimed, Amen. It's already the
[1:11:27] possession of God. Amen.
[1:11:31] And you see, when Satan realizes that he
[1:11:34] can't have ownership, when he realizes
[1:11:37] that he can't fully have ownership of
[1:11:38] your soul, he can't fully have ownership
[1:11:40] of your of your spirit realm. He can't
[1:11:43] fully have ownership of your body. Why?
[1:11:45] Because you've surrendered your life to
[1:11:46] Christ.
[1:11:48] Then he moves on to bring reasoning.
[1:11:52] And why is he bringing reasoning?
[1:11:55] because he wants to gain a little
[1:11:57] portion of your inheritance.
[1:11:59] Amen. He wants to still have a little
[1:12:02] portion in there. Amen.
[1:12:05] He doesn't want you to be fully fully
[1:12:07] Amen. committed. Amen. To the word, but
[1:12:11] he still want to have a portion. So, he
[1:12:13] try to bring reason. You know, there is
[1:12:14] a story that has been told, amen, of a
[1:12:16] man that that owned a land. Amen. and he
[1:12:19] owned this land and and eventually,
[1:12:21] amen, he lost his land and and someone
[1:12:23] bought the land. But that was his land.
[1:12:26] That was his inheritance. Amen. And
[1:12:29] someone bought this land and and years
[1:12:30] go by and this man was able to save up
[1:12:33] again. And and he went back to to the
[1:12:35] man that has bought the land. And he
[1:12:36] said, "I'm coming back to buy this land
[1:12:39] because it is mine. I want it back. No
[1:12:42] matter what the price is, I'll take it
[1:12:43] back." And so the man said, "Okay, I
[1:12:46] I'll give you back your land. And this
[1:12:48] is the deal. this is the price for it.
[1:12:50] But then the man said to him, you know,
[1:12:52] um I'll give you the whole land, but you
[1:12:55] know, there is a portion in the middle
[1:12:57] of the land. Amen. That I I kind of have
[1:13:00] it, you know, I have some futons there.
[1:13:03] And would it be okay that even though
[1:13:05] you you buy the whole land, but I keep
[1:13:07] that portion in the middle of the land?
[1:13:10] And you know, the man said, "Well, well,
[1:13:12] okay, that's all right. You you can keep
[1:13:14] that portion of that land and and I'm
[1:13:16] taking most of the land anyway." so you
[1:13:18] can keep the portion of it. So the man
[1:13:20] gets this land and he begin to cultivate
[1:13:22] this land and and begin to plant his his
[1:13:24] different tents and begin to you know
[1:13:26] you know get this land ready and and and
[1:13:28] use it for his own purpose and his own
[1:13:30] gain. But then one day, amen, this man
[1:13:32] that that had asked for this portion in
[1:13:34] the middle of the land, he comes Amen.
[1:13:37] he comes through and for him to get into
[1:13:39] the middle of the land where his portion
[1:13:41] is, he has to cross through the entire
[1:13:44] land. He has to destroy everything that
[1:13:47] the man but the land had already sown.
[1:13:50] He had to tear his way through it all to
[1:13:52] get to the portion that he had in the
[1:13:54] land. And when when he was done doing
[1:13:56] whatever he was doing there, then he
[1:13:58] would tear through it again to get out
[1:14:00] of the land. You see that's the way
[1:14:02] Satan is. Amen. You see this body,
[1:14:05] everything in the world has been given
[1:14:06] to us. But he want to gain a little
[1:14:09] portion. Amen. Of this body, he want to
[1:14:12] gain a little portion in our mind. He
[1:14:14] wants to gain a little portion in our
[1:14:15] souls. Amen. He want to gain a little
[1:14:17] portion that whenever Amen. He wants to
[1:14:20] come and try to attack us. He will
[1:14:22] destroy everything that we are put
[1:14:24] together. He will destroy the faith. He
[1:14:26] will destroy everything that we believe
[1:14:28] just to get to that little portion.
[1:14:30] Amen. He's very territorial. He doesn't
[1:14:33] want you to have the full land. He
[1:14:35] doesn't want you to have the full Amen.
[1:14:37] control of your body and have your
[1:14:40] healing that you need. He doesn't want
[1:14:42] you have the peace of mind and and have
[1:14:44] the mind of God and be meditating upon
[1:14:46] his word. He still want to have a little
[1:14:48] portion in there. Amen. He still want to
[1:14:51] have a little portion in there. And to
[1:14:53] get there, he will have to tear through
[1:14:55] everything that we have built. Amen.
[1:14:58] He is very territorial
[1:15:02] because he wants ownership.
[1:15:05] And you see that was what he was trying
[1:15:08] to do with the children of Israel.
[1:15:12] You see these men? Amen. They had gone
[1:15:15] to Sir John in a strange land and they
[1:15:18] were promised that they will be there
[1:15:19] for 40 years and and after 40 years
[1:15:21] there'll be a deliverer. They will come
[1:15:24] that will take them to a land that is
[1:15:25] flowing milk and honey. Amen. But for 40
[1:15:28] years they were going to be bained in
[1:15:29] this land. And and as they were in this
[1:15:32] land, amen, they were given a portion,
[1:15:34] amen, in go. We know the story. Amen.
[1:15:37] But but came a man a man that did not
[1:15:38] know Joseph as the scripture will say
[1:15:41] and he begin to move them from a
[1:15:43] position amen of of a free people to a
[1:15:46] position of a slave.
[1:15:48] Amen. He became territorial. He he be to
[1:15:51] take them and and wind them up and and
[1:15:53] make them his own. Amen. He wanted them
[1:15:56] to be his own. Amen. But you see there
[1:15:59] came a season where your deliverance
[1:16:00] drew noi. Amen. Your deliverance drew
[1:16:03] noi. And God sent him a deliverer. He
[1:16:06] sent him a deliverer, a vindicated
[1:16:08] prophet. Amen. With with the pillar of
[1:16:10] fire vindicating his ministry and and
[1:16:12] with signs and wonders following him.
[1:16:14] Amen. He sent him a deliverer because
[1:16:16] the season had come for them to be
[1:16:18] delivered from the land that they were
[1:16:20] in. But you see, Pharaoh didn't want
[1:16:23] them to leave.
[1:16:25] Sarah Pharaoh wanted to have ownership
[1:16:27] of these people. Amen. Pharaoh wanted to
[1:16:30] have them. Amen. owned them as slaves
[1:16:33] and owned them to fulfill his own
[1:16:36] purpose and benefit. Amen. That's what
[1:16:38] Pharaoh wanted. He didn't want them to
[1:16:40] go. Amen. And you know that's what Satan
[1:16:42] would try to do. Try to gain ownership.
[1:16:46] You know, he had tried over and over
[1:16:47] again to gain ownership of the church of
[1:16:49] the living God. Amen. Try to hold the
[1:16:51] church bay. Amen. Try to hold the church
[1:16:53] in slavery and and try to hold the
[1:16:55] people in the church. Amen. Bayon
[1:16:57] slavery. You see, because he want to
[1:16:59] gain ownership of what belongs to God.
[1:17:02] You see, we don't belong to Satan. We
[1:17:04] belong to God. But he's trying to gain
[1:17:06] ownership of it. That was what he was
[1:17:08] doing to the children of Israel. He
[1:17:10] didn't want to let them go because he
[1:17:12] said, "These are my people." But in
[1:17:14] reality, they weren't his people. These
[1:17:16] were the people of God. And the season
[1:17:18] had come that God has sent a deliverer
[1:17:21] to say is this time, amen, for my people
[1:17:23] to be released, amen, from the ownership
[1:17:26] of Satan. Amen. It's time for them to be
[1:17:29] released from the hands of oppression of
[1:17:31] Satan. Amen. This that season at come,
[1:17:33] that hour at come. Amen. But Satan was
[1:17:36] trying to hold them. Amen. In that
[1:17:38] bondage, hold them. Amen. In that
[1:17:40] slavery. Amen.
[1:17:42] And try to keep them there. Amen. But
[1:17:44] you see, there was a message that Amen.
[1:17:47] Moses came with. Amen. There was a
[1:17:49] message that he came with. God gave him
[1:17:52] specific words to bring and speak to Mo
[1:17:54] to to Pharaoh. And the words that he was
[1:17:56] to speak to Pharaoh was that Pharaoh let
[1:17:59] my people go.
[1:18:02] Amen. He came to tell Pharaoh, Pharaoh,
[1:18:05] let my people go. You don't have
[1:18:08] ownership of these people anymore. It is
[1:18:10] season has come for their deliverance.
[1:18:12] The season had come for them to leave
[1:18:14] Egypt. And you can hold them anymore.
[1:18:17] You have to let my people go. Amen. He
[1:18:21] had come to liberate them from the
[1:18:23] ownership that Satan had in their life.
[1:18:26] Amen. And let me say this, God in this
[1:18:28] day, amen, has sent a message to le
[1:18:31] liberate this bride from any ownership
[1:18:34] that Satan had had over us. He has sent
[1:18:36] a message to liberate the church from
[1:18:39] the ownership and the bondage that Satan
[1:18:41] had the church in with dogmas and creeds
[1:18:44] and all that he had. He sent a message
[1:18:46] to liberate the church from the
[1:18:49] ownership of of Satan that he may take
[1:18:51] control that he may take the preeminence
[1:18:54] in the church. Amen.
[1:18:58] And the message was let my people go.
[1:19:01] And I believe that the message we have
[1:19:02] received today is saying the same thing
[1:19:05] to the God of this evil age that he must
[1:19:07] let this bride go. He can't hold this
[1:19:11] bride. He can't hold our bodies. He
[1:19:14] can't hold our spirit and neither can he
[1:19:16] hold our soul. Amen. Christ has already
[1:19:19] bought them. It is already in the
[1:19:21] possession of God. But it's time for the
[1:19:23] bride of Jesus Christ to stop reasoning
[1:19:26] whether they belong to God or they
[1:19:29] belong to Satan. I am here to declare to
[1:19:31] you tonight, you don't belong to the
[1:19:33] devil. You don't belong to Satan. You
[1:19:36] don't belong to the sickness. You don't
[1:19:38] belong to the mo battle. You belong to
[1:19:41] peace. You belong to freedom. You belong
[1:19:43] to joy. You belong to worship. It is
[1:19:46] Satan, amen, that is trying to bring the
[1:19:49] bride in a position to reason who she
[1:19:52] really is. But the word has come to
[1:19:55] reveal to her who she really is. That
[1:19:58] she is a daughter of God. That she is a
[1:20:00] son of God. Amen.
[1:20:04] We don't need a reason anymore. Amen.
[1:20:06] Listen. It was reasonable for Daniel
[1:20:08] that day to say, "Listen, if that is
[1:20:11] this is what the the the the laws of the
[1:20:14] land says, then I have to obey it." It
[1:20:17] was reasonable for him to obey the the
[1:20:18] laws of the land. But Daniel said,
[1:20:21] "Listen, I don't belong here." Amen. I
[1:20:24] belong in another place. My law is not
[1:20:27] the law of of of this Babylon, but my
[1:20:30] law is the law of God. And the law of
[1:20:32] God says that I must go and to pray. And
[1:20:35] no matter what the law of this land
[1:20:37] says, I am going to follow the law of
[1:20:39] God. I am not going to reason, amen,
[1:20:42] with the laws of this land. Are you with
[1:20:44] me, church? He said, I am not going to
[1:20:46] reason with the laws of this land.
[1:20:48] Listen, the law of this earth is to get
[1:20:50] people sick. The law of this earth is to
[1:20:53] get people in a suicidal state. The law
[1:20:56] of this earth is to get a people
[1:20:57] depressed, get a people in anxiety. But
[1:21:00] we are here to say we are not going to
[1:21:02] abide by the law of this land. We are
[1:21:04] not going to avoid. Amen. By the laws of
[1:21:07] Babylon, we've got another law that we
[1:21:09] abide and boy. It's the law of heaven.
[1:21:12] Amen. That is the Lord that we are
[1:21:13] following.
[1:21:15] Amen. And Daniel said, "I am not going
[1:21:18] to reason." Amen. I'm not going to
[1:21:20] reason with with Nebuchadnezzar. I'm not
[1:21:22] going to reason with the king, but I'm
[1:21:23] going to continue. Amen. To stand on the
[1:21:26] word of God. Listen, that caused him to
[1:21:28] go in the lion's den. But because he
[1:21:30] didn't reason the word of God, uh, there
[1:21:32] was a fire that stood down in the lion's
[1:21:35] den to set him free and deliver him from
[1:21:38] the host of the lion. Listen, when we
[1:21:40] stand on the word of God and we get to a
[1:21:43] position where we say we will not reason
[1:21:45] the word, we will not reason, Amen, the
[1:21:47] word of God. But we will take him at his
[1:21:49] word. He will come and back up his word.
[1:21:52] He will come and back up his word. He
[1:21:55] did it for Daniel. He did it for the
[1:21:57] Hebrew children. Amen. It was reasonable
[1:22:00] for them to bow to the image. Amen. Are
[1:22:03] you with me? It was reasonable to bow to
[1:22:05] the image. Everyone was bowing to the
[1:22:08] image.
[1:22:10] You know, church, everyone is accepting
[1:22:11] the doctor's report. Listen, we believe
[1:22:13] the doctor. We we we understand and we
[1:22:16] know God heals through them. Amen. But
[1:22:18] church, sometimes God is wanting us to
[1:22:20] step on another realm, on another line.
[1:22:23] Amen. And begin to take him at his word.
[1:22:25] Amen. Listen, it was reasonable for them
[1:22:28] to bow, but they said whether the Lord
[1:22:30] deliver us or not, we will not bow.
[1:22:33] Amen. We will not bow. Amen. Listen, God
[1:22:36] wants to bring this church, this bride,
[1:22:38] to a perfect faith. Amen. To a faith,
[1:22:41] amen, that doesn't reason. A faith that
[1:22:43] doesn't doubt. A faith that doesn't
[1:22:45] waver, but a faith that stands firm upon
[1:22:48] the word of God and watches that word
[1:22:51] come to pass.
[1:22:53] You know, church, when I was growing up,
[1:22:56] as a young boy,
[1:22:58] as a teenager, I remember one time I had
[1:23:00] to go in for for a test and and and and
[1:23:03] I wasn't doing well. And and when I went
[1:23:05] in and the doctors begin to tell talk to
[1:23:07] me about problem with my liver
[1:23:10] and they said, I had I have some liver
[1:23:13] problems. Values were not doing well and
[1:23:15] and different things. But man, I I just
[1:23:17] kept on growing with it. and we just
[1:23:19] kind of left it alone and and really
[1:23:21] never paid attention to it. Amen. And
[1:23:23] and I mean I always doing okay but amen
[1:23:26] sometimes I I would be sick and
[1:23:27] different things and and we came we
[1:23:30] moved here into Canada and eventually
[1:23:31] amen things will begin to get you know a
[1:23:33] little a little harder for us in
[1:23:35] healthwise. Amen. And and a man and we
[1:23:37] begin to have different tests and begin
[1:23:39] to go to doctors and begin to see them
[1:23:41] and and different tents and they begin
[1:23:42] to tell us a man that yeah there is a
[1:23:44] there's a problem with the liver. Amen.
[1:23:47] the values are not looking good and
[1:23:48] there's a problem with the liver and and
[1:23:50] they begin to to kind of do what they
[1:23:52] can do as doctors and and and all that.
[1:23:54] But we begin to we begin to trust in the
[1:23:57] Lord that he'll take care of us. Amen.
[1:23:59] We begin to trust to say, you know, he's
[1:24:01] our healer. Amen. And and then he's a
[1:24:03] deliverer and a man and and so finally
[1:24:05] it was just a bait was just a bait
[1:24:07] Monday. Amen. that I had to go in for an
[1:24:10] ultrasound
[1:24:12] because they actually wanted to know
[1:24:13] what is happening with the liver and
[1:24:15] something. And so I meant going into the
[1:24:17] ultra saying I was believing and
[1:24:18] trusting the Lord and Amen. the report
[1:24:20] was that for sure there's something
[1:24:22] wrong with it and and and maybe they're
[1:24:24] going to find it out or whatever it is.
[1:24:26] And so we went in, Amen. But we went in
[1:24:28] believing. Amen. We went in with no
[1:24:30] fear. We went in believing that God is
[1:24:32] with us. Amen. That that if we have to
[1:24:34] go through some trials, Amen. He's going
[1:24:35] to be with us. That we're going to stand
[1:24:36] like the Hebrew children will stand.
[1:24:38] Amen. No matter what the doctor say,
[1:24:40] we're still going to believe God that
[1:24:41] he's our healer. Amen. And so we went
[1:24:43] into the ultrasound and and they did
[1:24:45] their work and and they they send me
[1:24:47] into a waiting room as we waited for
[1:24:49] them. And you know the the the doctor
[1:24:52] came back in and and and came in with
[1:24:54] other two two more one more doctor and
[1:24:56] another nurse I believe.
[1:24:58] And they came in and they began to look
[1:25:00] at me and they and they said, "Well,
[1:25:02] well, the last report you did,
[1:25:05] your liver enzyme, amen, was very high."
[1:25:07] And and and that caused us, you know, to
[1:25:10] be very worried and different things.
[1:25:12] And and and and your reports of rain and
[1:25:15] the liver enzyme was actually very very
[1:25:16] high, way beyond the the average. And
[1:25:19] they said, "It has got us worried." And
[1:25:20] so we we brought you in for the
[1:25:22] ultrasound. And they said, "Well, we did
[1:25:24] the ultrasound and all the values are
[1:25:27] normal."
[1:25:29] They said, "We did the ultrasound and we
[1:25:32] found nothing wrong with your liver."
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, this is the God that we
[1:25:37] serve. Amen. When you begin to take him
[1:25:40] at his word and say, "I'm not going to
[1:25:41] raise him." But we're walking in faith
[1:25:43] and say, "Listen, my God is still a
[1:25:45] healer." Amen. He's more than able to
[1:25:48] step on the sin. Amen. And perform the
[1:25:50] word that he's promised to us. Because
[1:25:52] if it said the boy his stripes we are
[1:25:54] healed, then boy his stripes we are
[1:25:56] healed. Amen. It's time for the boy to
[1:25:59] begin to start taking steps. Amen. To
[1:26:01] begin to start gaining ground to say I
[1:26:04] am not going to reason and settle down
[1:26:06] with only what the only doctor says.
[1:26:09] Amen. We begin to take God at his word
[1:26:11] and watch him move on the scene. Amen.
[1:26:17] The Hebrew children said we will not
[1:26:18] pay. We will not pay. Amen. But we will
[1:26:22] stand. Amen. We will not reason. Amen.
[1:26:25] But we will stand. Amen. And so Pharaoh
[1:26:28] was trying, Amen, to get these people
[1:26:30] still in his ownership and try not to
[1:26:32] let them go and try to get a hold of
[1:26:34] them. Amen. But you see that that's the
[1:26:37] same thing that Satan is trying to do
[1:26:38] today to deploy of the living God. Amen.
[1:26:42] Try to keep them in ownership. But let
[1:26:44] me say this to you, church. We have an
[1:26:46] abstract toal date. Amen. We have an
[1:26:50] abstract total deed. Listen, Satan may
[1:26:53] have had some rights to us. Amen.
[1:26:57] Because of the fall and everything that
[1:26:58] happened. But now we have received an
[1:27:02] abstract toal deed. Amen. That says that
[1:27:05] Satan has no more claim on us. Amen. He
[1:27:10] has no claim on your body. He has no
[1:27:13] claim on your spirit. He has no claim on
[1:27:17] your soul. That is what the abstract
[1:27:19] title deed says that he has lost
[1:27:22] ownership of you and me. Amen. He has
[1:27:26] lost ownership of you and me.
[1:27:32] But yet he's trying to get us to reason
[1:27:35] that. And this evening, the spirit of
[1:27:37] God is here saying it's time to break
[1:27:39] those chains of reasoning. Amen. and
[1:27:42] say, "Listen, I am not going to reason
[1:27:44] anymore with Satan, but I'm going to
[1:27:47] believe what the abstract title D says.
[1:27:50] That everything, Amen, has been stricken
[1:27:52] off and everything the word says belongs
[1:27:55] to me and I can take it and I can
[1:27:58] believe it and I can claim it." Amen.
[1:28:01] Brother Brandham says, "Now we have
[1:28:04] received that token, that Holy Ghost."
[1:28:06] Amen. And he said, "What is it?" He is
[1:28:08] our advocate. Amen. He is the one that
[1:28:11] goes forth and takes the word and bring
[1:28:14] it before Satan and tells him you have
[1:28:17] to give it back. No matter what Satan
[1:28:19] takes away from us, we have an advocate.
[1:28:22] Amen. We have someone that stands for us
[1:28:24] to take the word of God and claim what
[1:28:27] he has already purchased for us. Amen.
[1:28:30] It's time to stop reasoning with Satan,
[1:28:32] but it's time to begin to believe and
[1:28:35] take God at his word.
[1:28:38] Amen. Because Satan all he wants if he
[1:28:41] can get us to reason, he's beaten us.
[1:28:45] Amen. But we have an afterstit. He has
[1:28:49] already taken the book. He has opened
[1:28:51] the book. We've seen our name in it.
[1:28:53] Amen. He has given us the promise and he
[1:28:56] say go forth. Amen. And now you have
[1:28:59] been made that mighty am to go forth and
[1:29:02] conquer. Amen.
[1:29:05] And Satan realized that he is stripped.
[1:29:08] He realized that he is stripped. You
[1:29:11] see, when he realized by the message
[1:29:12] that Moses brought that he was stripped,
[1:29:15] then he began to bear again.
[1:29:18] He began to bear again. And he began to
[1:29:21] say to Moses, "Listen, Moses, okay, let
[1:29:25] the man go." Amen. Let the man go. And
[1:29:29] sometimes you say, "Okay, let your soul
[1:29:31] be redeemed."
[1:29:33] But let me gain some position in your
[1:29:35] spirit. Let me gain some position in
[1:29:37] your in your body. He said, "Let the man
[1:29:40] go, but leave the voice behind. Leave
[1:29:43] the children behind." Amen. Listen,
[1:29:45] that's what Satan has been trying to do
[1:29:46] to many of families. Amen. He's saying
[1:29:49] in many churches as well, he's saying,
[1:29:51] you know, let the pastor go to adoption.
[1:29:53] Amen. Let the elders go and believe the
[1:29:55] message. Let the elders go and read the
[1:29:57] word, but let the children alone. Amen.
[1:30:00] Let the children alone. Amen. Let the
[1:30:02] young people annoy alone. Let me take a
[1:30:04] hold of the young people. But let the
[1:30:06] elders go. Let them go and worship.
[1:30:08] Amen. And he's doing the same with
[1:30:10] families. Let the parents believe the
[1:30:12] message. Amen. But let the children
[1:30:14] alone. Amen. Let me have the children.
[1:30:17] Amen. Let me have some control of the
[1:30:19] children. Let me ento the children with
[1:30:21] the world. Let me be able to entice and
[1:30:23] get a get a foothold in your home. Well,
[1:30:26] let me say this church. God gave you
[1:30:28] that home.
[1:30:30] God gave you those children. They are
[1:30:33] your possession. God gave them to you
[1:30:36] because listen, he did not make a
[1:30:38] mistake.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; He did not make a mistake for you to
[1:30:43] have them in your family. He did not
[1:30:46] make a mistake for them to be born in
[1:30:48] the message. Amen. He had a purpose in
[1:30:52] what he was doing. Amen. It is our
[1:30:55] inheritance. Amen. But Satan is trying
[1:30:58] to back in and to say, "Let me have
[1:31:01] them." Amen. He's trying to do the same
[1:31:03] thing that he was doing with Moses to
[1:31:05] say, "Listen, you can go. You can
[1:31:07] believe the message." Amen. But not your
[1:31:09] children. Let the children stay behind.
[1:31:12] Let the children stay in Egypt. Amen.
[1:31:15] Oh, hallelujah. And that's what he's
[1:31:17] been trying to do to the church. Amen.
[1:31:19] But listen, we are not here to reason
[1:31:21] with him. We are not here to reason
[1:31:23] abate our children. Reasonate our
[1:31:25] parents. reason about our family, reason
[1:31:28] about the church. Amen. The church has
[1:31:30] been promised a refilling of the baptism
[1:31:33] of the Holy Ghost, but Satan want to
[1:31:35] reason the church out of it. But I
[1:31:38] believe that the spirit of God is here
[1:31:39] this evening to say it is time to stop
[1:31:42] reason and claim our God-given rights.
[1:31:45] Yield yourself and say, "Lord, here we
[1:31:48] are. We are open for an outpouring of
[1:31:51] the Holy Ghost. We are open for a
[1:31:53] refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:56] Oh hallelujah.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Trying to get them to raise and leave
[1:32:01] your children behind. And you know
[1:32:03] sometimes he will go even further and
[1:32:05] say okay you can have your children.
[1:32:08] You can have your children. You can have
[1:32:10] your family. Amen. But leave the
[1:32:14] sacrifice behind.
[1:32:16] You know when he when he came when when
[1:32:18] when when Moses came to him, he said,
[1:32:20] "Let the men go. We leave the children
[1:32:23] behind." him. And Moses said, "No, that
[1:32:26] won't happen."
[1:32:28] He said, "That won't happen." And he
[1:32:30] said, "Okay." Then he drove Moses away
[1:32:32] and more plagues came. The locust came
[1:32:34] and the darkness came. And when he
[1:32:37] couldn't stand it, he said, "Okay, Moses
[1:32:38] come back." And and this was the last
[1:32:41] time that Moses and Pharaoh were going
[1:32:44] to actually stand face to face.
[1:32:47] This was the last time. And this time,
[1:32:51] Pharaoh
[1:32:53] had an idea to say, "Okay, you can have
[1:32:56] your family. You can have it. You can go
[1:32:59] with your children. You can go with the
[1:33:01] elders. You can go with everyone, but
[1:33:03] don't take the sacrifice.
[1:33:06] Don't take the cattle." Amen. Leave it
[1:33:08] all behind. This was the last
[1:33:11] face-to-face encounter between Moses and
[1:33:14] Pharaoh. And he said, "Leave the
[1:33:16] sacrifice behind." Amen. Listen, when it
[1:33:18] come to the showdown, you know what
[1:33:20] Satan says? Leave your worship behind.
[1:33:23] Amen. Leave your devotion behind. You
[1:33:26] can have your family. You can bring them
[1:33:28] to church. You can go to the meetings.
[1:33:30] You can do all things, but leave the
[1:33:31] worship behind them. Leave the family
[1:33:33] altar behind them. Leave the time of
[1:33:35] prayer behind them. Leave the time of
[1:33:37] being in the word of God behind. Leave
[1:33:40] your worship behind. Leave your
[1:33:41] sacrifice behind. When it comes to the
[1:33:44] face toface encounter, he said, "You can
[1:33:46] have everything you want, but don't take
[1:33:48] the worship. You can have everything you
[1:33:50] want, but don't take the sacrifice."
[1:33:52] Amen. That was the last bargain that he
[1:33:55] wanted to offer Moses. But Moses said,
[1:33:58] "No, no, we need to go to offer, Amen, a
[1:34:03] sacrifice unto the Lord." Amen. And we
[1:34:06] are not just living with our children.
[1:34:08] Amen. We are not just living with our
[1:34:10] families but we are taking our sacrifice
[1:34:12] with us because the the the commission
[1:34:14] that was given to Moses was say let my
[1:34:18] people go. Amen. And if he's saying let
[1:34:22] them go they say whatever belongs to
[1:34:24] them they are taken along with them. If
[1:34:26] the cattle belong to them they were
[1:34:28] taking the cattle with them.
[1:34:32] Satan will try to get you to say leave
[1:34:33] your sacrifice behind. Amen. Leave your
[1:34:36] sacrifice behind. But Moses said, "No,
[1:34:39] we are not living anything behind. We
[1:34:41] are taking everything with us." Amen.
[1:34:43] Listen, we are not living our worship
[1:34:45] behind them. We are not living our joy
[1:34:47] behind. We are not living a prayer life
[1:34:49] behind. Amen. Listen, if the altar has
[1:34:51] been torn down, I believe it's time to
[1:34:53] build it up again. Amen. Just like
[1:34:55] Elijah did. He begin to build it up
[1:34:58] again. Begin to take one stone upon
[1:35:00] another stone and upon another stone and
[1:35:03] begin to build it up again. Amen. What
[1:35:05] was he doing? He was doing what the Lord
[1:35:07] told him to do.
[1:35:09] And when he was done it all, he put a
[1:35:11] sacrifice on him. And he said, "Lord, I
[1:35:13] have done all things according to your
[1:35:15] word." And right then the fire came and
[1:35:17] fell. Amen. Let me say this, church.
[1:35:20] Satan is trying to get us to reason. But
[1:35:23] let me say this, as Moses said, we are
[1:35:25] not here to reason. We are not here to
[1:35:27] reason with him. We are not here to
[1:35:29] reason with the Pharaoh of this world.
[1:35:31] Amen. We here to take God at his word
[1:35:33] and believe and stand firm upon that
[1:35:35] word. Amen. And watch that word come to
[1:35:38] pass. Amen.
[1:35:40] Brother said, "Brother, I'll tell you
[1:35:42] when Israel got ready at midnight, they
[1:35:45] had everything that they had in this
[1:35:48] world packed up and ready to go." Amen.
[1:35:51] Listen, the hour has come that we are
[1:35:54] getting ready to leave this place. Amen.
[1:35:57] The hour that come for the Exodus. Amen.
[1:35:59] And in that exodus they said that we're
[1:36:02] not leaving anything behind. Moses said
[1:36:04] I am not reasoning with you Pharaoh. I
[1:36:06] have no reason. Nothing is is taking
[1:36:08] back here. Everything is going with us.
[1:36:11] And listen we are in another exodus. We
[1:36:13] are in a third exodus. Amen. And Satan
[1:36:16] again is trying to get us to reason.
[1:36:18] Amen. To say leave this behind. Leave
[1:36:21] that behind. Amen. Don't have don't go
[1:36:23] all the way. Amen. But we are here this
[1:36:25] evening to say Satan we are not here to
[1:36:28] reason. We are not here to reason but we
[1:36:30] are here to say we are taking everything
[1:36:32] amen that God has given us. We are
[1:36:35] taking every promise. We are taking
[1:36:37] every word and we are standing on it
[1:36:39] believing that God will bring it to
[1:36:41] pass.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] He said that we're ready to go. He said
[1:36:48] God send us a revival like that that we
[1:36:51] pack up everything and get ready to go.
[1:36:53] He said the midnight cry is a common. He
[1:36:56] said, "Go ye a to meet him." He said,
[1:36:59] "You better have everything packed up."
[1:37:01] He said, "You better not have not have
[1:37:03] nothing of this world luring you back
[1:37:06] and strength to hold you down." He said,
[1:37:08] "Pack up. Let's get ready where you're
[1:37:10] going." And he said, "And you know what
[1:37:13] I tell you, you you and I said, I tell
[1:37:15] you, they they were so true to God till
[1:37:18] Pharaoh got so excited at midnight. He
[1:37:21] said, get out and get out and get it
[1:37:24] going." He said, "Take everything you
[1:37:26] got and go." Brother Ram said, "I am so
[1:37:28] glad that a man can live so close to God
[1:37:32] till the devil don't know what to do
[1:37:34] with him." Is that right? Get out, get
[1:37:37] going, and obey God. Amen. Listen,
[1:37:39] that's where we want to live. So close
[1:37:42] to God that the devil doesn't know what
[1:37:44] to do with us. Where we are not
[1:37:46] reasoning at all, but we are just taking
[1:37:48] that word and just believing it. Listen
[1:37:51] church. God is is is eager
[1:37:54] to perform his word. God is eager, amen,
[1:37:58] to bring his word to pass. But he's
[1:38:01] looking for a people that will believe.
[1:38:03] A people that would not reason that
[1:38:05] word. A people that will take that word
[1:38:08] and begin to stand on it like Moses
[1:38:09] stood and say, "If God said so, I
[1:38:13] believe it. And I believe that he will
[1:38:14] bring it to pass." Amen. It's time to
[1:38:17] stop reasoning about anything. Amen.
[1:38:19] Listen, Gyrus had every right to reason.
[1:38:22] He had every right to reason that that
[1:38:24] day when when the doctor said there's
[1:38:26] nothing more we can do for your
[1:38:28] daughter. Amen. Gyrus could have said,
[1:38:31] you know, I guess get the casket ready
[1:38:33] and and let's get the funeral
[1:38:35] arrangements going.
[1:38:37] But you know, Gyrus said, "No, let me
[1:38:40] get to Jesus. Let me get to Jesus."
[1:38:43] Amen. And he could have reasoned out,
[1:38:44] but he said, "I'm not going to reason
[1:38:46] anymore with what the doctor is saying
[1:38:47] when I'm going to get to the one that is
[1:38:49] able, amen, to raise the dead." Amen.
[1:38:52] And I believe that the time has come for
[1:38:53] us not to reason anymore. But to say,
[1:38:56] "Lord, we're taking you at your word. We
[1:38:58] believe in your word and we're standing
[1:39:00] on it." And God is paying to perform it.
[1:39:02] Amen. He will bring it to pass. We've
[1:39:04] all got testimonies of how we've
[1:39:06] believed God and God has fulfilled his
[1:39:08] word in our lives. Amen. Listen, that
[1:39:10] same God that did it back then is the
[1:39:13] same God that would do it again today.
[1:39:14] Amen. Listen, Elijah was trying to tell
[1:39:17] Elisha, "Don't don't follow me. Don't
[1:39:19] come with me." Trying to reason with
[1:39:20] Elisha to say, "Stay here in Dorton and
[1:39:23] and stay here and don't don't follow
[1:39:25] me." But Elisha said, "I'm not going to
[1:39:26] reason about this." Amen. I know that if
[1:39:29] I can see you go, I will receive a
[1:39:31] double portion of it. Amen. And that
[1:39:33] same Elijah ministry is here today.
[1:39:36] Amen. There is a double portion. Amen.
[1:39:38] that is here to be poured out upon the
[1:39:40] bride. But she has to get to a place
[1:39:42] where she keeps her eyes upon Elijah.
[1:39:45] Amen. She keeps her upon the word, upon
[1:39:48] the message. Amen. They say, "I'm not

[1:40:00] "I'm going to follow him because if I
[1:40:02] can see him go, I will receive that
[1:40:05] mantle." Amen. And that mantle will be a
[1:40:07] double portion, amen, of his anointing
[1:40:09] upon us. Amen. Listen, this church has
[1:40:12] received a double portion of the
[1:40:14] anointing of God to continue on his

[1:40:39] the cycle. The musicians can come. Amen.

[1:40:44] and and wondering. Amen. We begin to
[1:40:47] say, "Lord said it. I believe it." And
[1:40:50] that settles it. Amen. Our God is more
[1:40:52] than able. Amen. Let's stand on our feet
[1:40:54] this evening. Oh, hallelujah. He is
[1:40:57] faithful. Amen.

[1:48:50] I believe.
[1:48:54] All things are possible.
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:00] Lord,
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; as the music is just playing softly,
[1:49:08] think about what we have heard this
[1:49:10] evening.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; We should not give him give place to
[1:49:15] reasoning.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Reasons is actually the opposite of
[1:49:19] faith. The enemy just want to bring us
[1:49:21] to the level where we can say, "No, it
[1:49:24] makes sense. It's reasonable." No, God
[1:49:27] doesn't want to bring us to that level
[1:49:28] of saying it's reasonable. But to say,
[1:49:30] God, I believe
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; whether I understand it or not. I don't
[1:49:34] know how it's going to happen, but I
[1:49:36] just want to believe what the word of
[1:49:38] God say says, and I just want to keep
[1:49:41] moving on. I will claim my husband. I
[1:49:44] will claim my wife. I will claim my
[1:49:46] family. I will claim for my healing. I
[1:49:49] will claim for my children. I will claim
[1:49:52] a life of sanctification. I will claim a
[1:49:54] life of prayer. I will claim all my
[1:49:57] sacrifices. I will rebuild the altar.
[1:50:00] Whatever they need, whatever the Holy
[1:50:02] Spirit has pointed to our life this
[1:50:04] evening want say Lord we want to believe
[1:50:06] and we want to continue with the word of
[1:50:08] God. So let each one just pray as the as
[1:50:11] we in this atmosphere just telling and
[1:50:14] confess to the Lord what you are going
[1:50:16] to believe. Father, Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:50:18] we thank you this evening, Father, as
[1:50:21] you have spoken to our heart, Father, as
[1:50:24] each believer is speaking to you and
[1:50:26] talking to you, Father. Lord, we we
[1:50:29] thank you for the word that came with
[1:50:31] power, with demonstration. And Father,
[1:50:34] just to point to our lives where Lord,
[1:50:36] we realize we have been bargaining so
[1:50:40] much with the enemy where we have given
[1:50:42] him room, Lord, and we have maybe
[1:50:44] compromised here and there, Lord. Father
[1:50:47] Lord Jesus Christ by the word of God
[1:50:49] comes to remind us oh God we have to
[1:50:52] take the word of God not just portion a
[1:50:55] portion of the word of God but the whole
[1:50:57] word of God. Father, this evening we
[1:51:00] come to say Lord we believe the word of
[1:51:03] God father for deliverance of the soul
[1:51:06] to be free father to accept the word of
[1:51:09] God to receive redemption for our souls
[1:51:13] father but not only for our souls but
[1:51:15] also redemption also deliverance in the
[1:51:18] spirit in our mind where we found
[1:51:21] ourselves so much captive or prisoners
[1:51:25] bound by different things in our mind.
[1:51:27] Father Lord this evening Lord we want to
[1:51:30] reject it. We want to bring everything
[1:51:33] under subjection of the word of God.
[1:51:35] Every imagination every reasoning under
[1:51:38] the subjection of the word of God and
[1:51:41] say Lord let the word of God have the
[1:51:43] preminence in my life. Let the word of
[1:51:45] God have permanence in my mind. Let the
[1:51:48] word of God have permanence in my spirit
[1:51:50] Lord Jesus Christ this evening. If I let
[1:51:52] the word of God reign and rule in my
[1:51:54] whole life, Father Jesus Christ, may you
[1:51:57] have preminence in our bodies, oh God,
[1:52:00] we want you Lord to be the Lord and be
[1:52:02] the master in everything, Father. Lord,
[1:52:04] we do and say, God, may you come and
[1:52:07] bring deliverance in our lives, Lord, in
[1:52:09] our families. Lord, we pray Lord for our
[1:52:12] loved ones, for those who are still
[1:52:14] bound. Lord, in this third Exodus, we
[1:52:17] want to stand like Moses. We are not
[1:52:19] making compromises. We are not
[1:52:21] bargaining. We are not telling the enemy
[1:52:23] Lord that we our our children will be
[1:52:25] left behind. But we are claiming them in
[1:52:27] the name of Jesus Christ. Satan,
[1:52:31] let the children of God be separated and
[1:52:33] be delivered this evening in the name of
[1:52:35] Jesus Christ. So we send your word. We
[1:52:38] send the word of God to our children
[1:52:40] wherever they allowed. whether they in
[1:52:42] church, whether they're not out of the
[1:52:43] church, whether out of the church,
[1:52:45] wherever they are, we send the Holy
[1:52:47] Spirit where they are and we claim them
[1:52:49] in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh father,
[1:52:53] this evening as the anointing was so
[1:52:55] real. Father, we accept the word of God.
[1:52:57] Whatever in the situation they are in,
[1:52:59] they're not slaves anymore, but they Oh,
[1:53:02] Father, we look at them in the image
[1:53:04] before the foundation of the world. We
[1:53:06] want to walk in the thought of God as
[1:53:08] you express this evening, Lord. Father,
[1:53:10] we claim them in the name of Jesus
[1:53:12] Christ. We claim our husband. We claim
[1:53:14] our wives. Oh God, we claim them in the
[1:53:17] name of Jesus Christ this evening.
[1:53:19] Father, that your Lord would restore
[1:53:21] them to us in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:24] Oh God, in this Exodus, we are not
[1:53:26] leaving none of them behind. Lord, we
[1:53:28] claim them. We have received the same
[1:53:30] visitation of the Holy Ghost. We have
[1:53:32] received the same holy visitation of the
[1:53:34] pillar of fire. We have received the
[1:53:36] same visitation of a mighty prophet.
[1:53:39] Father, we have received the same
[1:53:41] visitation of the word of God. Father,
[1:53:43] so we believe and we walk by faith. Oh
[1:53:46] God, we pray for healing, Lord, in the
[1:53:48] body, different needs, Lord, for for
[1:53:51] brother Johnny, Lord, we claim in the
[1:53:53] name of Jesus Christ. For brother Luke
[1:53:55] Seak, we claim in the name of Jesus
[1:53:57] Christ. For brother Dan Banford, we
[1:53:59] claim in the name of Jesus Christ. For
[1:54:02] my mother, we claim her in the name of
[1:54:03] Jesus Christ. Father, you are still the
[1:54:06] same yesterday, today, and forever. We
[1:54:08] don't put in your box, father or lord.
[1:54:10] We don't reason about the word of God,
[1:54:12] but we accept every promise in the of of
[1:54:15] God. Every promise in the book is mine
[1:54:18] and we claim it in the name of Jesus
[1:54:20] Christ. Satan has no part in us. Lord,
[1:54:23] we have received the abstract title
[1:54:26] deed. He has no right upon us, but we
[1:54:29] love you, Lord Jesus Christ. We thank
[1:54:31] you, Father. It was so good to be in the
[1:54:33] house of the Lord. We love you, Lord.
[1:54:34] Thank you for sending the man of God and
[1:54:37] speak to our heart. Father, in this
[1:54:39] prayer meeting, Lord, thank you, Lord.
[1:54:41] We love you and appreciate you. In Jesus
[1:54:43] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:54:47] Amen.
[1:54:50] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:54:54] Just want to read one quote and nothing.
[1:54:57] uh is one of my some of my favorite
[1:54:59] pages where I usually put the mark in
[1:55:02] the church age book and it was just in
[1:55:05] line with what the pro the brother said.
[1:55:08] But bam says Satan Jesus said about
[1:55:11] Satan he has no part in me and I have no
[1:55:14] part in him.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; The devil would like to prove that
[1:55:18] difference
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; but he cannot. Amen. So he does all he
[1:55:23] can to destroy the confidence in the
[1:55:26] word.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; But when the church disbelieves Satan
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; and believes the spirit's revelation of
[1:55:33] the word, the gates of hell cannot
[1:55:35] prevail against her. Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; So we are standing on the word of God.
[1:55:40] The gates of hell can never prevail
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; against the revelation we have of the
[1:55:45] word of God.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Praise be to his name. Amen. So it will
[1:55:49] be there is power and then there is
[1:55:52] power
[1:55:54] in the name of
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:56:02] you know that song brother Matendo made
[1:56:04] us to love this song. So
[1:56:08] there is power
[1:56:11] in the name of Jesus.
[1:56:17] There is power
[1:56:20] in the name of Jesus.
[1:56:25] Oh, there is power
[1:56:29] in the name of Jesus
[1:56:34] to break every chain. Break every chain.

[1:57:26] To break every chain. Break every chain.
[1:57:30] To break every chain.

[1:57:37] in the name of Jesus.
[1:57:42] There is victory
[1:57:45] in the name of Jesus.

[1:59:46] but we we continue confessing the word
[1:59:48] of God.
