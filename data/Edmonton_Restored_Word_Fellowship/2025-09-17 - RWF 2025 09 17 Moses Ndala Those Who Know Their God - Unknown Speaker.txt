Speak to us, Lord, supernaturally as we've been listening to the message, Lord Jesus. The important part, the supernatural power of the word. It's not just the natural presentation of a word, but it's the supernatural Holy Spirit that changes our life, changes our attitudes, changes everything about us. So I pray that your blessing would rest upon this service tonight and may we reach out Lord and glorify your name.

That's good to see you here and pray that God will continue to wrap his arms of love and comfort around you through these difficult times. And he's is the real comforter. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. go to the word of God and Colossians um chapter one. Colossians chapter first chapter after Philippians as don't forget the special meetings that starting on Saturday evening at 5:30. I had few announcement I forgot what to say and um so it start at 5:30. Um usually when I put the time I put it as a the quiet time but we have sent those those um some of invite to other people. Usually other churches when they put the time it start at the singing time. Um so there is a bit confusion there. We probably see some people arriving 30 minutes before that time. I'm thinking we take this time as a as a as a song time. Would it be okay if we take it as a song time except the Sunday one? I think they will understand that. But um for the for the Saturday and Sunday we put it as a song time. Um if if there is a we can continue communication through the WhatsApp group or something. I thought I was thinking to think about it and put it as a song time as we can start at a time. So be 30 minutes a bit earlier than in the evening but on Sunday we keep the same time. I'm sorry for that. Um but I'm thinking the service start when we have a quiet time that how I like it so that people come and respect that quiet time and sometimes struggle many things but when we prepare our hearts and then we usually get blessed more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh collisions 1 9 20 9- 20 so I'll I will read some and then I'll let you go I'll let you sit down not goats chapter 1 verse 9 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and what is to prayer about and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the desire of the prophet Paul and I believe the same desire that we have the knowledge of God's will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. And what else? that we might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. &gt;&gt; You can have a seat. Amen. God bless his word. As I looked at this um the knowledge or I just continue a little bit on as on Sunday on the knowledge the third the third attribute of the statue of the perfect man look at it you can see that it's just many angles we can never finish it um but um just put the surface of it and then so that we might move on thought that maybe I'll just touch it again before the main services and break it so I just want to touch leave it again this evening before we go into prayer. So for 20 30 minutes just uh give a little bit of exhortation about it. So go u uh Paul's prayer was that we might walk worthy of of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. So increasing the knowledge of God is a desire. It has to be a desire. It has to be something that all of us desire to have because it's not a one-time thing. It's something that is progressive. As you grow, as you grow, we should grow in knowledge of God more and more so that you can be pleasing in everything and have be willing pleasing to do every good work. If you don't know, usually you don't do things because you don't know. Many people don't do they are good people and everything. They don't do things that we do because they don't know. They don't know better. They don't know anything. And and and sometimes when you tell him, "Oh, I did not know." Amen. But but it's I think God's grace. I think God's grace when you know what you have to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you know what to do, when you know the will of God, it's God's grace. So we should be the more thankful or the more and more thankful because we know what we know. Amen. The one that's been I given more, it will be asked more because they know better. Amen. The other ones don't know better and they do according to their own conscience. But thank God to the to the bride of Jesus Christ in this last age, God has made it that she has to know everything that he needs to know in order to go in the rapture. God has opened the word of God so that she knows and she's aware of it. Amen. God has to make it a revelation. God has make it life. But thank God that we already know. Amen. And that knowledge need to continue to increase and to become more and more real. And then the Bible continues, "Strengthen with Almighty according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness, giving thanks unto the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who had delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son." Is God who delivered us from the power of darkness. It's God who has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not by our own power but by God's grace that we have what we are. Amen. And the Bible says in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins because he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. Amen. Is the Lord Jesus Christ. For by him were all things created, that are in heaven and that are in the earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities and powers. All things were created by him and for him. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; He's the one who deserve to be glorified. He's the one who deserve to be praised. &gt;&gt; As your brother was singing, he's worthy of everything. He's worthy of everything Lord because he's the alpha and the omega. says before all things and by him all things consist. He is the head of the body, the c the church who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Christ Jesus in in the Lord Jesus Christ in him was all the fullness of the deity of God. Amen. Even his even his flesh was a spoken word. Amen. Brother Banam's flesh was not a spoken word. But but the Lord Jesus Christ, his flesh was a spoken word. &gt;&gt; And in him dwell all the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; And having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself, by him I say, whether there be things on earth or things in heaven. Praise be to his name. Glory in his name. I will take this um second scripture where I will take my title. Daniel 11:32 says, "In such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt, and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries. But the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploit. I'll give it a title. Those who know their God. The people who know their God shall be strong and do exploit. &gt;&gt; It's a promise of God. The prophet when he to touches the scripture says it's not something that might be. It's something that is a a certainty. The people who do know their God, they shall be strong and they shall do exploit. They shall do great things. People who know their God, they shall do great things. I was just checking out what is I looking for the word that exploit. Yeah, what is exploit according to the Bible? What is it mean? Actually, so I looked at it and then this is what the internet gave me that says actually do exploit comes from two Hebrew words say they shall do. So the the word exploit is added by the translators by clarity of English. So in actually the word that was expressed in in Hebrews it say they shall do or act or make and perform. So there's no specific word for exploit but even when you are doing something the action that you are doing it has to be an exploit it has to be something great that you are doing. So when he says those who know their God shall be strong and they shall do something. They shall do something they do think something that they have to do has to be marvelous. That Hebrew phrase in in Hebrews implies taking actions. It means doing mighty deeds. Doing mighty deeds. It means acting with boldness and purpose. It's rising to the occasion in face of evil. I kind of like that because only the bride will come to the point where she can face the the evil of this age. &gt;&gt; Only the bride can know what to do in this time because Wonderful. I'm back. Thank you very much, brother. Acting with boldness and purpose, rising to the occasion in face of evil. So, because only the bride can come to the level where she knows what to do and can stand against the evil of the age that we are living in. The bride will stand for what she knows to be the truth. Amen. The bride will not bind to the pressure of laudicia. The bride will not succumb to the pressure of laudicia. But the bride she will do the mighty deeds by staying faithful to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because she knows her God. Amen. She knows who he is. She knows what he says according to the word of God. And she's going to obey God's word. Amen. The prophet will say, "But those who know that God shall do exploit and the power of the resurrected Jesus Christ lives in the man." That's right. He's not dead. He's risen. Christ is not dead. He's risen. I will be with you even in you. And the things that I do shall you do also. Amen. Because how can she do those things? Because God is in her. Because the spirit of God is inside of her and she's bound to do the great things. Amen. Who are those people? Who are those people who will know their God? That the people that the people who know their God are the ones the one to whom the word of God will be open to. Amen. In Daniel 12:4 in continuation the prophet you look in the court of the prophet usually relate the Daniel 11 that we have read to Daniel 12. The people are connected is the same people the people who know their God. Amen. Are you with me this evening? Amen. &gt;&gt; Daniel 12 says, "At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince that stand up for the children of thy people, and there shall be a time of there shall be and there shall be a time of trouble." I believe we are living in a time of trouble. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; We are living in a time where people are becoming nervous and insanity and people don't know who they are. They don't know their identity. Those are kind of trouble where we don't know the truth. You don't know what is right is right. You don't know what is wrong is wrong. People we call right wrong and wrong right. Time of confusion, time of trouble. Said there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. And at that time thy people shall be delivered. Everyone that shall be found written in the book. Amen. I believe the bride is the part. He's talking about the bride there. the part of the related to the bride there because they will be find in the book and they will be delivered. As we come in prayer today, we have to have that certainty that God said if we know him, we are going to do exploit through God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Through his spirit, we can do great exploit &gt;&gt; and many of them shall sleep in the dust. Everyone that shall be found written in the book, and many of them shall that sleep in the dust shall uh or many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake. Some to everlasting life, and some to shame, and everlasting contempt, and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever. By thou, oh Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sha shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end. To the time when we are living in the time of the end. Daniel had a commandment that he has to shut up the words. He know he heard some of the words. He will himself declare, "I don't understand everything that I heard in in in in Daniel 12. I didn't understand everything that I heard, but I told me to shut to shut up the words and to seal the book until the time of the end." But many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased. But in this time, there is a purpose. There is a promise to the there's a pro promise to some people to those who will know their God, they shall do great exploit. The prophet says we are living in a time of scientific research. Says knowledge shall increase in the last days and we see the hour we are living. Notice the condition of the world and the conditions of science. It says the increase in scientific research. One time my grandfather went to see my grandmother in an oxcart. Now it's a jet plane even in orbit in the air and out of space. He says who said this? He says then prophet code says Daniel 12:4 said knowledge shall increase in the last days. We see the Yahweh we are we are living. &gt;&gt; So not knowledge has increased and we see technology has increased. Knowledge has increased in all the aspects you know the things now you know incredible things and medical science and all different things as we heard on Sunday but that's the knowledge of the world. The knowledge of the world has increased. But remember as the knowledge is of the world is increasing on on the worldly things that not where we put our trust. That's not where we put our confidence. But the natural sometime is a type of the spiritual. Amen. In the spiritual realm also God is unveiling great mysteries. Amen. We see in the world they talk about artificial intelligence. Oh that thing is a kind of a monster, right? Because it can do almost everything. And and the more they're training it and I I work a little bit work and my work there to train it and to see how it can just learn. And the more you teach it, the more it learns and the more it learns, the more information it has, the more it can give you the closest answer to the information that you give him. So it's just something and it gives such speed. They call it a super super brain. It's a super brain. The more you train, it become just so powerful and it can do almost anything. Anything that that that requires a memory. Oh that you I mean people have to change job. Everything that require memory they have to change job. Amen. Everything that is repetitive you have to change. You have to think how to to move to another place because it will take over. Amen. &gt;&gt; But as that inter art artificial intelligence is there I believe God is not relying on artificial intelligence. God has come as the headstone to give us the real intelligence. God has come with the will of God to give us the mind of Christ. That's why it is our desire. God, give me the mind of Christ to think like you, to see like you, to have the wisdom like you, to have the understanding like you, to have the discernment like you. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet says the Bible say they will run to and fro in these last days. Knowledge shall increase. It's a sign of the end time. Super. Everything must be super. It won't work. And and even they want super people. So they they got a television cast they call Superman. Always something super super super two or three of them has committed. You talk about people playing Superman. Then some of them committed suicide. So everything is about super super races super things super brain super people. But thank God there is also a super race. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a God super race. It's those who are filled with the Holy Ghost. The proverb say if you have the Holy Ghost those who are in Africa, those who are in India, those who are in Europe, those who are in Canada, those who are in United States, all will behave the same way. Why? Because they have the Holy Ghost that will make them identical. Amen. &gt;&gt; It the robe is not different from the people to behave differently in Africa and to behave here. The Holy Ghost is the robe that that should be the same for everybody. Amen. Don't say this is the gospel only for African people. It is the gospel only for white people. No, it's the gospel for every nation. Because once we have the Holy Ghost, you become part of that super race of God. &gt;&gt; Super people. Amen. Those who know their God. Amen. It's not the knowledge only. The knowledge is the mind. But to know him as a person, to know him having a relationship with me as I mentioned a little bit on Sunday is not only to know about him, but is to know the person of Christ, &gt;&gt; to have a relationship with him, to have a love affair with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet will say, I will send a letter to my wife and I would write it and I write it. Any other person will take it and read it and won't see anything. What is he talking about? Is he doesn't understand? Maybe can read the word. baby. Can I have a picture of it? But my wife, when she's reading that letter, she knows what I'm talking about because she loves me. It's a It's a love letter. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible is a love letter. You need You need to be in love with God. To know God, you need to be in love with God to have that personal relationship with God. Amen. To know his ways, to know his nature, to Oh, praise be to God. The law was there given but the people did not know God behind the law. &gt;&gt; The law was not given to condemn people and to do this and that. But if someone could go into that channel and realize, oh God is love. Even in the law, you realize that everything is about love. Because if you really love God, you don't consider it as a law anymore because you express the love towards him. Amen. The same thing about if you know God is unveiled to you with love. It's not a law anymore. It's a relationship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No one knows me as better than my wife knows me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because she loves me and I love her. We we tell each other secrets and we we know each other. There is another level of knowledge that where we can go even to the capstone. It's another level of knowledge when you know each other so well becomes one. Amen. And that's what God desire that we know each other. He knows that now we need to know him to a greater level. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that the desire as Paul said, I believe and I pray that you come your knowledge of God increases. Not becomes a static nor become like the pastor pray no I know it all. I can't learn anything but God give me more of yourself. Let me know you more. Let me know you more. &gt;&gt; We will go through the Sunday special meetings here. Whatever God has in store, oh God, I want to know you more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there is a way I can raise, I can change the way you can correct me. If there's a place you want to rebuke me, Lord, let your will be done. I desire to learn more. I desire to know you in a greater way. Lord, I want to do exploit in my family. I want to do exploit in my life. I want to do exploit in my relationship with my husband. I want to do exploit in the relationship with my children. I want to do exploit in the relationship even in the society. I want to be a better Christian. I want to do great exploit. What is exploit? Just to stand for the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that your desire? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The six-fold purpose of that of Gabriel's visit to Daniel. The prophet says as he's commenting on Daniel 12:9-10, he says, "Many shall be purified and made white and tried by the wicked shall be shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand. The end time message shall reveal it." The last church age says, "Glory, oh few," says there you are. Oh my, it shakes me to think it. The mystery, the things that the church world bats their eyes and say that nonsense. The mystery of who Jesus Christ was. Not the third person, not a second person, not a third person, but the person of God. All the all these other mysteries of God will be revealed because it's written here in this book and be revealed to the end time generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They can almost see it in seminaries or schools or denominations. Then the Jews could see Jesus being the Messiah. No wonder they cry to think they no wonder they try to think you are crazy. No wonder they think you are foolish. No wonder they can't understand why you don't pluck up with them because there is a power and a vision behind it. A word of God has been revealed to get the church in order for the rapture and the going home. &gt;&gt; I know there is a in the Daniel 12 there is a connection with the 144,000 But remember there's a connection there because it's the part of prophecy that also fulfills for them. But remember if that's prophecy applies to them that those they'll be purified. They will be made white. Remember they won't receive any message that is greater than the message that we have received. &gt;&gt; The 144 will not have another greater perfect message than the one that we have received. The same message if the message that they will receive is the message that we have received. If is purifying them is making them white. It's purifying us today and it is making us white today because we have received the perfect message of God. The unveiling of the word of God we have received it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we dare to receive something that will make them whiter and purify them, we have received the same message that will make us whiter and purify us today. Amen. So we should cherish it. We should love it. We should pray God. I desire to know more about what the word of God says about me. Amen. That's what we desire. And he says here because it's written this book and be revealed to the end time generation because there is a power say they cannot no more see it in seminaries and schools and denomination than the Jews could see Jesus being the Messiah. Through the church ages through the church ages in the age of of of man anointing. If you see Luther, if you see Wesley, even some of the Pentecostal, it's a man anointing. &gt;&gt; It means they have they had intelligence only the intelligence of man, they had read the Bible from the beginning to the to the end. If you see the monks and all the people staying, the priest on that time, even Luther, they had to write the word of God. They had to read it. They had to look in Greek. They had to look this and this. So they know the word of God so so much. like in the same time of Jesus Christ those scribes they that's what they were doing they just reading the word of God making sure that he's coping properly and everything but they miss to see the Messiah &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; they see to see the Messiah amen the same thing here for those of the ages they read the Bible back and forth back and forth but they couldn't see the opening of the seals amen but in our age by God's grace taking a seventh grade ministers Seven great man through him the angel not not him who revealed the seals but the lamb of God reveal the seals and pass it to him. Now we have the knowledge of God's will in our time. God's will cannot be given by a person by your own intellect. Amen. God's will is revealed by the messenger of the age and the messenger of the age gives us to the bride and the bride will be need needs to be eager or desiring to know more &gt;&gt; from what has been given to her. Amen. Elijah Elzo tell me more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I just I was just rejoicing to know that God has opened the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God has opened the word of God for one purpose to get the church in order for the rapture and for the going home. That's why he has opened the word of God. That's why he has increased the knowledge of even of the word of God because in order to prepare for the rapture and the going home the others could not even though they read things they could not have the real knowledge of it because it was not their season. But as it is our season to know God in a greater way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; So what is the knowledge of God? Just summarize it. The Bible says in John 17:3, "This is life eternal that I might know thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom that has the sent." So knowledge is to know him, the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, God himself. Amen. And if you want to desire God, I desire the knowledge of you yourself. The Bible gives us a hint. It says in Proverbs 9:10, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And the for and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. So if you want to have more knowledge of God, God give me the fear to fear your word to obey your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. John 1 John 2:34 says, "Hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments and he that saith, I know him or I know God and keep not God's commandment is a liar and the truth is not in him." &gt;&gt; Oh, I know God. I know God. But you don't follow God's commandment, you don't know him. &gt;&gt; You need to, if you know him, you should follow God's commandment. Oh, God, help us, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; That doesn't stay only lips service but it becomes in action in life manifested in all that we do in our lives in our families and everywhere. Father we cannot know God unless God reveals himself. He does he is through his word his spirit and ultimately through the Holy Spirit. Amen. That's what we desire. The prophet says in I'll be closing to prepare for for prayer because the things in Hebrews chapter 7 they know him in a form and a ritual like our first lesson said they don't know him by the way of perfection. We need to know God in the way of perfection. How to know God the way of perfection? You need to be born again because the things of the world is foolish to the wisdom of this world. But the things of the world is carnal to the believer. The things of the world is carnal to the believer. If you are so you are a different person. You are living in a different sphere. You're no more of this world. You have passed from this life on for this life onto a new life. That's where you can testify and say I know God but I desire to know him more and more. Amen. Amen. Amen. I believe Daniel knew the importance of prayer. Daniel knew the importance of going back to the scroll. Daniel knew the importance of purposing in his heart to serve God. That's why he could say with a certainty those who know God mean those who follow God's commandment those who know the importance of the prayer and importance of of of of the word of God importance of being determined to serve God they will certainly do exploit by God's grace because God is being be doing the work through them. Amen. Daniel heard the seven thunders. He heard the seven thunders but it was forbidden to him to write down about them. But there will be a bride that will hear the seven thunders. They will understand the seven thunders. They will obey the seven thunders. They will live by the seven thunders. They there is no other choice but to do great exploits through through them. I believe that with all my heart. It's not me doing it but God's doing the work through him. &gt;&gt; Amen. As Daniel heard the seven, the prophet say Ephesians church 8. As Daniel heard the seven thunders and forbidden and John heard the voices and his book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with seven seals. But in the days of these seals to be open, the mystery of God will be finished. In other words, God will be known to his church. &gt;&gt; God will be known to his church. Mean God will unveil himself to his church. We are so privileged to go to know God being unveiled. The mighty God unveiled before us. Amen. That's what privilege how privileged we are to know God and to know God in front and we continue to know him. But we know him better than the other ages. Why? Because he's preparing us for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthians 13 the Bible says I'll just read few parts he says charity never fail us whether there will be prophecies they shall fail whe there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge they shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when which is prophet is come that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as as a child. I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things mean at certain point we understand and we understand we know as a child but the more God is increasing the more we start understanding and we know more as an adult and we are living in the age where we should be living as adult. Amen. Means we know but we know but the the knowledge that we have is not only our heads knowledge but is know that need to be mixed with God's love because knowledge without love it just makes you like and know it all but when you know with the love of God amen you know the love of God in you then he makes that love that knowledge you have to put it into practice through life it's not only a head knowledge it becomes a life knowledge. Amen. &gt;&gt; As I said before, so as we go into it, our desire believe is still Lord, I want to know you more because to do great exploit is to know to stand for the right purpose. Even in the midst of trials, still say, God, you're in control of every situation. I trust you. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it will end up, but I just trust you, Lord, that you'll make everything right &gt;&gt; because I know that you'll never lie. As the prophet says, if you have the real knowledge of God, you know that God cannot lie. No matter how time it takes, no matter the difficulties, but you know that God can never lie. &gt;&gt; God will make his word to come to pass. And I should stand on that and say, God, you are faithful. God, your word can never fail. God, you can never lie. The heaven and earth will pass away, but your word will stand, Lord. That's where I'm standing. And if I stand that, God will come and back up his own word through you. Amen. And you will see the great exploit, the great things, the great miracles, the great things that God will do because God can never fail. He has never failed one of his promises. And he won't fail that in your life either. Amen. So keep pressing on. Keep pressing on. God, you are in control over these situations. How do I know? Because your word says so. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that give me that perfect knowledge of knowing that God your word can never fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice this great masterpiece of the family. Say the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one. They have to be. If they are not, they are not a good family. Wife pulling one way, the husband another. They will make a noful family. But in agreement with love one to another, there is that a family. Now that was God's masterpiece. Now all the true family all now all true all the true family here portrays that. Now the masterpiece family has come again. Christ and his bride ready to come. The second Adam, second Eve now ready to return back to their home. The whole picture has been redemption for what it was. Bring it back. See just exactly bring it back again. What I want to say with that is say God as we go to our special meetings and I want this to be a prayer as well for the special meetings. God I desire to see that masterpiece family &gt;&gt; because between you Christ and the bride and me personally not only the full church but myself personally I want to see that masterpiece that union. What you want that what I desire to do what what you want becomes my desire. Your desire is my first desire as well Lord. That's what I desire. but also in our families. Lord, we desire to portray that true relationship that you have with the bride that the good husband will love his wife. The wife respect the husband, the children love one another, love their father and the father respects them and the mother respect them. Is that the desire of your heart? &gt;&gt; I believe God will fulfill his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Musicians can come and just record the word of God. It's a prayer. I will cast all my cares upon you. If you don't know that you can sing, [Music] I cast all my care upon you. [Music] I lay all my burdens down at your feet. And anytime I don't know just what to do, but I will cast all my cares upon you. I cast all my cares upon you. I lay all my burdens [Music] down at your feet.

Hello everyone. Um I have two prayer requests. one on for me and then one on behalf of one of my brothers. For my brother, he has not been working for about two years now and it's starting to really get to him. We're here visiting our family, but we're in Ontario and Ontario right now with the jobs, it's not it. So, if we can just pray for him to get a job, he's been using a lot of like defeist language like, "Oh, maybe I'm cursed. Maybe the law." So, I think it's deeper than a job. I think it's character and like the language that he uses. And for me, like I said, we're visiting our family, but I moved in Ontario with some of my siblings. We live in a Christian neighborhood and there's a whole bunch of churches that I just don't believe have the truth. And I don't believe that they fear God. And I'm praying for a church that fears the Lord and that my family can go there and we have the community that we need. Amen. God bless you, man. Amen. Amen. God bless you, Saint. This morning when I woke up, I was getting ready to uh start off to go to work, but I noticed that I had like hard time breathing. So, I called someone that morning. And then I just told her that, "No, can you sister can you pray for me cuz I'm about to go to work, but I feel like something is choking my throat and I can't breathe." So after she prayed, God healed me and I can testify that he has healed me. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Thank you for all the testimonies. Thank you mama. Thank you brother Goshan. Thank my dear sister the request. God is working. God is doing. And I I like the the way it is you know when you're in need. We are one body. So if you're in need, call someone else and pray together. God works. The life is through the body. Amen. So keep keep doing that. Thank God for that. And God is working. We love we appreciate the Lord and thank God for that. Thank you. Can go in prayer. Give us one one chorus of one song. Then you can sing. Which song are you singing? &gt;&gt; Which one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm waiting for the words. We are one. We are one. We are hes of the father. We are joint hes with the son.
