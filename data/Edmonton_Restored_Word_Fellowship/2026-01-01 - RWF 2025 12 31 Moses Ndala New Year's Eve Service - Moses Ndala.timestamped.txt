[0:27] God bless you, Saints. It's good to be back in the house of the Lord.

[3:50] I'm just going to ask you to read this. uh uh Psalms together. Let's just read
[3:57] it in unison. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say,
[4:05] if it had not been the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us,
[4:12] then they had swallowed us up quick. When their wrath was kindled against us,
[4:18] then the waters had overwhelmed us. The stream had gone over our soul. Then the proud of water
[4:26] had gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord who hath not given us unto pray to the truth.
[4:37] Our soul is escaped. Our help is the in the name of the Lord who made heavens and the earth. Amen.
[4:49] So if it was not for the Lord who kept us throughout the year,
[4:52] the enemies would have swallowed us. The waters would have overwhelmed us,
[4:56] but the Lord has been with us throughout the year. And we just have to thank him
[5:00] for that. If it had not been for the Lord. Amen. Going to sing the goodness of God.

[1:08:29] one nation to another from one kingdom to another people. He permitted no one to do them wrong. Yes,
[1:08:37] he rebuked kings for their sakes, saying, "Do not touch my anointed ones and do not
[1:08:44] and do my prophets no arms." Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. And you can seated.
[1:08:57] May the Lord be praised forever and ever.
[1:09:04] We are so happy to be in the house of the Lord.
[1:09:12] We are thankful for the time that God has granted to us, rented to us
[1:09:26] since the beginning of the year. In few minutes we're gonna say
[1:09:30] we're going to call 2025 as the year the last part
[1:09:40] that year had a lot of events.
[1:09:47] It may be happy moment or evil event moment. But there were a lot of things that happened.
[1:09:55] Many events it went forth before us in our families [Music] in different countries
[1:10:11] because we are people are coming from uh different countries here.
[1:10:16] Some comes from Zimbabwe. Some from Ghana, some from Nigeria,
[1:10:24] some from Congo, some from Rwanda, some from Burundi, from some from Kenya,
[1:10:38] Canada, some from Canada, some from the United States,
[1:10:47] We are a special nation. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:52] A special nation.
[1:10:56] Washed in the blood of Emmanuel.
[1:11:02] The blood of the lamb. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[1:11:07] why we can gather here. [Music] That's why we can have fellowship together.
[1:11:18] We can uh drink from the same cup from the same cup [Music] without being worried
[1:11:31] without saying that my sister will give me a an
[1:11:34] illness or or my brother will contaminate me. We are drinking from the same cup.
[1:11:44] from the same blood of Emmanuel,
[1:11:50] the blood that washes away every iniquities.
[1:12:00] The the the blood that washes us from uh sins and every kind of uh illnesses.
[1:12:10] You know the Lord Jesus Christ had had the double mission on the cross. Yes. A double mission.
[1:12:20] First of all, he saved my soul. He's a savior.
[1:12:27] He sanctified and uh purified my life. Your life. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:36] We were people that were unloved by a God, a living God, the creator of the heavens and the
[1:12:45] earth. He who created what we see, what we touch, and the things that we cannot touch,
[1:12:56] the visible and invisible ones are here on earth and in heaven.
[1:13:06] every creator was created by his word. The way that we just came
[1:13:10] out will relate. It's the same word that created is the same word that created me
[1:13:17] that created all the universe and all the cosmic systems. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:25] How can we praise that God? How can we praise him? [Music]
[1:13:34] We don't have words to glorify him
[1:13:42] or we don't have suitable weights.
[1:13:50] That may help us when we are about to worship him.
[1:13:56] But at the end of it all, we can just say may may
[1:13:59] his name be praised forever. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:08] I have a little testimony.
[1:14:20] preached by brother Brham.
[1:14:25] He called it respect.
[1:14:32] It draw it drew my attention.
[1:14:38] And I said to myself, why can't I just share with my brothers and sisters respect? Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:14:47] respect to the servants of God, respect to the word of God,
[1:14:57] uh respect to divine instructions.
[1:15:02] God has given us instruction.
[1:15:07] A a child a child uh a child who has been given instruction by his
[1:15:19] and if he doesn't respect the the same way that his parent has taught him
[1:15:27] that child will be punished by his parents because a child who is loved by his parents
[1:15:36] is instructed head or taught by his parents and if he doesn't respect
[1:15:40] the instruction and the father can punish him.
[1:15:48] Chastisement is doesn't mean that the parent doesn't love the child. No,
[1:15:54] but a parent who love his child will uh punish him.
[1:16:01] If it disobey to any of of the instructions, you'll be punished
[1:16:06] by the word. [Music] And the parent cannot be I can not feel bad when he punishes his child.
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:32] And and the child cannot have uh hunger issues toward his parents. When a parent
[1:16:40] is trying to uh put him in the war [Music] and the prophet uh he preached respect
[1:16:57] In this preaching respect,
[1:17:10] in the uh uh verse 15 of Psalms 105, he said,
[1:17:17] "Touch not my anointed and do not do my prophets no harm.
[1:17:32] you know the uh children of God.
[1:17:36] I respect the people who comes here to preach us.
[1:17:40] I pray Lord for them because you know brothers and sisters
[1:17:48] this place is not the place of everyone
[1:17:53] because there the way I see you here.
[1:18:02] You've seen the little angels that just came to sing for us here.
[1:18:09] This the way the the way the these children were worshiping
[1:18:16] it's a different way when we worship the Lord they don't have a lot of struggles in
[1:18:23] their life they are heavenly creatures and when they come to worship here they those
[1:18:32] songs comes from their heart they come deep from their s and they give unto the Lord God.
[1:18:59] What they offer to the Lord
[1:19:05] is the best of those children.
[1:19:12] They don't have a lot of confusion. Dad brings them here. Mom brings them and mom says, "Come,
[1:19:20] we will worship the Lord. And when they come here, enter here. Dad said in that place is
[1:19:28] a holy place. It's a holy place. You can speak. You can do any anything that you
[1:19:36] like. You cannot play there. It's a holy place where there we are going to to hear
[1:19:44] the creature the creator to to hear from the Lord who created us in his own image.
[1:19:58] The gospel of the children start from their homes
[1:20:04] by the one who showed him how to
[1:20:11] taught him how to walk. The first step
[1:20:17] uh the first teaching comes from the fifth gospel. The gospel that is not
[1:20:23] written in the Bible, brother Bam says, our mothers, our sisters, our aunties,
[1:20:36] they are the ones that have the gospel. Amen.
[1:20:43] The mom that you see, the sister that you see,
[1:20:52] to how to walk. Thou helped you to walk, teaching you how to walk. He taught you how to eat.
[1:21:10] She taught you how to go use the washroom. She It's her how we should respect our mothers.
[1:21:23] how we should respect our mothers who
[1:21:25] birthed us. Respect the Lord God respects. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:38] Those when they will grow up, [Music]
[1:21:46] I will uh give advice to the young uh young kids.
[1:21:57] [Music] They cannot sing in the house and read the word. Are they
[1:22:05] going to understand the word or what? No. No.
[1:22:12] We are witnesses. We are witnesses.
[1:22:20] How children learns fast. They teach even the uh the the parents

[1:22:37] please? Rema, can you stand please? Please.
[1:22:45] They are married already. My my daughters. You can you can sit.
[1:22:59] When we ran war in our in my country in Congo and went to Nairobi, Kenya, Rama was not yet born.
[1:23:14] Uh Matendo had Esther on her back
[1:23:21] and
[1:23:28] And Mama Matendo was about to uh give birth.
[1:23:40] on her back
[1:23:46] and she ran from another direction where I wasn't with them.
[1:23:52] Can you imagine?
[1:23:56] Uh my son Ammani was 5 years old in
[1:24:06] because they were throwing bombs everywhere. She was carrying holding a a money at her
[1:24:13] hand when she was carrying a holding holding a money on her hand and then Esther on her back
[1:24:24] in the b in the womb. Can you imagine? She was alone.
[1:24:32] They did 200 kilometers by foot in the forest.
[1:24:42] Nothing to eat, nothing like no water, nothing to eat.
[1:24:52] But when we were in Kenya,
[1:24:57] I was I had already received the message of the Lord and my wife
[1:25:03] was also a believer. And when we reached there in Kenya, [Music]
[1:25:16] 29 April 19th April
[1:25:28] 97 uh 1997.
[1:25:36] She was born in Kenya.
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:44] She had never listened to any song in or French.
[1:25:51] We taught them how to pray.
[1:25:58] At least Esther 3 years old, she could a man five years old could understand.
[1:26:12] We taught them how to pray to glorify the Lord and seek the Lord's face.
[1:26:21] We have a song book called uh the songs of worship songs for salvation.
[1:26:30] I could sing those songs with my wife before
[1:26:32] praying till today. It's Rama who's teaching us those songs.
[1:26:41] Rama, she's the one teaching us those things. I don't know where
[1:26:46] which university she went to. She's the one teaching us. She was born in Kenya. It's a
[1:26:54] little It was just a testimony. You are you just got married. You have children.
[1:27:08] Keep keep doing altar or family prayers at home. It helps a lot. The children there.
[1:27:21] I can give a testimony. When we came here,
[1:27:29] divine grace and they were babies like uh children
[1:27:36] of uh brother Andrew. They are now young ladies. [Music]
[1:27:44] If we had a lot of young men, we could say, "Oh, we we have sisters here."
[1:27:53] uh the then they're they're ready. It doesn't take long.
[1:28:01] Can you imagine how mama Mary she she brought the these children to church today.
[1:28:15] She's amongst the vessels of the church. She's doing
[1:28:22] when you are hearing sound system it's sister Shakina was doing that work she
[1:28:30] has a position in the mystery body of Jesus Christ uh sister
[1:28:38] Grace sings for us and sister divine plays piano
[1:28:47] the uh divine gift is it's here to save us all.
[1:28:56] Brother Frana,
[1:29:00] those little children, those little kids,
[1:29:06] those Sunday school kids, don't worry. [Music]
[1:29:11] What we are giving them here that is what will make the great church of small [Music]
[1:29:25] [Music] is what will make that the gospel of the lord Jesus Christ be
[1:29:28] preached in the uh uh routes of uh mountain. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:29:36] We are teaching them to respect the servants of God. We are teaching them to respect the
[1:29:44] prophets of God. We are teaching them to respect the message of the hour. We are teaching them
[1:29:57] that they have to respect the word of God.
[1:30:03] We need to be strict teaching them that don't play
[1:30:06] with the words. If we are living today, it's because of this word.
[1:30:12] All the governments of the world. If they're still living, it's because of your prayers.
[1:30:24] It's because of the prayers of the bride of Jesus Christ. Do not be uh
[1:30:34] All the organization of the world and economic uh ecclesic churches
[1:30:42] they are not we are still on our knees we are still talking to the to our God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:30:55] Brothers and sisters
[1:31:05] We have a lot of good things that we can share together.
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:18] It's the Lord God who sent him to us in the 20th century. The Lord, the Lord God,
[1:31:26] he loves us so much. And we can say, I always tell my children, can you imagine in this world?
[1:31:40] We have a secret that other people do not know, do not have. When Esther had six years a
[1:31:51] primary school, she came to say, "Dad,
[1:31:57] I've seen other little children uh girls wearing pants.
[1:32:06] If she was uh going in a Catholic church, I I told those little girls that no, it's not
[1:32:12] good." But they did not understand. [Music] Can you give me a scripture that says that
[1:32:23] I I went and searched and gave that little uh secret I gave it to Esther
[1:32:33] this chapter this verse you can explain to them they will understand.
[1:32:45] Do you think they are listening and taking are listening very well to the
[1:32:49] word of God when they come to church? I did psychology psychology says that
[1:33:02] a a mother who is pregnant, you are able to speak to that child.
[1:33:10] If you sing to that child, you sing and she will listen. She's in the womb. If
[1:33:16] you pray, you pray for her, she will listen. Uh do you understand? Yes.
[1:33:30] It's not for nothing that the the prophet says that you are fifth gospel.
[1:33:37] The Bible says there gospel of John, Mark, Matthew and Luke. [Music] Those are the four
[1:33:50] gospel that we learn in denominations. We went to children of Catholic.
[1:34:01] Brother Brham was not here when he came.
[1:34:08] He preached the a message of the hour. And in the message of the
[1:34:12] I said a a woman a sister filled with the Holy Ghost she's a fifth gospel.
[1:34:24] I believed to that
[1:34:28] because I know that he's the messenger of the young
[1:34:33] just like Moses was the messenger of Israel [Music] uh the the one
[1:34:42] who could not accept the message of Moses to the un to the people they
[1:34:48] they they all died pagans they will never go to heaven. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:34:58] The people who did not believe the message of Noah,
[1:35:02] they were uh they were destroyed by waters. Yes. It's it's it's correct.
[1:35:14] We have to understand that in every age God sends his
[1:35:16] children. God sends a messenger with a message.
[1:35:25] And when you receive the message and the message,
[1:35:30] the reward that God will give to the messenger, you will have accepted the
[1:35:35] messenger and the message. You will receive the same rewards. Amen. You will receive the same
[1:35:44] reward. Hallelujah. Amen. Brothers and sisters, we have something to do. And what we have to do,
[1:35:58] you know, Peter, Andrew, Nathaniel, and all those people during their time,
[1:36:11] they were waiting for a Messiah. And their parents were speaking about Messiah.
[1:36:21] When their parents were talking about Messiah,
[1:36:26] One day it happened that
[1:36:30] uh the father of brother Peter especially the brother [Music]
[1:36:41] uh the the the father of brother Peter is the one who taught him how to fish
[1:36:48] every time he could speak to him about the becoming Messiah. Andrew was receiving the
[1:36:53] same teaching. Nathaniel was receiving the same teaching
[1:37:03] because uh during that time every universe was under Roman Empire
[1:37:12] and the Romans were taking everyone as their slaves. [Music]
[1:37:23] there all the people of God were under the Romans yoke. They they were saying
[1:37:32] we cannot keep we cannot continue continue being uh stepped on.
[1:37:40] Our parents taught us that there will be a coming Messiah to deliver to set us free.
[1:37:52] And when God sent the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:58] and when the Lord met Peter uh on the sea
[1:38:06] he was fishing for the whole night and he didn't even catch any little fish.
[1:38:26] the the Lord was so merful to him and Peter explained the whole situation to him that I've
[1:38:31] been fishing but I didn't catch anything just take your nest and cast it in the sea on the sea and
[1:38:41] he replied that master Since my my my my birth, I've been fishing. It's morning. I can't catch
[1:38:51] anything. But at thy word, I'll do it. And cast he casted the the nets and caught a lot of fish.
[1:39:05] And Peter said to himself, "Who is this person?"
[1:39:12] things like this.
[1:39:16] Maybe he's a messenger, a prophet.
[1:39:21] Maybe he's the one who we've been waiting. Why? Why? By his word, he can create these things.
[1:39:31] I I I see that he's a special person. But
[1:39:40] uh days went by.
[1:39:49] They they they went and told Nathan that that person is talking about our life.
[1:39:54] Nathan went and then and you he had doubt in his heart. He was doubting [Music] when
[1:40:04] he came forth before Jesus said look at this Israelite who doesn't have any
[1:40:13] problem he doesn't have any sins in in himself he's correct
[1:40:20] said
[1:40:26] he told him his name and Everything
[1:40:33] said
[1:40:37] a person who can descend the thoughts of a man is not is he not a messiah. Brothers and sisters,
[1:40:45] brother Brham came. The spirit of God was upon him. He was descending the spirit of men.
[1:40:58] second pool and the third pool and he did those experience there
[1:41:07] and we discovered that God was with us just like that's just like he lived in
[1:41:15] the 20th century God in his fullness he lived in the prophets. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:41:30] We we are duty bound to teach our children the respect of the word
[1:41:36] of God and the respect of the servants of God.
[1:41:44] We don't have enough time
[1:41:58] I'm not even one of what I'm trying
[1:42:08] because there are some who are going to push towards you need to be
[1:42:20] even the respect of the respect the respect of circumstances. We need to stop. We have to stop.
[1:42:41] We have Mariam, the sister of Moses. Oh my god.
[1:42:50] Her and Aaron the sacrif based
[1:42:55] on evil about Moses the prophet and God strike them with leprosy.
[1:43:02] God said [Music] when Mariam was strike by leprosy
[1:43:13] because Aaron had a limit of God. [Music] When you see a pastor, the pastor there,
[1:43:22] don't speak evil about him. When you are with your kids, don't don't even try to
[1:43:29] speak evil of the children of God. Maybe you can go and confess to him and God will forgive you.
[1:43:46] How can your children listen to you speaking of your servants and
[1:43:52] the child starts speaking of the servant of God?
[1:44:02] The child doesn't have that descentment to say I must go and ask for forgiveness. Do you not
[1:44:08] see that it's a criminal act? You've spoken evil about uh evil of the servant of God and
[1:44:16] the your children are commenting as well. Evil about the servant of God. It means that you've
[1:44:24] killed your own child. You are killing your child spiritually. It would have been better
[1:44:34] to give uh good testimonies. If you don't have any good things to say on behalf of your brother,
[1:44:41] of your brother, just stay quiet. Don't don't say anything at all. It's good to stay quiet shut
[1:44:53] because you might you may kill your own child spiritually speaking.
[1:45:10] [Music]
[1:45:11] Miam. She's the one who who helped. She's the one who who placed the basket of on the sea
[1:45:25] and they led that basket towards the sister of the daughter of Pharaoh.
[1:45:33] And the Moses grew up in the royal kingdom of Pharaoh. He
[1:45:38] was kept very well. He went to school. He went to universities. He was uh fed
[1:45:50] the stop there that daughter of Pharaoh
[1:45:57] [Music] and gave scholarship gave to the mother of Moses to
[1:46:10] he was uh how do you say like paying a fee to feed Moses his child.
[1:46:20] God is wonderful. When he calls someone, he equips him, keeps him and takes care of him.
[1:46:31] That's why every servants of God. [Music] They are
[1:46:37] extraordinary people. [Music] The word of God says, "Don't touch my anointed ones.
[1:46:44] Don't touch my hand of a servant of God. Uh he can be of the message.
[1:46:56] Don't don't speak evil.
[1:47:03] Don't look at those small those who are speaking
[1:47:06] of brother speaking evil. Don't don't read those stuff.
[1:47:17] May the Lord God bless you all.
[1:47:27] I've uh reached at the end of my 30 minutes that was
[1:47:34] I would have given you a lot of examples able disobeyed
[1:47:44] He was not respectful to uh uh Elisha the prophet.
[1:47:53] Elijah was his prophet and pastor of that time. Jezebel didn't respect her respect him
[1:48:05] and dogs uh drank his his blood. What? Yes. respect because she
[1:48:13] didn't respect the servant servants of God and didn't respect the instruction of God
[1:48:21] is to you up to you to me to take these advices.
[1:48:31] We are we are duty bound to respect all the servants of God,
[1:48:35] the word of God, the message of our time
[1:48:45] and let teach our children to respect the word of God and respect
[1:48:53] and everything that God has given to him. May the Lord God bless you. Amen.
[1:49:26] May God bless you. We'll continue. I'll just sing couple of songs.
[1:49:54] Um we just continue program but um just want to to back up what
[1:50:00] Papa Matendo said here. It's just it was just very good. Did you like it?
[1:50:08] I I I kind I I really like it. Uh I just I just like it. May God bless you richly.
[1:50:16] um not necessarily because um because the preacher I respect the preacher
[1:50:22] but not necessarily because of that but although it's part of the word of God and
[1:50:28] um but I just want to say it's one of the messages every time I listen to it
[1:50:35] I say Lord forgive me every single time because it's very easy to make a comment
[1:50:45] very easy to make a comment. You just see something that doesn't agree with you and
[1:50:50] then quick you share that with someone. As long as stays with you, you don't feel happy. You you
[1:50:56] you feel good when you share it with someone else. Then you feel good and and and very often and then
[1:51:06] sometimes I share with my wife too like something is frustrating me and then and I share with her
[1:51:14] Then after that I feel content. She doesn't even have to do anything about it to be honest. She has
[1:51:22] no authority. She just hear it and and it bothers her. That gives her more trouble. But but why do
[1:51:30] I do that? Oh Lord, forgive me. Forgive me. But um it's good that a deacon can remind us about
[1:51:40] that good principle. Stephen was was was was a deacon, but he left one great testimony. Even Paul
[1:51:49] was still remembering what the deacon said. So we should not neglect what the deacons have told us
[1:51:57] this evening. Lord, help me. Help me to be more respectful. If there is a tomorrow, if there is
[1:52:04] a next year, Lord, help me to be more respectful. help me to respect my parents, respect my mother,
[1:52:12] respect my father, to respect just to be respectful. Amen. Can I just take a little moment
[1:52:20] and then we just just bow our head and just pray and I'm going to say that in terms of myself but
[1:52:26] also in term of the church it's got to be merciful for anything we have said that was not this place
[1:52:33] at the right at the right place but the Lord Jesus Christ we humbly we just want to say Lord
[1:52:41] thank you first of all for the word of God that we have heard for reminding us father Lord Jesus
[1:52:50] the instructions and what you say as the prophet says in that message many times God
[1:52:57] demands respect God demands respect doesn't doesn't matter on how the person looks how
[1:53:06] the person talks sometimes even how they make how they make their mistakes it's not up to us
[1:53:12] to criticize it's not up to us to neglect it for us Father forgive me. Forgive me. How many times
[1:53:21] Father Lord I failed. The Holy Spirit has rebuked me many times upon that. Father Lord on behalf of
[1:53:28] the church on behalf of father all of us Lord we come before you recognizing that we have failed
[1:53:35] many times that principle but help us father lord help us to stand up lord to keep that no mind that
[1:53:43] we have to be respectful especially it has been brought to our attention this evening lord for our
[1:53:49] children for the church of tomorrow help us Lord to be respectful to the word of god to give them
[1:53:56] the right instruction instructions from early age, Father, to be respectful in the church, to respect
[1:54:01] the church order, Father, to love the message, Father, not to be respectful to one another,
[1:54:07] Lord. Help us, Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you. We appreciate what you have spoken to our heart,
[1:54:13] Lord. Now, Lord, we agree your word and we just want to humble before you and and say, Father,
[1:54:20] help us, Lord, in my in our humanity. Help us to walk with you in a closer walk with you,
[1:54:25] Father. That our love towards you will be greater, will be more, oh God, manifested as we expressed
[1:54:33] it to you, Father. We give you the glory in the honor. In Jesus Christ name we pray. Be with us
[1:54:38] for the remand of the service. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. One good testimony
[1:54:46] though as I not to brag but from my testimony as I as I grew up I've I as far as I know as far as
[1:54:56] I know I've never never criticized my pastor to another person like as I boser brother pastor
[1:55:08] pastor Herald no one can tell me in the church to say okay brother Moses criticize pastor
[1:55:14] held on this this this never as far as I was in brother Ed never criticize brother
[1:55:20] Ed to another person never that's something I take so dear that I I would never criticize a
[1:55:27] pastor to another person amen and and and and may that be also a testament amen so
[1:55:38] we grow Lord help me help me I might not agree on certain things and why did I see maybe but
[1:55:45] to another person in the church I as far as I'm aware I I've never done that to another person.
[1:55:51] May God be with us. Amen. Can we just sing the love of God? I'll ask you to stand with me.
[1:56:00] The love of God.
[1:56:04] He's greater
[1:56:08] than

[2:24:50] Thank you Jesus.
[2:24:54] Read Psalm 105. Initially I was scheduled to preach. I was thinking that I'll be preaching
[2:25:01] and my theme for this evening was Psalm 105 from 1 to 5. Oh,
[2:25:09] give thanks unto the Lord. Call upon his name. Make known his deeds among
[2:25:14] the people. Don't keep it for yourself. Make it known unto the people that our God is good.
[2:25:25] Sing unto him. Sing psalm unto him. Talk ye of all his wondrous works because he has done
[2:25:32] so wonderful works in our lives. Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of them
[2:25:38] rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his face ever more.
[2:25:45] remember his one marvelous works that he had done his wonders and the judgment of his mouth.
[2:25:52] That's what we are here for to remember the wonderful works of God in our lives
[2:25:58] and we praise him. Amen. Want to appreciate brother Andrew. Brother Andrew is it okay if
[2:26:03] I call you for a few words be fine. Appreciate brother Andrew is a I call him my right hand.
[2:26:13] Um, when he's not in church, I I I'm sorry to say I I I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I I know we don't
[2:26:22] depend on men, but I I feel a little bit nervous. So, I I just want to give him an opportunity to
[2:26:28] say a few words. He's a man of few words. So, whatever he just say, I just want to give him
[2:26:33] a little bit of honor and and appreciate him, my appreciation for him to say a few words.
[2:26:45] I don't know how few words these are going to be,
[2:26:47] but we'll we'll see. There's a scripture I did want to read. Philippians 2 1-5. And it says,
[2:27:04] "If there if there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love,
[2:27:11] if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy,
[2:27:16] that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind,
[2:27:22] let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in lon of mind. Let each esteem
[2:27:28] other better than themselves. Look not every man on on his own things, but every man also on the
[2:27:35] things of others. Let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus. You have your seats.
[2:27:49] I'm not going to speak on behalf of the pastor, but Uh I only want to talk about
[2:27:59] what what I I can observe. I guess uh and it says I see see the intent of his
[2:28:08] heart in his actions and his willingness and his devotion. He wants this church
[2:28:13] to thrive to grow to increase but not in vain glory in true love and faithfulness
[2:28:18] in adoration to the Lord strengthened in in one another. He wants this church
[2:28:29] ruled by the spirit and that's also my desire.
[2:28:36] This is maybe kind of a little admonishment but I'm not here
[2:28:47] I'm not a preacher or a pastor. This is just something that's been on my heart having
[2:28:53] observed and experienced the derision and Satan that Satan tries to put seed amongst brethren.
[2:29:04] Um I've seen and heard how how churches have split, how people have left claiming
[2:29:10] faith but missed devotion and brotherly love where the Lord has not had his way.
[2:29:20] If if you have questions, concerns, doubts in one another, the pastor, bring it before the Lord
[2:29:26] first. Pray, seek. Don't be hasty. If we cannot resolve problems prayerfully, biblically in our
[2:29:34] own church. How are we fit to rule, govern with authority, in subjection to Christ on his throne?
[2:29:45] Is this okay? These are I'm not preaching to anyone. These are my
[2:29:50] thoughts in my heart for me. And if that's I guess that's just me bearing my heart,
[2:29:55] but pay your tithe. Tithe tithes give authority in trust. I'm going to say that
[2:30:03] again. Tithe gives authority and trust. You're giving authority to trust somebody. Tithing
[2:30:12] tithing states that you are vested in the local church, not just a global church. You can
[2:30:17] your money anywhere over the world, but you're not vested in somewhere. You're not allowing
[2:30:21] someone to have authority over you. Come to communion. Communion is affirmation of salvation.
[2:30:32] Acceptance that the blood applied is enough. When we apply the blood to the doorpost,
[2:30:41] where we apply blood to the doorpost, we worry when brothers and sisters don't Not because we're
[2:30:48] worried that they're they're secret sinners. We're worried that they're they don't have the
[2:30:52] blood applied that they're we want them to be to be saved. We want them to have fellowship
[2:30:59] with us. I want to see you here. I want to see you worshiping the Lord, not having condemnation, not
[2:31:04] having self-doubt. We we want you here. And it's this isn't a condemnation. This is an invitation.
[2:31:18] It's a It's a symbol of Passover, expressing that the blood on the doorpost is enough. And that's
[2:31:24] something that I realized like a couple years ago, maybe I just never thought about it, but
[2:31:30] the whole communion is is Passover. And that's how we apply the blood to the doorpost. If I was the
[2:31:36] one coming out of Egypt and I knew I had to have blood on that doorpost, I'd be out there every day
[2:31:41] up until the hour the death angel came hosing that doorpost in blood. And and that's what communion
[2:31:48] is. And you're coming not just for yourself, but for for your brethren. The last couple years,
[2:31:54] this church has been a little bit in a survival mode. We're wondering, praying, trusting. And
[2:32:00] the Lord heard the cry of our hearts. He heard our thoughts. what we were wondering. The church
[2:32:06] is growing. I believe the Lord is moving and don't let the devil get in here. Bind
[2:32:13] together. If if you have need, bring it before your brothers and sisters. If you have praise,
[2:32:19] bring it before the church. Aren't we co-airs with Christ? That makes us coairs with one another.
[2:32:25] We inherit the same thing. We're part of the same blood, part of the same everything. I'm inheriting
[2:32:30] heaven with you. And that that doesn't is an island on her own. I'm not making it without you.
[2:32:44] If I've spoken out of place for you, I and I trust if anything was misspoken will correct me. I just
[2:32:57] just want to take this time maybe to pray for brother Moses and his family and just come to the
[2:33:02] front and lay hands on just commit him to the Lord before the new year or as part of the new year
[2:33:14] the whole church
[2:33:28] You come up here.
[2:33:46] Lord, heavenly father, we come before you, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for Lord, for hearing our
[2:33:51] hearts, Lord, for Lord, for knowing our distress, Lord, for Lord, ministering to, Lord, our hearts,
[2:33:58] Lord. Lord for Lord for knowing the end from the beginning. Lord for Lord for pursuing us
[2:34:05] Lord more than we deserve. Lord for being an anchor Lord to weary hearts Lord to being a
[2:34:13] savior Lord for Lord the lost Lord. Lord Lord we're here to give you glory Lord. Lord and
[2:34:20] we're not asking for anything beyond what you've already provided for us Lord. We're asking, Lord,
[2:34:25] that you lead us, Lord, that you lead, Lord, our church, not just this church, but globally,
[2:34:29] Lord, your children, Lord, that we would abide in your word, Lord. Lord, that in all things,
[2:34:36] Lord, we would we'd be filled with your glory, Lord, filled with your presence,
[2:34:39] Lord, filled with your discernment, Lord, your grace, Lord, your mercy, Lord. Father,
[2:34:44] I bring brother Moses and his family, Lord, before you, Lord. We just we ask Lord that you lead them
[2:34:50] Lord that you comfort them Lord that you give them strength that you lead lead him Lord as a

[2:59:10] so in English says so the chorus says the victory is sure let us know how to rely on Jesus. He who
[2:59:20] made the promise will not fail to fulfill it. And the verse says, "Let us put on our armor and
[2:59:27] live as victors or conquerors, for the victory is sure. Let us fight the fight of faith and
[2:59:33] lay hold of eternal life to which we are called." Says, "Even we have to suffer,
[2:59:38] let us suffer as victors. Let us guard our hearts from complaint and murmuring. Let us believe in
[2:59:45] the power of his message as an invincible weapon. Then the crown lies at the hand.
[2:59:51] Let us work as victors or conquerors. Let us sow in confidence for one day we shall reap.
[2:59:58] Let each one place at the service of others the gift from God that he has received. Let us re
[3:00:06] rekindle rekindle rekind rekindle. Let us rekindle our zeal. Let us leave this message that unites
[3:00:13] our heart in love. Let us be united and strong and may sincere charity guide all our effort. That's a
[3:00:21] song and just give me a few minutes. Hopefully I can sing it. Try to play with the guitar.
