Introduction
In this end-of-year message, Brother Moses exhorts the church to carry a clear spiritual focus into the new year: “Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you” (James 4:8). Speaking plainly and pastorally, he emphasizes that a closer walk with God is not theory or emotion, but a lived relationship where God’s life is visibly expressed through believers.

Summary
Brother Moses begins by clarifying that no person seeks God on their own. God first draws us by grace, just as He sought Adam in the garden (Genesis 3:9). Our salvation—justification and forgiveness—comes entirely by God’s initiative, not by human effort (Ephesians 2:8–9). Brother Branham taught the same principle: Grace is what God has done for us, not what we can do for Him. However, Brother Moses stresses that salvation is not the end of God’s purpose. God saves us so that His own life may be expressed through us by the Holy Spirit.

Drawing from James 2:17–22, Brother Moses explains that true faith must be made visible through obedient living. Faith without works is dead, not because works save us, but because genuine faith naturally produces action. Brother Branham consistently taught that the “Token” today is the Holy Ghost—the very Life of Christ living openly in the believer, not hidden or private, but publicly displayed (Exodus 12:13; Acts 2:38). A Christian life that never manifests Christ’s character is falling short of God’s intention.

Brother Moses highlights that perfection in Scripture does not mean sinless flawlessness, but maturity and fullness (Hebrews 6:1). Like a seed growing into a tree, faith must grow into obedience. Abraham believed God, but his faith was proven mature when he acted upon God’s Word (Genesis 22:1–12). Likewise, Rahab’s faith became co...

There's been this week I think this [music] week or last week I was just thinking of another sister and went to India. We prayed for her. She was a she she was suffering and cancer almost a desperate situation but just came to my mind again to think about her. Lord, [music] would you just just remember and touch her?

And this morning we want to praise your name to glorify your name. Father, Lord Jesus Christ. We want to lift you up. Father, you said when you'll be lifted up, you'll draw men unto you, Father. And Lord, we give you the praise and we put you at the right position and we have the right mental attitude towards any promise of God. You'll make it come to fulfill to be fulfilled. Father, Lord, we are gathered here together, uniting our faith, Lord, for this the needs that has been brought us before before you Lord Jesus Christ.

Brother Nicholas, may you touch him, Father. May you restore him. May you, Father, Lord Jesus Christ, bring him closer to you. Father, you said you shall pray and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall restore them. If they have committed any sin, Father, shall be forgiven unto them, Father. Be merciful unto him, Lord Jesus Christ, as [music] we commit him to you, Father, and we send your word to him. And we draw, Father, strength from Calvary. May you, Father, come closer to you and draw his strength, Father, from El Shadai as we [music] commit him to you, Lord. Remember the sister, Lord, in India once again. Father, may you touch her. May you restore her, Father. Lord, distance is nothing [music] to you, Father. Lord Jesus Christ, Lord, you are the healer, you are the comforter, you are the restorer of strength. Father, we lift your name high. We thank you this morning because Father, Lord, we are trusting in your word. Your word, heaven and earth will pass away, but your word shall never pass away. Remember, brother Dale Washer, Father, oh God, a man of faith, man who's trusting you, never complains. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, may you touch him. May you restore him. May you father [music] fill him father with your strength over El Shadai. Oh God, you are still Jehovah Rafa, the God we left for all our sicknesses and all our diseases. Lord, if you heal yesterday, you can heal again today. Lord Jesus Christ, we commit ourselves to you. Remember brother Ed, Lord, may you touch him. May we restore him, Father. Oh God, you are still the same God. One more time, Lord. Lord, we commit him to you. We commit brother Ron Spencer to you, Father. Lord, you break the chains of the enemy. Satan is only a blast. Father, the victory has been already won on Calvary. By your stripes, we are already healed. You said healing, Father, is the bread of the children. We are your children this morning. And we are claiming the promise of Golgota. Thank you once again, Father. Remember brother Ray and his family, the Adrian family, Lord. God, for this sad news that father came, but Lord Jesus, you had a comforter. Nothing, Lord, is hard to you. And you know why it happened, Lord. You allowed it to happen. No father. May you rub your arms of love towards the family and comfort them Lord in this time. Lord we love you and appreciate [music] you. Remember us this morning. Remember the churches that that are gathered around the country, around the continent, Father, in this on today. Remember them, Father. We love you and appreciate you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Continue to pray for one another. We're living in a tremendous time. Just want to encourage us to pray for one another. Amen. Let's go to the Lord and to the reading of the word of God. Thank you musicians. As has been announced, many are traveling and um just want to keep praying for them. But the victor sent me a message this morning. He had some mechanical problem with his car and don't know if they managed to come but just want to pray for them as well whether they're streaming or maybe they're on the roads but just want to remember them as well. I hope you had a little bit of time with friends and family during the this week and uh continue again this week. that we have a gathering on the Wednesday, December the 31st at 6 and 6 sharp and 6:30 we start eating for those not heating eating start eating at 6:30 shop for the for the supper and then we have a quite a long night program for that night but 6:30 and then maybe 8:30 or 9:00 we might finish over there but we start around 9 and then those who can leave early we can leave a little bit early but those who want to stay and pray over over until good new year be welcome there'll be there'll be quite um planning some some some some time in the presence of the Lord just um singing and praising and praying and giving testimony with a word of exhortation but it won't be too much preaching but just encouragement for one another until the new year and uh so 6:30 if possible to be there to be not African time not not Indian time not South American time German time 6:30 German time so be there um I think that's all the I've had also announcement so We suggested to the to the church helpers to to to remember brother Phillip. Um brother Philillip is traveling to Portugal and suggesting to him if he can help us with with the office of a of a deacon and working together with Papa Matendo and um I reached out to him and he he mentioned that um God's grace I think he will take that and just keep him in prayer. So um I told him that I announce to the church and his absence. Um even if he was here I will announce it too but it turns out that he's absent. So just ask him permission to announce it even during his absence. So just keep that in prayer. So as the prophet has recommended us we will be doing that for for one year and how himself feels comfortable in that then we'll pray the other year if the lord terries for confirmation for that office. So just keep that in prayer and if anything just bring it up to our attention then we just pray about it. Amen. But uh he's a is a solid brother and a sister, his wife, solid sister and I've known them for for a couple of years now and a time of fellowship and everything. I know his attitude is always loving the message and encouraging people and all that and I believe that is going to be a blessing for this church and still looking for for a trustee and then also for a treasurer and a couple of brothers in mind just to reach out to them again during this week. Maybe we have confirmation on next next week, God willing. Um, beside that, we thank God for each and everyone. &gt;&gt; May God bless you all and we appreciate you all and I just thank you again for your your faithfulness and just loving the Lord and serving him. Amen. James chapter 4 and uh verse 8. This is the last service of the No, not the last service of the year but last Sunday of the year. Yes. So last Sunday of the year. So it's my honor and privilege to speak to you. But I felt drawn as last Sunday. A little bit of a little bit of a bridge was open last last Sunday. And I feel like I can continue the same line a little bit on there. And I just felt like I could speak on that and should just bear with me on this thought for a moment. But the Lord is in control. Amen. John James 4 verse 8. We can even start from verse 7 and then start from verse six. But he give us more grace. Wherefore he said, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded. May God bless his word. You can have a seat. And uh just want to bow our heads one more time as we just approach this word of God. Father we thank you once again. Father we just open the word of God as we have mentioned maybe for the last Sunday of the year. God we thank you for your grace in our life for the whole year. how you kept us, how you watched over us, Father. Lord, how you have blessed us with tremendous spiritual food in due season through many ministers. Father, many visitors who visited us, Lord, who spoke the word of truth and encouraged us and helped us, edified our our soul and helped our faith, Father. We thank you, Father, for that. We thank you for the local ministers. Thank for pastor Zigg Lord for the word of encouragement, little of exhortation. Thank you for pastor for for brother Victor Lord for the word and the preaching and the encouragement, the inspiration that you gave him. Father, we thank you for that Lord. We love you and appreciate you Lord. Sometimes in the special special meetings for the special needs and the prayer papender will take a thought and we share it father lord and encourage us father we thank you for that. Thank you father for brother God for brother goian for the youth meeting and as you you will inspire him father will speak and encourage us in our walk father we want want to say thank you father for all the gift and for all you are putting in the church in the body of Christ and we thank you thank you for the tape sometimes God the brother that brother Andrew would put at the beginning of the service and create the atmosphere and help us father lord We thank you, Father, for all that. And thank you for one another, for the body of Christ. We love you and appreciate you, Lord Jesus Christ. We just want to say thank you for this year. Thank you for how God, you have healed us from sicknesses and diseases. You have helped us, Lord, to stand. We failed many times, but you helped us, Lord, to stand and to keep moving. It's your grace, Father. You have given us grace, and we want to say thank you. Help us, Father, to continue forward. Blessed the bride this morning, Father, the heads of home, the mothers and the sisters and the brothers and the young one, Father. May you bless each and everyone. We love you, Lord. Give you the glory and the honor as we commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ. And we pray. Amen. I would like to talk to take a thought from uh verse 8 as I mentioned draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh unto you. It's um it's a it's a principle that I just want to build a little bit on that just to show um I want not hoping not to be too long but um just want to put that as a final thought maybe a thought that you can also carry in the new year there's a thing God God as a principle is if you draw nigh to him he will draw nigh unto you and he has blessed us many times and as I mentioned this year. But the new year, God wants to bless us more. And the key to that is if you draw nigh to him, he will draw nigh to you will bless you more. And as you draw nigh to him, God always draw God blesses the one who seeks him, the one who looks for him, God is going to bless him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't feel like I should go back and but I still I still spend time a little bit on that. It's always sometimes hard to go and talk a little bit on the on the way of the things that we have to do because it looks like we are going back again to the the works. We want to promote works um above above the faith or above our relationship or above love and no thanks. It doesn't look like that. But sometimes in our mind on our attitude we again what can I do? I kind of can never satisfy God by what I'm doing. and and we also feel um feel low, feel feel empty, we feel unsufficient and myself included, amen, all of us and we we can never satisfy God with our works and so it's always a little bit hard to go on that and I believe especially for the mature Christians but still the word of God and we have we have touched in many times and see oh grace and grace and works and faith and works and all that And especially we go back and then sometimes looks like contradictory and we go back and forth and and uh and it's it's still it's still a fight for the every minister sometimes to go back and forth and explain that. So this morning I just want want to say that um it's not maybe my focus this morning but still I'll touch on it just to put as a as a as a foundation. The fact that you are here is because God drew nigh unto you first. You were not looking for God. I was not looking for God. Is God was looking for you. It's God who called you. God who touched your heart. The prophet says it Adam was not looking for God. It's God was looking for Adam. It's always that way because man was running away from God. And our attitude is running away from God. And you feel feel guilty, you run away from God. It's always the natur natural attitude of a human being. But you know, but God if God put something inside of you, God has a way to draw you back to you, back to himself. He has a way, you know, it can be different way. It can be for advice. It can be through dreams. It can be through the word the word of God in the church. Can be through a paper, different way. But God has a way to draw you back. And he will because he can't lose you. If he's part of God, he can never never never lose you. Amen. So this God who's calling we we not call ourselves. So our calling is justification is what God has done. Amen. But remember as well as we go to our calling and justification is not the end of his purpose. God didn't just call you and justify you from all the sins and of past and say okay that's done. My work is done for you. No, God calls us because he has something he want to express through us. God called you. God called me because he want to express himself through you and through me. The purpose of God, he want to work through man. He want to work through human beings. He was not happy when he was just under on the dispensation of a father. That was not in good enough for him. It was good but that was not good enough. It was not even good enough as he went in the dispensation of a son sunship that was wonderful through him we have salvation but that was not good enough for God. God wants the third per the purpose of God a part of thought the third dispensation is God want to work through man. He want to work through me. He want to work through you. That's the goal of God. That's the last dispensation until we go in the rapture. God want to use you through the Holy Spirit. That's why I thank God what the God gave as as brother brother Victor. The inspiration is the the new birth is a must. The new birth is a must. That's what we study about the foundation is the new birth. Foundation is the new you must be born again. You must be filled with the Holy Spirit. But as you are filled with the Holy Spirit is the literal life of Jesus Christ. And God wants that life to be expressed people. And that life has to be expressed and we call it the literal life of Jesus Christ. Sometimes we call it the works of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes we call it perfection as well. Now perfection as you have received the Holy Ghost you have to grow until you come to the full maturity or you come to the full perfection. The prophet says in the token it says but in this glorious place under this covenant there is a difference between the blood and the life. The token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost. Not a blood, not a chemistry, but it is the Holy Spirit of God. It is the token that God requires of the church today. God must see the token. He must see it in every one of us. God is requiring a token. Without the token, you can't [snorts] have eternal life. Without the token, it's only judgment. So God is requiring the token. Is requiring the new birth. That's what he call the token. So therefore, the evening shadows as appearances, the wrath is ready to be poured out from on high upon the ungodly nations, upon the ungodly unbelievers, upon the professors without a possession, upon these things I've tried to unfold myself and leave right right among it to see where it was unsettling. Then he goes a little bit down there and just keeps on part. He says the animal life could not return back. Therefore, a blood had to be placed on the door, upon the lintils and upon the post of the door that every by pastor, the whole public, everybody coming by the house knew that there was a sign on that door, a blood that a life had died on that door. So as in the natural the light life of the animal when was that the animal was killed the blood was was spilled the blood was shed and that blood was a sign that was there was a life that is replacing the life of the unbelief of the believers right it is replacing the life of the believers and that life and that blood has to be put on the lentil it has to be public it has to be displayed it has to be visible amen so if we put in in a spiritual realm now no on our side as well. The life of Jesus Christ has to be visible. The life of Jesus Christ has to be public. People have to see that life as oh really that's the life of Jesus Christ. You can't live a hidden Christian life. It's impossible. That a hidden Christian life is not is not the fullness of the purpose of God. It has to be displayed. You can't be honest. I'm a believer in the heart. God just sees my heart. God looks on the heart. No. No. No. Yes, it looks on the heart but that what is the heart has to be manifest in the visible. Amen. Do you agree? It has to be manifest. If if it's not manifest in the visible then it's not to prove to any man but it's just yourself not God. What the life is inside has to become manifested otherwise something is wrong otherwise the token is not displayed. It has to be public and the prophet says that's the way it has to be with every believer today filled with the Holy Ghost. a token that shed the blood of the lamb. The that life that was in the lamb has returned back and is publicly sealed in there. That everybody passing by talking to you has an associate with you. Seeing that the blood has been applied that the token of life that was in that blood is upon you. You are safe from wrath that alone not membership. No sir. Amen. So the token has to be public. And then James here takes in chapter 29 says says and go further. I like I like James because is is one who has the anointing to be back on earth. Right? He didn't have only a legal anointing but also a a cow anointing or ox anointing. He was down on earth right looking and what the needs the the natural needs and looking at the natural say. know you can't just say you can't just say you can't say just say oh I have faith but it doesn't manifest in the works it has to be manifest in the works and James 2:19 says thou believeth that there is one God that thouast well the devil also believe and tremble so [snorts] they make putting a point you can't just say no I believe that's oh no you know God just look at my heart I believe I may believe all the message and then say oh yeah oh yeah believe all the word I believe all the Bible I believe all the message yes but if I deliver the message, it has to be displayed. And because the devil also believes, you know, the devil is a great believer of the message. He's a great believer of the message. He knows who Jesus Christ is. He identify Jesus Christ. The Pharisees could not identify Jesus Christ. The devil could identify Jesus Christ. SO, WHO ARE YOU son of one son, SON OF GOD? WHY ARE YOU coming to torment me? He he knew. He believed. He knew. He identified him. But the difference between that is what he believed. He could not apply it. The only thing that could apply was the Holy Spirit applying his own word in the life of the believer. And the devil knows brother Banam. He knew brother Banam. You listen to the tapes. Every time that brother Banham says upon the commission that you have given me upon the commission of the angel, I rebuke this enemy. He has to come out. And every child who has crossed eyes always get healed &gt;&gt; because he recognized he recognized the commission that was given to the prophet. It always came come to pass. How come? The devil knew it. He identified it. The devil knows you. The heavenly identifies you. He knows that you're a son of daughter of God. He knows it. Amen. So the devil can believe but he trumbles. The only difference is when it is the life that can be manifested, he can't manifest that. So James is constructed me or simple intellectual belief with living faith. The life, the faith, the true faith, the genuine faith has to grow and be manifested. The genuine faith, the genuine new baptism has to become manifested through action, true works. So is he arguing that the true faith produces works, not just the theology? We know what the prophet has talked about Romans 4 and James 4. Then he says, "No, no, God sees at the God sees in the heart when there is justification." But James was looking at what men look at. Amen. But in terms of adoption, I'll say this in terms of adoption, in terms of the adoption, in order to be adopted, the capstone I call it the adoption. In order to be adopted, God and man are looking at the same thing. God is looking at you are born again at the foundation of faith because faith real a new birth is a personal revelation to you is a faith to you but in order to come to the capstone God is looking at works he's looking at what the faith has to produce in the life of a being so all of that come together so man look at what you are living and God looking also at what you are living God cannot give you the key of his human is speaking he cannot give you the key of the of the or to you if he if he can't trust you, if your behavior is not correct, if you're not driving properly that oh I'm just a son of God, I can't take the key. No, no, no, no, no. Before he gives you the key, he has to trust you. Your behavior has to concord or to associate with what the word of God says. Amen. Do you agree with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. So in order for the adoption both God and man are looking at the same thing. Your son is praising you. The prophet we're talking if you look at the series of adoption says the Holy Spirit give a report to the father. Look at the how your son is behaving like you. He's praising like you. He's taking care of your business like you will do yourself. So he's look at the way he's dedicating. So you look at the place or look at the different things to show that it has an importance. James 2:22 as James continu say see that your faith wrought with his works and by works and by works was faith made perfect. I want us to to to to stay a little bit on the word perfect here. And then it says the scripture was fulfilled which said Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God. You see then how that by works a man is justified, not by faith only. Likewise also not Herab the hallowed justified by works as she had received the messenger and had sent them out another way. For as the as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead. Also when John when when James is mentioning that faith faith here wrote of his works, he's not saying that faith is useless. I don't think that what he's saying. I not saying that faith is useless and say faith is important faith is good faith that the starting point but that faith has to ro has to wrote with his works the word wrote in in Greeks is saying is actually saying is something that has to be that has to work together that that word that word wrought it means in English that has been translated in king James says is to work together is to help weave with or works together to work together to help in work to be partner in labor to put forth power together weave and thereby to assist. So faith and works has to work together. You can't just have faith without works. They have to work together. That faith has to work together with the works. Then it's coming to the completion. That works is made works was faith made perfect. In other words, faith is the starting point but it has to come to perfection. THAT FAITH TO come to perfect doesn't mean that that perfection word in the in the Greek word there it means it had to come to the fullness. You have to come to the maturity. The faith that is coming to the maturity is the faith that is obedient. Is the faith that has works is the faith that is obeying the word of God and putting the WORD OF GOD INTO ACTION. [clears throat] I believe I accept THE WORD OF GOD. [screaming] NOW I APPLY THE WORD OF GOD. YOU CAN'T JUST BELIEVE AND DON'T APPLY. YES. Then you you you believe which is VERY GOOD. THAT'S THE STARTING POINT. But you HAVE TO COME TO APPLY the word of God. AS YOU APPLY the word of God and God trust you and says, "Oh, now this is look how my son is doing. Look how my son is taking me at my word. He's putting my WORD IN ACTION." THEN YOU ARE BECOMING MATURE. AMEN. YOUR FAITH is becoming mature. Your f your faith IS BECOMING PERFECT. THINK about Drea. Reab was a believer. She believed the word of God. She's giving testimonies. We believe that God delivered you from Egypt. We believe that God was working with you. NOW EVEN GOD is going to give you THIS CITY JERICHO. GOD is going to give you EVERYBODY IS FEARING. GOD IS going to give you. SHE'S BELIEVER. SHE'S a believer. AND IN THE TIME of needs when the spies need to be hidden, then she went into action. IF SHE STAYED only by her testimony, IT WAS GOOD. But it WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. IT HAD TO COME INTO ACTION when she's hiding the spies. She's defending the spies. And then she can ask her ask them give me a true token. Give me an evidence because I have applied the word of God. I have believed and look at what I've done. I've put my faith into action to the point of RISKING MY OWN LIFE BECAUSE I BELIEVE SO MUCH THAT GOD IS WITH YOU. NOW THE SAME GOD IS WITH YOU. THAT SAME GOD can deliver me if you give me the true token. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm not trying to be legalistic. I'm just trying to put that point here together. Amen. And it's because it can be always sometimes a battle. Maybe it's not a battle for you, but sometimes a battle for the preacher. Amen. So perfect does not mean brought perfect does not mean that flawless, but perfect means brought to maturity or fullness like a seed growing into a tree. So perfect when the faith comes to perfection. In other words, God sees the faith comes to be expressed in works. Then God says, "My faith has brought to the end what I intended to do." When Abraham had the faith and James raised up, Abraham had the faith, but God had to ask him, Abraham, take your son, thy only son, and go and sacrificed him. And Abraham believed God that God could raise him up. And Abraham took the SON WITHOUT ANY DOUBT AND BROUGHT THE SON. THEN GOD SAID, "NOW ABRAHAM, I know that you believe." BUT GOD IS THE GOD WHO GAVE HIM THE FAITH. HE COULDN'T KNOW THAT he already believed. He knew that he believe. He knew that he had that faith. But now when it was put into action, THEN GOD HIMSELF TESTIFIES about it. Abraham, now I know that you believe and you love me beyond your own son. because of that I'm going to bless not only you but I will also bless your seed. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says in the same in the same message of the token says now watch full now now full now watch full now now fully obedience. I'm going just repeat what the prophet says. Now watch fully now fully obedience to the whole word of God entitles us to the token. Lord I desire the Holy Ghost. I desire the Holy Ghost. God gives US A KEY. THANK GOD FOR THAT KEY. Many people don't have that key. WE THANK GOD FOR HAVING THAT KEY. Full obedience to the word of God entitles you to the token. If you're obedient to the WORD OF GOD, [screaming] GOD IS OBLIGED TO give you the token. Amen. [clears throat] Because that IS OWN WORD. SO THAT IS JUST A GOD. I just want to obey your word. I want to fulfill your word. You will fill me with the Holy Ghost. So then when we pray when we pray and then when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayer. If you say I pray Lord but really I haven't well you don't just much as a well stop say go go go first and get the token. See because the token is what he will recognize. Yes sir. When we pray then we must present the token. Lord I have obeyed you fully. [snorts] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I have obeyed you fully. You can't THEN THEN THEN GOD when we are presenting the token, you can't just say God, I present to you the token, but my my my I'm I'm not obeying your word. I'm leaving your word aside, but I'm presenting to you the token. No, it doesn't work that way. Says, "No, Lord, I'm presenting you the token. I have obeyed your word fully." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God is obliged to his own word. I have repented of my sins. I feel that you have forgiven me. I I have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is upon me now. I have need of certain things for your glory. Lord, I ask for it. It's mine now. Then there is something anchors back there few and says it is yours. It's over. Then it's all over. It's all over. It's settled. I ask for the ask for it. I must have it. Oh, the strong language of the prophet using. I must have it. See, I want it for your glory. And see that it when he just give it to you now, you know it's yours. That's the way it is, children. So forth, we apply the blood, believe it. And what does it do that when you have can present the token with your prayer shows that you have fully come to the obedience to the whole word of God. When you've got the token, it shows that you have obeyed every word. Amen. Then you and the word are one. You're only asking for the thing that you are because you are asking for the thing that you are because you have obeyed the word of God. It says NOW ONE YOU KNOW IF I SAY UNTO you hand you obey me reach out for that hand coach if it does it. See the hand obeyed me. Why? It's part of me. When you you and the word becomes one every promise glory to God every promise is yours. It obeys you. Amen. Because you are part of the word of God. Then you want I think brother brother Victor touched it and then he put it so well. Then it obeys you then you want to watch what you want to do. You wouldn't put your hand in a fire just to say see me do it. No no no no no. Then there is something in that fire. I got to reach it. It will obey me. Amen. That's right. You want to watch what you are doing. That's the season the Holy Spirit sparingly give out and things and you know what I mean because you don't want to a real servant of God don't show off with it. You see the that's making a show when we pray we present the token. It shows we have fully obeyed the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that's my my that's my burden. It's my burden for myself. And actually I'm I'm kind of preaching to myself this morning. Lord, for this new year, I just want to draw nigh to you more than it has been last year. I just want to obey you more than I have done last year. I just want to give myself more than I have done last year. I don't want to stop. I don't I don't I I don't want to to to put a corner and say this is my this my area. I'm not moving. I'm not making anything. No Lord help. I want to go more because there's still more I can take from you. There's still more I can give to you also. So the prophet says don't just come thus far and say it's the same message talking. Don't just come thus far and say I believe the message. No, you obey the messenger. COME INTO CHRIST. You say, "Well, I believe every word said, brother Bam, they said that's good. But that just just being able to read, take the message, TAKE IT INTO YOUR HEART THAT YOU MUST HAVE THE TOKEN. The very life that was in Christ is new. When I see that, I'll pass over you. So don't just stay with a we don't I don't want to stay I don't want to stay just with a stamp that I'm a I'm a I'm a message believer, you know. I can argue. I can put quotes together. I can do. No, that that's that's good. THAT'S VERY GOOD. BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I want the life THAT IS THE MESSAGE. I WANT TO APPLY THE MESSAGE. I WANT TO LIVE the message. I want the MESSAGE TO BE SPEAKING WITHOUT ME SPEAKING. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE MANIFEST IN CHRIST. AMEN. IN THE WAY I TALK, IN THE WAY I THINK, IN THE WAY I SPEAK, IN MY DECISIONS, IN ALL THINGS. LORD, I WANT TO DRAW NIGH UNTO YOU, LORD. I WANT YOU TO BE MANIFEST IN MY LIFE. THAT'S MY BURDEN. THAT'S MY DESIRE. LORD, I WANT TO MOVE FURTHER THAN I HAVE DONE BEFORE. &gt;&gt; Because that the principle of growing. Growing is to draw is have that desire to draw n to go to God. You might say, "How can I draw n to God? How can I draw unto God?" Just start by obedience. Obedience entitles you to the token. Start by obedience. Amen. It's amazing how it's amazing how sometimes we spend so much time to build at that foundation, but it's a good foundation. But Hebrews 6:1 says, "Therefore, leaving the principle of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and our faith towards God." Very good. Right? Because sometimes we can just stay on the faith level, right? say our faith level and heaven justification level and everything. Amen. Praise be to God. I like that. I like preaching on grace. I like it's my favorite messages. I'm there because I feel so incapable on my own. I just rely on God's grace. But it it's not going to do me good if I'm always staying there. If I only No. Oh, God forgives me. God doesn't look at my mistakes. If I always stay there, I'll become a lazy Christians. I become sometime someone who start excusing everything. I'll just make it. My name is really written in the book. No, no, no, no. It's good. But don't stay there too long. You need a a message of where he kicks you a little bit. Say, "No, shake up. You are lazy. You are NOT STAND UP. WORK for me. Be in the business OF GOD. BE A SERVANT for God." THEN HE SHAKES YOU a little bit. And I I like that. But says we don't want a social gospel all the time. A social gospel to entertain that and to pat that on the on the back and say you are good. Whatever you do it's fine. No then you probably then oh yeah IT'S GOOD BUT NO LORD in this new year I want to go further. I want to be a ragged Christian. I WANT TO BE A SOLID CHRISTIAN. [clears throat] I WANT TO BE FERVENT. I WANT I WANT TO BE WORKING WORK WORK. WE'LL TOUCH THAT. YOU WORK as if salvation depending on works. YOU WORK [screaming] HARD. [laughter] YOU WORK HARD AS IF SALVATION DEPENDING ON WORKS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because we don't work hard enough because oh no, it's not on works. It's on grace. Just it's okay. Just make a little prayer and oh God, it has been a a busy day. Amen. And [clears throat] you sleep. I'm going the rapture. Hallelujah. In the church. Well, let's read the Bible. AND YOU A FAMILY ALONE. And just one God. Hallelujah. Praise be. Let's close our Bible. Let God lazy lazy lazy. And we want to revive in the church. No. TOO MUCH [screaming] ON GRACE. GRACE, GRACE. NO. WORK AS IF SALVATION DEPENDED ON IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LORD, I WANT TO PRAY. Talking about fasting in the message. Oh, no. No. THAT'S THE OLD TIME. WHY shall I fast now? We have the bridegroom. We have the husband. The No, I fast. THE LAST TIME I FASTED 20 YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB. THEN that's when I fasted. When I was looking for my wife. than when I FASTED ONE TIME ONLY HALF day lazy Christians. No, but but Lord, oh God, I I want I want to work for you. I want to be after my father's business. I I I want I want I want that travail of the soul constantly. Lord, brother Bam was praying. Brother Bam was fasting. But when I WAS SPENDING TIME in reading the word OF STUDYING THE WORD AND PRAYING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But why? THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL CHURCH. [screaming] AMEN. BUT lazy in prayer, lazy in reading the Bible. Laz in listening the message. Oh. Oh Lord, help me to draw nigh unto you, Lord. For this new year, I desire to draw nigh unto you, Lord. Desire to serve you more than ever before. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it says, they say, "Let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God, of the doctrine of baptism, and of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. And this will do if God permits. If you have time, we will always come back to it. We like that myself personally like one of my my favorite sermons is preach on that. But Paul is talking in the same chapters and says talk about those who started well with faith but along the way that faith did not produce the works of faith. They say they fell down the Hebrews 16 and then become the borderline Christians because their faith didn't produce the works. then become borderline Christians. Then at the same chapter it says but for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed towards his name and that you have ministered to the saints and to ministers and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope onto the hand that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. Do not become slothful. Do not become lazy. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not punching on you. I'm preaching to myself. I am just preaching to my If it's not for you, it's for me. I don't want to become a lazy preacher. I don't want to become a lazy who just p compiles quotes and then bring a message. No, that I don't want that. I want to spend time in prayers. I want to spend time in studying the word of God. I want to spend time in consecration. AND [laughter] THAT'S MY DESIRE. AMEN. I DON'T WANT THE EASY way and just pass by and it will be just okay. But no, no, no, Lord. Let me let me dedicate myself. LET ME SPEND TIME WITH YOU, LORD. LET ME BE THERE. I WANT TO BE THERE. I WANT TO DRAW NIGH TO YOU MORE THAN ever before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That sister is not the Oh, she's here. I can't say that testimony, but but she she struck my heart one time. I want to mention name. Just struck my heart. that little girl and just say, you know, pastor, today I'm fasting. I'm praying that that thought never get left me. Oh God, thank you for that little girl. Thank that little girl. She's just praying for the church, for her life. It's been hard long time. I heard that little girl say, "God, I'm I fast. I'm praying fasting today." &gt;&gt; We need more of that. Amen. prophet says you can't. No, I'm just putting a balance here, but I will get out of it because I'm aware of what the prophet says, but [snorts] I'm I'm I'm just in that limb of works. So, no matter what you do, you quit drinking, quit smoking, quit telling lies, go to church and try to this and try to do that, you still corner. That's just the law. The law makes nothing perfect. What makes perfect is Christ. Glory. I might quit lying, quit stealing, quit committing adultery, quit chewing, quit all the things, and I'm still carnal. God doesn't receive it because I have nothing to offer him in propitiation. But the minute that I lay my hands upon the blessed head of the Lord Jesus and say, "Lord, I'm no good. Will you take me as your servant?" God kisses away my sin. I stand perfect in the sight of God. That's right. Why? I'm not standing on my own merit. I'm standing on his. He has perfected us through his suffering and his blood. And see, it's time to It's time to close. I want to finish reading. And then he continues says, "For the law made nothing perfect by the bringing in of a perfect hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God through all our goodness and all our goodness and all our goodness and all of our goodness." So the prophet himself repeating we are still corner but once in the presence of God recognizing that we could never stand there only through the merit of Jesus Christ then we draw nigh unto God through the merit of his son. So we have to be very specific. Salvation doesn't it doesn't dep that is not based on your works. Your works cannot save you. Amen. The works can never save you. You can't say God because I've done this I've done this I haven't done that so now I deserve to be saved. No it it will fail. You have nothing you can present to God for your salvation. So I'm not preaching salvation through works. That's not correct. Amen. salvation. It's only through the blood of Jesus Christ, through the righteousness of Jesus Christ. Even no matter what you can do, you cannot claim it as a basic for your salvation. That's wrong. That's wrong. That's wrong. Amen. But if you are saved, you have to do the right works. Amen. If you are saved, you have to do the right. If you're not doing the right things and you claim you are being you are saved, that's wrong. Amen. Because you are not there yet. If you ARE SAVED, YOU HAVE TO bring those right. Amen. Can you see a child say I'm alive but I'm not breathing but I'm alive. No, you are not alive. You are if you're not dead, you are actually going to die. Amen. That's what he see. SO YOU HAVE TO BE THERE. IT HAVE TO BE MANIFESTED. LORD, I don't want to stay lazy. I will die if I stay lazy. &gt;&gt; Something has to QUICKEN ME. I HAVE to be IN REVIVAL. BUT BUT MANY times you will come say, "Lord, I NEED A REVIVAL. OTHERWISE, I'LL DIE. I NEED A REVIVAL. LORD, SHAKE ME. SHAKE, MOVE ME. HELP ME TO GO ON MY KNEES. HELP ME TO PRAY. HELP ME TO BE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. OH, GOD. I desire that. I don't WANT THAT TO DIE. I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT THE ZEAL TO DIE. I DON'T WANT TO BE, you know, as I usually say in many places where I preach, I don't I don't want to be a Christian of emergency. Only in emergency, I wake up. only when THERE IS A SITUATION IS HARD I WAKE UP WHEN THERE'S SICKNESS THEN I WAKE UP WHEN WHEN THERE IS A FINANCIAL TROUBLE THEN I WAKE UP I DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF LIFE WHETHER THERE IS SICKNESS WHETHER I'M IN HEALTH WHETHER IS A JOB WHERE I DON'T HAVE A JOB I WANT TO REMAIN A CHRISTIAN WHO LOVE THE [screaming] LORD ALL THE TIME NOT EMERGENCY CASE CHRISTIANS NO I DON'T LIKE THAT ANY MAN ANY religious person can do that amen I want more LORD I WANT PROSPERITY HER AND THEN YOU COME. OH, they they they left me. Oh, they they [clears throat] put they FIRED ME FROM MY JOB. THEN YOU COME TO CHURCH. NO, [screaming] NO, NO, NO. ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; EPHESIANS, Ephesians 1 is the book of Ephesians is the book of adoption. The prophet says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." That's what we are. He has blessed us already in all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. According chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. That's that that that that's what the prophet likes to put and says and he will say you know God doesn't want a Christians you can't be a solid Christians if you believe that today you are saved and tomorrow you are lost and today I'm saved you are basing that on your emotions no you can't be a solid Christian thank God for the message of the hour to put a solid foundation to put a solid foundation of faith you it's by revelation God has given YOU THAT BY FAITH THANK GOD FOR THE FAITH I I KNOW THAT I'm saved. No matter what, I know that I'm saved. I CAN MIGHT STUMBLE, BUT I'M STILL SAVED. AMEN. PRAISE BE TO GOD. BECAUSE HE HE CHOSE ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. BEFORE I'VE DONE ANYTHING, BEFORE I DONE ANYTHING, HE CHOSE ME. HE LOVED ME. WHEN I WAS IN THE WORST PERSON, before even believing the message of the hour, HE STILL LOVED ME. HE STILL CHOSE ME. AMEN. AMEN. SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN TURN HIM AWAY NO MATTER WHAT. BUT NOW MY OWN ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIM BECAUSE of the love that is EXPRESSED TO ME. LORD, I want to serve YOU WITH ALL MY HEART. I WANT TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE WITH ALL MY HEART. I WANT TO DRAW NIGH TO YOU, LORD, BECAUSE YOU WILL DRAW NIGH TO ME. YOU WILL MANIFEST IT MORE TO ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The God has chosen us in him before the foundation that he should be holy and without blame. said having predestinated us unto the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will. So the adoption is only predestinated before the foundation of the world. Amen. As I preached one time the new birth is the earnest of the redemption until the day of the redemption. I touched that and many brothers has spoke on that spoken on that. Brother Gilbert touched on that wonderfully. Chapter one, chapter two. The prophet says the book of Ephesians pulls things together. He takes the Armenian, the Calvinist, he put them together. I ask not to think of he says grace is what God did for me. Works is what I do for him. If you climb on either one of the limbs, you will be sure find yourself on the end on the limb and then can't get back. The book of Ephesians pulls it together. I think I would say that many places the book of Ephesians take that together. But you know the book of Ephesians talks about the faith and it talks about the predestination even the adoption is giving the good foundation of that only in the very few chapters of it. Chapter one, chapter 2 maybe chapter three a little bit the first part of chapter 3 is give us a good foundation of faith but after that it only works. Then he start talking but we we stop sometimes only on we NOW IT'S EPHESIANS DON'T DON'T DON'T talk about works only Ephesians yeah but Ephesians talks about works we look on chapter three it talks about tribulations so no you have to go to tribulations don't don't don't be don't don't don't be don't don't stumble when you have tribulations chapter three the last part of tribulation then we go to chapter four we mentioned that last Sunday talk about the five-fold ministry talk about the the body of Christ. Every part of the body supplies together. Oh, that's part of adoption. YES, THAT'S PART OF ADOPTIONS. GOD NEEDS YOU. GOD NEEDS ME. IT'S PART OF IT. AMEN. WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP. IT'S PART OF IT. CHAPTER FIVE IS TALKING ABOUT FAMILIES. TALKING ABOUT THE FATHER, THE MOTHER, THE BROTHER, AND THE SISTERS. AMEN. THE SERVANTS, THE MASTERS, THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO WORKS ON TOP OF IT MEANS WE HAVE A SOLID FOUNDATION NOW ON TOP OF IT FOR THE GODLINESS AND ALL THINGS YOU HAVE TO WORK. DON'T DO THIS, DO THIS, DON'T DO THIS, DO THIS, DON'T DO THIS, DON'T DO THIS. BUT I THANK GOD FOR PROPHET PUTTING THAT TOGETHER. It's not what you are doing is saving you. No, WHAT IS SAVING YOU IS GOD CHOSE YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. BUT AS HE CHOSE YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION AS YOU ARE WALKING YOUR LIFE IS EXPRESSING [screaming] IT TO GET TO THE ADOPTION. THAT FAITH HAS TO COME TO THE PERFECTION. AMEN. [snorts] THE PERFECTION IS NOT ONLY THE FAITH. NO THE PERFECTION IS THAT FAITH COME INTO LIFE. &gt;&gt; Lord I want my life to match what I'm confessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it says Ephesians 6:10 18. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord. Be strong in the Lord. In the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God. In Ephesians, put on the whole armor of God. You do that. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the viles of the devil. For we wrestle not against the flesh and the blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take upon unto you the whole arm of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all TO STAND. STAND THEREFORE, having your loins girth about with truth, having on the press the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet short with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery doubts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. Take the WORD OF GOD. AMEN. PRAYING ALWAYS with all prayer and supplication the spirit and watching there onto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. But but but Paul I thought only let me talk about predestinations that that my adoptions. No yes that the foundation for adoptions but you have to put all those things together. Make sure that you take make sure that you pray. Make sure that YOU TAKE THE WORD of God. MAKE SURE THAT you that YOU TAKE THE SWORD OF THE WORD OF GOD IN ORDER TO STAND. OTHERWISE, YOU WILL FALL. YOU HAVE TO STAND. YOU'RE NOT GOING WE ARE NOT GOING THE RAPTURE JUST BARELY MAKING IT. NO, WE ARE GOING THE RAPTURE STANDING ON GOD'S PROMISES. I'M A [screaming] I'M A SOLDIER OF THE CROSS. I'M THE SOLDIER OF THE MESSAGE. I OWN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT'S MY MESSAGE. AMEN. I'M STANDING UPON IT. AMEN. I'M DEFENDING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE IN THE LAND OF CANAAN, YOU ARE DEFENDING THE LAND OF CANAAN. BEING IN THE LAND OF CANAAN, IN THE LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST, YOU ARE IN THE LAND OF THE PROMISE, YOU ARE DEFENDING YOUR BORDERS. AMEN. YOU ARE DEFENDING YOUR YOUR YOUR FRONTIERS. YOU ARE YOU ARE PUTTING THE THINGS ASIDE THAT CANNOT COME THROUGH YOUR LANDS. YOU ARE DEFENDING YOUR LANDS. EVERY INCH OF YOUR LAND, YOU ARE STANDING UPON IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. Let's draw nigh unto God. God will bless us tremendously if we draw nigh unto God. How can I draw n unto him? Brother Moses, put on the whole armor of God. If you pray, God will draw nigh unto you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you meditate upon the word of God each morning, every night, God will draw nigh unto you &gt;&gt; in a much greater way than before. The same principle goes in Deuteronomy 28 in the Old Testament says, "It shall come to pass if you shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth. And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God." It's a promise. In the desert, you have the mana. You have things that they're giving to you freely and all the different things and they didn't have to work and everything just given. But once you go into the land of the Holy Ghost, you have to fight for everything. You have to fight for your joy. Amen. You have to fight for you you fight as if it depended the salvation depended on your works. That's the key. You fight as if the salvation depended on your works. If you don't have that in mind, you I will get it. Prophet himself say myself. I'm I'm working hard. I'm working out my own salvation. The prophet will say many time because because as we believe that your name is written in the lamb's book of life, it's only faith. You never saw your name as written white and white. Say, "Okay, this is your name. You can never be lost. Whatever you do, that's a wrong understanding. I can do whatever I do because my name, show me where your name is." No, it's only faith. You just believe it as myself. I'm believing it. &gt;&gt; But there is no material proof to show it. &gt;&gt; But I'm working out because I believe my name is there. So I'm working out my own salvation believing my name is there. I don't want at the end of the works no look you were living and who told you that your name was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we sometime we switch it the wrong wrong way. No no no you I don't want to get on my note but but you get my idea right. &gt;&gt; You live as if your salvation depended on your works. In all the churches today till I last the last last it's the last sermon of the week. You will be blessed next year. You will be millionaires. You will have this. Amen. Hallelujah. GOD IS AMEN. HALLELUJAH. I'm not against that. The pro part of the promise of God. Amen. Claim every promise of God. But the secret I'm giving you for your prosperity of next year. Draw nigh unto God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we all draw nigh unto God, he will bless us beyond our expectations. &gt;&gt; He knows our natural needs. He knows the things we're going even in this in the sickness in the body. He knows all these things. Seek first the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Draw nigh unto God. God will give you more than even what you ask. &gt;&gt; That's the secret of blessings. One brother shared with us this go this go thing that was in WhatsApp group says proverb 24:16 for a just man fallth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief like the way he kind of put it it says you know as you draw n to god as you draw n to god you might make mistakes you might fall but you have a scripture to back you up a last man fallth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief. If you look at the scripture here who falls many times is not the is not the wicked one is the righteous one. The righteous one falls seven times. The wicked falls only one time. But the secret is upon rising up. The righteous falls is righteous but he falls but he stand up. God raise him up. God make HIM TO STAND UP ONCE AGAIN. BUT THE ONE WHO'S not righteous, he he falls once he falls, HE FALLS FOREVER. HE GONE. AMEN. BUT YOU MIGHT FALL. BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD. I'M STANDING UP AGAIN BECAUSE EPHESIANS told me I HAVE TO STAND UP AGAIN. I FALL, I STAND UP. I FALL, I STAND UP. I FALL, I STAND UP. BUT YOU KEEP PRESSING ON. YOU KEEP MOVING ON. LORD, I WANT I DESIRE TO DONATE TO YOU. I KNOW THAT I failed yesterday, but that's not the end of the goal. I'M STILL PRESSING ON WITH YOU, LORD. I'LL STILL COME TO CHURCH. I'LL STILL READ THE WORD OF GOD. I'LL STILL PRAY, LORD JESUS. I'M DETERMINED TO PRAY EVERY DAY. YESTERDAY, I MISSED IT, LORD. BUT, FATHER, THAT'S NOT THE END OF TODAY. I WILL START AGAIN. I'LL KEEP MOVING ON, FATHER. I'LL KEEP PRAISING YOU, LORD. I'LL KEEP PRAYING, [screaming] PRAYING, PRAYING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I've had a dedication myself in my life. I've dedicated Friday night for prayer since I was a young boy. My wife can testify it. Fridays is for God. I I gave it to God since I was young boy. Lord, Friday, I will stay faithful to Friday to it's your night no matter what. Kept it since I was a young boy. But there's a Friday sometimes I miss to pray. But I dedicated. I didn't do anything on that Friday. It was for God. But sometimes I miss I miss still pray but in the morning or during that week said God I'm back to my promise to you Lord I still want to pray father give this my time let let you replace that Friday that I missed because I was busy for this but father keep praying I keep praying draw nigh unto God he shall draw unto you Chronicles 7:4 if My people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sins and will heal their land if they humble themsel how can I draw nigh to God how can I draw oh God give me that spirit of h humility I humble myself before you Lord I'm nothing your word is right I'm nothing but your word is right Father, but I want to draw nigh to you, Lord. I want to humble myself. I don't I I don't want to take any pride on myself. I don't want to say no, this doesn't pertain to me, Lord. Father, I humble myself to the word of God. And you promise that you will heal me. You will hear my prayers. You will answer to my prayer. You will heal this land. You will heal even this land, Lord, if I humble myself. That's the principle of God. Lord, IF I DRAW NIGH to you, you shall draw nigh unto me. YOU WILL BLESS ME, FATHER. That's your promise. Amen. God God honors humility to the point that I like to say it many times to the point that God even heard the prayer of Hab in First Kings 21:27 says if I came to pass it came to pass Hab heard those words when Hab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite saying thou how Hab humble himself said before me because he humbled himself before me. I will not bring the evil in his day but in his son's day will I bring the evil upon his house. Humility changed the judgment of God because e even for Hab who is the most wicked of all the KINGS BUT BECAUSE HE had the right attitude of humbling himself God changed that judgment in his days and put ANOTHER DAY. IF GOD could hear the prayer of a wicked man AS A HAB, HOW MUCH MORE FOR A SON AND A DAUGHTER OF GOD WHO FOLLOWS THE APPROACH OF GOD? GOD, I'M HUMBLING MYSELF. OH LORD, THIS YEAR I JUST WANT TO BE HUMBLE AND OBEY YOUR WORD NO MATTER WHAT. LORD, I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO BLESS ME, FATHER. I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT YOU WILL BLESS. THAT'S YOUR WORD. GOD IS ENTITLED TO OBEY HIS TO FOLLOW HIS OWN WORD. HE CAN BANKRUPT [screaming] ALL HEAVEN BUT HIS WORD CAN NEVER BE BROKEN. AMEN. HIS PROMISE CAN NEVER BE BROKEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So this is not only the principle of the law under the bulls of God is still valid today. In Zechariah 1:3 says, "Therefore say thou unto them, thou say the Lord of hosts, turn ye unto me, say the Lord of hosts, and I will turn unto you, say the Lord of hosts." Amen. &gt;&gt; Zechariah is is the prophet is one of the prophet of restoration. You want restoration in your family. You want restoration in your Christian life. Follow this principle. Lord, I will turn back to you. Lord, you s you you you you the one who saved me. I didn't save myself. You took me in the PLACE WHERE I WAS SO DOWN. YOU TOOK ME THERE. BUT ALONG THE WAY FOR ME GROWING, FATHER, NOW IT'S MY turn to turn back to you, to seek your face, to looking FOR YOU, TO DRAW NIGH TO YOU, LORD. YOU DREW NIGH TO ME WHEN I WAS NOTHING, BUT NOW IT'S MY TURN TO DRAW NIGH TO YOU, TO TURN BACK TO YOU, LORD. I WANT I WANT TO BE CLOSE TO YOU AS NEVER BEFORE. NOT [screaming] FAR, AS BROTHER ZEKE PRAYED LAST TIME, I DON'T WANT TO BE FAR FROM GOD AND SAY, "NO, I I'M I'M OKAY. I can do whatever I DO BEING FAR FROM GOD." NO, LET ME GET CLOSER TO THE WORD OF GOD. LET ME APPROACH THE WORD OF GOD. LET ME LIVE FAITHFULLY AS MUCH AS I CAN TO THE WORD OF GOD. AS OBEDIENT AS I CAN TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Not shortcuts. Amen. Prophet says those scriptures might be fulfilled if you would only search. If you notice, God only reveal himself to those who search and long to see him. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I thought his is sovereign grace. Yes. to pick you up. But in your daily walk with God now, it's about you how you approach him. If you approach him, he reveals more to you than you go. Even for the preacher, he can be so much gifted, but he has to be in study. If he does, if he's not study, very few words will come out of his mouth. He has to go and search. Brother Banam as a prophet is on was he was studying the word of God &gt;&gt; spending time in prayer and study. The prophet of the age born a prophet from the womb. He was a prophet &gt;&gt; but he had to study. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God revealed himself more to the one who's seeking for him. &gt;&gt; Principle of the Bible. Why? Not the law and the grace. the same thing says draw nigh unto me and I will draw nigh unto you say the Lord the prophet continues and sometimes God lets things happen so that we will draw nigh unto him &gt;&gt; times he allow certain things and then you start coming back to him now you because you want to attend now you draw back to him and then God will bless you more bless you more will bless you more for God has surely ordained that certain things must take place and they will unfold All just as as his great time clock ticks it off. It's time for God. Believe. End of quote there. But I think it's time of God that these promises will be fulfilled. Are you with me this evening this morning? I'm speaking from the burden of my heart. Lord, I want to draw nigh to you this year. That's that's my desire. I desire to draw nigh unto you. No matter what the others do, but my decision, I want to draw nigh to you &gt;&gt; as never before. reaction to an action said I think it will be good for prayer meetings to go on all the day long long around here just everywhere for you cannot get anything from God until you get close to God you know it's written the scripture draw nigh unto me and I will draw nigh unto you and if we were here for now for one sole purpose that is draw nigh unto God amen brother as I say brother Bham was 4 fulfill Malachi 4:4 for for the first pool, for the second pool, for the third pool. He was called for that mission. He was called for that work. But every time he has to move from the even move to the first pool, even move to the second pool, more emphasizing, moving to the second pool, more emphasizing moving to the third pool. God has to tell him, you have to be more sincere. You have to be more sincere. You have to draw nigh to me more than how you did on the first pull. For the second pool, you ordained for it, but you have to be more sincere. For the third pool, you ordain for it, but you have to be more sincere. Amen. In all churches today, we that God will give us many blessings to the people if this year we become more drawn nearer to him than it was before &gt;&gt; because he's the high priest is still pronouncing the blessings upon upon us. But we need to get draw near to him than it was last before. Amen. Let the preacher pray more and dedicate himself more to the Lord. Not just the role of a preacher, that's not good enough. He has to dedicate himself more and pray more to God for this new year. Amen. Let the song leader pray and dedicate more to God. So just no, I just put I know how to sing and then I'll just be I'll bring emotion in the church. Uh no no that's good but that's not good enough. We need want him to be dedicated. He want to be to be praying. He must BE DEDICATING HIS LIFE. THE PREACHER, THE SONG LEADER, ALL OF US. AMEN. [screaming] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE WANT MORE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT. We are a full church dedicated for God. Amen. Let the musician dedicated himself more to God. Not casual musicians. No, I just No, no. Dedicate myself to God. Come to church early, pray, stay in the atmosphere. WE WANT MORE OF THE BLESSINGS. NOT CASUAL MUSICIANS. NO, NO, NO, NO. Don't let light. No, no, no. Serious be with God. &gt;&gt; Is it okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the family altar be restored in our house. &gt;&gt; Not no occasionally. No, no. Let let be serious this year, Lord. I I want to draw nigh to you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the blessings of the family altar will be spilled upon the church. It will come into the church. As our families are strong, the church will be stronger. If we draw nigh to clo to God in our families, our church will be blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the DEACONS COME ON TIME TO CHURCH. Let the deacons, we have two deacons now. Let's pray for them for the work. God pull open the doors for work so we can come to church. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD, WE DESIRE EVERYTHING TO BE IN ORDER. HELP US, LORD JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S OUR DESIRE. THAT'S OUR [screaming] CRY. WE PRAY WE our deacon. We It's our burden or heart. Lord, help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's sharing the same burden as our brother Philip is sharing the same burden. He put a request last time as we expressed that desire to him. We say, "Lord, pastor, can we can you ask the church to pray for me so that they can give me a little bit of work on a Sunday? I don't want just to be a deacon of a title. No, I want to be there, Lord. I want to be on my post duty. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Help us." &gt;&gt; Thank God for the deacon. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And they have that burden. The Sunday school teacher, let the her be dedicated, not just the casual filling time. No, no, no, no. [clears throat] Be dedicated. I want to get time. I want to be there. Right, sweetheart? I can point her because she's she's she's mine. Now listen this. This church must not be operated like a church in a survival mode. &gt;&gt; It's not a church in a survival mode. So let's just do it to fill in time of surviving and then no Lord in my post of duty that I am let me be as faithful as possible as if it was a big church. Let me be faithful as it was. Even if just three people come to the church, you are faithful in those three people. Each person be faithful to his own to his post duty. Let move that mentality of they know it it a small church only the big church will try to be your time so that I will I no one will take my spot come to church to be to keep your spot in the big church that's why you are early on time no but here whether someone takes my place doesn't take my place I have a dedicated place I will still come on time and pray and dedicate myself Lord I desire to draw nigh unto you, Lord. It's not it's it's not a it's not a secondass church. No, &gt;&gt; this is a it's it's it's our church. &gt;&gt; We we we are going to the same rapture as any other church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why Why are we belittling ourselves down? &gt;&gt; That's right. If you mention about the second service on Sunday, three people will show up. That's for the big church. Our small church, no one will show up. But why are we belittling ourselves a secondass church? I'm not the pastor of a second class church. A survival mode. No, &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a pastor of a second church. A secondass church. Just take anyone. Anyone can preach. Anyone can anyone can do this. No, ju just to survive, just to make things work. No, what am I going to tell God? No, I want just to keep member. I can't mention those things because if if if that family leave the church is is empty. No, Lord, let me preach faithfully &gt;&gt; to one person to two person, let me preach the word of God fully. The word of God without compromise. IT'S NOT A SECONDASS CHURCH. is the bride of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. PREACH ON GRACE. PREACH ON THE WORKS. PREACH ON EVERYTHING. GIVE EVERYTHING BECAUSE THIS BRIDE WILL BE PART OF THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE CHURCH OF THE FOOLISH VIRGIN. THIS IS THE CHURCH OF THE [screaming] WISE VIRGIN. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Every revival always comes by the return to the word of God. &gt;&gt; My desire is through this time, maybe your time as well, go to the church order, listen to it, see. Oh, this is where brother says what put these tapes if you can in every church to see what the church order is. To have a revival things has to be in order. The word has to be bought restored. &gt;&gt; So, brother many times let's go back to the word of God. Let's go back to the word of God. Thank God for the message of the hour. We are going back to the word of God. Not to off truth but the whole truth. Amen. Because we want the whole revival TO BE WORKING UPON US. AMEN. Praise be to God. So you want a revival. Go back to the word of God. In the book of Jo in in in the Old Testament, you see Josiah. Josiah was one of of of of a king that God loved him. He was after he was like he was like his father David. The Bible says I think I think the Bible described him as one of the most dedicated something like that in that line. I forgot that says in English. But when he heard when he read the the book the the book of the law was read to him in 2 Kings 22 his heart was broken and said WHY CAN'T WE APPLY THE WORD of God why CAN'T WE APPLY THE WORD OF GOD IN in in ISRAEL WHY WHY LET'S PUT THINGS IN ORDER LET'S PUT THINGS in order let's put and when things were put in order God removed the judgment on on on Israel for his time when he was leaving to put another time so it can't be fulfilled this time because Josiah to return completely ly to God. WE HOLD HIS HEART TO THE WORD OF GOD. THEN GOD DREW NIGH TO ISRAEL. ONE MORE TIME. THE SAME PRINCIPLE IS HEART. WE HAVE THE COVENANT OF ISRAEL. AMEN. WE HAVE THE UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT. GOD CANNOT DENY ISRAEL. He still stay with that Israel. But for the blessings, FOR THE BLESSING, ISRAEL HAS TO TURN BACK TO GOD. AMEN. THE SAME FOR US. IF WE TURN BACK TO GOD WITH ALL OUR HEART REALLY SERVING HIM WITH ALL OUR HEART, GOD WILL BLESS US TREMENDOUSLY. TREMENDOUSLY. AMEN. PRAISE BE TO GOD. IT'S OUR PROMISE. &gt;&gt; NOW, let me read it. We need a back to the word of God. Back to not back back to not some emotion, some talk of back to the word, not some talk of a back to the word, but I mean the heart and soul in the individual, back to the word of God. Certainly what did you why did you why why they afraid to say it you get to speaking about it your organization will o you out say some people are so if you abide in me and my words about you then ask what you will that either the truth or it is in the truth if it is the truth it will work now if you want to know where the secret lies the power visions and things is back to the word it's the word of God any revival we need a revival in our church what we need is the back to the word of God. But by the way, not only to the purpose, but back to the WORD OF GOD ALSO IN OBEDIENCE. LORD, I DESIRE TO OBEY THE WHOLE WORD OF GOD. LET ME GET BACK TO THE WHOLE WORD OF GOD. YEAH, MAYBE I WAS not faithful there, Lord. Thank God that your grace was still upon me today. I'm still standing, Father. But Lord, I my desire is to serve you greater way in a greater greater way. Father in one the prophet says if you get if you got to get with the word get yourself killed out. I'm persuaded that many of us friends we have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough Holy Ghost in us to make us to place where we don't want to lie or we don't want to steal. We don't want to do anything. But God wants to feel every fiber of his church. He want to feel your thinking. He want to feel your mind. You want to feel every bit of you just make you completely totally dead yourself to all your thinking just to surrender. So surrendering God till his word is just living right through you. You don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word. It is life. Not only to be I believe the message because I stopped I stopped cheating. Oh that that that's the every Christian should do that. But father I want to go deeper father. I want to wash my thinking to think like you to have the love of God to forgive. OH GOD BRING ME A HIGHER LEVEL LORD JESUS CHRIST AND DEDICATION FOR PRAYER for commitment living for others. Amen. Amen. Now let me just running out of time. Thought I won't have enough to to develop on but thank God for pulling. Thank you for pulling. &gt;&gt; Help me to. Philippians chapter 22:16. Wherefore, my beloved, as [snorts] you have always obeyed, as you have always obeyed, and that's our testimony. Not as in my presence only, not only the presence of the deacon, not only presence of the past, not only present, but you have obeyed yourself personally, but now much more in my absence. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his [snorts] good pleasure. Do all things without memory and disputing. Do all things without murmuring disputing that you may be blameless and harmless. The sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perversed nation among whom you shine as light in the world. You can't shine as a light in the world if you are living like the world. If you are thinking like the world. No, you are not shining. YOU ARE LIKE THE WORLD. YOU YOU you're living in darkness. But if you live according to the WORD OF GOD DESPITE THE PERSECUTION, DESPITE YOUR SUFFERING, THEN YOU ARE SHINING. Then he says, "Holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I may that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain." You trust the Lord in knowing that your might not. You trusted the Lord knowing that your salvation is already purchased by the love by the Lord Jesus Christ and nothing can take you away for you. But you live as your salvation depended on your work. Your work work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. The prophet says in straight is the gate. He says there is sure going to be some great disappointment at the judgment. I don't want [snorts] it sounds negative and it might sound fearful but but let's just just allow me to to say it in the light of what I've preached this evening this morning. Amen. So the bootle but the b the bootleger he knows where he's going to be at the judgment. So does the the beer hound know where he's going to be. So does the prostitute know where she'll stand. So does the gambler know where they'll stand. So does the drunker know where they'll stand. He's not he's not going to be disappointed. But where the disappoint is going to be is those who thought they were right. That that's where the disappointment. When they go up there, they say, "Sh, we cast out devils in your name. We are preachers. We belong to certain certain certain churches. We done great miracles and we preached talking to preachers. Oh, we preached. I had a gift of preaching and all everything is fine. I've been a steward in the church. I've been a bishop and things. I've been this. Depart from me." Prophet says, "Depart from me. You workers of iniquity. I never even knew. There you are. That's the disappointment. He said the children of the your children will come in and say down at the kingdom say we've got it to be here. They will be cast out in out of darkness where there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. Straight is the gate. Narrow is the way that leadth to life. Few there will be that find it. Let me tell you the hardest part of the message that we have received is not the grace part. Who will refuse the grace part? The grace part is not the hard is not what makes the message the narrow path. What makes the message the narrow path is the work path of the Holy Spirit in the people. That's where things get narrowed. Says no that that that wasn't a time of brother. Not in our time. That's a time where they have they didn't have two three jobs. That's not not but in our time is hard. No. But how can you shine if you are doing like the world? Your only way to shine is to prove that no matter how the world is going, you stand with the word of God &gt;&gt; and apply the word of God. Lord, I desire to draw nigh to you. You will take care of the rest. I say to you, my dear people, this morning, listen to this. I've never made this up. I'm responsible for telling it. That's all I'm responsible for. If I've never preached another sermon in my life, this is the truth. There is just going to be a few people saved. Just remember that. Just a very few. You'll be one of them. This is not a very good message for for a preacher to preach or to say like that to to the bride of Jesus Christ. But I know you understand what I mean, right? I'm not trying to put fear on it, but I'm just trying to shake us a little bit. Say, Lord, I want to be part of those few. I know I'm part of those few but let my works show that I'm part of those few. So who are they? Brother Branam say I don't know. Nobody else knows. We work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. Brother Bam doesn't know. I don't know. Even yourself you don't know except your own faith. But says but you work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. But you be lined up with God. If your heart don't beat just with the Bible, then there is something wrong. There is something wrong. No matter what your church says, you can't go in by that. You go, you got to go in by what God said. This is the book. You'll be judged from the Bible. Stay with it. If you say, "Well, I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." That's correct. That's the Bible. But if that life doesn't follow it, it doesn't do much good to be baptized. You say, "Well, I've received the Holy Ghost." That's good. But what you should have done, but if the life isn't there, then you'll continue. In other words, life is the one that distinguishes. And the life we make all mistakes all the time, but my life, Lord, is my desire, Lord. My desire is to draw nigh to you. My desire is to get closer to the word of God. Draw me near to the word of God. I will do my part. I will be determined as the first song was. I am determined to draw nigh to you, Lord. In this new year, I am determined to draw nigh to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same message says straight is again. Now remember, the weeds receive the same power that falls on the wheat to make it grow. Makes the wheat shout. The little old weed stand out and just as happy as the wheat is. That's right. lives by the same life and a sinner can stay in the presence of God shout the victory live like a Christian but if there isn't something different in the heart you could have the same power to cast out evil spirit Jesus said so he can preach the gospel just as good as any other preacher can do that exactly what Jesus said so the Bible teaches it yes sir though I speak with tongues with man and of angel though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice I give all my goods to fill the poor I have faith to move mountains I do all these things I preach in his name. I cast out devils in the name. He said I'm nothing. [snorts] But this message is not only for the it's also for the preacher. It's also for me. Amen. With I have not more mountains do not. I preach in his name. I cast devils. He said I'm nothing. If I could do it and nothing. Get the idea. The thing to do is from your heart be a Christian. Now enter in that straight gate. Broad is the way that leads to destruction. million times, millions of this generation of believers will go in their because straight the gate narrow is the way just you and Christ alone. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you don't want any trouble at the river. You don't want to come to the river say no but yeah I believed it but I didn't do it. So why that's what's called iniquity. No, you knew better. Then you should do because you knew better. Some people don't know, but you knew better. Lord, I don't want any trouble at the river. Abraham and his seed. He says, [snorts] "So God doesn't run his business. If he saved us here and know that he was going to lose us after a while, poor businessman. So therefore all that he forneew he he was he has called. All that he has called he has justified. All that he has justified he has already glorified. Now there is going to be a church meet him there without spot and wrinkle. Brother Banam you in it? Are you in it? Says I hope so. Says yeah I hope so. But we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. That fear is doesn't mean that you are scared and everything. No [snorts] it's not. It's just respectful. I'm I'm respectful. I'm I'm sincere as it was called to prophet be sincere. Be more sincere. Says when because we don't want to do things by traditions you know I just come to church and I know there'll be two trees of songs with and then that this and that. This is you can memorize become just traditions. Ah no but I don't I don't want to be more sincere lord. As I come I want to meet you. I want to have a fellowship with you. Speak to my heart lord. Correct me. Change me father. If there's anything I need to improve, help me to improve. Father, you speak even be way beyond the words of the preacher because the Holy Spirit can convince me of something. Father, I want to be I want to be the masterpiece. I want to be corrected. Shape me, mold me, Father. I don't want I I don't want me to fit I I I don't I don't want the garment to fit my conditions, but I want me to fit your garment, Lord. So, shape me. Take anything that is not of yours, Lord. I want to be REFLECTING YOU, LORD. HELP ME, FATHER. Help me to be more sincere, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, are you in it? No. I hope so. But we work out our own salvation, fear, and tremblies. When you see your life not coping up with God's word, and no matter what church you belong, you know you're out of order. If you do your religion because you know it's something that you are supposed to do, you're just playing the part of hypocrite. It [snorts] isn't from your heart that you love God that then you are wrong to start with. You love it's love that controls the whole thing. Love of God. [snorts] As the prophet will many places I love my wife so well but I don't want to do anything that will hurt her. If if if feel love can bring me to live that way. How much more agapa love? It's not like I'm going to be lost but I just love him so much. It's not by fear. prophet will go even deeper. So even if he sends me to hell, I will still love him. I will not regret serving God. I will not regret coming to church. I will not regret him praying. I'll still love him even in that conditions. If there is something called love over there, I'LL STILL LOVE HIM. THAT'S WHERE THE CHRISTIAN LIFE HAS TO BE. LORD, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. NOT TO PLEASE SOMEONE, not to please the pastor, NOT TO PLEASE. NO, I WANT TO SERVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART. THIS YEAR I WANT TO DRAW NIGHT TO YOU LORD. WE LOVING YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING. NOT A LIP SERVICE BUT FROM OUR HEART LORD. AND AND IT SHOWS. IT'S PUBLIC. IT'S KNOWN. I'M NOT I'M I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SHOW IT. I LOVE YOU LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Another message trying to do God without it being God's will. After the seals says when I use predestinated I don't think that the the only word I know to make it's God's fornowledge. See if he know he can't he died that all might be saved. He did but for by his for knowledge he know who would and would not that what he knows I don't know it you don't know it changes so yeah but you don't know it you you just say it a confession yes but you don't know it for certainty so I don't know it you don't know it so we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling now but God has his word set and he said it in the old ages is for knowledge has caused him to set in the church in the people certain things that he did from the beginning then the gospel that's being preached to that age is only revealed to that certain people the rest of them don't see it that certain people is you and me others don't receive it have the ability to receive it but you and me by God's grace we have received it thank God for putting that ability in our heart to receive the word of God. &gt;&gt; But now I will live as if my salvation depended on my works knowing that it doesn't save me. But the way I live, I live as if it's depending on my works. little preach to justification I think is the one who said if it's not him the other the other the other pastor in England says when I look at myself I don't see how I can be saved but when I look at Christ I don't see how I can be lost &gt;&gt; because it's all about Christ &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; when you look at Christ I don't see how I can be lost &gt;&gt; because he paid it all for me &gt;&gt; thank God for his grace Yes. &gt;&gt; Is it okay? Give me a few minutes. I'll be closing here. I just want to put a a paragraph, a parallel to Caleb here. Caleb said the type of the true believer Joshua to the Joshua is the type of the Holy Ghost. Despite this giant giant, we are more than a conqueror to possess the land. We are not retracting. We will keep moving forward. His attitude of Caleb did not change. The attitude of Kalb was the same before crossing Jordan. It was the same after crossing Jordan. If we can't put it in time today is not only is not you you are not you are not working you are not you are not you are not serving God only until you get the Holy Ghost and then you rest and says no I'm in the canon and everything is no Caleb before we crossing Jordan. So no this giant they cannot stop me they CANNOT STOP US ACCORDING TO GOD'S WORD BY GOD'S GRACE WE ARE MORE THAN OVERCOMER WE CAN OVERCOME THIS LAND WE ARE GOING TO OVERCOME THIS LAND IT'S OUR POSSESSION IT'S OUR LAND THAT GOD LOOK AT THAT ATTITUDE SAYS I LOVE THE spirit of Caleb it's a different spirit than other spirit of the other one they're complaining murmuring they can't think that they can't DO IT BUT CALEB SAYS I KNOW BY GOD'S GRACE IT'S GOD'S PROMISE WE WILL DO IT AMEN THAT THE ATTITUDE OF THE BRIDE IN THIS AGE BY GOD'S GRACE BY GOD'S GRACE BY GOD'S GRACE BY THE ANOINTING OF THE EAGLE WE HAVE RECEIVED WE ARE MORE THAN OVERCOMERS OF LEODYSIA NO MATTER THE CONDITION OF THE ODYSIA THIS WORD OF GOD WILL MEET EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE EVERY SITUATIONS it is IS THE WORD OF GOD THAT MEET THE END TIME CONDITIONS AMEN THANK [screaming] GOD &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE WAS BAPTIZED in the type of the holy ghost coming into the land of the holy ghost in THE PROMISED LAND OF THE HOLY BECAUSE HIS ATTITUDE STAY THE SAME. AMEN. WHEN HE WAS CLAIMING FOR HIS MOUNTAIN SAYS, "NO, I'M STILL STRONG AS I WAS BACK THEN. IT'S NOT MY AGE THAT HAS CHANGED ANYTHING. I'M STILL CONFESSING THE WORD OF GOD. GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN. I'M STANDING FOR MY MOUNTAIN. I WILL FIGHT FOR MY ANOINTING. I WILL FIGHT FOR MY FAMILY. I WILL FIGHT FOR MY INHERITANCE. I WILL FIGHT FOR THE WORD OF GOD. I WILL DRAW NIGH TO GOD." AMEN. THAT'S THE ATTITUDE OF THE BRIDE. AMEN. ARE YOU WITH ME THIS MORNING? LORD, [screaming] I WANT TO PRESS ON WITH YOU. LORD, I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH YOU BECAUSE IT'S MY PROMISE. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet will take that and and take that and as an inspiration for desperation. He says desperation when you seeketh me with all thy heart then I'll hear you. The kingdom the law the prophets were until John. Since then, the kingdom of heaven has been preached and men pressed into it. You don't just stand around and say, "Pick me up by the call of Lord, Lord, and push me in." No, you press into it. You get DESPERATE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. That's another time for another story. I thinking right talking about that that woman took he was praying for her and she was praying after she got so desperate and says, "Oh God, save me." says the alcoholic and animals also cure her. NOTHING COULD HAVE DONE IT. BUT THEM BIG BLACK EYES looked upon me and she dropping of the shi she shy the chips and she says something happened. Oh yes sir something happened. She got desperate. It says let desperate about between life. If you don't get desperate we don't go through here. But if you're desperate come here and watch you'll GET JUST GET HERE. says desperation watch the kingdom of God it will become the kingdom of God presence you have forces I like the first you have to have taken by force you have to be like you like depend on you depending on you oh you fighting for it as depending on your own I pray. [snorts] I'm tired, but I haven't pray. I'm tired, but I have to go to church. I'm glad we go to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Does it give you salvation? No. You continue living because you love us so much. No, I'm tired. It's not I was suffering. No, no, no, no. I'm talking to myself. I hate myself when I think that way. I'm like, what are what kind of believers are you just going to go into rapture and I just be lazy and I don't want to be that kind of preacher? No, no, no. I don't want to be that. No, I don't want to be that. I hate when I think that way. &gt;&gt; I hate when I think that way. No, no, no. But finding excuse. I can find excuse for everything. &gt;&gt; If you go with excuse, you could find excuses for everything. &gt;&gt; But no, sometimes I have to pull myself to go to work. The roads are bad, but I still go to work. No, this is my if I don't, hey, who's going to pay this mortgage? Let's pull myself in. But when it come to church, you know that brother Andrew is there know he'll take care of that. And you go the same rapture as brother Andrew and then God help us. Amen. Is it okay? I think I can close there. I hope it's fine. This new Lord, I just I just want to be to draw n to you. Musicians can come. I put I put the nails where I have to put. But Lord, help me to draw nigh unto you, Lord. That's my desire. As I draw nigh unto you, you'll draw nigh unto me. That's your promise. But we have do doing do those things all through our life. We have been faithful. We have been loving the Lord. We have been doing our best. That's true. We have been doing our best, brothers and sisters. It's not to condemn any person. But I think there's still room to do better. There's still room to improve. Otherwise, if there was no room to improve, we would not be alive today. The fact that we are still alive, God's shows that we still have [music] a role to play, something to do, or maybe something to improve on. Lord, help me to grow with you until I reach perfection, maturity as you want. Father, Philippians 4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, rejoice. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for for [music] nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplications with thanksgiving, let your request be known unto God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding [music] shall keep your heart and mind through Jesus Christ. Finally, finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of a good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things, these things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, do [music] and the God of peace shall be with you. And then verse 13, I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me. That's the attitude [music] Lord prophet in other places say how can you draw nigh to God think upon him think upon the good things how he saved you think stay positive that how will you draw nigh unto him and he [music] will draw nigh unto you all the time amen you love him [music] which song are you playing draw me Draw me near, &gt;&gt; near, near, oh blessed Lord to the [music] cross where [singing] thou has done. Draw me nearer, near, oh nearer, blessing Lord [music] to thy gracious leading sound. I am thine, oh Lord, Lord. [music] I [singing] have heard thy voice and it all of your life to [music] thee. Let's stand together. But I long to [music] rise in the arms of faith and be [music and singing] closer drawn to thee. Draw me near. [music] Draw me near. Oh near, oh blessed [music] Lord to the cross where when I die. Oh, draw me [singing and music] nearer, nearer, nearer, [music and singing] blessed Lord [music] to thy preious leading [music] son. Oh, consecrate me [music] now to thy &gt;&gt; service, Lord. [music] by the power of praise divine. &gt;&gt; Let [music and singing] my soul look up with a steadfast hope and will [music] be [singing] lost in love. &gt;&gt; Draw me near. [music] &gt;&gt; Draw me near me. [singing] Here near a [singing] blessing [music] to the cross where [singing] &gt;&gt; when I die. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh draw me nearer [singing] me. Oh, near a blessed [music] Lord to thy [singing] precious [music] son. Oh, [singing] the beauty [music] light of [singing] a single that before I thrown [music] a spare. Oh, when I need [music] prayer and we [singing] need my God, like your mutest [music] [singing] friend, &gt;&gt; draw me near, [music] &gt;&gt; draw [singing] me nearer, nearer, oh nearer, oh blessing [music] to you. &gt;&gt; That's our desire, Father. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; desire to draw near to you. &gt;&gt; Keep us close to you. &gt;&gt; Nearer, [singing and music] blessed [music and singing] Lord to thy preious [music] son. Verse four, there are [singing] depths of love [music] that I can [singing] know till I cross [music] them sea. There are highs [singing] of joy [music] &gt;&gt; that I made on reach till I [singing] rest [music] in peace with me. Draw me near me. [music] Near [singing] a blessing [music] to the cross where [singing] th has done. Oh draw [music] me nearer nearer nearer. the [singing] blessed [music] Lord to thy preious [singing] [music] leading son. Can we just close our eyes this morning? I'm aware that it's not necessarily a message of shout and but I believe it's important that Lord check our heart and that we become more sincere. Help us father to serve you sincerely father from the bottom of our heart. loving you Lord loving you with all our heart as in a marriage you love [music] that love that girl or that girl love that boy but once they're married doesn't love doesn't diminish [music] or but that love gets should get stronger should get stronger the same way with our lord Jesus Christ desire our love for him to get stronger stronger [music] and to be manifested and how we express our love towards him the prophet says as we have our our heads Bow says, "I pray as God who could only I pray as a man could only pray, Lord, these people will do anything for me as far as to [music] help me. If I was hungry, they would feed me. If I need a suit, they'll buy it. They'd go together and buy me a car to preach the gospel. They do anything in that way. Oh, Father, search their soul this morning. Please do. Let them search it out before you. I don't know. I trust that every one of [music] them is in that elect and put me there too. Lord, if there be any reason in me that I wouldn't be there, Lord, you just reveal it to me. I'll make it right right now. I want to be sure, Lord, that on that morning there will be no trouble at the river. I want to go in that [music] day and I don't know when that will be. It may be yet today. So help me to know, help these people to know. But when we see our heart unconcerned and we enjoy good message to listen to the radio, go to the church. We appreciate a good message. We don't mind speaking of Jesus Christ somewhere. But Lord is sin so burdens to us and it brings tears to our eyes psyching and crying and standing against it. Everything the abomination that did in the city. Lord [clears throat and snorts] let the angel of God see that upon us and mark us. Grant it Lord. means you are sagging. You have that soul travailing Lord look what the world condition of the world but I don't want to re to look like the world I won't want I don't want the world condition the world thinking to be upon me I I want Christ thinking I I want to be completely dedicated to you completely surrendered to you Lord I want to be yielded to you Lord that's my desire Let's sing that song. What is song you're playing? I know it's in French, but nearer near my near my God to thee. Nearer my God to thee. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; meer to thee [music] in all [music] in me cross [music] raises me [music] He all my soul shall be near [music] my God to thee [music] near. My God to thee. me [music] road to thee. Oh, I the one [music] I know the song in French, but I don't know in English.

Draw me closeer [music] [singing] Lord to [music] you for I desire to worship [singing] and oy [music] one more time. Oh Jesus, [singing] draw me close. [music] &gt;&gt; We're close [singing] alone to you. [music] &gt;&gt; Let the world around me fade [singing] your way. [music] Jesus strongly close [music] the Lord to you. [music] &gt;&gt; For I desire to worship and obey. [music] Let each one just speak to the Lord as the music is [music] playing softly. Father Lord, our desire is to be closer to you, Father, to worship you and to obey your word. Our desire, Father Lord, is to fulfill the promise of our time, Father, to be after our father's business to vindicate Malachi 4, Father, to vindicate Revelation 10. Lord, that the bride will take the Buddha book. She will eat it up father to become part of herself and then she will prophesy. She will speak not only the vocal voice but our life will be father the voice the final voice to the final age that our life will match the word of God Jesus Christ. That's what we desire father Lord that we live as a Christian we live father oh God a life that [music] is manifest in Christ.

But Lord, you have challenged us, Lord, to take you at your word to accept your word as a bride, the ragged Christian, Lord, in this LAST AGE, THE OVERCOMERS, NOT on our own strength, but the strength of the Holy Spirit inside of us. Lord, we yield ourselves to you. We accept you. We will [music] stand upon your promise. We stand upon your word not on our own strength, not on our own merit, but upon the merit of the blood of Jesus Christ, upon the merit of the word of of the word of God.

She fully recovered. &gt;&gt; She says she had another issue. her hair is is falling whenever she's washing it. She just want to claim her glory &gt;&gt; her hair as according to the word of God. And third thing the spiritual need says the message of this morning she just want to be dedicated more to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. sometimes uh many distraction but she want to put that aside &gt;&gt; and she just want to serve the Lord more dedicated &gt;&gt; and we thank God for that anoint you with oil according to word of God &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and by his stripes you'll be healed &gt;&gt; let's pray together precious almighty father Lord Jesus Christ father your daughter is coming here Lord to &gt;&gt; father to show on which side she Jesus. She's believing your word of God. Father, you said according to your word, Father, that if they seek, there's any sick among you, let them come, shall anoint them with oil, and shall lay hands upon them and pray for them, Father. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall restore them. And if there is any sin that is associated shall be forgiven, Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we have applied your word, Father. We have obeyed your word, Father. We are placing the token now before you Lord Jesus Christ. May you touch Mama Mati, Father. May she be restored completely. Father, you already paid the price on Calvary. You said by your stripes, Father. She's already healed. Mama Mati is already healed. Father, may you restore her in the name of Jesus Christ. This enemy that is trying to attack her, Father, we rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan is only a bluff. He's already been defeated on the on the cross of Calvary. So we are testing him in the name of Jesus Christ and proclaiming the healing upon our dear sister. By the stripe of the Lord Jesus Christ is already healed. By the stripe of the Lord Jesus Christ is already recovered as according to your word. Father you say shall lay hand on sick and they shall be saved. They shall be recovered. Father healing is the property of the children of God. Jehovah Rafa is still here. Father we are touching the hem of your garment by your by faith. Father and claiming the healing upon our dear sister in the name of Jesus Christ. May you restore her her hair father to your glory. You said father it has been given to her as a covering.
