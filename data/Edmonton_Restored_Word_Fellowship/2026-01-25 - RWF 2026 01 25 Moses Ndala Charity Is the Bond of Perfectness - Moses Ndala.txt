TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Trles vanish, hearts on the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's just a a couple prayer requests here. Some of you I'll ask brother Zig if he can come take these before the Lord. ones for uh for travel mercies for uh Rick and Charlie Pertie as they're driving from Tennessee and also for Brianna uh Archer Lincoln as they're flying back. They're they're they're moving back here areas. So there's a it's forecast there's a storm moving through the eastern United States there. So just pray for their safe travels. And then also for uh brother Dan Courtney who has been uh sick with a bad flu for a couple weeks and I'm sure there's more needs. You can raise your hand if you have a need. Let's just pray together. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful to come into your presence because of the shed blood at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for Calvary. We thank you for coming, Lord, becoming a man, Lord, like we heard this morning, Lord, just a few minutes ago. You became the amorph of a man, Lord. And we praise you for that. And now you've come, Lord, in the form of the Holy Spirit to dwell in your people, Lord. And here we are, Lord, your people. And I believe that by the spirit of the Lord, by the Holy Ghost, we are you are living inside of us, Lord. And we're here to worship you, Lord, to praise your name, to hear your word, glorify your name. We want to have the right attitude. We want to just receive every word of God that proceeds out of the mouth of God. And this morning, Lord, we have different prayer requests, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, we pray, oh, for brother for sister Wendy's and brother Blaine's um children, Lord, as they're traveling, Lord, that would you be with them and and by them, Lord God, protect them and shield them, Lord. The weather is stormy, but Lord Jesus, when the angels of God are with us, Lord Jesus, there's nothing for us to fear. We believe that you take care of them, Lord. So we ask, Lord, take care of them, Father, in the name of Jesus, and the different requests here, Lord, that I have here. Uh, Brother Dan Courtney has been sick for with a bad flu, Lord God. There's a lot of flu going around, Lord, but you're our healer, Lord. And and we trust in you in every detail, even small things, big things, large things, Lord. We just trust in you, our wonderful heavenly father. We worship you and praise your wonderful name in the name of Jesus. Hallelujah Lord. And I'm sure there's more requests, Lord. Different people have needs, Lord, this morning. I pray that you would meet every need this morning, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Glory to thy wonderful name. I didn't get all the details of the request, but Lord Jesus, you know every detail. We worship you and we praise you and thank you for that we can be here gathered together as a family of God just worshiping you and glorifying your name because we all have the same names Jesus. And so we thank you for that Lord. Bless our brother Moses Lord as he comes and ministers the word of God. May may have such liberty and may Lord he speak directly to our hearts. Lord, we pray we we believe Lord that you are still speaking through the channel of the ministry. And so we Lord Jesus commit ourselves to you. Bless brother Andrew as he as he leads us in service. May he be led to sing the right songs and may your name be glorified. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah to your wonderful name. Thank you for saving me. Thank you Lord Jesus for predestinating me before the foundation of the world. We praise you this morning in Jesus name. Amen. And the people said &gt;&gt; isn't Lord wonderful. You can have your seats if you like. We'll sing uh this this next song. Pass me not gentle savior. Then maybe we'll have sister Kathy and sister Pass me not, oh gentle Savior, hear my humble cry. While on others thou are calling, &gt;&gt; do not pass thee by &gt;&gt; Savior. Savior, &gt;&gt; hear my humble cry.

Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. The kingoms of my heart in my heart are kingdoms of a world that's all my own kingdoms that are only seen by myself and God alone. In the past, when I tried to rule my world, it just seemed to fall aart. So please Jesus be the Lord of all the kingoms of my heart. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all the kingoms of my heart. I guess I only f myself when I said that I had yielded it all. Yet in the secret corners of my heart was a kingom that did not fall. I surrender now.

For if you're not lord of everything. For if you're not lord of everything, then you're not Lord at all. Amen. Thank you. I was just thinking about those some of those songs we we s earlier and it's just you a a lot of times we we we have to have a secret place and then but in that secret place is where we find value and like inside of a bank you have like most banks have like a a vault I guess and you go in there and that's That's where you store everything you have treasure. That's where you go to inspect it. &gt;&gt; And I just Yeah. We want him to be lord of all. We want him to to come and be in that innermost and we can expect inspect those things and we can look at those things and like yes this is this is where my value lies. This is where not just where I store value but the value that's in me is held in that inner place. Who am I Lord? Who am I? Glorious victory. The day he set me free and made my heart, his very throne. My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine. And now I live &gt;&gt; to praise his name. &gt;&gt; Who am I, Lord? Who I am? &gt;&gt; I can see now who I am. I'm a part of my Savior, a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. Let's stand on Calary. He died to redeem his lost. The King of Kings, became my Savior. is God's great mystery of love expressed to me that Christ and I might be set free. &gt;&gt; So who am I? Who I am? I can see now who I am. I'm a part of my savior, a part of his word. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of who I am. &gt;&gt; Victory the day he set me free and made my heart his very throne. My life is no longer mine.

Father, Lord, we are thankful to be in your house once more, one more time this morning, Lord, to have fellowship one another around the revealed word of the hour.

Father, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Let this morning, Lord, just we spend five minutes in your presence that will change our life, we change our directions, we change our decisions, Lord, we change out the situations in our life, Father.

Father will be a special anointing that will sweep this this church will sweep our house will sweep father even our soul as brother expressed it earlier Lord the inner part of our whole being Lord where the treasure of the presence of God shall remain. Father that's where we desire to be. Thank you father for your faithfulness. Lord remember those who are sick those could not make it. May also be with them and touch them. Your presence be with them father. Help me father to deliver the few thoughts that you put in my heart and bless the people as we commit oursel to you in Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. God bless you richly. Thank you brother Andrew. Peter, brother Caleb. Amen. Invite you to go to the word of God. I'll just touch a little bit on the love of God one more time. is it's a subject we can never finish but might have a little bit of repetition of some of the thoughts but I just thought to myself if it's the most important thing that we need then I think it deserves at least two services on it if it's the most important thing so just let's speak a little bit about it and um Colossians 3. I will read verse 14. I'll let you sit and then I'll read the whole part that I want you to read. Colossians 3 verse 14. Colossians comes up the Philippians and Ephesians and so if you're there Colossians 3 verse 14 above all these things so above all these things means there are certain things that are very important are very good but above all those things put on charity which is agapo which is the love of God which is the bond of perfectness the bond of perfection is found into charity. Amen. God bless his word. Can have a seat this morning. Welcome the visitors among us and God bless you richly. I think we have one brother from all our brother Samuel. Where are you? God bless you Richley. Welcome here. Good to have you. I stay where papa mama my mamaishi there god bless them richly and comes from all it's good if you stay longer here brother bless you and also we have brother brother Daniel from now we have to call you from lebridge right used to be from Edmonton now he's from Lebridge so just good to have him god bless him richly keeping keep brother brother Gabriel in prayer and his daughter was just sick and he's been hospital couple of times and yesterday they have to put a little bit of profusion for the daughter but his home has been in contact with him and just keep him in prayer and the family in prayer. My little boy is also sick this morning. He's not feeling well so he stayed home but um the Lord is the healer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just want to read Colossians 3:105. Bible says and and have put on have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian skitian or I don't know how to say that but bond or free but Christ is All and all in and in all. Christ is all and in all. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the song said that that we just need him to have the primance. He's the God of all. Want to have the preminence in everything. Amen. Then it says, "Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another. If any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye." This verse is very, very important. I don't think we we are at that level yet or maybe we are there but we need more of that &gt;&gt; where we can forgive as Christ has forgiven us and that's what we have to do. It says above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your heart to the which to the which also you are called in one body and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. The name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the father by him. Wives, submit yourself unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives. Do not bitter. Do not be and be not bitter against them. Children, obey your parents in all things. And this is well pleasing unto the Lord. Fathers, remember it's not saying mothers, but say fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. servant, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with I eye service as man pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. And whatsoever you do, do it heartly as to the Lord and not unto man, knowing that the Lord is knowing that of the Lord, you shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for you serve the Lord Christ. But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he had done and there is no respect of persons. Amen. May God bless his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is just wonderful scripture and the prophet says you know as the Bible says that the absolute we just say amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to want to continue and put the title this morning. Charity is the bond of perfectness. Charity is the bond of perfectness as we go through many times and perfect we went through many times with but perfect does not mean that you have you are sinless or in the sense that you have no mistakes no no no failures but as a human being that means you have come to complete you are fulfilled you're fulfilled you're mature uh uh uh per perfectness mean perfection in God's eyes again God looks at you, he sees that you have no sin. As you if you have never sinned and for the past sins, for the present, for the future, but as a as a human beings, we have failures. We fail all time. We die daily. Amen. &gt;&gt; But at least we have to grow. We have to come to the place where we become stable. We become mature. We know where we are. And love is what holds all the virtues together. As they say, Christ charity is the bond of perfectness. Means love is what holds all the virtue together. Is what brings you to maturity. It holds all the different parts of the body together. I would say not only it holds them together but it is also what helps them to grow together and keep them together at the same time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to skip few things here but uh just want to get to the place where I have to say um the prophet says somebody told me and say well preacher I don't know the Greek words and I said and I said you you don't know the Bible right so he's claiming to prophet you don't know the Bible right and says if you know the words don't mean this it means that and I said brother I know the author better than I know his book &gt;&gt; says my my problem is not about to know to know the word the letters although it's important part of the st of a perfect man but that should not be that should not be the focus sometimes you think okay you know I know it so well that that know I don't need to learn anything else no it says you need to know the author the author of the word of god that's what is more important listen how the prophet Phet says, "Amen. I rather have the order anyhow, any time. His book is fine. That's right. But I'd rather know the order of the word of God." Wouldn't you? And you know him. How do you know him? You know him by love. You know God by love, the Holy Spirit. I'm just saying we are living off that one thing that's more important than all. It's the love of God. Amen. That make us one one in Christ Jesus. Amen. So the love of God is so important and we need to cry for it. We need to pray for it. We need God give me more of your love than anything else. The pure love of God that only the Holy Spirit can give. That's what I desire. That you give to me the love of God inside of my heart. The love of God is God himself. The love of God is not is not only something that you can learn, something you can practice, not something you can you you can you can even imitate. It's not something you can manufacture. It has to come through the Holy Spirit. Only the Holy Spirit can give you the true love of God in the heart. And that's what we desire. God, fill me with your Holy Spirit and let it create the love of God inside of my heart. And it will be manifested itself by the way I speak, the way I love you, the way I dedicate myself, the way the the way I'm in connection. I desire the fellowship with you. That's how the love of God is going to be manifested. How I forgive my brother. I forgive my sister. I want the love of God to take over over then and then my than my emotion, then my feeling, then my thinking, than my my my lecturing, than my theology. I want the love of God to have the full preminence. Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it's the desire as well. The prophet says, the Bible says, the Bible says Israel knew the works of God, but they did not know his ways. That's what the Bible says. It says Psalm 103 says, "The Lord exe executive righteousness and judgment for all that oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, his act unto the children of Israel." So God made his ways unto Moses and his act unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and planters in mercy. I will say is Israel the people they knew exactly what the works of God. They knew the miracles. They saw the deliverances. They saw how God displayed his power through Moses. They saw the the the 10 plagues. They they saw all the miracles, the mighty. It was actually the creative word of God. It will create the flies. It will create recre. THEY SAW THAT THEY THEY EXPERIENCED IT. THEY they they saw the work of God. They saw the Red Sea being split. Amen. They saw how they walked they walked through dry land through the Red Sea. They saw the Egyptian to drown. They saw the when they on the other side they saw the the word of marriage it was beaten. It became sweet. They saw all the great things. Amen. But they didn't know they still did not understand the way of God. They don't understand the ways of God. So we we don't I pray that we we we don't just stay and look at the works of God and we don't understand the heart of God. The heart of GOD IS LOVE. AMEN. THE HEART OF GOD IS FORGIVENESS. The heart of God is mercy. The heart of God is redemption. THE HEART OF GOD IS TO come to relationship WITH HIM. AMEN. THAT THAT'S ALL THAT GOD IS DOING. GOD ALL GOD HAS HAS DONE EVEN IN LIFE of brother Bon in the first pool in the second pool EVEN IN THE THIRD POOL THE opening of the word IS ALL THE DESIRE IS TO EXPRESS HIS LOVE. GOD WANT THAT LOVE TO THAT FOR us to understand his love. Amen. To have the revelation of his love but ALSO NOT THAT ONLY the love to stay to him. He want that love to come into our heart. ISRAEL SAW THAT THEY SAW THE MIRACLES but they didn't understand the way of God. But listen to how the prophet God gave the the the the the promise to the prophet says because that has chosen the narrow path, the hard way that hath walked in your own choosing that has picked the correct and precise decision. The prophet say at many places I think would say no Moses had to make his own choice. Amen. He had to to choose and he had to he had to say no. You know what I I appreciate the word of God. I appreciate Christ. I take the reproach of Christ more than the the riches of of Egypt. I accept what the word of God says more than the riches of Egypt. And the and the prophet had to make also a choice and he made the hard choice. He says that he picked out the correct and precise decision and it is my way. &gt;&gt; How many wants God's way? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want God's way. This and God says this is my way. It might be hard. IT MIGHT BE HARSH. IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT. But as long as it's God's way, I want to stay in God's way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So because of this momentous decision, a huge portion of heaven will await thee. What of a glorious decision that has made this in itself that which is will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine. &gt;&gt; HOW WE GOING TO HAVE THE VICTORY in time? Through the love divine. THROUGH THE DECISION that you are making by staying God's way and the love divine is going to take the preminence in our life. Amen. I'll say this. HOW MANY HAVE CHOSEN the Lord Jesus Christ by the way of this message? &gt;&gt; How many has accepted the Lord Jesus Christ? Say God I thank you for the message of the hour. I thank you FOR THE WORD OF GOD. I THANK YOU FOR THE UNVEILING OF GOD. I THANK YOU FOR THE INVISIBLE UNION. THANK GOD FOR THE WAY OF GOD. I THANK YOU FOR YOU COMING DOWN TO MY LEVEL. I THANK YOU FOR THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. I THANK YOU FOR THE BLEEDING WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; This message of the living truth to the whole Bible is not sometimes an easy way. Sometimes it is a hard way. In the midst of the Leodyian age, we are fighting a battle. We are fighting a battle in Laia where the trend of Laia is pushing in one way and you have to find your own way through that which is not your own way. It's actually God's way. &gt;&gt; But it's harder. IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER. IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER. ONLY THE LOVE OF GOD is going to prevail. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you have made the right choice because of that decision. This message will bring to pass the tremendous victory in love divine. You can receive your healing in this in this tremendous victory in love divine. How many believe that is God the god of paradox? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God is a god of paradox. &gt;&gt; As I was listening to the message of love or the message of brother love and I've just as I've just been been on it and he's just been speaking to my taking simple examples just simple example. You see that the aposum that came to me came to me that a person had the revelation of the word of God revelation of the prophet of the age the revelation of the gift that God has given in our time that and if an animal that doesn't have a soul could have revelation of where the gift of God was. &gt;&gt; Oh how much more a human being with a soul should have the revelation of where the gift of God is. that opposome recognize it and because of the love that she had for her own children, God says God's love was projected and God's grace had to come and intervene. Amen. If God's love was projected in an animal and it produced healing, how much more the love of God, if it is projected on a human being, can it produce healing IN OUR BODIES? AMEN. CAN IT PRODUCE HEALING IN OUR MIND? THE GOD IS STILL THE SAME YESTERDAY, today and forever. THOSE ARE NOT ONLY STORIES. THEY ARE REALITY. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED. IT SHOULD have it has the same power. OH GOD, HELP US TO CHANGE our attitude and to take you at your WORD TO ACCEPT THE LOVE OF GOD THAT HAS BEEN PROJECTING OUR AGE. THANK GOD FOR THE GIFT YOU HAVE SENT, BUT THANK GOD FOR THE WORD OF GOD THAT YOU HAVE SENT because the word of God is the love of God expressed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that we take another example example of the of of brother Bert and went and him and hunting for the brother Bert but about was a cruel man &gt;&gt; and and nothing could change him. He saw he saw things he saw different things. So evangelist evangelizing to him but that couldn't change his heart. His heart was just so hard. But one time he went with the prophet and I like sometime the attitude of the prophet. He didn't know he's an unbeliever and no he sometimes he he knew that God would work with him somehow. &gt;&gt; God has a different god is gods of paradox. Amen. As he goes through there and and he he has his whistle and brother saying you you can't use that whistle because he was just mean just killing all the animals just for fun sometimes to hurt the prophet and because he was a Christian. You are just you're so tender. When God is in your heart, you become tender. Sometimes you know small things that other people don't see, but you just become small. Even even to animals, I can't just kill any animal. No, you you you kill him if you only if you want if you have to eat it. Just don't kill it for the for fun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the prophet has that sensitivity. I think the Holy Ghost has that sensitivity. Amen. Just kill. I don't kill just for the sake of killing. and and and he went there and and and brother Bird uh they were looking for for for hunting and they couldn't find so he had to blow his whistle and blew his whistle and a little phone came out a little animal came out. Amen. And uh and and the mother the mother door came out looking for the little one because he was looking for the baby. Amen. and he came out and see us looking for the baby and brother Bird saw this my occasion in two young young sisters young brothers these are not old stories there's a reality behind it &gt;&gt; and he took the his gun and okay I'm going to charge and that mother doll is not running away and brother Bam says that that's not normal normally that that animal has to run away and they don't even come but during that time they don't come out but that one could not go could not run away why because he had a love for the baby that the love of a mother for the baby this we are talking about an animal that doesn't have a soul even an animal that doesn't have a soul can still have the love of God expressed at this level amen because still still is the creation of God expressed at this level I'm If that could express on that, how much should it be on a human being? &gt;&gt; As brother Bird looked at and and charge on the mother say he's going to blow his heart. The prophet says, "I don't want to look at it." And and brother Bird and try to charge doesn't go. Try to charge doesn't go. Says, "No, this is something more powerful." &gt;&gt; He threw his gun. Said, "Brother, brother Branam, can you pray for me? I give my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did he give his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ? Prophet say because he saw something genuine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something real, something that you you can't put on that door. You can't you can't put you can't you can't you can't manufacture it. It has to come from the inside. Just become something real. LORD, I WANT something real in MY HEART. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT SOMETHING TO put on. I don't want something to imitate. I want something real from heart. People are dying for the real love of God. For the reality of the love of God in the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No one know the prophet who referred to Moses. When Israel sinned against God by taking the idol, God was about to wipe them away. In Exodus 32 verse 30 says, "It came to pass on the tomorrow that Moses said unto the people, you have seen the great scene, and now I will go up unto the Lord, but eventually I shall make an atonement for your sin." And Moses returned unto the Lord and said, "Oh, these people have seen the great sin and have made them gods of gold. And now yet now if thou w forgive thy sin and if not blow me blot me I pray thee out of thy book without which thou hast written. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Whosoever had sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book." I believe Moses knew the way of God. He didn't only see the works of God, but he knew the way of God. He knew the very love of God, the very heart of God. As the prophet will say, only the prophet could say that says, "How come I used to wonder I used to wonder how Moses could give God a better idea than God himself?" How could God how could Moses bring to God something to the point where God had to come and repent and repent of what he was about to do? Let's just go through that to a little minute. The prophet says in the soul that in prison now the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in his church in these last days is a wonderful God. The ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in his church in these last days. So we have not only we have not we have not received only a ministry uh that is similar to the ministry of Jesus Christ but we have received the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in the church in this last days. &gt;&gt; Why? To bring us to the statue of the perfect man. There's nothing that can give you that can bring you higher than what is come to visit you. If a ministry comes and visit that generation is to bring that generation to the statue of what the ministry was brought to. Amen. Are you following that principle? If they come Luther come with justification is to bring the age to justification. Amen. If Wesley come with sanctification is to bring the is to bring the church to sanctification. If a brother banham came the first pool and the second pool to bring to the bring to the the gift to the to the gift of Pentecost to the TO THE BROTHERLY LOVE it's because the church has to come to that statue of the per to that statue that God wanted FOR THAT AGE. NOW IF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST COMES amen through the word of God how many believe that lord the word of God is Jesus Christ. If the ministry of Jesus CHRIST HAS BEEN DISPLAYED ONE MORE TIME IS TO BRING THE BRIDE TO come to the stem statue. Amen. so that we can become the the chief THE MASTERPIECE TO BECOME THE REFLECTION of Jesus Christ TO COME TO THE STATUE OF JESUS CHRIST. THE BRIDE HAS TO BE AT THE SAME level as Jesus CHRIST &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FOR THE RAPTURE TO HAPPEN YOU HAVE TO BECOME THE WORD AS HE IS THE WORD. SO WE THANK GOD FOR THE VISITATION OF THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST. IT'S NOT ONLY THE MINISTRY OF A MAN. IS not the MINISTRY OF A PROPHET BUT IS THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN. THAT'S WHY IT IS A SON OF MAN REVEALING THE SON OF MAN. THE SON OF MAN HAS TO TAKE A VESSEL in order for him TO SPEAK TO THE BRIDE TO BRING THE BRIDE AT THE SAME level that himself is. Amen. So that the rapture can take away THE MAGNET. THE BIG MAGNET HAS ALREADY STARTED COMING. AMEN. IT'S NOT A MAN WHO CALLED YOU. It's not a minister called you. IS THE CALLING OF THE BRIDE TO THE BRIDEGROOM HIMSELF AND HIMSELF IS CALLING YOU. AMEN. The Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just one statement but just powerful statement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in this church in this last day. &gt;&gt; So the third pool it was not the opening of the word getting away with my note but I think just put it an opportunity. the opening of the word to open the seals. It's not brother Bam who open the seals because only the lamp could open the seals. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Banam himself and you say be spiritual here. He go and studies he will prepare and then put his and he put his notes together. You read and put all the things together and that was the that was the man's anointing. That what he could have done. But when the angel come down and give him the revelation says no I would have made a big mistake if the angel didn't come &gt;&gt; if the mighty angel didn't come and reveal the thought for the bride because this ministry is not about is not even not a ministry only only of a or say it's not a ministry only an evangelist for the ministry of an of a of a local prophet but the ministry of God himself using a vessel that God could express himself. &gt;&gt; That's the message we HAVE RECEIVED. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE of the hour. &gt;&gt; Bring it to the bride to the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; That's what many of us believe. He says, "I believe with you. I believe this. If I didn't believe it, I didn't do something else about it." Because after all, that's that's concerning here. If the spirit of God, the spirit of God be in you, you are concerned about the people. That was a scripture that also puzzled me how that Moses could tell God a better idea than God had. Till I found out that it was the spirit of Christ in Moses. &gt;&gt; God said, "Moses, separate yourself from them. I'll destroy the whole thing and start with you." And he said, "Lord," he throwed himself in the bridge and said, "Take me. Blot out my name." Of these very people that had rebelled, his heart went for them. When a minister that got the people in his heart, how could he ever feel justified to my and an infinite sentence say before God or to myself to ever hold anything back from a people that you love better than you love yourself? How could a man take a person into the church by a hand join or some sprinkle, some false baptism or something? Let them lay under the influence of a liar and know the Bible less there and say he loves the person and said though I have to beg for my living whatever it is let me be honest honest with God and with the people to tell them the truth never let me be a deceiver how can I deceive who I live I love though I have to hurt them yet I love them that's the reason you spank your child it's because you love him not because you don't like him because you love him. If he's wrong, you'll get killed if you don't correct him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Moses many good principle on that. God Moses had to step in on the bridge for others. That's the love of God. The love of God can never wish someone to be to to be lost. If no matter what the person has done to you, no matter what what disagreement you have, no matter HOW CRUEL THEY HAVE to be to they have been to you, you can never wish someone else to be lost. There will always be a desire for that person to be saved. You will do everything for that person to be saved because if Christ inside of you, you will have the desire for redemption FOR SOMEONE ELSE. AMEN. MAY GOD HELP US TO HAVE THE ATTITUDE. LORD, give me SO MUCH OF YOUR LOVE TO THE POINT EVEN ON LOVING MY enemies because I want his salvation. Let me even be able to stay IN THE BRIDGE AND ACCEPT EVERYTHING BECAUSE I want his redemption. I WANT HER REDEMPTION. IF YOU DIED FOR ME, HELP ME TO DIE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. LORD, GIVE ME THAT HEART THAT CAN STAND IN THE BRIDGE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE SO HARD on Moses. So hard ON MOSES. BUT IN THAT TIME THAT WERE ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED, MOSES STOOD AND STANDING AND PREACH. OH GOD, INSTEAD OF KILLING THEM, KILL ME, LORD. KILL ME. &gt;&gt; And God himself look at that says, "No, that actually my representation of my of myself." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look in the Bible. God repented. Mhm. &gt;&gt; One minister says you can bring God to repentance. I don't have that boldness to say but it was just nice the way he put it. So you can BRING GOD TO REPENT. THE BIBLE SAYS GOD REPENTED. IF GOD REPENTED, WHAT CAN MAKE GOD REPENT? THE WORD of God. But actually is a little bit right. If you take the word of God to God, God cannot deny his own word. &gt;&gt; God will always GO WITH HIS OWN WORD. THANK GOD FOR THE WORD OF THE HOUR. THAT'S WHY THE CAPSTONE CAME THE OPENING OF THE WORD SO THAT WE KNOW THE MIND OF CHRIST. We know THE WORD OF GOD. WE KNOW WHAT HE WANTS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But at the same time, the prophet says, "Sometimes I can be hard. But it's not because I hate you, but because I love you." &gt;&gt; Love of God sometimes can be or not. Sometimes the love of God is corrective all the time. Let me just put a little bit of note on that. The reason sometimes people think I get rough with people bowling them out is not because I don't love you. It's because I do love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What if your little boy was sitting out in the street and you said, "Junior, dear, you know, it's okay. You cannot say it's fine. You shouldn't sit out there. You know, daddy don't want you." No, you better you you better you better strip the and the prophet says, "No, you better strip the hide off of him if you love him." I wanted to say a soft way, but say you BETTER STRIP THE HIDE OFF OF HIM IF you love him. Keep him off of that street. Real love is corrective. Genuine love is corrective. &gt;&gt; Amen. What if your wife was running around with some other man and you say you know de I hope you had a good time but uh really I don't think uh you should do it you know honey I love you so the brother says if you have that attitude but himself say she ought to kick you out of the door real love is corrective and places a posterior pro protolasma stimul ulation is that way the way it's pronounced he say that what it would be if that was sometimes you have to give the church not because you don't like junior but because you do like junior love is corrective and Jesus wasn't evil with them he loved them he must correct them &gt;&gt; so I'm putting this I don't want to just just just just to put it in maybe in a carnal way but I say put it spiritually speaking I thank God for the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word of God corrects me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want God the God doesn't want me to stay in error. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want me to continue in that error in that ignorance. No. The love of God came to me to help me to change my direction because God loves me. God want to correct us in a nice way with love. We we with with the right attitude. The correction of God is not for judgment. Is not for condemnation. is not to put you down. Is not is not to show you that you are nothing. The correction of God is to bring you to the la to to the revelation of how much he loves you because he does not want to lose you. Amen. The same thing for us our parents. You don't chastise your child just for the sake of chastising him. Sometimes you chastise HIM AND YOU KNOW HOW sometimes if you have had the Holy Spirit you don't just you know sometimes let me just you know put you in the door that's opening. You don't correct them. Sometime we don't correct your children when we are an under anger &gt;&gt; anger &gt;&gt; anger and hunger both maybe don't do that don't do that because you might correct him more than than than it than than he should. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The right attitude sometimes you you calm down &gt;&gt; calm down. Okay here my nerves my temper is just calm down. You might even some attitude I'm shout some you know you have little kids sometime you shout and then but you take your time and then after you call him you talk to him say you know I'm going to punish you because of this this this because it's not it's it's not the punishment or how hard it is that make them change &gt;&gt; is the attitude is make them understand is the love that you express to them then they will correct themselves. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes sometimes sometimes you know how hard you beat them but you need to have a little bit of wisdom just the door that's open you know I did not prepare that but on this way but a little bit of wisd use a little bit of wisdom God help me to help me to talk to him. My Paul David is the hardest. When he was younger, he will, you know, you hit him. Other times, even Is he sleeping? Yeah, he's awake. Sometimes he does something wrong. He's even bringing you what you are going to hit him with because that's not what is changing him. That's not changing me, daddy. Then you don't know what to do if you because Then you have to find another way. God's grace. But you want him to be better. It's not it's not you don't punish him just for the sake of punishing or hitting him hard. It's the love of God. &gt;&gt; There is no not there is nothing of such great power, such great force than the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise be to God. There's so many things we can say on the love of God. But prophet says Moses threw himself in the path of God's rife. Take me and not the people that he had called rebels. Rebellion against God and against him. Yet he loved them so much till he said, "Take me. Save save them." That was Christ in Moses. If a man, no matter how much some other one would disagree with him, if he doesn't feel that way, then there is a lacking of Christ. I believe it's from the from his heart. Not his lips, but from his heart. If he doesn't feel that way towards humanity. So I'll say agap love is not manifested when people are in one accord with you. When everything is fine. Is not when you test and see if agap love is there. Love is tested and manifested when things go wrong. When you don't see the same way. Amen. When things when when people hurt you, when something is is going against your per your will, then that's when you see the manifestation of agapa or love. As we see the story of Joseph, it shows it so well. He heard them discussing how they kill, how they will kill him, how they wanted to kill him. He heard them, he heard them, they were doing all these things. He saw them how they were selling him, how they were mocking him. We receive if your dream is going to be manifested. We receive that if you see what you have been telling us, you're going to be manifested. BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SELLING HIM, THEY WERE PUTTING HIM AWAY. MAN, GOD WAS FULFILLING the same dream. IT WAS THE WAY OF GOD TO FULFILL THAT SAME DREAM. BUT WHEN GOD WHEN GOD PUT JOSEPH at the right position, you see Joseph didn't keep any bitterness against his brother. God. Joseph forgave his brother. Joseph manifested to them the perfect love of God. The prophet would say Joseph was a type of perfection. Perfection. Oh, let him say perfection doesn't mean that you don't have any sin, but perfection SHOWS MATURITY. JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD AND TOLD HIS BROTHER, YOU THOUGHT EVIL AGAINST ME, BUT GOD meant unto good to bring to pass in these days to save much people alive. A mature Christians doesn't doesn't discern things or judge things by the circumstances. A mature Christian knows that God is in control of every situation. SO YOU DON'T RESPOND EVIL WITH EVIL. YOU DON'T RESPOND HURT WITH HURT, BUT YOU RESPOND TO ANYTHING NEGATIVE. YOU RESPOND WITH THE LOVE OF GOD BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LOVE OF GOD IS ABOVE ANYTHING. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING. AMEN. AS THE PROPHET SAYS, LOVE, GOD'S LOVE, love is the most powerful thing that there is in the world. IT CONQUERS ANYTHING. IT CONQUERS ANYTHING IS LOVE. But if you shall conquer by love, divine, loving one another, loving the cause of God, loving Christ, loving suffering humanity. That is how YOU CONQUER. HOW CAN YOU CONQUER? By the love of God. God, give me more of your love. Amen. always like this storyendo spoke on it on the respect prophet says in respect you can't disrespect God you have to respect God &gt;&gt; if you don't believe it just keep still keep away from it or either do that or some reverent come reverently and respect it don't make fun of people in the spirit don't talk about people that worshiping in the spirit of God. Laid I'm alone. I was standing right there in the corner preaching some years ago as a boy preacher and there was a woman came by and she was Catholic by faith and I know her. Her her husband was Catholic. She wasn't nothing. Say very handsome, pretty woman, nicel looking about 20 years old, 22. I knew her as a girl here in the city. So she came by and stood there and said I wouldn't let my pet cow have that religion that William Branham's God. And the next night, the next night before I could get to her, I heard she was dying in the hospital. &gt;&gt; And I don't know yet what killed her. &gt;&gt; She was dying down there in the hospital and husband came came to get me. And he said he was a Catholic and he came and said, "Come quickly, say a prayer for my wife. She's been calling for you all evening. She's dying." She was disrespectful towards God's servant &gt;&gt; and and God struck her &gt;&gt; and and she was dying and then she realized when her senses you know she used to think she was intelligent and everything and it doesn't even if she had a a a pet cow she would allow to listen to that kind of but when at the time of death she start thinking oh oh now realize I made a mistake &gt;&gt; oh uh call call that man of God and call that she become desperate she become desperate but as negative this story is and but I I like the portion of the prophet part his attitude when they called him he didn't stay and say you know what you know she deserve what she did you know that's a problem that that that that you know she she get she get what she she sold and no as they called him he RUSHED HE RUSHED RUN. He did ALL HIS BEST TO GET AT THE PLACE BEFORE SHE DIED. And that's the expression OF THE LOVE OF GOD. NO MATTER WHAT HOW HARD SHE WAS ON HIM, NO MATTER WHAT SHE DID, NOT THE MISTAKE WHAT SHE MADE, GOD, HE RAN, HE RAN, HE RAN. But unfortunately before arrived there, she already passed. &gt;&gt; They say, "Oh, God." And the husband says, "But still pray for now." They say it won't make any different because she already passed. But still the attitude was not to leave her alone you not to say no you know he criticizes me he said something bad about me or the thing then you know I can't I I don't no still God give me that love that I can still go towards him I can still stay in the bridge for him I can still pray for him I can still pray for her amen &gt;&gt; that's WHAT THE MESSAGE CAME TO do &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For me, the best definition agap love is the ability or the love God gives a person to desire salvation for another person despite any other external circumstances. &gt;&gt; As long as there have a breath of life, I want him to be saved. I want her to be saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking the experience of the other side says I felt something lick my hand in the fifth seal. There was my old kund dog Mr. Short. Mr. Short poisoned him. I saw I saw that I would kill Mr. Short for it. I was about 16 years old. He poisoned him. He gave him a dog button and my daddy caught me with a rife going down to shoot him. right in the police station. I said, "I'll kill him." I went over to the dog's grave. I buried him. I said, "Fritz, you've been like a companion to me. You've cloed me and you sent me to school. When you got hold, I was going to take care of you. Now they've killed you." I said, "I promise you, Fritz, that he won't leave. Mr. Short won't leave." I said, "I promise you he won't leave. I'll catch him on the street someday walking then I'll run right over him. See, I said I'll get him for you. But you know what? That was the man speaking. &gt;&gt; That's the part with you that the filio love may be speaking there. But agap love has not taken over yet. &gt;&gt; But once you receive the Holy Ghost, once you realize, oh no, there's more something important than than even sometime the natural things. and and and he went to him and the prophet says, "And you know what? I led Mr. Mr. Short to Christ and I baptized him in Jesus name and I even buried him at his death." Yes, sir. I got converted about two years after that. I've seen things different then. I loved him instead of hating him. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. That's the love of God I desire in my heart. Not revenge, not anything. Not no not no not no not no not no not no not no not no not no not no not no no no no not no no no no not no no no not no no no not no no no no not no no no not no no no not no no no not no no no not no no no not not her no not not tooth for tooth and foot for what no beyond that Lord I I I I forget all the past I forget all that let me love that person I want him to be saved let me bring HIM TO CHRIST AMEN PRAISE BE TO GOD &gt;&gt; and God because even of that I believe because even of that God gave him fruit on the other side that's the message we have received the grace of God I don't understand how an animal without The soul can be part of the body change. I I don't ask me a question, but I just believe that it's possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you have a little pet. Oh, praise be to God. Your pet might be on the other side, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the power of the message of the hour. If it can do that FOR ANIMAL, HOW MUCH MORE for those who are the soul OF GOD, THE NATURE OF GOD INSIDE OF THEM, YOU CAN PRAY FOR YOUR CHILDREN. AMEN. BECAUSE GOD CAN RESTORE YOUR CHILDREN. BECAUSE IF GOD CAN GIVE ETERNAL LIFE TO A TO A DOG, GOD CAN GIVE ETERNAL LIFE TO A HUMAN BEING, YOUR OWN CHILDREN. We are under THE ATMOSPHERE OF PERFECT LOVE. NOW &gt;&gt; PROJECT YOUR PERFECT LOVE. PROJECT THE LOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING of greater force than the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. James 5:1 19:20. Brethren, if any of you do er from the truth and one convert him, let him know that he that which converted the sinner from the error of his ways shall save a soul from death and shall hide the multitude of sins. The hide here in the the word is means to cover, not to expose but to cover. But I believe not only to cover it, but God will forgive his sins. God will justify him as if he has never done it to begin with. The love of God in action is restoration. is not humiliation. The love of God is to restore the other person. Even if someone falls, the love of God, your desire is to restore him. Your desire is to lift him up. Your desire is to bring him out. Amen. If God love pushed you, God love pushed God, constrain God to come down. Amen. I believe that God's love in our heart help others also to come up. Amen. 1 Peter 4:3 says, "Love above all things. Have fervent charity among yourself, for charity shall cover the multitude of sins." Amen. Above all means above any other things. What is above other things, you need to have love of God. Now, covering that means covering never means it doesn't mean you ignore evil or you excuse unrepentance or you pretend that sin does not matter or sin does not exist. That's false love. Is it okay if I go this way a little bit? Sometimes, you know, see ah no, no, just cover it. That's not what it means. Covering. Covering doesn't mean you ignore sins or you pretend that sin doesn't exist. But covering covering means you you bring that person under Christ and Christ will cover everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. People say because sometimes we have a false impression of what real love is. Amen. &gt;&gt; People say he's too good. God is too good. He's too good to do it. God is so good. Prophet says, "I believe that God is good." A teenage boy said not long ago in our town in presuming the prophecy in our city, he said, "You know what?" HE SAID, "GOD IS SO GOOD, brother Bam." He said, "You know, God is so good. He just let me do anything." He said, "I don't care. He doesn't care. He doesn't mind because God is so good to me." Prophecies and nonsense. Nonsense. God is good God. We hear so much about him being a good God. And I believe he's a good God. I said, "That's right. He's a good God. But if he's a good God, is God to be a just God, too. He can't give us a commandment to do something another and and and and then to do something another and we disobey it and expect to escape the judgment. He's also a god of wrath, a god of judgment. That what makes him a good God because he keeps his word. He watches over it. Amen. So we can't expect to do wrong and these things that we do and get by with it. No. No. We just is not is not is not so. No, it's good. That's true. But I don't want you I don't want you to misunderstand me. God is a good God. That is exactly right. Remember the only way he can be God, he can be good is to be just. If he's just, if he's just, he has to keep his own commandment. If he keep his commandment, if if he keeps his commandment, it's wrong for Christian tolerate with the world or tolerate the world. It's wrong. We shouldn't do it. We are to be a different person. We are only venturing out presuming it without actual authority. God's words give us the authority that the authority we should stand on is what God said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep a little balance here. I like the way the prophet puts sometimes a balance for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes we can go on one way and God is just so good and say now God is good but God is also a God who's righteous. That's why Moses could come and stay in the bridge there because he put the word of God to God. God, you prom you promised to Abraham that you shall give him a seed and you shall give them inheritance. So God, you can't destroy what you already you already promised. That's your word, Lord. And if you want a blessing from God, put the word of God in front of God. Amen. That what Jacob came to God too when he was coming when he has to meet Esau. So God, I'm desperate, but I know one thing. YOU PROMISED ME. YOU BLESSED ME. THAT'S WHY I'M COMING AND PUTTING THE WORD OF GOD TO YOU, LORD. AND GOD HAD TO HONOR HIS OWN WORD. AMEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE A MAN fighting and wrestling with God? How can you overcome God? How can you wrestle with God and and and and win and and overcome? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S ONLY BY PUTTING HIS OWN WORD BECAUSE GOD CANNOT REJECT HIS OWN WORD. IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD IS TO REJECT HIS OWN WORLD. SO, HE HAS TO ACCEPT HIS OWN WORD. AMEN. SO DON'T SAY, "NO, I I IGNORE GOD'S word and I'm going on my own way." No. THEN YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF OF THE COVENANT. AMEN. COME INTO THE COVENANT OF THE WORD OF GOD AND GOD will honor you. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOME MINISTER ARE AFRAID TO MENTION HELL. If you mention hell, you know, YOU ARE SCARING PEOPLE. BUT IN THE WORD OF GOD, IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE WORD OF GOD, YOU GO TO HELL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. LOVE OF GOD IS CORRECTIVE. IF YOU CORRECT, CORRECTION IS NOT TO DESTROY BUT is to it in order to prevent the destruction. Amen. Actually, no one go God doesn't send anyone to hell. People send themselves to hell. As the prophet say you you made your you you yourself going you are doing the it's hard to go to hell. Do you KNOW THAT? &gt;&gt; IT'S VERY HARD TO GO TO HELL because God has PUT ALL THE SAFEGUARD ALONG THE WAY. EVERY TIME YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG, SOMETHING tells you no that's wrong. &gt;&gt; Even an unbelievers, something is inside of him telling that's wrong. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S VERY HARD TO GO TO HELL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; By God's grace. &gt;&gt; But people naturally sometimes what he's like a little child don't do this then that's the thing he's going to do &gt;&gt; because that's the flesh. AMEN. BUT THANK GOD FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES AND HE HAS POWER OVER THOSE THINGS AND GIVE YOU THE DESIRE FOR GOD. YOU LOVE GOD MORE THAN ANYTHING. YOU WANT TO SERVE HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING. LIKE I SAID LAST SUNDAY, the love of God inside of you, you don't want to hurt him. I don't want to hurt you, Lord. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I DON'T WANT TO hurt you. The love of God prevails. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are chosen unto salvation. If you are chosen unto salvation, the prophet says, Israel could not figure out God's love. They thought that love meant no suffering. They thought that the love meant a baby with parental care. But God said his love was elective love. The proof of his love is election. That no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen onto salvation. How many are thankful for predestination &gt;&gt; for election in our lives? His love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. Oh, I love this one. SO IF YOU ARE CHOSEN UNTO SALVATION, God is not ignoring sin. Sometimes you rebuke sin. Sometimes even openly rebuke sin. Proverbs 77 27 says, "Open rebuke is better than secret love." Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. &gt;&gt; I thank God when God is rebuking me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It means that God loves me. &gt;&gt; I thank God when the word of God is correcting me. &gt;&gt; It's God loving me. Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOD IS GOD PREVENTING DESTRUCTION. IS GOD HELPING ME? I THANK GOD WHEN GOD IS REBUKING ME OR THE way I dress and the way I dressing is is immoral. You have to change your way. I'm not saying, you know, God, that's hard on me. No, thank God for your love, for correcting me. &gt;&gt; I THANK GOD WHEN HE'S REBUKING ME. HUSBAND, LOVE YOUR WIVES. OR WIVES, BE SUBJECTED TO YOUR HUSBAND. That's not that's not being legalist. Is God love? Thank God for your love. &gt;&gt; Thank you for helping me. Amen. I THANK GOD WHEN GOD WHEN GOD IS REBUKING ME IN THE WORD OF GOD, I don't want the kisses of an enemy. I don't want someone compromising on the word of God. If someone is compromising on the word of God is your enemy. Remember that pastor who was telling that little lady you know himself was smoking outside there. It's a little bit a sad story that little that little that little girl or that little lady brother spoke about that little lady. She was even a Sunday school teacher and then and she she she kept living a immoral life or whatever life she was living in and her pastor was not rebuking her and she was kept going on and then at the at the time of death she she's dying she realized oh I'm lost I'm lost because I was it was supposed to be an angel of God PICKING UP HOW COME I'M GOING TO DARKNESS I'M LOST CALL THE pastor and the pastor is smoking outside And I call the pastor. They come in and oh no, no, she she's hallucinating. She's putting a shock. They're trying to calm her down. NO, YOU I DECEIVER. YOU'RE A LIAR. YOU KNOW, you you deceived me. Now I'm lost. Why? Because you was just It's okay for you, you know. It's okay for you know, just be religious, you know. Church a little bit. No, no, no. That's not the message of the hour. The message of the earth comes to correct us, come to change us. The proverb say, you know, today you hate me because I'm hard on you and you feel like I don't you feel like I don't love you and I'm but one day you will love me because I've spoken to you the TRUE WORD OF GOD WITHOUT COMPROMISE IS THE LOVE OF GOD. THE CAPSTONE IS LOVE OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD UNVEILED TO US IS THE LOVE OF GOD. IT'S NOT LEGALISM. IT'S THE WORD OF GOD. THANK GOD FOR CORRECTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It changes our attitude. Amen. &gt;&gt; In anything in the small details, Lord, I want correction of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ correct his own mother. So, don't you know that the word I have to be after my father's business. Sometimes looks like hard. How can you say that? Because the word of God corrects the error. &gt;&gt; The love of God corrects the error. &gt;&gt; Lord, correct me when I'm wrong. every time, ANYTIME &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR LOVE TOWARDS ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; In the natural how we love our children. Sometimes you are so hard towards them than someone else child. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's love. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't touch other people. You wish sometimes like or you don't want to go in jail and everything. So you just leave it gone. But you love them. But your own children now you are very hard because you want the best. The same thing spiritually speaking. Amen. The natural is a TYPE OF A SPIRITUAL. GOD IS GIVING THE WORD OF GOD AS HARD AS can be but it's still God's love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why on the other side they called my precious brother when they saw brother Vana my precious brother. Oh if you had not come we would not be here because you came because you stay FAITHFUL TO THE WORD OF GOD. YOU DID NOT COMPROMISE. YOU DIDN'T follow popularity. You didn't follow money. YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW ALL THESE THINGS. YOU STAYED TRUE TO THE WORD OF GOD. THANK GOD FOR THE MALACHI FARM. THANK GOD FOR THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH JOHN. THANK GOD FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT. AMEN. THANK GOD. I WILL SAY EVEN TODAY BEFORE WE GO ON THE OTHER SIDE, THANK GOD THAT MALACHI 4 came. &gt;&gt; IF HE HAD NOT COME, WE WOULD NOT BE HERE. IF YOU NOT COME, I WOULDN'T KNOW YOU. WILL YOU KNOW ME? BUT THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER WITHOUT COMPROMISE. I THANK GOD FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT COME, we will not be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, and I want to say, but where I WANT TO SEE THE LORD Jesus Christ. No, you can't see him yet because he's on the is higher dimension, higher level. Says, but one day he will come and he will judge you. So he will judge me. Will he judge Paul? Say yeah, he will judge Paul too. &gt;&gt; Amen. The brother says, "Oh, PRAISE BE TO GOD. IF HE JUDGES PAUL AND HIS PEOPLE PASS, MY PEOPLE, IF YOU JUDGE ME AND ME AND MY PEOPLE WILL PASS THROUGH." WHY? BECAUSE I PREACHED LIKE PAUL PREACHED. I STAYED FAITHFUL TO THE WORD OF GOD. I DID NOT COMPROMISE ON THE WORD OF GOD. THANK GOD FOR THAT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I CAN AND THE PEOPLE RESPONDED. WE ARE RESTING UPON IT. &gt;&gt; TODAY WE ARE SAYING THE SAME THING. WE ARE RESTING UPON THE WORD OF GOD. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE WORD OF GOD FOR NOTHING. WE STAY TRUE TO THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE IT'S the love of God being expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Not for condemnation, but for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; False love will try to compromise on the word of God under the pretext of avoiding conflict under the pretext of not hurting people's feeling. Oh, you hurt my feeling. remember the experience of that pastor's wife. So she came like she's makeup and tight things and she she came she's playing the piano and looked at say that's your wife say she's my wife she's a scent she looks like Hint. &gt;&gt; Hint. &gt;&gt; A hint. A ant true. &gt;&gt; Not making a little but it it is it has a truth behind it &gt;&gt; because he could correct the error. &gt;&gt; So that's love towards that person. If you just want to batter them, then you are not doing them a good service. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us to preach the whole word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. because that's the true love of God. Let the head of home stay with the word of God because that's the true correction. That the love of God. Let the mother stay with the word of God BECAUSE THAT'S THE LOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Charity is the bond of maturity of the church. &gt;&gt; We need a prophet of the age to define to us what is charity? What is the love of God? Because without it we might be mistaken with the wrong attitude of filio and calling it the higher level of agapa love. But even in fil the parents don't overlook over sins a good parent because overlooking everything means there is no correction. But the bible says in Hebrews 12 9:10 are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Furthermore, we have we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence. Shall we not rather be in subjection unto the father of spirit and live? For they verily for a few days chestned us after their own pleasure. For he for a profit that we might be partakers of his holiness. And verse six says, for whom the Lord loveth is chastened and scorgeth every son whom he receiveth. If you're Jew chesting, God dealeth with you as with sons. For what son is he whom the father chasteth not? One time I preached a message, it's a grace when God deals with you as a son. &gt;&gt; It's God's grace. &gt;&gt; Because if he deals you with a servant, he might leave you. If he deals you not as a son, it means he might let you do whatever you want to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when he deals you have a son, he's hard on you. That's right. &gt;&gt; How many times it has happened to me many times. I see other people crossing and no flashing of the light but the moment I fly. Oh why is hard on me? I told you many times I think I've told us you were there as as a student as I was a student people can cheat but the moment I try to cheat &gt;&gt; they caught me. &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY? &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR TREATING ME AS A SON BECAUSE HE DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO do anything. He's watching over you. He's after you. HE'S CORRECTING YOU. THANK GOD FOR GOD'S GRACE WHEN HE'S DEALING WITH ME AS A SON. HE CORRECT ME, SPANK ME SOMETIMES. AND THANK GOD FOR THAT BECAUSE IT'S YOUR LOVE. I APPRECIATE GOD'S LOVE IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But to realize that it takes maturity. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why charity is the bond of perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 18:15 says, "Moreover, if your brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone, and he shall hear thee that shall gain thy brother." That's a good example why charity deals with a sin privately, not publicly. Charity does not expose the mistakes of others. You try to restore your brother or your sister. You retain it with love to prevent sin from spreading and destroying more lives. Like can ach your sister to be saved. You don't want to affect everybody else. Amen. Jesus Christ being the perfect example. He addresses it in the case of the woman taken in adultery. Say John 8:1011 said, "Neither do I condemn it. Go and sin no more." The Lord Jesus Christ covered her with the public covered her from the public shame. But he refused to deny the sin. He refused. He refused to say that she did not make a mistake. You made a mistake. But go and sin no more. &gt;&gt; So that's the attitude. Amen. You forgive and we have to forgive. But you know what? What you did is wrong. Don't do that anymore. Thank God for God's grace in our life. &gt;&gt; And the Paul Paul said in 1 Timothy 5:1 19:21 against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witness them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that they should observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing but partiality. Love of God does not do by things by partiality partiality. You know this because this is my son, this is my kids. You know what? You just let them pass. This is my wife, I let them pass. Or this is my husband, I let them pass. No, three things without partiality. &gt;&gt; But was hard on upon his own children was hard upon the wife, upon himself. Because the word of God is the absolute. No pastor is above the word of God. No office is above the WORD OF GOD. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE WORD OF GOD. ABOVE ALL THINGS IS THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. EVERYONE IS SUBJECT TO THE word of God. &gt;&gt; But there's a principle here that is also saying says no charity cover things. It's not about catching someone struggling. But charity also correct the error. Sometimes it has to correct the error publicly &gt;&gt; but still God's love. Amen. &gt;&gt; So for the elders, for the heads of home, for the for the officers of the church, &gt;&gt; you are an example. You are influencing many things. What you do is it influence many things. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to be corrected publicly. &gt;&gt; Are we mature church? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as a small church, sometimes you correct things everybody knows who you are talking about. Mhm. &gt;&gt; And some people even turn their head to see we're talking. &gt;&gt; But as a mature Christian, you know, it's not about humiliating one person, the other one. &gt;&gt; It's still God's love. &gt;&gt; We want that person to be saved &gt;&gt; and we won't protect any other person from that influence. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope may God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes I'm sitting there, the word of God is correcting me too. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And I repent God. Thank God for correct me. You send brother Victor brother say did this. Oh God thank I see that. Oh I didn't see that angle but thank God the word of God is above anything. Or brother Gilbert who sometimes myself even I'm talking oh God this is the word of God. Thank God for correcting. I didn't see that when I was preparing but now I'm preaching it. I see the word of God speaking to me. I also humble to it. Lord thank God FORGIVE ME LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD IS CORRECTING US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But I like here says against an elder receive not an accusation before but but before two or three witnesses them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leaders shape doctrines and behavior and sometimes think you know the offices of the church you have you are an example. People look at you because your attitude is influencing others. Amen. You can't be a leader and you are always the one late influencing a lot of people &gt;&gt; without knowing it. Myself included. God help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I have a post. Let me be there on time. Let me prepare. Let because it's affecting many people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Honestly, I didn't want to say that when I was preparing the message, but I feel like I had to say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leaders shape doctrine behavior. If their sin is ignored, others will stumble. Silence towards it will become endorsement. But people see it. Look at that. How how can he be there and it's coming late like this? It's affecting everybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Becomes a spirit. It takes the church and go there. Love will come with a correction. Love don't tolerate sin. It has to correct it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I used to wonder Paul said in Galatians 1:6, "Brethren, if a man be overtaken with a fault. He which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, thou shalt be tempted." But the same at the same time the same Paul who's saying to speak to people with spirit of meekness and considering that you can be tempted by the same time Paul why is not respecting the the the why is he not respect I used to wonder myself why he's not respecting Matthew 18:15 when he's talking to Peter said when Peter was come to enter I withtood him to the face because he was to be blamed and before that certain came from James and he did eat with the Gentiles, but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them that were with of the circumcision. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him, in so much that Barnabas was also carried away with their dissimulation. When I saw that they walked up not upright according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, if being a Jew, listen, leave us after the man of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why compare thou the Gentiles to leave as to do the Jews. &gt;&gt; I used to wonder why Paul is not talking calling Peter and said, Peter, you know what? What they're doing is wrong. You know, they need to correct him. &gt;&gt; They said, no, this is a spirit that has already influenced so many people. &gt;&gt; He's an elder. is a is is is is a is an example to many things. Now you have to rebuke it publicly. So you know what Peter you're doing it's wrong because what you are doing is wrong. You see how how many people start doing the same thing. Maybe you are not aware of it but you're affecting so many people. So others also also there say oh that actually wrong. Yes that's wrong. It's not an endorsement. &gt;&gt; Let the WORD OF GOD CORRECT US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because he was to blame. Others were being led astray. Silence will destroy more souls. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a pastor see so many things? I know I don't want to say because they leave the church. So just keep them. Oh, we we need them. We need them. Just keep them coming. Just just just pick on the nice thing they like. &gt;&gt; We can't make the rapture with that. That's right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SPEAK THE WHOLE WORD OF GOD WHETHER IT REBUKES ME, WHETHER IT CORRECTS ME, WHERE I LOVE THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE I WANT TO BE PART OF THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; LORD, LET MY INFLUENCE BE POSITIVE. LET ME BE PART OF THOSE WHO BRING SOMEONE COME CLOSER TO YOU, LORD. I DON'T WANT MY LIFE TO BRING SOMEONE AWAY FROM YOU, BUT I WANT THEM TO COME CLOSER TO YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; BRING THE LOVE OF GOD IN MY HEART, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T SEE THAT, IF WE WE OVERLOOK OVER THINGS, I will say SIN WILL BECOME NORMALIZED. &gt;&gt; REPENTANCE WILL DISAPPEAR IN OUR CHURCH. WELLNESS WILL CREEP IN. IF WE JUST SEE THINGS AND WE JUST SAY IT'S OKAY, LEAVE THEM. NO. LET THE WORD OF GOD, LET THE LOVE OF GOD COME WITH HUMILITY, WITH SIMPLICITY, WE BUT STILL THE LOVE OF GOD TO CORRECT OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why it will be even important to read Colossians that we read at the beginning. It was the love of God. But it says so many good things in the natural life to correct people. Amen. Love of God. Charity sufferth long. Charity is kind. Charity env. Charity vth not itself. It's not puffed up. Does not behave itself unseemingly. It seeketh not our own. is not easily provoked, think no evil. Amen. Rejoice not iniquity but rejoice in the truth. Charity can there cannot be there and say it's okay LEAVE INIQUITY. NO, THE LOVE OF GOD CANNOT TOLERATE INIQUITY. The love of God will WE WE WILL REJOICE IN THE TRUTH will rebuke iniquity. Amen. Cherth bear of all things, believe on all things, hope of all things, endure of all things. Charity never fails. But whether there be prophecy, they shall fail. Whether there be tongue, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. BUT WE KNOW IN PART, BUT WE PROPHESY IN PART. BUT THEM WHICH is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away. WE THANK GOD FOR THE PERFECTION OF THE LOVE OF GOD IN OUR TIME. THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE OF the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; What the prophet says from ALL THE GIFT IF YOU want a church with many gift the the Pentecostal HAVE SO MANY GIFT SO MANY GIFT IN THEIR CHURCHES AMEN AND we want those gift don't take me wrong we want those gift but there is no perfect love of God there &gt;&gt; to correct the error &gt;&gt; that's why they still there and people are prophesying they're still in in wearing trousers and things are catching THEIR HAIR PUTTING MAKEUP AND ALL DIFFERENT THINGS and the men ARE DOING THEIR LIFE AND HAVE TWO THREE WIVES AND BUT THEY'RE PROPHESYING THEY have a many gift and they have uncuction all those THINGS ARE GOOD BUT THANK GOD FOR THE WORD OF GOD TO come to CHANGE THE HEART &gt;&gt; CHANGING YOUR HEART PREPARING THE BRIDE FOR THE REDEMPTION &gt;&gt; CORRECT the error &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; says I'm going to do all these things for you. I'll give you that. But I won't let you have any of these things. Says, "Let me have real love in my heart." I'll say, "God, give me love." But where there is love, it will endure forever. That's what drove the heart of God to send Christ to the earth. Mercy said, "God, we approach God through the channel of love and faith. Faith take us to the channel, but the love of God is the one that takes us in the channel without the love of God." It says the the um love love is the most powerful force that stops anything there is is love. Love that moved a mighty God. GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE his only begotten son. Love is the great keynote thing we live out. It's something that eternal. Let me say it. The love of God brought God down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As it was at the place where he was, the love of God brought him down. at &gt;&gt; the level where we are. But if you allow me to allow the love of God is taking us from where we were to also bring us up &gt;&gt; to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first coming it was coming down. The second coming the love of God is bringing us in the rapture to God. Amen. And it will do the work of correction, the work of cleaning, the work of of of of realizing our go our salvation does not depend on our works but on the of the grace OF GOD. ALL THE WORK IT WILL DO BUT IN ORDER TO BRING us up to God himself. &gt;&gt; When love comes when the two ominants meet together then something shall happen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the love of God in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says oh love reaching out. When his own children cried out for his blood, he screamed, "Father, forgive them." They don't even know what they are doing. That's love. The church don't want that. They want creed. But we need love. The church is dying by creed. It's only live by it's only it can only live by love because love is eternal life. Love overcomes all things. Love is the most powerful force there is. They didn't want him because they know what was in the gift. Amen. You see, I like the way he's putting it. They they want creeds. They don't want love. You might say, "Why can you compare creed and love?" Yes. They don't want they want the creed. They don't want the word of God. But we want the word of God &gt;&gt; because it produce the love of God. &gt;&gt; And it's also the love of God. The church is dying by creeds, but can only live by the love of God. There's another subject I could take but with the prophet how he was saying you know almost the evidence evidence of the Holy Spirit was love but we give that another time. So you never cast a devil out by the wrong attitude. It takes love to do that. Love is the most powerful force there is in the world. Now if you notice a devil is always hate. Hate is of the devil. But when people hate someone, remember it's a terrible devil. Devil to despise or to dislike. You must not do that. No matter how bit the other is, love remains itself. Love is the ultimate of grace. Love is God ultimately for us. For after all other gift and things have vanished, our prophecies, our tongues, our interpretation, all that I've ever done or the more when love comes in, it's the ultimate. It above all cause all other failures. The Supreme Court decision, it's the typost. It's the northstar that keeps the the the semen the semen the semen level. It's the compass that guide us. Love is the ultimate. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many desire more of God love? Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me a few few minutes here. So be wrapping up to thank you for your patience. So filio comes from the world fellowship. If you feel your love is what you have for your wife, a man might flirt with her, insult her and you will shoot his brain out of it. And that's what filio love will do. It accompanies jealousies and many other things goes with it. But agapa love will make you pray for a sinful soul. That difference between the two love. God's love is the beginning of love. It's the fountain of love. The church today is lacking in that real agapa love that makes you have love for your enemy. If we only had that kind of love, there would be a revival sweep this nation from coast to coast, from north to south. The reason that we do do not have that's the main reason the church is not progressing like it should. We don't need theology. We only need the real love to go with the theology we already know. WE ALL ARGUE SO MUCH whether we should be baptized backwards, forwards, whatever. That won't make any difference how you are baptized or what church you belong to or what evidence that you have to that you are a Christian. If you haven't got love, you haven't got God. We need love. &gt;&gt; As God has described what love of God is and we we can't even go you still can't describe it in fullness. But the love of God can be correction. The love of God will be will be the word of God. love of God, the Holy Spirit, the all the description of the love of God. As the bride is understanding more and more of that love, she just said, "Lord, I need more of that love." Because if I love you, one more time, if I love you really, if I really love you, I will do great things for you. Not as a burden, but because I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's what the church needs. &gt;&gt; Not more more knowledge, but more of the love. I know the author of the word of God. Help me to know you by love. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the power of love of God &gt;&gt; more than theology. &gt;&gt; Let me take just one time, one po portion here. Give me a few minutes. Sorry. So I don't have feel like I I skipped so many things already. But just I wanted to say this. Luke 9 5456. When disciples came, disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, will thou, will thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elias did?" But he turned and rebuked them and said, "You know not what man of spirit you are of. For the son of man is not come to destroy man's life, but to save them." &gt;&gt; And they went to another village. Just want to put emphasis here. They did not have the love of God yet. But they took the scripture, they quoted the scripture, they saw what a mighty prophet did and they want to replicate that under the dispensation of grace and love. And they missed the point because they saw the works of God. One more time. They saw the works of God. They saw what God did in Elijah, but they didn't catch the way of God. The inner reason behind it is love of God. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ is coming and correcting them. And I said, "No, you know what? Even it was done there, it doesn't mean that you have to do it all the time. Sometimes you can take the word of God and you quote it. But if you don't quote it without the love of God, sometimes it can be doing also some damage. Putting a parallel a balance here. God help me to have the love of God in my heart even when quoting the truth because the truth will only have his real potential, his real work when it's being worked on the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God is the bond of perfection. &gt;&gt; Every different part of the body are good. Can you imagine? You have very good home, good eyes and many things can be part in the body and are very good. But if they don't work together, they won't be efficient. The thing that make them work together is the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's what we desire in our church. God, fill me with your love of God. that the part that I'm doing it can edify someone else &gt;&gt; because it's being worked under the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's why we desire the love of God. Amen. Let's stand together. Thank you. Patience as the music's playing softly. Read 1 Timothy 1:46. Paul saying neither give heed to fables and handless genealogy which minister questions but rather than godly edifying which is in faith. So do now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart. The end of the commandment. So as a ministry say the end of my ministry the result that I want the goal that I want if if I have to do if my ministry had to do something in the people I want the charity in the in the pure heart that's what I desire and that the ministry of brother Banam as well Lord I want the perfect love of God to be in the heart that has been changed so that you can express yourself. Amen. Let's sing that song. Love of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Love is greater than tongue or pen can ever tell. It goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest. The guilty bow down with care. God gave his son. Oh to him every child and let's sing together. Oh love of God. Oh love of God. of God. I reach and pure and pure and strong. We shall forever more in just verse three. Verse three within the ocean and where the sky parchment where every star on earth and every man as ride by train to ride the God of would the strong stretch from sky to sky. &gt;&gt; Oh love of God of God. How rich and pure. &gt;&gt; Rich and pure. How measureless and strong it shall forever more endure the saints and angels. Let's just bow our heads together as the music is playing softly just thank God for his grace for his love that he has projected towards us. Prophet says in one the quote says God heals by understanding but God heals by love. I believe God has projected his love towards us in order to heal us. even to heal us in our bodies is still the love of God here. If you express to him that you love him because he already loved you, he already loved me before the foundation of the world. You already loved us. Now it's our turn to express to him.

Dear God Jesus Christ, we thank you this morning for your word. &gt;&gt; We thank you for everything. The poet could sing such love, such wonderful love &gt;&gt; that God should love a sinner such as I. &gt;&gt; You took us from the deepest of sin. &gt;&gt; We were the sinners &gt;&gt; without nothing, &gt;&gt; without the savior. &gt;&gt; But you descend yourself &gt;&gt; to save us from our sins. That's a love that no one can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a love no one can bring in this life. &gt;&gt; That Jesus Christ himself, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; he become a flesh. &gt;&gt; He came down &gt;&gt; and live &gt;&gt; in our place. &gt;&gt; He took our place. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; He took our life. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And you die for us. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you. And Jesus Christ, you show us that love. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; That's why you teach us the that love and you said we can also have that same love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You gave that same love through the statures of the perfect man. &gt;&gt; Before come in the point of to have that love, &gt;&gt; we pass by virtues. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We pass by knowledge. We pass by temperance. &gt;&gt; We pass by patience. &gt;&gt; We pass by love. &gt;&gt; And then you come, you dwell in us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For having that big love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why we are this morning here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To hear about love. &gt;&gt; To sing about love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Dear Lord, we don't want to sing just love. We don't want just to talk about love. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want that love to be us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That everyone in this church to manifest that love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because you died for that love. Lord &gt;&gt; forgive our sins. Lord &gt;&gt; dear Lord &gt;&gt; give us the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Because is that Holy Ghost will give us the the true love &gt;&gt; in our life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It will not be a fellow love. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But it will be a a gap love. Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; And we need a aapola in the end time. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because this world become a bad word. &gt;&gt; A bad word that we we see people are living uh such a a bad life. &gt;&gt; But if we can have uh a gap love, &gt;&gt; we can bring someone to Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just for loving him, he can come to Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, father. Because we read brother Abraham say the sign that can show that someone is saved is when he can go and uh bring someone else to the word. &gt;&gt; But we can't bring some someone to the word if we don't have love. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's why we need that love. Oh Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the message of this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the anointing. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you for pastor Moses. &gt;&gt; May you, oh Lord Jesus, accept to anoint him once more. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; May you accept to give him more revelation &gt;&gt; to guide this church &gt;&gt; in the truth and &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and in the love of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because sometime we are like his children and we can act in the certain way. But if he can have the love and if you can give him the revelation to bring these people to in your presence &gt;&gt; it will be a big dream. Oh Lord. Oh Lord &gt;&gt; thank you for everything. &gt;&gt; Yes father. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the congregation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We need more people. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; we need to bring more people to Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; because oh Lord Jesus Christ, we are in the end time &gt;&gt; and we are seeing what is happening in this world. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, give us the way that we can also bring many people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To become to hear this word. This is a uh this is the word that you gave us in this time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you and help everyone here. &gt;&gt; Give us your love. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we pray in Jesus Christ.

Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not stopping. The brother will talk about the secret coming of the Lord. Says like that story of Romeo and Juliet. Amen. It's a love story. Love brought Jio Romeo to come there. He loved her but her. So in the heart something was boiling. Amen. I think it's the love that will bring us out of this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking for the souls that are lost as the brother prayed. Lord give us that love of God desire. Amen. Which song can we when we go? Oh. Oh, that's good. A little different. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it with all our heart. I was singing deep. &gt;&gt; Oh, far from the place for sure. There is to rise by the master of the sea. My despairing cryers lifted me and love me. I live in me when nothing else could love me. Love me when nothing else to love me. Let's see verse three.
