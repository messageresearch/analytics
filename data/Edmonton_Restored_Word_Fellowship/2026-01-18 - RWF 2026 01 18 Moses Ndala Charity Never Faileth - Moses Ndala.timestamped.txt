[9:08] &gt;&gt; There's just a a testimony and a prayer
[9:11] request. And uh the testimony says, "I'd
[9:13] like to praise the Lord Jesus for for
[9:15] healing my back. Uh brother Moses prayed
[9:18] for me and the Jesus Jesus touched me."
[9:21] Glory to the Lord. That's from Sister
[9:22] Murray. So, we just we thank the Lord
[9:24] for for healing and for grace. And then
[9:27] there's a
[9:30] a prayer request that says, "Can you
[9:32] please remember uh my father-in-law,
[9:34] Sister Trina's dad. We uh just received
[9:38] news that he's not feeling well." So,
[9:41] that's from Brother Joseph. So, we can
[9:43] just we can go to the Lord and we'll
[9:46] bring those needs before. Just bow our
[9:47] heads with me.
[9:50] Lord, Father in heaven, Lord, Lord,
[9:52] we're in your house, Lord. And Lord, we
[9:55] we come to this building, Lord, not to
[9:58] gain heaven, Lord, but to gain you,
[10:00] Lord. We
[10:03] all these things we do, Lord, we we
[10:06] don't do, Lord, that we could set foot
[10:08] in heaven, Lord. But that we can have a
[10:10] a relationship with you, Lord. That we
[10:12] can see you face to face, Lord, and and
[10:14] Lord, and experience fellowship beyond
[10:17] measure, Lord, with you, Lord.
[10:19] Lord, there's no amount of anything,
[10:22] Lord, that would
[10:25] convince me, Lord, to get to heaven just
[10:26] to see streets made of gold or to see
[10:30] a great pyramid that that shine in the
[10:32] sun, Lord. But I want to see you face to
[10:33] face, Lord. Those things are
[10:37] attributes of who you are, Lord. And I
[10:39] want to see you, Lord, face to face,
[10:40] Lord. And we and Lord, just as we don't
[10:43] want to see, Lord, a man speaking, Lord,
[10:44] we want to see you speaking, Lord. We
[10:46] want to hear you, Lord. Lord, speak to
[10:48] our hearts, Lord. And
[10:49] Lord, and and give us what we have in in
[10:52] due season, Lord. And just as the
[10:54] Israelites, Lord, they went through the
[10:56] desert, Lord. They they had manifold
[10:58] from heaven, Lord. Would you speak to
[10:59] us, Lord? Would you, Lord, give us,
[11:02] Lord, what we need to hear, Lord, what
[11:03] we need to feed on, Lord, and Father, we
[11:06] uh bring Sister Trina, Lord, uh, Father,
[11:09] Lord, before you. And we just ask, Lord,
[11:11] that you'd go to his wayside, Lord, that
[11:14] you'd you'd comfort him, Lord, that
[11:15] you'd strengthen him, Lord. That Lord,
[11:17] he could see you, Lord, as a healer.
[11:18] that he could rejoice in you, Lord, as a
[11:20] healer, Lord. Lord, we give healing,
[11:22] Lord, and in Jesus Christ's name,
[11:23] according to your favor, Lord, according
[11:25] to your will, Lord, according to the
[11:26] Lord, the authority, Lord, you give to
[11:28] your to your children, Lord. And
[11:31] Lord, we just thank you, Lord, for
[11:32] healing, Lord, and Lord, for Lord,
[11:34] Sister Marie, and and just Lord, if
[11:37] there's any need here, Lord, we can
[11:39] Lord, we bring it to you, Lord. Be with
[11:41] those, Lord, that couldn't make it,
[11:42] Lord, that Lord, by virtue of this life,
[11:45] Lord, there's just things that get in
[11:47] the way, Lord. And we just ask you you'd
[11:49] go by their wayside also, Lord. And and
[11:51] Lord, and minister to them wherever they
[11:52] are. And Lord, we just ask, Lord, that
[11:55] you'd have your way this morning. And we
[11:57] ask these things in Jesus Christ's name.
[11:58] Amen.
[12:01] You can have your seats if you like.
[12:45] Make
[12:47] me more
[12:50] like thee,
[12:54] Jes. Jesus,
[12:57] make
[12:59] me more
[13:02] like thee.
[13:08] Give me a heart
[13:13] that's filled
[13:16] with love.
[13:19] and make
[13:22] me more
[13:24] like thee.
[13:30] Oh, make
[13:32] me more
[13:35] like thee,
[13:39] Jesus.
[13:42] Make
[13:43] me more
[13:46] like thee.
[13:53] Give me a heart
[13:57] that's filled
[14:00] with love
[14:03] and make
[14:05] me more
[14:08] like thee.
[14:13] I want to live
[14:16] the way
[14:19] that he wants me to live. I want to give
[14:27] until there's just no more to give. I
[14:35] want to love
[14:38] love till there's just no more love. For
[14:45] I could never
[14:48] ever out love the Lord.
[14:55] I want to live
[14:59] the way
[15:01] that he wants me to live. I want to give
[15:09] until there's just no more to give. I
[15:17] want to love
[15:20] love till there's just no more love. For
[15:27] I could never
[15:30] ever
[15:31] love the Lord.
[15:38] You found me
[15:40] when I was
[15:43] so lonely.
[15:48] You found me
[15:50] when I was
[15:53] so blue.
[15:58] You love me
[16:00] when no one
[16:03] could love me.
[16:08] when no one
[16:10] knew just what
[16:13] to do.
[16:17] I want to live
[16:20] the way
[16:22] that you want me
[16:25] to live. I want to give
[16:30] until there's just no more to give. I
[16:37] want to love
[16:40] love till there's just no more love. For
[16:47] I could never
[16:50] ever love the Lord.
[16:57] For I could never
[17:00] ever
[17:01] love the Lord.
[17:14] Amen. Thank you.
[17:22] Sing. I pledge allegiance to the Lord.
[17:29] I have heard how Christians
[17:34] long
[17:36] ago
[17:37] were brought
[17:39] before
[17:41] a tyrant's
[17:43] throne. They were told that he would
[17:48] spare their life if they would renounce
[17:55] the name of Christ.
[17:59] But one by one they chose to die.
[18:06] The son of God they would not deny.
[18:12] Like a great angelic
[18:16] choir
[18:18] sings, I can almost hear their voicees
[18:25] ring. Oh, I pledge
[18:28] alance
[18:30] to the land. With all my strength, with
[18:37] all I am, I will seek to honor
[18:44] his command.
[18:47] I pledge
[18:49] alence
[18:51] to
[18:54] the lamb.
[18:57] Now the years have come and the years
[19:03] have gone and the cause of Jesus
[19:08] still goes on. Now our time has come to
[19:15] count the cost to reject this world to
[19:22] embrace the cross. And one by one, let
[19:28] us live our lives for for the one who
[19:34] died to give us life till the trumpet
[19:41] sounds on that final
[19:44] day. Let us proudly
[19:48] stand and boldly
[19:51] say, "Oh, I pledge
[19:54] alance
[19:56] to the lamb. With all my strength, with
[20:03] all I am, I will seek to honor his
[20:11] command. Oh, I pledge
[20:14] alce
[20:16] to
[20:19] the lamb. Let's stand. I pledge
[20:21] allegiance. Oh, I pledge
[20:25] alce
[20:27] to the lamb. With all my strength,
[20:33] with all I am, I will seek.
[20:39] Honor
[20:40] his command.
[20:43] I pledge
[20:45] alce
[20:47] to
[20:50] the land.
[20:55] The solid rock.
[21:09] there.
[21:12] But my hope is built in nothing less.
[21:20] My hope is built on nothing less than
[21:26] Jesus blood and righteousness.
[21:30] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but
[21:36] holy mean on Jesus name.
[21:41] On Christ the solid
[21:44] rock I stand. Oh all other ground is
[21:49] sinking sand. All other ground is
[21:54] sinking sand.
[21:56] When darkness seems to hide his face, I
[22:02] rest on his unchanging grace. In every
[22:08] high and stormy gale, my anchor holds
[22:14] within the veil. On on Christ the solid
[22:20] rock I stand. Oh, all other ground is
[22:25] sinking sand. All other ground is
[22:30] sinking sand.
[22:32] His oath is co
[22:36] and his blood. Support me in the
[22:41] whelming blood. And all around my soul
[22:46] gives way. He then is all my hope and
[22:51] stay on
[22:54] solid rock I stand. Oh all other ground
[22:59] is sinking sand. Oh all other ground is
[23:05] sinking sand.
[23:07] when he shall come with trumpet sound.
[23:12] Oh, may I then in him be found dressed
[23:18] in his rightousness
[23:21] alone, fallless to stand before the
[23:26] throne. Rock
[23:29] the solid
[23:31] rock I stand. Oh, all other ground is
[23:36] sinking sand. Oh, other ground is
[23:41] sinking sand.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; And let's sing a Jesus took my burdens
[23:48] says brother Moses.
[23:55] Jesus took my burdens and rolled them in
[23:59] the sea.
[24:01] He rolled them in the sea. He rolled
[24:05] them in the sea.
[24:08] Now I have a victory that he has given
[24:13] me.
[24:15] All my sins and disgrace. He's rolled
[24:18] them in the sea. Took my unbelief. Jesus
[24:22] took my unbelief and rolled them in the
[24:26] sea.
[24:27] He rolled them in the sea. Yes,
[24:30] &gt;&gt; he rolled them in the sea.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Now I have a victory that he has given
[24:38] me.
[24:40] All my sins and disgrace. He's rolled
[24:44] him in the sea.
[24:47] Jesus took my unbelief and rolled him in
[24:51] the sea. He rolled him in the sea. He
[24:56] rolled him in the sea.
[25:00] Now I have a victory that he has given
[25:04] me.
[25:06] All my sins and disgrace he's rolled
[25:10] them in the sea.
[25:13] Aren't you glad and thankful, grateful
[25:17] that God has taken your sins and rolled
[25:20] them in the sea
[25:22] &gt;&gt; that he does not remember them anymore.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Not anymore. Anymore. Thank God.

[28:08] to our Lord. Precious heavenly father,
[28:10] we thank you your grace and your mercy.
[28:12] Lord, we thank you father because you
[28:15] are always faithful. As you said in your
[28:17] word, whatever two or three are gathered
[28:19] in my name, not in the name of another
[28:22] person, but we are here gather in the
[28:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Because of your promise, Father, we know
[28:28] that you are here. We thank you, Father,
[28:30] for the atmosphere that you have already
[28:32] created, Lord, through the song service,
[28:35] through the gift, Father. Lord, oh God,
[28:37] we love you and appreciate you, Lord. We
[28:40] desire that the same presence continue
[28:42] to remain with us, Lord.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Father, we have raised our hands before
[28:46] you. We are needy people. There's so
[28:48] many needs, Father. It might be the need
[28:50] for a closer walk with you. That's the
[28:53] greatest need that we have in our desire
[28:55] to have a closer walk with you, pleasing
[28:59] walk with you, Father. A relationship
[29:01] with you that is closer, intimate as
[29:04] never before, Father, where we see the
[29:06] power of the Lord Jesus Christ manifest
[29:08] in our lives. where we see our lives
[29:11] reflecting you, where we see our lives
[29:13] mirroring the word of God, Father. Oh
[29:16] God, there might be also a desire,
[29:18] Father Lord, maybe for financial needs,
[29:20] maybe Father Lord, for healing in the
[29:22] body, restoration of families, harmony,
[29:26] Lord, in families. It might be, Father
[29:28] Lord, the healing Lord for our loved
[29:30] ones. Whatever the need is, Lord, you
[29:32] are here. You said in your word, the one
[29:34] that is in you is greater than the one
[29:36] that is in the world. We are more than
[29:38] conqueror through Jesus Christ this
[29:40] morning. Father, we love you and
[29:42] appreciate you. Thank you for the blood
[29:44] of the lamb. Thank you for the blood
[29:45] that has cleansed us, washed us that set
[29:48] us free. Father, we give you the glory
[29:50] and the honor. Lord, help us, Lord, as
[29:52] we go through the part of the service
[29:54] where you speak through the word of God.
[29:56] Father, help to put the speaker aside,
[29:59] put the hearer aside, Father, let the
[30:01] Holy Spirit hear through us, Father, as
[30:03] we commit oursel to you, Lord. We break
[30:06] any chain of the enemy, Father. Any
[30:08] spirit of destruction, we break it in
[30:11] the name of Jesus Christ. We desire you
[30:13] to have the liberty and the preminence,
[30:16] Father, as we commit oursel to you. In
[30:18] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen
[30:21] and amen. The church says, "Amen."

[30:52] Good to see you. God bless you. So baby,
[30:55] God bless you. Good to see you.
[30:58] Brother Victor is on the way. He's
[31:00] there. Perfect. God bless you, man. And
[31:04] uh yeah guys there just uh go to the
[31:07] word of God and u
[31:11] thank you brother Andrew. Thank you
[31:14] musician sister Wendy and and brother
[31:18] Gallup.
[31:20] Um,
[31:23] sister Katy, I would like that song at
[31:25] the end if possible as go through the
[31:28] word of God. You just see that it's in
[31:30] line of what I've prepared for this
[31:32] morning. Can just sing for us one more
[31:34] time.
[31:36] 1 Corinthians 13 1 to 1 to 13.
[32:09] It's good to have the full house. If you
[32:12] start competing for the place for the
[32:14] place and seats, that will be good.
[32:17] So come early and I want to keep my spot
[32:19] there and then that should be good. No,
[32:21] no leaving bags.
[32:24] So it has to be
[32:27] my wife likes to leave a bag there for a
[32:29] placement. You have to come early.
[32:40] So first Corinthians chapter
[32:43] 13 and then verse one. Last time we we
[32:46] went through the 12 which was the gift
[32:49] and brotherly love. Now we go to 13. But
[32:52] before go to 13 if you have your just go
[32:55] to just go to 12
[32:59] 12
[33:01] 31st and then we go 13 because just
[33:04] continuation says but covered earnestly
[33:07] the best gift and yet show I unto you a
[33:12] more excellent way and the more
[33:15] excellent way that was going next time
[33:17] the next chapter said though I speak
[33:19] with the tongues of men and of angels
[33:21] angels and have not charity, I am become
[33:25] a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol.
[33:29] And though I have the gift of prophecy
[33:31] and I understand all mysteries and all
[33:35] knowledge and though I have all faith so
[33:38] that I could remove mountains and I have
[33:41] not charity, I am nothing. And though I
[33:45] bestow all my goods to feed the poor and
[33:48] and though I give my body to be burned
[33:51] burned and I have not charity, it
[33:54] profitth me nothing. You realize that
[33:57] all those things are not bad things very
[33:59] good thing and actually very challenging
[34:02] things but even though you come to do
[34:05] them but if you don't have charity to
[34:08] profit us you nothing. And I say,
[34:11] "Charity suffereth long and is kind.
[34:15] Charity envieth not. Charity wantth not
[34:19] itself. Is not puffed up. Does not
[34:22] behave itself unseemly,
[34:25] seeketh not our own, is not easily
[34:28] provoked, thinkketh no evil, rejoice not
[34:33] in iniquity, but rejoice in the truth."
[34:36] The charity beareth all things,
[34:39] believers all things. It hope all
[34:42] things, endureth all things. The charity
[34:46] never fails.
[34:48] And whether there be prophecies, they
[34:51] shall fail. Whether there be tongues,
[34:53] they shall cease. Whether there be
[34:56] knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we
[34:59] know in part, and we prophesy in part.
[35:02] But when that which is perfect is come,
[35:05] then that which is in part shall be done
[35:08] away. When I was a child, I spoke as a
[35:11] child. I understood as a child. I
[35:14] thought as a child, but when I became a
[35:17] man, I put away childish things. For
[35:21] now, we see through a glass darkly. But
[35:24] when but then face to face. Now I know
[35:27] in part, but then shall I know even as I
[35:30] am, as also I am known. And now by the
[35:34] faith, hope, charity, these three, but
[35:38] the greatest of these three is charity.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word and you can
[35:45] have your seat. That's a wonderful
[35:47] chapter and
[35:50] don't we don't want to have time to go
[35:52] through all of this and but just a
[35:55] wonderful chapter to meditate and to see
[35:58] God this maturity come to that maturity
[36:01] that has those characteristics
[36:04] that's what we desire. Amen.
[36:07] First good news for the church and
[36:10] congratulations to P Marcel and and and
[36:16] my master. They have now a new girl in
[36:19] the family. So let's give them a hand.
[36:28] Fistio
[36:30] congratulations. Now the brother goian
[36:33] is married.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; He's not a single anymore. He's married.
[36:36] So we we we thank God for that. We have
[36:40] potentially a new member in the church
[36:44] through the work of brother Gosian. So
[36:46] that's good. Just pray for them and the
[36:49] the the application goes fast for her to
[36:53] come and all the different things that
[36:55] it's it's painful. Now that you are
[36:57] married one day counts like one year. So
[37:00] it takes long for you. For for those who
[37:03] are not married, they say oh no it's
[37:04] just six months but when you are married
[37:06] those six months it's like
[37:09] sisters I can tell right sisters
[37:13] we went through that as well to reply my
[37:15] wife to come it was forever that six
[37:17] months eight months was just like a
[37:20] little eternity
[37:22] but we thank God for that we are happy
[37:25] looks relaxed and good and that's good
[37:27] and sister naturally she's happy there
[37:30] and God bless so richly. So we we are so
[37:33] happy for them
[37:35] &gt;&gt; and we want him to come back as soon as
[37:37] possible as well.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um I'd like to speak this morning
[37:42] about the about love naturally and
[37:45] obviously the capstone love and there's
[37:48] a title I gave it um love never fails
[37:52] and the old English it says charity
[37:54] never failth.
[37:56] So love never fails and this love that
[37:59] you are talking about is not um is not
[38:03] charity in the sense that the world
[38:04] charity has become these days charity
[38:07] like doing good works and things
[38:10] although it's part of it although it's
[38:11] included in it but it's a agapa love it
[38:15] the love of God himself it self-giving
[38:19] it unconditional love sacrificial love
[38:22] it's a love that God that man cannot
[38:25] just reproduce produced by himself. It's
[38:27] the love of God that God has put in the
[38:29] heart of a of a human being. And that
[38:31] what we have described that is described
[38:33] there. It's the love and the love of
[38:36] God. Amen. It's more than the filio
[38:38] love. It's more than the brotherly love.
[38:40] It's more than than than just
[38:43] affections. It's it's way beyond that.
[38:46] As the Bible says, I give you I give you
[38:49] a better way, excellent way, which is
[38:52] the love of God himself in the heart of
[38:54] men. Amen. And that's what we desire.
[38:56] It's a topic that almost everybody knows
[39:00] but I don't think that we have arrived
[39:02] there yet. And that's what important to
[39:04] have. And no one can create it in
[39:07] another person's heart. It's just
[39:09] yourself. As you stay in the channel, as
[39:11] you stay in the word of God, as you stay
[39:13] in prayer, as you hear the word of God,
[39:16] that loves is being increased
[39:18] automatically. And it goes and it goes.
[39:20] It's the same way as is it just a
[39:23] relationship. The same way that in the
[39:24] natural sometimes is a type the natural
[39:27] is a shadow of the of the spiritual in
[39:30] the natural as as you go into marriage
[39:33] relationship the more you talk the more
[39:35] you fellowship the more you communicate
[39:38] and that love just increase increasing
[39:41] and increasing it's a little bit of type
[39:43] of the spiritual as well is the more you
[39:45] stay in that relationship the more the
[39:47] more you communicate the more you in
[39:49] that channel God is just going to feed
[39:52] and fill your heart with more of his
[39:54] love and more of his love. The more you
[39:57] have the love of God, the more
[39:58] victorious you become. You can't become
[40:01] in this last age. You cannot become
[40:03] victorious without the perfect love of
[40:05] God in your heart. And it's important to
[40:08] have the perfect love of God. Give me
[40:10] more of your love. Give me more of your
[40:12] love beyond you men understanding
[40:15] comprehension. I just want the love of
[40:17] God in my heart more than anything else.
[40:20] Amen.
[40:23] The Bible says in John 4:16, it says,
[40:26] "We have known and believed the love
[40:29] that God hath to us. God is love, and he
[40:32] that dwelleth in love dwelleth dwelleth
[40:35] in God and God in him." So I would say
[40:38] that God is love. The identity of God is
[40:41] love himself. You want to know God, you
[40:44] have to know love. The more you know
[40:46] love, you know God. Amen. It's something
[40:48] that is abstract, something that you
[40:50] can't touch, something but it is
[40:52] manifest. It's real. The love of God is
[40:54] real. The Holy Ghost brings more of more
[40:57] the love of God inside of you because
[40:59] the Holy Ghost is God and the Holy Ghost
[41:02] expresses himself through the love the
[41:05] love. Amen. The love of God. You can't
[41:08] pretend to know God if there is no love
[41:10] in your heart. Amen. As John 4:8 says,
[41:13] "He that loveth not, not not knoweth
[41:16] not, he that loveth not, knoweth not
[41:18] God, for God is love." So I'll say this
[41:21] morning, my prayer is that Lord, give me
[41:24] more of your love. Because if I have
[41:26] more of your love, then I know you more.
[41:28] Amen. You might know the scriptures
[41:31] about God, but if you don't have the
[41:33] love of God, you don't know God yet.
[41:35] Amen. In order to know God, you need to
[41:38] know his love. I love that song. You
[41:40] don't you know nothing until you know
[41:43] the love of God. You know nothing. You
[41:45] might think that you know but it's just
[41:47] intellectual knowledge. But until the
[41:50] perfect love of God comes into your
[41:52] heart then you start really walk with
[41:54] God then something really has touch your
[41:57] heart. When you have that love of God in
[41:59] your heart amen. And that love of God
[42:01] I'll say it's not a theory. It's just
[42:03] it's a reality. It's God himself. And
[42:06] that's what we desire in our heart. I'll
[42:08] say the whole plan of redemption is
[42:10] based upon love. The whole plan of
[42:13] redemption is based upon love. Because
[42:15] God's love is not the redemption story
[42:18] is not is not a story of of pity. It's
[42:21] not even a story of mercy. It's not just
[42:24] me story like because mercy is something
[42:26] that you you you you find out yourself
[42:29] into it and then you say okay I have to
[42:31] express mercy and I forgive you because
[42:33] something has happened. the God the
[42:35] redemption love is not is not the
[42:37] redemption of of I say not even of mercy
[42:40] it's a redemption of of grace or love
[42:43] I'll explain that a little more because
[42:46] grace grace started way beyond the
[42:48] foundation of the world the love of God
[42:51] did not start during time is not a re
[42:53] the love of God is not a reactive love
[42:55] it's not because you fell and then God
[42:57] start loving you in order to save you no
[43:00] it's not because you have start doing
[43:02] something then God say oh because you
[43:04] are doing this now. I love you. No.
[43:07] God's love started way before the
[43:09] foundation of the world.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; He loved you way before the foundation
[43:14] of the world. And he chose you way
[43:16] before the foundation of the world.
[43:18] Amen. So God's love is not a reactive
[43:21] love. God's love is the love is God that
[43:24] is unconditional. Is the love of God is
[43:27] supreme. Is is is sovereign. The love of
[43:30] God. So God loves you from before the
[43:33] foundation of the world. Nothing can
[43:35] take you out of the love of God. No
[43:38] circumstances, no situations and nothing
[43:41] can separate you from the love of God
[43:44] because if God loved you, he loved you
[43:46] way before the foundation of the world.
[43:48] Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; So this love is not reactive and and the
[43:52] prophet has as is trying to establish
[43:54] the church, the mature church. So no,
[43:57] salvation is not you are saved today and
[44:00] you are lost tomorrow. Salvation is not
[44:02] I do better things then God start loving
[44:04] me and then God start expressing more
[44:06] his love towards me. No, you can't do
[44:09] nothing better in order for you God to
[44:11] love you more. No, he already loved you
[44:13] way before the foundation of the world.
[44:16] Now you have just to channel yourself
[44:18] into that love of God. And the more you
[44:20] understand the love of God, less fear
[44:23] you will have. Amen. Why we have a lot
[44:25] of fear? Why we have a lot of
[44:27] uncertainty? because we have not
[44:29] understood very well the love of God.
[44:32] And I believe maybe we might not
[44:34] understand it in the fullness in this in
[44:36] this in this part of the world. Maybe
[44:38] not. But the more we understand it, the
[44:41] more realize it, the more it become real
[44:44] to us, I believe more faith we have,
[44:47] more mo more certainty we have. Amen.
[44:51] The more it become a reality. The
[44:53] prophet would say when love is
[44:54] projected. When love is projected,
[44:57] divine sovereign grace of God takes a
[45:00] hold. See when love is projected, divine
[45:03] grace take its place and helps it. When
[45:06] love fileth in that color girl's heart,
[45:08] it's talking about and the love of the
[45:10] opposome you know that story. The love
[45:13] of that opposum to her babies, divine
[45:15] grace to an animal sent to the place for
[45:18] a prayer of delivery. If divine grace
[45:21] will act that way upon an animal, what
[45:24] will it be to a human being who will
[45:26] consecrate themselves to divine love of
[45:29] the love of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[45:32] has recognized him? Amen. So the love
[45:35] the principle I want to make is just as
[45:37] as as a reminder as a repetition of what
[45:40] I already said one time said when the
[45:42] love of God is project then divine grace
[45:44] takes over. Amen. So there is first love
[45:47] of God and then there is divine grace
[45:49] and then divine grace there is election.
[45:51] Amen. So you are elected because of the
[45:54] grace of God and you have the grace of
[45:56] God because you have the love of God. So
[45:58] first they start with the love of God.
[46:00] So that's why I'm saying the love of God
[46:02] is not reactive. The love of God is
[46:05] active. Amen. God loved you first and
[46:08] that's why and when he projected his
[46:10] love then grace came into place took
[46:13] over and then when grace took over then
[46:15] election took over. Amen. You are
[46:17] elected by the love or by the grace of
[46:20] God through the love of God. And under
[46:22] that experience if the aposum expressed
[46:25] projected that love and it was healing
[46:27] for the little baby the prophet says how
[46:30] much more should be for a Christian when
[46:32] a Christian project the love of God that
[46:34] the grace of God will take over. Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; So what we have as a Christian or as a
[46:39] believer it's to express and to project
[46:42] more of the love of God. I thank God
[46:44] that the capstone did not come. The
[46:47] capstone did not come and say work,
[46:50] work, work, work.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that the capstone came and
[46:55] say grace, grace, grace, grace to the
[46:58] bride.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the grace in my life.
[47:02] Thank God for the love of God in my
[47:04] life.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It gives me certainty. It gives me
[47:07] stability. No, it's I'm not depending on
[47:10] myself. I depend on the grace of God. I
[47:13] depend on THE LOVE OF GOD. AMEN. BUT
[47:16] DEEP INSIDE of my heart, I WILL DO MY
[47:18] BEST. AMEN. BUT I'M I'M NOT depending on
[47:21] my works. I'm depending on the grace of
[47:23] God. Praise be to God. Election is God's
[47:26] grace. God's grace the projection of
[47:28] God's love. So it started God's love.
[47:31] Love lifted me. As the song says, love
[47:34] lifted me. No one could lift me up. No
[47:36] one could take me in the position where
[47:38] I am. But thank God the plan God was not
[47:41] taken by surprise. He knew before the
[47:44] foundation of the world all the
[47:46] shortcuts will make all the stumblers
[47:48] all the falls and but all through that
[47:50] still God's love will be there to lift
[47:53] you up. AMEN.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE YOU OVER THAT TO MAKE YOU CROSS
[47:57] OVER because God can't lose you. That's
[48:00] why he put that unconditional love,
[48:02] unconditional grace, unconditional
[48:05] covenant. AMEN. GOD, GIVE US MORE
[48:08] REVELATION to understand your love
[48:10] towards us.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; To mature Christians, the meaning of
[48:18] God's life is way beyond the natural
[48:20] things. As the prophet says in the
[48:23] exposition 7 church age, he says, "The
[48:25] cloudy skies and the storms of life are
[48:28] no signs of God's approval. Neither are
[48:31] bright skies and still waters signs of
[48:34] his love and approval. His approval of
[48:37] any of us is only in the beloved. So the
[48:42] approval is not based on the
[48:43] circumstances of why this is happening.
[48:45] Why this happening? Maybe God does not
[48:47] love me. No, it's not based on that.
[48:50] That's that a denominational conception.
[48:52] That a catholic conception. That's
[48:55] wrong. I mean, you might go up, you
[48:57] might go down, you might go up, you
[48:59] might go down. Things might go bad,
[49:01] things might go good, but that does not
[49:04] depend on the love. That's not the sign
[49:06] of the love of of God or disapproval of
[49:09] God. Your approval, my approval is in
[49:12] the beloved. Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD HELP US TO GO IN THE
[49:16] inner behind the inner because there we
[49:19] don't depend on circumstances. We are we
[49:22] are we are sound we are sound how do you
[49:25] say soundproof
[49:27] &gt;&gt; soundproof from the things of the noise
[49:29] of the outside you are inner there in
[49:32] relationship with God I want to know you
[49:34] more I want the love of God to be
[49:36] EXPRESSED TO ME MORE LORD I DON'T WANT
[49:39] TO DEPEND on the circumstances on the
[49:41] weather and things of the smoke of even
[49:44] in in the holy center I for the smoke
[49:47] depending on ON THE NATURAL LIGHT NO
[49:50] LORD I WANT THE SHINE IN A GLORY TO
[49:53] SHINE UPON ME. THE LOVE OF GOD,
[49:55] &gt;&gt; MAKE ME GO INTO THE CAPSTONE LOVE. LORD,
[49:58] LET ME HAVE A REVELATION OF THE CAPSTONE
[50:00] LOVE. LORD, because you loved me before
[50:03] the foundation of the world.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; It says his love is elective which he
[50:08] had for us before the foundation of the
[50:10] world. Does he love us? He says, "Ah,
[50:13] yes." But how shall we know? We shall
[50:16] know because he said so. Amen. And he
[50:19] manifested that he did love us for
[50:23] because because for he brought us to
[50:26] himself and he gave us of his spirit.
[50:31] That's the proof that God loved us. He
[50:33] brought us to himself.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; You didn't bring yourself to God. God
[50:37] brought you to himself. He brought you
[50:40] to himself and he gave you the Holy
[50:43] Spirit. As I SAID MANY TIMES, NO ONE can
[50:46] give you the Holy Spirit. No preacher
[50:48] can give you THIS HOLY SPIRIT. NO PARENT
[50:50] CAN GIVE YOU THE HOLY SPIRIT. No matter
[50:52] how much they LOVE YOU. ONLY GOD CAN
[50:55] GIVE YOU THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU THANKFUL WHEN THAT GOD gives
[51:00] you the Holy Spirit, not because you
[51:03] couldn't give it yourself the Holy
[51:05] Spirit, but by God's grace, God gives
[51:07] you the Holy Spirit. You have a desire
[51:10] for him. You have a desire to serve him.
[51:12] You have desire to BE FAITHFUL TO HIM.
[51:15] NO ONE COULD GIVE YOU THAT. ONLY GOD
[51:17] COULD GIVE YOU THAT. THANK GOD FOR THAT
[51:20] THIRST IN MY HEART. THANK GOD FOR THAT
[51:22] THIRST IN YOUR heart for more of God.
[51:25] And he didn't stop there. Says what is
[51:27] what did he manifest his love? Says he
[51:29] brought us to himself and he gave us of
[51:31] his spirit and he placed us as sons. He
[51:35] brings us to adoption. Amen. In this age
[51:38] is not only to stop on the
[51:40] justification. Not only stop on the
[51:42] sanctification. can't even stop on the
[51:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost on the flesh
[51:47] or on the mind
[51:49] even the baptism EVEN THE NEW BIRTH. But
[51:51] then now the for the age we have TO GO
[51:54] ALL THE WAY TO ADOPTION.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; GOD BRINGS YOU TO ADOPTION. THANK GOD.
[51:59] HE HAS PREDESTINATED YOU. He has
[52:01] predestined me to into adoption. AMEN.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; OH LORD, THANK GOD FOR YOUR GRACE.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; How shall I prove my love to him? The
[52:13] question, how shall I prove my love to
[52:15] him? By believing what he said and by
[52:18] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[52:22] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[52:25] come to pass. Sometimes he allows
[52:28] trials, but my attitude towards the love
[52:31] of God that expressed to me is just to
[52:33] live with joy, conduct myself with joy
[52:37] among those trials. Brothers and
[52:39] sisters, this capstone love goes beyond
[52:43] being a millionaire or billionaire.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond that. AMEN. LOOK WHY THE
[52:49] PROPHET IS TAKING inspiration to tell
[52:51] her that with the approval of any of us
[52:53] is in the beloved. He's taking that
[52:55] inspiration from the Bible in Ephesians
[52:58] 1 3:6. If you listen what Ephesians 1,
[53:01] the book of adoption is telling us,
[53:03] blessed be the God and father of our
[53:06] Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with
[53:09] all spiritual blessings.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; He blessed us not with some spiritual
[53:14] blessings. No, but brother Gilbert said
[53:16] it one time so well. It says he blessed
[53:19] us way beyond the blessings only of
[53:21] becoming rich.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Although we want all to become rich.
[53:25] Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Only few people accept to be
[53:29] rich. Wow. Okay.
[53:33] I want to be rich though.
[53:38] Pastor, you say that this year
[53:40] blessings.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; My wife want me to become rich. So,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; I think she needs to go to Sunday
[53:55] school. She distract me a lot when I'm
[53:56] preaching. Why don't you realize that
[53:58] I've mentioned her a lot? That's not
[53:59] good.
[54:05] Now I lost where I was.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. For he has blessed us with all
[54:11] spiritual blessings.
[54:14] ALL SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE EMPHASIS. GOD, THANK YOU FOR
[54:19] GIVING ME ALL the spiritual blessings.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED HEALING IS PART OF THE
[54:24] SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS. YOU NEED
[54:26] RESTORATION IS PART OF THE SPIRITUAL
[54:28] BLESSING. YOU NEED THE JOY OF SALVATION.
[54:31] IT'S PART OF THE SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS.
[54:33] IT'S NOT A PARTIAL BLESSINGS BUT ALL
[54:36] SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS. WE ARE APPROVED IN
[54:40] THE BELOVED. AMEN. IT SAYS HE has bless
[54:42] spiritual in heavenly places in Christ
[54:45] according as he has chosen us in him
[54:49] before the foundation OF THE WORLD.
[54:51] WHERE WERE YOU CHOSEN? IN CHRIST. WHEN
[54:54] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. NOT
[54:57] WHEN YOU TOOK YOUR BAPTISM, NOT WHEN YOU
[54:59] REPENTED, not when you you even got the
[55:02] baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST. NO, YOU WERE
[55:04] CHOSEN IN HIM WAY BEFORE the foundation
[55:06] of the world. SO, YOUR WALK SHOULD NOT
[55:09] BE A WALK OF FEAR. Like I said on
[55:11] Wednesday, it's not a walk of a servant.
[55:13] It's not a walk of begging. NO, IT'S A
[55:16] WALK OF A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. YOU
[55:19] REALIZE WHO YOU ARE. YOU KNOW THAT YOU
[55:22] ARE A SON OF AND A DAUGHTER OF THE KING.
[55:24] AMEN.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR YOUR GRACE IN MY LIFE.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THAT LOVE, I DID NOT LOVE
[55:30] YOU. YOU LOVED me first.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[55:36] It says, "And a heavenly place in Christ
[55:38] according chosen before from that we
[55:40] should be holy and without blame before
[55:42] him in love having predestinated us unto
[55:47] the adoption of the children by Jesus
[55:49] Christ to himself according to the good
[55:52] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[55:54] the glory of his grace wherein he had
[55:57] made us accepted in the beloved." WHY?
[56:01] BECAUSE WHY DID HE GET ACCEPTED IN THE
[56:02] BELOVED? for the praise of the glory of
[56:05] his grace. God like to praise his own
[56:08] grace is his sovereign grace. It means
[56:11] he give that grace to who he wants. And
[56:14] from all the millions of the people that
[56:16] on the earth, God chose you and me.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. How rich is that amazing
[56:24] grace? Amen. I was blind but now I can
[56:27] see. I was A WRETCHED BUT NOW HE FOUND
[56:29] ME. HE SHOWS ME. AMEN. LIKE DAVID, HE
[56:32] TOOK ME FROM THE PLACE I WAS AND HE MADE
[56:35] ME A KING. AMEN. IN HIS KINGDOM. THANK
[56:38] GOD FOR YOUR GRACE. WHAT LOVE. WHAT A
[56:41] MARVELOUS LOVE. WE CAN NEVER DESCRIBE
[56:44] the love of God with our human mind,
[56:46] with our human lips, with our human
[56:48] language. The love of God is way beyond
[56:51] than we can understand.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Why can I what can I say here? The
[56:55] capstone love is not only to make you
[56:58] have a good life. maybe sometimes but
[57:01] the capstone is not only to make you a
[57:03] former nominal Christians although it is
[57:06] good. The capstone is not only to make
[57:08] you justified or good or sanctified
[57:10] although it is good but it also go way
[57:13] beyond to be born again to be filled
[57:15] with the Holy Ghost and to have all the
[57:18] virtue and then to place you as sons and
[57:21] daughters of God.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; The capstone comes for the adoption.
[57:26] Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; If you read the message, the statue of
[57:30] the perfect man, it might look like the
[57:31] prophet is calling it as the Holy
[57:33] Spirit. It's actually the Holy Spirit.
[57:35] Thank God for the Holy Spirit. But the
[57:37] Holy Spirit in our time places us into
[57:40] adoption. The Holy Spirit in our time
[57:42] doesn't stop at the faith level. The
[57:44] Holy Spirit in our time doesn't stop at
[57:46] the virtue level. The Holy Spirit
[57:47] doesn't even stop at the brotherly
[57:49] kindness level. IT COMES ALL THE WAY TO
[57:52] THE ADOPTION. AMEN. You have THE HOLY
[57:54] GHOST THEN YOU ARE PREDESTINATED TO
[57:56] ADOPTION in this age.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; That's what if God want to establish
[58:06] with Israel but Israel did not
[58:09] understand the grace of God. He told
[58:11] Israel in Deuteronomy 7 says the Lord
[58:13] did not set his love upon you nor choose
[58:17] you because you were more in number than
[58:20] any people restored word fellowship. He
[58:23] did not choose you because you are the
[58:24] greatest of all the churches in number
[58:26] and everything. No. Even though small as
[58:29] you are, God's love is upon you.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; God put his love upon you. Amen. He's
[58:35] watching over you. HE TAKES CARE OF YOU.
[58:37] HE'S A GREAT SHEPHERD OVER YOU. AMEN.
[58:40] BECAUSE HIS LOVE IS UPON YOU. If his
[58:42] love IS UPON YOU, NO ONE CAN SEPARATE
[58:44] you from the love OF GOD. WHEN PAUL
[58:47] REALIZED THAT SAYS, "OH, I REALIZE THAT
[58:49] NOTHING CAN separate me from the love of
[58:52] God." Whether it is tribulation,
[58:54] persecution, NAKEDNESS, WHATEVER THIS
[58:57] MEAN, POVERTY OR OR WE WELFARE, WHATEVER
[58:59] IT MIGHT BE, NOTHING CAN SEPARATE ME
[59:02] FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. IT'S NOT A
[59:04] REACTIVE LOVE. IT IS ELECTIVE LOVE WAY
[59:08] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. IF
[59:11] HE LOVED ME THERE, HE CAN'T CHANGE HIS
[59:13] LOVE. AMEN.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; GOD DOES NOT HAVE ANOTHER OPTION. HE
[59:18] DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN B FOR YOU. HE ONLY
[59:20] HAVE A PLAN A. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE
[59:22] ONLY PLAN.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; He will do everything. HE WILL SHAKE
[59:26] HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR YOU NOT TO BE LOST.
[59:28] AMEN.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; If he loved you.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; JACOB MAYBE DID NOT UNDERSTAND. HE'S
[59:36] GOING THROUGH ALL those trials and
[59:38] doesn't UNDERSTAND WHY WHY WHY. I WAS
[59:41] JUST LISTENING TO JACOB and then God
[59:42] CAME AND SAID, "JACOB, I HAVE LOVED YOU.
[59:47] I HAVE ELECTED YOU. YOUR SEED SHALL
[59:50] POSSESS THIS LAND, JACOB.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; OH, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF LABAN WHO'S
[59:54] PERSECUTED ME." YES, JACOB, I STILL LOVE
[59:57] YOU. MY BLESSING IS UPON YOU. I CAN'T
[1:00:00] CHANGE MY BLESSING.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; I CAN'T CHANGE MY MIND. I CAN'T CHANGE
[1:00:05] MY IDEA UPON YOU.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; I LOVED YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:00:09] WORLD. AMEN. SOMETIMES YOU LOOK AT
[1:00:12] YOURSELF FOR SITUATIONS. Does really God
[1:00:14] loves me? Oh, look at Esau. He is many.
[1:00:17] HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S PROSPEROUS. OH,
[1:00:20] JACOB, YOU ARE LOVED.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; RESTORED WORD FELLOWSHIP. YOU ARE LOVED,
[1:00:25] MY GOD.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; I PUT MY LOVE UPON YOU. AMEN.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; For you are the fewest of all people.
[1:00:36] But because the Lord loved you and
[1:00:39] because you will keep the oath which he
[1:00:41] had swn unto your fathers.
[1:00:45] Thank God for his love. God's love is
[1:00:47] not is the cause of our salvation.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; He's the cause of our redemption.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; God's love is not is not the the result
[1:00:59] of what we have done.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; It's not the result of what Israel did.
[1:01:04] No, it's not the result of what Abraham
[1:01:07] did. No, God's love was the cause, was
[1:01:10] the origin, WAS THE ALPHA, AND IT IS THE
[1:01:13] OMEGA. NOW,
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT STARTED WITH GOD'S LOVE,
[1:01:16] IS ENDING WITH GOD'S LOVE.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; IT START WITH GOD'S GRACE IS ENDING WITH
[1:01:21] GOD'S GRACE. AMEN.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; All is about God's grace. God is the one
[1:01:26] who draws you first. Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; And then you respond to his drawing.
[1:01:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; It's not YOU COMING. LORD GOD, I've been
[1:01:33] looking for you. I've been searching for
[1:01:35] you. No, NO, NO, NO. GOD HAS BEEN
[1:01:38] SEARCHING FOR YOU ALL THE TIME.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; HE PUT THAT DESIRE. HE PUT THAT HOOK
[1:01:42] INSIDE OF YOU. NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE,
[1:01:44] HE WAS JUST DRAWING YOU. He was drawing
[1:01:46] you. He was drawing you. If God has
[1:01:49] already elected you, there is no way you
[1:01:51] can escape. NO MATTER WHAT IS YOUR PAST,
[1:01:54] NO MATTER WHERE YOU WENT THROUGH, no
[1:01:55] matter HOW THE FLESH, THE MIND HAS BEEN
[1:01:58] CORRUPTED. THANK GOD FOR THE SEED OF GOD
[1:02:00] INSIDE OF YOU. IT CAN NEVER BE
[1:02:03] CORRUPTED. GOD WILL DRAW YOU BACK TO
[1:02:05] HIM. AMEN.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; OH, NOW THE BRIDE KNOWS WHERE WHO SHE
[1:02:10] IS. SHE'S STANDING NOW ON THE ON ON ON
[1:02:13] THE FOUNDATION OF GRACE. AMEN. SHE'S NOT
[1:02:15] BEEN STUMBLING. SHE'S NOT BEEN GOING ONE
[1:02:17] WAY OR THE OTHER. OH, I MADE A MISTAKE
[1:02:19] NOW. NOW I'M LOST. NO. AMEN. YOU YOU
[1:02:22] MAKE A MISTAKE. YOU STAND UP.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD I MADE A MISTAKE, BUT YOU GAVE
[1:02:26] ME A DESIRE TO STAND UP. I STILL WANT TO
[1:02:29] GO BACK TO CHURCH. I STILL WANT TO READ
[1:02:31] THE WORD OF GOD. I STILL WANT TO PRAY,
[1:02:34] LORD. I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING IT, BUT
[1:02:36] STILL SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME IS PUSHING
[1:02:38] ME, LORD. I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT SERVING
[1:02:41] THE LORD.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; WHO DID THAT? GOD DID THAT. PUT INSIDE
[1:02:44] OF YOU.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Others are indifferent. They don't feel
[1:02:48] it. THEY DON'T FEEL THAT TAG ANYMORE.
[1:02:50] BUT YOU STILL FEEL IT.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE WE STRUGGLING? BECAUSE WE ARE
[1:02:56] PART OF GOD. THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE IS
[1:02:58] FIGHTING THE FLESH. THE FLESH IS TELLING
[1:03:01] YOU YOU ARE NOT WORTHY. BUT INSIDE
[1:03:02] SOMETHING SAYS YOU ARE WORTHY.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; But other PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THEY DON'T
[1:03:06] FEEL THAT CONFLICT ANYMORE. THEY DON'T
[1:03:08] FEEL THAT CONFLICT. AMEN. REMEMBER THE
[1:03:10] THE white dog and the black dog.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people only HAVE THE BLACK
[1:03:15] DOG.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THERE IS A
[1:03:17] WHITE DOG
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WHITE DOG IS SO DEAD.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; BUT THANK GOD THAT I STILL HAVE THAT
[1:03:23] WHITE DOG. I FIGHT WITH THE BLACK DOG,
[1:03:25] BUT I FEED THE WHITE DOG. THE WHITE DOG
[1:03:27] TAKES OVER. LORD, THE INNER MAN IS
[1:03:30] GETTING IS GROWING. THANK GOD FOR THAT.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Let's put the DEVIL A LITTLE BIT DOWN.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; DEVIL, YOU ARE DEFEATED. I'M A SON AND
[1:03:41] DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN FOR THEN PREDESTINATED TO
[1:03:45] LIFE.
[1:03:51] SEE, God love
[1:03:54] God loved Israel from the very
[1:03:55] beginning.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And he says with all Israel, he says,
[1:03:59] "The Lord has appeared of old unto me
[1:04:02] and said, "Yeah, I have loved thee with
[1:04:03] an everlasting love. Therefore, with
[1:04:06] loving kindness have I drawn thee."
[1:04:08] God's love is everlasting.
[1:04:11] IS ETERNAL. AMEN. BEFORE YOU EVEN
[1:04:14] RESPONDED,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; he already loved you.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; God draws you. As I said, he he loved
[1:04:20] you be HE LOVED YOU BEFORE YOU
[1:04:22] RESPONDED. GOD LOVED even when his
[1:04:24] people when when sometimes you rebelled
[1:04:27] against him. He still LOVED YOU. GOD'S
[1:04:30] LOVE PRECEDED YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD
[1:04:32] OF GOD.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Sometimes you say, "No, I I did
[1:04:36] not obey, so God doesn't love me." NO,
[1:04:38] GOD STILL LOVES YOU.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE MIGHT GET TO THAT PART. Maybe
[1:04:41] you NEED TO OBEY MORE. BUT GOD STILL
[1:04:43] LOVED YOU. EVEN IN YOUR DISOBEDIENCE,
[1:04:46] GOD STILL LOVED YOU. HE DID NOT LOVE YOU
[1:04:48] WHEN YOU BECAME A VERY good Christian.
[1:04:51] NO, NOW YOU REALIZE IT. OH, all this
[1:04:55] time I've been mistreating him. Oh God,
[1:04:57] forgive me, Lord. That's why we repent
[1:04:59] because that love struck you. Oh, how
[1:05:02] come I've been mistreating the one who
[1:05:05] loved me more than anything else?
[1:05:07] Sometimes I put priority or the love of
[1:05:09] my friends and different things of I I I
[1:05:11] I I gave them priority before God. But
[1:05:15] now you realize, oh the love of God has
[1:05:17] always been there. He was there waiting
[1:05:20] for you.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Like that father waiting for the
[1:05:22] prodigal son.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; He's waiting for you every time. Every
[1:05:26] time. The love for the father did no
[1:05:28] change.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; He's still waiting for him. I know he's
[1:05:31] going to COME BACK.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; NOW OUR SPIRITUAL FATHER. AMEN. WHERE WE
[1:05:35] COME FROM. WE THE LOWEST PLACE like I
[1:05:38] was listening to one brother says the
[1:05:40] lowest place you can go as a son of God
[1:05:42] the lowest place you can go the lowest
[1:05:45] place you can go you CAN GO NO MATTER
[1:05:47] HOW GO YOU WANT TO GO you can never
[1:05:50] become a pig even if you eat with the
[1:05:53] pig even if YOU YOU STAY THERE AND SLEEP
[1:05:56] WITH THE PIG YOU CAN NEVER BECOME A PIG
[1:05:59] NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE STILL A SON AND
[1:06:01] DAUGHTER OF GOD EVEN IN THAT DIRTY LIFE
[1:06:04] YOU ARE STILL A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:06:07] ONE TIME THE LOVE OF GOD WILL COME AND
[1:06:09] PICK YOU UP FROM THERE. YOU COME BACK TO
[1:06:12] YOURSELF SAY WHAT AM I DOING HERE? MY
[1:06:15] FATHER OWNS SO MANY THINGS. WHY AM I
[1:06:19] STAYING HERE IN THE PIG HERE? LET ME GO
[1:06:21] BACK TO MY FATHER. IF THE LOVE OF GOD
[1:06:24] BRING YOU BACK TO HIM, GLORY TO HIS
[1:06:27] NAME.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR HIS LOVE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; That's the grace of God in our lives.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; GOD'S LOVE PRECEDE YOUR OBEDIENCE. GOD
[1:06:40] LOVE loves you before maturity, before
[1:06:43] faithfulness, before even understanding.
[1:06:46] That's why he says charity never fails.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; GOD'S LOVE NEVER FAILS. WHY HE CAN'T
[1:06:53] FAIL? BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE WHO STARTED
[1:06:55] IT.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE WHO INITIATED IT. IT'S NOT
[1:06:58] ME who initiated. IT'S NOT YOU INITIATE
[1:07:00] IT. IF YOU INITIATE IT, YOU WILL FALL.
[1:07:03] IF I INITIATE IT, I WILL FALL. BUT THANK
[1:07:06] GOD, WHEN IT'S HIM WHO INITIATED,
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN IT'S HIM WHO START SOMETHING, OH
[1:07:10] GOD, HE STARTED THE WALK WITH ABRAHAM.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM, I start the walk with you.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; I have blessed you, ABRAHAM.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE I DONE? NOTHING. BUT I STILL
[1:07:21] LOVE you and I've chosen you and I've
[1:07:24] blessed you and I'm starting a WALK WITH
[1:07:27] YOU. AMEN. NOW THAT I'VE STARTED WITH
[1:07:29] YOU, YOU CAN NEVER BE LOST. ABRAHAM, YOU
[1:07:32] WILL GO HERE. SOMETIMES YOU GO BACK AND
[1:07:34] YOU GO DIFFERENT PLACES, BUT AS A GPS,
[1:07:37] YOU WILL GO TO THE FINAL DESTINATION.
[1:07:39] ABRAHAM,
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NOT BE LOST. ABRAHAM,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT THE ENEMY WILL COME, NO
[1:07:45] MATTER SODOM AND GOMORRAH, YOU WILL
[1:07:48] NEVER BE DEFEATED. ABRAHAM,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM, YOU WILL FIGHT AGAINST THOSE
[1:07:52] KINGS OF SOD OF THOSE WHO TOOK of those
[1:07:54] WHO TOOK LOT. YOU ARE NOT A SOLDIER, BUT
[1:07:57] BECAUSE I CHOSEN YOU, YOU ARE NOT GOING
[1:07:59] TO BE DEFEATED. LOVE WILL NEVER FAIL.
[1:08:02] AMEN. LOVE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE VICTORY.
[1:08:06] AND HE BROUGHT HIM BACK. AMEN.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE THE ROYAL SEED OF ABRAHAM.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PART OF THAT PROMISE. YOU ARE
[1:08:16] PART OF THAT VICTORY. AMEN.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN NEVER BE LOST AS GOD CAN NEVER
[1:08:21] BE LOST.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Romans 5:8 says, "But God commanded his
[1:08:30] love towards us in that while we were
[1:08:33] yet sinners, CHRIST DIED FOR US." BEFORE
[1:08:36] YOU WERE BORN, HE DIED FOR YOU.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; The solution was there before the
[1:08:41] problem.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE THINK THIS, OH, THIS IS A
[1:08:44] NEW PROBLEM. NO, THE SOLUTION WAS
[1:08:47] ALREADY THERE BEFORE THE PROBLEM ARISES.
[1:08:51] SO, WHO IS STRONGER? IS IT THE PROBLEM
[1:08:52] OR THE SOLUTION? THE SOLUTION IS
[1:08:55] STRONGER BECAUSE IT WAS THERE BEFORE THE
[1:08:58] PROBLEM CAME. AMEN.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; The problem comes only to manifest that
[1:09:02] the solution was there.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; If there was no problem, YOU WOULD NOT
[1:09:06] RECOGNIZE GOD IN THOSE ATTRIBUTES. BUT
[1:09:08] NOW BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, YOU
[1:09:10] RECOGNIZE HIM. SO, OH THANK GOD YOU ARE
[1:09:13] THE HEALER.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD YOU RESTORED MY FAMILY. THANK
[1:09:17] GOD YOU SAVED ME. THANK GOD YOU GAVE ME
[1:09:20] THE HEALING POWER. THANK GOD YOU GAVE ME
[1:09:23] THE HOLY SPIRIT TO LIVE IN THE TIME OF
[1:09:26] LARIA. AMEN. YOU CANNOT DO BY YOURSELF,
[1:09:28] BUT GOD GAVE YOU THE VICTORY.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THANK GOD FOR THE CONDITIONS
[1:09:33] OF LARIA. IT'S SHOWING WHAT GOD HAS PUT
[1:09:36] INSIDE OF US. AMEN.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS BRIDE CAN NEVER FAIL. WHY SHE
[1:09:40] CAN'T FAIL? SHE HAS RECEIVED GOD
[1:09:42] HIMSELF.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; SHE HAS RECEIVED THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:09:46] CHARITY CAN NEVER FAIL. AMEN.
[1:09:50] OH my
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; first John 4:10 SAYS F WHEREIN IS LOVE
[1:09:56] not that we loved God but that he loved
[1:09:59] us and he sent his son to be the
[1:10:03] propitiation of our sins.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; So this redemption salvation is grounded
[1:10:09] is rooted in God's action not in our
[1:10:12] action. Redemption is rooted IN GOD'S
[1:10:16] WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR US not what we
[1:10:18] have done for him.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; So the spirit as I went the prophet
[1:10:24] prophet said exposition seven churches
[1:10:26] as in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls
[1:10:28] out for the children not being born
[1:10:31] neither having done any good of evil
[1:10:33] that the purpose of God according to the
[1:10:35] election might stand not of works but of
[1:10:38] him that calleth. His love is elective.
[1:10:41] It is his love for his elect and his
[1:10:44] love for them is apart from human merit.
[1:10:48] For it says that the purpose of God
[1:10:50] stands in election which is exactly
[1:10:53] opposite works on anything man has in
[1:10:56] himself.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Because before the children were born he
[1:10:59] had already said Jacob have I loved and
[1:11:02] Esau have I HATED. BEFORE THEY'VE DONE
[1:11:05] anything grace was already there.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Election was already there. So that the
[1:11:10] the purpose of God shall stand. God
[1:11:14] called you. I share that quote. God
[1:11:15] called you for a purpose. God called you
[1:11:18] for a reason. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND
[1:11:20] IT. YOU MIGHT NOT NOT EAT IN FULLNESS.
[1:11:22] But there is a reason
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DESPITE ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE, HE
[1:11:26] HAS chosen you. Why me? Why me, Lord?
[1:11:29] Usually we use that in the wrong way.
[1:11:31] This has happened to me. Why me? Why me?
[1:11:33] But I'll put it in in a good way. From
[1:11:36] all these things, why me, Lord? Why? Why
[1:11:39] only me? Since some of us only one
[1:11:42] person in that family, the whole family
[1:11:44] is still struggling. You we still
[1:11:46] praying for them. We and by God's grace
[1:11:48] be but for the longest time maybe in
[1:11:50] life you you have been there yourself
[1:11:52] only you why they can't see it. Why they
[1:11:54] CAN'T SEE IT? WHY THEY CAN'T SEE IT? WHY
[1:11:56] ME LORD? WHY? I'm not the intellectual
[1:11:58] one. I'm not I'm not the the the
[1:12:02] sharp one, the sharpest one. I have no
[1:12:04] quality on my own. BUT WHY ME? WHY ME?
[1:12:08] GOD'S GRACE.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; First John 4:19 says, "I love him
[1:12:21] because he first love us."
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Now it goes the other part. Now I love
[1:12:26] him
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; because he first loved me.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; If you have the revelation of the love
[1:12:32] of God, it has to produce a love back.
[1:12:37] How what how can't you love someone who
[1:12:39] died for you
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; in the natural? How can't you love
[1:12:43] someone who paid your debt?
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; You're struggling. You're struggling.
[1:12:48] Struggling sometimes. I think it
[1:12:50] happened to me one time. I went to, you
[1:12:52] know, Walmart can just stop you for one
[1:12:55] cent.
[1:12:58] No, you're not letting me sense.
[1:13:01] I think I came from Europe but I mean
[1:13:04] you sense really no I can't let you pass
[1:13:07] oh mama
[1:13:13] I paid 100 now sense is missing you
[1:13:16] can't let me no and someone just comes
[1:13:18] you know it's okay I'll pay for that
[1:13:21] oh thank you thank you thank you thank
[1:13:24] you if for one sense I'm thanking you
[1:13:27] thank you thank you how much more for
[1:13:29] all my sins for all MY PAST AND FOR ALL
[1:13:32] MY GOD HAS PUT THAT IN THE SEA OF
[1:13:35] FORGETFULNESS AND NOT TO REMEMBER THEM
[1:13:37] ANYMORE. HOW THANKFUL SHOULD I BE LORD?
[1:13:40] THANK GOD FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IN MY
[1:13:42] LIFE.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I love you because you first loved me.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; That's why I say how shall I prove my
[1:13:53] love to him? by believing what he said
[1:13:56] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[1:14:00] the trials that he in his wisdom allows
[1:14:02] to come to pass. Sometimes he might
[1:14:05] allow some trials but for a purpose to
[1:14:07] show his glory to show his power is not
[1:14:09] to bring frustration. It's not the order
[1:14:11] of frustration but even in those trials
[1:14:14] just show the right attitude. Thank God
[1:14:16] for THE VICTORY. THANK GOD FOR YOUR
[1:14:18] LOVE. THANK YOU GOD FOR THE DELIVERANCE.
[1:14:21] KEEP CONFESSING POSITIVE. IN THE
[1:14:23] CHRISTIANITY, THERE IS NO NEGATIVITY.
[1:14:25] DON'T SAY, "OH, NO, I'm here. Why this?
[1:14:27] Oh, no. CURSE ME THE DAY OF MY BIRTH."
[1:14:30] AND NO, NO. THANK GOD FOR YOUR GRACE.
[1:14:32] THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE. THANK GOD FOR
[1:14:35] SALVATION. THANK GOD FOR ETERNITY THAT
[1:14:38] IS WAITING FOR ME.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; And now you start expressing your love
[1:14:46] towards him. You start serving him. You
[1:14:49] did not love Yeah. I did not love you
[1:14:51] because that God says I did not love you
[1:14:54] because of your works. I did not love
[1:14:56] you because of your works. Now you have
[1:14:57] that revelation. Now you say God now God
[1:15:00] want to say because you realize that
[1:15:02] love inside of me. Now I want you also
[1:15:04] to love me unconditionally.
[1:15:06] Now you start loving God unconditionally
[1:15:08] too. Say no Lord I'm not loving you only
[1:15:13] when you give me a job.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Whether job or not job but God I still
[1:15:17] love you Lord. Now it's you manifesting
[1:15:19] the love to God unconditionally. Lord,
[1:15:22] am I have this? I might not have this. I
[1:15:25] still love you, Lord.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; People might love me, but they might not
[1:15:28] love me. I still love you, Lord.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; This might happen, this might not
[1:15:32] happen. I still love you, Lord.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; It's my time to express my unconditional
[1:15:36] love towards you.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, make your love more real inside of
[1:15:42] me because agapa love is unconditional.
[1:15:45] Now we want that agapa love to be inside
[1:15:47] of us to love him unconditionally.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes even to love our brother and
[1:15:53] our sister unconditionally.
[1:15:55] It's not because they did this to me now
[1:15:57] I have to love it. They didn't do that.
[1:15:58] No, you don't re it's not a reactive
[1:16:01] love. That was a brotherly love. It is
[1:16:03] STILL IMPORTANT BROTHER BUT
[1:16:05] UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. I GOT POWER LOVE IS
[1:16:08] UNCONDITIONAL. I will still love you no
[1:16:11] matter what. I want your salvation. That
[1:16:14] will be my purpose. I want your
[1:16:16] salvation. You have to be your purpose.
[1:16:17] You want my salvation. Amen.
[1:16:20] Amen. And the prophet will simplify it
[1:16:23] in very well. I like the way he
[1:16:24] simplified. And I'll just read the way
[1:16:26] he simplified where it knocks the
[1:16:28] prophets out of the legal list. Say yes
[1:16:30] sir. In adoption tree says but brother
[1:16:33] let me tell you it's not by works but by
[1:16:35] grace are we saved that by faith. Yes
[1:16:38] sir. I won't condemn legalist brethren.
[1:16:40] They are my brothers and they'll be
[1:16:42] there just the same as any of the rest
[1:16:44] of them will be there because God has
[1:16:46] for Danny's church to be there. But just
[1:16:49] the thing you keep the people so to up
[1:16:52] they don't know what today maybe well
[1:16:54] maybe I uh you know because you you you
[1:16:59] shake their ground you am I saved really
[1:17:04] don't leave them there.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the message of the hour.
[1:17:07] He didn't leave us there. So no
[1:17:10] sometimes it can be hard. It can be mom
[1:17:12] says you know let's sing more songs. I
[1:17:13] know the message was sharp because he
[1:17:15] doesn't want to leave the bride there.
[1:17:17] So no you you I I told you so hard
[1:17:20] things because I love you. I don't want
[1:17:21] I don't I don't want you to lose your
[1:17:23] privilege living as a Christian but I'm
[1:17:25] not preaching this for you to feel like
[1:17:27] you are condemned that you can't make
[1:17:29] it. No I I just want you to live as a
[1:17:32] Christian as a son and daughter of God.
[1:17:33] BUT STAND UP. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; So just let them know as long as they
[1:17:38] got the hang of the world, they're not
[1:17:40] they are not there to begin with. But I
[1:17:43] don't leave now it says the power of
[1:17:45] life. I don't live true to my wife
[1:17:46] because I think she will divorce me. I
[1:17:49] live true to my wife because I love her.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; It's a legal position that we have taken
[1:17:56] that we love one another. Amen. First
[1:17:58] before it could be there I had to be a
[1:18:01] love. I love her. Although I believe if
[1:18:04] I done something wrong, she will forgive
[1:18:06] me. Still, I wouldn't do it anyhow.
[1:18:09] Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Now you love your wife. You are not
[1:18:12] living under under fear. If I do this,
[1:18:15] she will divorce me. If I if I do this
[1:18:17] or she will go away. If you are in that
[1:18:19] state, it's a
[1:18:21] you need grace. You need come and see
[1:18:23] the pastor
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; because that's not good. Living under
[1:18:27] fear. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. You you
[1:18:31] are relaxed.
[1:18:34] Sometimes
[1:18:36] we become too relaxed.
[1:18:39] Where is he going to go in here? That's
[1:18:41] not the attitude.
[1:18:44] I'm probably put a balance. Is it okay?
[1:18:50] Love is boiling. You you you know you
[1:18:52] know you know I'll just put my own
[1:18:54] examples. I don't put you know when when
[1:18:57] I was in courtship I did so many things.
[1:19:00] I bought so many skirts. Oh my goodness.
[1:19:03] So many things and things and her
[1:19:06] because I wanted to impress her, impress
[1:19:08] her, impress her, impress her. And then
[1:19:12] when she got hooked, that's it.
[1:19:15] I kind of reduced a little bit.
[1:19:22] Someone says not good, right? That's
[1:19:24] where I was going. Yeah, that's that's
[1:19:25] not good. But I kind of reduced a little
[1:19:27] bit. But let me tell you that works that
[1:19:31] I started it took her. All right, I have
[1:19:33] to express my love towards her. But let
[1:19:35] me tell you once I got married, I have
[1:19:39] worked more
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; than when I was in courtship.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; I've worked more for her, I've done
[1:19:45] greater things that if there was no
[1:19:48] love, if the things I'm doing after
[1:19:50] being married, if I did that in
[1:19:52] courtship, I would have given up because
[1:19:55] no,
[1:19:57] right? Maybe I was too selfish, right?
[1:19:59] You know, boy, you are too proud of
[1:20:01] yourself and but marriage kinds of makes
[1:20:04] you a little bit humble and
[1:20:05] understanding and everything. Now the
[1:20:07] love has become mature. But I've done
[1:20:09] more being married than when I was in
[1:20:12] courtship because I love her more.
[1:20:14] That's the same thing for the Lord Jesus
[1:20:16] Christ. Amen. So when you are married,
[1:20:20] when the love of God is expressed in
[1:20:22] your heart, you love him more. You even
[1:20:25] do things way more than if it was under
[1:20:28] the law. You have to do this. You have
[1:20:30] to do this. You have to do this. You
[1:20:32] have to do this. You have to do this.
[1:20:35] Oh, no. God, I don't want to be in that
[1:20:37] stage where I feel like it's a burden.
[1:20:38] When it's a duty, when they're forcing
[1:20:40] me, WE ARE PUSHING ME. NO, NO, NO, NO,
[1:20:43] NO. I WANT IT TO BE LOVE. FATHER, I'M
[1:20:46] EXPRESSING MY LOVE TO YOU. I'M DOING
[1:20:49] THINGS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, LORD. THE
[1:20:51] PROPHET SAYS, "WHETHER I PREACH OR
[1:20:52] PREACH, I DON'T PREACH, I'LL STILL BE
[1:20:54] SAVED."
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I WILL STILL BE SAVED AND I KNOW
[1:20:57] I'LL BE SAVED. BUT BECAUSE I LOVE GOD, I
[1:21:00] PREACH BECAUSE I LOVE GOD AND I WANT THE
[1:21:03] PEOPLE OF GOD TO BE SAVED. AMEN.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE ATTITUDE WE HAVE
[1:21:09] AS A BELIEVERS, YOU KNOW, I will do
[1:21:11] things for God only if I have a title.
[1:21:13] If I have do things, OH, BAD BAD BAD
[1:21:16] START TO BEGIN WITH. NO, LORD, I WILL
[1:21:18] SERVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT. I'LL BE
[1:21:20] FAITHFUL NO MATTER WHAT. I WILL GIVE MY
[1:21:23] ALL NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE I HAVE A
[1:21:25] REALIZATION OF THE LOVE OF GOD TOWARDS
[1:21:27] ME. ONCE YOU HAVE THAT LOVE OF GOD, LET
[1:21:30] ME TELL YOU, God will put you under
[1:21:33] adoption. Says now he's thinking like
[1:21:36] me. Now he has unconditional love. He
[1:21:40] doesn't do things for pride, for for for
[1:21:43] for popularity, FOR MONEY, FOR NOW HE'S
[1:21:47] ENTITLED to become an adopted son,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; an adopted daughter of God. Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; I was reading Jacob again, listening to
[1:21:57] Job, Jacob Bible. Jacob loved Rachel.
[1:22:02] Seven years was like nothing.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Because for the love he had for Rachel.
[1:22:07] Like nothing. Just
[1:22:11] if there was no love seven years for
[1:22:13] Jacob,
[1:22:15] oh no. Why this? Why is mistreating me
[1:22:18] like
[1:22:20] he got Leia? And then they gave him Why
[1:22:22] did you Why did you deceive me? No, you
[1:22:26] need another seven years. Oh, no
[1:22:28] problem. I BECAUSE HE LOVED SO MUCH,
[1:22:31] RICHARD. NOW, PUT IT IN THE SPIRITUAL.
[1:22:34] AMEN. GOD, I I I PRAYED FOR THIS AND IT
[1:22:37] didn't happen this year. Oh, thank God.
[1:22:40] I WILL STILL LOVE YOU. I'LL STILL SERVE
[1:22:42] YOU. I'LL STILL BE FAITHFUL IN SMALL
[1:22:44] THINGS AND IN BIG THINGS. FATHER,
[1:22:46] EXPRESS MY LOVE TOWARDS YOU BECAUSE FOR
[1:22:48] ME IT'S NOT A DUTY. IT'S NOT A CHARGE.
[1:22:51] IT'S NOT FORCING. IT'S NOT IT'S not a
[1:22:53] It's not IT'S NOT YOU HAVE TO COME TO
[1:22:55] CHURCH. YOU HAVE NO, NO, LORD. I'M
[1:22:58] EXPRESSING MY LOVE TOWARDS YOU, LORD.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Is prayer. Oh God, help us not to
[1:23:04] be alar.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Shall I just pray because I have to eat
[1:23:06] my religious duty?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Let me just pray a little bit. I feel
[1:23:11] good like I I'm a Christian. No, no, no,
[1:23:13] no, no. Prayer is a desire. Father, I
[1:23:15] just want to say I love you, Lord.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your grace in my life.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; It's good to repeat even things. Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; But as long as it come sincerely from
[1:23:25] your heart, Lord, I told you yesterday I
[1:23:28] love you for your grace, your mercy.
[1:23:30] Today I say again, I love you for your
[1:23:32] grace and your mercy. Because you loved
[1:23:34] me first. I LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU LOVED
[1:23:37] ME FIRST.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Thank God for your grace.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; I in the same court.
[1:23:49] Although I believe I've done something
[1:23:50] wrong, she'll still forgive me. Still I
[1:23:53] still
[1:23:55] I wouldn't do anything anyhow. That's
[1:23:57] the way it is with Christ. I'm 50. If I
[1:24:00] leave to be 90 or 100, I have 50 years
[1:24:03] to preach and never preach a time and go
[1:24:05] down and sit on the river. I'm saved
[1:24:08] anyhow. God saved me by his grace
[1:24:10] unmmerited of anything I ever could do,
[1:24:13] did do or anything else. I preach
[1:24:15] because I love him and I love his
[1:24:17] people. And that's the reason I know
[1:24:19] I've passed from death onto life because
[1:24:21] that I love them and I go after them. No
[1:24:24] matter what kind of condition they are
[1:24:25] in, I go after them anyhow. Go get them
[1:24:29] anyhow. Pull them anyhow. If ministers
[1:24:32] disagree and others disagree,
[1:24:34] denomination denomination disagree, that
[1:24:37] don't stop me. That's nothing. I didn't
[1:24:39] stop him. He didn't stop him. He came
[1:24:41] right in the midst of unbelief and
[1:24:43] didn't stop him. He moved right on
[1:24:46] anyhow. That's what we do. That's what
[1:24:48] we do. Go out and get them and catch
[1:24:50] them anyhow. Or the brother doesn't
[1:24:52] believe anymore and anything or we
[1:24:54] disagreed and we just lift him. No, you
[1:24:56] leave him. No, no, no. That's a wrong
[1:24:58] attitude. Go still after him. Still look
[1:25:00] for occasion and coffee and anything
[1:25:02] because you want salvation. You want him
[1:25:05] to be saved. Don't leave him. Amen.
[1:25:08] No matter. No matter rich grab. Hold on
[1:25:12] with all your might. You don't know who
[1:25:14] they are. Save them. That because that's
[1:25:17] because of love. Not because that I have
[1:25:19] to, but because I love because you love.
[1:25:22] Oh, I ought to make that right with that
[1:25:24] woman.
[1:25:26] He says this attitude sometimes we have.
[1:25:28] I ought to make that right with that
[1:25:30] woman. But I tell you right now, I guess
[1:25:33] because I go to church, I ought to make
[1:25:35] it right because I go to church. Yeah.
[1:25:40] Like brother Ed used to say,
[1:25:42] oh, I think took it from Pastor Herald.
[1:25:45] You know, I I have to go to church on
[1:25:47] time because I'm the pastor.
[1:25:49] I'm not on time, it's not good.
[1:25:54] Yeah. Yeah. So when you're not a pastor,
[1:25:55] you'll be late. Okay.
[1:25:58] So I know I have to show that I'm
[1:26:00] because I'm a preacher. I have to be
[1:26:01] there. No, it's not the title that makes
[1:26:04] you think do things wrong attitude. No.
[1:26:07] Father, help me to be faithful before
[1:26:10] any title, before anything before. Amen.
[1:26:14] That's where adoption comes. Even in
[1:26:16] natural at work, you you it it it's easy
[1:26:20] to give a job title to someone who's
[1:26:23] already doing it.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Says, "Okay, he's doing this all the
[1:26:26] time. It's just a title to the title
[1:26:29] doesn't make him do it. He's already
[1:26:30] doing it."
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You become a manager
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; because you're already showing it.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; It's not you you make you a manager then
[1:26:38] you start. How do you manage people?
[1:26:40] Hey,
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; no, no, no, no, no. Wrong attitude. God
[1:26:44] says, "I'm going to bring you the
[1:26:45] adoption. What you need, just love me."
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Brother will simplify the whole message
[1:26:51] into love God.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Just love God.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And that's always my prayer. God, give
[1:26:56] me more of your love.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; If I really love you, I will do things.
[1:27:00] I know what I've done because I've loved
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; in the natural. I've done great things
[1:27:04] and things I couldn't think I could do.
[1:27:07] But when I loved, I just did them
[1:27:10] easily. The same thing will apply
[1:27:12] spiritually. If I God gives me just his
[1:27:15] love, the real love of God, I will do
[1:27:19] way beyond anything they can do. Say do
[1:27:22] this, do this, do this, do this, this
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; if I just love him.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; So our prayer is to be God, give me more
[1:27:29] of your love.
[1:27:40] says
[1:27:42] you are the one ought says I guess
[1:27:44] because I go to church I ought to go
[1:27:45] make it right. No, you are the one ought
[1:27:47] to get right first. If you haven't got
[1:27:50] the love of God in your heart, something
[1:27:53] another makes you know that you are
[1:27:54] wrong. Something another makes you know
[1:27:57] that you are wrong. Then you go then you
[1:27:59] go make it right with God. Then you will
[1:28:01] make it right with your neighbor. Amen.
[1:28:04] Jesus said the same thing. If you come
[1:28:05] to an altar, remember there's an oath
[1:28:08] against the neighbor or the brother. Go
[1:28:09] make it right first. Amen. Let me say
[1:28:12] this.
[1:28:13] So I'll say you do more under grace and
[1:28:16] love than under the law. If you don't
[1:28:19] yield yourself more to God under grace
[1:28:21] or love, then there is something wrong.
[1:28:24] That's why Paul could could take that in
[1:28:26] Romans 6. It says for sin shall not have
[1:28:29] dominion over you for you are not under
[1:28:32] the law
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; but under grace.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But I thought the law if they
[1:28:38] says do do then then I will be then sin
[1:28:42] won't have any dominion over say no
[1:28:44] that's a wrong Israel failed already.
[1:28:47] Don't restart what Israel already failed
[1:28:49] on. No you are under grace now. Because
[1:28:52] you are under grace sin should not have
[1:28:54] dominion over you. What shall YOU DO
[1:28:57] THAT? JUST YIELD TO GOD. GOD, I YIELD
[1:29:00] MYSELF TO YOU.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; LIKE THE BROTHER sang at the beginning,
[1:29:03] LORD, I SURRENDER ALL. LORD, I SURRENDER
[1:29:06] ALL. THE MORE you yield, THE MORE YOU
[1:29:09] SURRENDER, THE MORE YOU PRAY, THE MORE
[1:29:12] YOU LOVE HIM, SIN WILL NOT have dominion
[1:29:15] over you.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; We are living in THE AGE OF PERFECT
[1:29:19] LOVE.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; This is the bright age. THIS IS OUR AGE.
[1:29:24] AMEN. FOR YOU AND US to be manifest your
[1:29:26] sons and daughters of God. What then
[1:29:28] shall we sin because we are not under
[1:29:31] the law, but under grace, God forbid?
[1:29:34] Know ye not that to whom you yield
[1:29:36] yourself, servants obey, his servant ye
[1:29:40] are to whom you obey, whether of sin
[1:29:42] unto death or or obedience unto
[1:29:44] righteousness. But God be thanked. We
[1:29:48] say this morning, God be thank
[1:29:51] ye were servant of sin, but you have
[1:29:54] obeyed from the heart.
[1:29:58] That form of doctrine which was
[1:29:59] delivered unto you. Yes, obedience is
[1:30:02] still there. You know, you can be
[1:30:04] obedient under the law.
[1:30:07] So, you have to do this.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I do that to my kids. I give
[1:30:11] them they make me reason. They make I'm
[1:30:12] stuck. So, I say no. Okay. You just have
[1:30:15] to do this. I don't have any reason.
[1:30:18] They're still young. I can do that. You
[1:30:21] just have to do it because I'm stuck as
[1:30:23] a parent. Now I'm confessing to them.
[1:30:27] But I just make them do and they do
[1:30:30] obediently. They do because I have
[1:30:32] fingers punishment blah blah blah and
[1:30:35] they just slowly they do. They're
[1:30:38] obedient.
[1:30:40] But can I really trust them for adoption
[1:30:43] with that attitude? No.
[1:30:46] But one day
[1:30:48] they will start doing it from their
[1:30:50] heart.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; It becomes a revelation to them. They
[1:30:54] have the mind of of their daddy. They
[1:30:56] know what our daddy thinks. Whether that
[1:30:59] explain it well or not well, they still
[1:31:01] catches it. Now they start doing it
[1:31:04] themsel. It becomes obedience. Still
[1:31:07] obedience. The same result. Still doing
[1:31:08] the same thing. But I rather to see them
[1:31:12] doing it when it's the love of God. When
[1:31:15] it's a revelation, when it's something
[1:31:17] real to them, that's where God wants us
[1:31:20] to come to the place where it becomes
[1:31:23] real to us.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Love of God real to us. If we are not
[1:31:29] there yet, it's still the law. And the
[1:31:32] law does not bring perfection. What
[1:31:35] brings perfection is the love of God
[1:31:37] inside of our heart. God, give me more
[1:31:40] of your love, Lord, that I'll do things.
[1:31:42] I'LL STILL BE OBEDIENT, BUT THE
[1:31:44] obedience through the love of God.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; That the relationship God wanted as
[1:31:57] Israel same earlier, but that the
[1:31:59] relationship God had with Abraham, grace
[1:32:02] was there before the law. God loved
[1:32:05] Abraham. God loved David
[1:32:09] under grace.
[1:32:11] Amen. David made a mistake. Yes. But
[1:32:15] grace was still upon him.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Election was still upon him.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Love of God was still upon him. David,
[1:32:22] my beloved, love of God was still upon
[1:32:25] him. This age, we want the love of God
[1:32:28] to remain upon us.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ did not rebuke I'm
[1:32:32] moving on a little bit. The Lord Jesus
[1:32:34] Christ did not rebuke the Ephesian age
[1:32:36] for the lack of faith in Ephesus.
[1:32:39] He rebuked them because they rejected
[1:32:42] the first love.
[1:32:44] I'll read some of the quotes here.
[1:32:46] Prophet says Ephesus means the very name
[1:32:49] Ephesus means let go, relax, backsliden,
[1:32:52] called by God, the backsliden church.
[1:32:54] God God acknowledged first their works,
[1:32:57] their labor and their patience. God
[1:32:59] rebuked their living leaving living the
[1:33:03] first love for backslading
[1:33:06] for no longer bearing light. Ephesus was
[1:33:09] not a deceived church. It was not a
[1:33:11] deceived church. It failed itself by not
[1:33:14] continuing in perfect love.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Says summary of fruits without love led
[1:33:22] to apostasy. The pro the promises
[1:33:24] paradise promised to the overcomer of
[1:33:26] the saints of Ephes in the church age
[1:33:28] given to the tree of life. Excuse me.
[1:33:32] Again brother I heard him saying that
[1:33:35] one time. says, "If they had continued
[1:33:38] in that perfect love, the rapture would
[1:33:41] have happened."
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; If the Ephesus church had continued in
[1:33:46] that perfect love, the rapture would
[1:33:48] have happened because they had the
[1:33:50] perfect faith. They had they had the
[1:33:52] word of God. They had Paul had the word
[1:33:55] of God. The messenger of that age, Paul
[1:33:57] went into the third heaven.
[1:34:00] The second Corinthians 12:24 says he
[1:34:04] went to the third he was caught up in
[1:34:05] the third heaven. Brother Bam went to
[1:34:08] the first heaven. Can you imagine Paul
[1:34:10] went to the third heaven and he went
[1:34:13] there says I knew such a man whether the
[1:34:15] body out of the body I cannot tell God
[1:34:17] knoweth but he's talking about himself.
[1:34:19] says how he was caught up in that
[1:34:21] paradise and heard unspeakable words
[1:34:25] probably heard this is me now probably
[1:34:27] heard the thunders over there but he
[1:34:30] can't speak it
[1:34:32] got the revelation but he can't speak it
[1:34:34] says I heard unspeakable words which is
[1:34:36] not lawful for a man to utter it was not
[1:34:39] the time yet as John saw that revelation
[1:34:42] he heard the thunders he heard the seals
[1:34:44] but he could not he he could not he was
[1:34:48] no you cannot Don't do it now. There
[1:34:50] will come a time where you have to
[1:34:51] manifest it. Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; So they were there. They were in that
[1:34:54] perfect love but they went away from
[1:34:57] that perfect love. Amen.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Now God is bringing us back to that
[1:35:03] perfect love. Says now this church has
[1:35:06] to come back to the perfect love of God.
[1:35:08] Amen. They say rejecting king. Rejecting
[1:35:12] king. Listen what the prophet says.
[1:35:15] The prophets had also the same
[1:35:17] experience as Paul. No, first let me
[1:35:19] read Abraham. Yeah, but I say it was a
[1:35:22] little translation. I went to the first
[1:35:24] heaven. If they it's that way in the
[1:35:26] first heaven, what did Paul see when he
[1:35:29] went to the third to the third? My no
[1:35:32] wonder he said I have not seen and ear
[1:35:35] have not heard. If that's that glorious
[1:35:38] in this in this heaven here, when you go
[1:35:41] into the third heaven, what must that
[1:35:44] brother have seen? The prophet say what
[1:35:46] they must have seen when he went to the
[1:35:48] third heaven. When he went to the third
[1:35:50] heaven and he came down he recommended
[1:35:53] perfect love.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; He did not recommend all we've so many
[1:35:57] other things. First Corinthians all good
[1:35:59] things all great good things. I can if I
[1:36:03] speak with tongues of men of angels and
[1:36:05] if if if I if I have the gift of
[1:36:08] prophecy if the if I know the mysteries
[1:36:11] if I know all the knowledge all the he
[1:36:14] once he went there and he calmed down
[1:36:16] said no there is something different all
[1:36:18] the mysteries that we have all the word
[1:36:21] of God that we have it has to be
[1:36:23] summarized into one thing when brother
[1:36:27] went to heaven and came down he did not
[1:36:29] say you have to understand and explain
[1:36:32] Then why everything mathematically
[1:36:34] everything I NO, HE JUST FOCUSED ON ONE
[1:36:37] THING. ZERO IN ON ONE THING.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; You must have perfect love.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST HAVE PERFECT LOVE. I'm more
[1:36:46] than convinced. And himself he say he
[1:36:49] says this is what you preach was the
[1:36:51] Holy Ghost. IT IS PERFECT LOVE. Nothing
[1:36:54] can enter here without that perfect
[1:36:56] love.
[1:36:58] I am more determined than ever in my
[1:37:00] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:37:03] there.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; SO WHY AM I COMING TO CHURCH LORD FOR
[1:37:07] PERFECT LOVE?
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; WHY AM I LISTENING TO THE TAPES GOD FOR
[1:37:10] PERFECT LOVE?
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; WHY WHY AM I PRAYING FOR FOR PERFECT
[1:37:14] LOVE?
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; ALL OUR FOCUS IS UPON PERFECT LOVE.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; LORD GIVE ME THAT PERFECT LOVE. AMEN.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Have I exalted the perfect love
[1:37:26] for more a little bit this morning to
[1:37:28] the point gives you ask the desire Lord
[1:37:30] give me that perfect love not a theory
[1:37:33] only
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; not only something that is a myth not
[1:37:36] something no god I WANT THE REALITY OF
[1:37:39] THE PERFECT LOVE IN MY HEART BECAUSE IF
[1:37:42] PERFECT LOVE IS IN MY HEART NOTHING CAN
[1:37:44] hurt me and I can't hurt anybody
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; IF PERFECT LOVE IS HERE IN MY HEART IF
[1:37:50] THAT OPPOSOME BECAUSE OF THE LOVE THAT
[1:37:53] OPPOSOME HAD THERE WAS HEALING for the
[1:37:55] children. LET ME TELL YOU IF YOU HAVE
[1:37:57] THAT LOVE IN YOUR HEART, IT WILL BRING
[1:38:00] HEALING FOR YOUR FAMILY. IT WILL BRING
[1:38:02] HEALING IN YOUR BODY. IT WILL BE HEALING
[1:38:05] IN A CHURCH. IT WILL BRING it will GIVE
[1:38:08] THE SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM. IMPERFECT
[1:38:11] LOVE IS INCLUDED EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE
[1:38:13] NEED OF. WHY? BECAUSE PERFECT LOVE IS
[1:38:16] GOD HIMSELF.
[1:38:18] I WOULD RATHER HAVE A CHURCH THAT IS
[1:38:20] FILLED WITH PERFECT LOVE THAN ANY OTHER
[1:38:22] GIFT BECAUSE PERFECT LOVE IS THE GIVER.
[1:38:26] IF YOU HAVE PERFECT LOVE, REAL GIFT WILL
[1:38:28] COME IN THE RIGHT WAY. AMEN.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT WITHOUT WITHOUT COMPARISON,
[1:38:35] WITHOUT ANYTHING, WITHOUT PROVING THAT
[1:38:37] YOU ARE MORE THAN ANYTHING. NO, JUST THE
[1:38:39] LOVE OF GOD.
[1:38:47] LET'S GIVE A HAND TO THE LORD.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Let me just read a little bit what is
[1:39:00] doing. I looked around and I thought,
[1:39:01] what is this? I looked really good. I
[1:39:05] can't understand it. But hope seemed to
[1:39:09] be like a guest of honor. She was no
[1:39:12] different but just like a guest of
[1:39:14] honor. And I heard a voice that that
[1:39:17] spoke to me that was in the room and
[1:39:19] said, "This is what you preached was the
[1:39:22] Holy Ghost.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; This is perfect love."
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; In the age we are living, the Holy Ghost
[1:39:32] is perfect love.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost doesn't stop
[1:39:37] Although although I just put clarity
[1:39:40] brother preached the statue of perfect
[1:39:42] man before the seals were revealed. So
[1:39:44] if you read in this you don't be
[1:39:46] confused. Sometimes he's putting says uh
[1:39:49] uh uh before faith there says the new
[1:39:52] birth as you are growing and it says the
[1:39:54] holy ghost comes and it looks like he's
[1:39:58] differentiating it might look like it's
[1:40:00] differentiating the new birth and the
[1:40:02] holy ghost but the same thing. So your
[1:40:06] new birth is the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:08] Ghost.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; But as you are growing, you are growing,
[1:40:11] you are growing, you are growing. Now
[1:40:14] the capstone comes, you know the
[1:40:16] capstone is a pyramid by itself.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; So it has all the virtue in that
[1:40:21] capstone already.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Brother said that that capstone is
[1:40:24] actually the one that gives strength to
[1:40:26] all the other virtues.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the the super virtue.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD IN THE BRIGHT AGE we have the
[1:40:33] super virtue. It's God himself. It
[1:40:36] himself coming down coming to cup the
[1:40:39] church. AMEN. WITH THE WORD OF GOD, IT
[1:40:41] COMES TO COME. HE SAYS IS THE Holy
[1:40:43] Spirit. But what is that Holy Spirit is
[1:40:46] the love of God. It means the same new
[1:40:49] birth as you are growing. You come to
[1:40:51] the level where he comes himself and
[1:40:55] caps you with the adoption of the
[1:40:57] perfect love upon you.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; They all work together.
[1:41:05] But how is it possible? Only in this
[1:41:08] age.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. And not nothing
[1:41:14] can enter here without it. I am more
[1:41:16] determined than ever in my life. It
[1:41:18] takes perfect love to enter there. God
[1:41:21] is not the God of just hazard and
[1:41:23] everything.
[1:41:25] The first vision that he had of the
[1:41:27] translation,
[1:41:28] he related it in the rejecting king
[1:41:31] which is in the same series of adoption.
[1:41:35] But brother Bam, you're talking about
[1:41:37] adoption.
[1:41:39] Why are you talking about love? Yes.
[1:41:42] Because adoption is love.
[1:41:46] God can't adopt someone who doesn't have
[1:41:48] perfect love
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; because you do things by by yourself.
[1:41:53] You just it just go wrong. I explained
[1:41:56] it earlier. You just go wrong because
[1:41:58] you do things but but when you do things
[1:42:00] because you just love God, then God
[1:42:02] adopts you. So I say it takes perfect
[1:42:05] love in adoption.
[1:42:08] Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I'm just reading it again. Says there
[1:42:12] was no jealousy. There was no tiredness.
[1:42:15] There was no death. Sickness could never
[1:42:19] never in there. Mortality could never
[1:42:21] make you old. They could not cry. It was
[1:42:25] just one joy. Oh my precious brother.
[1:42:28] They took they took me up and set me up
[1:42:30] on a big high place and I thought I'm
[1:42:32] not dreaming. I'm looking back and my
[1:42:34] body lay down on there in the bed. So
[1:42:37] heaven is not too far. It's just few
[1:42:39] meters. It's just another dimensions in
[1:42:42] denomination. You think heaven you have
[1:42:44] to go and you know the astronaut went to
[1:42:46] the other side said we didn't see God.
[1:42:48] Oh you went too far. He's right here.
[1:42:50] He's even here. Amen.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Heaven is now in the
[1:42:55] heart of the believer
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; now because the capstone has come down.
[1:42:59] God himself has come down.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; That's the time you are living in.
[1:43:03] Praise be to God. I like that one of my
[1:43:05] favorite quote. What was the Holy Ghost
[1:43:07] given for? What is the Holy Ghost God in
[1:43:09] you? What is it for? to continue his
[1:43:12] work among his people, to bring his
[1:43:14] church together, to bring the church to
[1:43:17] a place in this day. Now listen, to
[1:43:20] bring the the same Holy Spirit, but in
[1:43:22] this day, it goes far beyond the
[1:43:25] Lutarian.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The justification we believe is
[1:43:30] way beyond the justification of Luther.
[1:43:33] Actually, brother Bam is giving better
[1:43:34] explanation than Luther because the
[1:43:36] capstone is one that gives strength to
[1:43:39] the other virtues. He come and shows of
[1:43:41] what the justification is not only you
[1:43:44] are forgiven. It's more than that as if
[1:43:46] you have never done it to begin with.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost goes FAR BEYOND THE
[1:43:50] LUTHERAN, FAR BEYOND the Methodist. Far
[1:43:53] beyond the Methodist sanctification you
[1:43:55] can try on your own. And we thank God
[1:43:58] you need to try. You need to do. You
[1:44:00] need to separate. But there is a time
[1:44:01] where it comes from the inside. It's
[1:44:04] cleaning YOU. IT WASHING YOU. THE
[1:44:07] BLEEDING WORD IS WASHING YOU.
[1:44:09] HALLELUJAH. THAT'S THE SANCTIFICATION I
[1:44:11] WANT. LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAN DO THAT? THE CAPSTONE AGAIN.
[1:44:15] THE LOVE OF GOD. IT WILL WASH YOU. IT
[1:44:18] WILL CLEANSE YOU. I'M ENCOURAGING YOU
[1:44:20] BRIDE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. Stay in
[1:44:23] the channel.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD. STAY WITH THE
[1:44:27] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU MIGHT NOT
[1:44:30] UNDERSTAND BUT PERFECT LOVE WILL CLEANSE
[1:44:32] YOU WILL WASH YOU WILL SEPARATE YOU FROM
[1:44:35] THE THINGS OF THE WORLD WILL GIVING YOU
[1:44:37] A LIFE OF PRAYER WILL GIVE YOU THE LOVE
[1:44:40] FOR GOD AMEN YOU CAN'T CREATE THAT LOVE
[1:44:43] YOURSELF BUT THE MORE YOU STAY IN THE
[1:44:45] CHANNEL GOD WILL POUR THAT LOVE amen
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; because you already started here he will
[1:44:51] walk with you along the way
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; and this is the age where is pouring it
[1:44:55] the fullness of himself
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; far beyond the Lorian, the Methodist,
[1:45:00] the Pentecostal. The Pentecostal are the
[1:45:03] real gift of the Holy Ghost. They speak
[1:45:05] in tong. But thank God for the capstone.
[1:45:07] He put things in order. You do this at
[1:45:10] this time, not when the preacher is
[1:45:11] preaching.
[1:45:13] BUT THAT COME DIRECTLY FROM GOD.
[1:45:17] He can speak anytime. So no, no, no, no,
[1:45:19] no, no. The Holy Spirit is on the pulpit
[1:45:22] there. Is not the altar of disorder.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Who can say that? Only the capstone
[1:45:28] comes to put things in order. It gives
[1:45:31] strength to every oh every of them
[1:45:34] because with in this age
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; the good things they don't have any
[1:45:39] value anymore if you don't have the
[1:45:41] capstone.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Pentecostals we're far beyond the
[1:45:49] Pentecost into a place to adoption and
[1:45:53] rapturing grace.
[1:45:56] The Holy Spirit comes to prepare us for
[1:45:59] the rapture.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; This is the bride for the rapture. Amen.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; We are the church that God fordained for
[1:46:06] the rapture.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Can I just a little bit?
[1:46:10] Give me a few minutes here more to say
[1:46:13] about.
[1:46:15] So the first age they had perfect faith
[1:46:17] which is sister to perfect love. The
[1:46:20] perfect love. Perfect faith. Bam says
[1:46:22] they work together.
[1:46:24] So God rebuked them in Revelation 2:45
[1:46:27] said, "Nevertheless, I have some heart
[1:46:29] against thee, because thou hast left thy
[1:46:32] first love. Remember therefore from
[1:46:34] whence the heart fallen and repent and
[1:46:36] do the first works, else I will come
[1:46:39] unto thee quickly, and remove the
[1:46:41] candlestick of this place, except I
[1:46:43] repent." Prophet says the first love,
[1:46:47] the fervent desire to please God, the
[1:46:49] passion to know his word, the cry for
[1:46:52] reaching out in the spirit all begins to
[1:46:55] fade and instead of that church being on
[1:46:58] fire if the fire of God has cooled off
[1:47:00] and become a bit formal.
[1:47:04] I don't want that
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; and I know you don't want that.
[1:47:11] This is what was happening back there in
[1:47:13] the E in the Ephesians. Like I said,
[1:47:15] they were not deceived. They just cooled
[1:47:17] off.
[1:47:19] They're still Christians that still
[1:47:22] but they just cooled off. Just be a
[1:47:25] little bit lukewarm a little bit. You
[1:47:28] know what?
[1:47:31] You know, God understands a little bit.
[1:47:33] Just a little bit. God, I don't want to
[1:47:35] be there,
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; but let me boil with love.
[1:47:39] like gosh now is in love.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Everything is blue. Everything is is
[1:47:45] rose
[1:47:48] roses.
[1:47:49] Lord, help me to become that place. I'm
[1:47:52] just so in love with you. Don't let me
[1:47:54] become lukewarm. Become like I'm just a
[1:47:57] Christian. I just, you know what? No.
[1:48:00] Lord, help me to be in love. Help me to
[1:48:02] be in love with you.
[1:48:05] to to love you with all my heart, Lord.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Stir my love a little bit, Lord. That's
[1:48:11] my prayer. Stir my love a little bit.
[1:48:14] When when I've become cold, stir me a
[1:48:16] little bit, Lord, to love you more.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; To love you more, Father.
[1:48:21] So, they became a bit former.
[1:48:24] That is what was happening back there in
[1:48:26] Ephes. They became they they were
[1:48:28] getting a bit formal. The abandonment to
[1:48:30] God was dying out. And the people
[1:48:33] weren't too careful about what God
[1:48:35] thought of them as they began to be
[1:48:37] careful about what the world thought of
[1:48:40] them. The second generation coming on
[1:48:42] was just like Israel. They demand the
[1:48:44] king as it goes on says um it isn't long
[1:48:48] until you see them stop doing things
[1:48:50] they used to do and start doing things
[1:48:52] they couldn't they wouldn't do
[1:48:54] initially. They change their manner of
[1:48:56] dress, their attitude and their
[1:48:59] behavior. They get laxed. This is what
[1:49:01] Ephesus means. relaxed drifting that's
[1:49:04] the danger they had everything
[1:49:07] everything like in our age
[1:49:10] but they start become former they start
[1:49:14] they start looking at the world not
[1:49:16] deceive but looking at the world a few
[1:49:18] moments ago I mentioned that John
[1:49:20] understood what it was to love God that
[1:49:22] great apostle of love will certainly see
[1:49:24] it when the church began to lose that
[1:49:26] first love of God in 1 John 5:3 said for
[1:49:30] this is the love of God that we keep his
[1:49:32] commandment, his word. One little
[1:49:34] deviation from that word was a step away
[1:49:36] from God. People say they love God. They
[1:49:39] go to church. They even shout and
[1:49:41] rejoice and sing and have a great
[1:49:42] emotional time. When when it's all over,
[1:49:46] watch and see if they are in the in that
[1:49:48] word, walking in that word or living in
[1:49:51] that word. If they go through all the
[1:49:54] others and and then don't walk in that
[1:49:56] word, they can say they love God, but
[1:49:59] their lives will tell story.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; I wonder if John didn't see a lot of
[1:50:06] that before he died. People saying they
[1:50:08] loved God, but not obeying his word.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; But thank God for the bride of the air.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; When sometimes you become lukewarm,
[1:50:16] thank God he sent someone behind the
[1:50:18] purpose says, "Wake up. Wake up. Wake
[1:50:21] up. You are the bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:23] Christ. Don't be distracted. AMEN. YOU
[1:50:26] ARE THE BELOVED ONE. WAKE UP. LOVE HIM
[1:50:28] MORE. EXPRESS YOUR LOVELY.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES HE COMES AND he preaches it.
[1:50:32] Sometimes if there's a song or there
[1:50:34] atmosphere, it just makes you a LITTLE
[1:50:36] BIT. OH, THANK GOD FOR THAT. THANK YOU
[1:50:38] FOR REVIVING THAT LOVE A LITTLE BIT,
[1:50:40] LORD.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. LIKE IN THE NATURAL,
[1:50:44] you know, sometimes it's good to revive
[1:50:46] a little bit the married couple.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. a little bit surprises and oh
[1:50:51] hey sweet don't make it monotones and
[1:50:56] formal and traditional
[1:51:01] sisters also sometimes little bit the
[1:51:02] brother comes from work you sharp very
[1:51:05] well clean don't just be like is it
[1:51:09] better again
[1:51:12] make the
[1:51:18] same thing spiritually as well.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God. One day, look, thank God
[1:51:23] for and he does that very often.
[1:51:25] Sometimes he send the visitors here and
[1:51:27] the visitor preaches so well WITH HIS SO
[1:51:29] THANK GOD. THANK GOD OR HE GIVES A FRESH
[1:51:31] REVELATION to to my to to my brother or
[1:51:34] to me or to whoever will and oh thank
[1:51:36] God
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want us to stay
[1:51:39] lukewarm. Thank God for his grace.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Now I will finish with this. the church
[1:51:48] choosing law for grace. And if if you
[1:51:50] can do one thing to save yourself, then
[1:51:52] there is no one spec of it. Grace, law
[1:51:56] is what you do in regard to the grace
[1:51:58] that God has shown you by by saving you.
[1:52:01] As I've often said, I don't run around
[1:52:03] with other women because I'm afraid my
[1:52:05] wife will divorce me. I don't run around
[1:52:07] with the other women because I don't run
[1:52:10] around with with the other women because
[1:52:12] I love my wife. That's it. I don't
[1:52:15] believe that you should run around, but
[1:52:17] a law isn't what keeps it my marriage
[1:52:20] vow. It's my love. It's the reason I
[1:52:23] love God. Not because I'm afraid he send
[1:52:25] me to hell. I don't believe he'll do
[1:52:27] that. But because I love him so much, I
[1:52:31] don't want to do it. There's nothing in
[1:52:33] me to make me do it. I love him so much.
[1:52:38] I love him too much. And I want that
[1:52:41] expression we have to be my expression
[1:52:44] to be your expression. I love God too
[1:52:46] much. You want me to do this? No, I
[1:52:49] can't do I I just love him so much.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Love him. That that's why he put the
[1:52:55] first commandment. Love the God I the
[1:52:58] Lord thy God. Because he knew that if
[1:53:00] you love him, all the other commandments
[1:53:03] are not even commandments anymore.
[1:53:05] THEY'RE JUST PART THEY'RE SWALLOWED UP
[1:53:07] INTO THAT first commandment BECAUSE YOU
[1:53:10] LOVE GOD. YOU CAN'T HURT YOUR BROTHER.
[1:53:13] YOU CAN'T HURT YOUR SISTER. EVERYTHING
[1:53:15] IS INCLUDED IN THAT LOVE OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:53:18] GOD, I love you. Anybody saying I love
[1:53:21] my brother and MY SISTER WITH AGAPA LOVE
[1:53:24] unconditional
[1:53:26] what you do to me I still whatever you
[1:53:29] do to me you know today is that you
[1:53:30] invite me at your house then I will
[1:53:32] invite you. No. Whether you invite me,
[1:53:34] you don't invite me, I still love you.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I'll still invite you.
[1:53:40] Amen.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the level of unconditional.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; I just do things because I love God. Not
[1:53:47] because of this, not because I'm waiting
[1:53:48] for this. Not Lord, remove that from me.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Let me just read the whole quot the
[1:53:58] whole I wouldn't hurt him for nothing.
[1:54:01] Certainly, I love him. When men and
[1:54:03] women get to a place, well, I really
[1:54:05] ought to to stay at home and see this
[1:54:08] good play tonight, but I tell you,
[1:54:10] they'll think I'm back. If I don't go on
[1:54:13] down at church, says you sat there and
[1:54:16] sleep anyhow. You might as well have
[1:54:18] stayed home and looked at something you
[1:54:21] would enjoy more.
[1:54:25] I didn't know that it was there, but
[1:54:26] it's good. When your joy becomes the
[1:54:29] Lord and the Lord is your joy,
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; you can't stay away from church,
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; then you are getting somewhere.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; The church was in a better shape 40
[1:54:40] years ago for the coming of the Lord
[1:54:41] than it is tonight. Way better. They
[1:54:44] were closer to God. They were more they
[1:54:46] were they had more God among them. They
[1:54:48] more they had more spirit among them
[1:54:50] than they got tonight. I say, "Oh, what
[1:54:53] a rebuke." I'll say, "That's a rebuke."
[1:54:54] But we don't want to be there. We want
[1:54:56] we want to be more in love with God
[1:54:59] because he has given us a a promise.
[1:55:01] Amen. That the promise of per of
[1:55:03] perfection. He said Jeremiah 31:33 said,
[1:55:06] "Behold, the days come, say the Lord,
[1:55:07] that I will put my new covenant with the
[1:55:10] house of Israel and with the house of
[1:55:12] Judah, not according to the covenant
[1:55:14] that I made with their fathers in the
[1:55:15] day that I took them by the hand to
[1:55:17] bring them out of the land of Egypt,
[1:55:19] which my covenant they break, although I
[1:55:21] was an husband unto them, say the Lord,
[1:55:25] husband unto Israel." He loved them, but
[1:55:27] they didn't love him back. But this
[1:55:29] shall be the covenant that I will make
[1:55:31] with the house of Israel, spiritual
[1:55:33] Israel. After those days, means in our
[1:55:36] days,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; say the Lord. I will put my law in the
[1:55:39] inward part
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; and I will write it in their heart
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; and I will be their God and they shall
[1:55:46] be MY PEOPLE.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR PUTTING THE WORD OF GOD IN
[1:55:50] OUR HEART.
[1:55:51] THANK GOD FOR MALACHI 4 CHANGING OUR
[1:55:54] HEART TO BE able to RECEIVE THE WORD OF
[1:55:58] GOD. NOW IT'S NOT SOMEONE PUSHING YOU.
[1:56:01] SOMEONE SAY YOU HAVE to do this, YOU
[1:56:03] HAVE TO. PAUL WILL TAKE THAT ANOTHER
[1:56:05] PLACE SAYS that scripture said no one
[1:56:07] can teach another person. It's not
[1:56:09] SOMEONE TO COME YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. YOU
[1:56:12] YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. NO. NO. IT IS NOT
[1:56:16] it's me to DO IT. THANK GOD FOR THIS.
[1:56:19] YOU you teach me and I'll do it. That
[1:56:22] actually the message what it is.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; You teach me, I do it.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; If I don't do it, it's because I don't
[1:56:29] know it. But once I know it, I DO IT
[1:56:32] BECAUSE I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. You put that
[1:56:35] into my heart. You wrote your word of
[1:56:36] God into my heart. I want it to leave
[1:56:39] the tapes. I want it to leave the Bible.
[1:56:41] The letter killers, BUT THE SPIRIT GIVES
[1:56:44] LIFE. I WANT YOU TO COME FROM those
[1:56:46] place to come now into my heart. Lord
[1:56:49] Lord give me your your love. That's my
[1:56:51] desire. Is that your desire?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Church of God, is that your
[1:56:55] desire?
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Is we are more than determined that it
[1:56:59] requires perfect love to get anything.
[1:57:02] And this church has and will have
[1:57:05] perfect love.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Let's give the hand to the Lord Jesus
[1:57:08] Christ.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you Lord. We thank you,
[1:57:12] Father.

[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I sing out a love song love song to
[1:57:58] Jesus.

[2:09:14] when I was
[2:09:16] so lonely.

[2:11:30] For without you, oh for without
[2:11:35] you I
[2:11:37] could never
[2:11:46] make
[2:11:48] my home.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Verse one.
[2:11:52] Lord, you found me
[2:11:56] when I was so lonely.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; You found me when I was so blue.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; You found me

[2:12:47] Don't ever
[2:12:50] leave me
[2:12:52] alone.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; For without
[2:13:00] you I
[2:13:03] could never
[2:13:11] make heaven
[2:13:13] my home. I've been on the mountain with
[2:13:17] Jesus.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; I've been on the mountain with Jesus.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Also been in the valley.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; I've been in the valley.
[2:13:35] So,
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; but never one time.
[2:13:40] But never
[2:13:42] one time has he me.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Him with his love will never fail.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; I'll go.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Because his love will never forsake me.
[2:14:00] Oh, let
[2:14:03] me walk with you, Jesus.

[2:14:40] Let's bow our hands one more time as the
[2:14:43] music is playing softly.
[2:14:46] I believe this morning for your desire
[2:14:48] to walk closer with him.
[2:14:51] Father, Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for
[2:14:54] opening that window that we can see the
[2:14:56] love of God towards us. Father, that's
[2:14:59] why Lord, for us as Jacob, it's not a
[2:15:02] duty, but but we love you. We desire,
[2:15:06] Father, to do more for you. because we
[2:15:08] love you.
[2:15:10] The message statue of the perfect man
[2:15:13] almost the la towards the last paragraph
[2:15:15] the prophet says I pledge this morning
[2:15:18] to him with all my heart that by his
[2:15:21] help and by his grace I pray that I'll
[2:15:24] seek daily without ceasing until I feel
[2:15:28] every one of these requirements
[2:15:31] flowing in this little old statue of
[2:15:34] mine till I can be a manifestation of
[2:15:37] the living Christ for He became sin like
[2:15:41] me that I might become become
[2:15:43] righteousness of God like him. He took
[2:15:46] my place. Lord, let me take his now
[2:15:50] because that's the purpose he died for.
[2:15:54] How many will pledge that same thing by
[2:15:56] the grace of God.
[2:15:58] Lord, I pledge allegiance unto you. One
[2:16:02] more time, brother. Pledge allegiance.
[2:16:07] I have heard
[2:16:09] how Christian
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; were brought
[2:16:17] before
[2:16:18] a tyrant
[2:16:21] throne. They were told that he would
[2:16:26] spare their lives if they would
[2:16:32] renounce
[2:16:33] the name of Christ.
[2:16:37] But one by one they chose to die.
[2:16:44] The son of God they would not deny.
[2:16:51] Like a great
[2:16:53] angelic
[2:16:55] choir
[2:16:57] se
[2:16:59] I can almost hear their voicees
[2:17:04] ring. Oh, I pledge
[2:17:08] alce

[2:19:15] The things that will come against us,
[2:19:16] Lord.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; But we'll fear not, Lord.
