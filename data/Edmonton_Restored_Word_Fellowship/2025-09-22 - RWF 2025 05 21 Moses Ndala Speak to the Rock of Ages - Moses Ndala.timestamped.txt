[9:08] No matter what we think is happening in
[9:09] the world, no matter how we feel, God's
[9:13] words is his work. So fulfilled
[9:17] in a way we may not think of
[9:21] [Music]
[9:29] 278. This world is not my home.
[9:34] [Music]
[9:39] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[9:43] passing through. My treasures are laid
[9:47] off somewhere beyond the blue. The
[9:52] angels beckon me from heaven's open
[9:57] door. And I can't be led home in this
[10:01] world anymore.
[10:04] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[10:09] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[10:14] what will I do?
[10:16] Angels back at me from heaven's open
[10:21] door. And I can't heal at home in this
[10:25] world anymore.
[10:28] They're all expecting me.
[10:31] That's one thing I know. I fixed it up
[10:35] with Jesus
[10:37] many years ago.
[10:40] I know he'll see me through. Though I am
[10:44] weak and bold and I can't feel at home
[10:48] in this world anymore.
[10:52] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[10:56] you.
[10:58] Heaven's not my home. And Lord, what
[11:02] will I do? The angels beckoning me from
[11:07] heaven's open door. And I can't feel at
[11:11] home in this world anymore.
[11:16] Just over a glory land. We'll live
[11:20] eternally.
[11:22] The saints on every hand are shouting
[11:26] victory.
[11:27] The songs of sweetest praise drift back
[11:31] from heaven's door. And I can't feel at
[11:35] home in this world anymore.
[11:39] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[11:44] you.
[11:46] Not my hope. Then Lord, what will I do?
[11:51] The angels back at me from heaven's open
[11:55] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[12:00] world anymore.
[12:02] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[12:07] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[12:12] what will I do? The angels back in me
[12:17] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[12:21] feel at home in this world anymore.

[16:41] Once my heart and soul were fed

[16:51] chains of sin.
[16:55] But the great emancipator
[17:01] set me free to worship him.
[17:08] Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[17:14] Blessed be his holy name.
[17:20] He's the great emancipator.
[17:26] That's the song of the redee.
[17:32] Like a lost lamp, I was drifting.
[17:38] Oh, so helpless and alone.
[17:44] But the seeking shepherd found me,
[17:50] led me to my father's home.
[17:56] Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[18:02] Blessed be his holy name.
[18:08] He's the great emancipator.
[18:14] That's the song of the redeemed.
[18:20] Once my heart and soul were fed
[18:26] by the binding chains of sin.
[18:32] But the great emancipator
[18:38] set me free to worship him.
[18:44] Glory, glory, hallelu.
[18:49] Blessed be his holy name.
[18:55] He's the great emancipator.
[19:01] That's the song of the redeemed.
[19:07] Like a lost lamb, I was drifting.

[19:18] But the seeking shepherd found me.
[19:24] led me to my father's throne.
[19:30] Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[19:36] Blessed be his holy day.
[19:41] He's the great emancipator.
[19:47] That's the song of the redee.
[19:58] If you were a lost lamb, you were
[20:00] probably dirty and unsure.
[20:03] He washed you by the water. Singed
[20:07] by the water.
[20:08] [Music]
[20:16] Do you know what it is not to have one
[20:21] guilty feeling or to wonder where you're
[20:25] going when you die.
[20:29] Not condemned of the past. Not afraid of
[20:33] what tomorrow holds in store and know
[20:37] the reason why.
[20:40] Yes, that's just how it is. When you go
[20:44] down in the water for by faith, you
[20:48] believe in what you heard.
[20:52] It's no impossible dream. You can start
[20:56] over clean.

[21:05] Are you washed
[21:08] by the water?

[21:16] Are you washed
[21:19] by the water?

[21:27] It's like being born again with a whole
[21:31] new life to live. never having to look
[21:35] back to what you did.
[21:39] Cuz according to the Lord, you've just
[21:42] started your existence. And where he's
[21:45] concerned, there never was no sin.
[21:50] For when God looks your way, he no
[21:54] longer sees a sinner, but a saint who's
[21:57] been washed white as snow.
[22:01] It's not by anything we've done, but by
[22:04] the blood of God's own son.
[22:08] Are you washed by the water of the word?
[22:14] Are you washed
[22:17] by the water?
[22:20] Washed by the water of the word.

[31:40] from you, Father, will make a
[31:42] difference. Amen. As brother Andrew said
[31:45] it, Father, this world is not our home.
[31:48] It's not our place. But we have so
[31:51] privileged to have the word of God to
[31:53] realize that we are part of the grace of
[31:55] God that we have been saved. That great
[31:57] shepherd looked and sought us and found
[32:00] us. He washed us with the word of God.
[32:03] Cleanse us, Father, so that we can be a
[32:06] vessel that you can use for your glory,
[32:08] Father. Lord, we are here to surrender
[32:10] oursel to you. You know our needs. You
[32:12] know the needs of our families and our
[32:15] friends and our loved ones. Father, we
[32:17] just want to commit oursel to you and
[32:19] just look into your word and father
[32:21] speak one thing that will increase our
[32:23] faith just to be able to talk to you,
[32:26] Father, in in in with faith and
[32:28] believing your word. Father, bless your
[32:30] people this evening as we commit oursel
[32:32] to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[32:35] Amen. Amen.
[32:37] I would invite you to go to the word of
[32:39] God in Exodus
[32:45] 17. I just want to share small thought.
[32:48] Um,
[32:56] Exodus 17
[33:00] verse 5-7.
[33:04] And the Lord said unto Moses, Exodus 17,
[33:08] the Lord said, The Lord said unto Moses,
[33:11] "Go on before the people, and take with
[33:14] thee of the elders of Israel, and thy
[33:17] road, wherewith thou smote of the river,
[33:21] take in thine hand, and go.
[33:24] Behold, I will stand before thee there
[33:27] upon the rock in Horeb, and I shall
[33:30] smite the rock, and there shall come
[33:33] water out of it, that the people may
[33:36] drink. And Moses did so in the sight of
[33:39] the elders of Israel. And he called the
[33:42] name of the place Masa and Meibba
[33:46] because of the children of the because
[33:49] of the shiding of the children of Israel
[33:52] and because they tempted the Lord saying
[33:55] is the Lord among us or not. Amen. God
[33:59] bless his word and you can have a seat.
[34:07] My thought I took it from the message
[34:09] brother Banam preached the everpresent
[34:11] water from the rock
[34:13] and if you take from if you see uh as
[34:16] the the scripture is saying here they
[34:18] tempted the lord saying is the lord
[34:20] among us or not it's a good question
[34:23] sometimes by depend sometimes on the on
[34:26] the on the attitude that we have behind
[34:28] it and I think I shared that one time I
[34:31] felt like repeating it once again
[34:33] sometimes The attitude we have about it
[34:36] is is really the Lord among us. So is is
[34:39] why things are not why this way? Why we
[34:41] don't see miracles? Why this and why
[34:44] this? I think it's a problem of that. I
[34:46] think it's a problem of that. And you
[34:48] take it in a spirit of complaining and
[34:50] murmuring. And that's what the Lord
[34:52] doesn't like. And sometimes you can ask,
[34:55] "Oh God, are you with me? Oh Lord, if
[34:56] you're not with me, help me because I
[34:58] can't go without you." And Lord, help
[35:00] me. I want your presence. It's
[35:03] different. I had the same questions but
[35:04] depending on how you approach it and how
[35:06] you look at it. No. So, oh why why is
[35:09] our church so small? Why shouldn't this?
[35:11] Why this? Why that song? Why this? Why
[35:14] this? And then the Lord is not happy.
[35:18] So no but but I'm writing the right
[35:20] question and sometimes criticizing the
[35:22] right you had the right the right
[35:24] questions but the spirit behind it just
[35:28] remove even the the the meaning or the
[35:30] reason why why people should look at it
[35:32] in a proper way. It's sometimes the
[35:35] motives and the objectives behind it
[35:37] that breaks the whole thing is the Lord
[35:39] among us is really why Moses look at us
[35:41] in the desert. Why we have this? If if
[35:43] it was really God's will, why the
[35:46] promised land is just few days here, but
[35:48] but why is putting us this way and going
[35:50] this way? Why we have this mana? Why we
[35:53] this man the same food all the time? The
[35:55] same food all the time. Prophet says
[35:58] actually in our modern terms times is is
[36:01] why we go to church? Why all the same
[36:03] thing? They seem we know that what there
[36:05] will be few songs at the beginning and a
[36:07] prayer and a few songs and then we then
[36:11] the preacher comes and he and he
[36:13] preaches and after that we few songs and
[36:15] we go home. Why repeating the same
[36:17] things? I can almost I know already what
[36:20] how will happen and we get used to it.
[36:23] The problem sometimes we get used to it.
[36:25] It becomes a traditions and it becomes
[36:28] just oh no I just I'm just doing it by
[36:30] yeah because I have to do it because I
[36:32] have to I I have to show my presence in
[36:35] the church and if they don't I don't do
[36:37] that then they will know that I'm not
[36:38] there you know I'm the pastor of the
[36:40] church so I have to be there you know so
[36:42] otherwise people will complain
[36:45] or maybe I'm this or you know I know you
[36:49] have to come because you love the Lord
[36:51] because you want to be in church and you
[36:53] you want to worship the Lord. It's not
[36:55] because of others and what the others
[36:57] will say, you know. Oh, sometimes when I
[36:59] just come, you know, I I'll come only
[37:01] when I have this brother or this
[37:03] preacher and everything, you know,
[37:05] because otherwise it's just the same
[37:06] thing. He speaks slowly and he mumbles
[37:09] and everything. He's really the Lord
[37:11] with him to begin with because that's
[37:14] the problem there. They are tempting me
[37:16] there. So, we are here, we are so
[37:18] thirsty and we want water. But why the
[37:21] Lord doesn't give us water? He knows
[37:22] that we need water. Why he doesn't give
[37:24] us water? Why? Why this? The Lord knows
[37:26] that there will be water. He knows that.
[37:28] He knows that they need water. He knows
[37:30] our needs. He even knows our needs. But
[37:33] how do we approach him? How do we come
[37:35] to him? How how do we even ask him?
[37:39] That's where the problem is. But doesn't
[37:41] see that I'm suffering. I've been in the
[37:42] message for so long time. I've been so
[37:44] faithful. Why am I suffering? Why this?
[37:47] Why my family? Why this? Oh no. That's
[37:50] no that's the wrong approach. So Lord,
[37:53] may your perfect will be done despite
[37:56] the the trials, despite the
[37:58] circumstances, despite despite what I
[38:00] what I see, what I don't understand, I
[38:02] know that you are working. Amen. I just
[38:04] continue to believe your word and
[38:06] trusting in you and know that you you
[38:08] are answering my my prayer at the right
[38:10] time. Help me to be patient. Help me to
[38:13] wait. Give me patience to wait. At the
[38:16] right time, at the appointed time, the
[38:17] vision shall be fulfilled. I know that
[38:20] the Lord is on my side. He knows my
[38:22] needs. He cares for me. You keep
[38:25] confessing the word of God. You keep
[38:27] claiming the word of God. I know that he
[38:29] has not forsaken me. He will not leave
[38:31] me alone. He's with me. He will not
[38:33] leave me fatherless. He knows my need
[38:35] and he's there on my side. Amen.
[38:38] Positive confession, a ragged Christian.
[38:40] Amen. Despite the circumstances, I know
[38:43] that the word is true. Amen. Heaven and
[38:46] earth will pass away, but God's word
[38:48] will never pass away. I know that the
[38:51] message is the truth. I know that I'll
[38:53] be part of the rapture. Amen. Oh, I see
[38:55] sometimes the mistakes, but I know that
[38:57] he's working in my life. The Lord is
[39:00] leading me. He's guiding me. No spirit
[39:02] of complaints, no spirit of memory, no
[39:05] spirit of comparison, no spirit of
[39:07] criticism, no spirit o of even comparing
[39:10] to others. I'm I'm special in God's
[39:13] eyes. God loves me. God is leading me.
[39:17] God is on my side. Amen. And he's the
[39:19] one who put the desire to serve him
[39:21] inside of me. It's not a man who called
[39:24] me in the message. Is God who called me.
[39:26] Amen. Amen.
[39:29] Then then you know you know Paul Paul
[39:32] and Silas could have that that attitude
[39:35] when they were in the jails. So we were
[39:37] there preaching for him and testifying
[39:39] about God. Why it happened to us? Why
[39:41] why now they were being beaten now?
[39:44] Well, why these things? Why this? But
[39:46] but didn't look at that negative side.
[39:47] Not at all. They start praising the Lord
[39:50] right there in the jail thanking the
[39:52] Lord, Lord. Oh, I bless your name. I
[39:56] bless your name. No matter what, I bless
[39:59] your name. The the the jailers were
[40:02] there and all the prisoners over there,
[40:04] but they probably did not understand.
[40:05] How come these people are still praising
[40:07] the Lord in those circumstances? And
[40:10] they're still in jails. They're still in
[40:11] the feathers. They're still in chains.
[40:13] But God was working a miracle because of
[40:16] their attitude. Amen. Sometimes our
[40:19] attitudes changed everything. Brother
[40:22] says the right mental attitude towards
[40:24] every promise of God will bring it to
[40:27] pass. Not even faith but the right
[40:30] mental attitudes. Just to start by that
[40:33] it will bring it to come to pass. Amen.
[40:35] Now if you add to that the faith the
[40:37] assurance that is going to be so, how
[40:40] much more we should expect result. Amen.
[40:42] Amen. It might take one day, it might
[40:44] take two days, might take two hours. It
[40:46] might be even at the same time there,
[40:48] but it will come to pass. Amen. That's
[40:50] right. Amen. Amen.
[40:54] So they come at that place there, they
[40:56] were complaining. They were so thirsty
[40:58] and they wanted to see water. And God
[41:01] told them, God called Moses, you know,
[41:03] they they murmuring. They they've
[41:05] tempted me by saying is the Lord is what
[41:07] now go and I will show you the miracles.
[41:09] If you go there and you take the same
[41:12] road and he say the Bible says the same
[41:14] road that you you use to smite the
[41:17] river. You mean the same road that you
[41:19] use to bring judgment upon Egypt that
[41:22] actually those people deserve to be
[41:24] punished. Those people deserve to be
[41:26] punished. Those people to be deserve to
[41:28] be smitten. But instead of smiting them,
[41:31] you are going to smite the rock. You're
[41:33] going to smite the rock and the rock is
[41:35] going to bring forth water. Amen. And
[41:38] from the from the place where you could
[41:40] never expect to find water from because
[41:43] it was a rigid and solid rock. But by
[41:46] smiting upon it, fresh water will come
[41:49] out from that rock. Amen. And as he did
[41:52] that, as he sm that rock, fresh water
[41:55] came out of it. Amen. The prophet says,
[41:58] he says in that message, he said, then
[41:59] it caused God to do something that was
[42:02] terri terrifically. It caused God to
[42:04] have Moses to take the judgment ro that
[42:07] he had judged the nation. We even smite
[42:09] the rock to bring forth war. Amen. It
[42:11] caused God to take the judgment of the
[42:14] whole world and smite his own son with
[42:17] it at Calvary that we might go free. It
[42:20] is more Jesus Christ on Calvary is the
[42:23] tree. Why? To bring us the freshness of
[42:26] the water or the fresh water of the Holy
[42:29] Ghost. Amen. Water means the Holy Ghost.
[42:32] Amen. He was written so that we can have
[42:35] the Holy Ghost and to raise the Holy
[42:37] Ghost in abundance. You know the prophet
[42:40] would take that comparison. Some people
[42:41] put that rock as a as a small sprinkle
[42:44] just giving a little water tickling
[42:46] thing and people had come with a spoon
[42:48] and take a little bit and oh this is a
[42:49] little bit of water in the wilderness.
[42:51] Prophet says that's not the image.
[42:53] That's the concept of a man but it was
[42:56] actually a stream of water flowing.
[43:00] Amen. The Holy Ghost is not a sprinkle.
[43:03] The Holy Ghost is a stream of water to
[43:06] give to the thirsty to the thirsty
[43:09] Christian whatever he has need. Are you
[43:13] thirsty this evening? Are you thirsty of
[43:16] more of God this evening? There is a
[43:18] great fountain to provide the water for
[43:22] the thirsty soul and thirsty heart this
[43:25] evening. That's right. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[43:29] He says that's the way they try to make
[43:31] Christ the Holy Spirit today. It's all
[43:33] that is just a little sprinkle. See,
[43:36] just enough to make you believe that
[43:38] there is a God. We are not Christians.
[43:40] Just enough to believe that God has sent
[43:43] a prophet. We believe that God has sent
[43:46] a prophet. But there is more than that.
[43:48] Amen. What does that prophet say? I
[43:51] believe everything that prophet says.
[43:53] There is more than just saying I'm a
[43:55] message believer. There's more than just
[43:57] saying I'm a Christian. Oh, I'm a
[44:00] Christian going to church, but I'm a
[44:02] Christian on Monday, on Tuesday, on
[44:04] Wednesday, on Thursday, on Friday, on
[44:07] Saturday, on Sunday. Every day, I'm
[44:10] drinking from the fresh water of God.
[44:13] Amen. I'm a Christian all the time. At
[44:17] home or at work, at school, wherever it
[44:20] might be, I'm a Christian. Amen.
[44:23] Drinking from the fresh water of God.
[44:25] And it's still available. That's my
[44:27] message this evening. That that war is
[44:29] still available this evening. That war
[44:32] is not a one time situation and left
[44:34] behind or one time at Calvary and that
[44:37] it or one time at the Pentecost that it
[44:39] not even one time only in time of the
[44:42] same water is available this evening.
[44:44] Amen. Whatever you have need of whether
[44:47] it is healing, whether it is a clean
[44:49] life, whether is salvation for your
[44:51] family, the same water is available this
[44:54] evening. Amen. We should not put God in
[44:56] the past. We should take God out of by
[44:59] the past and bring in the present tense
[45:01] still doing the same things, the same
[45:03] yesterday, today and forever. The same
[45:05] miracles he did in time of we should
[45:08] expect them in our lives today. Amen.
[45:10] Because the same water, the same rock is
[45:12] here. Amen. Amen.
[45:16] So now it is an abundance of water.
[45:18] David said, "My cup runth over. It's
[45:21] just a a gash of the Holy Spirit. People
[45:24] are afraid of it. Some people say,
[45:26] "Well, I'm just a little afraid. I will
[45:28] do this. I will do that." Or if if it
[45:31] happen to go little too deep. Can you
[45:34] show someone went a little too far? So,
[45:37] but you never do point to that one
[45:39] didn't go far enough. You know, you
[45:41] become a fanatic. You become like
[45:44] Don't be scared of becoming a fanatic.
[45:46] Sometimes it's actually it's better to
[45:48] become a fanatic than to become cold.
[45:51] Sometimes it's better to become a
[45:52] fanatic.
[45:54] And I'm so fanatic of God, fanatic of
[45:56] the word of God. You know, sometimes I
[45:58] see during the I see during during the
[46:01] the the the how do you call it?
[46:04] Skating or I mean the the hockey games.
[46:07] Oh, you see even a quiet brother becomes
[46:10] so so we have a game. We had a game. Oh,
[46:14] we have no and he start he start
[46:16] talking. Oh, wow. I didn't know that
[46:18] this brother can talk.
[46:20] Oh, wow. Even some sisters. Oh. Oh. Yes.
[46:25] It was it was a bad game yesterday. I
[46:27] don't know how they missed it. Oh, wow.
[46:30] Talkative sister.
[46:33] But what about the word of God? We
[46:35] should even be fanatical of the word of
[46:36] God. This is my message. This is the
[46:39] word of God. I'm on fire for God. Amen.
[46:42] I love the word of God. Oh. Oh. To be in
[46:44] the spirit for God. Amen. Get in the
[46:46] spirit of the word of God. Those are
[46:48] going to the board game and that game.
[46:50] They in the spirit for that game. man
[46:53] you you even see umbrell
[46:59] but in church.
[47:01] [Laughter]
[47:05] Oh God for the word of God. Thank you
[47:08] Lord. Thank you Lord. Praise be to God.
[47:10] I love the Lord. Thank you. Even if you
[47:13] have heard it many times you just say
[47:15] thank you Lord. Thank you for saving me.
[47:18] Every time it strikes your mind. He
[47:21] strike your heart to realize the grace
[47:23] of God in your heart. You can never say
[47:25] I I already said amen yesterday. No. God
[47:28] saved me. He took me from the merry
[47:30] clay. Now he has putting me he has put
[47:33] me on the rock. Amen. I'm a son and
[47:35] daughter of God. I didn't choose him. I
[47:38] didn't choose him. He chose me first. He
[47:41] saved me first. I am his daughter. I am
[47:44] his son.
[47:46] Oh, wonderful. Amen. Because the rock is
[47:50] here. The rock is here. The prophet says
[47:53] that rock some people has opened the
[47:56] heart and mind that all Israel drunk and
[47:58] then they packed up the camels and tied
[48:01] the the hitches and on the on the on the
[48:05] horses and so forth and took their kids
[48:07] and journeyed on onto somewhere else and
[48:10] left the rock there sprinkling. You see
[48:12] that is wrong. That rock followed them.
[48:16] That rock was with them. That rock
[48:19] followed them. Because in 1 Corinthians
[48:21] 10:4, it says they did drink did all
[48:25] drink the same spiritual drink and they
[48:27] drank of that spiritual rock that
[48:29] followed them and that rock was Christ.
[48:32] So every time that rock was following
[48:35] them was following them was behind them.
[48:37] But you know the
[48:40] think about it it's a good questions.
[48:42] What happened between when it was struck
[48:46] and when God asked Moses not to strike
[48:49] it the second time but to speak to the
[48:52] rock? What happened between those two
[48:54] times? Because it was following them.
[48:57] What happened? How come there are two
[49:00] circumstances where they have to
[49:01] complain that there is no water?
[49:05] Good question, right? The rock is
[49:07] following you and then you they come all
[49:09] but Moses we look out we are dying
[49:11] again. Second time we are dying here.
[49:13] There is no water around us. And and why
[49:15] did you bring us here Moses? We want to
[49:17] go back to Egypt. Why this? Why this?
[49:19] Why this? Why this? They even forgot
[49:22] that the rock was still following them.
[49:24] That rock was still available there. Oh,
[49:27] the prophet says that's sometimes the
[49:29] problem with the church. They are
[49:31] putting things. They love things in the
[49:34] past. They love things in the future,
[49:36] but they're forgetting what God is doing
[49:38] right now. Amen. Who is the God who gave
[49:40] you the desire to come to church this
[49:42] evening? It's God. Amen. Who's the God
[49:45] who keeps you making you still desiring
[49:48] something you keep desiring to more of
[49:50] God. Amen. It's not a man. It's God. God
[49:53] is still working in your life, brothers
[49:55] and sisters. So this evening when we go
[49:57] in prayer, you talk to God as the
[49:59] present God. Amen. God, you are here.
[50:02] The rock has not left us. The rock has
[50:05] not left the church. The power of God
[50:07] has not left the church. The power of
[50:09] God is still in the church. Yes, we have
[50:12] need, but those need will just manifest
[50:15] the power of God in a greater way. Amen.
[50:17] The problem they had was they did not
[50:21] have faith. That's right. That's right.
[50:24] They did not have faith. Amen. Amen.
[50:31] So the prophet says, I would like this
[50:34] morning, it was speaking that this
[50:35] morning, everywhere the soul of your
[50:37] feet shall throw, I've given to you.
[50:39] Wherever you that goes, the Lord of thy
[50:41] God is with thee. Don't you fear any
[50:44] man. Be cou courageous. Just whatever
[50:47] you make, wherever you make a footstep,
[50:50] I'm right there with you. No matter
[50:52] where it's at. God is going with Joshua.
[50:55] The same God that goes with his church
[50:57] this morning. Let's drink from this
[50:59] fountain yonder. Amen. As we sung the
[51:03] song, coming back to the well, coming
[51:05] back all the time to the well because
[51:07] the well is still flowing with fresh
[51:09] water. Whatever you make a footstep,
[51:12] that's where God will be right with you
[51:15] to water in and give you life. I will be
[51:18] with you always, even unto the end of
[51:21] the age. Christ the same yesterday,
[51:23] today, and forever. the laws of God. Now
[51:25] you say then brother Brham why is it
[51:28] that we do not do the things then when
[51:31] we should do how is it our gift and
[51:34] things in the church does not come to
[51:36] its color to where it should be. How is
[51:39] it our church does not lift up into the
[51:42] spot where it should be. The people in
[51:45] the testing time draws away like Israel
[51:48] did. They think that God has left them.
[51:51] God has not left us.
[51:53] Amen. God has not left us. But remember
[51:57] the rock never left Israel. Israel left
[52:01] the rock. It forgot about the rock being
[52:04] with them all the time. It was there.
[52:06] Went right with them to the end of the
[52:08] road. It followed them. It wasn't It
[52:11] wasn't out of speaking distance. That's
[52:14] why God asked Moses to speak to the
[52:16] rock. It was not too far to speak to
[52:20] that rock. God is not asking us to
[52:23] strike the rock anymore. He's not asking
[52:25] us to start a new things and or new
[52:28] revival or anything. God is asking us to
[52:31] speak to the rock to talk to the rock.
[52:34] Lord, I need this. Lord, you promised me
[52:37] this. Lord, you promise that you are
[52:39] always with me. Look at this situation.
[52:41] Look at this situation. You are still
[52:43] the master of all circumstances. You
[52:46] reign and rule. You are my God. You know
[52:49] my family. You know my situation. You
[52:52] know my health. You know my spiritual
[52:55] conditions. He's still here at the
[52:58] speaking distance. Amen. Amen. That's
[53:01] right. So it wasn't out of a hearing
[53:04] distance. It wasn't out of seeing
[53:06] distance. Neither is Christ with the
[53:08] church today is not out of speaking
[53:11] distance. Some of you have backsliden
[53:13] and done which was wrong and you have
[53:15] lost your joy and your water is dried up
[53:18] and you have not lost your salvation but
[53:20] you have lost sometimes the joy oh I
[53:23] don't feel like oh singing I don't oh it
[53:27] happens sometimes the days where you
[53:28] feel like oh
[53:32] but just start by singing
[53:35] sometimes clapping your hands put the
[53:37] music and it will change atmosphere oh
[53:40] thank you Lord thank you Lord and Before
[53:42] you know it, you already caught up in
[53:43] the spirit. Amen. Amen. Don't give don't
[53:46] give house. Don't give anything to the
[53:48] devil. The devil likes to discourage
[53:51] believers. He likes to show the negative
[53:54] side of everything. Always point to the
[53:56] negative side. Amen. But we are going to
[53:59] point to the positive side because faith
[54:01] is positive. The word of God is
[54:03] positive. Amen. All the time to the
[54:06] positive. Amen. Say amen. Says your
[54:09] water is dried up. He's still He's still
[54:11] in speaking distance of you. He follows
[54:14] you. He knows every move you make and
[54:17] everything you do. It says is longing to
[54:20] hear you call him on the scene. And this
[54:24] and God is waiting for you to call him
[54:26] on the scene. You are not you are not
[54:29] out of speaking distance with him.
[54:31] Though we have done wrong and sinned and
[54:34] turned our backs on him and done things
[54:36] we ought not to do, but yet he is with
[54:39] us. Christ said he will be with us.
[54:42] Amen.
[54:45] Numbers 20. That's why the God called
[54:48] Moses. And Moses and Aaron went out from
[54:50] the presence of the assembly unto the
[54:51] door of the table of the congregation.
[54:53] And they fell upon their faces and the
[54:55] glory of the Lord appeared unto them.
[54:56] And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
[54:58] Take their rod, take the rod, and gather
[55:02] thou the assembly together. Thou and
[55:04] Aaron thy brethren. Speak ye unto the
[55:07] rock before the eyes, and he shall give
[55:09] forth his water, and they shall bring
[55:12] forth to them water out of the rock, so
[55:15] they shall give the congregation and
[55:17] their beast to drink. And Moses took the
[55:20] rod before the Lord. And as he commanded
[55:21] him, Moses and Aaron gathered the
[55:23] congregation together. And he said unto
[55:25] them, "Here now, ye rebels,
[55:28] must we fetch you water out of this
[55:31] rock?" And Moses lifted out his hand and
[55:34] with his rod and smoked the road twice
[55:36] and a water came out abundantly still
[55:39] and the congregation drank and the beast
[55:42] drank. Amen. It say then it says and the
[55:45] Lord spake unto Moses because you
[55:47] believed me not to sanctify me in the
[55:50] eyes of the children of Israel.
[55:51] Therefore I shall not bring this
[55:53] congregation into the land where I have
[55:55] given them. This is the water of Mary.
[55:58] because the children of Israel strove
[56:00] with the Lord and he was sanctified in
[56:03] them. So God is not asking us to smite
[56:08] the rock anymore but to speak to the
[56:10] rock. The prophet says I want to ask you
[56:13] something. If you are born again of the
[56:15] spirit of God that God doesn't doesn't
[56:18] have little weak part and big strong
[56:21] part is all together God.
[56:25] How many are Christian this evening?
[56:27] Amen. Even if you feel weak, you are not
[56:30] the weak part of God. God doesn't have
[56:33] weak part. Amen. God always have strong
[56:36] part. Amen. It says, "Oh, and if you had
[56:39] enough of God in you till you just
[56:41] barely a shadow, there is still enough
[56:45] power to make a new earth." Amen. As a
[56:48] Christian, you have the power to create
[56:50] a new earth. There is not enough power.
[56:53] There is in no not there is no there is
[56:56] enough power to make a new moon and a
[56:58] new system. Think about it as a
[57:01] Christian as a weak as you might be but
[57:04] if you confess your sins you repent and
[57:06] come back to God there is no weak part
[57:09] in God you have the power to create a
[57:11] new system. You have the power to create
[57:14] a new moon a new system a solar system.
[57:18] Really me? Yes you.
[57:22] you brother, you sister. Amen. Amen.
[57:26] He says it's God and it's strong.
[57:28] Prophet realize that what he has said is
[57:30] quite strong. Says, but right now every
[57:33] believer in here has life eternal which
[57:37] is God's spirit in you enough power that
[57:40] will raise up the dead that will heal
[57:43] the sick that will set hobbits in
[57:45] conditions. But you is controlled by a
[57:48] law that spirit that is in you. You are
[57:50] sons and daughters of God. That same
[57:52] spirit that you've got in you will raise
[57:55] yourself up at the day of resurrection.
[57:57] I like the way he's leading. He said
[57:59] there is a law and that law is
[58:01] controlled by faith. So the power you
[58:04] have it in you. The power of the Holy
[58:06] Ghost inside of you. It is enough to
[58:09] make a new moon and a new system. But it
[58:12] controlled by the by the faith. So the
[58:16] problem is not the power. The problem is
[58:18] the faith. Amen. Amen. If we have enough
[58:22] power, if we have enough faith, it will
[58:25] unleash, it will lose that power of God.
[58:28] But if some the problem is is oh God is
[58:31] give us more faith. Faith is revelation.
[58:35] Faith is revelation. Faith is the
[58:37] assurance. Faith is the evidence.
[58:39] Knowing that God, you will fulfill your
[58:41] word. I don't understand how it
[58:44] happened. I don't know how it happened.
[58:46] Yeah, I I'm strongly as a pastor of the
[58:49] church by God's grace, I'm believing
[58:51] that this church is going to be blessed.
[58:54] I don't know how, but I believe it's
[58:56] going to be blessed. And believe that
[58:58] God is going to manifest his power in
[59:00] his church because he will fulfill his
[59:03] word. Amen. As as a song leaders and I,
[59:07] we pray, we dedicate our lives with the
[59:09] musicians, we dedicate, we pray our
[59:11] life, we we dedicate our lives, man. We
[59:14] we we do everything in order. We try our
[59:16] best. And you as a believer, you come
[59:19] expecting God is going to fulfill his
[59:22] word. We don't know how these chairs are
[59:25] going to be filled. Amen. Because God is
[59:27] going to fulfill his word.
[59:30] Amen. Says we are now in the power of
[59:33] the resurrection. We are now in the
[59:35] power of resurrection. If there wasn't a
[59:37] law to that, sons and daughters of God
[59:39] will create them a world out here and go
[59:42] live a private life in it. You have the
[59:45] power in you to do it. Says if you've
[59:48] got a shadow of the power of God in you,
[59:51] you got power to do it. Amen. God is
[59:54] omnipotent. See what I mean? The power
[59:57] that is in you will make you will make
[1:00:00] you could speak a world into existence
[1:00:02] and go live on it. Hallelujah. There you
[1:00:04] are. You know actually as a believer you
[1:00:07] already creating your own world. You can
[1:00:10] be at work there and people are talking
[1:00:12] things and talking this rubbish and
[1:00:14] different things. You go in your own
[1:00:16] corner you start thinking and you create
[1:00:18] the atmosphere. You have actually your
[1:00:20] own world. Jesus Christ was in this
[1:00:22] world but was not part of this world and
[1:00:25] it was in his own world. As you have
[1:00:28] faith you are in your own world. People
[1:00:29] don't understand how can you believe
[1:00:31] this? Oh because you are part of a
[1:00:33] different world. You're not part of this
[1:00:35] cosmos. You are already in your own
[1:00:36] world. Amen. But the prophet is in a
[1:00:39] phys in a in a in a in a physical way.
[1:00:45] Says
[1:00:47] there you are. That's what power is in
[1:00:49] the church now. But it's controlled by a
[1:00:50] law. And that law is not keeping a bunch
[1:00:53] of commandments. It's a law of faith.
[1:00:56] Jesus says all things are possible to
[1:00:59] them that believe. If you can believe
[1:01:01] it, whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:01:04] believe, that is yours.
[1:01:07] Whatever God leads your soul to believe,
[1:01:10] that is yours. It might not to the
[1:01:12] neighbor, it might not be to the
[1:01:13] neighbor, he doesn't see the same way.
[1:01:15] God has not led his soul to believe
[1:01:17] that. But if God has given you something
[1:01:19] in your heart to believe that is yours,
[1:01:21] you can claim it because it's yours.
[1:01:23] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:29] Every place to the soul of your foot can
[1:01:31] set upon by faith, God gives it to you.
[1:01:34] Amen. It's yours. You possess it. If you
[1:01:37] can find the key to to this law of faith
[1:01:40] that opens it to you. You see what I
[1:01:43] mean? That power is controlled. Say if
[1:01:45] you are a son of God, if you are a
[1:01:48] daughter of God, that never leaves you.
[1:01:52] Amen. Sometimes we leave it but that
[1:01:54] never leaves you. Sometimes you can feel
[1:01:57] you know many times I mean many times
[1:02:00] you feel like oh we have to come to
[1:02:02] church pray that and yeah you have so
[1:02:04] busy during the day and everything and
[1:02:06] you come to church like that and then
[1:02:08] they call you for prayer feel like feel
[1:02:11] like your prayer doesn't go too far
[1:02:15] because you look at yourself right oh I
[1:02:17] didn't come oh now they're calling me
[1:02:19] for prayer now they go just pray pray
[1:02:23] now
[1:02:24] but actually The power doesn't leave
[1:02:26] you. Even in that condition, it still
[1:02:30] doesn't leave you. That power is still
[1:02:32] there. It just takes a moment. Say, God,
[1:02:35] I was so busy. I'm sorry, mother God.
[1:02:37] Father, now may you take control. I'm
[1:02:39] quoting your word. It's not my word.
[1:02:41] It's your word now. Now heaven doors are
[1:02:44] open to hear your prayer. It's going
[1:02:47] actually all the way to heaven because
[1:02:49] heaven is in you actually.
[1:02:52] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:55] but never leaves you. It's with you all
[1:02:57] the time, but your faith gets away from
[1:02:59] it, but it's still there. I say
[1:03:01] hallelujah. When you are saved, God
[1:03:03] gives you faith to rise from the mark of
[1:03:06] the earth. Your faith overcomes the
[1:03:08] kings of the world. How you were you you
[1:03:12] were in the world. Now you believe that
[1:03:15] you are Christians and things start
[1:03:17] getting separated from you. You start
[1:03:19] living a different life. The prophet is
[1:03:21] explaining that in a clear way. It says
[1:03:23] no actually it's your faith believing
[1:03:26] that you are a Christian that makes you
[1:03:29] live above the things of the world just
[1:03:32] by knowing that I am a Christian and I
[1:03:35] believe that I'm a Christians I live
[1:03:38] above the things of the world now apply
[1:03:41] that to every situation of the world you
[1:03:44] know like that that that slave that you
[1:03:46] didn't recognize he didn't know you know
[1:03:49] that story of the slave in America there
[1:03:51] oh how the They're being beaten like
[1:03:53] others and doing things like other
[1:03:55] chores like others. But he's behaving
[1:03:57] differently. How is it that he behaving?
[1:04:00] Because he knows who he is. I'm a son of
[1:04:04] a king over there. They might not know
[1:04:07] this king, but I'm a son of that king.
[1:04:10] So I'm living differently because I have
[1:04:12] a revelation not of what people are
[1:04:15] telling me that I am, but what I know
[1:04:18] that I am. A Christian knows who he is.
[1:04:22] Your approval is not based upon other
[1:04:24] people. Your approval is in the son of
[1:04:27] God who has chosen you and made you a
[1:04:30] Christian. Amen. No one made you a
[1:04:32] Christian. God made you a Christian.
[1:04:36] Positive confession this evening. That's
[1:04:38] right.
[1:04:41] says, "Now your faith in the act that
[1:04:45] God has done for you or God has did in
[1:04:47] you to make you a son of God, you quit
[1:04:50] your lying, you quit your stealing, you
[1:04:53] quit your drinking because your faith
[1:04:55] rises you up above it."
[1:04:59] remember one one one time one one one
[1:05:01] one one one one one one one one one one
[1:05:02] one one one one one one one one one one
[1:05:02] one one one one one one one one one
[1:05:03] preacher says it says um I think about
[1:05:07] pastor Mosaka in Paris and it has always
[1:05:09] stuck with me what he said he says you
[1:05:11] know what actually to be a Christian is
[1:05:13] by faith
[1:05:15] to be in the rapture is by faith
[1:05:20] who who tells you that you are a son of
[1:05:22] God except yourself believe that you're
[1:05:25] a son of God you have to believe that
[1:05:28] you a son of God because it's by faith
[1:05:30] that you believe that I'm I believe I'm
[1:05:33] a son of God. I believe I will go in the
[1:05:35] rapture. I believe I be if God takes me
[1:05:37] before I will be part of the
[1:05:39] resurrection. It's the same faith that
[1:05:41] you know that you are a Christians is
[1:05:43] the same faith that you'll go with it in
[1:05:44] the rapture. Yourself have to have the
[1:05:47] revelation I'm a son of God. You make
[1:05:50] mistakes but I'm still a son of God. The
[1:05:53] same faith that you know that you're a
[1:05:55] son of God is the same faith you can
[1:05:57] come with to God with with assurance.
[1:06:00] God hears my prayers. God will answer to
[1:06:04] my prayers. God will save my family. The
[1:06:07] same faith you have, you apply also to
[1:06:09] your family. You apply to the situation.
[1:06:12] If you are sick, you apply to that
[1:06:13] situation as well. Everything is by
[1:06:16] faith. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:23] Now the same the prophet contin if you
[1:06:26] don't do it if you don't have any faith
[1:06:28] or by faith if by faith are you saved
[1:06:30] and that true grace as much as your
[1:06:33] faith will be released that how much
[1:06:36] power you can have. That's the great
[1:06:38] principle. As much as your faith will be
[1:06:41] released that how much power you can
[1:06:44] have because in you dwells the power to
[1:06:48] make heavens and earth. God dwells in
[1:06:51] you and you are sons and daughters of
[1:06:54] God. Amen. There you are. But it's your
[1:06:58] faith. According to your faith be it
[1:07:01] unto you. If you can't believe all
[1:07:04] things If you can believe all things are
[1:07:06] possible. Very I said if you say unto
[1:07:09] this man be moved and don't doubt and
[1:07:12] believe that what you have said then
[1:07:14] you'll see it come to pass. Amen. Having
[1:07:16] faith in this great redeem. Now he says
[1:07:19] now what kind of people ought we to be.
[1:07:23] Having faith in this great redeeming
[1:07:25] Christ that lives in us. I'll be closing
[1:07:29] to save time. This smitten rock that
[1:07:32] never leaves the church. I am with you
[1:07:35] even to the end of the world. The ever
[1:07:38] presence of this great gash of salvation
[1:07:42] and power that poured forth from Calvary
[1:07:44] into the church. The ever presence of
[1:07:47] the living God, the great flow, the
[1:07:49] flowing smitten rock that goes with us
[1:07:52] in our journey. So it's not the prayer
[1:07:55] now is not God give us more power not
[1:07:58] God give us more revelation God give us
[1:08:01] more faith because it already hear him
[1:08:04] you know that many years later on many
[1:08:07] years when they were in the trial you
[1:08:09] know Joseph and and one one king of of
[1:08:13] Israel they were passing by in the
[1:08:15] wilderness and they they ran out of
[1:08:16] water they wondering do do we what are
[1:08:19] we are we dying are we dying and there
[1:08:22] was one of the servants who told them
[1:08:23] you No, there is a there must be there
[1:08:25] is a prophet. Actually, Joseph himself
[1:08:27] being a spiritual is asking, "Is there a
[1:08:30] prophet in the land?" That's the
[1:08:32] question I'm asking. Is there a prophet
[1:08:34] in the land? Oh yes, there is a prophet
[1:08:36] in the land and he has the spirit of
[1:08:38] Elijah. And that prophet is the one who
[1:08:41] serving Elijah. He's still in the land
[1:08:42] somewhere. Oh, go and and find him and
[1:08:45] ask him what we have to do. And they
[1:08:46] went and ask him and he rebuked the king
[1:08:49] of of of Israel because he was he had
[1:08:52] still had idols. But he looked at Joseph
[1:08:54] at because of your righteous integrity
[1:08:56] of your heart. I'm answering. Bring me a
[1:08:59] minister. Bring me some musicians here.
[1:09:02] Importance of music. Amen. Bring in some
[1:09:04] musicians here. And let's create the
[1:09:06] atmosphere this evening. Let's create
[1:09:08] the atmosphere. Let's create the
[1:09:10] atmosphere. And what next? Make sure
[1:09:13] that rock is still here. That rock is
[1:09:16] still here. It has not changed. What we
[1:09:18] need is to dig a little bit deeper.
[1:09:20] Remove the clogs. Remove the things.
[1:09:22] remove unbelief, remove doubt, remove
[1:09:25] remove hesitation, remove the
[1:09:27] negativity, remove malice, remove the
[1:09:30] negative things, and let's bring forth

[1:31:46] Sunday, Monday, I start
[1:31:50] on Monday morning. I start to hear three
[1:31:56] tapes at home and all of them were in
[1:32:01] the way when the prophet was uh telling
[1:32:05] that
[1:32:07] bringing the scripture that
[1:32:11] uh we can lay hands on pray
[1:32:15] and healing about healing and all the
[1:32:18] three tapes were about the same and in
[1:32:21] the same time we were listening so my
[1:32:25] spirit was according the voice behind
[1:32:28] the voice and I just to say well I was
[1:32:33] thinking if if
[1:32:36] going until Wednesday so somebody needs
[1:32:40] to lay my hands on me and I was tempted
[1:32:44] to take a pill because was a a bad pain
[1:32:48] but I don't like to never like to take
[1:32:52] pills until first go to to to the great
[1:32:56] physician. Amen. So he I laid hands on
[1:33:00] me and after yesterday because I I
[1:33:04] couldn't move my my Praise be to God.
[1:33:06] But now you see. Praise be to God.

[1:33:27] test. God bless Christina. Thank God.
[1:33:30] You know, sometimes we want to fight our
[1:33:32] own battle. We forget that we need to
[1:33:34] leave God, right? And so I at work I
[1:33:38] work with this nurse practitioner that
[1:33:39] is always talking bad about me. And then
[1:33:42] sometimes I go home and I cry. I'm like,
[1:33:44] what have I done to her? Then I said,
[1:33:46] you know what? I'm just going to leave
[1:33:47] it in God's hands. So one day I saw this
[1:33:50] young patient that had like visions on
[1:33:52] her face and I took pictures. There was
[1:33:55] also
[1:33:56] and the legs. I took pictures and I put
[1:33:58] it in the system that we used and then I
[1:34:00] consulted about this child and then she
[1:34:02] was like oh you know you're not looking
[1:34:04] right you know this is just not you know
[1:34:08] the words that we are seeing something
[1:34:09] else and she's like focusing on me and
[1:34:13] instead of focusing on the patient I'm
[1:34:15] like no I I can tell you are you not
[1:34:17] looking at the pictures that I have in
[1:34:19] the I only see it's just I'm not doing
[1:34:22] anything I'm not giving antibiotics or
[1:34:24] anything okay you are the prescriber
[1:34:26] do what you need to do. And after I did
[1:34:30] everything and I we sent the child home
[1:34:33] and then after I left to go home, I
[1:34:35] don't know why she went in the system
[1:34:37] again. She was like, "Oh my, how come I
[1:34:39] didn't see these pictures?" And I'm
[1:34:41] like, "No, it's God who hid them from
[1:34:43] you so that you to humble you, you
[1:34:46] know." And then when I went back to work
[1:34:49] the following day, everybody was like,
[1:34:51] "Tina, she was she felt so bad yesterday
[1:34:54] and she wants you to call back mom and
[1:34:56] she tried to call the the patient's mom
[1:34:59] and no answer. So they wanted you to
[1:35:01] come back for them to come back and take
[1:35:03] antibiotics and I was thinking about I
[1:35:06] was like how could she not see those
[1:35:08] pictures and I'm like they are here how
[1:35:10] come she said I didn't see them like you
[1:35:12] know what somebody hid them my god hid
[1:35:14] them from there so that you can come
[1:35:16] back and say sorry to me you know and
[1:35:19] you know calling that I just dialed once
[1:35:22] and that mother answered the phone I'm
[1:35:24] like even you to call the mother. It was
[1:35:26] supposed to be me.
[1:35:28] So, you know what? I was like, you know
[1:35:30] what? I know I should never fight my my
[1:35:32] battles. Correct. God is supposed to
[1:35:34] fight. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:41] It's not our battle. It's the Lord's
[1:35:43] battle. Amen. Thank you very much,
[1:35:45] Chris. Wonderful testimony. God is on
[1:35:48] our side. Amen. I think Sister Katy
[1:35:52] raise your hand or
[1:35:56] Um I just want to give the glory to God.
[1:35:59] Um Sister Matabishi had called me uh I
[1:36:03] think about two weeks back, maybe it's
[1:36:05] three now. um and had just said that um
[1:36:08] her car had to be taken into the shop
[1:36:10] and that she didn't have any vehicle and
[1:36:13] that was on a Wednesday and it was um I
[1:36:17] think like around 5:00ish
[1:36:20] um that she had called around that time
[1:36:23] and um she had asked if we had a vehicle
[1:36:26] and there wasn't a vehicle that we could
[1:36:27] lend her and I told her that I would
[1:36:30] talk to Andrew about it and talk to
[1:36:32] brother Moses and see if we could get
[1:36:34] her a vehicle And then as soon as I got
[1:36:36] off the phone with her, I just
[1:36:38] immediately went to into prayer and I
[1:36:40] asked the Lord to just provide for them.
[1:36:43] And I really had a burden on my heart
[1:36:46] for them and for their need and
[1:36:48] sincerely before the Lord was crying and
[1:36:50] just said like explained all the things
[1:36:52] to the Lord and just I know that the
[1:36:56] Lord heard because it was we get to we
[1:36:59] get to church and here I'm thinking
[1:37:01] sisterishi still doesn't have a vehicle.
[1:37:03] And then I found out that um they
[1:37:06] contacted brother Joseph shortly after
[1:37:08] and brother Joseph had a vehicle sitting
[1:37:10] in his garage and it was just Awesome to
[1:37:13] see how the Lord answered that prayer
[1:37:16] immediately. And sometimes, well, a lot
[1:37:19] of times in my life, the Lord's made me
[1:37:21] wait. Sometimes when I've prayed for a
[1:37:24] lot of things, he's made me wait a long
[1:37:26] time. But it was just wonderful to see
[1:37:28] how the Lord came on the scene
[1:37:29] immediately for them. And it just was a
[1:37:32] great testimony to me. And it blessed my
[1:37:34] heart to see that the Lord met their
[1:37:36] need immediately like that. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:39] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:44] Thank you, Mr. Ket. It's one body. Times
[1:37:47] you feel the pain for the other one and
[1:37:49] God is answering through you. We praying
[1:37:51] through you and answering the prayer to
[1:37:53] show that we need one another. Another
[1:37:56] one is a prayer request a testimony and
[1:38:00] otherwise. Thank you, Lord. Wonderful.
[1:38:02] God bless you richly. We are going to
[1:38:04] sing only believe. Only believe. Then
[1:38:06] we're going to be dismissed. I'm going
[1:38:08] to ask brother Peter to pray after that.

[1:44:07] we be more sincere, oh God. Yes, Father.
[1:44:09] And may it show, Lord. And if we ever
[1:44:13] cheered in a hockey team or a hockey
[1:44:15] game or anything like that, Lord, let us
[1:44:18] remember that that admonition. Lord, we
[1:44:21] need not to be silent. We need to be
[1:44:24] telling the gospel, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:44:26] Help the preacher preach and pull on the
[1:44:28] word, Lord. Yes, Lord. And we commit
[1:44:30] this time and thank you for this prayer
[1:44:32] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. And the
[1:44:36] church says, "Amen." Amen.
[1:44:40] Thank you for your patience. And it's
[1:44:42] good to be in the house of the Lord. I
[1:44:44] love you and God bless you richly. Amen.
[1:44:47] You're dismissed. Thank you, brother
[1:44:48] Peter, for the prayer. Appreciate that.
[1:44:50] God bless you richly. Amen.
[1:44:54] You're dismissed.
