[0:00] Let's go pray each one to the Lord as
[0:04] spoken to us this morning.
[0:07] Speak to him, Lord. If you have been, if
[0:11] you're already born again, thank God.
[0:13] Say, Lord, fill me with more,
[0:17] more love, more than nature, till I come
[0:20] to the earth. You're still struggling,
[0:26] it's not the end yet.
[0:28] The fact that you still have that desire
[0:31] in your heart
[0:33] that shows that God is still you son of
[0:36] God just want that se to be expressed
[0:42] not in a feeling maybe you might not
[0:44] even feel anything today but as you
[0:47] press on that same desire that same tag
[0:51] inside of you the one who started the
[0:53] work before the foundation of the world
[0:56] will bring it full expression, full
[0:59] manifestation.
[1:01] Just yield yourself.
[1:03] Tell him, "Lord, I want more of the Holy
[1:05] Ghost. Lord, I want you to be expressed
[1:08] through me. I want the part of you. I
[1:11] want the portion of the scripture. I
[1:13] want the portion of the word, Father,
[1:15] for my day to be expressed. I want the
[1:18] attribute of God in me to be manifested.
[1:21] Lord, I love you. Lord, I obey you.
[1:23] Lord, I I'm determined to serve you.
[1:26] Lord, I want father to be separated from
[1:30] from the things of the world. And I want
[1:32] the love of God to take over. I don't
[1:34] want to love the things of the world,
[1:36] the things of the flesh, but I want you,
[1:39] Father, to have the Father. You see the
[1:42] desire in my heart is more of you. Speak
[1:45] to your Lord this morning. Father, Lord,
[1:47] I accept your word. I believe your word
[1:49] in my flesh. I can't even do it myself,
[1:52] but Father, I accept your word. I
[1:54] believe your word like Abraham. I just
[1:57] believe your word. Father, may you come
[1:59] and bring the change, the transformation
[2:04] from the inside out. What I desire. But
[2:07] I will I will try my best to confirm
[2:09] myself to the word of God to be
[2:11] obedient. But Father, you know in my
[2:14] flesh I will fail. If there is no power
[2:17] of the Holy Ghost to take over, to
[2:18] transform me from the inside out.
[2:22] Oh God, may you come in a special way.
[2:24] May you come and move. May you, Father,
[2:26] Lord, move me. Put the man aside. Lord,
[2:31] I accept you. Accept your word. Father,
[2:34] transform me. Change me. Change my
[2:36] heart. Change my desire.
[2:39] Oh Lord, may you have the God. Father,
[2:43] may you the omnipotence of God come and
[2:46] take over. Shadow me with the Holy
[2:48] Spirit
[2:49] &gt;&gt; that I might give birth to Christ and
[2:52] let Christ grow deeper and higher,
[2:56] stronger in me, Lord. Father, I'll pray
[2:58] each morning. I'll pray each day. I'll
[3:00] read my Bible, but let the dynamic of
[3:03] God comes, Father Lord, to quicken the
[3:06] mechanic. Oh,
[3:08] Father Lord, I don't want to be just a
[3:11] church member. I don't want to be like a
[3:14] lukewarm Christian. I don't want just
[3:17] father to live from session from emotion
[3:19] to emotion. I want the reality of Jesus
[3:23] Christ. I want father person of Christ.
[3:26] I want the relationship a fellowship
[3:28] with you Lord every day. Oh Lord, that's
[3:32] my desire. Change my heart Lord. Bring
[3:35] me to that place where I'm hidden Lord
[3:38] in the inner chamber having Lord the
[3:41] relationship.
[3:43] Move me in a higher place.
[3:46] Oh Lord, thank you for your word. Thank
[3:49] you for your word that came this
[3:52] morning. Father, accept it in my heart.
[3:54] I receive my heart. I receive it in my
[3:57] heart. Lord, let it be made life in me.
[4:01] Let the Holy Spirit come and quicken the
[4:04] word of God that have received. But
[4:06] Lord, we have received the full word,
[4:09] the restored word, Father, so that we
[4:12] can have a restored fellowship with you.
[4:15] Not just, Lord, Lord, not like a a
[4:19] boyfriend or girlfriend,
[4:21] oh father, not like a sympaizer, but you
[4:24] bring us Lord to a marriage relationship
[4:27] with you. That's why all the loose hand
[4:30] has been restored in the word of God.
[4:31] The message of the hour. Lord, I want to
[4:34] grow deeper. I want to go higher. I want
[4:38] the life of Jesus Christ. I want the
[4:41] literal life. Oh Lord Jesus. Oh father,
[4:46] visit us
[4:49] in our little church. Restored word
[4:53] fellowship.
[4:54] fellowship based upon the restored word
[4:57] of God, the full restoration of the word
[5:00] of God. Move among us, Father.
[5:04] Remember the heads of home, the mothers,
[5:08] oh Father,
[5:10] bring us Lord, bring us to the place,
[5:13] the place where we know you the way we
[5:16] have been known, even to know ourselves
[5:19] the way we have been known.
[5:22] Make this church and strong word of God,
[5:26] full obedience of the word of God and
[5:29] the love of God just taking over,
[5:31] Father, where we have love for one
[5:34] another, united in faith, believing the
[5:37] word of God, trusting in you, Lord,
[5:40] believing in the miraculous, Lord, where
[5:43] the signs and wonders being fulfilled
[5:45] among us, Father. Lord, move in a
[5:48] spiritual way. We don't want to limit
[5:51] you, Lord. We won't want to put you in a
[5:52] box.
[5:53] Father, we want to tap in those un
[5:56] unlimited resources, those untapped
[5:59] resources of the word of God. Help us to
[6:02] dig deeper, Lord. Father, Father, I'm
[6:05] tired of lukewarm religious. I'm tired,
[6:08] Father, of pushing from the outside. I
[6:11] desire something. Oh God, I pray
[6:16] something deep
[6:20] inside.
[6:29] Lord, I love you more as Pastor Zeke
[6:32] prayed on Wednesday. Lord, just I want
[6:35] you more, Father. I want I want the life
[6:37] of Jesus Christ more, more, Father. Not
[6:41] just religious spirit, not even just
[6:45] intellectual knowledge, but that life
[6:48] that is. Oh God.
[6:51] Oh God.
[7:01] The life of Jesus Christ
[7:04] manifested living all the reality of the
[7:08] word of God as we saw in brother.
[7:13] Oh God just you you more and more.
[7:18] Father,
[7:20] our home will reveal restore
[7:24] your harmony will be there one more
[7:26] time.
[7:27] Our church, our life in our walk
[7:32] at work everywhere, Father.
[7:35] Oh God,
[7:37] fill us with the Holy Spirit. We pray
[7:40] you promised us in your word, God, if we
[7:42] ask we ask, you shall give us the Holy
[7:46] Ghost.
[7:47] Fill us with
[7:50] from the elders to the young one
[7:54] to the children fathers know
[7:58] us
[8:01] reality
[8:03] Jesus.
