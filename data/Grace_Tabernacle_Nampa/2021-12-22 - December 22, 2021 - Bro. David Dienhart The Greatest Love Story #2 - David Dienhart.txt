that you need to do into him amen i think that's any other announcements that we need to make no think of okay all right as we get ready to turn the service to brother david as he would come oh and let's not forget obviously as you were praying i was thinking about then brother bob and sister joanne and uh kancha and vershant merry christmas from our congregation we don't get a chance to call you and say that so i know you're tuning in so god bless you and you just have a wonderful christmas with family and uh i know that the shanta and the contra thing are going to work their way here this is it this week they're going to be here friday oh exciting good so anyways i thought i thought i'd make mention of that so they don't feel left out let's say number eight eighty let's get ready for the word let your word be born manger of our heart was a tiny simple staple all beaten and warm hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose someplace special to reveal his majesty so i know if i give him control he'll be born in me let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of play and mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart unlikely the place for his word to unfold but if i'll just yield this vessel and let him have his way from glory unto glory he'll change me day by day let your word in the manger of and my heart let your word be born in the manger of my heart is [Music] who is it that's born in the manger of your heart if the word is born in the manger of your heart and that's the new birth what is the new birth it's jesus christ birthed in you amen amen revealed in you that is the new birth amen amen that goes right along with what's on my heart tonight how'd you know that you didn't did you but he did amen thank the lord glad to be here tonight amen i'm happy to be here god bless you we're not here of our own selves we came here because god gave you faith to come here god gave you faith to come here he certainly can reveal his word to you amen so we just want to lose sight of ourself tonight and give over to him and say lord you know my heart feed me let it not be an intellectual conception of man but let it be a divine revelation given to me by your grace amen let's stand together amen i want to title this part two of what i titled it on the fifth sunday it's called the greatest love story part two greatest love story my subtitle or my subject here on this tonight is our rock our faith the victory our rock our faith the victory now i i really had to shake this down because it's all over the place say amen paul amen i know we know it no way i tell you it's everywhere you've been in the word you know it's everywhere but i just i've got three and a half pages but now after the inspiration come on the thing the notes i've got and my brother to come in there he said you write notes on top of notes i said yeah it's the inspiration hidden now i don't know maybe after a year two hours no i'm just kidding i'll try to break it down it's called part three yeah don't don't don't look at your watch okay let's turn to psalm 31. i didn't even have time to even mark my scriptures out here so if i'm just stumbling around trying to find them you you'll understand why but i want to say again our rock our faith the victory let me just say this bride you have the victory over death hell and the grave though you have the victory over the world darkness satan you notice i'm not saying you will you have you're fighting the good fight of faith but you've already got the victory that's why you know you can't be defeated that's what god's trying to tell the bride and show the bride that she cannot be defeated because she the word living he's the word living they are coming together one and they are one in this day and hour that's the revelation of the message the oneness between you and god amen and you have the victory over the world darkness satan the flesh amen he's made his king rulerships over this you have the victory you have the victory in every trial temptation or test every circumstance you are himself unveiled the complete revelation of the whole thing you have the victory amen amen amen amen psalm 31 3 let's just bow our heads before we read the scriptures our heavenly father as we open the word we can do that physically but lord it takes you to unveil to us what you have already interpreted to us through your profit it wasn't the prophet interpreting anything but it was you working through that prophet interpreting your word and now we see the word being manifested and it is catching away a bride we thank you for this reality lord for the word is not just a letter to us now it's a reality to us it's just not a letter anymore it's revelation it's life it's reality we're becoming one as you pour yourself into us as we feed on the opened word you pour yourself into us we are becoming one for the wedding supper what a great reality of life lord what a great reality of eternal life and i'm thankful lord that we have that revelation our victory we give you praise may you open the word to us and unveil it to us as you have desired and have already purposed to do lord we submit ourselves to you knowing as man we have no ability but our ability and our confidence doesn't lay in the flesh it lays in the unveiled word in us we thank you for this lord we give you praise for we have your name and therefore it's in that name we pray the lord jesus christ knowing that this is not our our own minds and make up praying it's you praying through us and we love you and we give we give glory to you in jesus name amen amen 31 3 for thou art my rock and my fortress therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me psalm 62 verse 6 and 7. very similar he only is my rock brother branham if you recall in the message shalom both messages preached in phoenix and the other preached in sierra vista i think it was shalom he says rock in the scripture means revelation so he is my revelation he is my revelation and my salvation hallelujah he is my defense i shall not be moved in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength the revelation of my strength and the my refuge is in god let's just take verse 8 with it trust in him that's faith trust revel trust in him at all times ye people after we read what we read right here in these first verses before that we certainly can realize if it's revealed to you at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us sila you can be seated turn to first john 5. and i'll i'll bring in the rest of this subject and in hebrews 11 1 the two verses i'll be going to here first john 5 1 through 5. whosoever believeth whosoever believeth that jesus is not was although he was but jesus is we're looking at present tense right now this night right here that jesus is the christ is born of god how can you say that jesus is lord or christ to you without the new birth you don't know it you may have an intellectual knowledge of it but you cannot have the revelation of it in you until he steps in and quickens that seed and brings dynamics to that word placed in your heart and quickens that word and reveals himself then you can say jesus is the christ jesus is the son of is the christ is born of god and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know not imagine by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for whosoever is born of god that's why it said that song see for whosoever is born of god what is the new birth again it's jesus christ birth in you the seed had to be there it's identifying you as the seed and the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth amen amen all right and so for this is the love of god no by this we know we love the children of god and when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous now listen to verse 4 for whatsoever is born of god so we just read here that whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god verse 4 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world remember what he said be of good cheer little children i have overcome the world who is the i have it's jesus christ in you it's jesus christ not not a a nice feeling a nice hope a nice thought it is the person amen of christ in you the same spirit that was in him is in you amen that does his works so whatsoever whosoever whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith our faith is what the victory that overcometh the world what is our faith revelation of who we are amen our rock who is my rock god is my rock who is my fortress and my rock who is my revelation who is your revelation who's revealed in you it's not what you learn amen it's what you have given you by the grace and sovereignty of god identifying of the identifying of your faith being his own faith amen amen you have to have the identification the token is our identification the life in the blood and it can't be on display unless it's in you revealed and you can't have that revealed in you unless the seed laying there that god had to place there amen and if he placed it there then you were existing in his thoughts before the foundation of the world amen is that right you were existing in his thoughts you were the thought of himself we read this on on the sunday the fifth i won't go into all that so much but when jesus christ the logos was manifested in flesh god the son you were right there in him he became the word living word you are right there in him living and here you are today you were in him then and here you are now the living word why showing because you came in him you died with him you raised with him and you are his victory amen amen you are his victory you have victory not going to get it you got it you just catch the revelation of this that that you're the expression of himself you're the very decreed word that had to be spoken in this hour spoke you into manifestation existence you are a spoken word seed bride you are the eternal life you always was eternal you existed in him he chose you in himself before the foundation of the world there's no defeat in that there's no there's no there's no there's there's nothing but a comfort in that amen amen there there's nothing but absolute security in that when you recognize and realize who you are that's our victory we are the victory we are his victory and it's a great love story because god expressed himself down here and became you unveiled what was in the back part of his mind unveiled it to us in this hour took the lid off of the bible took the lid off and and white stone that had no writing on it has now been revealed to us what wasn't said in those seven thunders amen and that's the that revelation is the only thing going to take you in a rapture without that you'll never go in a rapture god kept it secret until he unveiled the secret and its only secret can be unveiled to his bride is the only one that can receive it so aren't you glad you see it aren't you glad you're in him and to try to get it any other way you see is you can you can lay back here but what's come further than pentecost is the is the fullness of pentecost the full revelation of jesus christ has been manifested in us for one purpose the rapture you will find no comfort through any other kind of teaching through any psychology to any learning of man you cannot give comfort neither will you have comfort outside of the revelation of jesus christ in you and if you can't give that to others how do you expect to comfort them and try to mix that with the word it's denominational denominational that's exactly the truth you can't mix the word with your ideas the word stands alone you can't bring comfort any other way but through the revelation of the word you can give a temporary fix but to have the fix in that soul you'll never be able to do that except god reveals his word individually and personally to you as the person of christ in you and then you come to yourself amen hallelujah for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world our faith who is our faith his faith our faith is his faith it's his faith that'll deliver and make it change your mortal body it's his faith amen no other faith you can have an intellectual faith it will not deliver it will not comfort it cannot give a lasting comfort you can speak to the spirit you can have all the emotions you want but unless that word drops in that soul there's nothing else but comfort in jesus christ that's the only comfort you can give people teach them to cast their cares upon christ teach them to cast their cares upon him alone now to sub upon some book of learning amen amen i'm talking about the revelation in the bride i'm talking about the revelation of this word himself revealed in you eternal life is not a as not a a piece of territory a piece of land it's a person the person of christ in you and the only way you're to get from here into a body change is let the leadership of that person lead you you have to come under the leadership of eternal life amen amen and that has to be an unveiling of the word in you which is the birth is the revelation of jesus christ you say you make it too you make it too hard no it's not too hard it just needs to be revealed because when it's revealed it's too simple you can't figure it out in your mind that's the reason you'll either say it's too deep or not it's one of the other but when the word is revealed it's simple it went beyond your human intellect and god reserves that right to himself to reveal to whom he will but he will reveal what he promised he would reveal himself to and that's his people his bride his elect the only one that can be reborn in this hour is the elect right because in non-elect there's nothing in them to be quick they can have all the emotions they can have the emotions of the believer they can they can do everything a believer can do outwardly without the revelation of the word that's the truth we might as well just face brass tacks right down the line you can be anointed of the holy ghost in your spirit and still go to hell amen but unless that holy ghost has got to drop in your soul let me just say this with it when you have the desire and the longing for more of god in your heart you can't get enough of him now you know you're on the track for the rapture because when that hunger is down inside of you there's a deep calling to the deep there's got to be a deep here to respond to that call or you would have never had the deep calling so when that calling is in you i can tell you and bring it to one place that'll give it to you and that's jesus christ who is here present now in bride form and the blood speaking and the blood has been speaking and it's the message of the hour he said bride form yes sir that's the message of the hour it's the son of man in the bright form and the word and the word has been unveiled the back part of his mind the mystery had un has been unveiled to us and we have a right to feed on it we have a right to lay in the presence of it why would do we go to other things put the word in your home put the word in your family put the word there deliver the soul amen we can impart life to believers how many believe that we have we have the ability because of christ in us to impart life to believers amen and we're that's what we're here for the blood is speaking the final voice under her message of the bride is the final voice what's speaking the token is speaking the person of christ is speaking it will leave the word and don't dibble dabble around other things that's not in the word quit your mixing the word with your intellects amen human intellect your understanding is not your understanding it's his understanding but putting your reasoning opinion to the to the promise take it the way it is so be it unto me according to thy word amen let's go to hebrews i didn't get the hebrews did i but that says you know what that scripture hebrews 1 1 but i want to show you this what is this what is this victory we have why do you say our faith is our victory the bible said our faith is our victory is the victory that overcometh the world but hebrews 11 1 i didn't say i said one one i'm sorry 11 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for amen now faith is the substance of things hoped for what's your hope what the promise gives you what the promise promises you you have the word you have the promise amen that's your hope but when you have when you have the faith amen it gives you the substance amen it's the substance of things hoped for it's a revelation it's the substance of things hoped for you see you already have the victory of what the word gave you you've got the victory because your faith because your faith is in the word your faith rests in the unfailing word your faith rests there that's where faith rests faith rests in the unmovable unfailing eternal word that's where it rests amen and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you have the very evidence you've got the evidence of it amen of what's not seen you see i don't see it yet abraham didn't see the son yet amen but he had the evidence what was the evidence it was revealed to him he'll have the son amen he had the evidence of it hallelujah amen the holy spirit the prophet says the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy we know what the evening time message is it's revelations 10. is that right without that you wouldn't be in a rapture without the unveiling of that little book what where's your name what's your name how is he calling you he's calling you by name amen it's calling you by name what name there's only one name given among men whereby you must be saved how's he going to call you you're the mystery you are the mystery revealed in the book amen then he's calling you by name you respond to that because that's in you to respond you're a part of it all along you were just hidden there it was a secret hidden the holy spirit you but is loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh as i said our message is the fullness they pentecos didn't have the fullness but we have the fullness so let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage has come and she that was ready went into the marriage with him she had to be ready she had to come through her pentecost to be ready she had to be born but wentworth further than that there's something come alive in her she was bearing a word eternal word child is that right she was bearing the message himself himself and her what is she doing she's manifesting him she's carrying him for what purpose till for a meeting it had to come to manifestation the sun had to be the head the sun had to come we have to come to a full adoption we've got to come to a physical con a physical meeting not a i don't i'm not talking about physical the way you think physical but there's a meeting in the air we're going to meet the one we've been holding spiritually within us that's alive in us we have become one we're laying in the presence of the sun ripening and she had to have a change she had that come through her pentecost abraham sarah had to have it and they had that before the conception and when they conceived then she conceived and bear it brother braham said though this little bride is impregnated with life bearing his name bearing his life amen conceived what's she coming to what's being what's coming forth brother brown said that life she's she's poor she the life has come into her and she's bearing a word eternal word child amen i'm just going to say these things because i'm trusting you get home and you'll go to searching out what has been said not enough time to say it all right you can't speak at all but it's the word for the season this is where we are we're in a present tense hour that was the hour that was the hour of his mystery to be revealed that was the hour this is bride time brother sister this is the bride age this is the raptured age we've stepped beyond pentecost they made that made way for the holy ghost himself to come right down in perfection again back to the word back to the word back back to a full and a full reality we didn't know we didn't know we are we realize now that we're his blood and we're his life we're flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone for his body there's no defeat in that there's no way to be defeated the word can't be defeated and you're that revealed word and it can't be defeated amen it just can't be that's our faith that's our faith this is our victory when you can face you can face any test you can face any one of these things this faith mastered every circumstance what kind of faith am i talking about perfect faith not a faith a perfect faith brother baptist i'm going to preach about faith tonight but i'm going to preach about a different kind of faith there's great things to be done through an intellectual faith but when it comes down to perfect faith there's no way to make a rapture outside of perfect faith abraham had perfect faith when god said go go surrender and go kill your son isaac and he obeyed and went not even knowing where he's going he just obeyed that's perfect faith hallelujah i pray that god will just take this and at least make you hungry for more i'm hungry for more i want more you think i i brother sister paul said when you think you know it you don't know what you ought to know and yet we know what we know and yet we don't know what we ought to know yet it just keeps on constantly unveiling but what we know we're sharing we're sharing with the people of god that's what the bible said to do amen because faith comes by hearing hearing the word ministered in faith ministered in revelation for the season it brings a faith to the people of god amen god opens the door of revelation the revealing of himself in you is the victory the revealing of himself in you is who you are you find who you are as himself all right let's just go over this as quick as i can i don't want to take much time here so it's been bound but loose in the end time message the holy spirit back in the church again back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh amen christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it and here we are saying this day this message this day these promises this day these things are being fulfilled right here in our midst and we see it we heard of thee by the year now we see more and more more and more and it's going to step right out of this right into a new one what's taken me there my faith the revelation the reality that i'm one with him i'm not boasting i'm speaking revelation i need more of that myself and he promised more of it because when he the person spirit of truth is come he'll lead you he'll guide you into all truth and don't start mixing your ideas with it we have everything we need laying right here in an open book i didn't go over too good i only heard one or two amens but that's the truth what is this that he promised it's the revelation of jesus christ god himself revealed from word to flesh amen he said that's what it is it's the revelation of how god the word was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us and let me add this personally individually this has never happened and never will be a group affair it's an individual affair between you and god alone when you go to start making it a group affair our revelation being a a communal affair i beg your pardon the word is preached individuals can hear and have an ear they have always had it here to hear i can't produce that you can't make that happen but we're preaching to those seed that have an ear to hear that have already got the victory they're already in the rapture and it's working in them i didn't say their body was already changed but they are already in a rapture the rapture is working in them he said the manifestation of the holy ghost anybody ever anybody ever witnessed that everybody anybody ever have the manifestational hill goals you are that manifestation the manifestation of the holy ghost he said is is not will is catching away a bride and he said how do you know the last one's not caught up how do you know the last one's not caught away well i say we're still here that doesn't mean the last one's not caught away amen we're just looking for a body change that'll happen in a moment if we're alive and remain amen is that right it's going to change but the catching away begins in you and this is the hour this is the time of rapture this is the hour of rapture this is our message the rapture this is our message psalm 27 he shall hide me in the secret of his tabernacle and that will put me upon a rock there it is again a rock set me upon a rock lifted up above my enemy the flesh above my enemy the carnal man called david the greatest enemy of god has been defeated we are fighting a defeated enemy hallelujah all right you say oh brother let me tell you young people you can have this just as certain as i can have it this isn't kept from you this is something that's revealed to you [Music] search the scriptures yourself ask god to reveal your his word to you it's not an old people's message it's young or old it's jesus christ revealed that's who the bride is that's what he is whatever he is she is the reality and revelation of the hour the un we are the unveiling of himself whatever he is we are and what he we are he is amen exactly what it is how do you get it through the word through the word of promise for the hour start feeding on the word start feeding on the open book pay attention to how the what the prophet message is the the perfect interpretation of the word by divine vindication let that message open up the scriptures to you amen because without this message without a perfect interpretation by god given through a prophet you wouldn't know what this word says thank god for sending himself and ministering to himself through a prophet and that came out of profit to heart of bride amen and we are the very manifestation of that message in our day our time the end of time we know we've arrived at the end because the seventh seal has been opened it's the end of time of all things it's the end of home life end of church life is the end of this it's the end of that it's into politics life it's end of it's end of the world it's in it's all under that seventh seal but it seals you up in himself amen amen amen the revelation of the secret the secret mystery that can only be known to you bride i'm trying to give you the the what our faith means this is the victory that overcometh the world i don't care you say the world but what about everything connected with it it's systems everything we have a personal genuine personal communion a personal communion a commercial we are we are on talking sp i say should say speaking terms with jesus christ himself god in you you mean your person can walk like that individually i hope to tell you every single day you young people you can walk with god i talked to you last time i preached here about real repentance what we need is a regenuine repentance many in this message have not had a genuine repentance they had a genuine repentance they went to that baptism of water with a genuine faith testifying outwardly of the faith that's in their heart and the faith that jesus christ did for them through the blood you couldn't stop the holy ghost from coming in but what happens is they flack a genuine repentance not so with you young people you know and heard the truth let god search your heart you just say lay before him lay before him talk to him say god i need you i need you i've got to have you otherwise i'm lost and i'm done i watch it asking you to reveal yourself in me let me go to this word let me go to the source of life let me go to the source this little bride will be him she'll be him and she came from the same source he came from that's right this little bride has come from the same source that our lord jesus christ came from and when god manifested himself and then administered himself to a body that body became sun and so has he done through us for what manner of love hath the father shown to us that we are the sons of god now we are the sons of god amen we are now sons of god that's the love of god that's the greatest story that he would open up that book right at the end and keep it a secret from the devil and come and make it known to us we always were in him we always were a part of him we always are we become him and we are him and nothing can change that nothing can take you from that you're going to be him revealed in this day just let god have his way then i hold on to those things which are not leading you to him they're leading you away from him look at the scriptures prophet made it very clear you cannot mix this word with anything it won't mix amen i just want to scream wake up right is she is she's awoke yes sir but it's high time to wake out of sleep i can still preach that to young people i can still preach at the people here it's high time you woke out of sleep and deserved where you're standing quit dilly dally quit dilly dally around with the affairs of man's ideas and teachings and psychology go into your soul and see where you're at brother david you don't have to scream to us but i can't be something i'm not maybe i need a sh maybe i need a skin wrapped around me standing up to mud my knees scream to the top my lungs but some way brother sister god is here the son of man is here what are we doing with him do we realize the reality that he's here where's the message of the hour where's it being lived where is it unveiled it's in the bright form i haven't even got past the first paragraph can't you see where we're standing it goes right behind it can't you see where we're standing life life eternal life is in the grain again it's come up through its carriers now it's come out of the last carry of the shock what has the life the life of jesus christ it's here now again in seed form it's him again that's present with us we ought to be reverent and humble and quit you're fooling around with man's psychologies get down to business with this message you're going to help anyone help them through this word you can't help them any other way but by the revelation of jesus christ how dare anybody try to mix that thing with some denominational spirit so why you so hitting that because that's what's got to be hidden this hour that's what's trying to infiltrate churches is trying to come amongst the bride she will not move off of that word if irene is being the being chosen over polycarp for the first messenger of the age you know where i'm going brother paul polycarp lean toward organization of man fellowship of man but irenaeus not so he real he leaned toward an individual reality of jesus christ in them and he was militant against any form of organization nominational spirit it's a woman's spirit if you're not careful you'll let the woman lead you right down the wrong path and and still say we believe a prophet we believe his message and mix it with everything else you think this is hard better hear it hard i don't want your bony fingers sticking up me in my face in the in the time of judgment saying you didn't tell me i'm a minister i'm obligated to do what god wants me to do through this word i'm nothing david is nothing but my confidence isn't laying in david my confidence laying in the person of jesus christ eternal life leading me home you better make sure that what you're intending to do is according to this promise of the word you better be careful that it's not some denominational spirit thinking of man you better be careful that you let not a woman's spirit lead you down the wrong path time to wake up take possession of our land you say you have to tell the bride that yes maybe potential once start go down get out of step with the word get out of step stay in line where do you see those ones getting out of step at the last at the last right at the last the very last few of them two or three were getting out of step in step with the promise of the hour the word of the hour why because they were looking at this church they were getting the wrong influence they were being influenced by the denominational spirit under the auspices of believing the message getting out of step getting out of step he said stay in line then i seen her just as began to fade i saw her getting back in step who was she the word you have one headship you have one head and that head has to come and that head's here and there's one thing happening the head and the body are coming together and the prophet said they have already united it's an invisible union not known to everybody i realize but i'm not here to say who is and who isn't i'm here to give them the word and if it unveils something that you know isn't right then it's a love of god towards you now you have a chance either accept it or reject it i don't care you say well what if this if i do that what is this one going to think what is this then you become afraid of what they think and you have an idol before you other than the word the living word amen amen amen honestly no wonder the devil fought me over this i didn't know it's going this way but watch this can't you see where you're standing what is it just exactly the same grain that went in the ground what is this the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus oh what if you have a revelation of who jesus is we're not talking about the man here the flesh man we're talking about the word revealed that's your husband that's jesus the christ his name is jesus because he is the anointed he's the anointed word anointing a body amen all right here you are he said it's the same jesus in the bride form i'll tell you there's one thing the devil hates and that when that revelations preach he'll do everything he can to keep you away from that revelation of the bright coming of christ exactly right he'll put everything in your path he can put there he'll just he'll try to throw you off guard off center amen you better be careful what you're doing i would suggest you better go to your head first before you do anything amen amen same church same power same church same thing same word same jesus the same word sucked up through these these carriers these stages come out here and come to a head here here not there here amen and all that life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the rapture oh good when the head comes it's already coming it's already here it's already come what do you think that sign was what was the sign of up there in sunset mountain what was the sign of it it was the sign of the uniting time amen amen amen now i know that the bride loves this kind of preaching the carnal man hates it the carnal believer they'll fight it they'll accuse you of everything under the sun and tell you that you're just being somebody you're boasting of yourself i'm boasting of jesus christ in my own self david has nothing to do with it i'm a new creature in christ i don't even recognize david nor do i give him position for that other than the blood has bought me the blood has sanctified me and he poured his spirit into me now he uses what he's sanctified and will quicken it to his word amen that's what he said he would do hallelujah and all that life come up through there picked up his people now it's forming up into a head for the rapture and he's restoring himself back to as husband and wife restored back to him a husband and wife in the garden of eden the tree of life he's restoring the bride tree he said which is the tree of life amen all right what is it the bright portion of him who was who was eve she was bone of his bone adam and spirit of his spirit he didn't take another lump of clay he took the same lump amen her spirit wasn't different her flesh was made different a different form but it was the same lump amen are you with me that's why the bride is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit the prophet said the bride will be the flesh and bones of jesus christ his body amen and if he quickened those bones what would his spirit do in you it would quicken your bones it would quicken you to speak would quicken you to act it would quicken you it would give you discernment of what's happening the problem is today a lot of people claim the new birth but have no discernment of the hour they have no discernment of where god is living they have no discernment of what position he's in in this hour he had to fulfill the scripture of the bride and the groom or be no there would be no eden had to come back to full restoration amen so he's got to have a bride he's got to have a bride that matches him you got to have a bride that's a complete revelation of himself it completes it do you stop and think at your position well i might fail there is no failure in that revelation it's your victory what i'm trying to say this revelation is your victory look i take the time i don't have the time go back into page 150 151 152 153 154 in the church age book and see what he said because he turned a corner we have the third pull the opening of the word among us but it's so well i will go there i'll just let me finish this up i know you're letting me amen i'm not that quite that place yet but i here we go are you ready hold on tighten your seat belt all right it's the same god brother paul you brought this out is not another god a revelation of jesus christ is not another god it's god abundance god with us god in us it's god above us god above us god in the son god and bride the revelation of who you are is the holy spirit in you amen are you tell me where there's any defeat in that the revelation is who you are over revelation is who you are and that's our faith amen amen amen i wish i could emphasize that but it just i'm emphasizing as hard as i can all right now but it takes the revelation see that's why god reserved that for the bride he reserved revelation because you can't manufacture that but it does come by hearing the word for your day for your hour for your time amen amen i'm not when i say hearing i'm not talking about quit reading i'm talking about quit reading feed on it hear it come wanna come wanna be hear the word wanna hear it preach wanna hear it revealed want to hear want to hear what the prophet said want to hear what the what he said about this word go back and search the scriptures go back and find out what he said and laying right there in the word find let god reveal what he said and reveal it to you in the scriptures then you're saying what he said amen all right now notice making it known by revelation god is making himself known the tree of life the tree of christ's body that's christ in the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery god was in christ christ manifested in the church all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured in that word interesting word poured brother branham page 27 said he's pouring himself pouring himself into her they are becoming one for the wedding supper you mean this could be a mysterious thing that's happening it could be running right through you and you don't many don't i don't say you don't but many don't know it they don't really know that jesus is the christ because to know that jesus is the christ he's present tense jesus is the christ present tense he that believes that that's our faith he that believes that is born again born of the spirit well what would make you not want to be born of the spirit what would make you shy from that you'd want that you'd want that so bad you'd you could almost taste it and you can you can eat it that's right let god start revealing himself in you you that's the spirit in you doing it see the birth is so simple people make it too complicated it's that word that's come alive in you you had an ear to hear the word is christ revealed in you jesus christ is the revelation of god that's simple jesus christ is the revelation of the word what about that word revealed in you who is it when it points you back the word and hold you and won't let you pass from this word i don't care how much you did this and did that and did this you can be without this in you it's got to come off of this to revelation amen amen amen amen all right let's see if we can close i'll just pass the first page here and see what i can it's back to the original adam and eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood same spirit and everything else and makes the church the blood of christ by the spirit amen and that holy ghost that baptizes you into his body that holy ghost will only recognize his body his flesh his word think of that if you have the holy ghost in you you'll discern the scriptures you'll discern the hour you're living in is not what he promised he said he would reveal these things to you and make it known where's the evidence laid then of the holy ghost the evidence slays in the revelation of it in you gives you have an ear to hear amen amen and that holy ghost is going to point you off to some other idea out here i'm going to point you off of the word it's going to lead you to the word i don't care how long you've been a message believer do you have the holy ghost have you received the holy ghost since you believed do you have the token the identification that your faith has been received well i believe in the blood have you received the token identification that your your faith is his amen if you have that holy ghost in you you have his faith that's our victory amen i'm driving that home i'm just keep driving it i'm not excuse me for the lord i'm not he is i believe that i believe in the leadership of eternal life i believe you can know it so clearly that you'll let go and let him do it quit questioning him in his leadership but he's not going to lead you off the word and if he's leading you off the word and you're not discerning it you need to be born again that's right it's the truth you see where we're at your husband's not discerning what your wife wears out comes out of the street out of the home dressed in things so tight draws a man's attention to her she presents herself where's the men that recognize it where's the men that'll take possession over the home and see what their wives are feeding on what's influencing them what are they listening to what's your family listening to what's your children listening to what's influencing them what do you have in your home that shouldn't be in there apply the token it must be on display the token must be on display that's the word living and an action and you become that word living and in action it'll be on display i guarantee it amen because the holy ghost will make it known to you you can't be an unholy in unholiness and say i got the holy ghost and be unholy i'm not talking about outer i'm talking about the inner working through the outer amen because the bride today the holy ghost today that god today is living in his house and he's working and living and working moving and working and living through his bride working in and through his bride and he is the word amen it's recognizing how do we overcome recognizing that devil let the holy spirit recognize that devil in every one of his tricks and realize next realize that you have overcome him not through your ability but the ability of the holy spirit in you has already defeated him and he's defeated amen all right lord you help me get through now amen look what was once god's mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of christ once god's great secret in his mind before the foundation world is now made manifest is now made manifest think of it oh my amen think of it think of it but he has a secret he sealed it up couldn't be open until the seven seals were opened and revealed the hidden secret of what those sunders said the bride must know it and she will and she is and is being preached amen all right but god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now unfolded in jesus christ then given right down to his bride what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to his church it's the greatest love story the two loves of filio and agape are so close together would deceive the elected if possible that's the truth you can love ephelio love and have a friendship love and say it's a love of god but the love of god will recognize the truth amen the love of god will rejoice in the truth amen be careful what you're being influenced by even closest thing to you me he's whispering secrets to his bride and just to her he said i don't mean these flirters i'm talking about his wife i mean his wife by having the revelation of this secret made known to them by his grace amen amen all right just about time to close what is it it's not them people not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it's the seed it's that seed amen you ever get a hold of that revelation brother sister you you can realize you conquered this devil that keeps wanting to point his finger at your little bony flesh and tell you did this and you did that you can turn right back to him i never did it at all i never did it at all who do you think you are jesus christ the revealed word that's exactly right i'm not boasting about nothing but that's the truth they hated it yesterday in his day they'll hate it now when the bride begins to come boldly more and more to testify of who she is and where she stands not doing it arrogantly we're not doing it for show we're not doing it to draw attention we're doing it because it's the truth and it's the substance of things hoped for and it's the evidence of things not seen and we live by that faith amen amen the headship in the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people that's the reason husband and wife is no longer twin you can see why that female denominating spirit hates this type of message why because not the right seed well they can live the part walk the park speak the part act the part but have no life you know that's the truth go back to annoyed one's the end time go back to every message after that brother brown and practically every message brings that ministry that mystery out of that every single time why because it was important that we knew this at the end time when it was to be manifest and we wouldn't let that be deceiving us is that right that's exactly right amen amen brother david your preacher likes the last message you preach maybe it will be i don't know i'm getting up in age i don't know when the last message will i intend to stay right here leaning on his everlasting arms and let him continue to reveal it and i expect him to live it i expect to live it because he's living it his ways are perfect and my ways are made perfect because i'm in him and he's in me how can i say that his leadership would be imperfect is because i put my own ideas my own thinking to it instead of taking him at his word and let him vindicate that word in me and testify of it through me my my my i'm trying to find a place to stop i really am it just keeps coming in waves over me and waves over me we're not playing not playing church it may be a wednesday night brother sister don't you come to church for a social hour you better come in the spirit prayed up get yourselves right put your dilly dowling around other things get in the spirit get in the word and come in the church in the spirit you'll see things change around here you start changing your home you'll see church life change start putting out the word first place in your life not things put the word first place give it preeminence give it headship you bowed other things in the place of that word in the phrase of that word it's idolatry it's an idolatrous spirit put anything above that that's hard preaching i know it's hard preaching but it's truth i know it's to me also and it makes me tremble because i've got to give an answer someday for what i'm preaching i've got to stand before you this service right here at judgment will come right up in the open right here and every thought in our mind and every thought and even the clothes you wear will be right in the screen before everyone you can't hide it think of that let's come expecting god to speak expect god to speak through our pastor come expecting god to wash you separate you from the things of the world separate you from ideas of man get out of those old books you've been reading and get in the real book of life get in the original life get in the original word satan is busy at perverting it adding to taking away that denominational spirit is nothing but adding to the word or taking from the word when you try to mix it that's exactly what's happening amen oh it's not you say pentecost last denomination no that spirits come right down here and says why would you leave the message do you then let's see the token on display let's see it revealed in you let's see it manifested let's see it in an everyday life in everyday living justified he said there you are there's the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in these last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory you realize you're the message he died for this purpose and we are the proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can it keep gonna us you in any little old grave amen i'm gonna keep you in any rut with both ends kicked out the grave get out of your rut get into life if there's anything in you drawing for that wanting that let go and let god have his way with you i don't care if it takes all night right by your bed get down before and say god i've got to have you that's all there's to it the hour's late what if the last one's in but if you still have that pull in your heart for him go before him let him take his spirit and quicken that little tug toward him that's what has to be quickened you'll pour the dynamics upon and water the mechanics that you had with him before the foundation of the world when those two come together it's jesus christ the same today as he was yesterday amen and we'll be forever it'll manifest jesus christ you will have no problem believing the message then you'll want to line up with it every bit of it god will be so manifest in his bride this this victory will come through through sanctuary luther wesley sanctification baptism of the holy ghost go right on into perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons god will be so manifested into his brightest church till they'll both be the same they are one now you see where we're at he said people say i'm getting ready to die oh my i'm getting ready to live the thing of it is getting ready to live living christ victorious life over sin death hell i already have the victory he's my victory i'm his evidence i'm the evidence of his victory amen amen amen i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me there's my victory and the life i now live in this flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me amen amen what's kept you brother david him from an age of 12 he's kept me and it can keep every one of you what happened to you brother david he revealed himself to me that's the simplicity i was his seed promised message promised word for this age that had to respond to that and did respond to the message of this hour and it just keeps becoming alive and alive and i can't get enough of it i can't get enough of it and he keeps revealing himself he keeps revealing himself and i get full my cup gets full and running over jesus lived i'm closing stand listen to what i'm reading here jesus lived in a world that no man no one knowed about think of that now a minute you think everybody's going to know what you're preaching no but i don't know who is and who won't i trust that every one of us in this room this evening will be bride i'm preaching like you are amen amen i'm not the judge of who is and who isn't but jesus lived in a world that no one knowed but i'm preaching i'm i'm reading this from perfect faith in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which he was [Music] amen what about living in the in a perfect faith in a perfect god you are [Music] amen that's right all right what he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you said you would do what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you not to do you won't do then the people began to say you'd be a mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they're a mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves i like that statement because themselves isn't david themselves is the living word themselves and christ himself that's my living that's where i dwell that's my habitation that's why i said no plague gonna come nigh that dwelling amen he may try to touch this but it can't touch that he can't touch where i'm living he can't get to me hallelujah that's our faith [Music] that's the revelation of who i am that's a revelation of who the bride is that's the revelation of who you are what is it the revealed jesus christ god himself living in you here today the son of man revealed again [Music] that's the hour that's the time that's the ministry that's the seal that's the seventh deal that's what's the thunder said that's the revelation amen she knows where she come from she knows who she is and she knows where she's going hallelujah i can't say hallelujah loud enough hallelujah i thank god for that victory i thank god for this victory i thank god for this rock listen to the rest of this when a man walks he said they would be they would live in a world to themselves and when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i need substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material hallelujah how he wants to get into bride material and let the water of the washing of the revealed work the message the word of the hour the bible let it wash you come under the washing of this word lay down those other things that want to consume your time and give time to jesus redeem the time for the days of evil buy it back the devil's stealing it from you recognize the thievery that he's doing what's he doing it for [Music] just kill to steal to destroy to kill but jesus said i'm come the message of the hour i am come to give life and that more abundantly [Music] keep your choice [Music] take our choice my choice too your choice what are you going to do with this jesus called christ what are you doing what are you going to do with jesus called christ here now [Music]

little bit of word into it and add the message with it wait a minute brother sister you're mixing it that's not the spirit [Music] you're getting into rapture condition you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor the deacons the trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into his kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god see he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says they're not a shadow of a doubt nowhere you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you'll go right on just the same they'll tell you they'll say you're dogmatic now we are [Music] well you think you're the only one right no and yes [Music] that's right you understand what i'm saying a man said you make yourself god before the people brother branham he said that's not so far the truth is it brother he said i knew which side of the flesh he was on brother braham said i'm not god no part of me is god but i am god is that right what side of the flesh was he speaking on if i speak about david it's corruption it's antichrist to be that but if i speak about the seed that's come alive and being quickened in me and quickening my body to this word it is true i am that revealed word [Music] amen amen you walk in a world with god alone you're baptized into the kingdom there's nobody in there but god in you the lord says you walk now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail did you hear that okay that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with this perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others god bless you brother sister we could go a lot of things like this tonight take it all the way through the message i'm glad god turned the corner and you know what i'm more happy about i could turn the corner with him [Music] because that was his working not mine that's his duping not mine [Music] that didn't make me anybody that makes me the least of all because i'm a servant of people [Music] amen but we each one
