[33:14] [Music]
[33:20] [Music]
[33:27] [Music]
[33:32] in the name of my lord
[33:38] hallelujah can we say amen this morning
[33:41] amen we are not a powerless people
[33:44] amen we
[33:45] we look through this scripture and we
[33:47] see
[33:49] how god has come down
[33:51] in every generation
[33:54] not just here and there my brother and
[33:55] sister but a consistent pattern god
[33:59] coming in every generation and dealing
[34:02] with the hearts of his people
[34:05] amen
[34:06] now what we got to decide today is whose
[34:09] people we are
[34:10] amen because if you recognize today that
[34:14] you're god's people
[34:15] then you need to just stop
[34:18] maybe life is tough
[34:20] maybe circumstances are such
[34:24] but if you just stop and look around
[34:27] you'll find god amen
[34:30] no generation will be able to say
[34:32] i searched for god
[34:34] and could not find him
[34:37] he is here he's present
[34:39] now saints i'm going to put a little
[34:40] disclaimer before we start the service
[34:42] today i'm going to speak some things
[34:45] very narrow
[34:46] vision of things this morning that will
[34:49] be
[34:51] straightforward
[34:52] maybe you might call it blunt
[34:54] it's been something that's been on my
[34:56] heart for quite a while
[34:58] and certainly i don't
[35:00] speak it to offend i speak it because i
[35:03] love you amen amen
[35:05] uh before we go into the service um
[35:08] i'm we're happy uh
[35:10] our daughter sister joe lynn and sister
[35:13] leah are flying home today
[35:15] and
[35:16] you notice we
[35:18] context that as this is home
[35:21] yes
[35:22] and brother david and sister diane i
[35:24] don't know if sister ruth's going with
[35:25] them probably so
[35:27] going to be traveling to oregon this
[35:29] week i think in the latter part
[35:31] to
[35:32] preach for brother rich
[35:34] and in the latter part of this week lord
[35:36] willing sister jerry and i will be going
[35:38] to a wedding so
[35:41] we'll be leaving lord willing i think
[35:43] thursday afternoon evening so anyway
[35:46] just remember those
[35:48] traveling mercies and as we've already
[35:49] had the request let's remember brother
[35:52] sergey is going to have quite a journey
[35:53] back
[35:54] down to take care of more business i
[35:57] think the last one was 25 hours 27 hours
[36:00] or something stuffed in a van
[36:02] with
[36:03] people who want to save money so they
[36:05] don't even run the air conditioner
[36:07] and
[36:08] they've maximized their profits of
[36:10] hauling their cargo
[36:12] and you know that's how they feel about
[36:14] it they're not other humans in that van
[36:16] with them that's cargo
[36:19] and uh so we just want to definitely
[36:21] remember them
[36:22] amen it was something else i was going
[36:24] to say
[36:25] but i don't remember my appreciation
[36:28] circumstances caused me to miss a great
[36:31] portion of the work yesterday
[36:34] of which
[36:35] i'm
[36:36] sad about that but
[36:38] you notice it looks like there's been a
[36:40] war outside of our church
[36:42] and uh the enemy which in this case was
[36:44] all them shrubs that have been there i
[36:46] think since the 70s
[36:48] uh and they thought they were home or
[36:51] now
[36:51] uh
[36:52] at the landfill so anyway uh we just
[36:56] pray and each one and we'll have another
[36:57] work day and try and just
[37:00] finish this up and make the outside of
[37:02] our church look good so
[37:04] amen i want to speak to you this morning
[37:07] on my calling is clearer now
[37:10] and
[37:11] i believe that saints as we come
[37:14] as each day comes and we come in
[37:16] maturity
[37:18] as sons and daughters of god
[37:20] that um
[37:21] our calling who we are in jesus christ
[37:24] should be clear
[37:25] every day and if it's not clear today
[37:28] than it was yesterday and the weeks
[37:30] prior
[37:31] then i encourage you just to find a spot
[37:33] before the lord and get down and ask him
[37:36] for clarity
[37:37] because uh time is being fulfilled
[37:41] you know through the ages the scripture
[37:43] says that the scorner will say you know
[37:45] where is his coming
[37:47] but through the ages my brother and
[37:49] sister if you think about this that
[37:51] through the ages every one of those
[37:52] generations thought that was the coming
[37:54] of the lord
[37:55] amen
[37:57] but by revelation we see all of these
[38:00] scriptures being fulfilled
[38:02] everything put in place and and uh if i
[38:05] could use this little analogy uh my
[38:08] brother and sister when the puzzle is
[38:10] half finished
[38:12] we can say this puzzle will be completed
[38:15] but when the last piece of the puzzle
[38:18] is put in place we have to change
[38:21] our vocabulary from it will be completed
[38:24] to it is completed
[38:27] and that's what god's doing in this
[38:29] generation we're seeing the fulfillment
[38:31] of of scripture we're seeing the
[38:33] fulfillment of the promises of the ages
[38:36] of revelation now when we use the word
[38:39] revelation often times people will say
[38:41] well this man spoke this and this man
[38:43] spoke this and people want to put a time
[38:45] stamp well this man spoke this before
[38:47] this man did so is this man plagiarizing
[38:51] isn't that interesting now you notice
[38:53] the spirit in the world today is such a
[38:55] taboo to plagiarize
[38:58] now i hope you're going to catch this
[39:00] so it's such taboo to plagiarize and
[39:03] people will say oh oh they plagiarized
[39:06] that but when it comes to the word of
[39:08] god god speaks an everlasting promise
[39:12] and so whether it was spoken in uh
[39:15] 16 something or 17 or 18 something or in
[39:19] the 2000s or right now
[39:22] for a son of god to speak the
[39:25] everlasting promises of god is not
[39:28] plagiarizing
[39:29] it's a stirring of the remembrance
[39:32] amen to stir up our minds of these
[39:35] promises and so we live in a day that
[39:37] people are so
[39:39] afraid to really preach the gospel and
[39:41] go into many of the promises of god
[39:44] because they don't want to be viewed as
[39:46] just repeating
[39:48] something that a man spoke many years
[39:51] ago but as god speaks promises now this
[39:54] is kind of kind of strung out through
[39:57] the message so i can't just tell you go
[39:58] to this sermon this sermon but you see
[40:01] brother branham summed it up when he
[40:03] said
[40:04] i have come to put all the missing
[40:06] pieces in place
[40:09] so it's not like he's coming with a
[40:11] whole new gospel
[40:12] he's putting everything in its correct
[40:15] order
[40:16] and uh here again it reminds me of of
[40:19] just a conversation with sister ruth
[40:21] about two-sided puzzles and i had never
[40:24] experienced a two-sided puzzle before so
[40:27] that means that peace can fit in that
[40:29] place
[40:31] but it might not be long there so you
[40:33] have to make sure you have continuity
[40:35] and god is putting in this hour we're
[40:37] living in now continuity in his word
[40:40] showing us how clearly these things fit
[40:43] in place
[40:44] amen let's turn in our bibles this
[40:47] morning to the book of luke
[40:49] and i pray today this will be an
[40:52] encouragement to you
[40:53] uh and uh
[40:57] yeah
[40:58] praise the lord
[41:00] luke 23 starting with verse 34
[41:04] to verse 45.
[41:11] now we are going to take out of luke's
[41:14] account
[41:16] of the crucifixion and we're going to
[41:18] draw just a little bit
[41:20] uh out of this thought but this will
[41:22] just help us lay a foundation going
[41:25] forward and i felt like that this whole
[41:27] some of these scriptures would be
[41:29] beneficial
[41:32] then jesus then said jesus father
[41:36] forgive them
[41:38] now saints i hope you can catch this
[41:42] jesus was actually declaring right there
[41:44] when he says father forgive them he's
[41:47] saying i
[41:49] forgive them
[41:52] so he brought it right down he didn't
[41:54] put it in a different dimension in a
[41:56] different context he brought it right
[41:58] down personal
[42:00] because you see
[42:01] he was god in flesh
[42:04] and so he is saying
[42:07] you know what they don't know what
[42:08] they're doing but i forgive them anyhow
[42:10] and as i spoke to you the other day and
[42:12] we'll do our best to bring this about
[42:14] today to make a connection
[42:16] you see
[42:18] these things
[42:19] had
[42:20] to happen
[42:22] it didn't need a disrupter to come in
[42:24] there and say whoa stop you can't
[42:26] crucify him
[42:28] he's an innocent man and and used some
[42:30] authority to stop the process
[42:32] this
[42:33] had to happen
[42:37] not just to fulfill prophecy
[42:40] but for you and i
[42:45] they know not
[42:48] what they do
[42:49] and they parted his raiment and cast
[42:51] lots and the people stood beholding and
[42:53] the rulers also with them derided him
[42:56] saying he saved others
[42:59] let him save himself if he be christ the
[43:02] chosen of god
[43:04] and the soldiers also mocked him coming
[43:07] to him and offering him vinegar
[43:09] and saying if thou be the king of the
[43:11] jews
[43:12] save thyself
[43:14] and a
[43:15] superscription was
[43:17] also was written over him in the letters
[43:19] of greek and latin and hebrew this is
[43:22] king of the of the jews this is just
[43:24] another mockery
[43:26] one of the male factors which were
[43:28] hanged
[43:29] on him saying if thou be christ save
[43:31] thyself and us
[43:33] but the other
[43:36] aren't you glad
[43:38] but the other answering rebuked him
[43:40] saying dost now thou fear god seeing
[43:44] thou art in the same
[43:46] condemnation
[43:48] and we indeed justly
[43:51] now i want you to put yourself as the
[43:53] other one on the cross here
[43:55] and we indeed justly for we receive the
[43:58] due reward of our deeds
[44:01] but this man has done nothing amiss
[44:04] now i want to tie that i don't want to
[44:06] preach you and keep you standing but i
[44:07] want to tie this back to last sunday
[44:09] remember what's between you and i
[44:12] and judgment
[44:17] let's be realistic with ourselves don't
[44:19] say oh we're forgiven we're forgiven it
[44:21] will never hurt you to remember
[44:26] that if you received your just reward
[44:31] amen
[44:32] now this is not to let the devil condemn
[44:34] you and this is not to have a false
[44:36] sense of piety this is for us to be
[44:40] reminded
[44:41] so that we never go back
[44:44] where we came from
[44:46] because the wages of sin is death and so
[44:49] we know that we should have been hanging
[44:51] on our own personal cross
[44:53] but we have one who stood in our place
[44:56] and by his blood we are forgiven
[44:59] amen
[45:04] but this man hath done nothing amiss and
[45:06] he said unto jesus lord remember me when
[45:08] thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus
[45:11] said unto him verily i say unto thee
[45:13] today shalt thou be with me in paradise
[45:16] and it was about the sixth hour and
[45:18] there was a darkness over all the earth
[45:20] until the ninth hour
[45:21] and the sun was darkened and the veil of
[45:23] the temple was rent
[45:25] in the midst
[45:27] heavenly father we just ask you to bless
[45:28] this time together lord and father i
[45:31] just pray that you would just give us
[45:33] the words the wisdom father to express
[45:36] lord these things that are upon our
[45:38] hearts and lord just help us today we
[45:40] pray and the saints and those around us
[45:43] and families and neighbors and
[45:45] lord what just to move in their midst
[45:47] lord
[45:48] father
[45:50] that people could truly find the tender
[45:53] mercies
[45:54] find your grace lord find the blood and
[45:57] lord be redeemed
[45:59] father ask you to be with us today guide
[46:01] us in the name of jesus christ amen you
[46:04] may be seated
[46:17] you know i think it's always good saints
[46:19] that we start off you know
[46:21] and as i shared with you part of this um
[46:24] to to look into to speak on study in the
[46:29] mercy seat was brought on by the words
[46:31] of an individual that that was expressed
[46:34] to me and they were very adamant in
[46:36] their position and and i was like you
[46:39] know that's not right and something laid
[46:41] upon my heart at that time that i wanted
[46:43] to just bring to the church that we
[46:45] would look through and discuss as it
[46:48] were uh speak on these things of the
[46:51] mercy seat that we would not be
[46:53] misconstrued in our understanding that
[46:56] we would not uh you know have some kind
[46:59] of teaching that come from somewhere at
[47:02] some time
[47:03] that puts god you know out there and
[47:06] this is a problem in the world of
[47:07] christianity uh there there is
[47:10] traditions our spirits will hit on this
[47:12] a little bit lord willing that that puts
[47:14] god out there somewhere and he's out
[47:17] there on the throne he's out there on a
[47:20] mercy seat he's out there
[47:22] my brother and sister that's never been
[47:24] the relationship that god has had with
[47:26] his children god has always been an up
[47:28] close and personal god
[47:31] amen he is not a god of somewhere else
[47:34] in the far reaches of the universe but
[47:37] my brother and sister he's always dwelt
[47:39] in and amongst his people amen and so
[47:42] you know to have someone kind of put it
[47:44] that god has got to if he's here he
[47:46] can't be there and if he's there he
[47:48] can't be here and they totally
[47:50] misconstrue or misunderstand the word of
[47:52] god and you know sometimes these are
[47:55] just simply teachings that come out of
[47:57] other things and never been let go of
[48:00] and so they come to the message they
[48:02] come to the word of the hour and they're
[48:04] still holding on to a teaching that come
[48:07] from some other age or some other time
[48:09] under some other uh dispensation or
[48:12] revelation and so we just want to look
[48:15] through the things of god and god stir
[48:17] our heart is my prayer that we would
[48:19] have a complete full and true
[48:22] understanding of the word of god
[48:25] now as we look my brother and sister in
[48:27] this and i'm going to refer to this as
[48:29] the story we look into the story and we
[48:32] see how that in this moment of time uh
[48:36] we see our lord jesus christ coming and
[48:39] he is fulfilling the very word or rarity
[48:41] prophecies of the prophet isaiah and
[48:44] jeremiah and on through the scriptures
[48:46] zechariah all of these prophecies have
[48:49] come been laid into scripture and laid
[48:51] there and now because god is god they
[48:54] will be fulfilled and so we see now our
[48:57] lord jesus christ is is here in this
[49:00] time in this place and there is a
[49:03] mockery of if this is god or is there a
[49:06] god and if he is god why doesn't he save
[49:08] himself and my brother and sister we
[49:10] have to recognize
[49:12] and i believe as as christians as
[49:14] believers we recognize that my brother
[49:16] and sister if he had saved himself we
[49:18] would be lost
[49:19] amen and his goal was never to save
[49:22] himself his goal was as it is placed in
[49:26] scripture a lamb slain before the
[49:28] foundation of the world so his goal was
[49:31] always to save us his goal was always to
[49:33] redeem us and my brother and sister that
[49:36] is where the opening of the seventh seal
[49:38] comes down because it is the book of
[49:41] redemption and redemption must be
[49:43] manifested if redemption then stays on
[49:46] the page and will make reference in the
[49:47] service today but if the words of the
[49:50] testator stay
[49:52] unfulfilled
[49:55] then nothing
[49:57] is distributed
[49:59] not that's not right how do i say that
[50:01] distributed
[50:03] it's not distributed but you see when
[50:06] the words of the testator are brought to
[50:08] pass and the word is then spread amongst
[50:11] god's people now you say brother paul um
[50:14] before jesus christ there was the law
[50:16] but my brother and sister the law was an
[50:18] old covenant and it was to bring to a
[50:21] place where people could then take a
[50:24] natural transition
[50:26] i hope you understand what i'm saying a
[50:28] natural transition into the fullness of
[50:31] the plan of god so the lamb being slain
[50:34] was never god's plan as it were and him
[50:38] himself going to calvary was not the
[50:40] substitute for a previous plan that
[50:42] didn't work
[50:46] so god bringing his word to come down
[50:48] because the day that we're living in was
[50:51] no longer to be a day that we brought a
[50:53] lamb once a year for our sins but the
[50:56] lamb has now been slain and we are here
[50:58] each day every day in fact let's break
[51:01] it down a little bit more it's not just
[51:03] every 24 hours amen this is not every
[51:06] hour this is not every uh you know half
[51:09] hour this is every moment of our life
[51:13] the blood is applied
[51:15] amen that we have a a a offering a sin
[51:19] offering an atonement for us and i thank
[51:21] god you know he's not a god that just
[51:23] responds uh you know uh you know you you
[51:27] you can call you can leave a message you
[51:29] can ask someone to return a call and uh
[51:32] you know when you call back a week later
[51:34] and the secretary says oh it usually
[51:35] takes him um a week or two to respond
[51:39] i'm just speaking in a natural sense you
[51:41] actually go out and find someone else to
[51:43] do business with because what i needed i
[51:45] needed last week i don't need it next
[51:47] week
[51:48] and so we're looking we serve a god
[51:50] who's not looking to put you on pause
[51:53] you say but brother paul i've been
[51:54] praying about this and i don't seem to
[51:56] have an answer it's in god's time
[51:59] it's in god's time and it will arrive
[52:01] right on time amen it will be for the
[52:04] molding of our character because here
[52:06] again i know church
[52:08] i know that you listen to your pastor
[52:10] and and you're all praying for patience
[52:18] so patience means that there's a waiting
[52:21] period
[52:23] a calm
[52:25] a time not necessarily of inaction
[52:38] so as we look at this today i hope i can
[52:40] articulate this i struggled a little bit
[52:42] this morning uh brother david expressed
[52:45] this here recently uh you know i didn't
[52:47] know which one of these three or four
[52:49] avenues to go on amen
[52:51] and
[52:52] i try not to bring all three or four of
[52:54] them to you today
[52:56] all that jesus said would come to pass
[52:58] my brother and sister is now
[53:00] has now happened it's there that as he
[53:04] is speaking to
[53:05] the disciples he's speaking to the
[53:07] people he's laying a little word here
[53:10] laying a little word here telling them
[53:12] of what is going to come to pass and so
[53:15] it's there that they don't really fully
[53:17] comprehend what is coming they they have
[53:20] ideas they kind of have different
[53:22] differences uh in the meantime there's a
[53:24] drama behind the story uh you know who's
[53:27] gonna be at your right hand who gets to
[53:30] sit closest to you who's more important
[53:33] who is this who is that and so what it
[53:35] is is it actually shows you saints that
[53:37] they're missing what jesus is really
[53:40] telling them and they're looking at the
[53:42] drama of the story amen they're looking
[53:44] at how they feel or trying to figure out
[53:47] now was this about me you know and what
[53:49] and they're missing the fact that he's
[53:51] telling them what is going to happen in
[53:54] the coming days to the son of man amen
[53:57] and so it's there that they are looking
[53:59] now and seeing themselves and you'll
[54:01] find
[54:02] and we won't go into this in depth today
[54:05] but you'll find that out is actually
[54:08] after the passing
[54:11] of our lord jesus
[54:12] that the clarity starts to come
[54:17] they they were still trying to figure
[54:18] out and and you just read about this and
[54:21] and i just my heart just you know as i'm
[54:23] studying this my heart is breaking
[54:26] because here is peter believing he has
[54:28] great revelation great foundation in the
[54:32] gospel and yet as jesus rebukes him i
[54:35] don't believe it's still soaked in until
[54:38] very sits in the midst of the group or
[54:41] congregation as it were and a young lady
[54:43] says are you not one of them i believe
[54:45] you are one of them and he denies and i
[54:48] want you to talk about the depth of
[54:49] disparity must have been in his soul
[54:51] because the scripture says that he
[54:53] cursed
[54:55] this is a believer
[54:58] how could this happen he's a believer
[55:02] and just as it was spoken to him
[55:05] when he comes to that point he hears the
[55:07] crow
[55:10] can you imagine how crushed he must have
[55:12] felt
[55:13] i knew
[55:15] that he was the jesus he was the christ
[55:17] i knew that
[55:19] how do i end up
[55:21] here
[55:23] i'll tell you what i met many a man and
[55:25] woman my brother and sister in the
[55:26] travels the lord's allowed me to be on
[55:28] that was right there in that position
[55:30] and because the devil comes and blots
[55:32] the memory from these things they are
[55:35] sitting there believing it's all over
[55:36] they have just went over the line maybe
[55:38] i've blasphemed or i've just nope i
[55:40] don't got it but to have a reminder come
[55:43] to them and stir their heart and realize
[55:46] sometimes god's got to bring you
[55:48] to the black and white
[55:53] and then there's
[55:54] no place to turn it's the reality you're
[55:56] looking at yourself
[55:59] as it were in the negative of the word
[56:06] and so then
[56:08] the reality is there and
[56:11] you know my brother and sister it's not
[56:12] really about the test
[56:14] you know that
[56:15] any of you had any trials this week
[56:19] amen
[56:20] oh maybe it'd be easier
[56:22] any of you who haven't listened to your
[56:24] hand
[56:28] but you know it's not about the trial
[56:31] it's about how you respond to the trial
[56:35] i'm not in church today because oh i was
[56:38] such a terrible person no that's where
[56:40] we really should be
[56:41] the worst the trial and maybe let me
[56:43] just put in this context the worst your
[56:45] failure should be what motivates you
[56:48] to be in the house of god
[56:51] not the opposite see satan's got it like
[56:53] oh i was just such a terrible person now
[56:55] let me put it in this context of peter i
[56:57] curse this week
[56:58] [Music]
[57:00] i better just stay home and feel sorry
[57:01] for myself and wallow in my self-pity no
[57:04] you shouldn't no you shouldn't you
[57:06] should be right to the house of god you
[57:07] should be right in the presence of god
[57:09] because you see what's in you is the
[57:11] reason satan is fighting you
[57:14] if you were empty
[57:17] he wouldn't even bother you
[57:19] in fact you would just receive an email
[57:21] talking about your great promotion and
[57:24] the realtor would call and tell you that
[57:25] house you uh made an offer on the owner
[57:28] decided to sell it to you for just half
[57:30] as much money
[57:33] and then the phone call would be real
[57:35] when they said you've won a car
[57:38] you know sister jerry and i have won a
[57:39] ford explorer like 32 times in the last
[57:42] two weeks
[57:45] anybody else win a ford explorer this
[57:46] last few weeks
[57:48] yeah i'll tell you what i'm going to
[57:49] have so many florida ford explorers that
[57:52] church you know just don't be surprised
[57:54] when one shows up in your driveway
[57:57] because i've put my name in at a
[57:58] restaurant or someplace like that and
[58:02] and um i've won
[58:04] and i'm like man i tell you what i am
[58:06] getting old
[58:08] i haven't put my name
[58:10] into a drawing
[58:12] in 25 years
[58:15] and the last thing i won was actually
[58:17] because sister jerry wrote my name
[58:20] and dropped it in there and i said oh
[58:22] now don't take this anything more than
[58:24] just humor it was jerry's car
[58:27] that won it
[58:29] not my own
[58:31] but you see my brother and sister satan
[58:33] what does he want to do he wants to
[58:34] suppress you in any fashion he can
[58:37] he wants you to come to the place that
[58:38] you're like oh woe unto me and surely
[58:41] god wouldn't deal with me i couldn't
[58:42] come to the house of god today and god
[58:44] speak to me or i couldn't be a
[58:46] contributor today
[58:47] [Laughter]
[58:49] we just had a little uh conversation
[58:51] this morning in the restroom amen and um
[58:54] you know it it's just unique how satan
[58:57] is just so desperate that he can just
[59:00] cause all this stuff to try to hinder us
[59:02] but we're sons and daughters of god and
[59:04] you know what when we see that satan is
[59:07] trying to bring this to hinder us we we
[59:10] don't look at that we look beyond to the
[59:12] promise and we just say you know what i
[59:13] did this and this happened that happened
[59:15] but no problem i'm moving beyond that
[59:18] because that's not who i am and knowing
[59:20] that the circumstance that that is you
[59:22] see satan would rather now i know it's
[59:24] not you and it's not families like yours
[59:26] but satan would just love to cause
[59:29] almost every family if he could to have
[59:31] some kind of disagreement on the way to
[59:34] church
[59:36] isn't that amazing how that works
[59:39] now some of you are nodding your head so
[59:40] i don't know if you just agree with the
[59:42] theory or it's reality
[59:47] but jesus said these things would come
[59:48] to pass and it's now happening and
[59:50] remember from this last week that the
[59:53] words of the testator are of none effect
[59:56] until the death of the testator
[59:59] so we see now in the crucifixion we see
[1:00:02] that the words of the testator which is
[1:00:04] our lord jesus christ can now come into
[1:00:07] effect and they are amen so the word
[1:00:10] coming forth to show us that it will no
[1:00:12] longer be written on tablets of stone
[1:00:15] but he will ride it on the hearts of his
[1:00:17] sons and daughters of god and my brother
[1:00:19] and sister there is a lot of words that
[1:00:22] have been written there's a lot of
[1:00:23] things we can look at but we find the
[1:00:26] greatest value of words is when they
[1:00:29] have gone into effect in other words we
[1:00:31] can have this bible and we can place it
[1:00:34] in a prominent position in our life
[1:00:36] whether it be on the mantle of our home
[1:00:39] on the table a bedside a table whatever
[1:00:42] it might be but if the words of this
[1:00:45] book don't come alive and take effect in
[1:00:48] us then you will just be dusting it
[1:00:51] you will just be coming back to it over
[1:00:53] and over again dusting it but my brother
[1:00:56] and sister when the words of this book
[1:00:58] so many words and lots of words in this
[1:01:00] book and when they start to take effect
[1:01:02] in our life it is a slow gradual
[1:01:05] metamorphosis as it were that we are
[1:01:08] changing and changing and changing
[1:01:10] because it is taking effect upon us and
[1:01:14] so when things have come into effect my
[1:01:16] brother and sister that's when it starts
[1:01:19] to really change our life and what
[1:01:21] happened as we look at peter just
[1:01:23] briefly for a moment peter is right
[1:01:25] there peter
[1:01:27] needed to deny christ the third time
[1:01:31] peter needed to be accosted by a young
[1:01:33] woman who said aren't you one of them
[1:01:36] i'm sure you are peter needed to curse
[1:01:42] what you're saying a believer
[1:01:45] needed to curse
[1:01:48] yes a believer needed to curse
[1:01:52] because he had to come to the moment
[1:01:56] of face to face
[1:01:57] reality
[1:01:59] with the negative
[1:02:01] of peter the man
[1:02:03] and when he come face to face with that
[1:02:05] the scripture says he went off kid
[1:02:07] himself and wept bitterly
[1:02:10] you see that had never been an effect
[1:02:12] that took place in peter's life before
[1:02:15] but now there he is face to face he
[1:02:19] finds a place alone he's crying out to
[1:02:22] god and he's weeping bitterly and there
[1:02:24] was the catalyst that brought change in
[1:02:26] his life the prophet of god talked to us
[1:02:29] over and over again about cold formal
[1:02:32] religion dry eyed confessions
[1:02:36] were we just like oh lord i'm sorry
[1:02:39] my brother and sister that won't do it
[1:02:41] we've got to come to a place face to
[1:02:43] face with our negative to realize oh god
[1:02:47] something's got to change
[1:02:49] something's got to and oh lord let it be
[1:02:52] in me today don't let this day pass lord
[1:02:56] but what i can find a place and go and
[1:02:59] find in myself something crying out in
[1:03:02] such a
[1:03:03] fashion that we can say i found my place
[1:03:05] and i wept bitterly
[1:03:08] but unfortunately we find that we have
[1:03:10] become so sophisticated and refined and
[1:03:13] and we have so much as it were external
[1:03:15] knowledge that that we just believe by
[1:03:18] knowing what we know and attending where
[1:03:20] we attend and and hearing these things
[1:03:23] that we have it
[1:03:25] i tell you my brother and sister we have
[1:03:27] it when we have broke through the veil
[1:03:29] of human flesh
[1:03:30] when we have broke through the veil of
[1:03:32] human reasoning
[1:03:34] human affections
[1:03:36] all of these things when we break
[1:03:38] through that veil
[1:03:40] then those things can take place in our
[1:03:42] life and truly will be a changed person
[1:03:47] i say this morning young and old
[1:03:50] lord
[1:03:51] let the word have it's a full effect
[1:03:54] upon us today
[1:03:56] let us not walk out of church saying
[1:03:58] well uh you know he had me up to this
[1:04:00] point and i agreed until he got to this
[1:04:03] point of contention and i liked it until
[1:04:05] he went over this time
[1:04:09] my brother and sister
[1:04:13] we are so dominated
[1:04:16] by the human elements
[1:04:26] you know as we look back through the
[1:04:27] scripture we see that everyone had to
[1:04:29] have a lamb
[1:04:31] they come
[1:04:32] to offer their offering
[1:04:35] they couldn't come with an iou they
[1:04:36] couldn't come with a paper substitute
[1:04:40] they couldn't come with a word that says
[1:04:42] my priest says
[1:04:43] he's got it covered
[1:04:46] they had to have their lamb
[1:04:50] and so we see the lamb come see no one
[1:04:52] recognized it in that day
[1:04:55] the great scholars that had been brought
[1:04:57] and the word passed from age to age from
[1:04:59] father to son coming through in the
[1:05:01] levites it come and my brother and
[1:05:03] sister what happened in every passing as
[1:05:05] it were of the word it became more
[1:05:07] tradition there was certain word that
[1:05:09] they did not bother to fulfill there was
[1:05:11] certain word that they did not focus on
[1:05:13] but yet there were certain words that
[1:05:14] they focus so laser on them and as from
[1:05:18] generation to generation so much of the
[1:05:20] word
[1:05:21] escape them
[1:05:26] we've been somewhere
[1:05:27] depending on where you want to start
[1:05:30] from six
[1:05:33] seven eight generations
[1:05:36] are you with me
[1:05:39] there's some things we have such a laser
[1:05:41] focus on
[1:05:44] and there's
[1:05:46] some things
[1:05:47] we've allowed to be set to the wayside
[1:05:57] god help us
[1:05:59] this wasn't a book
[1:06:01] that god gave us to pick and choose
[1:06:02] through
[1:06:04] either that
[1:06:06] he is his own editor
[1:06:08] would have said in laodicea they won't
[1:06:10] need this
[1:06:12] and they won't need this
[1:06:14] and they won't even be listening to this
[1:06:17] no he left the book intact
[1:06:21] and then he spoke the word and said if
[1:06:23] you believe on me
[1:06:25] you'll believe on my word
[1:06:28] knowing that he himself was the word so
[1:06:30] you would believe on all of me
[1:06:32] amen not one portion of him
[1:06:36] but all of him
[1:06:40] you see we look now and realize that the
[1:06:42] crucifixion of our lord jesus christ
[1:06:44] as the scripture says now there in
[1:06:47] exodus as we're speaking upon the mercy
[1:06:50] seat and we cannot speak of the
[1:06:52] particulars at this time we cannot go
[1:06:54] into the details of the mercy seat at
[1:06:57] this time because you see the mercy seat
[1:07:00] there to them was as it were a physical
[1:07:03] object it was something that they knew
[1:07:06] that the presence of god was associated
[1:07:08] with the cherubims and it was above the
[1:07:11] ark and that was all well and good but i
[1:07:13] hope you don't misunderstand me today
[1:07:15] that almost come down to a point of idol
[1:07:18] worship
[1:07:20] it was all just formality
[1:07:24] now formality is not all that bad right
[1:07:27] because we don't come at 11 45 to church
[1:07:30] assuming we're going to participate in
[1:07:32] the service because the formality of our
[1:07:35] services it starts at 10 30.
[1:07:39] okay so we oftentimes get into well whoa
[1:07:42] we don't want any formality you know
[1:07:44] this is where people misunderstand they
[1:07:45] say well you know the prophet said he's
[1:07:47] against organized religion and so we
[1:07:50] don't go to a church because they start
[1:07:52] at this time and they do this and they
[1:07:54] do this and that's organized
[1:07:57] well hello
[1:08:01] yes sir
[1:08:03] do i go there is that rude
[1:08:06] i would say that it's disorganized
[1:08:08] religion
[1:08:09] when you're sitting here in your bunny
[1:08:11] slippers
[1:08:13] eating ice cream for breakfast listening
[1:08:15] to a tape and saying you're having
[1:08:17] church
[1:08:19] you're telling god i know you're just an
[1:08:21] informal god
[1:08:23] you're a god who don't care how i
[1:08:25] worship
[1:08:26] well let's go over here
[1:08:28] and let's listen now to god's chosen
[1:08:31] place of worship
[1:08:35] can't have it both ways saints
[1:08:43] so the blood of our lamb
[1:08:47] had to be upon the mercy
[1:08:50] we see the formality as it were my
[1:08:52] brother and sister placed out in exodus
[1:08:55] that the blood had to be sprinkled
[1:08:58] now once again the blood has had to be
[1:09:00] sprinkled
[1:09:01] but did you know that we can look back
[1:09:03] to calvary and say well his blood was
[1:09:05] sprinkled his blood was shed it was
[1:09:06] there
[1:09:07] you know it come down and and it was for
[1:09:10] us now brother brown says god
[1:09:13] jesus christ blood was not spilt because
[1:09:15] that denotes almost as though it was an
[1:09:18] accident knocked over but my brother and
[1:09:19] sister however you want to get formal
[1:09:21] about those words that blood was shed
[1:09:24] for you and i
[1:09:25] but did you know my brother and sister
[1:09:27] and you can study this all through the
[1:09:29] scriptures that we're coming down in
[1:09:31] another dispensation of the word and
[1:09:34] it's not us looking back to calvary and
[1:09:36] saying his blood was shed at calvary but
[1:09:39] it is the believer here today applying
[1:09:43] the blood himself
[1:09:50] because you can go to church all the
[1:09:51] days of your life and not have the blood
[1:09:54] shed over you
[1:09:56] not have the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:57] sprinkled over your life
[1:10:00] amen so it's something that we ourselves
[1:10:03] have to become a participant in
[1:10:06] we don't know well i go to church when
[1:10:08] we're believers we're this my parents i
[1:10:11] don't care you've got to shed
[1:10:13] take that shed blood of jesus christ and
[1:10:15] you've got to put it over yourself
[1:10:18] sorry for stumbling around this morning
[1:10:20] my mind is just racing off and i need to
[1:10:22] rein it in
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:25] so
[1:10:26] i say this morning lord i don't care
[1:10:28] what age we are let the word have its
[1:10:30] full effect
[1:10:31] so everyone had to have their lamb and
[1:10:34] and the blood of the lamb must be upon
[1:10:36] the mercy seat and and we look at this
[1:10:39] my brother and sister and realize that
[1:10:41] as the blood is readily available is it
[1:10:43] not
[1:10:44] we're not looking at something that's in
[1:10:46] limited supply covet did not shortchange
[1:10:48] its delivery
[1:10:52] hallelujah
[1:10:54] now and christ is god's provided lamb
[1:10:57] amen amen
[1:11:00] notice how appropriate was now showing
[1:11:02] that that jerusalem was ceasing
[1:11:05] in other words the significance of
[1:11:08] jerusalem to the believer was declining
[1:11:12] why because we're moving into a
[1:11:13] different dispensation we're moving into
[1:11:15] a different atonement as it were a
[1:11:17] different deal but the same one let me
[1:11:20] clarify the same one just different
[1:11:24] right
[1:11:27] when it was in effect until that hour
[1:11:29] the blood of the lamb was all right
[1:11:30] until that day so right to the day of
[1:11:34] the crucifixion the blood of the lamb
[1:11:37] natural being shed in the temple was
[1:11:40] sufficient
[1:11:42] but now at the crucifixion it changes
[1:11:45] the old system
[1:11:46] is done
[1:11:48] there was a new
[1:11:50] one and the lamb
[1:11:52] was at the sacrifice the lamb the
[1:11:55] sacrificial lamb was on the grounds it
[1:11:57] was presents what he's saying it was
[1:11:59] right there
[1:12:00] they were condemning and doing the very
[1:12:03] thing
[1:12:03] there they had to do
[1:12:08] my goodness saints
[1:12:10] we understand how this works
[1:12:13] people are going to do what they're
[1:12:14] going to do
[1:12:17] now
[1:12:18] i might say some things are a little
[1:12:20] dirt this morning but i just want you to
[1:12:21] know i love you amen i don't know if
[1:12:23] each one of you would really understand
[1:12:25] just how much i love you
[1:12:28] and i would hope that you wouldn't think
[1:12:29] that it's just like oh brother paul is
[1:12:31] fond of me and my family and so
[1:12:33] therefore he likes us and all as well
[1:12:35] i'm talking about as a son of god
[1:12:37] i look out and i see people that are
[1:12:39] striving people that are pressing to the
[1:12:41] mark of the high calling i see people
[1:12:43] that through thick and thin just keep
[1:12:45] trying
[1:12:47] and my heart is bound to your heart
[1:12:49] because that's my same story
[1:12:54] but you see
[1:12:56] people are gonna
[1:12:58] do
[1:12:59] what they're gonna do
[1:13:02] i've had a hard lesson
[1:13:04] learning that saints
[1:13:06] i have emotionally almost killed myself
[1:13:10] because i tried to convince people
[1:13:13] the direction they were going was not
[1:13:15] right can't you see this can't you see
[1:13:17] this can't you see this
[1:13:19] please look here
[1:13:21] only to have them even more bitterly
[1:13:24] reject what you bring
[1:13:27] now i don't want to become cynical
[1:13:30] man nobody wants a pastor that's cynical
[1:13:33] but i'll tell you i am coming to the
[1:13:35] point that i will give you
[1:13:37] what i feel god's laid upon my heart you
[1:13:39] do what you choose with it
[1:13:41] you'll either throw it in the dumpster
[1:13:43] or you'll eat it
[1:13:46] and that will be on your head not mine
[1:13:48] on your hands not mine
[1:13:50] amen because we're coming down to a
[1:13:52] season of the manifestation of what is
[1:13:55] really there our young people the other
[1:13:57] night i i really hope that they they
[1:13:59] they catch that i do believe they did
[1:14:02] you see i took them sorghum which was
[1:14:04] some bird seed that we had at the house
[1:14:06] i took sorghum i took a corn seed and i
[1:14:09] took a goat head now we all know what a
[1:14:11] goat head is right even our little ones
[1:14:13] are like yep i've stepped on them and
[1:14:15] that hurts
[1:14:17] and we got to talk about
[1:14:20] can we plant a goat head
[1:14:22] and come up with corn
[1:14:26] see i want to bring it down even saints
[1:14:28] to our youngest
[1:14:30] that they understand whatever seed they
[1:14:32] plant in their life
[1:14:33] whatever they allow to grow in their
[1:14:35] life is what's going to be produced in
[1:14:36] their life
[1:14:38] you cannot say well i go to church and
[1:14:40] call that the seed my brother and sister
[1:14:42] because the seed of discrepancy survives
[1:14:45] in the church
[1:14:47] so as we plant the right seed we get the
[1:14:50] right results
[1:14:54] the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the
[1:14:56] grounds they were condemning and doing
[1:14:57] the very thing there that they had to do
[1:15:00] that's right god be blessed for seeing
[1:15:02] this wonderful heavenly light in the
[1:15:04] last days look the prophet's telling you
[1:15:06] you're blessed god's allowed you to see
[1:15:08] these things here see the day we're
[1:15:10] living in you can see that and when you
[1:15:13] see that my brother and sister you can
[1:15:14] do something about it but if god never
[1:15:17] opened your eyes
[1:15:21] and you literally had to go ahead and
[1:15:22] thought you had something of value
[1:15:26] and you just kept on planting goat heads
[1:15:32] must have been god's fault our family
[1:15:34] fell apart
[1:15:36] well
[1:15:37] quit planting go-heads
[1:15:41] got pain in your family you've got pain
[1:15:42] in your own life quit planting goat
[1:15:45] heads
[1:15:49] because the church isn't doing the same
[1:15:51] thing today until the hour that
[1:15:52] organization religion is condemned and
[1:15:55] proved to be sacrificing christ's word
[1:15:58] now look i want you to catch this i
[1:16:00] think this
[1:16:01] this is very striking you need to really
[1:16:03] focus on this god be blessed for seeing
[1:16:05] this wonderful heavenly light in this
[1:16:07] last day because the churches is doing
[1:16:09] the same thing today amen
[1:16:12] so he's declaring this day
[1:16:15] same thing's taking place again
[1:16:17] and to the hour that organization
[1:16:20] religion or organized religion is
[1:16:22] condemned and proved to be sacrificing
[1:16:25] christ's word
[1:16:27] so we got a timeline locked right here
[1:16:29] that there is a time that it's going to
[1:16:31] be proven that they're actually
[1:16:33] sacrificing god's word
[1:16:36] for another program
[1:16:38] now i'm going to ask you just out out
[1:16:40] front is that not
[1:16:42] it's absolutely proven
[1:16:44] amen because it's interesting now i
[1:16:47] don't recommend you all go do this but
[1:16:49] it's interesting go do a little research
[1:16:51] and you'll find that this group here
[1:16:54] is condemning them
[1:16:56] for what they do
[1:16:58] and that group is condemning them for
[1:17:00] what they do and that group is
[1:17:02] condemning them for what they do and
[1:17:04] that group way down there is now
[1:17:05] condemning this one for what they do
[1:17:08] but what we see is the word of god said
[1:17:10] they're all in the same thing
[1:17:13] every one of them has compromised on the
[1:17:15] word of god and so for their form of the
[1:17:18] gospel they are now compromising or
[1:17:21] selling out the gospel to succeed at
[1:17:24] what they're doing i've joked about this
[1:17:26] and i haven't said anything about it for
[1:17:27] a long time but remember i received that
[1:17:29] deal
[1:17:30] inviting me to purchase a how to grow
[1:17:33] your church program for just like 695
[1:17:36] bucks a month you know they have you
[1:17:38] know eight ten of those lessons that
[1:17:40] guarantee that you can increase the the
[1:17:43] amount of people in your church miniful
[1:17:47] wow
[1:17:48] you know i wonder sometimes if i
[1:17:49] shouldn't have went ahead and subscribed
[1:17:51] to that
[1:17:56] but i realized it was self-defeating
[1:17:58] because over here is the word saying you
[1:17:59] know what i'm going to thin them out
[1:18:02] so they'll pay money to get more of the
[1:18:04] same spirit of what they got so you have
[1:18:07] a lot of people that are all compromised
[1:18:09] on the word of god and my brother and
[1:18:11] sister you don't need a lot of people
[1:18:12] that are compromised because i tell you
[1:18:14] i'd rather have one or two true
[1:18:16] believers than a whole building full of
[1:18:18] compromisers
[1:18:22] so they're doing the same thing until
[1:18:23] the our organization religion is
[1:18:25] condemned and proved to be sacrificing
[1:18:27] god's word from then on
[1:18:30] comes the word
[1:18:32] do you catch that and the word only amen
[1:18:34] so we got a season saints can i explain
[1:18:36] this for you i know you're all
[1:18:37] intelligent i don't i'm not speaking
[1:18:39] down to you but do you realize there is
[1:18:42] a time that all of this looked good
[1:18:45] all of this looked good and then there's
[1:18:46] a time that it was proven what they were
[1:18:50] doing and it was proved that they were
[1:18:52] actually sacrificing the word
[1:18:55] to fill the church up
[1:18:57] to have the money
[1:18:59] to build a bigger church
[1:19:01] to fill the church up
[1:19:03] to have the money
[1:19:05] to build a bigger church
[1:19:08] and they sacrificed the gospel
[1:19:11] to accomplish this goal
[1:19:15] hallelujah
[1:19:17] i hope this isn't too personal but
[1:19:19] sister jerry shared with me
[1:19:22] what was shared with her about a church
[1:19:24] there in kiev and
[1:19:25] how that it was just filled and they're
[1:19:27] actually sitting on the steps outside of
[1:19:29] the
[1:19:30] church
[1:19:32] and the pastor there was like to another
[1:19:34] brother what do we do
[1:19:36] you know we can't really afford another
[1:19:38] building we need another building and
[1:19:39] the pastor that give advice to a pastor
[1:19:42] a pastor giving advice to a pastor he
[1:19:44] says just wait
[1:19:46] strangely enough
[1:19:48] in the last while
[1:19:51] these went here
[1:19:53] these disagreed
[1:19:54] these quit serving god
[1:19:56] these did this now there's plenty of
[1:19:58] room in the church
[1:20:02] but there's something in the human
[1:20:03] element that says
[1:20:05] we want to fill this place up
[1:20:08] what we want
[1:20:11] is real gold
[1:20:13] what we want is real christians real
[1:20:15] believers
[1:20:17] that's what we're searching
[1:20:26] so after the time the awakening
[1:20:29] of the sacrificing of god's word
[1:20:32] then we see from then on comes the word
[1:20:35] and the word only
[1:20:36] what is it out of all of this there's a
[1:20:38] people that the word rings true to them
[1:20:40] and they're like i only want the word
[1:20:42] only want the word have you ever been to
[1:20:44] a restaurant
[1:20:46] and
[1:20:47] the minute you dug into your potatoes
[1:20:49] you're like wow they made these from
[1:20:51] real potatoes
[1:20:54] i mean you're eating them and you're
[1:20:56] like somebody has peeled a potato and
[1:20:58] boiled this thing and mashed him and
[1:21:01] served it to me
[1:21:03] and then you go to another restaurant
[1:21:05] and you're like
[1:21:06] wow i didn't know that potatoes tasted
[1:21:09] like tin cans
[1:21:12] now i want to ask you
[1:21:15] within your ability
[1:21:17] do you go get
[1:21:19] the tin can potatoes
[1:21:22] or do you go back
[1:21:24] and get the real
[1:21:26] my daddy used to teach me
[1:21:29] started farming started in business my
[1:21:31] daddy used to tell me son it only cost a
[1:21:34] dollar to go first class one more dollar
[1:21:37] just one extra dollar to go first class
[1:21:40] hallelujah well since we can settle for
[1:21:42] 10 canned potatoes
[1:21:45] or we can sacrifice just a little more
[1:21:47] and have the real thing
[1:21:49] we can settle for religion
[1:21:52] or for a little more we can have christ
[1:21:54] himself
[1:21:58] come on
[1:22:01] from the old paschal lamb passed away
[1:22:03] and christ became our lamb at the day of
[1:22:06] the crucifixion right there see the
[1:22:08] transition takes place right there and
[1:22:11] the day that the denomination crucified
[1:22:14] the word of god and accepted a creed in
[1:22:16] the stead of the word that's the day the
[1:22:19] word come into full effect
[1:22:21] and that's just been recently
[1:22:25] 1963
[1:22:27] that's just been recently so we're not
[1:22:29] looking back my brother and sisters
[1:22:31] sadducees and pharisees
[1:22:33] we're looking
[1:22:35] well
[1:22:36] you know it always amazes me i just like
[1:22:38] somebody the other day oh when was you
[1:22:40] born
[1:22:42] and i just like
[1:22:44] hear people saying oh
[1:22:46] 2001
[1:22:48] you're a child
[1:22:53] i mean i'd want to go back to you know
[1:22:55] the 40s or
[1:22:57] whatever but you just realize see what's
[1:22:59] happening is time is moving forward
[1:23:02] and i was a child
[1:23:04] of the 60s
[1:23:06] and so to me the 60s are not that far
[1:23:08] back
[1:23:10] and i talked to a young man one day and
[1:23:12] he said well sir if i could ask when was
[1:23:14] you born and i told him 1961 and he goes
[1:23:17] oh my grandpa talks about those days
[1:23:25] now look i say that i bring that to you
[1:23:27] maybe a little humor there but let's not
[1:23:29] look at the word that way oh my that was
[1:23:33] way back there we're of a more modern
[1:23:36] time
[1:23:37] no sir this word is enduring it's time
[1:23:40] tested it's just as powerful today as
[1:23:42] the day it was spoken amen it will
[1:23:44] fulfill everything that it declared in
[1:23:47] that day will be fulfilled in this day
[1:23:49] and we'll look right here you see when
[1:23:52] they compromise brother and sister
[1:23:54] that's when the bride of christ starts
[1:23:56] really hungering to get into the word so
[1:23:59] as they decline let me put it this way
[1:24:02] as they decline in their sincerity and
[1:24:05] when i'm not talking about enthusiasm
[1:24:07] because the prophet of god said they'll
[1:24:08] be really enthusiastic
[1:24:10] but i'm talking about in the sincerity
[1:24:12] from the depths of the heart as the
[1:24:14] worlds declined they went into program
[1:24:16] we have to have uh baseball teams
[1:24:18] basketball teams we have to have this
[1:24:19] program and that program and we're you
[1:24:22] know and we've got all kinds of programs
[1:24:24] and you'll see it on their banners and
[1:24:25] on their boards we have a new program
[1:24:27] for this a new program for that how
[1:24:28] about the program of preaching the
[1:24:30] gospel
[1:24:31] how about the program of eternal life
[1:24:33] how about the program of people hearing
[1:24:36] the word and being able to say amen
[1:24:38] that's the truth
[1:24:41] so as you see that coming to that day
[1:24:44] see that's the day that the word's going
[1:24:46] to come into full effect to the bride of
[1:24:47] jesus christ
[1:24:49] sons and daughters of god will be able
[1:24:50] to take the word in that day and be able
[1:24:52] to say praise the lord this word is
[1:24:55] effective
[1:24:59] you know speaking of the word i hope
[1:25:01] this isn't offensive to anybody
[1:25:04] but this covet vaccine is so effective
[1:25:06] they're talking about how you might need
[1:25:07] to take a third dose
[1:25:09] and if that don't work they might have
[1:25:10] to give you a fourth dose
[1:25:13] hallelujah
[1:25:15] how about just getting one dose and it
[1:25:17] being real
[1:25:18] how about we just get one dose of the
[1:25:20] holy ghost and it be real
[1:25:22] we don't have to have all kinds of this
[1:25:24] and all kinds of that i believe in
[1:25:26] special meetings and we've been kind of
[1:25:27] likes about those things for various
[1:25:29] reasons but my brother and sister if we
[1:25:32] have a revival experience then you'll
[1:25:35] continue to have to attend revival after
[1:25:37] revival after revival to keep the
[1:25:40] experience alive but what when you get
[1:25:42] the real experience you'll be able to go
[1:25:45] to the backside of the desert and come
[1:25:47] out of the backside of the desert just
[1:25:49] as filled with the holy ghost as when
[1:25:51] you went into the desert
[1:25:53] in fact you might come out with more
[1:25:54] because you will have got all the
[1:25:56] distraction of life done and god will be
[1:25:59] right there in your midst amen not this
[1:26:01] all you know i i had a reason i i
[1:26:03] couldn't be in church and and i backslid
[1:26:06] because i was in church something
[1:26:07] missing
[1:26:09] something missing something's wrong
[1:26:11] because it's not going to be that kind
[1:26:12] of experience do i believe you should be
[1:26:14] in the house of god yes i do because my
[1:26:16] bible says so
[1:26:17] hallelujah
[1:26:19] now you look at this and you know isn't
[1:26:22] that interesting
[1:26:24] it's in the message indictment
[1:26:30] what was they indicted for
[1:26:34] second that's
[1:26:36] see not even put out an indictment for
[1:26:38] the first crucifixion that had to take
[1:26:40] place
[1:26:43] but the second crucifixion would not
[1:26:45] have had to take place if they believed
[1:26:47] the word
[1:26:50] but they compromised the word
[1:26:52] and ultimately tradition
[1:26:55] we're a message church
[1:26:58] i like that oh brother chris i'm not
[1:26:59] picking on you please please believe me
[1:27:03] but i liked that
[1:27:05] we sing three songs and we have these
[1:27:07] unspoken requests and we have this thing
[1:27:10] here and we do it like this because we
[1:27:13] are a message church
[1:27:17] well how about we become a holy
[1:27:18] ghost-led church
[1:27:20] and if we happen to sing three songs and
[1:27:22] we happen to do this and we have to do
[1:27:24] that then so be it
[1:27:25] but let god be the guiding hand that we
[1:27:27] don't have to go look now this might go
[1:27:30] over wrong and people might hear this on
[1:27:32] the internet and i might get rebuffed
[1:27:33] for this but my brother and sister if we
[1:27:36] have to go look in church order to
[1:27:38] pattern a church service because we've
[1:27:41] got to know exactly what to do here and
[1:27:43] what to do here my brother and sister i
[1:27:45] think something's wrong where's the holy
[1:27:46] ghost
[1:27:48] now i'm not saying what the prophet of
[1:27:49] god said was out of line ignore it i'm
[1:27:51] talking about the fact that the holy
[1:27:53] ghost that led him to say those things
[1:27:55] should be the holy ghost that's leading
[1:27:57] us just naturally organically do we
[1:27:59] understand that organically just coming
[1:28:01] from within us to have a leadership that
[1:28:04] if we have one more now you guys are
[1:28:07] going to think i just whatever but i'm
[1:28:08] getting older and bolder and you can
[1:28:09] always you know retire me trade me and
[1:28:12] retread me
[1:28:16] but we were joking brother david the
[1:28:17] other night
[1:28:19] good humor honest humor fair not
[1:28:21] critical
[1:28:23] but the problem with a preacher leading
[1:28:25] songs
[1:28:29] why
[1:28:30] because
[1:28:32] he was created by god to find
[1:28:34] inspiration in all of these things
[1:28:37] that's what god made him for
[1:28:40] and so when he reads his song or
[1:28:42] something comes he's like okay now just
[1:28:44] a second we got a pause between songs
[1:28:46] here i've got to share this
[1:28:49] come on i hope you all find humor but
[1:28:50] david kind of smiled at me i hope he
[1:28:53] finds humor in this
[1:28:55] you see you can't help that why he's not
[1:28:58] trying to take your extra time or to
[1:29:00] take this hijack this service there's
[1:29:02] anointing
[1:29:04] and i just saw this and i've got to
[1:29:06] share this while it's fresh
[1:29:11] or we can go publish it in a little deal
[1:29:13] and send it out to all the preachers and
[1:29:16] and next month go ahead and preach on
[1:29:18] this
[1:29:20] no sir
[1:29:22] we are holy ghost-led people
[1:29:27] forgive me brother david for bringing
[1:29:28] that up i'm trying to break that habit
[1:29:31] but that's the thing see why under
[1:29:33] inspiration you want to share this thing
[1:29:36] that just blossomed before you
[1:29:39] amen so i'm not criticizing that at all
[1:29:42] i've done it way too many times myself
[1:29:45] now look at this
[1:29:46] see
[1:29:48] as we'll look in this my brother and
[1:29:50] sister as we'll look the lamb going back
[1:29:54] in the quote the lamb the sacrificial
[1:29:55] lamb was on the grounds they were
[1:29:57] condemning and doing the very thing that
[1:30:00] they had to do that's right why
[1:30:02] because the words of the testator
[1:30:06] had to come forth
[1:30:09] they had to kill the testator for the
[1:30:12] testimony of what was contained in the
[1:30:15] inheritance could be revealed to you and
[1:30:17] i
[1:30:18] otherwise it would remain
[1:30:20] locked up in the word amen it would be
[1:30:23] locked up in there and be a mystery to
[1:30:25] us but the scripture says in that day
[1:30:28] when the mystery of god would be
[1:30:30] fulfilled it is there that the words of
[1:30:33] the testator are unlocking our
[1:30:36] inheritance
[1:30:38] every single day another opening of the
[1:30:42] inheritance is coming to the bride of
[1:30:44] jesus christ she is seeing more clear
[1:30:48] who she is in jesus christ every single
[1:30:51] day
[1:30:53] and if they hadn't done what they were
[1:30:54] called to do then we would be today
[1:30:57] still locked up
[1:30:59] in that
[1:31:00] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:31:03] now i want to go back to 111 uh uh here
[1:31:06] uh see i kind of don't know that we
[1:31:09] really caught the revelation of this god
[1:31:11] be blessed
[1:31:13] for seeing this wonderful heavenly light
[1:31:17] in this last day
[1:31:19] we don't even we don't even grasp or
[1:31:21] have a
[1:31:22] a conscious
[1:31:24] understanding of how blessed we are and
[1:31:26] you say oh brother paul no i think we do
[1:31:28] i'm telling you i don't think you do
[1:31:31] i think if we really realized how
[1:31:34] blessed we are just simply to see the
[1:31:36] revealed or open word in the day that
[1:31:38] we're living you would find us as it
[1:31:41] were not necessarily physically but in
[1:31:43] the spiritual realm hopping and skipping
[1:31:45] down the street and we would see a
[1:31:47] situation and we just claim in the name
[1:31:48] of jesus christ we wouldn't give it a
[1:31:50] second thought i need healing lord they
[1:31:52] need healing we wouldn't even never
[1:31:53] thought you know sometimes i think that
[1:31:55] we just get and we labor and we labor
[1:31:57] and we're like i'm being faithful i'm
[1:31:58] praying for this need and the reason it
[1:32:00] comes that way is because we haven't
[1:32:02] really grasped
[1:32:04] that god heard you the first time amen
[1:32:07] now i believe on remembering things in
[1:32:09] prayer yes i do
[1:32:11] the word of god shows us to pray for
[1:32:13] life it doesn't say now you just enter
[1:32:14] your petition once
[1:32:17] but i'm talking about in the real
[1:32:18] context down in our heart right
[1:32:21] we're lacking that complete supreme
[1:32:23] confidence
[1:32:24] that as a son of god i claimed healing
[1:32:28] it's going to happen
[1:32:30] it's going to happen
[1:32:32] i don't have to fret i don't have to
[1:32:33] fuss
[1:32:34] but we prayed for so and so when they
[1:32:36] passed away god's perfect will be done
[1:32:39] amen
[1:32:40] but see we we kind of miss a little
[1:32:42] something in there i believe
[1:32:44] god help us
[1:32:46] and i don't say that offensive
[1:32:49] but we're living in an hour saints when
[1:32:51] the
[1:32:53] word of god is being sacrificed they're
[1:32:55] sacrificing christ's word
[1:32:59] now i'm going to bring this down in such
[1:33:01] a fashion i hope you can follow me here
[1:33:05] it's shocking to have someone say to you
[1:33:09] now i want you to understand brother
[1:33:11] paul
[1:33:13] the reason that we operate our church
[1:33:15] and preach like we do
[1:33:17] is because we are reaching out to the
[1:33:20] foolish virgin
[1:33:23] and we are doing our best to keep the
[1:33:26] foolish virgin
[1:33:28] in church
[1:33:35] this is not theoretical this is a real
[1:33:37] live conversation i had
[1:33:42] explaining why
[1:33:45] that they do not
[1:33:47] try to
[1:33:48] hold to some standards because
[1:33:51] the foolish virgin as we're sitting
[1:33:53] there having this conversation
[1:33:55] the man literally pointed to a young
[1:33:58] woman walking by
[1:34:00] and i'll get to how she was dressed in a
[1:34:02] few minutes
[1:34:04] but he points to a young woman walking
[1:34:05] by and says
[1:34:07] it's people like her
[1:34:10] we're trying to keep in church
[1:34:20] let's take a little poll
[1:34:23] how many think brother paul's a legalist
[1:34:27] have courage if you feel it lift your
[1:34:29] hand
[1:34:32] i don't believe i'm a legalist
[1:34:35] because the scripture says he has
[1:34:36] received mercy gives mercy amen
[1:34:40] i've received a lot of mercy in my life
[1:34:44] but you see if we
[1:34:46] start preaching
[1:34:49] the word of god the message of the hour
[1:34:51] into a fashion just to keep you coming
[1:34:53] back to church that's it
[1:34:56] can you honestly say i love you
[1:34:58] because all i care about is you coming
[1:35:00] to church
[1:35:03] you see it puts it in a place that the
[1:35:06] devil anoints this and i made this
[1:35:08] statement to you saints sometime back
[1:35:10] here
[1:35:11] it was very interesting because my wife
[1:35:14] was listening to another brother in the
[1:35:16] message
[1:35:17] and he spoke
[1:35:18] almost the exact words i believe it was
[1:35:21] on the same weekend would have been the
[1:35:23] same sunday
[1:35:24] far across the country
[1:35:26] i believe to me a little confirmation it
[1:35:28] wasn't man's thinking it's god's
[1:35:30] thinking
[1:35:31] but you see we're living in an hour
[1:35:33] people are sacrificing christ's word and
[1:35:36] so to hear a man say this is why we do
[1:35:38] what we do is because we're reaching out
[1:35:40] to the foolish virgin to keep them in
[1:35:43] church
[1:35:44] well let me tell you a little something
[1:35:45] just to inform you so you'll know where
[1:35:47] i stand today the reason we operate this
[1:35:50] church and preach as we do because we
[1:35:52] are reaching out to the bride of jesus
[1:35:54] christ
[1:35:55] i'm not trying to keep foolish virgin in
[1:35:58] church i pray if there's some in church
[1:35:59] that god deals with their hearts and
[1:36:02] changes them but my brother and sister
[1:36:04] we are reaching out my heart is not to
[1:36:07] convince someone who doesn't really want
[1:36:09] to serve god that it's in their best
[1:36:12] interest because they've already made a
[1:36:13] decision that they want to do what they
[1:36:15] want to do but i tell you i want to
[1:36:17] reach to the bride of christ amen i tell
[1:36:20] you what i want you to know the ones who
[1:36:23] can't i want to preach to the ones
[1:36:25] they're the ones that just can't wait to
[1:36:26] get in the house of god i'm going to
[1:36:29] preach to the ones that just can't wait
[1:36:31] to say amen to the word to the ones that
[1:36:33] say you know what i don't care what it
[1:36:35] cost me i'm going to live this those are
[1:36:38] the ones i want to preach to i want to
[1:36:40] preach to people that down in their
[1:36:42] heart when god starts to stir them
[1:36:44] they'll say i've heard the truth i know
[1:36:46] this is the truth
[1:36:48] hallelujah
[1:36:50] they'll say amen to the word and then do
[1:36:52] according to the word
[1:36:56] you see the bride's not expecting the
[1:36:58] word to be watered down to save their
[1:36:59] feelings
[1:37:06] god's on a mercy seat i'll just live any
[1:37:07] way i want and then i'll plead mercy
[1:37:10] no i'll tell you the word of god shows
[1:37:12] us how we live is just close to the word
[1:37:14] as we can live and when we make a
[1:37:16] mistake grace is not to keep us from
[1:37:20] disgrace grace is a safety net that
[1:37:23] catches you and i when we have done our
[1:37:25] best and we still fail
[1:37:28] that people say i can live anywhere
[1:37:30] please there's grace
[1:37:32] there's mercy
[1:37:33] my brother and sister that's foolish
[1:37:35] virgin thinking
[1:37:40] am i preaching too strong this morning
[1:37:42] amen
[1:37:45] the bride wants to hear the word like
[1:37:47] god had his prophet saying
[1:37:51] now i want you to buckle your seatbelts
[1:37:53] because this is something that's been in
[1:37:54] my heart for a long time
[1:37:56] i hope this does not offend anyone here
[1:38:01] but i can no longer just hold on to this
[1:38:03] and let it eat away up my heart i must
[1:38:04] speak on it amen
[1:38:06] young sisters
[1:38:09] old sisters
[1:38:10] you'll not find one place where the
[1:38:12] prophet condoned high heels that's
[1:38:15] exactly right
[1:38:17] i will say this strongly this morning
[1:38:19] i love every one of you i've seen him
[1:38:21] walk in this door i've seen him walk out
[1:38:23] this door i have seen him and it breaks
[1:38:25] my heart but you will not find one place
[1:38:28] in fact he speaks quite strongly and
[1:38:30] there's a dream involved interpretation
[1:38:32] of a dream my brother and sister this is
[1:38:35] not something that should come in the
[1:38:37] house of god
[1:38:38] we say we believe a message and then
[1:38:40] we'll do that well let's go ahead and
[1:38:42] just add a television or let's just go
[1:38:44] to the movies and let's just do this and
[1:38:45] do that you see if we're either going to
[1:38:48] believe the message preach the message
[1:38:51] leave the message or we are compromising
[1:38:53] the message
[1:38:55] now if that was too strong for our young
[1:38:56] people i want to ask you mothers why do
[1:38:58] you allow it to happen
[1:39:02] amen
[1:39:05] i'm not here to shame you i'm not
[1:39:06] shaming no one
[1:39:08] i love you enough
[1:39:09] i don't want to see you in satan's trap
[1:39:12] i don't want to see you just moving
[1:39:14] forward that's no big deal it's no big
[1:39:16] deal it's no big deal
[1:39:22] i'm not a legalist no sir
[1:39:32] not here to shame you i love you
[1:39:34] but i tell you what it's not love
[1:39:36] if i sit back and just let you go
[1:39:41] we're not lemmings
[1:39:44] we all know what livings are don't we
[1:39:48] them cute little furry things up there
[1:39:51] north slope of alaska
[1:39:53] little grass eating critters
[1:39:56] and one of them jumps off the cliff
[1:39:58] and the next one says
[1:40:00] what could it hurt
[1:40:03] and two jump off and
[1:40:05] three and five and ten
[1:40:08] a hundred
[1:40:11] but you know they live to recreate so
[1:40:13] there's some of them that either were
[1:40:14] too slow and got lost and said where'd
[1:40:16] everybody go
[1:40:19] or some of them have sense enough not to
[1:40:20] jump off the cliff
[1:40:24] right come on saints just because other
[1:40:26] message churches are going there we
[1:40:27] don't have to go there
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:31] young people young sisters that's right
[1:40:35] i'm going to look at my screen so i
[1:40:36] don't look directly at you so you won't
[1:40:38] think i'm picking on you yes you
[1:40:42] you
[1:40:44] but it's not love if you ignore it
[1:40:46] that's exactly right love is when we say
[1:40:49] look saints we're drifting this is
[1:40:50] coming into our church this is we're
[1:40:52] drifting in the wrong direction that's
[1:40:54] love
[1:40:57] because young young sisters young men
[1:40:59] too
[1:41:00] amen amen we can we can get now this
[1:41:03] might seem specific and i believe people
[1:41:05] will understand but we can turn into
[1:41:07] these shaggy looking dogs and we can
[1:41:09] come to church with pants with uh you
[1:41:12] know isn't this so cool
[1:41:14] if we had just gone on the leading edge
[1:41:16] of this thing through the years i could
[1:41:19] have provided hundreds of pairs
[1:41:22] of wore out jeans with holes in the
[1:41:25] knees and holes in the back pockets and
[1:41:27] now i could have got rich on this just
[1:41:28] my own
[1:41:30] instead they go down to the store and
[1:41:32] they gave 120 550 dollars
[1:41:36] what a bargain
[1:41:42] look saints let's
[1:41:43] let's go back young people i encourage
[1:41:46] you
[1:41:47] mothers families fathers i encourage you
[1:41:50] look at what we believe
[1:41:53] and just
[1:41:54] conform as it were i'm not talking about
[1:41:56] conforming like we're we're lemmings
[1:41:58] we're just going to conform but conform
[1:42:00] to the word of god
[1:42:05] because i tell you what i can't do
[1:42:08] i can't preach to this church like
[1:42:10] you're foolish virgin
[1:42:12] i can't preach to you like like hey you
[1:42:14] know god's going to just forgive us all
[1:42:17] because we had the message
[1:42:19] i can't do that
[1:42:23] you see i don't even want you in church
[1:42:25] you know that isn't that amazing i don't
[1:42:27] even want you in church
[1:42:29] i want you in christ
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:32] just getting in church won't solve the
[1:42:34] problem
[1:42:36] need to get you into christ
[1:42:38] and when we can put away all of our
[1:42:40] little things i'm guilty saints come on
[1:42:42] most of us i think i could say all of us
[1:42:44] are guilty of some form of distraction
[1:42:46] and then we can get through all of this
[1:42:48] stuff that satan's like oh i see this
[1:42:50] one they like books and man you'll be
[1:42:52] inundated with books and you have this
[1:42:54] and we have books online and we have
[1:42:56] free books at the library you know in
[1:42:57] that amazing library your whole life
[1:42:59] you've had to check them out now you
[1:43:00] walk in the library and they're like
[1:43:01] giving you a box take these
[1:43:07] why satan's anointed to distract you
[1:43:15] now i am going to be kind enough not to
[1:43:17] go into the whole dream and and uh
[1:43:19] vision and whatever of of the woman
[1:43:22] mincing in her high heels and falling
[1:43:23] off into the pits of hell
[1:43:25] but if we care enough and i'm going to
[1:43:26] put it this way here again remember
[1:43:28] brother paul loves you i love you enough
[1:43:30] to bring this to your attention amen you
[1:43:32] care enough to go read it
[1:43:34] it's there see it's satan's subtle
[1:43:43] anybody still love brother paul
[1:43:45] okay good good
[1:43:46] can i continue yes sir
[1:43:50] mighty gone unveiled before us
[1:43:52] now when jesus come he if he'd come with
[1:43:54] noah's message it wouldn't have worked
[1:43:57] build an ark and floated out it wouldn't
[1:43:58] have worked but what noah was a portion
[1:44:01] of god he acted a peculiar way because
[1:44:03] he was peculiar and his message was
[1:44:05] peculiar because it was the word being
[1:44:07] made manifest he could not have come
[1:44:10] with moses's message because it wouldn't
[1:44:12] have worked moses was god in a portion
[1:44:15] made manifest he was a word expressed
[1:44:17] for that hour but jesus could not have
[1:44:19] come in that the bible never said he
[1:44:22] would come in that way but when he come
[1:44:24] expressed exactly like the testament had
[1:44:28] said he would be expressed than all
[1:44:31] those who were redeemable amen
[1:44:34] amen
[1:44:36] all those that were redeemable believed
[1:44:38] it
[1:44:38] because they were the thoughts of god
[1:44:41] the attributes of him at the beginning
[1:44:42] was made flesh and redeemable and was
[1:44:45] brought back to god amen now look at
[1:44:49] this what is the title tells you a lot
[1:44:51] right here
[1:44:52] amen mighty god unveiled before us
[1:44:54] saints and that's the promise of our
[1:44:56] bibles in this day right there is that
[1:44:59] god once again would be unveiled before
[1:45:02] us as a people that we could see jesus
[1:45:06] christ clearly
[1:45:07] not through a glass darkly not not
[1:45:09] through some
[1:45:11] image of man's creation but to see it
[1:45:14] clearly
[1:45:17] as many as received him to them he gave
[1:45:19] the power to become sons of god because
[1:45:22] they were redeemable
[1:45:24] they were from the beginning in the
[1:45:26] expression if we could stop here a
[1:45:28] moment if it would be possible and think
[1:45:29] of that tonight of the message of the
[1:45:31] hour
[1:45:32] the express thoughts of jehovah before
[1:45:34] the foundation of the world we are told
[1:45:36] our names were put on the lamb's book of
[1:45:38] life do we amen amen we know that is a
[1:45:41] fact right that's scripture there we can
[1:45:43] see the two sides as i first said why
[1:45:46] one is odd to the other
[1:45:50] amen
[1:45:51] there you are
[1:45:52] is it because i'm odd
[1:45:54] you're odd
[1:45:56] no sir it's the two sides of looking at
[1:45:58] the gospel
[1:45:59] or if you could let me put it in these
[1:46:01] words at odds with one another
[1:46:06] i'll just share another thing that's
[1:46:08] been spoke to my face that caught me so
[1:46:10] off guard that i was shocked to hear
[1:46:15] you guys
[1:46:16] in your church
[1:46:18] are so arrogant
[1:46:21] you think you're so special
[1:46:26] yes i do yes i do yes i do
[1:46:30] i've been given the power
[1:46:32] to become sons and daughters of god
[1:46:36] god come down and said you're after my
[1:46:38] own thoughts you're after my own heart
[1:46:41] here is the power to walk in laodicea
[1:46:45] and live an overcoming life you don't
[1:46:48] have to have a compromised church to
[1:46:50] make you feel good you will strive to
[1:46:54] live and pursue the mark of the high
[1:46:57] calling
[1:46:58] hallelujah
[1:47:00] not being
[1:47:01] given the lemonade
[1:47:08] or do we want lemonade
[1:47:12] it actually does sound good right now
[1:47:17] no sir i don't want my
[1:47:19] gospel watered down
[1:47:23] because i tell you but
[1:47:25] if any of you feel like i've been a
[1:47:26] little hard this morning i want to tell
[1:47:28] you through the years
[1:47:30] people like that brother david dean
[1:47:31] heart have been so hard on me
[1:47:34] that i have felt crushed
[1:47:37] until
[1:47:39] the awakening
[1:47:42] and then i said thank you lord
[1:47:45] someone
[1:47:46] someone needed
[1:47:48] to help me get set straight
[1:47:51] i remember many years ago stopping
[1:47:54] i don't know i'm always confused brother
[1:47:56] david the church was in show low pine
[1:47:58] top so
[1:48:02] i remember stopping through in the
[1:48:03] church down in arizona in the semi
[1:48:06] happy to be there
[1:48:08] i go to church i go in
[1:48:10] my i was even brave enough to get up
[1:48:12] like even the second row
[1:48:15] and man i tell you what by the time the
[1:48:18] service is over
[1:48:20] i wished i'd sit on the back row
[1:48:25] because every trial i had been going
[1:48:28] through
[1:48:30] got preached on
[1:48:32] and i thought that's just not fair
[1:48:36] he's picking on me
[1:48:38] and then a voice says well how did he
[1:48:40] know
[1:48:44] yeah right
[1:48:47] that's right
[1:48:49] but there's technology
[1:48:54] our technology is called the holy ghost
[1:48:58] that's a technology that sits in your
[1:49:00] kitchen your living room maybe even your
[1:49:02] bedroom or your automobile
[1:49:05] that's the technology that god uses in
[1:49:07] this hour
[1:49:09] and he comes down and says you know what
[1:49:10] i need to confirm that in their heart
[1:49:13] or i need to correct them they're headed
[1:49:14] the wrong direction i need i'll just
[1:49:17] let this man look foolish
[1:49:20] but he'll speak it
[1:49:22] and the bride not a foolish virgin
[1:49:25] foolish virgin's going to be like the
[1:49:27] preacher's picking on me again
[1:49:30] and we gave thirty five hundred dollars
[1:49:31] in ties last month i just don't think he
[1:49:33] should be able to do that
[1:49:36] so then over coffee
[1:49:38] you know you're just really making my
[1:49:39] family feel bad and
[1:49:41] then oh well i don't want to do that
[1:49:46] well i don't want to make you feel bad
[1:49:48] either
[1:49:49] but the holy ghost will speak to you if
[1:49:51] you will listen
[1:49:54] if you will listen the holy ghost will
[1:49:56] speak to you
[1:50:03] okay i better hurry along here this is
[1:50:06] you know i'm gonna have to make this two
[1:50:07] parts
[1:50:09] and brother chris will preach to you
[1:50:10] next sunday so it might be a little
[1:50:12] while we'll get to it
[1:50:14] we can see
[1:50:15] two sides as i first said why one is odd
[1:50:18] to the other it must be that way it was
[1:50:20] always always been that way it will
[1:50:21] always be that way he was the word and
[1:50:23] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:50:25] us now god in back in the days of the
[1:50:28] old testament we find that after he had
[1:50:30] appeared to his people in different
[1:50:32] forms he veiled himself behind you
[1:50:38] oh i miss i misread that
[1:50:40] behind old
[1:50:42] badgers
[1:50:44] oh wait
[1:50:45] the badger skin i'll get this right i'll
[1:50:47] get this right i didn't call you a bunch
[1:50:49] of old badgers
[1:50:52] he veiled himself behind old badger
[1:50:54] skins god hiding behind badger skins
[1:50:58] what does it say right there in that
[1:50:59] last line
[1:51:01] at his mercy seat
[1:51:04] hallelujah so he's not dwelling behind a
[1:51:07] badger skin out here in a far off galaxy
[1:51:11] my brother and sister he's dwelling
[1:51:14] right here at his mercy seat
[1:51:20] and i'll tell you there ain't no one of
[1:51:21] us should be able to honestly say i
[1:51:24] haven't acted like a badger
[1:51:28] hallelujah
[1:51:30] oh my
[1:51:34] we find that how that solomon when he
[1:51:37] dedicated the temple of the lord and
[1:51:39] these badger skins was hanging there the
[1:51:41] veil how that he came in as the pillar
[1:51:43] of fire and as a cloud and went down
[1:51:45] behind there and veiled himself to the
[1:51:47] outside world
[1:51:49] do you see it
[1:51:50] you see it he's behind the badger skin
[1:51:53] still
[1:51:53] veiling himself
[1:51:55] to the outside world
[1:51:57] but by faith israel knew that he was
[1:51:59] back there
[1:52:00] they knew he was there regardless of
[1:52:02] what any of the heathen worlds had to
[1:52:04] say i say amen to that because the world
[1:52:07] says we're not even sure there is a god
[1:52:09] we've tried so hard to prove that
[1:52:11] there's a god and we can't even prove
[1:52:13] there's a god
[1:52:14] what about this and what about this
[1:52:17] circumstantial
[1:52:20] reactions to exterior
[1:52:23] inputs or impulses
[1:52:27] well
[1:52:28] hallelujah i'm moved by exterior
[1:52:32] impulses
[1:52:34] hallelujah
[1:52:36] christ in me on me around me
[1:52:39] moving me
[1:52:41] hallelujah
[1:52:43] oh the prophet said science would prove
[1:52:45] god was real
[1:52:48] there was
[1:52:50] regards what any of the heathen worlds
[1:52:52] had to say he was hid from the
[1:52:53] unbeliever
[1:52:55] but the believer by faith knew he was
[1:52:56] back there they
[1:52:59] had mercy
[1:53:00] oh i want mercy god have mercy on me
[1:53:03] and he was at his mercy seat which was a
[1:53:06] great secret
[1:53:08] and i'm telling you it obviously still
[1:53:10] is
[1:53:12] it's still a great secret today
[1:53:17] you know in the old testament to enter
[1:53:19] behind that skin was death now to stay
[1:53:22] from behind it is death
[1:53:25] so then
[1:53:26] to enter into his glory was death now to
[1:53:29] stay away from his glory is death that
[1:53:32] happened of course at the renting of the
[1:53:35] veil at calvary that's why i use the
[1:53:38] scripture that i used to open the
[1:53:40] service right there it was all about in
[1:53:42] a symbol form the renting of the veil
[1:53:46] was to now come down from a physical
[1:53:50] outer element to an internal spiritual
[1:53:53] element that the veil that separates you
[1:53:56] as a man or a woman from the presence of
[1:53:59] god has been broken it's not external
[1:54:02] it's right here and sometimes it's when
[1:54:05] god comes down and breaks the veil of
[1:54:07] our self-will of our desires of our
[1:54:10] stubborn spirits when he breaks the will
[1:54:12] of our humanness and it is rent that we
[1:54:15] can come into the presence of god
[1:54:18] but as long as we hold on to temper and
[1:54:20] self and opinion and emotion and all of
[1:54:23] these things your veil will stay in
[1:54:25] place
[1:54:26] oh god rend our veil today
[1:54:28] oh god we're in the veil of my heart
[1:54:30] today lord that you can have free access
[1:54:33] into my soul and that i can have free
[1:54:35] access into your presence
[1:54:38] hallelujah
[1:54:40] hallelujah when the veil was rent the
[1:54:42] old bill veiled
[1:54:44] now to stay out of his presence as death
[1:54:46] then to enter his presence with death
[1:54:48] amen look at this now
[1:54:51] keep going here real quick see it
[1:54:53] changes back and forth you must find the
[1:54:54] scripture to see what day we're living
[1:54:56] in now when the veil was rented at
[1:54:58] calvary the mercy seat
[1:55:00] came into plain
[1:55:01] view amen okay now it might not be
[1:55:05] anybody that's had influence over you
[1:55:06] and it might not be any realm you
[1:55:08] operate in but there's people right
[1:55:10] around us
[1:55:11] that will tell you
[1:55:13] that god's either on the mercy seat
[1:55:15] or he's here with us but he can't be
[1:55:18] both
[1:55:22] now i want to ask you this is kind of
[1:55:24] blunt
[1:55:25] and probably in the future i'm just
[1:55:27] going to be preaching blunt to you okay
[1:55:29] and i don't want you to and i don't
[1:55:31] expect you to but if you ever need to
[1:55:32] trade me on somebody else that preaches
[1:55:34] a little nicer to you that's fine too
[1:55:37] because i want to see you in rapture
[1:55:39] i don't want to see you in church i want
[1:55:41] to see you in the presence of god
[1:55:43] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:55:44] sister when you have people that can't
[1:55:46] take and claim they believe this and
[1:55:48] they can't take this and realize that
[1:55:51] the word has been made in plain view to
[1:55:54] the believer they are doing something to
[1:55:57] hold you out of the presence of god
[1:55:59] whether intentional or unintentional
[1:56:02] they are creating an atmosphere to keep
[1:56:05] you from entering in because maybe
[1:56:09] just maybe
[1:56:10] they're actually themselves afraid
[1:56:13] to come into the presence of god
[1:56:16] and the scripture says they themselves
[1:56:18] will not go through the door
[1:56:20] but won't allow you to either
[1:56:25] don't let it happen saints
[1:56:27] god's on the mercy seat
[1:56:30] god's on his mercy seat
[1:56:32] hallelujah
[1:56:35] he was hanging a calorie dripping in
[1:56:36] blood
[1:56:38] there was the mercy christ himself in
[1:56:40] you
[1:56:41] and they had took blood year after year
[1:56:43] at the cleaning of the sanctuary and
[1:56:44] sprinkled the mercy seat there god with
[1:56:46] his great mighty stroke of lightning
[1:56:48] power split the old badger veil
[1:56:51] of paul haley
[1:56:53] from top to bottom
[1:56:56] and the mercy seat
[1:56:58] christ in me
[1:57:00] came in to plain view
[1:57:03] the real genuine lamb of god was hanging
[1:57:05] in plain view on calvary the real mercy
[1:57:07] seat when god had paid the price himself
[1:57:11] and become one of us and had manifested
[1:57:13] himself as a man to get acquainted with
[1:57:16] us and we to be appointed with him
[1:57:19] oh my
[1:57:22] problem is some of us have this
[1:57:23] conversation with him
[1:57:25] one time every two or three months or
[1:57:27] whenever communion comes and the
[1:57:29] conversation usually sounds something
[1:57:31] like
[1:57:32] oh lord i'm going to be taking communion
[1:57:34] forgive me for all the terrible things i
[1:57:36] did is that communion
[1:57:39] no no sir that sounds like catholic
[1:57:41] confession
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:44] communion
[1:57:46] is a day
[1:57:48] by day
[1:57:49] conversation
[1:57:51] with jesus christ
[1:57:59] i mean i guess it would be quite
[1:58:00] interesting i'm not mocking what the
[1:58:02] catholics do don't misunderstand me but
[1:58:04] it might be quite interesting to sit in
[1:58:05] a booth and have people tell you about
[1:58:07] all the terrible things they did
[1:58:10] maybe a guy could record it and write a
[1:58:12] book
[1:58:14] probably be a bestseller
[1:58:16] well they say truth is stranger than
[1:58:18] fiction
[1:58:20] come on saints
[1:58:22] we've been given the opportunity to have
[1:58:23] communion with jesus christ every single
[1:58:26] day of our lives
[1:58:28] hallelujah amen
[1:58:30] oh
[1:58:32] sorry i don't mean to sound flip it
[1:58:35] lord just check my heart there i
[1:58:36] honestly don't
[1:58:38] to get according to us and we appointed
[1:58:40] with him the mercy seat was in plain
[1:58:42] view of all israel on that day of
[1:58:43] atonement amen now look this is a really
[1:58:46] long quote so i hope you're not
[1:58:48] i mean really long quote but last the
[1:58:51] tradition of the church fathers in that
[1:58:54] day had by their traditions veiled the
[1:58:56] true mercy seat from the people
[1:58:58] now remember
[1:59:00] the bible says these spirits never die
[1:59:04] so there's a spirit on the earth today
[1:59:06] that's trying to veil you
[1:59:09] come on can you
[1:59:11] fail you
[1:59:12] block you
[1:59:13] from seeing the mercy
[1:59:16] block you from seeing christ in your own
[1:59:18] life
[1:59:20] what does he do
[1:59:21] he gives us music he gives us clothes he
[1:59:23] gives us friends he gives us this that
[1:59:25] you just go right down the list
[1:59:28] what's he doing
[1:59:29] he's not blessing you he's blocking you
[1:59:32] right now
[1:59:33] people are like well the lord blessed me
[1:59:34] so good my job keeps me out of church i
[1:59:36] never go to church anymore but hey you
[1:59:38] know god gave me the job what can i say
[1:59:41] no sir that's the devil blocking it
[1:59:51] you know i'm sorry i don't mean to sound
[1:59:52] flippant this morning saints honestly i
[1:59:54] don't
[1:59:55] but my bible says
[1:59:59] let me just tell you what it doesn't say
[2:00:03] it doesn't say
[2:00:07] if you have this and you have that
[2:00:09] and you have a good job and you have a
[2:00:10] boat and you have a cabin and you have
[2:00:12] an airplane and you have a and you have
[2:00:13] and you have
[2:00:15] then you don't have to go to church you
[2:00:16] can forsake the assembly
[2:00:18] that's what my bible doesn't say
[2:00:22] what my bible does say is not to forsake
[2:00:25] the assembly of ourselves together amen
[2:00:28] but you see satan throws these things
[2:00:30] out
[2:00:32] of the world
[2:00:37] oh my
[2:00:39] the old testament prophecy would have
[2:00:41] been fulfilled and it was oh no wrong
[2:00:43] place if they would have known the
[2:00:45] scripture each piece would have come
[2:00:47] like the chinese tag
[2:00:48] the old testament prophecy would have
[2:00:51] been fulfilled and it was and if they
[2:00:53] had been taught
[2:00:56] the scripture
[2:00:58] they would have seen the mercy see
[2:01:01] come on saints this is where both paul's
[2:01:03] out i hope i hope you guys are good with
[2:01:04] this i hope that today you you have
[2:01:06] caught the vein of where i'm at see i'm
[2:01:08] not here just to hold you and keep you
[2:01:10] forever and just badger you
[2:01:13] after all it is my nature because i'm a
[2:01:15] badger i've got badger skin so therefore
[2:01:17] i must be a badger and must have the
[2:01:18] nature of a badger but i'm not here to
[2:01:20] badger you
[2:01:24] what is it
[2:01:27] so that we can see
[2:01:29] the mercy seat is of the halogen
[2:01:32] mercy seat is right here for you and i
[2:01:34] we don't need a certain preacher we
[2:01:35] don't need a certain church we don't
[2:01:37] need some certain program the mercy seat
[2:01:40] is right here and if they've been taught
[2:01:42] the scripture
[2:01:43] that's why it's so important that we go
[2:01:45] back and we anchor everything and to
[2:01:48] have people here again i'm being blunt
[2:01:50] and i'm sorry but when you have people
[2:01:52] say the message
[2:01:55] is my absolute
[2:01:57] not talking about the bible
[2:01:59] i'm talking about 1200 sermons
[2:02:02] is there absolutely
[2:02:05] in those 1200 sermons you will not find
[2:02:07] any word
[2:02:08] regarding that being the absolute
[2:02:11] right but in there i can find you
[2:02:13] multiple multiple places talking about
[2:02:16] the bible the word of god
[2:02:18] is our absolute amen
[2:02:20] come on let's not cut a corner
[2:02:22] let's not try to create a new vision or
[2:02:25] a new a new deal you know they wanted to
[2:02:27] carry the ark on a cart because they
[2:02:29] didn't have anybody really qualified
[2:02:35] oh no brother david they didn't the
[2:02:36] fivefold ministry was shot it was full
[2:02:38] of all kinds of problems they had caused
[2:02:40] the levites had caused every problem in
[2:02:42] israel the levites had actually come
[2:02:44] into all these israelites houses and set
[2:02:46] up idols on their mantles and the the
[2:02:49] the priests you know had come and and
[2:02:51] caused the people to dress and act and
[2:02:53] turn into drunks and chase women and
[2:02:54] whatever else it was the levites did all
[2:02:56] that
[2:03:02] and according to some they're still
[2:03:03] doing that
[2:03:07] see if they talk been taught the
[2:03:08] scripture they have seen the mercy seat
[2:03:10] so that tells me in the day we're living
[2:03:12] a lot of people aren't being taught the
[2:03:13] scripture
[2:03:17] oh my lord help me
[2:03:19] you know what sister emmy come
[2:03:21] just come
[2:03:23] lord says this is good this is good as
[2:03:26] moses said to do this day their veil is
[2:03:28] still over their hearts they don't see
[2:03:30] it but he was god the suffering and the
[2:03:32] atonement he was a genuine mercy
[2:03:34] standing in full view as we sang to him
[2:03:37] lo behold him in plain view there he is
[2:03:39] the mighty conqueror since he rent the
[2:03:41] veil into
[2:03:43] see he come the mercy seat hanging in
[2:03:45] clear view of the congregation but them
[2:03:47] being under
[2:03:48] popular
[2:03:50] opinion
[2:03:51] now men and women and delegates of this
[2:03:53] convention i want to say this without
[2:03:56] respect of person but in the view of
[2:03:58] today and view of what we're here for
[2:04:01] today i'm afraid that the traditions of
[2:04:03] the fathers church fathers has hid this
[2:04:05] from too many people
[2:04:07] and since the holy ghost has come in the
[2:04:08] last days as prophesied the veil has
[2:04:10] been rent
[2:04:11] too many people try to hang to their
[2:04:13] tradition of the fathers
[2:04:15] and that's why they can't see this
[2:04:17] extreme joy peace and things that the
[2:04:19] church has today
[2:04:20] yet
[2:04:22] it's in plain view to those who believe
[2:04:25] he hid the word
[2:04:27] the promised word of this day
[2:04:30] oh my
[2:04:34] oh my
[2:04:36] oh my
[2:04:39] praise the lord
[2:04:40] well hallelujah
[2:04:43] i'll just have to share the rest of this
[2:04:44] another time or maybe the lord just
[2:04:46] thought it was good
[2:04:48] i do want to share one last scripture
[2:04:52] because this scripture to me
[2:04:55] i made reference to it but i one of
[2:04:57] these days here i'm going to be going to
[2:04:58] preach what's on my heart here
[2:05:00] psalms 124 i think this should be a
[2:05:03] psalm of praise to us
[2:05:06] a song the degrees of david if it had
[2:05:09] not been the lord who was on our side
[2:05:12] now may israel say
[2:05:14] if it had not been the lord who was on
[2:05:16] our side when men rose up against us
[2:05:19] then they had swallowed us up quick
[2:05:22] when their wrath was kindled against us
[2:05:25] then the waters had overwhelmed us the
[2:05:27] street stream had gone over our soul
[2:05:29] then the proud waters had gone over our
[2:05:31] soul blessed be the lord who hath not
[2:05:34] given us as prey to their teeth
[2:05:38] our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[2:05:40] snare of the fowlers the snare is broken
[2:05:44] and we are escaped
[2:05:47] hallelujah our help is in the name of
[2:05:49] the lord who made heaven and earth
[2:05:53] and if it had not been
[2:05:55] for the lord
[2:05:57] we would be the prisoners of laodicea
[2:06:01] but we have escaped
[2:06:03] from the snare
[2:06:05] of satan
[2:06:06] oh hallelujah
[2:06:08] oh my
[2:06:10] thanks you're gonna have to pray for me
[2:06:11] i keep saying lord i just gotta cut this
[2:06:13] down and be like you know some of these
[2:06:15] ministers that we have that just really
[2:06:17] lay it out but
