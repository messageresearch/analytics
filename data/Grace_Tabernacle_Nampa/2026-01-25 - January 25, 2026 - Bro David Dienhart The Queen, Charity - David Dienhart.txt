TRANSCRIPT
========================================
mentally, emotionally, Lord, whatever it may be, in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthians 13, beginning with verse one. Though I speak with the tongue of men and angels, I'm going to give you my before I go farther here, I want to give you my subject, a title. The Queen Charity. That sounds strange, doesn't it? Sound like I'm calling this queen by a name. Well, it's not a name. It's her position. This the queen of Christ of of God. Charity. Though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and have though I have all faith, see notice the gift can be placed in an individual and not even know the Lord. Did you know that? You know, the first Corinthians said that the prophet said, "I wish that I could say these gifts meant that you had the Holy Ghost, but it's not the evidence." And yet, the gifts are working by the Holy Spirit. They're gifts of the Holy Spirit and God working. Amen. So, we never put we never want to put a an as an evidence or as a as a measure that we have the Holy Ghost in us because we have a gift. I can preach. I can have the gift to preach the gospel anointed like a house of fire and go to hell. &gt;&gt; Unless that seed's down in that soul. And when that water of the word for the hour and time goes forth, the Holy Spirit speaking, &gt;&gt; unless that anoints that seed, you won't be there. &gt;&gt; Because it has to be the word living. So let's remember that. So it's so though and though I have the gift verse two of prophecy and it's a true gift and understand all mysteries have have knowledge and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned, what my what works? Give my body to burn and bestow my goods to feed the poor. Nothing wrong with that. We all believe in that. And have not charity, it profitth me nothing. Charity suffereth long. This is what charity does. Charity is an action. Charity suffereth long and is kind. Charity envieth not. Charity vaunteth not itself. Is not puffed up. Does not behave itself unseemingly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, and thinkketh thinkketh no evil. rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoicth in the truth. Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth. Let's turn to first Corinthians 14. I'm sorry, not 1 Corinthians 14. 1 Corinthians 2:14. I had that written down wrong. 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse14. I'll start with let well let me I'll read verse 14 and through 16. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned. What's that spiritual discern mean? It means the Holy Ghost that wrote this word has got to be in you discerning it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without that, you're just a natural man. You're not born again. All right. Then it goes over here to verse 15. But he that is spiritual, see there it is. How what makes you spiritual? Because you feel good, because you have sensations, you can shout, you can cast out devils? No. None of that. Because you have the Holy Ghost that wrote the word in you recognizing the word. Amen. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things. Other words, there's discernment. Yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. Let me read it again. But we have. Is there any we here? &gt;&gt; But we have the mind of Christ. All right. Then I want to take verse 12 and 13 of that chapter. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God. That's just what we just read. There's the reason we've received the spirit which is of God that we might know. And that know is not imagined. That no is not I hope so. That no is faith. a revelation of the truth &gt;&gt; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which things also we speak. So there's a speaking. We have a message. Who's the final voice? There's a final voice in the world. Again, the world's going to hear direct from God. Who are they going to hear it from? &gt;&gt; Prophesy again. John, prophesy again. Speak. It's speaking. Prophecy is speaking. Prophesy. The voice is the voice of a of the anointed, vindicated prophet with the message of the hour. The voice is the message of the hour. The voice is God's voice. Which things we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, &gt;&gt; but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth. comparing spiritual things with spiritual. Amen. Search it by the word. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. Amen. James chapter 1. And then I'll have you be seated. James chapter 1. Verse 22. But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if we be a hearer of the word and not a doer, it's like a man beholding his natural face. Watch what the natural will do. beholding the natural face in a mirror in a glass that's a mirror even can that natural that natural can look in the mirror is he brother Paul's making a point here looking in the mirror he sees himself but what about looking into the mirror of the word not being born again what are you gonna see you're gonna forget because nothing's there to hold you so watch he said, "So he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forggetth what manner of man he was." What's the word telling you? What manner of man you are. But without the Holy Spirit, you can't discern what the mirror's telling you. And you're going to forget, go away and forget what manner of person you are. But let the Holy Ghost be in there and you see yourself. You're not going to be. Then it goes on to say, "But who so lookth into the perfect law of liberty and continuth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, that man shall be blessed in his deed." God bless his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. We kind of laid a foundation there. Charity is not a feeling. They can have feeling with it. But charity identified is not a feeling. &gt;&gt; Charity is not an imagination or a sensation. &gt;&gt; Charity is God himself. &gt;&gt; Charity is the person Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what charity is. Charity is a person. Christ is the person Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what charity is. There's no greater. There's no greater than charity. No greater love. No, that cannot fail. &gt;&gt; All right. So, Galatians, let's turn to Galatians. There's scriptures I want you to turn with me and follow. Galatians chapter 5. We could read a lot of scripture here, but we're just make hitting the high points. Verse five, for verse six, excuse me. Let's go to verse five. For we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision avaleth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which workketh by love. &gt;&gt; All right. So, how does how does love work? &gt;&gt; By faith. &gt;&gt; So, who's faith? &gt;&gt; I'll get into that in just a moment. So we find here in this that royal blood shows itself. The prophet said royal blood &gt;&gt; shows itself. Now we can take that natural and spiritual. What about the spiritual? Royal blood in the natural will show itself. &gt;&gt; You know there's something different about that person. The way they carry themselves, the way they the way they receive the the act they speak, &gt;&gt; their royalty. There's a certain demeanor and a character about a royal individual, a royal person, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Whether queen, king. Okay. What about the spiritual side of it? Okay. So, royal blood. And there is a royal seed today, which is a royal bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that royal blood shows itself. I just read it. How does it show itself? How does that royal blood show itself? By faith. Through love. Or excuse me, by love. through faith because love works &gt;&gt; love faith works by love. So you're going to find that by love. You see we're not talking here again. We're not we're talking about this perfect love we're talking about is love and action. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's love and action. It's love projected. Yeah, &gt;&gt; your life is projecting that love. It's love projected. This is not an artificial love. This is not, you know, we have an AI everywhere we go. We even have AI animals. Now, &gt;&gt; can you imagine having something you say it loves me and it's artificial? There's a lot of artificial Christians today. There's a lot of artificial love today, too. There's a lot of makeup, workup, and artificial. It's all artificial. It's not genuine. But what we're speaking about here is divine love, perfect love, God's own love in action and projected. This is not an artificial love. It's real and can't a and and can't fail. It's eternal. &gt;&gt; This love we're talking about, this charity is eternal. Amen. It's eternal. Praise be to the Lord. And so we we can go over here and we'll find here as I just coming down the line right here. Now I want to go to a a message unveiling of God. He said, "And as a Christian, I'm identified with him." Amen. As a Christian, you've got to have an identification. As a Christian, you are identified. You are either identified with him or not identified. Brother, sister, I believe in feelings, but don't you put any evidence of the Holy Ghost dwelling in you because how you feel. &gt;&gt; I have no confidence in this outer man. We can't have confidence in it. There's got to one one thing we have confidence in, and that's our head, which is the word. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing you can have confidence in in this hour right now. We've got to have the real. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If we have all this artificial AI, artificial this, artificial this, artificial intelligence, then we also have a real intelligence here. Or there could never be an artificial one. &gt;&gt; There could never be an artificial anything without the real. &gt;&gt; So in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. That's original. Amen. &gt;&gt; You add to that or take away that original, you have nothing but artificial. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You have a perversion. You have you have something hybrid. We don't want hybrid. This message is not a hybrid message. This is message has been vindicated by God to be God's own perfect interpretation of the word for this hour. We have we have I could have read further in 1 Corinthians 13. We have the perfect interpretation of the word &gt;&gt; by divine vindication. We don't need an artificial. &gt;&gt; We have the perfect. &gt;&gt; We have the word again. &gt;&gt; This message has restored us back to the original faith to and it restored it back to the original faith. It's got to restore us back to the original love because the capstone upon the body is love and she grows into that stature. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not an artificial put on. It's real. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not an artificial love. It's not even a friendship love. It's it's it's close to a filio. But this is agape love. This is God himself. We're talking about this queen being Christ herself. The word herself. She is &gt;&gt; the spirit of God. He that the Bible said he that is joined and that's in a union. That's a marriage. We know that we're in a union now. We're going to a wedding supper, but the union is now. &gt;&gt; This invisible union is taking place now. It's the word being manifested now. &gt;&gt; Amen. She She's coming. She's in her position coming now because the word the seals have been opened that opened the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it opened the book, it opened up what was in him all the time as a mystery, as a secret. And when he opened the book, he opened the word in you. So you become the mystery of the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. So as a Christian, I'm identified with him. Amen. All that he was, I am. I'm quoting by a vindicated prophet here. You either believe him or you don't believe him. There's no reason to take anything else. And don't you dare try to add to what he said and take away what he said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm not talking about the mistakes and I'm not I'm talking about his message. This message was Christ. This message was given to us by God. This message God stretched his tent, went down and took his position in a prophet, put the sword in his hand, and he took the message and opened the book to us. Without that open book, there would never be a meaning of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because without the open book, Calvary was in vain. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John wept. He knew what Calvary was. He knew. He knew he paid the price. There was a price paid for his redemption. But unless the book was opened and come and claimed what he redeemed. Hallelujah. Do you see the message of the hours claiming what he redeemed? What's it bringing it back to? Himself. Who is he? Charity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; God help us to see this. It's not up there just something we're saying. This is the truth. &gt;&gt; This is the hour. This is the time. &gt;&gt; My Hallelujah. All right. So, so all that he is, this is the prophecy. All that he was. And I'm not just saying let it be my words, Lord. I'm saying this. This is what I believe. I absolutely have seen it vindicated. I've seen it prove in my life day after day after day. His mercy is new every morning. The word keeps opening so fast I can't keep up with it. But I know that he's here bringing a message to you divinely right now this morning. Bringing it to you. Don't go to sleep. Don't just let's be waking up. Let's be awake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're later down the road you think. Don't play with this anymore. Don't play with this message. Well, I'm a message believer. I go to church. Isn't that enough? No, it's not enough. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to have the You've got to have the life of this word living in you. You must be born again. Must underline must. &gt;&gt; And I pray there's still a possibility of bringing someone in anymore because we're we're 60 nearly 63 years down the road since these seals were open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just think about that. How far down the road are we? And he thought he thought himself it could be over now. He said the last one could already be in. What about now? &gt;&gt; You may not have an opportunity. This may be your opportunity this morning. This may be the very time you need to make that turn. And if God's calling on you and he's pulling on you, then you need to yield to that call. Don't just sit idly by and think, "Well, I I can say I believe a message. That's all I need to do." It isn't. You've got to have the very literal life of Christ in you. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's going in a rapture. That's the only thing that's going to leave here &gt;&gt; is the bride. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I I may run my nose a little bit here, but we're all kind of getting over something. But I'm thankful for strength that God's given us to be here and to bring the word for this season. What a lovely hour. There's been no greater time than this &gt;&gt; when these secrets have been unsealed. My goodness. And it positionally place the bride. It's awakened her. Do you realize without those seven thunders voicing their voices that was the revelation contained in those seals which is the seventh seal it's a mystery of the seventh seal. Do you realize with realize without that there would be no awakening &gt;&gt; of the bride? None. Brother Brandham said it would take that to awaken her. Let's not downplay when we say seven thunders. Don't you let the devil put a negative in your mind about that. &gt;&gt; It's so simple. You cannot in your intellects figure it out. &gt;&gt; That's how simple it is. God works in simplicity. But it takes the discernment of the Holy Ghost in you to discern the difference. &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important. You must have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Not college education, not schooling. YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST. THE DEVIL'S DOING EVERYTHING HE can to throw that that loop in the road, to throw that that that hindrance, &gt;&gt; every way he can. &gt;&gt; I could go back to the word right now and tell you what Paul said a young woman ought to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can tell you right now what it was. Why don't we obey? &gt;&gt; The devil. You want to You want to follow the culture? The culture is not your guide. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you right now, the culture is not your guide. This word is your guide. &gt;&gt; And there's only salvation in one thing. You can have all of that and and be lost. You can have all of that and you're going to leave it. What are you going to do when your breath can be taken in the next moment? You will never even make it home. Maybe this day. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to scare you. I'm here to bring reality. &gt;&gt; This may be the last message I preach. This may be the last time I speak up here. I don't know. But I know I have to stand and give an answer to what I say. And I'm telling you the truth. You can't be without this. You're lost without this word becoming alive in you. &gt;&gt; When I say you're lost, I'm talking about I'm talking about going in a rapture. You're not going to make it. &gt;&gt; You're going to be left here for tribulation. And don't you try to say, "Well, if I do good works, I'll get it at the resurrection." And no, that will not work either because those that did the works, those that were good to the bride, those that did helped her, they didn't even know they were doing it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But now you're sitting here in the presence of the word and you're being told what you need is not a further education. What you need is a full surrendered life to Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and do what the word said for you to do. I'm I'm &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say that's harsh. That's harsh. Listen, I don't listen. You say, "Well, you offend us." I'm sorry. The word's going to offend somebody. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth because I love you. I don't do it for any other reason. I'm not up here to be somebody. I'm I'm old. I'm about ready to to to go on and meet my loved ones. You think I'm going to stand up here and try to tell you something that I think is not right and have been proven? I've proven it over and over again. You need Christ. You don't need something else. You need Christ and you give your life to him. Surrender your life to him and let him do the leading &gt;&gt; and he'll lead you perfectly. But the devil's got other plans. He's going to throw every distraction he can in your way. And the word's telling you different. You say, "Well, I didn't know that." Then you need to come into the word and find out what he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to be without excuse. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he laid everything he can before you to show you the truth. &gt;&gt; And the devil doing everything he can to pull you the other way according to what the culture says, according to what your friends say, according to this and according to that. Listen, brother, sister, it's either the word or nothing. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. I was a young man. God kept me through my teen years. I'll tell you what the keeping power is. I know what the keeping power of the Holy Ghost is. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm telling you as much as I can tell you. You can't miss this. If you do, it's because your fault. &gt;&gt; God didn't make you miss it. &gt;&gt; He's done everything he can to put that in front of you and lay the truth out before you. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you're going to go your own way because it's in your heart to do it. &gt;&gt; So you might as well be real. Be what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Let's not have a put on. There's nothing about hypocrites here. You either have it or you don't have it. And if you have a longing in your heart, then let's yield to it and let God do the leadership and put that word inside of you so that you'll love like he loved, walk like he walked, live like he lived. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; So, all that he is, I am. Seem like I can't get off that one quote right there. All that he is, I am. Then if he's charity, so am I. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've come to that time. We're at the top of the time. It's charity. The capstone. The capstone is present. The headstone has come. The message is the headstone. uniting with the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's here. He come exactly what he said, but he come in such simplicity and in a form that people don't understand. He's not known by big shot. He not known by education. He's known by a humble life of humility, something to himself. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "In order to be saved, you got to be able to accept that which you can't explain." &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. Brother Brandham said it to be saved, you must be able to accept that which you cannot explain. &gt;&gt; See what the devil's doing? Well, you don't can't explain it. So therefore, you don't have it. That's a lie out of the pits of hell. If it's revealed to you, you can no more give that to anybody, nor can you explain it. But you know individually that you have it, Brother Melo. You've got it. &gt;&gt; It's yours. you know it &gt;&gt; and you're willing to share it and you're willing to project it and you're willing to and you're willing to impart it &gt;&gt; and those that have ears to hear will receive it &gt;&gt; if he said there's a bride here today and there is that is the final voice to the final age under her messenger she is the final voice then she's here I don't care what I think about it what you think about it it he's here and that settles it and I know he's here. I see him working in me just exactly according to his word. Something I cannot do. &gt;&gt; He does it. &gt;&gt; This charity is not my works. It's his works. This charity is not projected my projection of myself. It's his projection of himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So all that I am, he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. All that I am, he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being dead in him, we are identified with him. Being dead in him. &gt;&gt; If you're dead in him, you're alive in him. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You've died to yourself. You die every day to yourself. Take up your cross and follow the word. You lay down your own feelings. You lay down your own reasoning. You lay down your own thinking about it and follow the word. &gt;&gt; And well, what about this one thing? What about these? Are they going to be more to you than the headship of Christ? Is that mean more to you what your friends think when they're themselves disappearing right and left when they themselves won't last either? Are you going to put yourself and put your trust in something that is temporal &gt;&gt; other than eternal? If that's your desires, I feel sorry for you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, there is no way out of this dilemma." I'm sorry. There sure is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; You don't have to You don't have to walk around in discouragement. There's a there's a healing of discouragement. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a way out of out of depression. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to live in depression. the word. You start taking God at his word, there is no depression. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure, the devil fights against you. What's he fighting against you for? Because he hates the word. He knows if you take your stand on the word, nothing is going to defeat you. &gt;&gt; You're undefeable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the bride realizes who she is and that she can do the greater work, she is an invincible army. You notice I said is NOT WILL BE. SHE IS NOW. I KNOW THERE'S A BRIDE. I am one of them that is invincible. And I cannot being the word be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about this outer man. I'm talking about that soul inside of me that says yes and amen to the word of God and then controls my m my this body and brings it subject to his word. When I see him bringing me subject to my his word, regardless of what I feel and how I feel and how many mistakes I made, then that's Christ himself. That's love in action. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being dead in him, we are identified with him. What he is, I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; What he is, I am. That's why I titled this the way I titled it. What he is, I am. &gt;&gt; I'm growing into that stature. So, what he is, I am. &gt;&gt; Don't let that be just a superficial. &gt;&gt; It's got to reach in here somewhere. &gt;&gt; If it's not in there, you'll never get it. You say, "Brother David, why are you saying that?" because I know that's true. There's going to be only so many that get it. That's because they have the discerner in them. They're born of the spirit. They were able to be born of the spirit. They were ordained to be born of the spirit. They already were eternal in him before the foundation of the world. They were all exist already existing in him. They were already they were already alive in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they come down today and this is your day. And now you are showing him manifest in the flesh again. Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That's exactly right. Amen. &gt;&gt; What this nation is, I am. I'm proud to be that. I'm ready to bear shame. I'm ready to bear a reproach to be American. That's right. But I'll double that to Jesus Christ. All that he ever was, I am. I'd like to be identified with him. I'm happy today to be to be one of them. Being identified with the word which is Christ. Identified with him. Being baptized into him. We come we become identified. Identified in his likeness. Identified with his word which is him. I am in Christ. If I'm in Christ, I am his word. &gt;&gt; For he is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that is and he &gt;&gt; that and what he is I am. &gt;&gt; Could you compare a Christian today with them Christians of long ago how them disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; You think they moved by the Holy Ghost? It wasn't contrary to their own human thinking. I guarantee it was. It was unusual. It was radical and out of their thinking when it would be and how it would be. &gt;&gt; But they never questioned that word. They knew they knew that. They knew that he was in them. They let go and gave him right away. And they were moved and they were led and directed by the Holy Ghost. I'm telling you right now, that's love in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's beyond friendship love. I believe in that. I believe in brotherly love and kindness. That's part of it. That's a part of the growth. But this whole thing has to be capped off and it's capped off by the person of Christ. And that's where the bride is today. That's her position today is charity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, moved by the Holy Ghost to do it. Moved by the Holy Ghost. Do it. What are we talking about? Be a doer of the word and not a hearer only. They were moved by the Holy Ghost. And as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, they did it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were his body. He was the head. Whatever he ordained and what he spoke to them, they moved. They did it. &gt;&gt; That's your bride. That's the bride. That's the word living in action today. The bride is the word living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride is the charity living and in action. &gt;&gt; Everybody can read the Bible. Everybody can look at the scriptures. But they but you become the scriptures living. &gt;&gt; You become the thought in the word manifested. &gt;&gt; God expressed his thought. God expressed what he had. In the beginning was his expressed thought that he had in that word of himself. And your himself expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's the seals. There's there's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. That's what's awakened the bride. &gt;&gt; One year later, Brother Bram said, "Nothing to move her, nothing to awaken. They'll take those seven thunders." And one year later, preaching, recognizing your day in his message, he said, "The thing the people aren't getting today, they haven't realized is that they haven't recognized the awakening of the bride." &gt;&gt; What's he telling us? He said, "There's the sealed opening up. The seventh seal opened and revealed. The third pull is the opening of the word. and you're the word that's opened. &gt;&gt; No wonder John got happy. We could go to We could go to Revelations chapter 5 right now and see John said everything heard I speaking. Everything heard I giving rejoicing because why? He saw his name as the mystery sealed in the book. He saw his name in that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That ought to set anybody on fire. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. That's what's the truth &gt;&gt; is that that's where he he saw that. You see? Amen. He said he discerned that. He he looked to pass the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; He was able to look past the curtain time. Many today, many hundreds message believers are not able to look past the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; Why? When they have such a glorious word because they need. Because the bride is the one that'll be I don't know. I'm not saying who's bride and who isn't. I just know she's a small number. There's a many a good heart, many a good people, sanctified people, blood sanctified people that are going to go through the tribulation and stand someday at the white throne judgment and be judged by their works. You'll never find the bride be standing before the throne in the white throne judgment. She's already judging. Why do you think we speak such truth and such plainness today? Why do you think that so many are offended by the way the bride speaks the word? &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not because of how I speak it. It's more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have liked John the Baptist very well. You wouldn't have liked Jesus either when he braided ropes and looked upon him with anger. You wouldn't have liked that either. &gt;&gt; But he spoke the truth. He expressed love. Went through 2,000 of people around a a pond around Lake Ganess. No, it wasn't Lake Ganesser. was um huh yeah pool of Bethesda and bypassed 2,000 or more to one man but he loved brother Bram said that was love expressed. &gt;&gt; What is love expressed? What is that? He said doing the will of the father. &gt;&gt; There it is right there. Regardless of what others think about it, you're so you're so tapped in. You're so united with that word that you don't care what they think about it. You'll do what the Holy Spirit said do and you won't move until it moves you. &gt;&gt; It's no figuring any of it out. It's a love affair, brother, sister. It's a love affair. He's pouring himself into the He's pouring himself into you. That's what the message was about. That's what the seventh seal was about. Pouring himself into her. They are becoming one for the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly. They're becoming one, brother, sister. They're becoming one. Do you realize that this bride is going to disappear and you may be left here? &gt;&gt; You wonder why God is so so adamant on getting you to realize there's no chance of surviving. There's no chance of s of going home without having this word inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you have a pull for that, then if I know this, if you have a genuine deep calling to that deep, there's a deep to respond. And a deep's responding to you this morning. And if you have that, you're going to respond. I guarantee it. If that seeds inside of you, you going to respond to the word. &gt;&gt; If it's not, you can I can say all I want to say. Every preacher can say what they want to say. The message could say you'll never see it. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to discourage you. I'm here to tell you the truth. So, it depends on what's in your soul right now. &gt;&gt; We're too late to play games with this anymore. &gt;&gt; This is not playing church. &gt;&gt; This is a house of correction. &gt;&gt; What is the house of correction? What is correction? True, genuine, godly correction is charity. &gt;&gt; It's the love of God correcting. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it sounds harsh. I I know you don't have love because the way you sound. That's a bunch of nonsense and a lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You go back and see what my life is living. What of the fruit am I bearing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how you judge them by their fruit. Judas was a devil and anointed of the Holy Ghost and cast out devils operated by faith and had the power of God anointing him. &gt;&gt; A genuine Holy Spirit. Capifas also balam also. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a devil. &gt;&gt; So it's going to take more than and I believe in all. I believe in shouting. I believe in casting out devil. I believe it because it's a Holy Ghost work. But you can have all of that as I said before and miss the rapture. Because unless that seeds down in your soul when you hear this word, there's going to be something take place inside of you that you can't suppress, you can't repress. It's going to come forth. It'll stay with you until you fully completely let go and surrender to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you might as well just quit fighting it and say, "Lord, I need you." Let's get alone with him and start feeding on the word. Start feeding on the open book and let it become you because you're going to become what you eat on. &gt;&gt; If you want to be the word living, start eating the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, you'll face tests. You'll face trials. Nobody will agree. You're going to the people are going to come against you and all these things. But what difference does that make? Eternal life is way above that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "These seals opening this book opening up right now." See, when he opened the book, he opened who I am. &gt;&gt; I couldn't see that until fully until then because the bride is the full manifestation, the full revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; She's the mystery of God revealed. She's the mystery of God, finished mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what she is. And we ought to be submitting ourselves entirely to that. And if you've got things out there that's taking your taking place of that, don't you let an idol come in your life. I don't care how important. I don't care what it is. If it takes this position and takes you away from that word and sits there between you and going further in that word, then brother, sister, it's an idol and it's an idolatrous spirit and you need to be free of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you have, how much education you've got, or anything else. That will never put you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That will absolutely keep you out of it. Actually, &gt;&gt; you put your trust in that, you'll never go anywhere. &gt;&gt; Only further in the ditch, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And probably get more religious all the time because you're doing good works. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, what we've got is beyond &gt;&gt; good works. It's a genuine faith and works follow that. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Faith without works is dead. You can have all those works and no faith. It's still dead. &gt;&gt; But you can have all faith as a natural man, be anointed of the genuine Holy Ghost, and have all faith. But I'm telling you, are you able to hear and receive the word for the season? Is it becoming genuinely a revelation to you? There's your evidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; My I hardly got started. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so wouldn't you like to see they the move by the Holy Ghost? They just did it. A prisoner. As I preached the other night, a prisoner. How many prisoners? See, that's what you got to become as a prisoner. You must become a prisoner. &gt;&gt; Prison to everything else and alone with Jesus Christ. A prisoner to him. &gt;&gt; Regardless of the pull this side and the pull this side and the pull that side and how much this pulls on you and how much a prisoner to him Lord is this your perfect, not your permissive, your perfect will, which is his word, which is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You can't divide the message of the hour from the word. And don't you let anybody try to do it. &gt;&gt; You can't add to this. The prophet said, "Don't you go out and add to what I've said or take away." That's his word. Don't you add to it and take away. &gt;&gt; Another place you want me to hear something real strict, too. He said, "If you can't understand what I'm saying, just take what I say. God will hold me responsible for it." I'm sorry, but it is absolute. The word and the message are absolutely one. &gt;&gt; You cannot divide them. And how dare anybody would come along and try to divide that. &gt;&gt; They don't have discernment. &gt;&gt; They're lacking discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, watch what else he said. Just a prisoner to the word and the will of God. A prisoner to the word, which is the will of God. He couldn't even move an individual. See, it's an individual affair, brother, sister. It's not this group, that group, another group. It's an individual affair. &gt;&gt; You just be you just be a good hearer of the word and let God take care of the rest of it. He'll have you be right where you should be. He'll have a woman in her place where she should be and a man in his place where he should be. And you'll be carrying out what he called you to carry out. &gt;&gt; You get yourself united with him and let him do the work. He can't take you away from the word. He's not going to take you away from this message. He's not going to take you out of that. He'll bring you in it. He'll lead you into all truth. And if you don't see him leading you to all truth, something is wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. For when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will lead you into all, guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't even move until God moved you. Wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that? It's going to It's going back. Anybody have the time? What time is it? Okay. Hey, no one wants to tell me. You got to watch on. What time is it? Okay, I'll keep going then cuz I don't have it either. So, and this screen's down. So, thanks be to the Lord. All right, then. Wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that? It's going to back. &gt;&gt; How many's going back? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's going back? &gt;&gt; How many's going back &gt;&gt; to the truth? Going back to the word. Going back. Amen. Back to where? I'm not talking about going back. To go back is go forward. &gt;&gt; All right. But he said it's got to come. Other words, he said it's on its road. It's going to it's going back back to what? The original faith, &gt;&gt; the original word, the original person, the original love. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now, it's got to come. It's on its road now. Yes, it is. And it has. And it is. And here she is today. I believe that with all my heart. You'd realize that this bride is the manifestation of the message. The manifestation exactly the manifestation of Christ in another form. You realize this is the bride coming of Christ. Do you realize your day and what he said would be here and how he would return? The mystery of how he would return. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ the mystery of God revealed of how it's only revealed to the bride. &gt;&gt; Here's the secret. Why? Here's the secret. The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bearing life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now it's got to come now. He knew who he was. Now look at how he turns right back around. Now it's on its road. Now see, he knew who he was. And there's a bride knowing who she is. I know who I am. That's why there's no fear. It removes every bit of fear. When you know who you are, how you going to be moved off of him? How you going to be defeated? How you going to be how you going to be not? How you not going to make it &gt;&gt; when you know who you are? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a showmanship. It's a genuine humility in walking with God every day &gt;&gt; in unity with him in in love with him in in absolutely in divine oneness. &gt;&gt; No longer twain. What God hath joined together let no man put us under. &gt;&gt; God's put this together. Amen. See Matthew 16. If he see he was standing. Now turn to Matthew 16. Now see he knew who he was. Therefore he had faith. his faith could produce when he knowed what he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if you abide in me and my word abides in you, then you know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There it is. Let me say that again. If you abide in me and my word abides in you, then you know who you are. &gt;&gt; It's not just a hope. So, it's a revelation to an individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Matthew 16. very familiar scripture. Verse 18, he's speaking to Peter. He said, "Who do men say that I am?" And Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." He said, "Flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven." 18th verse. I want to show you something here. And I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock, that rock is revelation of who Jesus Christ is. So upon that rock, notice rock represents revelation. And upon that rock, I'll build my church. Other words, upon this foundation of the revelation of who I am, I'm going to build my church. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing it? Amen. Amen. I don't know what happened to my handkerchief. Okay, I guess. Don't need it. Oh, there it is. All right. One of those pockets. Okay, let me say it again. Upon this rock, what was he? the cornerstone. He was the cornerstone. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He was the head of the He was the corner. And they rejected the corner. But the bride's not going to reject it. He said, "I'll build my church upon this foundation." Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Now, where's your rest, bride? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, if she's growing and the and watch what now, let's go to Peter. Let's go to first Peter 2. 1 Peter 2. Let's begin with the sixth verse. You could read it all. Wherefore, it is also contained in the scripture. Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. He that has the revelation, &gt;&gt; he that's got the real faith &gt;&gt; upon this revelation, upon this foundation, upon this cornerstone, I will build my church. And I'm telling you right now, if he's building his church upon that foundation, what will she be? &gt;&gt; Who will she be? Amen. All right. Now, watch. He said here verse seven, "And and not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe, believe." Real revelation which you believe, real faith, he is precious. But unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed. Just what I said, the same is made the head. Now they made the head of the corner. Amen. Are you with me? They left it. But but to you that believe upon this church, I'll build my church upon the revelation of who I am. I'm going to build that church. And there's no other foundation laid but me. And that and that's it. On that revelation. But now it's turned from the corner. Now what's happened? Now a corner's turned. Now there's been a turn. Now the headstones appeared. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now what about it? Now he is precious. See, but to them that are the this which are not which are disobedient disobedient to what? word which the which the stone which the builder disallowed the same that same stone has be has been made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock a revelation of offense. &gt;&gt; Think of that even to them which stumble at the word. It's a it's an offense to them. They stumble at the word and they don't like this kind of preaching and they don't like the preaching that that brings down the revelation of the hour. They have to find fault with it. It's too deep. It's too deep. It's not simple. That's another lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is simple and it's not something made up. It's so it's so simple when it's revealed to you, you can't see it any other way but said, "How did I miss this?" You missed it because in your carnality, you couldn't figure it out. &gt;&gt; You couldn't you couldn't get it. &gt;&gt; You can't become that simple. &gt;&gt; I wish I could drive that home. Amen. This is not something that's outlandish and out of it is to your mind, but not to the soul realm. If that word's in there, it's food. It's due season. It's food in due It's spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, now so a rock of offense to them which stumble at the word. It's a rock of offense being disobedient wherein to also they were appointed. They were appointed to that place. They were appointed to be offended. They were appointed. Here's the headstone. Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham said this. He said, he said, "This is the head time." Christ the headstone comes to the body. This is the head time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So he said, "Now verse nine, but you &gt;&gt; they're offended, but you &gt;&gt; that have the revelation that I built my church on. But you that are built up and now capped off by the headstone, the message of the seventh angel that is capped, the opening of the of the opening of the book, the opening of the of the of the sealed mystery of the opening of the mystery to you. You are what? a chosen generation, &gt;&gt; a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. So when a man lives by faith and walks by faith, I mean substance faith, he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ. There now you're getting into bride material. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, see you're getting into rapturing conditions now. What we're speaking about now that means for each one of us, not just the pastor, the deacons, trustees. That means for you, the leoty, every individual walks in a world with God alone. You're baptized into his kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God. &gt;&gt; See, he gives the orders and you pack them out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You pack them out. See, the head and the body are one. &gt;&gt; What are you packing out, Charity? Love. What are you imparting? Love. &gt;&gt; Life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation of life is light. &gt;&gt; Amen. When light is manifest, his light is manifested. His life is manifest. Excuse me. It's light. &gt;&gt; You're imparting light upon darkness, exposing the darkness. If you're not a real believer, you don't like that. But if you are a real believer and you've done something you shouldn't have done and and God puts that light on it, you say, "Thank you, Lord. I needed that. I c that's correction &gt;&gt; by love." &gt;&gt; Amen. By love. &gt;&gt; And there's nobody but you and God in there. You pack them out the orders and there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere. You walk right on. If the Lord says this, there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it. You go right on just the same. Now you're coming into a perfect faith. Hear me. Now you're coming into perfect faith. And you can't have perfect love without perfect faith. They go hand in hand. You cannot have one without the other. And the believer, the real bride is the faith of God that moves in you. That's a direct quote. Page 68 out of perfect faith. A real believer, the bride of Jesus Christ is the faith is the substance is the revelation of God. Psalm 62 said, David said, "God is my revelation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See why the bride's so peculiar? You see why she peculiar people? A royal priesthood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She lives another life. It's not common. It's not It's uncommon to the world. Getting more radical all the time in their sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's food. It's life. It's light. It's joy unspeakable. &gt;&gt; To the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AI said, "Now you're coming into perfect faith. You're coming into bride material. You're getting rapture condition. You're coming into perfect faith. Perfect perfection that can not fail." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's good to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot fail. That faith, that faith, that's who I am. That faith, that faith never fails. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That faith never fails. Love never fails. Charity never fails. &gt;&gt; Do you see who she is? &gt;&gt; She's himself. &gt;&gt; Not God walking next to me. I can't. Do I hear? He's in me. I'm in him. &gt;&gt; It's a union. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you see her, you see him. When you see him, you see her. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; See, bearing the same life, the same character, the same &gt;&gt; spirit. Got it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm trying to find a place to stop here. I, as I said, I just have to carry this on again. But, but it cannot fail. Perfect faith. with that perfect faith. He was a mystic to them with his perfect faith. And so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others. You know what a mystic means? A mystery. They're a mystery to others. Now, what is he? He has gone off the deep end. He's so radical. You know what he's telling us now? We don't need all these other things. We just need we need the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need that. Then if he appoints other things, then do it according to what he said, not what you think, not what you feel, not what the culture tells you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back to Timothy. Go back. Go back to Peter and find out what what Peter said about, &gt;&gt; what Peter said about young people, &gt;&gt; what Timothy said, &gt;&gt; what what what Paul said, &gt;&gt; told Timothy, and then line up with it. If you can't line up with that word, even one little iota, you're no better than even the beginning. &gt;&gt; Quit putting your reasoning to the word. Quit letting the devil put the reasoning to the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Take him at his word. Who's going to who's going to come down the line in some place and say, "I'll take God at his word." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, there's not very many of us. &gt;&gt; That's truth. I know they're there, but there's not many of us comparably. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; 8 to one. &gt;&gt; Think of that. Talking about the beginning. How many was there Enoch? I I know there's more than that, but look how the difference is. Elijah thought he was the only one. He said 7,000 that haven't bowed their knee out of millions. How many knew Jesus was on earth when he was here? How many received him then? There was billions of people on earth at that time. Hardly not everyone even in in Israel even knew he existed. But who'd he come to? His own. And those that gladly heard him and received him. See what did what did the prophet say here? Watch what he says here. And I I'm trying to close. He says here now just a moment here. Thought I had it right here. Well, oh yeah, for seal. And I think any bornag again Christian is kind of an oddball to the world because you've been changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've been changed. &gt;&gt; You're not living by this outer man anymore. You're living from the inside out. &gt;&gt; If there's not a change in your soul, you're missing. I'm going to speak directly to everybody here. There's no pulling any punches. I don't care how old you are. It's not an old people's message. &gt;&gt; I received this message at 12 years old. It was a genuine revelation in my heart. &gt;&gt; You can't tell me it's not the truth. I've watched it manifest itself over and over again &gt;&gt; perfectly with the word. So, there's no such a thing as I'm too young, I'm too old. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. It's revelation, brother, sister. And it takes something of God in you to receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes the seed of God in you to receive it. It takes a listening post for him to make it known to you. Otherwise, you have an intellectual conception. We don't want that. We got to have him. And if that strikes your heart, I don't care how who you're related to and who you're not related to. If that strikes your heart, you better act on it quickly. Amen. Amen. Because someday I'm going to stand before us all right here. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to begin to answer what I said here this morning &gt;&gt; and what I've said through the years. I'm not young anymore. As I said, &gt;&gt; I've had a lot of experiences. I've seen many, many, many miracles. I've seen God anoint his word, cast out devils, move storms, heal dogs, raise the dead, heal animals. Brother, sister, over and over again. That's God doing that. But that's not meaning I because I But thank God the revelation's never left. He keeps revealing. He keeps opening his word as he said he would. &gt;&gt; You don't tell me it's not real. It's more real than I'm than you're seeing me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not an AI. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not something dying. It's eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the truth. And watch what he says here. He says, "You're from another world. Your spirit's from across the chasm. You are from another world." Other words, what I'm living is out of this world. &gt;&gt; It is a royal seed, a royal race. &gt;&gt; And I am royalty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if you're with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't even question that. I am royalty above royalty today. &gt;&gt; The bride is royalty above royalty. It don't matter how much of a popper you are and how much you don't have or do have. &gt;&gt; Amen. God chose you in himself before the foundation of the world. And that settles it. And God has given me that Holy Spirit, that word living inside of me which is identified that that's so &gt;&gt; to me personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he can to you personally. So here you go. You're from another world. Your spirit's from across the chasm. And this thing here is such a messed up thing. If you don't think it's messed up, then you tell me. Talk about insanity. &gt;&gt; Listen, the world today is beyond what we call insanity. We can't even say it right. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet there's a hiding place. &gt;&gt; There's a peace that passes all of that understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which would you rather have? A star in basketball or would you rather go home and live for eternity? &gt;&gt; Take your choice. You're dying every day. You're dying right now. &gt;&gt; Your flesh man is dying. &gt;&gt; You go through this day. It's taken one step closer &gt;&gt; to the grave. Amen. I don't care how old you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's only one life, eternal life. And that ought to have preeminence in everything you do. That ought to be where you're standing. You want more of God. You say, "I'm struggling. I'm doing this and that." And you're trying to find the help through education and science. You're going down the wrong path. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that has life and has eternal life and has healing. There's no other healer but God himself. And there's no other way you can be healed but outside of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; If thou canst believe, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. It's a messed up thing up here. If you're not different, there's something wrong with you. If you're not different than the culture, there's something wrong. You're still too earthbound. You ought to be heavenly minded. Heaven lives by the word. &gt;&gt; Boy, you start living by the word and you're going to rub the culture the wrong way. &gt;&gt; There's going to be friction. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You start walking like a real Christian ought to walk in the light of the word and you're not going to be well accepted or received. The only one you're going to be well accepted received by is another bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I'm I'm not saying there's good people born, you know, sanctified people and they're good people and because they're good to the bride because they're a help to them because they go to church every day in messy churches. I'm not saying they're bad people. They are bad. They're not bad people. But I'm trying to make a point. &gt;&gt; They won't understand. But the only one that going to understand and receive is that little bride because she's born again. &gt;&gt; Jesus walked among them. They couldn't understand him. He looked he looked like a mystic to them. Nobody could understand him like he talked in riddles all the time. &gt;&gt; If that was him yesterday, what is he today? &gt;&gt; I'm not trying. We're not trying to be that way. But that's his character. That's his life. &gt;&gt; All right. But in this day, how many see the promise being fulfilled? Brother said, "Now we see that this day these promises is fulfilled." Let me tell you something. Let me pass this along to you. And I He said, "When the supernatural comes in, that's the Holy Ghost himself. When the supernatural comes in, that's the mind of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, we look for the super. I look for the super. I believe in supernatural movings, but unless that supernatural lives inside of me &gt;&gt; on the inside of the inside &gt;&gt; in the soul realm, &gt;&gt; you're not going in a rapture. You say, "That's blunt." I'm going to say it again. I want it to be blunt. You're not going in a rapture without that Holy Ghost, the word himself, living in your soul. That's right. &gt;&gt; All that the Father has given me will come. And no man can come except my father draws him. &gt;&gt; Now, you've been called, but many are called, but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; But are you the chosen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It depends what you want to do with it. This thing is thrown in your lap this morning. depends what you want to do with it. &gt;&gt; You have the choice. It depends on what's in the soul. It depends what's longing inside of there. If you you can give lip service and say, "I need more of God." Or you can give true lip service to say, "I need him more than ever. I need more of him. then it's meaning something because now you're speaking from your heart, &gt;&gt; not from this other realm. Trying to be good, trying to impress somebody, trying to be religious. Get rid of it. It's nonsense. It's a lie of the devil. There's all kinds of that perversion around here. Let's be real. &gt;&gt; Let's be genuine. &gt;&gt; Okay, I think I'm going to close here. is growing in a bride. Brother, sister, the true revelation of Jesus Christ is growing in the bride to the full stature. What I'm telling you today, I'm relating to you the full stature charity. That's what he come for. And he has a bride &gt;&gt; maturing. I believe she's right very close now &gt;&gt; to stepping over. I don't mean just in natural. My age, you know, he could look at me and say, "Yeah, you're about ready to step over another 10 years, maybe 15. My dad was old. He was 94. I don't know if I don't I don't really want to stay around that long, but I want to be here as long as God wants me here. And I am to minister this truth as long as God opens that door." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's more than life to me. It's more than look, it's more than what I feel. Because more than anything else, it is eternal life. Sometimes I wish I could say it the way I see it so clear. When she comes in, that's the mind of Christ. You become so far away from your own thinking till your own mind. Don't let me try to explain that because I can't. I couldn't do it. There's nobody could do it. Don't try to explain that of the supernatural because you can't do it. And the only thing to do is just go right ahead. Keep walking with him. &gt;&gt; Just keep walking with him. Let him be your ambition. Let him be your desire. Let him be first place. Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and these other things will be added unto you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Seek that first and God will take care of the rest of it. Where you need to be, what you need to do in life, you put him first. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I pray God help these parents to put this before their children &gt;&gt; and bring them up in the way they should be brought up and not be afraid to tell them the truth. Let's start being what we're spent to be. A mother of the home, a real mother, a real father, a real leader. And quit listening to the culture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't go to back to some psychology of the greatest psychology book you ever had, and that's the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. But just remember, there's a battle going on and devil's going to try to talk you out of it on the battleground of your mind. What was said right here this morning. You say, "How do you know that, Brother David?" Because I've experienced. I know what he does. We're not ignorant of his devices. &gt;&gt; You've learned. You've learned what his tricks are. &gt;&gt; Let's be vigilant. &gt;&gt; You're born of the spirit. Let's be vigilant. &gt;&gt; Let that devil come walking in there. Teach your children the right way. Bring them up under the word. Tell them the truth. The bride is himself revealed. She's the manifest. She's the manifestation of the word in the bride in the formation of the bride. She's him. Let's stand together. I'm going to stop. &gt;&gt; I didn't feel to stop until right then. So, I'm just going to have to put that in the Lord's hand. No matter what you think about it, I'm sorry. You think he takes so long. He takes so long. Listen, you think I take so long, if you miss this rapture, you're going to wonder why you didn't take it longer. That's the truth. You miss going home, you're going to wonder about those times when you thought it took too long. [Music] We can't be we can't take enough time with this. The devil's trying to keep us too busy. You need to step aside a little bit and meditate upon the things of the word. Get alone. God, what am I to do? I'm facing eternity. Not whether my husband comes in, whether this one doesn't or this one does. What am I going to do with Christ? What am I going to do with this Jesus called to Christ that's present here this morning that's right here among us? What are you going to do with him? Going to go your old way or you going to give yourself to him? Now's your opportunity. &gt;&gt; Don't pass it by. God works in simple ways. It's just your opportunity, brother, sister. Don't let it pass you. I had a lot more to say. Maybe the Lord allow me to take it again. But I love him. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; I just feel there's such a presence here. God, help us each one. I just want you to get real with God here this morning. Don't look at the preacher. Don't look at how much time it's taken. I want you to get real with him. You're going to answer him. You're not going to answer me someday. I'll give an answer for what I speak to you. But I'm going to still be there with that little bride. By the grace of God. That's all it is. By the grace of God. A divine enablement. When something you can't produce, God gives it to you. Are you willing to receive it, though? Are you willing to receive it? That's the thing. God help us. My heart's just bleeding. The bride saw the bride. The prophet saw the bride marching in the preview of the bride. There was that worldly church out there undressed, naked. Don't see how close you can live to the world, brother, sister. See how much how close you can live to the word. [Music] Stay away from that edge of unbelief as far as you can. You let God come in. You let God have control. He's asking you to completely surrender your life to him. He's asking you to let him come in. Dear God, I don't know what words to say. I know, Lord, that this has been ordained of you. I don't care about the number of people. It doesn't matter Lord who's listening, who isn't listening. I just you speaking. Lord, you know all about that. I'm saying, Lord, don't let them miss the birth. I pray there's still able, still people that can come in, still young people that can receive it. Lord, I don't know. It may be over. What if it is this morning? What if this is your last moment? What if this is your last time that you'll be able to receive it? I can't tell you there's going to be that last time. It may be shut. The last one may be married. I don't know. But oh God, have mercy. move upon every individual life this morning. Let that heart of theirs be an altar where they'll let go. Give themselves entirely to you, Lord. Don't let them hesitate anymore. Let them make that choice that you're my head, Lord. I'll follow you. I'll go where you want me to go. I'll be what your word said for me to be. I take you as my head. I take you as my salvation, my strength, my rock. God have mercy. I'll pray. I pray. Have mercy. Thy will be done. Lord, as I release this people into your hands, they have the opportunity to make it right. Just right there where they're seated. They can turn their life completely over. Not by emotion, not looking for emotion, but looking for a genuine truth, revelation of truth that strike their hearts and they respond to it. That's what you're looking for. Oh God, I commit them to you. This service is in your hands. These people are in your hands. Lord, I don't know what else to say. I've taken all that I know to do right now. Thou art my judge of that. And Lord, I know that you don't mince words. Your words are perfect. Let them realize, Lord, there's nothing as perfect as yourself that they could ever go to. Everything else is imperfect. Everything else is temporary. Let them make their choice to serve you, Father. Not mix it. Don't let them go out and mix the world with this anymore. See, I believe let go out and mix it. Put this with that and mix it. Mix a word with something else. Mix the word with a re reasoning. Mix the word. Lord, we're not mixers. That word is absolute. You can't be mixed. Oh, God, help us. It's not about mixing. Well, I'll be this plus that. No, you heard me preach this last time. No double-mindedness in the bride of Christ. He that is double-minded is unstable in all of his ways. You can't mix it, brother, sister. You either absolutely 100% given over to him or you're mixing. We don't live between two two minds here, caught in between. That's a bad place. You can't mix it. You're either 100% living for Christ or you're not. [Music] Amen. We're not living by two different minds. As I said, Lord, [Music] oh God, help us, Father. Just waiting a few minutes. Let God move. In a few minutes, I'm going to ask brother to come up here and close with a couple songs or whatever's on his heart. But I'm just going to wait just a few minutes while you're in the presence of the Lord. Let him speak. It's good that we wait on the Lord. Brother Brandham said, "You've done the speaking. Now be quiet and let him speak to you." He has spoken to you. [Music] So you're facing choice. Lights been put in your path. [Music] As I said, we're not living a divided interest. [Music] I'll take this and I'll take this and I'll mix the two together. No, he wants a complete separation from all unbelief. complete separated. If he's called you to be a certain thing and done a certain thing and then you try to mix it, it won't work. You need to completely give over and let God have his way with you. [Music] Go ahead, brother. Come. God bless you. [Music] Speak your word into our hearts and have your way. Have your way. from your heart. &gt;&gt; Have your way. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, fill our hearts and have your way as we wait. And as we pray, speak your word into our hearts and have your way. Oh, have your way. Have your way. Holy Spirit, fill our hearts and have your way. And as we wait and as we pray, speak your words into our hearts and have your way. [Music] And we are the generation key of F. We are the generation. [Music] We're the culmination. The final voice. The world will hear. The coming of the Lord is near. Living out the revelation. overcoming sins, temptation. The truth will go to every tongue and nation. We are the chosen generation. One more time. We are the generation. We're the culmination. The final voice. The world will hear. The coming of the Lord is near. Living out the revelation. Overcoming sins temptation. The truth will go to every tongue and nation. We are the chosen generation. [Music] Thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me whole. Thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free. Thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me whole. Thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free. One last time. I thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me whole. [Music] Thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free. Amen. With that we're dismissed. God bless you till we gather again together. [Music]
