[0:00] No sir,
[0:01] &gt;&gt; I'm in him.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; I've always been in him.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Brown said, "If you
[0:05] weren't in him in the beginning, you'll
[0:07] never be in." So, I want you to stop
[0:09] right now and in spite of every struggle
[0:12] that we have, every battle that we face,
[0:15] every shortcoming we see in oursel and
[0:17] those around us, realize to be in him
[0:20] right now, WE HAD TO ALWAYS be in him.
[0:23] And if we were ALWAYS IN HIM, LET'S HAVE
[0:26] CONFIDENCE THAT THIS is nothing more
[0:28] than a speed bump, a little stumbling
[0:31] stone that was put in our path to get us
[0:33] to quit.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; If we see that, if we don't, it'd be
[0:38] time for us to get in an altar. Amen.
[0:40] Maybe at home, the closet, whatever, and
[0:42] say, "Lord, I believe I'm a do son of
[0:44] God, a daughter of God." Amen. Every
[0:47] time [snorts] we have to have an
[0:49] expectation
[0:51] of another junction coming up. Do you
[0:54] realize that when revelation comes to
[0:57] us,
[0:59] faith has to come in the junction for
[1:02] you to be able to act on the revelation.
[1:05] See, we need to understand that just
[1:07] because something opens to you doesn't
[1:09] mean you're going to take that and live
[1:12] that.
[1:13] It takes faith
[1:16] to bring that to a place.
[1:19] Brother Vitali, I really enjoyed his
[1:22] morning services there
[1:25] and he made a great emphasis how and the
[1:27] and the platform was quite tall there.
[1:30] So it made a great great example and he
[1:32] was talking about how we come to a place
[1:34] we talk about faith. We hear the word
[1:36] all of these things but when faith
[1:38] really comes to be uh on display in our
[1:42] life. Brother Vitali walked right out
[1:44] put half of his foot off the platform. I
[1:46] was thinking man with balance like I
[1:48] have he's fallen off of there but he's a
[1:50] young man. He's healthy. And then he put
[1:52] his leg all the way out there. He said,
[1:54] "You know what? We can stand like this
[1:56] all day long.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; And it won't do us one bit of good."
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Faith says, "Let it go." And when you
[2:06] let it go, that step becomes your next
[2:09] step.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; But without letting that go, we can
[2:12] stand here as message believers all day
[2:15] long. God sent a prophet. I am healed.
[2:18] Here's revelations of the word. I see
[2:20] the mysteries of the thunders. I see the
[2:22] vials. I see this. I see that. And we're
[2:24] just standing there all day long, not
[2:27] taking a step. God wants us to step into
[2:29] that word. Step into that revelation.
[2:32] Amen. Just step into that presence
[2:34] because there is where we come to the
[2:37] next junction in our spiritual walk. And
[2:39] people would say, "I don't know about
[2:41] that." You don't know about that cuz
[2:42] you've never been there. You never done
[2:44] that. If you've never jumped out of an
[2:46] airplane, you can't describe what it's
[2:48] like.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Sue shared a book with me.
[2:52] She's always lovely about buying me
[2:54] stuff. And a man's talking about how and
[2:56] the army. Amen. He went to parachute
[2:58] school and he said it was fine. They had
[3:01] a tower like 25 ft tall and they go up
[3:03] there and it's got a line hooked and and
[3:05] that when they told them to step off,
[3:07] they stepped off cuz the ground's right
[3:09] there. But when they got up in a plane
[3:11] up there a few thousand feet high, some
[3:13] of those men got up to the door. Amen.
[3:16] And they got a hold of that door. And in
[3:19] this one case, I thought it was funny
[3:20] because the the the jump master actually
[3:23] had a parachute on. Praise the Lord.
[3:25] Otherwise, he'd be dead. Amen. There's
[3:28] this man got a hold of the door frame
[3:30] and when the jump master tried, a
[3:32] sergeant tried to push him out the door,
[3:34] the man turned around, grabbed the jump
[3:36] master, AND THEN FELL out the door.
[3:38] Amen.
[3:40] After that, the next time up in the
[3:42] plane, the jump master got to him.
[3:44] before he got to the door, he said, "You
[3:47] ever do that again, I'll knock you out
[3:49] and throw you out of the plane
[3:50] unconscious."
[3:52] Now, I tell you, I think sometimes God
[3:55] is telling us, you are going to take the
[3:59] next step. I'm going to put things in
[4:02] your life that you are going TO GET SO
[4:04] DESPERATE THAT YOU NEED A DELIVERANCE. I
[4:07] need to TAKE A NEXT STEP, LORD. I GOT TO
[4:09] MAKE IT. AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, BY
[4:12] DESPERATION, you take this step.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; But it also describes in that book how
[4:18] when they were jumping over Normandy on
[4:21] D-Day and the flack and the machine gun,
[4:24] the the the uh tracer rounds are flying
[4:27] up, one man fell to the floor, crawled
[4:30] to the back of the airplane, got a hold
[4:31] of the seat, and they couldn't pry him
[4:34] loose.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; He was not going in the rapture.
[4:40] That's right.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Is that a fair example? [snorts]
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Because he couldn't take that next step.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; But God wants you and I.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know what your next step is,
[4:51] brother, sister. I don't know. God
[4:53] doesn't I don't need to know what God's
[4:55] got for you. What we have to do is
[4:57] realize this mystery unfolding in us
[5:01] requires us to keep walking. There's no
[5:04] stagnant. We're not going to come to a
[5:05] Red Sea and say, "I wished I was in
[5:07] Egypt." Amen. We're not going to come
[5:09] out here amongst the serpents and say,
[5:12] "I wished I WAS IN EGYPT." WE'RE NOT
[5:14] GOING TO GET OUT IN the middle of that
[5:15] wilderness and say, "I wished I was in
[5:17] Egypt." WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RALLY CRY
[5:20] AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. I'M
[5:22] LOOKING to a PROMISED LAND. I'M PROMISED
[5:24] A LAND BEYOND THE RIVER. I'M GOING TO
[5:27] POSSESS THAT LAND. I'M GOING TO WALK IN
[5:29] THAT LAND, AND THAT LAND'S GOING TO BE
[5:30] FRUITFUL to me. My family's going to
[5:33] have THE HOLY GHOST. I'M GOING TO HAVE
[5:34] THE HOLY GHOST. THE WORD'S GOING TO COME
[5:36] TO PASS IN OUR LIFE. WE'RE GOING TO BE
[5:38] MOVED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. WE'RE GOING TO
[5:40] claim what is rightfully ours.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to sit back and
[5:44] say, "I want to go back. I want to go
[5:46] back. I WANT TO GO BACK." WE'RE GOING TO
[5:48] be here anointed with a spirit. I want
[5:51] to go to that promise that God has given
[5:54] to me.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:57] Amen. [snorts]
[5:58] If there was ever a time to be an
[6:00] expectation,
[6:02] it is [snorts] now. Now, in the
[6:03] handwriting of the wall, I better get
[6:04] going here. Amen. At the junction of
[6:08] each age, we've had several junctions of
[6:10] time. When time runs out, man's ability
[6:13] fades. We're not exempt from that. And
[6:15] as we would notice in the Antalovian
[6:17] destruction, now I just want to set a
[6:19] little background for what I want to
[6:21] bring to you in the Antalovian world
[6:23] after Cain and Abel and then Seth was
[6:25] raised up to take Abel's place
[6:27] representing the death, burial, and
[6:28] resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the just
[6:30] one. Man being to man began to spring
[6:34] out from these two boys. And if you'll
[6:36] notice, men become wise and smart, but
[6:39] the shrewdness never come through the
[6:40] side of Seth. All the scientists, all
[6:42] the smart, all the intelligent, all the
[6:44] educated men come through the side, the
[6:46] side of Cain because they'd eaten from
[6:48] the tree of knowledge, of course, but of
[6:50] good and evil. But the other side was a
[6:53] humble side. Now, I'll just want to
[6:55] throw this in just to
[6:58] when I was a young man, they said, "This
[7:01] is the reason why you shouldn't go to
[7:04] school and get any kind of education."
[7:09] And you know what it yielded?
[7:12] I'm sorry to put it this blunt.
[7:15] It yielded a bunch of unlearned,
[7:18] backslid
[7:20] children.
[7:22] their education or lack of did not
[7:24] affect one thing in their spiritual walk
[7:28] because they weren't taught to trust
[7:30] God.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; They trusted themselves anyway, which is
[7:34] the very thing that God was speaking
[7:38] against through the word.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Education's not of the devil. What
[7:43] you do with that education determines
[7:47] what the outcome will be.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:50] [snorts] And then it become a place
[7:51] where the world was full of great
[7:52] scientists became wicked yet religious.
[7:55] I want to focus on this. We'll touch on
[7:57] this in a minute. [snorts]
[7:58] Become wicked yet religious. There come
[8:00] a junction of time that God had to judge
[8:02] the sin. And when he did before his
[8:04] great judgment was passed, he sent
[8:06] prophets, angels, supernatural, great
[8:08] signs and wonders, then destruction.
[8:11] Sounds familiar. At the coming of the
[8:13] children of Israel, the church had
[8:15] cooled off. They had gone [snorts] down
[8:16] there to be masters of Egypt. and so
[8:19] forth. And they come and there come on
[8:21] the scene prophets, angels, message,
[8:23] supernatural, judgment to Egypt. In the
[8:25] days of the coming of the Lord Jesus,
[8:27] the church had cooled off again. Sin had
[8:30] set in the church. There come an angel
[8:33] and appeared to Zachcharias, a prophet
[8:35] cometh on the scene. Then the
[8:37] supernatural was done. Then judgment to
[8:39] Israel, and she was scattered to the
[8:41] four winds of the world. So this wasn't
[8:45] just an accident. People in history
[8:46] would say, you know, Israel, the reason
[8:50] they ended up in all these places of the
[8:51] world was they were chasing riches.
[8:53] Well, we won't deny that might in their
[8:55] mind might have been chasing riches, but
[8:57] it really was God scattering them
[9:00] &gt;&gt; because his word has to come to pass.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, look at this. Amen. And my
[9:07] most beloved friends, we're at another
[9:10] junction. We had 1500 years of dark ages
[9:13] in Catholicism. Along came Martin
[9:15] Luther, cooled off. Along come Wesley,
[9:17] cooled off. Along come the Baptist,
[9:19] cooled off. Along come Pentecost, cooled
[9:21] off. And it never went to a cooling off.
[9:24] It got lukewarm. And just before the
[9:27] great cooling off or lukewarmness of the
[9:29] Pentecostal church, there has come again
[9:32] on the scene the supernatural and
[9:34] prophets and great messages and the
[9:36] healing of the sick and the raising of
[9:39] the dead. It's God's signpost. We're at
[9:43] the end time. Now, this is not something
[9:45] we preach to make anyone scared. Amen. I
[9:49] don't look at the day on the calendar to
[9:51] be scared of what day of the week it is.
[9:54] I look at it so that I am informed of
[9:57] the time that I'm in. And this is what
[9:59] the word's doing. Some people say the
[10:01] message is there to scare you. My
[10:03] brother and sister, it is. Every day I
[10:06] look at the calendar realizing in a few
[10:08] days I owe the bank a whole bunch of
[10:10] money. Does that make me scared? No, it
[10:12] doesn't. I'm just informed.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; I'm informed. I'm not scared.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; My wife has the money to pay the bank. I
[10:21] don't have to worry about it. I'm
[10:23] informed.
[10:25] Amen. We're at the end time and the
[10:27] church is lukewarm, just cooling off and
[10:32] going away.
[10:35] Can we say amen to that?
[10:37] &gt;&gt; We look around the world.
[10:40] If I could just block in those next few
[10:43] words.
[10:44] It has
[10:46] &gt;&gt; to be
[10:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; that way. Don't be scared of that.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm afraid of being deceived. Don't
[10:54] be afraid of being deceived.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is not talking about you.
[11:00] Amen. You've been called of God. He
[11:01] holds a title deed to you. You don't
[11:04] have to worry about Satan running in and
[11:06] snatching it out of your hand. He holds
[11:09] the title deed. It's paid for.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got the blood of Jesus Christ
[11:14] paid in full upon it. God said it would
[11:17] be that way. But the warning is to him
[11:19] that has ears to hear, let him hear what
[11:23] Paul says to the church,
[11:26] what preacher here, pastor there, what
[11:29] the spirit.
[11:31] This is why we got to be in the word.
[11:33] This is why we got to do it. It's not
[11:35] going to be a man that saves us. My
[11:36] brother and sister, people have this
[11:38] idea if Brother Brandon was here today
[11:40] that the message churches would be
[11:42] entirely different. I say it would not
[11:44] be. It's going to take anointing of the
[11:46] Holy Spirit in our lives, anchor to know
[11:50] that we have been called in him before
[11:53] the foundation of the world. It will
[11:55] take that kind of revelation to hold us
[11:58] in this day.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Talking to a brother here just recently
[12:02] and he made a statement to me. He says
[12:04] Paul, he says, "Isn't it interesting?
[12:06] Many of the people that were around
[12:09] brother Brandham in those meetings in
[12:11] those days as young people," so they're
[12:13] still living today. Many of those young
[12:16] people have turned their back. They saw
[12:18] the supernatural. They saw the signs and
[12:20] wonders. They saw the miraculous.
[12:22] They've turned and walked away from it.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; And then we both agreed this scripture
[12:27] is true. Better having not seen
[12:32] &gt;&gt; but believed. Yes,
[12:34] &gt;&gt; there it is. Seeing it won't make us
[12:36] receive it.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; In fact, they got we were discussing
[12:40] this. They got confused. They got
[12:42] confused. They decided that brother
[12:44] Brandham was the answer.
[12:50] It was the word he brought us was the
[12:52] answer. But it was so supernatural, so
[12:55] incredible, so outstanding, so above and
[12:59] beyond that they missed that he was only
[13:02] a messenger
[13:06] and the messenger to the Leodysian age,
[13:11] not Jehovah,
[13:13] the messenger.
[13:15] So we come to a crossroad here, a
[13:18] junction.
[13:20] It hath ears to hear, let him hear what
[13:23] the spirit saith unto the churches.
[13:27] Okay,
[13:31] let me just hurry along here
[13:34] now. We're living saints in a time
[13:39] that people speak so openly, so
[13:43] incredibly about our Lord Jesus. You'll
[13:46] be in a conversation with someone and
[13:49] they're just like, "Oh, this this
[13:51] happened. The Lord was dealing with me.
[13:53] I I did this. The Lord told me to go
[13:55] over here." And these things are not
[13:56] dead ends, things they're being blessed.
[13:59] These are things that are coming to
[14:00] pass. They're saying, "Now, the Lord
[14:01] told me this and this and this and that
[14:04] come to pass and the Lord said this and
[14:06] come to pass." And if you're not
[14:07] careful, you're going to be thinking,
[14:09] "Man, the Lord doesn't do that for me.
[14:11] The Lord's not coming and waking me up
[14:13] in the midnight hours all the time and
[14:15] and telling me, "Go look at this
[14:17] scripture, this scripture, tie this to,
[14:18] and when you meet this, you know,
[14:20] red-headed man tomorrow, you tell him
[14:22] this, this, and this, and you don't know
[14:24] him. You don't know nothing about him,
[14:25] but he'll know that I'm speaking to
[14:27] him." Does that happen to us?
[14:33] Not often.
[14:35] I will say it has happened.
[14:40] And you sit there and you're a little
[14:41] stunned. You're like, "Wow."
[14:44] But then something sparks.
[14:50] But they're not
[14:52] living
[14:54] the word.
[15:00] Do you know, Brother Trevor, there's
[15:02] actually in the United States several
[15:04] prophecy schools that you can go attend
[15:07] classes to learn how to prophesy.
[15:10] Interesting.
[15:13] See where they're taking it?
[15:15] It's no longer a sovereign move of the
[15:17] Holy Spirit on your life, but now we're
[15:21] going to teach you how to tap in
[15:24] to those hidden things that God had,
[15:28] right? Brother Brandham talking about
[15:30] the first, second, third pole. He says,
[15:32] you know, I I explained it and they
[15:34] imitated it and I wish I wouldn't have.
[15:37] You know, the whole example of the
[15:38] fishing reel and that whole thing. See
[15:41] what happens is Satan's looking and when
[15:43] he recognizes that now trust me I'm not
[15:46] being critical of these people actually
[15:48] in this particular case my heart aches
[15:50] but they're talking about this
[15:51] miraculous stuff how God guided them
[15:53] over here and God guided them here and
[15:55] this happened and this happened and this
[15:57] happened and the Lord spoke to me and
[15:58] this happened
[16:01] Married multiple times their whole
[16:03] things about their lives are just don't
[16:05] line up with the word I'm not being
[16:06] judgmental I'm telling you this is why
[16:08] the prophet of God said it has to line
[16:11] up with the word because all of the lion
[16:14] vanities can cause prophecies to take
[16:16] place and people to speak as though they
[16:18] were face to face, lip to ear with God.
[16:21] But they don't live out the word.
[16:24] I'd rather be silent my whole life
[16:27] [snorts] and be living the word. Because
[16:30] you see, we see this in the word, my
[16:33] brother and sister. Remember,
[16:38] speak less, live more. I read this I
[16:41] read this comment the other day and it
[16:42] struck me. Speak less, live more. Let
[16:46] your life speak for itself.
[16:49] I was like, there it is. Reshaping
[16:53] different words of what we already know.
[16:55] But there it is. Speak less, live more.
[16:58] You don't have to go out here and say,
[17:00] "I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian. I'm a
[17:02] Christian."
[17:03] They'll see you're different.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; And pretty soon they'll figure out.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; They're not a Buddhist.
[17:10] They're not this. They're not that.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Huh? Must be one of those religious
[17:16] fanatics.
[17:18] It's a little shocking when someone
[17:20] comes up to you and asks you a question
[17:21] like that. So, Paul, are you one of
[17:25] those religious fanatics?
[17:28] You know, I'm glad my reaction was what
[17:30] it was. I stuck my hand out and said,
[17:31] "Glad to meet you."
[17:33] &gt;&gt; Why, my brother and sister, you're going
[17:35] to be identified with something.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Let's be identified with Jesus Christ.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need to be ashamed of
[17:41] that. He's done something supernatural
[17:44] in our lives. This is not just some
[17:46] common little thing that happened. We
[17:48] stumbled over it. It's not like you went
[17:50] into the five and dime store and found a
[17:52] bargain somewhere. This is God coming
[17:55] down pouring his mystery of who he is,
[17:58] of his will, pouring it into you and I.
[18:01] It ought to be something we rejoice
[18:03] about. Amen. Satan shouldn't be able to
[18:05] take that victory from us. Amen. And
[18:08] that's exactly what it is, a victory.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, as we look, you see, our
[18:15] lives are not a secret.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; We were called to fulfill the word for
[18:19] the world to see it. Amen. [snorts]
[18:21] Remember now, brother Brandon preaching
[18:23] about the queen of the south, how she
[18:25] come and that she would judge. Amen. Her
[18:29] life would judge. She traveled all that
[18:32] way because she wanted truth. She wanted
[18:35] the word. And brother Brown then goes
[18:39] and now we won't even cross the street.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[18:42] &gt;&gt; See how see how what's happened in our
[18:44] day. Now, don't misunderstand me. I
[18:47] understand circumstances. I understand
[18:49] that we live in a complicated world.
[18:51] Amen. [snorts] I know some churches we
[18:53] visit, they work shift work, you know,
[18:56] work in factories at night. They don't
[18:58] dictate that, but that's the only good
[19:00] job in their community. And so, it comes
[19:02] a time they can't be in church. Amen.
[19:04] But you look at that and realize that
[19:06] God looks on the heart.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; And if we can and we don't, then God
[19:10] knows that also.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; And so, it's there. Look at this. Now,
[19:14] when their eyes were open, Amen. Let's
[19:16] just go through this real quick so we
[19:18] can done. How many read this sermon when
[19:20] the omnipotent speaks miracles happen?
[19:23] Did you you believe that? Certainly. Omn
[19:26] omnipotent spoke at every junction. At
[19:31] every junction,
[19:35] every junction.
[19:38] An omnipotent God come down to every You
[19:42] guys are on the front row. [laughter]
[19:46] At every junction, Sister Carrie,
[19:49] there was an omnipotent voice
[19:53] speaking.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Man, that just makes my heart just just
[19:57] stir. It makes it bubble. It's like I
[20:00] didn't just happen to come here. I
[20:02] didn't just happen to do this. I just
[20:04] didn't happen to. An omnip omnipotent
[20:07] voice was speaking at every junction
[20:11] of our life.
[20:15] And yet we'd sat here today and say, "I
[20:17] sure don't feel special." Well, the
[20:20] devil might be just lying to you. Or
[20:22] maybe God's allowing the devil to dig up
[20:26] your garden.
[20:29] Might be that season,
[20:31] &gt;&gt; you know, and then God's going to put
[20:34] his sunlight on that. And that
[20:36] sunlight's going to cause a change in
[20:39] us. And that change is going to be for
[20:41] our good. Amen.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; God's not going to allow the devil to
[20:45] destroy you.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; He's not going to allow it to destroy
[20:48] your relationship with him, your
[20:49] relationship and the body of believers,
[20:52] relationships in and period. Amen. It's
[20:55] not going to allow him to destroy that.
[20:57] He will allow go for a season because
[20:59] God knows it's going to mold our
[21:01] character and when we come out of that,
[21:02] we'll be stronger for who we are. Amen.
[21:05] But at the moment, no correction seems
[21:08] good. [snorts] And this junction
[21:13] and this is the junction of all
[21:15] junctions. This is the end time. The end
[21:18] of the whole history of the world is
[21:20] right now at hand. You can expect
[21:22] omnipotence to speak.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[21:26] &gt;&gt; We can expect omnipotence to speak. That
[21:30] should be our approach to come into the
[21:32] house of God. It's going to speak.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; I believe it. You can expect the
[21:38] greatest
[21:40] and mightiest miracles that's ever
[21:42] happened on the earth will happen in the
[21:44] next few years to come. If Jesus
[21:46] terries, it will be. Then watch for
[21:49] Satan. See, now look at this. We can
[21:51] draw this line. Let me just cut this off
[21:53] for a moment. We need to believe that
[21:55] when God is speaking to us, he is
[21:58] speaking to us, right?
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We hear God's voice. He's He's
[22:02] causing us. We read scripture. It stirs
[22:04] our heart. It speaks to us. Amen. And we
[22:06] come and we get we get excited and we
[22:08] look at little things and see how
[22:10] suddenly this and this tie together.
[22:12] Amen. So omnipotence and omnipotent God
[22:14] is speaking to his people.
[22:17] And then brother Brandham comes right
[22:18] behind that. Oh, it would have been so
[22:20] good just to left it in the glorious
[22:22] realm. Oh, praise God. Omnipotence is
[22:25] speaking. Oh, praise God. God is
[22:28] speaking to us. Brother Brandham comes
[22:29] along and says, "Hey, let me just kind
[22:30] of bring you back down to earth just a
[22:33] tad bit." Amen. Then watch for Satan to
[22:39] raise up his too.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; You ever notice the cycle of Christian
[22:44] life?
[22:46] We talk about it. Praise God. I was on
[22:49] the mountaintop. It was so glorious.
[22:53] I saw the sun rising. I saw the sun set.
[22:58] I saw the beauty, the majesty of God.
[23:03] How did I get in this valley?
[23:06] Lord, hast thou forsaken me?
[23:10] What did I do wrong? Are you punishing
[23:11] me, Lord? Did I fail you?
[23:15] Am I even? I'm not preaching to you. I'm
[23:18] preaching to people like you. And one of
[23:20] those people like you is named Paul.
[23:22] Amen. Lord, are you mad at me?
[23:30] [clears throat]
[23:32] Then we realize,
[23:34] watch for Satan to raise up his too.
[23:37] When all heaven turns loose,
[23:41] all hell turns loose.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[23:44] &gt;&gt; too.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Do we know what he's talking about?
[23:48] &gt;&gt; We do.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; We'll see it. We are not exempt, saints.
[23:52] Don't let the devil beat you as though
[23:54] you're some sort of failure. And that's
[23:57] why you're in this valley in the
[23:59] condition things are right now. Amen.
[24:02] It's because all of hell. Amen. Now
[24:04] look, maybe I'm taking too much in these
[24:06] words, but where I come from, the word
[24:08] all meant everything.
[24:11] So everything that hell has has been
[24:14] turned loose against you
[24:17] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want you to get back
[24:19] on that mountaintop. He wants to keep
[24:21] you down there in that valley where it's
[24:23] littered with big boulders and cliffs
[24:25] and all kinds of things that you can't
[24:27] deal with. Amen. But look at this now.
[24:30] You'll know when all hell turns loose
[24:32] that heaven has turned loose, too. Let's
[24:34] make the decision. Which one are we
[24:36] going to receive tonight? Amen. Which
[24:38] one are we going to claim? Which one are
[24:39] we going to possess? Am I going to say
[24:41] all hell is broke loose and my life is
[24:43] out of control and everything is ruined
[24:45] or am I going to turn my EYES TO GLORY
[24:48] AND SAY LORD IF THE DEVIL IS LOOSE
[24:51] ROARING LIKE A LION THAT MEANS YOU ARE
[24:53] LOOSE HERE TOO AND I'M LOOKING TO YOU
[24:56] LORD YOU ARE THE GOD OF MY SALVATION THE
[24:59] GOD OF MY DELIVERANCE THE GOD OF
[25:01] EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE AND I'M NOT GOING
[25:03] TO LOOK AT HELL I'M SORRY YOUNG PEOPLE
[25:06] I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK AT HELL HELL'S
[25:08] UGLY HELL DESTROYS
[25:10] HELL IS LIKE A CANCER, BUT I'M GOING TO
[25:12] LOOK AT THE REDEEMER AND I KNOW MY
[25:15] REDEEMER LIVETH AND I KNOW HE HAS CALLED
[25:17] ME. I KNOW THAT HE'S GOT THAT OPEN BOOK
[25:20] STANDING THERE AND MY NAME IS ON THAT
[25:23] PAGE. SATAN, I'M SORRY. YOU WASTED YOUR
[25:26] TIME BECAUSE MY NAME IS ON THAT BOOK.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; I haven't seen IT WITH MY EYES, BUT I'VE
[25:33] SEEN IT IN my spirit. I've seen it by
[25:35] revelation.
[25:37] [snorts] Amen.
[25:39] Hallelujah. It's prophesied there'd be
[25:41] Jane Janus and Jambre on the earth in
[25:44] the last days who would almost
[25:46] impersonate the real thing so close to
[25:49] deceive the very elect if possible. Now,
[25:51] I'm [snorts] going to speak real direct
[25:52] to this. There's way too many people
[25:55] around this message that are scared to
[25:58] death. They're going to be deceived.
[26:02] Come on. said it would deceive the very
[26:06] elect.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not changing the word. Don't
[26:11] misunderstand me. But we can put a solid
[26:15] period right there
[26:17] because
[26:19] we cannot be deceived.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; That's what the word said. If we can be
[26:25] deceived, my brother and sister, after
[26:26] God has poured all of the revelation of
[26:29] his word, which is himself, right,
[26:31] revealing himself, and then he would
[26:33] stand back as an angry God and just let
[26:36] you step off the great abyss into hell.
[26:43] That doesn't go with what brother Brown
[26:45] said when he said, "Even if I knew I was
[26:50] going to hell,
[26:51] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[26:52] &gt;&gt; I would serve him. Anyway,
[26:54] &gt;&gt; anyway,
[26:55] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; There is what shows what the very spirit
[26:59] or nature of God is.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; That it wouldn't be, well, I'll just go
[27:04] live in your way because I I'm I'm lost
[27:07] anyway. For one, that's the devil
[27:09] talking. Amen. And when you have a firm
[27:12] revelation of who you are in the word,
[27:15] Amen. the devil's never going to stop
[27:17] talking.
[27:19] Now, I don't want to go into this
[27:20] because it can go a long ways, but I'll
[27:22] just put it this way. Some of us might
[27:25] not be so spiritual as others, cuz some
[27:28] of us wake up in the middle of the night
[27:30] to find the devil tapping on the
[27:34] nightstand.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Sir,
[27:35] &gt;&gt; I want to talk to you. I want to tell
[27:38] you about every mistake you ever made. I
[27:40] want to tell you that your chances of
[27:42] making the rapture are zero.
[27:49] and you can't fall asleep because
[27:54] he's there. You're going to talk to me
[27:57] or we'll just have a one-sided
[27:59] conversation.
[28:00] Remember when you were 14? Remember when
[28:03] you were 21? Remember when you were 28?
[28:06] Remember when you were 40? Remember when
[28:09] And I'm sorry, Satan.
[28:12] My Lord's over here saying, "What sin?"
[28:15] That's right.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Are you talking about
[28:19] &gt;&gt; whose voice tonight, saints, would we
[28:22] choose to listen to?
[28:23] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; The one
[28:26] &gt;&gt; that has turned all of heaven loose to
[28:28] bless you and I
[28:30] &gt;&gt; or the one who's turned all hell loose
[28:33] to destroy us. We're at that junction.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; We're seeing, now I don't want to speak
[28:39] negative here, please, but we're seeing
[28:41] that coming to pass. I used to think
[28:45] this this certain person been around the
[28:47] message for 40 years. If I could just be
[28:49] like them. They're on wife number three
[28:52] and they're a drunk now.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; I'm glad God didn't allow me to be like
[28:56] them.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't say go be like brother
[28:59] so and so. God said be like me.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's our answer. Don't be
[29:03] looking to somebody else thinking
[29:04] they're all spiritual. They're all wise.
[29:06] They got answers to our problems. Our
[29:08] answers are in the word.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not in a man, not a wise man, not
[29:14] a skilled man, not an educated man.
[29:17] Whatever it is, our answer is in the
[29:19] word. We get in the word, we'll find our
[29:21] answer.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, [snorts]
[29:25] we're looking for all of that. Amen. Let
[29:28] me just go on a little bit. [snorts]
[29:30] Amen.
[29:32] See, now I want to bring this out once
[29:34] again, this out of the quote. So, you
[29:38] can expect omnipotence to speak. You can
[29:40] expect the greatest and mightiest
[29:42] miracles has ever happened on the earth
[29:45] will happen in the next few years to
[29:47] come. If Jesus terries, it will be.
[29:54] What's the next few years?
[29:59] [snorts]
[30:00] Next few years.
[30:02] Well, there's a quote there. You've
[30:04] probably read it. Brother Brown said,
[30:06] "Lord might tar for a hundred." That's
[30:08] right.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; And he says here, next few years.
[30:12] Is this a contradiction?
[30:14] &gt;&gt; No. Next few might be a hundred.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; But what's time got to do with you and
[30:21] I?
[30:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; We are eternal beings in Jesus Christ.
[30:25] Sister Vikica, will you come? Amen.
[30:28] Let's not let the devil Amen. bring us
[30:31] to our junction and cause us like Israel
[30:34] to stop and say, "I think it'll be
[30:37] easier to turn and go back." Now, I want
[30:41] to be real graphic and I want to be
[30:42] graphic for a purpose because you see,
[30:45] there was that generation that was
[30:46] ordained to go into the promised land.
[30:49] Now, can you imagine, take this to any
[30:52] person, any place, any way you want to
[30:54] do it, but can you imagine you're now
[30:58] with the family unit
[31:01] and you're in the wilderness
[31:04] and there's been a person in your life
[31:05] called grandpa.
[31:08] He's always been there. He's always been
[31:10] strong. He's always been an example.
[31:13] But grandpa allowed himself to get under
[31:15] an anointing. And when he should have
[31:17] said amen to the word and stepped
[31:20] forward to possess a promise,
[31:23] he was maybe looking over at brother so
[31:27] and so to see if brother so and so says
[31:31] amen.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; So when he should have said amen to the
[31:35] word, he let another man's influence.
[31:40] Now here's a younger generation. We
[31:42] understand the word. Amen.
[31:45] and they're walking through the
[31:47] wilderness
[31:49] and they see grandpa stumble
[31:54] and they see grandpa
[31:56] get all dizzy
[31:59] and they see grandpa lay down and die
[32:02] right there.
[32:07] God's promise must not have been true.
[32:10] My brother and sister, the promise is
[32:12] true
[32:13] &gt;&gt; to everyone who will believe.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a matter about grandpa,
[32:18] grandma, this preacher, that preacher,
[32:21] this church, or that church. It's you
[32:25] and the promise. Amen. And when they
[32:28] stood there as young people remembering
[32:30] Joshua's words
[32:33] and realizing,
[32:35] I have to go possess the land. I have
[32:38] to. They went into the land [music] and
[32:42] we'll see this. You know the story.
[32:44] Caleb's daughter,
[32:46] she's already married and she comes one
[32:49] day and says, "You know what, Dad? I
[32:52] have a promise.
[32:56] [snorts]
[32:58] But I don't want just the lower spring."
[33:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; I want to really be blessed of God. I
[33:06] want the deep high revelations of God. I
[33:09] want the low revelations of God. I want
[33:13] this to [music] be the land that was
[33:16] given to me to not just be a message
[33:20] believer. [music]
[33:23] &gt;&gt; But to come to a junction where I can
[33:25] stand and say, "My God delivers.
[33:29] My God is real. My God is true. My God
[33:32] is faithful." Had nothing to do with
[33:34] Joshua. But Joshua spoke the words that
[33:37] encouraged them. Had nothing to do with
[33:39] Caleb, but Caleb gave the promise to his
[33:43] family and they believed it. When we
[33:47] come to our junction, saints, no matter
[33:49] what that junction is in our life, Amen.
[33:52] [music] Make sure Christ is in that
[33:55] decision. Christ [snorts] is in that
[33:58] junction of [music] our life. Amen.
[34:00] Hallelujah. Amen. Is it good to be in
[34:03] the house of the Lord tonight? [snorts]
[34:05] Hallelujah. [music] Amen. I think I
[34:09] preached all of this. Got way ahead of
[34:10] myself. Just really got confused. Isn't
[34:12] that terrible? [snorts] Oh my.
[34:15] Hallelujah.
[34:18] Amen. Let's just stand, sing a song or
[34:20] two if you don't mind. Amen. Right here
[34:23] in my notes, it says, "Rise up in our
[34:25] expectation for the omnip omnipotent to
[34:28] speak." Amen. Can we tonight [music]
[34:31] just bring ourselves to a place to have
[34:33] expectation? God's going to do great
[34:35] things for us. Amen. [music] He's not
[34:38] just coming to bless us a little here
[34:40] and bless us a little there. You you you
[34:43] know this story about brother Brandham
[34:44] talking about the the the firemen.
[34:46] [music]
[34:48] You [snorts] know that that they were
[34:49] there, you know, the little country fire
[34:51] department, the fire, and they're
[34:52] squirting a little here, [music]
[34:54] squirting a little there. And then here
[34:57] come that trained city department.
[34:59] [music] The captain got out and said,
[35:01] "Run a hose over here. Put a ladder
[35:03] there. Do this."
[35:07] You want a view of that story a little
[35:09] bit deeper?
[35:12] God's not running through here putting
[35:14] just a little bit of the Holy Spirit out
[35:17] here
[35:19] and a little here.
[35:21] God's got a fire hose of his [music]
[35:23] spirit.
[35:25] Amen. Look, natural fire, spiritual
[35:29] fire. Amen. We're not here to put it
[35:31] out. We're here to let it go. Let go and
[35:34] let God have his way. Amen. God [music]
[35:37] bless you. Trust that we're okay
[35:39] tonight. Amen. [snorts] Hallelujah.
[35:43] Amen. Well, I'd like to sing that song,
[35:45] I shall not be moved. [snorts] Amen.
[35:49] You know, I always have kind of made a
[35:50] little bit light of that and that when
[35:52] I've said about that, you know, the guy
[35:54] with the grumpy voice, I shall not be
[35:56] moved because that related back to a
[35:58] real experience I had with a gentleman
[36:00] many years ago. And I come to him, I
[36:03] laid out the word of God. I didn't even
[36:04] bring the message to him. Said he was a
[36:08] message believer. I didn't even bring
[36:09] the message to him. I brought scripture
[36:10] [music] to him. And he told me, "I will
[36:13] not be moved from my position." And it
[36:16] struck me. There it is. There it is.
[36:19] [music] Lord, move me. I'm taking my
[36:21] hands off. Lord, move me. I want to be
[36:24] moved, Lord, wherever you want me to be.
[36:26] But when it comes to my faith in you, I
[36:29] shall not be moved. Amen. Hallelujah.
[36:32] Well, Jesus is my savior. I shall not be
[36:37] moved. [singing]
[36:38] I'm in his love and favor. I shall not
