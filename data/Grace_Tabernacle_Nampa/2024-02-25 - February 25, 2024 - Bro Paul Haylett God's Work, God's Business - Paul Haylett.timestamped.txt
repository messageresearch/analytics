[16:10] me from Heaven that it's going to be
[16:14] okay
[16:15] so the Lord did work out what I was
[16:18] going through and blessed me through it

[40:15] visit us again and um so just lift them
[40:18] up in prayers as they're up there in CIS
[40:20] spell kind of by themselves and you know
[40:24] sometimes you know we just uh our dear
[40:27] sweet little epha we just want to
[40:29] remember her she just came see going in
[40:32] this cycle of feeling better and then uh
[40:35] you know having pretty high fevers um
[40:38] and so just please a special prayer and
[40:42] uh I say this with a bit of humor um we
[40:45] don't often announce birthdays but uh
[40:47] sister Carrie has undesignated number uh
[40:51] that uh has come up almost like a
[40:54] lottery or something it just popped up
[40:56] and
[40:57] anyway you know it's just good it's just
[40:59] good you know we're going to grow old
[41:01] anyway we might as well grow old serving
[41:03] the lord amen hallelujah amen thank you
[41:08] Lord I want to speak to you today uh
[41:10] it's kind of on the topic once again
[41:13] stepping out you know I think that we
[41:15] really need to step out my brother and
[41:17] sister Satan if he would uh would uh box
[41:21] Us in now I know this doesn't sound real
[41:23] spiritual but I hope you'll catch the
[41:25] significance behind it I was just uh
[41:27] looking into the life of a gentleman uh
[41:30] and it's not really about the money made
[41:32] but just the point uh that he he tried
[41:35] to start several businesses through his
[41:38] life and uh I think bankrupt four
[41:41] different times things just failed and
[41:45] uh he was 71 years old and um he had a
[41:50] whole different approach to business he
[41:53] decided at that age that he was going to
[41:55] do this work not to make himself rich
[41:59] but he was going to do this work because
[42:01] it was something he had a passion for
[42:03] and at 71 years old he founded a company
[42:06] that went on to gross him hundreds of
[42:09] millions of dollars and uh the reason I
[42:12] bring that up is um it's never too late
[42:16] to get on fire to serve God never too
[42:19] late for us to say I'm all in and I'm
[42:22] not going to do it because I get to go
[42:24] to heaven I'm going to do it because I
[42:25] get to serve the Lord amen and that
[42:28] really should be the whole Foundation or
[42:30] fundamental for us is Lord I just want
[42:33] to serve you you know the marriage vow
[42:36] says in sickness and in health for
[42:39] richer for poor I wished we could apply
[42:42] that as much to our
[42:44] spiritual as we could to the Natural and
[42:47] uh God help us today I want to talk to
[42:49] you about God's work God's business amen
[42:53] let's turn to our Bibles in Psalms the 1
[42:55] chapter:
[42:59] 1-6 and I tell you this morning I I just
[43:02] will be unabashed to tell you that I
[43:05] want to be blessed amen I I look uh uh
[43:09] in the natural we look at this and the
[43:11] scripture says that if we would just
[43:13] follow these things that the lord has
[43:15] laid that he would bless uh the work of
[43:18] our hands he would bless our families
[43:21] all this and uh I I just not ashamed to
[43:24] tell you I want to be blessed but I put
[43:26] the measure of spiritual blessing far
[43:29] above all else amen because if we are
[43:32] rich and know not the Lord then we have
[43:35] accomplished nothing amen blessed is the
[43:38] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[43:40] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[43:43] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[43:46] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[43:49] of the Lord and in his law doth he
[43:51] meditate day and night and he shall be
[43:54] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[43:56] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[43:59] his season his Leaf also shall not
[44:02] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[44:05] prosper the ungodly are not so but are
[44:08] like the chaff With the Wind driveth
[44:10] away therefore the ungodly shall not
[44:12] stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the
[44:15] congregation of the righteous for the
[44:17] Lord knoweth the way of right of the
[44:19] righteous but the way of the ungodly
[44:22] Shall Perish Heavenly Father we thank
[44:24] you for this opportunity to come
[44:26] together Lord Saints of like Precious
[44:29] Faith father we just lift up each and
[44:31] every brother sister young and old
[44:33] father for this little natural sickness
[44:36] that is upon the land just keeps coming
[44:38] around but father you're our healer and
[44:41] we believe in that and father we speak
[44:43] forth the words of Life Lord let healing
[44:46] virtue flow through this body of

[44:50] each one young and old father that we
[44:53] can stand be in the house of God in
[44:55] strength strength father and Lord truly
[44:57] I lay upon my heart today because we
[44:59] have had the sniffles and these things
[45:02] Lord we haven't been to see our brother
[45:04] Bob sister Joanne but father our heart
[45:07] is there with them Lord we just ask you
[45:10] father just to touch them Lord and
[45:12] father it is a season your word says
[45:14] that we've been called to and we know
[45:17] father Lord that that in that time
[45:20] designated by you Lord that you would
[45:22] call us home and Lord it is a heart's
[45:24] desire each and every one of us I
[45:26] believe to be those that are alive and
[45:28] remain at the coming of Our Lord but
[45:30] father we just commit these things to
[45:32] your hand that your will be done father
[45:35] we thank you for the grace and mercy and
[45:37] the testimony of those around us our
[45:39] sister rler father for all the struggles
[45:42] of Life Lord Jesus she has stood all
[45:45] these years father and she has been
[45:48] faithful father and we just ask you Lord
[45:50] Jesus what your heart's desire is for
[45:53] her Lord this coming of a natural
[45:55] Crossing father Lord it is not to be
[45:58] feared but it is to be rejoiced father
[46:01] that we get to come into your presence
[46:03] and the thing that we have labored and
[46:05] longed for all these years father coming
[46:08] to fruition but still in our flesh Lord
[46:11] we we have sorrow father for these Lord
[46:14] as our families pass over our parents
[46:17] pass over lord there's a sorrow within
[46:20] us in the natural but Lord there is a
[46:22] joy that is down in our soul to know
[46:24] they have run the race and they have
[46:26] been faithful and all we can do is say
[46:29] thank you Lord thank you very much Lord
[46:32] father for you have placed a great host
[46:34] of witnesses before us Lord and we thank
[46:37] you for that bless this day I pray in
[46:40] the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[46:53] seated you know as we would look through
[46:55] this
[46:56] this we we recognize that we would not
[46:59] be able to even stand a single day in
[47:02] the age that we live in without the Lord
[47:04] at our sign Satan has come as a roaring
[47:07] lion he has come great influence we look
[47:10] in the world today my brother and sister
[47:12] and everything that has been prophesied
[47:15] is coming to pass and I for one don't
[47:18] personally keep a scorecard as it were
[47:20] of what has and hasn't but we see the
[47:22] word of God is coming to pass being
[47:25] fulfilled in the day that we live in and
[47:27] I think that we sometimes fail to
[47:29] recognize just exactly how blessed we
[47:32] have been to be called in this day and
[47:35] it is not something that we were just on
[47:37] the end of the list but my brother and
[47:39] sister it is actually according to
[47:41] scripture quite the opposite that we are
[47:44] coming down to Herald the Fulfillment of
[47:46] the word the full manifestation of the
[47:49] word for the age and not only this age
[47:52] but all the other ages before it that
[47:55] scripture say says that they without us
[47:57] could not be made perfect and I desire
[47:59] to be perfect in the eyes of the Lord
[48:02] and I know that there are saints that
[48:04] are uh passed on before father before
[48:07] the father and they are rooting for us
[48:09] as it were that they want to see us rise
[48:12] up in Victory now my brother and sister
[48:15] as I brought this out I think it's
[48:17] wonderful that we are here today to be
[48:20] able to prosper naturally it is the
[48:22] scripture says good for a man to be able
[48:25] to be a partaker of the fruit of his
[48:27] labor and so it is not that we would
[48:30] look at that as a significant Mark but
[48:33] it is just a blessing that God allows
[48:35] upon our lives and we look in the word
[48:38] and see as the Apostle Paul spoke so
[48:41] clearly that it is not here and now that
[48:44] we live for but it is to be in the
[48:47] presence of God but if we're going to be
[48:49] here our hearts are yearning for there
[48:52] and it is that we are in this condition
[48:55] and this place right now to fulfill the
[48:58] word of God so we know that our passing
[49:00] from this life cannot take place until
[49:03] our work is finished and it is uh
[49:07] sometimes a a little bit uh hard for us
[49:10] as humans I think it is a natural
[49:13] tendency that we take the word of God
[49:16] sometimes and and feel like we we need
[49:18] to bring this to pass we need to do
[49:21] these things and and we can make
[49:23] something happen but my brother sister I
[49:26] believe that we need to catch the fact
[49:29] this is God's work he's the one that
[49:31] laid the foundation for it he's the one
[49:33] that knows the purpose for it it is not
[49:35] of our own doing nor can we fulfill the
[49:38] word of God in and of ourself but it is
[49:41] the word of God coming to pass
[49:43] nonetheless and I would just like to
[49:46] point out in verse five real quick here
[49:49] it says therefore the ungodly shall not
[49:51] stand in the Judgment now my brother and
[49:54] sister the ungodly do stand in the
[49:56] Judgment but you have to go into the
[49:58] root of what this is that it is there my
[50:01] brother and sister the ungodly will not
[50:03] come into the judgment and walk out
[50:06] unscathed they will not walk out in
[50:10] their condition that they entered into
[50:12] the Judgment but Sons and Daughters of
[50:14] God have come as the prophet of God
[50:16] teaches us and I thank you for that Lord
[50:19] because there is so much in denomination
[50:22] today that is laying a root on just pure
[50:25] Grace live any way you want God will
[50:27] pour His grace on you but this word of
[50:29] God this work that he has called you and
[50:31] I to he has given us strength to fulfill
[50:34] the word amen not to have a bypass not
[50:37] to have an excuse not to have a way
[50:39] around but my brother and sister it is
[50:42] that God said no I'm going to take you
[50:44] through the fire and I'm not even going
[50:46] to let the smell of smoke rest upon you
[50:49] now when we come into the Judgment my
[50:51] brother and sister I believe every one
[50:53] of us would have you might say an
[50:55] apprehension that would be there Lord am
[50:58] I fulfilling the word am I doing what I
[51:01] should be doing help me Lord I want to
[51:04] but my brother and sister when you take
[51:05] the principle of scripture and that laid
[51:08] out my brother and sister you will come
[51:10] through the fighter of judgment without
[51:12] even the smell of smoke upon you and so
[51:15] God is preparing you and I to be able to
[51:17] SP stand in this day and the ungodly
[51:20] they're not going to still be standing
[51:21] after the Judgment my brother and sister
[51:23] their Position will not remain steady
[51:26] their Position will not be carried on
[51:29] but they will be judged by the word of
[51:31] God and it is there I say thank you Lord
[51:34] that you would judge us now that we
[51:36] could now walk with confidence into the
[51:39] Judgment now Isaiah 55 it tells us here
[51:44] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[51:47] amen look at that my brother and sister
[51:49] there's no way that you and I can truly
[51:52] comprehend the mind of God we have an
[51:55] understanding of that we have a a
[51:58] revelation that's been given us but when
[52:00] we are in the presence of God I I I'll
[52:03] brand this as opinion so that if you
[52:05] look at it slightly different maybe
[52:07] you're looking at the ears and I'm
[52:09] looking at the tail I don't know but you
[52:11] look at that my brother and sister we
[52:13] are trying to quantify God by our
[52:16] thinking we're trying to to put
[52:19] ourselves into this body of Believers
[52:22] often times by our thinking and it is
[52:25] there that we have the idea that God's
[52:28] going to judge here and judge there and
[52:31] this is how it's going to be well I tell
[52:33] you our thoughts are not God's thoughts
[52:36] amen and our ways are not his ways amen
[52:40] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[52:42] neither are your ways my ways sayith the
[52:45] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[52:47] the earth so are my ways higher than
[52:49] your ways and my thoughts than your
[52:51] thoughts isn't this amazing sometimes we
[52:54] try to step out and by revelation we can
[52:57] to a degree and explain what we think
[53:00] God must be meaning but my brother and
[53:03] sister I would much rather by God's
[53:05] grace just step into the word and let
[53:07] the word be what the word was intended
[53:10] to be just let it come to pass and by
[53:12] Revelation let the Lord open our eyes to
[53:16] what he sees and how he wants it done
[53:18] and how he's moving people my brother
[53:20] and sister you can look I didn't bring
[53:22] all these quotes and and things to talk
[53:24] about this but you look and there were
[53:27] those there was a time in the Tabernacle
[53:29] where there was strife and there was
[53:30] struggle and there were those that had
[53:32] went off and started churches and there
[53:34] were those that had some different
[53:36] little points of view and they were
[53:38] starting to call people buzzards and
[53:40] starting to call them blackbirds and
[53:42] starting to be very uh critical of that
[53:46] and the prophet of God says don't you do
[53:48] that those are our brothers amen now you
[53:51] could be sitting there and be saying but
[53:53] but they are maybe over like here and
[53:55] over there but you see God sees the end
[53:58] from the beginning all we see is what is
[54:01] before us we see some that seem to be
[54:03] drifting away but we see some that are
[54:05] being pulled in and my brother and
[54:07] sister it's all in God's time amen it
[54:10] might be that we have passed from this
[54:12] life and God will still be doing the
[54:14] work God will still be moving God will
[54:16] still be bringing things to pass and we
[54:19] have to stop and say now is this
[54:21] according to my thinking my ideas or
[54:23] what I'm sure is this is what the
[54:26] prophet meant or do we stop and say Lord
[54:29] let me Focus back to myself let me be a
[54:32] living epistle let me be an example that
[54:36] they could look to and say you know what
[54:38] there is a better way to live there is a
[54:40] better life to live there is a position
[54:43] for me and so it is that we see how this
[54:46] is where our thoughts for as high for as
[54:49] the heavens are higher than the earth so
[54:51] are my ways higher than your ways amen
[54:54] and anybody know how far it is
[54:57] from here to
[55:00] there a professor once asked a graduate
[55:03] students as they're talking about time
[55:05] and space and the speed of light the
[55:08] speed of sound and he just throws that
[55:11] out right in the middle of a a uh a
[55:13] speech if you call it whatever they call
[55:15] it a a you know he's there and he says
[55:17] you know how how far is it from here to
[55:20] there and some students lifted their
[55:22] hands thinking they had an answer
[55:26] but my brother and sister God's ways are
[55:29] so much higher than our ways higher amen
[55:33] as it is as the scripture says amen is
[55:36] the heavens well where do the heavens
[55:38] start science actually has a point that
[55:41] they declare that the heavens
[55:43] start but is that God point is that
[55:46] where God said the heavens start that's
[55:48] where science says when the atmosphere
[55:50] is too thin to live in they say that's
[55:54] where the Heavens
[55:56] start but my brother and sister the
[55:59] heavens are wherever God said they are
[56:01] not what science said it was and so it's
[56:04] just showing very symbolically that we
[56:07] have no way to even measure how much
[56:11] higher the heavens are than this is that
[56:14] than our ways are and so as the rain
[56:17] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[56:19] returneth not thither I need to slow
[56:21] down I'm just racing along here G
[56:27] ging but WTH the Earth and maketh it
[56:30] bring forth and Bud that it may give
[56:32] seed to the sewer and bread to the eater
[56:34] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[56:37] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[56:41] void but it shall accomplish that which
[56:44] I please and it shall prosper in the
[56:46] thing where to I sent it now I want you
[56:50] to catch that it's going to accomplish
[56:53] what he pleased and and it will
[56:56] prosper the very pinpoint thing this
[57:00] gospel may seem like a shotgun
[57:03] approach but it's actually pinpoint
[57:13] accuracy when you're there dealing with
[57:17] people and God anoints it that the words
[57:20] be spoken to be the very words that are
[57:25] they
[57:26] circulating in their own
[57:29] mind might be easier to say well you
[57:32] know that that was there it's a prophet
[57:35] he can discern that but what is it when
[57:37] God uses just plain old everyday
[57:40] people and can speak so clearly through
[57:43] plain old Everyday
[57:47] People God putting it right to a purpose
[57:51] amen and then he prospers that purpose
[57:55] so as we look at this I just want to go
[57:57] on here today
[57:59] just now in the sermon this is sermon
[58:03] I've been studying uh brother brandham
[58:05] in the message then Jesus came and
[58:07] called he talks a lot about uh uh very
[58:11] various things but a lot about Lazarus
[58:14] Martha and Mary but look right
[58:18] here Luther had the evidence of his age
[58:21] Wesley of his age Pentecost of its age
[58:24] but we're in another age now my brother
[58:26] and sister we can call this the eighth
[58:28] day we can call it the bride's age but
[58:31] I'm telling you this is the age of the
[58:33] culmination of the word of God of the
[58:36] ages it is the finished time this is
[58:40] when the wheat is in the maturity stage
[58:43] in the presence of the sun we can look
[58:46] and see how these things are coming to
[58:48] pass and God is is bringing this so
[58:51] clearly now my brother and sister you go
[58:54] out here to today and you will find many
[58:57] I I've been studying on this and you'll
[58:59] find many uh churches use almost the
[59:02] same
[59:03] vocabulary that that we have around the
[59:06] message I I'm I guess a little bit
[59:08] prejudiced I believe that there's more
[59:10] of these denominations studying the
[59:12] message than they're ever willing to uh
[59:15] admit to amen you'll find uh that there
[59:18] is a lot of reference uh that there what
[59:20] didn't used to be but a lot of reference
[59:22] about the seals a lot of reference about
[59:24] the church ages but the prophet of God
[59:26] said they'll be coming uh uh to a time
[59:29] and a place that there is a a uh a
[59:32] seeking of the oil they're they're
[59:34] Desiring more and and they're digging in
[59:37] deeper and and you know the word of God
[59:40] is now been made a global we think about
[59:42] it as a international economy a
[59:45] worldwide economy well my brother and
[59:47] sister the gospel has uh been made a
[59:51] very much Universal worldwide gospel and
[59:54] it must be that way because it's every
[59:56] nation Kindred and tongue but it's also
[59:59] put out there that they can seek after
[1:00:01] the oil it has to be there to attract
[1:00:05] them that they would be coming forth and
[1:00:07] seeking that and it's a fulfilling of
[1:00:09] the word and you know sometimes if we're
[1:00:12] not careful we get sympathetic in that
[1:00:14] and we say well I don't know you know it
[1:00:16] seems that uh uh that we're we're
[1:00:19] cutting them out no don't cut them out
[1:00:22] amen you give all that you can give
[1:00:25] encouragement uh support uh witness
[1:00:28] everything that you can give don't be
[1:00:30] stingy with it you share it openly just
[1:00:32] pour yourself out to them amen cuz you
[1:00:36] never know amen you never know where I
[1:00:39] was just talking to a brother and he was
[1:00:41] telling me about how that a billboard
[1:00:43] was placed a little sign placed at a an
[1:00:46] intersection and and there was a lady
[1:00:49] that uh worked in that uh convenience
[1:00:52] store on that corner and um you know she
[1:00:55] was looking out the window of this
[1:00:57] convenience store and where the sign was
[1:00:59] placed she could read the sign and said
[1:01:02] there that every day she's looking at
[1:01:04] that sign and finally one day she says
[1:01:07] I'm just going to go see what that
[1:01:08] website is and she goes in there and she
[1:01:11] reads that and and she's like that's
[1:01:14] interesting and and she goes back to the
[1:01:16] website again and she goes back to the
[1:01:18] website again and finally one day she
[1:01:21] says you know I'm going to ask for
[1:01:22] Sunday off and I'm going to go over and
[1:01:24] I'm going to visit that church and just
[1:01:26] see and she's there at that church and
[1:01:28] it is so Counter Culture to to her life
[1:01:32] and what she's living and and she's
[1:01:34] there and something strikes her heart
[1:01:37] and after a few visits she says I'd like
[1:01:39] to be baptized and in that she goes and
[1:01:41] gets baptized and here's her husband
[1:01:44] kind of a hard shell of a man but it is
[1:01:46] there in a short while he says man
[1:01:49] something has changed my wife and I like
[1:01:51] it and he says I think I need to come
[1:01:54] and join in what she's doing and and
[1:01:57] it's there my brother and sister you
[1:01:59] might say the billboard has no
[1:02:06] voice going to that
[1:02:09] church walking through the door of the
[1:02:11] church didn't do it for that
[1:02:14] lady but there's life inside that church
[1:02:17] there's a holy ghost that's living
[1:02:19] inside that body of
[1:02:21] Believers and coming into the presence
[1:02:23] of that it had an impact upon them I say
[1:02:27] God let us be that kind of church let it
[1:02:29] be that the impact would be there we
[1:02:31] can't save the world we'll touch on that
[1:02:33] in just a little bit but I tell you my
[1:02:35] brother and sister those that God has
[1:02:37] called us to touch let us touch them
[1:02:40] positively let us touch them in such a
[1:02:42] way amen now as we look at this uh uh
[1:02:46] Luther had evidence of his age Wesley of
[1:02:48] his age Pentecost of its age but we're
[1:02:52] in another age those things are are good
[1:02:55] but like the baby has got a finger and
[1:02:57] eye and nose but after a while he has to
[1:02:59] become a human being he has to become a
[1:03:02] matur child then be born isn't it
[1:03:06] amazing how this is referenced here it's
[1:03:09] talking about a baby being carried in
[1:03:11] the womb of a mother has to become a
[1:03:15] matured child before it can even be born
[1:03:20] and then another maturity comes into its
[1:03:22] life and we would often put that
[1:03:24] maturity to a timeline you know in the
[1:03:27] late teens mid to late teens are
[1:03:29] starting to come into a maturity we call
[1:03:32] adulthood but my brother and sister as
[1:03:35] they would come and give their heart to
[1:03:36] the Lord there's another maturity that
[1:03:38] must come to pass you see it's not just
[1:03:41] one event in our life type that back to
[1:03:43] the spiritual but God bringing a
[1:03:46] maturity amen and that mature child then
[1:03:49] be born have a soul a body Spirit can
[1:03:52] move around now we find out all of this
[1:03:55] Jesus has declared a and just a few just
[1:03:59] those who he had ordained to life sought
[1:04:09] him think about
[1:04:13] it I was just watching a little news
[1:04:17] deal on the current status of a part of
[1:04:19] Israel
[1:04:22] there and
[1:04:25] here is the language of these
[1:04:28] soldiers and because it's a public
[1:04:30] broadcast they have bleeped them out and
[1:04:32] here's these Israeli soldiers Jews by
[1:04:38] birth but as they interviewing them it's
[1:04:45] ble and it comes to mind to me not
[1:04:48] judging those men they can be saved but
[1:04:50] the scripture says not all of Israel is
[1:04:53] Israel and amen and so here is Jesus
[1:04:56] dealing with these people and in Israel
[1:04:59] in that day it says right there just
[1:05:02] those just a few just those who he
[1:05:05] ordained to life saw him not great
[1:05:09] crowds his crowds could never be like
[1:05:12] Caiaphas
[1:05:14] crowds now look at this my brother and
[1:05:16] sister here is the Messiah walking on
[1:05:19] the Earth but he's setting a pattern for
[1:05:21] us to witness today that it never this
[1:05:25] message will never draw the crowd that
[1:05:28] this world out here can draw it will
[1:05:30] never be a mega church with with 20 30
[1:05:33] 40,000 people uh you know coming into a
[1:05:37] service two or three or four a day
[1:05:39] coming into these Services it will never
[1:05:41] be drawn to that but it's drawn to the
[1:05:44] ones that Jesus called amen that's small
[1:05:47] number and and you know if we're not
[1:05:49] careful we think oh there's not very
[1:05:51] many of us here this morning everyone
[1:05:54] that God Called to be here this morning
[1:05:56] is here that doesn't mean it's not Sons
[1:05:59] and Daughters of God sometimes
[1:06:00] circumstance and work and health and
[1:06:02] those kind of things but I trust that
[1:06:04] you follow what I'm saying God knew
[1:06:06] exactly who would be sitting on the Pew
[1:06:08] this morning knew exactly every detail
[1:06:11] of it but see Caiaphas could have called
[1:06:14] the whole nation together Jesus called
[1:06:17] just a few together not many knew him
[1:06:21] thousands times thousands when he come
[1:06:23] on the Earth he went through the Earth
[1:06:25] and they never even knowed he was here
[1:06:29] so will it be again he'll come to those
[1:06:33] who are called to life he knows who is
[1:06:35] called to life and he he'll not it's his
[1:06:41] business to take care of that you see
[1:06:45] we're worried about well I got to say
[1:06:46] the right thing to this person brother
[1:06:48] Trevor sister Carrie they have a lot of
[1:06:51] public interaction amen some of the
[1:06:53] others brother him a lot of public
[1:06:55] interaction some of us not so much and
[1:06:57] we're worried will I say the right thing
[1:06:59] what do I say to these that's not your
[1:07:01] work that's his work that's his uh uh uh
[1:07:05] prerogative to anoint you but we have to
[1:07:08] be a vessel that is ready and willing
[1:07:11] and cleansed to be used we can't be over
[1:07:14] on The Wash Rack in the dirty dishes my
[1:07:16] brother and sister he wants us washed
[1:07:18] top to bottom in and out to be ready for
[1:07:21] his service but it's up to him
[1:07:25] amen are you with me how we've labored
[1:07:28] sometimes and agonized what do I say to
[1:07:31] these
[1:07:33] people but God called us I don't need
[1:07:35] you to know what to say to them I need
[1:07:38] you ready to be used as a conduit I'll
[1:07:41] pour into you what I need to pour into
[1:07:44] them but we labor so hard and we stumble
[1:07:47] over it and often times put ourself in
[1:07:50] the way because we're trying to do the
[1:07:53] work
[1:07:55] and it's God's work amen it's God's
[1:08:00] business
[1:08:02] now we live in such an interesting
[1:08:08] world you want to speak see what the
[1:08:10] spirit is on the land
[1:08:12] today is just go and I actually I tell
[1:08:16] you don't because it's not worth it but
[1:08:19] in doing research you you go and my
[1:08:22] brother and sister you see this
[1:08:23] nonsensical representation of God's work
[1:08:26] in this day you've now got Mega
[1:08:29] ministers that are like going well you
[1:08:31] know I we don't believe in divorce until
[1:08:33] they decide they want a younger wife
[1:08:36] then suddenly they found an Avenue in
[1:08:38] the scripture that justifies it and they
[1:08:40] just trade their wife in but their wife
[1:08:43] goes on in this particular case and she
[1:08:45] just founds her own Ministry she liked
[1:08:47] the millions and she founded her own
[1:08:49] Ministry and then she goes and ends up
[1:08:52] becoming a tabloid uh you know deal that
[1:08:54] she's had an affair with another
[1:08:57] preacher and nobody leaves their Church
[1:08:59] their Church doesn't split there isn't
[1:09:02] people rise up and say this is against
[1:09:03] the
[1:09:04] word they just say oh yeah they're
[1:09:10] human it's like a soap
[1:09:14] opera living out on the
[1:09:19] platform do you see the condition the
[1:09:22] world's come in
[1:09:26] says they would make the word of God to
[1:09:28] none effect and there's the evidence I
[1:09:31] don't need to judge them you don't need
[1:09:33] to judge them their own life
[1:09:36] testifies you see and then because
[1:09:39] there's nothing there any deeper in the
[1:09:41] congregation and I hope you catch why
[1:09:44] I'm speaking this my brother and sister
[1:09:46] it's there this is a representation this
[1:09:49] is actually it's not about the preacher
[1:09:52] and his marriage condition and his his
[1:09:56] um um you know social and all of these
[1:09:59] things my brother and sister it has
[1:10:01] actually nothing to do with any of that
[1:10:04] it is Satan's
[1:10:06] deception literally there will be
[1:10:09] millions of people that says my pastor
[1:10:11] did it it will be all right for me now
[1:10:14] my brother and sister as pastors as
[1:10:16] ministers we make mistakes please don't
[1:10:19] follow our mistakes follow the word amen
[1:10:22] you know if we have a if a man has a
[1:10:24] struggle in his life and and he has you
[1:10:27] know I I knew a brother one time that
[1:10:29] used to exaggerate pretty hard and I I
[1:10:32] made a comment now I hope you guys don't
[1:10:34] look bad at this here I made a comment
[1:10:36] one day I said man so and so exaggerates
[1:10:38] and my wife she was just being honest
[1:10:41] this as many years ago she goes you know
[1:10:42] what you exaggerate almost that bad and
[1:10:45] I was like what are you talking
[1:10:47] about but I stopped and started to
[1:10:49] examine my life and realized I had a I
[1:10:53] don't know what do you you call of us
[1:10:54] Spirit of
[1:10:56] exaggeration Spirit of the
[1:10:59] oversiz something I don't know but you
[1:11:02] know my brother and sister you realize
[1:11:04] but you see God has a time and a place
[1:11:07] because we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:11:09] that he won't let us carry on in that
[1:11:12] spirit and keep moving on and on and on
[1:11:14] in that Spirit he'll come a time and say
[1:11:17] you're my son and you need to be living
[1:11:19] according to the word and I'm going to
[1:11:21] bring this out and put it right in front
[1:11:22] of your face and give you the
[1:11:24] opportunity and the unction to correct
[1:11:27] it and maybe we still sometimes you know
[1:11:31] have a little something we just kind of
[1:11:33] embellished it just a little bit it's
[1:11:35] not intentional it's not to me me a lie
[1:11:37] but it's there that something's in our
[1:11:38] nature but when that happens God's got a
[1:11:41] checkpoint right there Amen brother
[1:11:44] Sergey and I was talking I hope you
[1:11:46] don't mind me referencing this brother
[1:11:47] Sergey but about that
[1:11:50] halling that little that little deal you
[1:11:52] know that they found brother brandom's
[1:11:54] office and and it's there and when you
[1:11:56] read that my brother and sister you
[1:11:58] start to realize what's happened in your
[1:12:00] life God's not going to allow you he
[1:12:03] might allow them he might allow them but
[1:12:06] he is not going to allow you because
[1:12:08] he's put a higher calling on your life
[1:12:10] and so it's there that we go through
[1:12:12] life with these struggles and we say but
[1:12:14] Lord and it's there that we wonder why
[1:12:16] me or what's happening but it's God
[1:12:19] fine-tuning us and we don't judge them
[1:12:22] over that my brother and sister because
[1:12:23] you can't be what you
[1:12:27] aren't or as it is down in the South if
[1:12:31] you ain't you
[1:12:33] ain't just
[1:12:36] straightforward so all that this
[1:12:39] happening is not going to hinder God's
[1:12:40] work see they can call the whole world
[1:12:43] together my brother and sister exactly
[1:12:44] what's happening in the world Council of
[1:12:46] churches they're drawing together amen
[1:12:49] when you read little things that just
[1:12:51] catch your attention you know things
[1:12:53] such as uh you know uh different
[1:12:55] denominations the Catholic Church giving
[1:12:58] them
[1:12:59] property to build their spiritual
[1:13:02] Embassy in
[1:13:03] Rome now you can't tell me my brother
[1:13:06] and sister that they're ever going to
[1:13:07] come to you and I and say we're going to
[1:13:09] give you the money and the building to
[1:13:12] have a representation so you can preach
[1:13:14] about us being the
[1:13:16] Harlot no it's not going to happen my
[1:13:18] brother and sister but when it becomes
[1:13:20] compromised that the word has been
[1:13:22] brought to un effect it's all right come
[1:13:25] on over join us you're no threat to us
[1:13:28] amen the Holy Ghost is no threat to them
[1:13:30] my brother and sister because they've
[1:13:32] rejected the Holy Ghost they've rejected
[1:13:34] the spirit of God and they're so in
[1:13:37] their own thinking that we have it we
[1:13:39] have it but that spirit is not for the
[1:13:42] Catholics
[1:13:43] alone
[1:13:46] right right I won't beat that I'll leave
[1:13:48] it
[1:13:49] alone amen now
[1:13:54] they can draw the whole world together
[1:13:55] and of course we know they are it's
[1:13:56] prophesied but the Lord knows who he's
[1:13:59] called aren't you glad aren't you glad
[1:14:01] something stirring in your heart I know
[1:14:02] I was called this is who I am I'm not
[1:14:05] here by accident I'm not already
[1:14:07] planning my exit well in a way we're
[1:14:10] planning an exit out of here amen but
[1:14:13] not out of the word amen and so it's
[1:14:16] there and uh you know there's no fear in
[1:14:19] this because the simple scripture
[1:14:22] sometimes is so deep so powerful so
[1:14:25] magnetic uh when the word says my sheep
[1:14:29] know my voice you realize we could
[1:14:31] preach for years on that topic alone my
[1:14:34] sheep what identified sheep not any old
[1:14:37] sheep he didn't gate cut them if you
[1:14:39] understand that term in livestock world
[1:14:41] this is not dat cut Sheep amen we just
[1:14:43] need 50 we need a 100 we need
[1:14:46] 500 oh close the gate no it is that one
[1:14:51] that one that one that
[1:14:54] one God's choosing yeah but see in man's
[1:14:57] mind this is why God's ways are so much
[1:14:59] higher than our ways in man's mind he's
[1:15:02] going to choose the uh you know the very
[1:15:05] intelligent and the Very goodlook and
[1:15:07] the Very physical appearance and this
[1:15:09] that and the other but you know when God
[1:15:11] chooses he might choose a little bum
[1:15:13] lamb he might choose you know one that
[1:15:16] looks a little ragged doesn't look so
[1:15:18] healthy amen you know one that looks
[1:15:21] like it needs a little doctoring God
[1:15:23] would choose them and he says that's the
[1:15:25] one I want and everybody would scratch
[1:15:26] their head why them it doesn't matter
[1:15:28] what man thinks right God's ways are so
[1:15:31] much higher than our ways it's God's
[1:15:34] choice amen
[1:15:39] hallelujah reminds me one time when I
[1:15:42] was a young man working on a
[1:15:44] ranch this guy's buying these cattle and
[1:15:47] and
[1:15:48] this
[1:15:51] one steer there just kept charging at us
[1:15:55] just trying to run over us and finally
[1:15:58] the guy says I'm tired of this I ain't
[1:15:59] buying that one cut it out and so as
[1:16:02] they send it down the alley I I was the
[1:16:04] one and and uh uh you know chickened out
[1:16:09] I guess you would say cuz this this
[1:16:11] thing's running down the alley with his
[1:16:12] head down run as fast as he can and I
[1:16:15] wasn't going to over there and try and
[1:16:16] pin that gate cuz I knew that thing was
[1:16:18] going to beat me to the gate latch and
[1:16:20] so I just threw the gate out there and
[1:16:22] when it saw the gate swinging towards it
[1:16:24] it ran over here and jumped and jumped
[1:16:26] about seven or8 feet in the air and ran
[1:16:28] right into overhead AP poost broke its
[1:16:31] neck fell down in the alley
[1:16:35] dead it's
[1:16:38] like you deserve
[1:16:45] that but how many times we've
[1:16:49] shied how many times we've jumped out of
[1:16:52] the path that God has set us in how many
[1:16:56] times as it was with the old draft
[1:16:57] horses we've got tangled up in the
[1:17:00] traces how many
[1:17:03] times and God says no I called you to
[1:17:08] life and life it will be see we've heard
[1:17:11] it preached around the message and it is
[1:17:14] true in a certain category my brother
[1:17:16] and sister that you know be careful you
[1:17:18] don't send away your day of Grace but do
[1:17:21] you realize as the Bride of Christ God
[1:17:24] will not let you go to that position he
[1:17:27] might take your life premature he might
[1:17:30] make your life so miserable that you
[1:17:32] will crawl back but God is not going to
[1:17:35] just put you out there and say I hope
[1:17:37] they make it he's already spoke eternal
[1:17:39] life over your life amen he's already
[1:17:42] called you and wrote you into the Lamb's
[1:17:44] Book of Life and there will be arguments
[1:17:46] people will say but brother brandham
[1:17:47] said brother brandham said but my
[1:17:49] brother and sister predestination will
[1:17:51] hold am amen and is not a willy-nilly
[1:17:54] thing that might be and might not be ah
[1:17:57] we've seen men come to the place
[1:17:59] remember the story of the preacher or
[1:18:01] the man he was there in the garage and
[1:18:03] he was just so discouraged he tells the
[1:18:05] boy go get me a case of beer and the uh
[1:18:08] the car lift collapses kills the man and
[1:18:12] people would like and they tested the
[1:18:14] lift and said there's nothing wrong with
[1:18:16] this lift that we don't understand but
[1:18:18] you see before that man could take that
[1:18:21] position that the devil had anointed him
[1:18:23] to God took him home amen you might say
[1:18:27] well but he would have failed he might
[1:18:29] have failed that was the flesh that
[1:18:31] failed and God in the soul says no I've
[1:18:34] already claimed him he's mine and I will
[1:18:37] not let him
[1:18:39] go hallelujah oh I know it gets
[1:18:42] complicated my brother and sister and
[1:18:43] the devil's given us plenty of
[1:18:45] alternative ideas but God's ways are
[1:18:47] higher than ours amen I don't get up in
[1:18:50] the morning thinking you know I hope I
[1:18:52] don't go to hell today I get up in the
[1:18:54] morning saying Lord help me to make it
[1:18:56] through the day to be pleasing to you
[1:18:58] let my life today be a life that I can
[1:19:00] stand before you without
[1:19:03] condemnation amen the scripture says
[1:19:06] that these Sheep amen only know his
[1:19:09] voice and another voice they will not
[1:19:13] follow but let me put it a little
[1:19:14] stronger they can't follow they can't
[1:19:17] follow my brother and sister see the
[1:19:20] bride she only knows the the voice of
[1:19:23] the
[1:19:24] bridegroom look what God's doing in our
[1:19:26] lives my brother and sister we will be
[1:19:28] like I'm studied this and I studied that
[1:19:30] and I I realized this uh this Doctrine
[1:19:33] wasn't right and God moved me over here
[1:19:35] or this Behavior wasn't right and God
[1:19:37] moved me let you understand that it was
[1:19:40] God telling you not you figuring it out
[1:19:43] God telling you this isn't where you
[1:19:45] belong you need to get off of the fence
[1:19:48] you need to quit eating the thistle
[1:19:49] through the fence you need to get over
[1:19:51] here in the good grass come over here
[1:19:54] and and it's the word of the Lord that
[1:19:56] is calling it because you can't
[1:19:59] follow that
[1:20:02] voice see this bride only knows the
[1:20:05] voice of the bridegroom her beloved now
[1:20:08] this could get a little touchy so I'll
[1:20:10] try to keep it very
[1:20:15] sanitized she doesn't have a
[1:20:21] boyfriend
[1:20:23] she has a
[1:20:26] husband now I I trust that we can censor
[1:20:29] this correctly but if you go and look in
[1:20:31] Webster and see the very close but
[1:20:34] subtle difference of those
[1:20:37] two if I can word this
[1:20:40] correctly keep it very
[1:20:43] sanitized one has a right to that
[1:20:46] relationship one wants a relationship
[1:20:48] with no
[1:20:51] obligation and there is the
[1:20:55] difference the
[1:20:57] voice of one who has claimed
[1:21:01] me
[1:21:03] enough to put the
[1:21:05] ring on my
[1:21:09] finger and the one who only wants
[1:21:13] to use
[1:21:16] me for a
[1:21:19] relationship was that clear enough I
[1:21:22] don't want to go any
[1:21:23] further you see how this is my brother
[1:21:26] and sister there's a lot of difference
[1:21:27] in those two having a boyfriend or a
[1:21:31] husband amen we are not a boyfriend to
[1:21:35] Jesus Christ he is our bridegroom amen
[1:21:40] he has claimed us amen he's put the ring
[1:21:43] on our finger and he has brought us but
[1:21:46] look my brother and sister how clever
[1:21:47] Satan is he's brought up so many voices
[1:21:50] he's raised so many voices in the day
[1:21:53] that we live in there literally is a
[1:21:55] voice for everything and so it's there
[1:21:58] whether it's a voice for the liberal
[1:22:00] side of the word a voice for the
[1:22:02] legalist side of the word but my brother
[1:22:04] and sister you will find and it takes
[1:22:07] quite a bit of going through the message
[1:22:09] but you'll find the prophet of God is
[1:22:11] laying out for us that the Bride is a
[1:22:13] balanced bride amen she knows my brother
[1:22:17] and sister it's one thing remember the
[1:22:19] little story you know of how they say to
[1:22:21] greet a a husband
[1:22:23] uh a husband's been off to work he's
[1:22:24] been working hard and a wife comes and
[1:22:27] greets him at the door she throws her
[1:22:29] arms around him and makes him feel so
[1:22:32] good that he's home here with his family
[1:22:34] but if once he gets past his wife the
[1:22:37] house is a pig pin my brother and sister
[1:22:39] the Euphoria of the kiss at the door is
[1:22:42] going to fade because it's still a pig
[1:22:44] pin and my brother and sister if the
[1:22:46] house is spotless clean but there's no
[1:22:48] affection to the husband amen he's going
[1:22:50] to come home to a spotless house
[1:22:52] spotless children everything perfect but
[1:22:55] inside he's going to be filled with a
[1:22:57] great vacuum that is not being filled
[1:23:00] and he's going to yearn for something to
[1:23:02] fill that vacuum and many times the
[1:23:05] prophet of God lays this out we won't go
[1:23:07] into it but someone the devil will put
[1:23:10] them someone in the office he'll put
[1:23:12] someone in the market he'll put someone
[1:23:14] in the house next door to fill that void
[1:23:17] and it's in that void then the trouble
[1:23:19] starts and people say but I was a good
[1:23:21] wife' but you see this bride of Christ
[1:23:24] is a balanced bride her house is clean
[1:23:28] and she's there to tell them I love you
[1:23:30] Lord I love you Lord I need you Lord you
[1:23:33] are so good to me I care for you I want
[1:23:36] to be your wife I'm proud to be your
[1:23:39] wife I'm happy to be your wife amen but
[1:23:42] my brother and sister the bridegroom has
[1:23:44] come back and he reciprocates this and
[1:23:46] he also lets us know I love you I care
[1:23:49] for you I provide for you I trade my my
[1:23:52] life for
[1:23:54] you amen see how balanced this bride is
[1:23:57] she's got something to stand on she's
[1:24:00] not as one brother said plowing this
[1:24:02] ditch and then going over and plowing
[1:24:04] that ditch but she's come right back to
[1:24:06] the center of the road and the word and
[1:24:08] the leadership of the holy spirit is
[1:24:10] bringing the word out in our life my
[1:24:12] brother and sister I'll tell you what
[1:24:14] I'll just say it out loud I'm proud of
[1:24:16] you I'm proud of you as a church we're
[1:24:18] human we have a little little fuss here
[1:24:21] and oh the little there and a little
[1:24:23] whatever but what do we do we keep
[1:24:25] coming back into the word we keep coming
[1:24:27] back and making things right and setting
[1:24:29] things in order and getting over our
[1:24:31] flesh and getting over our emotion and
[1:24:33] getting over our complexes and pressing
[1:24:35] forward as Sons and Daughters of God you
[1:24:37] see this is the kind of bride the word
[1:24:39] is producing one that's balanced and
[1:24:42] even if someone
[1:24:45] does say something very
[1:24:49] direct you can take the spirit of Christ
[1:24:51] and say Lord forgive for give them they
[1:24:52] know not what they
[1:24:54] do and walk on I'm can I speak just a
[1:24:59] little bit
[1:25:01] blunt if Christ acted
[1:25:04] like all of us do at some point in our
[1:25:07] life we'd see in scripture something
[1:25:10] about the reference to those worthless
[1:25:15] bombs no
[1:25:17] good but you see he says Lord forgive
[1:25:21] them they didn't even know what they
[1:25:23] were doing help us find that kind of
[1:25:26] balance help us kind the thing that the
[1:25:28] devil it's not you Saints it's the devil
[1:25:31] trying to come and drive a wedge into
[1:25:34] the body of Believers he's trying to
[1:25:36] cause it so that there's a drama just
[1:25:38] like I was talking about out there so
[1:25:40] there's all kinds of well why did this
[1:25:41] church split well this preacher preaches
[1:25:43] too hard and this one preaches too this
[1:25:46] and this one this and this and this and
[1:25:48] everybody then segregates and says well
[1:25:50] I just want to hear a preacher that
[1:25:51] tells me I'm going in a Rapture I'm
[1:25:53] going to go over here I I want to I like
[1:25:55] it hard I like my hide Tor I'm going to
[1:25:57] go to over here with this one that says
[1:26:00] you'll be lucky to make it in the
[1:26:01] Rapture and then others will be saying
[1:26:04] you know I I I just I just want to be
[1:26:06] able to eat and
[1:26:09] grow eat and grow the prophet of God
[1:26:13] actually puts it drink and grow drink
[1:26:16] and grow drink and grow because you see
[1:26:20] all the rest of this is nothing but
[1:26:21] Satan's drw
[1:26:22] to keep you and I from focusing on the
[1:26:25] word of God and then pretty soon one
[1:26:28] teaching brings us over here and we're
[1:26:29] trying to we're trying to be better
[1:26:31] people in the sense of I can do it I can
[1:26:34] do it I can do it well let me tell you I
[1:26:36] shared a quote here sometime back you
[1:26:38] might remember it you might not where
[1:26:40] brother bradam says I used to think that
[1:26:42] I I'm paraphrasing it I used to think
[1:26:44] that I could do it and then I just
[1:26:50] quit I can't do it
[1:26:55] I'm holding on to Jesus just
[1:26:58] quit he's holding on to you amen it's
[1:27:02] not what we can do Saints this is God's
[1:27:06] work this is God's business amen he's in
[1:27:11] the saving
[1:27:13] business
[1:27:16] Amen in the church
[1:27:20] ages did I finish that
[1:27:24] yeah yeah seven Church ages have you
[1:27:27] noticed in Revelations 22:17 and the
[1:27:30] spirit and the bride say come and let
[1:27:32] him that Hearth say come see the bride
[1:27:35] speaks the same word as does the
[1:27:39] spirit I I love that my brother and
[1:27:41] sister because you see we don't need to
[1:27:43] learn uh two languages as it were we
[1:27:45] don't need to try and figure out just
[1:27:47] how to say it just say what the word
[1:27:49] says amen as the same as the spirit
[1:27:52] she is a word bride proving she has the
[1:27:56] spirit in every Church age we hear these
[1:27:58] words he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:28:01] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:28:03] the spirit gives the word and if you
[1:28:06] have the spirit you will hear can can we
[1:28:09] say Amen to that if you have the spirit
[1:28:12] you will hear the word for your age as
[1:28:15] those true Christians took the word for
[1:28:18] their age I tell you that just makes my
[1:28:20] heart so happy and men we don't got to
[1:28:22] worry about how this is going to come
[1:28:24] out and wait there might be some of this
[1:28:26] I don't quite understand if you have the
[1:28:29] spirit you will have the word amen and
[1:28:32] when you're in the word it draws a
[1:28:34] spirit even closer to you which means
[1:28:37] that it is an unending Revelation as you
[1:28:41] come closer to Christ he comes closer to
[1:28:43] you and I want you to think about the
[1:28:45] young man and the young woman uh godly
[1:28:48] people according correctly amen wanting
[1:28:50] to please the Lord what happens it
[1:28:52] starts by a young man maybe opening boys
[1:28:54] listen to this amen might start with a
[1:28:56] young man opening the door amen and
[1:28:59] standing there smiling like some silly
[1:29:01] kid as she walks
[1:29:03] by but then there Comes A Time you know
[1:29:06] oh I'm going to go get a drink I see
[1:29:08] your cup is empty can I fill your cup
[1:29:11] and after a while this young lady
[1:29:13] realizes man none of these other boys
[1:29:14] treat me like he treats me and then she
[1:29:17] reciprocates that all these other girls
[1:29:19] won't even look at him but she smiles
[1:29:21] here and there what is happening they're
[1:29:22] drawing together slowly slowly amen
[1:29:26] coming together and as it does it starts
[1:29:29] to warm up in a positive way amen and
[1:29:33] pretty soon he's able to somewhere along
[1:29:35] the line you know Express oh you look
[1:29:37] beautiful in that dress today or your
[1:29:40] hair the way you're doing I really your
[1:29:42] hair is beautiful that way and she
[1:29:43] doesn't creep her get away from me
[1:29:45] because something in her says oh yes I
[1:29:49] like that compliment they're drawing
[1:29:51] closer and closer and closer until one
[1:29:55] day they find themselves in an
[1:29:58] altar and their husband and wife you see
[1:30:02] what we see in the
[1:30:04] natural that relationship is fixing to
[1:30:07] take another step closer that's not a
[1:30:11] public
[1:30:12] display isn't that what the prophet of
[1:30:14] God said this last this last work that
[1:30:17] God would do in the bride is not going
[1:30:19] to be a public display it is when they
[1:30:23] take that relationship and take it to
[1:30:26] its highest level now my brother and
[1:30:28] sister does that mean that relationship
[1:30:30] at that point in time is as high as it
[1:30:33] will ever
[1:30:35] get no it's just another stage of
[1:30:39] maturity that carries on till you can
[1:30:42] sit one day and people been married 40
[1:30:46] 50 60 70 years and can say my love is
[1:30:51] still growing
[1:30:53] now think about our relationship with
[1:30:55] the Lord amen as the days go on how much
[1:30:58] sweeter this relationship is and so it's
[1:31:02] there you see amen have you noticed
[1:31:04] Revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the
[1:31:07] bride say come and let him that heareth
[1:31:09] say come uh and see the bride speaks the
[1:31:13] same word as does the spirit she is a
[1:31:16] word bride proving she has the spirit
[1:31:19] and in every Church age amen I'm reading
[1:31:21] it again in case you wonder in every
[1:31:23] Church age we hear these words he that
[1:31:25] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:31:28] saith unto the churches the spirit gives
[1:31:31] the
[1:31:32] word now my brother and sister when the
[1:31:34] word don't line up some people I I'm
[1:31:37] getting a little hard on this pray for
[1:31:39] me I'm kind of getting tired of people
[1:31:42] doing things just contrary to the word
[1:31:45] contrary to the message and people are
[1:31:47] like oh give them a break you know come
[1:31:49] on my brother and sister if the word is
[1:31:51] false false then the spirit is
[1:31:55] false and if the spirit is false sooner
[1:31:57] or later it will give a word that is not
[1:32:01] correct come on let's stand up we we
[1:32:03] don't need to babysit these spirits of
[1:32:05] unbelief but we don't need to crucify
[1:32:07] them either but it's time for us to
[1:32:09] stand up and say that's not on the word
[1:32:11] I can't accept it uh nice people but
[1:32:14] it's not on the word I can't accept it
[1:32:17] instead of offering them an
[1:32:20] excuse or a for the wolf to bite you
[1:32:25] again I believe that was a Russian story
[1:32:28] about the little boy that found the wolf
[1:32:30] pup took it home and the parents said oh
[1:32:34] that's that's a wolf pup you can't have
[1:32:36] it and he convinces them cries oh it's
[1:32:39] my doggy my doggy and you know it grew
[1:32:41] up full-fledged wolf and one day they
[1:32:43] come home and the Wolf is laying there
[1:32:46] contentedly asleep and there's no little
[1:32:49] boy you see the spirit my brother and
[1:32:52] sister as much as you think you've tamed
[1:32:54] it is not tame it's either subject to
[1:32:59] the word of God or it's a fullblown
[1:33:02] Hungry
[1:33:06] Wolf I hope I hope you don't take that
[1:33:08] too harsh but it really is time for us
[1:33:11] as the bride of Christ the message to
[1:33:13] stand up and say look I'm sorry the
[1:33:16] little ISM you've always did you know uh
[1:33:18] it's kind of like when you write a
[1:33:19] letter professional letter wrote one I
[1:33:22] think in my life you know and uh you
[1:33:25] know and then at the bottom when you go
[1:33:27] to send that you have some other things
[1:33:28] you're sending with it so you put a
[1:33:29] little attachment on it you guys know
[1:33:32] what I'm talking about some of you know
[1:33:33] how to do that I have son-in-law wife
[1:33:37] daughters they know how to do that well
[1:33:39] I don't even need to go there anymore I
[1:33:40] can just get my granddaughter to do it
[1:33:42] yeah she was coaching me the other day
[1:33:45] oh grandpa if you do this and this I
[1:33:47] guess I could do this for
[1:33:49] you well it just makes me want want to
[1:33:51] just learn how to do it myself and then
[1:33:53] I thought why should
[1:33:55] I why should
[1:33:57] I but you see what happens is is when
[1:34:00] these spirits come when the Holy Spirit
[1:34:04] speaks the word backs it up but when
[1:34:08] another voice speaks there's always an
[1:34:13] attachment and when you open that
[1:34:16] attachment sometimes it hangs on I'm
[1:34:20] using a computer for an example but just
[1:34:22] think your own life amen sometimes you
[1:34:24] might as well take that computer and
[1:34:26] just almost practically go throw it in a
[1:34:28] dumpster because what was in the
[1:34:30] attachment has now corrupted everything
[1:34:34] in that computer and that's what the
[1:34:36] devil's trying to do he's trying to give
[1:34:38] us the message plus the Bible plus you
[1:34:43] can find the prophet of God talking
[1:34:44] about this amen we don't need the
[1:34:47] message plus we don't need the Bible
[1:34:49] plus amen we just need the pure p word
[1:34:51] of God and the message is here to open
[1:34:54] the book for us we need to just settle
[1:34:56] for what is there we don't need a new
[1:35:00] excitable
[1:35:05] Revelation one time I preached at a
[1:35:07] church and I made I I'm trying to cure
[1:35:10] myself of These Foolish
[1:35:13] statements I just made a statement about
[1:35:15] you know I never feel like I have enough
[1:35:17] money and if you have some spare money
[1:35:18] you could give it to me and had a
[1:35:20] brother who I knew had money after
[1:35:22] church come up to me and said were you
[1:35:24] being
[1:35:26] serious no please
[1:35:29] brother I'm sorry I ever even mentioned
[1:35:33] it that's not the point I was
[1:35:37] making if I got more Revelation than you
[1:35:40] can I just give you some if you got more
[1:35:42] Revelation than me can you just give me
[1:35:44] some you can't give and take what God
[1:35:48] gives and takes
[1:35:52] it comes out of the word it comes direct
[1:35:54] to your heart because when it becomes a
[1:35:57] secondhand understanding or Revelation
[1:36:00] or life there's room in there for the
[1:36:04] attachment to corrupt us amen we're not
[1:36:08] here to be corrupted we're here to stand
[1:36:09] on the pure word because what the spirit
[1:36:12] says this bride's going to say amen
[1:36:15] hallelujah I'm probably lost you here I
[1:36:17] need to hurry up and finish amen so it's
[1:36:20] a word bride that proves she has it now
[1:36:23] Revelations
[1:36:24] 2210 through1 17 very interesting these
[1:36:28] are the scriptures and I I'm going to
[1:36:29] forego reading all of that but we come
[1:36:32] right down here to this Foundation of
[1:36:33] verse 17 and the spirit and the bride
[1:36:36] say come and let him that heareth say
[1:36:40] come and let him that is a thirst come
[1:36:43] and whosoever will let him take of the
[1:36:46] Water of Life freely amen that ought to
[1:36:49] be a foundational thing to us my my
[1:36:51] brother and sister because those
[1:36:53] scriptures above it speak pretty strong
[1:36:55] amen you know he that's unjust is going
[1:36:58] to be unjust still right who is filthy
[1:37:00] is going to be filthy still none of
[1:37:02] those things pertain to a bride of
[1:37:04] Christ who by Revelation has heard the
[1:37:07] pure word of God come from the Throne of
[1:37:09] God the River of Life flowing out from
[1:37:12] the throne it's coming right down to
[1:37:14] your doorstep your doorstep your
[1:37:17] doorstep your doorstep my brother and
[1:37:19] sister we don't need to divert it over
[1:37:20] and to a swamp to store it we don't need
[1:37:23] to take some sample put it on a shelf to
[1:37:25] store it we need to drink and when we
[1:37:28] drink of that if there comes a season of
[1:37:30] drought in your life you have got the
[1:37:32] Water of Life to sustain you and you
[1:37:34] won't be running over here trying to
[1:37:36] satisfy and running over there trying to
[1:37:38] satisfy you can hunker down and say this
[1:37:40] might be a drought in my life I'm not as
[1:37:42] on fire as I should be right now but
[1:37:45] Lord I know amen that I know who I am
[1:37:49] and that your word is true
[1:37:51] amen because without that my brother and
[1:37:53] sister we'll find ourselves being pulled
[1:37:55] boy this is a dynamic Minister this is a
[1:37:58] dynamic Minister and maybe they are but
[1:38:00] maybe they're not the minister for you
[1:38:03] maybe their gospel as it is is not the
[1:38:05] gospel for you today in this stage of
[1:38:08] your life you know I'm not trying to cut
[1:38:10] anybody in or out but now let's hurry
[1:38:12] along John 11 we see that Martha is
[1:38:16] there with Jesus and uh she's she's
[1:38:19] lamenting if Jesus had been there
[1:38:22] amen and Martha as soon as she heard
[1:38:24] that Jesus was coming went and met him
[1:38:26] Mary was still in the house you know
[1:38:28] Mary was too
[1:38:30] domestic amen that's not a bad trait but
[1:38:33] still then Martha said to Jesus Lord if
[1:38:36] thou has has been here my brother had
[1:38:39] not
[1:38:40] died so she's pinning it down that that
[1:38:43] almost like
[1:38:45] Lord don't understand why you weren't
[1:38:47] here cuz if you had been here we heard
[1:38:50] the news that you heard that Lazarus was
[1:38:52] sick but yet you went to another more
[1:38:55] distant
[1:38:58] City but if you had been here he
[1:39:00] wouldn't have
[1:39:02] died how many times my brother and
[1:39:04] sister have we approached
[1:39:07] God lord if you had just changed this it
[1:39:11] wouldn't have been like this well if he'
[1:39:13] had changed it for sure it wouldn't have
[1:39:14] been like that you wouldn't have learned
[1:39:17] the lesson you wouldn't had the
[1:39:18] spiritual growth you wouldn't have
[1:39:19] caught the revelation
[1:39:21] and so we're always looking as a brother
[1:39:24] and Chile we know for the easier path
[1:39:29] amen let's not go let's find an easier
[1:39:34] path an easier way my brother and sister
[1:39:37] I want to go the way that God called me
[1:39:38] to go if he tells you to go straight
[1:39:41] down the mountain or straight up the
[1:39:42] mountain don't complain
[1:39:44] go amen Martha said to Jesus if you had
[1:39:48] been here my brother had not died but I
[1:39:51] know that even now whatsoever thou will
[1:39:53] ask of God God will give it thee so look
[1:39:56] at the look at brother Chris been
[1:39:58] preaching on these twins here now look
[1:40:00] at that twin spirit that was there if
[1:40:02] you had been here he wouldn't have died
[1:40:03] but wait I
[1:40:08] know looks like a contradiction to
[1:40:11] me why wasn't you here let's just turn
[1:40:14] the words around the way I see them why
[1:40:16] wasn't you
[1:40:18] here H but nevertheless anyway um you
[1:40:22] know I know
[1:40:23] that
[1:40:25] no whatever you ask of God God will give
[1:40:28] it thee and Jesus says to her see this
[1:40:31] is where the word is coming to pass
[1:40:34] right in our midst but we don't
[1:40:35] comprehend
[1:40:37] it are you with me it's coming to pass
[1:40:41] right in our midst we don't comprehend
[1:40:42] it because our thoughts are not as high
[1:40:44] as his thoughts our ways are not his
[1:40:47] ways and we're interpreting God's word
[1:40:49] through our filter
[1:40:53] yeah Jesus sayith to her thy brother
[1:40:56] shall rise
[1:40:58] again now look at this my brother and
[1:41:00] sister we don't want to Short change the
[1:41:05] word don't let the devil Short change
[1:41:07] the word for
[1:41:11] you we hear this
[1:41:14] often people having questions about
[1:41:16] rapturing faith in fact they have
[1:41:19] questions about faith
[1:41:22] period much less rapturing Faith but
[1:41:25] what's happening the devil's short
[1:41:27] changing the word to them because the
[1:41:29] prophet already gave us the explanation
[1:41:31] said that's already in you it's just
[1:41:33] going to be released we don't
[1:41:35] necessarily want to go through the fight
[1:41:37] the battle the struggle to release faith
[1:41:40] can we be honest with each other today
[1:41:43] amen God says here you know what I need
[1:41:45] you to do I need you to run through the
[1:41:49] fire fear fear Rises up reasoning Rises
[1:41:53] up emotion Rises up I don't want to run
[1:41:55] through the
[1:41:56] fire now does God have to explain to you
[1:41:59] and I now if you'll just start right
[1:42:02] here and then you will just look here
[1:42:06] and you will then just go through the
[1:42:09] fire I won't let the fire touch you so
[1:42:12] now when you come out on the other side
[1:42:14] you're going to be perfect no that's not
[1:42:16] how God works God said I'm going to take
[1:42:18] you through the fire come
[1:42:22] go but he said I'll keep
[1:42:26] you I'll keep you I'll guard you I'll
[1:42:28] Shield you I'm your provider but our
[1:42:31] human element can't see the whole
[1:42:34] picture Martha's human element can't see
[1:42:36] the whole picture Jesus said your
[1:42:38] brother's going to live and she says oh
[1:42:39] I know that he will rise in the
[1:42:42] resurrection and Jesus follows right
[1:42:44] behind that and says I am the
[1:42:47] resurrection amen that it was there oh
[1:42:50] all you got to do is just believe
[1:42:53] because he is in fact going to rise in
[1:42:56] the resurrection and I'm here amen
[1:43:00] hallelujah I hope that makes you as
[1:43:02] excited as it makes me amen you see
[1:43:05] Resurrection Life my brother and sister
[1:43:07] is not way out there the prophet of God
[1:43:10] Is Right Here Right Now Resurrection
[1:43:12] Life is in this building today it's in
[1:43:15] his word today it's in his bride today
[1:43:17] and we need to stop and say Lord I just
[1:43:20] want the resur ction life I don't know
[1:43:22] how it's going to come and how it will
[1:43:24] be displayed but I believe that it's
[1:43:29] here you know you hear some wonderful
[1:43:33] stories a prayer
[1:43:38] line somebody sitting in their chair
[1:43:41] doesn't even go through a prayer line
[1:43:43] receives their
[1:43:44] healing but somehow we get in our mind I
[1:43:47] need to have this brother that brother
[1:43:48] these brothers pray for for
[1:43:52] me Resurrection Life our healer is right
[1:43:57] here and if you can't receive it sitting
[1:43:59] in your chair you probably won't receive
[1:44:01] it going through the
[1:44:03] line because we're
[1:44:06] actually the red light or the green
[1:44:09] light not the
[1:44:12] preacher you
[1:44:14] imagine you imagine if a
[1:44:16] minister just had an absolute gift of
[1:44:19] healing well would happen around this
[1:44:23] message wherever he
[1:44:25] traveled wherever he
[1:44:28] traveled there would be crowds of people
[1:44:30] crowding in just so they could touch the
[1:44:35] hymn of His
[1:44:38] Garment wrong garment wrong himym that's
[1:44:42] not the one we're called to touch okay
[1:44:44] let me close let me close
[1:44:47] amen
[1:44:48] so amen I'll just skip over you catch
[1:44:52] the point on Martha amen see you don't
[1:44:54] even look at the time of distress you
[1:44:56] know when Jesus the word spoke Martha
[1:44:58] the bride spoke the word in return she
[1:45:02] didn't come up with another message she
[1:45:04] didn't say but Jesus what about this and
[1:45:06] you said and wherever it was when this
[1:45:08] was spoken amen she caught it why in
[1:45:13] continuity because the word the bride
[1:45:16] will only speak the word and the word
[1:45:19] has been spoken
[1:45:21] amen sister Sarah would you come we'll
[1:45:24] just skip over a few things here that
[1:45:26] are maybe a little
[1:45:28] redundant amen so what's this bride
[1:45:30] going to do she's going to speak in
[1:45:32] continuity to the word you see this is
[1:45:36] God's business and we're just called to
[1:45:37] speak the word now I want to ask
[1:45:41] you how hard is it for us to speak the
[1:45:46] word yeah that might be construed as a
[1:45:48] trick question when we're anointed by a
[1:45:51] spirit of leod
[1:45:53] deia sometimes it can be pretty hard to
[1:45:56] just speak the
[1:45:59] word we want to call a preacher or
[1:46:01] somebody that we have a lot of
[1:46:03] confidence and we got to do this we got
[1:46:04] to do that or we could just speak the
[1:46:08] word you know that's when the prophet of
[1:46:10] God that's when the prophet of God said
[1:46:13] you you mothers you
[1:46:15] Housewives you got a sick baby you don't
[1:46:17] need to call the preacher you need to go
[1:46:20] in there and in faith lay your hand on
[1:46:22] that child claim their healing in the
[1:46:24] name of Jesus Christ God will honor that
[1:46:29] Faith amen and when that ever happens
[1:46:32] and you see that happen it boosts your
[1:46:34] faith to realize God hears my prayer God
[1:46:38] wants to fulfill his word through me and
[1:46:42] in there we gain and come a little bit
[1:46:46] closer talk about my brother and
[1:46:49] sister one last little thought to drive
[1:46:52] home David the ruddiest little spoiled
[1:46:56] child of the
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:01] family until that day the bear come
[1:47:06] grabbed a
[1:47:07] lamb David had a choice run all the way
[1:47:10] back to the house get Dad and all the
[1:47:14] servants take care of
[1:47:16] it or we'll just take care of it
[1:47:21] I'm a Son of God I'm a son of
[1:47:23] Jesse we know who we
[1:47:26] are goes over grabs that old bear by the
[1:47:30] beard grabs him by the Jaws amen slays a
[1:47:34] bear slays a lion my brother and sister
[1:47:37] they wondered how he could come down
[1:47:39] there and look across at
[1:47:41] Goliath and say what he said they're
[1:47:43] like well but do you realize nowhere
[1:47:47] nowhere in that Army was another
[1:47:50] person who had killed the bear and
[1:47:54] killed the
[1:47:55] lion and I hope you don't misunderstand
[1:47:57] what I'm trying to say here the
[1:48:01] Philistines and maybe even all of those
[1:48:04] who say they are
[1:48:06] Israel amen will not have the experience
[1:48:09] this bride has in dealing with Satan she
[1:48:14] is defeating Satan on his own ground we
[1:48:17] don't have to run back and find someone
[1:48:20] more powerful someone we have more
[1:48:23] confidence in our confidence is in
[1:48:25] Christ our confidence is in the word and
[1:48:28] when we meet Satan my brother and sister
[1:48:30] this is not boasting ground this is what
[1:48:32] God is doing and I guess we can boast on
[1:48:34] the Lord but God's allowing you to find
[1:48:37] victory in little things in your life
[1:48:40] and victory is moving you from little
[1:48:42] things to bigger things to bigger things
[1:48:44] to bigger things to bigger things and
[1:48:46] Satan is trying to ramp up his attack on
[1:48:49] you but God's already prepared you and
[1:48:52] the word says he'd raise up a standard
[1:48:55] what is that standard my brother and
[1:48:56] sister it's not a wall out here it's not
[1:48:59] some you know modern Hightech Warfare
[1:49:02] It's the word the word raising up and up
[1:49:06] and up and faith in the word and knowing
[1:49:09] that I'm called of God I cannot be
[1:49:11] defeated I am victorious I am the bride
[1:49:14] of Christ this is my victory and we sing
[1:49:18] that song Amen how does those words go I
[1:49:21] if if death can't hold me amen I can't
[1:49:25] remember
[1:49:27] that yes yeah can't sting us amen if you
[1:49:31] know what that is maybe we'll sing that
[1:49:33] song Amen but look my brother and sister
[1:49:36] if it's there that this is what God's
[1:49:38] doing he's bringing us to a
[1:49:40] place should we not have more confidence
[1:49:42] today than we had yesterday should we
[1:49:45] not be able to stand today and say the
[1:49:46] god that allowed me to conquer yesterday
[1:49:49] is the same God and he's here today and
[1:49:52] I will overcome today Hallelujah this is
