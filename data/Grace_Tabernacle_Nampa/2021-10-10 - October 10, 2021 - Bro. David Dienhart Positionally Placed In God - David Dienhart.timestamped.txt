[30:12] prayer before we go to the word
[30:14] let's bow our heads
[30:16] our heavenly father as we
[30:18] are here bowing our heads to the dust
[30:20] from which we came these bodies came but
[30:22] our hearts turned heavenward
[30:25] to the reality in revelation of your
[30:27] presence
[30:29] we are not dependent on man we are not
[30:31] dependent on self this morning we are
[30:33] totally dependent on the word that's in
[30:35] our midst living
[30:37] and father you gave that as our as our
[30:41] uh
[30:44] victory you gave that as our rest
[30:47] you gave that lord as as the very thing
[30:50] that we would defeat every devil every
[30:53] circumstance with
[30:54] was that word living in us
[30:58] and we know that that is perfect faith
[31:02] we thank you for that lord we give you
[31:04] praise for that and now lord we are
[31:06] expecting you to speak and to bless your
[31:08] word
[31:09] you know every individual that's here
[31:11] this morning you know every heart
[31:14] you know what's in that heart
[31:16] you know why they're here they haven't
[31:18] come on their own
[31:19] there was something inside of them that
[31:21] drawed them satan would not have wanted
[31:23] them to come to hear the pure word for
[31:25] the season preached
[31:28] so lord may we open our hearts to
[31:30] receive from you may you close our mind
[31:33] to the things of yesterday the things of
[31:35] our senses and may you open our hearts
[31:38] open our minds open up our
[31:41] soul
[31:43] through the channel lord
[31:45] of your word that we may receive and
[31:47] hear what you would have for us now we
[31:49] committed all to you and these lips are
[31:52] yours to speak and to bring forth what
[31:54] you have ordained i'm expecting that
[31:57] because lord as a man i can do nothing i
[31:59] can do nothing you said we can do
[32:01] nothing without you
[32:04] and lord we are so thankful that lord we
[32:06] are not dependent on man
[32:08] we are dependent upon you
[32:11] the living word the living christ that
[32:14] has revealed yourself in this day
[32:16] through your word to your bride we thank
[32:19] you for this lord we give you praise now
[32:22] in jesus christ's name amen
[32:25] amen with you just stand with me
[32:27] turn to ephesians chapter one
[32:31] i want to title this message this
[32:33] morning positionally placed in jesus
[32:35] christ
[32:36] positionally placed in jesus christ
[32:40] that's a big word
[32:43] and i pray that god will bring it down
[32:45] into the simplicity that it is
[32:48] the simplicity of the word is the word
[32:50] revealed in you
[32:53] you can't in your own human mind
[32:55] figure out god's word you'll never
[32:58] figure it out
[33:00] you can't intellectualize it
[33:03] it's got to be a revelation and then for
[33:05] that to happen the holy ghost has got to
[33:07] be in you amen
[33:09] amen so
[33:11] it's to it's to a people
[33:13] the word of god today is not to everyone
[33:16] the word of god is to a special class of
[33:18] people now who those people are i don't
[33:21] know
[33:23] i know individually what it is because i
[33:25] know i'm in i'm in that class
[33:27] individually not i'm not boasting it's
[33:30] by the grace of god through revelation
[33:32] that that is made known
[33:34] it's nothing i've done it's nothing you
[33:36] can do god didn't give us a book of
[33:39] rules to keep
[33:41] amen he made it very simple
[33:43] he said i have amen
[33:46] amen i will
[33:49] amen amen so it's not us figuring things
[33:53] out
[33:54] amen it's us believing what he said
[33:56] taking god at his word
[33:59] amen it's not it's it's it's you
[34:01] believing
[34:03] amen what he said in his word amen amen
[34:07] so
[34:08] so i want to title this positionally
[34:10] placed in christ
[34:11] and
[34:12] it's god's great army
[34:15] his body the bride and that's not the
[34:17] title the title is positionally placed
[34:19] in jesus christ but god's great army his
[34:22] body the bride
[34:24] and i i'm i'm wanting to to get us to
[34:27] realize
[34:29] your positive position
[34:34] your positive position and let me say it
[34:36] like this your eternal position
[34:41] now how positive is that
[34:43] your eternal position
[34:46] amen
[34:48] brother branham said this he said when
[34:50] the bride knows what she is
[34:54] when she knows what she is
[34:56] he said it'll take the rapture or other
[34:58] words she will take a body
[35:00] change when she knows what she is
[35:05] no man can teach you that
[35:08] it's not based on your emotions
[35:10] it's god reveals it to you
[35:14] amen that's that's what it has to be and
[35:18] that's what it is and that's what it
[35:20] will be
[35:22] amen
[35:23] in the in the message and i don't want
[35:25] to keep you standing but on page 15 of
[35:27] the church age book i just feel to read
[35:29] this now i thought i'd read it let me
[35:30] touch back on it again
[35:33] but on page 15 very familiar quote
[35:40] satan fights revelation he cannot stand
[35:43] revelation
[35:46] we know the bride loves it
[35:49] because with divine revelation in her
[35:50] life
[35:52] the gates of hell cannot stand against
[35:54] that revelation of christ in you
[35:57] with the revelation of the word there's
[35:59] nothing there's no gates of hell can
[36:00] stand against the revelation of the word
[36:04] amen
[36:06] and he said
[36:08] if the people
[36:10] get the true revelation
[36:13] and we know she will
[36:16] get the true revelation of the true
[36:18] church what she is
[36:21] what she is
[36:24] what she stands for
[36:32] and that she can do the greater works
[36:36] she knows who she is she knows her
[36:39] position she knows where she stands
[36:42] she can impart eternal life to a
[36:45] believer
[36:47] amen
[36:49] amen
[36:50] she can do the greater works
[36:53] she will be an invincible
[36:56] army
[36:57] we're talking about an army here so
[37:00] obviously we're talking about fighting
[37:05] we're not on a picnic
[37:08] we are in a battle
[37:11] and i'll just say this right now we are
[37:12] in the greatest battle
[37:15] the greatest the greatest
[37:18] battle
[37:19] ever fought
[37:21] is being waged right now
[37:23] right here in this little tabernacle
[37:25] this meeting place
[37:27] right here on the battleground of your
[37:29] mind
[37:30] the greatest battle ever fought is being
[37:32] waged
[37:34] every day
[37:37] death and life are in their final
[37:38] struggle
[37:42] truth and air are in their struggle
[37:47] amen life and death is in its struggle
[37:52] amen amen
[37:54] she'll be invincible she cannot when she
[37:56] knows what she is she's impossible for
[37:59] her to be defeated and when you know
[38:02] that
[38:04] what kind of a manifestation would it be
[38:09] through you amen
[38:13] all right
[38:14] so
[38:15] if
[38:17] if they when they if they get but when
[38:19] they get a true revelation because they
[38:21] are of the two spirits within the
[38:23] framework of the christian church
[38:26] spirits
[38:28] we're not worrying against flesh and
[38:29] blood
[38:31] we're warring against spirits
[38:35] and the bride is only in tune to receive
[38:37] one
[38:39] that's the word
[38:41] for the season
[38:44] amen
[38:48] so
[38:52] when you get a revelation of two spirits
[38:53] within the framework of the christian
[38:55] church and by god's spirit
[38:58] because you know your position discern
[39:00] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[39:04] that is so close to the real it would
[39:06] deceive the elective possible and you
[39:09] can't discern the difference because of
[39:11] their emotion and their actions
[39:14] you only can discern the difference by
[39:16] revelation
[39:20] by the holy spirit the only that's the
[39:22] only discern today the word of god is a
[39:25] deserter
[39:27] the word that is quick and powerful
[39:29] living in operative is only as a
[39:31] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[39:34] the heart amen all right
[39:38] so satan by that revelation by god's
[39:41] spirit will be definitely powerless
[39:44] before her
[39:45] amen
[39:47] satan hates revelation but we love it
[39:51] ephesians 1
[39:54] you have that
[39:56] you have it
[39:57] okay let me read one other thing here on
[39:59] the super sign before we turn to that
[40:01] scripture
[40:03] 1963 11 29 super size say that for those
[40:07] on the internet i know and and god bless
[40:09] those that are on the internet i know i
[40:11] have a cousin in montana that's on the
[40:14] internet with us every sunday
[40:16] and his wife and and there's others i've
[40:19] even had others say we go on the
[40:20] internet and hear your service
[40:23] we're not supporting and provoking
[40:25] internets we're from we're promoting the
[40:27] word
[40:29] amen right amen and so we i'm bringing
[40:32] this so that they write it down and they
[40:34] go and look it up
[40:36] all right so 11 29 63 is called the
[40:40] super sign there and it's there is a man
[40:43] a prophet indeed he's talking about john
[40:44] the baptist he had a sign that he had to
[40:47] watch
[40:49] are we hearing
[40:51] we had a prophet too
[40:52] amen
[40:54] that also fulfilled like john the
[40:56] baptist
[40:57] was sent to forerun the coming word
[40:59] before on the coming and he was on earth
[41:02] at the time of his coming
[41:05] because he introduced him
[41:07] and bride i've introduced you to him
[41:10] he can't pregnant a bride and not be
[41:12] here
[41:14] can't marry bride and not be here
[41:17] there's a union going it can't be a
[41:18] union unless he is here
[41:21] so the mystery of the seventh seal is
[41:23] his coming
[41:25] all right so
[41:27] he said here
[41:30] he said he had a sign he had to watch
[41:33] where was the sign it was in heaven
[41:35] what's the sign that caught the
[41:36] attention of the prophet
[41:38] what's the sign that catches our
[41:40] attention
[41:43] amen what is this sign
[41:46] on sunset mountain
[41:51] he had a sign he had to watch and when
[41:53] he seen the messiah he was sure that he
[41:56] was coming in his day he was so positive
[41:59] oh if the church now he turns it right
[42:02] back over here to the bride oh if the
[42:04] church could only get its positive
[42:06] position
[42:09] he had to introduce the messiah
[42:12] oh if the church could only get its
[42:14] positive position
[42:20] if it would only know its stand in this
[42:23] hour
[42:27] the bible says without us there must be
[42:29] something very important that's been
[42:31] unveiled in this hour for without us
[42:33] they the ages could not be made perfect
[42:36] without this perfect word revealed to us
[42:39] that's hidden beneath the book in the
[42:41] book
[42:42] book's been opened right
[42:45] it's sent to claim a bride
[42:50] amen
[42:51] and when the book was opened and a
[42:53] voiced as a lion roar seven thunders
[42:56] under their voices and that's the
[42:58] mystery that will bring the bride into a
[43:00] body change and that mystery can only be
[43:03] revealed to the bride she's the only one
[43:06] that can hear that
[43:08] absolutely right
[43:10] all right
[43:11] now
[43:12] it would only know it stand in this hour
[43:15] for according to the scripture
[43:18] he was the one to introduce the messiah
[43:22] and he knowed he had to be on earth in
[43:24] the days of his prophecy
[43:27] therefore he was lingering near to where
[43:29] he was preaching so much that he said
[43:31] there's one standing among you now
[43:34] now brother sister
[43:38] now there's one standing among you now
[43:41] he said that when he was here on earth
[43:42] also there's also one standing among you
[43:45] now but we know it's now also that you
[43:47] don't know who doesn't know the public
[43:49] there's no idea of it
[43:54] but this isn't hid from the bride
[43:57] it can't be
[44:00] let us be glad and rejoice for the
[44:02] marriage of the lamb has come
[44:04] amen
[44:06] see
[44:07] standing among you now that you don't
[44:09] know one among you right now he knew it
[44:12] he knew it he was there the hour was at
[44:14] hand
[44:16] now he said i've introduced you to him
[44:18] now i've got to decrease and he will
[44:22] increase
[44:25] what's he increasing to
[44:27] to a meeting in the air
[44:29] no body change
[44:32] all right
[44:33] i don't i don't want to keep you
[44:34] standing but this just a moment
[44:36] spoken words original seed 62 3 18 as
[44:40] the end time prophecies will repeat i
[44:43] believe as the first forerunner came
[44:46] from the wilderness and cried behold the
[44:48] lamb of god the second forerunner how
[44:51] many know what that second forerunner
[44:52] was the second forerunner of what
[44:57] the second coming
[45:01] see we're in the advent of the second
[45:02] coming
[45:04] of who christ
[45:08] all right now he says the end time
[45:10] prophecies repeat i believe the
[45:12] forerunner came to the wilderness cried
[45:13] behold the lamb of god the second
[45:15] forerunner will probably do the same by
[45:18] pointing the people to a word-born bride
[45:26] where's the lamb
[45:27] the lamb opened the seals
[45:32] where's the revelation
[45:33] where's the resurrection we're living in
[45:38] where is he
[45:40] pride form
[45:45] amen
[45:46] for what purpose
[45:48] for our meeting
[45:50] we have to have a spiritual union
[45:54] before we get there
[45:57] amen
[45:58] all right
[46:00] the prophet said now we see this day
[46:02] this scripture is being fulfilled in our
[46:04] midst
[46:05] ephesians 1
[46:07] 4
[46:08] according as he hath chosen us in him
[46:12] i'm talking about your position now
[46:15] your positive position talking about the
[46:18] bride that god's army
[46:20] soldiers individual according as he had
[46:22] chosen us in him before the foundation
[46:25] of the world praise the lord it didn't
[46:28] have a thing to do i didn't have
[46:29] anything to do with it
[46:32] i still don't
[46:36] i david still doesn't
[46:39] it's not my achievement
[46:41] it's god's achievement
[46:42] [Music]
[46:44] it's not me unveiled it's god unveiled
[46:50] amen are you with me all right
[46:53] now watch he said
[46:55] before the foundation of the world we
[46:57] were chosen in him that we should be
[46:59] holy
[47:00] and without blame before him in love now
[47:02] who's going to say it can't happen who's
[47:05] going to say it doesn't happen
[47:08] all right verse 5 having predestinated
[47:12] us unto the adoption placing of children
[47:15] by jesus christ position then
[47:18] adoption of children by jesus christ
[47:20] according to the good pleasure of whose
[47:23] will
[47:25] good thing it's not my will
[47:28] good thing it's not david's will you may
[47:30] be seated i won't keep you standing
[47:31] anymore
[47:34] amen
[47:35] unto the good pleasure
[47:37] of
[47:38] his will to the praise of the glory of
[47:42] his grace its grace see
[47:44] and what are we crying to the headstone
[47:46] our message is the capstone what are we
[47:48] crying
[47:50] grace grace unto it right
[47:54] nothing but grace
[47:57] grace isn't something you manufactured
[48:00] grace is a divine enablement that
[48:01] enabled you and placed you in him before
[48:04] the foundation of the world to hear the
[48:06] word in your season day and be the very
[48:08] manifestation of it that's the bride
[48:10] stand
[48:14] that's the bride's position
[48:18] all right
[48:19] now
[48:20] let's turn over here and let me just
[48:23] bring up something behind this ephesians
[48:25] 1 4
[48:26] to the faithful
[48:27] now paul in the first verse
[48:32] he says
[48:34] paul an apostle this is ephesians 1 1
[48:37] apostle of jesus christ by the will of
[48:39] god to the saints which are at ephesus
[48:42] and to the faithful in christ jesus
[48:45] listen to what the prophet says about
[48:47] this he said to the faithful in christ
[48:50] jesus now this letter is addressed to
[48:52] those not to the outside world
[48:55] paul wasn't preaching a sermon to the
[48:57] unsaved
[48:59] he was preaching to the saved the called
[49:02] out the separated
[49:04] the set aside
[49:06] and the faithful in the call
[49:10] now that's who he's addressed it to
[49:14] those in jesus
[49:17] the believer's position in christ that's
[49:20] who's he's addressed it to
[49:22] in jesus the believer's position is in
[49:26] christ and christ will only meet the
[49:29] believer can only the believer can only
[49:32] worship christ as he is positionally
[49:36] placed
[49:38] in christ
[49:40] now brother brown knew that didn't go
[49:42] over very well and he said i don't
[49:44] believe you get it
[49:46] so he said let me go another route look
[49:49] a believer cannot worship and has no
[49:52] right to worship neither do you have to
[49:55] take communion
[49:57] i'm just going to drop that in because i
[49:59] could go quote after quote on that
[50:01] all right
[50:04] he said you have no right to worship you
[50:06] cannot worship have no right to worship
[50:09] no man has a right to worship the lord
[50:11] outside of being in the body of the lord
[50:15] jesus christ
[50:17] how do you get in that body
[50:20] by one holy ghost baptism
[50:23] by one spirit are you placed in that
[50:26] body
[50:29] amen
[50:31] hallelujah
[50:33] all right
[50:34] let's go to jeremiah 29
[50:38] 29 11.
[50:45] i was pushed here at this going on
[50:48] and i didn't even get them marked down
[50:49] so i'll look them up as you look above
[50:52] 29-11 maybe that's better anyway
[50:59] let's just start with verse 10. i'm
[51:00] emphasizing 11 here but there's so much
[51:03] here
[51:04] first few verses
[51:05] for thus saith the lord
[51:08] that after 70 years that's the type of
[51:10] our seven ages

[51:50] to come to
[51:52] amen we have a position to come to

[53:14] tests and persecutions but your future
[53:17] is clear you're going to the other side
[53:19] i don't care what happens in the middle
[53:20] my brother spoke to that wednesday night
[53:23] the storm or was it i don't remember
[53:25] sunday or wednesday the storm

[53:30] other side
[53:32] he was in their midst
[53:34] he was present they had they didn't
[53:36] recognize their position

[55:25] all right
[55:27] revelations
[55:28] 1.
[55:32] revelations chapter 1
[55:34] verse 5.
[55:37] it's a salutation to start with verse 4
[55:40] john to the seven churches which are in
[55:42] asia grace be unto you and peace from
[55:44] him
[55:45] which is him
[55:46] grace from him which is
[55:50] which and which was and which is to come
[55:54] from the seven spirits which are before
[55:56] the throne and from jesus christ who is
[55:59] the faithful witness
[56:02] amen and you are my witnesses
[56:06] which is the faithful witness and the
[56:08] first begotten of the first begotten of
[56:12] the dead
[56:13] first one up
[56:15] amen who are you
[56:18] the first begotten of the dead and the
[56:20] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[56:22] him that loved us and washed us from our
[56:27] sins in his own blood
[56:29] and hath made us kings and priests unto
[56:33] god
[56:36] amen
[56:38] concerning jeremiah 29 11
[56:41] we just read
[56:43] now according to the word of god and let
[56:46] me just quote to you saint john 15 16
[56:48] you know it jesus said you have not
[56:50] chosen me but i have chosen you
[56:55] now according to the word of god the
[56:57] bride was chosen before the foundation
[56:59] of the world the choosing of the bride
[57:01] was purpose in himself
[57:04] that purpose was purposed in himself
[57:09] ephesians 1 9 you can find it and in
[57:11] romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of
[57:14] god according to election might stand
[57:20] amen who elected it
[57:23] he did
[57:25] how he elected
[57:26] by what he knew
[57:30] is that right or knowledge
[57:32] all right
[57:35] the purpose of god you can't read it any
[57:37] other way the heart purpose the eternal
[57:39] purpose of god was to take up the
[57:41] eternal the heart purpose listen the
[57:43] eternal prayer the heart purpose
[57:46] strong words
[57:48] this is god's own heart purpose
[57:51] it's god's only eternal purpose was to
[57:53] take a bride of his own choosing
[57:56] and that purpose was in himself
[58:00] praise the lord if that purpose with
[58:02] himself his purposes are perfect and
[58:04] complete
[58:06] not movable
[58:08] not changeable his purpose is perfect
[58:13] amen
[58:14] amen
[58:16] he won't change his purpose
[58:18] see
[58:20] of his own choosing and that purpose was
[58:22] in himself and being eternal him being
[58:25] eternal was decreed
[58:29] before the foundation of the world
[58:30] before you did either good or bad works
[58:35] before either either boy jacob or esau
[58:38] that he works
[58:39] they were chosen
[58:41] one he loved the other he hated
[58:44] before either one of them did any works
[58:48] amen
[58:50] jacob i loved
[58:52] esau hated is that right
[58:54] because jacob was his seed
[58:57] jacob was in himself jacob was
[59:02] jacob was the thought of god himself
[59:07] not the only thought but was a part of
[59:09] that thought of himself
[59:13] amen that's why he loved jacob
[59:17] all right
[59:19] now hold that paragraph 149 2 of the
[59:22] church age book watch carefully now and
[59:24] see this before there was ever a speck
[59:27] of stardust before god was god god is an
[59:30] object of adoration and no one was there
[59:32] to worship him so he was so he was at
[59:35] that time potentially god and he was
[59:37] known only as an eternal spirit and the
[59:40] bride was already in his mind
[59:45] i just read here
[59:48] jeremiah 29 11
[59:50] i know the thoughts that i think towards
[59:53] you
[59:55] brother branham said what about those
[59:58] thoughts of god they are eternal
[1:00:02] are they not amen
[1:00:06] uh-oh
[1:00:07] what about those thoughts of god i know
[1:00:10] those thoughts
[1:00:12] concerning you
[1:00:15] you were chosen himself therefore you
[1:00:17] are eternal
[1:00:19] i know those thoughts concerning you
[1:00:22] what about those thoughts they are
[1:00:24] eternal
[1:00:28] they are eternal thoughts there's only
[1:00:30] one form of eternal life that's god
[1:00:33] there is no other form of eternal life
[1:00:35] you cannot have eternal life and not be
[1:00:37] from god
[1:00:41] or of god not from god of god
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:51] the eternal thoughts of god let me ask
[1:00:52] you are the thoughts of god eternal if
[1:00:54] you can see this you will see many
[1:00:56] things
[1:00:58] if you can just get your position
[1:01:02] and recognize that this eternal is
[1:01:04] standing here in a body of time
[1:01:08] that he the person you are the word that
[1:01:10] you are the thought of god expressed in
[1:01:13] flesh is eternal
[1:01:24] it creates a different
[1:01:26] it creates a difference
[1:01:29] it makes you act different it makes you
[1:01:31] walk different
[1:01:33] so much so it offends the carnal man
[1:01:39] because they think whoever you think you
[1:01:40] are
[1:01:42] i'm just as eternal thought
[1:01:45] i'm his eternal word expressed in flesh
[1:01:49] that's what they killed jesus for you
[1:01:51] being a man make yourself god you say
[1:01:54] you're the son of god he said doesn't
[1:01:56] your word say that i said you are god's
[1:02:00] and how can you condemn me when i say
[1:02:01] i'm the son of god i came from god
[1:02:06] it was god it was god himself in some
[1:02:08] form
[1:02:11] and this is god himself
[1:02:13] in bride form
[1:02:18] god bless
[1:02:19] god with us
[1:02:20] god in us
[1:02:23] get your position people yeah
[1:02:27] amen are you okay
[1:02:29] is this okay

[1:02:34] down to the word a promise for the
[1:02:36] season
[1:02:38] we have a mighty unveiling of god
[1:02:41] in this hour
[1:02:42] the mystery that's been sealed in the
[1:02:44] book has been taken by the lamb and has
[1:02:46] been loose to the bride
[1:02:50] this unveiled mystery is the unwritten
[1:02:52] word that's been unwritten all along
[1:02:54] john couldn't write it it's been an
[1:02:55] unwritten word is now unveiled
[1:03:01] in you
[1:03:07] all right
[1:03:10] so they are eternal they are real
[1:03:13] his thoughts are god of god the thoughts
[1:03:16] of god do you realize when he thought of
[1:03:18] you he thought of himself
[1:03:20] the thoughts of god are real the
[1:03:22] thoughts of god are eternal they are
[1:03:24] real they're not just they're just not
[1:03:26] something that's the play thing it's
[1:03:27] just them it's imagination they're real
[1:03:30] they're more real than you are in this
[1:03:32] body they're more real than what you see
[1:03:35] they are not temporal they're eternal
[1:03:38] glory to god
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:43] all right
[1:03:44] this purpose this choosing this bride
[1:03:47] was in himself
[1:03:48] it was purpose in himself this was a
[1:03:51] part of himself he had to fulfill that
[1:03:53] part of himself this mystery was kept a
[1:03:56] mystery until the book was taken by the
[1:03:58] lamb in this day and seven seals were
[1:04:01] open
[1:04:02] and what it is that you unveiled is a
[1:04:04] still small voice
[1:04:07] and when the seventh seal opened it was
[1:04:09] a still small voice
[1:04:16] that's right
[1:04:18] that's exactly what it is
[1:04:21] that voice voice
[1:04:23] brother braham said that sealed been
[1:04:25] opened they say it's want to be closed
[1:04:26] brother braham said no it's open
[1:04:29] there's a voice in there
[1:04:32] amen
[1:04:33] amen and when elijah heard the voice it
[1:04:36] wasn't out here in the whirlwind and the
[1:04:38] earthquake and the hell that we said as
[1:04:40] our brother brought it wednesday it
[1:04:41] wasn't out there it was in her it was in
[1:04:44] him it was in him and elijah represented
[1:04:47] brother ramsey represented the church
[1:04:49] right there
[1:04:54] hallelujah
[1:04:56] there is their representation there is
[1:04:59] the thing the devil's trying to keep hid
[1:05:03] but it was kept hid from him
[1:05:05] since the foundational world in the back
[1:05:07] part of god's mind and he said i'll make
[1:05:09] it known when it's supposed to be known
[1:05:11] and it'll rapture a bride
[1:05:14] and the rapture's in progress
[1:05:16] brother braham said
[1:05:19] he said on the message god in simplicity
[1:05:21] albuquerque after the seals he said how
[1:05:23] do you know the bride how do you know
[1:05:25] the bride the rapture is not going on
[1:05:27] all the time
[1:05:31] he said pretty soon there's going to be
[1:05:32] one he said how do you know the last one
[1:05:34] will be caught up so on these days
[1:05:41] there's being a caught up are you being
[1:05:43] caught up you can say what a
[1:05:44] resurrection that was what about this
[1:05:46] one right amen what about this
[1:05:48] resurrection inside of you
[1:05:53] what a resurrection that is
[1:05:56] is that right
[1:05:58] amen all right
[1:06:00] so you see they're real they're eternal
[1:06:01] they're they are already real these
[1:06:03] thoughts of god are already real
[1:06:06] you can't stop eternity it never began
[1:06:09] and never did end do you realize
[1:06:11] who you are
[1:06:13] do you realize your position
[1:06:17] you're undefeatable
[1:06:20] you're invincible
[1:06:23] you the word living are invincible
[1:06:28] quit looking at the flesh man is ups and
[1:06:30] downs that's not even who you are the
[1:06:33] devil's pointing into that and you've
[1:06:34] got a choice you have a you have a power
[1:06:37] of choice to say no devil no i refuse to
[1:06:41] let you point me to that
[1:06:46] hallelujah
[1:06:48] that's exactly right
[1:06:50] you just don't recognize your authority
[1:06:51] because you don't know your position
[1:06:57] there you are
[1:06:59] well do i need to know that yes in order
[1:07:01] to make a rapture you're going to have
[1:07:03] to know it you've got to come to that
[1:07:05] and it'll take the holy ghost to do that
[1:07:07] you're saying well brother i need the
[1:07:09] holy ghost i'll tell you right now i'll
[1:07:10] tell you something right now the reason
[1:07:12] there's not more born again is because
[1:07:14] there's not been a true repentance
[1:07:20] that's another message in itself
[1:07:22] but there's got to be a godly sorrow a
[1:07:24] repentance of faith
[1:07:28] acceptance of what god did for you in
[1:07:30] faith and recognize you were there when
[1:07:32] he died for you you died for you
[1:07:34] there's got to be an acceptance of faith
[1:07:37] a real repentance then comes water
[1:07:39] baptism
[1:07:40] then comes the sanctifying power of the
[1:07:42] blood and i shall fill you with myself
[1:07:45] god can't lie the reason there's not
[1:07:48] many filled because there's not many
[1:07:49] true repentance
[1:07:56] that's exactly what it is
[1:08:01] amen there's not been a true repentance
[1:08:04] i'd like to preach on that i i have that
[1:08:06] in my heart i almost took it this
[1:08:07] morning
[1:08:09] no godly sorrow for sin
[1:08:12] oh i saw my friend do it i think i'll be
[1:08:14] baptized too
[1:08:16] i don't work
[1:08:17] there's got to be a repentance there's
[1:08:19] got to be a repentance of faith there's
[1:08:21] got to be turning around there's got to
[1:08:23] be an acceptance of what god did for you
[1:08:24] recognizing he did that for you
[1:08:28] godly sorrow for your sin
[1:08:31] laying yourself on the altar testifying
[1:08:33] of it that i died with him i raised him
[1:08:35] you're testifying publicly
[1:08:37] this is what's happening on the inside
[1:08:39] of me
[1:08:41] many are just go down a dry centering up
[1:08:43] a wet one
[1:08:45] because there's not been a true
[1:08:46] repentance i'll let that lay right there
[1:08:52] all right
[1:08:55] things that are to be
[1:08:57] now then
[1:09:00] when he came to the earth
[1:09:02] when god was manifested in fullness in
[1:09:04] jesus when he came to the earth this is
[1:09:06] 1205 65 things that are to be
[1:09:09] when he came to the earth and was
[1:09:11] manifested in flesh you were in him then
[1:09:15] because he was the word
[1:09:17] he was the fullness of the word
[1:09:20] the thoughts of god were expressed in a
[1:09:22] word he was the fullness of the word you
[1:09:25] were there then how do you know you have
[1:09:28] the evidence of it by the revelation of
[1:09:30] himself in
[1:09:32] you build my church upon the revelation
[1:09:35] of who i am
[1:09:37] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:09:39] against
[1:09:41] and if they're built upon the revelation
[1:09:43] of who he is then who are you when you
[1:09:44] grow up and build
[1:09:49] can't be another it just can't be
[1:09:51] another it's got to be him
[1:09:54] in the bride form amen
[1:09:57] because he had to fulfill the mystery of
[1:10:00] himself a full revelation of himself
[1:10:02] and that was spoken of and ministered to
[1:10:05] us by revelation 10 7
[1:10:07] and now we have a book and we should be
[1:10:09] eating it
[1:10:10] to see the revelation and the mystery
[1:10:12] and the fullness of the of god the
[1:10:14] mystery of god finished which is you
[1:10:20] hallelujah
[1:10:23] amen amen but too many things are coming
[1:10:26] in too many thinking too much this and
[1:10:28] too much of that and too much running
[1:10:31] and brother sister we have things to do
[1:10:32] i'm not condemning that but you've got
[1:10:34] to take time
[1:10:36] it should never anything else ever have
[1:10:39] preeminence over you
[1:10:41] i don't care if it's jobs or what it is
[1:10:43] over the word of god
[1:10:46] you do that then it's become an idol to
[1:10:48] you
[1:10:50] you're bowing to it
[1:10:54] he has to have first place
[1:10:57] what did the word say about
[1:10:59] your life
[1:11:01] your walk
[1:11:03] what the words say about
[1:11:05] this
[1:11:06] situation that situation instead you
[1:11:09] want to go to your reasoning
[1:11:12] oh you're a femoral agent i'm coming to
[1:11:14] that you have a choice
[1:11:16] thank god for the power of choice
[1:11:21] that's not a negative thing
[1:11:23] that's a very positive thing
[1:11:27] because we can choose when something
[1:11:29] presented on the battlefield we can
[1:11:30] choose either take it or leave it
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:38] people are in a turmoil they're upset
[1:11:40] they're discouraged they're dismayed
[1:11:42] they're they're beat down you can see it
[1:11:44] on their life why because they're not
[1:11:46] receiving the word they're believing a
[1:11:48] lie
[1:11:57] the devil's bringing it through their
[1:11:58] gates of reasoning imagination memory or
[1:12:01] conscience
[1:12:06] we're going to come to something here
[1:12:08] god will help me get through this
[1:12:10] all right
[1:12:11] not say if you will he does
[1:12:14] you were in him then when he came the
[1:12:15] earth manifested in flesh you were in
[1:12:17] him then because he was word in the
[1:12:18] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:12:20] god are you with me and the word was god
[1:12:23] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:12:25] among us the word was made flesh
[1:12:27] therefore you walked with him when you
[1:12:29] were when you were in him you walked
[1:12:32] with him when he was there on earth you
[1:12:34] walked with him you suffered with him
[1:12:36] you died with him you was buried with
[1:12:38] him and now you are risen with him amen
[1:12:43] your wisdom your risen
[1:12:45] your risen do you hear me bride do you
[1:12:48] hear the word this morning when he
[1:12:50] raised you raised
[1:12:53] hell is defeated the devil is defeated
[1:13:01] they're underneath his feet uh your feet
[1:13:08] he's defeated
[1:13:10] he can't live anymore he's gone he's
[1:13:12] defeated but he he'll become alive if
[1:13:15] you let him
[1:13:17] i'm talking about doubt i'm talking
[1:13:19] about unbelief i'm talking about the
[1:13:21] presentation of something contrary to
[1:13:23] the word in your mind in the
[1:13:25] battleground
[1:13:29] you can either take the faith that's in
[1:13:30] your heart that god presented to you or
[1:13:33] you're going to take doubt
[1:13:35] it's got to come from one of two sources
[1:13:40] one or two powers
[1:13:44] brother sister bride my fathers my
[1:13:47] sisters you're in the battle
[1:13:49] you are in a battle
[1:13:55] amen i'm in a battle
[1:13:57] every day we're in a battle but we are
[1:13:59] absolutely victorious
[1:14:02] we're not on a losing side there's
[1:14:04] nothing in the bible said the bride's a
[1:14:06] loser
[1:14:09] christ isn't a loser how can she be a
[1:14:11] loser christ is sinless how can she not
[1:14:14] be anything but sinless
[1:14:16] she's in him
[1:14:20] this message of this hour this opening
[1:14:22] of these seals wasn't sent everyone it
[1:14:24] was sent to only the bride
[1:14:30] this is what will bring about rapturing
[1:14:32] faith
[1:14:33] and it's happening
[1:14:36] it's happening
[1:14:37] the rapture is in progress
[1:14:40] and there's many going to be left behind
[1:14:41] because they thought well i belong to a
[1:14:43] message church
[1:14:47] i was a participator in the message but
[1:14:49] you missed possession
[1:14:57] got to be a possessor
[1:14:59] if there's even a draw of god in your
[1:15:01] heart if there's even a inkling of a
[1:15:03] desire run to it
[1:15:06] don't run away from it run into it
[1:15:09] there's only one thing going to satisfy
[1:15:10] that thirst and it won't be anything of
[1:15:13] your flesh of your thinking of the world
[1:15:16] nothing not a magazine not a picture
[1:15:19] nothing sports i don't care what it is
[1:15:22] nothing will satisfy that thirst but the
[1:15:24] thirst quencher which is jesus christ
[1:15:28] in you
[1:15:30] hallelujah
[1:15:34] you walked with him you were in him you
[1:15:36] risen with him and now you're a
[1:15:38] manifested attribute of god an attribute
[1:15:41] think of it you're an attribute nobody
[1:15:43] can take your position nobody can take
[1:15:45] your place
[1:15:47] nobody can bring the word like brother
[1:15:49] chris nobody can bring the word like
[1:15:51] brother paul nobody else can bring it
[1:15:53] like i bring it
[1:15:58] but we're all in him
[1:16:00] it's an attribute
[1:16:02] are you with me it's a measure of
[1:16:04] himself
[1:16:07] so denominational spirits are out of the
[1:16:09] question
[1:16:11] we're not one because of our church
[1:16:13] we're one because we're in christ
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:23] christ can't fail
[1:16:28] you're now seated in heavenly places
[1:16:32] already raised resurrected to new life
[1:16:35] and setting in heavenly places in christ
[1:16:38] jesus already
[1:16:42] what
[1:16:43] what is there to fear
[1:16:48] why are you why are we being so
[1:16:51] have so much anxiety and so fretful
[1:16:58] do you not believe that he's in control
[1:17:01] do you see your position
[1:17:06] feed people feed ask god to reveal the
[1:17:09] word to you
[1:17:11] well i just read a little scripture a
[1:17:13] day and that's good that's fine but oh i
[1:17:14] said amen i did a little prayer
[1:17:17] no
[1:17:18] drink
[1:17:19] and drink and drink a little more and
[1:17:22] push out what's in you already
[1:17:25] that's hungering and thirsting for more
[1:17:27] of god
[1:17:30] amen
[1:17:32] amen amen
[1:17:35] already raised
[1:17:36] that means that means so much to us
[1:17:39] nowadays church that means so much to
[1:17:41] see
[1:17:42] so much to us to see ourself
[1:17:44] individual
[1:17:46] individual you
[1:17:48] he's speaking to you this morning he's
[1:17:51] speaking to you
[1:17:55] he's dealing with you
[1:17:57] you
[1:17:58] he's dealing because he loves you he
[1:18:00] wants you to surrender and give yourself
[1:18:02] completely to him lay your veil on his
[1:18:05] shoulders
[1:18:07] he cares for you
[1:18:09] he knows what you're going through be
[1:18:11] happy
[1:18:13] you have nothing to be discouraged over
[1:18:16] start looking at the things that god's
[1:18:18] done
[1:18:20] not what you wish would happen
[1:18:22] let go of your reasoning
[1:18:25] let go of your thinking well it's got to
[1:18:27] be this way release your thinking about
[1:18:29] it god is sovereign he'll do what he
[1:18:32] wants to do but he's perfect in all he
[1:18:34] does
[1:18:38] we don't add our thinking into it i
[1:18:40] don't say i don't know sometimes these
[1:18:42] scriptures come together i think where
[1:18:43] it's happening i don't know where to go
[1:18:44] just keep moving just keep going
[1:18:47] and it fits
[1:18:51] it fits
[1:18:57] god works those many things contrary to
[1:19:00] our reasoning even radical to our own
[1:19:01] human thinking
[1:19:03] let go of it
[1:19:05] the devil wants to capitalize on that
[1:19:08] wants to capitalize on your feelings
[1:19:10] want to capitalize well this one did
[1:19:12] this one to me what did you do
[1:19:20] oh well self in the picture it's him
[1:19:22] it's her
[1:19:24] no it's you
[1:19:26] you just haven't completely
[1:19:28] totally
[1:19:30] become dependent
[1:19:32] on your
[1:19:34] husband you're flirting with the devil
[1:19:43] am i saying you're cast away no i'm
[1:19:45] saying repent
[1:19:46] get back line back up with the truth
[1:19:49] god isn't saying this to put you down
[1:19:51] he's saying this to release you to set
[1:19:54] you free this light is coming forth this
[1:19:56] morning for that purpose
[1:19:59] i don't like the way you preach and let
[1:20:01] go of how i preach
[1:20:05] listen to the word
[1:20:08] they didn't like john the baptist either
[1:20:11] in fact jesus looked upon him with
[1:20:12] angered eyes
[1:20:14] they didn't like that either
[1:20:15] when he said he's god in the flesh
[1:20:22] see
[1:20:23] it's our own stinking thinking that gets
[1:20:25] in the way
[1:20:28] own carnal mind
[1:20:31] but you don't have to be that way
[1:20:33] you don't have to let that happen when
[1:20:36] you know your position
[1:20:41] you know
[1:20:42] you've been given free moral agency
[1:20:46] to make a choice
[1:20:49] you don't have to accept what the devil
[1:20:51] is presenting to you
[1:20:53] eve did not have to accept
[1:20:55] but she stopped to listen
[1:21:00] and the devil swept in
[1:21:03] reasoned with her why god wouldn't keep
[1:21:06] his word
[1:21:10] you let that same devil come down here
[1:21:12] and move you through your senses and
[1:21:14] your reasoning and your imagination and
[1:21:16] your memory either to move you away from
[1:21:18] the word
[1:21:20] faith does not reason
[1:21:23] faith believes the word
[1:21:25] you don't have to put your reasoning in
[1:21:27] your your thinking upon the word and put
[1:21:29] your own your own opinion in it the
[1:21:31] words perfect
[1:21:33] the word is complete the word is
[1:21:35] flawless
[1:21:36] the word is my
[1:21:38] absolute
[1:21:40] right perfect in itself and unlimited in
[1:21:43] its power
[1:21:46] how can you add anything to a perfect
[1:21:48] how can you take away anything to a
[1:21:50] perfect
[1:21:51] so quit trying to do it
[1:21:53] you either believe in your soul you
[1:21:55] believe or you don't believe right then
[1:21:57] let that dominate that mind let that
[1:21:59] dominate that battlefield
[1:22:02] let the word dominate
[1:22:06] you place it you place it god's waiting
[1:22:08] to see what your decision is you place
[1:22:11] the word
[1:22:16] amen when satan comes with that you
[1:22:18] either accept it or reject it
[1:22:20] you either give the word the release and
[1:22:22] say this is what's written this is
[1:22:24] written satan i don't believe anything
[1:22:26] else you're telling me this is god's
[1:22:28] word
[1:22:35] amen i passed out to reason i kept south
[1:22:37] your thinking
[1:22:39] right
[1:22:41] you say well how well he might come and
[1:22:42] say how is he going to do it how can you
[1:22:44] do that how can you get well being
[1:22:47] you've been 25 years in such a condition
[1:22:51] i get well because god said so he can't
[1:22:54] lie he said he healed me that sells it
[1:22:57] let the word settle it
[1:23:05] means so much to see ourselves
[1:23:06] positionally placed
[1:23:09] the devil is almost harmless 311 62
[1:23:12] greatest battle ever fought the devil is
[1:23:14] almost harmless unless he have something
[1:23:16] to work in
[1:23:18] you remember those devils
[1:23:21] that were cast out of legion
[1:23:23] that he had they want to do more
[1:23:25] mischievousness so they wanted to go in
[1:23:27] the hogs so devils must have something
[1:23:29] to work in somebody to work through
[1:23:35] and you let
[1:23:38] or don't let
[1:23:42] amen
[1:23:43] i didn't hear any men boy this is pretty
[1:23:44] silent
[1:23:46] you know that's the truth you let or
[1:23:48] don't let
[1:23:52] do you know your position in christ
[1:24:00] you know the word is nigh thee even in
[1:24:02] thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:24:04] the word of faith
[1:24:07] the word of faith
[1:24:10] faith takes this final resting place
[1:24:13] anchored place in the living word in the
[1:24:15] word of god
[1:24:19] that's where it rests
[1:24:22] it doesn't move from that
[1:24:25] it's finished
[1:24:28] as long as you hold that there devil
[1:24:30] cannot punch a hole through it
[1:24:34] we just don't know our position yet
[1:24:40] too many other things the devil's
[1:24:42] brought before you that takes up the
[1:24:43] time
[1:24:44] instead of the thing the channel that
[1:24:46] god comes through to reveal it to you
[1:24:48] faith comes by hearing the word
[1:24:57] yes sir that's right
[1:25:02] because faith rests in the word yes
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:09] i'm talking about god's faith there's
[1:25:11] two kinds of faith brother branson what
[1:25:12] we're talking about on perfect faith
[1:25:14] we're talking about a different kind of
[1:25:15] faith we're talking about perfect faith
[1:25:21] all right
[1:25:23] that's the way god does too he has to
[1:25:25] have us he's depending on us to work
[1:25:28] through us
[1:25:31] not to your
[1:25:32] not to your your carnal mind oh bless
[1:25:35] god i have this and that word but no
[1:25:37] fruit of the season no fruit for the
[1:25:39] word for the season
[1:25:42] you're trying to get you're trying to
[1:25:44] get
[1:25:46] you're trying to get an uh
[1:25:49] a relationship with god so your carnal
[1:25:51] works it don't work
[1:25:56] it don't work
[1:25:57] when you're running out there leaving
[1:25:59] your own position where you ought to be
[1:26:01] in the ministry god gave you you're
[1:26:03] running out there flirting with other
[1:26:04] things
[1:26:08] because you don't take the word you
[1:26:10] can't see the word you're missing it
[1:26:14] and if you're missing it then not
[1:26:16] discerning what scripture or not you
[1:26:18] lack the holy ghost
[1:26:20] think you have it because you shouted or
[1:26:22] did some great thing or prophesied
[1:26:27] i still sign you got the holy ghost
[1:26:30] that may be a sign that the holy ghost
[1:26:32] spoke if it's the truth but that's no
[1:26:35] sign that you have the word yourself
[1:26:37] in the soul it's not been birthed yet
[1:26:40] because you're not discerning what's
[1:26:43] truth in air
[1:26:45] you're missing
[1:26:50] you're basing that on some
[1:26:52] something in the past some like motion
[1:26:54] some feeling well it happened i did this
[1:26:57] but where's the revelation of the word
[1:26:59] in your life now
[1:27:10] all right
[1:27:13] i was standing with brother wood i've
[1:27:15] got to hurry with this just get to a
[1:27:17] couple things before i close i was
[1:27:18] standing with brother wood and brother
[1:27:20] sophman
[1:27:21] about 10 o'clock at night he's still in
[1:27:23] the messy greatest battle ever fought
[1:27:25] and i was looking up towards the sky at
[1:27:27] a great awe came over me and i said just
[1:27:29] look all that great heavenly host and i
[1:27:31] said everything is perfectly in harmony
[1:27:35] and i thought of the order of that
[1:27:37] heavenly host and one of them
[1:27:39] not one of them is out of place
[1:27:42] everyone keeps its time perfectly
[1:27:47] now you tell me
[1:27:50] who achieved that
[1:27:55] god did he put it there
[1:27:59] amen he placed it
[1:28:01] they work according to his timepiece
[1:28:03] it's his achievement do you realize
[1:28:06] that the holy ghost in you
[1:28:08] and bringing you through the word by
[1:28:09] revelation is god's achievement
[1:28:12] and that he's going to bring you exactly
[1:28:14] to like those stars
[1:28:18] amen
[1:28:20] in heaven in their position
[1:28:22] the great army in their place
[1:28:25] everything moving by the word of god
[1:28:28] you get a bride that recognizes what she
[1:28:30] is and watch what will happen you get
[1:28:32] every member to recognize
[1:28:34] that's all it's waiting on
[1:28:37] their position
[1:28:39] there's nothing going to stop a body
[1:28:41] change it's already working
[1:28:43] it's already in me
[1:28:46] god's bringing me right to that place
[1:28:48] step by step in the light
[1:28:50] you see
[1:28:52] in him was life
[1:28:53] and the life was the light in used life
[1:28:57] anybody here got eternal life
[1:29:00] where's the light now
[1:29:04] in him was life and the life was the
[1:29:06] light
[1:29:09] are we in him amen what's his message
[1:29:13] light
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:18] amen amen
[1:29:20] that was a simple way to say it but
[1:29:22] that's the truth so what are you
[1:29:25] jesus said you're the light
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:30] because you're in me you're part of me
[1:29:32] i'm in you you and me in that day you'll
[1:29:34] know this you won't imagine this this is
[1:29:36] going to be known you're i'm in you you
[1:29:38] and me
[1:29:39] i'm in my father father and me i and you
[1:29:41] you and me all that god was he poured to
[1:29:43] christ all christ was is where
[1:29:47] where's god
[1:29:50] where's christ
[1:29:54] what's your position
[1:29:59] is this revealed in your heart
[1:30:01] or are you just playing church and
[1:30:02] playing the message
[1:30:05] putting other things before him
[1:30:08] no zeal because you have no discernment
[1:30:09] of what the message is i'm not saying
[1:30:11] you're not sanctified but i see these
[1:30:13] things and we see and and your fruit is
[1:30:15] bearing for something that's not
[1:30:16] discernment of god
[1:30:19] whether it's in dressing whether it's
[1:30:21] what you do your your fruit your bearing
[1:30:23] it's wrong fruit
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:30] all right
[1:30:31] what's the fruit the word for the season
[1:30:33] it's not ministering the word for the
[1:30:35] season
[1:30:37] what's the word for the season
[1:30:39] see
[1:30:43] all right
[1:30:45] now
[1:30:46] and when i begin to think that not one
[1:30:47] of those stars get out of their place
[1:30:50] not one of them get out of their place
[1:30:51] they're all set in place and if there's
[1:30:53] a moving anywhere of them what about the
[1:30:56] moving of the bride of them
[1:30:58] of them for a cause it's for a cause and
[1:31:01] will affect this earth
[1:31:03] you say well in the natural effects this
[1:31:05] earth we know that we've seen that
[1:31:07] stars line up move into the position
[1:31:09] they affect the earth is that right what
[1:31:11] about you as a star getting in your
[1:31:12] position i wonder how much earth it
[1:31:14] would affect
[1:31:19] i wonder if it would affect this earth
[1:31:21] i wonder if it affect the earth's of
[1:31:23] others and really bring out what's in
[1:31:25] their heart by the preaching of the
[1:31:26] truth
[1:31:28] is that right
[1:31:30] exactly
[1:31:34] right you just watch that little bride
[1:31:36] get to moving in the position she's in
[1:31:38] it stirs up things
[1:31:41] some take offense the others say it's
[1:31:42] just what i've been looking for praise
[1:31:44] be to god i'm released
[1:31:48] it's the difference
[1:31:50] takes one separates one
[1:31:53] take one leave one take one leave one
[1:31:55] take one leave one individual take one
[1:31:57] leave one you say that's not happening
[1:31:58] it is
[1:32:02] oh there's a combining going on
[1:32:05] and it's under a mighty wind of the holy
[1:32:07] ghost
[1:32:08] and it's shaking things up
[1:32:10] because there's a bride seeing her
[1:32:12] position and knowing who she is
[1:32:15] and knowing she's the word of promise
[1:32:16] for this hour made manifest
[1:32:19] she sees him she knows he's present
[1:32:27] god let us see what we're looking at or
[1:32:28] let us let us look at what we're seeing
[1:32:32] really see it
[1:32:33] amen
[1:32:34] god open our eyes it has to be by
[1:32:36] revelation you can't intellectualize it
[1:32:38] you can't i can tell you by revelation
[1:32:40] what i'm seeing and i can't explain it
[1:32:42] to you
[1:32:43] you talk about a paradox
[1:32:45] but god made it that way in fact he said
[1:32:47] he would say things in such a way to
[1:32:50] separate some to make some to leave make
[1:32:52] some to ponder
[1:32:56] is that right
[1:32:58] but when you know that you know who you
[1:33:00] are in and who's in you
[1:33:02] there's nothing going to shake that
[1:33:03] revelation brother sister you can't
[1:33:05] shake it there's no shaking to it oh
[1:33:08] it's shaking it they tried satan will
[1:33:09] try to shake it and try to do everything
[1:33:10] he can to shake it but it can't be moved
[1:33:15] amen amen amen amen
[1:33:18] hallelujah all right
[1:33:21] so
[1:33:23] i thought then if that
[1:33:25] it's effective it he said he says
[1:33:27] effective they move into other spots
[1:33:29] it's effective it affects everything and
[1:33:31] i thought then if that great heavenly
[1:33:32] host like that to keep its place is
[1:33:34] making everything in order what about
[1:33:36] the disorder of the earthly host
[1:33:40] amen when one gets out of order throws
[1:33:42] the whole thing out of cater the whole
[1:33:44] program is upset when one member gets
[1:33:46] out of order we should continually
[1:33:47] strive to keep the order of the spirit
[1:33:51] if this group gathered under this roof
[1:33:54] this morning
[1:33:55] would be in such harmony that the holy
[1:33:58] spirit would place every member of the
[1:33:59] body
[1:34:00] would place
[1:34:02] that's here
[1:34:03] this morning in such harmony till there
[1:34:05] would till their till there would be a
[1:34:08] spontaneous healing of of
[1:34:10] spirit and body it'll just if we just
[1:34:12] hold our position
[1:34:16] healing of the soul also
[1:34:19] you know and
[1:34:22] well i won't touch on that
[1:34:24] and the only thing that he is waiting
[1:34:26] for is for his army to get their
[1:34:28] position
[1:34:29] the only thing
[1:34:31] that he's waiting for is for his army to
[1:34:33] get their position like the stars get
[1:34:36] the position
[1:34:37] i think that's worth reading again
[1:34:40] the only thing that he's waiting for is
[1:34:42] for his army to get their position like
[1:34:45] the stars get the position that's why
[1:34:47] the seven seals were opened
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:35:01] when this great battle started earth the
[1:35:02] mind was chosen because decisions were
[1:35:04] made
[1:35:06] decisions were made in the mind
[1:35:08] but those decisions came from some
[1:35:11] source
[1:35:13] don't you miss that
[1:35:14] because it isn't just the decision of
[1:35:16] your carnal mind it had to come from a
[1:35:18] source but displaced in that mind
[1:35:21] that's where the decisions made
[1:35:25] you act on one or the other
[1:35:28] amen you say one or the other one or
[1:35:30] other power
[1:35:33] amen are you with me all right there's
[1:35:35] only two powers
[1:35:37] you've got to make he said it's the
[1:35:39] battleground of your mind he said he
[1:35:41] said
[1:35:42] that's where you meet your enemy and
[1:35:44] you've got to make your choice it meets
[1:35:47] you
[1:35:51] god is waiting wanting and waiting to
[1:35:54] see what your decision is
[1:35:58] see he's partnered with you he's
[1:36:00] partnered with man now what's your
[1:36:02] decision
[1:36:04] you speak the word
[1:36:06] how many is in that harmony
[1:36:09] i've got if i can get to it the lord
[1:36:10] willing here you speak the word he said
[1:36:12] i'll perform it
[1:36:14] right all right
[1:36:17] what word faith
[1:36:20] in a word
[1:36:21] the word the scripture the the thought
[1:36:25] revealed in a word
[1:36:29] amen
[1:36:30] amen all right
[1:36:33] that's where satan meets you is in the
[1:36:35] mind
[1:36:36] if you know your position in christ then
[1:36:38] what is your decision in the trial the
[1:36:41] test the circumstance or that thought
[1:36:43] presented to you contrary to the word
[1:36:45] what's your decision
[1:36:49] decisions are made in the mind not by
[1:36:51] your carnal mind but they are made by
[1:36:54] the mind of christ in your soul
[1:36:58] amen are you with me i'm talking to the
[1:37:00] believer
[1:37:01] your position see your positions
[1:37:05] your position in the battle
[1:37:08] and your position
[1:37:10] positions in the battle you meet satan
[1:37:13] on the battlefield your mind with the
[1:37:14] word the sword of the holy spirit the
[1:37:18] atomic bomb so because the decision is
[1:37:22] brought from the word
[1:37:23] or the decision is brought from
[1:37:27] what satan presented you either let or
[1:37:29] don't let
[1:37:32] you let the word or you shut the door
[1:37:35] and open the other
[1:37:36] whatever you put on the battlefield
[1:37:39] you're going to listen to him or you're
[1:37:40] going to refuse it
[1:37:44] when you know your position you wouldn't
[1:37:46] refuse it i mean you wouldn't you
[1:37:49] wouldn't re you'd refuse him satan you
[1:37:51] would refuse that
[1:37:53] reasoning see
[1:37:54] all right because the mind because
[1:37:56] you're because your
[1:37:59] soul has christ you have the mind of
[1:38:01] christ
[1:38:04] so where's your decision from
[1:38:07] your feelings your senses
[1:38:10] or the mind of christ
[1:38:14] you are a free moral agent
[1:38:18] you bring the word you bring it in the
[1:38:20] channel of your thought
[1:38:22] you have to bring the word into the
[1:38:24] channel of your thought
[1:38:26] you are a free moral agent to choose
[1:38:28] what's in what you choose what's in your
[1:38:30] soul faith or accept what the senses are
[1:38:33] telling you
[1:38:34] doubt fear reasoning etc just what i
[1:38:36] said now don't you let satan fortify
[1:38:38] nothing you keep the word fortified
[1:38:42] amen
[1:38:45] he said that's what i'm trying to get
[1:38:47] you to do out there anoint you
[1:38:49] he said that's what that's what he's
[1:38:51] trying to do
[1:38:53] each one of you out there is to anoint
[1:38:55] you that satan is and the only thing you
[1:38:57] have to do now that's what he that's
[1:38:59] what he tried to get each one of you to
[1:39:01] do out there anoint you and the only
[1:39:03] thing you have to do now and you're a
[1:39:05] free moral agent now you can accept it
[1:39:07] if you want to but kick it out
[1:39:13] thank god
[1:39:17] for decision
[1:39:19] if eid hadn't accepted that moment if
[1:39:21] she had to stop that moment to listen
[1:39:23] don't stop for nothing don't stop now
[1:39:25] you can accept it if you want to but
[1:39:27] kick it out if eve if see don't listen
[1:39:30] don't stop for nothing don't stop
[1:39:33] i went into a football stadium one time
[1:39:35] and going to preach and i stopped at the
[1:39:37] door now listen i'm not going to be very
[1:39:39] much longer here just just listen
[1:39:42] i went into a football stadium he said
[1:39:44] and above the door it said it's not the
[1:39:45] size of the dog in the fight you've
[1:39:47] heard this many times
[1:39:50] it's not the size of the dog
[1:39:52] we don't walk by sight we walk by faith
[1:39:54] so it's not the size of the dog in the
[1:39:56] fight
[1:39:57] it's the size of the fight
[1:40:00] that's in the dog
[1:40:03] now that's a big dog over here
[1:40:05] this brother jason's a big dog
[1:40:09] but am i going to look at how big he is

[1:40:14] the fight inside of him what determines
[1:40:16] it he'll be a big dog with a lot of
[1:40:18] fight or he can be a little guy
[1:40:20] with a lot of fight too
[1:40:24] and i'm a little guy
[1:40:26] but we're brothers
[1:40:30] and we both have the same fight
[1:40:34] in us that fight is the word amen
[1:40:38] so it's not the size of the dog it's the
[1:40:41] size of the fight
[1:40:43] amen that wins the battle

[1:40:51] churches all these other things and
[1:40:52] these things against it doesn't matter
