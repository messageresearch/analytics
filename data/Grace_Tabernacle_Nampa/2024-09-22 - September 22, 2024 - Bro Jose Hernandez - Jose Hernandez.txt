I I have to say I couldn't be more proud of them my wife my boys we are so blessed we we have a wonderful time every time we come here we are blessed when we come here this is a special place I guess that's what it's called Grace Tabernacle we receive Grace we receive Grace from God the reason I sing I wanted this song is because we want to be in The Presence of Jehovah every day of [Music] life because when you're in The Presence of Jehovah troubles vanish problems go [Music] away just being In The Presence of Jehovah you become a new person that's what we want to be in The Presence of Jehovah and the reason we are here today is because we don't want to be called Christians only it's because we are looking to meet Jesus on that day we we don't want to be just be one of any other church when God called Abraham he called him he wanted to have a peculiar people and and peculiar peculiar means different than the rest so you brother and sister You're A peculiar [Music] people that's why we act different because this is not our home amen I say thank you brother Paul for the confidence once again I always appreciate his love for my family and the church as well is very loving and kind to [Music] us I'm afraid that one day I might not want to leave this place move here I don't know but you know the good thing is the same God that you serve here is the same God we serve in Tri Cities and half of the congregation that is in tric City send you greetings to you the half is here so praise the Lord uh please continue prayers for us as we continue praying for you amen please before you sit down I know you're going to be sit uh for a little long so I'm not saying I'm going to be here too long so but uh let's go to the Book of Jeremiah thank you sister and brother has been pondering this for a long time I I Jeremiah 2 Jeremiah 2 verse 13 amen for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and heal them themselves heal them out ssts broken ssts that can hold no water let's jump to Jeremiah 17133 it reads like this oh Lord the hope of Israel all that forsake the shall be asham and they that depart from me shall be written on the earth because they have forsaken the Lord the Fountain of Living Waters Heavenly Father we thank you Lord this opportunity father we come before you because you are the fountain Living Waters so we want to give we want to drink from you today father we ask you to come and speak to the people this morning help me to set aside myself father since I'm a useless man father but I just want to be your mouthpiece this morning Father so you can speak to your children in the name of the Lord Jesus amen you may be seated once again I want to say thank you to all of you for your kindness and and love towards us and I I always pray that the Lord help me to set aside myself because there's nothing good out of me but it's God the one who cares for his people amen and supplied all our needs amen amen so here the scripture is is uh telling us about the is is talking about Israel forsaking God now forsaken according to the dictionary is to depart from Leave Behind or live it alone abandon neglect to let loose set free or let go so we as human beings tend to to do what our heart leads us to to do but the Bible says that you can even trust on your heart that's right I think in Proverbs says as the man thinketh in his heart so is he and In this passage God is referring to the spring of Living Water he is the one who supplies all the needs to his people all people's needs we have read we have seen many of us we probably seen the Ten Commandments movie and how we we see the the the the the the lord gave to Moses the instructions he gave to Moses promises that he was going to fulfill and this journey was going to be a short Journey but because of the hardness of the heart of the people it turned into a generation now it's God's fault no it's not God's fault right it's because we have the the the free will you have the free will you willingly are here today or someone came here in handcuffs no one is your free will now the people of Israel they had the free will to trust in what Moses was saying but it's very difficult to trust a man to trust another man especially when when when you think you know most when you think you know everything right oh I read the Bible from cover to cover and and and I know the Bible yeah my brother R says do you know the author of The Bible that's the difference because a theologian can Comm and and and and recite the Bible to you from cover to cover but that doesn't mean you're getting out of something out of God because the word of God has to be revealed to you that's right the Revelation is the one is taking it taking you out from the pit of Mighty clay or you know you know Revelation is the one took my mom out of the Catholicism I was talking to a guy this week and I didn't finish the conversation I have to when I get back I have to take it take that conversation again because he was saying how come you he knows my brother how come your your brother is Catholic you're a Christian I said because he didn't go to to church when your mom started going to Christian church and say he was here by the time my mom start going to a Christian Church I said but how come you guys well I say you have to have Revelation and a lot of people a lot of Catholic people I hope not I'm not offend anyone today but a lot of Catholic people are Catholics choose by tradition my my my grand Grandpa was Catholic my grand great grandpa was and so on so and so what is the Revelation right and you know what we can become Christians just by tradition too right that's right absolutely the moment we start just letting letting ourselves be guide by someone and not going to the Fountain of Living Water which is the word of God we become traditional Christians there's there's a lot of people out there they call themselves Christians I know a lot of them but that's not the point amen God is refer to as the spring of Living Water who his people have abandoned tried to do things their own way how many times we tried to do things our own way how did I worked it out I heard many people the backslide and then when they come back they say you know what I'm not the same person because I got hurt the wounds that I got and then the scars stay there forever so it doesn't work out good when you abandon God they tried to do their their own way by digging their own sisters and turning away from the god this passage shows that God gave his people everything they needed yes right and he's the same God today he is the one who's given us the same the the the same promises whatever you need you have need of I heard a testimony of um uh American guy who the age of 13 15 start getting into trouble back and forth prison and finally when he did really really bad things that he deserved life sentence he got into in Max prison and in that prison he met a a guy and this guy guy was the son of a pastor so he knew he knew about God in his youth mom was praying for him dad was praying for him but he never listened he went out and and get involved with friends he got him in trouble so he gave his heart impr prison to God this Sons this pastor sons was his Pastor there in prison so everybody knew that he was going to be a life sentence he wasn't sentenced yet but for what he did I don't remember what he did certainly was going to be a life sentence and even the the cellmate or the guard whatever they call it there he said I don't know what you did or I don't know what happened to you but you're going to be a free man in a week even himself was in shocked when he gave his heart to God that's that's the kind of God we serve right and and when he gave his heart to God he said Lord I want to do whatever you called me to do and here that man was thinking is I'm going to be in prison all my life but you know what happened to him he went free in prison learned Spanish he moved to Mexico City and he had over 100 churches as he's overseeing over there see that's the kind of God we serve when you stay faithful to him because God is not going to let you go he's always there for you amen his people the the Israel people they they had evidence what God did for them the mighty hand brought them out of Egypt but they forget yeah because we as humans we easily to forget the good things oh but someone does something wrong to us we never forget we have really good memory for those things you help someone they probably say thank you at the moment but he'll forget about what you what good you did for him oh but he comes back and asks you for help and you say sorry I can't he will never forget that that's a humankind what can you do about it only God can change those kind of Hearts let's continue here brother Branham and the broken sister says well we notice that think about sisters that is different from a well sister will get empty see one day running around away from God you will find out that you have nothing you'll find out that you're nothing you'll find out that you're you're you're always searching for something and that's something you can't find it out there you can really you can rely upon s a sister he has to rely on depend depend on on the rains because if if there is rain you have water in your sister if there is no rain your sister is empty depend upon the rains that fall in the summer or winter whatever it is usually in the winter time when the snow and rain comes then he runs water off of the SST he doesn't get water on its own and one at one point it's going to dry so if you leave that water set there you cannot drink that water anymore because frogs can get in lizards can get in snakes but a Fountain of Living Water is always coming out out clean in pure water you know when we lived in the in the jungle per se over there when I was a kid we had a a well but it wasn't a well like here that you have pump and all nice and fancy things or this this one war with gravity for some reason wasn't the up in the mountain inside the Rocks there was a little water fountain there so my parents they built a little bit of a a pond there when we we got we put some uh cloth like filtered water cloth in the in the hose and that water went by gravity all the way to the house and tastes good because we protected we covered that pond with with some kind of protection that it but there were some times when we had to work away from that area we couldn't have access to that water and we have to drink water from the creeks and some some some of this water it wasn't running water anymore it didn't taste the same why because was is Target water sat there he sat there for I don't know how long and it just tastes bad sometimes you see a little bit of I don't know how you call it that it has a little protection on top of the water you had to blow it out to separate that protection that water had and and drink I mean it was nasty water but I mean when you're thirst now I understand what David was talking about as the deer panted for the waters you know that's that's the kind of thirst we have to have for God because we understand that when when when we we lean to God he's going to be there to supply us every need in John 4 Jesus talking to the woman says if you know the gift of God and who it is that say to thee give me to drink you will ask for him and he will give you the living water and you know this woman as any any other human being is just thinking about carnal the first thing you say oh give me that water so I don't have to come here in the middle of the day with this heat I don't want to have to be exposed to the people that judging me all the time because the kind of life I have give me that water and other thing she said is says how you going to get it if if you don't have anything to draw the water out from Revelation that's right brother says what Jesus was doing there he was trying to get in touch with her spirit that's right and Isaiah 12:3 says therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation amen I I my point here brother and sister is that there is no business for us out there you have no business out there that's right many people can come to you and try especially to the the young people they can come and talk to them or you're wasting your youth there you're I mean you have no life it's quite the opposite all right when you stay close to God you have life how do I know that listen Jesus in Matthew told the disciples not to go to Samaria remember but in this passage the Bible says that he needed to go through Samaria and these people they had a mixed belief the way they believe was a mix between idols and God although the road through Samaria was the shortest rout from Jerusalem to Galilee Pious Jews often avoided they did so because there was a deep distrust and dislike between many of the Jewish people and the Samaritans brother and sister that Spirit hasn't died yet that's right how many even message Believers are so legalist right but we have to understand that Holiness is one thing and legalist is another thing a legalist can be very legalist and things he can live for but he's weak in another way yeah good and because he's weak in another way he will never touch those points that's right see what I'm saying but Holiness is from A to Z sometimes it hurts it hurts us to live a holy life but if it's that what it is is required let it come so when the Assyrians conquer the Northern Kingdom of Israel they exhile almost all the Jews population removing them from the land all they left behind were lowest class of society 136 years later Babylon conquered the southern Kingdom of Judah and followed similar policy this ones left behind intermated with other non-jewish people who slowly came into region and the Samaritans emerged as an ethnic and religious group because the Mars had a historical connection to the people of Israel their faith was a combination of commands and rituals from the law of Moses put together with various superstitions most of the Jews in Jesus time despise them diserens disliking them even more than Gentiles because they were religious speaking half breeds who had an ethnic monog faith that Sam martinus build own Temple to Jehovah and the mountain jerim but the Jews turn it around in 128 BC this obviously made relations between Jews and Samar even worse but remember that what the religious Jewish people they always were trying to find the sin in others and when Jesus came he sat down with adulterers lepers publicans and all the eyes of the the senat there the priests and and and Pharisees and SES they were in Jesus look what he's doing he was just trying if they were not there they sent spies because when he healed the the the Blind Men the Bible says that people went to the Pharisees and Sadducees to tell them right and they come to confront him things that they will never be able to do right because they were full of religion but they never understood that the Living Word was made flesh the word of God was made flesh and was walking among them now when the when the when the word of God comes to people's hearts that heart is changed that heart is has to be changed because that's a promise brother BR says you cannot be the same person when you have an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ there is no way I mean there that that doesn't means he's going to uh take you up here so you don't stumble no we're still going to have fights struggles in life but you know what because that seed that is in your heart that's right that Fountain of Living Water is still there in your heart you stumbl you get up Shake Yourself get up he charged his disciples not to enter into any city of the samans in Matthew 10:5 you know the other thing I and this is probably just me but when Jesus went to meet this woman like I say forgive me if I'm wrong but I believe that the reason he sent the the disciples ahead to the city to buy groceries because the disciples were not been born yet right they were not born again yet and they were judgmental that's right so Jesus couldn't have the Liberty to speak to the heart of that woman yeah surrounded by Jewish Jewish people his disciples were Jewish and they were excited about the things that Jesus was doing but seeing him talking to this woman I can say forgive me if I'm wrong but Jesus wanted to have a heart-to-heart conversation that's what he's looking for you today that's right he wants to have a heart-to- heart conversation with you otherwise everything is going to pass right so the moment when the when the disciples were coming by that time she already received and she drop the water thing on the floor and run away because she received the Revelation that some finally someone didn't judge her someone loved her and remember this other woman he he pardon he said go and see no more so that's that's that's what he wants from you he wants you not to continue the same kind of life and you know these groups that are raising up these days oh don't judge me because I'm dressed like this I'm dressed like that the other day someone came up and say I feel like I'm a robot so I identify myself as a robot and then they ask her say so when you get sick you go to a shop or you go to a doctor see they're messed up here they're messed up and they don't know what to do that's the reason we are called to return Amen to the word of God we have to return to the Fountain of Living Water in John 7:37 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood up cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that belied on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water thank you Lord so what are you doing here you are here to come fill up of this living water when that woman received that living water on her she wasn't the same she want and witness come and see this man that told me the kind of life I I live but he didn't condemn me he forgive me he loved me so it's hard for us to understand everybody's lives because we don't know what this their struggles are but you focus in your problem and they focus in their problems amen and when you when I say you focus on your problem is you bring your problem to Jesus Christ and he's the one who's going to give you the answer to your problem we see many people with struggles in life because because they just haven't surrendered their heart to God and even though we know we know the the the prescription we just don't go go out and and fill it up or sometimes we we got the the medicine and we refuse to take it why it's because people have a a happy life a temporary life but don't don't don't don't understand that at some point everything in this world will have an end so we have a very good life yes but it's a temporary life you know I been taking my kids to work these days and we're doing hanging doors and casing and baseboard and I say you guys do the the baseboard because my knees hurt and they're young they can go under their knees and get up and up and down up and down they're young but you know what that doesn't last forever I know for fact it doesn't last forever that's right so the same way you go out leave God you might have a good life but it's not going to last forever that's right at some point in life you're going to start missing the food and I'm not talking about your mom's food remember the prodigal son he remember he the Bible says he came into his sense so when you go out you leave God you're out of your mind simple as that people like the way they act because they're out of their mind amen because the Bible said it and this man being living far away he came into his hands what I'm doing here have you H have you lost conscience at least once I I did once I hit my head really hard and I just I the last thing I I remember was everything went black then when I came back I was like where am I when I came back to my sense that's right so this prodal son said what what I'm doing here eating from the pig's food when when I have everything there I never beg for good when I was in my house in my father's house and you know the the way the scripture the the way that we read the scripture most of the time we we focus and the bad things that this boy did and and we lost track of the religious brother that he had brother BR says there is no worse Spirit than a religious spirit so we have to pray hard so we don't get that cover of religion that's it we don't want to be that right you know I appreciate more a guy who comes and says I'm messed up I'm really messed up I know what I've been doing is wrong but I can't help it please pray for me I want to go back home amen than a religious person all popped up God help us Isaiah 58 verse 11 and the Lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and those shall be like water garden and like a spring of water whose Waters fail not amen so we have all the medicine here what are you doing over there wandering around God is you know I heard when God wanted to plant a a tree he talked to the Earth and he wanted to create a fish he talked to the water produce the water produce the Earth but when when when he was going to create the man he talked to himself that's right let us make so the Earth without tree still Earth the ocean with a fish still an ocean god without man he's still God but a man without God is nothing so you plunk out a tree from the earth he going to die you take a fish from the ocean it's going to die so what are we doing up there wandering around that's right experiencing new things that you're going to regret down the road no you have no business over there that's right that's right right think in James let me see if I can find the scripture here but he says come near to me and I will come near to you so he's waiting for you amen Amen to make the move because God has his Buffet it's ready for you right did did didn't the song says Jesus have the table set spread right he's waiting for his Saints to come and eat come and dine come and dine the master calling come and dine what are you waiting for what are you doing eating junk food out there when you have a balanced diet see what happen when we eat junk food but it's delicious right but we pay the price later that's right that's why Daniel didn't want to contaminate with this the food of the Kingdom he knew what was good for him now the question remains do you know what good what food is good for you so if we know I mean that it's hurting me too my wife keeps telling me just take the tortillas away it's hard I gotta be honest but you know what she's she's getting she's getting to a point where I've been eating without tortillas and I say I think I'm a different man but then I tried to ask Mar her and can I get some bread I don't know if that's even worse but you know God has the balance hood for us amen and he's he's the one who's going to watch or Diet so again we have no business out there brother and sister young people talking to you this morning when you talk to young people out there on the street he says oh I'm too young to to hear that you talk to an old people or talk to the young people I'm I'm done it's just just go talk to the young people so everybody's busy everybody has their own things they're on agenda but they don't have time for God Amen right just make sure we're not that kind of people that's right oh because I belong to the grace Tabernacle just I'm I'm I'm good I'm safe there no you're not Grace tacle didn't pay the price for your salvation that's right amen Grace Tabernacle is a good point of reunion so you can be fed I'm glad that God found me amen I'm glad that God showed me the way amen CU I did nothing special to to for him it's great is God's grace working in you and me that's right oh I would love to see my family see what I see but they can't amen I I would love to see my friends to to to to see and believe what I believe but they can't it's not up to me what I have to do is try to live a life Christlike yes and then God let God work with them because you you can you can get a shot of the last hour message and give it to someone right no I wish can be that way as much as I hate needles I will take one but it's not that way you have to go into the war room and just pray God and let God come and and speak to your heart amen you know when you become a traditional Christian you're not worried about getting this communion at home during the week I I preaching to myself here this morning but a traditional Christian don't get along with God during the week that's right they just waiting for the next Sunday to come and see it in church so we're we're not different than Catholics now man so Jesus told the disciples well when disciples came and say are you going to eat he says I already ate that's right and they said where what what did you eat well he has he had a special diet amen so we have to eat just take it to the physical to your physical body you quit eating see what happens the first sign some of us we turn bad mood oh amen well it doesn't do any good if you quit eating so just bring it to the spiritual you quit eating spiritual food I mean I I don't even want to go there but I'm closing with this Revelations 216 and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I'll give to him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely amen he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son so what do you need what is your need today right he's there to supply every need we need all all we need to do is come to him all you need to do is go to him he's there waiting for you he was there waiting for that woman you know when he was getting I believe was getting to Jerusalem he was walking in multitude of people putting pressure on him and and rubbing his shoulders against him and and there was one touch that woman you know that this woman in his in her situation she was despised by the Jews right rejected that's right cuz just a woman and in her period for the Jews you have to stay away from her so having this issue for so many years for her poor soul so she she felt so impure and unworthy to come before the master and she said if I just touch cuz I'm not worthy to perceive send myself in front of him if I just touch the edge of the Carmen that's right because all her life was she was being rejected by the Jews religious Jews and I believe she heard about this man the things he was doing isn't that Faith come by hearing and hearing the word of God well she heard news and praise God for that because back then there was no WhatsApp no Instagram no nothing like that so she had to hear from mouth that's right to ear isn't that amazing is not amazing when when you are in the deepest whole just just think a little bit about her situation how uncomfortable for her and not only being uncomfortable to herself but the rejection of all the people because I believe not only the man was treating it her bad but the woman too I mean there's all kinds of people three kinds of Believers brother br says but there was with this man and he and she thinking herself oh he's going to judge me so if I just touch the edge of the Garment what a difference so if you come to Jesus Christ your will never be rejected that's right you're not going to be judged he's going to come you're going to come to him he's going to wait for you with open arms welcome home my son amen welcome home my daughter that's the God I serve amen and does the god that is waiting for you that's right still amen please stand let's let us pray
