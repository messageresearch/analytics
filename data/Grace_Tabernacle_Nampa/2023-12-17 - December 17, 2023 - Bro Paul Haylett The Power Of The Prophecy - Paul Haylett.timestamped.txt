[38:09] he said you know uh that it it was just
[38:12] real stressful for him being there he
[38:14] hadn't slept um he said he you know just
[38:18] had a lot of things that were kind of
[38:20] Weighing on him things he felt like as a
[38:23] pastor he needed to be out and take care
[38:25] of uh um but the
[38:29] brothers um becoming maybe a little more
[38:33] bold you know brother Ron you've got to
[38:36] get your health back you've got to get
[38:38] up in strength and uh so um the Lord
[38:44] blessed our
[38:45] time um when brother Ron uh called asked
[38:50] me to take the last Sunday service there
[38:53] um uh he he sounded very very rough and
[38:57] so we certainly want to see that and got
[39:00] to the church and you know find out that
[39:03] most of the ministers in the church were
[39:05] sick also so amen I kind of joked with
[39:08] the church there that I I was just a
[39:10] substitute The Last Resort but it was
[39:13] good to be there and uh you know
[39:16] speaking of things we need to remember
[39:19] uh and and happy to announce um I uh set
[39:23] just a moment with sister Rebecca page
[39:25] brother Ron's daughter and uh talked to
[39:28] her right at the very end of the service
[39:31] on Sunday and uh she was very very happy
[39:35] to declare one that God loved her woed
[39:40] her right back into the fold praise the
[39:42] Lord and she's cancer
[39:46] [Applause]
[39:52] free yeah absolutely you know a
[39:55] treatment at one time time they're
[39:56] saying you know uh we just don't know if
[39:59] this is even going to affect it we don't
[40:01] know what we can do for you you need to
[40:04] kind of maybe settle things and get it
[40:06] right and you know we would like
[40:09] sometimes to say well the doctors just
[40:12] don't know but let me apply just a
[40:15] little different application maybe
[40:17] sometimes we need to hear those
[40:22] words because of cause and effect right
[40:26] right
[40:28] so God speaks through doctors he speaks
[40:31] through all these things and sometimes
[40:34] we like to think oh that's just a
[40:35] negative thing but sometimes maybe God
[40:38] is just giving us a little inspiration
[40:41] to deal with things and uh so certainly
[40:47] we just um vary something very much upon
[40:51] my heart having just come home from
[40:54] Phoenix um
[40:59] let us be faithful to pray for our
[41:00] unsaved children that's right
[41:04] abely
[41:06] um you know the old phrase we just love
[41:09] them to
[41:10] death but what we want to do is love
[41:12] them to
[41:14] life and we want to amen we want to make
[41:18] a difference you know lovely time that
[41:21] sister Jerry and I had in
[41:23] Arizona and uh you know sometimes you
[41:26] just kind of think oh my oh my but
[41:29] there's an inspiration comes with this
[41:31] that's you can make a difference amen
[41:35] miles mean nothing continents mean
[41:37] nothing we can make a difference amen
[41:41] amen Prayer Changes Things
[41:45] Hallelujah
[41:46] um just want to give you a little update
[41:49] on some missions thing that the things
[41:51] that the church is
[41:53] supporting we have been supporting
[41:56] recently some work in northern
[41:58] Europe um uh a new body of Believers
[42:03] rising up uh work there sometimes people
[42:08] think well is there really anything
[42:10] changing are we just I heard a brother
[42:12] one time say well it seems like we're
[42:15] just
[42:16] recirculating
[42:17] believers they move from here to there
[42:20] that that there rejoices there's new new
[42:24] Believers in the church and where went
[42:26] from uh would be saying oh we wish they
[42:29] hadn't left but you know God's still
[42:31] working and and right there in northern
[42:34] Europe um in the country of
[42:37] Lithuania uh the word of God coming into
[42:40] the hands of a
[42:42] pastor and um he believed the message he
[42:46] shares it with his church and the church
[42:48] says that's the truth they see baptism
[42:51] they see what God's doing and and they
[42:53] rise up and and um uh you know just just
[42:57] very incredible to see how these things
[43:00] come to pass a whole a whole group some
[43:02] leave amen we pray for them but you know
[43:07] to see a whole group because you see
[43:09] this is the end time amen and
[43:13] um so there in northern Europe we see
[43:16] little work that we're supporting there
[43:19] uh uh brother brother behind that I
[43:22] don't guess it'd be out of line to to
[43:24] speak out uh brother valali was here
[43:27] with us this last summer brother Vitali
[43:29] is very instrumental and uh some of that
[43:33] work there in the country of Lithuania
[43:36] and remember them weren't they weren't
[43:38] they wonderful people to be with they
[43:40] were just incredible and um we have been
[43:44] supporting to a fairly large
[43:47] amount uh uh recently within the last
[43:51] couple weeks to
[43:53] Venezuela uh inflation in Venezuela has
[43:56] reduced everything to the very very bare
[44:01] necessity uh you know Saints if it could
[44:05] put it in a context how would you feel
[44:07] if you went in a grocery store and there
[44:08] wasn't a single tube of
[44:10] toothpaste but if there was a tube of
[44:13] toothpaste it would cost you 2530
[44:17] $35 and so this is what's happening to
[44:20] to Christians in
[44:22] Venezuela uh that old communist spirit
[44:25] is just is Desiring to crush the church
[44:28] but just as it was in the Dark Ages
[44:30] everything that Satan can throw at uh uh
[44:34] Christians at real Believers my brother
[44:36] and sister they might drive the message
[44:39] underground they can't kill it no amen
[44:42] so it's there that we see that and we've
[44:46] just also recently supported some work
[44:49] uh through our brother David Nash in
[44:52] Honduras and um none of these are are so
[44:56] significant that we could boast but we
[44:59] want to make a difference amen and um by
[45:01] God's grace we will make a difference
[45:03] and so I want to also say thank you to
[45:06] the brothers on their landscape project
[45:09] I don't know if you noticed or not but
[45:11] it looks much nicer if you didn't notice
[45:13] on your way in um I have a very good eye
[45:17] doctor uh but um it it's it's coming
[45:21] along things looking much better now
[45:24] concerning Christmas
[45:26] uh Christmas Eve we will be having
[45:28] Sunday morning service just like always
[45:30] on Christmas Eve uh New
[45:33] Year's uh Eve will have morning
[45:37] service and uh in the evening time
[45:40] somewhere around 6 o' if you want to
[45:42] come here at the church around 6 o'clock
[45:46] we don't want to get all carried away
[45:48] but around 6 o'clock we can have some
[45:50] fellowship time and then 7:15 7:30ish we
[45:55] want want to go into songs and worship
[45:58] and uh following that at a reasonable
[46:01] time in the evening uh uh we will have
[46:05] communion now I I don't know pastors
[46:08] should never be selfish but I'm getting
[46:10] on a plane the next morning and spending
[46:13] I don't know 12 hours or something
[46:16] flying so I won't be here at midnight if
[46:19] you plan on being here at midnight but
[46:22] um at what point we'll have communion at
[46:24] a reasonable time in the evening and uh
[46:27] after that we will uh dismiss and allow
[46:30] you to to uh spend the rest of the
[46:32] evening as you would so wish amen does
[46:35] that sound good Saints amen so anyway I
[46:40] believe we've covered all of those
[46:42] things um and um so let's just rise and
[46:47] we'll just go into the word tonight uh
[46:51] today it feels like night I got up so
[46:53] early this morning I I thought we're
[46:56] still operating at night but um anyway
[46:59] it's good sometimes you know you know
[47:02] the the world acknowledges you know of
[47:05] what happens in the night but let's not
[47:08] forget the Holy Spirit also moves at
[47:11] night oh yeah so you don't have to be
[47:13] standing in the light of day to have the
[47:14] Holy Spirit speak to you amen so meet
[47:17] him amen Saints meet him where he
[47:20] chooses to meet you amen be open amen
[47:24] amen God bless you brother
[47:27] William and
[47:29] uh so Revelations
[47:33] 10 starting with verse
[47:36] 7 going through
[47:39] 11 amen there's something else is still
[47:42] nagging on the back of my mind I know I
[47:44] wanted to share but I have
[47:46] forgotten so
[47:52] um if I remember I'll bring it up re
[47:55] Revelations
[47:57] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[48:00] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[48:02] sound the mystery of God should be
[48:05] finished as he hath declared to his
[48:08] servants the prophets and the voice
[48:12] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[48:14] again and said go take the little book
[48:18] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[48:21] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[48:23] Earth and we know who that Angel is amen
[48:27] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[48:29] him give me the little book and he said
[48:32] unto me take it eat it up and it shall
[48:36] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[48:40] thy mouth sweet as honey amen and I took
[48:43] the little book out of the Angel's hand
[48:46] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[48:49] sweet as honey and as soon as I had
[48:52] eaten it my belly was bitter and he said
[48:55] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[48:58] before many peoples and Nations and
[49:00] tongues and Kings Heavenly Father we
[49:04] thank you for your word today we thank
[49:05] you for everyone that is here father
[49:09] Lord that we just desire for you to
[49:10] speak to our hearts Lord by your
[49:14] strength father We Exist Lord by Your
[49:17] Word father we are able to live and Lord
[49:21] we want to live in the full Vitality of
[49:24] the life Lord that you have promised to
[49:26] the believer Lord we ask you just to
[49:29] speak through these words today may we
[49:32] be able to take them home anchored in
[49:34] our hearts to know father that your
[49:37] grace is sufficient and your word is
[49:40] fulfilled amen Lord we thank you bless
[49:43] this time in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:45] amen amen you may be
[49:54] seated
[50:02] amen so as we'll look here
[50:05] today
[50:07] amen uh just a little reminder for those
[50:10] maybe you can just um just a little pat
[50:14] on the back or a present or well-wishing
[50:17] or whatever sister
[50:19] Gabriella is coming of
[50:23] age and we'll just wait another a year
[50:25] or two and ask her how that's working
[50:27] out you know so we're speaking to young
[50:30] adults you see there's something you
[50:32] know when you're a little kid it's like
[50:34] Dad I want to go with you I want to go
[50:35] work I want to help you at 14 they're
[50:38] like what are you doing at 18 I'm
[50:42] busy and U that's the metamorphosis of
[50:45] life right and so we thank the Lord for
[50:48] that amen
[50:51] Revelations it says in verse 7 mystery
[50:54] of God should be finished now my brother
[50:57] and sister this word should is not used
[51:00] in the context that we typically would
[51:02] use it you know I should which means
[51:04] that there is some kind of motivation
[51:07] there of what should be taken care of
[51:09] but I should do this or I should do that
[51:12] but my brother and sister in this
[51:13] context this word should is in essence
[51:17] saying will be that's it it is done it
[51:20] is finished amen so it says that the
[51:22] mystery of God will be finished and uh
[51:26] so I I say that we should have
[51:28] confidence right because the word cannot
[51:30] fail and if we can't have confidence in
[51:33] the word then we are going to be in a
[51:36] very world of hurt because every promise
[51:38] in the book we don't know whether it'll
[51:40] come to pass or not amen I stand here
[51:42] before you today and there's many in our
[51:44] midst today that have afflictions in
[51:46] your flesh that you would like to be
[51:48] healed from can we say amen and it's
[51:51] there in that that we would say well
[51:53] using the word should like we we often
[51:55] use it um you know the word says I would
[51:58] be healed or I I should be healed or
[52:01] there's a possibility of me being healed
[52:03] and the devil will get into the comment
[52:05] section in your mind and pretty soon
[52:08] you'll be saying well it must not be
[52:09] God's will for me to be healed because
[52:12] I've been praying and I'm still sick or
[52:14] I still have this Affliction but I want
[52:16] you to understand he said by his stripes
[52:19] ye are healed it is a finished statement
[52:22] it's not something to do now my brother
[52:24] and sister what God chooses or allows or
[52:28] brings about in our life my brother and
[52:30] sister that's not for us to measure
[52:32] otherwise we'll start to question every
[52:35] single thing in our life and say well I
[52:38] thought God said and then we will come
[52:41] to a place that we'll go and become
[52:43] agnostics and then from there we'll
[52:45] become atheists and we've seen this
[52:47] happen over and over again we're not
[52:49] just speaking in some kind of uh almost
[52:52] threatening manner like this is what
[52:54] will happen but we're seeing a pattern
[52:56] amen so just trust the word trust God
[52:59] Amen and so it says here that uh he
[53:03] would be now this mystery my brother and
[53:05] sister we can go I preached a little bit
[53:08] of this last THS uh last Sunday I mean
[53:11] in in Phoenix but I preached that
[53:13] because it was on my heart here and and
[53:15] it just come to pass in that sense to
[53:17] express some of that there you see we
[53:19] could take mystery and make it kind of a
[53:22] ooh kind of thing you know like oh um
[53:26] mystery but my brother and sister you
[53:29] see what this is is God is telling us
[53:32] something that was hid from us is being
[53:34] revealed or not going to be revealed but
[53:37] it is revealed but yet we don't see it
[53:40] all that's right are you with me this
[53:42] morning so we could sit here and say the
[53:44] very mystery of God has been revealed to
[53:46] us but I could not stand here today and
[53:49] say I see it all it is still unfolding
[53:53] but as the word said it's been revealed
[53:56] the work has been finished I'm here to
[53:58] say amen amen just like I believe
[54:01] without a Shadow of Doubt my brother and
[54:03] sister the prophet of God said that
[54:05] rapturing faith is already in you I'm
[54:08] here to say it's already in me amen God
[54:11] is bringing this rapturing Faith to the
[54:14] surface now you know some people would
[54:17] say but I'm struggling on that well I'll
[54:19] tell you my brother and sister just as
[54:21] the grass that grew in the crack of the
[54:24] sidewalk had to struggle
[54:25] so will you as Sons and Daughters of God
[54:28] in your Christian experience have times
[54:31] of struggle they'll have times the devil
[54:33] will try to tell you what you believe is
[54:36] not the word that it's not right or you
[54:38] didn't understand it correctly what we
[54:41] want to do is sit back and say he said
[54:44] it and I believe it and it's coming to
[54:46] pass amen I'm pressing to the sun amen
[54:50] so it is uh for a mystery to really be
[54:54] finished my brother and sister you and I
[54:56] must recognize who it is that spoke it
[55:00] that's it cuz we can say the Mysteries
[55:02] revealed but if we have a question of
[55:05] how it was spoken to who it was spoken
[55:08] then you will sit here and over time
[55:11] you'll put it on a shelf which is not a
[55:13] bad idea but if you forget it's on the
[55:15] Shelf my brother and sister that is a
[55:17] bad idea other words we can put the
[55:20] things completely out of our life and
[55:23] then never look at it again and always
[55:25] wonder why did it not come to pass well
[55:28] it is there that we we understand that
[55:31] you must be a participant right at the
[55:34] Finish that's right as brother George
[55:37] says you run your race I'll run my race
[55:39] I'll meet you at the finish line but let
[55:41] me put it this way as a pastor to you I
[55:44] want to run this race with you that's
[55:46] right I don't want to be completely off
[55:48] on my own running a race I want to run
[55:50] this race with you as a body of
[55:53] Believers I believe God has put us
[55:54] together together and I want to run the
[55:56] race with you and sometimes in the race
[55:59] no doubt you saw the little video before
[56:02] I don't know a marathon or something and
[56:04] the man comes down he's hurting there's
[56:06] a little curve at the Finish Line he
[56:09] gets confused and he standing there
[56:11] dazed he's not here to the back of the
[56:13] church from the finish line and here
[56:15] comes the next contestant that is
[56:17] running in this race and he rounds the
[56:19] corner he understands where the finish
[56:21] line is could easily have passed that
[56:23] man and went on to receive the accolades
[56:26] of winning the race but the world was in
[56:28] awe that he stopped and started
[56:31] escorting this man hobbling to the
[56:33] Finish Line This is a true story hobble
[56:36] to the finish line and when he gets that
[56:38] one step from the Finish Line he stops
[56:41] and the man is so dehydrated he's
[56:43] confused and it's there that he realizes
[56:45] he still doesn't understand he pushes
[56:47] him across the Finish Line that's what I
[56:50] want us to be that's what I want us as
[56:53] Christians to be that's it not to run
[56:56] off and say well they have to make it on
[56:58] their own but to have enough grace and
[57:00] mercy that Jesus displayed in us to come
[57:04] and say my brother my sister we're at
[57:07] the Finish Line keep pressing on keep
[57:10] walking keep
[57:12] claiming amen and it will come to
[57:15] pass that's right they L later asked
[57:19] that man I have to share this part it
[57:20] always amazed me they said that's racing
[57:23] if a man's not able to finish the race
[57:26] that that's fine to pass him no shame in
[57:29] that and he said but I want you to know
[57:32] they said why didn't you and he said I
[57:33] want you to know my mother was watching
[57:36] this
[57:37] race and she would have been ashamed of
[57:41] me isin't that
[57:43] compelling
[57:45] oh let us live up to a Godly mother's
[57:49] expectation amen
[57:52] hallelujah so there's always two classes
[57:56] right we see it all through scripture
[57:57] two Vines two Spirits it's it's all
[58:00] through scripture you can see it can and
[58:02] able bring it right on down we won't
[58:04] spend a lot of time on that but just
[58:06] bring it right on down my brother and
[58:08] sister and the word says that in our day
[58:11] amen that the wheat and the tears would
[58:13] be separated and some people my brother
[58:16] and sister this is just a little farming
[58:18] fact we have to be careful how we
[58:20] interpret that because you see it's not
[58:23] always that the the I had a brother just
[58:25] mentioned this to me recently he said
[58:27] well now brother the wheat and the tears
[58:29] how are we going to separate those or
[58:31] how's that going to happen but I want
[58:33] you to understand that the Shu that
[58:34] surrounds the wheat is also considered
[58:37] tear exactly right so there's going to
[58:40] come a separation time it doesn't mean
[58:42] there's a weed growing in the midst it
[58:44] doesn't mean that there's all kinds of
[58:46] Thistle and kosa and L quarter and all
[58:49] these things to be separated out it
[58:51] could be us being simply separated from
[58:54] our
[58:57] self coming to A A Place in our life
[59:01] that self no longer controls our destiny
[59:04] that self no longer regulates our fa
[59:07] faith that self no longer is our
[59:09] limiting factor but we can come to a
[59:12] place that God pulling the very life
[59:14] that's
[59:15] right that's for the life at a season
[59:20] was in the shock that's right was in
[59:22] that that we might call Terror today
[59:28] amen always two classes there's always
[59:30] been two Natures yes sir there's always
[59:33] been two results that's
[59:35] right
[59:38] absolutely as we look here I've been
[59:41] studying a little influence of this come
[59:44] uh as I said in our time in Arizona in a
[59:47] revelation book of
[59:49] symbols it said and the world is
[59:52] groaning waiting today and I want to ask
[59:54] you just I think we're all reasonable uh
[59:57] uh knowledgeable people here today is
[59:59] this world groaning or what yes it's
[1:00:02] happening again my brother and sister
[1:00:03] not one place on Earth that's not
[1:00:06] groaning that's
[1:00:09] right our sister April went over into
[1:00:13] the I don't know what would you call it
[1:00:15] southeast Asia and that's all the
[1:00:17] further we'll go in detail she went over
[1:00:19] there and dealing with people that have
[1:00:22] been dealt harshly with people that
[1:00:25] diseases we wouldn't think twice about
[1:00:28] kills them people with infections become
[1:00:32] so inflamed and so whatever that
[1:00:34] ultimately it takes their lives and and
[1:00:37] we see that and and there's trouble
[1:00:39] there the scripture says that there'd be
[1:00:41] war on every hand and we'd hear of wars
[1:00:44] and rumors of wars and then we see these
[1:00:46] things taking place and we'll find my
[1:00:49] brother and sister that we we've got the
[1:00:51] issue of Russia and Ukraine but it's not
[1:00:54] just just an issue of Russia and Ukraine
[1:00:56] my brother and sister that issue has
[1:00:58] penetrated the world that's right and
[1:01:00] it's not just an issue of Palestinians
[1:01:04] and Israelis it's not an issue just of
[1:01:07] gaua my brother and sister this is
[1:01:10] scripture being
[1:01:11] fulfilled this is not just issues my
[1:01:14] brother and sister that we can say it's
[1:01:15] that man's fault or it's that man's
[1:01:17] fault that country's fault or that
[1:01:19] country's fault but we're talking about
[1:01:21] spiritual warfare principalities and
[1:01:24] powers of Darkness pressing in and if
[1:01:27] you think all of that is chaos you just
[1:01:29] look at what Satan is doing in the world
[1:01:32] today and I'm not going to speak
[1:01:34] negative today but I will say this we
[1:01:36] are seeing church after church
[1:01:39] compromise their belief on the word of
[1:01:42] God and then you see very directly
[1:01:45] following that the consequence of the
[1:01:52] compromise if it was just simply Army
[1:01:55] against
[1:01:56] Army we could solve those things but
[1:02:00] spiritual warfare is what pushes this
[1:02:03] right and prophecy said it would come to
[1:02:05] pass you can fight against it but you
[1:02:07] won't change the prophecy that's right
[1:02:10] he said the world is groaning waiting
[1:02:12] today people don't know the mystery of
[1:02:15] God that's
[1:02:17] right they've not been taught the
[1:02:19] mystery of God the only thing they've
[1:02:21] been taught join Church put your name on
[1:02:24] a book be a good fellow treat your
[1:02:26] neighbor right that's all right but you
[1:02:29] must know the mystery of God hallelujah
[1:02:34] must know the mystery of
[1:02:36] God no man can reveal it to you but the
[1:02:39] one that had the book amen the one that
[1:02:43] come and offered up the book is the only
[1:02:46] one that can make this mystery of the
[1:02:49] word of God real to you we can join a
[1:02:53] church we can go to classes we can go to
[1:02:55] all kinds of things I get all kinds of
[1:02:57] little postcards and little texts and
[1:02:59] whatever come to our Revelation series
[1:03:02] or come to our deal of this come to that
[1:03:04] we'll explain to you what God is doing
[1:03:07] well I'm here to tell you God already
[1:03:10] explained it amen we don't have to find
[1:03:13] a man that's got the idea God himself
[1:03:16] come down amen amen that's right the
[1:03:20] Bible said no man can call Jesus the
[1:03:22] Christ only by the Holy Ghost you know
[1:03:26] that's a hard one for some people to
[1:03:28] digest because they believe that they've
[1:03:30] been faithful they've been faithful to
[1:03:33] do good
[1:03:34] deeds you know I don't want to sound
[1:03:36] like I'm boasting but you know I I felt
[1:03:39] like calling brother Adrien here a few
[1:03:41] days ago where in a a parking lot of a
[1:03:43] store turned out a little Romanian lady
[1:03:47] and I I believe that it was sincere I
[1:03:49] believe she told us the truth I didn't I
[1:03:52] didn't really feel not like I'm some
[1:03:53] kind of guy Iger counter to judge this
[1:03:55] but she was sincere she said I said
[1:03:58] we'll go in the store I'll buy you
[1:03:59] groceries she's like sir in her broken
[1:04:02] English she said sir I have food but
[1:04:05] food won't matter if they kick me out of
[1:04:07] my
[1:04:11] house you don't drink never you don't
[1:04:15] smoke no and I just grilled her I I
[1:04:18] probably I kind of felt like I was being
[1:04:20] a little hard on this little
[1:04:23] lady and I tell you it humbled me so
[1:04:25] much and this is why I'm sharing it I
[1:04:28] finally felt
[1:04:30] like not often I have money like this in
[1:04:33] my wallet but I had a 20 I had a 50 and
[1:04:35] I had a $100 bill I first off I was
[1:04:37] going to hand her a 20 and I was like
[1:04:39] yeah 20 will go a long
[1:04:42] ways my goodness a loaf of bread and
[1:04:44] some peanut butter and you've spent
[1:04:47] $20 and I thought well 50 might make a
[1:04:49] difference and something spoke to
[1:04:53] me and we can let emotion and these kind
[1:04:56] of things rule us but something spoke to
[1:04:58] me and said if this is my
[1:05:04] child and I just pulled a $100 bill out
[1:05:07] and I gave it to her and the results my
[1:05:09] brother and sisters what I want to share
[1:05:10] to you she starts crying she's so
[1:05:14] thankful she grabs my hand pulls it to
[1:05:16] her face and starts kissing my
[1:05:18] hand and I'm kind of like
[1:05:21] uh uh I'll tell you this my wife's never
[1:05:24] even done
[1:05:30] that and her little
[1:05:33] boy the same thing one to hug me one to
[1:05:36] shake fist bump then a h then handshake
[1:05:39] and then he just grabs me and hugs me
[1:05:41] and as I go to put my arms around him he
[1:05:44] grabs my hand and starts kissing at and
[1:05:46] he's saying thank you thank you God
[1:05:47] bless you God bless you God bless you
[1:05:50] now what they do with the money my
[1:05:51] brother and sister is between them and
[1:05:53] God but I tell you what I want to be
[1:05:55] faithful to do my part that's it amen
[1:05:58] and after we left a little later I
[1:05:59] thought you know I had a little more
[1:06:00] money in my wallet maybe I should have
[1:06:02] gave it to her I don't know but I want
[1:06:04] to make a difference I want to be a
[1:06:06] light that shines I don't want to be the
[1:06:08] the skeptic that's always if she lied to
[1:06:10] me that's between her and
[1:06:13] God that's right that's
[1:06:16] exactly but you know we could just defy
[1:06:18] not helping anyone even people in our
[1:06:20] own church yeah that's right yes
[1:06:26] no man can reveal it to you but the one
[1:06:28] that had the book no man can call Jesus
[1:06:30] the Christ only by the Holy Ghost I tell
[1:06:33] you today my brother and sister I
[1:06:35] believe we stand here in a position of
[1:06:37] confidence but I want to tell you today
[1:06:39] I want to be able to call him the Christ
[1:06:42] I want to be able to declare who he is
[1:06:44] and not have a question mark of when
[1:06:46] where why
[1:06:48] how that means our positions got to be
[1:06:51] correct before we can judge their
[1:06:53] position that's right
[1:06:54] before we can act on anything we must be
[1:06:56] in the right place
[1:06:58] ourself exactly
[1:07:03] right this grand old Holy Ghost Church
[1:07:06] is going to come out one of these days
[1:07:10] and shine like you've never seen amen
[1:07:13] you know what I
[1:07:16] believe I believe all you got
[1:07:20] problems I believe your problems hinder
[1:07:23] you absolutely because we're looking at
[1:07:26] our problem that's it that's exactly
[1:07:28] right why don't we look at who God said
[1:07:30] we were amen and why don't we come out
[1:07:34] with confidence and shine like we have
[1:07:35] never shown before why don't we stand up
[1:07:38] and say Lord let me be a light in the
[1:07:40] darkness like I've never been a light in
[1:07:43] my life I want to be a light today lordu
[1:07:47] I don't want to look back some glorious
[1:07:49] time years or whatever ago I want it to
[1:07:52] shine today amen
[1:07:54] amen now I want to move forward here in
[1:07:57] this you know in Revelations 10:7 and on
[1:08:00] through the scripture there that
[1:08:02] utterance my brother and sister if you
[1:08:03] look at that very closely Amen brother
[1:08:06] Gideon take us back to the scripture
[1:08:08] please and you look at this this utter
[1:08:10] utterance my brother and sister is
[1:08:13] not actually a
[1:08:19] request he didn't say do this if you
[1:08:22] feel like it the voice I heard from
[1:08:25] Heaven spake unto me again and
[1:08:28] said go yeah amen but he didn't just
[1:08:33] point us off into wherever I'm wandering
[1:08:35] around I'm just doing what God said I'm
[1:08:37] going I'm going I'm going no he said go
[1:08:41] and then he gives direction to us can we
[1:08:43] say today God's word always gives
[1:08:46] Direction it never just sends us out on
[1:08:49] a loose errand to run here and run there
[1:08:51] running to and fro but he always always
[1:08:54] gives us Direction but if we never obey
[1:08:56] the Commandment in the beginning my
[1:08:58] brother and sister it won't matter what
[1:09:00] direction he tells you to go we got to
[1:09:02] listen to him he said go and take the
[1:09:06] little
[1:09:08] book that I'll open when I give it to
[1:09:11] you it's
[1:09:14] already open amen amen amen amen it
[1:09:19] astounds me that within the confines of
[1:09:21] the message people will argue whether
[1:09:23] the book is open or
[1:09:24] not they will argue my brother and
[1:09:27] sister if it's open it means this and
[1:09:29] this and this and this I'm telling you
[1:09:32] the word said the book is open I believe
[1:09:36] the word the book is open
[1:09:39] amen that's
[1:09:41] right and it wasn't just anybody that
[1:09:44] brought
[1:09:44] it it was open in the hand of the Angel
[1:09:48] amen which standeth upon the sea and
[1:09:52] upon the Earth
[1:09:54] that's right nothing less than our Lord
[1:09:56] Jesus Christ amen he's the one that
[1:09:59] delivered the book that's right people
[1:10:02] will argue oh I heard this just the
[1:10:04] other day well so and so preached this
[1:10:07] in in the year
[1:10:09] 1888 or whatever in such and such church
[1:10:12] that's nothing new it doesn't change the
[1:10:15] fact of who delivered the book amen
[1:10:18] they're looking for an excuse to not
[1:10:20] have to act upon the book to put the
[1:10:22] book on the sh
[1:10:24] to be able to say that didn't apply to
[1:10:25] me it's not finished it's not done it's
[1:10:28] not that season but my brother and
[1:10:31] sister it wasn't Wigglesworth and it
[1:10:33] wasn't brandom that's right if you
[1:10:35] pardon me for putting it that blunt amen
[1:10:38] it was God himself he's the one that
[1:10:41] offered the open book and let me go back
[1:10:43] and correct that brother brandom I don't
[1:10:46] want to sound
[1:10:48] disrespectful Smith
[1:10:51] Wigglesworth amen don't want to be
[1:10:53] disrespectful I didn't mean it that way
[1:10:56] but you look at this my brother and
[1:10:57] sister regardless of what these men
[1:10:59] preach it's God Amen it's not us amen
[1:11:04] any man that would stand up and say this
[1:11:06] is my Revelation
[1:11:12] run now look at this how it is it's a
[1:11:16] command but this command will only
[1:11:19] be uh
[1:11:22] uh
[1:11:24] heed by a special class of people that's
[1:11:26] right I mean I'll just put it real
[1:11:28] simple that's right amen absolutely
[1:11:31] right and if you don't think so I won't
[1:11:32] name the denomination but I'll tell you
[1:11:34] right now watched a video the other day
[1:11:36] of a minister very well recognized
[1:11:38] minister in a denomination actually
[1:11:40] sitting there in his nice finally ornate
[1:11:43] office and talking about there certain
[1:11:45] passages of scripture he's not sure he
[1:11:48] can
[1:11:50] accept this is where it's heading
[1:11:55] and it's hard to go against the
[1:11:57] stream but I'm going to go against the
[1:12:01] stream amen God said it I believe it
[1:12:05] that's amen hallelujah so
[1:12:09] improbable amen I'll tell you my brother
[1:12:11] and sister if there's a need for water
[1:12:13] to run uphill God will provide that
[1:12:16] absolutely you would say it's
[1:12:17] scientifically impossible I don't care
[1:12:19] what science says if God said it was
[1:12:21] going to happen it it happen amen
[1:12:24] amen oh I could there's so many examples
[1:12:26] I could get lost in them amen so he says
[1:12:30] you know uh uh I say you know it's got
[1:12:33] to be a special class of people actually
[1:12:35] that's not my words but go and take the
[1:12:38] book
[1:12:40] okay I'm going to get up out of the
[1:12:42] chair or whatever it is and I'm going to
[1:12:44] go and I got tired before I got to the
[1:12:47] book I got distracted before I got to
[1:12:49] the book but I really want to accept or
[1:12:51] have everything that's in the book I I
[1:12:53] want to claim everything that's in the
[1:12:54] book my brother and sister no that won't
[1:12:56] work he said go so you can start the
[1:12:59] journey but you better get your hands on
[1:13:00] the book amen but if you get your hands
[1:13:04] on the book it will not be by man's
[1:13:07] interpretation of what the book says it
[1:13:09] has to be of God Amen so my point being
[1:13:14] first to worry about the
[1:13:16] Revelation you've got to have the book
[1:13:19] the book that's
[1:13:22] right amen
[1:13:25] amen I've been doing quite a bit of what
[1:13:28] you might consider to be strange
[1:13:34] studying the prophetess Luella
[1:13:39] says that God come to her the other
[1:13:41] night and revealed the end time to
[1:13:46] her this sound
[1:13:52] harsh the 's
[1:13:56] Revelation won't even fit inside the fly
[1:13:59] leaf that's right of this scripture
[1:14:04] that's she has a few hundred,
[1:14:09] followers does that make it truth no
[1:14:12] absolutely because it's
[1:14:15] popular because it seems to
[1:14:18] fit no cuz I tell you what happens my
[1:14:21] brother and sister when you get the book
[1:14:23] now the prophet of God says you can't
[1:14:25] interpret this
[1:14:27] book no human can interpret this
[1:14:31] book Only God Can interpret this
[1:14:34] book so you got to take the book you got
[1:14:38] to get it in
[1:14:42] possession
[1:14:44] possession is not
[1:14:46] merely to put it on a shelf
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:57] or even in your physical hand that's
[1:15:00] right absolutely
[1:15:04] right
[1:15:06] possession is ownership that's it
[1:15:10] amen absolutely now I'm going to take
[1:15:13] this I hope you follow
[1:15:14] me can I say I own this book yes sir
[1:15:18] yeah I believe I can but to take it with
[1:15:22] the prophet of God
[1:15:24] said if you don't mind not cter
[1:15:27] addicting you or
[1:15:29] I I can have ownership of this book but
[1:15:32] the prophet of God says you don't have
[1:15:34] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has
[1:15:38] you so this book I don't possess this
[1:15:42] book this book possesses
[1:15:45] me
[1:15:46] hallelujah amen now I'm going to just
[1:15:49] throw something at you I hope that I'm
[1:15:50] not too distractive on this but when I
[1:15:52] was in in Arizona I have to say that I
[1:15:54] felt like it was of the Lord and my eyes
[1:15:57] were just open to something and I'll
[1:15:59] just very briefly share it to you we've
[1:16:01] talked about reading between the lines
[1:16:03] many times right and the prophet of God
[1:16:04] even talks about that reading between
[1:16:06] the lines that you can see what others
[1:16:09] won't see because God opens that up but
[1:16:11] God opened my eyes to this I don't make
[1:16:13] no big deal out of it but I just believe
[1:16:15] it is true and we've always had this
[1:16:17] idea that we took the word of God now if
[1:16:20] I can just Express this as there being
[1:16:22] offence that we are passing through now
[1:16:25] we have the idea that we opened up the
[1:16:28] word and looked beyond the other side of
[1:16:31] the word and read between the lines to
[1:16:34] see what that was that would be you and
[1:16:36] I doing something but the truth of it is
[1:16:40] is the word opened up and reached out
[1:16:43] and Drug you and I into the word and
[1:16:46] said look at it from my point of view
[1:16:50] don't look at it from your point of view
[1:16:52] look at it it from my point of view and
[1:16:55] we'll stand here in the best of our
[1:16:57] English to describe it and say praise
[1:17:00] God I was reading between the lines well
[1:17:02] let's get that right you're reading
[1:17:04] between the lines cuz God opened it up
[1:17:07] and God pulled you into the word and you
[1:17:09] are reading it with new understanding
[1:17:12] with new revelation nothing we have done
[1:17:17] but all that he has done and people say
[1:17:21] well that's not the way our church sees
[1:17:23] it that's fine I'm fine I'm not going to
[1:17:26] contest with you or even be critical of
[1:17:28] you because unless God opens it up none
[1:17:33] of us understand it but God said I will
[1:17:36] I will reveal this word to My Chosen
[1:17:40] People amen
[1:17:42] hallelujah
[1:17:44] hallelujah nothing to be embarrassed
[1:17:46] about reading between them lines cuz
[1:17:49] I'll tell you what it is God got a hold
[1:17:51] to you brought it in
[1:17:53] and you got to look at it from God's
[1:17:55] point of view that's what we've been
[1:17:57] striving for that's what we long for
[1:18:01] right amen amen
[1:18:05] amen you see the recognition the real
[1:18:09] revelation of this you know we have an
[1:18:10] identity crisis in the Christian world
[1:18:12] yes sir we got people that say they got
[1:18:15] saved but nothing ever changed in their
[1:18:17] life they're still just the same old
[1:18:18] person we got people that say I see the
[1:18:20] message but nothing ever changed in that
[1:18:22] person's life my brother and sister so
[1:18:24] we have this identity crisis but I tell
[1:18:26] you what when you ever once come to the
[1:18:29] place that you see yourself in the word
[1:18:33] you'll never be the same now let me
[1:18:36] throw the the the the the the curve ball
[1:18:39] at
[1:18:39] you if it was just us seeing the word
[1:18:42] everything I spoke to you a few minutes
[1:18:44] ago is is contradicted that's right but
[1:18:47] us seeing oursel in the Word was God
[1:18:50] reaching out and pulling you in an eye
[1:18:53] into the word amen and it was there
[1:18:57] we're standing face to face with Jesus
[1:19:01] Christ in the word amen it's no longer
[1:19:05] what we are but it's what he is it's no
[1:19:08] longer what we've done but it's what he
[1:19:11] has done and we can then with confidence
[1:19:14] say I've been Beyond the Veil I've been
[1:19:16] in his presence he's spoken to me he has
[1:19:20] revealed himself to me no longer
[1:19:23] what we have done that's exactly
[1:19:26] Hallelujah but we come to a recognition
[1:19:29] this book and just pardon me I'll keep
[1:19:32] it simple for time's sake this book is
[1:19:35] my book that's right and I read it and I
[1:19:38] am a new creature in Christ Jesus amen
[1:19:42] you might read it just a little
[1:19:44] different than I
[1:19:50] do reminds me of brother
[1:19:56] won't allow anyone in the Pulpit song
[1:20:00] leader
[1:20:02] Deacon anyone without wearing a white
[1:20:06] shirt let's do a little poll
[1:20:10] today you know brother
[1:20:13] Caleb you're going to have to come
[1:20:14] finish the service
[1:20:21] buddy
[1:20:24] how do we want to interpret
[1:20:26] it our side looking in or Christ's side
[1:20:31] looking out that's ex
[1:20:38] right well let's take it other
[1:20:43] ways yeah we'll skip that
[1:20:47] one now in the seventh Church age
[1:20:50] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:20:55] this is a familiar quote to you you'll
[1:20:58] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[1:21:00] of this message that this book we are
[1:21:02] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:21:04] Jesus himself
[1:21:07] amen can someone tell me what the
[1:21:09] difference is between
[1:21:13] actual and
[1:21:21] factual
[1:21:23] some of you have been to
[1:21:25] college I found High School too
[1:21:29] hard so you'd say maybe Webster might
[1:21:32] disagree with
[1:21:35] you but did you know you can have all
[1:21:37] the facts and still not get it
[1:21:42] right that's exactly brother Manassa
[1:21:45] just this strikes me you studied some of
[1:21:47] that criminal justice you can have all
[1:21:50] the facts and miss miss it yeah body on
[1:21:53] sidewalk Bullet Hole yeah EXA right only
[1:21:57] to find out later that the bullet come
[1:21:59] from four blocks away and was a gunfight
[1:22:02] between gangsters down there nobody
[1:22:04] snuck up and shot the man but we'd think
[1:22:07] it's it's murder and we got to find
[1:22:09] Footprints and fingerprints and this and
[1:22:11] this and this so we can have facts but
[1:22:14] it not be
[1:22:18] actual that's
[1:22:20] it is the actual right not factual
[1:22:25] people say Jesus died for us but it's
[1:22:27] not really actual to them it's just a
[1:22:30] fact amen that's right I don't want to
[1:22:32] be labor that that's good revelation of
[1:22:35] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[1:22:38] in the future ages we are the future age
[1:22:41] then I mention that it takes the Holy
[1:22:43] Spirit to give us Revelation or we will
[1:22:47] fail to get it
[1:22:49] amen yeah bringing these two thoughts
[1:22:52] together you will see that it won't take
[1:22:55] just ordinary study or thinking to make
[1:22:58] this book real right it's going to take
[1:23:00] the operation of the Holy Ghost that
[1:23:05] means this book can't be revealed to
[1:23:08] anyone but oh my goodness you guys are
[1:23:10] so
[1:23:12] arrogant you guys are so no praise God
[1:23:16] that should bring joy in our hearts not
[1:23:19] separation the whole world should say
[1:23:21] praise God I'm that special class amen
[1:23:25] but instead they want to argue our view
[1:23:27] your view this view that
[1:23:30] view or even cadi themselves with their
[1:23:33] own
[1:23:35] view that
[1:23:37] happens can't be revealed to anyone but
[1:23:39] a special class of people who take one
[1:23:41] with prophetic Insight now look at this
[1:23:43] my brother and sister I want you to
[1:23:45] understand I don't remember if I even
[1:23:46] expressed What My Title of my sermon was
[1:23:48] today did I uh I don't know you know the
[1:23:51] power of Prophecy amen but the power of
[1:23:54] Prophecy my my brother and sister is
[1:23:56] only relevant if the prophecy comes to
[1:23:57] pass right lots of prophecies that have
[1:24:01] been
[1:24:01] given in fact let's see I believe it was
[1:24:04] May 31st of this year the Rapture was
[1:24:07] supposed to take
[1:24:09] place that man has a monster church with
[1:24:12] thousands of people that follow
[1:24:14] him what
[1:24:16] happens sweep it under the
[1:24:20] carpet well brother Trevor it didn't
[1:24:23] happen because you were supposed to be
[1:24:24] sitting 6 in further down the Pew glad
[1:24:28] of that no my brother and sister
[1:24:31] nonsense amen going to take the
[1:24:33] operation of the holy spirit because it
[1:24:34] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:24:36] special class of people it'll take one
[1:24:38] with prophetic Insight did you know as a
[1:24:40] Christian you were born with a prophetic
[1:24:42] Insight that you could look at the word
[1:24:44] of God and that word speaks to you you
[1:24:47] don't have to pry it open you don't have
[1:24:49] to tear it apart you don't have to go
[1:24:51] learn Greek or or Hebrew or Arabic to
[1:24:54] make it come to life to you because you
[1:24:56] were born with this prophetic insight to
[1:24:59] look in the word amen or should I say
[1:25:01] look out from the word amen no you guys
[1:25:04] are with me amen it will require the
[1:25:07] ability to hear from God it would
[1:25:10] require Supernatural let me go back to
[1:25:12] the ability to hear from God my brother
[1:25:14] and sister if whatever voice is speaking
[1:25:16] to us doesn't come right out of this
[1:25:17] word it wasn't from God period I don't
[1:25:22] care who they are right how much Tick
[1:25:25] Tock and
[1:25:27] whatever you know I don't care how many
[1:25:29] followers they got what channels they've
[1:25:31] got none of that stuff if it doesn't
[1:25:33] come out of the word my brother and
[1:25:35] sister it didn't come from God right
[1:25:37] amen it would require Supernatural
[1:25:40] instruction not just a student comparing
[1:25:42] verse with verse though that is
[1:25:46] good reminds me of a deal I read
[1:25:51] recently
[1:25:53] this lady posted a
[1:25:56] deal why I quit Bible
[1:26:00] study and the title of it caught me so
[1:26:03] much I was like now why would somebody
[1:26:05] commit or uh quit Bible
[1:26:09] studying so I listened to her little
[1:26:13] deal I don't know if what you'd call it
[1:26:15] wasn't really a video it's just a voice
[1:26:17] podcast is that what you'd call
[1:26:20] that and she gives all this rambling
[1:26:22] stuff that made absolutely no sense and
[1:26:24] I'm as I'm listening to it I'm thinking
[1:26:26] well it's no wonder you didn't get
[1:26:27] anything out of Bible study but then
[1:26:30] right at the end it threw out the very
[1:26:32] Crux she said I quit because I was more
[1:26:35] confused at the end than I was at the
[1:26:40] beginning would that be the word of God
[1:26:43] to the bride of Christ no no this
[1:26:46] mystery has been
[1:26:48] revealed it didn't bring confusion it
[1:26:51] brought
[1:26:53] Clarity amen so when you start to put my
[1:26:56] idea and your idea and their idea and
[1:26:59] the school's idea and the theology idea
[1:27:01] and everything in there it ends up more
[1:27:04] confusing than it
[1:27:06] started we got seven
[1:27:09] ages of clutter that's been dumped into
[1:27:14] the
[1:27:21] gospel I'll mind my business because I I
[1:27:24] I just should I should I was just going
[1:27:27] to tell you about something else I just
[1:27:28] read quite interesting but her mystery
[1:27:31] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:27:33] it never becomes clear that's it that's
[1:27:36] it you can read a verse in your Bible a
[1:27:38] thousand times if God doesn't open that
[1:27:40] to you it's the same words on the same
[1:27:43] page on number 1,000 as it was on number
[1:27:47] one how we need to hear from God and lay
[1:27:50] oh oh oh oh oh do you know lay
[1:27:54] yourselves open is just as important as
[1:27:58] take the book that's right that's right
[1:28:01] that's
[1:28:02] right that's right yeah got to be open
[1:28:05] to receive it that's right I've got the
[1:28:07] book praise
[1:28:11] God but I I don't think it fits our
[1:28:15] day it don't understand our
[1:28:19] day no it prophesied your day
[1:28:22] what do you mean it don't understand
[1:28:23] your day it prophesied your day amen it
[1:28:26] knows your day in
[1:28:28] detail how we need to hear from God lay
[1:28:31] ourselves open become yielded to the
[1:28:33] spirit to hear and
[1:28:37] know are we doing okay Saints amen
[1:28:41] okay
[1:28:43] amen you know how it is
[1:28:45] uh sometimes you just have so
[1:28:51] much
[1:28:57] we'll skip over some of that right
[1:29:00] there now let's look at
[1:29:03] this here is
[1:29:05] John laying the foundation for
[1:29:08] us now I can tell you my brother and
[1:29:11] sister that some would say in the
[1:29:13] competition I don't understand why they
[1:29:15] would be this maybe it's whatever uh
[1:29:18] Bible school they went to you know and
[1:29:20] they have to come up with something
[1:29:22] unique that nobody else has but you know
[1:29:24] some of these people being taught
[1:29:26] theology believe there was actually
[1:29:28] almost a
[1:29:30] competition and they believe it's
[1:29:32] reflected in the gospels because of this
[1:29:35] competition between the
[1:29:38] apostles and um so you you know you look
[1:29:41] at that um I I can see how that would
[1:29:45] happen you know God spoke to the Apostle
[1:29:48] Paul Apostle Paul comes and starts
[1:29:50] correcting yeah and they're like whoa
[1:29:52] whoa whoa whoa that's not how we see it
[1:29:54] but the Apostle Paul didn't say well
[1:29:55] let's sit down and compromise this he
[1:29:57] said look I was on the back side of the
[1:29:59] desert and God come to me and spoke and
[1:30:03] this is what it is you need to sit down
[1:30:05] and be
[1:30:06] silent wow how many of would accept
[1:30:10] that not
[1:30:12] many not many would accept
[1:30:15] that but to come with authority right to
[1:30:19] be able to come with authority and say
[1:30:22] this is what God spoke amen now look how
[1:30:26] this comes that in a different context
[1:30:29] because of different Natures but
[1:30:30] remember John come out of the Wilderness
[1:30:33] and they thought he was a wild man right
[1:30:35] right so here is John now well we'll
[1:30:39] we'll move on from the Apostle Paul but
[1:30:41] look now John is laying a foundation
[1:30:44] look Revelation my brother and sister is
[1:30:46] you might say the culmination of
[1:30:48] everything put together and and I I I
[1:30:51] took some quotes out a a revelation book
[1:30:53] of symbols here we'll read that in a
[1:30:54] minute but you see John is now coming
[1:30:57] and he is showing us he's laying a
[1:31:00] foundation that you would say well may
[1:31:03] maybe Apostle Paul would have said it
[1:31:06] different but it doesn't matter how the
[1:31:08] Apostle Paul would have said it it's
[1:31:10] whether or not they doed him that's
[1:31:14] it let me give you an example I thought
[1:31:16] this was so humorous out of a book I
[1:31:18] read
[1:31:19] recently somebody said what about this
[1:31:21] and that and he said well I'll tell you
[1:31:24] this it ain't
[1:31:28] up can you interpret that
[1:31:32] anybody he could have said it's down but
[1:31:35] he said it ain't
[1:31:38] up but he said the same thing did he not
[1:31:41] it's not up it's
[1:31:44] down or vice
[1:31:48] versa was he
[1:31:50] wrong different way to say it but he's
[1:31:53] whole truth now Paul's laying this
[1:31:57] Foundation exactly and this is what I
[1:31:59] really want to get to exactly as he
[1:32:02] received it
[1:32:03] amen now the ministry that God gave to
[1:32:06] the Apostle Paul became a very much a
[1:32:08] foundation of the New Testament but my
[1:32:11] brother and sister as it is we have this
[1:32:13] commonality and that is what Paul
[1:32:16] received he didn't doctor it he passed
[1:32:20] it on and as John has received this from
[1:32:23] the one who is standing on the land and
[1:32:25] on the sea he received this he doesn't
[1:32:29] doctor it he passes it right on
[1:32:32] amen he gave a proper response they said
[1:32:35] take the book amen so he come what would
[1:32:39] be the proper response if God told you
[1:32:42] today in a literal voice to you take the
[1:32:45] book what would you
[1:32:48] say give me the book
[1:32:55] that's right you know why you're sitting
[1:32:56] here
[1:32:57] today because he told you to take the
[1:32:59] book amen and you said give me the book
[1:33:03] amen amen that's
[1:33:05] right and he said unto me take it eat it
[1:33:08] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:33:12] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:33:14] honey and I
[1:33:16] took I can say Amen to that well isn't
[1:33:20] that how you read it
[1:33:23] come on yeah come on I don't care how
[1:33:26] you how you look at the the page you
[1:33:29] going to be saying I that's what John
[1:33:31] said when you read it you're reading and
[1:33:36] I took the book am amen so if you just
[1:33:41] read that in sincerity you're testifying
[1:33:43] to the Lord I want the book amen or you
[1:33:46] can just read it like a
[1:33:47] novel I read my Bible and I read a
[1:33:51] sister fense story I didn't see any
[1:33:53] difference well I'm sorry you didn't
[1:33:55] really take the book you just had
[1:33:58] book give me the
[1:34:01] book but you know there's Bibles
[1:34:03] everywhere do you know the Bible is
[1:34:05] still on the bestselling list of books
[1:34:08] in the
[1:34:10] world look it up it waivers up and down
[1:34:13] you know there's been different books
[1:34:14] that that come but pretty much the Bible
[1:34:17] dominates as the most published book on
[1:34:20] the face of the Earth
[1:34:24] there ought not be a heathen
[1:34:27] one anywhere in the
[1:34:30] world but having the
[1:34:32] book and eating the
[1:34:34] book it's too different that's exactly
[1:34:38] right
[1:34:42] amen
[1:34:43] amen wait till you have a friend one day
[1:34:45] that looks at you and says you take the
[1:34:47] Bible too literal
[1:34:49] Paul guilty
[1:34:53] guilty it's a book of suggestions a book
[1:34:56] of
[1:34:58] ideas okay you're
[1:35:01] right let me change my vocabulary and
[1:35:04] God suggested that Paul take the
[1:35:09] book yeah that's a suggestion I want to
[1:35:13] follow and he also suggested that I eat
[1:35:16] the book that's right okay I don't care
[1:35:19] how technical you want to be on your
[1:35:21] langage my brother and sister because it
[1:35:23] all comes the beauty of the word is to
[1:35:27] the
[1:35:31] hearer and the critics are always right
[1:35:33] just ask
[1:35:35] them amen Bible's everywhere no value if
[1:35:39] we don't eat it now this should be read
[1:35:42] real personal really because you see
[1:35:44] it's Christ the word speaking to
[1:35:47] you and how do you respond right M
[1:35:52] exactly right give me the book
[1:35:59] amen would you agree with me today he
[1:36:02] gave you the book absolutely right
[1:36:05] absolutely lives are changed that's it
[1:36:08] our world has become completely
[1:36:09] different that's
[1:36:11] right people with behavior
[1:36:16] issues you realize how broad that
[1:36:20] is behavior issues
[1:36:24] changed
[1:36:26] amen as one Minister puts it some of you
[1:36:29] sitting here today we prison
[1:36:32] bait and some of us would had to have
[1:36:35] said that might well be us amen and we
[1:36:39] met a brother back East
[1:36:42] amen you know has to do with the prison
[1:36:47] system my brother and sister when he
[1:36:49] tells you starts sharing little things
[1:36:51] to do with the
[1:36:53] prison and you think is being a
[1:36:56] Christian difficult at
[1:37:02] times let's embrace it I ask you a
[1:37:04] question I want an
[1:37:06] answer is being a Christian difficult at
[1:37:09] times just go visit a prison and you'll
[1:37:13] think that whatever you face as a
[1:37:14] Christian it's just going to be nothing
[1:37:17] compared and that's just natural right
[1:37:21] as it were right so if being a Christian
[1:37:25] can be difficult my brother and sister
[1:37:27] let's look at this let me hurry along
[1:37:29] here so you get you ask you know he ask
[1:37:32] you he you say give me the book he gives
[1:37:35] you the
[1:37:36] book and we're being obedient right now
[1:37:40] the words right here before you
[1:37:43] Saints he told you when you eat this
[1:37:49] book can anybody answer
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:11] the pain
[1:38:12] here is not bitter
[1:38:14] enough the sweetness is greater that's
[1:38:19] it amen and we keep right on Amen eating
[1:38:24] the
[1:38:29] book
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:32] Hallelujah I know none of you have ever
[1:38:34] done it but you eat something it's so
[1:38:37] good you go back and eat some more and
[1:38:39] then you go get it out of the fridge and
[1:38:40] you eat some more then you eat some more
[1:38:44] then you got a belly
[1:38:45] ache yeah are you guys normal yeah
[1:38:49] normal okay you've done it
[1:38:52] okay see what
[1:38:55] happened the book is so
[1:38:59] sweet how beautiful the book is so
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:06] sweet but the bitter that's it is this
[1:39:11] word that's it bringing your flesh
[1:39:14] that's it into subjection exactly right
[1:39:17] amen that's the bitter part that's right
[1:39:20] amen that's why they coined the phrase
[1:39:24] God
[1:39:26] understands I'm not going to eat the
[1:39:28] book because I don't want to deal with
[1:39:29] the bitterness but God understands no
[1:39:32] God understands when you say give me the
[1:39:34] book that's right give me the book and
[1:39:36] you said eat I'm going to eat that's
[1:39:37] what God understands he doesn't
[1:39:39] understand our convoluted view of
[1:39:43] Christianity wants people that want the
[1:39:47] book and you know it's going to be bit
[1:39:52] cuz you know it causes a body change
[1:39:56] that's it those who believe in a Rapture
[1:39:57] are looking for a body change what
[1:39:59] they're not looking for it is to happen
[1:40:02] today they want to take place in a
[1:40:04] Rapture amen but if this body doesn't
[1:40:06] change here it won't be in a Rapture so
[1:40:09] here's the body changing the bitterness
[1:40:12] of eating the book is causing us oh I
[1:40:16] just come across studying this message I
[1:40:18] won't go into detail but I just come
[1:40:20] across something that struck me I sat in
[1:40:22] my office in the wee hours of the
[1:40:24] morning crying Lord help me amen help me
[1:40:28] Lord I've got to fulfill this it's not I
[1:40:30] want to I've got to Lord
[1:40:34] amen amen the bitterness coming back
[1:40:38] affecting our life and you know what
[1:40:39] will happen we'll change amen we're not
[1:40:42] going to find an excuse we're going to
[1:40:43] change we're going to move into this
[1:40:46] sture of a perfect man we're going to
[1:40:48] move into this position God has called
[1:40:50] us to yes amen that's right but let me
[1:40:53] tell you before we close
[1:40:56] here about the honey of the
[1:41:01] word coming to
[1:41:04] us it's so
[1:41:10] sweet how do you counteract the
[1:41:16] bitter by eating more book that's
[1:41:19] it
[1:41:21] seems like a paradox doesn't
[1:41:23] it how do I deal with the conflict in my
[1:41:27] life keep eating that's right how do I
[1:41:30] get rid of this bitterness down at my
[1:41:32] belly keep eating that's right amen keep
[1:41:36] the word in your thoughts amen keep the
[1:41:39] word in your lips that's it speak it
[1:41:43] amen confess it sing of it amen give
[1:41:46] praise for it that's right Amen Let the
[1:41:49] sweetness of the word be with you every
[1:41:52] day cuz I tell you my brother and sister
[1:41:55] you
[1:41:56] know I used to be definitely a qualified
[1:41:59] overeater is that a is that a
[1:42:03] title who are you an
[1:42:07] overeater and I would eat so much ice
[1:42:09] cream I'd get a belly
[1:42:11] ache I could eat so much cake I would
[1:42:14] get a belly ache I could eat so many
[1:42:15] cookies I'd have a belly
[1:42:17] ache and in the end of it I couldn't
[1:42:20] remember remember what the first cookie
[1:42:21] tasted like and in a few minutes you
[1:42:24] can't remember what the last cookie
[1:42:25] taste
[1:42:29] like but I remember when I first ate the
[1:42:31] book that's it hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:36] that's right and it caused a
[1:42:39] multi-year bitterness in my life that's
[1:42:42] it that I struggled and tripped and fell
[1:42:44] over and struggled and tripped and fell
[1:42:46] over and struggled and T tripped and
[1:42:49] fell over but there was there was
[1:42:51] something inside am something inside oh
[1:42:55] my diet wouldn't have been enough to
[1:42:57] have supported me today but there was
[1:42:59] something in me in that day that I
[1:43:01] couldn't help and I would go back and
[1:43:02] take another bite of the book knowing
[1:43:04] that it was going to be bitter in my
[1:43:06] belly knowing I had lost of the Flesh
[1:43:08] and pride of life and all of these other
[1:43:11] things knowing I had to deal with this
[1:43:15] but something drew me back to take
[1:43:17] another bite of the book amen
[1:43:21] and then I started to
[1:43:22] realize as a qualified
[1:43:25] overeater you don't worry about the
[1:43:27] belly ache as long as they're still ice
[1:43:28] cream in the bowl keep
[1:43:30] eating you're going to face the belly
[1:43:32] ache but the taste of the ice cream is
[1:43:34] so sweet now if we could do that in the
[1:43:37] natural I know none of you ever did that
[1:43:40] people like
[1:43:41] you we could do that in the natural how
[1:43:45] about we
[1:43:46] decide that this is so sweet that's it
[1:43:50] I've got to eat it that's it I've got to
[1:43:52] eat it I will eat it every day I'll eat
[1:43:55] it and I'll confess it and I'll sing of
[1:43:57] it I'll bring it to pass amen I'll
[1:44:00] Fellowship around it amen because you
[1:44:03] see the word's changing us amen if you
[1:44:06] don't think so that's if you don't think
[1:44:09] so maybe you can go back through your

[1:44:23] albums out and you don't want me to see
[1:44:24] them you might want to hide
[1:44:26] them cuz I want to see who you was
[1:44:29] that's
[1:44:30] right I remember being at some
[1:44:32] believer's house one time and i' look
