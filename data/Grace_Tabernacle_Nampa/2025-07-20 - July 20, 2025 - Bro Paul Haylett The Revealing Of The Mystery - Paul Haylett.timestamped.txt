[4:35] upon life's boundless ocean where mighty
[4:40] billows roll. I fix my hope in Jesus

[5:18] to save. I've anchored in the rock of
[5:23] aes.

[5:30] blessed peace. His voice had stilled the
[5:34] waters and build their tumult cease. my
[5:38] pilot and deliverer. To him I all

[5:47] he's at my side. And I've anchored in

[6:25] and shields me from the blast. By faith
[6:29] I'm looking upward beyond life's
[6:32] troubled sea.

[17:27] spoken across this pulpit, Lord Jesus,
[17:30] and we just ask that you meet the needs
[17:32] of everyone.

[17:38] Lord. We just pray that you'd give them
[17:40] a touch divinely, Father, and just bring

[17:46] health.

[27:57] In everything
[28:00] I say
[28:01] &gt;&gt; yes
[28:02] &gt;&gt; and do
[28:03] &gt;&gt; be glorified.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Certainly I know that our hearts are
[28:10] such that we would desire to
[28:14] always say and do the right thing. But
[28:16] sometimes we find ourselves maybe a
[28:20] little bit of contradiction to oursel to
[28:22] what we believe who we are.
[28:25] But the Lord will still be glorified in
[28:29] us. Amen. His work will be done. Amen.
[28:34] It will be fulfilled. No amount of
[28:36] unbelief, doubts, fears, anxieties will
[28:39] stop the promise of God. Amen.
[28:43] Well, God bless you this morning. I I
[28:47] just um
[28:49] want to say um God bless sister Sammy
[28:52] and Logan. I don't see your big brother,
[28:56] but um anyway, and I forgot your name,
[29:00] sweetheart. I'm just terrible. We're
[29:02] good to see you. Glad to see you today.
[29:04] Amen. Uh, Brother Manassa, I
[29:08] I wrote your name on a prayer request
[29:11] because I was thinking and uh thinking
[29:15] about you and Katie.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; And um I just expressed that that uh my
[29:22] thoughts. I was excited to hear that you
[29:25] have moved back to Idaho and pray the
[29:28] Lord just give us some time we can rub
[29:30] shoulders again. Amen. Ethan, God bless
[29:33] you today and uh each and every one of
[29:36] you. Just so happy to see each and every
[29:38] one of you. Amen. One of these days all
[29:41] the vacationers will come home and the
[29:43] church will be full again. But um I just
[29:46] I'm thankful for all of you. We're just
[29:49] uh steady,
[29:51] faithful, and God is good. Amen. So, I
[29:56] just want to uh share with you that this
[29:58] coming Sunday, this coming weekend, uh
[30:01] we will be gone to uh Monmouth, Oregon
[30:04] to be speaking for the Valley Christian
[30:07] believers there, Brother Rich Cobb and
[30:09] the saints there in Monmouth. And uh so,
[30:12] Brother David will have this coming
[30:14] Sunday service. And uh just ask that you
[30:17] would pray for us. the Lord would just
[30:19] lay on our hearts um um the right things
[30:22] for them just to have some special
[30:24] services on the weekend. Amen. I just
[30:27] want to say this morning just very
[30:29] interesting how the Lord works. Uh this
[30:33] is not giving glory to men but uh early
[30:37] this morning, brother Sergey sent me a
[30:39] text of a scripture uh that uh said,
[30:42] "Hey, this inspired me this morning."
[30:46] And uh I sent a text back to him. Yes, I
[30:49] just read that. And when we get to it in
[30:51] this scripture, you'll see that where
[30:53] what he sent me stops.
[30:56] My notes begin today. Amen. And uh then
[31:00] actually, brother Trevor in your prayer
[31:02] right there and brother Alex in just few
[31:05] words there just little things that
[31:07] touch and it just really stirs my heart.
[31:10] God is so faithful. Amen. We don't have
[31:12] to receive a program in the mail so we
[31:15] can all be of the same mind. Amen. When
[31:18] when my dad was part of kind of the lay
[31:21] ministry in the Methodist church, uh you
[31:24] know, the the they would receive every
[31:27] Monday morning, they had to obviously
[31:29] mail it previous. Every Monday morning,
[31:32] the church would receive uh the the
[31:36] outline for the week. And then uh the
[31:39] church would then it was kind of a a
[31:41] little cue for the ministry and the
[31:43] people to to be in the same thought or
[31:46] the same mind during the week. And then
[31:49] they would all say, "Oh, praise God. All
[31:51] the Methodist churches are preaching on
[31:53] the same thing, the leadership of the
[31:56] Holy Spirit." But my brother and sister,
[31:59] we truly see how that God puts it on the
[32:02] heart. He sends a memo out. He sends the
[32:04] flyer out, but he doesn't put it in the
[32:07] mail. And it doesn't say you have to
[32:09] follow this, but it's there. He puts it
[32:12] on the hearts in the thoughts of man
[32:15] that we would find that this morning.
[32:18] You can pick up a phone if you would and
[32:20] you could call and realize there is a
[32:22] common thread and that's the moving of
[32:24] the Holy Spirit. I want to speak to you
[32:27] this morning. Uh God bless you. I
[32:29] enjoyed the song service. Brother Alex,
[32:31] Sister Ruth, Brother Titus. Uh just
[32:34] lovely atmosphere. Amen. uh just been
[32:37] kind of studying this actually is tied
[32:39] in my mind anyway to my sheep. It's it's
[32:44] like another step, right? The sheep got
[32:46] to know who they are. The sheep got to
[32:48] understand why they exist and what God
[32:50] is doing. Amen. So, we want to talk
[32:53] about the revealing of the mystery today
[32:56] and how the revelation of the mystery is
[32:59] not nearly as deep as people want to
[33:03] make it. And you'd say, "What is that?"
[33:06] Well, we'll talk about it today if you
[33:09] don't mind. And um Mark the 4th chapter
[33:19] starting verse 9 through verse 20.
[33:23] And uh
[33:26] this is very familiar scripture to us,
[33:28] right? I mean, it's just we never want
[33:30] to say this scripture is common place.
[33:33] it it never should become so common that
[33:35] it's common place but it is a a very
[33:38] known scripture to us that we have
[33:40] studied and read and and preached about
[33:43] many times Mark 4 and 9 through 20 and
[33:47] he said unto them he that hath ears to
[33:50] hear let him hear so one has to already
[33:56] have the right ears
[33:59] &gt;&gt; you don't just say oh I was born with
[34:01] ears I can hear
[34:03] &gt;&gt; that would be what the common thought
[34:05] would be
[34:06] &gt;&gt; that hey we're all Christians we all
[34:09] hear the same thing
[34:11] &gt;&gt; but it's not so
[34:12] &gt;&gt; he's telling he that hath ears to hear
[34:14] let him hear and when he was alone they
[34:17] were about him with the twel asked of
[34:20] him the parable now remember scripture
[34:24] says when Jesus spoke he spoke in
[34:27] parables right
[34:28] &gt;&gt; so you have to have an understanding ing
[34:32] not just take it word for word from the
[34:34] page because otherwise you come up with
[34:36] all kinds of conclusions but you have to
[34:38] have an understanding that comes with
[34:40] ears anointed to hear.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; And when he is alone they that were
[34:44] about him with the 12 asked of him the
[34:46] parable. And he said unto them unto you
[34:50] it is given to know the mystery of the
[34:52] kingdom of God. Can someone say amen to
[34:54] that?
[34:56] But unto them that are without all these
[35:00] things are done in parables, that seeing
[35:03] they may see and not perceive, and
[35:05] hearing they may hear and not
[35:08] understand, lest at any time they should
[35:11] be converted, and their shi sin should
[35:14] be forgiven them. So this is not this is
[35:17] not Jesus saying uh you know what I
[35:20] don't want them to be saved but it
[35:22] really is tying back into predestination
[35:25] that the ability to hear the word was
[35:28] not something that we acquired
[35:31] &gt;&gt; it was actually born in us.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; It was a gift from God
[35:35] &gt;&gt; that we could hear. Amen.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, "Know ye not this
[35:43] parable? How then will you know all
[35:46] parables? The swer sweethth the word. So
[35:50] we'll see. I'm just taking the second
[35:52] part of this because of the length of
[35:54] it. But now is the interpretation of the
[35:57] parable that's just above this in
[35:59] scripture. The ser sweth
[36:03] and these are they by the wayside where
[36:07] the word is sown. But when they have
[36:09] heard, Satan cometh immediately, and
[36:12] taketh away the word that was sown in
[36:15] their hearts. And these are they
[36:17] likewise which are sown on stony ground,
[36:21] who when they have heard the word,
[36:23] immediately receive it with gladness,
[36:26] and have no root in themselves, and so
[36:29] endure but for a time afterwards when
[36:32] affliction or persecution aristh for the
[36:35] word's sake. Not just not just
[36:38] afflictions and persecution of natural
[36:40] life.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Not not the things of my, you know, God
[36:44] doesn't love me. I wrecked my car.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Nothing to do with that kind of
[36:49] atmosphere. But when it comes down and
[36:51] the weight and the heat and everything
[36:53] is brought to bear upon your life
[36:55] because of the gospel,
[36:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Immediately they are offended. And these
[37:02] are they which are sown amongst thorns,
[37:05] such as hear the word, and the cares of
[37:08] this world, and the deceitfulness of
[37:10] riches, and lust of other things
[37:13] entering in choke the word, and it
[37:16] becometh unfruitful. Amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; And these are they which were which are
[37:21] sown on good ground such as hear the
[37:24] word and receive it and bring forth
[37:27] fruit. Some 30fold, some 60, and some
[37:30] hundred. Heavenly Father, we would just
[37:32] ask you to come open the word to us
[37:34] today. Speak to us, Father. We thank
[37:37] you, Lord, for your precious word, the
[37:39] life that you have given us. We ask you
[37:41] to bless each and everyone today in your
[37:43] precious name. Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I would like to greet our
[37:47] visitors. Are they?
[37:51] Yes. God bless our visitors today. You
[37:53] may be seated. Amen.
[37:57] I want to focus for just a moment on
[38:00] verse 11. Uh as this is my brother and
[38:04] sister not an intellectual
[38:06] understanding, not an intellectualism
[38:09] that brings about an understanding, but
[38:12] this is a gift of God. He said unto
[38:14] them, "Unto you it is given to know the
[38:16] mystery of the kingdom of God, but unto
[38:19] them that are without." In other words,
[38:21] without, they're outside of the kingdom.
[38:23] Amen. And we sit here today not knowing
[38:25] who is part of the kingdom and who is
[38:28] not. So, it's not for us to put in or
[38:30] out to to encourage only some. We want
[38:33] to encourage all to believe. Amen. All
[38:36] to take a hold of the word of God. And
[38:39] so it's there that you see all these
[38:41] things are done in parables. And you
[38:44] know parables are still baffling the
[38:46] world today. I I uh in in my studies I
[38:49] look at different aspects of where uh uh
[38:52] uh the church world and different things
[38:54] are. And my brother and sister it is
[38:57] there that we see that some taking the
[38:59] word of God putting their spin on it or
[39:02] pursuing wealth. They say that God loves
[39:05] you. He's going to make you rich. Uh and
[39:08] uh I I believe that I I ab absolutely
[39:11] with all of my heart believe that God
[39:13] loves us and is going to make us rich in
[39:15] the gospel.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the kingdom of God, he's going
[39:18] to make us rich. He never promised us to
[39:21] be rich in the natural world. He never
[39:24] said this is a sign of sunny skies and
[39:27] and good days are not a sign of God's
[39:29] love and and cloudy days or rainy days
[39:32] are not a sign of his displeasure. But
[39:35] God's love is when he reveals his word
[39:37] to us. He starts to speak to our heart.
[39:40] And what he's doing is giving us a love
[39:42] letter that's coming down saying, "You
[39:44] know what? I love you. And so I'm going
[39:47] to reveal myself to you." Now, you think
[39:50] about in the natural how it is, my
[39:52] brother and sister. This might be a
[39:54] little shocking way to put it, but in
[39:56] not a perverted love of the world today,
[39:58] but in real true love, if a young man or
[40:02] young woman loves a young man, you know,
[40:04] they they don't flaunt themselves to
[40:06] that. But there comes a time of a
[40:08] revealing. That's why as it is, we don't
[40:11] really look at at it as as dating. you
[40:14] just uh you know with a young man here,
[40:16] a young girl there and and flitting
[40:18] around, but actually you pray and in
[40:20] sincerity you desire the Lord to reveal
[40:25] who this person is or who it is that you
[40:27] really love and and uh be the right
[40:30] person. And so it's there that God comes
[40:33] down in a true example of courtship and
[40:36] is slowly revealing himself to us. And
[40:40] as he reveals himself, we have come to
[40:43] the place that we realize, I can't live
[40:45] without him. Amen. This is who I've got
[40:48] to to serve, who I want to be with all
[40:51] of my life. And so it's there we still
[40:54] see that the world is baffled by these
[40:57] parables of scripture, how that they are
[40:59] confessing, as I said, that its wealth
[41:01] is a sign. Some say, well, it's speaking
[41:04] in tongues is the sign. But my brother
[41:06] and sister, God through his word has
[41:09] clearly revealed himself. As the parable
[41:12] is being revealed, it's being brought
[41:14] out. As the disciples sought Jesus for
[41:17] the answer of the parable, so we today
[41:20] should be seeking for the answer to the
[41:23] parable of our lives. Amen. What God is
[41:26] speaking to us. and so many
[41:28] interpretations that that are in the
[41:30] world today of of what is uh what God is
[41:34] expecting and what God is is doing. And
[41:37] my brother and sister, I say this uh a
[41:40] little tongue and cheek. Please don't
[41:41] place too much emphasis on it. But
[41:43] people are saying, you know, this is
[41:45] what God spoke to me and it's absolutely
[41:48] contrary to the word of God. So it
[41:50] wasn't God speaking to them. They should
[41:52] stop and say, "Okay, if it's contrary to
[41:54] the word, God is not going to change his
[41:57] word to make me happy." Amen. So, if
[42:00] it's contrary to the word, then it
[42:02] wasn't really God. A but he come as an
[42:05] angel of light. Satan did. He come as an
[42:07] angel of light. And the people are
[42:09] saying, "Yes, this is what was revealed
[42:11] to me." Absolutely contrary to
[42:13] scripture. So, uh, you know, I just say
[42:15] this with the barest of information, but
[42:19] I received a phone call, uh, a couple
[42:22] days here that, uh, someone wanting to
[42:24] know if our our church did spiritual
[42:27] weddings. And I'm like, what is a
[42:29] spiritual wedding? And they said, "Well,
[42:31] that's when people of the same sex don't
[42:34] really want to have a physical
[42:35] relationship, but they want to have an
[42:37] emotional relationship as husband and
[42:40] wife. Do you do that?
[42:45] And I think it was just the grace of God
[42:47] first thing come out of my mouth. Is
[42:49] that biblical?
[42:51] &gt;&gt; And they said, "What do you mean by
[42:53] biblical?" I said, "Can you find that in
[42:55] the Bible?" Goodbye. Click.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; See, my brother and sister, this is what
[43:01] we're coming down to. Is that what the
[43:03] church is put in place for?
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this sounds like I'm against
[43:09] this, but I'm not. But is the church
[43:11] supposed to be a food bank?
[43:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Is the church supposed to be a political
[43:16] activist?
[43:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; All of these things that have been by
[43:20] interpretation drawn out of the out of
[43:24] the the the word of God, out of the
[43:26] message, the gospel, and people have
[43:28] done they they have so much conjecture.
[43:31] They have so much guessing about what is
[43:33] our call. Well, first and foremost, the
[43:36] church is a house of God and should be
[43:38] reverenced as a house of God. And it is
[43:41] a place we come to meet God. And not
[43:44] just in theory, but in literal
[43:47] a presence of the Holy Spirit coming to
[43:50] talk to you and I on a personal basis.
[43:53] Amen. Not a place to learn the theory of
[43:55] religion. Not a place to come of the
[43:58] opinion of religion, but to come see the
[44:01] very expression of Jesus Christ living
[44:04] in our midst. Amen. And so if it's all
[44:07] about our guessing or conjecture, you
[44:10] know, what is it? There's so much we
[44:12] could guess on, no wonder it's so
[44:14] confusing today because people are still
[44:17] arguing over things that are very
[44:19] clearly in the scripture, things that
[44:22] are black and white. And yet man by his
[44:25] very nature wants to say, "I want to
[44:28] know the reason why God says this, this,
[44:31] this, and this." God said, "I said it.
[44:33] You should just believe it." And if I'm
[44:35] God, then you don't have to doubt what
[44:38] I'm telling you. Now, me as a man
[44:41] standing here before you, I might fumble
[44:43] it. And I have done it over over the
[44:45] years uh uh you know, misstate
[44:47] something, not frame it quite right. But
[44:50] my brother and sister, if we have a
[44:52] doubt that God has misframed his word,
[44:55] it it's been misplaced or mis by God. My
[44:59] brother and sister, we're not really
[45:01] Christians.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't say, "I'm a Christian,
[45:04] but I question."
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's got answers for your
[45:08] questions, but we're not here to
[45:10] question. Amen. We're here to say,
[45:11] "Lord, I need an answer for this, for my
[45:14] life." But when we start to question
[45:16] God, then we'll look at this and say,
[45:18] "Well, if God so loved the world that he
[45:20] gave his only begotten son, then how
[45:22] come not everyone is saved?"
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; But the answer is in the scripture.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; The answer is in the word, but they
[45:30] don't want to receive that answer
[45:31] because it's too direct for them.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Instead of saying, "Lord, forgive me for
[45:36] my position of where I'm at." Unless
[45:38] someone would misunderstand what I'm
[45:40] saying this morning, this is part of my
[45:42] everyday prayers. Lord, help me to
[45:44] understand and forgive me where I have
[45:46] come short. Amen. Cuz I'm not standing
[45:49] here as some perfect man preaching down.
[45:51] I'm standing here as a man that believes
[45:54] in living life to the fullest. And in
[45:56] doing that, sometimes you bump against
[45:58] the boundaries. And God says, "You know
[46:00] what? You just bump the boundary, but I
[46:03] have grace for you." Amen. And then he
[46:05] anoints us to say, "Wait, I'm driving in
[46:07] the ditch. I'm I'm knocking all the
[46:09] empty McDonald's sacks and rappers and
[46:12] Pepsi cans out of the way because I'm in
[46:14] the ditch. And God says, "I don't want
[46:16] you in that ditch." And we by our human
[46:18] nature get up and we cross right over
[46:21] and we just drive in the ditch on the
[46:23] other side for a while. And then God
[46:25] says, "No, that isn't what I wanted you
[46:27] to do. I want you to come back to the
[46:29] center of the road and I that's where I
[46:31] want you to be." And so by nature, we
[46:34] want to we want to frame it in the way
[46:37] that we think we're supposed to serve
[46:39] God. Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; But I can't find anywhere where God
[46:43] says, "Read my word and guess what it
[46:45] meant." That's right.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God very clearly says, "I'm going
[46:49] to reveal to you.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give to you the answers to
[46:53] your life question." Amen. And you can
[46:56] then base or or place your whole life
[47:00] upon my word. That's right. Amen. Cuz if
[47:03] his word lies,
[47:05] &gt;&gt; how are we going to as mere mortals
[47:07] decide what is true and what is not.
[47:09] That's right.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; We have to have an absolute that we can
[47:12] hang on to with all of our life and say,
[47:14] you know what, this is God's word. I
[47:17] believe this and it's never been proven
[47:19] false yet. So, I'm going to hold on to
[47:22] it.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:25] Now, second Peter 1:16-19.
[47:40] For we have not followed cunningly
[47:42] devised fables,
[47:43] &gt;&gt; right,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; when we made known unto you the power
[47:46] and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but
[47:49] were eyewitnesses of his majesty. Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Now, my brother and sister here today,
[47:54] what we need to do is be a church full
[47:57] of eyewitnesses.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not not has been. And and look,
[48:01] I'm just going to speak this blunt. Too
[48:03] many people have an understanding of the
[48:05] message as though if you believe what
[48:08] brother Brandham said and the framework
[48:10] of him as a man. So, I'll follow him
[48:13] real close and it'll all work out.
[48:15] That's not what he come for. He says it.
[48:18] This is not what I come for. I come to
[48:21] introduce you.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love that? When you're
[48:25] supposed to be introduced to somebody,
[48:27] my brother and sister, you're going to
[48:29] meet somebody, you don't go there and
[48:32] get introduced to to something else,
[48:34] something different. Or the person doing
[48:36] the introducing says, "Well, they didn't
[48:38] show up. I'll take their place."
[48:41] &gt;&gt; You know, so here it is. Brother Brown
[48:44] says, "Now, I I come to introduce you."
[48:46] See, he didn't come to say, "I come to
[48:48] introduce me."
[48:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. I didn't come to to draw
[48:51] you to me. I come to introduce you to
[48:55] Jesus Christ. Amen. And so you might say
[48:58] the success of the message is people's
[49:01] understanding in that and that alone
[49:04] because if you view it in any other
[49:06] fashion then you will be attracted to
[49:08] worship men. Amen. But we're not
[49:10] attracted to worship men. We are called
[49:12] to serve our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[49:15] there are natural and spiritual people
[49:18] in our lives uh that are there that help
[49:21] us along the way. People who mentor us,
[49:24] people who encourage us, people who have
[49:26] answers for questions in our life. But
[49:29] we don't worship that person. We say,
[49:31] "Thank you, Lord, that that person is in
[49:33] my life because they are helping me find
[49:36] answers that I'm searching for." But we
[49:38] only have one that we worship and that
[49:40] is Jesus Christ. Don't let anyone ever
[49:43] tell you that there's any other answer
[49:45] to that equation because we are here
[49:48] simply to worship Jesus Christ.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful
[49:54] &gt;&gt; as a man when I first started doing
[49:56] carpentry.
[49:57] I was so thankful that they were men
[50:00] that actually cared enough to say,
[50:01] "Paul, you're getting the right answer,
[50:03] but you're getting it in the wrong way."
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Exactly. That's it.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; You know, in carpentry, you know, you
[50:08] can do all kinds of things. You know,
[50:10] sometimes don't even have to figure out
[50:11] angles to build a hippen valley on a
[50:14] house. You can fake your way through it.
[50:20] And no, I won't explain all of that, but
[50:23] I would perfected faking
[50:26] until men come and say, you know, a
[50:28] speed square, you know why they have all
[50:29] these lines and all these different
[50:31] points on it? That is so you can come
[50:33] and when you go to cut a hip in a
[50:35] valley, you can go in there and you can
[50:37] do a simple equation to figure out what
[50:39] the degrees of that hip and valley are
[50:41] or it should be on the blueprint.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; And then you can take a speed square and
[50:46] you can cut perfect lines every single
[50:49] time by simply knowing that the square
[50:53] won't lie to you.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Imagine you look down once and the
[50:59] square says this. You look down again,
[51:01] it says something else. You would never
[51:03] know what to trust and you would never
[51:05] come out with a perfect product.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; And the gospel, my brother and sister,
[51:10] is that sure.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; And that true for us today that we don't
[51:13] have to guess at it. We don't need to do
[51:15] it. What we need to do is just figure
[51:17] out. And the angle of this hip and
[51:19] valley, if you could take it that way,
[51:21] is a simple fact that the word of God
[51:23] promised, I will lead you and guide you
[51:24] into all truth. So therefore, truth is
[51:27] right here for us. We don't have to go
[51:30] digging through a dumpster to find
[51:32] truth. It's right here before us. And
[51:34] God says, "I will never never lead you
[51:37] from my word.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; I will always lead you." Amen. So, we're
[51:41] not followingly devised fables. We made
[51:44] unto you the power and the coming of our
[51:46] Lord Jesus Christ. But we're
[51:47] eyewitnesses.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; For he received from God the Father
[51:51] honor and glory when there comes such a
[51:54] voice to him from the excellent glory.
[51:56] This is my beloved son in whom I am well
[51:59] pleased. And I want to tell you what was
[52:01] poured into Christ was poured into the
[52:03] church which is you. Amen. And you will
[52:06] hear these very same words. Amen. This
[52:09] is my beloved son in whom I am well
[52:12] pleased. Those words are for you. Well
[52:15] done, my good and faithful servant. So
[52:17] don't get discouraged and don't get
[52:18] turned to the side and don't listen to
[52:20] the doubters. I I often I've said this a
[52:23] little bit recently. Some things have
[52:25] stirred me up on this, but my brother
[52:27] and sister, you know, people will will
[52:29] come and they'll say, you know what,
[52:31] what what you believe, what you it's
[52:33] this. And I'm thinking, I've never
[52:35] thought it was that. Well, it's this
[52:38] over here. And I've thought, no, that
[52:39] doesn't fit. And it's this like this and
[52:42] and this would be But it all boils down
[52:45] to if they want to lead you out, what
[52:48] are they leading you into?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if somebody's leading you out
[52:54] and saying what you believe is false,
[52:57] what are they leading you to? Do do they
[52:59] have greater revelation? And if they do
[53:01] have greater revelation, then God
[53:03] himself obligated himself to lead you
[53:06] into that same revelation. But my
[53:08] brother and sister, many times these
[53:10] voices, these spirits want to lead you
[53:12] out, but they're just going to take you
[53:13] into a wilderness and then abandon you.
[53:15] They're they're going to they're going
[53:16] to say, "Look what I did. I influenced
[53:18] this person. They left that deal." But
[53:20] what are they taking you into? Amen.
[53:22] I'll tell you, the word of God will draw
[53:24] you out of the world and take you into
[53:26] the presence of almighty God, fill you
[53:28] with the Holy Ghost, put the promise of
[53:30] God in you, and then manifest that
[53:32] promise into life. He'll bring it to
[53:35] life. His very word will be living in
[53:37] you.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; So,
[53:40] &gt;&gt; amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 19 is what I really wanted to draw
[53:43] out of that, but the rest was just
[53:45] really just drawing it together.
[53:48] We have also a more sure word of
[53:52] prophecy, where unto you do well that
[53:55] you take heed as into a light that
[53:57] shineth in a dark place until the day
[54:00] dawn and the day star arise in your
[54:03] heart. So the process, the stepping
[54:05] stone that God has brought each one of
[54:07] us is not to bring us out into nothing
[54:10] but to bring us as the light. Now, if we
[54:14] could somehow just totally black out the
[54:16] sanctuary today, how much light would it
[54:19] take for you to notice there was a
[54:21] light?
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Not much.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; 40,000 ft over the Amazon rainforest.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; One little light in the jungle
[54:33] &gt;&gt; from that height is absolutely a
[54:37] landmark.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. cuz it's the Amazon
[54:42] rainforest,
[54:43] middle of Brazil
[54:45] is just dark.
[54:49] And that is how little light, just one
[54:52] little light.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; There's not a giant big beam down there
[54:56] shining to the heavens to be noticed.
[54:58] Just one little light.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Exactly right. Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; And that's how powerful light is. And
[55:04] when that light shines in your heart,
[55:05] it's shining that great in the darkness.
[55:07] Amen. until the day dawn and the day
[55:10] star which is Jesus Christ arises in
[55:13] your heart. In other words, you're
[55:15] seeing a little gleam of light. But that
[55:17] light is growing. It's getting greater.
[55:19] It's coming forth to fulfill the promise
[55:21] of God that he gave to each one of us as
[55:24] sons and daughters of God. He says, you
[55:25] know what? I'm going to be the light in
[55:27] the darkness for you. And he is. Amen.
[55:31] So, a sure word, let's look at this.
[55:32] I've already touched on it, but a sure
[55:35] word of prophecy is not a guess.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; I think I might be saved. I think I
[55:42] might have the Holy Ghost. I think this
[55:44] might be truth.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Let's Let's quit our guessing. Let's
[55:48] make certain this is or this isn't.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is right or it's wrong.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; This is salvation to me
[55:57] &gt;&gt; or it's judgment to me.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly right. You see, we're not
[56:01] looking for a sensation, my brother and
[56:03] sister. Now, I want you to think, if it
[56:04] sounds like I'm being hard on churches,
[56:06] forgive me, but I'm not. But there is a
[56:08] contrast that is becoming even a greater
[56:10] contrast as we move forward in time. The
[56:14] contrast is more and more obvious.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have religion.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; And we have the word of God.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; They're not necessarily the same thing.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; No, they are. They're not necessarily
[56:28] leading to the same destination. Amen.
[56:31] But look, serving God, I'm going to tell
[56:34] you right now, it's a sensation, but
[56:36] it's not.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You get excited. There's something
[56:40] that comes with the opening of the word
[56:42] in us. As we recognize that the day star
[56:46] is rising in us, there is a sensation
[56:49] that comes on us. But we don't base our
[56:52] experience on that sensation because
[56:55] there's an evidence that we have the
[56:57] Holy Ghost. There's an evidence that the
[57:00] word is living in us.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Now, my brother and sister, you fly.
[57:04] Sorry. I I don't know why this even come
[57:06] as a comparison to me, but it's true.
[57:08] I've been there, been flying. We flew
[57:11] that high. Uh and uh because there was
[57:14] all these huge huge uh thunder uh
[57:18] clouds. I forget what they call those
[57:19] kind. at one time I looked it up but but
[57:22] they're totally flat on top
[57:24] &gt;&gt; and we are flying I'm like we're flying
[57:26] really high. We're like 40,000 over
[57:29] 40,000 ft and I'm thinking why are we
[57:31] flying so high? Then I realize if we
[57:34] weren't flying that high we would be
[57:35] flying through the storm.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; But God says you know what sometimes the
[57:40] storm in your life I'm going to take you
[57:41] above the storm. I didn't do away with
[57:44] the storm. I just elevated and lifted
[57:46] you up to a place that you could look
[57:48] down and realize I could be down there.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I got to watch the greatest
[57:54] light show I've ever saw in my life to
[57:57] watch the lightning bounce across the
[58:00] top of the clouds.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And I I don't want to exaggerate, but I
[58:05] want to tell you it seemed like there
[58:06] was 10,000 bolts of lightning all going
[58:09] different directions at the same time.
[58:12] And then all of a sudden we break out of
[58:14] the clouds and they didn't have to make
[58:16] an announcement. Everybody on the
[58:17] flight, please look out the windows to
[58:19] the right and see there's a light in the
[58:21] darkness.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; The minute we broke out of the clouds
[58:27] of unbelief,
[58:29] &gt;&gt; of sin,
[58:31] of fear, anxiety,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; we saw the light.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; We didn't need someone to say, "I think
[58:39] God is here." No.
[58:41] When you have something you're searching
[58:43] for and God opens that to your eyes, we
[58:45] suddenly realize this is not man. This
[58:48] is not psychology. This is not
[58:50] education. This is not an intellectual
[58:53] understanding. My brother and sister,
[58:55] when you are in a hard place in your
[58:56] life and God comes and deals with you,
[58:59] you know it's God.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's not a big question mark
[59:03] about maybe I read something and that's
[59:06] what I'm remembering or whatever these
[59:08] voices. Look, every one of us, let's
[59:10] just face it today, every one of us has
[59:13] voices in our head.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; They say it's not a big deal unless you
[59:17] start answering yourself.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; You have voices.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Now, our job in this day that we're
[59:25] living in is decipher what voices
[59:29] &gt;&gt; are leading you to a better life. what
[59:32] voices are leading you to what you might
[59:37] say indifference
[59:39] &gt;&gt; and what ones are directly leading you
[59:42] into a worse life. But remember the
[59:45] analogy of the conveyor
[59:48] if you're not going forward you are by
[59:51] default going backwards.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; So if someone tells you or tries to
[59:56] convince you that just just stop right
[59:59] here God's in control. cares about you.
[1:00:02] He loves you. Just just
[1:00:05] ultimately you'll find that you're going
[1:00:07] backwards.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Might not be sudden,
[1:00:11] but you see, God never called us to be
[1:00:14] unbelievers.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Never called us to be make believers. He
[1:00:19] called us to be believers.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And those other two in one form or
[1:00:23] another take us backwards. But to be a
[1:00:26] believer is leading us forward in God's
[1:00:28] word. And this is a sensation,
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; but it is not a sensation that we get a
[1:00:34] warm fuzzy feeling in our flesh and
[1:00:36] decide this is all settled. This is all
[1:00:38] finished. I don't need anymore. I've got
[1:00:40] God talking to me and everything is
[1:00:42] fine, my brother and sister. And I I'll
[1:00:44] put it this way using a phrase of this
[1:00:46] day. This message, this word of the
[1:00:49] hour, this revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:00:52] not a sensation to be clickbait. That's
[1:00:55] right.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; It is something that's very real. It's
[1:00:58] alive. It's living. Amen. It's not just
[1:01:01] something to draw your attention to do
[1:01:03] that. Otherwise, my brother and sister,
[1:01:06] we would look around. Amen. That we
[1:01:08] would say, "Oh, I felt it. What did you
[1:01:11] feel?" You might have felt the Holy
[1:01:14] Spirit. You might have felt a sensation
[1:01:15] on your flesh. How many years you going
[1:01:18] to give to that before you know the
[1:01:20] result?
[1:01:25] Now, as we read the scripture there, I
[1:01:27] just want to tell you this is a
[1:01:28] life-changing message.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz you can read down through that
[1:01:33] previous scripture
[1:01:35] cipher for yourself.
[1:01:38] I'm on gravel.
[1:01:42] I'm in the thorns.
[1:01:46] I'm caught up in the cares of life.
[1:01:48] That's a dangerous one. You bet it is.
[1:01:51] You bet it is.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; We're pursuing a better life, which is a
[1:01:53] natural instinct for us as humans to to
[1:01:56] always have something a little bit
[1:01:58] better for our family, for ourselves,
[1:02:00] and we get so caught up in that. And u
[1:02:03] my brothers and sister, I've shared this
[1:02:04] story with you here at the church. I
[1:02:06] just feel led to share it again down
[1:02:08] there preaching there in Arkansas. And
[1:02:10] uh just the Lord led me to go a certain
[1:02:12] way. And and I start talking about not
[1:02:15] all the things that we call blessings
[1:02:17] are blessings. And I lay out this whole
[1:02:20] scenario and there's a young man.
[1:02:22] There's quite a bit more room in that
[1:02:23] church between the pulpit, the platform,
[1:02:25] and the deal, but a young man sitting
[1:02:27] right here. And and I just I I don't
[1:02:30] know, you know, I'm just Paul. You guys
[1:02:31] know Paul. I'm sad that you know Paul in
[1:02:34] some ways, but anyway, I'm just Paul.
[1:02:36] And this is something led me. And I
[1:02:38] start talking about how that it would be
[1:02:40] that that uh you know, you work at a job
[1:02:43] and and they say, "Hey, we're giving you
[1:02:45] a promotion." A and um the only catch to
[1:02:48] the promotion is you now have to work on
[1:02:51] Sunday
[1:02:53] but it's substantial raise a substantial
[1:02:56] change or shift in authority but the
[1:02:58] just one little catch which is not a big
[1:03:00] deal is that you now have to work on
[1:03:02] Sunday oh and did we say that you have
[1:03:05] to also be responsible for closing the
[1:03:08] store on Wednesdays
[1:03:10] part of your responsibility
[1:03:13] but this is God blessing
[1:03:18] That young man sitting there, I couldn't
[1:03:20] read his face. Looking in hindsight, I
[1:03:23] thought, hm, he did really did have more
[1:03:26] expression than I realized. But his mama
[1:03:29] sitting with the pastor's wife and right
[1:03:31] on the same pew with Sister Jerry's over
[1:03:33] there. She's about to kick the back out
[1:03:35] of the pew in front of her, just
[1:03:36] hallelujah. Praise God. Oh, and didn't
[1:03:39] even know it was his mama. Just thought
[1:03:41] she was somebody that was excited. But I
[1:03:44] tell you what God does. That young man
[1:03:45] was sitting there. He worked for a
[1:03:47] business. That business had just made
[1:03:49] him that exact offer.
[1:03:52] Amen. Substantial raise, but you're
[1:03:55] going to have to work on Sunday. You're
[1:03:57] going to have to close on Wednesday. And
[1:03:59] he's sitting there and he had been
[1:04:00] praying, "Lord, I need an answer. This
[1:04:03] sure looks like you're blessing me with
[1:04:05] a much better job."
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And then some crazy guy comes and
[1:04:11] preaches. and he got up and walked out
[1:04:14] of church or the service is over went
[1:04:16] out called his boss and said, "I'm
[1:04:18] sorry, I can't accept the offer." And
[1:04:22] the boss asked him why and he had a
[1:04:24] courage bold and said, "Well, it's going
[1:04:27] to keep me out of the house of God."
[1:04:29] Well, is that that important for your
[1:04:31] career? And he says, "It's important for
[1:04:33] my spiritual career."
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; And my my spiritual life is is more
[1:04:40] important. And and so you look at this,
[1:04:42] my brother and sister. See, it's a
[1:04:44] life-changing message. Did Paul Paul
[1:04:47] didn't have a clue. I'd never been to
[1:04:49] that church before. I knew the pastor
[1:04:50] and his wife and the pastor's children
[1:04:53] and didn't know anyone else in there.
[1:04:55] So, you know, no insider information
[1:04:57] except for the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we ought to trust the Holy
[1:05:01] Ghost. We ought to trust it. We ought to
[1:05:02] be praying, Lord, give me leadership of
[1:05:05] the Holy Spirit that I can make the
[1:05:07] right decisions in my life. Amen. Now
[1:05:10] let's go on to 1 Corinthians 2 1-10.
[1:05:14] And brethren, when I come to you, it
[1:05:16] came not with excellency of speech or of
[1:05:19] wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony
[1:05:21] of God. For I determined not to know
[1:05:23] anything among you, save Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] and him crucified. as I was with you in
[1:05:29] weakness and in fear and with much
[1:05:32] trembling in much trembling. Uh and my
[1:05:35] speech and my preaching was not with
[1:05:37] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[1:05:40] demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:05:44] power.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That your faith
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Do we have any faith in the building
[1:05:50] today?
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; That your faith would not be in the
[1:05:55] wisdom of men.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. not something built up
[1:05:59] because we can quote the Bible, we can
[1:06:01] quote the message, we we've got such a
[1:06:03] perfect understanding, but let our
[1:06:05] faith, amen, be not in the wisdom of
[1:06:09] men, but in the power of God. Amen. My
[1:06:13] brother and sister, I tell you,
[1:06:14] sometimes people get so embraced into
[1:06:17] the leadership or ministry of their
[1:06:19] church that they quit looking for
[1:06:21] themselves and they just believe that
[1:06:23] somehow God's provided them a man uh or
[1:06:27] ministry that that is just absolutely
[1:06:30] going to be like the shortcut for them.
[1:06:32] You real computer people understand
[1:06:34] this. You know, if you know what they
[1:06:36] are, there's all kinds of shortcuts.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; but there's also a long way.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And the long way will get you everywhere
[1:06:49] the shortcut will take you.
[1:06:52] But you can guarantee the long way works
[1:06:56] every time.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Shortcuts don't always work.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Pilgrim's progress. I still remember my
[1:07:05] my all you kids up here. I just come
[1:07:08] across those pictures just made my heart
[1:07:10] melt. All the kids here and even even
[1:07:15] brother Ivan
[1:07:17] like a great big kid part of the skit.
[1:07:20] Amen. And and all the rest of you just
[1:07:23] so cute, so wonderful. And you look at
[1:07:27] that and I just remember this part and
[1:07:29] it was played out so well about that
[1:07:31] shortcut down through the swamp.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:37] All it took was a few more steps to go
[1:07:39] the right way.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; But there's always this shortcut being
[1:07:43] offered.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; and and some shortcuts I I I I even have
[1:07:49] come to use myself. Instead of looking
[1:07:50] all over the screen trying to figure out
[1:07:52] which one of those icons means print,
[1:07:54] you know, you just can pull push
[1:07:57] control P
[1:08:00] and it will print. It could just be our
[1:08:03] computer. It doesn't always work.
[1:08:06] Maybe for you it does. But you see what
[1:08:10] God wants us to do is not come into the
[1:08:13] message, the word of God for the hour,
[1:08:16] looking for shortcuts.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; There's no shortcut to getting the Holy
[1:08:20] Ghost.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; There's no shortcut for living the life.
[1:08:24] There's no shortcut to make it to
[1:08:27] heaven.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every bit of the word of God is
[1:08:31] there for a reason. It is our operator
[1:08:35] manual. Amen. So you say, "Brother Paul,
[1:08:38] where are you going on this?" Well, I
[1:08:40] want to tell you that one, I need to
[1:08:41] hurry. But two, to make us understand
[1:08:44] that the revelation of the mystery, my
[1:08:46] brother and sister, is got no shortcut.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; It's got no easy way to get around this.
[1:08:53] Now, I'm going to just speak real blunt.
[1:08:54] Some people think, "Well, you just
[1:08:56] believe God sent a prophet. There's my
[1:08:57] shortcut." I'm telling you, that isn't
[1:08:59] what the word of God says. Amen. The
[1:09:02] word of God says that we get re we
[1:09:04] repent, we get baptized, we get filled
[1:09:06] with the Holy Ghost. Then by revelation,
[1:09:08] God starts to lead us along as dear
[1:09:11] children. And he brings us through the
[1:09:13] mountains, through the valleys, the
[1:09:14] brier patch, the desert, amen, the
[1:09:17] rainforest, across the river, amen,
[1:09:19] through the fire, through the flood. He
[1:09:22] leads us through every bit of this
[1:09:24] because it's not about I found a
[1:09:26] shortcut. It's about I found the one who
[1:09:29] has guided me all the days of my life
[1:09:31] and is leading me in spirit and in
[1:09:34] truth. Leading me into a deeper
[1:09:36] relationship not with my church but with
[1:09:38] himself.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; There's what we're looking for.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] How be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:09:48] that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of
[1:09:51] this world, nor of the princes of this
[1:09:53] world that come to not, but we speak the
[1:09:55] wisdom of God in a mystery.
[1:09:58] Look, this word that has been spoken,
[1:10:00] preached by so many men through the
[1:10:03] ages, we have no problem looking back
[1:10:05] and looking at Luther and looking at
[1:10:07] Wesley and going through the ages and
[1:10:10] looking and see where each man we have
[1:10:11] no problem. But I want to ask you, where
[1:10:13] is it today? Where is the word being
[1:10:16] spoken today? We can't go back and live
[1:10:19] on Luther's message. We can't go back
[1:10:21] and live on Wesley's message because we
[1:10:24] can't go back and duplicate the
[1:10:26] atmosphere that that seed was planted
[1:10:28] in. Amen. It might be good soil, but my
[1:10:31] brother and sister, we weren't called to
[1:10:33] that day or you would have been there.
[1:10:35] Amen. We were called to this day. This
[1:10:37] is the hour God wants you. He's planted
[1:10:40] you. And amen, it will take the word for
[1:10:42] its full value. He didn't plant you in
[1:10:45] the brier patch. He didn't plant you in
[1:10:47] the gravel patch. He didn't plant you
[1:10:49] out here to be caught up in the cares of
[1:10:51] life. He planted you in good soil so
[1:10:54] that you could take a hold of the word
[1:10:56] and say, "You know what? I recognize
[1:10:58] there is something happening in me." And
[1:11:00] I'm not looking at this over here to
[1:11:02] judge them. I'm not looking at over here
[1:11:05] to compare myself to them. But what I do
[1:11:07] recognize, I'm planted in good soil. I'm
[1:11:11] planted in the real word of God. good
[1:11:13] soil and I'm growing.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we nec need to
[1:11:18] recognize, not comparing it. Now, I use
[1:11:20] a a a farmer analogy, but my brother and
[1:11:24] sister, there's sometimes maybe you turn
[1:11:26] around too much on the headland of the
[1:11:27] field, and you've kind of packed the
[1:11:29] soil, and that field will come right
[1:11:31] down there, get up close to the ditch,
[1:11:33] and that corn just gets shorter and
[1:11:35] shorter and shorter.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; That's bad corn.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; No. bad environment.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly right.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; It's packed so tight,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; you can't put a shovel in the ground.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Packed so tight, the water doesn't want
[1:11:53] to soak in.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; It just wants to float over us like
[1:11:57] water on a duck's back.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe the message.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; But is it soaking in?
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; See, for it to grow, you to grow, it's
[1:12:07] got to soak in.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The water of the word's got to
[1:12:11] soak in. The seed is there. The soil has
[1:12:14] everything it needs to be. You probe it
[1:12:16] right there and send it away to the lab
[1:12:18] for a soil test and it'll tell you it
[1:12:19] has the right amount of nitrogen,
[1:12:21] magnes, and all of these things in it.
[1:12:23] It's all right. But the atmosphere has
[1:12:25] got too stiff and formal.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:34] But we speak the wisdom of God in a
[1:12:36] mystery, even the hidden wisdom which
[1:12:38] God ordained before the world unto our
[1:12:41] glory.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Look how far back God was planning the
[1:12:45] word to come to you.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Which none of the princes of this world
[1:12:52] knew. For had they known it, they would
[1:12:55] have would not have crucified the Lord
[1:12:59] of glory.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You imagine even in that day those
[1:13:02] men if they had realized exactly what
[1:13:06] they were doing. This is the Messiah.
[1:13:10] This is God that we've been looking for.
[1:13:15] They would have fell down and repented
[1:13:17] for their hard hearts.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Or would they?
[1:13:25] You got to understand there is that
[1:13:26] little contradiction in a sense. I use
[1:13:29] the word contradiction as in contrast.
[1:13:31] Maybe that's a better word.
[1:13:34] If it wasn't in their heart to believe,
[1:13:36] you could not provide them with
[1:13:38] sufficient evidence to convince them
[1:13:42] otherwise. Jesus said, "Look, if you
[1:13:44] don't believe I am he, then believe for
[1:13:47] the works that I do."
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Just believe the works.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to acknowledge me,
[1:13:53] just believe the works. But the works
[1:13:55] speak of me.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; But did they?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; That's the harsh reality of it, my
[1:14:03] brother and sister.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Look, we can fill a church clear full of
[1:14:07] people if you just preach everybody's
[1:14:09] going to heaven.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Grace Tabernacle would already be
[1:14:15] building out on the outskirts of Nampa,
[1:14:17] a much larger church if you just give
[1:14:22] assurance to everyone that no matter how
[1:14:25] you live or where you're planted,
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; you're going to heaven.
[1:14:30] I've shared with the church, hope you
[1:14:33] don't mind sharing this. I did Sister
[1:14:36] Audrey's funeral
[1:14:39] there in Dacon Chapel in Caldwell and
[1:14:43] got all done. The man who runs the the
[1:14:46] the Dacon funeral home, he called me in
[1:14:49] his office and says, "Uh, Paul,
[1:14:52] that was that was just a fantastic
[1:14:55] funeral. I don't know how many of you
[1:14:57] were there, Sister Audrey's funeral, but
[1:15:00] um fantastic funeral. That's so
[1:15:03] incredible. Look, we're going to have an
[1:15:05] opening
[1:15:08] the minister that that in-house minister
[1:15:11] who does funerals here for people who
[1:15:14] are unchurched or you know whatever
[1:15:16] their circumstance and I want to offer
[1:15:18] you the job. Now, this been a lot of
[1:15:21] years ago, so the money might not
[1:15:22] impress you now, but he was like, "Uh,
[1:15:25] we do uh you would do three to four
[1:15:28] services a week,
[1:15:31] and we pay a minimum of $500." My
[1:15:35] brain's like, "2,000 a week? Four weeks
[1:15:39] in a month?
[1:15:41] That's about four times as much money as
[1:15:43] I make right now."
[1:15:47] He says, "Cuz I just couldn't believe
[1:15:48] how you presented that for this lady."
[1:15:54] You ever have the Lord just come on the
[1:15:56] scene and speak to you just almost
[1:15:57] immediately?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; I was like, "Lord,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; sounds like that would be sorry for the
[1:16:03] phrase of the day. That'd be a good
[1:16:04] gig."
[1:16:10] He says, "I I just love how you
[1:16:11] presented her the change you saw in her
[1:16:14] life and how as a daughter of God and
[1:16:18] the little light turned on.
[1:16:21] How are you going to send a lion
[1:16:24] cheating drunk
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; to heaven?
[1:16:31] And I told him, "Sir, in all respect,
[1:16:34] the reason I could say the words I said
[1:16:37] over Sister Audrey is because they're
[1:16:40] all true."
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, we're
[1:16:46] not here just to speak vain words.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; We're here to speak truth.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; And then after the fact, I hope you
[1:16:56] don't mind a little humor. And I
[1:16:57] thought, you know, after a while it'd be
[1:16:59] pretty boring preaching four funerals a
[1:17:01] week. I mean, depressing. Depressing.
[1:17:05] You'd almost want to just have a
[1:17:06] pre-recorded thing and just say, "Huh?
[1:17:21] Yeah.
[1:17:22] Yeah.
[1:17:24] Some of you got that.
[1:17:29] Yep.
[1:17:31] Will that work?
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Will that send them where they need to
[1:17:34] go?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Where they're going to go?
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; No, my brother and sister. It takes a
[1:17:40] wisdom that is the wisdom of God in a
[1:17:43] mystery. Amen. Which God orained before
[1:17:47] the world and to our glory.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know. But as it is
[1:17:53] written, verse nine, I hath not seen,
[1:17:56] nor ear heard, neither have entered into
[1:17:58] the hearts of man the things which God
[1:17:59] hath prepared for them that love him. I
[1:18:02] just like to ask you this morning,
[1:18:03] anybody here love the Lord?
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has prepared the mystery of
[1:18:08] God. He's prepared his word and he's
[1:18:10] prepared the final result for us.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we're in love with him.
[1:18:16] And it wasn't because we're some super
[1:18:17] spiritual people, but we love him
[1:18:19] because he first loved us. And we
[1:18:22] recognize the depth of that love that he
[1:18:24] would save our soul from hell and keep
[1:18:28] us and let us live a wonderful life here
[1:18:31] on the earth while we serve him. I've
[1:18:33] had people tell me, "Man, being a
[1:18:35] Christian must be so boring. You don't
[1:18:37] get to do nothing." And I thought, "You
[1:18:38] don't have a clue what you what you were
[1:18:41] saying. You're out there. Oh, we got
[1:18:43] drunk. Wasn't it fun? Oh, we did this.
[1:18:46] Wasn't it fun? Oh, we did that. Wasn't
[1:18:48] it fun? But I tell you, my brother and
[1:18:50] sister, every morning, noon, and night,
[1:18:52] in spite of all the contradiction and
[1:18:55] the distress and everything of life,
[1:18:58] anxieties and whatever that comes our
[1:19:00] way. I know none of you ever have
[1:19:02] tribulation in your life. But when
[1:19:04] tribulation that we can get up and say,
[1:19:06] "It was good to serve God. It was good
[1:19:10] to walk in the way that the Lord has
[1:19:12] called me. It is good." Amen. If we have
[1:19:15] a hangover, it's because the Lord has
[1:19:17] anointed us. And we get up the next day
[1:19:20] and that atmosphere is still with us.
[1:19:22] We're still walking in the presence of
[1:19:24] the word and the life that is there is
[1:19:27] still with us and we're remembering this
[1:19:29] is a lifechanging message. Amen. And the
[1:19:33] mystery. Oh my. We're going to get to
[1:19:34] the mystery. It's too deep for you guys.
[1:19:37] A few more years of preaching, you'll
[1:19:39] start to understand the mystery. We got
[1:19:41] to dig deeper to get to the mystery. my
[1:19:43] brother and sister, the way up is down
[1:19:46] and the way down is up. My brother and
[1:19:48] sister, to realize we're looking at the
[1:19:50] mystery as some great thing. But the
[1:19:52] problem is everywhere there's a mystery,
[1:19:55] people are trying to preach a shortcut.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no such thing as a
[1:20:00] shortcut.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 10. But God hath revealed
[1:20:04] them unto us by his spirit.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; For the spirit searchth all things, yay,
[1:20:10] the deep things of God.
[1:20:13] Look, the opening of the word.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I I love this. I I love what God did in
[1:20:19] my own life, my own testimony, my own
[1:20:21] witness that God started many years ago
[1:20:23] when I did not deserve to have him treat
[1:20:26] me so kind. But he started and he
[1:20:28] started just laying things in. And so
[1:20:30] the opening of the word, my brother and
[1:20:32] sister, is not meant to be a show.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; It's not meant for us to be able to say,
[1:20:36] "Our church has the opening of the word.
[1:20:39] Oh, this man revelated. Oh, this is a
[1:20:42] it's not a show, my brother and sister.
[1:20:44] Neither in Jesus day was it a show, and
[1:20:47] neither in this day is it to be a show.
[1:20:50] God works and people see.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; But it's not a show. Amen. It's meant to
[1:20:55] be personal,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we talk about personal?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; You know what personal is?
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's when it is so real. Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; That you and you alone can hang your
[1:21:08] life on that. I can't hang my life on
[1:21:11] your experience. And you don't want to
[1:21:13] hang your life on my experience. It
[1:21:16] becomes a personal experience that you
[1:21:20] can declare, I have met Jesus Christ
[1:21:23] face to face. I may have met him on a
[1:21:25] mountaintop. I may have met him in the
[1:21:27] valley. I may have met him in a mud pit,
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; but I still met him.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; And you can't tell me any difference.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look at this. I want you to
[1:21:40] catch this. The lamb
[1:21:43] comes down and takes the book.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Now the word says that there was no one
[1:21:49] worthy.
[1:21:51] John wept.
[1:21:53] You imagine how he felt when he looks
[1:21:55] out here and realize there's no one
[1:21:56] worthy to take the book.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; And John weeps.
[1:22:01] But yet there's a voice says, "Hey, weep
[1:22:03] not, John,
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; for one has come to take the book."
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And the lamb comes down and takes the
[1:22:11] book
[1:22:15] and he climbs back to the throne with
[1:22:18] the book.
[1:22:20] No one was worthy to loose the seals.
[1:22:24] So the lamb himself
[1:22:27] starts breaking open the seals of this
[1:22:29] book.
[1:22:31] Seven seals on that book.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; He looses the seals and the mysteries.
[1:22:38] Look, John is sitting here witnessing
[1:22:39] this in real time.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; This not a podcast.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; This not a unwind this and watch it
[1:22:45] again thing.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; John's watching this or experiencing
[1:22:49] this in real time.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; And as the lamb starts to break or
[1:22:54] loosen the seals, John starts to see all
[1:22:57] these things unfolding before him. But
[1:22:59] many of these he does not understand.
[1:23:01] Many of this is uh too deep for John to
[1:23:04] uh to comprehend. And so as the seals
[1:23:07] are being loosed, the mysteries are
[1:23:09] being unfolded.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; They're they're coming out. They're
[1:23:14] there. And we're not here to go ahead
[1:23:15] and preach on that today. But when the
[1:23:18] mysteries are unfolded, we'll see seven
[1:23:20] ages, my brother and sister. And there
[1:23:22] were names that were revealed or called
[1:23:25] out in every one of those seals. Called
[1:23:28] out names. There was a loosing of the
[1:23:31] names that was there. And there were
[1:23:33] people in every one of those church ages
[1:23:35] that started to say, "Man, I I don't
[1:23:37] know what's come over me, but I I just
[1:23:39] got to serve God. I'm going to serve
[1:23:41] God. I believe this. I see this." And
[1:23:44] I'll just throw one little thing into
[1:23:45] you so you'll know firsthand how
[1:23:47] miraculous God is. And there in the
[1:23:50] village of Chievac was a a elder amongst
[1:23:53] them, Chupek uh Eskimos. And and it was
[1:23:56] there and God had had the word witness
[1:23:58] to this man, but he had a heart attack.
[1:24:00] And they flew him out of there into uh
[1:24:03] Bethl, Alaska in a medevac. And and so
[1:24:06] he's there uh you know, he had kind of
[1:24:09] pushed back about, well, I don't know.
[1:24:10] This is so complicated. This stuff
[1:24:12] you're sharing with me out of scripture
[1:24:14] is so complicated. the loosing of the
[1:24:16] seals, my brother and sister. It can
[1:24:18] look so complicating, but he's there and
[1:24:21] and uh he's like, I I just don't know. I
[1:24:23] don't know. And you know, the uh um
[1:24:26] Maruvian movement, and not much
[1:24:28] different in a lot of ways from
[1:24:30] Catholicism, but the Maruvian movement
[1:24:32] right there, you know, they do their
[1:24:34] best, my brother and sister, when I say
[1:24:35] best to keep you in church, they'll
[1:24:37] intimidate you.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; They will bring every bit of pressure to
[1:24:40] bear they can to keep you in the church.
[1:24:44] And just in case any of you wonder, I'm
[1:24:45] just kind of the opposite.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; If God can't move you to church, how's
[1:24:51] Paul going to move you to church?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; If God can't cause you to worship,
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; to pray, read your Bible,
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; how can I do that?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want you to think I'm
[1:25:02] indifferent.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I care very much and I pray for you very
[1:25:06] much, but there's no moving you if God
[1:25:08] can't move you.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. He's in the hospital in
[1:25:14] Bethl, Alaska. ICU, major heart attack.
[1:25:20] I believe it was the second night he's
[1:25:22] there.
[1:25:24] In the middle of the night,
[1:25:27] he says, "I don't know if I was awake or
[1:25:29] asleep.
[1:25:32] I just started seeing all of this take
[1:25:34] place.
[1:25:37] It's unfolding before me."
[1:25:40] Now you got to understand there was no
[1:25:43] church age book in the Chupic language.
[1:25:46] He'd never read it.
[1:25:49] It's unfolding before him.
[1:25:53] At first light,
[1:25:55] he gets out of bed. This man's had a
[1:25:57] major heart attack.
[1:25:59] puts on his clothes, walks out of the
[1:26:01] hospital, goes down to a a nephew's
[1:26:05] house there in Bethl and says, "I need
[1:26:08] to borrow a snow machine." And they're
[1:26:10] like, "What are you doing?" He said,
[1:26:11] "I'm going home." It's like, "Well, you
[1:26:13] could wait till this afternoon and take
[1:26:14] a flight." He goes, "That isn't what I
[1:26:17] saw. I saw me
[1:26:21] taking a journey."
[1:26:23] Gets on a snowmobile. It's a long ride
[1:26:26] across the middle of nothing and
[1:26:28] nowhere.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; He gets back to the village, shocks
[1:26:32] everybody. You're here, but the plane
[1:26:34] hasn't come yet.
[1:26:36] Cuz it stormed and the plane didn't fly
[1:26:38] at all.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And he goes to brother Andrew and he
[1:26:44] says, "Something's happened and I
[1:26:46] believe you can interpret this."
[1:26:49] And he says, "Well, I'll do my best.
[1:26:50] We'll pray and God will answer." A man
[1:26:53] who could not read English,
[1:26:57] didn't speak English,
[1:27:02] never read a word,
[1:27:05] starts in sharing what he saw. And
[1:27:07] brother Andrew says, "Stop." Goes and
[1:27:09] gets the book
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; and says, "Start again at the
[1:27:14] beginning."
[1:27:16] There it is.
[1:27:20] There it is.
[1:27:23] See, as a seed or a son of God, God
[1:27:25] wanted to make that so real to him. He
[1:27:28] unfolds it all in a vision to him. It
[1:27:31] plays before him just like it was pan
[1:27:34] vision
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; and just unfolds before him.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how serious God is about
[1:27:41] saving sons and daughters of God.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And some people say, "I just don't
[1:27:46] see how that could be. I don't." Well,
[1:27:48] I'm telling you this very same thing
[1:27:50] that John saw here. There's nothing
[1:27:52] hindering God from doing the same thing
[1:27:54] to you.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; With you, for you.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; So, it's there. It starts to reveal
[1:28:00] that. Now, look what it is, my brother
[1:28:02] and sister. He brought it to earth and
[1:28:04] he revealed this in a prophetic message
[1:28:06] to John. But the whole mystery is not
[1:28:10] revealed in John. John doesn't have an
[1:28:13] answer to everything. John shares what
[1:28:15] God gave him in that day, in that eye,
[1:28:18] and opened his eyes to see. And then he
[1:28:21] comes and tells him, "Eat the book."
[1:28:24] Now, I want you to realize, my brother
[1:28:25] and sister, we're not exempt. You got to
[1:28:27] eat the book. If you expect to see God
[1:28:29] move in your life, you've got to eat the
[1:28:32] book. Amen. And the results are not
[1:28:34] always pleasurable because he says that
[1:28:37] that he ate the book and it was bitter
[1:28:39] in his belly. And the bitterness was not
[1:28:41] because what he ate was not true. It was
[1:28:44] because it called his body, his life to
[1:28:47] a transformation from who he was to what
[1:28:50] God was calling him to be. And there's
[1:28:52] the bitterness between our flesh and
[1:28:54] what the word of God is. It comes to a
[1:28:57] place we place hard decisions. We come
[1:28:59] to that and we must face those and we do
[1:29:02] that and it becomes hard.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] And some when their life got too busy
[1:29:09] and complicated fell away.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Because this is too hard.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; But for those that are in good soil.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at this. I need to hurry
[1:29:20] along. Revelations 10 7-9.
[1:29:24] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:29:26] seventh angel when he began to sound,
[1:29:28] the mystery of God should be finished as
[1:29:30] he had declared to his servants of
[1:29:32] prophets. And the voice which I heard
[1:29:34] from heaven spake unto me again, and
[1:29:36] said, "Go and take the little book which
[1:29:38] is open in the hand of the angel, which
[1:29:40] standeth upon the sea, and upon the
[1:29:41] earth." And I went into the angel, and I
[1:29:43] said unto him, "Give me the little
[1:29:45] book." And he said unto me, "Take it,
[1:29:47] and eat it up, and it shall make thy
[1:29:49] belly bitter, but it shall be in thy
[1:29:51] mouth sweet as honey." I'm telling you,
[1:29:54] my brother and sister, this commandment
[1:29:55] is still living today. You got to take
[1:29:58] the book and you got to just plan on I'm
[1:30:00] going to eat it and it's going to cause
[1:30:02] my life to change. It's going to come to
[1:30:04] where I know that I've got to change.
[1:30:07] And sometimes change can be so hard.
[1:30:10] Sometimes being brought face to face in
[1:30:12] reality is so hard. But when it's sweet
[1:30:16] in your mouth, you've got to go back.
[1:30:18] Anybody got a sweet tooth?
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who doesn't have a sweet tooth is
[1:30:22] more like it. I think brother Adam
[1:30:24] doesn't have a sweet tooth. But anyway,
[1:30:27] he's always telling me, "Why are you
[1:30:28] eating that?" And I'm like, "Cuz it
[1:30:29] tastes good. Take the sugar out and tell
[1:30:31] me what it tastes like." But I'm telling
[1:30:34] you, my brother and sister, it's so
[1:30:35] sweet in the mouth.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Son of God has to go back and take
[1:30:40] another bite of the book.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; And it says, "Maybe you need to repent."
[1:30:45] And we stop and go, "Oh,
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I've had this grudge against this person
[1:30:50] for 25 years. What do you mean I got to
[1:30:52] get rid of it?
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:30:55] Oh,
[1:30:56] lust of the flesh. Oh, but it brings me
[1:30:59] such.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; What is it? Let it go.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Let it go.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Let it go.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Keep eating the book.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Keep eating the book. Oh, I don't like
[1:31:13] going to church. It upsets me.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Well, you ought to thank God it upset
[1:31:18] you.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because I tell you, if it
[1:31:20] didn't bother you at all,
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; it would be a sign
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; that you're
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; of the other.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And we weren't called
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; to be them. That's right.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; We were called to be us.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; You want the mystery to be revealed?
[1:31:36] Anybody like to hear?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; The mystery.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is such a deep subject today.
[1:31:42] You guys will know that we're just
[1:31:43] dredging so deep. Eat the book.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Right. You don't need a preacher to
[1:31:48] preach the revealed message to you. You
[1:31:50] eat the book and God will preach the
[1:31:53] revealed message to you. Now, let me
[1:31:57] clarify that
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; God will take a preacher and he will
[1:32:02] preach the words, but if it's not coming
[1:32:05] out of the book to you,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; The preacher is just so much garble in
[1:32:11] the background. But when something's
[1:32:13] real in your heart,
[1:32:16] something's living in your heart and you
[1:32:18] hear the word preached,
[1:32:20] something takes place.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; You see this mystery, my brother and
[1:32:25] sister, we could get up here, and this
[1:32:27] was an interesting thought to me cuz I I
[1:32:30] just saw a little deal that that
[1:32:32] stimulated me along this line. And um so
[1:32:36] this man, he's actually a very good
[1:32:37] Pentecostal preacher, good, solid guy.
[1:32:40] wouldn't be surprised to see him in
[1:32:42] heaven. He He isn't preaching some
[1:32:44] theology of a certain way. He just
[1:32:47] breaks the Bible down. And um let's just
[1:32:50] say I I think I'm pretty sure I know
[1:32:52] where he gets his research from.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But I want you to see what this is like.
[1:32:58] He starts Well, we'll just use this. He
[1:33:00] starts over here. He's got a few
[1:33:02] scriptures. Then he's got a few
[1:33:05] scriptures. And he's got some
[1:33:06] scriptures. And then he's got a deal in
[1:33:08] the center. And it starts to do and then
[1:33:10] he says he he goes he goes you know you
[1:33:11] see this ties to this scripture which
[1:33:14] comes back and clarifies this and then
[1:33:16] this does and this comes and after 15
[1:33:19] minutes there's so many scribbles on
[1:33:20] that board
[1:33:22] you can't follow it.
[1:33:34] Bible's too complicated.
[1:33:39] What is the simplicity?
[1:33:41] God started
[1:33:45] and then he added
[1:33:47] and then he added. You can follow it
[1:33:50] when it's that way, can't you? And he
[1:33:53] added, and he added, and he added, and
[1:33:56] he added, and he added, and he added,
[1:33:58] and he added
[1:34:00] to someone who doesn't know,
[1:34:03] it looks like a complicated mess.
[1:34:06] to somebody who's been eating the book.
[1:34:10] That's no longer a mystery.
[1:34:12] You can follow every line, every
[1:34:16] scripture, and specifically every end
[1:34:20] result
[1:34:22] because you watched it happen.
[1:34:26] You watched it come to pass.
[1:34:30] Not in somebody else. I'm talking about
[1:34:32] you.
[1:34:34] You got to see God working in you.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And what someone else says is a
[1:34:39] complicated mess is the word being
[1:34:42] revealed to you.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; See, it's not a something we teach. Now
[1:34:47] there are components of the scripture
[1:34:50] that that are taught and we gain
[1:34:52] understanding but my brother and sister
[1:34:54] without foundation without let me use
[1:34:56] this example it's man without his
[1:34:58] original scriptures which included
[1:35:01] revelations 10:7
[1:35:05] you have to have somewhere you start
[1:35:06] building from
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; and as this takes place you start to see
[1:35:11] it and suddenly it's no longer just a
[1:35:13] bunch of scribbles on a page it suddenly
[1:35:15] is like this was me.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And then this was me.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; And then this was the more mature me.
[1:35:23] And this is the more revelated me. And
[1:35:25] this is the me when I understood who I
[1:35:28] was in the kingdom of God. And then this
[1:35:30] is me when God started dealing with me
[1:35:33] personally.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; And this is me when the word opened up
[1:35:38] in my presence.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Suddenly the mystery is not so
[1:35:42] mysterious.
[1:35:44] But if we just sat down and we look at
[1:35:47] it as, "Oh, there's a mystery."
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; As a minister, and I don't make light of
[1:35:53] this, but I guess I do. You can sit here
[1:35:55] and go, "Oo,
[1:35:59] but that's not what it's about. It's God
[1:36:02] proving to you." Now, let me move
[1:36:05] forward here. I got to keep going.
[1:36:08] What is a vision?
[1:36:11] Now look at this here. And then when it
[1:36:14] did, this one that was standing by me,
[1:36:16] behind me, the same voice, the angel's
[1:36:18] voice said, "I'll meet you in there."
[1:36:20] And this is the third pull. Amen. And we
[1:36:23] could sum the third pull for those of
[1:36:25] you who wouldn't necessarily know. We
[1:36:26] can sum the third pull in a very
[1:36:28] simplistic fashion. Amen. God with us.
[1:36:33] God
[1:36:36] God above us. God with us. God in us.
[1:36:38] I'm getting myself confused here. So God
[1:36:41] above us, God with us, God in us.
[1:36:44] There's the three poles coming out.
[1:36:46] That's very simplistic. This third poll,
[1:36:49] but nobody will know nothing about it.
[1:36:51] And I said, well, I don't understand why
[1:36:52] in there. Why there? He said, it will
[1:36:56] not be a public show.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; So what is this? We're going to have
[1:37:01] mystery seminars. We're going to have
[1:37:03] revelation seminars. We're going to have
[1:37:05] these kind of things that where the
[1:37:07] world's heading today. We're going to
[1:37:08] gather everybody and we're going to
[1:37:10] teach you about the Holy Ghost. Well,
[1:37:13] why don't we teach the word, let the
[1:37:16] Holy Ghost come down and teach them what
[1:37:18] the Holy Ghost is about.
[1:37:21] Intellectualism won't save us.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; So, having a good teacher, my brother
[1:37:26] and sister, you know, I've told this
[1:37:28] story in the church before, high school.
[1:37:31] There was a girl named Vicki in our
[1:37:33] class. Really nice girl, really cute.
[1:37:35] Everybody liked her. Uh, and uh, and
[1:37:38] we're in algebra 1 and Vickiy's
[1:37:41] constantly telling the teacher, "I don't
[1:37:43] understand. I don't understand. I don't
[1:37:47] understand." Now, you have to understand
[1:37:48] that Vicki, you know, the school I went
[1:37:51] to, actually, you could get more than a
[1:37:53] 4.0. I don't know if schools do that
[1:37:55] very much, but you know, if you turned
[1:37:58] everything in time and and it was
[1:37:59] perfect and this and that and you know,
[1:38:01] whatever they allowed him. I know that
[1:38:03] that Vicki had a 4 point something above
[1:38:05] the mark and everybody's like found
[1:38:09] something Vicki can't do. A lot of
[1:38:12] people were like,
[1:38:14] "Yeah, we found Vickiy's weak spot here.
[1:38:17] She can't do algebra." And she just kept
[1:38:20] saying, "Now, teacher, explain this to
[1:38:21] me. I don't I don't get this." But the
[1:38:24] second half of the year went to algebra,
[1:38:26] too. And Vickiy's just turning out the
[1:38:29] papers and the rest of the class is
[1:38:30] going, "Teacher, explain this to us."
[1:38:33] Because you see, she caught the
[1:38:35] principle of it all,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; We all took a shortcut.
[1:38:41] I got embarrassed. I got shamed
[1:38:43] drastically in class one day. Teacher
[1:38:45] didn't intend to do it. The teacher
[1:38:48] said, "Paul, on this test, you got the
[1:38:51] right answer.
[1:38:54] I want you to write how you did this on
[1:38:57] the board for the rest of the class.
[1:39:01] And I was like, why?
[1:39:04] She said, cuz I actually am baffled how
[1:39:07] you got the right answer.
[1:39:11] And so I had, she let me have the paper
[1:39:13] and I'm up there and I put it on the
[1:39:16] board and I draw this all out. This
[1:39:19] pretty complicated deal. and I I come
[1:39:22] over here and I come up with the right
[1:39:24] answer
[1:39:25] and the teacher just stood wasted the
[1:39:27] whole rest of the class just stood there
[1:39:28] and goes
[1:39:31] I don't see how
[1:39:34] well just follow the logic and she says
[1:39:38] there is no logic
[1:39:41] I've got another one for you do this one
[1:39:46] and I looked at that and I thought
[1:39:49] that might have been luck
[1:39:52] I told her, "I'm not I'm not doing
[1:39:54] anymore." She says that she said,
[1:39:56] "That's fine because I think I've
[1:39:57] already figured out the way you got the
[1:39:59] answer and you can't duplicate it." My
[1:40:03] brother and sister, I want an answer for
[1:40:06] you in your experience with God that can
[1:40:09] be duplicated day after day after day,
[1:40:14] circumstance after circumstance after
[1:40:16] circumstance. don't want you to come
[1:40:18] down the road in your life and have a
[1:40:21] failure because it just doesn't work.
[1:40:26] God's got a tried and trueue and proven
[1:40:28] program.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; And it's not for us to sit around and
[1:40:32] try and look at the mystery. The mystery
[1:40:34] is Christ in you. Amen.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. Are there other
[1:40:38] things that we see that God reveals? We
[1:40:41] look at these things. Yes, they are. But
[1:40:42] I want you to understand the real
[1:40:44] mystery that matters starts with Christ
[1:40:46] in us.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're not at that point, you
[1:40:50] won't be able to duplicate it on the
[1:40:52] chalkboard for the rest of the class.
[1:40:55] But we have to come to the place by
[1:40:57] grace of God in sickness and in health,
[1:41:00] in good times, in bad times, whatever it
[1:41:03] might be, we need to be able to
[1:41:05] duplicate the word in our life again and
[1:41:09] again and again. This, let me put it
[1:41:11] this way, is not a fad religion.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; This is life.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; This is what will carry us all the days
[1:41:21] we've had. you know, uh, our our
[1:41:27] brother Bob, sister Joanne, I get a
[1:41:29] little emotional about this, but
[1:41:32] my own mama
[1:41:36] all these years,
[1:41:40] not a lot of flash,
[1:41:42] not a big to-do, no headlines. They just
[1:41:46] lived
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; the gospel
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; day after day after day. Imagine
[1:41:54] God could give you the opportunity to
[1:41:56] live the gospel longer than most people
[1:42:01] even live.
[1:42:03] You think that was an accident? No, sir.
[1:42:05] That's an enduring power, a revelation
[1:42:08] of the mystery of Christ in them.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. And we have that same
[1:42:13] gospel, that same message, that same
[1:42:15] word is in you and I today that no
[1:42:18] matter whether the sun shines or it
[1:42:20] doesn't, whether the economy collapses
[1:42:21] or it doesn't, it doesn't matter what it
[1:42:24] is, the mystery is being revealed in you
[1:42:26] and I. And that is Christ himself.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look at this. Let me get
[1:42:32] focused. It will not be a public show
[1:42:34] this time. I don't understand going in
[1:42:37] that closet like that. And he said, "Is
[1:42:39] it not written by our Lord, when thou
[1:42:41] prayest, be not like the hypocrites who
[1:42:43] like to be heard before men, but enter
[1:42:46] into the secret closet?"
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; And pray to the Father who seeth in
[1:42:52] secret, and who seeth in secret shall
[1:42:54] reward thee openly. It's perfectly to
[1:42:57] the scripture every time.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; There's a great mystery, my brother and
[1:43:02] sister, opened up right here in a few
[1:43:04] short lines of what is taking place. You
[1:43:07] realize now I speak this to people that
[1:43:09] are established. You look at this. Some
[1:43:11] people still think there's got to be a a
[1:43:13] tent and still got to be a little room
[1:43:15] and still got to be this and got to be
[1:43:16] that. But right here before our eyes is
[1:43:19] a mystery revealed. Amen. Unfolded right
[1:43:23] out of the word while people we're
[1:43:25] looking for that day. We're waiting for
[1:43:26] that day. And that day is taking place
[1:43:29] right now in your life, in your prayer
[1:43:32] life, in your eating of the book. Amen.
[1:43:35] And sometimes, come on, let's be honest.
[1:43:37] It's bitter in our belly when we realize
[1:43:39] I have been totally wrong and I I just,
[1:43:42] oh, how could I been so wrong? You know,
[1:43:45] why my behavior? Why this? Why that? But
[1:43:50] it's so sweet in our mouth. We have to
[1:43:53] go back for another bite.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; And then God says, "This is how I'm
[1:43:59] changing you." Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Day by day.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Just keep eating. Amen.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; The book sir,
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; it will change you.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's right.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. I want to ask, can I redeem that
[1:44:13] 15 minutes brother David was talking
[1:44:15] about?
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. See, not a not a public show.
[1:44:21] This is something that's taking place in
[1:44:23] the secret chamber of your heart.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; It's not a public show.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Now, look, while it's not a public show,
[1:44:30] it's got to be on display.
[1:44:32] We can't go hide this. Do we hide it
[1:44:34] under a bushel?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; No, we can't. Always love that song,
[1:44:38] especially when it's little kids singing
[1:44:40] it, you know. Amen. See, it's not a
[1:44:43] stunning news item. It's not. Don't you
[1:44:46] just love this, you know? Uh, sorry to
[1:44:48] even bring up YouTube on in church, but
[1:44:50] you look at this, you know, and there's
[1:44:52] headlines on YouTube, you know. I just
[1:44:54] saw one the other day. Oh, the Lord told
[1:44:58] me this, the end of the world, you know,
[1:45:01] and in one week it has like 18,000
[1:45:03] people who've clicked on it.
[1:45:08] And then they get up there and they
[1:45:09] start talking Babel that doesn't even
[1:45:11] line up with the word of God. You know
[1:45:13] what that's called? That's why I used
[1:45:14] the word earlier. Clickbait.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; They're getting their little check from
[1:45:18] YouTube
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; and that's all they cared about.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; They don't care if they're telling you
[1:45:22] truth. They don't care if they're
[1:45:23] helping you in eternal life. They're
[1:45:25] getting a paycheck. They're called
[1:45:27] hirlings.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; And they they're starting to say, "Well,
[1:45:30] the Lord told me." And I'm thinking,
[1:45:31] "My, the Lord talks to them lip to ear."
[1:45:34] Oh, wait. They got even better. They're
[1:45:36] now telling the Lord what they're going
[1:45:38] to do.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. The last I
[1:45:42] checked, it's me listening to God, not
[1:45:44] God listening to me in the determining
[1:45:47] where the world is going. Amen. What is
[1:45:49] happening tomorrow? What is this? What
[1:45:51] is that? God didn't come down and say,
[1:45:52] "Paul, what do you think I ought to do
[1:45:53] tomorrow?"
[1:45:54] No. What he does is says, "Paul,
[1:45:56] whatever happens tomorrow, I'm with you.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; I'm in you.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; I will lead you. I will guide you. I
[1:46:02] will take that." My brother and sister,
[1:46:04] there's a great mystery right there. If
[1:46:05] you want to get down into the deep
[1:46:07] thing, to be guided by the Lord every
[1:46:09] single day of your life is a great
[1:46:11] mystery because we as humans are human.
[1:46:14] Amen. And we act like human and we think
[1:46:17] like human and we do like human. And God
[1:46:19] says, "I'm going to change you to where
[1:46:21] you will follow me." Amen.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; You will hear my voice
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; because you are my sheep.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, do you think maybe we should
[1:46:31] change our website and we should change
[1:46:32] our thing to have some more like big God
[1:46:36] came to church with us today?
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Well, it's true, isn't it?
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where two or three are gathered in
[1:46:45] my name, I'll be there. So, I could
[1:46:47] stand up here and put a big highlight on
[1:46:49] that. God came to church with us today.
[1:46:53] But is that necessary? No sir. Because
[1:46:55] as believers, we know where two or three
[1:46:57] are gathered in his name, he is present.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; We don't have to put some big headline
[1:47:04] to make it mysterious.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, you look at this. I I I I
[1:47:10] have to admit I I listened to this the
[1:47:12] other day, a little video clip,
[1:47:15] man-made. It was 18 minutes
[1:47:18] on how to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:22] I wish he would have used scripture,
[1:47:25] but he defined in every natural
[1:47:29] intellectual way
[1:47:32] of what it is to have the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:36] And I'm telling you, people who would
[1:47:38] listen to that will be shocked to find
[1:47:41] out later they don't have the Holy
[1:47:45] Ghost.
[1:47:47] But let me share this little story
[1:47:48] before I close. Remember the man who
[1:47:51] come to brother Brandham
[1:47:54] and he says I want the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:57] I'm going to just paraphrase it. Found a
[1:48:00] little flyer one day. Where are you
[1:48:03] going to go? Where are you going to be
[1:48:05] when your life is over? And he said
[1:48:08] something rose up in me.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; And I thought, where will I go?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost. And he went over
[1:48:19] here,
[1:48:21] but it didn't satisfy.
[1:48:23] And he went over here and it didn't
[1:48:25] satisfy. And he went all these places,
[1:48:28] it didn't satisfy. Finally, here's and
[1:48:31] he comes to Brother Brandon and he says,
[1:48:33] "How do I get the Holy Ghost? I've been
[1:48:36] sighing and crying day and night going
[1:48:39] all over searching for the Holy Ghost."
[1:48:43] Brother Brandham asks him a few simple
[1:48:45] questions about what was his reaction.
[1:48:50] And the man shares how when I read those
[1:48:52] words, something
[1:48:54] something happened inside of me.
[1:48:58] This is a pretty deep mystery when you
[1:49:00] think about it.
[1:49:02] Don't we want confirmation we've got the
[1:49:04] Holy Ghost?
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Don't we want God to to confirm to us?
[1:49:09] Sure.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And he talks about what happened in his
[1:49:13] life and how he started pursuing and
[1:49:15] reading and studying and praying. And
[1:49:18] brother Brandham says, "You know, when
[1:49:19] you picked that little flyer up and that
[1:49:22] little something happened in you and you
[1:49:24] said, I have to have this."
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "There
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; you had the Holy Ghost."
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; What a mystery.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:35] Or we can turn it into a year's worth of
[1:49:38] classes,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; tests to be taken, a review board that
[1:49:43] you must pass in front of.
[1:49:47] Or maybe we could have a test today. How
[1:49:49] many quotes can you quote? And if you
[1:49:51] can't quote 50 quotes per verbatim, you
[1:49:54] probably don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not even going to take the
[1:49:57] test because I couldn't pass it.
[1:50:01] But I believe by revelation,
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; God has revealed a mystery to us.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Of who we are.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Why we're here, what is taking place.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; And it all comes back. Christ in you.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Not anointed on your flesh,
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; not in the church you attend.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; In you.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:25] Hallelujah. I've got so much more.
[1:50:29] Ain't that it's just terrible?
[1:50:35] You see, very personal,
[1:50:41] very public,
[1:50:45] think about the word says, "If you're
[1:50:47] ashamed of me, I'll be ashamed of you."
[1:50:48] So, we don't want to be ashamed.
[1:50:51] We want our life to be on display to the
[1:50:53] world.
[1:50:55] Amen.
[1:50:57] It's not a union with the church.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; It's a union with Jesus Christ.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this will be awkward. Forgive
[1:51:04] me. Just be I'll pick on Sister Sue.
[1:51:09] She's like a big sister to me, even
[1:51:12] though she's so short.
[1:51:16] But if Sister Sue was a another young
[1:51:19] lady,
[1:51:21] I couldn't say, you know, I really like
[1:51:24] qualities that Sister Sue has.
[1:51:27] I think what I would do is I I think
[1:51:28] I'll just have a relationship with
[1:51:30] Sister Sue. Maybe it' be a spiritual one
[1:51:36] and that'll that'll help change my life.
[1:51:39] Then things get complicated and they get
[1:51:41] ugly and and then pretty soon, Sister
[1:51:44] Sue and I fight over something and I
[1:51:46] decide I've spiritually divorced you,
[1:51:50] which means
[1:51:52] I unfriended her.
[1:51:56] Come on. These are real types, my
[1:51:57] brother and sister. This is how people
[1:51:59] are. Yeah. No, I'm offended. I don't
[1:52:02] like what you have to say. I don't like
[1:52:03] how you do that. You don't agree with
[1:52:06] me.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:52:12] And then you start a pattern.
[1:52:15] Friend,
[1:52:17] unfriend,
[1:52:19] friend, unfriend.
[1:52:23] Holy Ghost comes and says, "Eat the
[1:52:25] book." Oh, praise God. I got the
[1:52:29] shivers. I got this. Oh, Jesus Christ is
[1:52:33] my friend.
[1:52:36] And the word says, "Quit your adultery.
[1:52:38] Quit your smoking. Quit your drinking.
[1:52:41] Quit dressing like you belong on a
[1:52:42] street out here. Quit those things."
[1:52:46] Unfriend.
[1:52:49] Church makes me happy.
[1:52:52] friend.
[1:52:54] Church preaches truth
[1:52:56] unfriend
[1:52:58] until you come to the church that always
[1:53:03] makes you happy.
[1:53:06] Well, I tell you what, if you find a
[1:53:08] church that always makes you happy, run.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; That's when you need to run.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Not to them, away from them. Because
[1:53:19] this gospel is meant to change us. Not
[1:53:22] to change for us, but us to change to
[1:53:27] fit the gospel. Amen. God bless you.
[1:53:31] We'll have to we'll have to just bring
[1:53:32] this up at another point in time. I
[1:53:35] didn't realize I just had so much here.
[1:53:39] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:53:43] Okay, Sister Ruth, that's what we'll do.
[1:53:46] I know brother David the other day says,
[1:53:48] "Brother Paul, don't be cutting them off
[1:53:50] like that." But but we're gonna cut this
[1:53:52] off. Amen. I want you to see, saints,
[1:53:57] this mystery. Yeah. Is there a mystery
[1:53:59] involved? Seven church ages. It was hid
[1:54:03] from a lot of people for a long time. It
[1:54:06] was there all the time. The seals right
[1:54:08] there in the Bible all the time.
[1:54:12] But God opened it up. the vials, the
[1:54:16] plagues, tribulation, all of this. It's
[1:54:19] been there all the time. And some people
[1:54:22] go this way and some go that way. And
[1:54:24] for example, don't mean to be offensive,
[1:54:26] but you know, they built a whole
[1:54:28] religion around 144,000
[1:54:31] when it's so clear in the scripture
[1:54:33] that's not Gentiles, that's Jews.
[1:54:36] And so they they they oh, we have a
[1:54:39] great mystery. I don't say this to make
[1:54:41] light of, but I was working on a
[1:54:43] construction site once and a man come
[1:54:45] and he says, "Can I witness to you?" And
[1:54:46] I said, "Of course."
[1:54:49] And he starts off and he tells me, he
[1:54:50] says, "Yeah, this is who we are. This is
[1:54:52] what we believe. This is what we do."
[1:54:54] And you know, and there's 6.5 million of
[1:54:56] us, blah blah blah blah blah, and this
[1:54:58] is how this works. And I just said,
[1:54:59] "Sir, stop. Stop." He's like, "Oh, oh,
[1:55:01] you got a question." I do. If only
[1:55:04] 144,000 are saved, what happens to the
[1:55:06] other 6 and.3 million or whatever.
[1:55:12] I don't know.
[1:55:16] I would encourage you to find out
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; and I would encourage you to read your
[1:55:19] Bible and realize the scriptures talking
[1:55:22] about the Jews.
[1:55:24] See, you can create a mystery
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; out of anything.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. But it takes revelation
[1:55:31] of the word of God to unfold the
[1:55:33] mysteries and make them where they
[1:55:37] reflect in our life. That's what God's
[1:55:40] doing. This word is not about what
[1:55:42] Martin Luther did.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther is in the word. But it
[1:55:47] wasn't about what he did. It's what God
[1:55:49] is doing right now. This message, this
[1:55:52] hour, this day.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad that God's
[1:55:55] revealed a mystery? One of the greatest

[1:56:44] would slow it down. Yeah.

[2:00:02] this morning.
[2:00:03] want to sing it.
[2:00:08] I know not why God's wonderous
[2:00:14] grace to me he hath made known
[2:00:21] nor why unworthy
[2:00:25] Christ in love redeemed
[2:00:29] me for his own.
[2:00:33] But I know whom I have believed it and
[2:00:39] am persuaded
[2:00:42] that he is aable
[2:00:46] to keep that which I've committed
[2:00:52] unto him against that day.
[2:00:58] I know not what this saving faith to me
[2:01:05] he did in part.
[2:01:10] Nor how believing
[2:01:13] in his word wrought peace within my
[2:01:19] heart.
[2:01:22] But I know whom I have believeth
[2:01:27] and am persuaded
[2:01:30] that he is aable
[2:01:34] to keep that which I've committed
[2:01:40] unto him against that day.
[2:01:46] I know not how the spirit moves,
[2:01:52] convincing
[2:01:54] men of sin,
[2:01:58] revealing
[2:02:00] Jesus through the word, creating
[2:02:06] faith in him.

[2:02:18] that he is able
[2:02:21] to keep that which are committed
[2:02:27] unto him against that day.
[2:02:33] And I know not what of good or ill may
[2:02:40] be reserved for me.
[2:02:45] Of weery
[2:02:47] ways or golden days before
[2:02:53] his face I see.
[2:02:57] But I know whom I have believed
[2:03:02] and am persuaded
[2:03:05] that he is aable
[2:03:09] to keep that which I've committed
[2:03:15] unto him against that day.
[2:03:21] I know not when my Lord may come at
[2:03:27] night or noon day fair,
[2:03:33] nor if I'll walk the veil with him or
[2:03:39] meet him in the air.
[2:03:45] But I know whom I have believed
[2:03:50] and am persuaded
[2:03:53] that he is able
[2:03:56] to keep that which I've committed
[2:04:02] unto him against that day.
