what a wonderful opportunity the Lord has given us Amen to serve him you know as brother Jose was speaking on Sunday it really spoke to me in just the Simplicity it says you know and we all make mistakes and Satan would like to magnify that and make that who we are but we have an anointing of almighty God that is greater than any Spirit of laodicea and that we can come and recognize Saints it's in us to recognize moments like these moments like these we can just stop and say I love you Lord I love you lord it's not about what yesterday or last week or last month but lord it's about this moment right here that I can say Lord I am in love with you let's just sing that chorus once again in more slime I sing out a song I sing out a love song to Jesus in moments [Music] I lift up my hands to the Lord from our hearts now hanging on our love you Lord singing [Music] foreign [Music] I haven't communicated with them since the other day but with I believe a diagnosis of covet again amen the devil just never gives up he's he's beaten it's already finished amen we've read the you know the phrase of we've read the end of the book He's beaten amen let's remember them I was just communicating this afternoon uh with brother Adrian and um just remember them in prayer amen that God would just bless them and I don't know if there's been anyone we missed well Lord forgive us for um just sometimes getting so preoccupied hey man I want to speak to you tonight thank you so much amen just a lovely song service tonight uh just really really touches my heart because it goes you might say right with my thoughts amen and as we are on this journey tonight I want to talk to you about a natural change from Hungary to satisfy and you see for the bride of Christ that comes naturally God does now you know it's interesting and we'll touch on that and I'll do my best to to bring you know the correct balance as I speak it but you see my brother and sister will look at this and realize that we as Sons and Daughters of God will never in our life become completely satisfied there's always going to be a yearning yeah there's always going to be a hunger but yet as we go tonight I trust that we'll see this very clearly out of the scripture the prophet of God lays it out quite nicely we come to a place that we no longer hunger does that make sense we're no longer hunger but we are never quite satisfied in the yearning and so it's there in that I don't want to get ahead of myself but you know when we were in the world right uh uh people do drugs they're often searching for something alcohol as they're searching for something and all kinds of events and activities and throw ourselves some of us know what it's like you know to throw ourselves into things and I just loved how a Family Camp brother Stevens like you know what I'm that guy I'm that guy that just becomes just I gotta do this and you know addictive behavior well I'm glad tonight I'm addicted to Jesus Christ amen that there is something but in the human element we always are kind of looking I think tonight you know brother Sergey would know this brother Ivan would know this for sure brother Trevor driving a truck you can drive the same route a hundred times but there's just something about or climbing up to the Continental Divide and just as you roll over it especially if you roll over it at certain times of the day and there's just something that's new and fresh and it's that yearning it's something that's there that we're looking as we were communicating with brother Adrian today they're having a little family time in Glacier National Park and just sent me just stunning pictures absolutely stunning and we're communicating and it just struck me how beautiful Heaven Must Be we're looking at the natural and it's just so picturesque it's just so incredible and a beautiful Heaven is going to be a natural change from Hungry to satisfied let's turn in Luke the sixth chapter the 20th through 28th verses amen a little of what started this thought was thinking about how blessed we are amen can someone stop right now and just say you know what I don't have to think very much I'm blessed amen God Has Come not only has he saved our souls but he has given us a good life amen to to come to serve him to be able to have in the natural also be able just to praise him and to enjoy this life and you know I I just uh brother Johnny and sister Linda doing a little travel to get away from the heat of Arizona at this time of year and I'm a little envious there like and this is us here and this is us there and this is us over here and you know you look at that and it is the nature of humanity that we're just there's something there drawing us forward and because after all one Sand Dune looks like another right no [Laughter] amen Luke the sixth chapter that was not a trick question and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God blessed are ye that hunger now for you shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake Rejoice ye in that day and leap for Joy for behold oh my this is a this is a paradox to the human flesh right we have just been reviled it's like our friendship even in the family I'm sorry we just can't get with you and yet the scripture says that we should rejoice in that day and leap for Joy Lord help me to understand amen for behold your reward is great in heaven for in like manner did their fathers and to the prophets but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger now here early in the verses if we're hungry we shall be filled but now they say they're filled and he's saying you're going to be hungry um yes woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you isn't this a little bit of the human nature brothers and sisters we want people to speak well of us even to the point we might compromise or be silent in the face of evil because we don't want to change how they speak about us [Music] woe unto you that are full for you shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when o men speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets but I say unto you which here amen are we hearing tonight love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings tonight in your precious name amen you may be seated Saints I want to just elaborate for just a moment on this and draw the focus what was in my thoughts and verse 21 blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company truly my brother and sister the only company that we should be concerned about never being separated from would be to the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ wherever he would uh be we want to be with him the word says that we will be with him amen and as we look at this I want to just draw from this a thought on being blessed and I say tonight I feel blessed to be in the house of God tonight to be able to come not because I'm the speaker but just simply to come and it is that when we we live life my brother and sister we find ourselves in midweek time some people say well you shouldn't find yourself well I'll tell you what it is and I'll touch on this a little bit later often times my brother and sister it's not really about that I have to have this great spiritual until pull me up in the middle of the week but it's actually that I yearn to see the Saints I yearn to be in fellowship with you even if I don't necessarily speak to you we're gathered together worshiping God together and I believe that is some element that God placed in US of what's drawing us you might say into uh into the future amen is that desire now is our Focus the Millennium no my brother and sister my focus is not the Millennium amen my focus is beyond the Millennium amen the Millennium is a period of time that has a start and it has a finish but when we come before the Throne of almighty God to worship on this sea of Crystal the glass and standing Before the Throne of God at the marriage supper of the Lamb my brother and sister there is no end to that so we're not looking the Millennium don't don't misunderstand me the Millennium is going to be awesome amen Satan's going to be bound a thousand years but when that's all finished he's bound forever amen so don't just get caught up in trying to make it to a millennium let's make it amen to the kingdom and look to the kingdom because it's actually not a space of time we're looking to it's Christ himself and so as we look at this I I want to read to you out of make the valley full of ditches in 1952 Amen brother Branham says here now it's always good Saints I want to put this out there to you it's always good amen we have the archives on the website it's always good if you don't have the notes go back read what's before it read what's after it we're not trying to isolate something to come up with a peculiar thought or something off but we want the whole word of God Amen but obviously time is a constraint now when this meeting is closed you'll go out somewhere and somebody say well I'll tell you I got that figured out see now that was mind reading that was this that or the other and and the devil will rob everything away from you that God has given you and I want to just ask you anybody ever experience that amen the devil the robber shows up on the doorstep amen and he's trying to rob it that was good preaching tonight but it wasn't for you or that was good preaching but boy didn't he step on your toes that was good preaching but it was Irrelevant for the day we live in my brother and sister are the devil's out there like a thief amen and so you look at this the prophet saying you know he'll Rob everything away from you that God has given you now if God gives us something my brother and sister it has value amen don't look and say well that's just a little thing my brother and sister if God gave it to you it's important amen you know kind of like uh I I I saw a deal I thought was so funny you know kind of the Paradox of it uh uh uh that uh the chocolate chip cookies that were vegan or something like that and so they removed the chocolate chips that's not a chocolate chip cookie if it has no chocolate chips amen and that's what the devil's trying to make the gospel is a gospel with no power no blood and no Redemption it's just a gospel amen and so my brother and sister it doesn't apply I like chocolate chips whenever I can sneak one amen I I like them that's what makes the cookie amen just like raisins is what makes oatmeal raisin cookies amen don't call it oatmeal raisin if it's got no raisins call it oatmeal cookie amen so you look at this and you're saying God and when you when you uh let me get it well he's given you what you do when you got it in your heart just keep moving on Amen Can someone say thank you Lord saying God give me more give me more amen now here it is I want to paint a picture for a moment the devil's trying to steal what God has given you from you amen so maybe even right in the moment distraction worries of tomorrow he's trying to steal what God's given but the prophet is telling us what you do is come in that moment amen connect us together and when he's trying to steal what God give you you're saying give me more Lord give me more Lord amen the devil's trying to take it away what I want is more amen I don't want less amen I mean that's kind of like being for us pardon to put it this way that's kind of like us saying well we can be Christians without the message well my brother and sister the message is Jesus Christ so you re remove Jesus Christ out of your Christianity and what do you have much worse than a chocolate chip cookie with no chocolate chips amen so you look at that and see God give me more give me more and blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness see if you even hunger for it come on let's read this together if you even hunger for it you're blessed just to hunger for it oh is that not beautiful to be blessed that just because you have a hunger down in the soul you might say this week or this month or circumstance has been bad you're blessed that you just desire that you hunger for that is a blessing that has come on from God to you amen see it's a blessing because you've got enough of God in you to hunger for righteousness now I'm going to throw this out the devil will tell you that behavior that circumstance that's not righteousness my brother and sister the prophet is saying you are blessed because you're hungering for righteousness it isn't whether you attained or you failed or a circumstance but the hunger that's in the soul is God blessing you oh my how beautiful that is amen makes my heart just happy tonight just knowing that I am blessed because down inside of me something is yearning for more hallelujah hallelujah now I want to go into first Peter the second chapter verses one through five amen just pray for me you realize when you dive into a subject sometimes if you want to make a part 200 out of it then you can just take it all and move along Mosey through it but if you want to just bring us a expression in one service sometimes you you have to leave a lot of things out you have to put a lot of things to the Sun and yet it seems like when I can't remember who I am back there you get in the pulp and in every quote in scripture you've read for the last week comes a Total Recall and you want to preach them hey man it just is how it is wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies in all evil speakings that's a lot of stuff to lay aside and the age that we live in my brother and sister that's that's a lot of laying down as newborn babes desire this sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be have tasted that the Lord is gracious now to have tasted it my brother and sister you had to be a partaker of it this is to be a tasting of it is not something that is just superficial but it is something that has touched not only your spiritual senses but will have touched you in your physical senses amen we'll have spoke to you and moved you in such a fashion that you now have a recall about what that was are you with me a recall what it was the first time the Holy Spirit come down and fell upon you and you are there and you realize my life will never be the same ever again and you can stand and say thank you for that lord it's not a moment that you say with regret I got saved and my life will never be the same amen you stand up with joy and say thank you Lord because now I have tasted of the goodness of God and my life does not want to be the same amen to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also now is including us as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so we see and this is the part where I draw this in you take a newborn baby amen and that baby my brother and sister when it is hungry it just goes in the corner and pulls a blanket around itself and falls asleep none of our babies did they raised the roof if I'd had sense enough to block the roof up at that time I'd have had a two or three story house but when a baby is hungry amen they let Mom know dad know however you want to put this and when a son or daughter of God has tasted of the good things of God and they become hungry amen they don't go find a quiet corner and try to put it all behind them they start crying out amen and saying you know what Lord I'm hungry and I want to be fed I don't want to just come to church and just hear about how it would be this or that over there I want something I can take home with me something that has a holding power something that will sustain me in laodicea amen some people say well you know they shouldn't have two problems you know maybe they're maybe they're retired or maybe you know the wife or whatever the kids are home school they're not even out in the public my brother and sister the devil doesn't need to take you to the mall the devil doesn't need to take you out here to a theater the devil will come and knock on your door and slip in under the door amen or whatever it takes that that he can do that and we realize as it is that you know the devil he might take his man but he never takes that spirit and that spirit's there amen so we look at this now this newborn baby is Desiring now my brother and sister the only way that that baby will actually get amen if it's a nursing baby the only way it will actually get satisfied is to cry out and let mother know I am hungry amen and you take a mother amen never been there I probably was not even a very diligent dad but you have a mother amen and they can recognize a cry whether it's a cry of for attention it's a cry for Hunger can we say Amen mom say Amen recognize what that baby's Desiring my dad's like why is a kid making noise and Mom is saying it's got a wet diaper or it's hungry or whatever it is they recognize that and Our Father which art in Heaven amen my father Abba Father Knows What My Cry is knows what your cry is amen sometimes our cry is not even for us it is for someone in our family or someone in the church or a friend or a need and God recognize nice was that cry but sometimes the cry is an anguish that is inside the heart or soul of a son or daughter of God because they know there's another position they desire to obtain there's another position they desire to move into and not as it is defined is a heart's cry amen and when a heart's cry starts to cry out and say Lord I want more of you I need more of you Lord I'm hungry and I want to be fed that cry my brother and sister comes to the throne of God God doesn't say ah they can wait amen God says I'm going to put in motion what it is to satisfy the hunger of this son or daughter of God now satisfy that that hunger and The Thirst amen and so is this newborn baby is starting to cry out amen it elicits or brings into action it causes something to be set in motion that satisfies that and I can tell you right now just reading the prophet putting in paraphrased words here the prophet of God says I've never seen God fail to satisfy the soul of a son or daughter of God Hallelujah my brother and sister never see it now you can take this scripture never see Sons and Daughters of God begging bread now my brother and sister let's apply that natural amen apply that spiritual you have a need you cry out but you know what the devil does to us he causes us to go silent he causes us to go silent he paralyzes us and we have a need and yet we kind of deep down maybe feel like we're not worthy to call out to God not worthy to say Lord you know I need you to come on this scene maybe we had a temper tantrum that's something that might just cause us to hesitate amen but it's there that we are bound now by the circumstance and God says I don't care what your circumstance is cry out I want to hear that you're hungry I want to hear that you need something amen let's go to Luke the 15th chapter amen now this scripture my brother and sister has been preached many times many places I want to just bring it as a little reference tonight amen and as we would look at this we realize the Prodigal Son my brother and sister was a very very very deep subject it's not superficial about a backslidden kid that went and burned his money and then said man I made a mistake I guess I'll go home and let Daddy bail me out this is not at all my brother and sister this is talking and showing us the very depth of a heart's cry the very depth of its own our own words being spoken out and our own body our soul responding to whose words our words sometimes it comes to we have to respond to our own words or we have to speak let me rephrase that we have to speak our own words to get a response you can take the song he was there all the time my brother and sister you look at the circumstances of Life many people would say well I don't know I just have to wait till the Lord comes and gives me an answer my brother and sister most of the answers we have he's already given us he's there all the time but we are looking for more definitive answer you know shake the rafters something you know said on the porch expecting to see something happen but here's the Prodigal Son Luke 15 15. and he went and he joined himself it doesn't matter whether we're young or old but certainly to our youth be careful who you join yourself to amen he joined himself to a citizen of that country and he was sent into the fields to feed the swine it wasn't a very high class job you see in verse 16. it was left in such a position that there was nothing there for him but to fill his Bailer with the house that the same stuff the swine we're eating now don't be looking at this swine or this as as old he's out feeding the pigs my brother and sister that swine is a spirit I want you to look at it that way tonight okay would you amen so what was he left to fill himself or try to satisfy himself with the very things of the spirit of the age was satisfying or filling the bellies of those around him he's out there now in an age in a time in a place in an atmosphere and we can say it's too bad about this young man or this young woman my brother and sister do you understand how Satan can come and bring it to a place that they're feeding on something that cannot satisfy a hunger it cannot satisfy the soul but often times shame a motivating or anchoring factor in one's life and they'd say well I would go back to church I would like to go back to church I want to be in church but what will the people think I don't care what the people think my brother and sister what God wants is you and I out of the pigpen of laodicea he wants us out of that realm and so it's there that as he's coming now I want you to see the spiritual life of this young man and it's there that he is now filling his belly with the same thing that all of those around him has no man gave unto him are you with me on that I don't want to get that confused amen but I look at this and I realize how the natural and the spiritual are together and verse 17 I've had one of these moments and I think every one of us had ever got you know a deal maybe raised in church we don't see it quite so much but when he came to himself now this coming to himself my brother and sister doesn't matter raised born and raised in church come out of the wickedness of the world it really doesn't matter because every one of us has to come to our self I always was a Son of God Amen I always was a daughter of God that's the moment that we come to ourself when we realize this is not who I am this is not my identity I've been feeding with the pigs amen and I'm sorry to put it that blend that you go out here my brother and sister and there's a lot of place tonight that might as well have pig pen written over the door and people are there feeding I was talking to an individual here the other day and they're Christians amen and they invited me to come to a certain place here in Nampa and shoot pool with them on Sunday afternoons I don't know my brother and sister I look out and I think it says pigpen over the door is there anything wrong with pool absolutely not I mean if you have like a camp you know they have that pool table in there some of y'all's kids was in there pushing those balls around and I don't think we're going to have to take them home and you know scrub them and do all kinds of things because some pool Spirit got on him but I tell you what the devil knows how to get us down to the pig pen because that's where we need to go to have fun I did that for quite a few years Jerry and I's marriage amen not a good memory I don't look back on it with any kind of joy of that memory in fact God works in miraculous ways and we had a visitor staying at our house I come home at maybe I don't know 12 30 or so in the morning and uh unlock the front door and step inside the house and here's this young lady got her finger in my face reading me the Riot Act about what a no good load down husband I was and that's not how Christians behave and she just read me the whole Riot Act and I blew her off and it's like you're in my house get out of my way but there was something behind that I started thinking even if I don't claim to be a Christian what am I doing there I'm in another land amongst another kind of people filling my belly full of the swine food of laodicea and in my father's house Amen in that lovely how this ties together in my father's house there's plenty of food here tonight amen in my father's house all I need to eat everything I need is in my father's house and he started to speak this I don't believe it was just a thought saying I believe he started to speak that in my father's house there's plenty of spiritual food in 2023 in my father's house there's Deliverance there's peace there's Comfort there's joy in my father's house and as he started to speak that out he started to believe his own confession so much to the point he overcome personal shame and all of those attributes that Satan tried to Heap upon him you smell like the pigs you look like the pigs you act like the pigs you can't go back to your father's house you're dressed like the world you're dressed like this you're that and yet he kept saying in my father's house In My Father's House everything I need is in my father's house and I would rather be a servant in my father's house than to be here in this big pen eating the things of laodicea amen and he starts for home and when he came to himself he said how many hired Servants of my fathers have bred enough and to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him in my evening prayers I'm not worthy come on are you with me Saints how many times we have prayed that prayer Lord I am not worthy we've never once heard him say you're right you're right you aren't Worthy go out there to the servant's quarters go down here somewhere else and find peace and comfort no I will rise go to my father and I'll say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of the hired servants and he arose what's he doing he's believing his own confession God working on him down there in that land after living such squalor and living such a a horrible life and burning up his money on all kinds of things and he's down there but yet come on Saints I want you to get this he has down inside of him not the confession of laodicea he has a confession that is of heavenly amen a Godly confession he has a confession that is declaring I don't belong here and even if I am at the bottom of everything in my father's house I'm gonna be in my father's house I'm going to be a servant to my father amen excuse me for getting excited amen sometimes you store this stuff up for long enough you just get excited about it amen so he goes to his father and he arose and he come to his father but when he was a great way off that's the problem people have they think they got to make it to church to get it all right but our father sees us afar off coming right now imagine let's just take this back to the Natural sense of the scripture we used to have a hog farm most of my childhood many years after Jerry and I was married we we still raise Hogs I hope you see the humor in this I remember one time we're all dressed up to go to church the neighbor stops and says you guys have pigs out we're out there Jerry and address church dress men Church closing we're running around chasing pigs and we get them all put back in we didn't have to wrestle in the oven but we chased them around and around and whatnot got them put back in and imagine we're sitting in church and you hear behind you and you're like should have stayed home when his father went out and took possession I want you to see it my way okay tonight see it my way when his father went out and took possession of him he stunk like laodicea but what do we want to do we want to wash him up before they can do anything we got to get them and get a little perfume God says no come my son I'm gonna wrap my garment around you I'm going to make my claim on you my son who was lost has now been found nowhere does he say you come after and make sure you scrub behind your ears imagine God allows us infinite grace and mercy that allows us the mercy to come out and be delivered and the grace for us to go in I loved how brother Jose brought that to us amen my brother and sister and so here's gone saying I'm going to wrap my garment around you and you haven't even been washed yet thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus thank you Father but you see my brother and sister one of the things the factors that God used to move him from his world it wasn't just natural hunger but there was a hunger down in his soul for a fellowship with his father again amen and this is a little difficult but I'm going to just speak at blunt and direct he's not down there at the pig pen eating the Haas saying I miss my brother it wasn't about hey just all this Fellowship my best my brother and sister there is something incredible and deep about the relationship between us as sons and daughters and our father amen a relationship that is above even the fellowship we have in the body of Believers that relationship is so much higher and that's the one we're longing for that's the one we yearn but I tell you what when you have the Holy Ghost God will bring us into fellowship and unity amen we won't have Warfare in the church we'll have unity and the love of God because what it will be is God working on you and I amen and every time my fault Rises up amen and you see my fault then God would come and says here let me put a little a a a blanket a cloak a gown over this you don't see this here because it's my grace my Mercy my blood that surrounds him and pulls them into a fellowship and they go and kill the fatted calf my brother and sister and I tell you what I remember I was talking with brother Johnny today I just remember years ago brother Harold Hildebrandt preaching on the third poll the first time I ever heard it and I was like what kind of crazy whatever is he even talking about I don't have any clue what he's even talking about and I made a little note it's just my nature how my shorthand a third pull with a little check mark check this out and you know after I started looking for the third pull this is back you know even before there really was a search you know I think it was already started to make that but I started and I would be reading the message there's third poll why didn't I ever see that before I'll pick up another there it is here it is again here it is again here it is again why because when God opens our eyes and we see the opening of the word amen no matter what the devil tries to do he tries to tell him just stay down here this is where you belong this is where your fellowship was but there's something about that intrinsic relationship with the father that draws us home amen and our heart won't be satisfied until we're back in the presence of the father oh Hallelujah and I thank God for that drawing us amen pulling us now look what we can be my brother and sister just natural be hungry for food right amen I don't know about you I I don't want to be presumptuous but I get hungry sometimes for Fellowship I I'm not the guy that always has to be around people my job I spend as much or more of my time by myself and that's good because I don't have to worry about whether I'm in the key or F or not I don't have to worry about if that verse actually goes with that song Or Not there's nobody there to tell me different now that does create bad habits so we need people to say I'm sorry those two songs are not one but even if you are a kind of a guy that can just go you know have to have some constant deal hunger for Fellowship man and that is part of what the body a Believer satisfies In You and I amen we don't have all the same hobbies and all the same things that we want to do I mean I joke about this right but we don't live in a world that we have to ask permission Church leadership can we buy a house can we buy a car can we take a vacation that's not the world we live in what we are asking is Lord I need your presence and every one of us are sitting here tonight with that desire Lord we want your presence we want to come together and fellowship Lord and our fellowship is good in the natural what's happening in our lives but if you stop and think about it our fellowship is rooted in the father amen that's where our fellowship is rooted amen if it wasn't for the Lord most of us would never meet one another amen but God rich in Mercy says you know what I'm going to make this circumstance and this and do this and cause this to happen Boo and bring all this together amen and here we are tonight as Sons and Daughters of God not in our importance not in our ability not in what we've done or what we might do but it's in the father amen and he's drawn his family together and some of the family fusses amen we see this here in this scripture some of the family fauces but basically we can say would you rather your son my your brother I mean be in the pig pen of laodicea are you going to get over your fussing and welcome him into the family that's a good way to put it brother Johnny get over it Hallelujah you see what our real hunger is for divine Fellowship that supersedes my brother and sister all natural Fellowship Amen brother Branham says in the message expectation 1950 April the 5th 1950. very simple I Cherry Picked this yes I do that once in a while amen if there's a hunger in your heart for more of God there's bound to be more of God somewhere for you to find oh thank you Lord there's more satisfy this hunger of my soul lord there's something there that I can do now my brother and sister God could just bring it laid on her doorstep but why does he choose to have us yearn for it search for it cry out for it because it's part of the molding process and without that are any of your children spoiled okay we're not going to point fingers imagine what we'd be like father I want this father give me this no God wants us to yearn to cry out to press into Lord I need more of the Holy Ghost I need more of you that's what you're saying my brother and sister we're going to identify it as Holy Ghost but I need more of you Lord amen and when you cry out enough amen the word says he comes amen he comes on the scene when you draw nigh unto him he draws nigh unto you ask what you need my brothers and sisters don't just ask us a selfish child sitting on the couch all bundled up but draw nigh to him amen and come in his present and say Lord you know my heart I'm not wanting to be just a spiritual person I want to have you Lord and I want you on display in me Hallelujah and then people say oh they think they're spiritual my brother and sister usually the person that says I think they're spiritual is the one that does not seek does not call out for does not pursue does not recognize amen and they're just jealous that somebody else has something they don't have oh that was a little blunt wasn't it amen Hallelujah now I want to hurry up and close here brother Brown says here in the Philadelphian Church age well maybe I skipped over that for a reason oh I am so glad that my holiness is not of myself I left my I left both my hands Lord oh thank you Lord I've eaten my fair share of the diet of the husk of laodicea I am glad that I am in Christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yea imparted unto me blessed be God forever these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense of that is the opposite of fault it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization okay are we all together for example we recall that Jesus said in John 6 32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you true bread from Heaven amen now I'm telling you what sister Jerry showed a deal and I won't go into detail on it but my brother and sister in the world we live in today there's literally preachers standing in pulpits I hope not a message church but preachers standing in their their uh their cloaks their gowns in churches saying this word of God is full of heirs has contradictions and is not the whole voice or a words of God man's not put in there now my brother and sister they were religious people they have churches big churches they have all kinds of things but yet Satan has come in Far Enough amen and it makes you wonder what are they feeding on they're hungry look they're humans just like you and I so we know that there's a yearning in them a hunger in them for things amen something to satisfy that but what are they feeding on whatever it is my brother and sister the prophet of God said it's polluted right so it's not just in the sense of the opposite of faults it expresses perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization Jesus said in John 6 32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you true bread from Heaven John 15 1 I am the True Vine now my brother and sister will see no advertisement in the Bible of someone anointed of the devil standing before him saying I am the faults Vine at that point everyone anointed by a spirit is declaring I am the true wine we are the way truth error that's right so where do we discern that I'm going to say something a little controversial to you some will say we discern that in the Bible I disagree scripture says you can't even call him the Christ without the Holy Ghost you can publish all the Bibles you want and it will not give them truth relationship but you give true Revelation to a son or daughter of God the prophet of God says this becomes a brand new book oh my brother and sister we could have before God spoke to us have highlighted and highlighted and marked in reference in everything and then oh if I can make this Vivid to you and the point that God opens our eyes it becomes a brand new book in spite of all of our markings and all of our notes and references it becomes a new book it that stage amen I'm the True Vine Hebrews 9 24 for Christ is not entered into holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us isn't that beautiful amen first John 2 8. you see I was glad I didn't have to I'm just read a quote to you got all the scriptures we need all referenced right there amen John 2 8 because the darkness is passed Can someone say that with me the darkness is past amen we ought to be believing that amen I don't care what the devil says and what's happening in the world the word of God says that darkness is past and we are now walking in light oh hallelujah thank you Lord that I can walk in the light amen the True Light now shyness since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before anti-type contrasting with type and substance with Shadow take the example now of Manna From Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy in fact let me just take that another step further it comes so far from satisfying that they come to the place they murmured about a gift from God that was given to them without any uh expense on their part any labor on their part any costs you might say on their part and they murmured against it and rebelled against it and yet it was the very life come to them I cannot explain Hebrews 28 19. but Acts 2 38 has got to be false very gift of manna that fell from heaven to give life to sons and daughters I don't know how they make this Mana but they really ought to I can just see some people that were really good Cooks you know if they would just add a little cinnamon we like little miniature cinnamon rolls if they were just this if God would just do this if God would just choose something else why doesn't he drop us a T-bone every once in a while but it was God's provided way and God says I'm here to satisfy your natural hunger now bear with me when we are satisfied that's the place we set down and we relax and we start to ponder who am I that the Lord would bleed and die for absolutely who am I amen it's not my brother and sister all about I can quote out of this I can quote out of that I can do the timeline from my head I can tell you how it all is no my brother and sister some people are getting so far from the fact he bled and died for them while they can explain everything else they've missed the relationship of the father wrapping that garment around them oh how along for his arms around me the real hunger that we have my brother and sister there's a hunger for him it's only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day but if it was left around it become contaminated I'll tell you what we've done we've thrown this message down in every place and every circumstance and whatever and then we wonder why it produced what It produced because it was an old Revelation that they left laying around and telling the church now look we're going to go back here we're going to go back here we're going to go back here we're going to go back here my brother and sister every day going by more contaminated I want to live right here in the fresh Manna of my day I want that fresh Manna to fall and sometimes that Manna hurts sometimes that Manna corrects us sometimes that Mana just doesn't seem to have that sweet taste in our mouth my brother and sister but it's God's provided word it's God's provided way where God is dealing and speaking with you and I amen left around it become contaminated amen but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven whereof Manna was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life oh I tell you isn't this beautiful now don't be mistaken my brother and sister that the yearning that you still have to be in the presence of God is not the hunger that the prophet is saying goes away amen that is a yearning that God put in your heart to not get us to a point that we just settle down and say we've made it we made it this is what it was all about we made it read about the organ Trail if you need the answers to that my brother and sister you read about the settlement of the West and I don't say this derogatory big country people needed to be everywhere but you read true history and there would be people that left crossed out of Independence Missouri started West and when they got tired of traveling they said this is far enough yeah and then there were others that went a little further and some fought with the Indians and were hungry and hot and cold everything and they said this is far enough and that settled all of that country but there were some that said we started out to go to Oregon and we are going to Oregon and we are going to make it we're going to the land that we profess we were going to and they never stop and don't stop when you just get to Idaho on the organ Trail you read about what it was like when they went down the Columbia Gorge how that they would be men they had to unload everything out of their wagons and they had to get together brother I need your help sister I need your help church I need your help because I can't pull my wagon up the bluff by myself and if you pray for me I'll pray for you if you'll be my friend encourage me I will be your friend and encourage you you see where the body of Fellowship comes together and they got down in the Columbia Gorge and the only way once they got that far down in the gorge was either turn back and hope they could find another way or to come together in Fellowship and put every drop of effort to drag every wagon empty up the bluffs to the top and then carry everything they owned they say in history there used to be a spot there in the Columbia Gorge where anything you needed to make a house you could find it right there because after people had carried this up the hill and got up the hill finally they looked at that and said honey that big old four poster bed of yours is gone because I'm not going down there and carrying that thing I'll chop a few trees down when we get over here and I'll make you a bed imagine what that was in comparison the carnal flesh said oh my denomination was way more comfortable and much prettier but we found a place of Rest In God's provided Place amen and you look at this my brother and sister I hope I'm even making sense to you you look at this my brother and sister it comes back see we have come we have had our hunger satisfied I don't I don't like to speak it this way but I'm going to tonight my brother and sister if you can find something better than the message I encourage you to go to it amen but when you've come here God has answered the question and satisfied the hunger of the soul and now we're here with a yearning to be in his presence The Love Letter being expressed is causing us to say this world is not my home this is not where I belong Lord I want to be in your presence but don't mistake that as the hunger that the scripture says he's satisfied see people are like there must be something more I hear it from people I hear from people there must be something more brother Paul we're missing something in the message no I'm sorry this might be a little Blunt You're missing something the believer of the message is not missing anything you're missing something instead of going out here the denomination instead of going back out here to the world to try and find what it is that you are missing get down and say Lord my father's house has everything I need Lord take me back to my father's house and let God satisfy that oh Hallelujah here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God Hallelujah isn't that good come come sisterless amen I say thank you Lord thank you Lord what more could we search for what more could we search for Saints and if you find yourself hungry stop and say Lord just before I get away from my father's house let me just stop right here in my father's house and see what it is you've provided for me what you've already provided you've given to me it's mine amen it's my father have you ever noticed that when I was a kid when I was a kid I had a friend his name was Kelly kids you ever think your parents are really strict I'll go introduce you to Kelly's parents [Music] he got off the school bus he had exactly 15 minutes to have the trash take care [Music] and they had a little list and after he satisfied those things then Kelly had time for himself and I can remember one time that Kelly satisfied his deal and I remember what the treat was I want to say it was M M's Kelly was a nice young man he's like hey Paul look the way it is around the house here I deal with trash I take care of this take care of that let the dog out I'm gonna do all this stuff then I can get a treat you know we're just 12 euros 12

to pay for that [Music] Kelly had a revelation mom he's my friend and this is my house and his mom was like you're right son this is also your house let us recognize amen this is not just a house that we're uncomfortable to be in don't know if we belong there this house my father's house it's your house it's my house and God says I want you to be happy in my house I want you to experience the joy of the Lord I want you to experience the blessings pouring down from heaven come into my house come in my house I'll satisfy every hunger every desire of your heart Hallelujah is it good to be in the house of God tonight amen amen amen Hallelujah what is the real name of the song I'm hungry and I want to be fed anybody know what the real name of that is I don't think I made that song up I can sing the first Chorus version one Paul but I don't know the rest of the song is anybody no huh it just repeats oh Lord I'm hungry and I wanna be fed oh Lord I'm hungry and I wanna be fair how many times we gonna repeat it Lord I'm hungry and I wanna be fair Oh Come Oh Satisfy My Soul oh oh Lord I wanna be fair oh Lord I'm hungry and I wanna be fair oh Lord I'm hungry and I wanna be fair oh come and Satisfy My Soul amen 809 Brothers we'll just move on Amen amen let's just stand sing a song or two to the Lord tonight before we dismiss amen Hallelujah aren't you glad we get to look back on history amen I'm I'm thank God for that but I'm going to live in the history I'm going to live in the presence and the same God that was there is the same God that's right here the same God that the prophet stood on the platform and people wondered what's going on what's going on they thought it was psychology he was reading their minds but a prophet knew that God was present but he wasn't going to step forward until God was right there with him oh my brother and sister our biggest mistakes that we make in life is when we go forward without an answer from God Hallelujah oh I look back on history I see a mighty God unveiled approving over and over that his word and never fail but I can't keep on dwelling on some past memories [Music] cause he's the same God oh can you say Thank you Lord in me
