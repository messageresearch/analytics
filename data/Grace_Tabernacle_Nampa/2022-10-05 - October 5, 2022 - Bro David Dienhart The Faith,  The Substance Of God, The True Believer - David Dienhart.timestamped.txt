[32:09] that groweth more and more brighter and
[32:11] brighter clear and clearer and as we get

[33:11] land our place
[33:13] is Back to Eden amen positionally placed
[33:17] in Christ where we were to begin with
[33:20] for I know
[33:22] for I know I love this now remember it's
[33:24] thus saith the Lord he's speaking to us
[33:26] you personally now for I know that's
[33:29] what he knows not what he imagines
[33:30] that's what he knows I want to make that
[33:32] point
[33:34] I know the thoughts that I think it's
[33:38] his thoughts that I think toward you
[33:41] saith the Lord
[33:44] saith you're absolute
[33:47] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[33:50] give you and expected end
[33:54] then shall you call upon me you shall go
[33:57] and pray unto me and I will hearken unto
[34:00] you
[34:02] and you shall seek me and find me when
[34:04] you shall search for me with all your
[34:07] heart
[34:09] and I will be found of you saith the

[34:33] and I will gather you from all the
[34:35] nations the nominations from all the
[34:37] places whether I have driven you saith
[34:39] the Lord I will bring you again into the
[34:41] position place
[34:43] once I caused you to be carried away
[34:45] captive
[34:46] so what's we're in that second fold of a
[34:49] threefold mystery of the seventh seal
[34:51] which is God in you personally

[35:52] the definition of
[35:54] substance is one of the definitions but
[35:57] the one that is stands out to us with
[36:00] this message substance that which has
[36:04] actual existence
[36:08] substance that which has actual
[36:12] existence
[36:14] you could say it's real
[36:19] amen it's not something you imagine
[36:22] not something that is an emotion it's
[36:25] something that is real
[36:27] and it's moving and it's active
[36:30] it's existent
[36:33] it's in existence actual existence
[36:36] amen
[36:37] Hebrews 11 let's see here now
[36:41] how how the Earth was created how God
[36:44] how did God create the Earth
[36:46] and the things that are in it how did he
[36:48] create you how did he bring the earth
[36:50] into existence the world's into
[36:52] existence the heavens is before there
[36:54] was nothing
[36:58] are you with me now watch how God does
[36:59] this because God remember this through
[37:01] the as we go through this that God
[37:03] cannot change
[37:06] he cannot change his behavior his nature
[37:08] cannot change what he did yesterday he
[37:11] does now
[37:12] he never changes his pattern
[37:15] amen he Remains the Same if you get that
[37:18] Revelation you'll see much concerning
[37:21] the word and the message of the hour
[37:23] because the very theme of this message
[37:25] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[37:29] today and forever
[37:31] so when you see him doing what he did
[37:33] yesterday doing the same thing here
[37:35] today
[37:36] not the same maybe the same manner the
[37:39] same mask but the same person
[37:43] Amen in another form another Max another
[37:46] actor's garment
[37:47] all right in morphe are you with me all
[37:51] right now I don't want to go out to I
[37:53] don't want to go on these runs so I want
[37:55] to stay focused here I have a very
[37:57] definite focus and a and a and a in a
[38:02] context here I want to get across
[38:06] remember our title the faith the
[38:08] substance
[38:09] of God the True Believer
[38:12] all right
[38:14] Hebrews 11 verse 1. now Faith Revelation
[38:19] now Faith is the substance
[38:23] of things hoped for the evidence
[38:27] of Things Not Seen
[38:30] for by it the elders obtained a good
[38:33] report
[38:34] okay watch verse 3 through faith through
[38:39] what
[38:40] through faith
[38:42] we understand now remember faith I just
[38:45] read you what faith was
[38:47] brother Branham said faith is a
[38:48] revelation
[38:50] faith and Revelation is faith you can't
[38:54] have faith brother Brown said without
[38:56] revelation
[38:59] amen
[39:01] amen and we're talking about not a faith
[39:04] we are talking about perfect faith all
[39:07] right
[39:07] and perfect Faith Revelation is the
[39:10] substance
[39:13] amen of what you have hoped for or what
[39:16] the promise gives you
[39:18] all right
[39:19] now verse 3 through faith we understand
[39:24] it's revealed we understand and this is
[39:27] what God's wanting to get across to you
[39:29] personally and individually
[39:30] through faith we understand that the
[39:32] worlds were framed by the word of God
[39:38] so God framed the worlds by the word
[39:42] what was it before it was a word
[39:45] it was what he knew it was faith
[39:50] because it just said right here how God
[39:52] created the world through faith
[39:55] amen are you with me through faith
[39:58] through faith we understand that the
[40:00] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[40:02] that things which are seen were not made
[40:06] of things which do appear other word
[40:08] things that are seen are not made by the
[40:10] things which we see
[40:13] how was it made
[40:15] through faith
[40:16] by the word God's faith God's faith
[40:22] expressed in Word
[40:24] created brought to Creation
[40:28] now remember he can't change
[40:31] all right
[40:33] now
[40:41] faith is an actual substance
[40:48] faith is an actual substance we just
[40:50] explained that it's yours
[40:53] amen it's yours
[40:55] When Faith Revelation is given it's
[40:58] yours it's a subset it's yours
[41:02] amen and God gives you the faith it's
[41:05] yours nothing can move that from you
[41:09] amen all right so it's yours
[41:12] and actually faith is in a reality
[41:15] okay then Faith amen it's yours faith is
[41:19] the substance
[41:22] and the substance is in you made flesh
[41:27] notice it's something you possess
[41:31] you really have it
[41:35] amen
[41:37] you really have it
[41:42] it's substance of things hoped for
[41:44] you have it when you have faith because
[41:46] it's revealed in faith
[41:48] the substance amen
[41:53] and we want to speak now on faith a
[41:55] different kind of Faith a perfect faith
[41:59] that's a great thing
[42:01] amen
[42:02] there's really nothing else to declare
[42:04] it but Faith all right now he said
[42:08] faith is something revealed to you
[42:12] see it's just as real to you as any
[42:15] other thing could be that puts you back
[42:17] where your faith in is not in some
[42:19] individual
[42:20] it's not in a man it's not in an
[42:22] organization it's not in a group of
[42:24] people it's in God because God is the
[42:28] word so where do we find faith in the
[42:30] word
[42:33] amen now we'll come to that in just a
[42:36] few moments here
[42:42] foreign
[42:44] now I can't make you believe neither can
[42:47] you make yourself believe
[42:50] God has to give it to you now I'm going
[42:52] to come back to these in just a minute
[42:54] these little spots here it's a gift of
[42:57] God to believe
[42:59] not your faith
[43:01] God's faith
[43:03] your intellectual Faith might believe it
[43:05] fine
[43:07] but unless the faith of God is down in
[43:10] your heart how would it be down in your
[43:12] heart it was deposited
[43:14] before the foundation of the world
[43:18] that seed was deposited as seed contains
[43:21] everything you have need of that seed
[43:23] contains that Faith it's why brother
[43:25] Branham referred to it as Faith seed
[43:30] okay all right so it's deposited you see
[43:34] to begin with it's placed in you
[43:36] and so and but you can have your
[43:39] intellectual Faith might be fine but
[43:40] unless the faith of God is down in your
[43:43] heart notice what he said the faith of
[43:45] God
[43:46] so God operates through faith
[43:49] you know that don't you think you know
[43:51] that God operates through faith
[43:54] faith moves the word
[43:57] Faith moves the promise because it's the
[43:59] substance of it
[44:01] to you now we're talking to you
[44:02] personally tonight amen all right see
[44:06] your intellectual faith can accept it do
[44:10] that
[44:12] so just keep believing it with all your
[44:14] heart in other words a right mental
[44:16] attitude until God reveals it to you
[44:21] just keep believing it until God does
[44:24] reveal it
[44:25] but it's got to be revealed he said but
[44:28] until he does reveal it amen you hold it
[44:32] all right
[44:34] now
[44:37] I want to go back over here just a
[44:39] moment
[44:44] brother brownham said in the message
[44:48] um
[44:50] well anyway 64 802 I forget the name of
[44:53] it right now anyway he said
[44:56] is
[44:57] 64-august 2nd 64. see God in the
[45:01] beginning that's the first place
[45:04] remember how I said you're justified in
[45:06] the first place you never did it so God
[45:09] in the beginning when he thought of you
[45:12] now watch this carefully when he thought
[45:14] of you he thought of when he thought of
[45:16] you and thought of others like that
[45:20] thought of himself of being tangible
[45:25] so when he thought of you and thought of
[45:27] others like that he thought of himself
[45:33] being tangible
[45:35] all right
[45:37] that was his thoughts
[45:41] see
[45:45] in other words that was something he had
[45:48] it was real
[45:49] that was the substance
[45:53] amen
[45:55] it existed
[45:57] he is eternal
[46:00] it was the thoughts he just said of
[46:01] himself
[46:03] thoughts of himself becoming tangible
[46:05] being tangible when he thought of you
[46:09] all right all right so now
[46:12] he began to realize you have to realize
[46:15] where you came from
[46:16] because this will give you that perfect
[46:19] satisfaction that we spoke of
[46:21] you can relax and let God Walk Through
[46:23] you talk to you live through you
[46:27] work through you amen that's right and
[46:31] so he's so he says he thought of himself
[46:33] that was his thoughts that was his faith
[46:36] that was his substance so he expressed
[46:38] his thoughts
[46:40] amen by the word by a word by word he
[46:45] said he expressed his thoughts we know
[46:46] that the word then is the thought
[46:50] Express a thought expressed in this case
[46:53] it's God's thought because God is the
[46:55] word
[46:56] and God and the Bible said the word of
[46:59] God was with the word was with God how
[47:02] was it with God as a thought
[47:05] it was Revelation it was faith in him
[47:08] when he does that he's expressing
[47:10] himself to you that he'll never change
[47:12] that's God's way
[47:16] and if that's God's way that's his
[47:18] bride's way
[47:22] because it's the thought of himself
[47:23] you're the thought of himself all right
[47:25] so so in other words you're the thought
[47:28] I'm going to come into this more and
[47:29] more right here but you are that
[47:31] substance
[47:35] Hallelujah
[47:37] if I can stand behind this Pulpit long
[47:40] enough I'll preach it quicker
[47:42] all right now
[47:44] so he expressed his thoughts by the word
[47:46] he said let there be let there be and
[47:49] there was let there be and there was
[47:51] and after a while he kept saying let
[47:53] there be till the people said one day
[47:55] don't let God Speak
[47:58] let Moses speak so he said now he said
[48:01] I'll speak to them through a prophet
[48:04] through prophets but it's still God
[48:06] speaking it's still his thought Express
[48:08] and today the book's been opened the
[48:11] book contained names the book was the
[48:13] wedding certificate in Revelations 10
[48:15] that's been opened to you individually
[48:19] the marriage has come the certificate
[48:21] was opened it couldn't be opened until
[48:22] the marriage
[48:24] because the the marriage certificate
[48:26] contained names it contained the name of
[48:28] his body
[48:29] the names of his bride the name of his
[48:32] bride right there Then those things were
[48:34] revealed in there
[48:36] and that revealed to you personally
[48:38] makes you the complete revelation of the
[48:40] whole thing
[48:44] all right so I'm going back now to this
[48:47] success this substance which
[48:50] is is is an actual existence
[48:56] and he said now speak to them to a
[48:58] prophet Revelations 10 as I just said
[49:00] you are revealed in Revelations 10 the
[49:03] complete revelation of the whole thing
[49:05] finished the mystery of God
[49:08] you the Finnish mystery
[49:11] he kept it hid he kept that seventh seal
[49:14] closed until this day
[49:16] at the end of the day at the End of the
[49:19] Age
[49:20] because that Revelation turned the
[49:22] corner into a bride age bride time this
[49:27] is bride time yeah laodicea is going
[49:29] around but we're not in labor to see it
[49:31] we're we are in the resurrection in him
[49:33] we have the Rapture in us the
[49:35] resurrection is is the substance an
[49:38] actual substance existing in me and you
[49:40] if it's revealed to you
[49:44] and if it's revealed to you who's going
[49:46] to take it from you you've already risen
[49:48] in faith by faith you've already risen
[49:51] because that Resurrection is in you what
[49:53] a great Resurrection this is
[49:57] amen at the raptures revealed in you
[49:59] which the Rapture is a revelation then
[50:01] you know you have a body waiting because
[50:04] you've already got that change in You by
[50:06] saying Faith right now you have the
[50:09] actual substance of the body change
[50:13] Glory
[50:16] amen how does it put into Motion in a
[50:19] word what's your confession
[50:24] all right so I'll back up here a little
[50:26] ahead of myself right here so now and so
[50:29] a prophet said a prophet
[50:31] and the prophet said there shall come
[50:33] there will be and it was and it was and
[50:34] it was and it was just like that and we
[50:37] could say today it is it is it is it was
[50:39] and it is it's prophesied and here we
[50:42] are we're living in it
[50:46] all right now
[50:50] foreign
[50:53] faith is an actual excuse me I'm sorry
[50:57] now the only thing you have to do I'm
[50:59] jumping ahead of myself let's I want to
[51:01] go to the church age book the brother
[51:03] George's book here if you're following
[51:06] and it's a red book the same number same
[51:08] page numbers
[51:10] and so
[51:12] on page one
[51:15] on page 164 of this book now I want to
[51:18] show you the substance are you with me I
[51:20] want to show you where you were
[51:26] you are substance somewhere
[51:30] amen all right let's watch this now
[51:33] watch carefully paragraph one page 164
[51:36] paragraph 164 watch carefully now and
[51:39] see this before there was ever a speck
[51:41] of Stardust before God was God or an
[51:43] object of worship God is an object of
[51:46] adoration no one else there to worship
[51:48] him he was at that time only potentially
[51:50] God or other words only potentially an
[51:53] object of worship but he was eternal
[51:55] spirit
[51:56] all right and he is known only as
[52:00] eternal spirit the bride was already in
[52:04] his mind
[52:05] [Music]
[52:07] yes she was she was are you ready
[52:10] existing
[52:15] in his thoughts
[52:19] actual substance
[52:24] you were already a revelation to him
[52:27] he already knew you he said I knew you
[52:30] he said in his word I knew you
[52:33] some came to him and said I've cast out
[52:35] devils in your name I've cast out Devils
[52:37] by the anointing of the spirit don't you
[52:39] ever look at casting out Devils to be in
[52:41] the evidence of the indwelling of the
[52:42] Holy Ghost because I'll tell you why
[52:45] it's not the we believe every bit of us
[52:47] have the authority as a bride to cast
[52:49] out Devils I'm not questioning that
[52:50] through not questioning the anointing
[52:52] but don't take that as an Evidence don't
[52:54] take an emotion
[52:56] take the genuine evidence of the
[52:58] revelation of the word in you
[53:00] identifying you the message of the hour
[53:03] that is the evidence of the indwelling
[53:05] spirit because he said I only reveal
[53:08] this mystery to my bride
[53:12] amen are you with me all right so
[53:15] because why you were always a part of
[53:18] him she was existing in his thoughts
[53:22] and what about those thoughts of God
[53:24] they are Eternal are they not
[53:31] where were you before the foundation of
[53:34] the world where was your name where were
[53:36] you existing
[53:38] as his very substance
[53:42] Eternal substance
[53:45] you were dwelling in him and that was
[53:47] the substance he and you is the
[53:49] substance
[53:52] now you're beginning to see Oneness
[53:56] all right all right now so the Eternal
[53:59] thoughts of God let me ask you are the
[54:00] thoughts of God Eternal if you can see
[54:03] this you will see many things if you can
[54:06] see yourself Eternal as well as an
[54:08] actual substance in God you're going to
[54:11] see many things number one you're going
[54:13] to have a a true uh you're then a true
[54:16] witness you're going to be truly
[54:18] satisfied nothing else is going to
[54:20] satisfy you but this word revealed to
[54:23] you and how does it come to you by faith
[54:26] and how does that Faith come by the word
[54:29] by the hearing of the word
[54:32] because his faith is hid in the word
[54:38] now not just anybody can get that only
[54:43] are you with me only true Spirit-filled
[54:46] True Believers can hear the word
[54:51] the only ones that can receive
[54:53] Revelation is that the Holy Spirit must
[54:55] be dwelling in you
[54:57] you will never receive revelation of the
[54:59] hour you can intellectualize it all you
[55:01] want but the true perfect faith of
[55:04] revelation will not come to you unless
[55:06] you're spirit filled
[55:07] holy spirit filled the person has to be
[55:10] living in you an actual substance
[55:12] existing
[55:14] the revelation of Jesus Christ in you he
[55:17] said is what he would build you
[55:18] individually is church as a member he
[55:21] will build his body his church
[55:23] upon that rock revelation of himself
[55:27] all right
[55:28] and you can see where the bride is
[55:30] coming to Perfection why because the
[55:32] message is the Capstone message
[55:34] and our day is the Capstone
[55:37] and that's why this Revelation today we
[55:39] have to grow up individually the the the
[55:41] churches the church
[55:43] Seven Ages has grown up into that time
[55:45] but here we grow up into it into
[55:48] Perfection of the headstone
[55:51] Hallelujah
[55:53] and notice he'd been honing honing
[55:55] honing honing honing all the way up
[55:57] until the seals were open and then he
[55:59] said the the Capstone came and he had
[56:02] been honing it honing it re revealing
[56:04] restoring restoring those things that
[56:06] were lost through the battle of the ages
[56:08] bringing it back are you with me
[56:12] and he said honing what for so the
[56:15] Capstone when it did come could set down
[56:17] upon it and the two could become one so
[56:20] where is the rising of the sun it's in
[56:23] his body
[56:24] it's in his bride
[56:28] they're uniting
[56:30] they have been uniting
[56:33] brother Brown said The Headstone in the
[56:35] body has United together
[56:39] Christ's the mystery God revealed he
[56:41] said the body The Headstone and the body
[56:43] has United
[56:45] they are no longer Twain They are one
[56:47] look at this Prophet prophesying let
[56:49] there be let there be watch him bring
[56:51] out the Revelation that you're growing
[56:53] into
[56:57] Hallelujah did you get that
[56:59] all right now watch what else he said he
[57:02] never has changed his thought
[57:05] about anything
[57:08] he never changed his thought he hasn't
[57:10] changed his thought about you
[57:13] amen you can't be the actual substance
[57:16] in him and then up here being lost
[57:20] amen
[57:22] you can't it's impossible
[57:25] because God can't lose himself
[57:29] and I will bring you back I'll bring you
[57:31] out of that dark denominationalism I'll
[57:33] produce myself in you you'll be myself
[57:35] coming in Bride form which is the
[57:38] seventh seal revealed faithful Lord
[57:41] because the prophet said the mystery of
[57:43] his coming is the seventh seal
[57:49] amen all right now he said now he said
[57:54] watch this he said he had never had any
[57:56] other thought about it he he said
[57:58] about anything he never never had
[58:00] another thought about you he knows the
[58:03] he always had and always will have and
[58:05] knows the end from the beginning because
[58:07] he is God thus the thoughts of God watch
[58:10] this are Eternal they are real
[58:17] substance
[58:18] faith
[58:22] they were in him real you were real
[58:27] there
[58:28] you were actual substance in him
[58:34] and the only way he could and we'll come
[58:36] into that just a minute now watch
[58:38] he said
[58:40] these elect are not he said these elect
[58:42] are the Eternal thoughts of God which
[58:44] were to be expressed in flesh in their
[58:48] due season
[58:50] this is your due season this is my due
[58:53] season we are the the Eternal thoughts
[58:56] of God expressed in flesh
[59:00] amen you say Brother David this is too
[59:02] deep no it's too simple
[59:05] it takes Revelation to see the
[59:08] Simplicity of God it's not your mental
[59:10] exercise of what's simple and what isn't
[59:12] it's the revelation of the word
[59:16] that's why it's hid from the wise and
[59:18] prudent and revealed to bride substance

[1:04:12] now so we got that far let's go to
[1:04:14] Psalms 139.
[1:04:17] Psalm 139 15.
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:34] Psalms 139
[1:04:43] amen watch this now verse 15 now you can
[1:04:46] read the whole thing when you get back
[1:04:48] or I said when you get home or whatever
[1:04:50] you want to do but but Psalm 139 15 and
[1:04:55] 16.
[1:04:58] my substance
[1:05:05] my substance
[1:05:09] you see you could read the rest of it
[1:05:11] there he he can pass me he he compasses
[1:05:14] my passes my path and
[1:05:16] and see but look watch what he says here
[1:05:19] I miss bringing this out here watch he
[1:05:22] said that's your sub my sub yours the
[1:05:25] real you my substance was the Eternal
[1:05:28] you
[1:05:29] my substance was not hid from thee When
[1:05:33] I Was Made In Secret
[1:05:36] see made in secret hadn't been expressed
[1:05:39] yet
[1:05:39] but it's made in secret
[1:05:43] amen the prophet said
[1:05:49] the prophet said this about that he said
[1:05:52] over here when he before he read that
[1:05:53] scripture he said watch how this works
[1:05:55] God always had his thoughts had his
[1:05:58] thoughts
[1:06:00] for Adam
[1:06:01] always had his thoughts and I say what
[1:06:04] about you
[1:06:07] are you with me all right Adam as his
[1:06:10] thoughts was yet unexpressed
[1:06:15] Psalms 139 15 and 16 will give you a
[1:06:19] little idea of this and that's what I'm
[1:06:21] reading
[1:06:22] so that's why I said it was unexpressed
[1:06:24] when yet is unexpressed all right so he
[1:06:28] said
[1:06:29] he says here then my substance was not
[1:06:32] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[1:06:34] and curiously wrought see it was the
[1:06:37] secret
[1:06:38] that's why this secret mystery of God
[1:06:41] could not be opened this full mystery
[1:06:44] could not be open till this day because
[1:06:46] that's you
[1:06:51] he kept it a secret
[1:06:53] Satan couldn't get to it as long as it
[1:06:55] was the secret in God's mind
[1:06:57] he could do something with it when it
[1:06:59] was spoken
[1:07:01] that was hidden the word wasn't it
[1:07:03] but in the season it had to be spoken in
[1:07:07] order for you to come to manifestation
[1:07:09] he had to express his thought his
[1:07:12] thought his Revelation his faith his
[1:07:15] substance in a word
[1:07:19] yeah
[1:07:22] amen watch and he said now he said
[1:07:26] and you were curiously wrought in the
[1:07:28] lowest parts of the Earth
[1:07:30] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[1:07:35] being unperfect and in the book all my
[1:07:39] members were written
[1:07:42] which in continuance were fashioned when
[1:07:45] as yet there was none of them but it was
[1:07:46] fashion
[1:07:48] Revelation brother sister he had faith
[1:07:53] he all he didn't Express what he hoped
[1:07:55] and what he imagined he expressed and
[1:07:57] made it into a word what he knew
[1:08:01] what you were chosen in him before the
[1:08:03] foundation of the world how because of
[1:08:06] what he knew
[1:08:07] are you with me how by you you were
[1:08:10] elected by foreknowledge
[1:08:15] amen are you with me he knew it he knew
[1:08:17] it it was in him he knew it I have to
[1:08:20] express this portion of myself I thought
[1:08:22] of you and I thought of others I thought
[1:08:24] of myself
[1:08:27] all right
[1:08:29] now
[1:08:31] let's go back here
[1:08:33] we can you can read the rest of that
[1:08:39] notice on 11 Hebrews 11 1-3 through
[1:08:42] faith God created I've already expressed
[1:08:44] that he he expressed it in a word that
[1:08:48] felt Revelation substance God did not
[1:08:50] change his behavior per see perfect
[1:08:53] Faith God's own faith is hid in the word
[1:08:56] it's always hit in the word all right
[1:08:59] because it's always by the word
[1:09:01] by the hearing of the word what are you
[1:09:04] hearing when you hear the word if the
[1:09:06] holy spirit's in you it's up to him as a
[1:09:09] teacher to point that substance of
[1:09:11] yourself in that word and you can say it
[1:09:14] is written of me
[1:09:17] because the word is your absolute you
[1:09:19] were a part of the word you came for the
[1:09:21] word you can't disbelieve the word
[1:09:22] there's no way to turn the word down
[1:09:25] so God takes his word puts it in word
[1:09:28] form and said in a season I'm going to
[1:09:30] reveal that word to you and it's going
[1:09:33] to become alive and personal and it's
[1:09:35] going to be your word
[1:09:37] glory to God
[1:09:40] the same faith in use the same faith in
[1:09:43] him
[1:09:47] praise the Lord
[1:09:50] oh my okay now
[1:09:53] so here we go
[1:09:54] put your seat belt on
[1:09:57] all right
[1:09:59] God's own faith is hid in the word and
[1:10:03] God and only revealed to his elected
[1:10:05] chosen bride in him by the Holy Spirit
[1:10:08] now I'm just going over it I could just
[1:10:10] bypass that Romans 10 17 let's read that
[1:10:14] Romans 10 17.
[1:10:19] I've got to hurry Romans 10 17
[1:10:23] and
[1:10:24] so then Faith cometh by hearing
[1:10:28] and hearing by the word of God why
[1:10:32] because it's in the word
[1:10:34] and if you have the Holy Spirit the
[1:10:36] teacher if you have the spirit of Truth
[1:10:38] in you he's going to direct you it leads
[1:10:40] you into all truth
[1:10:43] glory to God
[1:10:47] and the evidence of that Holy Spirit
[1:10:49] living in you is that faith in you that
[1:10:52] Revelation is the evidence of the
[1:10:54] indwelling holy spirit in you you have
[1:10:57] an ear to hear the word
[1:10:59] for the season in your season it's
[1:11:02] quickened you quick and David said
[1:11:04] Quicken me Lord by Thy word Quicken me
[1:11:07] to the word
[1:11:11] amen amen you believe quickening power
[1:11:14] comes through the word
[1:11:16] amen the Holy Spirit dwells in the word
[1:11:18] the Holy Spirit lives through the word
[1:11:20] the Holy Spirit manifests himself
[1:11:21] through the word by what faith
[1:11:25] amen all right
[1:11:28] all right so
[1:11:31] so Faith cometh by hearing the word
[1:11:34] and have they not heard verily their
[1:11:36] sound went into all the Earth the words
[1:11:38] unto the end of the world
[1:11:39] for for what did Isaiah say in verse 16
[1:11:42] they have not obeyed the gospel Isaiah
[1:11:45] saith Lord who hath believed our report
[1:11:49] who does believe our report brother
[1:11:51] Brown said to them that it's revealed to
[1:11:54] is the believer that believes the report
[1:11:58] all right oh my all right see I always
[1:12:02] hit it
[1:12:04] he didn't reveal it to everybody he
[1:12:06] Sovereign what he reveals amen
[1:12:08] amen that's what makes him Sovereign you
[1:12:11] got to all right so
[1:12:13] now it's not a faith but a perfect Faith
[1:12:16] amen let's go over here to First
[1:12:17] Corinthians 2 and this read here where I
[1:12:20] where I said it takes the Holy Spirit I
[1:12:22] want you to see this in the scripture
[1:12:24] First Corinthians 2 and verse 11.
[1:12:28] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:12:30] save the spirit of man
[1:12:32] which is in him even so the things of
[1:12:35] God knoweth no man but the spirit of God
[1:12:38] so it takes the spirit of God to know
[1:12:40] the things of God
[1:12:43] amen just as pure and simple as that
[1:12:47] profit backs that up in many quotes
[1:12:49] all right
[1:12:55] see you can hear with your ears physical
[1:12:57] ears all the time but unless the spirit
[1:12:59] of God lives in you it will never be
[1:13:01] revealed amen
[1:13:03] all right
[1:13:05] so then the evidence see Hebrews 11 said
[1:13:08] faith is not only the substance it's the
[1:13:10] evidence of Things Not Seen and what is
[1:13:13] it what kind of an Evidence a holy
[1:13:15] evidence evidence that you always were
[1:13:18] in him a part of him amen
[1:13:21] see see he said
[1:13:24] then Faith as I said notice faith is
[1:13:27] something you possess
[1:13:29] are you ready
[1:13:31] faith is something he possessed what did
[1:13:34] he possess he possessed you
[1:13:37] the substance
[1:13:40] so he possessed it he possessed you you
[1:13:43] possess him
[1:13:44] all right not imagination you really
[1:13:47] have it
[1:13:48] amen substance that was in God the
[1:13:51] Eternal before the foundation of the
[1:13:52] world in him now you
[1:13:54] you in now in you this substance now in
[1:13:59] you in the season to Manifest this time
[1:14:02] and season amen it's in you for that
[1:14:04] purpose
[1:14:06] now it's a gift of God see it's the
[1:14:09] evidence the spirit of God dwelling in
[1:14:11] you it's your evidence
[1:14:13] amen that God lives down has
[1:14:18] that substance
[1:14:20] his faith his seed deposited in you
[1:14:24] it was always there
[1:14:26] amen amen now I just want to bring that
[1:14:29] out very clear all right now let's move
[1:14:31] right on we'll try to finish this up
[1:14:34] okay
[1:14:35] now the prophet
[1:14:37] here also says you see it's not a faith
[1:14:40] but is a perfect Faith built up in here
[1:14:43] in here the soul in behind the veil
[1:14:46] all right now the prophet here says that
[1:14:49] we are to earnestly contend for the
[1:14:51] faith not a faith but the faith that was
[1:14:55] once delivered unto the Saints
[1:14:58] amen so we then read Romans 10 8 let's
[1:15:02] go to Romans 10 8 what God saw what did
[1:15:05] he what did he see he saw he knew and
[1:15:08] through faith spoke the word and created
[1:15:10] the worlds
[1:15:12] are you with me brought you in creation
[1:15:14] what creation the new one
[1:15:17] are you with me the new one the real
[1:15:20] believer you had that laying in you to
[1:15:22] be quickened in this hour
[1:15:24] amen and he spoke it he had to speak out
[1:15:27] the Revelation hidden the word and when
[1:15:29] he did you come to yourself
[1:15:33] hey man did you get that without putting
[1:15:35] it in so many words
[1:15:37] amen all right now Romans 10 8 very
[1:15:41] familiar scripture let's read that
[1:15:46] but what said let's start with verse six
[1:15:48] but the righteousness which is of faith
[1:15:50] speaketh on this wise saying not in that
[1:15:53] saying not in your heart who shall
[1:15:55] Ascend into heaven that is to bring
[1:15:57] Christ down from above or shoe who shall
[1:15:59] descend into the deep that is to bring
[1:16:01] up Christ again from the dead but what
[1:16:04] say with that Faith what saith it what
[1:16:07] saith this righteousness of Faith we're
[1:16:09] speaking of what saith this substance
[1:16:12] what saith the Revelation what saith it
[1:16:16] the word is nigh thee
[1:16:18] even in thy mouth like it was in God's
[1:16:23] mouth
[1:16:25] and he put it in the prophet's mouth and
[1:16:28] the prophet spoke it and it dropped into
[1:16:30] your heart from mouth to Prophet to your
[1:16:33] heart and now it's dwelling in you the
[1:16:35] same word of faith
[1:16:37] glory to God you can't get out of God's
[1:16:40] Channel you can't get out of God's way
[1:16:42] of doing things he Remains the Same
[1:16:45] if he spoke into existence by the word
[1:16:48] of faith in a word in the beginning he's
[1:16:50] still speaking it today through his
[1:16:52] bride he's still speaking Revelation
[1:16:55] you're speaking it because you see your
[1:16:57] position you see your place you're
[1:16:59] headed back to Eden you're headed back
[1:17:01] to the original Eden your way is made
[1:17:03] you see your theophany you've already
[1:17:05] received and heard from your theophany
[1:17:08] therefore you have a body waiting it's
[1:17:10] no more a frustration it's a joy to
[1:17:13] serve God today
[1:17:15] this message is not just a a story it's
[1:17:18] a reality it's substance it's real it's
[1:17:21] a living it's Christ Jesus here today
[1:17:23] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:17:26] in Bride form
[1:17:29] to finish the mystery of himself to
[1:17:32] bring you back into the original is Eden
[1:17:34] as a masterpiece family
[1:17:38] oh yeah
[1:17:40] Hallelujah God is family
[1:17:46] you see we're right on the very cuff
[1:17:48] right here at the very point
[1:17:51] the headstones appeared that that's
[1:17:53] being united with his bride that's
[1:17:55] what's happening that's what makes us so
[1:17:57] unusual and seemingly so radical to
[1:18:00] those that don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:18:02] dwelling in them to those that do have
[1:18:04] the Holy Spirit dwelling in them it's
[1:18:06] music to their ears hallelujah it's joy
[1:18:10] unspeakable it's re it's Reviving it
[1:18:13] revives you every day and you can say
[1:18:15] what a resurrection this is what a
[1:18:17] Rapture that I'm I'm already living in
[1:18:24] and will bring about the body change
[1:18:26] everything that God does is first by
[1:18:28] faith
[1:18:30] amen are you with me your healing has to
[1:18:33] be by faith and then it brings forth
[1:18:36] what the full manifestation of your
[1:18:38] healing
[1:18:40] amen do you understand
[1:18:43] all right now
[1:18:46] see it's an actual substance
[1:18:48] hey
[1:18:49] all right
[1:18:51] that's the True Believer the True
[1:18:53] Believer is an actual Eternal substance
[1:18:57] oh boy was that good
[1:19:00] she's the message
[1:19:03] oh we believe the message of the Prophet
[1:19:04] what about the voice
[1:19:07] in the bride the same voice
[1:19:10] that spoke through the prophet the
[1:19:13] bride's saying the same thing
[1:19:15] by revelation
[1:19:20] you see why revelation's so important
[1:19:23] you see where you got to lay in that
[1:19:25] book and start eating on the book
[1:19:26] instead of playing video games do you
[1:19:28] realize why you have to eat the book
[1:19:36] you see why you need to give some time
[1:19:38] and start Redeeming the time back to him
[1:19:45] yes well Brother David I need my beauty
[1:19:46] rest listen God will give you enough
[1:19:48] Beauty to rest in three or four hours

[1:21:30] heart notice its substance in thy heart
[1:21:34] in thy mouth in thy heart that is the
[1:21:37] word of what faith

[1:22:17] God has raised him from the dead Thou
[1:22:19] shalt be saved say from what sickness
[1:22:22] save from what turmoil say from what
[1:22:25] your trial save from what your
[1:22:26] Affliction saved you shall be saved Zoe
[1:22:30] or not Zoe
[1:22:31] Zozo
[1:22:32] salvation
[1:22:34] he sent his word not only saved you he
[1:22:37] sent his word and healed you
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:42] what do you have to impart
[1:22:46] amen you can impart life to Believers
[1:22:49] that's what I'm imparting tonight that's
[1:22:51] what he is imparting through this lump
[1:22:53] of two bit two by four lump of clay he's
[1:22:56] the party imparting life to believers
[1:23:00] peace to believers
[1:23:02] rest to Believers healing to believers
[1:23:06] do you believe God does that through his
[1:23:08] word then accept it
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:14] that's not a word of a man except it is
[1:23:16] the word of God and see what happens
[1:23:21] amen all right now
[1:23:25] so we see that it's in your mouth all
[1:23:28] right now now watch what he says in the
[1:23:30] third seal 3 20 of 63 Saint John 1 in
[1:23:34] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:23:36] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:23:38] the word became flesh and dwelt with us
[1:23:42] God dwelt With Us in flesh he was the
[1:23:47] word amen amen
[1:23:51] before I go that much further let's pick
[1:23:53] this up the only thing you have to do
[1:23:55] then is have faith in what you are have
[1:23:57] faith in what the word says you are
[1:24:01] so God's trying to get across
[1:24:03] he said
[1:24:05] and Jesus had faith in the word of God
[1:24:08] that said what he was the faith of God
[1:24:11] the very substance of God he was God
[1:24:14] do you believe that well she is him
[1:24:17] do you believe that
[1:24:21] all right
[1:24:23] the express now he said I'm the bread of
[1:24:26] life to come from God out of heaven so
[1:24:28] are you
[1:24:32] well I didn't get any amends on that
[1:24:34] every promise that promised of him
[1:24:36] brother Bram said it pertains to the
[1:24:38] bride because the bride is himself
[1:24:40] revealed
[1:24:42] the bride is himself that's a direct
[1:24:44] quote is and it's more than a quote it's
[1:24:46] a reality to me the bride is himself
[1:24:48] revealed
[1:24:52] so who is she
[1:24:55] if he's the bread of life who is she the
[1:24:58] final voice under her messenger she will
[1:25:00] be the final voice to the final age
[1:25:04] not another voice
[1:25:06] the revelation of the message
[1:25:09] amen it manifested the rebel the message
[1:25:13] the thought of God put in word for this
[1:25:15] hour
[1:25:16] spoken
[1:25:18] she's the manifestation of that word
[1:25:23] that's her position the prophet said is
[1:25:26] the very manifestation of the word
[1:25:28] he said I'm that tree of life so are you
[1:25:31] the bride tree is the tree of life it's
[1:25:33] the bride tree of his life it's himself
[1:25:35] in Bride form
[1:25:39] all right amen and the message today
[1:25:42] brought the peace right back to his side
[1:25:44] no longer are they Twain They Are One
[1:25:50] that's what this message is revealing
[1:25:54] to you individually bride you're one
[1:25:57] with him you're one
[1:25:59] hopefully you see this tonight that
[1:26:01] you're one
[1:26:02] all right now he said all these things
[1:26:05] that I am he knew with that perfect
[1:26:08] Faith he was the anointed Messiah
[1:26:11] brother Branham said on paragraph 55 a
[1:26:13] perfect fate page 27 and now we become
[1:26:16] Anointed with the same Spirit anointed
[1:26:18] Messiahs
[1:26:20] Messiahs of the last day to shine forth
[1:26:23] the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show
[1:26:26] token a token showing a token on display
[1:26:30] to show that he is not dead but in the
[1:26:32] form of the Holy Ghost he's in he's he's
[1:26:36] in his people moving
[1:26:38] moving brother Branham said he said
[1:26:43] he said I and myself can do nothing
[1:26:45] Jesus said but it's my faith in God
[1:26:49] not not Jesus himself not David himself
[1:26:52] but it's my faith in God the substance
[1:26:54] that I always had with him before the
[1:26:57] foundation of the world I come from that
[1:26:59] source and you've come from the same
[1:27:01] Source the prophet said
[1:27:04] who are you revealing the son of man
[1:27:06] again
[1:27:08] he wants you to see your position
[1:27:12] all right
[1:27:13] what was what was Eve
[1:27:15] she was Adam
[1:27:17] and what is what is her position it's so
[1:27:20] good to see ourselves positionally
[1:27:21] placed Christ in you positionally placed
[1:27:26] all right see it's not just a word it's
[1:27:29] a living moving substance a living
[1:27:32] moving word manifested
[1:27:35] all right the faith that was in the word
[1:27:37] is now made manifest and God was in him
[1:27:40] God was he said it's my faith in God in
[1:27:43] God in God my faith in God when were you
[1:27:46] in God when were you a believer
[1:27:48] he that believeth in me shall never
[1:27:50] perish when did you believe
[1:27:52] before the foundation of the world you
[1:27:54] were a believer
[1:27:56] you always were a Believer you always
[1:27:59] were Eternal you always were in Christ
[1:28:01] where are you going then
[1:28:04] if you always were and that's a
[1:28:05] revelation who are you
[1:28:07] and if you know who you are where are
[1:28:09] you going
[1:28:10] your your end
[1:28:16] is expected you haven't expected end

[1:28:22] nothing going to take that what a piece
[1:28:24] what a rest in the time of of judgment
[1:28:26] that somehow Plumbing upon the Earth
[1:28:28] what a peace what a rest to know we're
[1:28:31] going to be taken right out of here in
[1:28:32] us and and what's happening what's
[1:28:34] happening now now we see the Promise
[1:28:36] being fulfilled there's a a going of the
[1:28:39] the brother Brown said his going
[1:28:42] which he said was in The Bride because
[1:28:44] now we see that promise fulfilled
[1:28:48] amen
[1:28:49] the Christ the true headship going in
[1:28:52] coming in his bride now we see it being
[1:28:55] fulfilled he said not going to now we
[1:28:58] are seeing it
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:02] and so where are we going
[1:29:06] right back to the beginning right back
[1:29:08] to the original Eden
[1:29:14] my faith in God
[1:29:16] assures me of that
[1:29:18] amen and God was in him God was in him
[1:29:22] the word made manifest and the word of
[1:29:24] God comes in you if when the word of God
[1:29:27] comes in you it's made manifest for you
[1:29:29] are a Believer and a Believer is
[1:29:34] see the believer is the faith of God
[1:29:37] that moves
[1:29:40] in you
[1:29:42] all right and now we become anointed the
[1:29:46] size of the last day he said
[1:29:48] and now to show that he's not dead the
[1:29:51] resurrection of Jesus Christ but in the
[1:29:52] form of the Holy Ghost he's in his
[1:29:55] people moving
[1:29:57] among his bride what's that moving mean
[1:30:00] Hebrews 4 12 the the word of God is
[1:30:03] quick and Powerful
[1:30:05] that quick and Powerful if you go if you
[1:30:07] have Scofield that quick and Powerful
[1:30:09] means living and operative
[1:30:13] the word of God is living and operative
[1:30:16] where in you brother Branham said the
[1:30:18] little bride today is the word living
[1:30:22] and in action operative
[1:30:26] amen all right
[1:30:29] so he said now
[1:30:32] so you see he's in his people moving
[1:30:34] among his bride with a love affair to
[1:30:36] her pouring out into her himself
[1:30:40] what's he pouring into her himself
[1:30:46] they are becoming one for the wedding
[1:30:48] supper

[1:31:05] with him
[1:31:06] there had to be a marriage and it
[1:31:08] couldn't be a public show
[1:31:11] it was a secret coming a secret going
[1:31:18] a secret rapture
[1:31:22] all right
[1:31:25] all right now we'll just we'll get down
[1:31:29] to the bottom of this and close I'm
[1:31:31] closing
[1:31:32] right on time
[1:31:34] praise the Lord
[1:31:38] now Romans 10 8 I read Romans 10 8 to
[1:31:41] you brother Brown said in the beginning
[1:31:42] was the word the word was with God how
[1:31:44] was it with God thought substance the
[1:31:46] Word was God
[1:31:48] amen are you with me if the Word was God
[1:31:51] who are you
[1:31:52] all right and the word became flesh see
[1:31:55] and dwelt with us God dwelt With Us in
[1:31:59] flesh
[1:32:00] he was the word God's dwelling with us
[1:32:02] today right now in flesh not another
[1:32:05] himself
[1:32:07] amen all right before a word brother
[1:32:11] Brown said same third full third seal
[1:32:13] before a word it's a thought
[1:32:16] all right and a thought has to be
[1:32:19] created
[1:32:22] and a thought has to be created all
[1:32:24] right so God's thoughts that's you the
[1:32:27] substance God's thoughts became creation
[1:32:30] when it was spoke by a word
[1:32:34] Glory
[1:32:35] he doesn't change his pattern what about
[1:32:37] the word and word of faith in you now
[1:32:42] Word of Faith not your word of
[1:32:45] imagination your emotion the word of
[1:32:47] faith
[1:32:48] Revelation substance now watch he said
[1:32:51] here he said then when when that's when
[1:32:54] he presents it he spoke by word that's
[1:32:57] when he presents it to you
[1:33:00] as they thought
[1:33:02] his thought look at what he's presenting
[1:33:05] tonight he's presenting his thought to
[1:33:07] you
[1:33:08] and it's revealed to you
[1:33:11] all right he said then it's still a
[1:33:14] thought like it wasn't God until you
[1:33:17] speak it
[1:33:20] God has not changed his way or behavior
[1:33:25] Glory
[1:33:26] look at the authority we have
[1:33:29] in faith
[1:33:34] in the word
[1:33:36] all right see it comes through the word
[1:33:38] faith comes by hearing the word all
[1:33:40] right now
[1:33:42] so
[1:33:47] all right
[1:33:52] Hebrews 10 23 and let's Stand Together

[1:34:53] first John 5 4 said our faith is the
[1:34:55] victory
[1:34:57] is that right our faith is the victory
[1:34:59] what is what is he said he that is born
[1:35:02] of God overcometh the world and this is
[1:35:04] the victory that overcometh the world

[1:35:13] were
[1:35:14] Eternal you're born again it's a new
[1:35:17] creation you were created by the spoken
[1:35:19] word in this day

[1:35:45] you are himself revealed
[1:35:48] Jesus could do nothing until revealed
[1:35:50] Saint John 5 19 it had to be revealed to
[1:35:54] him by the father that was in him he
[1:35:56] said in myself are I and myself can do
[1:35:59] nothing but what I see my father do and
[1:36:02] he said in Saint John 5 17 my father
[1:36:05] worketh hitherto at that moment and then
[1:36:07] I work why they were one
[1:36:10] all right the same Harmony brother
[1:36:13] Branham said pick up your pen and write
[1:36:14] the same Harmony noticed he was
[1:36:16] prophesying of where we're at right now

[1:36:54] the heavens was a sign of the uniting
[1:36:56] time
[1:36:57] the same Harmony is to exist between
[1:36:59] Christ and his bride same thing as I
[1:37:02] said about Jesus I can do nothing till
[1:37:04] my father reveals it
[1:37:08] my father worketh hitherto and I work
[1:37:11] amen amen

[1:38:21] so he said and he had Faith he relied
[1:38:24] upon knowing he was the word he relied
[1:38:26] upon what he was he relied in knowing
[1:38:29] that he was the word and he had faith in
[1:38:31] God who made him the word he was God the
[1:38:33] word and they was in him and that gave
[1:38:36] him Faith because he understood his
[1:38:38] position then cannot we rely upon what

[1:38:46] these signs shall follow them that
[1:38:48] believe he had faith in what he was
