good to see brother paul with us god bless you brother told him to take his liberty tonight so you don't like what i'm speaking tonight blaming amen amen i'm a little bit intimidating and i i'm sorry that i intimidate anybody if you misunderstand but that's not my heart you know god made us the way we are he likes upset sometimes the people because he got their eyes too much of flesh amen god does what he wants with his people you believe he's sovereign then let him be sovereign let god be god amen amen praise the lord it's good to be here tonight i want to continue with herein is love part two we took part one last wednesday and you that were here we subtitled it where were you where were you before the world before the foundation of the world where were you when god laid the foundations of the world where was you we went in to back into that and in the word and found out that you were his thought you were the thought of the eternal he existed in his thoughts so i want to go to first john again take that as our scripture once again in first john 4. and before we do that i'd like to have a word of prayer if you'll stand with me i'd appreciate it our heavenly father is so good to know and to call you father lord you knew us before the foundation of the world and we were known of you and you knew us and we have been known you lord only we didn't realize the knowing then but now you've made it manifest by thy word and we realize that we knew you we knew you we were in you and you knew us and if you hadn't known us there's no way we could know you and we thank you lord for that knowing a knowing that's not an imagination a knowing that's not some some some mental conception but a knowing that is absolutely absolutely positively eternal and it's revelation and it's a true faith we thank you for the unveiling of that to our hearts and and that something that seed that lord that you planted in us that could be quickened to become the living word we thank you for that lord we know that it's not what we've done but it's god's achieved your achievement and it's nothing to do with our achievement but it's your achievement and we thank you for this lord now bless your word we pray encourage the believers reveal yourself we ask you to come in revelation and reveal your word to our hearts that we may please you through your faith by your love in jesus christ's name amen amen so herein is love part two my subject here is the new creation you the subject is the new creation you amen and we know that that you can't be any other the new creation is only the creation of the word there's only one subject that can create and that's god amen and so when he created when he created and brought forth that which is in your heart quickened it we'll come into that more we realize that's who you are that's you and so we just are thankful that he has he has brought this forth to show us that before the world began we were in his thinking we'd never sinned in the first place amen you say well we were sinners that's right you had to be born again but i'm talking about after the birth amen it's just the devil pointing you to the wrong side not that new creation all right so we let's turn to first john 4 begin verse 4 once again you are of god there you are herein is love you are of god little children and have overcome them that them is antichrist spirit that's so close to the real that it would try it would deceive the elect if it was possible because that spirit that that spirit can be anointed amen amen how many know that by the genuine holy ghost amen but they can't hear and receive the word for their season they can't receive all the word remember we said the evidence of you being a child of god is that you're in the word all the way the evidence that you're a seed of god is that you're in the word all the way you will be in that word all the way and you will hear and receive the word for your season amen amen that's how you knew that you were in the thought of god before the foundation of the world so first john 4 4 you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that's a that's a personal pronoun he a person greater is he the person in you than he that is in the world amen so you're conquering you have conquered the devil you're defeating a a conquered enemy because you're only taking and possessing what god's already given to you you're more than an overcomer all right so in in chapter 4 verse 7 through 10 beloved let us love one another for love is of god now this love we're talking about here is not filio it is agape love filio is a friendship love filio has condition but this is not filial this is agape this is divine love and there's only one divine person that can be divine love and that's god himself all right so beloved let us love one another this love that we're loving with each other for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god see those two loves can be close you can love god in your spirit amen and still not have the love of god in your heart that's right all right you that they're in the message and reading the message you know that's true amen all right then they said excuse me verse 7 and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth there you are and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god so how are you going to love how are you going to have the love of god how are you going to express the love of god you have to know god god has to be in you amen all right so he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is for god is love amen what is god love that's right he that loveth okay in this was manifested the love of god toward us in this god is love and this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son god in some form only begotten son into the world that we might live through him who was he he was the word made flesh when before he became flesh he was theophany before he became flesh he was a word body we bypassed that and came directly from the thought of god amen but you'll never be able to hear or receive the word unless you were the thought of god and i don't want that to pass from you amen you had to be in god's thinking in order to receive his word for this hour you had to be in god's thinking to be the word amen amen all right so in order to become the word brother brown said we be as we as we receive the word we be as we as we receive the word we become the word amen all right now verse 10 herein is love i'm sorry i didn't finish verse 9. yeah that we might love through him that's right that we might the son in the world that we might live through him here in herein is love now there's my title herein is love herein means right this this place this location this place herein is love not that we loved god amen i'm going to bring you a quote here in just a minute not that we love god but that he loved us now that ought to that ought to let the pressure off right there he loved you nothing shall be able to separate you brother trevor from that love nothing can separate you from that love if you know that if you how many say you genuinely in your heart know you love god but how did that become he had the first loved you then if he first loved you how are you going to be separated from that love you were in the very love of you were in god himself you were in that love himself you were in that love to begin with before the foundation of the world when there was nothing to even worship god god eternal spirit you were there existing in his thoughts of himself the thoughts of what of himself love perfect love god is love god is perfect love and you can't enter this place where where we know that you'll go to where where our bodies waiting for us if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have a body way you can't enter that place without having perfect love so god will see to it that your love is perfected but when you're born again you have that love but it needs to grow i'll get into that i want to go ahead of myself because that's another i just i don't know how many uh parts we're going to have in this but i just have to break it down i'd like to give you the whole thing but i don't want to do that lord hasn't quickened that to me but i may be three it may be two more parts it may be three more parts i don't know what it is but but listen now let's go the tenth verse again herein is love not that we love god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins sin matter is over with he that's born of god does not he that's the new creation he that's his race does not commit sin because the seed of god can't sin this whole body out here can fall and fail but you're looking don't look at that because that's not the identity that god identifies you by he identifies you through the blood as being perfect you're sinless and you're in him and the seed has come to life his seed amen you pass from death unto life amen now what's my next i didn't i didn't say what if you're the new creation is you so then you can let off the pressure you can let off the pressure i don't care what how great the pressure is you can let off the pressure by dependent upon believing that created word living the word living in you it's a person it's christ in you amen all right so let's go on keep reading verse 16. i'm not 13. go down to 13 hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us hereby we know that no is not imagined i hope it's right i hope it's so it's revelation hereby we know we hereby know we or we know that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of just any old spirit his spirit god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth or dynamics on mechanics the only true worship you can only wait you can worship him you have to be in him you have to be in where he put his name you have to be in the in his own choosing chosen play you must be in his chosen church and that isn't this building and that isn't the next one down the street either his chosen church there's brother bram says there's only one church he chose only one church you can worship him in amen a body has thou prepared me lord praise the lord hebrews 10 5. a body has thou prepared me amen all right that body is is himself all right now so we go to 13 i think i read yes 16 through 19 for we have known and believed the love that god hath given hath to us god is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god what is the spirit in you hereby we know we love we know we we know we we dwell in him and he and us because he had given us of his spirit then we're dwelling in love you can't have love without him in you and you in him if you if you were if he's in you you were in him amen amen all right now so and we know and believe the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god god in and god in him he and you i in you you and me see all right herein is our love made perfect amen herein is our love in what in him amen we're going to come more and more into this growing up into a stature amen all right later on not tonight now we have so herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment how may know you've entered into the day of judgment it's already been brought already showed us judgment has begun the prophet said it's it's started we're in the day of judgment and the bride's being judged and has been judged by the open book she's not going to stand at judgment being judged by any book she is the open book that's been already opened and now we stand under that judgment and god's judgment of that book has declared us perfect in him amen all right now so we have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us all right you may be seated on page 354 355 a portion here of this i'll read more out of this later as we go along in these these parts but but on page 354 church age book i'm reading out of the blue book and he said this he said he's reading the scripture found in revelation 3 19 as many as i love he said many as i love i rebuke and chasten beselas therefore and repent and brother branham comes down in about the second paragraph he called the first paragraph of that page let's examine the first phrase as many as i love in the greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun i okay i love he does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make jesus the object of human love we must never make jesus the object of human filial human love now philia i'm not against it it's a real love you have love for your wife a feeling of love and we went into that if you want to hear more i can't go back all the time but we we showed what that was on on the wednesday before so i'm part one so we come down here now no he said he said it is in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of god it's the many that are the loved ones of god it is his love in question amen it's not your loving question it's his love and question all right it's his love and question not ours there just said he said it right there not ours so once again we find ourselves glorying in his salvation his purpose his purpose we'll come to that in a minute scripturally his purpose and his plan we are conf we and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of god amen as he said in romans 9 13 jacob have i loved esau have i hated but jacob have i emphasis i loved esau as we said was a better mural man if you were to choose between one or the other you'd chosen esau looking at the physical fleshly works you'd have chosen esau because jacob was a shyster but there's one thing he desired his heart that birthright no matter how he had to get it what he had to lose to get it he wanted that birthright and god honored that showing in type what the true birth white would be that we would hunger and desire and someday we staggered into a mission we staggered over here and we come into a place when we heard the word and when the truth was presented to us and the word was preached for the season of word the truth of the word we then come alive because something inside of us registered that's what i'm looking for why because you were that and in that before the foundation of the world amen amen it just took the word to be brought to you amen and you responded as a little eagle because you were an eagle to begin with and you heard the voice of the eagle my sheep know my voice amen amen so you don't have to worry about sheep getting anything just preach the message the sheep will hear the voice the rest of them can't hear it because they're not sheep amen amen we're going after and i'm not here to to say this one's in that one's out don't just preach what preach what's in and let the let that decipher who's in and out amen all right now so we see here as we go on he said the sovereignty okay jacob i loved okay and and esau hated for for children not being born neither having done any good or evil the devil will beat you up as long as that once you start to fall i thought you were the i thought and you begin to reason yeah i don't feel like it i don't feel like a christian forget your feelings has nothing to do with the inside of the inside you don't meet god by feelings you don't meet god by your senses you can't even touch him by that the only way you can reach and touch god is by faith amen amen that's right he kept it that way he showed at the beginning that way he he he judged the cain and abel by that one had revelation and that's what god accepted so it was that way from the beginning it's going to end that way right here at the end amen it's faith that made the difference revelation of god's will made the difference and showed who was his seed and who wasn't right amen amen now true revelation brother brown said will always be vindicated by the word of god you that person can say i'll have revelation but it's not proving the word it's not backed by the word because if it's true revelation then scriptures will come alive to it it opens this it opens that it's over here it's over there and god's obligated to show that if it's a real revelation amen how many know you you see something and then i'll hear it's over here and god's bringing that to your remembrance and here it's over here and back over here oh yes this is what the prophet said and that's what he said and this is the scripture amen that's right all right so so he's going on to say here just to draw a purpose here that the purpose of god see for the children not being born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of god according to election so if it's election you didn't have one thing to do with it quit injecting yourself into the word and just take the word your reasoning i'm saying rejecting yourself your feelings your reasoning your senses leave it alone i just i'll just bring it to you to reality of it that's not even you the real you amen that's it that's it yes that's it let off the pressure hallelujah let off the pressure all right now so we see here he said for he said this love he said that that election the god according to election might stand not of works now i believe in works brother branham believed in works but faith without works or works without faith is a dead work that's right faith has got to testify faith testifies or excuse me testified of abraham's faith god justified him by the faith then justified him by his works who justified him by faith amen god did but his works were testifying of the revelation he had whether he saw it or not he knew god had given it to him because that word a promise was made substance in him it was absolutely substance he knew it it was real right that's what faith is we'll get into that just a moment here a little more god will allow me to do it not just keep treading on over here in these places amen all right now now just one more thing here he said the purpose of god stands an election which is actually opposite to works anything man has in himself or anything that man has in himself oh i've skipped something here not of works but of him that calleth the love this love is elective love how did he prove that he loved you by by calling you amen and then positioning you placing you as a son so his love is proven not your actions not how you feel i did this and i should have done this and i couldn't do this and i did that has nothing to do with it remember the word of god is going to separate the difference between soul and spirit that's right it's going to tell you who you really are and who you're not the word does that that's why we continue to say feed on the open book keep feeding on the word amen because it's through that that faith comes by hearing the word showing that that faith of god's own faith lays in the word amen it's got its resting place in the eternal word of god all right so he said the purpose of god he said his love for you i'll just put it you he said them it's you his love it is it is his love for the elect his love for them the elect you is apart from human merit well that's a big word it's apart from human merit amen for it says the purpose of god stands in election the purpose of god stands in election not what you chose he chose and because he chose you could that's choose because there was something he placed in you by his choosing that would say yes to this word because you had his your thought his his thought of himself you were in that thought amen all right and that thought of himself was eternal so that thought of you had to be eternal now how is eternal going to have a beginning or end when it's identified that you are eternal then how you're going to come to a place where you all of a sudden lose it and i'm no more and i can't make it right that's right you've done made it right your future's clear and you're gonna have struggles and trials and testings to build character to bring you to the stature that these that these virtues would be living in you and they're capped off by himself they're capped off not not you didn't have us you know you don't receive the holy ghost which is the seal of god and then later on get sealed no that's more that that ceiling there is a positioning a placing an adoption hallelujah you're already born again when those virtues begin to grow i'm getting into my subject later on but just let it just take that much of it all right all right now so the purpose so it's apart from human merit actually opposite to works now what i said if you'll go back and search the scripture you'll find out brother brown and made that clear it was it was it was it was the i'll i just want to go there right now i'll get that later all right okay now then he says herein is set forth herein is now set forth the love of god he desired to in love a family of his own a family of sons like himself amen all right you know i keep building on this but i'm wanting to make it known to you what did i say last sunday not to forget what is love what does what that's not it wait a minute oh i'm sorry what was the ques the question was what never fails anybody tell me love never fails love never fails let me say it again let it go under the fifth rib love never fails let it come in you for my title is herein all right now turn of me to ephesians and i want to read just some quick scripture i won't spend as much time we know that the bible says that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world chosen in who then let off the pressure well i know we face pressure every day don't tell me you don't face pressure the battle today is the mind battle the pressure battle amen it's it's constantly you know one time you just gave your life if you'd but now it's satan bombarding on every side bombarding your mind trying to get you away from this this focus this single eye focus on his presence in words and deeds and it depends on how much you're wanting to feed on things that don't satisfy how much you want to feed on things that are not true amen better faults you're going to find yourself more and more depressed and down why because you're feeding on that i say let's turn focus let her i be single and get our focus on him get our focus on his presence get our focus and dependency on him and us and be careful i mean paul said you better flee idolatry don't you let nothing come between you and god that's right car land houses money on and on and on and on and on your senses your feelings everything else don't you put that and don't you bow to that put that in front of god's word amen and fear is a great big one amen all right all right i'll just stop there on that one all right so ephesians chapter one and let's take verse i had marked off this verse nine so we know that we know that we predestinate us unto adoption and later on we're going to go find out that you've already received the spirit of adoption when you're born again you've already received the spirit of adoption that'll take you to a complete adoption and placing and positioning brother branham said i'm so happy lo so glad i'm so glad lord to see ourselves positionally placed in christ all right but coming back here to verse 9 now having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath past tense purposed in himself there's your purpose he purposed that in himself amen all right then in verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that's the dispensation we're in in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ he said how can that happen because seven seals were opened all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen amen amen all right verse 11 in whom in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will 16th verse 17th verse wait a minute now yeah 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him that's not mental knowledge that's god's knowledge amen which won't flaunt itself right it's not puffed up satan's knowledge intellectual knowledge knowledge that's an intellectual conception of the word will puff up did you know that yeah yes sir that's her that's the scripture knowledge puffeth up well that's not god's knowledge amen all right amen now so it always remains humble knowing where it received it it didn't manufacture it it couldn't manufacture it it was given by grace and by the way his grace is sufficient so we can let off the pressure his grace is sufficient for his strength is made perfect in weakness but don't make your weaknesses an excuse for doing nothing but realize you're weak and surrender to him and let him be what he is and meant you to be and take of himself and quicken himself and then make himself flesh in you and be in action because when you when you when you can truly be able to cover two wings and cover your face and cover your feet the next thing when you're when you've got those in place then you can be in action amen all right now so we're getting verse 19 i think we're on verse 19. and what is the exceeding and and what is going right along with verse 18 yeah i didn't read 18. okay the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance what it is in is his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe what's the what's the criteria there to who believe according to the working of his mighty power listen i'll tell you right now you're going to fear whatever you believe you know that if you believe it you're really gonna you'll either reverence god and believe him and have a genuine respect and fear or you're gonna fear the devil and believe in him whatever you believe that's what you'll fear amen all right you have to believe it you're going to show respect to whatever you believe and what you believe you can have what you believe amen and you'll get what you believe absolutely so you have one thing to do you've been given authority to shut the door to the devil okay shut the door then don't believe him take the word you got to believe one or the other yes there's only two spirits yes i know why i'm saying that i go off on this side and i just come back but i just said lord that's in your hands all right so the and if you go to you don't have to turn here but and ephesians 3 11 it says according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord amen hallelujah all right john 1 1 said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god the word was god and the word became and let's go to john 1 again let's go over there and read 13 and 14. i want you to read this first john or not first john saint john 1 13 as many as received him verse 12 he gave power to them to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born is what we get to which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man how were they born of god all right god is what the word he created the word he created everything by the word it was the word to begin with it's the word it'll end with he's alpha he's omega amen it's always the word it's always been the word the original is the word anything added to or taken from that is a perversion of the devil amen amen so you see but you're born of god and and as a conjunction tying these two scriptures together and the word was made flesh and dwell among us so you're born of god the word is made flesh and not only was made flesh it's now made flesh and dwelling among us because the seed had to be in you to be birthed you had to have him we'll get to that in just a moment all right and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father his saint the same glory because jesus said i'll they'll receive my glory i'll share my glory with them and it said the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth i'm trying too hard to get through this i'm going too fast but all right first peter 1 23 and we'll find out how your birth let's go over here to first peter i may not get as far as i think tonight so we'll just take it part three okay first peter 1 23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible how by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so so the the spiritual new birth is a creative act of god it's a spoken word amen the spoken word is what brings the birth that's why when you came into this hour this season there was a word to meet you you were predestinated to live the word for the hour you were predestinated to be the message but it had to be spoken and when it was spoken he spoke for you to come into existence he spoke for his thought to become materialized amen amen that's letting off the pressure when you realize you're that thought now become material god becomes tangible still becoming tangible all the way to a new body change but that seed has been quickened the word's been quickened and every seed the bible said in first corinthians 15 has its own body so you have a body waiting amen this whole body here is just the shuck that's bearing the true seed word of god living just like it was in mary amen mary was shocked mary herself was a shock but mary bore her mary borid but inside of her was the creative word a creative body spoken word natural now we're spiritual it's a spiritual spoken word you're you're brought to birth by the word he has to speak it in your season and you receive it and hear it there comes the baptism with the holy ghost there comes the new birth amen amen amen amen amen all right so body has been prepared hallelujah you are the words see you bet you the book was the sealed book but you're the words in the book amen but they had to be sun sealed but they couldn't be unsealed until this day so without us they couldn't be made perfect because what we have today is the perfect amen amen amen all right so you're the word the word has been opened they the book was sealed these words were sealed and you were sealed until your season with it until the season you can't be the word unless you were his thought at the beginning before the world began or at the beginning that's right amen so god has unveiled himself you are not another you are himself revealed or unveiled manifested in bright form hallelujah the new birth is jesus christ revealed in you yeah because brother bran was asked what is it what is it i'm born again but what is it what is the birth the lamb said is jesus christ revealed in you amen where is he where's love all right now that just kind of snuck that in there i've been building on that so we'll just keep building all right now ephesians 1. ephesians 1 23. let's take 22nd verse with it 22 and 23 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church how may believe that church is the bride all right verse 23 which is his body body has self-prepared me which is his body the fullness of him you are the fullness of him that filleth all in all his body is the fullness of him christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing now you see where we're at remember the title is herein is love all right now i want to read from the church age book again now before i do that i want to go back here and pick up some scriptures colossians 1 27 i just you know turned to it it's very familiar that well babe we better turn to it i know the scripture but it just i think it's good to turn verse 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory amen the hope of glory christ in you all right then see god came down and the character of god was christ he was the reflection he was god made visible notice god made visible because christ is what the mystery of god revealed made visible and that's not so much with natural vision as it's a spiritual vision it's made visible you see him he said you'll see me others won't see me but you'll see me all right now he's in the beginning was god he wasn't even god then no god's an object of worship only thing he was was eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and word was made manifest what is it it's all god becoming tangible i'm coming to that word tangible in a minute it was only it's all god becoming tangible or other words can be touched amen it's all god becoming tangible amen i've got to find my place it's all god becoming tangible and you are a part of god amen and jesus come to redeem those that was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world it was in god's thoughts it was what is the book of life himself his own life what his life had made up who makes up his life it's his life it's his life revealed all right and that's what he and it was all it was in god's thoughts that's what he come to redeem and them as soon as it strikes them what's what's striking them word for the season they're hearing faith they're hearing the word preached all right then it strikes them they see it because the life is in there where is it it's in the seed amen it's not a dead seed it's a dermatitis seed i guess you'd the term would be germinated there's no germatite german dermatitis seed a dermatitis seed right now but if the life isn't in there then what can they do see they don't see it they don't understand it they don't see it they'll never see it now don't you let the devil jump on your shoulder right now because what are you basing that on what's the devil basing it on he's going to lie to you and say remember you're not seeing it but don't you dare try to figure it out if you want to see it get to the source and start feeding the devil will try to accuse everything he can don't you let him do it do you believe what god said about you yes then trust him yes and go to the source and start feeding on the source you came out of that's right that's right we came out of the same source we came out of the same source that jesus christ came out of and he was god himself made flesh all right that's right okay now but if the okay seventh seal revealed or unveiled this the whole thing is jesus said at that day you'll know that i'm in the father the father and me i in you and you and me amen you see who you are don't you do you let off the pressure you say oh brother david you just don't know the pressure i go through you can let off the pressure i'm not saying the pressure isn't going to come it's going to try to bombard you but you've got a pressure escape you can you've got something loaded off you've got a place to go go back to the rock go back to the revelation god is my revelation god is my rock that's the bible psalm 62 god is my rock he only is my rock he's my refuge he's my salvation in him i shall not be moved can't move it and just you were put in that cleft right there just stay right in there come right back with the devil and say i don't know what you think about it i'm not depending on how i feel and how i think about it it's what god said about it and that's an amen in me that's revealed to me i'm going to stand there with it even if i give it a right mental attitude it's got to be quickened to me then i'm going to give that word because it's in me to do so i'll give it a right mental attitude and position where it belongs and god will even bring it to pass that's the truth amen all right so now see so like he said the whole thing the whole thing the father in me i and you you and me the whole thing is god becoming material you know what the word material means substance that's right tangible substance okay okay like a husband and wife becoming one together god and his church becoming one and brother branham after the opioid seal said they are. how could he say that because he was looking at the scriptures the opening of the word knowing and saying and pronouncing it that's what it is oneness [Applause] amen she is one all right say yeah lord i believe that yes but i sure don't feel it forget your feeling do you believe that yes do you believe it it's a revelation that's quickened to me lord i know that's right i'm not depending on this then i'm looking at the inner man i'm looking on the inside man that inside man is perfect it's love if you love god what are you going to do have faith if you love god you're going to trust him and when something revealed god reveals his word to you stand right there on it and confess it he'll he's a high priest of the confession of our faith hold fast to the confession of your faith amen faith revelation hold fast and you will hold fast because why it's substance all right you don't have it just an imagination so let's turn to hebrews well well you can turn if you want hebrews 11 first verse hebrews 11 verse 1. now faith is the substance now faith is what the substance of things hoped for say well i get it i hope i get it i hope i get it that's not faith faith is a substance i know this is a desk how do i know i can feel it i can see it you can't talk me out of it substance it's substance that's what revelation is that's why brother brown said faith is a revelation over and over again so revelation cannot be overemphasized the need of revelation amen we have to be asking god for revelation you have not because you ask not because you're fearing your own senses you're fearing something you feel many times i don't feel god but i know he's in me but i'm not depending on how i feel not depending on my reasoning i'm not giving my opinion and connecting it with the word let go of all of that and take god at his word and hold that steady and water it amen if he doesn't water his crops i can tell you right now he's not going to have a crop you've got to water it you plant it water it plant it in the holy spirit and water it with faith plant it in the right ground amen it'll bring forth that's right that's exactly right okay now so hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence it's substance you can't talk me out of it i've got the evidence this is the desk god said he would do god said he healed me i believe that i accept that yes how do i believe it it's revealed to me god said it was finished work it was done then calvary by his by his stripes i'm healed he said i'm already healed can you heal me lord no i've already done it then i have received it amen when i receive it that settles it he said so and i say amen regardless of what i feel regardless what i see regardless of anything else he healed me he healed me that's all the more i need hallelujah that's right why because that scripture that promise has become substance it's in me as substance and it's evidence i have the evidence i have the substance i have the evidence it's got to be manifested what manifests god's word faith you can't work it up pump it up work it up pump it up it's just faith god revealed that to me lord revealed this to me and he reveals it to you you've got it that's it nobody can talk you out of it it's substance all right in psalm 62 he's my rock now in things that are to be 12 5 65 he said and that's the way oh excuse me first corinthians 6 17. we don't have they can't go the whole scripture but he that is joined unto the lord he's a joint you know how the bible said he's joined to a harlot is one flesh is that right one body so if you join yourself to a spiritual harlot what are you going to be let alone the natural harlot but a spiritual adulterous woman if you take that on and join yourself with that you'll become that adulterous fornicating woman amen but he that is joined to the lord the bible said is one spirit hallelujah that's it he that is joined to the lord is one spirit there is your identification amen hallelujah that's the token amen amen and when the tokens applied it shows your price has been paid it's your redeemed your redeemed property your redeemed possession but you've got to have the token to identify you're redeemed because you can claim all you want you're redeemed and that's good you can claim it but until the token come it's not recognized your redemption is not recognized yet you've got to be claimed and the token is the claim that's why the token did not come in full effect until after the opening of the seals hallelujah there you are that's why it came into full effect token's always been there but it didn't come into full effect until the seals were open now it's your assurance you're in the book you have that life you have the very literal life expressing itself something you can't do in yourself he does it through you amen amen you say i can't live it he never asked you to live it as a man he asked he said you give away to me and i'll live it i'll come in and live it i'll come in and speak it i'll come in and walk it i'll come in and do these things i will do it amen oh hallelujah you can let off any kind of pressure i want to get to a place here and it's just you bear with me i should be getting this close to finish he says this and that's the way the old body is well body this you live in an old body but the man that used to live in that old body that that that uh what do they call those sly little uh badger that badger no longer lives here that badger's been killed that badger's gone it may look like an old badger amen it may it may be dying an old badger you know rough and an old german he talks kind of rough and everything and very intimidating and i don't want to be intimidating but if it takes intimidation to wake you up [Laughter] like brother paul said he got i make him a little mad i upset his apple cart maybe i intimidate him that's not my purpose not my purpose at all all right so don't let ever don't put your don't get them to look at man and let man do anything the word does it then just rejoice the word uncovers it uncovers doesn't it i can imagine john the baptist sitting out there mud up to his knees and little skin on him yelling to the top of his lips i wonder how many he intimidated i wonder how many that jesus did when he took ropes and looked upon him with anger he looked upon him with anger think of that so don't get up tight with people because we all have mistakes we all have failures we all do this we all do that but when you meet him and you know you're in him amen just let go and let god use you the way he wants to use you and if anything isn't right he'll show you is that right you bet he will you bet brother brown said just let him get on the inside if you start to do any little thing wrong he'll show you he's your guide questions and answers he answered that question amen all right now so he that's joined the lord's one spirit and that's his way as the wiz with the old body it's bore the image of the heavenly but it's not you yet it's not you praise the lord yet it's not you you are on the inside of that body you comma the spirit of god is on the inside of that body who are you i'm going to read about that in just a moment probably close right there with that in the church age but you're the new creation you're his race all right that's what makes the outside that you the spirit of god on the inside of that body is what makes the outside come into subjection because the inside is pulling it see bringing it in line with the word of god you're inside you yourself your being philippians 2 13 it said is god which worketh in you both to will and to do will and do of his good pleasure praise the lord can you trust it yes all right galatians 2 20 says i was crucified with christ paul said yet i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me she's no longer i living the devil is just beating on a dead man it's not me living it's christ in me living that's where i stand that's my identification so next time you make a failure and fall and god allowed it to happen he pre-planned it i'll just pull right over here to what we want to get to and i'll just put this part of it here he said you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance to a believer it's all ordained of god amen god wanted to show himself mighty in you so he let you go up through struggles it's a few failures do you think the word failed then who failed wasn't the word right aren't you the word this isn't the real you who failed you didn't the old man did oh i say you might have let it yeah but god's right there the blood covers it you just apply the blood and go on god don't even see it i may know that god can't look at through the blood and see you a failure he sees you as perfectly sinless he doesn't have any other thought about you because you're in christ is christ sinless is christ perfect is christ the word is he the revealed word made flesh who is he amen that's it all right now i'll just read that portion i was going to try to get the things that are to be tonight but i'm not going to make it i'll just pick it up again but i want to read this part you bear with me just a few minutes this is in this is in the in the church age book page 336 i want to read the scripture in revelations 3 14 and i told brother alex i didn't know if i'd get those when i'd get to him but here brother alex here i am but i had at the beginning now starting to come way down here towards the end revelations 3 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodicean right these things saith the amen what is amen so be it final absolute it's the end of argument it's the amen that's it okay these things say at the amen we know that's jesus christ these things sayeth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of the creation now god didn't create himself he didn't need a creator god's eternal but what is this it's the creation of god in flesh amen he becomes flesh dwelling among us all right so he was the firstborn or the beginning of the creation of god now brother branham explains all this if you want to read it on page 336 i'm trying to save some time he's the beginner or the author of the creation of god he is a creator jesus is god the very god he is a creator all things were made by him without him was nothing made that was made anything without him was not anything made that was made he is the one of whom said genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created heavens and earth it was in the word it was the word to begin with the word is the original seed and that's what you are you're a spoken word birth amen all right we covered that now now he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last stage he calls himself the author of the creation of god there this is another creation this has to do with the church the bride this is another creation hallelujah creation creation this is another creation all right i want you to go with me just real quick over to revelations 1 5. i want to get these scriptures before i get too enclosed in this revelations 1 5 and jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us hallelujah and washed us from our sins in his own blood that's a perfect blood yes and if the perfect blood is loosing you then the loosing is complete there is now therefore no condemnation them that are in christ jesus who have that life to prove they've come through that blood that's what the token gives amen no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus and those that are in christ jesus walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's what the devil hates if i can just get you on the flesh side but see we've had a word that told us what the soul is and what the spirit is amen hallelujah my my my what a message all right now so then we go we go to one more here i want to get in that's in colossians 1 18 i think we i may not have to read let me look at this first because that that may be already pretty well covered okay and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead pretty much said the same thing in revelation 1 5. he's the firstborn from the dead firstborn from the dead passed from death to life he raised again because i live you live also because i live you live also then what does that make you the resurrection and the life you are on the inside of you right now christ in you you are the resurrection and the life there i'll say it again you are the resurrection and the life amen hallelujah let off the pressure that's right you're that new creation all right can you give me just a just a hair more all right okay so he is the that this he is standing amidst the church he's the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride she then stands perfect within and without in his sight no fault there is no fault in her he cannot see one fault then we need to look through god's eyes there we let off the pressure because you are that creation all right now we come right back around here said he said heavenly he that is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his own body was born in the natural i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body and what about the spiritual cells he created inside of you amen that's right all right now you know that body's waiting because it's testified you already met it your theophany you've met it you haven't entered into it yet but you met it because when the word become alive in you you've met your theophany that word body that word form body you're going to go into if you go before the resurrection amen are you with me i didn't lose you on that all right now now watch and said lo he said now so it wasn't nothing of mary that he created the last saddened by he said he just said lo a body has thou father prepared for me god not mary provided that body god not david provided that body because it's in me like it was in mary this is an old shuck amen it's just a carrier hallelujah just a carrier but the shucks dying the chuck has moved out of the way so the word can manifest itself amen what are we bearing children we're pregnated we've been in union with jesus christ and we're bearing word children that's it a spoken word child that's exactly what we're bearing praise the lord hallelujah i'll start preaching here in a minute all right all right now he said mary was just the human incubator she was the pentecostal shock she carried the holy ghost and brought him to birth it was a god man he it was a god man well so is the bride well outside she's nothing but man but inside she's more than a man amen that's right all right so he was now he was the new creation he was the son of god he was the new creation man and god met and joined that ought to settle it man and god met and joined it was through him that we could enjoy this life see he was the first of the new race he was the first of the new race he is the head of this new race and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the oversight which is the preeminence can you give him the oversight whether you understand it or not whether you understand it whether your senses understand it look regardless of how radical it is he said so he said he would be he's in you he's guiding you can you let go and just let him lead and say lord i'll follow i'm not going to try to figure out how you're leading me i know you're leading me i know that i know you're in me and you're guiding me you're my shepherd i shall not have a want that won't be met all my needs other words will be men it's not wants this need but it's i will have no lack praise the lord he's just wanting to see what you're going to do with your mistake and your failure he's wanting to see what you're going to do he's glorified he's already in you he said just rest in me trust in me follow me take up your cross deny yourself and follow me amen when you know that you know you've passed from death into life you've met him face to face and he's in you then what have you got to worry about follow him give it to him give your life to him give all to him amen glory hallelujah all right now now okay i've got to close i'm just about done with this much of it there you can see now watch i'm coming to a point here that in all things he might have the preeminence if any man be in christ he is a new creature corinthians 5 17 second corinthians 5 17 he is a new creation he's a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that that though man was the of the old order or creation now in union with christ he has become the new creation of god for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus unto good works and remember those good works he hath already before ordained you'd walk in them so let off the pressure all right now and you put on the new man put you on the new man which after god has created and which after god is created you see the beginning god creating himself into his body amen in a body created is righteousness and true holiness the new creation now watch what he says here the new creation is not the old creation made over right or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is the new creation listen carefully here we're coming to something real good right here he said what it's exactly what it says it's a it is the nuclear it it says it it this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation see it's his race another race the beginning of that race see and brother branham called it a super race pick up your pen and write brother brown didn't call it that he wrote out what god said it's a super race she'll be a super peep a super race all right it is another creation listen now distinct from the old one separated different set apart from the old one all right it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer i'm reading this real slow so we don't miss it no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh hallelujah hallelujah no longer is he dealing with david by way of flesh that was under the law amen is that right no longer is he dealing by way of the flesh that's how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issue came the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purposed a new creation he's the first of that creation he was god created in the form of a man he was god created in the form of a man now by his spirit he's creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god this is the true revelation of god amen this was his purpose come back to purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look down in the last to the last stage right now when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation what form is he in the midst of the church if we go back into revelations 1 we find he's dressed in a long road we find his paps are about with a golden girdle and brother branham said he's in the form of his bride yes he is amen i've got the quote if you ever want it he's in the form of his bride that's his bride there he said but he's the son of man in bride form standing in the midst of his church judge white hair who's going to judge the world well you say the word will judge the world son of man will judge the world but who's he doing it through amen and if we can find where that is then we'll see where love is amen all right now so this was his purpose took form through election members to election not human instrumentality not human not human merit see he's the author of this new creation of god his sovereign power his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation praise the lord are one of them one of them one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them amen is that right yes you're that new creation who's the new creation you the spirit of god in you the word living and operative and a discerner the thoughts and intents and dividing us under maryland bone amen and of soul and spirit thank god if we didn't have that we wouldn't know who we are if we hadn't had the opening of the seal we'd never see the fullness of himself revealed the bride is the finished mystery of god boy that places it places where his throne is it puts where he's running and what his house is and where is his temple and where does he work where do we worship him at where he put his name where'd he put his name i guess if you're married to him you know already put his name in his body in his church amen that's right yeah she was mrs adam part of mr adam yeah that's right this is mrs jesus christ only one difference in that name mr and mrs one letter one's mr one's misses mrs and mr all right the only difference between you and him is that you by pastor theophany come down here to be tried and tested when you heard the word you become that word because you were his thought to begin with oh my hallelujah god i'm so glad okay i'm closing he brought it to how else could he know he was standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his brother and if he did not make sure all things oh excuse me he predestinated because he predestinated them to adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will his omniscience and omnipotence he brought by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know remember and i didn't get to that scripture but i will another time but in peter the second chapter he said he said that he was the he was he's the foundation the cornerstone and the coroner became the head alpha omega amen and it's in the form of a pyramid amen you can't go any higher than the capstone and it's coming to a fine edge right there to a point amen praise the lord amen how many want more of what what we're talking about start feeding on the word start praying start reading your bible start feeding in the message start hearing the messages amen don't let these other things in your life take possession over it let go of your political nonsense of news you're not going to hear a bunch of garbage anyway you don't even know half the time they're telling you the truth or not all you've got is one side that's the truth oh well that news said it that said no it's not your absolute the word is if you get your if you get your absolute your thinking upon the word and stay with that let your eye be single i'm not saying you shouldn't but you just feed it we want to feed on that and then you wonder why you're so depressed and you're down amen all right it doesn't change now if you're born again this doesn't change inside of you but it ought to waken you up because you want to stay in relation with him you want to walk in his presence think on things that are true and lovely and good report be any praise any virtue think on these things okay i didn't mean to say all that but anyway it's been said all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew i like that let me read it again all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass amen amen and ephesians 1 11 said in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestined according the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will hallelujah brother braham said aren't you glad you belong to him amen amen he that is in you in the soul that inside of the inside that inner inside man he that is in you in the soul is your absolute it's the amen the ultimate your peace where you let off the pressure what he said or says that faith in you is the belief that faith in you is the believer is so be it that settles it that substance that's the amen amen right let's stand together let me read this last quote brother branham said right here and then we'll have to come back to pick it up in things that are to be next time if you leave that word you have left god if you leave that word you have left god thus he is presenting himself to the church and indeed to all ages of all ages i am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't never don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which i'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself then that word also is a revelation of you amen because you're in his thought you and when it became word you were in that hidden in that word for your decreed season amen amen amen amen amen then you came forth in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member come forth it became expressed and took us place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine designation she's called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god and is now manifesting god in a many membered body whereas once god manifested in one member even our lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord you love him amen god bless you let's just sing a couple songs here if we can i'm sorry to take more time i just can never seem to quit
