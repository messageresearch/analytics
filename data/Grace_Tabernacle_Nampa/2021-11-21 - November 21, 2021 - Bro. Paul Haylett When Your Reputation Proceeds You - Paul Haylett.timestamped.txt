[38:05] amen
[38:06] god bless each and every one of you here
[38:08] today we just thank the lord for his
[38:10] goodness his kindness to us
[38:12] amen
[38:14] i
[38:15] just want to uh
[38:18] remind everyone that there will be no
[38:20] wednesday service this week and we
[38:22] certainly wish you a happy thanksgiving
[38:25] time together with family just to
[38:27] share truly
[38:29] of the blessings that god has given us
[38:31] with thanksgiving from our hearts and
[38:33] you know my brothers and sisters we can
[38:35] look at the natural life and we can see
[38:38] all the things that god has done for us
[38:40] he's blessed us with with wonderful
[38:42] gifts in the natural life
[38:44] but all of that pales
[38:47] in comparison to what god has done
[38:50] we
[38:51] listen to the prophet as he speaks the
[38:53] god of this evil age and we recognize
[38:56] the overwhelming
[38:58] power that satan is allowed right he
[39:01] doesn't possess that power he's allowed
[39:03] by god to demonstrate this or to bring
[39:06] this forward and to realize my brother
[39:08] and sister we can say well i'm i'm
[39:10] having some tough times in life brother
[39:12] paul i'm having some tough times
[39:14] whoever we might be
[39:17] think what it would be
[39:19] without the blood of jesus christ on us
[39:22] amen we have no comprehension saints
[39:26] of the demonic forces
[39:28] that are moving in the world today
[39:32] you know
[39:34] i say this with a bit of humor but i say
[39:36] this in a seriousness
[39:39] we could have been
[39:41] joe biden
[39:45] of whom the world is demeaning and
[39:47] looking down but yet called and anointed
[39:49] to fulfill a certain portion and we
[39:52] rebel against that in the flesh right
[39:54] but saints you realize the prophet said
[39:56] america would be bankrupt and i don't
[39:59] think it's just going to come up a
[40:00] dollar short
[40:02] there's only going to be one force on
[40:03] the earth that can redeem
[40:06] the united states it's already
[40:08] prophesied it's anointed to happen and
[40:11] we're witnessing it and we say i don't
[40:13] like this
[40:15] but i can tell you this
[40:17] if gasoline is ten dollars a gallon
[40:20] god will still take care of his pride
[40:24] if a loaf of bread is ten dollars
[40:27] god promised to take care of his pride
[40:31] amen these things must come to pass so
[40:34] we can either frown
[40:36] grumble and gripe
[40:38] or we can say lord we are one day closer
[40:42] thank you lord
[40:44] hallelujah
[40:45] amen uh also i want to announce that
[40:48] sister jerry and i are going to be gone
[40:51] the 3rd of december through the 10th
[40:53] um to arizona to hug some grandchildren
[40:56] and maybe our children too but
[40:58] anyway it's mostly about the
[41:00] grandchildren uh anyway so um i haven't
[41:03] really discussed it with brother chris
[41:05] brother david but
[41:06] they will be
[41:08] someone will be covering the services
[41:10] and i thank god for the ministry we have
[41:13] here in the church
[41:14] and uh saints i just have to tell you
[41:16] this you know sometimes confession is
[41:18] good for the soul
[41:19] i i need to give them more opportunity
[41:22] but sometimes when so many things are
[41:24] bubbling up inside of you you just feel
[41:26] oh
[41:28] next service i'll
[41:30] next service i'll
[41:32] but you just have but i thank god for it
[41:34] for the man god has placed in our midst
[41:37] if we would just stand uh today i want
[41:39] to
[41:41] go into i guess the
[41:43] third part of the two sides of obedience
[41:45] and uh i titled this today
[41:49] when your reputation proceeds you
[41:52] and
[41:53] but we're not talking about people we're
[41:55] talking actually about the spirits
[41:56] that's behind it all that moves
[41:58] everything
[42:00] nothing is moved that is moved my
[42:02] brother and sister without a spirit
[42:05] behind it
[42:08] and so we have to understand that
[42:10] now let's just turn in our bible bibles
[42:13] to the book of romans the 16th chapter
[42:16] starting with the 17th verse 17 through
[42:19] 20.
[42:23] just trust that the lord will just
[42:27] open
[42:28] what is upon my heart today
[42:30] on part of this because you see my
[42:32] brother and sister i'm going to type
[42:34] this or like in this
[42:36] spot that i'm in right now
[42:38] um
[42:40] we are the sheep of his pasture is that
[42:42] the word
[42:43] amen so so we are not here to decide
[42:46] what gate to walk through or where we're
[42:49] going to drink or eat from it's all
[42:52] decided for us
[42:54] but bringing that down to a level where
[42:56] a pastor is considered a shepherd over
[42:59] the flock
[43:01] no one wants to sit under a delinquent
[43:04] shepherd
[43:06] in other words
[43:08] if you
[43:09] eat this
[43:10] it's going to kill you
[43:12] yeah i might offend him if i warn him of
[43:15] that
[43:17] if you climb the fence
[43:20] and the coyotes and the wolves are on
[43:22] the outside the fence
[43:24] well maybe they rubbed noses through the
[43:26] fence with one of them and they thought
[43:28] they're not such bad guys
[43:30] and if i warn against that they might
[43:32] think i'm picking on that poor coyote
[43:37] now what kind of delinquent shepherd
[43:41] would let you eat poisonous weeds
[43:44] and associate with wolves
[43:46] and
[43:48] so we do our job
[43:51] and
[43:53] we deal with our complexes
[43:56] so we'll just preach the word of god
[43:57] today and hopefully when it's all done
[44:01] i can deal with the complex and you can
[44:03] handle
[44:04] being told about that wolf that's
[44:06] outside your fence
[44:09] romans 16 17 through 20 now beseech
[44:12] brethren
[44:14] mark them which cause divisions and
[44:17] offenses contrary to the doctrine which
[44:19] you have learned
[44:20] and avoid them
[44:22] for they
[44:24] that are such serve not our lord jesus
[44:27] christ
[44:28] but their own belly and by good words
[44:31] and fair speeches deceive the hearts of
[44:33] the simple
[44:35] for your obedience has come abroad unto
[44:37] all men
[44:39] and i am glad therefore on your behalf
[44:41] but yet i would have you wise unto that
[44:43] which is good and simple concerning evil
[44:48] oh i love this 20th verse
[44:51] hallelujah
[44:52] and the god of peace shall bruise
[44:55] satan under
[44:57] whose feet
[44:58] your feet
[45:00] shortly the grace of our lord jesus
[45:03] christ be with you amen heavenly father
[45:06] we just asked lord
[45:08] even as our brother already prayed
[45:10] father bind any words that are not your
[45:12] words lord
[45:14] father we just want to draw close lord
[45:16] as individuals as families as a body of
[45:18] believers we want to draw right into
[45:21] your presence that all the world can see
[45:24] is us
[45:26] in you
[45:27] and you in us
[45:29] father we thank you for the opportunity
[45:31] to come today
[45:32] ask for your guidance in the name of
[45:34] jesus christ amen you may be seated
[45:40] now
[45:42] kind of jumping ahead of myself but i
[45:44] feel right now just to say this
[45:47] saints we
[45:48] look at these
[45:49] four verses and we'll realize that they
[45:52] are
[45:53] evenly divided
[45:57] between the two sides
[45:59] i think god plays fair doesn't he
[46:03] although i think if you got the holy
[46:05] ghost the devil's going to think you
[46:07] have an unfair advantage
[46:09] but
[46:10] in this we'll see the apostle paul has
[46:12] laid out these scriptures
[46:14] now let's look at the apostle paul for a
[46:16] moment here
[46:20] the apostle paul's popularity and you
[46:22] say whoa now popularity yes popularity
[46:26] means support
[46:27] in other words those that said amen to
[46:29] the word that paul preached
[46:31] those that stood behind it and actually
[46:33] you know the greatest compliment you can
[46:35] pay
[46:37] pay the profit today
[46:39] people are identifying and things will
[46:42] and saints you know sometimes it might
[46:44] sound like i'm down on this
[46:46] please don't misunderstand me
[46:49] you're not
[46:51] paying a compliment to the prophet by
[46:53] hanging
[46:54] a three by six picture of him
[46:58] in your living room wall
[47:00] that's right
[47:02] that's right
[47:03] you are paying a compliment to the
[47:05] prophet
[47:08] by obeying
[47:10] living and testifying
[47:12] of the message he brought
[47:16] anyone can hang that picture on their
[47:18] wall
[47:19] but it takes someone who has sold out to
[47:22] the word to live that word out
[47:27] i say let's be complimentary to the
[47:29] prophet
[47:30] let's lift him up as a man as a servant
[47:33] of god let's lift him up and as i said i
[47:36] firmly believe that with all of my heart
[47:37] or i would not have spoken my brother
[47:39] and sister so what we want to do is is
[47:42] do this and realize that that the
[47:44] support uh the base of of uh the apostle
[47:47] paul's popularity and you can find this
[47:50] in various you know how dictionaries
[47:53] have slightly different words but by
[47:55] supporting these people supported the
[47:57] apostle paul and when paul would come
[47:59] into a city and he would start to preach
[48:02] if nothing had ever happened in that
[48:04] city my brother and sister we would
[48:06] maybe be suspicious that that it would
[48:09] be a circumstance or maybe not effective
[48:11] for the day but you see the word of god
[48:14] was not paul's word it was god's word
[48:17] brought through paul and so there was a
[48:19] support that come and my brother and
[48:21] sister i hope you follow my words right
[48:23] now his popularity amongst the real
[48:26] believers
[48:29] was based on his stand for the word
[48:32] you see there was something that
[48:34] resonated in his heart and i believe
[48:36] that you can say amen this morning
[48:38] something resonates in the heart amen
[48:40] that's the truth
[48:42] there's life here and i want this life
[48:45] and the apostle paul was preaching and
[48:47] you know he wasn't always so kind my
[48:50] brother and sister but he was vindicated
[48:52] in the work that he was called in his
[48:54] age and we'll find that as we look into
[48:57] the work that paul had for the age that
[48:59] he was in that it was not a work that
[49:02] come to the end of an age and stopped
[49:04] but it come forth and as it were
[49:07] gathered with the word for every age
[49:09] come together into a giant my brother
[49:12] and sister i i don't know how to maybe
[49:14] put the right word to it but into a
[49:17] giant uh a a force that had come into
[49:21] the laodicean age and it was here that
[49:24] we can look and uh look into the book of
[49:27] romans if you would we can do this all
[49:29] through the new testament but when we
[49:31] read the book of romans we see how
[49:34] closely it resembles the day we live in
[49:38] the church in disarray many voices
[49:41] people doing things they shouldn't do
[49:43] illicit affairs and all kinds of
[49:46] nonsense taking place and still claimed
[49:49] under the name of jesus christ under the
[49:52] name of god and so we see such a very
[49:55] close parallel to the day that we live
[49:57] in and and we see how the behavior of
[50:00] the people and the spirits of the day
[50:03] are are is in such a a
[50:06] unity as it would with the spirits of
[50:08] this day that we just recognize that we
[50:10] can take these words of the apostle paul
[50:13] and we don't have to modify we don't
[50:15] have to reason it we don't have to you
[50:18] know double check it as it were we
[50:20] recognize this is the truth this is the
[50:22] word and it applies to me and it applies
[50:24] to the day that i live in amen so you
[50:27] see uh paul has some strong words for
[50:30] the people
[50:33] i kind of wonder sometimes i know i say
[50:35] this once in a while here in the church
[50:36] but i wonder sometimes if the message
[50:39] church
[50:40] of our age could truly handle
[50:43] an apostle paul in their midst
[50:47] if they would declare him maybe just a
[50:50] little too radical
[50:56] think about it
[50:58] but you see my brother and sister the
[51:00] apostle paul
[51:02] with the message for his day had just as
[51:04] much zeal
[51:06] as any man that's ever come to the face
[51:08] of the earth
[51:10] just as much desire to see the word of
[51:12] god effective in you and i
[51:15] as any man on the face of the earth
[51:18] you see we're not here to place one
[51:20] messenger above another
[51:23] now we recognize that god did set things
[51:25] in order let me just sidetrack for a
[51:26] moment can i do that amen now god chose
[51:30] brother branham to be the prophet
[51:33] to this age
[51:34] there was purpose behind that
[51:37] it was not as though they just put
[51:39] numbers in a bucket or something and
[51:41] then drew out a number and said okay
[51:43] you're going to be to this age or that
[51:44] age you see
[51:46] god knew what he was doing
[51:48] and the same token saints
[51:51] the reason you weren't setting under
[51:52] paul's ministry
[51:54] is because god had
[51:56] made you in such a fashion
[51:58] to be here to represent seven ages worth
[52:01] of ministry
[52:03] you have the ability the facet in you to
[52:05] take that and pull the word in and say
[52:08] amen to it
[52:10] and respond to that is it easy
[52:15] it's not a trick question saints no one
[52:18] said it would be easy
[52:20] but the word said you would do it
[52:23] that's all that matters
[52:24] give us a mountain to climb give us a
[52:27] valley to go through give us great
[52:29] trials fiery trials god didn't say now
[52:33] you know if this is too much for you i
[52:35] have a shortcut
[52:39] but he did say he would bear us up
[52:46] come on think about it
[52:47] i'm a failure
[52:49] i'm a failure i just i failed again at
[52:51] the same thing that i failed then and
[52:54] then and then but the word of god comes
[52:56] to bear us up
[52:58] so much so that satan tried to use that
[53:03] against our lord jesus
[53:05] if you throw yourself from the peak of
[53:07] the temple will his angels not come and
[53:11] bear you up lest you would dash your
[53:13] foot against the stone
[53:16] and jesus said ha
[53:20] that's not
[53:21] the word says
[53:23] we'll not tempt
[53:25] the
[53:26] lord look at the day we're living in my
[53:29] brother and sister the parallels all the
[53:31] little things placed through the word
[53:33] that is here for you and i as a resource
[53:38] as a resource that we can reach in that
[53:40] and say you know what lord i believe
[53:42] that and i will act upon that
[53:44] so we see
[53:46] that
[53:47] paul had some strong words for the
[53:49] people and you know it's interesting
[53:51] saints
[53:52] the ones aligned to the word
[53:57] had or have no problem with the word
[54:00] and that's amazing
[54:02] when one is
[54:04] in unity with the word
[54:07] we don't have any problem with the word
[54:08] it's we don't have to say well i don't
[54:10] believe that's what god meant i i don't
[54:12] believe that applied to us i don't
[54:14] believe that says we have this and we
[54:16] have that no when one is in agreement
[54:18] with the word when the word comes you
[54:20] might say ouch or oh me but you'll also
[54:23] say amen
[54:25] and so we look through the ages what has
[54:27] happened and when paul was preaching
[54:29] these very strong words to his day did
[54:32] the whole church desert him and he just
[54:34] ended up preaching as it were to an
[54:35] empty building or an empty courtyard no
[54:38] my brother and sister in every age
[54:40] they're sons and daughters of god just
[54:41] like you want to be glorious to get on
[54:44] that other side and meet them we're
[54:45] going to be looking there and i just say
[54:47] this because it's how it touches my
[54:49] heart we'll be looking there and
[54:50] thinking oh my you were there in that
[54:52] day how did you do it and they'll be on
[54:55] the flip side looking at you saying you
[54:57] were there laodicea how did you do it
[55:00] and we'll both at the same time be able
[55:02] to speak it was christ in me it wasn't
[55:06] me it was him that did this it was him
[55:09] that held me up
[55:13] hallelujah
[55:15] because if it was not so saints we'd get
[55:17] to heaven and they'd have to make a
[55:19] shrine for those who overcome laodicea
[55:22] because we were the best of the best
[55:26] does that fit the word
[55:28] no sir
[55:29] because it's not about you and i
[55:32] it's all about him
[55:34] it's all about what he had chose to do
[55:36] but yet he did make you a special person
[55:39] to be able to stand in laodicea
[55:44] never forget that
[55:46] you see others had issues with paul
[55:51] and when people had issues with paul
[55:53] because paul was standing on the word
[55:57] i hope you catch the saints this applies
[55:58] to our day very very relevant
[56:02] they had issues with paul
[56:06] but paul clearly stood on the word
[56:09] can we find anywhere through history
[56:11] where they have proven that paul was off
[56:13] of the word
[56:15] not one drop of evidence that paul ever
[56:18] departed from the word
[56:21] that issue with paul
[56:23] you know what that really says
[56:25] they didn't have an issue with paul they
[56:26] had an issue with the word
[56:28] amen so when they push back it really
[56:32] paul was the target paul was the face
[56:34] just as though
[56:36] this day you are the target and you are
[56:38] the face
[56:41] but they're not pushing against you
[56:42] they're pushing against the word
[56:46] see how the spirits have come they've
[56:48] changed their clothing
[56:49] they've changed their mask as it were
[56:51] right brother branham preaching about
[56:53] god in morphe
[56:55] it's the same god changing a mass well
[56:57] my brother and sister satan said oh look
[56:59] at that god just changed his mask it
[57:01] works
[57:02] i'll change my mask i'll go from a devil
[57:05] with a pitchfork
[57:07] to a priest
[57:10] i'll go from a drunk
[57:12] to a religious scholar
[57:16] i'll go from the disrespectable to the
[57:19] respectable
[57:22] just changing his mask
[57:25] so we realized as paul stood on the word
[57:28] the issue was really with the word
[57:31] um
[57:32] my here again i've got to stop doing
[57:34] this i'm trying to but
[57:36] when you leave a book in the truck
[57:39] in this room in that room you pick
[57:40] something up and you read a little bit
[57:42] and i'm sorry i can't even tell you
[57:44] what message this was in
[57:47] but the prophet of god
[57:50] speaking
[57:51] along these lines that
[57:53] it is here in this day
[57:57] that we
[57:58] become the manifestation
[58:01] he's talking about god in flesh sister
[58:03] jerry's been you know gets excited
[58:05] shares a little something with me
[58:08] but you see god said
[58:10] i've got a lot of ways
[58:12] to reveal myself in this last day
[58:17] i can reveal myself as melchizedek
[58:22] he did
[58:23] i can reveal myself in a cloud i can
[58:25] reveal myself in fire
[58:27] i can reveal myself here and i can
[58:29] reveal myself there
[58:32] but what i'm going to do is come down in
[58:33] this last day and i'm going to reveal
[58:35] myself
[58:37] in my flesh
[58:40] the bride
[58:43] wow you talk about ownership saints
[58:46] god's not setting back saying well i
[58:48] hope there's some people he's already
[58:49] holds the title deed to you
[58:53] satan's there trying to convince you to
[58:55] revoke
[58:57] god's right to your life
[58:59] and satan will do everything he can to
[59:01] convince you that your life is not
[59:04] your own
[59:07] what is he doing
[59:12] it's plagiarizing
[59:14] the word of god your life is not your
[59:16] own i have it but jesus christ already
[59:19] declared your life is not your own i
[59:21] have it
[59:22] you see how satan's such a bluff that he
[59:25] is coming in such a fashion
[59:28] now
[59:30] i want to go back to verse 17.
[59:35] now i beseech you
[59:37] my brother and sister the word beseech
[59:39] is to ask urgently or fervently so he's
[59:42] there declaring fervently i i now
[59:46] beseech you or ask you fervently brother
[59:55] take out the trash
[59:59] no sir this was a much deeper subject he
[1:00:01] was he was reaching out now my brother
[1:00:04] and sister some of you are going to
[1:00:05] think that i'm just hashing something
[1:00:07] here today but i can tell you honestly
[1:00:09] not because the last half of these
[1:00:11] verses are actually what drew me to this
[1:00:14] scripture
[1:00:15] but i felt led of the lord
[1:00:18] hope you don't mind
[1:00:20] he said i beseech you brethren
[1:00:22] mark them which cause division and
[1:00:24] offenses contrary to the doctrine which
[1:00:26] you have learned and avoid them
[1:00:30] you know we have this great movement
[1:00:31] around the message we need unity we need
[1:00:33] unity the prophet of god talked about
[1:00:35] unity that would come in the last day
[1:00:37] but my brother and sister we look at
[1:00:39] this and we see that paul is asking the
[1:00:42] brethren there
[1:00:43] to the church there that that i'm asking
[1:00:46] you fervently to mark them now my
[1:00:49] brother and sister to mark them does not
[1:00:51] mean that we publicize to the whole
[1:00:53] world what rotten people they are or we
[1:00:55] demean them or we do everything to cut
[1:00:58] down we do that wrong spirit my brother
[1:01:00] and sister wrong attitude when that is
[1:01:02] the prophet of god taught us that it is
[1:01:05] prayer that changes things
[1:01:08] amen so that should be our avenue for a
[1:01:11] solution to the problems
[1:01:13] but he said mark them or identify them
[1:01:16] that uh these that are they're bringing
[1:01:19] a division now my brother and sister we
[1:01:21] don't even need to go to webster to know
[1:01:23] what a division is there is a separation
[1:01:25] or a setting apart a wedge
[1:01:29] and so paul is declaring you know what
[1:01:31] you need to identify those that are
[1:01:34] bringing these
[1:01:36] differences and divisions and wedges
[1:01:38] into the church and bringing offenses
[1:01:41] and offenses in this my brother and
[1:01:43] sister is a word speaking and such as to
[1:01:46] disregard one's standard or belief
[1:01:49] so coming in and breaking down what it
[1:01:52] is as it were a group of people holding
[1:01:56] to a standard of the word and one would
[1:01:58] come and to break that and cause a
[1:02:01] division in that the apostle paul says
[1:02:04] markham you know we do in this day we
[1:02:05] just say oh it's a difference of opinion
[1:02:10] they have the right that's the way they
[1:02:12] understand the message
[1:02:15] now this might come a little blunt to
[1:02:16] you i'm sorry it does
[1:02:18] but you see my brother and sister the
[1:02:20] apostle paul if we believe him said we
[1:02:22] should identify
[1:02:25] this is one who brings division this is
[1:02:27] not one who comes in and brings unity
[1:02:29] into the church this is not the one who
[1:02:31] says now i might see the word a little
[1:02:33] different than you do but what we're
[1:02:35] going to do is just pray that god gives
[1:02:37] us all the correct revelation that we
[1:02:39] all know these are spirits that come in
[1:02:41] they want to divide this
[1:02:44] my brother and sister let me just put it
[1:02:46] this way
[1:02:47] any time you've ever seen sheep inside
[1:02:49] the pasture
[1:02:51] the coyote does not run
[1:02:54] and dive into the middle of the herd
[1:02:58] hoping he comes out with a sheep
[1:03:04] a coyote
[1:03:07] pardon me sister sue
[1:03:10] starts
[1:03:12] moving
[1:03:13] this sheep
[1:03:17] look do you see what's happening
[1:03:20] you'll be safer over here
[1:03:22] behind the sagebrush
[1:03:24] where i can eat you in peace
[1:03:29] so what happens is it starts to bring
[1:03:31] separation
[1:03:33] now i'm not here and as i said i'm i'm
[1:03:35] not grinding any access saints lord laid
[1:03:38] this on my heart
[1:03:40] then as i looked at this i thought oh
[1:03:42] i'll just start here for
