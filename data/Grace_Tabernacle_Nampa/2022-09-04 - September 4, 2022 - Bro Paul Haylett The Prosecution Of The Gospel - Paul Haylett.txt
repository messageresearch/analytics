[Music] God bless you this morning I just wanted to say a couple words before I pray um it's been a rough year for me a lot of a lot of things going on my cousin Elizabeth Murphy I was very close with her so I was walking yesterday the words of the song inspired words though Satan should buff it though trials should come let this Blessed Assurance control that Christ has regarded my helpless estate and shed his own blood for my soul It is Well I can say it as well can you say that with confidence this morning hey man I just want to give an update um [Music] first things first I wanted to talk about my brother who was sick a while back and we prayed for him a number of times I talked to mom the other day and um it's been a struggle for him for those of you that don't know he had a he had a fast onset of a very severe lung infection the doctors when when he um told him you're that far man it it almost took you they said this is a and the Damage that was done to his lungs brother Jairus friend of ours most of you know him um he's a doctor he saw the CAT scans of when Josiah went into the hospital with the lung infection and he saw the most recent ones and he said from a doctor's standpoint from a medical standpoint it is nothing short of a miracle that he lived and how much he's healed he said he should have had more perfect or more damage permanent damage to his lungs but he continues to heal and he continues to strengthen each and every day we serve a God that heals I believe that I talked with um Gabe that's Elizabeth's brother he's also the pastor of the church there last night he said he spent the day with them at the hospital um I don't know what what's been said in the church what's happened and I'm always I'm not part of that but it started with breast cancer and it spread to lung and Bone um she's in a tremendous amount of pain and all the medications they're giving her for the pain is causing a lot of nausea and he said if you can just specifically pray for those things right now that the Lord would just ease that pain ease that nausea um I'm I'm praying for God's perfect will but I'm I believe I'm praying for a healing amen I praise that he just raises her up amen I wanted to read one thing here that was a quote my mom sent me last week and he swore by himself says just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up from the church walk with God Hallelujah if sickness sickness strikes you walk

Name Blessed Be Your holy name hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah well first off I've just like to greet our visitor amen God bless you have you with us today I don't know if the parents of that cute little girl that was into Sunday School I don't know anyway what a darling cute little girl amen also want to greet brother Mike sister Kimberly brother Mitch sister Naomi um you know sometimes Saints oh I don't want to get all gushy here you know and stuff but sometimes you just run into people that if you didn't know better you'd say I've known them forever and they're such a kindred spirit there that you just feel instantly attracted and I just have to say you can pay me later brother Mike but I just have to say when we met brother Mike sister Kimberly sister Naomi and brother Mitch it was just like I feel like I've known these and maybe I did before the foundation from the foundation of the world but just lovely lovely and glad to have them here and we all attended a wedding last night just a lovely time young couple married in a cow pasture and with all the amenities of a cow pasture and but still a lovely time I'm thankful that that they got married so that this family would come and visit us and just uh beautiful and uh last but not least my lovely niece Ruth amen just happy brother Jeremiah and their cute little guy Obadiah just happy they've flown down from Alaska to just spend a oh I could just start kind of a family fight by saying I'm glad they visited God's country but my dear niece Ruth is pretty defensive about Alaska and I'm sure brother Jeremiah is right behind her and they're already taking that little guy mountain biking and mountain climbing and I think probably that there's no hope for him but uh we're just so happy to have you here with us and is it good to be in the house of the Lord today Hallelujah well I I just want to give you a almost controversial title this morning you'll have to just be patient with brother Paul we want to talk about our position of strength you see my brother and sister now we're not contradicting scripture to say God has given us a position of strength he says when you are weak I am strong but you see in him we are strong in him we have the strength to overcome every challenge thank you uh beautiful song service the special song I just love that that was beautiful God has given us everything we need right the prophet of God to paraphrase that said everything you need for the Rapture is already in you so God has already given us a preparation right we don't have to say oh I've got to run out here and get prepared what we've got to do is take what God's already provided and he is through his word provided everything we need we we don't need to come out and and say well we got to start this and got to think this through and you know no my brother and sister we just need to rely on the Lord and trust him and just uh let that come to pass in our life I want to speak to you this morning on the prosecution of the Gospel now some of you are going to take that and say wow we've put the gospel on trial or something here but sometimes there's definitions in words that we don't commonly use or recognize and so if you'll bear with me we'll just kind of talk a little bit on the prosecution and persecution this morning if you will turn in your Bibles to Second Corinthians the fourth chapter verses 1 through 13 is where we'll take our text this morning and uh in that we will then take uh and build on this prosecution of the Gospel amen now as Paul's speaking to the Corinthians he doesn't mince any words but you know these words that he speaks were not for them only but it was for our day it was for our admonition it was for the strengthening of the body of Believers in the day that we live in and so in this we we just take these scriptures to Heart therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the faith commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God isn't it good we can all live at our own standard but as a Christian Desiring to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ we actually put our own life on trial in front of those around us in other words I don't want to be as it were a secret Christian I want my life to testify God is alive and well today the gospel is living it's changing lives it is our life amen but if our gospel beheaded it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake I love this just in a conversation a few days ago where is it my brother and sister God and placed Ministry in the scripture placed them in a very high position and then said you're now their servant my ruler in control to be the chief servant not to Lord over God's people but to actually be servants to God's people very humbling the minute you start to think you're important realize you're just the chief of the servants my oh my yeah for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts can we say Amen to give lie to the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed oh my my oh my amen I'm going to open the Hedge job didn't know nothing about it but God had no fear because he knew it wasn't job inside the Hedge he knew it was him in job and so he tells them you can do everything you want to job now get this there's a deeper connection here you can do everything you want to do to job but you can't take his life and Satan knew what God was speaking he knew the language and knew in the connection at the coming of the son of man he would try to take his life but he couldn't take his life and so God plays this out in job in the beginning and says you can do anything you want to but you can't take his life now we often read that now I'm not trying to change anything but we often read that as like a commandment of you you can't go to the position of taking his life or we can read this that God made a declaration to the devil and said you can't take his life now we're going to take that any way we please right some would say well that's your view on that Paul I choose to take it that way my brother and sister do you realize that we look in the flesh and we say oh my oh my someone has passed or sister Solas past our hearts are heavy their hearts are heavy satin but do you realize according to the scripture Satan never took her life yeah can't take your life either well I was going to stop but I read past my little check mark that I had to stop so we'll just go ahead and read persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for which we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh now when you read this scripture I don't mean to keep you but I just when you read this my brother and sister those two scriptures back to back are talking about one in our body in our body right internal and one is about our mortal flesh external so when people have an idea that I can serve God and my soul be saved but my body can yield to the world they are confused my brother and sister God's dealing with the inside and the outside amen he doesn't give us a place to just go immerse ourselves in sin because well he's going to save my soul no my brother and sister the internal and the external so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the spirit of faith according as it is written I believed therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak what is it we will speak what we believe we're claiming healing this morning for our sister amen because that's what we believe God Is A Healer amen if we believe he's a Healer then we can only speak for healing now we put a caveat to that you might say by Lord thy will be done but we must speak what we believe let's just go before the Lord Heavenly Father we ask you this morning Lord just may this be a glorious time to be in the house of God Lord the life Lord that you have given us Lord if we look to the external outside father we see all kinds of politics and Corruptions and all kinds of evil speakings and doings but Lord we're here Lord we're here wrapped in this in the presence of our God lord we're not looking to what's happening as it were in the world but we're looking to what's happening in this body of Believers that's the scripture calls the bride of Christ Lord we're looking to what you're doing in this hour the great work father that's coming down lord the laying in the presence of the son that we would be ready and ripe Lord just to be in a position Lord that we wouldn't have to be afraid of hearing behold the bridegroom cometh but Lord that we could live ready O Lord help us to live ready help us father to be filled with the oil father of your holy spirit that we can come and rise and shine in the day that you called us to bless this time today I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen it may be seated I just want to drop back for just a moment on a couple scriptures here of verse 4 then whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them and my brother and sister I love how God lays this out he's not excluding anyone but you have to be a believer we cannot just kind of be a fence straddling type of a Christian that we think that maybe over here science said this I believe it was brother Mitch in a conversation said uh you know that science is always right now some of you would say whoa just a second but I agree with brother Mitch science is always right they're just not looking at the facts correctly so when they say they find And when they see and this come from whatever we have these evidences my brother and sister God left that behind but it's there my brother and sister that unless it is interpreted correctly viewed correctly and I want to bring that the reason I brought that up uh was to say if we do not look at the Bible today correctly we'll find that God had provided a way for mankind now this could be a controversial statement to some but God wrote the word of God had it written in such a fashion that it will defend anything you want to defend and the message of the hour came and people can defend anything they want to defend but you see when the light of the Gospel Shines on a son or daughter of God they will see it God's way every time we don't need a new gospel we don't need a new interpretation we just need to have the Revelation or the presence of God in our life to anoint our eyes and our ears and our understanding to see it God's way and so as we come into this it's not that we really need to be educated we need to grasp things in a certain fashion to see the Bible I remember one time watching a little deal on the internet and this man was making an assurance to the people that until we have the original translations of the Hebrew and the Greek we'll never understand God and I thought my old man that guy just set himself up to never understand God you know it's it's such an interesting thing that we can look for proof but what is proof right there's an intrinsic value in truth but how do we mind that value because we only can take truth or analysis of Truth back to the point of what we believe is the foundation so it's there if we miss the foundation then we've missed truth but I'll tell you what God does he comes by anointing of the Holy Ghost because he promises in his word and said I will reveal it to who I'm paraphrase this reveal it to who I will reveal it to and when I reveal it to them then they will know my mind and they'll know my spirit and they'll know my nature amen oh let us not go to a book to find god let's go to his presence and cry out cry out his name and come into that present and not even come in as Beggars my brother and sister but come in as Sons and Daughters of God boldly to the throne of God lord I want to understand you I want to know you and I want to be a participant as it were of the unfolding of the word for the day that I was called to live in amen and so we look here and realize now I want to take this the God of this world so we see uh uh later you know as we look at this the God of this evil age my brother and sister we're seeing the scriptures so clearly says there's a God little G of this world that is not uh Jesus Christ it's not the Lord Jesus Christ it's not all of those names uh Redemptive names of God it doesn't fit in it's another God and my brother and sisters there's people I say today everyone on the face of the earth is serving God today it all depends on who your God is now that's kind of scary to the poor people that don't believe there's a God because then they're not even serving or thinking they're serving the god that they're actually serving now it's one thing my brother and sister to look anyone ever been persecuted you know there's a little 13 year old boy I didn't know the teacher actually wrote things on the chalkboard I just thought they stood up there and waved their arms and in one stroke of a visit to get a driver's license I become a four eyes and for years I went to high school with kids that reminded me you might be better now Paul but you're still four eyes and then by irony I meet them 20 years later and they're wearing glasses but you see little things that convex the soul and Vex our life and that's just a little just a little smattering of that Satan comes my brother and sister and what he's doing is trying to persecute some people don't handle persecution very well you take certain personalities this is why we have to die in the flesh because certain personalities just don't take correction very well and you don't have to say Amen so it's there that it is that God works on us because whether you have that personality type or not does not matter because if God called you as a son or daughter of God he will deal with those physical mental social uh emotional attributes to bring you into the correct position but still we can acknowledge that that sometimes it is hard to take correction amen and so as you look at this we see that we can be persecuted but God said don't worry about it if you're persecuted I'm not going to forsake you in that time you'll face those persecutions you know my brother and sister oh I'll hold that for a little bit just getting ahead of myself amen now having the same Spirit of Faith verse 13. according as it is written now God is actually talking to a special class of people and some people say well we divide it by whether they're Baptist Nazarene methodists this that and the other no my brother and sister God doesn't care about those there's a man's names those are man's division those are man's ideas those are man's form of Separation but God here is speaking to a special class of people that having the same Spirit of faith come to a place that as it is written I believed it see they didn't have to go back and see what it meant in two or three different languages and and whatever they just believed what the word of God said and so by believing it that becomes their vocabulary that becomes as a term I like to use their verbiage that's how they speak my brother and sister now when we take this I'll just bring this back to our situation here with our sister uh my brother and sister we're not here to say well you know I don't know it sure sounds like she's going to die because she has all of these different things my Bible says my God Is A Healer and the only thing you're going to hear out of my mouth is God Is A Healer and I believe my sister is healed now I submit that to the perfect will of God that if she is ready to go and the Lord says I have called her home I don't want to be found resisting against God saying you can't do that but we have to come my brother and sister in faith because if we let doubt in have you ever met doubt yes did doubt ever stop which is whether the toaster is going to toast the toast no sir doubt will creep so far into your life that you're afraid to even go out the door afraid to function and then Satan takes that to church with you and you're afraid to act on the word of God because what if it doesn't happen I'll tell you this I might speak boldly this morning forgive me if it comes across strong but my brother and sister the devil we'll be tormenting those of sister solas's family why didn't God raise her up come on let's just face it let's don't try and hide these things someone will be having doubt whether God really cares or not but I'm telling you we ought to look at it God's way we're going to look at it what do we labor as Christians we labor all these years to make it to what Knob Hill no sir that's not our goal my brother and sister our goal is to come into the presence of God but yet we in the flesh because God placed such a desire for life in us that's the very thing that attracts you to the gospel is that desire for life and God put that desire so strong in us that the Devil Couldn't keep us away from the word of God but yet in the end that desire for life is so strong we don't want to see anybody die but God said when the season has come when the circumstances is right and they have fulfilled they've run the race and they've finished the race this is their time they've crossed their Finish Line and the devil then comes in and says now I have another Avenue to Satan but you prayed God would heal them you prayed God would save them what about it now well that's not my department God called me to do certain things he gave me certain responsibilities gave you certain responsibilities let's not try to fulfill God's job let's fulfill our own job that God called us to and God called us to be ready when the voice said behold the bridegroom cometh it's not to analyze every circumstance in the world around us but to trust God that he is truly in control and you'd be surprised at how big of a challenge that is for people let's let go and say I'm going to let God do what God wants to do it's a big challenge my brother and sister but do you know as we look at this that this is very reflective of the life of a believer this scripture right here very reflective of the life of a believer you see we I'll try not to go back so I don't keep you forever today you know it's just really hard brother Mike we were in our in our little bit of Fellowship he's like do you know First Cafeteria yeah I've been I've been to a First Cafeteria then brother Mike perceives to say you know it it's tastes just like cafeteria food oh we're out of potatoes let me get a can sometimes preachers are like cafeterias we got way more than you can eat and after the second or third plateful you've lost your appetite but that doesn't stop us from opening another can yeah now look at this what God is doing you see the word as we look in these verses we see the word is already working as I said about the flesh the internal external the word is already working my brother and sister and so it is that the word is already on display the words working on the inside and it is working to the outside that it is on display so here we are as Believers of the word of God we're standing on the Bible as our absolute and we are there and we say well you know I I feel bad it just seems like I'm not making much progress but then someone who hasn't seen you hasn't been around you for years goes my you're a different person than I remember what is Satan doing he's trying to manage your life by micro bits and you look at every single one of them and say I wished I'd have done better I wished I could have done better Lord forgive me I didn't but God's setting back saying my word is working mightily why because you are actually my brother and sister in the visible World surrounded by the God of this evil age constantly trying to block the light coming to you sometimes the light is blocked by our own actions but why did you have that action because there was a spirit of this age anointing you to take a certain route or to think a certain thought well I would even go to church because well I don't know my life is just not worthy I'm just got problems and I have this trouble in that trouble when I am a perfect person I'll go and just let God do his work well Hallelujah you ain't never going in the house of God ever again because you're never going to make it to flesh perfect so you look at this and realize what Satan's doing the attributes the effect that is happening but we see and I say let's take the word and the word says he's already working on the inside and the word says he's working on the outside and I'm going to say Amen today thank you Lord that your word is working amen hallelujah now you know we sing that song and it says on flowery beds of ease I always laugh when I hear a preacher say yeah some of you thought that when you got saved that was the end of your problems well what he should do is say every one of you fought not just somebody but every one of you thought when you became a Christian my problems are over I'm a Christian now no that was just the start of the battle you know it never takes much effort oh if I could do this hopefully it's not too random for you but did you know in the right place in the right time the right abilities you can kayak up the waterfall I've watched it happen there's a little swirl around a rock here and it looks to me like it's all going downhill but they know if they can bring their kayak here the force of that then forces their kayak to turn and as their kayak turns just a stroke of the paddle puts them on top of the water that's above that rock and then they can come and they can turn into the current and do that again and literally have seen video of them kayaking up a Rapids or a waterfall as it were my brother and sister the devil doesn't think you'll ever make it Upstream but God said I'll give you a technique I've given you an ability I'll give you discernment I've give you power to go Upstream against the spirits of the age that we live in and that makes you a rarity in the world today and I hope my visitor doesn't feel like I'm being too judgmental but my brother and sister most churches are preaching now hey God understands why you can't live this God understands no my brother and sister my God has empowered me and empowered you to go Upstream of the spirit of laodicea and to be an overcomer he isn't never going to say it's fine just go with the flow he's going to tell you I have made the way possible for you it's time for you to trust me and do as I direct you but it's too easy to say let's just go with the flow because God understands well my brother and sister when our understanding becomes in direct conflict with God's understanding we need to put our understanding down and say Lord I submit to your understanding I want to be Lord let your will be my will and my Will Be Your Will Lord that we can come and continue to press forward Amen to the mark of the High Calling High Calling is not Downstream High Calling is Upstream that means we're pushing we're having to exert even against the laws of nature yes now look I have a lot of respect for the devil I don't want anybody to misunderstand one must say this morning but have tremendous respect for the devil because the minute Saint said we get out from underneath the boat the devil's right there and The Wiles of the enemy will defeat Us in the flesh they'll never get to think the devil's there just to kick him around but getting ahead of myself I want you to make it a practice to kick him around while you respect him respect the authority as it were that he was given then anything that would bow to him is now under his authority oh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego my brother and sister look at all of those Jews that were there all of them that were acquainted with Daniel all of them that were acquainted and in the history of who they were had been carried down with him but in that they had went downstream so far that when it come time to Bow they didn't have a problem this after all is Daniel and he's our prophet we're not actually bowing down to their gods we're bowing down to a God we created for ourselves the devil's gotta the devil's got a job to do and you know he anoints labors to work for him and it's a shock to people that when some of those laborers appear to be very religious remember absolutely right but but but they they've done all these great works hence the words it says Lord have we not done many mighty works in thy name now God didn't say you're lying he did not say you're lying but you see their work that they were doing they were taking the power of God it's not even we'll touch on imitation in a minute but it's not even really through imitation but they themselves see coming God honoring faith God honoring the word god honoring promise but they just became a conduit you realize a minister standing in a pulpit's just a conduit but it's got to be a good conduit it's got to be a clean conduit it's got to be a worthy conduit it's going to be a god of proof conduit you can't be a man just born with a gift to speak and then say ah this is of God no my brother and sister God uses the lowly uses the ignorant to unlearn he uses those that spit and stumble he uses all these people but if they're a clean conduit then God can do Supernatural things through that so he anoints laborers to work for him and you realize that this is an imitation of the plan of God that's all Satan's doing his whole anointing of using people to work for him you see powerful things happen we won't go into this because I'll get myself in trouble but my brother and sister if you don't believe that there are certain anointings that come out here that Satan has put to work I could take you back to a certain musician not having having uh given all he could in this in this uh concert almost collapsing goes in the back room and he's sitting there and the drummer for this band starts playing this deal and it sounds like African jungle music and he starts beating away at this thing and as it's there my brother and sister you see this man who would have perverted many Souls with his music you see him there and you see him revitalized and it's there and a new Fresh anointing Falls and you see him get up and go back out and give almost as much in a a performance as he had before and we've seen old dry hided Christians I mean Believers that are just weary from well-doing and we'll see how God will come and bring a certain time and a place and His holy spirit will come down on people who are mentally and physically exhausted from the life that they're challenged here uh from all that they are assaulted with and they are coming to where they're coming to the house of God as more of a tradition a more of just I gotta do this I know I gotta do this but we'll see the Holy Spirit Come and move in our midst and we'll see them being revivalized and raised back up there's a spirit bringing that man to finish a concert and there's a spirit that's coming back in the church to raise up Sons and Daughters of God to finish this race to make it to the end do not stop from exhaustion and being too weary and clouded of the mind can you say Amen to that amen the devil wants to just get our mind so befuddled that we can't even think that we can't focus and it's there that he hopes he can come and trip you to have a spirit of I don't care I just I just got to get away from the pressure but I'm telling you what we need to do is cry out Lord send a fresh wave of your Holy Spirit into our presence Lord Lift us up oh we often have nightly prayers oh I I won't say we I'll just say me I've come to realize the pattern of rhythm of my nightly prayers depends on the condition of my daily battle and when I feel Victorious when I go to bed I just can pray up a storm but if I go to bed feeling battered beaten and the devil they're saying so you've been forsaken my prayers reflect that Saints and someone say Amen I'm not the only one am I and so this is why we must bring ourselves into an atmosphere that no matter what is happening around us we are able oh I'm not talking about fooling yourself none of this psychology name it claim it oh God said it so we're all supposed to be rich I want to know where's your Bentley God never promised me a Bentley God must promise me the Holy Ghost he promised me the power of the word that would restore me back to my rightful position according to the scripture he never promised us wealth and ease and Flowery beds my brother and sister but he promised a delivering power that said this work I have begun in you I will finish and that wasn't the preacher that spoke that that was God himself said I'll finish this work in you that you can come and have a confidence that you're walking Amen in the plan of God you know so the devil he imitates the plan of God so he he anoints people to work for him but do you realize what this perversion was was an anointing of the Holy Ghost he perverted the moving of the Holy Ghost and that moving of the Holy Spirit was when God come down upon us and we then become fellow yoke members of fellow laborers in the gospel and we feel anointed just to live this now I know that the secret we have in our church is that we're all sent an email and if you don't come and you don't sing and you don't that there'll be consequences sorry for warped humor we come to the house of God because there's something burning there's something churning inside of us I want to be in the house of God I Want To Worship the Lord because when I'm there his presence comes right down surrounds me now that can happen everywhere don't happen to have it have to happen in church but God said that's one of the places primary places he would come to meet us would be in the house of God With Us bringing our licks of fire together the atmosphere that we create and God comes down into that but God never threatened you right God never threatened you I can remember a young man told me one time as a young man he kind of backslit and he'd find excuses you know to go and really what he was doing was running up the mountain and going fishing on Sundays and one day his relative who happened to be the pastor of the church told him now here's a kid didn't lie cheat didn't do anything read his Bible prayed every day just didn't go to church on Sunday and a relative comes to him and says you know you're going to hell these are hard words there's a little humor in it but these are hard words he said you're going to Hellboy and he said well hell it'd be preferable than being in church with you hard words that you see there was something about atmosphere that wasn't right honestly Saints why didn't that young man have an anticipation and burning to be in the house of God still love the Lord still read his Bible prayed but there was an atmosphere that wasn't there I pray God never lets that atmosphere ever even come close to the parking lot of this church that we create an atmosphere where people say I want to be in the house of God I want to I want to be a part of what God is doing amen and if we're not creating that kind of atmosphere then I say God come and bring a Revival and a repentance in Grace Tabernacle that we create an atmosphere where people say I want to go to church I want to be a part of what God is doing oh I tell you what my brother and sister the devil imitates a lot of things he makes the world so appealing he makes it so attractive my brother and sister that everything about it just you can't hardly find a fault with it I mean they're all having fun as I heard a minister say once it's all fun until you hear the sizzling of the fat that goes for like a lead balloon don't it but there'll come a day there'll come a day that it won't be fun oh no we don't make this as a threat my brother and sister I'm just telling you the devil's so clever in his imitation of what God is doing amen and you know I think it's interesting did you know that people love imitations come on because an imitation does not cost as much as the original do we want an imitation church because we're afraid to pay the price no sir I want a relationship with my Lord that's the original Lord anoint me to pay the price whatever it takes Lord I want the original I want a life that I can lay my life down and Christ will raise it right back up again amen I want a life that is so filled with the love of God that I'm not afraid of pouring my love out my brother and sister you see people they're stingy with love stingy they say well that's the way I was raised well I'm a New Creation in Christ and whatever love I pour out the Holy Ghost will pour it right back in me why don't you try it why don't you try it just pour out beyond what you ever have seen and felt and what knowledge of in your whole life just pour it out and see if God doesn't pull it fill it right back up again Hallelujah Hallelujah now persecute is to treat someone cruelly and unfairly especially because of race or religious or political belief constantly annoy now this doesn't count concerning the preacher okay I'm not persecuting you I might annoy you but I'm not persecuting you so what is this it's tenoi with a persistent or urgent approach so we see that I think all of us would say somewhere in our life there's something that little weakness in the flesh will be setting sin as it were a little something that Satan the fiery Dart and he just keeps aiming for that same spot and you know it annoys us It Bolts us it vexes our spirit but you know I'd like to be fair to the devil today if you don't mind Amen to just give him a chance to have his expression today now Brother David Nash on this last Wednesday brought out a point that there was a time a season when the saints would just uh they laid their lives down without a single word they just submitted and just laid that down amen and then there come a time my brother and sister that there was a change in the anointing and the anointing come to where the people rose up and fought back and said we are not going to allow this to happen in our lives any longer but we've got to find a balance don't you just love balance amen you got to have a balance so you look at that see that day they fought violence with violence but yet again the gospel turned a corner and we'll see in second Corinthians 10 3 it's there that it says though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh so we are no longer in this day dealing with Satan as a battle of Flesh against flesh now up to time whatever we see there is violence on the Earth today religious violence on the Earth today the news constantly comes out of some of those African countries for being killed for being a Christian and so it is that there is still conflict going on but I'm talking in this spiritual realm we're not fighting we're not pushing back against the flesh because that is not the answer and we might have differences you might say of opinion of baptisms of these kind of things and the difference but we should never ever turn it into a battle of the flesh it should never became a bottle of names and actions of such that would be degrading because that defies your claim as a Christian the devil would love for us to do that for the weapons of our Warfare now God's once again talking to a special class of people you know who I'm talking to amen a special class of people amen our weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen have you ever pulled down a stronghold oh I'll tell you every one of you somebody you didn't shake your head I'll shake it for you because if you have prayed and asked God to do something concerning your life or life of someone close to you and you see God come bring a Deliverance bring a healing you've pulled down a stronghold amen and the devil wants you to just get towards just calm and well we prayed and and you know that went away no my brother and sister you just tore down a whole devilish stronghold amen are we doing okay see we got a new warfare though a new anointing in the land that we live in in James 4 6. as we look in James 4 6 he says uh but he giveth more grace wherefore he said God resisteth the proud but give us Grace into the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist amen the devil and he will flee from you see this no longer a Warfare of flesh and blood our weapon actually is anointing of the Holy Ghost to withstand the onslaught of the enemy now to withstand the onslaught of the enemy first you have to declare that you're going to be victorious this in my love of History has been proven again and again and again through all the writings of History men who said that they would fight to The Bitter End not for the hope of just a stalemate but declaring victory you know shamgar was out there beating on the helmets all them Philistines saying I hope I can I hope I can I hope I can no sir samgar was like didn't you guys read visitors you might not be able to see it but we actually have a no trespassing sign right here in the church it's posted here for the devil to know that this is posted property it's not his property and he can't trespass shamgar got tired of the Philistines look at the spiritual type trespassing in his life and he didn't grab up an ox code going I hope this 25 year old Ox goad or this Walmart aux code will withstand this battle he went out there and said I'm tired of it God this is my land this is my food this is my family and this is your word and he went to work on them Philistines never I do I believe once during that time was he worried about whether the ox code was going to last through the battle he was anointed to fight that battle and he looked to them and he was living on the promise that God had already given and he said that promise is my promise and as we closed out those scriptures there what is uh what it is spoken I believe and will speak myself amen and he was speaking Victory right into his life this is not name it claim it Saints this is you speaking the word of God and God honoring you making a claim on his word hallelujah amen so what happens now he doesn't say go out and have a verbal Warfare an advertising campaign a smear campaign no just resist just resist how's the prophet say uh to how to overcome just resist just resist Saints all through the word of God every Prophet through this scripture laid out a pattern for us to resist evil to stand on the promise and not back up from that and God said I'll be behind you I'll stand with you now I tell you what what is our defense come down we can say devil I'm resisting you leave will that do any good you got to have something behind it you got to have a foundation that those words are built on you have to have something that the devil knows that you know what you're talking about and then it's no longer when the devil knows no this is not intellectual this is not the guy who can quote Whole scriptures whole chapters no this is not that kind my brother and sister this is when you know that you know that you know that God called you and I am a daughter of God I am a Son of God and I'm standing in its position and I won't be moved from that and Satan I'm going to take the same position that my Lord Jesus did I'm not going to come and quote all kinds of scriptures I'm not going to come and threaten you I'm just going to tell you it's written it's written you are talking to the word now my brother and sister you know some people can't grasp this in the day that we live in that we have become the word we have become the word that's what the Bible tells us we have become the word because it's living it's saturated us until our very fiber of our being on the cells of our mind amen our whole spirit is the word of God it's Christ amen I'm not my own I've sold out and so now when I come and I stand on the word of God and I speak to the devil I don't know how your conversation with him is mine gets pretty personal sometimes you know devil I'm offended I'm offended that you would actually use such a nice person with a bad spirit to try and cause grief to me I don't hold the person responsible you know the devil knowing something to rob the bank and then calls 9-1-1 so the police catch him that's how he plays the game then the one who was trying to serve God but got anointed to do something he shouldn't have done is now bitter at God because he's in a bind and the devil sits back and says man this works well let me tell you Saints it works it will just have the foresight and the courage to stop look back to the word and say it is written I'll fall many times but my Lord is there and he's going to raise me back up amen I have many days of doubts and fears but this Prince of Peace has come and he now takes and wipes away all the anxieties all the fears and well you know my doctor says well good for your doctor but what about Dr Jesus what did he say that ought to be something that we hold and say you know what I'm going to go to the doctor all right but I'm going to go to the doctor Jesus first and now look how this is placed I find this interesting because I have done this and I won't be so bold to say you all have done it but it's people that look just like you have done it that we have glorified the persecution you know that's the woven to me as brother Jewell says lousy wowzy woo lousy lousy whoa I got a plate for work that's why they invented the alarm clock I couldn't find any cold cereal in the house it's been on your grocery list for a week I went out I'm already late for work and my car's got a flat tire it's been going down for a week 10 days the devil shirt hard on me got no sympathy in my neighborhood the grocery stores just down the street um tire shops right down there on the street you know in fact the tire shops are getting so sophisticated in big cities they'll come to your company's parking lot patch your tire right there you can just be working away they'll even charge your electric car with a diesel generator right in your company parking lot that's the world we live in it's called laodicea and then people go around saying well I got reprimanded they told me one more time I'm gonna get fired at work oh the devil's after me no you're just lazy you're just lazy you need to just get up off of your little tail and you need I'm sorry I shouldn't have said it that way and that's all they can talk about how you doing brother I'll tell you what I visited a church I hope you find humor in this I visit a church sister Jerry and I was there and there was a brother that we've we had known from the past and there was a brother started making a beeline towards us and this brother leans over to me real quick just leans over he goes whatever you do don't ask me man anyway it's like God bless you brother nice to meet you no key in the lock he's like go on find somebody else well he did just right past us brother how you doing oh brother you wouldn't believe was the time of my week has been like blah blah blah and that Brothers obviously heard it before he goes oh that's just like the week before and the week before and the week before and the week before I'll go find somebody else who'll have sympathy for me look my brother and sister we're not here to glorify any persecution our lord Jesus do you see him in this scripture going on and on and on about oh they did this and they spoke this and they spoke these evil words you do this it's recorded but Jesus didn't record it I hope you get my point we don't glorify the persecution but we do find those that can that's all they can talk about now I think I added this in the brothers don't have it but we're all familiar with Philippians 4 8 right all of these things that we have you know whatever things are true whatever things are honest whatever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things amen let that be the change and if Satan cannot anoint Us in the mind to think on the negative my brother and sister then the mind will naturally go to the positive that's how God created us so if you ever start thinking negative thoughts I just want to remind you it's not of God so just say devil you get it back I don't want it it's not from God I don't want it now I wanna I want you to can we all I I know there'll be some here that will catch this little play on words and I hope it doesn't leave anything but I want to have a little sympathy on the devil okay is it okay this morning we have a little sympathy on the devil you'll bear with me you imagine how the devil feels when a child of God goes to the throne in prayer everything he's tried to do to keep him from that place hasn't worked and There Before the Throne crying out to God I I'm almost thinking the devil's probably getting just a tad bit depressed over this you know it it just not working and I hope this doesn't seem out of place but this was just in my notes these are things that we were studying out I wonder how the devil feels when a child of God crosses to the other side we feel sadness but where is the shout of victory this is all they have longed for and sought for and lived for we have sadness but there should be a shout of Victory and the devil's depressed because that one got away I will have no more opportunity to persecute him I have no opportunity to struggle cause struggle in turmoil in their life how does the devil feel when you praise God in the face of adversity imagine how the devil feels when you have overcome his anointing you've overcome his suggestion you've overcome his gospel and you still Worship in the face of adversity the devil's like this is not working we've got a problem Houston we've got a problem and this one I think is a real crushing blow to the devil how does the devil feel when Sons and Daughters of God come and repent I had evidence against them I had an indictment in their life and they've just wiped it away ever wonder why it's so hard to repent we're going to do an impromptu poll have any of you known you should have repented and it was like getting teeth pulled why because you're not a son of God you're not a daughter of God no sir because the devil's there throwing all kinds up and did you ever notice the longer you go from the moment you know that you should repent the harder it is in fact we can go so far into this that we start to craft the story well I really don't need to repent because they did this they said this and then this and then I was there thinking I'll I'll kind of say I'm sorry but they just walked right by me on their way out of church well so did 40 other people but that anointing is right there and another week goes by I love the story of two brothers in Iowa farmed across the creek from each other now the one brother actually owned a little bit of land on the other side of the creek next to his brother there and he wanted to make a little Park over there on that other side of the creek partly to annoy his brother but partly because it was a beautiful spot so he hires a carpenter true story hires a carpenter to build a nice big wide arching Wood Bridge over the creek so as the Carpenters building this bridge he's talking to the man and he says well for sure is that your property over there who who owns the other property my brother well how does he feel about you building the bridge I haven't talked to him in 20 years I mean he must have done something really really serious well actually I don't remember why we don't talk it's like oh okay keeps on building the bridge finally one day it comes and hears this big beautiful stained or varnished or whatever it was big arch bridge over there and he built some picnic tables and whatever else but what this man didn't know is he went to the brother the carpenter did just a little Carpenter just a little Carpenter and he went to the other man and he says I'm going to be bold sir what is it between you and your brother he says I I don't know it's been so long I've forgotten he said I'm going to cut a ribbon on the bridge tomorrow for your brother and his family I think you ought to be there that next day they have all the family down there they go to cut the ribbon and the man says wait there's somebody over here in the bushes in the trees what is this and here comes his brother and his family now think about this this man had discernment you say hey let's not have this a cutting of a ribbon as a celebration as it were of a bridge but let's cut a ribbon as a celebration of unity of a love of a forgiveness and face to face in those words those two men broke down in tears and later on they spent every day they spent time together and it was only just a handful of years before the one brother passed away my brother and sister how effective Satan can be come in and Destroy Fellowship in families and destroy all of this and people don't even know what it was and the reason they don't know is because it was the devil and they never saw the devil's handiwork as for what it was oh my you know what I'm never going to be able to read this really long quote that I have to finish this if I don't get after it amen so look what it is my brother and sister how the devil you know he he feels like he might under these the definition of the word persecuted the devil actually might think he's persecuted for what he believes I want you to have some Sympathy for the Devil when you've got Sons and Daughters of God that are holding on to the word of God that life has become absolute in the word of God what is it you are rejecting everything the devil believes amen it is not just a battle of right and wrong this is a battle of Doctrine and spirit of not of flesh and blood but of things of a spiritual warfare and the devil poor guy out there why what happened you've rejected his message oh come on it's all based off spiritual things my brother and sister you take it right back to the Garden it's all based off of spiritual things and so you've got two spirits in the framework of the church it's not just Spirits it's gospel it's a message you've got a message of laodicea that's coming and it's converting millions and millions and millions of people and gaining momentum and the devil's so proud of himself until he came to you Can someone say thank you Lord thank you Lord when the devil got to me there was just something in me that said no sorry I reject the God of this evil age I reject your message of the hour that's here I reject that because there's already been a message that was planted in me from the foundation of the world and I realized by revelation of who I really am I'm not just a person wandering to and fro but I am the very life seed of Jesus Christ in flesh oh hallelujah hallelujah now look see if you're going to prosecute something now what would you guys say the prosecution is would that be like a judge and a jury taking someone who's committed a crime and they're presenting the law and the crime and they're there to convict him right that's kind of what most of us think prosecution is well you know what brother Mike when you shared with me that you love I think it was you maybe it wasn't you maybe it was someone else maybe it was you something about understanding definitions you know knowing what things mean don't don't just read a word oh okay that's the word that's that's me you guys know that all the time I just have to know what words mean now we have the actor the process of holding a trial amen you know I put every one of you on trial before when I had a critical spirit somebody ought to be able to get an amen out of that my goodness you guys have I lost you is it lunchtime no that's usually when we start judging everybody is when we've got a critical spirit on us I'm telling you Brother Jay and I just gave faces to each other during the deal here my brother and sister because I heard a brother Minister he's now you people that get all judgmental when you see somebody that is not dressed right don't act right whatever has tattoos all this stuff and you get all judgmental about that this brother says I want you to know what you're doing is looking at yourself before the blood of Jesus Christ came on you what's there to judge then the only thing that makes us different from them is the blood of Jesus Christ oh there's nothing for us to get high and mighty about whoa look at me I'm such a good Christian and they're just to say no if it wasn't for blood that's you now I say thank you for the blood Lord thank you for the blood and keep Lord just let it come over me over again and again and again Hallelujah but look at this we'll cut through all the definitions that don't matter to us persecution the act of doing or continuing to do something this is why we're I say persecution prosecution prosecution this is why my brother and sister we're going to prosecute the gospel because we're going to just keep right on doing it we're going to keep on living it everybody's going to try and get you to quit everybody's going to try and get you to go here everybody's going to try and get you to water down the soup and but no my brother and sister we're going to take this gospel and we're going to carry it in its original condition right on out to the End Amen so the world would be like oh you're going to prosecute no no no no my brother and sister I I'm not Prosecuting in the mind out here that we think I'm Prosecuting it because whatever happened down inside of me is going to take me back to the original seed again and again and again and finally it becomes absolutely I'm Tongue Tied this morning absolutely becomes my reference book of life because I I need the original I love how the law in itself has all kinds of Latin you know you'll see these things and you'll get papers and they use all these Latin words and that's really good that's really good latin's really good except for I was raised in Idaho and Latin here just doesn't get you very far walk in the restaurant all flowery in Latin and they'll ask you do you want onions on your cheeseburger or not you know just it won't get you far but I tell you what the persecution prosecution prosecution I don't know why I keep saying that I like the online Webster it says the continuation of a course of action with a view to its completion I want to prosecute the gospel hey man I don't want to just say it's good for my life right for this moment I want to take it all the way to the very end I'll not leave you nor forsake you amen okay I wanna I need to hurry along amen so you look at this you know brother Stephen preaching Family Camp just opened up a can of worms for me because now everywhere I look at this you know my brother and sister some people think it's foolishness to be so religious had a conversation the other day with a young man and and we were talking I just had opportunity to insert a few things to him and it surprisingly enough the young man responded and he says yeah he said look I know what you're talking about he said I've spent five six years in the Air Force he said and wherever you go the word passes quickly you're religious you don't want to hear their jokes you don't use their language he said it passes so quickly and then he said it it then twists and he used this word their persecution takes on a different form it's not oh hey we can drink you under the table no no takes on a religious twist does your God answer your prayers hmm what if you're a young man felt like God hadn't answered some prayers you know what kind of a blow that would be ah I don't know if God answers my prayers or not and the devil's right there to sense the hesitation and then it becomes a blow the day every day hit them with my brother Mike spent years in the Marine Corps he would know what the culture is like unforgiving brutal and every day but praise God we don't have to be the one that sits there and says I don't know if God answers my prayer we can be the one on fire saying I'm going to live every day ready for the coming of my Lord and my Lord answers my prayers even if I didn't see the answer that I thought I would see I know because he promised to answer my prayer he heard my cry and it has come to pass and how you can shut up those fiery darts God answers my prayer amen well have you ever seen your God where did you see him look at the sun where did it come from and if it can be recreated by man why haven't we created another one they all have answers well you know methane gas ponscome I'm not talking about your relatives I'm talking about my God my God said let it be and it was your relatives might have come that's based off of some silly joke I'm sorry but it's there my God just said it and it come to pass amen why because we have an answer to the devil's question we don't have to be bullied by the devil we don't have to sit back and let him do that now I'm sorry I do this all the time don't I apologize I have borrowed so far in the future you guys realize that I need to take a month vacation and then I might be caught back up on the time that I have taken can I have time enough to go through this as I was with Moses so will I be with thee so can the Church of the Living God be Reckless and fearless in faith see some people my brother and sister they they would say that just no you can't do that you know you guys can all act like a bunch of Pentecostals and you're gonna oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no you know mostly accusations they are against people acting like Pentecostals I'm going to talk about denomination talking about believers as they themselves have been dead so long they can't even get their feet off the ground they can't even jump and Shout they can't praise God their idea of thanking God for something is mumbling for over their gravy and spuds [Music] come on my brother and sister I got something we're shouting about I've got a whole list if you guys want to be bored to death I got a whole list that I could tell you for Endless hours of the supernatural that I have been able God's granted to me to witness Amen deliverances Let me just share one with you might not mean much to some but this might touch somebody amen we were preaching in a little city called nacionmento Chile and down below them what's the city to the South where all the Orchards were no um we're we're the youth meetings was held at was that angle okay angle there was a little sister her and her husband children lived in Angola they lived on the edge of a like a little Ravine or whatever and they had a deck that went out there on the one edge of that deck was about 12 14 feet off the ground where that was leveled out there anyway that little sister going through maybe a postpartum stage of her life or whatever that would be and she's there she comes to church that day now this is not about brother Paul this is about God coming and answering a need and using whoever he pleases to perform the work that he once done and we've come that day and I had a great burden on my heart and gone moving and that little sister had come to church and I'll just reveal what the situation was in a little bit and it was there as that little sister comes into the church with this depressed Spirit on her and she's sitting there I didn't know this till after the fact but I noticed his sister that was just very down very pulled into herself and I noticed as the service went on she just was Freer and Freer and pretty soon a hand went up and pretty soon at the end of this service is the holy spirit moved with great power amongst the people I see this little sister just weeping and weeping and weeping and she's there just trembling and weeping and you think oh there's something great going on and see after church goes to her pastor and her husband and says you will find on the deck tied to the second post a rope with a noose on the end of it where I was going home today to hang myself and God has delivered me God has delivered me the husband drove home that day and before his wife could even get out of the car went and went out on their deck and behind the post by a flower pot tied to the post already is a rope with a hangman's noose all coiled up there where all she had to do let's put it over her head and step off the deck now you tell me that we don't serve an on-time God Amen you tell me that we have a God that doesn't know the needs of all oh that's just one of thousands I believe I could number that I could share with you we've seen the power of God come on the scene and the problem is is it's become a little common it's become a little what and it just Fades back behind us until another group of people come and God says I guess I have to show myself again I've got to show myself that I'm here I'm real I'm alive again excuse me so can the Church of the Living God be Reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I will be with you I'll not fail you nor forsake you he's never forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he will not fail Joshua he will not fail us he'll be with us and as we find Joshua to take his commission knowing the responsibilities was leading them through the lands now that he'd have to go over into the other land he'd have to set up their Kingdom and he'd have to divide the inheritance among them he knowed the commission was tremendous far more than what Moses had done Joshua had more to do than Moses had to do now I want you to catch this Saints if we think that Joshua just got a commission of God and then walked out and told Israel do it that it was that easy no sir no sir they were spirits there was the negative it was anxieties he was a man Christ reflected in a man but there was flesh and he had to say well what am I going to do God's God's got a great calling on me what am I going to do how can I do this another thing he was to lead them along the border amongst their brethren Now put on your spiritual thinking caps and they already tasted Blood let's talk about Israel had to conquer them he had to keep them quiet as they marched on and so it is today with this new Pentecostal group that's Rising now they've tasted denominationalism it's hard to keep them down see people just wanting we need a form come on Saints you don't know how privileged you are that you come to the house of God with Holy Spirit to lead you when the spirit in most religions now is people are looking for someone to tell them come on I know this is a little blunt hopefully our visitors understand this is a little blunt my brother and sister but what have people done they've come to a place they just want to be told well if you're going to just be told without any leadership of the Holy Ghost we ought to go join a church that's really fun and got a great welfare program and a great this and that and the church will play bank for you and blah blah blah blah blah and they'll tell you you do this this and you'll make it to heaven strangely enough most of these this is is something to do with supporting the church hope that's not too blunt they've tasted denominationalism man's control it's so hard to keep them down some years ago they said come brother Branham when the ministry first started we'll start an organization build a memorial you a memorial somewhere I'm not looking for Memorial I'm looking for the coming of the Lord amen so they formed a little cold and called it the latter rain moved up into Canada out into California but it fell through Court it couldn't go why was it the only thing they know they come out of those things and they got a little touch of it and they got to have something that they've got to do in other words they got to be oh I'm on the church board for this and I'm on the young program for that and I'm on this and I'm on that and believing that's a form of godliness my brother and sister are having the Holy Ghost is a form of godliness amen not having a position in the church that's not a form of godliness amen I hope I'm not getting too excited for y'all amen all the rest of that I spoke this morning was just getting me warmed up for this brother the real Church of the Living God has no forms has no Creeds it's led by the power of God Can someone say Amen in every individual's heart I say Amen again amen now he's telling they say he told them pass by your brethren don't fuss at them we're greater than they don't fuss with them just go by now look at this oh come on this is specific you might say in in our groups foreign 's a little funny they've got this thing over here I feel like I need to fuss at them I need to sit down the coffee when I could be talking about the good things of God and tell them where they're wrong I believe God called me to set them straight [Music] usually what happens is you created one of those riffs that nobody knows where it came from but you because you're the one that created it but after a while you realize huh that wasn't right I shouldn't have done that so you're never going to admit Church I just started the whole riff I just alienated all these people over here and all these people over here and I just hey don't paint me with your brush you want to do that do it on your own time under your own declaration but don't paint us with that brush amen oh we just love everybody when they do what we want yeah yeah don't fuss with them we're greater than they don't fuss at them just go by I want you to notice a great great big thing taking place here there was Esau Moab and those that referred to last night many of these people many of those were actually borderline believers come on Saints what are we going to do well we're going to faucet the borderline believer and tell them you know what hey you get the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost you'll be a real believer like me only they look at you and say you're no different than me so if you've got the Holy Ghost I got the Holy Ghost and it's all borderline what about a real life on the inside and on the outside on display where the people would say I don't know what they've got that we don't got but I want to have what they got and their life changes because what you thought is not what you are but you've got what Christ is amen so the borderline believers they were right on the border now you can take this in a historical View and go back through the scripture and go back through history and realize that this is a two-edged sword they were living on the border and their spiritual state was borderline hmm right on the border I got to stop hearing something just for a moment won't take me but a minute many people refer to the promised land to be the Millennium it is not I can't believe I've had people tell me that yep yep we're already in the Millennium brother Paul I said this particular case I was like are you serious and he goes absolutely it's a revelation of God my pastor will pray for you and you'll get that revelation it's going to have to do more than pray for me to get that revelation because I'm still fighting I still fight my flesh my mind the circumstance around me I'm still fighting I'm not in the millennium we had a little deeper conversation I won't go into right here and I said I'll prove it to you and I did and he wasn't very happy but he knew I was right and later I regretted because I was fussing are you with me I found out later as it were in my heart that my motive wasn't pure I was just going to prove him wrong right hmm strangely enough do you know it never changed his mind all my fussing some of you know what I'm talking about all our fussing doesn't change a thing well I'll give them a piece of my mind but you've done that so much one of these days you're going to run out and you're not going to have anything left to give them because you've gave it away and usually the behavior accounts or the fact that instead of operating on a full deck oh sorry I shouldn't go like that but many people refer to Promised Land Millennium it's not the promised land had Wars and killings the Millennium will have any wars or killings that referred to the Holy Spirit the Battlegrounds now look at this my brother and sister I want you to just catch this I hope you can catch where I'm coming from justification they left Egypt three stages of their Journey they left Egypt under justification believing the word they separated themselves from the Egyptians and came out they crossed the Red Sea and killed the things behind them oh Lord help us to kill the things behind us what was sanctification through the blood that kills all human desire of evil second stage of the journey but the third stage was when they crossed Jordan into the promised land was their inheritance laid their inheritance never laid in Egypt though God bless them in Egypt you Lutheran boy calls it right out here you Lutheran believe in justification your inheritance doesn't lay there if you're called if you're just a Lutheran then that's all the farther you'll ever get you Methodist Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Church of God message believers who believe in sanctification the killing of the evil that's in you taking out the roots of evil you belong across the river but to you men and women that there is something in you oh come on Saints this is who we are today there's something in you calling out the Deep to unto the Deep there's a Jordan yet to cross a land beyond the river you're going to pass by your brethren you're going to pass by your brethren and they're near the Borderland and if you pass by them don't say nothing to them I have given Esau this mountain I have given Moab this country I don't want you fussing at them prosely lighting move just move through gently you know where you're going now look at this line right here I'd highlighted if I could don't take up their habits their habits is what is keeping them where they're at oh come on my brother and sister I think about brother Bud Southwick my brother and sister what a man I never met him personally but I know brothers that were very close to him and and he was quite a character but here is a man that wanted to live right and there he is out there in the wilderness of British Columbia and he wants to live right get this now sometimes we think well if they wanted to they could here's a man who wanted to live right and couldn't break his cigarette habit and before going to bed he needed just one last cigarette and he said you know what I better go check the horses one last time see there's more to this story than you just get out listening to it those that are heard it firsthand step out of the tent the rustle of the breeze why you're not going to go up stream go out by the horses stand out past where the horses are tied pull out a cigarette light it brother bud yes brother when did you quit smoking I hope you catch this well he can only get delivered if he wanted to be delivered and if he wanted to be delivered he'd be delivered but he wanted to be delivered and he wasn't but God wants to give to you more than you desire for yourself and God said this is the moment amen this is the day his response come on I'm not trying to be hard on anybody but most of the time our response is well if you understand my circumstance if you knew why if you were in my shoes let's call it a Southwick moment maybe we could brand it that way from now on have a Southwick moment right now when were you delivered right now and I want this church to have a Southwick moment my brother and sister you got something that just keeps playing on you something that eats in you this Satan is just pestering you over this just constantly picking away at you why don't you make it a Southwick moment and say Lord there's Deliverance for me you've already given it I've claimed it and I'm gonna make it right now just now Lord just now I'm claiming my position on my Deliverance my healing revelation of the word to be open to me let it be right now Lord not six months not a year sometime in the future but right now oh Hallelujah don't take up their habits it's a problem my brother and sister you see how it is that we're not careful I experienced this years ago you start hanging out with people I'm not ashamed of this and at the same moment I'm very ashamed of it I started hanging out with some young men I've known him all my life but really hanging out with him and you know what I found out it took a young lady that just had some righteous indignation I know this just seems out of character because I'm just such a fine person but I started hanging out in pool halls I started coming home on Saturday mornings at one and two A.M oh I didn't drink I didn't smoke well you know what if you wrestle with the pig you both get dirty and the pig likes it and I'd been doing that and Jerry and I'd fuss over that she didn't really like it she'd tell me I don't care what you do now don't misunderstand her she was in the right spirit I don't care what you do I'm going to serve God Amen one day I come home I think it was about 12 45 in the morning you know how it is when you're guilty you don't ever just hey I'm home no sir it's almost like shoes come off WD-40 in the lock hinges and here is this like five foot one girl from Alaska visiting our house there she is her hair sticking up like this in a house coat pulled around she puts her little finger under my nose Paul hey you're supposed to be a Christian what are you doing acting like this why are you coming home like a thief in the night I'm like leave me alone the genius not none of your business but God made it her business at night and I never went back to a pool hall wow I don't even know where lagina is in her life right now but I know at that moment she looked like she was pretty ferocious maybe just to cut right off the block of the Lion of the tribe of Judah and she did a lot of roaring at me that night right there and I told her to mind her business and she said I'm Jerry's friend and this is my business and it was necessary things I needed that yeah don't take up their habits Moab false prophet a bishop by the name of Balaam come down got amongst the congregation trying to get them to organize and all come together because they were Brethren but they were not that's how he look how he breaks this down they were half Brothers you know what my brother and sister I'm not half Brothers with you I am a full brother in Jesus Christ I'm not a half brother or not a half a promise there and a half a promise here we are one in Christ amen we cannot manufacture Unity Unity comes from our believing and acting upon the word of God and they come together because they were Brethren but they were not they were half Brothers not real brothers if in your heart oh don't disagree with him just go ahead leave them alone pay for what you get if you have to pass through his country he was predestinated to be that if God would expect it or predestinated Moab to join up with Israel they'd have joined up if he had predestinate Esau to go with Israel Esau would have jumped in and win but he gave him his inheritance on the other side of the river so how can you try to make all the Lutheran seed all the Baptists see it all the Presbyterian sea and all the Nazarene seed all the pilgrim Holiness all the message people don't condemn them that's all they know that's all that's in then I'm sorry I inject that in there it's not really good of me to do that but to you who believe is this word speaking to anyone this morning but to you who believe called to a higher qualification a higher requirement but to you who believe oh God to you who know to you that's got something in you that's calling to the Deep if all the Deep you God has been satisfied then stay where you're at you ever wonder why there's just a little constant something inside of you that's just wanting a little something more from the Lord and the devil tries to tell you it's because you don't got it you don't got it but what it's really is that that got placed inside of us to never stall out just to say well my great-granddaddy went to church here and my granddaddy went to church here and my dad went to church here and I go here and I'm so proud now my son and his family goes here come on to the bride of Christ this is what drug us my brother and sister from positions from places from places being on this board and that board and part of a church and whatever and drug out and people say what's went wrong with them what they didn't understand was that deep calling that could not be satisfied to just sit there and God has come in this day and he is being a land beyond the river amen oh let me go back up amen you've got this has been satisfied then stay where you're at but for me and my house for me there's something more than what we've seen there's a land beyond the river somewhere there's still a deep calling to the deep and I cannot be satisfied with theology yeah I cannot be satisfied with a good church some people left good churches left churches that had good pastors that loved the people wanted to do but the pastor would never preach beyond what their Church condoned because that's just what you did and so it was always just this is where we at we are this and we are that and you know just so you know one side of our family Mormon one side of our family Catholic but God so anointed my parents my sister's parents too she gets to claim them there's got to be more oh David look we'll make you a lay Minister don't leave no I'm sorry it ain't about staying or leaving I've got to find it there's something more I've got to find the more and years later that same pastor oh it's a whole nother story but that same Pastor looked me in the face one day in a funeral home and told me he says I believe your daddy made the right decision a man that said no you can't leave the church David you're going to go out in the desert just like those examples in scriptures you can't do that David and years later after my own fathers passed away come and say your daddy made the right decision because our church I hope this don't offend no one but it was a Free Methodist Church and the man said in our church has just seemingly got more liberal and more liberal and more liberal oh God Hold Us Lord Hold Us don't let this Spirit of this age come in and cause us to soften the gospel water down the gospel let us come my brother and sister let's amen prosecute this gospel all the way to the end let's carry this truth and and live it out not make it a doctrine that we almost whip out of a card well we believe no sir here's my business card here's my business scoring cannot satisfied with a good church or cannot be satisfied with a good campaign I cannot be satisfied with a little healing service there's something beyond that that's calling just let them alone go on through don't argue with them but we're passing to another land oh this sounds harsh Saints and we're not judging God's the judge amen we're not the judge as I shared with you when we look out here if we get judgmental we need to remember that's us without the blood of Jesus Christ we're not no great people it's the blood that has changed us and made us what we are amen don't argue we're past another land that wasn't ordained to go with you they won't walk with you how can two walk unless they agreed but those who love God for those who were called of God well they say God give us this church God did this that's true that's true that's true my brother and sister but the church ain't taking you in rapture amen the church ain't going to heal you either the church ain't going to deliver you that's right God said I give you saw this mountain don't touch him but I've got something different for you cross over that's my desire Brethren to see the church cross over into another land desire to move over to the other side and if there's something in you here first calling there'll be something to respond to that call just settling down to cheap raising I like that they're settling down to sheep raising isn't enough for you go into some sort of business not enough for you just to join the church and put your name on the book it's not enough for you because there's something called on across the ridge Over Yonder across the next Ridge across Jordan until you've Fallen to the arms of God in a deep calling and to the Deep oh Hallelujah not just what I told myself I wouldn't do today Saints I can't apologize for this is the gospel but I could use more wisdom amen Jeremiah 29 11 as we close if the musicians would just come when you think about what God has for you we're Prosecuting the gospel taking it to the end for I know the thoughts that I have towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected or purposed or provided end thank you Lord let's stand and just lift our hands and thank the Lord he's got to expected end for us and he's providing everything we need Lord I sin daily it might be just a little thought it might be a little word that was said it might be something but I'm so thankful let the blood of Jesus Christ is here we can just wade into it we don't have to just touch a fingertip although one Speck one spot of blood is sufficient the heart of the believer says Lord Wash Me it's Peter about foot washing and said oh Lord don't just wash my feet wash my hands and my head also I want to wade into the blood of Jesus Christ because I have an expected end I was able to finish this race I was called to finish it you might say in a grand fashion amen not someone's testifying over my casket he tried to be a Christian they might not agree at all but have them be able to say I believe if I ever met a Christian this individual would be a Christian oh my brother and sister you've been called to carry the gospel to the end amen now the word reckless [Music] some people say I don't know about that Reckless stuff well I'll tell you what my brother's sister we got challenged at Family Camp to recklessly pursue the Holy Ghost the leadership of the Holy Ghost you see it says Reckless is one that has no regard to the consequences of his action let's live life safe sign her name on the book give to the building fund support missionary work let's play it safe I want to just ask you this morning who wants to be a little bit reckless in their pursuit of the Holy Ghost who wants to step out and say Lord whatever it is you have for me whatever you want me to do Lord I want to do it I want to put beside all of my thoughts about you know what's kind of safe I I'm one of those safe kind of people brother Paula I don't come get Reckless step out say Lord whatever you've got for me I'll say yes Lord yes I'll step out Lord if you want to send me to the far reaches reminds me of the story of the little missionary and they said you want to go to the heart of Africa don't you realize how dangerous it is and he said no he said if God is sending me there that's the safest place there is on Earth and I say God help us to get out of our ruts let's get out of our little things of life here where we're all settled in in Comfort well this is what my mama believed this is what my granddaddy believe this is what it is why don't we step into what God believes what God desires what God says I I want you to come up higher I want you to come into Heavenly places oh hallelujah hallelujah did you know my brother and sister how well do you know your flesh none of your admitting to knowing your own flesh but did you your flesh will try to convince you not to your flesh will try to convince you just sit down stay nice and low-key maybe the devil won't notice me maybe I won't ever be challenged to have to express my faith recklessly [Music] oh Lord I want my flesh to shut up I want my flesh to just go sit down and get out of the conversation so I can hear what God Said and then I'll repeat it and because I believe what I heard I will speak it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I love you Lord [Music] I Love You Lord just sing it from your heart and I live my voice [Music] oh my soul reach yours take joy my kingdom in what you hear may it be your sweet sweet [Music] in your ear let's sing it again oh I love you Lord and I in my voice [Music] ignore my king [Music] I'll sing praises to your name I sing praises to your name this lifts your heart to it oh Lord foreign [Music] foreign [Music] oh no for your name is great and greatly to be praised [Music] we give worship to your name aren't you glad you could oh Lord Jesus Lord you blessed us [Music] foreign [Music] I give worship to your name [Music] oh Lord for your name is great and greatly to be praised I give worship to your name [Music] Lord worship to your name [Music] foreign [Music] I'd like to sing one last song My Redeemer is faithful and true not used our brother Bud Southwick is an example and I would not any disrespect to our brother but once again I just feel compelled to bring you back if you've got a thorn in your flesh [Music] of besetting sin something that Satan comes and he's vexing you I would just ask you in your heart with a hand however you choose just come to the Lord right now and just say Lord right now right now it's gone I'm finished with that this is and this is the time Lord You've laid it on my heart let's just lift our hands and just ask the Lord to come Satan it's clever enemy he lets little pets [Music] it's tried to put the habits of Moab on God's people [Music] Lord we're not here to accept the habits of this world we're not here to say well everyone does it they're Christians no sir you're called out people you're called to a higher calling you're called the Sons and Daughters of God according to the word of God he's got a bride and that bride is ready that bride's not talking about getting ready she's not reading about getting ready she has a harsh desire that says Lord I want to be ready I'm making myself ready now Lord I ask you to come I've got my own hands lifted Lord I want you to come Lord Jesus and little habits father that we don't seem to place much value on but the word said it was the little false that spoiled the Vine Lord I'm asking you just to take away that little fox take away that little habit Lord that we we just brought with us we didn't think it was of much issue but just cleanse Us by the water of your word cleanse Us by the blood Lord let us just Wade right into the blood today oh Father I thank you All Saints our forgiveness is not based on how loud was shout how many times were repeated but just from the heart of full repentance and I say today Lord the persecute not one that I said I wanted to be kind to earlier Lord I want to Vex him I want to Vex him I want him to know where I stand and Lord I place everything father that's not according to your word under the blood today that Satan could no longer say I have a record no longer say I have notes concerning you he can say it but he's a bluff because it's empty now we stand as people under the blood of Jesus Christ led by the Holy Spirit oh Lord I say thank you my heart rejoices today I say thank you thank you Lord as I look back on this road I've traveled I see so many times carried me through and if there's one thing I've learned in my life my redeemer is faithfulness [Music] faithful and true everything he has said he will do every morning Hallelujah My Redeemer is faithful and true my heart rejoices when I read the promise [Music] there is a place that I'm praying for you and if there's one thing I've learned [Applause] I remember his faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true oh Lord I testify everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies [Music] my redeemer is true my redeemer is faithful and
