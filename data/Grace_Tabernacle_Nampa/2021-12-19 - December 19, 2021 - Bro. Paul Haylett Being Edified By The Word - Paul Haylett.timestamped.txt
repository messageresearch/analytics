[13:53] if you could just pray for my voice
[13:56] maybe sing a little louder for me help
[13:58] me out
[14:00] but uh
[14:01] as we were getting ready for song
[14:02] service and just sat in the in the chair
[14:06] and uh it's my mom's chair you know i
[14:08] got it from
[14:09] marlene huff and
[14:11] she uh
[14:12] i hadn't seen her for a lot of years
[14:15] because you know my mom had passed away
[14:16] and she says i've got mom's chair would
[14:18] you like it i said well absolutely she
[14:21] said it's been reupholstered and
[14:23] so sometimes i just sit in that chair
[14:25] because i believe when

[14:30] know maybe she'll be sitting in that
[14:31] chair saying honey it's time to come

[14:42] you know sometimes i get asked well why
[14:44] do we sing any happy songs fast on
[14:46] clapping songs

[14:50] of worship
[14:51] as we just

[15:16] and we're upset because we're not in our
[15:18] pew

[40:08] and
[40:08] brother prashant and sister concho will
[40:10] be coming up uh for this holiday season
[40:14] and uh very happy because um you know
[40:17] saints i i don't know about you but i
[40:19] haven't let go of them yet
[40:20] amen we still claim them as ours as a
[40:24] part of this assembly amen so you know
[40:27] um i know brother croissant's heart and
[40:30] i i won't go ahead and speak those
[40:32] things out but i know their heart
[40:34] longs to be here with you and uh so
[40:37] let's just keep them in prayer uh in a
[40:39] constant measure
[40:41] give thanks to the lord once again
[40:44] uh many many needs across the united
[40:46] states and we're seeing god answer those
[40:48] prayers one after
[40:50] another amen and uh you know to just see
[40:54] one one example my brothers and sisters
[40:57] is uh
[40:58] uh if i understand what i've heard you
[41:00] know brother ron uh peterson just had a
[41:02] minor blockage but yet he had this
[41:05] tremendous chest pain
[41:07] and um he went and they have been able
[41:10] you know they dealt with that long
[41:11] before it would be as we would consider
[41:13] a critical thing and so isn't that
[41:16] beautiful the lord sometimes gives us
[41:18] all a shake if you remember it was like
[41:20] he's in cardiac arrest and and uh you
[41:23] know you're just like oh my oh my oh my
[41:26] and you pray with a fervency
[41:28] and then you know that wasn't
[41:30] necessarily as it were accurate but the
[41:32] fervency part on our part was good was
[41:34] it not amen sometimes the lord just
[41:36] knows that maybe somebody misunderstands
[41:39] the terms but yet
[41:41] look at our own reaction do we just
[41:43] slough it off and say oh i hope he lives
[41:45] through it no the body of believers
[41:47] coming together in unity binds its faith
[41:50] together with a fervency with an urgency
[41:54] and then moves forward on that believing
[41:57] amen
[41:59] not any of this stuff
[42:01] when you hear a minister
[42:04] say comments like
[42:06] aren't we lucky to be christians
[42:11] no luck involves saints
[42:14] no luck involved god said i chose you
[42:17] in fact i chose you so long ago you
[42:20] can't even comprehend it
[42:24] and then i chose you so long ago that i
[42:26] built a whole plan
[42:28] of redemption around redeeming
[42:32] you
[42:33] wow
[42:35] you see
[42:36] do you get this saints
[42:38] god didn't have a plan of redemption and
[42:40] then choose the people
[42:42] god chose the people and then built the
[42:44] plan of redemption to bring those people
[42:47] in
[42:48] oh thank you lord
[42:50] hallelujah
[42:52] you know
[42:53] let me liken this this morning
[42:55] sometimes um you know
[42:59] we've done it around our house a time or
[43:01] two
[43:02] so i don't mean it you know ill or
[43:04] but isn't interesting you go to the
[43:06] store
[43:07] and um
[43:08] you're in target or you're in hobby
[43:10] lobby or you're whatever and they have
[43:13] all these things on sale
[43:15] and you buy that looking for the person
[43:17] someday you'll give it to
[43:22] i see some guilty looks
[43:26] but you see
[43:27] christ
[43:29] gave the gift
[43:32] specifically
[43:35] isn't that beautiful
[43:37] stirs my heart
[43:38] amen oh praise the lord now i'm not
[43:42] telling you don't buy gifts and give
[43:44] them in a general sense
[43:46] um well i'll just not
[43:49] the brothers are reminding me um this
[43:52] next wednesday
[43:54] uh will be canceled because we are going
[43:56] to tear apart more things which includes
[43:59] the whole sound system here at the
[44:01] church
[44:06] okay okay okay well it does actually say
[44:10] you know they can talk to me
[44:12] i just don't listen very well
[44:15] december 29th
[44:17] okay we want to warn you well in advance
[44:19] this next wednesday there's church amen
[44:22] the 29th where we won't have service on
[44:24] that wednesday because we're we need to
[44:27] disassemble some stuff and then give
[44:29] brother isaac and and brother alex those
[44:32] that do the sound stuff and brother ivan
[44:34] also
[44:35] time to put this back together correctly
[44:37] without some hurried deal and that's
[44:40] sometimes been what our problem has been
[44:42] is we have
[44:43] we have replaced and put parts in and
[44:46] done this and that and we always have to
[44:48] have it ready for something the next day
[44:50] or two so we just give the brothers some
[44:52] time and so let's stand and go into the
[44:55] word
[44:56] today amen and uh
[44:58] you know it's just a beautiful i pray
[45:01] today saints and pray with me that i'll
[45:03] be able to share this in how it spoke to
[45:06] me
[45:07] and
[45:08] not to say that how it spoke to me is
[45:10] the only way it can be spoken but it
[45:14] came with inspiration it came with
[45:15] anointing it came with something that
[45:17] touched my heart and and you know when
[45:19] that when that anointing or that
[45:21] presence is there sister jerry was
[45:23] playing some music of a sister from
[45:25] australia
[45:26] and uh you know as the sister is singing
[45:29] there on that uh cd
[45:31] you know i i'm just setting i don't know
[45:33] sister jerry noticed i actually hoped
[45:35] she didn't in one sense but just driving
[45:37] down the road my heart so melted i was
[45:39] just crying
[45:41] what sin
[45:44] what's sick
[45:46] are you talking about
[45:49] it's so far down in the sea of god's
[45:52] forgetfulness
[45:54] amen
[45:55] that
[45:56] he won't even bring it up oh thank you
[45:59] thank you
[46:01] thank you
[46:02] i want to speak to you this morning on
[46:04] being edified
[46:05] by the word
[46:07] amen let's turn in our bibles to ii
[46:09] corinthians the 10th chapter
[46:12] we'll read the first eight verses
[46:15] and just lay out a little
[46:17] a little uh uh thought as the lord laid
[46:20] on my heart
[46:21] and i have to tell you saints that um
[46:24] i had to try really hard to not just
[46:27] branch off into 42 different topics
[46:30] because that's what this
[46:32] this thought this word here when you
[46:34] start digging into it you'll find that
[46:36] it is connected so completely
[46:39] and as a brother once said he said this
[46:42] word is connected so completely
[46:46] complete enough to cover the whole earth
[46:48] in the blood of jesus christ
[46:51] that's how
[46:53] complete the word is
[46:55] and i say thank you lord
[46:57] because you see
[46:58] we tend to get kind of narrow
[47:02] in our thinking the message come to a
[47:04] prophet that god brought out of the
[47:06] united states of america
[47:09] and we tend to have certain advantages
[47:10] because it was preached in english and
[47:12] it's right here and it's readily
[47:13] available
[47:14] and we kind of then tend to look now
[47:17] don't misunderstand me no one but we
[47:18] tend to look okay we got to help those
[47:21] in africa we got to help them in asia
[47:22] we've got to help them in south america
[47:24] we've got to help them but but we forget
[47:27] that the same holy ghost that spoke to
[47:29] the prophet here in america
[47:32] is speaking all over this earth
[47:36] an anointed word has been given to the
[47:39] whole earth amen so you will find if we
[47:42] could ever tap into this and i wouldn't
[47:45] bother to try but you will find saints
[47:47] that as the word is being preached you
[47:50] will be able to connect and know that a
[47:52] brother here a brother here ministry
[47:54] amen and saints listening to the word of
[47:57] god and reading their bible all over the
[47:59] earth it's the same holy ghost
[48:02] amen the same god that was here
[48:05] yesterday
[48:06] is going to speak to you today and he
[48:08] will walk with you and speak to you
[48:11] tomorrow
[48:12] amen what do we have to worry about
[48:15] what do we have to worry about
[48:18] hallelujah now remember the prophet see
[48:20] this is some of the struggles i'll just
[48:21] get this over with real quick and then
[48:23] maybe i can focus the prophet of god
[48:25] speaking
[48:27] and he's making this that god did not
[48:30] come
[48:31] because he had to
[48:36] he came
[48:38] because he promised
[48:41] now why would he make a promise to a
[48:44] people
[48:45] that he didn't plan on redeeming
[48:49] amen
[48:51] so remember
[48:52] you're sitting here this morning to hear
[48:54] words of promise
[48:56] [Music]
[48:59] come
[49:00] on so don't stay here and say well i
[49:03] hope brother paul has something good
[49:04] this morning sat here this morning and
[49:07] say god promised to be here and speak to
[49:09] me
[49:10] and i i'm going to stand and you know as
[49:12] it were the prophet of god speaks some
[49:14] pretty strong words saying you know look
[49:16] god would not be god if he does not
[49:19] honor his own word and then we have no
[49:21] obligation to serve him
[49:24] but he keeps his word
[49:25] oh hallelujah
[49:27] ii
[49:28] corinthians
[49:30] now i paul myself beseech you by the
[49:33] meekness and gentleness of christ
[49:36] who in
[49:38] presence am based among you but being
[49:41] absent embold toward you
[49:44] but i beseech you so this is two
[49:48] urgent pleas
[49:50] that's what beseeching is it's an urgent
[49:52] plea
[49:54] two in a row but i beseech you
[49:57] that i may not be bold when i am present
[50:00] with that confidence wherewith i think
[50:03] to be bold against some
[50:05] which think of us as if we walked
[50:08] according to the flesh
[50:10] for though we walk in the flesh
[50:12] we do not war
[50:14] after the flesh
[50:16] for the weapons of our warfare
[50:20] are we here
[50:22] amen paul wasn't saying the weapons of
[50:24] my warfare
[50:26] the word our used in this context is
[50:29] plural and conclusive
[50:34] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[50:37] carnal
[50:38] but mighty through god to the pulling
[50:40] down of strongholds
[50:42] casting down imaginations every high
[50:45] thing that exalteth itself against the
[50:47] knowledge of god and bringing into
[50:50] captivity every thought
[50:52] to the obedience of christ
[50:55] and having
[50:56] in a readiness to revenge all
[50:58] disobedience when your obedience is
[51:02] fulfilled
[51:03] now look my brother said oh
[51:05] yep stay on track paul
[51:07] do he look on things after the outward
[51:10] appearance if any man trusts to himself
[51:12] that he is christ let him of himself
[51:15] think this again that as he is christ
[51:18] even so are we christ
[51:21] for though i should boast somewhat more
[51:23] of our authority
[51:25] which the lord hath given us for
[51:26] edification and not for your destruction
[51:31] i should not be ashamed heavenly father
[51:34] we ask the lord for you leadership
[51:38] father you know our hearts cry to you
[51:40] today and father we just ask you to come
[51:42] and speak to your people may we walk
[51:44] from this building today lord but not
[51:46] from your presence able to say in our
[51:49] hearts and with our lips it was good to
[51:51] be in the house of god
[51:53] father for every need lord that was not
[51:55] shared the unspoken father just asked
[51:58] you to move lord i ask you to move right
[52:01] down into the very depths lord for
[52:03] husbands and wives and for children and
[52:07] for those father of our family and those
[52:09] that are not our family but are close
[52:12] lord just ask you to touch hearts
[52:15] move forward father for your word has
[52:18] promised and it is coming to pass
[52:21] we thank you for the opportunity to
[52:23] serve you and lord as we read in the
[52:25] scripture lord may we serve you with joy
[52:28] and with thanksgiving lord may the fruit
[52:31] of our lips be praised unto you father
[52:34] not complaints
[52:36] lord not beseeching you father for what
[52:38] we see is wrong but lord beseeching you
[52:41] for what we know is right
[52:44] and we give praise to you today and ask
[52:46] for your guidance in the name of jesus
[52:48] christ amen amen
[52:50] you may be seated saints
[53:00] you know as we look at this this word
[53:03] beseech kind of touches me in such a
[53:05] sense
[53:06] i've had a few occasions in my life and
[53:09] i have shared them from this pulpit
[53:12] but it's interesting saints how certain
[53:14] things will happen in your life
[53:16] that cause you unconsciously
[53:19] to cry out it's not a thought like i
[53:22] should cry out to the lord right now
[53:24] but it is something that happens of such
[53:26] a nature that you cry out from the
[53:29] depths and you know many years ago my
[53:31] older brother and i in a pickup on icy
[53:34] roads i've shared the story with you
[53:37] the pickup literally runs off the edge
[53:40] of pretty close about as close as you
[53:42] can get to being a cliff
[53:44] and um
[53:46] you know stops at
[53:47] the pickup the lord does with a rock
[53:50] a rock that falls into
[53:52] the ravine or canyon whatever you want
[53:54] to call it after the pickup is pulled
[53:57] back up
[53:58] and you know saints this is uh
[54:00] you might say a landmark moment in my
[54:02] life because i can look back
[54:05] and uh we live in a world that cursing
[54:09] is seemingly on the tip
[54:12] of humanity's tongue
[54:16] but in a moment like that
[54:20] who you are what you are
[54:22] what is deep inside of you
[54:25] comes out and
[54:27] you find yourself
[54:29] beseeching
[54:31] crying out urgently
[54:35] lord help us
[54:38] and you know i would pray that we could
[54:40] make that
[54:41] something that was more of a first
[54:43] nature than a second nature to us
[54:47] that our reaction of life day to day
[54:50] would be to cry out to the lord you say
[54:52] well brother paul you mean when we have
[54:54] troubles no
[54:55] i mean when you're just living
[54:58] when you are just
[54:59] walking through life day to day
[55:02] lord help us to learn to cry out to you
[55:05] so as i enter into my thought i pray ask
[55:08] for your prayers now paul is there
[55:10] beseeching them in meekness and the
[55:13] gentleness of christ and you know it's
[55:15] very interesting because brother branham
[55:16] shows us now how the contrasting nature
[55:19] that people were looking and brother
[55:21] brown talks about the kind o priest now
[55:23] they're comparing jesus christ as he is
[55:26] there in their midst and they're
[55:27] comparing his life to the kind old
[55:29] priest and you honestly can't blame the
[55:32] people for looking at the kind of priest
[55:35] and feeling more kindred spirit to him
[55:37] than they did to jesus christ because he
[55:40] is there plattered a rope and is
[55:41] whipping them in the temple and their
[55:43] kind old priest was the one whose
[55:44] brother brown says paid their doctor
[55:46] bill help them pay the rent all these
[55:47] kind of things but my brother and sister
[55:49] there is a certain nature that is not as
[55:54] it were totally revealed to the world
[55:56] now if you understand what i'm saying
[55:58] there's a nature of jesus christ that
[56:00] this world out here will never recognize
[56:03] because those that have entered in in
[56:04] the spirit come into that atmosphere and
[56:08] i don't believe there should not be one
[56:10] in this church today that would say that
[56:12] they do not know the meekness and
[56:14] gentleness of christ amen
[56:16] because he's actually even in this world
[56:18] that we live in all the difficulties and
[56:21] struggles he comes with a tender hand in
[56:24] the midnight hour during the day
[56:26] whatever the circumstances are alive and
[56:28] he actually treats us you will not see
[56:31] the spirit of christ abusing his bride
[56:35] nor will you see the spirit of christ
[56:36] which is supposed to be on the ministry
[56:39] abusing the bride if they say they have
[56:41] the nature of god so it's there that we
[56:43] understand that the meekness and
[56:45] gentlemen of christ is not necessarily
[56:48] according as we see it in the flesh in
[56:51] the flesh we say well everyone ought to
[56:53] just love everyone and we're going to
[56:55] overlook each other's faults my brother
[56:57] and sister it's good to overlook each
[56:58] other's faults as we joke the other day
[57:00] about giving a pass but my brother and
[57:02] sister the word also talks about going
[57:04] to a brother to restore them
[57:06] and so we see that we don't want to get
[57:08] confused in these things right because
[57:10] the lord will correct us
[57:12] and we ought to say thank you lord
[57:15] thank you lord for correction amen so
[57:18] it's there that we see what is happening
[57:21] now through the word and uh you know it
[57:24] it is moving us it's uh
[57:27] coming and and paul says you know uh i i
[57:30] i want to come to you in the pride right
[57:33] or correct or proper fashion
[57:36] paul didn't come and debase himself my
[57:39] brother and sister just simply to debase
[57:41] himself when he said i come humbly or i
[57:43] come lowly before you what he was
[57:45] talking was he's not going to come as it
[57:48] was as a charging bull into the midst
[57:50] and bowl everybody but as he also spoke
[57:53] he said i am all things
[57:55] and to all people
[57:58] so that means we see that paul come
[58:01] and where he might correct one in such a
[58:03] fashion he would come over as it were
[58:06] and give compassion to another and we'd
[58:08] say but they have the same issue but do
[58:10] you realize none of us have exactly the
[58:11] same issue
[58:13] because one has this complex and one has
[58:16] that complex and one has there's all
[58:17] these mitigating factors and christ
[58:20] comes and you will see it in the
[58:21] preaching of the word sometimes the holy
[58:23] spirit comes down almost as a demanding
[58:26] task master and speaks to spirit and
[58:29] says depart i cast you out
[58:33] and in others
[58:34] you'll find the prophet of god
[58:37] imploring the holy spirit to come
[58:40] and move
[58:41] amen
[58:43] you see because of the nature of the
[58:44] individual god knew just exactly how to
[58:47] come in there
[58:53] and we'll see that you know we look back
[58:55] and why they were there in those days
[58:57] and they traveled in sailing ships and
[58:59] they walked a lot and you know had a
[59:02] donkey and a cart and all these things
[59:04] my brother and sister but as we look at
[59:06] verse two you'll see as he beseeches
[59:08] them again that uh i i want to come i
[59:12] want to come with a correct conscience
[59:14] i'm just going to preach this to you i'm
[59:16] going to come with a correct uh
[59:17] conscience uh
[59:19] to to approach you and to discern your
[59:22] need and to be able to present jesus
[59:25] christ to you with confidence but i'm
[59:27] not going to come in and be bold where i
[59:29] should be humble and be humble where i
[59:31] should be bold and my brother and sister
[59:34] that takes the leadership of the holy
[59:35] ghost amen that takes something within
[59:38] the man to be able to be moved or as it
[59:41] were controlled by the spirit of god to
[59:43] give compassion where compassion was
[59:46] necessary and to come with force where
[59:48] force is necessary and so paul is coming
[59:52] and speaking to them in this fashion and
[59:54] and you know he said uh i'm going to
[59:56] come and i'm going to
[59:58] come and be bold against some
[1:00:02] oh look how this works my brother and
[1:00:04] sister everybody wants everybody i'm
[1:00:06] telling you we're coming to a day the
[1:00:08] scripture says that those things done in
[1:00:10] secret will be made open amen there's
[1:00:14] coming a day that sin will not be able
[1:00:17] to sit in the church but the holy ghost
[1:00:20] will come and we'll heat it up so hot it
[1:00:24] will either be refined
[1:00:26] or cast out oh my brother and sister now
[1:00:29] don't misunderstand this the prophet of
[1:00:31] god said those two spirits would be in
[1:00:33] the church to the very end so my brother
[1:00:35] and sister just because a body is
[1:00:37] sitting on a pew doesn't mean that they
[1:00:39] are a bride member and it does not mean
[1:00:42] they have been cast out or you know you
[1:00:44] understand what i'm saying it is there
[1:00:46] you don't discern that the two are there
[1:00:49] until the harvest that's right
[1:00:52] but look at this now
[1:00:54] he says i think to be bold against some
[1:00:57] sound sounds very very selective does it
[1:01:00] not but look what follows that
[1:01:02] which think of us as if we walked
[1:01:05] according to the flesh
[1:01:09] now saints
[1:01:11] i'm not asking this for an
[1:01:12] acknowledgement to me or the ministry
[1:01:14] here
[1:01:15] but has the word ever come and cut you
[1:01:17] to the quick yes
[1:01:22] amen wouldn't have been nice if the lord
[1:01:25] would have just sent you an email and
[1:01:26] made a suggestion
[1:01:29] but that's not how it works
[1:01:31] right
[1:01:32] but you see
[1:01:33] by your acknowledgement and i just for
[1:01:35] example by your acknowledgement you see
[1:01:38] it's there that something has come and
[1:01:40] moved upon you
[1:01:42] but look even in paul's day there were
[1:01:45] those people in the middle that said oh
[1:01:48] he preached on this
[1:01:50] he meant that at me
[1:01:53] he's picking on me
[1:01:56] he's got a grudge against
[1:01:59] me
[1:02:02] and paul's dealing with this
[1:02:04] which think of us as if
[1:02:06] we walked according to the flesh
[1:02:09] now i want you to hold that thought
[1:02:10] because it will tie together as we move
[1:02:12] further down my brother and sister i
[1:02:14] would trust as we come here today that
[1:02:16] we would all come knowing who we are
[1:02:19] sinners safe by grace amen by the grace
[1:02:21] of almighty god are we able to respond
[1:02:24] to the word did you know it takes a
[1:02:26] measure of grace to repent from unbelief
[1:02:31] that is the grace of god that would
[1:02:33] anoint us to be able to look at the air
[1:02:36] in our own life and say i am wrong and
[1:02:37] repent
[1:02:39] because he we live in a day where the
[1:02:41] scripture says that the people would
[1:02:42] become hardened
[1:02:45] they would become hardened in their own
[1:02:46] hearts
[1:02:48] and so as we see the apostle paul is
[1:02:50] looking at and there were people in that
[1:02:52] day that that really actually thought
[1:02:54] that paul was just dealing in the flesh
[1:02:57] and and you know trying to discount the
[1:02:59] moving of the holy spirit they they were
[1:03:01] not moved they they did not recognize
[1:03:03] the presence of god and the purpose of
[1:03:06] the moving of the holy spirit now we go
[1:03:08] back in the old testament my brother and
[1:03:09] sister and you do not see the holy ghost
[1:03:11] as it were words uh spread out through
[1:03:14] the old testament as we do in the new
[1:03:16] testament but it's the same god same
[1:03:18] spirit amen just because the vocabulary
[1:03:21] of that original covenant was not the
[1:03:23] same as the covenant to us so it's not
[1:03:26] expressed in that same fashion because
[1:03:28] the covenant was of you'll see this now
[1:03:31] the covenant was of the
[1:03:34] flesh
[1:03:36] to israel
[1:03:38] and it is of the spirit
[1:03:40] to us
[1:03:42] so israel's always looked in the flesh
[1:03:45] as it were to prophets and looking for a
[1:03:48] messiah and do and now here in our
[1:03:50] generation the prophet of god says now
[1:03:52] god is moving no longer in the flesh oh
[1:03:56] i hope you can dig deep on this because
[1:03:58] this is a problem when we started
[1:04:00] dealing in the flesh that's where
[1:04:01] spirits of idolatry creep in because
[1:04:03] we're looking at the flesh well people
[1:04:05] while they did this for the prophets and
[1:04:07] they did that for the prophets and and
[1:04:09] it was accounted to them well my brother
[1:04:10] and sister are those that were good to
[1:04:12] brother branham god's going to give them
[1:04:13] a reward but you see god said i'm moving
[1:04:16] you into the spirit so if you're going
[1:04:18] to raise up something to worship raise
[1:04:21] up the spirit of god amen raise up the
[1:04:24] holy ghost and say thank you lord for
[1:04:26] saving my soul and bless those lord that
[1:04:29] have labored for us in our midst and
[1:04:33] you know
[1:04:37] see
[1:04:39] that same spirit of trying to discount
[1:04:41] the moving of the holy spirit
[1:04:43] has been around since the very beginning
[1:04:46] and so you look at that nothing's ever
[1:04:48] changed you see what happens saints
[1:04:51] now look if i have to preach on
[1:04:52] something today that might just touch
[1:04:54] your life
[1:04:55] just take these original scriptures
[1:04:58] that we're not here
[1:04:59] to walk according to the flesh
[1:05:07] a pastor is highly overrated
[1:05:11] and highly underrated
[1:05:14] depends on which side you're looking at
[1:05:19] but that spirit to turn everything
[1:05:21] carnal
[1:05:22] is still here
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:27] you know we had a lovely moving of the
[1:05:29] holy spirit here in the church here a
[1:05:31] few services ago well it's been in many
[1:05:33] services but one that struck me in
[1:05:34] particular
[1:05:38] you know saints it
[1:05:41] you can be here and you can recognize
[1:05:42] the moving of the holy spirit
[1:05:45] and satan will come in
[1:05:47] and throw out one little thing
[1:05:50] to draw your attention away
[1:05:54] we're sitting right here god's present
[1:05:55] in our midst yes can we say amen
[1:05:58] we've been having good services brother
[1:06:00] chris brother david
[1:06:02] you know
[1:06:03] we've been having good services saints
[1:06:05] and satan's still there throwing the
[1:06:06] pebbles trying to distract and disturb
[1:06:09] and to bring up
[1:06:11] you know i can say this in in a bit of
[1:06:13] humor years ago
[1:06:15] my lovely wife looked me in the face and
[1:06:17] says you know paul i'm going to serve
[1:06:18] god no matter what you do
[1:06:20] it cut me very deep in my heart but it
[1:06:22] was the truth my brother and sister at
[1:06:24] this stage of my life i went to church i
[1:06:26] i worked for a ranch and and they wanted
[1:06:29] me i had to work i had to take care of
[1:06:31] cattle every other weekend and and
[1:06:33] sometimes i found excuse not to go at
[1:06:36] all during a month or whatever and my
[1:06:38] wife loaded up our our children and drug
[1:06:40] them off to church faithfully mothers
[1:06:43] now my heart is with you when
[1:06:45] circumstances are such
[1:06:47] but mothers if you
[1:06:49] find yourself struggling to go to church
[1:06:53] on wednesday or sunday because you've
[1:06:55] got so many kids
[1:06:57] the solution is not to stay home the
[1:06:59] solution is to pray that god gives you
[1:07:01] strength
[1:07:02] that you'll teach those children
[1:07:05] that going to church is priority nowhere
[1:07:07] will you find that streaming
[1:07:09] is our priority
[1:07:11] the word says take them to church
[1:07:15] and attend it ourself remember what
[1:07:16] brother brown says don't you deliver
[1:07:18] your children to sunday school you take
[1:07:21] them
[1:07:23] see the answer is prayer brothers now i
[1:07:25] understand circumstances nobody
[1:07:27] misunderstood me i understand
[1:07:28] circumstances but brothers
[1:07:30] i've been there before where you work 80
[1:07:32] or 90 hours a week and you say i'm too
[1:07:35] tired to go to church
[1:07:38] but you get down and pray and say lord
[1:07:41] i need to be in the house of god
[1:07:44] i need it myself personally
[1:07:47] lord i need this as a minister it's easy
[1:07:49] to say i'm too tired i'll get someone
[1:07:51] else god lays something on your heart
[1:07:53] don't don't succumb to that i'm too
[1:07:55] tired thing get down and pray lord you
[1:07:58] promised you poured strength into david
[1:08:01] amen i'm going to claim that same
[1:08:03] promise lord and pour strength into me
[1:08:06] and get up and go do it
[1:08:08] and you will go to church and you'll say
[1:08:10] well i stayed up too late but my brother
[1:08:12] and sister under the anointing of your
[1:08:14] prayer that god heard right you are
[1:08:16] crying out you're drawing night unto god
[1:08:19] and crying out to him and he said i
[1:08:22] heard your heart and i answered your
[1:08:24] prayer that's taken loosely from the
[1:08:26] book of psalms and it is there what is
[1:08:29] it my brother and sister you ask for
[1:08:30] strength he'll give you strength but you
[1:08:32] never exercise that and you'll never
[1:08:35] experience it
[1:08:37] and people say i'm just simply can't do
[1:08:39] that
[1:08:40] that's because you never exercised it
[1:08:45] hallelujah
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:48] you see so it's there
[1:08:50] spirits trying to turn everything carnal
[1:08:53] and he said in the third verse he says
[1:08:54] oh we walk in the flesh we do not war
[1:08:56] after the flesh you see my brother and
[1:08:58] sister i'm going to preach loosely
[1:09:00] because you're message believers
[1:09:03] we are here today with message believers
[1:09:05] amen now my brother and sister you look
[1:09:07] at that and you see how that it is
[1:09:11] that the prophet of god said this bride
[1:09:13] of this day
[1:09:15] she would come to a place
[1:09:18] that she would be able to discern the
[1:09:20] spirits
[1:09:22] think about this
[1:09:24] people concerned it's going to be so
[1:09:25] close to deceive the very elect
[1:09:31] there's a
[1:09:33] gray zone for you to be deceived
[1:09:37] what did i forget
[1:09:40] if
[1:09:42] it were amen
[1:09:44] possible
[1:09:46] but you see satan comes and he he has
[1:09:48] white it out
[1:09:51] and so it's all oh we could be no saints
[1:09:54] we can stand here this morning in
[1:09:56] complete confidence i cannot be deceived
[1:10:00] amen and we got a lot more to worry
[1:10:02] about if you don't have confidence in
[1:10:04] that word than you do about that
[1:10:06] possibility of the if right
[1:10:09] amen because if you are not sealed until
[1:10:12] the day of your redemption we have an
[1:10:14] option here today to get sealed
[1:10:17] that's the issue my brother and sister
[1:10:19] not the power of satan satan's power has
[1:10:22] been bound by the word
[1:10:24] i preached this to you before i'll
[1:10:26] remind you again that when god gave
[1:10:29] permission to satan and opened the hedge
[1:10:32] of job and said you can do whatever you
[1:10:35] want to him but you can't take his
[1:10:38] life
[1:10:39] you realize saints god put a hedge
[1:10:42] around the devil he opened the heads to
[1:10:45] job but he put a hedge around the devil
[1:10:47] and put a limitation of what satan could
[1:10:50] do to joke i'll tell you what we might
[1:10:53] suffer illness we might suffer poverty
[1:10:55] and be cold as that song says i never
[1:10:58] promised
[1:11:00] that you wouldn't be oh how do those
[1:11:02] words go
[1:11:05] yes
[1:11:06] yeah i never promised that that wouldn't
[1:11:08] be but he did promise that satan can't
[1:11:11] take your life
[1:11:13] your life is sealed in christ
[1:11:16] until the day of your redemption
[1:11:20] oh hallelujah you see satan he like you
[1:11:23] to believe that there's possibilities
[1:11:26] but my brother and sister it's the
[1:11:27] devil's interpretation of the if
[1:11:31] amen
[1:11:32] but we're here to declare all things are
[1:11:35] possible in christ jesus and he said i
[1:11:38] have sealed you till the day of your
[1:11:40] redemption
[1:11:42] oh hallelujah you see so true believer
[1:11:44] this is what's coming down in our day my
[1:11:46] brother and sister now that doesn't mean
[1:11:48] that we haven't befriended someone and
[1:11:50] they turn out not to really be like as
[1:11:51] it were a true friend there's certain
[1:11:53] things that god just binds us from like
[1:11:56] i just ask you why would the prophet of
[1:11:58] god in some of these people that he rubs
[1:12:00] soldiers with why would the prophet of
[1:12:02] god you might say be and these are the
[1:12:05] words of the unbeliever oblivious
[1:12:10] well i'm sure glad my brother and sister
[1:12:14] that we are oblivious to some things
[1:12:21] now i'll give you an example i'm getting
[1:12:22] off my this is this branch number one
[1:12:25] here but my brother and sister remember
[1:12:27] when the prophet of god goes to mr
[1:12:29] walker
[1:12:30] and he's there and this one man here
[1:12:32] true
[1:12:33] man of god but this other man
[1:12:35] had children with another woman and he
[1:12:37] was he was now imagine now you walked
[1:12:40] around your whole life
[1:12:42] and that was you realize how weary you
[1:12:44] would become
[1:12:45] that everyone you looked at
[1:12:47] you just know everything about them you
[1:12:50] see god knew he had to spare his prophet
[1:12:53] so there's certain things and people
[1:12:54] don't comprehend this but you just think
[1:12:56] about that if every bit of unbelief and
[1:12:59] every sin that would so easily be said
[1:13:02] people had been revealed to the prophet
[1:13:04] he would have moved to the wilderness
[1:13:06] and would have become a hermit because
[1:13:08] he would have been overwhelmed
[1:13:10] so god veiled some of that and people
[1:13:12] say well why didn't he know this and why
[1:13:13] didn't he know that because god chose to
[1:13:15] veil it
[1:13:17] wasn't had nothing to do with william
[1:13:18] branham it was god failing at saints
[1:13:21] and there's parts of this message that
[1:13:23] are you might say being opened up
[1:13:25] nuggets that are being dug up and people
[1:13:27] say well where i've had this happen
[1:13:29] personally people are like where did
[1:13:31] brother branham say that i can't find
[1:13:33] that
[1:13:34] well imagine my brother and sister if
[1:13:36] the prophet of god in 33 years of
[1:13:38] ministry had tried to preach this whole
[1:13:39] bible
[1:13:41] okay saints we'll meet back here in 30
[1:13:44] minutes for our fourth service of the
[1:13:46] day
[1:13:47] and then he is a man with a burnt out
[1:13:52] see
[1:13:54] god gave us a shovel
[1:13:57] spiritual shovel
[1:13:58] called revelation
[1:14:00] and we can dig the nuggets right out of
[1:14:02] this because do you know if you study
[1:14:05] the message and i don't want to sound
[1:14:06] like presumptuous here but if you study
[1:14:09] the message and you pray
[1:14:11] that there are certain signs that have
[1:14:13] been laid out
[1:14:15] that says you know kind of like the old
[1:14:17] timers maps you know
[1:14:19] go up to such and such correct trail
[1:14:22] and if the water falls at 10 am
[1:14:26] look across the point of the rock
[1:14:29] and below that
[1:14:30] and a hundred yards to the west
[1:14:34] well if you just blundered up the trail
[1:14:37] you'll never find it
[1:14:40] but if you followed it
[1:14:43] well how are we going to find it you're
[1:14:44] going to dig in the word for it
[1:14:47] no your pastor or some evangelist is not
[1:14:49] going to come and hand you a map
[1:14:52] you're going to dig for it
[1:14:54] and when you have dug for it you will
[1:14:56] find it
[1:14:58] hallelujah okay i'll get back on track
[1:15:00] that was the other branch of the service
[1:15:03] amen so a true believer is able to
[1:15:05] separate the spirits now you see my
[1:15:07] brother and sister if we are going to
[1:15:09] preach from the flesh
[1:15:11] then what we will do is closely analyze
[1:15:13] your lives we will watch you and we will
[1:15:16] see every little thing that you do wrong
[1:15:18] and what we'll do also is we will
[1:15:20] develop a network of spies
[1:15:26] come on i've been in churches that did
[1:15:27] that
[1:15:31] and then because we have the information
[1:15:34] that you were out
[1:15:36] at the blah blah
[1:15:38] with so and so
[1:15:40] we can preach about that
[1:15:44] that's in the flesh
[1:15:47] but you know that kind of preaching
[1:15:48] never changed a single
[1:15:51] individual
[1:15:52] see we have to recognize the difference
[1:15:54] between condemnation and conviction
[1:15:58] and condemnation can actually be cranked
[1:16:00] down so tight that people will conform
[1:16:03] to it
[1:16:04] i don't want you to ever ever owe saints
[1:16:06] i pray i never preach that way but don't
[1:16:09] allow condemnation to dictate your
[1:16:12] spiritual walk
[1:16:13] amen it needs to be the holy ghost
[1:16:16] moving on you
[1:16:17] amen so you see you can look in the
[1:16:19] church and see a trend
[1:16:22] and then you can preach about it
[1:16:24] and then it comes out in such a way
[1:16:26] reminds me of a time many years ago a
[1:16:28] minister
[1:16:29] actually preaching at his own son
[1:16:33] get this
[1:16:34] preaching at his own
[1:16:36] son over the pulpit
[1:16:38] about going on vacation
[1:16:41] and getting out there on the beach and
[1:16:43] taking your shirt off and wearing these
[1:16:45] shorts and walking up and down the beach
[1:16:47] and you say well i'm on vacation no
[1:16:50] you're a son of god 24 hours a day seven
[1:16:52] days a week
[1:16:55] and a whole family quit the church
[1:16:57] because the pastor was preaching them
[1:17:01] and the pastor was
[1:17:03] i was talking to my own
[1:17:06] son
[1:17:10] come on
[1:17:13] comes real when it comes right from the
[1:17:14] horse's mouth
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:17] but you see somebody thought he was
[1:17:20] preaching in the flesh and he was
[1:17:22] preaching at them
[1:17:24] hello that's called a guilty conscience
[1:17:27] amen there's nothing beyond a guilty
[1:17:30] conscience before the preacher's done
[1:17:32] you have already analyzed his reasoning
[1:17:35] his purpose his motive and that was at
[1:17:38] me if you see the red dot on your
[1:17:40] forehead it might be to you
[1:17:44] but you see how satan works
[1:17:46] he break up a whole family break them
[1:17:48] out of church peel them right out of
[1:17:50] church
[1:17:51] and then the pastor says no i was
[1:17:53] preaching to my own boy
[1:17:55] and i preached the same sermon to him
[1:17:57] last night and i thought he ought to
[1:17:58] hear it again today
[1:18:02] so
[1:18:03] you see
[1:18:06] if you ever feel like your preacher is
[1:18:08] preaching
[1:18:09] about
[1:18:10] you hey moment honesty do you ever feel
[1:18:14] like brother paul's preaching about you
[1:18:20] i was hoping nobody would raise their
[1:18:21] hand
[1:18:26] let's clarify that let's narrow this
[1:18:28] focus down do you ever feel like the
[1:18:30] holy ghost is talking to you
[1:18:33] amen i sure hope you don't think paul is
[1:18:36] preaching to you or we're back to verse
[1:18:38] one
[1:18:41] or 2 amen
[1:18:44] but you see we need to recognize this
[1:18:46] fact my brother and sister that it is
[1:18:48] there and we'll have a little clarity as
[1:18:50] we come down into this you see my
[1:18:52] brother and sister if we ever come to
[1:18:54] the place now i say this once again if
[1:18:56] we ever come to the place my brother and
[1:18:58] sister that we are out of the word and
[1:19:00] we are into the carnal and we remain
[1:19:03] there now there are certain times that
[1:19:05] there are certain things that are carnal
[1:19:06] right there's these people now that
[1:19:08] believe everything that brother branham
[1:19:10] said as thus saith the lord but you can
[1:19:12] comb through the message and see brother
[1:19:14] branham talking about brothers stopping
[1:19:17] on the highway getting out and throwing
[1:19:18] was it rocks or snowballs at each other
[1:19:20] amen and throwing rocks at each other
[1:19:22] okay where's the spiritual significance
[1:19:25] do we condone now that we all have to
[1:19:27] get in the car and get out here on the
[1:19:29] countryside stop a car get out and throw
[1:19:31] rocks at each other
[1:19:33] no bro the prophet of god was just
[1:19:35] sharing himself as a man
[1:19:37] and that he loved these brothers and
[1:19:39] this was their humorous as it were see
[1:19:41] somebody might not see that's humorous
[1:19:42] but this was their humorous way of
[1:19:44] dealing with each other i'm right you're
[1:19:46] wrong
[1:19:48] you know
[1:19:49] come on the prophet of god didn't
[1:19:50] condemn him for that you won't find on
[1:19:52] tape where he said you brothers have an
[1:19:53] evil spirit you threw rocks at each
[1:19:55] other
[1:19:57] see there's some of these things that
[1:19:59] are just he's sharing a little bit of
[1:20:00] life but let me tell you i think
[1:20:02] sometimes they're a little deeper than
[1:20:04] we do think because i felt like throwing
[1:20:06] rocks at you before oh did i say that
[1:20:12] you understand saints
[1:20:15] we have frustrations
[1:20:17] we have this flesh that we have to deal
[1:20:19] with but it should never become
[1:20:22] a warfare
[1:20:23] of flesh and blood
[1:20:26] so we look at this and recognize that
[1:20:28] while we walk in the flesh we're not
[1:20:30] going to war after the flesh because all
[1:20:32] that does is separate amen amen
[1:20:35] so you know it's there that he's
[1:20:36] preaching about me but the weapons of
[1:20:38] our warfare are not carnal and i say to
[1:20:40] dave saints if you fight a carnal battle
[1:20:43] as a christian you will find yourself a
[1:20:46] loser every single time
[1:20:48] amen we were not called to walk in the
[1:20:50] flesh but called to walk in the spirit
[1:20:52] amen and not just a spirit but the holy
[1:20:55] spirit because many people walk with
[1:20:57] spirits amen but it doesn't mean it's a
[1:20:59] correct spirit so look at this now but
[1:21:02] mighty through god to the pulling down
[1:21:05] of strongholds
[1:21:08] but see when you see the word being
[1:21:09] preached
[1:21:11] and you say this is from the lord it
[1:21:14] changes the way you accept it
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:18] people are saying well we'll only listen
[1:21:19] to tapes and i say we should be
[1:21:22] or reading or however it's best for you
[1:21:26] it's the pure word that's the only way i
[1:21:28] can get the pure word you know what
[1:21:29] they've done they just rip the page out
[1:21:34] because that was not what the prophet of
[1:21:35] god said
[1:21:36] it's not what our bible says
[1:21:38] but you see then we start to look at it
[1:21:41] as though everyone is suspect
[1:21:46] and if you think i hope this doesn't
[1:21:48] offend anybody but if you think that
[1:21:50] just listening to tapes is a solution
[1:21:52] then why do we now have a burgeoning
[1:21:54] growth of people listening to the tapes
[1:21:57] of different ideologies about the tapes
[1:22:03] when will they recognize it's not a
[1:22:05] flesh and blood you listen to tapes
[1:22:06] brother i have nothing to do with you
[1:22:08] you go to a church that has a real life
[1:22:09] preacher i have nothing to do with you
[1:22:11] when will they recognize it's neither of
[1:22:13] those things but it's a spirit that has
[1:22:16] come to conquer and divide and conquer
[1:22:19] amen so when they start to recognize
[1:22:21] that spirit they can discern that and my
[1:22:25] the tape will speak to you or a preacher
[1:22:27] will speak to you
[1:22:28] amen so what is a stronghold
[1:22:37] for the pulling down
[1:22:39] not the building up
[1:22:41] let me throw a stronghold in this right
[1:22:43] here
[1:22:44] saints i hope it never takes root in
[1:22:46] this church but a stronghold will be
[1:22:48] when we only fellowship with
[1:22:50] these everyone else ex we fellowship
[1:22:53] here
[1:22:55] starting to build a stronghold
[1:22:57] i've looked at churches that had strong
[1:22:59] clicks in them
[1:23:01] and when trouble come
[1:23:03] it turned from click to fracture and
[1:23:06] from fracture to golf
[1:23:09] extreme division
[1:23:13] when men will look you in the face and
[1:23:14] say
[1:23:17] we have nothing to do with them
[1:23:24] let's jump on the other side of that
[1:23:25] equation
[1:23:27] they
[1:23:28] our bride
[1:23:30] redeemed before the foundation of the
[1:23:31] world and you're now with your mouth in
[1:23:33] the flesh
[1:23:34] saying i want nothing to do with them
[1:23:38] what position does it put it
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:41] what we should be doing is saying lord
[1:23:44] sorry brother trevor this man just makes
[1:23:46] me so mad lord i pray i heard the
[1:23:49] prophet say that it's iron upon iron the
[1:23:52] rock
[1:23:53] oh
[1:23:54] i need you brother
[1:23:58] but the spirit comes
[1:24:00] and says well in a nice message polite
[1:24:03] way
[1:24:04] i'll just
[1:24:06] wait
[1:24:07] until they got their back turned
[1:24:09] and i'm out the door
[1:24:11] that way i don't have to shake their
[1:24:13] hand
[1:24:14] and i don't have to say god bless you
[1:24:19] you don't think this is real
[1:24:21] it's really real
[1:24:23] it's really really really real
[1:24:25] amen
[1:24:26] you see
[1:24:27] we walk in this flesh but we're not
[1:24:29] going to war after it because we've got
[1:24:31] the holy ghost we've had a nature change
[1:24:33] we've got a different spirit
[1:24:35] this prophet of god just reading early
[1:24:36] this morning amen he's talking about a
[1:24:39] new
[1:24:40] creation
[1:24:42] in christ jesus and that's branch number
[1:24:45] two and we won't get off on that one
[1:24:47] though we walk in the flesh we don't war
[1:24:48] after the flesh for our weapon saints
[1:24:51] are not carnal but mighty through god
[1:24:53] for the pulling down of strongholds and
[1:24:56] so it's the word then amen look it's not
[1:25:00] the preacher it's not this man not that
[1:25:02] man that is determined what the
[1:25:04] stronghold is in your life do you
[1:25:06] realize that strongholds can be created
[1:25:08] by you
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:10] well you know i have a little complex
[1:25:12] and i don't feel comfortable around
[1:25:14] people
[1:25:16] you're building a stronghold
[1:25:19] and you say well i've always been a
[1:25:20] quiet person you're fortifying your
[1:25:22] stronghold
[1:25:25] and god's here to tear it down amen
[1:25:27] god's here to knock down everything well
[1:25:29] the prophet of god talking about you
[1:25:31] know the the ducks and whatever and the
[1:25:33] fence and the water rose up and then all
[1:25:35] the lines disappeared and the ducks
[1:25:37] fellowship together
[1:25:39] god bless you ducks
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:43] now see
[1:25:44] when we receive the word
[1:25:47] as from the lord we accept the word then
[1:25:49] as it's preached it's a completely
[1:25:51] different spirit or approach that comes
[1:25:53] upon it and when we receive it we can
[1:25:55] put it to work you see everything that
[1:25:58] you have
[1:25:59] oh i won't even name any brothers names
[1:26:01] or anything but a brother one time asked
[1:26:03] me some advice and i told him that this
[1:26:06] is how i would do it now what i didn't
[1:26:08] tell them is i've done it over and over
[1:26:10] and over again and i had to learn from
[1:26:12] scratch and i messed up a lot of things
[1:26:14] before i got this right and so i said
[1:26:16] this the way i'd do it and they
[1:26:18] obviously thought i had an opinion which
[1:26:19] was true it was my opinion but it was a
[1:26:21] proven one
[1:26:24] and then i see the brother again and
[1:26:25] asked him how it went and he said well i
[1:26:26] had to go back to the store and buy more
[1:26:28] stuff because i messed it up and i said
[1:26:29] oh how'd you mess it up and he said oh i
[1:26:31] said let me tell you how you messed up
[1:26:34] this is not to be big headed my brother
[1:26:35] and sister but this is just how it works
[1:26:37] there are some things god don't want you
[1:26:38] to experience god don't want you to have
[1:26:41] to be trashed and ground to dust till
[1:26:43] you can say well the lord raised me up
[1:26:45] from dust you put yourself there
[1:26:47] because you didn't listen to the word in
[1:26:48] the beginning the word would allowed you
[1:26:51] to have skirted completely around that
[1:26:53] issue if you had just listened to the
[1:26:55] word
[1:26:57] and so what god's wanting us to do is to
[1:26:59] come and receive the word and when you
[1:27:02] receive it you can put it to work in
[1:27:04] your life and now as i said a stronghold
[1:27:06] is a fortified place and it can be of
[1:27:08] our own making
[1:27:11] and what happens is
[1:27:13] you say why are you tying this together
[1:27:14] well it actually comes right down here
[1:27:16] and ties right in here in verse five
[1:27:22] we can create our own stronghold
[1:27:25] now we look at this in verse five is
[1:27:27] casting down imagination and every high
[1:27:29] thing that exalted itself against the
[1:27:31] knowledge of god and bringing into
[1:27:33] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:27:34] of christ i've heard brothers preach it
[1:27:36] and they preached it correctly and they
[1:27:38] were talking about the lust of the flesh
[1:27:40] and pride of life and lust after money
[1:27:41] and all of these kind of things but my
[1:27:43] brother and sister what if i think you
[1:27:45] don't like me
[1:27:48] i now have an imagination that i decide
[1:27:50] that the people of grace tabernacle
[1:27:52] don't like me
[1:27:54] and my imagination starts to build and
[1:27:57] fortify that i'm not gonna fellowship
[1:27:59] i'm not going to interact i'm not going
[1:28:01] to say god bless you i'm just going to
[1:28:03] become the the almost invisible
[1:28:06] individual in the church because my mind
[1:28:08] says no one cares for me no one prays
[1:28:12] for me no one wants to fellowship with
[1:28:14] me and brick by brick fought by fought
[1:28:18] they are fortifying
[1:28:23] you know many years ago sorry to bring
[1:28:25] this analogy this way but many years ago
[1:28:27] you know sometimes you think you've just
[1:28:29] went crazy they still laugh they still
[1:28:31] remind me of this but when evening my
[1:28:33] fellowship was still on maryland in the
[1:28:35] in the old church i was preaching there
[1:28:38] and god knew what the need was and
[1:28:40] brought it out through oh absolutely
[1:28:45] the silliness
[1:28:47] of preaching
[1:28:50] and i'm making a point
[1:28:52] and i'm sitting there thinking why am i
[1:28:53] making this point i don't even know why
[1:28:55] i'm making this point
[1:28:56] but i said oh it's like this saints
[1:28:59] you have a church fellowship
[1:29:01] and here's a sister already has a
[1:29:03] complex and she come into the church
[1:29:05] fellowship just a little late because
[1:29:07] well she just didn't want to deal with
[1:29:09] everything so she just timed herself to
[1:29:11] come in just at the right time and you
[1:29:14] know it's there that it's and she has
[1:29:16] fluffy green salad
[1:29:20] she actually makes a good fluffy green
[1:29:21] salad
[1:29:22] but when the sister is taking care of
[1:29:24] those things in the kitchen she gives
[1:29:26] her fluffy green salad to those and
[1:29:28] those sisters look around and they say
[1:29:30] my where are we going to put this
[1:29:32] oh here's a spot
[1:29:37] and when the fellowship is over
[1:29:39] the sister goes to get her dish
[1:29:42] and the other fluffy green salad has
[1:29:45] been scraped clean
[1:29:48] and she finds her dish
[1:29:51] up here
[1:29:53] not even touched
[1:29:57] she said i knew it
[1:29:59] i knew it
[1:30:01] nobody in this church
[1:30:03] loves me
[1:30:06] nobody
[1:30:07] cares about me
[1:30:12] saints i'm not talking about paul i'm
[1:30:13] talking about the holy ghost speaking to
[1:30:15] hearts
[1:30:16] and a sister
[1:30:17] oh if you could just see this i'm
[1:30:19] boasting on jesus christ
[1:30:22] i had stopped i'm down the aisle
[1:30:24] i have stopped
[1:30:27] and i'm telling this and a sister right
[1:30:29] here to my right starts weeping
[1:30:36] oh my goodness i've offended someone
[1:30:40] i walk out of church that sister and
[1:30:42] another sister there
[1:30:45] and the sister starts crying she tells
[1:30:47] me
[1:30:49] paul
[1:30:51] that was my
[1:30:53] green salad
[1:30:56] and i got a bitterness to this sister
[1:30:58] because they ate her salad
[1:31:05] sounds humorous doesn't it
[1:31:07] unless you're the one with the complex
[1:31:09] and satan has come to church
[1:31:11] and it started to work on you
[1:31:13] and the sister that was there that was
[1:31:16] at the deal remembers this my brother
[1:31:18] and sister that when it's all over this
[1:31:20] sister solid had never been touched and
[1:31:22] she's moved by it and all three of these
[1:31:24] sisters meet me out in the parking lot
[1:31:26] behind the church and are weeping
[1:31:28] because they saw what satan had done
[1:31:31] started a root of bitterness here
[1:31:33] started the spirit of like oh this
[1:31:34] sister's just a cry baby
[1:31:39] the whole time
[1:31:41] we're viewing it
[1:31:42] in the flesh
[1:31:44] and satan's over there going it's
[1:31:46] working it's working
[1:31:48] it's working
[1:31:49] you know it's pretty funny
[1:31:51] you go down years later
[1:31:54] have somebody walk by you at church god
[1:31:56] bless you brother paul i sure love them
[1:31:58] fluffy green salads
[1:32:00] and you're like you know what thank you
[1:32:01] lord you know what it means i mean
[1:32:03] somebody remembered amen something
[1:32:05] struck a chord with someone saints
[1:32:07] that's what the preaching of the gospel
[1:32:09] is supposed to do to us it's not about
[1:32:11] you're going to hell if you don't line
[1:32:13] up because we as complex humans
[1:32:17] in fact you can look it up i remember
[1:32:19] the sermon i looked through so many of
[1:32:20] them last night today my brother and
[1:32:22] sister finishing up this thought the
[1:32:23] prophet of god is even praying i might
[1:32:25] even have my sermon here how do i know
[1:32:28] lord forgive us
[1:32:30] for our humanness yes
[1:32:35] yes
[1:32:38] hallelujah any of you ever made a fluffy
[1:32:40] green salad
[1:32:43] actually they're inedible
[1:32:47] they're pure fluff
[1:32:50] no nutritional value
[1:32:52] but some of you like them anyway
[1:32:57] what does it do
[1:32:59] we start to build walls
[1:33:01] then we justify our wall
[1:33:04] and we justify the time and the
[1:33:05] circumstance
[1:33:07] the god's here
[1:33:08] to break them walls down
[1:33:10] god's here to break every stronghold we
[1:33:12] have in our life saint i don't care what
[1:33:15] started the building of a stronghold in
[1:33:17] your life i have no friends no one loves
[1:33:19] me whatever the circumstance it doesn't
[1:33:21] matter the word has declared that we are
[1:33:24] mighty through god to the pulling down
[1:33:26] of strongholds and it's time for us as a
[1:33:28] body of believers to say lord this
[1:33:31] little complex i've had this little
[1:33:33] thing i don't even remember where it
[1:33:35] started but lord i want it broke down i
[1:33:38] want it out of my life
[1:33:41] hallelujah
[1:33:43] because sometimes we oh we can look at
[1:33:45] this my brother and sister and say well
[1:33:46] was casting down imaginations well i
[1:33:48] tell you what it's just as detrimental
[1:33:51] to you if your imagination is over
[1:33:53] people don't love you don't want to
[1:33:54] fellowship what don't want to be a part
[1:33:56] of you is if your imagination is over
[1:33:58] you dream about winning the lottery all
[1:33:59] the time and don't have a prayer life
[1:34:01] other than lord let me win the lottery
[1:34:03] so i can destroy my life like i did the
[1:34:05] rest of them
[1:34:08] come on saints vain imaginations it
[1:34:10] doesn't matter the content
[1:34:13] amen when you are wasting the thoughts
[1:34:15] that should be committed to serving god
[1:34:18] worshiping god thinking on the word you
[1:34:21] waste them on things of negative or
[1:34:23] things you think are positive oh let me
[1:34:26] tell you if i ever won a lottery i
[1:34:28] already have a list of what i'll do with
[1:34:30] the money
[1:34:37] imagine you'll know it's from the lord
[1:34:38] when that winning lottery ticket goes
[1:34:40] out of the sky
[1:34:45] and lands at your feet
[1:34:48] and scribbled across the top i'm a
[1:34:49] winner
[1:34:52] otherwise as believers
[1:34:54] you got money to waste on that kind of
[1:34:56] garbage you better throw it in the
[1:34:57] offering
[1:34:58] plate let it go to the far off lands for
[1:35:01] this gospel or look around in the
[1:35:04] assembly and use it to help lift up a
[1:35:06] life of another one you see that's the
[1:35:08] devil's imagination that he's got and
[1:35:10] people throw their money out like
[1:35:12] nothing i pray christians are real
[1:35:14] christians aren't doing that i pray
[1:35:16] that's my heart's desire i pray amen now
[1:35:19] look at this
[1:35:20] oh this is the part now we're at the
[1:35:21] meat of the service and time's up
[1:35:23] oh my how does this happen say
[1:35:27] having verse sex and having in readiness
[1:35:30] to revenge all disobedience when your
[1:35:32] obedience is fulfilled now you cannot
[1:35:35] come into the state of the correct
[1:35:38] spirit of revenge
[1:35:40] until you're obedient to the word of god
[1:35:43] now imagine we're kind of joking in the
[1:35:44] back room hallelujah
[1:35:46] i get this morning
[1:35:48] to have revenge
[1:35:51] praise the lord this morning i can come
[1:35:54] and have revenge
[1:35:58] boy if you said that out of context
[1:36:00] people would be all nervous looking at
[1:36:01] you like what has happened to our pastor
[1:36:04] he's up there slobbering and yelling
[1:36:06] about taking revenge that's right when i
[1:36:08] have come into obedience i can then come
[1:36:13] back my brother and sister and wreak
[1:36:15] judgment on the spirit of disobedience
[1:36:18] and do you know what that does to the
[1:36:20] devil when he has pulled your string or
[1:36:23] push your button day after day year
[1:36:25] after year and one day you stand up and
[1:36:27] say lord i'm going to be obedient to
[1:36:30] your word and you commit to that and you
[1:36:32] walk into that and the devil pushes the
[1:36:35] button and you electrocute him
[1:36:39] when you bind him up tie him up with a
[1:36:42] word and throw him back where he came
[1:36:45] from it's like that's what you get devil
[1:36:48] that's what you get for putting a spirit
[1:36:50] of disobedience on me for year after
[1:36:53] year and days of my life binding me in
[1:36:56] the spirit where i could not worship god
[1:36:58] i could not take the promise of god and
[1:37:00] let it fully be applied to my life
[1:37:02] because here was a big glaring ugly face
[1:37:06] of disobedience
[1:37:09] but now
[1:37:10] i get by the word
[1:37:13] now you see my brother and sister this
[1:37:14] comes down the prophet of god shows us
[1:37:16] clearly
[1:37:18] we don't have power i have no power to
[1:37:20] bind the devil you have no power to bind
[1:37:22] the devil
[1:37:23] but you've got authority
[1:37:26] to lose the power to bind the devil
[1:37:30] now come on
[1:37:32] i hope this don't cause any of you to
[1:37:33] cringe or get upset with me because it's
[1:37:35] not in the flesh
[1:37:38] maybe i shouldn't have said that because
[1:37:39] it sounds like i'm defending myself
[1:37:44] the reason you're not seeing
[1:37:47] these things loosed in your life
[1:37:50] it's because the spirit of disobedience
[1:37:53] is still present
[1:37:55] it's time for you to bind the spirit of
[1:37:57] disobedience
[1:37:59] by stepping in oh you can say i bind you
[1:38:01] spirit of disobedience i bind you spirit
[1:38:04] of disobedience i bind you satan but you
[1:38:06] see if disobedience is still our life
[1:38:08] satan just goes
[1:38:12] but when you step into obedience
[1:38:15] you step into that position god says
[1:38:17] look at that my sons and daughters
[1:38:20] what am i smelling
[1:38:22] oh yes
[1:38:25] they're praying
[1:38:27] they're worshiping
[1:38:28] they're following my word
[1:38:30] and all of a sudden authority
[1:38:33] is calm the power is loosed
[1:38:36] and you
[1:38:37] are binding
[1:38:39] and you are wreaking
[1:38:41] vengeance
[1:38:43] on disobedience
[1:38:45] when that spirit of disobedience would
[1:38:47] rise up you can stand there and say
[1:38:49] satan that's your lie the same one you
[1:38:52] told the eve in the beginning it was a
[1:38:55] lie then it's a lie now and i won't
[1:38:57] accept it
[1:38:59] i don't need any more your knowledge
[1:39:00] devil
[1:39:02] i've got the word i've got revelation i
[1:39:04] don't need your knowledge
[1:39:06] i've been asking the lord
[1:39:08] because you see but i want you to catch
[1:39:10] this before we move on i have more here
[1:39:12] but i just feel led to move on having a
[1:39:14] readiness to revenge all disobedience
[1:39:18] when
[1:39:19] your obedience is fulfilled
[1:39:24] in other words you can't simply go on
[1:39:26] being disobedient and expect god to
[1:39:29] honor that
[1:39:30] come on saints i love you
[1:39:33] i love you
[1:39:34] in fact
[1:39:35] paul
[1:39:38] he touched this so well just i'm so
[1:39:40] amazed how how the word of god sometimes
[1:39:42] just comes in such a way
[1:39:45] in verse eight
[1:39:47] let's jump to verse eight brother mason
[1:39:50] well look back at seven it's good
[1:39:54] do you look on things after the outward
[1:39:55] appearance
[1:39:57] i've got a
[1:39:59] haircut
[1:40:01] i'm wearing my best to church
[1:40:04] my best is not my favorite
[1:40:06] my favorite looks like wranglers and a
[1:40:08] shirt
[1:40:14] just saying
[1:40:17] look on the outward appearance
[1:40:19] the scripture says inside the ravening
[1:40:21] wolves
[1:40:23] seeking to devour
[1:40:25] oh but they're not preachers paul oh
[1:40:27] yeah everyone's a minister
[1:40:30] everyone's got a message to share
[1:40:35] are we all right
[1:40:38] and man trust to himself see you've got
[1:40:41] to catch these key words saints you
[1:40:42] can't just go outside over this if any
[1:40:44] man trusts to himself that he is christ
[1:40:48] somebody all but curse you to your face
[1:40:51] and tell you i have the holy ghost
[1:40:54] come on they're trusting to themselves
[1:40:56] they're the one declared it but christ
[1:40:58] in them is not manifesting that that is
[1:41:00] the truth now are those blunt well we
[1:41:02] got to come to the day sooner or later
[1:41:04] saints that we are courageous enough to
[1:41:06] stand up and say that spirit is wrong
[1:41:09] we love the people
[1:41:11] prophet of god over and over again deals
[1:41:13] with this it's not about the people it's
[1:41:15] not flesh and blood saints but those
[1:41:17] spirits they will anoint anyone who will
[1:41:19] open the door for them
[1:41:23] and we've got such a culture around the
[1:41:25] message that we're afraid to do this
[1:41:27] because they're just another message
[1:41:28] person of another opinion
[1:41:30] well i would hope our opinion would
[1:41:32] match this opinion
[1:41:35] because if our opinion don't match this
[1:41:37] opinion we've got a false opinion
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:40] wait this is not opinion this is fact
[1:41:42] amen
[1:41:44] for though i should boast somewhat
[1:41:47] more of our authority
[1:41:48] which the lord has given us for
[1:41:50] edification
[1:41:52] now edification
[1:41:54] is
[1:41:56] to build
[1:41:58] to
[1:41:58] establish enlightened
[1:42:01] inform
[1:42:04] education
[1:42:05] moral or intellectual or religious
[1:42:10] so you see my brother and sister when
[1:42:11] the apostle paul is talking to them and
[1:42:13] says the lord hath given us for
[1:42:15] education
[1:42:17] and not
[1:42:18] for your destruction
[1:42:21] i've got a simple solution to this
[1:42:23] if you think the preacher is here to
[1:42:25] destroy you
[1:42:26] you probably ought to go to a different
[1:42:27] church because that man
[1:42:30] without your confidence in him will
[1:42:33] never do you one single bit of good
[1:42:38] in fact did you know by research
[1:42:42] oh dare i say this word in church
[1:42:46] psychology
[1:42:48] they've studied the behavior of people
[1:42:51] and people will attend you'll understand
[1:42:54] now how mega churches have come about
[1:42:58] people will attend a church
[1:43:01] because they like
[1:43:03] the pastor
[1:43:05] even after
[1:43:06] seasons of attendance
[1:43:09] have no clue
[1:43:11] what he is talking
[1:43:13] about
[1:43:15] that's how strong the cult of
[1:43:17] personality
[1:43:19] can be
[1:43:26] and the guy who shared that was a pastor
[1:43:28] of a mega church
[1:43:36] i don't know if he was hoping to stir
[1:43:38] people a little bit
[1:43:40] i'm not sure what it was about really
[1:43:43] but i
[1:43:44] was shared this little blip and they
[1:43:46] said is this not interesting
[1:43:49] and uh
[1:43:50] it is my brother and sister
[1:43:52] okay moment of truth is everyone ready
[1:43:54] for the moment of truth
[1:43:59] do we know what we're talking about
[1:44:04] young and old here kids
[1:44:06] come on
[1:44:08] do we know what they're talking about
[1:44:11] you see if we come to the place that we
[1:44:13] just attend church because that's what
[1:44:15] our family does
[1:44:17] and we don't know what's being talked
[1:44:18] about you might even in a small church
[1:44:22] like this be caught up in some kind of
[1:44:25] cult of personality or
[1:44:27] cult of something
[1:44:30] you see
[1:44:31] paul is declaring
[1:44:34] i boast somewhat more of our authority
[1:44:38] now this authority my brother and sister
[1:44:39] was given to paul personally he could
[1:44:41] stand there knowing this authority of
[1:44:43] the word in revelation of the word was
[1:44:45] given to him personally right
[1:44:47] he didn't read it in a book he didn't
[1:44:48] get some online course or seminar this
[1:44:51] was something god gave him but i want
[1:44:53] you to see because you catch the spirit
[1:44:55] of paul you have to know the spirit of
[1:44:57] paul to understand the words of paul and
[1:44:59] so as he is there i boast somewhat more
[1:45:02] of our authority it's not paul's
[1:45:05] authority it's the authority of the word
[1:45:09] and so it's christ in you the hope of
[1:45:11] glory right you understand that it's
[1:45:13] there that paul is speaking now of
[1:45:15] authority
[1:45:16] and he is there declaring i've been
[1:45:18] given i can boast of this authority
[1:45:21] because it is a powerful authority it it
[1:45:25] unleashes and it binds and it revelates
[1:45:28] and it does everything that's necessary
[1:45:30] for sons and daughters of god and it's
[1:45:32] there and we have it
[1:45:35] hallelujah
[1:45:38] which lord has given us
[1:45:40] to build
[1:45:41] us
[1:45:42] up
[1:45:44] the lord has given it to us
[1:45:48] to fulfill
[1:45:50] to educate
[1:45:52] we get an idea that brother branham was
[1:45:53] against education in the spiritual realm
[1:45:56] you're wrong
[1:45:57] because you realize my brother and
[1:45:58] sister even in the realm of revelation
[1:46:01] the word god chooses to lay the word out
[1:46:03] first
[1:46:05] are you with me
[1:46:07] he lays the word out first
[1:46:10] and then he comes
[1:46:11] and makes it real
[1:46:13] so someone's got to come with authority
[1:46:16] and lay the word out
[1:46:18] amen so here we see it it's being laid
[1:46:21] out
[1:46:22] and he has no but the apostle paul you
[1:46:24] just read it in all of his writings
[1:46:26] you know every bit of his writings you
[1:46:28] see this authority just oozes out of his
[1:46:31] preaching
[1:46:32] his teaching is it's just got authority
[1:46:34] he doesn't come and say i think or it
[1:46:36] could be or might be unless you disagree
[1:46:38] with me
[1:46:39] or unless the church founders fathers
[1:46:41] don't like it
[1:46:43] no sir
[1:46:44] somewhat more of our authority which the
[1:46:46] lord has given us for ed a vacation
[1:46:50] now what is edification i already read
[1:46:52] it to you
[1:46:53] to build
[1:46:55] to establish
[1:46:57] to inform
[1:47:00] enlighten
[1:47:02] educate
[1:47:06] isn't that what the preaching of the
[1:47:07] word
[1:47:08] covers every bitter that's right here
[1:47:09] before us
[1:47:11] you see saints we don't want to be an
[1:47:13] ignorant church
[1:47:20] had a friend went on to be a nurse
[1:47:24] they were always joking about some of
[1:47:25] the students
[1:47:27] in the class
[1:47:30] kind of interesting you know and that
[1:47:32] the way things work you see
[1:47:36] judge me don't judge me as
[1:47:38] the whole rally cry of the world don't
[1:47:40] judge me
[1:47:44] but they said you know there was this
[1:47:45] one young lady in their classes and when
[1:47:47] the instructor the start of the the
[1:47:49] preliminary stuff that was all book
[1:47:51] stuff everyone passed it they're on to
[1:47:53] the next stage
[1:47:54] the start of the next stage that
[1:47:56] instructor
[1:47:57] is like okay so what is this about your
[1:48:01] desire to be a nurse and he wanted each
[1:48:02] student to voice what their
[1:48:05] their desire
[1:48:06] you hear very eloquent stuff i mean
[1:48:08] people they don't know this can happen
[1:48:10] so this is what they start saying well i
[1:48:12] i just you know my mother was very sick
[1:48:14] when i was young and she finally found
[1:48:16] the right doctor and uh he did these
[1:48:18] other things totally different to these
[1:48:20] other doctors and and now my mother is
[1:48:22] healthy again and it sparked something
[1:48:24] inside of me i want to be a nurse and i
[1:48:26] want to help people
[1:48:30] they get to this one young lady says and
[1:48:32] what what reason do you want to be a
[1:48:34] nurse
[1:48:35] oh i don't know it pays good and i mean
[1:48:37] like all you got to do is like put a
[1:48:39] needle in people and shove some stuff in
[1:48:41] there and they're going to feel better
[1:48:43] and uh
[1:48:44] he was like um i think you should go
[1:48:46] right now
[1:48:47] and talk to the school counselor
[1:48:50] and maybe you want to become like an
[1:48:52] accountant
[1:48:56] why
[1:48:59] paul
[1:49:00] if he could stand here this morning i
[1:49:02] say with all my heart would tell you
[1:49:05] i would lay down my life
[1:49:07] for you amen
[1:49:10] this bride of christ is so beautiful to
[1:49:13] me so important to me i care so much and
[1:49:16] it isn't about the individual as it were
[1:49:19] but it is that this is what i was called
[1:49:22] to do
[1:49:24] now if there's one called to preach the
[1:49:25] gospel of saints there's got to be one
[1:49:27] called to living
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:31] i don't think we have any lack of
[1:49:33] preaching i don't think we have any lack
[1:49:35] of desire
[1:49:37] to see this bride of christ built up
[1:49:40] and people say well brother paul
[1:49:43] you don't really preach on those deep
[1:49:44] things no saints i'm sorry i'm just
[1:49:46] pretty pretty shallow
[1:49:48] you know
[1:49:49] i mean i'm a farmer i've spent my whole
[1:49:51] life farming soil
[1:49:53] but we only farm it
[1:49:55] like this deep
[1:49:57] the roots
[1:49:59] have to do the going down here
[1:50:02] the farmer can't make the roots go down
[1:50:04] there
[1:50:05] but i can prepare the soil so the roots
[1:50:08] have every
[1:50:10] uh option or availability to start
[1:50:14] growing and keep right on growing and go
[1:50:16] deeper and draw more nutrients and more
[1:50:19] nutrients did you follow me saints
[1:50:22] amen you see it's coming a time that
[1:50:24] we're no longer a message babysitter as
[1:50:26] it were we are message sons and
[1:50:28] daughters i'm preaching to myself here
[1:50:30] don't think i'm speaking out to you amen
[1:50:32] i'm preaching to myself it's now time
[1:50:34] because this lamb's wife
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:47] she got encouraged just you mean i can
[1:50:49] that little thing brother paul that's
[1:50:51] been bothering me for years
[1:50:54] you mean i can tear that down
[1:50:57] and take vengeance on the devil
[1:51:00] for afflicting that on me it's what the
[1:51:02] word says
[1:51:04] okay now you've got to take it home
[1:51:08] i know saints we're closing
[1:51:11] right after
[1:51:12] two more quotes and three more
[1:51:14] scriptures
[1:51:18] brother adam and i just had this
[1:51:19] conversation he's like don't say that
[1:51:20] brother paul
[1:51:24] james
[1:51:26] how many of you would enjoy
[1:51:29] the preacher coming out
[1:51:31] grabbing your hide
[1:51:33] and say you know
[1:51:35] at the break at work the other day that
[1:51:36] exaggeration
[1:51:38] that's the same as a lie
[1:51:42] you'd say how do you know
[1:51:46] i got an informer in your office
[1:51:49] you'd feel betrayed you wouldn't feel
[1:51:50] encouraged
[1:51:52] but how about that your life is private
[1:51:54] enough and the preacher don't know
[1:51:55] enough about you
[1:51:57] that the holy spirit comes down
[1:52:00] starts dealing with you and your spirit
[1:52:03] goes oh my oh my oh my
[1:52:07] now i have a choice to make
[1:52:10] oh i hope you understand me
[1:52:13] that something rises up in you it seems
[1:52:16] almost like it's of the flesh
[1:52:19] and you realize
[1:52:20] i can take revenge on the devil
[1:52:23] by repenting of this
[1:52:25] and getting it right and i get to go out
[1:52:28] and trash the devil
[1:52:31] well not the way you're thinking
[1:52:33] but how you'll
[1:52:35] trash him is every day just keep walking
[1:52:37] in the word
[1:52:39] and that's a body blow to the devil
[1:52:40] every day you're walking in the word and
[1:52:42] the devil's out there gets up in the
[1:52:44] morning and goes oh my goodness he's
[1:52:45] going to do it again
[1:52:47] he's going to live today and if he does
[1:52:49] make a mistake because the prophet to
[1:52:51] the age said you will make a mistake and
[1:52:54] i can just see it now he's going to
[1:52:55] repent
[1:52:57] oh my oh
[1:52:59] i put so much time in him don't you
[1:53:02] understand how much time i invested in
[1:53:06] deceiving you
[1:53:10] oh
[1:53:13] hallelujah
[1:53:14] i think i got my point across
[1:53:17] edification saints
[1:53:19] oh my jesus christ the word edifies up
[1:53:22] builds us up establishes up and then and
[1:53:25] only then can we edify christ to the
[1:53:27] world amen
[1:53:29] i've got so many things here that go
[1:53:31] across my mind my brother and sister
[1:53:33] satan eden amen the thing of it is today
[1:53:36] we don't try to establish the word of
[1:53:38] god in the people's hearts we're trying
[1:53:40] to establish ourselves
[1:53:42] churches are trying to establish the
[1:53:44] doctrine of the church in a person's
[1:53:46] heart
[1:53:47] we are commanded to establish the word
[1:53:49] of god
[1:53:51] paul said i didn't come to you with
[1:53:52] enticing words of man that your faith
[1:53:55] might rest upon the knowledge of man but
[1:53:57] i come to you in power
[1:54:00] hallelujah i want to see power
[1:54:01] manifested things i want to step into
[1:54:04] the position that when i wait you know i
[1:54:07] might be a poor example some of you say
[1:54:08] well he's a pastor he ought to be in
[1:54:10] that position how about you mothers you
[1:54:12] got a little one and she's sick or he's
[1:54:15] sick or something's happened and you are
[1:54:17] there going oh my 911. well if it's
[1:54:21] necessary you do it but what about the
[1:54:23] power of prayer that comes to you and
[1:54:25] says lord this is your child you gave me
[1:54:27] the child i gave the child back to you
[1:54:30] now lord it's up to you what you do with
[1:54:32] this child
[1:54:34] we've heard too many stories my brother
[1:54:35] and sister
[1:54:37] of prayer being answered right on the
[1:54:39] spot that's called a miracle
[1:54:42] but i come to you in power and
[1:54:44] manifestations of the holy ghost
[1:54:47] can i insert this don't always look
[1:54:52] for a physical realm to the answering of
[1:54:54] prayer
[1:54:57] well i prayed
[1:54:58] god gave me a raise at work
[1:55:00] i prayed and this and i prayed in that
[1:55:04] how often do we pray
[1:55:06] as the prophet taught us
[1:55:09] lord i need revelation
[1:55:12] lord i need revelation saints if you're
[1:55:13] not praying that way i beg you i implore
[1:55:16] you i beseech you
[1:55:18] start praying that way
[1:55:20] because these things have a better job a
[1:55:22] better house a better car you know blah
[1:55:24] blah that's all well and good amen
[1:55:25] that's right in the word that's god's
[1:55:27] promise to you but my brother and sister
[1:55:29] all of that is going to go away what we
[1:55:32] need is revelation amen and when
[1:55:34] revelation comes we will have the
[1:55:37] authority of the word that unlocks the
[1:55:40] power of the word that casts out demons
[1:55:42] and lifts up men and women sons and
[1:55:44] daughters of god
[1:55:46] hallelujah
[1:55:48] paul says i didn't come with enticing
[1:55:49] words those are the ones
[1:55:51] that just make you feel so good you know
[1:55:53] where we believe the message
[1:55:56] come on saints you say brother paul
[1:55:58] you're hammering on these things it
[1:55:59] seems like you have for a long time the
[1:56:00] reason is because i keep rubbing
[1:56:02] shoulders and interacting have
[1:56:03] conversations people that believe just
[1:56:05] acknowledging brother branham was a
[1:56:07] prophet is going to get him to heaven
[1:56:09] if that's the case the devil's there
[1:56:14] amen that's not going to do it saints
[1:56:16] amen
[1:56:18] hallelujah
[1:56:20] let's unwind
[1:56:21] 38 years
[1:56:25] i know it's happened before i've met
[1:56:27] girls that said yes to this but 38 years
[1:56:30] ago i met this really cute girl
[1:56:32] well actually i met her more i remember
[1:56:34] more like 42 years ago
[1:56:38] knocked it stupid
[1:56:41] hey hey
[1:56:44] notice me
[1:56:48] don't laugh brothers
[1:56:57] and i've heard brothers tell me i just
[1:56:58] walked up to my wife at some special
[1:57:00] meetings in ohio and looked her in the
[1:57:02] face and said you're going to marry me
[1:57:05] and that's when i finally said maybe we
[1:57:07] should apply luck once in a while
[1:57:13] usually don't go well does it
[1:57:16] but i tell you what there's a perfect
[1:57:18] tried and true brothers this is a
[1:57:19] romance class
[1:57:22] you start saving a seat for them
[1:57:24] you open the door for them
[1:57:27] when you notice they didn't reject you
[1:57:29] you might go ahead and move to bringing
[1:57:30] them a flower
[1:57:33] and if they still don't say no bring
[1:57:34] them to
[1:57:37] what do you do brothers come on young
[1:57:39] men
[1:57:40] well maybe even some of you married
[1:57:41] people that are struggling with this
[1:57:42] stuff
[1:57:43] sister jerry's going to say you're just
[1:57:45] preaching you liar
[1:57:53] what we got to do though see this part i
[1:57:55] know it's true you've got to work your
[1:57:56] way into their heart
[1:57:59] not surface
[1:58:04] otherwise when the hair starts falling
[1:58:07] out and the body gains a few pounds
[1:58:10] we'll start losing the appeal
[1:58:13] so you've got to get down in the heart
[1:58:16] and when you get down in the heart
[1:58:18] and you get a hoax of the heart
[1:58:21] they'll follow you around the world
[1:58:25] they'll sleep in bed bug infested beds
[1:58:29] they'll be eaten by fleas
[1:58:31] they will be hot they will be cold
[1:58:34] they will be whatever
[1:58:36] oh i hope you understand
[1:58:38] whatever i need her
[1:58:41] to be
[1:58:43] my seamstress
[1:58:44] my cook
[1:58:46] my laundry
[1:58:50] but without the heart that's it it only
[1:58:53] goes for a season
[1:58:56] and then it starts to become weary
[1:58:58] and it starts to struggle
[1:59:00] and it starts to become resentful
[1:59:03] oh jerry and i work on this all the time
[1:59:07] we have our own little thing i shouldn't
[1:59:09] even reveal this secret
[1:59:11] we have our own little thing
[1:59:13] we'll be sitting there
[1:59:15] and i don't know what event will take
[1:59:16] place and i'd say my
[1:59:18] think what it'd be like if you only
[1:59:20] loved me
[1:59:24] and her reply is
[1:59:26] i wouldn't be here
[1:59:28] if i didn't love you
[1:59:32] now you think i'm telling a cute little
[1:59:34] story about marriage
[1:59:36] my brother and sister some of us
[1:59:38] have done things
[1:59:41] that if the lord
[1:59:43] wasn't in the heart realm
[1:59:46] we would be out in the cold
[1:59:49] we would be lost
[1:59:51] but you see as hard as it is for us to
[1:59:53] comprehend
[1:59:55] we have
[1:59:57] the heart
[1:59:59] of jesus christ
[2:00:02] and he has
[2:00:04] our heart
[2:00:05] yes
[2:00:06] isn't this beautiful
[2:00:08] oh we're trying still my brothers and
[2:00:10] sisters like we're a bunch of jews under
[2:00:13] the old commandments trying to fulfill
[2:00:15] the law so god will be happy why don't
[2:00:18] we work on

[2:00:23] him because i love him
[2:00:25] now i tell you what i met some girls
[2:00:27] that were so story-eyed when they first
[2:00:29] got married

[2:01:30] him out and you'll find every man trying
[2:01:31] to impersonate it
[2:01:34] but you see what they can't do is they
[2:01:37] can't have real love
[2:01:39] and i'm not
[2:01:40] talking about feeling i'm talking about
[2:01:42] love for the word
[2:01:43] a love for christ himself they can
[2:01:46] impersonate this for a season
[2:01:48] but they can't keep on doing the laundry
[2:01:52] are you with me i used a silly way to
[2:01:54] come about this but they can't keep
[2:01:56] doing the laundry because they don't

[2:02:09] denomination me this establishing
[2:02:11] themself what are we preaching about
[2:02:14] ourselves or the kingdom of god

[2:02:50] teenagers well we don't have to worry
[2:02:52] about them running off out here in the
[2:02:53] world amen we don't have to worry about
[2:02:56] them fleeing from church if we can get
[2:02:58] the word of god established in them
[2:03:01] but if we just have a program we go to
[2:03:03] church we go to church that's all you'll
[2:03:05] have
[2:03:06] take out the unbelief and establish the
[2:03:08] kingdom of god in a man's heart and the
[2:03:10] kingdom of god cannot be established in
[2:03:13] man's heart unless god made that man
[2:03:16] thus
[2:03:17] he cannot be established and remember
[2:03:19] the deceitful part what man think it's
[2:03:21] right see there's a way that seemeth
[2:03:22] right until man every intellectual being
[2:03:26] seems right

[2:04:12] you promised that you would bless your
[2:04:14] word
[2:04:15] wherever it was spoken amen
[2:04:18] and you said it would not return to your
[2:04:20] void but would accomplish that which it
[2:04:23] was purposeful
[2:04:24] and father
[2:04:26] thou who sent the word
[2:04:28] now
[2:04:29] may the holy spirit take the word now
[2:04:31] and go right straight into the hearts of
[2:04:33] the people
[2:04:35] and establish
[2:04:36] amen
[2:04:38] the preaching of the word
[2:04:41] building up
[2:04:43] an unmovable faith
[2:04:46] the preaching of the word stirring the
[2:04:48] hearts of the bride of this last day
[2:04:51] that regardless of what satan can bluff
[2:04:54] they're going to stand there and say you
[2:04:55] know what i don't know exactly how it
[2:04:58] happened wait maybe it happened from
[2:05:00] endless hours of reading my bible and
[2:05:03] praying and endless hours of sitting in
[2:05:05] church and hearing the ministry preach
[2:05:08] the word of god for the hour to me but i
[2:05:10] know this that here in my time of
[2:05:13] trouble in this labor to see an age as
[2:05:16] the darkness is settling in i have an
[2:05:19] unmovable faith
[2:05:21] and i can't tell you the exact day it
[2:05:23] showed up i can't give credit to any man
[2:05:26] on earth but it was the word
[2:05:29] it was a word preached to me
[2:05:31] unadulterated and god come with his word
[2:05:37] and now my faith
[2:05:39] is unshakable it's unmovable
[2:05:41] and i know that this promise of the word
[2:05:44] was for me
[2:05:45] and it will do all that it was said to
[2:05:48] do
[2:05:49] because god is not obligated in the
[2:05:51] sense we think obligation but god said i
[2:05:55] will be there
[2:05:56] or two or three
[2:05:58] or gathered
[2:06:00] well he's on front row he's on second
[2:06:03] row well unfortunately there's no one on
[2:06:05] the third row he's on the fourth he's on
[2:06:07] the fifth on the sixth on the seventh
[2:06:10] come on saints god honors his word amen

[2:06:20] take the word now go straight into the
[2:06:22] hearts of the people and establish an
[2:06:23] unmovable faith lord that'll heal the
[2:06:25] sick
[2:06:26] and be afflicted save the lost given
[2:06:28] experience
[2:06:33] now let me explain to you the vials
[2:06:35] let's go into the thunders
[2:06:37] and we got a 12 year old over here 13 14
[2:06:40] 15 year old over here
[2:06:47] well they got the word preached to them
[2:06:51] what about experience
[2:06:55] they heard the word that conditions the
[2:06:57] soil
[2:06:59] but we've got to water that seed amen
[2:07:03] experience through those that are
[2:07:04] without it hide us now in behind christ
[2:07:07] lord and let us all of our speaking and
[2:07:09] preaching and testifying whatever may
[2:07:11] take place may it all be through christ
[2:07:14] for we ask it
[2:07:16] in his name
[2:07:18] you see saints we've got to come to a
[2:07:20] place
[2:07:21] that we actually
[2:07:23] don't just allow
[2:07:25] god
[2:07:26] sister amy if you'd come
[2:07:29] saints we're going to come in place we
[2:07:30] don't just allow god to move in our life
[2:07:33] we got to come to a place that we are
[2:07:35] out there saying lord
[2:07:39] wash me lord cleanse me lord fill me
[2:07:42] lord walk with me lord i need knowledge
[2:07:47] lord i need experience
[2:07:50] i need a cleansing
[2:07:54] you see my brother and sister it's not
[2:07:55] just enough to say well i believe i
[2:07:57] believe
[2:07:58] but god's looking for someone that will
[2:08:00] come and act upon that word
[2:08:03] in psalms 69
[2:08:06] [Music]
[2:08:08] it's almost david says but as for me
[2:08:11] my prayer is unto thee oh lord
[2:08:14] in an acceptable time
[2:08:16] do you know we can be out of time
[2:08:17] sometimes saying
[2:08:20] an acceptable time of god
[2:08:22] in the multitude of thy mercy hear me
[2:08:26] in the truth of thy salvation
[2:08:29] deliver me out of the mire and let me
[2:08:31] not sink
[2:08:33] let me be delivered from them that hate
[2:08:35] me and out of the deep waters
[2:08:38] let not the water flood overflow me
[2:08:40] neither let the deep swallow me up and
[2:08:42] let not the pit shut her mouth upon me
[2:08:46] hear me o lord
[2:08:48] for thy loving kindness is good
[2:08:50] turn unto me according to the multitude
[2:08:53] of that tender mercies
[2:08:55] and hide not thy face from that servant
[2:08:58] for i am in trouble
[2:09:05] hear me
[2:09:06] speedily
[2:09:08] draw nigh into my soul and redeem it
[2:09:12] and deliver me because of my enemies
[2:09:18] [Music]
[2:09:22] the word says
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:28] it's in the book of james the fourth
[2:09:30] draw an chapter
[2:09:31] to god
[2:09:33] and he will draw night to you
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:42] you know what it takes to draw an eye to
[2:09:43] him saints
[2:09:48] it takes an open heart
[2:09:51] takes a clear conscience
[2:09:53] it takes a desire
[2:09:56] can i say that again it takes a desire
[2:09:59] to be in the presence of god
[2:10:02] not just
[2:10:03] an appearance
[2:10:04] going back in the scriptures don't look
[2:10:06] on the outward man
[2:10:07] [Music]
[2:10:10] i just want to encourage you this
[2:10:11] morning you might say brother paul's
[2:10:12] going to sound like you're going to make
[2:10:13] an altar call well i don't really do
[2:10:15] altar calls but i'm going to tell you
[2:10:17] you do whatever you want to do
[2:10:19] but i tell you saints it's time for some
[2:10:21] of us
[2:10:23] no let me be fair it's time for all of
[2:10:25] us
[2:10:26] to draw nine
[2:10:27] closer
[2:10:28] to the lord it's time that some of us
[2:10:31] need to just come and say well you know
[2:10:32] i've been to an altar in years i want to
[2:10:34] ask you why well the prophet of god said
[2:10:36] the altar is in your heart
[2:10:38] but the prophet god also made altar
[2:10:40] calls
[2:10:42] i think it's time for some of us to
[2:10:44] actually break through our old crusty
[2:10:46] self
[2:10:48] and stand up and say you know what i i
[2:10:49] need to drawn closer to the lord i need
[2:10:52] to draw nigh to the lord now how am i
[2:10:54] going to do that we've got so dry
[2:10:56] brother abraham says like he's off an
[2:10:57] old counter
[2:10:59] how high
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:03] why
[2:11:05] because satan knows
[2:11:07] if he can keep you from being built up
[2:11:11] he's got nothing
[2:11:13] to worry about
[2:11:16] what are we constructing saints a good
[2:11:18] life here
[2:11:19] [Music]
[2:11:23] just read this morning where the prophet
[2:11:24] of god said all these blessings we have
[2:11:26] on this earth
[2:11:27] someday
[2:11:29] soon
[2:11:30] we'll be gone
[2:11:32] he didn't make that to make us get all
[2:11:34] nervous he just trying to get us to
[2:11:36] focus
[2:11:37] why because just like the apostle paul
[2:11:39] he looked at you
[2:11:41] and said man i have great authority of
[2:11:43] the purpose that i have for being here
[2:11:46] and that is to shake a bride
[2:11:48] get her attention
[2:11:50] that she would draw close
[2:11:52] draw really close
[2:11:54] i just ask you saints maybe you want to
[2:11:56] bow your heads whatever you want to do
[2:11:59] i just ask him tell you
[2:12:03] employ you beseech you whatever word you
[2:12:06] want to use
[2:12:09] [Music]
[2:12:10] if you feel in your heart maybe just
[2:12:12] lift a hand
[2:12:14] say lord i just
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:16] i want to drive draw closer lord to you
[2:12:18] than
[2:12:20] than i was
[2:12:22] yesterday the day before even this
[2:12:24] morning lord
[2:12:26] lord i say it and sincerely lord not

[2:12:40] look at the times
[2:12:41] [Music]
[2:12:42] lord
[2:12:44] i don't know if anyone would feel to
[2:12:46] stand up and just maybe make an outward
[2:12:49] sign
[2:12:50] step to the front and say i just want
[2:12:52] the world to know i want a closer walk
[2:12:54] with you lord
[2:12:55] but i tell you lord wherever they might
[2:12:57] be i ask you this morning just to touch
[2:13:00] the hearts
[2:13:01] of your children for
[2:13:03] stir it father that it would be such
[2:13:06] that it wouldn't be just an actual
[2:13:08] outward motion that would go away a
[2:13:11] passing emotion
[2:13:13] but lord let it be the cry of the heart
[2:13:16] lord that we want to be closer to you
[2:13:18] lord
[2:13:19] we're drawing nigh to you lord now we're
[2:13:21] reaching out and we're crying out lord
[2:13:23] jesus come down and lord move in our
[2:13:26] midst
[2:13:27] as individuals lord as families as a a
[2:13:30] church a group of believers together
[2:13:33] lord that we would just collectively
[2:13:35] just reach out to you this morning and
[2:13:37] ask you come move in our midst
[2:13:39] come speak to our hearts lord
[2:13:42] father sometimes we get so caught up in
[2:13:44] the world we can't hardly find a time to
[2:13:47] fellowship around the things of god
[2:13:49] because we're so busy talking of the
[2:13:51] things of the world
[2:13:53] god forgive us
[2:13:55] let our thoughts let our prayers let our
[2:13:57] voice be upon you

[2:14:02] lord i happen to be standing right here
[2:14:04] in front of the saints lord i just lift
[2:14:06] my hand and i say lord
[2:14:08] i'm not satisfied with where i was
[2:14:10] yesterday
[2:14:11] i'm not satisfied lord where i was at
[2:14:14] last year father
[2:14:16] and i'm not satisfied to start a year
[2:14:18] coming with some kind of resolution
[2:14:21] but lord even before the new year would
[2:14:22] come father i'm asking you come down in
[2:14:25] our midst
[2:14:26] come down in my heart come down in my
[2:14:28] soul come down in my life in my
[2:14:30] household
[2:14:31] and move me father
[2:14:33] lord the word has declared that it would
[2:14:36] come as a thief in the night
[2:14:39] oh lord give us ears to hear and eyes to
[2:14:42] see
[2:14:43] oh lord let us not i just thinking of
[2:14:45] something that was preached years ago
[2:14:47] lord a distracted generation and if it
[2:14:50] was relevant lord when that was preached
[2:14:52] it is more relevant today
[2:14:54] and i would ask you father just to stir
[2:14:56] the hearts
[2:14:58] through the hearts of your children
[2:14:59] father
[2:15:00] lord let us not be asleep at the watch
[2:15:03] let us not be complacent at the wheel
[2:15:05] but father let something start burning
[2:15:07] in our hearts may the fathers of this
[2:15:09] assembly be the priests of their home
[2:15:12] leading their wives and their children
[2:15:14] in true anointed worship
[2:15:17] father not to become lazy just believing
[2:15:20] that if god sent a prophet and we
[2:15:22] believe that it will be sufficient but
[2:15:24] the word says there's a life
[2:15:28] there's a life
[2:15:29] lord i want that life
[2:15:32] now father those that man their heart
[2:15:35] lord they raise their heart to you those
[2:15:37] are standing those lifting their hands
[2:15:39] whatever it might be father it's not for
[2:15:41] me to dictate
[2:15:43] but lord may they just take a holds of
[2:15:45] this and these things that we spoke this
[2:15:47] morning lord to remember even to their
[2:15:50] own self father
[2:15:52] that this is not a carnal warfare
[2:15:56] this is a spiritual warfare
[2:15:59] help us lord to be more spiritual
[2:16:02] father just reading and hearing the
[2:16:05] prophets say oh i feel religious right
[2:16:08] now
[2:16:09] people would misunderstand lord
[2:16:13] but may they experience
[2:16:15] that same presence that he experienced
[2:16:18] and may their heart
[2:16:20] lord rejoice in you today
[2:16:23] father i have one last request
[2:16:26] [Music]

[2:16:33] assembly

[2:16:40] out every sin
[2:16:43] that is in this
