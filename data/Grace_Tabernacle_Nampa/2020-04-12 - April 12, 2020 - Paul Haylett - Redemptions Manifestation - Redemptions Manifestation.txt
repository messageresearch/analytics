just a real jubilee today here if we were together so let's just be together in one spirit joining together in the presence of the Lord and let's have a jubilee amen so brother Jason's already welcomed brother Chris sister Kristen to the church ayah I almost this morning felt to call brother Chris and tell him to put on his suit and tie and to come down here and greet the people but I have a feeling they probably are pretty tired we appreciate our brother Ivan here this morning you know his Brotherhood his friendship his loved brother Chris yeah whether Ivan got in a truck and trailer and drove all the way to Arizona helped brother Chris sister Kristen load up their stuff drove all the way back and he's here this morning also so we really appreciate that and so we just thank the Lord for first traveling mercies amen our brother Sergei we appreciate him coming in this morning just to help cover to make sure everything was working well we appreciate that kind of dedication we also want to just bring greetings to you from our brother jewel Forney had a lovely conversation with him yesterday lengthy conversation just dealing you know a little bit of business you might say and just discussing things and we're just looking for the day when all of this changes brother jewel come visit us we also have just a lovely testimony of what God has done for our brother jewel has lowered his blood pressure all of these factors that were influencing him so detrimental II the Lord has just come on this scene and brother jewel was just sharing with me that he has not felt this good in in years and so he's is just helping with a group of believers they're in North Carolina just to help move them towards the rapture so I bring greetings to you from brother jewel sister Vanessa amen let's just stand as will turn this morning to the Word of God want to thank our musicians the special song you will find that what I preached this morning will be very similar I was a per sheet if of the song that sister Jerry's sister Jolin and sister Aaliyah sang for us because we're going to talk this morning on who was worthy amen so I want to just title this today redemptions manifestation and so we just laying a little foundation before we go into the reading of the word that if there is my brother and sister a redemption having taken place there will be an evidence of that redemption amen we cannot remain the same and say that we have received redemption we cannot just be the old man the carnal man unchanging through the years but when Christ has come we are the scripture says a new creation and I say thank you for that Lord by your grace and mercy so let's just turn in first Corinthians starting with the first chapter of the eighteenth verse quite a lengthy reading of Scripture so we'll read a portion of it and allow you to be seated amen first Corinthians one and 18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God can we say men to that it is the power of God to us for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world now I would want to just interject real quick when you look at the the words of wisdom that are coming from all the great political leaders around the world to me it drives home this scripture that God hath made foolish the wisdom of this world and you'll see my brother and sister as time goes on that they will become a paradox and a conflict or contradictory to their very own thinking their own words because while they believe they have wisdom we know that wisdom true wisdom only comes from God for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign in the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling-block and unto the Greeks foolishness Heavenly Father we just ask you this morning Lord to come Lord be with the Saints wherever they may be this morning and their home Lord abroad on the road wherever it might be we ask you Father to deal with the hearts of your children her father your word is here it is present it is powerful and we want to receive it with open arms and open heart this morning Lord to let the word work in us we thank you for the opportunity for the privilege to be a part of this great plan of God and we ask for your blessings now in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated but we preach Christ crucified my brother and sister what a beautiful thing that we look into to realize that as we preach Christ crucified we're not speaking of one that is dead we're speaking of one that is alive and as it's been shared this morning with me from another pastor another friend of mine you know my brother and sister the church may be empty but so is the tomb so we have nothing to be ashamed of today that the circumstances of this life might have hindered us from coming together to to worship together on this Resurrection Day but what we do glorify my brother and sister and lift up is the redemptive power of our Lord Jesus Christ it doesn't mean we have to be all in the same room for that power to be unleashed we can be setting as it would be in spirit on one mind and one Accord and God coming down wherever we might be in our home or on the road or wherever and God will deal with us and in each one hearing of the word will have an effect that is necessary for our life and I thank God for that but we preach Christ crucified under the Jews a stumbling-block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called now see how God I just love this you know through the years I've probably been a little redundant about this but you see God puts his quantifiers on the word and and but unto them which are called my brother and sister so when the call is made and we respond to that this puts the scripture in a whole different context to us and so but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wise than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men I say thank you Lord because no matter what man would come up with God is greater and I say thank you Lord now look for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called and I want to just take a moment just for us to stop and think about it and look around us and realize my brother and sister look around you look at yourself and we see the evidence manifested of this very verse right here that you see God doesn't call very many that are great great men he calls the highway and by way the common man the man that that needs a savior and well every man needs a savior but those that there are something there exist and he calls them and you look we see the evidence manifested and God doesn't raise up too many kings and potentates and presidents and great intellectual men God come after the common man who could have faith in believe and so as we look around we will see the evidence manifested and the definition of the word manifested is to be displayed to show exhibit to be demonstrated and the pluralities of those words displayed and and shown it applies to all of those so we see as we look around we see the evidence of what is God is manifesting around us and we see how that God would choose a people and then choose to bless those people choose a common people and choose to bless those people I say thank you Lord amen because certainly today we have nothing to boast about in our intelligence and yet we would find many great people profound people called of God but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty you know my brother and sister we I've heard several brothers through the years kind of preach along this line but when you look at how simple it is when God made a blade of grass now man can reproduce grass he can take and and hybrid that may be one kind of grass with another he can transplant it he can do a lot of things but he cannot create the blade of grass and so you know I just remember my brother on Peterson speaking on the topic of being drawn to a higher kingdom my brother and sister what would be nutrients as it were in the soil of this earth water and minerals and all of the things that make up the earth you draw out of that and something grows and here we have of the common things of life a common people you would say and God has drawn out of the things of this earth and drawn up through them people that are vessels worthy to give praise and glory and honor to our Lord Jesus Christ I say Lord draw us into a higher Kingdom amen so as you look at this you see how that God is working and he said the base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay the things which are not to bring to nought the things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence have you ever noticed my brother and sister every time man starts to glory in his position in God if people will lift up a pastor or a minister evangelist something and they lift him up put him on a pedestal God has a way of bringing that down and and reminding us that we cannot glory in ourselves but we glory in his presence every ability every talent that we have everything we've ever done for the Lord was the Lord using us or giving us the privilege to be a part of what he was doing amen so it's there that but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord we want to just bring God's blessings upon the word today we thank you lord amen now my brother and sister around the world today there'll be many many churches many ministry whether it be online or if they have the opportunity to meet in person my brother and sister there'll be many preaching or speaking today of the death burial and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and that is a beautiful subject I don't believe we should ever allow ourselves to become tired of speaking on that subject to realize what God has done for us by decision amen just as it is God did not I always you know mix up the word and kind of throw it out there that our Lord Jesus blood was spilled but it was not spilt as the prophet of God says it was poured out denoting an intentional act that God did for you and I and I say it's beautiful when we think about Calvary we think about the sacrifice that was made how that is so beautiful because it was intentional and as the scripture says he first loved us amen so it's there as we go back just a little bit and just touch upon the chain of events and you know every one of these events that come up to the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus was a fulfillment of prophecy these were not just happenstance these were not just something that come to pass in a certain way just by chance but we'll see that each one of these was to fulfill prophecy my brother and sister they knew that Barabbas was worthy to be crucified but they were anointed and we have to recognize that while they knew the man was worthy he was a murderer he was a robber he was he was just a a vile man but they were anointed and they so hated the word that come and exposed their position and under that anointing that they cry out that our Lord Jesus would be crucified my brother and sister every portion of that coming down fulfilling prophecy to bring it to pass exactly according to the Word of God and I say thank you Lord because the word is prophesied in this last day there would be a people that would only be able they would not even be able to embrace Satan's plan but they would only be able to say Amen to the Word of God for this day and they would stand solid upon the word because as the song was sang this morning where there is a deep calling there is a deep to respond and my brother and sister if the deep is out there and there's no calling then there's something missing in that individual and it don't matter how available the deep is the Word of God the presence of God the Holy Ghost no matter how available that is if there's nothing crying out for that then there will be no moving or no shifting in that person's position and so as we look at this we realize that by prophecy when our eyes are opened isn't it interesting as sons and daughters of God when the word is open your Bible is opened to you the message of our hour enlightens the the the world around you you know my brother and sister I'm not speaking to the make believer that might go for a season and change his mind and turn back I'm talking to the real believer that isn't it amazing that when the light comes and illuminates something to you you can never walk away from that you can never unsee it so as the word is being open to the bride in this day we cannot go back and unsee it my brother and sister we will not apologize for what we have saw in this scripture we will not apologize for those things that the prophet of God said were hidden as it were not his exact words but hidden in plain sight my brother and sister why was it on that time in that season that the Messiah walked right in the midst of Israel and they could not see him the word says that their eyes were blinded and we were living in a day my brother and sister where many people are blinded to the day that we are living and what God is doing so these chain of events that led to Jesus crucifixion his death burial and resurrection they were prophecy and no less today my brother and sister is the chain of events that are taking place right now any less than prophecy being fulfilled the word has declared that the season would come that it was just like Sodom well my brother and sister I said years ago look at this oh the time must be nice it's like Sodom and yet we're many many times worse now than it was then and maybe we're still not there yet my brother and sister but you look at this whatever the word has prophesied we can look at that and we don't need to worry about it people get all excited oh my goodness they're gonna make us carry some kind of ID card this is the mark of the beast it's got to be oh they're making this they're gonna take the money away and give us some kind of electronic currency they're gonna oh they're gonna my brother and sister don't fret about it amen because these are just the fulfillment of prophecy coming to pass that this will lead right up to the end time but the word tells us when you see these things drawing nigh look up your redemption is drawing nigh don't be looking down here at the circumstance of Laodicea but look up because our redemption is drawing nigh to us hallelujah don't become distracted in the day that we're living amen now you see everything happening fulfill prophecy John 19 and 30 my brother and sister what an interesting scripture as we look at this and so we come he said when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished he didn't explain himself he didn't say now this ties to this and this tossed it is because you see for those that were ordained to see it saw it those that were not ordained to see it you could not have explained it to them you could not have diagrammed it broke it down put it on the whiteboard you could not have given enough scripture enough quotations for them to see it so to those that it is given to see they see it and so as he says here when Jesus there received the vinegar he said it is finished he bowed his head and gave up the ghost now my brother and sister you look at this this right here is not the start and this is not the finish so please don't misunderstand today but this was a stage of the word being revealed or fulfilled this was a stage and as Jesus is there and says it is finished he is telling us now that the full manifestation of the plan of redemption is now on display Amen you say well it wasn't my brother and sister until he was a resurrected that it really no my brother and sister the sacrifice of the Lamb is what said it all in motion for mankind and so there as we had the Old Testament type of man coming he had to offer up something with blood and it was there that he's offered the lamb he's offered the lamb he's offered the lamb but the lamb never dealt with this sin issue the blood was merely a covering but God said once and for all I'm going to deal with the sin issue and in that I will come and I will become the personal sacrifice for my people and so it's there as a plan of redemption is now on display he paid the price and I'm thankful I think we would all say you thank you Lord that you chose to pay a price for us amen the lamb my brother and sister we know by the word of God the lamb slain before the foundation of the world was now put on display in front of you and I figuratively in front of the world the lamb this scripture says he was slain before the foundation of the world my brother and sister now God put that on public display so as we all see that just as it is people say well praise the Lord I got saved now my name's on the book of life and I'm gonna go on no I'm sorry my brother and sister this was all settled God set this in motion before the foundation of the world so we didn't seek out God God and the word would come my brother and sister that deep calling Amen that was within us was placed there by Almighty God determined a pre determinate results and people say well how is that well I'll tell you how its predetermined because God being omniscient omnipresent looked down through time and said there's one with a seed right there I'll write his name God is not going to drag you to the altar God is not going to force you to do this but he knows how to come in such a way that the very thing that is deep within you oh I thank the Lord for that because if our path was headed off in the wrong direction it was going to take more especially you know in the nature of cynical people they they want to question everything they want an answer they got to see why but my brother and sister when you can take a cynic and they're headed down their path of life and that deep call in them starts to turn them around I say thank you Lord there you have the power to turn us around amen and we don't even have to be out here in sin we can be faithful in the house of God and something just creep into our life a little bit and we start to go a certain way a certain little spirit certain little attitude something start us in a way and God has an ability because he placed that in us it's there it's alive it's real and he turns us around that's why he can make that assurance and he'll never lose a one you see Satan can't trick yes my brother and sister Satan can't bring it around in any such a fashion to cause it to not work because Satan already defeated knows he is subject to the word oh thank you amen I'm glad that lamb is on display in front of us today now brother Branham says right here in the breach amen it's a lovely lovely quote and I trust this morning you'll be able to catch what stirred my heart and Johnny in this spirit see John wasn't standing there as a carnal man John in the spirit standing up here in heaven he'd just been lifted up now from the church agency he saw the church ages and he was taken up in the fourth chapter said come up higher I'm going to show you things that will come and he saw one sitting upon the throne with this book in his hand in his right hand think of it now and then in this book was a title deed to redemption and it was sealed with seven seals oh my brother and sister this stirs my heart I just hope you can see I rejoice I couldn't sleep this morning I got up a little after four went and set in my office and just rejoiced amen so here's this book there's a title deed but it was sealed with seven seals and then an angel come forth this strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book to take the book who is able to open the seals who is able to open this book see the angel asked it John saw it the angel asked it and he said now who is worthy let him oh my maybe I'm just feeling this this way but let him said the angel let him hear is the book of redemption my brother and sister will look at the seven seals we can look at it now there'll be people who say they're not open I'm not here to argue with you if you don't see that they're open now this fine I believe they're open I believe the majority of the church that I pastor believes if not all that the seals are open I'm not here to argue that but I'm here to tell you here was a book sealed with seven seals and a prophet of God shows us clearly this is the book of redemption it is not just a mystery here and a mystery there to be unveiled but this is the very book of redemption which means that within the seven seals it contains the bride of Jesus Christ she is not external to that she is in that mystery that needed to be revealed now you put that in there and think about that and hold on to that idea now my brother and sister but let him said the angel let him here is the book of redemption here is the plan of redemption here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed but I was redeemed before the foundation in the world but it had to be manifested it had to be open God wasn't going to take who was the Bride of Christ as it were as a mystery back to heaven with him he revealed that here and he revealed it and you say but we still don't know who the Bride of Christ is but I'm telling you my brother and sister the prophet of God showed us that the Bride of Christ is coming to a knowledge of who she is he says when she sees who she is right he didn't say when this great ministry over here or angel sees or someone over here sees he says when she sees who she is so there is now a revelation that is unfolding to the Bride of Christ on the earth today because when she sees who she is she will become an invincible army and so this revelation of the plan of redemption the book of redemption must be opened in this hour that the bride my brother and sister now we can't sometimes if we're preachers and we get a little carried away we might judge people by their actions but maybe they've been taught a certain way and they don't see something but God is shining that light in their path and they're starting to realize and they don't even realize all well I'm now the bride what they realize is is they're having victory after victory over personal things in their life and their family that they are able things that control them they're now able to control that by the grace of Almighty God what is she doing she's seeing that God is with her and that she has power over the spirits that have held her hostage or held her in bondage and so as she's moving forward she starts to realize who she is and it's not me the powerful me the Conqueror but it's Christ in me that is taking care and and fulfilling these things of the word and so there it is changing the position my brother and sister of a son or daughter of God so let's come forth who is able open the book Angel asket John sought who is now who is worthy maybe I'm just feeling this this way but let him said the angel let him here is the book of redemption here's the plan of redemption here's the only way you'll ever be redeemed for here is the title deed to redemption of the whole heavens and earth let him come forward if he will oh my now speak or forever hold his peace let him come forward and claim this book who is worthy to do it brother Branham said that in the breach I encourage you paragraphs 155 157 just go listen to the whole sermon don't just go pick out one spot it's incredible message amen because as you look at that you realize that the plan of redemption we can say well it was all in in Jesus Christ he his death burial resurrection there was a plan of redemption my brother it's much deeper the world today for a low gamut of Christendom a whole gamut of that is saying yeah Jesus died was buried and resurrected but it is not producing what the word said so there's something deeper than just resurrected understanding or seeing a death a burial and resurrection amen you have to see what is contained in there now as we'll look at this I want to bring further clarity and souls that are in prison now brother Branham goes on along this same thought a few months later approximately eight months just shy of eight months later he preaches this he said but one day he rose from there and come forth where was the book at it was still in the abstract owner God Almighty and John looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially opened the seals to reveal what the hidden mystery was the mysteries was in the seven seals and when those seven seals was open that opened the entire Bible now here again I'm not here to cause problem with those who don't believe the seals are open but I'm just simple enough my brother and sister I'm not intellectual and when I read this it tells me when those seven seals open that opened the entire Bible so if we do not have seven seals open we do not have an entire Bible opened so I stand on that I believe it's open because here we are my brother and sister I believe that the Bible is an open book to the bride of Jesus Christ amen it is not something that we are going to go and to a rapture with only a partial understanding the word said at the sounding of the seventh angels messenger the mysteries of God should be finished come complete not just finished as in put a period on it but it would be completed and so it's there as we look at this I'm not like I said I'm not apologetic this morning nor am i trying to be overly aggressive this morning but my brother and sister I believe that God sent a prophet in our day to open the book and make it a revealed book not a book of mystery does that mean that Paul understands it all no it does not mean that Paul understands all of it but the impact or the influence or the word of being brought forth the power of the word I believe is open and it is here and we might not be able to explain it like a theologian but my brother and sister I believe that the open book has an effect upon you and I'm and it's bringing us you and I not someone else not another church not another country you and I to a place that we are able to say amen to every word of God upon saying amen to that word it releases the power in that word now we as a prophet of God shows us we do not have power but we do have authority amen our just listening I listen to several sermons this last few days in the tractor and I'm sorry I can't quite place which what was in but brother Brannon once again references that little policeman his hats big enough it's down over his ears and he's there with that uniform that's too big he stands out there in the street but my brother and sister when he raises that whistle puts it to his lips and blows it and his little Oh scrawny arm out there that little hand it is not his power that will stop those cars it's the authority behind them we're not here looking for some kind of power to personally come and bind Satan to personally come and overcome Satan but we're here my brother and sister with the authority to unleash the word that has been restored in our day the word that a prophet of God set back in order we have been given the authority to use that word amen for the benefit of our personal life as in salvation and for our wives and our children and our families and those around us we've been given that kind of authority I say we use it I say we quit sitting back saying well I hope I say we start saying the word says the word says that we can claim this the word says that when we submit ourselves to the Word of God that glove and the prophet of God obligated himself it's not you and I putting him under obligation God Himself obligated himself to bring it to pass well thank you lord thank you lord oh my now where was I amen what was it still in the abstract owner mysteries in the seven seals there we are but when those seven seals was opened that opened up the entire Bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and in those seven seals held the entire mystery of it and it was the book of redemption , new Testament what was this the New Testament now being brought to life all that took place in the New Testament being brought to life not the old it only proclaimed for the New Testament they have been made cannot be made perfect without us Hebrews 11 and we'll touch on that in a minute see see now the redemption only come when the Redeemer died you see the prophet of God didn't say that Redemption only come when the Redeemer resurrected says redemption came when the Redeemer died you see my brother and sister it was a given because of prophecy that when the Redeemer was sacrificed crucified he died he would resurrect it wasn't we hope he would resurrect and we're waiting that's a human element that sought that way but to God it was a matter of I will die I will put my son Jesus Christ on the cross I not God dying but I'll put my son on the cross and then as he gives up the ghost that body will go into a grave and it will be there for three days amen and he will resurrect because this is a part of my plan of redemption this is my evidence to humanity that I'm alive and well and if they will live in me they have resurrection power in them also amen I'll tell you my brother and sister as we have heard it many times may if Jesus had not been named Nazareth at the at the graveyard if he had just said come forth that whole cemetery would emptied itself but God was very specific when he brought that out and anointed that to come forth that he named what it was and I tie that back my brother and sister to those whose names are on the Lamb's Book of Life amen they are named by God we are not my brother and sister we are not contained I hope you catch this we are not contained within the general resurrection alone you see the general resurrection will be those that come forth to stand before God to be judged at the white throne of judgment we are not coming forth in a general resurrection as to just be one of the common but when that day comes and that word is spoken and that of thunders you might say around the earth and it claps you might say on the backside and comes back around every son and daughter of God whether they be in the ocean they were burnt up they were fed the wild animals it's not been a matter to God he knows where every molecule in every portion is and so when Redemption my brother and sister starts to come forth in that that we would call the resurrection or the rapture when that starts to come forth every molecule knows where it belongs everything knows where it's supposed to fall in place there won't be a mystery there won't be over there going well is this my hip boner is this know my brother and sister they'll know hallelujah I hope I'm making sense this morning hey man I I preach sister Jerry comes in this morning she says who are you talking to I don't worry about I'm just talking to myself amen I was excited this morning knowing I didn't really have an order to put it in but God was good I believe amen so redemption only come when the Redeemer died and they were potentially under the blood of lambs not the Redeemer hadn't been redeemed yet until the Redeemer came notice now when this Redeemer John looked around and here said God on the throne with a book in his hand had been sealed with seven seals and the whole plan of redemption was in it and it had been lost by the human race Adam and God it went back where Satan couldn't take it he just calls them to lose it oh my brother and sister let me assure you that Satan never walked around with the Lamb's Book of Life saying I've got it I've got it all he did was cause them to lose it so realize that this devil never was there trying to pick the lock on the seven seals my brother and sister he put his interpretation to it he did all that he did but that seven seal my brother and sister this plan of redemption is God's plan it's nobody else's plan it's no Vicar it's no Pope it's no Bishop it's no hierarchy it's no great man my brother and sister this plan is God's plan and it will always be God's plan always has been always will be hallelujah the whole plan of redemption was in it and it had been lost by the human race Adam it went back where Satan couldn't take it he just caused him to lose it but where did the book Oh - then didn't belong to the human race blessings didn't belong here here the human race had lost it so when we're right back to the original owner that was God hallelujah that way we can say today I've always been in God's hands amen there's never been a time in my life even when I was not professing not living not doing what I should my life was in his hands I believe there's a song talks about that my life is in his hands amen it's never actually people like well you know when I was a young man it's kind of sad actually I back slid you know a people way back when we spoke to my parents oh how sad it was that your son is lost and you know at the time it just simply made me mad that people could be so rude but you know later on when God started to deal with me I realized my brother and sister no matter where my position looked like it was on this earth I was always in God's hands so I look back and I say well thank you Lord I'm not here to boast about some of the experiences I had but some of the things that show me clearly Who I am in Jesus Christ took place while I was not even serving him and so God used those things out there to reinforce Paul's need for Jesus Christ in his life hallelujah I believe that would apply to each and every one of us amen so went right back to its original owner that was God and here he set with it and he called for some man somebody to come and claim it John looked around and there was no man in heaven no man on earth nobody no angel I just read a quote last night you know brother branham's talking about we were made to be men will always be men we're not angels my brother and sister we're not angels God created us to be men women amen not angels some people have these crazy ideas that we somehow come from angels and come down to the earth but well you can choose believe your idea or the prophets whichever amen no angel nothing could take the book or loose the seals or even look on it no man was worthy John said he wept bitterly then an angel came to him said we've not John for the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and he is worthy now imagine my brother and sister I believe John was just a man obviously used of God anointed of God to fulfill the word for his day and so it was there that you would see him being led by and by God to do what he's done and now John is there and you know the the voice speaks to him weep not John for the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he is worthy now look John turns now brother branham house kind of here paragraph 148 you see John looked to see a lamb brother Ramzan stops or see a lion and what did he find you see the voice told him that the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he turned to look to expecting to see a lion but what does he see here he sees a bloody lamb and lamb that had been slain how long since the foundation of the world that the lamb came forth walked up to him that had the book in his right hand received the book climbed up on the throne and sat down that's it it was over oh my brother and sister do you get it here it is it's over Jesus as he's hanging on the cross said it is finished but you see like an author writing a book he did not put a period when he said it is finished it is not a period as in nothing else could come after this but this segment this portion taking place was finished in other words there was no need to come back and modify it no need to come back and add to it to get an explanation or an authority to bring it to pass but it was finished it was fully capable of fulfilling everything that it was asked to do it was over when when the seals was revealed my maybe the books not open but the word says the lamb had prevailed to open the book when the last one that was everything that he had redeemed there was nothing he come to redeem say why didn't he redeem them 40 years ago two thousand years ago see their names are on the book of life in that book and he had to stand here because it was God's purpose to redeem them their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and the lamb was put there with it to be slain are you with me there is the names on the Lamb's Book of Life and God put the lamb right there with those names to be slain he didn't come afterwards and say now look we got to find a lamb we've got to do something to redeem this as he put the names in the book he put the lamb right there with the names right there with the book my brother and sister to be slain and here come the lamb when was slain come back to make intercessions Oh hallelujah I love this you see it's not just a matter of a crucifixion on a cross it was not a matter of just being placed in a grave it's not just a matter of a resurrection all of that was a part of the plan of redemption and so if you have a plan my brother and sister and you empower the plan you execute you might say mmm that's funny I use that word execute the plan and you started to be set in motion my brother's sister there has to be a manifestation of that plan there has to be a revelation there has to be something my brother and sister that would be then put upon display there has to be something that would be brought forth to show something exhibited something demonstrated you say well we have a plan well you know look at the government right now they have hand I don't know they might be on their 15th or 20th plan the world is on there whatever amount of plans we're gonna stop a virus we're gonna stop a virus the virus will stop when God ordained it to stop not one minute sooner not one minute later my brother and sister just like the mystery that the world acknowledged they could not understand how at that moment of time on the day and the of time that World War one stopped it wasn't that they announced there has been a treaty or a surrender there was men on the battlefield that knew nothing about a treaty or surrender but there was something passed over and they quit shooting at each other and Men started rising up out of the trenches and looking at one another not as a combatant not as an enemy but as mankind and there was something I've read a lot of history on that there was something anointed those men I remember reading about I believe it was a British soldier and he was quite a good soldier very good at the craft of warfare and there was something come upon him that something swept over him and he said I cannot take another life what is it 90 of Almighty God the power of God my brother and sister stronger than national politics stronger than denominational spirits stronger than ideology the anointing of Almighty God more powerful my brother and sister sharper than a two-edged sword God is in control hallelujah sorry if I silenced Trident this morning I'm just actually very excited as I look at this that I can come I can walk with confidence in this plan that God has laid out in my generation I don't have to worry about going so far being deceived drugged off and pitched in a pit somewhere I can stand with full confidence this is all part of the plan of God that has been unfolding and unfolding all the way from the foundation before the foundation of the world amen to know that we are part of God's plan hallelujah oh my oh my oh my you see what it is it's bringing to pass my brother and sister the prophecy of the Word of God coming to our day and you see oh not only did God record the name on the lamb book of life he put the lamb right there to be slain amen now look at this I love this watch him there'll be a lot of impersonation a lot of everything else but there was really somebody was going to be saved really was somebody going to be saved it's not an abstract my brother and sister it's not a theory if you go into some of the definitions of manifested on the Internet some of them are talking about theories coming to pass and different things like that this was not a theory this were this was a plan of God not a theory that this will work not a theory my brother and sister met hundreds upon hundreds of thousands are going to die in the United States and they're going to be littering the streets it's not a theory of what this is going to happen here this is a plan of God and God said in the latter times that they would even be plagues come upon the people they would be curses come upon them because they rejected God my brother and sister they can go for all the vaccines they want and they might even be allowed by God to develop one to come forth and say look what we have done but here again taking it back like it was in World War one if God does not ordain the time in this season it'll just mutate beyond their vaccine and mutate beyond their vaccine and as many will die my brother and sister as was ordained to die just as it was in the wilderness when the brazen serpent was raised up my brother and sister if they refuse to look back to the brazen serpent sin already judged if they refuse to look back they died so even though some people say well how could that be but even though the brazen serpent being present in their myths many refused to look Oh hallelujah well I've seen a little cartoon and I forget the words it was on it you know covent that guy sitting a little booth kovat 19 or something you know you know the end is coming death and whatever come you know here get your deal in a big long line booth right beside it Jesus is coming come and it's empty you see the people right now now this is gonna be a little harsh forgive me but there's people around the message that what's coming it might not be really what's in their heart but what's coming out of their mouth is we're terrified of this virus well hallelujah I might die today I'll just put that corner so people just don't have to get too upset sister Jerry will bet she'll get over my brother and sister I can't die one second before God ordains it my if God had so much confidence in his own power to let Daniel his prophet be throwed in a lion's den he didn't go down there and put a brick mason in there first he didn't go put up a wire fence he didn't give Daniel you know some kind of high voltage shocking whatever to defend himself God Himself come right down there now my brother and sister the Holy Ghost wasn't given yet but that was the presence of Almighty God we could stand today and say that was a Holy Spirit that was protecting Daniel in that lion's den the angel of the Lord come right down there Daniel didn't go down there and say well Lord you know I hope this lion only stop and bless his food before he eats it Daniel said Lord thy will be done and that's why I say today if I don't live through this day I'm not concerned about it because God's will be done but my brother and sister I refuse to allow myself to be infected with the virus of fear that came from the pits of hell while I hold on to the message with one hand and I terrified of what's going on on the earth on the other hand come on my brother and sister let's get the blood over the doorpost let's get the blood on the post and the lentil let's not stand back and say well if this and if that no should we wash our hands should you not shake hands with people that you know you don't know and and you know do all these kind I'm talking common sense here but my brother and sisters some people are possessed with a fear and that's fear won't end with this virus because there'll be something that will come on the earth right behind this and they'll be run right behind that and one right behind that and pretty soon they'll be tiptoeing instead of walking around like a conqueror Oh hallelujah so if I die today or tomorrow people will be able to say well we think Paul was wrong that's fine I just beat you to glory is all you look at it any way you want I just beat you there you should be jealous hallelujah the church was predestinated to be without spot or wrinkle did I hear that word right the church was predestinated God didn't say I now I just hope that there is a church that does not have spot or wrinkle I'm hoping that somehow this will work out that they really show up a church that has not been tarnished by Laodicea no my brother and sister the prophet of God said the church was torn was predestinated I mean to be without spot or wrinkle she is going to be there now I've become kind of a realist you might say when I read these things a prophet of God said because if he was just merely bantering words and then we can get right down to the very very serious things of the gospel and just decide that he was just kind of throwing out some kind of phraseology so when he's talking about this predestinated to be without spot or wrinkle now you can say well I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God I believe in predestination I believe we could all lift a hand on her head do whatever you want to do I believe in predestination my brother and sister how about you believe in predestination it won't be just you'll see the word for this day but if that word that you saw will produce a church a people without a spot or a wrinkle in their life Oh hallelujah I don't know if that's possible brother Paul I'm human well I'm gonna say here right now and say I believe it's possible because he said it hey man I don't have to bring it to pass I don't have to manufacture this I don't have to go out and talk to the little sheep every day now you push out a little bit of wool today my brother and sister it's just gonna happen because God said it hallelujah amen she's going to be there and then lamb died for that purpose Oh hallelujah don't you just love this Amen brother branham I I won't go ahead and preach on that time is fleeting brother I'm talking about the three stages of grace my brother and sister God's grace is sufficient amen when the last name on that book is redeemed the lamb come forth took the book I'm the one that did it the angels cherubims four and twenty elders beasts everything uncrowned themselves and fell down before the throne and said worthy art thou John said everything in heaven and earth heard me hollering oh I tell you what I'd like to have some brothers like John in the church I'd like to have some people that when they saw their name saw they were part of this great plan of redemption that they just hollered so loud it shook the heavens I tell you I'm not speaking down to you folks come on this morning but I'm telling you this is a monumental moment this is an incredible thing that God has done that all of the sickness and the sin and all the unbelief and all the circumstance and God just raised you right above that said you don't have to wallow down there just trust me and ask and just raise up come come right up here into heavenly places and rejoice for what I've done for you it's already finished hallelujah oh hey men screaming hallelujah and praises to God the scream went up why their names was in that book to be revealed and the lamb had revealed it all my brother and sister you see God has opened his plan of redemption to us we are not sitting here as a great mystery of what happens next come on Saints oh there will be those that are the critical thinkers and they'll say well Paul you don't know what's happening next oh no I do I do know what's happening next I'm gonna go day by day I'm gonna walk right down through this this stage of life and day by day I'm gonna be filled more and more and I'm gonna have more confidence I'm gonna have for coming power I'm gonna realize the sword that's been placed in my hand was for me to use against the enemy not just pack around and rattle against my boot amen and not next step will be another step and I'll come up with more authority I'll come and the word we'll be opening up more and more and more Holy Ghost flowing in and the next step I know what's going to happen my brother and sister and rapturing faith is going to be poured on us like a bucket ice water no it isn't my brother and sister it's going to be poured into you just one little bit at a time until the day comes when you need to be able to speak that delivering word and you'll come right out of your mouth and you'll say mountain be removed and it will come to pass and you won't be saying yes sir I knew it you'll be saying thank you Lord the power of God coming down and I tell you my brother and sister I know what it'll be I'm not concerned there's people like well if you think you know when coming when is he coming back that's not my problem all I've got to do is step into my correct position and let the Word of God flow into me the power of God flowing in and me saying thank you lord thank you lord and I'm growing and I'm growing and I'm growing and one of the things I appreciate about brother Ron Spencer and he spoke it for years and it resonate with me is that a that we come to the place that we can stand and say boo devil I don't have to be scared of you I don't have to dodge you I don't have to do this it's you that's got to get out of my way it's you that will be placed according to the word under my feet hallelujah we're not placed under Satan's feet he's placed under our feet and this my brother and sister is what happens when we recognize who we are in the plan of redemption if you're a church goer go to church hallelujah but I'm not just a churchgoer I don't believe you were just a churchgoer we are sons of the king and as I spoke to you here a few Sundays ago we have got the DNA of the King of Kings of God all mighty yellow him we've got his DNA in us and that DNA automatically makes you and I an overcomer hallelujah all the brother Paul if you only knew the challenges I was facing I don't know the challenges you face I don't know what's going on in your life I don't know whether you got two cents or two million in the bank account it doesn't matter to me this word is true and I believe it and if you only got two cents do like that little woman and go throw them in the offering and then ask for God's blessings for your faithfulness my brother and sister it's not about our natural security blanket that we have developed and got sitting down here and the First National Bank of whatever we need to have something in the First National Bank of glory hallelujah and it's there you can draw on that deposit and God will work in your life oh my oh my as there were my brother and sister and the writing of the book of Redemption the author declared it was finished but I don't think he put a period there that's finished don't worry about it's all done you see now it's got to be manifested now it's got to have somebody that was ordained or predestinate as we just read that's gonna step out in laodicea and say God's Word said it I believe it and I'm gonna overcome it I will come to the place I'll be able to stand before him and he will say well done my good and faithful servant he's not going to have to pull out this little wheel okay you tried your best I'm gonna give you this pass go collect $200 card no my brother and sister you say well i brother paul i just don't see it my life well you don't need to see it in your life you need to just believe it's in your life you say well Paul out won't we see it manifestation yes you will yes you will but my brother and sisters sometimes we have to go down before we can go up amen sometimes we have to come to the place we're willing to submit to God before God can ever give us the authority hallelujah oh you know I I have a bad habit of throwing Jerry under the bus don't want to Easter to go by without at least trying you know when Jerry and I first got married I'm not trying to give an absolute example of this but when Jerry and I first got married I believe it was the first time in her life that she had Liberty and I just remember we'd been married for two or three months and one day I come home from work and there's these two huge envelopes on the counter in our house and I asked her what are those and she kind of him hard around or like well I went over and picked it up they were both from the bank and I saw my goodness them big thick envelopes and back in them days I used to use that sticky stuff where you could peel the envelope open and then seal it back up and I peeled that thing open and and here's check after check after check what was the least amount Jerry it was like 60 58 cents she wrote a check for 58 cents and even 36 years ago 58 cents wasn't much money but you see she caught the revelation that her name was good on that check she caught my brother and sister oh I hope you see this today let a little humor a rock in your life today she caught the revelation that it wasn't only for big things I can write a check it isn't that I've got cancer and I'm dying I can write a check it might be that you're just troubled by a spirit or even something that you don't understand in the word and you can say Lord I'm writing a check today cuz I want to understand the full depth Lord of John 3:16 everybody sigh everybody knows John 3:16 if you know know it you don't know it all you got to do is say Lord I'm writing a check because I want to understand that oh my brother and sister she caught that revelation she went here mostly she walked amen back in those days we actually lived in the edge of town she just walked right down into town and go but I didn't care I did care I can't lie communions coming it's only Sunday but communion is coming I was like what are you doing girl we have some cash you want to walk down there and get a slushie go get a slushie I don't care but don't write a check for a slushie so you know what happens we can't write a check and we don't have cash so we don't do anything at all and Satan says see you're just as powerless you the Bride of Christ just as powerless is all all the rest of them come on Saints you need to write a check for fifty eight cents you need God just to come maybe you're not sleeping well at night got some pain in your body write the check write the check the plan of redemption included you having a checkbook a prophet of God clearly showed us that write the check make your claim hallelujah because you see my brother and sister we I believe are in this season of the manifestation of the spoken word and there's got to be a time we are not going my brother and sister to step from nothing at all no faith at all to fit Mountains God wants you to exercise the plan of redemption has a plan for you to learn how to fly mother Eagle Oh what does she do she goes right up there I love how brother branham describes that he gets them little eaglets to clamp on she takes them out there and shakes him off and they're just falling like whatever they're there squawking and tumbling and whatever and she comes and she gathers them up again and she takes him up and she does this over and over again and I'm telling you my brother and sister where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered but these aren't ground burden to eagles these are not Eagles that walk everywhere they go and they're going along they're looking at some road map saying well okay if I go down here twelve miles turn left and go over here climb over the hill there'll be a carcass there these are eagles that God trained to fly and when they get that revelation that they can fly and they see the carcass what is it they thrill they would rather fly and then sit on the earth they would rather fly in the heavenlies than sit on a tree limb and squawk at each other but we've got to catch the revelation that we were born to fly and that we are Eagles that we can write the check amen hallelujah oh you know what this might be a strong statement but I don't believe we can say that we've received redemption if there is no manifestation if we have not one bit of evidence that God has come and redeemed us and it's changed our life if we still got that old Bulldog nature we're going to plow through nobody can hold a conversation with you because you're always right and you you get dominate everything around my brother and sister I don't think you can say that you've received a Redemption if you don't have the manifestation of the nature now brother Branham said in God's a provided place of worship amen did we skip over that no it's right here God's provided place of worship amen so what's brother Brown say here in paragraph two oh eight but I just want to jump right down here brother I haven't got it right on on par there and I find out a better results he's talking about the prayer line and and laboring and struggling to pray over these and he says you know I find out better results by just getting myself into God's arms and saying Lord God you promised it it's your promise it's not mine it's yours you promised you would do it and I've seen you do it see the prophet of God speaking my brother and sister here in this you can go to paragraph 208 if you want to find a reference on that later but my brother and sister you look at that see the Prophet God's talking about how when he used to labor under this and under that now he's just settled himself back in God's arms and he's just like Lord it's your gift you made the promise to these people you're the one that's gonna make it pass and now he's just doing it and he says and I find better results by just getting myself Oh who wants results we can get some results my brother and sister we can get better results it will just get ourselves into God's arms let's go over there not stand off and say now Lord you got to prove this to me just get in his arms don't you love it I as a grandfather as a grandfather I can relate to this even Aliyah she's growing up now turning into a big girl on me but you know what there's nothing I thrills my heart more than to have my grandchildren kind of either sitting on the arm of the chair or in my lap and I can get my arms around them and hold them there's something that just energizes my soul something that right down to the very depths of me that this is a gift God gave me my brother and sister when we come to the place we can lay our self in God's arms and just receive what he's got Oh hallelujah and I'm going to believe you're going to do it because I've been baptized into your body in your spirit here to identify that's the truth amen that's the place of worship then you get into a place all things are possible then you get into place that that your motives your objectives for your achievements it's just exactly in the will of God and when you lay your hands there and believe it it's going to happen can we say amen to that today and believe that amen when we get to that place that all the things that we're wanting to do what we're trying to accomplish and all of that we just get it exactly into God's will and then you just start coming place I believe it I believe it prophet of God says did you believe that congregation said Amen hallelujah oh my I'm gonna run out of time here this morning in that terrible do it all the time well hallelujah someday someday as we as humans you know we'll be able to the Lord of this give us a bigger gas tank hallelujah instead of putting in 20 gallons we'll be able to put in 120 when you read and comprehend Hebrews 11 and all that is contained in Hebrews 11 lovely chapter you know we call it the faith chapter but in that when you read all of Hebrews 11 you are getting the thumbnail view of every trial every temptation every struggle and ever overcoming event that took place in these people's lives all that's contained there the trials and the victories those that gave their lives and those as the scripture said those women whose children were raised from the dead you see we we see it all right there amen and Hebrews eleven forty years referenced earlier in a quote their God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you see what we have in this day my brother and sister is you might say a final ingredient to the Word of God the plan of redemption as it encompassed all of mankind through the ages the plan of redemption needed one last little something to make it perfect and that was you and I and we are here in a very unique time because we're seeing a mixture of all the spirits of all the church ages we're seeing all of this mixed together the greatest religious spirits of all time the greatest deceptive spirits of all time and we're seeing it all blended together and when I say of all time my brother and sister that means that the word in this day is stronger than anything that Satan can offer so here we're coming down to the most deceptive time not there has to be a power being poured into the church part of the plan of redemption said right before this is all finished I'm going to pour such power into my church and they are going to believe that they have the authority to exercise that power and they will be able my brother and sister to speak and it will happen now you say brother Paul I just don't see that certainly it's happened in my life well you just keep claiming it you don't talk about the negative you know speak about what you see speak what the word has declared to you because they without us should not be made perfect I'll tell you this morning my brother and sisters I want them to be perfect I want them to be perfect that means you and I will fulfill our calling in this word in this day what I would say our calling in the message hallelujah now in the message their token brother Branham says now there's Easter Sunday I don't like to claim exemptions amen I tried to reign you know myself back brother David back sometimes because we we preach too long but if you just give me an X or a few minutes maybe this morning amen in the token brother Brown says we're not to come together to talk about the message now that doesn't mean we can't get together and talk about the message but look what he's saying we're not to come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the word that's right we're to get into it get beneath it yes sir that's what we're supposed to do he was not responsible this is talking about now in Egypt and the blood on the doorpost on the lentil this is so you go back in the token you'll find where brother was talking about that amen he was not responsible for any person out from under the blood not one no matter who he was he was not responsible all he had to do take not only himself but his whole family they were only safe when the token was displayed look when the token go back you'll find them what is that when it means the same synonym you're gonna find amen hope this won't offend nobody there only safe when the token was manifested oh you can say whatever you want to say and you can know whoever you want to know but my brother and sister if the blood was not displayed the Death Angel didn't stop and say you're friends with who you've been in church how long the blood was either there all my brother and sister we cannot feel safe until this token is displayed you go back right back to the old Webster and you'll find that it's a direct correlation manifested and displayed go together we cannot feel safe until this token is manifested it's displayed that's right you must come under this token God's Holy Spirit and it displays to you hmm can I keep interchanging nobody get offended there's nobody here to be offended I guess so hopefully you're not offended out there and it manifests to you Jesus Christ in other words it displace Christ to you not just something we talked about your message believers praise God sent a prophet good he sent a prophet where's the manifestation where is the display of what God did oh my I spoiled that didn't I kind of got a little negative for a moment and it displays to you Jesus Christ because it comes and lives in you wait this is saying the Holy Spirit's living in us it's Jesus Christ right because he said right up here at the top of the quote am i right he said right here we always wonder what the message is the message is Christ I think that ought to be simple enough if we want to describe somebody what is the message Jesus Christ hmm my well I've been told for quite a while now say what the Prophet said hallelujah we can all feel safe until this token is played that's right you must come under this token God's holy spirit and it displays to you Jesus Christ because it comes and lives in you as I said last night and up in New York at one of the message if I told you that Shakespeare lived in me I would do the works of Shakespeare because I couldn't help it I'm no more myself I am dead Shakespeare and I can't live together in here Shakespeare was a poet and I'm a minister we can't live together amen but I am dead to myself then and Shakespeare lives in me the works of Shakespeare I'll do the life of Shakespeare and me will be lived out like Shakespeare if the life the Beethoven is lived in me I would be like the Tobin if the life of John Dillinger lived in me I would be John Dillinger that's right and if the life of Jesus Christ lives in the person they become identified with him its Christ in you not a church member not a system but a resurrected power can someone say amen to that hallelujah it's the Holy Ghost is a token upon you that your life says amen to every scripture the promise is written in here and you are not yourself no more oh I'll tell you my brother and sister this just strikes home because we all in vocabulary use this but some people really mean it your Christ you don't think your thoughts you don't think your thoughts you say I that was in cry I think yeah you don't think your thoughts you say I think you got no thoughts coming nah hmm good we all say that I think how many times have we done that I think well praise the Lord if you think the bolt should go from the bottom up or the top down that's fine my brother and sister it really should go from the top down because then if the nut falls off at least the bolt will stay there hmm there's a reason behind some of this engineering isn't there but it's not up to what we think you don't think your thoughts you don't think your thoughts you say I think you have no thought coming the life that was in Christ is in you the mind that was in Christ is in you the works that was in Christ is in you and Christ himself is in you and you are dead your life is hidden God through Christ sealed in there by the Holy Ghost you are not your own hallelujah the whole plan of redemption my brother and sister wasn't to produce a bunch of Christians that went around saying I think I know III we are nothing he is everything and what I am is because Christ is in me you say well brother Paul there's people in the world they have their wisdom they have their deal they're successful that's right my brother and sister the Word of God clearly covers that it shows where the Spirit come from it shows what their motive is it shows what their objective is why would you compare yourself to the world they are of their seed you are of the royal seed and the royal seed flows through our veins the DNA of Jesus Christ is in us I say Lord I want to be what you have said I would be and I want the nature so Lord I want to see redemption manifested in me that I can put you Lord on display hallelujah oh my brother and sister I tell you what I just get so excited about these things oh praise the Lord sister Amy would you come amen brother Shawn I just think we I've got some other notes here but we're just going to stop right there amen you say what you're going to do right here I do want to finish the last of this little quote here on the token amen so look here he says you're not yourself no more your Christ see it's not responsible for anybody the whole family must be brought into the token must be splayed it had to be if it wasn't displayed then it was of none effect you could believe in it you could say oh yes I believe it but that didn't do it you say well well I'll tell you what I'll do I'll put it in a bucket speaking of the blood I'll set it over here on the wall but really I think as long as I have it in here if I have the blood over here no sir you can't be a secret boy about it no sir you've got to have it you've got to have it on display that was the purpose of putting it on the door so he could see it on the lintel and on the doorpost once again I want to drive this home not very close that very relationship between display and manifest it's something you're not ashamed of you want the whole world to know that you are dead and your life is hid in God through Christ my brother and sister you see our Lord Jesus death burial resurrection was much more than just something for us to preach on once a year it's much more than just something that we would come in a certain season it's a very life of the bride of Jesus Christ it is who she is amen we are dead and buried in our life is hid in Jesus Christ hallelujah brother Jason would you just come and help us I just when I was studying this morning I found myself singing onward Christian soldiers you know I think about that I get excited when I think about the prophet of God as he's there and he's looking at the bride saw that vision and he sees the bride going and as she comes around that second time she starts to go up and she's singing onward Christian soldier my brother's sister I get excited about it because I believe he actually saw me I believe I was right there in that row then that midst of that bride maybe if God was to segregate it down by nation maybe within the nation there would be the states and the churches that were there I don't know exactly but I believe that he saw me in I'm gonna lay a hold on that I'm gonna claim that Amen and I'm not going to get out of step lord help me not to be out of step lord I just want to walk according to your word I want to remain in step but if I was the one the prophet of God saw and he said get back in step get back in line then I want to just say yes sir and get right back in line I don't want to start fussing over I think it means this or I think it means that I want to just respond yes sir yes sir and get right into the line amen Oh hallelujah onward Christian soldiers were Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before Christ a royal master leads against our fall forward into battle see his manners roll former Christian soldiers marching ass [Music] there is the cross of Jesus going on before for light of my yard Church of God brothers we are trained where the scenes have draw we are not divided Oh one body we won in hope and off red one in charity Hawk were Christian soul [Music]

bears through countless ages for men and angels sing or were Christian soldiers marching as with the cross of Jesus Alleluia we put that cross right out in front of us we pick up that sword that he give us and we believe that we are more than conquerors amen that way no matter what you face you're not going to look at it and say hmm I better back up from this you're gonna say I've already conquered the lust of sin amen the pride of life all of the things that Satan throws out you know Satan my brother and sister he has a career path for us he has a life path for us brother Branham says he has a plan now we got a choice we can either follow the plan of redemption or we can follow Satan's plan I think I'm gonna vote for the plan of redemption amen I think it gives me much more clear it gives clarity to my life it gives me confidence to go out in the morning amen I was just talking to a brother the other day people around the message get all you talk about well I got a good job or I had a good opportunity I made some money people get all nervous oh my where's the bride we're not about money quit lying to yourself amen you'd rather have $10,000 in the bank than ten dollars in the bank don't tell me you feel different amen [Music] but God gives us a plan kidding here I've got $10,000 in the bank do I go over here and hold my bankers statement hmm no I say Lord I want to just follow what you want me to do now I don't say this boastfully I just say it to tell you the truth sister Jerri and I have had many times in our life we've had $10,000 in the bank the Lord laid on our heart we set money all different directions until we didn't have very much in our bank account and you might say well that's silly brother Paul but you see I have this confidence every time every single time I think of sister Jerry would speak up so you could say Amen every single time we have done that God put the money right back in our bank account Lord I just want to be obedient it isn't about how much money's in my bank account it's that I want to do what God wants me to do I want to live the life that God has called me to live hallelujah the name of the Lord a strong tower the
