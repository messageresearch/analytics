i ever did but did i even have a choice and that's the incredible part of this love story before we could ever form a thought we were chosen father we were chosen for this time in this place and falling in love with you is our top priority it's our number one job how we do that many different ways before our main focus is falling in love with you lord you know what you've laid on my heart tonight for jesus father so perfectly lining up while we ask that we will be ready to receive what you have to say tonight lord i love my heart [Music] father you love us more than we could even comprehend father because your love we are is for that theophany the father the outside man the flesh wars against those eternal things lord but father may they come subject tonight lord jesus to your word that you would speak to us we ask we love you father we commit our pastor his wife into your hands away maybe just enjoy their time before they bring them home safely we love you lord [Music] um my goodness that song was perfect you know sometimes you question did you get it right did you pick the right thing to preach on and my title tonight is rescued by my lover and i think that's just perfect with that song falling in love with jesus amen why don't we stand tonight the last couple services brother david i almost preached to my notes paul and uh so i said well i guess i'm i'm in the right channel praise the lord just lining up so perfectly his title was the greatest love story praise the lord isaiah chapter four and in that day seven women shall take hold of verse one what one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach and that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even everyone that is written among the living in jerusalem when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment by the spirit of burning and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and upon our assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain amen psalms 57 verse 1. so psalms 57 be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusted in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that should that would swallow me up say law god shall send forth his mercy and his truth so he says he shall sin from heaven and save me and he's going to do that saving with his mercy and his truth mark chapter 13 save us from the reproach of him that would swallow not that dead verse 20 and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elect's sake whom he had chosen he had shortened the days and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ or lo he is there believe him not for false christs and false prophets shall rise now brother branham's talking about prophets at one point he said prophets is a preacher as well [Music] shall rise and shall show signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect they have the uh they have the appearance of the truth that's right but it's a facade but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things so uh we are not abandoned because it's deceiving may lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated tonight so this uh tonight i just uh you know it's not sure which direction this would this was would go um sometimes i have an idea but then the whatever your hearts are in need of whatever god's real desire is maybe a little bit different than what i forethought that being said tonight my title is rescued by my lover bringing that personal the title's for you your i could have said part of me wanted to stay rescued by our lover to make it a little bit less personal and um but that was the flesh because he's my lover and you each one of us can say that tonight that we've been rescued by my lover and you can go and and we can talk about our life and how god gave us the holy ghost and he gave us revelation of his word and that he rescued us looking at a broader sense of the bride and and it's so much more than being saved from our sins there's so much more that god has in store for us he doesn't just want to you know just save us and then take us because no he has so much he wants to give to us so much he wants us to know about him a relationship that's what he's looking for he doesn't want to just just be the the fireman that pulls you from the fire and then that's it never sees you again never talks to you again he wants to pull you from the fire and get to know you he wants to have a relationship with you and that's too full because the relationship with christ gives you the ability to live for christ and relationship is such a such a strong thing and the world that we live in what's lacking is relationship they think they have it figured out you know hey just put in all your your stats and how tall you are what you like the things you like to do and we'll match you with the perfect woman or the perfect man and we see the success rate of those but uh they haven't figured out relationships and they got a lot of books on relationships and and uh people say oh you know don't put up with that guy or don't put up with that woman you know be your own person and then and um there's a separation with uh being quarantined and in everything there's a separation um not saying that's a bad thing at some times but pulling away we have you know 575 friends on facebook but how many of those people do we actually know and have a relationship so what the devil is doing is he's progressing the thought that relationships is just simply an acquaintance so then when people get to actually know that person they say whoa what's their problem because all of their relationships are on the surface and if you're a person who has been hurt deeply bypass relationships you have a hard time going beyond the surface and that's what god wants you to do so sometimes the very the sometimes what you're what you're struggling with in your relationship with god with christ is that there's a barrier you raised up because of relationships in the past that you are struggling to push past because god wants an intimate relationship with you but that's what he came to do rescue you it's a love story it's a love story it's not a god is not a harsh god god is not a god who beats us that's not his position right now before the dispensation of grace it was the law but now god with underneath the dispensation of grace his desire is love and a relationship with us and that love is corrective but there's disciplining your child in love and then there's not and that not part is it not who god is not who christ is and don't let somebody tell you or bring to you that portray christ to you in that way because that's not according to his word brother says in god making his promise 1956 god is a lover god is love god so loved the world when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable and god here it is god wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking thirsting hungering trying to get to some of your starchy hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law but a love it's all in love god so loved do you realize christ is not complete without his bride i sent that studying the other night i sent that quote to my wife because i was just blown away he is seeking thirsting and hungering for our for for us to receive and share that love relationship and he rescued us so that we could do that now um amen he's seeking and thirsting brother adam says in the second coming of the lord 1957 he's praying and and um we skip down a little bit a little ways here but um i want to be a real lover he's praying and he's he's saying um god spoke to to your maybe you're saying maybe he's hugging the congregation maybe god spoke to your heart and you're saying i want to be a real lover that when i go to my lord kneel on my knees i want him to embrace me in his arms say o my lover you remember solomon how he spake of it he said come my love let us walk through the pomegranates let us walk through the garden of spices how he said her lips looked like rosebuds and so forth how he loved his little wife said come let us go and take our fill of love when you get down to your altar to pray is your heart so true and your soul so unadulterated that you say lord god let us take our love and you say yes my lover i love you or have you been committing fornication have you been flirting with the world and the hour of the lord is at hand when all these signs and wonders with tens of thousands of other things that's taking place pointing every marker is pointing it's getting darker it's getting dark there's a cooling off in the church god he's seeking he's seeking thirsting and hungering and the opposite of that love relationship is cooling off starchy people sometimes i say people but that's because that comes from that that opinion i guess you would say is formed from the people i have interacted with so maybe that's not what you've experienced and when i say people please if you've never experienced that that's just the people that i have come in contact with in the world and just in my life the circle i guess and um i said all that and i don't remember what i was talking about praise the lord should have done that just got to preach it um starchy so they get to a place where where you you've arrived and now the lord can't deal with your heart because you're there and there and you i'm sure you've seen him in church they just man they've got it together they're experienced christians completely unmovable they've lost their relationship with christ that's because it's not about that's where that's where the the the movement of of um the movement i'm just trying to choose my words correctly here the movement of um it's all about brother branham it's all about the prophet that movement removes that relationship with christ that's why they don't have any victory in their lives cooling off in the church the revival seems to be over the last bit is about finish and here we find ourselves in our self in adultery what will he do he'll shove us from his lap and say depart from me you workers of iniquity unless your heart is so true and your soul so unadulterated that you can say lord god let us take our love that is my horse desire and i believe that's your heart's desire tonight what you're worshiping is what you are loving in other words what are you putting your time and attention into you know what i was talking with my wife the other day and now and um uh husband and wife relationships we listening to the radio and you know some gals like oh we've been married for 23 years but we just grew distance so we divorced and you don't just grow distant you stop trying to growing close you don't just grow distant with the lord you stop trying to stay close with him if you want a good relationship with your with your spouse you have to put effort forward you have to keep the fire alive you have to work at that it doesn't just happen same with your relationship with christ it doesn't just happen god doesn't always just go sometimes he says look i'm going to show you this path to your healing deliverance successful relationship renewing of your relationship i'm going to show you this path and i want to see you step by faith through that process and then i will reward you at the end of that but james says ah show me forgive me in misquoting but he says you know i'll show you my faith by my works i believe we're mature enough to know what i'm talking about i'm not saying we're catholics no love now this is straight and i know we probably don't deal with this and i don't i don't whatever i'm not gonna give it oh asterix no love affair with the prophet that would be fornication falling in love with christ wait i got my notes in wrong order so no love affair with the prophet that will be fornication if your focus is the prophet you're committing adultery if your focus is the word brought through the prophet well now you're in the love affair with christ so here amen christ is wooing his bride while the deceived remember we read that scripture the deceased the very elect if it were possible they say lo there's there's christ is here what are they saying i don't recommend you go reading it but i've read it a few times just to kind of know what's going on they're saying this is christ go read it verbatim they're saying this is christ completely out of balance and twisting the words to say this is christ exactly how the scripture said now you want to know where christ is find the thing that lines up closest with his word that lines up excuse me perfectly with his word and you will find christ so the christ is wooing his bride while the deceived gaze into the eyes of the messenger looking for a love they'll never find looking into the eyes of the messenger for a love they'll never find they're trying to find something to appease their heart's desire but they'll never find it in another man they'll never find it in a man talk about how awkward that would be if rebecca saw isaac and she just oh and then just standing eliza come on wouldn't it just be weird if you were there in person that would just be awkward right say okay something's wrong here there's been a miscommunication isaac's like rebecca you're my wife but that's what they're doing that's what they're doing but and this is the point but even some people in that okay can be rescued by my lover we every day that we take in or we hear stuff from that and we have to we have to hear it or or see it we have to fight with those thoughts of that maybe not maybe some more than others but in this day that we live in we are being rescued by our lover because all around us things to break that relationship are coming down hard what is the world what's the one of the biggest things love not hate that's what the world you know there's a sign i don't know if you've seen it if you go to idaho city it's on the left big billboard says report hate speech and it's by the fbi it's a big deal hate speech no don't hate on on this that's just their interpretation of love and don't speak against it while you look at the natural what is it it's a perversion of what god's doing in the bride a bonding a relationship an intimacy that brings forth the life of christ okay falling in love with christ is the bride's revival amen praise the lord to turn aside god's word is to deny his love remember he's seeking and thirsting and hungering i hope i by god's help will portray this picture of christ longing for you but you say i'm gonna take this man's word you are turning down his love it's not about whether i'm right or brother david's right or our pastor is right that's not what it's about it's not about the quotes that we have to prove our point it's about that love affair that we have with christ and that is where you will find your greatest victory and we'll get to a quote here it's agape love that is where you find your victory in your life your victory in in everything is is is accepting god's word to accept his love but nobody who lives a life according to the message whose doesn't have a love affair with god with christ will it will none of them are going to say oh i don't love the lord no one no one will admit to denying god's love but you watch their life amen you watch their life it's like you talk to somebody and they're not listening you can see it they're just not there when you finish talking they talk about something else they're not listening there's no connection that's how some people are in church with god or in their life every day with god oh they're there they're they're reading but they're not listening they're not they're praying they're making their demands but there's no relationship so they say oh i'm following god i'm following the message listen to a tape while they brush their teeth and do this and do that and it just goes now there's times that's okay right you just put a tape on but if you're not feeding taking in the word where are you going to find a life that lines up with the word of god there's no victory you see when you line up with the word of god you have victory in your life and i'm not talking about just the the the the foundations talking about victory in revelation understanding you know this is not according to god's word so i will step out what are you going to do if if uh let's say for example you were in the church for years and god began to deal with your heart if you don't have a relationship with god strong enough you could be sitting underneath false doctrine and not even know it but as soon because god's not going to let you stay there if you are seen that's the paradox of the whole situation you receive message from god in prayers and through the word and you realize this is off the word that if you have a strong relationship with christ and a love with christ you're going to be able to stand up and take your family uproot your life because it's not about the list of rules it's not about this and this point and this point and these quotes back up this point and this scripture backs up this point what is the point of all of that if you don't if that doesn't produce a love for god you see why the days had to be shortened do you see what what god's doing he's saying look stop it's not about that preacher and what he has to say or that church and and how oh we just appreciate that you know it's just he's the one for me that's not what it's about it's not about sitting in and now you know we have to play the tape and and all that stuff that removes relationship because the devil could care less if you do that every day of your life because there's no victory but a relationship with christ a love affair with christ is what produces that and we don't have to fear see it's not the end of the story we are rescued by my lover you see how could we do it say to god how could we go through this age without the love of our lover christ do you know because love the love of god is in revelation it's a revelation which you could see why the prophet in the beginning said that that's the holy ghost a sign of the holy ghost because that's how important a relationship with christ is the true word fed to the people will bring forth a bride completely in love with her husband jesus christ you don't have to worry about it i don't have to worry about you folks just keep praying just keep preaching the word and god will bring that to pass in all of our lives that's why i say you know and if you have a desire to serve god but you just can't seem to line up just keep coming to church because that word's coming down and finding its place in your life and will produce the true word every single time for the bible says the seed receiving the true word will bring forth a true word bride every single time in um corinthians book of correction 1957 look friend god was so careful don't let it leave you god never got a handful of dust and made an eve she had a different creation on that note what's the big move for women to be independent it's it started back in the days of when brother branham was here but it's just gotten even worse everywhere you look it's all about you know they don't need i don't need no man not to get on that but that's a type spiritually spiritually because guess what whatever god's calling us to do is going to be super contrary to the rest of the world because he doesn't want to make it easy on you but it gives you everything you need it gives you everything you need you know it's like it's like boot camp right a sergeant is not making it easy on you he wants because he knows inside of you you have what it takes he's pulling it out that's why sometimes you got to just roll in the surf roll in the sand you got sand in your ears standing between your armpits and sand in all the worst places and you got to run four miles with a log on your shoulder or something like that you say why lord what's going on well it's just the lord saying look at that didn't i tell you the devil did not tell you but see a true relationship with christ doesn't breed doesn't breed rebellion in your heart that's why people say oh yeah one time i was i believed in god but then i prayed and didn't happen so that's because it was do this you get this do this you get this do this over here this scripture here you do this you get this it was not a relationship but you have to let down the bars in your life to christ to receive that relationship hey look if my wife refused to tell me anything about her would we have relationship i wouldn't be able to know i wouldn't know her who i don't know what's your favorite color i don't know she never tells me she won't talk to me do you think we'd be married no praise the lord so eve so god didn't grab never got a handful of dust and made an eve she had been a different creation and she's not a creation she's a byproduct and god goes over in the heart of adam this rib right under his heart and takes a rib and makes a wife and the very part of adam's spirit was in the woman and they too are one soul body spirit they are one they are perfect oneness now okay a real woman and a real husband a real wife they are one together what is it a type of christ from out of his bosom now let me ask you something how can something from the bosom of christ do anything contrary to the word now i'm not talking about mistakes and things we do you know yell at the wife or yell at the dog slam the door not talking about that because we got a flesh that we gotta deal with we gotta keep under subjection to the word of god talking about it someone without a desire to line up they say no this is how i see it this is no one's going to move me that's what i'm talking about um there how can there be a relationship when they're refusing to accept the word of god or even consider maybe their opinion is wrong that's why when i see something or someone says something maybe i'm wrong lord am i wrong show me forgive me let me line up with your word always press always our prayer line up with the word that's relationship saying to god that's relationship with christ christ from his bosom not a byproduct not a methodist or a baptist or a pentecostal hatchet no serb but out of his own heart he took a sweetheart that's as pure and loyal as she can be she's as loyal as a lily look back there at silence we can come my love let us walk in the pomegranates let us take our fill of love and when the real believer opens his arms with a pure heart and he holds up to christ that that affection of that lover of christ goes into his bosom it's his wife just like the husband does to a real wife a bride pulled from christ's bosom like i said how could she deny even a small portion of the word can't she can't but you see you can show somebody the scripture and they read it and they say oh it means this means a hat there's no relationship so you were predestinated to a relationship with christ that's why you see it so we've been rescued we've been rescued that predestination was your rescue so all this laid forth christ and his bride are inseparable therefore the winds of false doctrine assail he rescues her he comes along with the truth i know there were some things you know i heard when i was a teenager when the whole believe the sign and all that this is just as a testimony i heard a few things did i doubt the word no i knew it was the truth but i was like what are those god in his time answered those questions he rescued me amen amen when the messes of this age first begin to sink into the hearts of believers there was great support you had all these message churches start to pop up and there was some fellowship and support and uh there was a few odd ducks but there was this this supporters pastors and this preacher and great fellowship in these meetings support but by man then they begin to fall or pass away progression of the age suddenly there's no man to stand on there's still a few that people look to to stand on but you see what god's doing he's saying no no no it's not about brother brown no it's not about this preacher or this pastor or this church so he began to strip all that away but now this is the bride as a whole he does that he does that to us as individuals strip everything away if our focus is wrong because to pull all that away and now now the bride begins to set what is it's winnowing time separating of the seed from the shock but god begins to pull that away and says look no none of that me amen me that's what the message is is christ it started god sent a prophet but as god began to bring revelation to the bride she caught exactly what it was about it was christ came that's right christ came down now we can have relationship take please take this right god sent a prophet doesn't bring relationship it's the start of that relationship because rebecca had to find eliza and eliza had to take her to isaac but once that job is done now it's isaac now it's christ now it's falling in love with christ now as as as things you know we refuse to talk to you because you go to that church or all this just garbage that happens politics the real bride of christ needed to find protection and she needed it quick amen so god began to come down and reveal himself the people people begin to lay in the word go look for themselves what it says and god began to reveal himself like he already had set in motion and into the word we went because that's what it's about under the wings of jehovah then psalms 57 those that would swallow me up those that would want to say oh deny this and come to our church because of i don't i don't even know why i'm preaching this thing deny this and come to our church because this is the place to be but that's not what it's about it's about a relationship with christ and this bond between the bride and her lover brought about the great rescue revelation brings the union a visible union of the bride of christ that's what it is it's revelation because you see christ there's a beautiful example in the book of esther we can turn to it esther 4 12 if you want to join me there esther 4 12. then more uh and they told to mordecai esther's words then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews for if thou all together hold us thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this here is esther she she she lost her parents and mordecai took her in then suddenly she's pulled from her life to the kingdom because the king wants a new wife she finds favor with with hagai or harisaya and then she's chosen as queen now it would appear she's arrived she's the queen but haman had a different idea a different plan he didn't know esther was a jew because esther kept that a secret haman had no idea that when he went to talk to the queen the king and connived him into signing this declaration to annihilate the jews that he was inadvertently murdering the king's wife the queen so now mordecai gets wind of what's going on and he's in sackcloth and ashes and esther says sends someone down put some clothes on and tell them to stop mordecai refuses so then she says she said she sends word down to him and and mordecai hears esther's words and then mordecai says do you think you're going to escape you think you're going to be no god's gonna find somebody else to save his people if you don't do it who knows maybe this is your destiny esther's probably sitting there thinking things just calmed down things just smoothed out i'm the queen now you see but god was calling her to a position amen she was the wife of the king amen already this is jesus christ but god was calling her to make a stand she was destined for that position just because you serve god now doesn't mean it's all a flowery bed of ease you are now in a position you are now in a position to stand with the king's word to stand for something so esther perhaps this is what you're created for what you were destined to do so she puts the prayer fasting and praying and she says okay i'll go to the king now here's the paradox in order to go to the king she had to have faith that the king would accept her but what grows your faith in the king is when you go to him and he accepts you so it's a risk if you will in this situation esther had a risk to take and she said if i perish i perish what was the key there total surrender total surrender she was ready to take this relationship to the next level she already was the king's wife you're already the king's wife but god wants you to take it to the next level god wants you to say god's standing there saying look if you'll just step forward in faith i'm your lover and i will rescue you esther stepped into the king's chamber her life was in peril but the king put forth his scepter and in that moment saved her life she touched it he says sweetheart what would you have now first act of faith stepping into his presence unbidden just made him smitten wow she loves me that much she'd risk her life to see me and his acceptance just grew her faith in him you see with every step you take further into a loving relationship with christ increases your faith and then when a haman arises up you say no big deal and you go see the king she says hey i'm gonna have a little supper for you guys a little tea party or whatever i don't know a wine feast or something like that you can if you know it then you know it i can't remember it but um so oh sure and bring havon along sacrifice she lays before him a meal she sacrifices to the king she gives him of her labors she labored in love to create that meal for him you know when we would say he was but she was buttering him up it's just another step of expressing love to god expressing love to our king and she he says okay so what do you have a request for and she says why don't you come again tomorrow and then i will make my request so he comes again the next day but the night before or that night i guess after the first banquet the king couldn't sleep so he calls in the uh the um i don't know who he was but yeah the guy the recorder to to read to him the chronicles of the kingdom in other words you know uh kind of like minutes to a meeting very boring but he couldn't sleep so hey just you know bring that over here listen to it now what i find interesting is you know he couldn't sleep in mordecai and and all that stuff but you see when the bride's in peril do you think the king's sleeping jesus was asleep in the boat but he wasn't he was ready when you're in trouble or when the bride's in peril the king can't sleep that's how much he loves you he wants to make sure everything you have need of is taken care of when you extend your love to him it doesn't say why the king could not sleep but he knew his queen had a request big enough she couldn't just spit it out he was probably in turmoil just wondering what was hindering there what was there when there's a secret or is there something you know you want your wife just tell me what's wrong tell me what's wrong that's where the king use esther okay esther tomorrow he wants to know what's troubling my queen that is the love that our lover has for us so the next day she he goes and and and nester tells her i'm a jew now esther could have said sorry mordecai you know i was a jew by birth but whatever you all can die no i don't think casually king hazard would have chose her if that's who she was that's another sermon um but when she caught a revelation i am a jew esther's revelation of who she was brought her greatest deliverance i'm a jew and i need to go before the king and make a request the revelation of who you are brings about your greatest deliverance before her lover could rescue her she had to have a revelation that he would so she had a revelation of who she is in order to have a revelation that he would rescue her he she had excuse me she needed that revelation to step forward in faith if you know who you are you can step forward in faith in your s is serving god so she says hey haman's plot against our life i'm a jew oh he's in distress he steps outside now let's throw this in there this one's free he comes back in haman is is on top of esther begging for his life and i love this part he the king comes in and says oh now you're going to try to take my wife bind him just to show that god will go to fight for us god will go to all extents he needs to rescue you but you have to step forward in faith into his court and say i need you you have to express that back to him he's seeking thirsting and hungering he wants to be your great protector if you'll just build that relationship with him he is your lover and he desires to rescue you but the man says in marriage and divorce 1965 and that's the way it is with god affiliate love which is human love fellowship love oh excuse me he says that's the way it is with god if a filial love which is human love fellowship love can make a man feel that about his wife what about agape love the greek word meaning the love of god how would that make me do about christ jesus christ i as long as i want to go do it it's in my heart to do it i say as long as it's in my heart to do it i go do it legalism won't let me do it is because that i know not get punished for doing it but the real truth of it is is when the love of god comes into your heart till you want to do it in other words do the right thing that's the truth of it there is two schools not legalism or other or capitalism it's both so in other words it's not i don't not do that thing because i might get in trouble i don't do that because i love god so much i wouldn't want to hurt him that's how he wants you to look at serving him saying to god and that's what i'm trying to say tonight what i believe the lord is trying to say tonight is that he desires to rescue you he wants to be your lover and he wants to rescue you he's not looking to to to for for a relationship where it's just do's and don'ts because because you just that's you know you're gonna get punished or oh you know i did this now god's gonna strike no no because if you serve god that way you will walk away amen because that's not relationship with christ god wants to be your lover and he wants to rescue you so next time you're in need guess what every day we're in need of rescuing we are helpless without him we are completely helpless without him and the day that we live in there are seven women who desire to take hold of one man just to say give us your name. we want to wear our own apparel we want to do our own thing but we want your name in other words no relationship but in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious amen in other words today today they want the man the money the name but they don't want the relationship in the world and in the message ranks they want the name the tape the book but they don't want relationship with god and relationship is what brings your greatest victory but you have to be vulnerable with god so if there's something holding you back from being vulnerable pray that god shows you what's holding you back maybe there's something you just need to forgive someone in your life and say lord i want all the walls to be broken down so that i can have a relationship with you my lover praise the lord magicians want to come tonight praise the lord god wants a relationship with us you know future home of the heavenly bridegroom um invisible union of the bride there's some another one towards the end of brother bannon's ministry that's what you have is christ in the relationship with the bride because that that's what it's all about saying to god that's what it's all about that relationship with god guess what you just that's how you speak the word i i know i my wife and i our relationship i trust her enough i don't tell her you can do this you can she just does it right because she knows my heart and when you know the heart of the savior you can step out and do things in confidence because you know the lord you have a relationship so when god says now this is maybe a little bit silly to some people but yesterday we were at the coffee shop and i just let's buy her coffee turned out she fell back in line and somebody else walked up and i looked at the guys and i was like it's okay whatever [Music] maybe she needed it and i didn't know it but you see don't just brush things away the still small voice not to lift myself up there's still small voice be connected with your lover so when god says do something you hear and you act upon things you don't have to step aside and say you know should i do this should i do this read out your bible and pray no you know because you know god when someone comes to you with a question or someone comes to to to say odd uh or whatever a situation you just the word comes out of your mouth because you have a relationship with christ praise the lord amen this this song came on my heart and i have never seen it before but they've practiced it so hopefully they can make up for the part and i had to put the songs the words in the song thing i'll probably sing the chorus but i will try the verses jesus rescues me [Music] sorry rescue [Applause] [Music] [Music] what's the news for today somebody's heard
