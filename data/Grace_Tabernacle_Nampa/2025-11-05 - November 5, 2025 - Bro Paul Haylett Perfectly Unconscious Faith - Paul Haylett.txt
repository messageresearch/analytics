[music] Amen. And I don't know why I just [music] filled the I was listening to a message today and um prophet was talking about was talking about the quickening power [music] but um talking about a brother he was hunting with a brother brother Donovan I think his name was young Christian another minister's son I believe it was [music] he had cancer on his ear and the prophet asked him said what's that on your ear and [music] mentioned something about it. He said he just reached over and put his hand on him. Didn't say a word. Within 24 hours, I was gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the God I believe in. Amen. Hallelujah. [music] We don't have a lot of prayer requests written down tonight. Um I just have a burden for Liam to catch his knee. Just pray the Lord touch him. Amen. I know there's many others out there needing prayer this evening. Um, Alex and Rachel, I believe, are traveling. Amen. Lord, [music] just be with them. The different ones aren't with us this evening on the road, wherever they may be. Let's just bow our heads this morning or this evening [music] as we take it before the Lord. Gracious heavenly father. Lord, how we love you, Lord Jesus. [music] We help us, Lord God, to get ourselves out of the way, Lord, that [music] we can, Lord, just [music] give you every bit of us, Lord Jesus. Lord, that we [music] can just unreservedly worship you, Lord Jesus, and praise you, Lord. that we can take all these things, Lord, that we've mentioned, the things of this [music] world, the things of this life, the things of the week, the day, the month, whatever it might be, Lord [music] God, and just commit it to you, Lord God. Lord, and just rest in what [music] you've said, Lord. Rest in what your word says, knowing that your word [music] cannot fail. And so, Lord Jesus, as we take these things before you this evening, Lord God, anything within our lives, any uplifted hand tonight, Lord Jesus, [music] Lord, and the ones that we've mentioned, the ones that aren't here, the ones that are traveling, Lord God, [music] my brother Liam, Lord Jesus, Lord, I believe like that Roman centurion, you've already spoke the word, Lord God. And Lord, I recognize the authority in that word, the creator and the author of our faith [music] of this universe, Lord Jesus. And so, Lord, we just commit these things into your hand, believing and knowing that you've already taken care of it, Lord Jesus. And we [music] rest in that tonight, Lord God. So, we come before you. We dedicate this time and this service into your hands, Lord Jesus. How we love you. You're so precious to us, Lord God. So we [music] take this time, Lord God, give it to you. May you find our praise and worship and the speaking of your word tonight. [music] May it be precious unto you, Lord Jesus. May it be pleasing unto you, Lord God. We [music] pray. We love you, Lord Jesus. May every heart just be [music] focused upon you tonight, Lord God. We pray. We love you. We dedicate this time of service into your hands. [music] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. [snorts] Let's sing number 84. [music] Jesus name above all names. [snorts] Jesus [music] name above all name. Beautiful [music and singing] Savior. Glorious [singing and music] Lord of Lord. Emmanuel, [singing and music] God is with us. The blessed [music] redeemer, [singing] living [music] [singing] word. Jesus, [music] name above all name. Beautiful Savior. [singing] Glory [music] is Lord of lord Emmanuel.

Blessed redeemer, [music] living [singing] word. [music] Hallelujah. Amen. [music] Man, as we change the order of the service tonight, I just want to sing that little chorus. I love him because he first loved me. [snorts] I love him. I love him because he first loved [singing] me. and purchased my salation [singing] on Calvary tree. Let's just stand sing it to him again. I love him. I love him because [music and singing] he first loved me and purchased [music and singing] my salvation. on Cal tree. I love him. I love [singing] him. because he [singing] first love me [music] and purchase my sound. tree. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to have the knowledge, the understanding that [music] the purchase price has been paid? Amen. To be able to stand here today [music] with such a complete confidence of what the Lord has already done. And uh [music] we just thank the Lord for that. Amen. and uh [music] how that he just you know speaks to us as we had [music] quite a busy week, the start of the week I should say and but such that it gave me time [music] to just focus, put the earphones on and just listen to the prophet and my it was just amazing little nuggets. [music] I I just I think you know you're you're busy. I was driving a piece of equipment, but you know, just [music] you just stop the the the audio and scroll it backwards and take a screenshot. And I I just [music] took it seemed like all day I was taking picture picture because it was just so profound. And I just thank the Lord for that. Amen. That that this is a living word. We're not sitting here in a dead letter uh saying, "Oh, yes, we're repeating. We're repeating." But it's [snorts] a living word coming out right now. And I think in my own humble, my dad said, "If you say you're humble, you're not." But in my own humble opinion, uh, it's more real &gt;&gt; to us today than it was 10, 15, 20 years ago. Amen. [music] It's more alive. You know, we're looking for the coming of the Lord each and every day. But I'll just be honest with you. If the Lord had come 20 years ago, I wouldn't have made a rapture. I wouldn't have been prepared. And I I don't know, not to be, but maybe obviously we're still not quite [music] there or the Lord would be coming. Many of you may be, but maybe it's your pastor. Remember, you know, the prophet said it it it doesn't mean the pastor is going. He might be the one reminds me of a little story once where a man said, "Now, you know, pastor, I just bought a new car and here's the spare keys to it." And the pastor said, "Why?" And he says, "Well, [music] when I go in the rapture, you might need this car." And so, you know, sometimes that's just the way it is. You cannot [music] predict. You can't look at the outside and say, I want to talk to you tonight. I hope you don't mind. Just kind of a homegrown night tonight. Amen. Thank you, musicians. God bless you. It's beautiful. Amen. I just want to u uh this comes out of the message. We'll touch on that uh when we come to the quote here, but a perfectly unconscious faith. And uh I I just thought it was such interesting wording, amen, that the prophet uses and and how it just speaks out. And I don't know about you, but there's been times in my life I was like, Lord, I need more faith. I need more faith. I need more faith. And yet, Brother Brandham kind of paints a little different picture concerning our faith. Amen. Now, it might seem as though the scripture is not necessarily related. Psalms 89 1-7. But to me, the Lord spoke to me as I saw this scripture and I just felt like it really fit in uh so so beautifully. Amen. Um Amen. Psalms 89 and one. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. Now remember only the bride. Amen. really has that position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's going to be there. So even though this was the Psalmist David, Amen. He's really speaking of the bride of Christ because he's talking about forever. Amen. He's not talking about for a space of time while there's breath in this body. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. For I have said, mercy shall be built up forever. Thy faithfulness shalt thou established in the very heavens. I have made a covenant with my chosen. I have sworn unto David, my servant. Thy seed will I establish forever. Do we believe tonight we're that seed? Amen. [snorts] And built up thy throne to all generations, Silah. And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, oh Lord, thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. Amen. I believe tonight we could also say he is faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that that's our heart? We know he is faithful. Amen. For who in heaven can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord? God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him. Heavenly Father, we just ask you to come tonight, Lord. There are many here uh that were not able to be here tonight. We just ask you to be with them. Those on the road, those traveling, Lord, uh Brother Vicilei, Brother Sergey, out on the road, Lord, working uh each and every circumstance. Father, uh we would just ask you to come and and just speak to each heart tonight, Lord, and [snorts] just bless them. Draw them closer to you, Father. For Lord, the circumstances of this life, Father, would be such that they would try to hinder. Satan would try to hinder us from being in the house of God. But Lord, [snorts] we are here tonight. Few, maybe in number, but Lord, we are here, I believe, in great faith tonight. So we ask [snorts] you to speak to hearts, Lord, and lead us and guide us in truth in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. You know, as we'll look at this, I I just love this scripture that he's made a covenant with his chosen. And um [snorts] I I believe that as that applies to you and I tonight, amen. The word of God is never had a beginning, never had an ending. So we don't put it for a certain generation. as many today. You know, I found it remarkable. I'd come across a deal where a man was emphasizing what he believed and said, you know, those things were for a different day. They're the Old Testament. And then he went on to testify what's wrong with America is they forsaken the Ten Commandments. And I thought, you know, there it is, the confusion, right? That they're there. That's no longer important. But you're in this condition because you've forsaken the no longer important things. Now, it just shows the confusion that's in their world, right? Where they they're not getting that settled. But I'll tell you, from the very first word of Genesis to the very last word of Revelation, the bride of Jesus Christ says amen to that. Amen. It's so real to her that she's not here to exclude anything. She's asking for revelation to understand it all. Amen. And so, you know, I just want to speak to you on that thought of perfectly unconscious faith. And [snorts] you know, part of the thing that uh we're here to to do now, this is like three sermons the prophet preached all kind of mixed together. But uh one of our challenges today is to overcome the realm of unbelief. And and we understand my brother and sister that uh unbelief is such an interesting thing because it it can creep back into our life so easily. little things, little comments, little whatever, you know, and and it's there that Satan wants to emphasize the negative in our life. And and what God wants us to do is simply completely believe the word. And even though circumstance and everything around us testifies differently, imagine you're Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and they're walking you up the plank into the fire. And the men that are taking you there are collapsing from the heat and dying. And yet it's as though you were beckoned. Come on, my brother and sister. The scripture shows us those men, those great men, the great warriors of that kingdom never made it to the lip of the furnace. They collapsed from the heat. And Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, as though they were being wooed, kept right on walking into the fire. Now, we don't know it because the word don't really tell it to us, but I believe when they got up close to that, they saw their Lord Jesus Christ in there. Amen. And they were walking to him, not going to a fatalistic approach. Oh my, I guess I'm going to die in this fire. But they saw him. And when they saw him, they saw life. Now remember, my brother and sister, the Holy Spirit is a fire, a purifying fire. And when they saw that, they weren't seeing a fire that was going to destroy them. They saw a fire that was going to redeem them and cleanse them and purify them. And they walked right in there. And they walked right out of there. my brother and sister. You see, so sometimes unbelief takes certain forms. And if we're looking to, you might say a negative thing. Amen. Now, we're supposed to rejoice when we come into fiery trials. Amen. Do you rejoice? I want to know. Let's be honest, my brother and sister. Do we really enjoy rejoice when we come into fiery trials? Amen. I'm glad somebody could say amen because I tell you what, I don't. Yes, Sister Ruth, you're right. It depends on what day of the week and what that fiery trial is. Come on. Sometimes it's good to be honest with ourselves. But you see, the word is looking at us saying, "I have a goal in mind." And while this is a fiery trial, I've already declared you're going to walk right through it. It's not going to consume you. It's not going to destroy you. It's going to purify you and you're going to come out pure like gold. Amen. And so, we got to come. one of the things of the restored word. Now, critics would say, well, the message of the hour is not really restoring the word. It's always been there. But my brother and sister, what it's doing is restoring our faith in the word back to the faith of our fathers. Amen. So, it's there that we don't have to have a new message. You just need a message that's set in the right order, set the right priority, set to the right uh uh uh need of the age. So, it's what we're doing overcoming unbelief. Amen. Now, my brother and sister, I I like how brother Brandham put this. The smoking, the drinking, the dancing, all that. That's not unbelief. Those are the attributes of unbelief. So, what we're here is to overcome this realm of unbelief, which is the realm is an atmosphere that is around. So, a realm there, my brother and sister, is not just a singular thing at a certain time or place, but it's an atmosphere. Look at the world we're living in. Amen. Look at everything around it is an atmosphere that's opposed to God, opposed to his word, trying to show that God is not really God. But my brother and sister, there's a people on the earth today. You and I, I'm going to be just boastful tonight and say that you and I are on the earth to testify that God is real. He's alive. He's powerful. And his word has come like a two-edged sword and is cutting unbelief away from you and I. Amen. And God doesn't cut too deep. Sometimes we go, "Oh, I feel so I feel so hurt by this situation." But I want you to know God is so perfect. He never cuts too deep. So if he cuts you there in a certain way, it's because it needed to cut. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what are we doing? Unbelief keeps us from stepping through the veil. To take away unbelief is us stepping beyond the veil of flesh. So look at that process that comes. Brother Brandham says that uh when when Jesus was on the cross and the veil was rent that if the Jews had had the proper approach, they would have looked at the veil that was rent and looked beyond the veil and they would have saw Jesus Christ the redeemer on the mercy seat. But all they could look at is everything they believed had been now just shook up. They didn't understand what was going on cuz this man, this man, this man, that's how they saw him. just this man and look how the same spirit today just this man that they don't see what God's doing but God was bringing the mercy seat into plain view. Aren't you glad tonight he brought the mercy seat in plain view of you and I that we can look at that and realize I also heard the prophet this week say there is nothing you can do your name and the lamb's book of life there's nothing you can do that will remove your name from the lamb's book of life now just the book of life people can change their mind they can do things they can reject that and the name can be taken from that book but we're talking to the bride tonight amen and the bride is there God chose her. And it's not that we're going to go out and willfully go against the word, but sometimes Satan will trick us and things will happen. But Satan says, "Oh, you went too far." And God says, "You can't go far enough to get away from me." Amen. [snorts] Thank you, Lord. So, I've been in the last while, I've spoken many times on the action, you know, the certain things in the scriptures. Acts 2:38, repent is an action. And um but you know as I was studying this thought I want to bring a little balance into that. Uh I've spoken many times on the action we need to take to move forward. And I just really felt to to clarify some of these things that I was listening to and thinking and studying and uh you know I I felt like we needed to clarify it just a little bit or bring a little broader view. Now one of the things that we do need to do is take action on the word that we hear. &gt;&gt; So we don't want to be hearers only. We want to be doers. Right? So as we become hearers and doers of the word of God, there is actually an action that takes place that is not of works. We're not sitting there saying, "Well, if I say amen and I go out and attempt to fulfill this, then I'm satisfying the word." But it's something in us that the word is stimulating. [snorts] Amen. where an amen shouldn't be just a habit of some reaction in church that we don't really know what we said amen to but it should be a reaction to the word that has come and stimulated us. Amen. So you know it's there that that stimulation uh now there's no action that we can take there's nothing that we can actually do that changes our eternal destination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "But but I chose to be baptized." You were called &gt;&gt; into baptism. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You say, "I I did this." No. Nope. The word says, "You never come to God. God came to you." So, he's pulling us, wooing us to himself. And many times this anointing, now let me just clarify a little bit how anointings can be. They seem to be can be so real that we would almost like testify in a court of law under some kind of oath that this was this and this is but that anointing could actually be from the pits of hell like religious spirit right brother Brown told us one of the strongest spirits there religious spirit and we would say God told me but it contrary to the word &gt;&gt; see so there's where our balance comes It isn't because a voice spoke to you in the middle of the night, but it's there that the voice has already told you, take it back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when that voice speaks to you and it lines up to the word of God, we need to take heed to that. So faith is this is not of our merit. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. Let's just for a moment sit right down. Put our guard down. Put our guard down. If it was on our merit, where would we be tonight? lost. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad it's not our merit? Now, can someone say, "Thank you, Lord. It's not my merit. It's not what I have done &gt;&gt; or what I did not to do." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And faith, we recognize by looking through the word, can never be man-made. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It's interesting how it is. You know, some people are born with an ability. I saw a little video clip of a person jumping off a cliff. It was like 122 feet to the water. I don't know there's anybody here that's thinks in that realm. I mean, I'm sorry. It just takes another class of people to just run and leap off of a cliff like that, do two or three somersaults and in the water. And I'm like, and then it'd be call 911. &gt;&gt; He doesn't appear to be moving. &gt;&gt; But you see, my brother and sister, you would look at that and if we're not careful, we'd say, man, they just have this this confidence. They have this this something in them. They can do this. But if we're not careful, we mistake that in the in the spiritual world &gt;&gt; as faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely right. &gt;&gt; And it's not faith. It's a man-made, it's a natural born in them ability, but it's not faith. Where brother Brown says that you can be anointed of the Holy Spirit on this flesh all the days of your life and go to hell. And I, you know, I I think many a person uh maybe I'm sound like I'm assuming, but many a person would say, I just don't see how that could be. But look at this, my brother and sister, when it's really anchored on more of a man-made platform that that God is true. I read it in the word and it's all there. But it's not down in the soul that when the fiery trial would come, they could still stand and say the same thing that that God is true. I'm dying of cancer, but God is true. He's real. I've got this situation. I've been burnt. Amen. I seen a video clip a while back, a man hideously burnt. Amen. And and it's there that they're saying, "You're so lucky to be alive." And the man, you know, how scar tissue is and that stuff. And the man says, "I didn't die because God didn't give him permission." &gt;&gt; Now, there's some kind of revelation that the only reason I'm living is not because I'm lucky. It's because God never gave him permission to take my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we look at that. I don't believe that come from education. I believe there's an experience that was there. That man went through truly a fiery trial and he come out of it still believing that God's in control. Amen. So faith can never be man-made. Real faith can't be man-made. It only comes, as the scripture says, faith cometh by. &gt;&gt; There it goes. It all comes back to the word. &gt;&gt; The only way we're going to have faith is to be anchored in the word. Because if we're outside of the word, there's no other recipe to bring faith into the heart and life of a believer. Amen. [snorts] So it comes by the word. So here again, let me say this. Not by hearing only, but by being a doer of the word. Faith is implemented in us. Amen. Now, [snorts] there's times that really stimulate your faith, my brother and sister. I have seen things happen at different times and places through the years. Amen. I've seen it in such a fashion that you believe what you have done. Now, this I don't mean to focus this on me, but I'll just use myself for an example. I I've preached in more than one place and I felt like the sermon was an absolute failure. I felt like I stumbled all over myself and didn't really convey it like I wanted to. And then watch people flood to the altar and give their heart to the Lord or repent or be healed and you realize, okay, God's not only dealing with them, he's also dealing behind the desk. &gt;&gt; Amen. To show it's not how good you can preach. It's not how good you can present it, but it's whether my word is anointed and whether you give the word liberty to go out amongst the people and the people give the word liberty to come into them. And when that happens, you see the supernatural take place. It really all comes about no matter which side of the desk you're on. People giving liberty to the Holy Spirit to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. So no longer, oh, I can receive. You hear it, my brother and sister. I'm not being critical, but you hear it and people say, "I I don't really receive from this brother when he preaches." Well, you've got a preconceived uh opinion or preconceived notion that what that brother preaches, maybe it's because it hurts and you just won't admit that it's cutting a little deep. But remember what I said, the Holy Spirit cannot cut too deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's there that as God's moving, we have to give the Lord when we come in the house of God complete liberty. Lord, do as you would with me tonight. Amen. And not hold back. So, as we'll look at that, uh, Brother Brandham says here in Melchzdc, the great prince and king. Amen. Um, so as we'll look at this, and the covenant was given to Abraham unconditionally. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you tonight, do we have an unconditional promise or not? Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we believe it's conditional, you'll never find yourself satisfied that you have met the condition. &gt;&gt; It's not in us unless got a religious spirit, right? That says, "Oh, we're perfect before God." Amen. So, let me throw this in. I've been just kind of pondering on this. We all understand what it is to live vicariously through someone else. So, you find the root word of vicarious is vicar. And so the pope comes and says, "God's living through me." Well, that's true if he's Holy Ghost fil. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Because each one of us tonight, Brother Trevor, Sister Carrie, Sister Sue, we could go on through all those. You could not tonight stand up and say, "I'm a vicor of Christ." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's living vicariously through me. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't allow us to go out and claim that everything we say is some perfect thing and everything we do is some perfect thing. You see, it's the life. It's a misrepresentation of the life that's supposed to be present in a Holy Ghost-filled believer. Amen. Now, Satan just took that and people want to be told what to do. You know, this is the truth, my brother and sister. People, many people are in church, they need someone big in their life. They need someone to tell them where to go, what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and and they won't acknowledge that. You ask them that and they'll deny it. But you just look about how they view church, how they look at pastors or whatever it is, and you realize they're looking for someone to lead them &gt;&gt; without realizing that it's supposed to be Christ. &gt;&gt; They're they're putting a man into the position and they're asking the man to lead and saying, "Well, maybe God's leading through him." But see, Brother Brandham, this is one thing I love about his ministry. He said, "I've never called you to myself." I'm not won't have these words perfect. Forgive me. But I never called you to myself, [snorts] but I came to introduce you to Jesus Christ. Imagine, Brother Trevor, Sister Carrie, that as you guys were getting to know each other that every time you'd be like, uh, I I would like to talk to Carrie, so I'll call Paul. You know, I want to talk to the Lord, so I got to call the preacher. No, that's not what it's about. It's a personal relationship that brings us into a place and [snorts] and so he says,"Abraham, uh, if you will do something, I'll do this." See, but that it was not the way God was doing. He told them, "Look, I've already done it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we say amen tonight? I've already done it. Amen. So, what you need to do isn't that what we do is what he has done for us. Nothing we could do to merit anything. What could we, the unrighteous ones, ever do anything to merit something before the great Jehovah God and his supremeo great supreme holiness? &gt;&gt; But look at this. This unconditional promise is [snorts] in the gap for you and I. &gt;&gt; So God doesn't look at us and say, "They didn't meet it. Oh, I guess the deal is off." He says, "I made an unconditional promise to them." And so it's not what we have done. And it's not as we've lived perfect. I said it at communion. It's not we're here not here at communion because we are perfect. We are here because God revealed to us that this is part and we are communing with him. We're sharing with him uh what our life is and what our desire is and what our heart is speaking. And God looks down and says it's by the blood, the body and the blood that I cleanse you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So not not how good our attendance is, how much we gave to the church or anything like that. See, the only thing we can do is accept and be grateful for what he's already done for us. &gt;&gt; It's so simple, &gt;&gt; isn't it? [snorts] &gt;&gt; And I'm positive that many times in people's thinking that they try to make divine healing and so forth, some great outreaching. &gt;&gt; That's right. I've got to reach out there something way away. If I could only reach faith. &gt;&gt; But I like how the prophet of God come and he says, you know, everything you need, paraphrasing, not perfect words, but everything you need for the rapture is already &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; My, my brother and sister, every bit of faith that we need is already in us. And so we need to quit reaching because what we're doing is taking what God meant to be so simple and receive and we're complicating it. We're adding this and adding that and it's because we as human nature cannot just accept the simple redemptive blood of Jesus Christ. We've got to work for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to make emphasis on that. It's so simple, &gt;&gt; isn't it? Amen. We ought to be able to say amen to that and believe that that it is so simple. Now, is it possible you think that we try to make faith happen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I think it's a very real reality to many people. They're trying to make faith happen. &gt;&gt; They're trying to produce it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And intellectually, we we want it faith so bad. We we want it to happen so bad. So, Brother Brandham tells this and and uh it's um oh my yes in uh faith is a substance. Brother Brandham uh says this here in faith is a substance. He's talking about how this not exact words here again, but how that someone comes off the street and they receive their healing while a godly sister doesn't. Now, how can that be? This person from the street, how could they receive their healing and a godly sister not? because this person from the street comes and says, "He said it, I believe it, and it's settled." &gt;&gt; And the believer is like, "I've been living a good life. I've been faithful in church. I read my Bible. I pray, I this, I that I'm doing." And and and uh Lord, I hope that I'm actually worthy to receive this. And the person, we won't say necessarily they're a gross sinner, but they're just off the street and they're just coming in there and saying, "God said it. I just believe this." Amen. God heals him and the other one's trying to work their way to it. They're trying to come and approach it and what am I missing? And you know what happens when they don't receive their healing? They go back and they try even harder. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, they're not coming to a place that they simply say, you know, he said it. I believe it. It's settled. &gt;&gt; But when it doesn't happen, they try it harder. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, reminds me of an individual I know, young man, and he was taking whatever those tests are when you're in high school, going on to college and and uh he flunks it. He had studied literally every day for hours coming up to this test and he flunks it and he got so discouraged. So then he just doubled down and he studied it twice as much and he goes back for a second try and he flunks it again. Well, I say flunk. You know, there's certain levels, you know, you you reach in your accomplishment. And they gave him one more chance and they said, "You have to wait a certain period of time." And he thought, "I don't understand. I've I've studied everything. I've done all that I could do." &gt;&gt; And he come from a Christian home. and his parents rallied around him the morning of his next test. Not before, but just the morning of this next test. And they prayed, "Lord, thy will be done." He walks in there thinking, "Well, I haven't learned any more than I already knew, and I didn't pass then, but I'm still going to give my all." And they come back later and said, "We can't believe after failing it twice that you had such a good score." And what it testifies in this little story is he went from his ability &gt;&gt; to trusting God. And that changed the whole picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's there that in our own ability, we're sure we can do it by our own studies, by our own efforts, by our own thing. But you see, that won't get you healed, the prophet's telling us. And it won't get you past a test. God wants sons and daughters of God to trust him and him alone, not their own ability. [snorts] Amen. So, you know, we wonder what's wrong with us and then we try even harder. Now, in the sermon, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. This was preached just a few days later. Uh and uh brother Brandham says this. Then God comes down in anointing of another gift. And he will know things and foreshow things and tell things that was and what will be. What's that to do? Does that heal you? No. My my brother and sister, you can have prophecy in the church. You can have the gifts moving powerfully in the church. That won't heal you. &gt;&gt; It brings your faith up to Christ who has already healed you. &gt;&gt; So, it's not what we have to say, oh, I'm going to bring myself or, you know, I can do with this and get healing. No. What God's doing is building us up to get us up to this level that our healing is at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, uh forgive me for putting in this silly little story, but Sister Jerry and I on a trip one time and and uh we punch in the button for the ground floor and it goes down a floor and stops and open doors and and the woman walks on. The lady walks on and um then it pushes the button and it goes down to the next floor and um the door opens. She just walks out, turns the corner and all there is there is an ice machine and she just looks at it dumbfounded like there's supposed to be a lobby here. Now my brother and sister, if we're not careful, we believe we're going to the right place to step out into a realm of faith, but we're finding ourselves stepping out into a different set of circumstance, a different realm, and it it's not there. But if we'll let the Lord be in control and we will give him preeminence in our life, he we don't have to be a rocket scientist. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be intellectually, spiritually intellectual. We can just say, you know what God said? &gt;&gt; said said he would give me a sound mind. I don't know about you guys, but I'll tell you sometimes the devil just beats on my brain so hard. I I want to say that it's just life making my brain mush. But I know it's the devil beating on me, turning my brain to mush where I can't hardly make a decision. But whenever I stop and say, "Lord, you promised me a sound mind." Then I can make a decision. Amen. Because Satan's going to use every tool there is on this earth against us. And if we're not careful, we'll think that because we know the message, we've read our Bible, that that's faith. That faith is that unhindered trust in God's word. &gt;&gt; No hindrance at all. We are simply trusting. Amen. So, uh, it brings your faith up to Jesus Christ who has already healed you. That's it. When you believe it and go away saying, "Praise the Lord, I'm healed. So, here's some action." See, this is why I felt really compelled to to bring a balance to me saying the action thing because action's not works, &gt;&gt; but it is responding to the word. So, Brother Bram saying right here, see, uh, it brings your faith up to Jesus Christ who's already healed you. Then you believe it and you go away and an action takes place. Praise the Lord, I'm healed. Now Jesus crossing in the boat quickly now just a few minutes crossing the sea. I can just imagine how that was. He preached all day and that night a big storm come up on the sea and like to have sunk the little boat. Weary and tired but never afraid. I like that Jesus didn't have to go out and fast all day and pray all day then say, "Now I wonder if I've got faith enough to do this." &gt;&gt; That's right. H [snorts] he was unconscious of the faith that he had. Any men or women that make you real warriors in the kingdom of God is p perfectly unconscious to their faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah I think I'll just be a prayer warrior today. No sir, you are a prayer warrior because you are praying the prayer of faith anointed from the Holy Ghost in you and you're just praying your heart to the Lord and you don't give up at the first knee ache or the first back ache or the first whatever. Amen. You always thought, am I the only one on earth that when you go to pray your phone starts ringing? Amen. I was talking to different brothers and they're like, nope, same thing happens. I said, how do you deal with that? He said, I leave my phone on silent in the other end of the house. Amen. And I don't even want to hear it go because I'm human and I want to know what's making it go. &gt;&gt; Put it in the other end of the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz Satan's going to cause every salesman and every whatever in the world to call you to distract you from praying. [snorts] Amen. So it's there. Now I wonder if I've got faith enough. Jesus didn't go out and fast all day and pray all day and then say, "Now, I wonder if I got faith enough to do this." He was unconscious of the faith he had. Any men or women that ever make real warriors in the kingdom of God is perfectly unconscious to their faith. You keep trying to test your faith. Wonder if I've got faith enough to do this. How many times have we seen and witnessed people getting prayed for and they come to the minister and say, "I want you to pray for me that your faith." &gt;&gt; Well, there's some grounds to that. Brother Bram said, "We bind our faith together." But imagine what that will be if you have powerful faith and powerful faith. Let me liken it to you this way. If you are trying to put battery charger or cables, jumper cables on [snorts] a machine that takes four batteries to start and you're trying to charge it with a machine that has one little battery and you leave it on there for an hour or two. your pickup is idling and you go out in an hour or two, the battery is no longer dead, but all it does is go click, click, click. You see, it takes more power. Adding one battery to something that's dead doesn't energize it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Silly analogy, but are you with me? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what happens is when we come in this, we should never come. Brother Brandham says it's a devil's language. We should never come and say, "I just don't have any faith." What we need to do is say, "Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief and let me take a hold of this because you said it, Lord. It's not what I said that's going to heal me. It's going to deliver me." It's what you said and I believe it with every bit of the fiber within me. I know it's the truth. Amen. We don't we go up there and say, "You know what? I'm a weak battery. Can I draw off of your battery and somehow make my battery strong again?" It won't work. It won't work. God wants you to come and say, "You know what? I've got the power to overcome every spirit, every circumstance, every fiery trial, every stumbling block, every railroad tie throat in my way, every pothole in the road of life. I can overcome this because I am the bride of Jesus Christ." When we come like that, God's got something he can come. And then he takes his word. If you don't mind me just bringing this in a natural level. Amen. He just takes his word and he goes over there if you guys don't mind. I'm not picking on nobody, but he pulls that out and he's got the jumper cables of the word and then he clicks them on there. Amen. And when the jumper cable of the word is already tied to the fact that you know you are the bride of Jesus Christ, you know the word is true. You know the Holy Spirit is moving and boom, things happen and we can say, "Oh, oh, brother so and so, such a powerful preacher." No, my brother and sister, it was your faith that received the charge from the Holy Ghost. It was your faith that received that and let that in. Amen. And then God makes it happen. If we're not careful, though, we look to a man and say, "It's this brother's ministry that did this. He was preaching when they were healed. He was preaching when this was delivered. He was preaching when this." My brother and sister, you might have confidence because that man is a man of God. But it takes something on your side because you have a dead failed battery. It don't matter how much charge you put to it, it won't start. &gt;&gt; It won't work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know why I think about this, but remember on the highway that time, yeah, maybe I caught your thought. Amen. On the highway out there and those batteries, for whatever reason, just decided we've done all we're doing in life. Amen. And and we're just done. And and you couldn't do anything to put any juice in there. But I tell you, by God's grace, there was some other batteries there and it was there and made it home. I think your alternator died or something like that, right? So, you look at that. See, it it just doesn't matter, my brother and sister. There has to be something there to receive the charge. Something has to be there to receive it. Amen. Now, it's there. See, you don't go fast and pray. Jesus was unconscious of that. He says, "You keep trying to test your faith. Wonder if I got faith enough to do this. Have I got faith?" Don't test your faith. God said it. God said so. Do it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's a realm that each one of us has to face. Amen. He said, "I'm healed." &gt;&gt; I don't need to go get some affirmation from a preacher somewhere that I'm healed. God said I'm healed. Amen. I don't need somebody to pat me on the back and say, "You're healed. God said I'm healed." Amen. And when we take that approach, it'll change our approach to God and change our approach to the word being preached because all we're doing is hearing words of affirmation. It is not words that we have to draw all the energy out of to receive a promise. the promise been made. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, look at this. Uh because God said so. Now, I like this part. I hope you guys don't mind. I just enjoyed studying this. Have you ever tested your faith whether you had enough faith to come to the meeting or not tonight? Is there anyone here that sat down in the house tonight and said, "I just hope I just hope I have enough faith to get out of this chair, walk out to the car. Will the car even start? What if we go to church and nobody's there?" No. No. That's why the house of God should be open. The lights should be on. Amen. Anything but the worst of weather, etc. But test you had enough faith to eat your supper tonight. Did you need to pray through? Now, Sister Ruth, I'm sorry. I don't mean to embarrass you, but see, there's a certain degree. There's a time of trial, fiery trial when it comes that it is a test &gt;&gt; to eat your food. &gt;&gt; But you don't go on living that way because God came on the scene and said, "I have faith. I believe he healed me." &gt;&gt; And so by believing he healed you, Amen. then it come down. You didn't have to go and pray through to whether you could eat or not &gt;&gt; because the word already said, "I healed you." And that healing fixed this problem. And that's the way our life is, my brother and sister. Relationships, friendships, fellowship with God. When we'll get back to the basic and let God fix the basic things in our life, then all this other stuff just starts falling in place and we don't have to pray through. Oh, should I be friends with anybody at church? I better pray through. Should I really go to the household of faith? Should I go and join myself together? No. The word says, &gt;&gt; and so when we have that right approach, see if you had enough faith to eat your supper tonight. Have you tested? Do you think you'll have to fast a while and test your faith to see if you got enough faith to drive your car home? Certainly not. It's just automatically you believe it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look at that, my brother and sister. It's there. Think about how often in that more natural sense that we have faith. I tell you, if you drive a vehicle that you have to pray through before you put the key in the ignition and twisted, it might be time to save up money for a different car. Amen. [snorts] But it's there. Look how simple we are. We're stunned when the car won't start. We don't, you know, unless there's problems leading up to this, my brother and sister, right? A Christian on a starvation diet is not stunned when God doesn't answer prayers because they never expected him to. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But when you are a Holy Ghost fililled, full of the word and you go into the word and you come in the presence of God. Amen. We have full expectation. God said it. I believe it's going to come to pass. Amen. Now, look, I tell you, I'll just put this as a type and move on. when you leave something sitting long enough. We have a truck that we went to use it here month or so ago and it's it's dead. We tried charging the batteries. They're no good. We looked at the batteries. The batteries are not really that old. The truck hasn't been driven that much. [snorts] But why did it die? From lack of use. That's &gt;&gt; right. And many a believer, many a Christian's faith has died from what? &gt;&gt; Lack of use. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown talked about faith is a muscle. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we all know what it would be like if we just lay around, lay around, lay around. Amen. You know, I tell you that's what you know, it comes to the point they say, "Well, I used to be able to run, but I haven't ran in years. Now I can't even walk to the mailbox. I don't understand." And our faith muscle is the same way. We say, "Well, I used to have faith to believe. I used to have Why have you been exercising it?" &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; No, I haven't. &gt;&gt; Well, what what do we expect? &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Hey, as real believers, the prophet of God laid it down to us that we should say amen to every word of God. Now, I'm I'm going to just I hope this doesn't seem too pushy, but uh I'm telling you, if you're not saying amen, you are not exercising the faith that's in you. Now, some people say, "Well, I'm just a quiet kind of a person." But amen. The prophet of God said, a real believer says amen to every word of God. And you might say, "Well, I said it in my heart." Well, try saying it out loud. Amen. I think that even helps more. It helps inspire us. I've shared with you how that there was a time in my life I was embarrassed and all of these things and and such a contradiction in my life and I finally had to come when I was by myself and it'd be like, "Go ahead and say it, Paul." &gt;&gt; Amen. But I get in public, I wouldn't say it out loud, you know? I was, "Amen." But then I finally was like, "You're a coward, Paul. God be ashamed of you. And I started exercising that. I know this sounds real carnal, but I started exercising that until it become natural. If I agree with what the preacher is saying, and even if I don't agree with what the preacher is saying, if it's the word, &gt;&gt; oh, you guys have been there. You know what I'm talking about. It can be the word and we still don't necessarily agree with it, [snorts] you know, because that cut deep. But remember, God won't cut you any deeper than what he intended to. H. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My. &gt;&gt; So, where does this come from? From the inner man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it is enforced. Brother Paul's going to look out in the congregation. If I don't say amen, he's going to judge me. No, you don't forget about that. &gt;&gt; Paul Paul does nothing with your with your destination, with your life. Amen. It needs to come automatically, unconsciously from the inner man. Amen. And that's the way our faith is growing. unconscious. We don't go to church and say, "I'm going to add another cubic to the stature of my faith today, but it just comes unconscious that the word of God stimulates us and we say, "That is the truth, and I'm going to rise up to that level." We say it within ourselves, Lord, raise me to that level, Lord. Then I can be used by you. I can be a real servant to you in whatever fashion you call me. Now my brother and sister, this is not that you have to translate every word of man, every word the preacher says. Because one preacher will say something a certain way and the other preacher looks like he's contradicting because he says it a different way. But when we dig to the bottom of it, what did God say to you? Amen. It's not going to be what the preacher said to you. It's what God says to you that makes the difference. Amen. So every faithful minister [snorts] sh would or should preach exactly what the word says. And God help us as a church, right? Not not just because brother Paul chose to or what, but God help us that we'd have wisdom to choose the right men to preach the word to us and affect our families that the word coming that we could. Now this will sound rough. Many tape only people say well we want only the tapes because then we can trust every word that we hear. But why this sounds rough are there so many hearers and so few doers? &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. If it was only about the pure word, only the unadulterated that we can trust this because why? Go back. Brother Bram says our absolute is the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together. We'll push that off the side because brother Brown said now you'll hear on this tape someday. Oh yeah, that's what we're holding to. But he told you to find a Holy Ghost fil church. &gt;&gt; Go to it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; And the word says not to forsake the assembling of yourselves together. That's not necessary. We have the pure word in our home now. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. That's fine. That's fine. But you see, that's not what was said. &gt;&gt; And so, we have to be really careful that [snorts] we don't look for it to be expressed in the way we want because otherwise that preacher, that preacher, that preacher, that nope, there's no good preachers. I know that's a little direct. &gt;&gt; But now look at this. I just listening to brother Brown speak and it it just touched me. By revelation, &gt;&gt; the word in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Responds to the word coming to you. &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful? I'll tell you what. It's Christ the word in you that is reaching out and receiving Christ the word coming to you. Amen. And there's the coming of Christ in our day. &gt;&gt; He come through his word to those that have the word in them. Amen. So we're looking as it is a literal coming of Christ. But the prophet of God told us already in the seventh seal, he is here. &gt;&gt; That's right. And so the word has to be receiving the word coming to it. And when we receive the word coming to us, then there is a joining together. And we can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Now look, this fire of the Holy God, amen, is coming to you to put faith in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, that's what the moving of the Holy Spirit is. It's not just so we get sensations and shivers. [snorts] Amen. So the Holy God, I worded it that way on purpose because that's what he is. Amen. A holy God. And he's coming down and the word says he rightly divided himself into many licks of fire among the saints. And so he's coming down to you and I and coming into us and it's coming and he's putting faith in it. If the Holy Spirit's not there, my brother and sister, you're not going to have faith because faith comes by hearing the word. But we can't even call Jesus the Christ without the Holy Ghost. And so when we come and the fire of God comes down upon us, licks a fire moving, revelation moving on us, what is he doing? He's pouring faith into you and I. He's putting a fire into our heart and soul. And that fire is what causes the believer. It isn't how much churchianity we have or how many years we've went. My brother and sister, the oil in our lamp is the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost is a cleansing fire. It is a fire that makes itself present. It's a fire that was on the mountain with Moses. It was a fire that come all the way down in the temple. Amen. On the candlestick. All of these representations. If we spoke them all tonight, we'd be here all night. But it's all there through that. And without that fire, God says, "I'm not there." Amen. He come there in the tabernacle in the wilderness and they saw that fire rise and fall. Amen. They saw that. They knew God was in the tabernacle. They knew he was there and between the wings of the cherubam and his presence was there. Israel knew it, my brother and sister, because God made himself known. Now, I want to tell you right here, step out on a little bit of limb. There is no longer as it is uh us looking to uh the cherubam between the wings of the cherubam. It's you with your hands lifted up and the Holy Ghost is down in the midst of the wings of the cherubam. It's Christ in you. Amen. today the glory of God coming down. And it should be not that we boast of it, but it should be evident that the Holy Ghost has fallen on you and I. It should be evidence that he's present with us. It should be evidence in our decisions of life and how we behave. It should be evident, &gt;&gt; amen, to put a fire in our heart and soul. And it empowers us to act on the word of God. [snorts] Amen. You see, we live in such a influenced age. And brother Brown talks about how that hunting and stuff, he would get up in the morning and he would go out there and they just be little coals there in the fire. And he said, "You throw a few little sticks. You don't go get a big log. Throw a few little sticks on there. Then you fan it. Go look it up. It's good. It's good reading. &gt;&gt; Then you fan it. &gt;&gt; You don't call somebody to come up the mountain and fan it for you. &gt;&gt; You fan. &gt;&gt; And you fan it. And brother Bram goes on to say, "Where there's smoke, there's fire." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we think, "Oh, I don't really see a fire in my life, but something putting on that." What is it? We don't give up and say, "Well, I guess God's not here. I guess I'm not the bride of Christ. Fan &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; the coal. Fan the flame. &gt;&gt; And it will become. And then brother Brown goes on to say, Amen. When you have a fire in a dry forest, Amen. that fire creates its own wind which makes the fire greater and greater and greater. And he's making an example of you and I fanning the flame of the Holy Spirit in our life. Amen. And the more we fan it, the more that flame does, the more it creates its own life that comes forth and we no longer are lukewarm or cold. Amen. Because the fire has been fanned. I say God, help us to fan that fire tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Hallelujah. Amen. And as brother Brown uses that story, sorry to keep referencing like that, but just hearing all this stuff, a painted fire ain't going to do it for you. I just had a conversation with a gentleman today at this point in time. I'll keep it very simple. But I told him right to his face, not boastfully, but I said, "You know, be prepared that uh I'm going to get you in church." And he looked at me and goes, "Well, well, I already go." And I said, "No, the real thing. &gt;&gt; The real thing." Well, you know where I'm going right now? I I just told the preacher the other day that that you know, if you just keep reading from the Bible and and you just keep it real simple, I'll be here. but you do anything else, I'm out of here. And I was like, "Yeah, you know what? You're out of here with that attitude." But when God comes and changes the spirit and actually fans a little fire that says, "I need more. I want more. I have to have more." You won't be just settling for a couple little scriptures, a little pat on the back, and sent out a church in 30 minutes. Amen. You'll want something more. And I'll tell you, my brother and sister, if we're here tonight trying to have more faith, and I think all of us in a sense would say yes, we want more faith. You know what the [snorts] prophet told us to do? Relax. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let God have his way. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Not climbing up broken glass. Not how many Hail Marys, not how many whatevers. He's telling us relax and let God have his way. Just let God work in our life. Let it let it come. Amen. He talks about your healing. You want to be healed, just relax and believe God. Confess you're healed. Just go from there saying, I'm healed. I am healed. Go from there. I am saved. Go from there. I'm filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Got a need in your life? Got a desire in your life? Don't sit there and fret and fuss and get all tense about that. Amen. Go out of there saying, you know what? Praise God. God said it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let the word in you fan the flame. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Now, the word is, Brother Brandham puts it this way. Not exact words, but puts it this way. The Holy Ghost is never nervous. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost inspires confidence in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Imagine now we're here, message believers tonight, and we're nervous whether God can actually have a rapture. How could you ever have faith that God's going to take you in a rapture if you're not sure he can do it? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Me as a Christian almost like an oxymoron, right? Just kind of a, &gt;&gt; you know, well, I hope God &gt;&gt; can actually create the new Jerusalem. Well, you know, brother Brandham, in so many words, I won't get off on this, but what is the new Jerusalem? &gt;&gt; It's you and the word &gt;&gt; is the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Not a destination, you know, not like, oh, we're going over here. It's you and the word or the new Jerusalem. Amen. Now, how God chooses to manifest that? Well, how could I predict what God would do for you? Amen. Sister Vika, this man needs to stop. If you will help me come to the piano, please. In the book of Fleiman, first chapter:es 1-6. Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, and to Fleiman, and our dearly beloved and fellow laborer, and to beloved Aphia, and I looked up how to pronounce that word, and it's escaped me, Ashus, our fellow servant, to the church in the house. Grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. F, look at this. Fiman's love and faith is what God's he's addressing. He's dealing put this. I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus and toward his faith uh and all his saints. So what is it? He's seeing his faith expressed in his love &gt;&gt; to the saints. &gt;&gt; Isn't this incredible? It wasn't that he goes out and casts out a demon here and and prophesies here, but it come out that this man had faith in what the word said and it's now exposed or expressed in him. I love that. It really speaks to my heart. Amen. Hearing of thy love and faith which thou has towards the Lord Jesus toward all saints that the communication of thy faith may become effectual. the communication becoming effective by the acknowledging of every good thing which [music] is in you in Christ Jesus. Wait, we're looking about being super spiritual. We're looking about this and we're looking about that. How about it becomes effectual or effective by acknowledging every good thing. Amen. You know what that is? That's [music] why we are called to come together as a body to fellowship together to encourage one another. Have you ever noticed just like a coal that is moved away from the fire in the fireplace, it don't take long it loses that bright orange hot look and it gets darker and darker until ultimately it just goes cold over there. That's us saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is our faith? Our faith is, if you don't mind me, Brother Trevor, Sister Carrie, [snorts] Amen. Our faith is somebody like you saying, "Looks like Paul's getting a little cool. We better pray for him." one, but we better just nudge him back over towards the fire. We don't have to say, "Look, it looks like you're getting cold and we need to help you and we need to get [music] No, just a little nudge. Hey, brother Paul, did you know, God, we were praying the other day about this and this and the Lord come in the service and preached exactly on that and we [music] thank you what God has done." Oh, we prayed for a neighbor and the Holy Spirit come [music] down and that neighbor who was sick, God touched them and raised them up. Look what God's doing. He's hearing the prayer of the saints. Oh, look what God did over here. We're praying for a sister overseas. We're praying for that. Do you guys remember we prayed for a little girl? A little girl in South Africa that had been kidnapped. &gt;&gt; Remember that prayer? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you remember what happened to her? &gt;&gt; Amen. Saints around the world started praying for little Rebecca. Amen. And the the uh people who kidnapped her were looking for a ransom. And the family said, "We we have no we have nothing to give for ransom. We are poor people." And they said, "Go borrow it." And they even went and inquired, "Could we borrow money to ransom our daughter?" And and no place on earth, no banker, no place. They're like, "You have nothing. We're not going to do this." And so then they got desperate. We got desperate. I I hope you're with me on that. We got desperate. Lord, you need to deliver little Rebecca. And one day a man come and she was terrified because he was very angry. He loads her in a car blindfolded, drives her, turns here, turns there, turns there, drives her, and drives within a few blocks of the place they kidnapped her and kick her out of the car. Now, don't tell me my brother and sister that people that have, you know, what's happened in South Africa, a lot of those that they didn't pay ransom, they found them in the park, all right, but they were dead. But the Holy Ghost come, the power of God, the answer to prayer because the prayer of the saints avaleth much. Amen. And that's a life-changing thing. So what Satan wants to do is get us to not pray. Amen. So that he can have his way, but we as sons and daughters of God by the faith of God coming down in our hearts saying, "My prayer makes a difference." Amen. It might not seem like it changes much, but my prayer makes a difference. and Satan, I won't stop praying just because I might be discouraged. I'm going to pray anyhow because my God is a faithful God. My God answers prayer and I'm here to pray. Hallelujah. Now, I'm just going to get all wound up and excited. Hallelujah. [music] That the communication of thy faith, Amen. Maybe we could read that to oursel and say, "The communication of my faith has become effectual by acknowledging the good things that God [music] has done for me." Hallelujah. I love the Lord tonight. Amen. Excuse me. I think I managed managed to get through most of my notes here. Amen. Let's just stand sing a tong song or two. I was listening. I believe it was harvest time and I sometimes feel bad that I I end up singing lively songs at the end of service and I'm thinking I should sing more reverent kind of songs or whatever and and at [snorts] the end I believe it's harvest time u or who is this Melchzdc brother Brandham comes right out and says now let's sing this and he goes right into this lovely lively song and I thought oh thank you amen [music] it's not just me but look at this my brother and sister when We have a joy of our salvation. We [music] will share it. Amen. I'd like to sing 88. Brother Isaac. Amen. My favorite letter at the bottom. Sister [music] Vika. Let go and let God have [music] his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. All your sorrow will vanish. Your night turn today. [snorts] Let go and let God have his way. [music] Sing it from your heart now. Oh, let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. All your sorrow will vanish. Your nights turn today. Let go and let God have his way. [singing] 702. Amen. Hallelujah. Give me your hand. Let's agree together that all of our eneies will crumble at our feet. [music] Whatever we bind on earth [music] shall be bound in heaven at the name of Jesus. Satan has to flee. We've [music and singing] got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name [singing] of the Lord. Oh, Satan raouses. We cannot be defeated. [singing and music] You got the power in the name of the Lord. For many years now, Satan's tried to stop [music] us. Oh, but you, oh Jesus, Lord, we're still alive. mighty [music] army. We keep marching [singing] all over, fighting every battle [music] cuz the Lord's on our side [music] of the [singing] power in the name of Jesus. He got [music and singing] the power in the name of the Lord. [music] Oh Satan ra I shall not be defeated. [music] We've got the power in [music] the name of [singing] the Lord. [music] Amen. Amen. Not to add to anything, but when you were talking about the fire [music] and it fanning the flames further, there's a there's a term in firefighting. It's called plume dominant. When a fire creates [music] so much energy, it actually begins to create its own atmosphere around the [music] fire and it obviously [music] once it creates its own atmosphere, it's in control. &gt;&gt; And it and it and it causes massive fire growth. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. It'll create its own clouds, its own lightning. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Start other [music] fires. Let's do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I want to sing that little chorus. In the name of Jesus. I think the one right [music] below it. Yeah. There we go. In [music] the [singing] name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. We have the [music] victory in the name of Jesus. [music] In the name of Jesus, demons will have [singing] to flee. Can [music] we stand in the name of Jesus? Tell me who can stand [music and singing] before in the preious [music] name of Jesus. We have the [music] victory in the name [music] of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, I have the victory.
