and just to Worship in that Liberty amen I say thank you Lord that we have Liberty amen God bless you brother Daniel good to see you this morning amen let's remember also those that consider themselves to be a part of the assembly associated with the assembly here our sister April's with family and brother Adrian sister Ada they're in Montana and um just God bless them also amen and uh just have something very special to you know kind of announce today you know we don't normally announce birthdays but I thought it was very fitting that um Sister Sarah had to work on her birthday and we say God bless you to Sister Sarah our brother Bob sister Joanne have been married for 70. one three I thought it was three yeah 73 years is that not incredible now when the scripture says that there would be Witnesses in our midst Saints we can look right here in this congregation and see a brother and sister who had gave their hearts to the Lord have served him Faithfully all the ups and downs and whatever of life and they have been blessed with a strong marriage and a testimony that they have trusted God amen and so I know this is a little bit different but maybe we can say it loud enough to declare happy anniversary to brother Bob and sister Joanne this morning so one two three happy anniversary and God bless you amen you know such a lovely couple and we miss them so much here in the assembly amen did we come hungry this morning amen let's just come in anticipation let's open our hearts just receive it my brother and sister as brother George spoke to us last night and we caught that theme there is another book of Acts being written and we are part of the authority that's authoring the book amen and so to be part of that I say this morning let's forget about everything that would distract us said everything to the side and just dive into the word and you know we get etiquette and etiquette is a good thing right we don't want to you know uh get to to loose but we can have so much etiquette we don't enjoy what we're feasting on Amen so if you feel to say Amen or Hallelujah well that's within the etiquette of worshiping God Amen and let's just let's let our hearts pour out this morning as we receive the preaching of the word God bless you today Saints amen in Christ alone I place my trust amen that's what I care about what makes the difference what makes the difference [Music] in Christ the other yeah the verse start with the verse thank you In Christ Alone will like Glory no I could pride myself in battles one for I've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone all overcome oh I could stop and count successes like diamonds [Music] the trophies could not equal to the Grace by which I stand Christ the lord I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the Cross and everything Victory let it be safe my source of Hope is Christ Alone In Christ Alone by Glory only by his grace I am ready could reach beyond my weakness to my knees and now I seek no greater honor and just know him more out my gains at losses to the glory of the Lord in Christ alone I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in everything Victory let it be said of me my source of Hope In Christ Alone sing it again in Christ alone in Christ the lord foreign [Music] Hope In Christ Alone one more time in Christ the lord I please my trust and find my glory the power all the cross in everything Victory let it be said of me my source of string my source of Hope is Morning Saints Rosia Santos it's good to be back in the house of the Lord and see all our visitors from far away and that's why we have a translator foreign and it might take a little longer but there's only one service today so all you got to do is pay attention you see this is already up here sure for a reason so we're in Acts chapter 21 today and you stay seated because we're going to go through this very slowly and so in this chapter the sea Journey continues they've been coming south from Turkey down into caesarea um so they land in what's currently Lebanon um and so they minister to the Saints there for about a week and finding disciples we tarry their seven days who said to Paul through the spirit that he should not go to Jerusalem foreign and so we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children until we were out of the city and we kneel down in the shore and prayed our company now you might wonder why are we going through all these details because the promise of the age was I'm going to send you Elijah is going to bring you back to the originals and so also in one of the greatest experiences Brothers he was beyond the curtain of time and sometimes we get lost with the shiny teeth and the bright eyes and all the beautiful things but the the angel said and you're going to be judged for what you said we want to go back and erase a few things it's usually me over there but um brother Brown didn't even take a breath he said what about Paul and he said we'll probably be judged for what he said brother said well if his people get in my people get in because I have preached everything just like Paul this is and all of us that were there we said we're depending on that right so it's not a waste of time to go through the book of Acts just look at that verse five they were up there ministering for a week and then they came down to the Shoreline Rivera with the wives with the children just like this crowd here so they're on so they're on the beach of the Mediterranean and they're kneeling down and they're praying and when we had taken leave of one another we took the ship and returned then they returned home so another tearful goodbye adios so in verse 8 they finally came to caesarea and they came to the home of Philip this is Philip the Evangelist we saw back in chapter six and verse 9 and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy so here's the Fulfillment of Joel's words your daughters shall prophesy and it was manifested to one family is so in verse 10 and as we teared there many days there came down from Judea a certain Prophet named agabus and when he was come unto us he took Paul's girl and bound his own hands and feet and said uh the Holy Ghost so sheltered and he said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews of Jerusalem bind the man that is the owner of the Squirtle and shall deliver him unto the hands of the Gentiles and when you heard these things both we and they the of the place he sought him not to go to Jerusalem so at every stop it's the same morning even with the Vindicated prophet and Paul says no I must go I'm not I'm not scared to die but I'm going to Jerusalem in the name of Jesus Christ and so that's why today we preach from William branham's absolute the scriptures Corinthians chapter two for a minute foreign Corinthians 2 and verse 1 and 2 it says and I Brethren when I came to you so he's talking back to these people where he's been my brother when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God is for I determined not to know anything among you saved Jesus Christ and him crucified in verse that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God so we've known many people that have learned the gospel to such a degree and I can convince people that this is right but then the first storm that comes through they're blown away it's got to be the power of God the gospel is not complicated it's a simple gospel Jesus Christ died and rose again for your salvation so after many warnings from good friends and very spiritual people amigos don't go to Jerusalem Paul and his associates arrive in Jerusalem and the day following Paul went in with us unto James and all the elders were present the uh yes so just to give you a little highlight here there's several James in the scripture is this one here James the Apostle he's the son of seven James and John and then there was James the Apostle son of alphaeus um and he um he's also known as James the less because he'll be shorter than the other one at all times together you just have to get in and read it and then there's James our Lord's carnal brother and then there's James the father of Judas the Apostle so in Jerusalem Paul met with the apostles and the church leaders and he told them the many things that happened on his trip and they were very pleased and they glorified God is and this could have been as late as 56 A.D is and this would have been about 20 years after the day of Pentecost experience so then they said to Paul now look brother we have a problem here in in Jerusalem you're aware that thousands of Jews have believed uh and they are jealous of the law they want to stay straight but they've been informed about you they've been told by other Jews out there among the Gentiles you told people to forsake the the message of Moses and forget circumcision and to forsake the customs of the law and there's no secrets they know you're here [Music] so we have a plan we got four men willing to go with you you take them with you and you purify yourselves Contigo foreign and so he did what he could and he took them in and um they um uh but once again the the twin was present s and you can always count on it until the day of the Rapture and see you're looking at two people but we're looking at you know about 60 people this is we see the reactions and we see the different colors and in every congregation no matter how small it is there's three kinds of Believers yeah in First Corinthians and see what we have over here Paul's words also 13 and 14 of chapter 10. says here there had no temptation taken you but such as common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you're able but with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it we've got a study on on idolatry and images and so forth It's amazing like this why did it idolatry come into this portion right here because it's very important and you will have problems until the day you leave this planet so back to acts 21 verse 27 and when the seven days were almost ended the Jews which were of Asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him this is the man that teaches men everywhere against the people and the law in this place and further back Greeks also in the temple and have polluted this holy place so they're making things up just like today however you think you might win in politics it won't work because they will take you down so so here we got another riot in Jerusalem and it's a great confusion and the plan was to kill him right there because if we can kill this man problem solved now they didn't have guns but they had some knives they had clubs in verse 31 and as they went about to kill him Tidings came to the chief captain of the band and all Jerusalem was in an uproar Quran so Rome was in charge of the law and they were supposed to be keeping the peace and all this is because of a rumor you know a supposition and so somebody reported it to the police and here comes the chief of police had a number of soldiers with him and when they Riot or saw the police coming so they quit beating him the soldiers you know surrounded Paul Los aldados uh and they asked who he was and what this was all about and the crowd began shouting all kinds of accusations and nothing was understood so the captain said bring him into headquarters so due to the violence of the people this is the soldiers are actually carrying the preacheros and when they got on the stairs because you know the stairs were outside the building so when they get on the stairs um the the people were shouting he should die and do it right now they had no evidence only a supposition so they were blindly loyal to their religion [Music] what they thought to be the truth and they could quote their profit perfectly and they didn't have an iPad but they were bound to determine we're the right ones and they were ready to kill anyone they didn't see it exactly their way blind Fanatics and I know some in the 21st century so they were ready to to die or even to kill for their view of God of yesterday totally ignoring what God was doing present tense and not interested in the future they were content with forms and rituals inquiring word by word but no life and willing to kill anyone so many people weren't here last night we have a way of keeping you awake you're getting this in two languages so surely you can understand something but if you stayed up last night that's not my fault but we will try to wake you up that was a warning and so there's no life when you just you quote quote quote and no life this is the revealed word was a foreign concept to them and all they cared about what did Moses say about this but very selectively ignoring many things he said and they didn't have any recordings to each decide what it really meant you'd be surprised the people that call me and their children get up to about 14 years old and they haven't prop they haven't raised them correctly now we got a problem uh what would brother Brandon do okay you're a little bit late for that yeah should have started back here when they were four years old you see God's word is never stagnant like these ponds out here the truth keeps moving Heaven and Earth will pass away all these nice cars they're going to burn one day everything you have is going to burn but my word shall not pass away so the word of God is living and moving and God will find someone somewhere whom he can make it come alive he only has your hands he only has your eyes only your mouth only your feet so Hebrews 13 8 is still real today but we must be totally yielded to God to do with us as he pleases see brother Brandon was born a Seer a prophet that's why we have the picture of the cabin somewhere that oh that's how it started but God could only use him properly when he yielded completely now we're here all the time well we've got to say what he says you want to hear you want to say what William Branham says he says I'm just a sinner saved by grace he says and God can withdraw his Mercy anytime he pleases so what about us we think we're something special only thing that makes us special is that God has chosen you to live out your portion today the portion of the drama of dark laodicea is all the past ages are depending on you to come to Perfection so we can go they're depending on us to live out our portion of the drama because the word says they without us are not made perfect may God have mercy on us and that you can go from here a better Christian Cristiano okay back to our story in 2137 37 yeah 37. and as Paul was led into the castle so he's on the stairway they're leading him up you know he's a prisoner base he said to the chief captain may I speak unto thee versus and he said oh you can speak Greek aren't you that Egyptian that was here a few days back and made a big uproar and took four thousand men into the will of murderers Paul said I am a man which I'm a Jew of Tarsus a city of celicia citizen of no mean City I beseech thee suffer me to speak to the people entonces El Pueblo so he at least could speak two languages maybe three this is and when he had given him you know permission Paul stood up on the stairs and beckoned with his hand unto the people and when there was made a great silence he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue is now what do you think Paul looked like at that point you think you look real sharp like like Jose the officials didn't know who he was so they got the crowd quiet now this isn't people like burning our cities over here a couple years ago these are religious people they're ready to kill for their relief and without a microphone he began testifying verse 22 and verse 1. says here men and Brethren and fathers hear ye my defense which I make unto you Padres and then in princes and when they heard that that he spoke in Hebrew to them they were even more quiet Jew born over here in Tarsus I said with celicia yet brought up in the city at the feet of Gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of fathers and was zealous towards God as you are this day is and I persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prison both men and women 17. and it came to pass that when I was come again to Jerusalem even while I prayed in the temple I was in a trance like a vision is and I saw him saying unto me there was God saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me is [Music] and I said Lord they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee is uh he's talking about our family the people who believe just like us hey when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed I also was standing by and consenting to his death and kept the arraignment of them that slew him [Music] so this is the conversation he's having with the Lord for I will send the hence unto the Gentiles and they gave him audience so he's telling all this to these people in the street there's thousands no microphones and so they listened to him carefully and then they lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow up from the earth it is not fit that he should live and as they cried out and cast off their clothes they threw dust in the air hey [Music] and the chief Captain commanded him to be brought inside the headquarters the castle and bathe that he should be examined by scourging that he might know whereof they cried against him so this is a nice little conference at the table hey who are you what's your name and fill out the form yes this is Scourge means to harass to whip severely severely with no mercy is so that's the way they inquired back there is so from chapter 21 Paul is now in jail and he's protected from religious Fanatics and since the Jews were so upset with him so the the police said well he must be guilty of something so in 25 it says and as they bound him with thongs so that's that's leather straps so he's like in a straight jacket you know and um so as he's bound up Paul said unto the Centurion that stood by it's a long full for you to Scourge a man that is in Roman and uncondemned yes and so they didn't know who he was he sees the people trying to kill him and so the the Roman Roman officer he's just a public servant official Romano era and he has no Revelation or interest in the fanatical religion of the Jews but he's responsible for the Peace of Jerusalem so he's going to get to the bottom of this problem now the Jews are fanatical some of you been over there and you met some of them they have a saying that when two Jews are are discussing something there's at least three opinions so that you can't argue with them please come on here in 25 um and 26 and this in turn heard that he went and told the chief Captain saying take heed what they'll do is because this guy's a Roman dollars then the chief Captain came and said to him tell me are you Roman and he said yes and the chief Captain said with great sum obtained I this freedom so he paid money to gain his Roman citizenship Romana and Paul said that I was born free we can identify with that we don't have to give money we don't have to burn candles we don't have to have a little thing here tell us who we are we're washing the blood of the Lambs so in uh verse 30 he can't figure this out for himself and he wants to find the truth so he turns this over to the high priest and his counselves so the Sanhedrin is the high court of the land [Music] it's a group of 71 members it's divided into three groups the chief priests elders and scribes and they were the religious rulers that interpreted the law [Music] they made all the big decisions and but they could not issue a death penalty so the high priest presided over the nation's highest administrative judicial body and um but right below the high priest was an exclusive group of about 200 pure blooded Jews and Below these 200 was another 7 000. of ordinary priests and all these men could trace their lineage right back to Aaron and now they were divided into 24 Priestly Clans and so each group served for a week at a time in the temple so you get the picture they were all about structure but they were under the watchful eye of the Romans and only Rome could issue the death penalty so this just happens to be the fifth occasionally that all these very powerful people okay we're called upon to render decision uh regarding the claims of Christ and his followers to go away yeah we can wake up tomorrow it's all a bad dreams but that's impossible why because Jesus Christ was and is the Fulfillment of the words of prophets and so here we are the followers and we will have persecution but uh these people fail to see the manifestation they can they can quote the word they use they use we have all kinds of people today carrying spoken word books we got people in the Congo worshiping the picture of the Prophet um they give their life for it but they're on a Sidetrack they're not on the main road so these people even though they could quote the prophet is they were on the wrong side of the issue and so um the first time that they were called on to issue a uh uh decision foreign were questioned by the same tribunal by what power what name have you done this [Music] and then the apostles were having marvelous meetings in Acts chapter 5 and it was Cinco then there was a trial and death of Stephen in Acts chapter six so here 20 years after the after the crucifixion yeah yeah 20 years after crucifixion I was facing the same powerful bunch of guys but it's different individuals in individuals but it only got more corrupt and more arrogantos so in 2230 on the next day when he would have known for the certainty whereby he was accused of the Jews he loosed him from his bands and the commander and commanded the chief of police and all the council to appear and brought Paul down and stood before them as a chances so here's so here's Paul on trial facing Supreme Court you might say and so the scene opens where he's standing there in verse 1. and Paul earnestly beholding the council said men and Brethren I have lived in all good conscience before God until this very day with his opening statement he establishes the foundation which is honestyles so you see God knows that we're not sinless but he calls us to be honest if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us so as Paul said before this powerful Council he can honestly declare I've got a clear conscience now honesty and clear conscience are not the same as Perfection is Paul was by no means perfect but he was totally forgivenado and he was honest about his failures so after his opening statement you know he opened up the the meeting and then in a total fit of angeros the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smack him in the mouth and then Paul remember how brother Branham described him yeah High Temperance sarcastic Jews but see God can use anybody for his purpose we would have never picked him but he was totally surprised by this and he lost his cooler for a minute and then one of the court flunkies that was nearby says he says um are you reviling God's high priest is it is then said Paul I didn't know Brethren I didn't know he was the high priest it's written in the scriptures Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of that people Hermanos but when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other were Pharisees he cried out in the council men and Brethren I'm a Pharisee son of a Pharisee of the hope of the resurrection of the dead I'm counting question is and when he had said this there arose A dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the multitude was divided say there's no Resurrection nor angels nor Spirit but the Pharisees confess both foreign of the Pharisees uh they arose and they were striving we find no evil in this man but if the spirit of an Angel has spoken to him let us not fight against God um and when there was great dissension the chief Captain you know the police chief fearingless Paul should be pulled into pieces he commanded the soldiers to go down by force take him bring him back to the jail yeah and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness in Rome is so God is confirming his eternal word because in Matthew 28 20. I Am With You Always even to the end of the world these are promises for us today many times we're right up against the wall and we can't see any way out of it we just wish it would all go away but God has a way our God's child he will make a way and don't be trying to fall asleep because I can I can throw this pretty good too [Music] so God's elect have always been under assault God's elect I've always been under us Allah ever since the Garden of Eden when Cain got so mad he killed his brother they simply had a different Revelation they believe differently and if you look at that story very carefully Adam and Eve never told those boys the whole story because it was revealed to uh to do the spirit of arrogance cannot stand it when there's a least bit of opposition the Christians in this world can mostly get along but the Muslims want Total Domination no you see so it's very dangerous so if you if you look at all the Jews in the world they are one part the Muslims are 999. and they can't stand it that there's one part that's not with us so the bride is not looking to just get along but just to live our part of the drama and live on us before God and he's going to take us home now the people that are going to be left behind and they'll be surprised are the ones that didn't begin their Journey correctly at the foot of the cross God will unfold his plan on schedule don't try to figure it out just be faithful and be obedient and so a long time ago brother Branham said uh you people with these saw blade tempers see it sounds better in Spanish because it's a it's an electric song and so always spouting out at the mouth at somebody uh he says be careful you'll be guilty if you speak one word against your brother it's not right not just go around tearing everything down you don't have to stick with knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence yeah and how do you do that running your mouth without a filter we've all been guilty but we're here to remind you you shouldn't do that and you know over in the book of uh in the Book of John chapter 12. the the Jews came to to visit Lazarus in Jesus Lazarus house but they wanted to kill Jesus and kill Lazarus again look right there in John 12 9 and 10. yes so now here we are years later in the book of Acts in the early church and they continue with that same evil anointing they want to kill these people and so in where we're in 23 verse 14 and there were more than 40 that made a conspiracy verse 13 14 okay and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul is now therefore he with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down out of the jail tomorrow like he would want to inquire more something of him and we will come near and we're ready to kill him Remos and when Paul's sister's son heard that they were lying in weighed he went and going into the castle and told Paul one of the centurions and said bring this young man to the chief Captain he has something to tell him so he took him and brought him there Chief captain and he called him to him okay so anyway he takes him aside and in verse 19 and the chief Captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately asked him what is it that you want to tell me foreign to bring him down bring Paul down to the council to inquire more perfectly but don't do it because they are waiting their 40 men which abound themselves under an oath they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him and now they're ready looking for the promise from thee yeah foreign [Music] now sit patiently we only got a little ways to go there's only 28 chapters in the book and lunch isn't ready downstairs anyway so in verse 23 we say that they prepared 200 foot soldiers in another 70 on horses and another 200 with Spears so 470 men in uniforms to protect one propheta but Paul was also on a horse and they were going to take him down to caesarea to see Governor Felix so the chief of police his name is Claudius he sent a letter with the soldiers to Felix to tell him what the case is so they took off in the dark and all 470 here they go to a place about 40 miles away so they stopped to rest and the next day 400 went back to Jerusalem in the 70 continued on Horseback down to caesarea so look at verse 33 of chapter 23. 33. so when they came to caesarea they and delivered the epistle to the governor and presented Paul also before him es and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was and when he understood that he was of silicia I will hear the government when your accusers come here also and he commanded him to be kept in Heritage judgment Hall owed so it wasn't exactly jail but he was confined with Pleasant surroundings so chapter 24 verse 1 and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with certain orator that's a lawyer named tertullius who informed the governor against Paul is so five days later here comes the high priest with all his you know friends and his lawyer Mr tertullius and in verse 2 he flatters the government with great words we have enjoyed great peace and prosperity due to your wonderful planning yes come on and we're so thankful yes but we have a little situations this man here is so they invented accusations which are named amount of the name calling um he has profaned our Temple now this Roman Governor could care less about their religious problems but he went on he said but we grabbed him and we were going to judge him according to our laws yeah they were going to beat him to death but your man this Commander better took him from us under great violence he simply rescued Paul it's implemented and so we thought it best that you yourself judge this case and all the Jews with him said hey man yeah you're right Mr turkeys we agree so Paul here he is on trial for his faith standing before angry arrogant religious High Council is [Music] about 57 A.D is so Paul uh Felix the governor gives an odd to Paulo and he permits him to say his peace so now we're in 24 verse 10. and Paul after the governor had beckoned him to speak answered for as much as I know that thou has been of many years a judge in this nation I do more cheerfully answered before myself because the thou mayest understand that there are yet but 12 days until I went up to Jerusalem for the worship is and they neither found in me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city neither can they prove the things that they accuse me but this I confess to you that after the Wake which they call heresy that's the way I worship the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets is so he goes on testifying and verse 22 and when Felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lisias the chief Captain comes down down I will know the uttermost of your matter is and he commanded the Centurion to keep Paul and to let him have some Liberty that he should uh forbid none of his acquaintances to minister to him or come to visit over so the government was not interested in the fine points of the Jewish religious laws he was simply protecting God's man of the hour is from Death by the hands of the most religious people on the planet Sadducees and the Pharisees they knew it all and they had the attitude to prove it so they're really in a fix here so Governor Felix having a better understanding of the way of Christ he granted an injunction and he says when the chief of police comes down then we'll we'll have a another trial have a nice day so a few days later Here Comes Governor Felix and his wife Priscilla today and so you know they lived there and so they invited Paul over for lunch and asked him about this Christian faith Christianity and you only got to ask a preacher one time and he'll give you all kinds of stuff you know and so he expounded to them regarding righteousness and Holiness judgment is coming and there's such an anointing president at lunch the governor was was uh he was fearful and he trembled he was moved by the power of God by the words of a gospel preacheras just like some of us he put it off you know he was just about convinced you can go now I'll call you at a more convenient time I've got a lot of things to do today I have priorities friends it's never a better time than right now Amigos when God is speaking to you when God puts you through some circumstances he's trying to get your attention none of us have any guarantee of getting out to our car after a while you know people I know people that they look good but the Lord so when God's pressing you for an answer proper time you act now you know give you one small story from Brother Randall's life back in 1955 before a lot of you were even born but Hollywood made a wonderful film The Ten Commandments [Music] and some of the people the Tabernacle snuck off to see it and so they come back and they're telling brother Brandon how great it is it's a very small theater about the size of this church so brother Brown said okay I might I might just do that so he takes himself and his wife and Rebecca which would be nine years old and so they go down there and they watch this four-hour film this is and so I'm sure most of you have seen it but when the pillar fire comes onto the screen they did such a good job brother bran thought it was real it's back down so anyway they're leaving the film they're leaving the theater and they're driving home and Rebecca's crying honey what's the matter and see to her it was almost like a newsreel you know and so they um uh and so she said well but Dad didn't you see when Moses said all that's on the Lord's Side come with me and so of course we're looking at those who come with him but she was watching the ones that hung back she said that it wasn't fair they were they were thinking about they were trying to go and so he said let this be a lesson dear when God tells you something you act now when you feel like it not when Grandma says it's okay I see some tired people so in our story here uh the governor sent for Paul on a regular basis but we never read that Governor accepted Christ all that he was baptized talk about it oh I know we know we know a few people like that each meeting guess what he was expecting verse 26. he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul that he might loose him where have he sent more often and communed with him is so this went on for two years so this thing of money under the table didn't start Mexico doing it clear back there is and so when the governor's term came to an end and so here comes another Governor to take his place but Felix being a great politician he left Paul as a prisoner in order to please the Jews and make himself look good yeah see with some people it's all about appearance put on your best clothes and come to church see God can see you all through the week he hears the attitudes and so what some people it's all about appearance but very little substance and God Demands a correct order of priorities Christ always has first place Martin Luther the fifth messengero he said Christ Alone so anything that comes between you and God is an idol okay and so we're going to stay with what our Prophet said as he expounded the scriptures to us see because we have these we have these these uh these spoken word booklets you know this isn't something way far away this is only the Amplified version of the scriptures together perfectly yes but we got people today burning candles to the to the books and the pictures we come right around Catholicism again okay so we got plenty of time we're going to go into last three chapters 25 and one now when Festus has come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea up to Jerusalem Jerusalem so fastest is the new governor then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul comparison and desired favor against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem laying in wait to kill him so of all the things going on in Israel this is the first order of business they're going to inform the new government about this prisoners serve with all due respect please bring this sorry preacher up to Jerusalem and the governor says in verse 4 no no he'll remain in my jail in caesarea Festival I'll take care of him so after 10 days in Jerusalem he goes back down to caesarea so they had a trial in verse 7. [Music] and when he was come the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood around about and laid many Grievous complaints against Paul which they could not prove well he answered for himself neither against the law or the Jews neither against the temple nor yet against Caesar have I offended any at all but Festus near the new governor willing to do the Jews a pleasure answered in Paul and said will you go up to Jerusalem and uh there be judged about these things before me um and Paul said I stand at Caesar's judgment where I ought to be judged to the Jews who have done the wrong as you very well knows for if I be an offender or have committed anything worthy of death I refuse not to die but if there be none of those things uh were of these accuse me no man can deliver me into them I appeal to Caesars is so the new governor says that um uh you know I mean then King Agrippa you know came to welcome the new governor and Festus rehearsed the whole story with him in verse 22 and Agrippa said to Festus I would like to hear from myself tomorrow uh and he said tomorrow you will hear him and so let's see verse 23 on the next day when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pomp they were entered into the hearing place of hearing with the chief Captain's principal man of the City Festus commanded Paul was brought forth is and fester said the governor says to the king and all men that are here present with us you see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with before me both at Jerusalem and also here crying uh that he ought to not live any longer but when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death that he himself has appealed to Augustus Caesar I have determined to send him and uh and of whom I have no certain thing to write so he's you know said I I don't have anything I can't send any any letter you know so you you check him out see what you think about it and so in verse 1 of 26 then Agrippa said unto Paul that were permitted to speak for thyself then Paul stretched forth his hand and answered for himself I think myself happy King Agrippa because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things where I'm accused of the Jews especially because I know that uh they need to be an expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews wherever I beseech thee to hear me patiently questions so he starts to tell his story and go down to verse 14 can you tell us about the encounter with the Lord on the way to Damascus when we were all falling to the earth I heard the voice speak to me saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecuted on me it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he gives him the whole story you can read it later verse 22 having therefore obtained help of God I continue unto this day witnessing both the small and great saving not saying none other things than those that were prophets and the Moses did say which that should come up you see that's the same thing William Brandon said he's brought the word to us and so the message back then in verse 23 that Christ should suffer he should be first they should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles so he gives him this the whole gospel tells his whole story they got plenty of time and in verse 28 then Agrippa you know the king said to Paul almost that persuaded me to be a Christiano at the time of Paul's trial on caesarea it was not a crime to be a Christian when standing before the Roman Court they all agreed that Paul was innocent but after spending two years in the prison he was sent off to Rome and his journey was not a pleasure Cruise they had a lot of problems and we're not going to go into all the problems but you need to read verses chapter 27 and 28 for yourself because they had they had all kinds of problems see today you can fly from from Tel Aviv to Rome in about three and a half hours I had no motor either Road or With the Wind then and this this boat could be a hundred feet long it is carrying 300 tons of grain to Rome and uh yeah we're not going to give you all the details but he did get there and he was under arrest for about two years during this time Nero had a lot of problems and so they let him lose for a while and from First Timothy 1 and Romans 15 it's reasonable to think that Paul went to Macedonia and also to Spain yes and then he was rearrested and at that time all the big cities like like Rome had a wall around him somewhere outside the wall one one day in the year 67. Paul was beheaded now we think of that as real bad and very inhumane then someone says but it was instant death we got all these people laying over here in the hospital in the Rest Homes pills and more pills so anyway that's what they did back then and today there's a beautiful church outside the walls there's where Paul is buried foreign will be there in about 30 days so the actual end of Paul's life is unknown but all the details are here in the Bible that we need his letters to his people they became scripture so that'll be the end of our study in the book of Acts do you have any questions write them out either language gracias amen all as well amen did you enjoy that journey through your own life amen when we look at this we realize my brother and sister were not reading history the revealed word for our day amen and everything that God put down in record for you and I to have now this might seem a strange way to put it but for you and I to have Advantage we get to see exactly what Satan's plan was now I just look at this real quick as as Paul is there God wants him to be able to speak to those people on the island he's bit by the serpent uh he shakes it off and they say this must be a God but follow me you've been bit by the serpenters you have shaken it off because God is in you and they said well you make yourself God and brother Branham says this is not
