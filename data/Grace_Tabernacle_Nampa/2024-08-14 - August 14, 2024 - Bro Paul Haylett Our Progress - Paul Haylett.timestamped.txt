[23:51] Life he's here keeps relighting the
[23:54] fire and just keeps encouraging keeps
[24:00] strengthening keeps revealing himself
[24:02] more and more to us and uh I think it's
[24:06] just such a wonderful thing
[24:09] because we're human and sometimes in
[24:12] just the whole labor of
[24:15] life we just kind of like the
[24:18] fire you're you're out there in the
[24:20] evening time and if somebody doesn't
[24:22] throw wood on the fire eventually it
[24:25] goes out and the Lord just comes and
[24:27] keeps just adding adding and adding and
[24:29] adding encouraging strengthening us and
[24:32] I say it's a a wonderful thing amen uh
[24:36] before we proceed into our thought
[24:38] tonight I would just ask you to please
[24:41] remember Sister Dorcas I just had some
[24:44] interaction with her and she has just
[24:46] been in so much pain that um it's just
[24:51] been very discouraging to her so please
[24:54] pray for her uh for her family uh and uh
[24:59] uh sister Rebecca is thankful for the
[25:02] Bible that you bought her as a
[25:03] graduation gift and uh I'll just be bold
[25:06] to say I pray she reads it I pray that
[25:09] it speaks to her heart and and uh we
[25:11] live in troubled times but we don't have
[25:14] to be troubled amen we can stand with
[25:17] confidence on the word for the hour that
[25:19] we live in amen and you know I I just
[25:23] have to say I started this thought uh
[25:27] and uh somehow or another I've ended up
[25:30] going entirely a different direction so
[25:34] I I I um I I just pray that uh it will
[25:38] speak to your heart will be something
[25:40] that would be encouraging and uh I just
[25:44] want to say thank you to our musicians
[25:46] the song service was lovely spoke to my
[25:49] heart and uh I'm thankful to the Lord
[25:51] for uh the desire of our musicians to to
[25:56] um uh help us in our worship uh brother
[26:01] Alex leading in songs and amen I want to
[26:05] speak to you tonight very simple title
[26:08] as it were uh our
[26:11] progress and um uh I put as a note below
[26:15] that um Satan doesn't like you and um
[26:20] that that shouldn't come as any surprise
[26:22] to us but you know the reason kind of a
[26:26] little bit why I it's along this tile is
[26:29] when you start studying a certain vein a
[26:31] certain thought you realize just how
[26:34] much God is doing for us you just
[26:36] realize uh the keeping power the
[26:39] encouraging power the strength that he
[26:42] is pouring into us and
[26:46] uh you know I don't know if you pay
[26:48] attention to the politics but they're
[26:50] throwing the word weird around and I I'm
[26:54] here to join them on that because Satan
[26:57] thinks you're weird
[26:59] amen he he he doesn't understand why
[27:03] that you are not interested in what the
[27:05] rest of the world is interested in he
[27:08] he's he doesn't understand why you don't
[27:11] find pleasure in the very finest of
[27:14] Pleasures that he has offered in this
[27:16] day and H he doesn't understand why that
[27:21] uh in a time when it's easier to just go
[27:24] with the flow that you are pressing
[27:27] against it amen and and uh so because of
[27:31] that he just simply doesn't like you if
[27:33] we'll turn in our Bibles uh in Exodus
[27:36] the 14th chapter we're going to just
[27:39] draw a little bit out of it quite
[27:41] lengthy scripture but I hope you don't
[27:43] mind uh us reading uh the uh uh from
[27:48] verse 1 to verse 15 we'll try to be
[27:51] concise good to see you brother Chris
[27:54] you travels amen and the Lord spake to
[27:58] Moses saying Speak unto the children of
[28:01] Israel that they turn and encamp before
[28:04] my I cannot pronounce these words I
[28:06] don't even know where to
[28:08] start uh p heroth and mcdull and the Sea
[28:13] over against ba zon where it shall ye
[28:18] encamp by the Sea for Pharaoh will say
[28:21] now this is like prophecy God is making
[28:24] a declaration to Moses this what Pharaoh
[28:27] is going to say
[28:28] my I tell you what my brother and sister
[28:30] we're living in a day that God's made
[28:32] some declarations that that the devil's
[28:35] going to say this but that doesn't mean
[28:37] that's what's going to happen amen isn't
[28:39] he often times voiced his deal you you
[28:42] have this issue you have this these
[28:44] problems finances whatever it might be
[28:46] discouragements Etc and he speaks those
[28:49] as though they're fact but God's already
[28:52] speaking the word saying this is what
[28:54] Satan's going to say this is what
[28:55] Satan's thinking this is what Satan's
[28:57] going to do and it really doesn't matter
[29:00] what Satan's original plan was amen and
[29:03] uh for fedro will say to the CH uh of
[29:06] the children of Israel they are
[29:08] entangled in the land the Wilderness
[29:11] hath shut them in and I will harden
[29:14] Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow
[29:17] after them and I will be honored upon
[29:20] pharaoh and upon all his host that the
[29:23] Egyptians may know that I am the Lord
[29:26] and they did so and it was
[29:29] told the king of Egypt that the people
[29:31] fled in the heart of fedro and his
[29:34] servants was turned against the people
[29:36] and they said why have we done this that
[29:38] we have let Israel go from serving us
[29:42] now I want you to think about and bring
[29:44] all of this into this day right now you
[29:47] see Satan is not happy that you have
[29:51] turned from serving him he is sitting
[29:55] there very very upset that that you have
[29:59] chosen to as it were flee his kingdom
[30:03] and not follow him and we see this in in
[30:06] Pharaoh because he he thought he had
[30:09] these people a servitude he let them
[30:13] this Liberty of having children building
[30:15] families falling in love all of these
[30:17] kind of things it would be a permanent
[30:19] slave
[30:22] Supply
[30:24] amen does this not fit the day we live
[30:27] in like a permanent slave Supply and he
[30:32] made ready his Chariot and took his
[30:34] people with him and he took 600 chosen
[30:37] chariots and all the Chariots of Egypt
[30:39] and captains over every one of them and
[30:42] the Lord hardened the heart of pharoh
[30:44] king of Egypt and he pursued after the
[30:47] children of Israel and the children of
[30:49] Israel went out with a high hand but the
[30:53] Egyptians pursued after them now I want
[30:55] you to remember the high hand okay but
[30:58] the Egyptians pursued after them all the
[31:00] horses and Chariots of pharaoh and his
[31:03] Horsemen and his army and overtook them
[31:06] encamping by the Sea beside and I'll
[31:09] pronounce this different than I did
[31:10] before forgive me pero before ba zavon
[31:15] and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children
[31:17] of Israel lifted up their eyes and
[31:19] behold the Egyptians marched after them
[31:21] and they were sore afraid and the
[31:23] children of Israel Cried Out unto the
[31:26] Lord and they said unto Moses now do you
[31:30] catch that they're crying out unto the
[31:33] Lord but they said unto Moses now
[31:37] remember these people are the same ones
[31:40] that have cried for 400 years for
[31:44] deliverance because there were no graves
[31:46] in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die
[31:49] in the wilderness wherefore hast thou
[31:52] dealt thus with us to carry us forth out
[31:55] of Egypt is not this the the word that
[31:59] we did tell thee in Egypt let us
[32:03] alone come on are you with
[32:06] me on one
[32:08] hand Lord we need
[32:10] Deliverance let not another generation
[32:13] let not our
[32:14] children become bondage to Le
[32:19] oysa but preacher You Preach too
[32:22] hard you're too
[32:25] strict you should just leave us alone
[32:28] you see the Paradox of it
[32:31] all it's
[32:35] Humanity that we did tell thee in Egypt
[32:37] saying let us alone that we may serve
[32:39] the Egyptians for it had been better for
[32:41] us to serve the Egyptians than that we
[32:44] should die in the wilderness and Moses
[32:46] said unto the people fear ye not stand
[32:49] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[32:53] which he will show you today for the
[32:56] Egyptians whom you have seen seen today
[32:58] ye shall see them again no more forever
[33:02] the Lord shall fight for you and ye
[33:05] shall hold your peace and the Lord said
[33:07] unto Moses wherefore CEST thou unto me
[33:10] speak unto the children of Israel that
[33:13] they go forward Heavenly Father we thank
[33:16] you for your word Lord bless the Saints
[33:19] tonight father each and those Lord that
[33:21] were unable to come those that are here
[33:23] father we just ask you to speak to each
[33:25] and every heart in the name of Jesus
[33:27] Christ Christ amen you may be
[33:31] seated I always found this scripture to
[33:35] be such an example of the Paradox of
[33:38] humanity that uh they cry for
[33:41] deliverance but don't like the way that
[33:43] God delivers them amen now this is a
[33:46] time of The Exodus and you know I think
[33:49] when we look at this we can look at it
[33:51] really uh uh uh and I hope tonight that
[33:54] we don't just look at his history but
[33:56] look at it today uh you know looking for
[33:59] a trouble-free
[34:01] experience and and um I I think that
[34:03] Lord understands that I think many of us
[34:06] when we got saved kind of felt like you
[34:08] know hey we've gave our life to the lord
[34:11] it's going to just be easy now and are
[34:14] perplexed a little bit when it becomes
[34:16] very difficult but here is Israel just
[34:19] looking for a trouble-free experience no
[34:21] obstacles but what they don't realize is
[34:24] God was not just putting them in this
[34:27] time time just for them but also for an
[34:31] example uh Through the Ages and I think
[34:34] very much uh example to the day we live
[34:36] in as we are now in our Exodus amen
[34:40] we're coming to a very very close we're
[34:43] seeing lots of things come uh brother
[34:46] vasile just shared a little something
[34:48] with me and I didn't get to listen to
[34:49] all of it because of time but my brother
[34:52] and sister the signs are before us the
[34:54] signs are in the heavens and it's not
[34:56] just us the bride of Christ or Believers
[34:59] of the message that are seeing these
[35:01] signs but the world is seeing these
[35:03] signs and and by God's grace it's being
[35:06] put together for us we we don't have to
[35:09] try and search how to tie the loose ends
[35:11] together but God has given the message
[35:14] to come and bring these loose ends for
[35:16] us but we're seeing the signs in the
[35:19] heavens we're seeing signs in the earth
[35:21] and these things are all speaking uh of
[35:24] a fulfilled scripture prophecy that has
[35:27] come to pass is coming to pass and
[35:30] entirety and so it's there you know if
[35:33] we're thinking that Christian walk is
[35:35] going to be a time of no obstacles then
[35:39] we we are mistaken because even in this
[35:41] day we have to face our own Red Sea amen
[35:45] and and uh I I just want to just go over
[35:47] for just a moment my brother and sister
[35:50] and then we'll return back into our
[35:52] thought but you realize that what God's
[35:55] expectation was at the Red Sea is that
[35:58] Israel would look at the promise and the
[36:00] promise says uh that we would be
[36:02] delivered and the promise says that we
[36:05] go forth we're going back to the
[36:07] promised land but what happened when
[36:09] Israel got there that day to the Red Sea
[36:12] it looked like an insurmountable
[36:14] obstacle before them it looked like
[36:17] something too great for them to deal
[36:19] with and in that part their hearts
[36:21] turned to stone they they become
[36:23] paralyzed and they looked at that and
[36:25] they said there's no way that we can
[36:28] cross this but little did they know my
[36:30] brother and sister that God had already
[36:33] provided the way for them to cross what
[36:35] he was looking for was a people that
[36:37] would actually just keep on walking they
[36:41] would say the promise matters more than
[36:43] my thinking my emotion my feelings of
[36:46] all of this and and how can it be what
[36:49] how can we accomplish this and you might
[36:52] look in this day right now and and I I
[36:54] have conversation with people and
[36:56] they're afraid for their children now
[36:58] I'm not speaking down on that but my
[37:00] brother and sister it should not be a
[37:02] fear that we have for our children we
[37:05] can be as it were a little bit concerned
[37:08] but uh the Lord said that I have not
[37:11] lost a one and our children fall right
[37:13] into that category we don't have to look
[37:16] at this and say you know what leod deia
[37:19] is going to get our children leod deia
[37:21] is going to this Le is going to that my
[37:24] brother and sister that's not what the
[37:25] promise is the promise is that he has
[37:27] given us our children and they shall as
[37:30] seed of God not go in on Mom and Dad's
[37:33] coattail but they will go in in
[37:35] Revelation of their own experience of
[37:37] who they are in Jesus Christ and so it's
[37:40] there as we Face our own Red Sea pretty
[37:42] perplexing is it not to come face to
[37:45] face whether it might be a health issue
[37:47] it might be a family issue it might be a
[37:50] financial issue it might be an emotion
[37:52] issue whatever it might be my brother
[37:55] and sister but it could be a red to you
[37:58] now the problem that happened with
[38:00] Israel is when they come up to the Red
[38:03] Sea and saw something that was in no way
[38:06] in their ability to overcome there there
[38:09] was no trees to make rafts or boats uh
[38:12] there was no go up a few miles to a
[38:15] bridge or go to here to escape but
[38:18] basically they were hemmed in and and
[38:20] we'll touch on that in just a little bit
[38:22] but they're hemmed in and what God
[38:25] really expected of them was to stand
[38:27] there and say this is an obstacle and
[38:31] God told us we're going to the promised
[38:33] land let's continue in this journey but
[38:36] they become paralyzed and they stood on
[38:38] the shore and as they're standing on the
[38:41] shore all kinds of things start to creep
[38:44] in every time Sons and Daughters of God
[38:47] Believers quit going forward we become
[38:50] paralyzed and when we become paralyzed
[38:53] faith is then locked up and is not able
[38:56] to act amen now it was the experience at
[39:00] the Red Sea my brother and sister did
[39:03] not put this doubt fear and anxiety in
[39:06] the people it actually was already there
[39:09] the Red Sea just revealed it and as we
[39:12] are here in this day and obstacles come
[39:15] in our life we find ourselves speaking
[39:17] things of doubt and fear and anxiety our
[39:20] own self I want you to realize as the
[39:22] bride of Christ God's bringing you into
[39:25] those positions to expose those things
[39:28] that are not of him that is in this
[39:30] flesh he's looking to expose our
[39:33] weakness not to humiliate us not to uh
[39:36] put us down not to uh bring us to a
[39:39] place of judgment and Discord but my
[39:41] brother and sister he's coming there
[39:44] part of the Refiner's Fire is showing
[39:46] there are certain things that we must
[39:48] deal with amen and so this experience
[39:51] they had at the Red Sea amen not the
[39:54] only time and we could go through many
[39:56] more through scripture but we'll just uh
[39:59] tie these two together they had the same
[40:02] experience in the wilderness of sin
[40:05] that's in Exodus 16:3 you'll find that
[40:08] see it was uh revealed my brother and
[40:11] sister that it was there it showed them
[40:14] what was happening and you know for some
[40:16] they never got over it they never ever
[40:19] outgrew the fear and anxiety their view
[40:22] of what God was supposed to do for them
[40:26] uh was was uh co-mingled with their
[40:29] ideas and actually a lack of faith or
[40:32] Revelation they are there thinking this
[40:34] God's going to make this just a a few
[40:36] days we're going to be in the promised
[40:38] land and because God was going to take
[40:42] the fear anxiety and unbelief out of
[40:45] them now I want you to think about the
[40:47] fact it took 40
[40:49] years that's a lot of labor on God's
[40:54] part to finally root out
[40:58] fear anxiety unbelief from
[41:01] Israel something that one good Revival
[41:04] now let me put it this way one good
[41:06] Revival meeting and one trip to the
[41:08] altar saying Lord forgive me could have
[41:10] dealt with that instead it took 40 years
[41:14] to break through the nature of Israel
[41:17] they had so long been in their tradition
[41:19] so long in their ideas of who God was
[41:22] that it took a long time for God to get
[41:25] this out of them and so it's there this
[41:28] Wilderness of sin we'll see many times
[41:31] for sake you you know the scripture but
[41:34] through the Wilderness of sin God
[41:35] allowed them to be thirsty allowed them
[41:37] to be hungry he allowed a lot of things
[41:40] to come serpents and all kinds of things
[41:43] to come trying to get the people to
[41:45] finally exercise their faith and I pray
[41:48] my brother and sister my original title
[41:51] uh was going to be on what is hindering
[41:53] us amen but I I something encouraged me
[41:57] take the positive route here because we
[41:59] are making progress Can someone say Amen
[42:02] on that amen we are making progress we
[42:04] are not where we were even a year ago
[42:07] maybe not even six months ago we are
[42:09] making progress in Sons and Daughters of
[42:12] God Amen so it was revealed what was in
[42:16] them and at that place my brother and
[42:18] sister I would have to say what is being
[42:20] revealed in
[42:22] us can we just stop for a moment tonight
[42:25] and just think about it what is is being
[42:28] revealed in us I believe I'm talking to
[42:32] the salt of the earth real sons and
[42:34] daughters of God Holy Ghost filled
[42:36] Christians with a desire and I say Lord
[42:38] let be revealed in us as David said in
[42:41] Psalms 51 created in me a clean heart oh
[42:45] God renew a right Spirit within me it
[42:48] tied it resonated brother Alex the song
[42:50] that you sung tonight amen cuz we my
[42:53] brother and sister are coming to the
[42:55] place it's not a matter of what I did I
[42:58] I I I I might have done wrong but I know
[43:01] how to correct it and I
[43:04] do amen I might have come short but I
[43:08] know by Revelation what God expects and
[43:11] how to get me to the place I need to be
[43:13] I don't throw my hands up you don't
[43:15] throw your hands up we don't say God
[43:17] you're asking too much of us but we
[43:20] stand here in a position saying yes I
[43:23] may have come short today but Lord I'm
[43:25] going to rise up in the morning morning
[43:27] you're going to renew my spirit in the
[43:29] morning and I'm going to press forward
[43:31] in this battle and Lord you are going to
[43:35] create in me a clean heart and you are
[43:38] going to renew you're going to relight
[43:40] the fire that is in me amen I tell you I
[43:46] I don't know maybe I'm out of line to
[43:48] just admit this but I tell you the Lord
[43:50] relights the fire quite a bit amen
[43:53] there's times that that you just the
[43:55] struggle of life just burns it right
[43:57] down to nothing and we think that the
[44:00] fire is going to go out and Satan is
[44:03] here to tell you good old Pharaoh he's
[44:06] here to tell you you're
[44:08] trapped but you're not because God comes
[44:12] and relights The Fire And We rise up
[44:14] again with something burning in our soul
[44:16] and we say Lord forgive me for my
[44:18] failure but Lord I'm going to press to
[44:20] that Mark and I'm going to keep pressing
[44:22] to that Mark and every time the Fire
[44:24] gets dim God is there to pour more oil
[44:27] in amen and relight the fire now what
[44:30] happened with Israel and what is
[44:32] happening in the very day that we live
[44:34] in is people are actually Israel become
[44:37] spiritually paralyzed on one hand they
[44:40] had 400 years of cries to the Lord for
[44:44] deliverance and God comes to deliver it
[44:47] instead of it being a Revival that
[44:50] brought forth life now my brother and
[44:52] sister these are a people that believed
[44:54] enough to put Blood on the lentil
[45:01] but not
[45:03] enough come on let me can I belabor that
[45:05] for just a minute I'll I'll it end up
[45:07] taking a little longer it would take
[45:10] Faith to believe the blood of a lamb
[45:14] placed on the lentil of your door with a
[45:17] common weed of Egypt would be enough to
[45:21] keep a death angel from visiting your
[45:24] house that took faith
[45:27] amen but they didn't have enough
[45:30] Faith to step out in the
[45:34] water that little
[45:36] journey some
[45:39] Dynamic
[45:40] why oh pardon me because it would be
[45:44] kind of silly in the thought but no line
[45:47] of greyhounds pulled up and they got on
[45:49] and in a few hours they were in the
[45:51] promised
[45:53] land they got hot they got tired now the
[45:57] word says their shoes their clothes
[45:58] never wore out but it didn't say
[46:00] anything about their feet
[46:09] hurting they become spiritually
[46:11] Paralyzed by the time they had made that
[46:14] short Journey to the Red Sea they
[46:16] actually become spiritually
[46:20] paralyzed now my brother and sister the
[46:22] word of God has come in our day and In
[46:24] God's Time piece it's been a very short
[46:27] time that this renewed word as it were
[46:29] restored word is the word I mean to use
[46:31] has been here very short time and in
[46:34] that short time look where it t has
[46:36] taken us from the absolute undeniable
[46:39] Supernatural to we're not even sure if
[46:41] this is true or
[46:43] not this is the effect that happened on
[46:46] Israel as they were leaving Egypt God
[46:49] coming this day and said I promis to
[46:52] restore the word and deliver you back to
[46:54] your rightful position a spirit promised
[46:57] land for the bride of Christ and in my
[47:00] brother and sister I don't know I didn't
[47:02] do the math I'm going to call it 75
[47:05] years it's winter we don't even know if
[47:08] this is true or
[47:12] not you see it's no different my brother
[47:15] and sister there was great
[47:18] revivals starting back in the day there
[47:20] was great revivals people crying out
[47:23] they wanted a move of God and God come
[47:25] on this scene and has delivered them and
[47:29] then the years have went by this journey
[47:31] has come and they have met obstacle
[47:34] after obstacle it wasn't just simply the
[47:36] Rapture will be tomorrow and praise God
[47:39] we were able to believe for a week or
[47:41] two or a month or a year but God is now
[47:44] going on and the people are starting to
[47:47] question this and they're coming against
[47:49] obstacles and they say now look I'm just
[47:51] going to speak blunt there are those
[47:53] people right now at this very moment
[47:55] stumbling because some someone said
[47:57] brother brandham said that Billy Paul
[47:59] would be a young
[48:04] man and Billy Paul's
[48:07] gone I'm not going to interpret what if
[48:10] that was ever said it's not for me to
[48:12] interpret I didn't hear it I don't know
[48:15] but what I do know is God said I'm going
[48:17] to deliver you into a promised land and
[48:20] I'm going to keep walking and I'm going
[48:21] to keep believing can we believe that
[48:23] amen that it doesn't matter what these
[48:26] other peripheral real things are it
[48:28] doesn't matter what was spoke here or
[48:30] what was done there what matters is is
[48:32] whether we are going to keep walking and
[48:34] believing the word for this hour and as
[48:36] we stand on that word my brother and
[48:38] sister God had a plan and we'll get into
[48:41] this thought here in a minute God had a
[48:43] plan he's got a plan for each and every
[48:45] individual and because I brought up
[48:48] brother Billy Paul I say God had a plan
[48:50] for brother Billy Paul he's got a plan
[48:52] for you and I my brother and sister but
[48:55] the plan for you is not necessarily
[48:58] hinged upon
[49:00] me it's hinged upon our belief of the
[49:04] word it's hinged whether we're going to
[49:06] keep walking or will we become
[49:08] spiritually
[49:10] paralyzed amen and what happens is is
[49:13] this spiritual uh uh paralyzation uh uh
[49:16] people lose their vision of it and and
[49:19] what happens at that time there's no
[49:20] more spiritual
[49:22] growth and you know as well as I do that
[49:24] we cannot live on a past
[49:33] experience dealing with a man one time
[49:36] in the struggles that he was
[49:38] having I asked him when's the last time
[49:41] you read your
[49:42] Bible it had been several years
[49:46] past my brother and sister spiritually
[49:49] paralyzed there there was there was
[49:51] something there he just couldn't
[49:53] overcome he just couldn't couldn't bring
[49:55] himself to to to engage in and then
[49:58] there's no more spiritual growth and
[50:01] when there's no more spiritual growth
[50:02] the confession
[50:04] changes I'm telling you there's
[50:06] something about the word that speaks to
[50:09] the heart that causes you and I to have
[50:12] stimulation that comes forward amen the
[50:15] Revelation comes forward and it stirs
[50:18] our heart and we remember and it causes
[50:21] us to dig in but if you come to a place
[50:23] of being spiritually paralyzed amen
[50:27] there is no growth the confession
[50:29] changes and just like Israel at the Red
[50:32] Sea doubt fear anger impatience starts
[50:36] to be manifested and I tell you Satan's
[50:39] working the same plan today he's right
[50:42] here today we are in this Exodus Journey
[50:46] we are in the wilderness of sin we are
[50:49] here in a time that Satan would love to
[50:51] wear you down amen does anybody feel
[50:54] tired tonight amen I think about half
[50:57] the hands probably go up or maybe all of
[50:59] them would go up tonight amen Satan
[51:01] wants to wear you down because he's
[51:03] recognized there's a condition between
[51:05] the flesh man and the spiritual man he
[51:09] recognizes that if he can afflict us in
[51:11] one form it will impact the other and
[51:14] it's there that is coming Satan working
[51:17] this same plan today Pharaoh's plan
[51:20] failed you know why he didn't account
[51:23] for God's plan Satan had his plan and
[51:27] Pharaoh had his plan not accounting for
[51:30] God's plan looking at that amen and so
[51:34] as is Satan's failing today because he
[51:37] is not accounting for God's plan and the
[51:40] reason he's not accounting for God's
[51:42] plan is while he can read the word just
[51:44] as well if not better than you do he
[51:47] does not know God's individual plan for
[51:51] every life amen we're seeing different
[51:53] people and not to emphasize on this but
[51:56] we're seeing people that walked away
[51:58] years ago that they were in drugs they
[52:00] were in alcohol their lives are a mess
[52:03] and they have come back and repented and
[52:06] come back before the Lord and ask for
[52:07] forgiveness and are doing their very
[52:10] best day by day to serve him that
[52:12] certainly wasn't in Satan's plan but it
[52:14] was God's plan God knew that they would
[52:17] take that Journey he knew what kind of
[52:20] Red Sea and Wilderness of sin they would
[52:22] face know what kind of serpent that they
[52:24] would encounter in the wilderness and
[52:26] and God said I've got a plan already in
[52:29] place and it will not be
[52:32] hindered amen now brother Bram says here
[52:35] in the seed shall not be air with the
[52:38] shuck and both of these scriptures are
[52:41] out of
[52:42] 1965 and I I try not to make uh
[52:46] tremendous emphasis on dates but my
[52:49] brother and sister I believe there was a
[52:52] special anointing on the prophet's
[52:54] ministry as it come down you see at this
[52:57] point this date right here April the
[53:01] 29th I believe b stands for
[53:05] breakfast brother brandham didn't know
[53:07] he was going very shortly going off the
[53:10] scene God knew God knew the plan God had
[53:14] it all in order Amen brother Bram says
[53:18] here and Seed shall not be air with the
[53:19] shock so many times people sympathize oh
[53:23] and I read a book not long ago on the
[53:26] silent God give by some of these modern
[53:29] philosophers who try to turn you away
[53:33] from God if you don't know the word of
[53:36] God did you catch that if you don't know
[53:39] the word and the plan of God you can be
[53:43] easily shook but when you see God's plan
[53:46] his program then by faith you know it's
[53:49] God God identifying himself doing just
[53:53] what he did in other times walking and
[53:57] proving amen I want to know has God
[54:00] proven his plan to you amen over and
[54:03] over again right not just once looking
[54:05] back 20 years ago well that's a little
[54:07] far for some of you but whatever the
[54:09] space would be not us looking back in
[54:11] history let me put it that way oh God
[54:14] proved himself once to me we serve a God
[54:17] who proves himself every single day he's
[54:21] proving himself his majesty his power
[54:24] everything my brother and sister every
[54:26] every single day if we're
[54:31] cognizant if we're watching if we're
[54:35] listening
[54:39] amen that's the reason Moses could not
[54:42] be
[54:43] shook aren't you glad Moses wasn't
[54:46] shook amen CU if he'd have been shook
[54:48] imagine what the whole program would
[54:50] have done amen I'm glad the prophet
[54:53] couldn't be shook he had his ups and
[54:56] downs isn't that so beautiful I don't
[54:57] know about you but I'm really happy when
[54:59] the prophet tells us about his flaws the
[55:02] world out here that's as a reason not to
[55:03] follow him I tell you that's a reason to
[55:06] follow him because I have so far in this
[55:09] life well today started off reasonably
[55:15] well I know you guys think like this you
[55:18] know today is going to be one of those
[55:20] Flawless
[55:21] days today is going to be a day that I'm
[55:24] going to think every thought correct I'm
[55:27] going to every action is going to be
[55:29] perfect I'm going to be just a shining
[55:32] example
[55:35] right I didn't get a very enthusiastic
[55:38] response out of that no sir we're human
[55:41] we got up this morning amen first thing
[55:44] out of bed I stubbed my
[55:46] toe that's the way to start your day
[55:50] amen look my brother and sister God was
[55:54] there we didn't have have to be perfect
[55:57] he's perfect we have to be in his plan
[56:01] we have to desire to be in God's perfect
[56:04] will but if we were capable of being in
[56:06] his perfect will all the time God would
[56:08] never have given permissive will but we
[56:11] should not spend our time trying to live
[56:13] in permissive will we should be focused
[56:16] on perfect will and say Lord you know my
[56:18] heart that's where I want to be I might
[56:20] be living in the moment right here but
[56:23] right there is where I want to be and
[56:25] that's where I'm going to stri and labor
[56:27] and push and press to the mark of being
[56:29] in the perfect will of God not just a
[56:32] halfhazard
[56:40] life
[56:45] amen that's the reason Moses could not
[56:47] be shook he talked face to face with God
[56:50] and God told him I am the one that was
[56:53] with Abraham back Yonder I'm the one
[56:55] that's made this promise I'll be with
[56:58] you how are you going to stop a man then
[57:03] that man then how are you going to stop
[57:04] that man that said how how's how's the
[57:07] devil going to stop you guys tonight
[57:09] when you're sitting here knowing that
[57:11] God called you before the foundation of
[57:13] the world and you confess that you don't
[57:15] just throw it out halfhazard but you
[57:17] believe it can someone lift your hand
[57:18] and say I believe that then I was in
[57:22] Christ before the foundation of the
[57:24] world and how can Satan come and then
[57:27] Rob or stop you from that right there
[57:30] you hold on to that and you know that
[57:32] you was in Christ and he's in you now
[57:35] amen the devil might trip you might
[57:37] stumble you I know none of you ever say
[57:40] things or act out in ways that you're
[57:42] embarrassed about but my brother and
[57:44] sister when you do do that you can stand
[57:47] and say you know what I have an advocate
[57:49] I've got a lawyer he's the best lawyer
[57:52] ever amen there's not a lawyer on the
[57:54] earth an advocate on the earth that
[57:57] meets my Advocate that can defeat my
[57:59] Advocate because he was perfect in the
[58:02] beginning and he's perfect now amen and
[58:05] there's our confidence that we can stand
[58:08] amen we don't have to come and hope it's
[58:11] no longer a time for we as Believers to
[58:15] sit here and hope that we make a Rapture
[58:18] it's time for us to bring our confession
[58:20] and say I'm Rapture material already
[58:24] being manifested this body is already
[58:27] being changed into the very image of
[58:30] Christ what he called me to be I am
[58:32] being molded into that and sometimes it
[58:35] takes
[58:38] adversity I figured I'd hear an
[58:41] amen sometimes it takes adversity but we
[58:44] don't like
[58:46] adversity I'm not sure I can even spell
[58:49] adversity amen how you going to stop
[58:52] that man then as the prophet of old said
[58:55] when the lion Ro who can but fear and
[58:57] God has spoken who can but prophesy when
[59:01] we see the things that God promised at
[59:04] this
[59:05] hour the prophet wasn't speaking back
[59:07] into history he was talking this hour I
[59:11] say tonight Saints let's not talk back
[59:14] into history our own self but this hour
[59:18] right here right now what God is doing
[59:21] what he has promised to you and I amen
[59:24] don't let's not look back into that now
[59:26] I'm not saying that we don't look back I
[59:28] believe we study the message we study
[59:30] scripture we study history but we don't
[59:33] live on a vision from Days Gone By we're
[59:37] living in a very present tense Vision
[59:39] where God is showing a people what it is
[59:42] going to be and what it is right now and
[59:44] what it's going to be as a bride of
[59:46] Christ in this
[59:48] day brother bradam says that we've moved
[59:50] out of
[59:52] leoda now my brother and sister we have
[59:54] to be careful when we take those things
[59:56] to really put it in the correct order so
[59:59] we don't frame it incorrect ourself amen
[1:00:02] this is a spirit of Le to see you out
[1:00:05] here but the bride is moved into a realm
[1:00:08] of another spirit amen now we could
[1:00:10] simplify that and say the bride has the
[1:00:12] Holy Ghost but you'll see my brother and
[1:00:14] sister the impact of the Bride being
[1:00:16] filled with the Holy Ghost puts her in a
[1:00:18] whole different world out here amen I
[1:00:21] I'm not here to judge anyone of what
[1:00:23] they do but you'll find as time goes on
[1:00:26] the things you liked you like less and
[1:00:29] less and the things you desire grow
[1:00:32] greater and greater and greater and
[1:00:35] that's the effect of the word on you in
[1:00:38] this day not talking about what happened
[1:00:40] back in the denominational days of
[1:00:42] Pentecost some really good things some
[1:00:44] really incredible things as a child I
[1:00:47] got to witness some of those things but
[1:00:49] my brother and sister I can't go back
[1:00:51] and live in
[1:00:53] Pentecost I can't go live in that day
[1:00:56] we're living in a day that God's
[1:00:57] revealed the word to the bride and so
[1:01:00] you can call it if you want that's the
[1:01:02] way the prophet puts it it's the bride
[1:01:03] age it's a Time the bride is coming into
[1:01:06] this maturity because she's not looking
[1:01:09] back she's took the promise that God
[1:01:11] gave and she's now turned and looked to
[1:01:14] the Fulfillment of that promise she
[1:01:16] didn't look at the Red Sea she didn't
[1:01:18] look at the Wilderness of sin the
[1:01:19] serpent the no water being hungry she
[1:01:22] didn't look at all of that stuff she
[1:01:24] looked and said there's a promise and
[1:01:26] that promise was given to me amen and to
[1:01:29] my children and those that are a far off
[1:01:31] and we believe that and we're not going
[1:01:33] to be sidetracked because we had an
[1:01:45] obstacle when you see the things that
[1:01:47] God has promised at this hour see it
[1:01:50] unfold how can you stand still when you
[1:01:52] see that his way what he said it would
[1:01:56] happen see all the mysterious things
[1:01:59] that's just exactly the way God said it
[1:02:02] would take
[1:02:04] place we're seeing my brother and sister
[1:02:06] now you now people would say you can add
[1:02:08] all these things together if you want
[1:02:10] but that's fine I'm not putting such an
[1:02:12] emphasis on anyone but there's down in
[1:02:15] California go do your
[1:02:17] research areas there the scientists are
[1:02:21] saying wow this piece of real estate is
[1:02:23] sliding towards the ocean
[1:02:27] just natural event people are worried
[1:02:28] about their insurance they worried about
[1:02:30] their homes crumbling they're worried
[1:02:32] about their life Investments they're
[1:02:34] they're they're not looking at coming of
[1:02:36] Christ they're not looking at word
[1:02:39] fulfilled they're looking at the fact
[1:02:41] that from the street to their driveway
[1:02:44] is now over
[1:02:47] 12et and slowly
[1:02:50] separating they're looking at life being
[1:02:53] disrupted they're looking at cares of
[1:02:55] Life they're they're looking at all of
[1:02:57] these things like this nature they're
[1:02:59] not tying it together my brother and
[1:03:01] sister but God's got some people that
[1:03:04] are looking at the whole picture and
[1:03:06] realizing God is fulfilling his word it
[1:03:10] is coming to pass right as we speak
[1:03:13] today amen now we look at this my
[1:03:16] brother and sister uh this
[1:03:19] Revelation now all not all Revelation is
[1:03:22] is deep spiritual things my brother
[1:03:25] sister the prophet of God saying
[1:03:27] California is going to slide in the
[1:03:29] ocean you realize he was sharing a
[1:03:33] revelation he was sharing what a Time
[1:03:36] piece would
[1:03:38] reveal when he was speaking of these
[1:03:41] things my brother and sister science was
[1:03:43] still saying oh we have some earthquakes
[1:03:45] and we have this and we have these
[1:03:47] situations but you know
[1:03:50] now I don't spend a lot of time looking
[1:03:52] at this but I do spend a little time
[1:03:54] here and there my brother and sister you
[1:03:57] just go study all of the the
[1:04:01] um
[1:04:03] uh people that study the Earth
[1:04:06] geologists all of that and every one of
[1:04:09] them agrees there's coming a big
[1:04:13] one there's coming a big one and when it
[1:04:16] does it's going to displace land mass
[1:04:20] like we've never
[1:04:24] experienced well good that's on one side
[1:04:26] over here prophet of God says that you
[1:04:29] won't be here does that make any of you
[1:04:32] happy amen you know you don't have to
[1:04:35] you know go through that experience that
[1:04:39] now if God's going to fulfill it in
[1:04:42] Earth will he not fulfill it in the
[1:04:44] heavens there's a great war that is
[1:04:47] coming they believe that it it is just
[1:04:49] no way around it taking place in the
[1:04:53] Middle East uh uh all of these things I
[1:04:57] don't want to get into all this
[1:04:58] geopolitical stuff but but China is
[1:05:01] rumbling and saying you know we we think
[1:05:04] America that we could take
[1:05:10] you the prophet of God says those bombs
[1:05:13] are hanging in the hangers just
[1:05:16] waiting how long do they
[1:05:18] wait but even greater than that lest we
[1:05:23] would get so consumed and be afraid
[1:05:26] is the fact that the revelation of the
[1:05:28] fact that judgment doesn't strike this
[1:05:31] Earth until the bride the wife is in the
[1:05:37] house amen isn't that amazing look at
[1:05:41] the progress we're making my brother and
[1:05:43] sister we're no longer out on the porch
[1:05:44] hoping we're going to be the Bride of
[1:05:46] Jesus Christ the word is common dealing
[1:05:48] with the heart speaking to us causing us
[1:05:50] to change I I don't want to embarrass
[1:05:52] anybody so I'll let you just answer it
[1:05:54] to yourself have we
[1:05:56] changed are we still changing God is
[1:06:00] pulling us my brother and sister into
[1:06:02] his presence and it's not a force that's
[1:06:05] causing it to do it but he's wooing us
[1:06:07] like a lover like a a you know one
[1:06:10] that's moving forward into a
[1:06:12] relationship they don't force that to
[1:06:15] happen but they bring it in such a way
[1:06:17] that there's a desire to enter into that
[1:06:20] and God is speaking to you and I through
[1:06:22] this because this revelation of who
[1:06:25] Jesus Christ is now I'm going to speak a
[1:06:28] little direct I hope you don't mind but
[1:06:30] my brother and sister when you see this
[1:06:32] day people in the message make an
[1:06:34] argument that God's off the Judgment
[1:06:36] seat if he's in your
[1:06:41] heart where does this come
[1:06:44] from I'll tell you what it does it
[1:06:48] becomes a Red
[1:06:49] Sea where people spiritually don't go
[1:06:52] any further forward because they don't
[1:06:54] know how to back bence that if Christ is
[1:06:57] in me that means he's off The Mercy Seat
[1:07:00] but yet the quotes are right there in
[1:07:02] front of him and you'll see just as it
[1:07:04] been through the ages that one will see
[1:07:07] amen and one will not see amen Cain and
[1:07:11] Abel and we can go right on down through
[1:07:13] the scripture that one sees one has
[1:07:15] Revelation one cannot but the prophet of
[1:07:18] God over and over again and church I
[1:07:20] hope you believe this the prophet said
[1:07:23] that the mercy seat is in the heart
[1:07:25] heart of the believer amen it's not out
[1:07:28] here somewhere it's not out in the
[1:07:30] Revelation in the denomination world but
[1:07:33] it's in the heart of the believer and
[1:07:36] the heart is being reunited or tied
[1:07:39] together with Christ closer every single
[1:07:42] day can we say Amen to that every day
[1:07:45] we're being drawn closer into his
[1:07:47] presence amen this Revelation is
[1:07:50] unfolding before our eyes now in the God
[1:07:53] of this evil age
[1:07:57] amen and notice Cain he didn't want no
[1:08:00] blood sacrifice you know that's
[1:08:04] messy I always found it entertaining the
[1:08:06] people that will eat it after you kill
[1:08:09] it but they could never bring themselves
[1:08:11] to kill it
[1:08:13] themselves there ought to be a law
[1:08:15] against somebody that' eat a steak but
[1:08:17] they'd be
[1:08:19] unwilling to create or so to speak make
[1:08:22] that themselves that was just personal
[1:08:25] please
[1:08:27] don't he didn't want no blood sacrifice
[1:08:30] he come down and offered the fruit the
[1:08:32] fields of beauty upon his altar very
[1:08:34] religious done everything that just
[1:08:36] exactly abble done offered a sacrifice
[1:08:39] fell down before God In Worship obedient
[1:08:43] in every way but without the revelation
[1:08:46] of the
[1:08:50] word my brother and
[1:08:53] sister everything
[1:08:56] without
[1:08:59] Revelation this why the prophet of God
[1:09:01] it says you should pray for Revelation
[1:09:03] it's that important pray and I won't ask
[1:09:06] you to lift your hands but I I pray that
[1:09:08] you're praying for Revelation because
[1:09:11] it's Revelation that brings this alive
[1:09:13] to us and it doesn't become
[1:09:21] history that wasn't too offensive was it
[1:09:26] and the Word was from the beginning
[1:09:28] God's plan well brother
[1:09:32] Paul how do I know God's plan for my
[1:09:38] life it's right
[1:09:42] here you know really before you ever ask
[1:09:45] the preacher for advice or your friends
[1:09:48] for advice you should ask him for
[1:09:52] advice because he has already given
[1:09:55] the advice that we
[1:09:57] need amen and sometimes well I tell you
[1:10:01] what I maybe you've experienced this
[1:10:04] I've had issues before church issues not
[1:10:06] Paul issues Church issues and I'm like
[1:10:09] Lord what do I do what do I do what do I
[1:10:11] do and I fret and I finally finally got
[1:10:13] down and just like Lord what do I do
[1:10:15] started praying Lord I need an answer
[1:10:16] from you and I opened my
[1:10:20] Bible there's the answer yeah that's the
[1:10:23] kind of God we serve amen amen aners
[1:10:26] already on the way Amen in fact it's
[1:10:30] been here a long
[1:10:32] time and the Word was from the beginning
[1:10:34] God's plan but God revealed by
[1:10:37] Revelation the very thing that he
[1:10:39] Vindicated punctuated that that was
[1:10:42] right not religion not an
[1:10:46] altar not belonging to church not making
[1:10:50] a sacrifice not being
[1:10:53] sincere but by the revelation of the
[1:10:56] word of God God revealing to
[1:11:00] him what that it and quote goes on you
[1:11:03] have the reference you can go ahead and
[1:11:05] read it amen you see my brother and
[1:11:08] sister we could take
[1:11:11] this my I'm going to sound just really
[1:11:14] negative but I don't mean it that
[1:11:17] way we can be quite religious in the
[1:11:22] message quite religious
[1:11:28] and there's a lot of emphasis in a lot
[1:11:29] of
[1:11:31] church and I don't speak ill of that but
[1:11:33] their altars fill up every
[1:11:43] service and I know a young lady she's
[1:11:45] not so young
[1:11:47] anymore she's never got married because
[1:11:50] she hasn't found a young
[1:11:52] man that will attend her
[1:11:59] church because she believes her church
[1:12:01] is the one that's going to get the bride
[1:12:04] in the
[1:12:05] Rapture so maybe it was best that some
[1:12:09] young
[1:12:10] man I I'll I'll just stop right
[1:12:14] there
[1:12:18] and I could share with you a little
[1:12:20] story but but I'll keep it very vague of
[1:12:23] a couple used to be very very very dear
[1:12:25] to Jerry and I they threw their whole
[1:12:28] life into every activity that their
[1:12:30] Church did now some of you ought to try
[1:12:33] that but they just poured themselves out
[1:12:37] poured themselves out and when that all
[1:12:39] come
[1:12:41] apart that was really what they were
[1:12:44] serving not God they were serving their
[1:12:49] Church thinking that that in and of
[1:12:52] itself was serving God but the prophet
[1:12:55] says you know that's not the answer and
[1:12:59] um I hope you all don't mind
[1:13:02] but I know a whole bunch of people that
[1:13:04] are way more sincere than you are did
[1:13:07] that cut very
[1:13:10] deep don't want it to cut deep right I
[1:13:13] can back it up with a quote right
[1:13:16] prophet of God talks about there'll be
[1:13:19] people more sincere than
[1:13:22] you so sincerity in itself is not going
[1:13:25] to get us
[1:13:31] there and this sounds really really I
[1:13:35] had a man tell me once you're
[1:13:38] arrogant I'm sorry word of God says it's
[1:13:42] Revelation and we believe because God
[1:13:45] has given us Revelation so everything
[1:13:49] that we would look at amen so it's there
[1:13:52] that a religion if if you call it that
[1:13:56] I'm going to just type it to be leaving
[1:13:57] the message amen it's by
[1:14:02] Revelation where the altar
[1:14:04] is prophet of God laid it out very
[1:14:07] clearly it's in the heart he called this
[1:14:10] what an old Baptist
[1:14:13] tradition I think we ought to use it a
[1:14:15] little more than we do but but I'm not
[1:14:17] emphasizing that and the church being
[1:14:20] our identity my brother and sister we
[1:14:22] belong to that church amen his church is
[1:14:25] a revelation of what the church really
[1:14:27] is it's a body of Believers and making
[1:14:30] sacrifices well I tell you Lord help
[1:14:33] every one of us to be more sincere and
[1:14:35] to make more of a sacrifice to serve can
[1:14:37] somebody agree with me there amen and
[1:14:39] being more I want to be more sincere I
[1:14:42] ask the Lord Lord I want to be more
[1:14:44] sincere help me Lord be more sincere but
[1:14:47] I tell you what the prophet of God never
[1:14:49] said pray for your religion pray for
[1:14:52] your altar pray for your church as far
[1:14:55] as belonging to one uh pray about your
[1:14:58] sacrifice and pray about your sincerity
[1:15:00] but he did say pray for Revelation he
[1:15:03] said ask God to reveal the word to you
[1:15:07] all the rest of this remember right on
[1:15:09] the heels of this prophet of God says
[1:15:11] Satan can
[1:15:12] impersonate everything
[1:15:16] but your church nope he can impersonate
[1:15:20] that sincerity he can impersonate
[1:15:23] sincerity amen he can impersonate all of
[1:15:26] these things my brother and sister but
[1:15:28] he cannot brother Brown expresses it in
[1:15:30] several different ways but he cannot
[1:15:32] express true
[1:15:35] love he can express love with a carnal
[1:15:40] interpretation but not true love Jesus
[1:15:44] said if you love me go to church is that
[1:15:48] what he
[1:15:49] said he said if you love me do my
[1:15:53] Commandments
[1:15:55] so real love brings us right back to the
[1:15:58] word amen that's the day now look at the
[1:16:01] progress that is coming there was a time
[1:16:03] we didn't understand the word there's
[1:16:05] times we didn't understand a lot of
[1:16:06] things but now the time has come we as a
[1:16:09] bride are coming into maturity we are
[1:16:12] starting to see ourselves in the word
[1:16:18] don't you don't you just love that when
[1:16:20] you look at that and you start to see
[1:16:22] yourself in the word oh oh my brother
[1:16:25] and sister I tell you it just stirs my
[1:16:28] heart what a contrast God is giving in
[1:16:31] this day amen and you know it's
[1:16:34] interesting because the farther we go
[1:16:36] down this journey the more it seems like
[1:16:38] it was Israel coming from Egypt we see
[1:16:41] all these signs we see people you know
[1:16:44] my brother and
[1:16:45] sister when the Brazen
[1:16:48] serpent was placed before the people do
[1:16:51] you realize that anyone who died from
[1:16:53] that day forth died of their own
[1:16:58] accord because all they had to do is
[1:17:01] look at the Brazen
[1:17:04] Serpent and they still
[1:17:08] died there were people that refused to
[1:17:12] receive their own
[1:17:15] Deliverance hard to
[1:17:17] Fathom in this hour right
[1:17:20] now there's people refusing to receive
[1:17:23] their Deliverance because they put their
[1:17:25] emphasis on something else they won't
[1:17:29] look at Christ their deliverer they
[1:17:32] won't look upon him they won't surrender
[1:17:35] to him now remember when the Brazen
[1:17:38] serpent was there there were many who
[1:17:40] looked upon it with unbelief in their
[1:17:44] heart and the Brazen serpent did not
[1:17:47] protect them from the serpent because
[1:17:50] they did not
[1:17:52] believe h i could get off on another
[1:17:55] tangent excuse
[1:17:57] me so what are we
[1:18:01] doing Exodus 14 and
[1:18:04] three Pharaoh said to children of Israel
[1:18:07] they are entangled in the land the
[1:18:09] Wilderness has shut them
[1:18:12] in this is how Satan is looking at it
[1:18:15] today get the people entangled get them
[1:18:17] overwhelmed get them
[1:18:21] preoccupied get all of this put in place
[1:18:24] we because when the people become
[1:18:27] entangled their priority of serving God
[1:18:31] declines and I don't want to embarrass
[1:18:33] anybody and I'll tell you the busier I
[1:18:36] get the less I
[1:18:40] give hate to put myself out as example I
[1:18:43] would have rather used one of
[1:18:45] you but um it's the truth Satan knows if
[1:18:49] he can get us all
[1:18:52] entangled that then we have only so much
[1:18:56] strength so much ability so much and I
[1:18:59] don't know about you is it okay to be
[1:19:01] transparent you won't be shopping for
[1:19:03] another Pastor because yours must be
[1:19:05] backslid because he said what he
[1:19:07] said but I tell you there's times in our
[1:19:10] life we get so focused on the
[1:19:13] natural that the spiritual just Fades
[1:19:18] back and I'm probably the only one here
[1:19:21] tonight that can actually get so in
[1:19:25] Tangled I
[1:19:27] forget to read my
[1:19:34] Bible That's what Satan
[1:19:37] wants that's what he
[1:19:40] desires get him entangled get him
[1:19:42] overwhelmed get him
[1:19:44] preoccupied but I tell you my brother
[1:19:46] and sister and in spite of every flaw
[1:19:48] that we would admit tonight amen Satan
[1:19:52] did not account for God God and once
[1:19:55] again the Lord ordained that song To Be
[1:19:58] Sung amen relight the Fire Lord come
[1:20:03] relight the Fire Lord amen I love you I
[1:20:06] adore you I'm serving you I want to
[1:20:08] serve you even greater Lord but
[1:20:10] sometimes the fire just gets real low
[1:20:13] Lord just come and relight that fire
[1:20:16] light the fire in me once again it is
[1:20:19] not us being backslid my brother and
[1:20:21] sister but it is there Us in the battle
[1:20:24] and God comes and says you know what I'm
[1:20:26] going to light that fire again and I'll
[1:20:28] relight it as many times it takes to get
[1:20:30] you to the place you need to be amen you
[1:20:33] know what happens in God's plan for us
[1:20:36] Satan's trying to to get you to turn
[1:20:38] back has any of you ever been tormented
[1:20:41] with a spirit that says just
[1:20:45] quit Hard One to admit in public is it
[1:20:48] not a hard one you know especially when
[1:20:51] you got friends that turn and walk away
[1:20:53] and they're telling you a thousand one
[1:20:54] reasons why you should walk away and how
[1:20:57] much better life is
[1:21:00] without
[1:21:03] H
[1:21:06] yeah I finally got smart and learned how
[1:21:09] to block them or somebody blocked it for
[1:21:11] me but you know when you get somebody
[1:21:13] that's just constantly telling you that
[1:21:16] they praise you on one side you're a
[1:21:17] good preacher it's like yeah he doesn't
[1:21:19] know what he's talking about but you
[1:21:22] should do your church a favor and and
[1:21:24] just move them over to Christ and leave
[1:21:26] the message
[1:21:29] alone you listen to that long enough
[1:21:32] those thoughts will echo in your brain
[1:21:35] you will struggle to drive those
[1:21:38] thoughts away and that's what Satan's
[1:21:40] doing he's trying to weave the web to
[1:21:43] entangle you but I'll tell you my
[1:21:45] brother and sister Satan's plan did not
[1:21:47] account for God's plan amen all the
[1:21:50] cobwebs and all of the dust bunnies and
[1:21:53] everything that the world can place in
[1:21:55] your life amen the holy spirit will come
[1:21:58] and sweep them right out and I'm going
[1:22:00] to make an emphatic statement to you
[1:22:01] tonight my brother and sister we cannot
[1:22:05] turn back amen the bride of Christ with
[1:22:08] the word of God revealed in them there
[1:22:10] was no provision the Lord said I will
[1:22:13] lead you and guide you that means we
[1:22:15] have to abandon the Lord if we're
[1:22:17] turning back amen and he said this work
[1:22:20] I've begun in you I will finish amen so
[1:22:23] it's God to stand in that position and
[1:22:26] say Lord I just simply don't believe you
[1:22:28] I don't believe that you're going to
[1:22:30] finish this work I don't believe that
[1:22:32] you're leading me or guiding me but my
[1:22:34] brother and sister that's not the
[1:22:35] anointing on you and I as a bride of
[1:22:37] Christ somewhere in this whole picture
[1:22:40] you and I were stirred to say amen I
[1:22:43] believe that and when you said that it
[1:22:45] unloosed every Power Of Heaven to come
[1:22:48] down to you and to touch your life amen
[1:22:52] now I'm going to ask you a little chore
[1:22:55] why don't you just let your confession
[1:22:57] lead you into the promise of our day
[1:23:00] amen let's stand up and say you know
[1:23:03] what I'm a
[1:23:04] Believer amen I believe this word I'm
[1:23:07] going to say Amen to this word and then
[1:23:09] let that confession or profession just
[1:23:12] lead you into the promise of our day
[1:23:15] because you see if we'll stay away from
[1:23:18] that negative confession amen the
[1:23:20] prophet of God Called It Satan's
[1:23:22] confession amen we stay away from that
[1:23:26] okay let it come fiery trials I'm I'm
[1:23:29] finishing maybe sister via in a second
[1:23:33] here you don't have to rush amen fiery
[1:23:36] trials anybody had
[1:23:39] any nobody I don't see a hand oh okay
[1:23:43] yeah that was uh action
[1:23:48] required fiery
[1:23:50] trials have you ever just felt so
[1:23:52] overwhelmed you just felt uh for better
[1:23:55] vocabulary you just felt wiped
[1:23:57] out do you know God already factored
[1:24:00] that
[1:24:01] in that wasn't a surprise to him I see
[1:24:05] my daughter I see my son looks like
[1:24:07] they're just been hit by a steamroller
[1:24:10] that's too bad I should have made better
[1:24:12] plans for him no sir he already factored
[1:24:15] that in amen a Red Sea already in the
[1:24:19] plan Wilderness of sin already in the
[1:24:22] plan amen
[1:24:24] and we haven't gone through all this to
[1:24:26] quit I'm so proud of my sister Sue I've
[1:24:29] known her seems like my whole life but
[1:24:31] you know her her confession that she she
[1:24:34] shares is I've come too far to quit now
[1:24:37] amen I say amen sister Sue come too far
[1:24:41] to quit now amen we didn't come down
[1:24:44] this far just to turn around and say I
[1:24:46] think I'm going to see if I can make it
[1:24:48] back to Egypt I'm going to see if the
[1:24:50] Red Sea will work in reverse
[1:24:54] the Wilderness of sin maybe God will
[1:24:57] reain Mana down on me so I can go back
[1:24:59] to where I came
[1:25:05] from do you realize we went through all
[1:25:08] of
[1:25:11] this to bring us to the
[1:25:14] place that we recognize Jesus Christ in
[1:25:18] our
[1:25:20] midst we recognize that he's our peace
[1:25:23] he's our Comfort he's our
[1:25:27] security he's our healer our
[1:25:30] provider we recognize everything that we
[1:25:34] are our very existence is Jesus
[1:25:38] Christ these
[1:25:41] trials imagine what kind of people
[1:25:43] Israel would have been if they went from
[1:25:46] Egypt to the promised
[1:25:49] land you know what they would have
[1:25:52] become slaves
[1:25:55] to something
[1:25:57] else and that's a little bit direct but
[1:26:00] you see what Satan's trying to do he's
[1:26:03] trying to get you and I to become a
[1:26:06] slave to something
[1:26:10] else but our lord Jesus already
[1:26:16] provided but nowhere you guys might help
[1:26:19] me I'm not the brightest boy on the
[1:26:22] Block I searched the
[1:26:25] scripture for the plan or provision for
[1:26:29] us to go
[1:26:31] back it's not
[1:26:33] there God made no
[1:26:36] provision for you and I to go
[1:26:41] back and he said I'm going to lead you
[1:26:43] and guide you and that didn't mean he
[1:26:44] was doing a U-turn out in the wilderness
[1:26:46] somewhere to take you back if we believe
[1:26:49] he's our leader and our guide my brother
[1:26:52] and sister let's just follow let's just
[1:26:54] keep it simple
[1:26:57] amen and then I close it out with this
[1:26:59] statement when the people decided that
[1:27:02] they would rather be back serving the
[1:27:04] Egyptians you notice that Moses never
[1:27:07] caved in and gave him
[1:27:11] permission amen if a prophet was
[1:27:14] standing here
[1:27:16] today and he might acknowledge things
[1:27:18] are definitely worse than they were in
[1:27:22] the 60s
[1:27:24] you think he's going to offer us a ready
[1:27:27] made excuse for us to
[1:27:29] exercise I do believe he would say the
[1:27:33] same exact thing only believe all things
[1:27:38] are possible and if we apply that my
[1:27:41] brother and sister and you start
[1:27:45] looking you know in this scripture God
[1:27:47] I'm closing sister VI if you'd come um
[1:27:50] you notice in the scripture that in
[1:27:52] several places through the
[1:27:55] times they put up I I've been reading
[1:27:59] out of time tested memorials and you'll
[1:28:02] see that that God anointed them Brother
[1:28:05] David Nash preached it right here in
[1:28:06] this church I still remember the service
[1:28:08] very well they were those that were
[1:28:11] called anointed of God and as they
[1:28:13] crossed over Jordan they picked up a
[1:28:16] stone and They carried it up out the
[1:28:18] other
[1:28:20] side and they put them together and they
[1:28:23] said why are we doing this and this
[1:28:27] right here is when your children
[1:28:31] ask you have an answer for
[1:28:36] them amen parents
[1:28:41] grandparents we need to have an answer
[1:28:44] for our children a Godly answer a Godly
[1:28:48] example this is a sign we come out of
[1:28:51] Egypt we had a Red Sea we had a
[1:28:53] Wilderness of sin we had serpents we
[1:28:55] were hungry we were thirsty this
[1:28:57] happened and this happened and this
[1:28:58] happened but we crossed Jordan right
[1:29:02] here and entered into the presence of
[1:29:05] our Lord Jesus Christ this is it amen
[1:29:10] have we made progress we started in
[1:29:12] Egypt I don't know about you but I
[1:29:14] started in Egypt amen some of you are
[1:29:17] good Godly folks never made it out there
[1:29:19] but the Lord allowed me to make it to
[1:29:21] Egypt and then he brought me out
[1:29:24] and it hasn't always been the best
[1:29:26] Journey not nothing to boast about I
[1:29:28] remember a brother telling me one time
[1:29:30] he says you know some brother some
[1:29:32] pastors are like oh yeah we love your
[1:29:34] testimony share your testimony and one
[1:29:37] day a brother approached him afterwards
[1:29:38] and says brother is that all of your
[1:29:41] testimony he said are you kidding the
[1:29:44] rest of it I can't even say in
[1:29:46] church but it's his
[1:29:49] testimony it's the mark of the progress
[1:29:53] of what God has has done in you and I I
[1:29:56] don't even care I don't even care to
[1:29:59] talk
[1:30:00] about what I've done what happened out
[1:30:04] there in those years those times I'm not
[1:30:07] really I'm not really interested in that
[1:30:10] but I want to tell you what God's
[1:30:11] brought me to I want to tell you where
[1:30:14] where progress was made and how my life
[1:30:16] has been changed and how God is proven
[1:30:18] himself over and over again because my
[1:30:21] brother and sister this is the time for
[1:30:23] us to measure and put our our uh uh

[1:38:38] on streets of purest gold oh the next
[1:38:43] meal could be the marriage
