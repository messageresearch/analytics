you alone amen I believe that tonight I believe that he is appointed that now hey man let's just stand together we'll have a word of Prayer [Music] our heavenly father Our Father Hallowed be thy name we know that your name is present because you're here Lord in your elect bride your name is not a far off it's not a historical name it's a present tense name The Living Word the Living God Among Us manifested before us may you manifest yourself into greater measure to his sword personally and individually tonight speak to our hearts open up your will to us let us go into a deeper depth and a higher realm than we've ever come before we know that your bride being the final voice to the final age under her messenger your Prophet said she's speaking up a rapturing out to those that have ears to hear and able to receive the word she's speaking of rapturing up to our higher Realm and we've ever lived before Lord Jesus we thank you for this we commit ourselves to you I give myself to you as just a vessel of your service I'm expecting you to speak your thoughts and to bring this message in the way and to form you desire to bring it and may there be Open Hearts to receive it and may the power of hindrance and the power of the enemy be broken and Lord as we here to are here not to hear a man we are here to receive you and to hear from you sanctify my lips sanctify our thoughts now to your purpose and and your your doing and reveal to us your word as we ask this now in thy name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen while you're standing if you turn your Bibles to Psalm 139 I want to read that scripture we read last time I think it was last time I ministered and kind of carry a little further with that but it's not a part three or two or three it's just I want to title this tonight bride material bride material and with that that's the title but with that bride material the Eternal thoughts of God his redeemable thoughts the Eternal thoughts of God his redeemable thoughts amen Psalm 139 starting with verse 15. my substance we know that faith is the substance the Bible said now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen for my substance was not hid from thee When I Was Made In Secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when yes yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o God How great is the sum of them amen I'd like you to turn me to Philippians chapter 2 I trust you prayed for the service and that you've asked God to speak to your hearts tonight we get in the busyness of the day and we need to take time out don't we Prophet said if we just get alone meditate upon God he said and and get our thoughts upon him he said we'd be a lot less nervous that's what he said we'd be a lot less nervous amen than we are amen amen all right so I pray that you prayed because I'm depending on him to speak amen I Know The Enemy would like to to fight this substance that was in God to begin with you know God spoke faith that's the substance we're speaking of when he thought of you and put it in word form amen then it was himself being manifest Philippians 2 verse 5. let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus let me read that again let this mind be in you which was also say mind was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God bless his word he may be seated that word form in Philippians 2 and 6. means amorphy that word form in that scripture there means in morphe let this mind be in you with who being in the form of God or in morphe it's the same God all the time just changing his form in morphe just changed or changing his mask to enact to an act which were in a great drama how many know were in the end time drama amen and we've arrived to the end time the prophet said the opening of the seals identified we were at the end time and we've arrived he said and it's the formation now so we see God in a form today amen we see we saw him in a form yesterday when he was manifesting Jesus Christ now he still manifests in Jesus Christ but in another form amen and so his word his thought his his form he changes his mask now as we we have it uh told to us in the message invisible union he said now it's God in Bride form amen not another God same God in Bride form the bride as he said in that message it's the bride coming he said of Christ amen it's the bride coming of Christ another portion without that you wouldn't have the full revelation of himself amen because we have to go right back to what it was in the beginning Eve was not another another uh she was another form but she was in another form of Adam it was Adam I should you want to reverse that it's Adam in another form it was Adam expressed in another form it was still a part of himself he was both male and female it was not another spirit that went into Eve it was his spirit amen it was it was it was not another it was not another flesh it was his flesh but in another form she was flesh of his flesh bone of his bone she was the mystery of Adam revealed she was the she was the Capstone of creation amen because Adam was without Adam was alone he would not good that man should be alone God was expressing himself and in him he had thoughts he had his heart purpose God's heart purpose was to have a bride of his own choosing that was his heart purpose we could just realize that statement that was God's heart purpose to have a bride of his own choosing so he said he said now so it's bride it's the bride coming of Christ and that's what the Bible has been it's been a work of God that's been covered up I just said my our my substance my substance was was hid or was it hid if my substance was he formed me he made me he doesn't make any junk he was I was fearfully and wonderfully made then when did he make my substance he had he had to express something and in our day that we live I'm getting a little head let's back up here so it was covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world the work of God's been covered up has been hid since the foundation of the world and and its Sevenfold what's been hid he said and that's what the Bible has been it's as the Bible has been the work of God that's been covered up now just stop and think about there's mystery in that word that God was was manif was speaking about through the word but it was still a hidden Mystery but it couldn't be unveiled until the Sevenfold mystery or the Seven Seals were opened and he said and he said it's and and it's been hid it's been hid the Bible's been hid since the foundation of the world and and that and that work of God and it's Sevenfold Mysteries been hid and God promised in this day he said at the age of this laodicean church he would take the mask off of the whole thing he would take the mask off of the whole thing and we could see it we would it would be unveiled to us we could who's we he's talking about he's talking about and let me just say this he's talking about watch carefully now and see this I'm quoting out of the church AIDS book The Bride was already in his mind before the foundation of the world before be when was God just an eternal he wasn't even God yet until he created something to worship him but he was eternal spirit and in him was what the bride was already in his mind and we covered last time I ministered yes she was she was existing because substances is something that's an actual existence that's substance so she was existing in his mind she was substance in him she wasn't a mess she was an imagination is something he had conceived that was a that was absolutely in his mind to be spoken amen amen and he had in order for it to come to Creation it had to be expressed amen and that's the word all right so so he said but but when it was just when it was just himself Eternal himself the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts she was substance because substance as I said let me just go back here that which has actual existence is the definition of substance that which has actual existence so she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not what about those thoughts they're Eternal are they not he said they are real he said they are real amen they're not they're not just something that that he imagined they are real they were existing they were living they were in him and he wanted to express himself amen amen so he said we he said the Eternal thoughts of God which were those Eternal thoughts we are those Eternal thoughts of his bride were the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season or another place of prophesied in their decreed season well this is your decreed season you're here for one purpose that's to express God himself in the form that he said it would be in so who being in the form of God Amen let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God amen now that's the bride amen that's him today all right you say you're getting pretty you're getting far out Brother David you're getting too deep no that's not too deep it just takes Revelation to see the Simplicity of it because when it's revealed to you it's more simple than you can imagine or even think about simplicity Simplicity is something that's revealed to you if it's going to be hit in you he hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself out through the same all right so he so it's been hit something been hid and God promised in this day that the mask would be taken off and we could see it so who's we those Eternal thoughts of God what a glorious thing God in morphe mask in a pillar of fire god A morphy and A Man Called Jesus God in morphe in his church God above us God With Us God in us the condescending of God now it's God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person the same person amen Hallelujah all right all right let's go to First John chapter 5. first John chapter 5 the Lord begin actually reading chapter 5 and let's take verse four to start with here for whatsoever is born of God anybody born of God born of who God how did he birth his people how did he bring you to New Birth the prophet said by the spoken word that's how he brings us to birth that's how he bursts his seed is the word spoken you're in the season to receive it and to hear it now we're coming to that more in just a moment so whatsoever is born of God what is the new birth Brother David what is the new birth it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and what is the baptism coming upon determines the birth of God it has to fall on the seat of God amen all right because you can you can have the baptism the genuine baptism a person could have the genuine baptism in their spirit and be anointed by that Spirit but not the word and the soul amen that's right and remember the soul controls the bot the spirit and the spirit controls the body is that right so what's in the soul is going to control the spirit amen so you see in first John 5 again that whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory this is what is the victory what's birthed and this is the victory that overcometh the world our faith remember the faith of God in you is the believer brother Brown said that perfect Faith he said the faith the believer is the faith of God that's in you that's the believer he said that's the True Believer amen all right first John 5 again verse 11. and this is the record that God hath given to us this is the record that God has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son is that right this life is in his son he that hath the son he that you can't have the son without the seed is that right because when the seed was expressed that was God manifested in flesh which made Jesus the son amen are you with me that was God the son God above us God With Us where is he now same God all right so he said now it's God in us now he says in verse 11 this is the record that and he that verse 12 he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life so it's already something he had it just needed to be unveiled express it needed to become to life amen amen all right now Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he lived in a world that no one other words he lived in an atmosphere he lived in a world amen he lived in a dimension he lived in a in a in a realm that no one knew about and yet he was a man all right he was an odd person you know you know oddball amongst the Pharisees the religionists of the world and the religionists of the age claiming to believe the message he was an oddball okay he was an oddball he lived in a world or an atmosphere here again a realm of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was let this mind be in you which was also he being in the form of God thought it now robbery what about the form where is the form of God today it's not another person it's Jesus Christ but where is the form of God today where is he manifested you say well the message the message was the Met where's the message where's the message the message has got to be somewhere it didn't leave when the prophet left the message he sent it to the bride he said the bride under her messenger would be the final voice then where's The Voice what proceeded out of the mouth the prophet went somewhere and it had to go into the heart of the Bride because the bride he said would be the final voice not another voice just the final voice then what would she be she'd be saying the same thing that God said through his Prophet The Bride would be saying the same thing and then the spirit and the bride say come on all right so he said so he said here he says he had he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was if we lived in perfect in a in a perfect faith and perfect faith is God's faith it's not another Faith perfect faith is God's faith Hebrews 11 1 is perfect faith it's not an intellectual faith amen it's not intellectual intellectual faith will get you nowhere but when you have God in you that's God living his life through you that's God's faith amen and he will reveal himself because the action of God living in you the evidence of himself living in you is that he would reveal the word for the season to you you would receive the word for the hour you'd see it amen you would see it's here it's present tense it's uniting time amen let us be glad to Rejoice the marriage of the Lamb has come amen the evidence of Yuri of the Holy Ghost in you is not shouting not dancing not speaking in tongues not emotion not a feeling it's the revealing of this word in you personally lived out through you amen we'll come into that more I just kind of jumped ahead there a little bit but this he said if we lived in a perfect faith of a of a Christian to what we are what are we we came from the same Source he did what are we who are we we must have it we must be the same brother random said the real you the real we the real you he said is the spirit of God in you it's not this outer man it's the you inside the you is the spirit of God that's the birth word I appreciated the songs Tonight speaking of such love I pray that after this service you would see such love that God would have for you that once he made a decision of you and had you in his thinking nobody no devil no enemy is going to take you out of his thoughts he can't remove you hallelujah amen all right so he said if we live in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are and Faith what is Faith what is faith brother Brown said faith is something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation then the Revelation is substance it's not something you imagine it's not an intellectual conception it's absolutely something you know and you possess it's real and it's substance amen and nobody can move you out of it take you away from it what if it's revealed to you it's substance it's himself revealed in you it's who you are that's the believer all right so he said you'd he you'd be if you lived if you lived in the perfect Faith to what you are or what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what if forbid you would not do you would be a Mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they're a Mystic that people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves well it sounds like you're just pretty selfish you know it's not selfishness it's Unity of one God in you you and him and he and you you know how what have any other and if there's really True Fellowship it would be fellowship with him and you and him and I and him and you would have Fellowship because his two pet folks if two people in one ship that's real Fellowship amen it's the fellowship under the revealed word for the hour and the time Christ in you and Christ and me now we have Fellowship because our fellowship is with him with Jesus Christ the son of God that's our fellowship first John 1 says that all right so so we see here that so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world praise the Lord there's a veil that's dropped it's isolated the world can't get to you amen right the devil can't even reach to you he can't get to you amen you're hit away he can't come to you because if he does he comes through the blood if he comes through the blood he's my brother he's welcome where I'm at right but he can't come through the blood can he he can't do it because the blood contains the very literal life of Jesus Christ and that's the token and he can't receive the token he can't manifest the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen only the anointed word can do that the Messiah of the age the Messiah of the time can manifest the anointed word for that age amen all right now so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith all right substance Faith he's entire he's he is isolated from the entire world it becomes a new creature a new creation all things have passed away the new creature is that Faith or God's Own promise that he had in himself it's himself revealed in you that's the new creature you are he comes to Quicken his own word he comes to Quicken his seat what separates the bride from the rest is that they are the predestinated seed that's what come predestinated by God eternally is that seed when you recognize you're that seed you're Christ you're nothing else that's your position that is your identification amen it's not the flesh man it's not my mistakes it's not my ups and downs my failures that has nothing to do with that inside of the inside man you've come alive you're alive you're living God never had another thought about you well they failed I guess I can't no it doesn't that's not what he's judging you by e he already knew you he said I knew you before the foundation of the world others come to him and said haven't I preached Heaven I've been anointed haven't I cast out devils and we all believe in casting out Devils but you can cast out Devils still not have the word inside the soul to receive and to hear the promised word for the hour amen but if that word's inside you I guarantee you it'll cast out a devil and the word preached under the anointing or or revelation of the hour will already cast out a devil right here and tonight right here in this audience right now because the words going out the word for the season is being preached and Devils tremble they hate it amen why because it's the material of God what is this right material it's bride's substance amen amen we're getting a little bit let's go further here all right now you become a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material let me read this again when a man lives by faith walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world becomes a new creature in Christ now you're getting into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each of us not just the pastor not the deacons not just the trustees that means for the laity every individual amen walks in a world with God Alone amen you're baptized into his kingdom there's nobody in there but you and God he gives the orders you pack them out amen how's he giving the order he reveals it to you and you carry it out you're the branch you're energized by the mind you're bringing the fruit in its season right and you carry it out you're the body amen all right whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on this the same now you're coming into perfect faith you're coming into perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never failed brother Brown said another place that Faith knows no hindrances and that Masters all circumstances what are you going to bring the circumstance under your feelings your reasoning no the word the word the word of faith amen you bring it under the word it's written what is what was Jesus referring to it's written what is referring to himself his position it's written what did he use to conquer the enemy it's written thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God amen all right he said now you're coming into perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails and he was a Mystic to them with this perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith so somebody's going to have perfect faith they are a Mystic to others so the word material material means substance it means other meanings but the meaning were and I I looked that up to you sure it's the the another word for material is substance so bride substance what's the bright substance God's Own all right now Faith is the substance of things hoped for what is it also the evidence of Things Not Seen you don't see the Holy Spirit but you have the evidence amen you have the evidence of himself what he said the evidence would be he doesn't reveal and open his word to everybody he opens it to his bride because only the elect we were seed and therefore we were reborn this is the prophet's words we were seed therefore we were Reborn for only the elect can be reborn just the elect bride the only one going in the first resurrection is the bride the rest even though they can be same material are you hearing me 25th chapter of Matthew this the foolish virgin was same material same material same but they didn't have oil to do what they were remnant of that material but God chose out that material made it cut to her and amen are you with me the material I'm talking about cloth what she was clothed with what she was clothed under was the same that material was good material clean material Sanctified material but God made a choice when he put the pattern to it and took the bride which was a portion of the material and set it as his bride and we'll come more into that if the Lord allows me to bring out some things later on but not tonight amen so he so there's a there's a part that's bride that does not go through the tribulation and there's a part that's tribulation saint that does but she gets eternal life at the white Throne judgment I'm talking about tribulation Saints amen the bride's setting their judging her book has already been written it's already unveiled the book for the bride is unveiled to her now she's judged sinless she's judge eternal her judgment is the open book and those names which are people are written in that book amen in fact The Book of Life only con contained Book of Life and Book of Life Book of the living is the same book amen same book but but there's a portion of that book that's the bride portion amen and that bride portion amen is what's that that record that I just talked about right there he's given us a record and that record is eternal life amen and how do you know it's a new living because the word for the hour is revealed to you you see it plainly you see it and the word identifies it and you're seeing it yet you can't give it to somebody else that's why we can preach this live it and they think well somebody they're just they're just they're just a little off in their head you know we don't understand they're so Mystic anyway let's go on all right I said let's literally go on those Eternal thoughts are now manifest in flesh those Eternal thoughts which are now manifest in flesh are the sons of God all right you are you are himself as we said in another form all right material is substance I want to just bring this I'll just bring this to you right now so you remember it concept a concept is something conceived in the mind and we'll come to that in just a minute conceived means to form a device or a plan also conceived means to become pregnant with a child what did he say about the bride today was she pregnated with what an eternal child is that right amen amen amen all right I'll just leave that right there for a minute under the under the message called identification to Lair California the only thing the only thing he was was eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts it's God's thoughts made manifest by his word now listen I know I'm reading here but I just want you to catch this it's just my way of ministry I I just unless I just got to get it to you one way or the other amen and that's up to God to do it that way all right now it's God's thoughts made manifest by his word and brought to a reality now the word was in the beginning before it was a word a word is the thought made manifest and God had to think it before he could make it a word then he spoke the word and it materialized all right so what would that word that word that was his thought remember these thoughts that we're talking about are Eternal thoughts in other words they're the thoughts of God the prophet said this and I read this but let me just read it again to you he said this he said in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself of being tangible or becoming material he thought of himself being that when he thought of you he thought of himself becoming tangible material substance manifest in flesh and all he had to do was say Let There be let there be and so in this hour when the prophet when he spoke his word through a prophet he said let there be and here you are what what was in you to receive that word to hear it to be able to receive it to manifested in this hour see you had an ability to hear the word all right and so in order to do that God himself had to conceive his thoughts that's an exact statement brother Brown said God when he saw his children Adam and Eve and he said they were they were lost he didn't want to leave them that way so he said he conceived the thought this is what I'll do amen he conceived it okay now what is it and the Word was materialized God had to think it very make it a word he spoke the word and materialized what is it it's God all God becoming tangible and you are a part of God and Jesus don't miss this now this is this is what I want to speak here the redeemable thoughts he said and Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was what did he come to redeem those that were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he said it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem so what did he come to redeem his thoughts of you when he thought of himself he thought of you that's what he come to redeem that's what he come to buy back he had the purchase you are a purchased possession you are his eternal possession you are his kingdom what is the kingdom of God it's the word made spirit in you made life in you amen it's in you it's not a public show the public doesn't know anything about this it's the seventh seal and the public doesn't know it they can't know it it's not to them it's to the bride brother Brown said that's the only one the secret was revealed to was the bride the only one that could receive the secret the only one that knew it amen amen you say Brother David how many is in that number that's none of my business I just know I'm one of them because I see the evidence of what he said would be manifesting it through me not something I pump up and work up one day and if I'm in church I'm okay and if I'm out I'm different it's not that at all it's him it's him revealing himself he isn't basing it upon your actions your your mistakes your failures he's not judging you by that he's not judging you by the way of the flesh he took the Judgment of your judgment in his flesh that's finished you're not coming to judgment there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh I don't care how many mistakes you make you're not walking after the flesh if you're in Christ Jesus you walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the spirit that wrote the word the spirit that brought the word when he the spirit of Truth is come he'll lead you into all truth there's your evidence I'll bring these things that I've spoken to your remembrance and reveal youth to think reveal to you things that is to come he said there's brother I said that's the genuine evidence right that you were in God's thinking because God's unveiling himself and you're able to receive it glory to God Amen that's it you have the ability to hear not everybody has the ability to hear go back to church age book and see what he said around Bob 145 to 160 or so see what he said about the evidence many other places I got a few places right here the Lord allowed me to get to it but the words materialized so what did he do it's all God becoming tangible see that's what he come to redeem was his own thoughts and them as soon as it strikes them they see it because the life is in there amen the life is in there see it was the thought brother Brown said it was the thought then that thought become expressed and God bought bought bought back Jacob see redeem is to bring back or buy back what was already his so if you're brought if you're redeemable material you had to be somewhere to redeem back to you had to be somewhere originally you're brought back you're brought back to that position amen all right and so see and what what did come what did come from God eternally he said it was the thought he said then that thought become expressed and God bought bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed now brother Brad said it's not the person that comes free Destiny eternally it's the it's the seed but Jacob had the seed so his name it wasn't Jacob but his name was that individual that had that seed that person was on The Book of Life and he was redeemable product because he was God's thought and Jacob was a shyster but he watched what he desired he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God he wanted that Birthright amen that's what meant everything to him was that Birthright what was driving him to that Birthright you see God's Own thought of him Jacob what was Jacob he was God's thought what are you you're God's thought who are you who's the real you you're God's thought the express down here in the body of clay amen and what's happening inside of you have Rapture already begun it's already started you're going to a body change what's going to take you there the unveiling of himself in you the mystery that was hid in the Bible is now expressed you are the fullness of the godhead you're the fullness I mean of Jesus Christ see you're the fullness in other words when when the seventh angel brought his message it was the finished the mystery of God and you're that mystery you're that Finnish mystery the full Revelation was to come out today and you're that full Revelation you're the message of the hour you're not looking for a message you are the message we are the message we are return Ministry that's exactly what we are we are a return Ministry because the bride is the bride coming of Christ it had to come to that position in order for it to even be a meeting in the air she had to come to maturity and the and that took a Capstone message to bring her there because she has to come into that form without us they could not be made perfect you have to grow up into your position you grow up into him and The Headstone and the body has brother Branham said become one unit they're no longer Twain they're one prophecy who's going to manifest that prophecy who's gonna what what did it turn from Prophet to his prophecy who wears the prophecy you're that prophecy being fulfilled amen amen amen I don't mean to scream at you but you know me by now there you go I won't go any farther with it all right now so he read respect the birthright and Covenant if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you in the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the words revealed to you receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day there's your evidence amen amen this body the bride the bride his body is the physical body of Christ now brother Branham and rising to the son asks the question how does this Mortal body become his body and he answered it Romans 8 11 if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ shall also Quicken your mortal body and bring it subject the prophets to the word right amen that's the genuine evidence that's how this Mortal body becomes his body by the same quickening power that was in him is in you you come from the same Source he came from he was the fullness and you're a measure you're you're a spoonful but the there's no difference in chemical in the Spoonful as the measure it's the same spirit and it operates under the same faith and it knows this position as he knew his position and we grow into that position amen are you with me because that position is the Capstone now it's coming to just a fine razor edge of difference but what's the difference is the bride won't leave the word she has the revelation of that word in her it's him in Bride form and she sees it and she knows it and what's to do make her a big shot it humbles her to submission and giving him the key to every room of your heart this is his house do what this house what you want to do Lord amen I give you every room I give you the key you have the key it's laid upon your shoulders you open and you shut you just take your Liberty and go into every room within this door and go in those doors amen that's right you give him the key you give him the authority to do that that's what I want to do that's what I desire to do I won't see nothing manifest in my life but him and don't put your psychology to it think he's got to be manifested in your psychology he's going to be manifest according to his word even though I'm yelling at you well I can't be God yes it is foreign that's right you try to judge Jesus said I judge what's in that heart you're judged by the outward appearance I just was in the heart what's the heart say what's the speaking what's it living watch us everyday life well I don't have to obey that I'll take what I want leave out what I don't want even though you look just like a believer and that better be better than the real true ones I didn't get Amen on that that's the truth amen all right now I'm just going to have to skip some of this because I'm closing out on time now all right so we are that physical body and when it's resurrected it goes to meet its mate Christ Jesus says husband and wife or as king and queen it's the same material that was in that body is in the body of believers amen The Same Spirit that was in Christ is in US doing the same works how do we do the works of God by Believing on him whom God hath sent amen all right now so in the beginning was the word let me just go back here and just bring out something foreign ever come to redeem the cannon fodder that we see around professing to be Christians but he came to redeem that was that which was in God's thinking at the beginning amen all right now so he come to redeem he'd come he could save those that God foreknowledge saw in the beginning which was his thoughts of you and me look to show it's the ones that he thought of his thought is the Christian of today the thoughts before the foundation of the world is the Christian of today bring it back redeem it bring it back he was a redeemer it was God's thought of you think little you little me no one in the world could take my place nobody can take yours you being a Christian and filled with the spirit of God and before the foundation of the world seen you and note every feature you got and Jesus come to bring you back that's what Jesus was here for the Redeemer the human body to bring you back amen they had to come he had to come he had to come to be a human as a redeemer display his attributes the Savior to redeem you and bring you back to where you come from all right you was this thought from the Eternal and now it's expressed in the human being for his glory that's you bride he expressed himself in Jesus Christ it was God becoming material and what did he say now it's expressing himself into bride where's the material now amen all right now I'm wanting to get okay here we are he was asked brother Brown I was asked what would you think would be in evidence and evidence I said the most perfect evidence I can think of is love and everybody would say amen that's it that's it it's love we know God is love but that can be impersonated that's right oh yeah filial we're just going to have feel you'll think it's agape love there's only one true agape love that's God himself God himself in you is love amen that's it all right now but he said Brother Brad Manson said that sounded pretty good then I thought that sounded pretty good if a man has got love but one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out he said the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word his either neither loved nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word and then Dr Vale was saying to me that is scriptural he said because John 14 said when he the Holy Ghost has come upon you he will reveal these things to you that I've taught you and will show you things to come so there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost he's never told me anything wrong yet that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it Jesus never said when the Holy Ghost has come you'll speak in tongues he never said the Holy Ghost come and you'll do any of those things he said he will take these things of mine and show them reveal them show them to you and will show you things to come that is to come that show you things that is to come so there's the genuine evidence the Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself now I want to jump ahead here and I'm going to be closing if we go to the message in third seal let me just read what he said here this is the third seal Saint John 1 in the beginning was the word we could read the scripture you know what the scripture said in beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us amen I want to just find here what he said about that word yeah here it is in John 1 1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root from which we get our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concept a concept is a thought conceived remember I said I'd come back to that the concept is the thought conceived he said logos means the thought or concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech so in order for for what God did was he thought he had that thought but he had to put the thought into creation and he spoke it by a word he expressed that thought and that thought expressed was word all right so and now I thought expressed brother Brown says it right behind that now I thought expresses a word or words isn't that wonderful see then God conceived his thoughts he said he and what he said to about Adam and and Eve I'll take their place I'll die in their Stead amen he conceived his thought now now you know the bridegroom tree and the bride tree is the same tree but the bridegroom tree can't bear the fruit the bride tree does without the bride tree it has to Bear the fruit of the bridegroom tree he said that he's got to have the bride tree she has got to be born of the same material amen all right see it's come from the same source the word made flesh hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree same life all right now When you pray now I just let me continue reading third seal When you pray he said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelled Among Us god dwelt with this in flesh he was the word now watch what he says before it was before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created all right so God's thoughts become creation when it was spoke by a word that's when he presents it to you as a thought as something conceived then he presents it to you as a thought or something revealed the words revealed and it's a thought he presents it to is the thought his thought and it's revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it God has not changed his way or behavior I added that in there watch God has never changed he spoken in the beginning he still speaks it today all right so faith is an actual substance now watch and I'm going to try to skip over this what God in his word creation it was an object he spoke it the word was created because it was an object in God's mind it was an object in God's mind in his heart remember where the bride was she was in his mind all right it was an object of God's mind in his heart he just spoke it and it come into existence now what's this people going to do what's his children going to do see watch our maturity here to be able to realize what we are and that we can speak but what are we speaking not just a whim not just the fancy but a revelation that's where the waiting on God becomes right there because God knows how to reveal it to you yes amen is that right all right Jesus never jumped right at it brother remember the scripture said hold fast the confession of your revelation faith it's got to be Faith first amen all right now so God knows exactly when to reveal something to you as you have need of it now I'm not talking about you can't have a proper mental attitude but you hold a proper mental attitude towards God's word and he will reveal it and Quicken it in its season in time amen and bring it to pass what will the Revelation do put the word of God into manifestation when spoken amen all right now he said you have Zoe God's life in us we become sons and amateur creators whatever you see believe what you say you shall have it and he said a lot of times I could I can't hardly think myself but I'd say it anyhow a thought that I can't even think myself would come find out it did happen that way I'd say things and it didn't hardly didn't mean for it to happen that way but it did anyhow and I thought wait a minute you see when we speak anything if something is anchored in us we shouldn't speak till we believe it we should not speak until we believe it then we believe it we speak it that creative word goes out it's a part of God and it creates now brother Bradham said we have the power to create a world and go live a private life on it watch what he said you have been given the power but that power is controlled by law amen go back to see that power is controlled by law and it's called The Law of faith you can't go out and create a world and go live on it you could if it was revealed to you right but it's controlled the power's there but the law the faith controls the power amen all right so you take you take you say that it's it's controlled see it must be revealed to you or conceived first as a thought then then you speak the thought then the power Goes Forth through the word of faith and is manifest amen hold fast to the confession of our faith the Bible said in Romans 10 8 we have the word neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart which is what the word of faith amen if thou shall believe in thy heart and confess with thy mouth see all right all right now God had to think it before it became for he could make it a word amen and he spoke the word materialize we speak it just like you have to think of anything before you speak now it let's see I'm just trying to go down here he wanted to become material then he spoke a word the words materialized that's the whole picture from Genesis Revelation there's nothing wrong it's Elohim materializing so he can be touched and felt we find that in Saint John or first John 1 2 we touched him we handled him we saw him and now we're declaring him to you he left the scene but here he is the same life in us and the Bible said in verse 3 we're declaring him to you and that our fellowship is with Jesus Christ amen all right I don't have time to go back and read that you can read that first John 1 2. so Elohim materializing so he can be touched or felt in what in Bride form so now I'm I'm really closing let's stand a stand I want to read two more quotes to you here let's stand this is it now in this last day there is to come and this is a message called this day this scripture is fulfilled it's a promise and he said it's fulfilled now watch what he says here we have a lot of why you could just take go back to Christ the mystery of God revealed he had read it recently and just and just digest it unveiling of God digest it the Mighty God unveiled digested we have today god with skin on him brother sister amen and it's the son of man himself revealed all right now now in this day there's to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly what it would be would be a royal bride a super Royal seed would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed amen there is to be a spiritual bride rise up and will be the Royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and place is a promise that's given to her paragraph 5 7 that's paragraph 151 This Day scripture fulfilled Christ's the mystery God revealed paragraph 578 now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at first he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one we have a Capstone message The Head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you'll catch it what's it require the seed of God the thought amen then we see the marriage suppers of hand if I never see you again remember the marriage supper is at hand brother Branham said we are not going to a marriage we are going to the wedding supper he said the marriage is now this is the union behind the inner Veil this is the private Union this is the union between the bride and the groom this message you are this message the devil's tried to hide that from me for years but you're the message you're himself now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in his bride coming in her amen what's she what are we going to where are we going brother David she's marching she's the word Marching In step with the word stay in step with word feed on it let your heart rejoice in it Go defeating and what you feed on you become so the marriage supper is at hand if
