[31:53] because of the uh everybody traveling
[31:55] next week um there will be no Serv
[31:58] there'll be practically nobody here so
[32:01] um so no service next
[32:06] Sunday and then
[32:08] um you you going to come up
[32:11] or would like our
[32:27] good to be in the house of the Lord
[32:29] today amen real
[32:32] blessing um you know sometimes um you
[32:36] know as they say the clock keeps on
[32:39] ticking doesn't stop for
[32:41] anything you know as we look we look
[32:45] back through the years and uh God is
[32:49] faithful we see some um
[32:53] stalwart uh saints of God and their
[32:56] labors for the kingdom
[32:58] and what what they have done they've
[33:00] done selflessly they've never looked for
[33:03] any attention and uh you know in that uh
[33:08] the years just tick by and we tend to
[33:12] kind of just take things for
[33:14] granted and um you know uh today we want
[33:20] to just
[33:21] uh
[33:23] uh give a little Accolade to an
[33:26] individual in our ch church that
[33:28] probably will not appreciate me doing
[33:31] this but we are going to anyhow and we
[33:34] will suffer any
[33:36] consequences we want to acknowledge our
[33:39] sister Diane and her many years of of uh
[33:45] Devotion to our youth Sunday school
[33:49] always faithful just there her whole
[33:52] desire just has been to see our our
[33:56] children have a good foundation be able
[33:59] to uh step out into Life as we go into
[34:03] adulthood to step out into life uh
[34:06] knowing who you are young people and uh
[34:11] you know you might not appreciate as
[34:13] much as as kind of you should uh until
[34:17] you've been the one who never had
[34:19] anything like that and uh you know you
[34:23] realize that there's something special
[34:25] uh being poured out uh um and uh we're
[34:29] going to just before we go any further
[34:30] just ask our sister Ruth she had a
[34:33] couple words she wanted to share and
[34:36] sister Diane's eyebrows just shot to the
[34:38] roof uh but uh I you know we can always
[34:43] edit the the service sister Diane so
[34:47] sister Ruth if you just
[34:52] come um I just want to say this is
[34:55] really off the cuff but um
[34:58] some early memories of Mama teach in
[35:00] Sunday school I was these kids age I was
[35:03] really young when Mom started teaching
[35:05] and maybe it's even before I can
[35:07] remember but when I can remember Daddy
[35:09] was pastor and sometime it would just be
[35:12] me my brother and my sister but she made
[35:14] a point to have Sunday school and
[35:17] sometimes it was you know a few songs
[35:19] and what I sometimes I don't remember
[35:21] what she taught me but it started way
[35:24] back and then from then on um
[35:28] just is each year progressed she taught
[35:30] us as well but and then I got out we had
[35:32] a bigger assembly and we had other
[35:35] Sunday school teachers and the ages
[35:36] changed but I just want to appreciate
[35:38] her
[35:40] sacrifice Amen to to do that even when
[35:44] it was basically her three kids maybe
[35:47] you know she made a point to do that and
[35:49] it affected my life I know that now it
[35:52] it was still instrumental and and when I
[35:55] gave my heart to the Lord it planted
[35:56] those right seeds and it influenced my
[35:58] life and she could have easily said oh
[35:59] it's just my three kids I see them all
[36:01] week long you know but it was different
[36:03] in a Sunday school study it taught
[36:05] taught me what it meant right to have
[36:08] Sunday School number one and that it
[36:10] wasn't just a oh you know it's just Mom
[36:12] up there it was it was different I
[36:14] realized it was a moment that was sacred
[36:17] and it was a time where it was opening
[36:19] our hearts not only when I eventually
[36:22] gave my heart to God but for the service
[36:24] to set an atmosphere for us kids of
[36:26] reverence and I just want to say how
[36:28] much I appreciate her sacrifice and her
[36:30] willingness to do that all of these
[36:31] years and even up until you know just
[36:34] recently so um anyway I love her and I
[36:37] appreciate all she's done amen
[36:46] amen hallelujah you know it's U it's
[36:50] just a lovely thing and um when you
[36:52] think about that um you know how
[36:55] difficult it can be sometimes to fully
[36:57] express yourself if it is just your own
[36:59] children if it is just a small group and
[37:03] uh but to see the years of faithful
[37:05] Service uh is is um so important so
[37:09] incredible and sister Diane I I I know
[37:12] you'll forgive me over time but if
[37:14] you'll
[37:15] come Amen Brother David help lift her
[37:18] out of the
[37:25] chair I'm supposed to be close to the
[37:27] microphone here
[37:29] so sister Diane here is a card that has
[37:35] um many
[37:37] signatures autographs however you want
[37:39] to put that I believe each one of those
[37:42] expresses the love of the young people
[37:46] and certainly sister Jerry and I
[37:48] unfortunately she wasn't well to come
[37:50] this morning but this is is just a token
[37:54] of our love uh and uh I pray that that
[37:58] it would touch your heart um as each one
[38:01] of those give something of love and and
[38:04] this is a little gift from the assembly
[38:07] from the Saints for you to um spend any
[38:12] way you
[38:14] please and um it being what it is is
[38:18] still not monetary but it is a token of
[38:22] our love and appreciation for what you
[38:24] have done through the years and your
[38:27] faithfulness in this assembly uh may God
[38:31] bless you beyond measure
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:41] amen
[38:47] amen amen oh let's remember brother
[38:50] Roman in

[53:43] seats now before I start my little
[53:46] message that I have this morning because
[53:49] we are still in the Thanksgiving week I
[53:52] just want to take a few moments
[53:55] to give my my
[53:58] than and
[54:01] um the first things that I want to give
[54:04] is to the Lord
[54:08] amen and
[54:11] uh sometimes we forget the main thing
[54:15] and I've heard a a minister one time say
[54:18] this and it took me a second to
[54:21] understand it
[54:22] but it really stuck with
[54:25] me and this this is what he said he said
[54:27] the main thing is to keep the main thing
[54:30] the main
[54:34] thing the main
[54:36] thing is to keep the main thing the main
[54:40] thing amen amen so this morning the main
[54:44] thing for you and I is that the Lord
[54:46] chose me and he chose
[54:50] youen to reveal his
[54:54] word amen amen now we live in an age
[54:58] where at Each corner there's a church
[55:00] there's a
[55:02] Ministry but the Lord chose you and he
[55:05] chose
[55:06] us not that we're better than them this
[55:09] is not we're better they're
[55:13] better God put something in you and
[55:16] I and he knew that at the right
[55:21] moment something will spark yeah at the
[55:24] right moment when when the word of God
[55:27] will come into you it'll flourish why
[55:31] because he chose you and he chose I
[55:33] that's right and I I'm so thankful for
[55:35] that are you thankful for that this
[55:36] morning amen I am definitely thankful I
[55:40] didn't deserve it there's nothing that I
[55:42] could have done or I could do to help it
[55:45] he just did it amen and I say thank you
[55:47] Jesus
[55:50] amen the second thing that I want to be
[55:52] thankful for is the
[55:54] congregation and I'm very thankful that
[55:57] you're always embracing us with such
[55:59] warmth and you make us feel like home
[56:02] and I'm very thankful and that comes
[56:04] from from the bottom of my heart I thank
[56:06] you so much for making us feel welcome
[56:09] for taking our family in and and being
[56:12] you know supportive to us and and we
[56:14] thank you so
[56:16] much the next thing that I want to be
[56:18] thankful
[56:19] for is a Godly
[56:22] Pastor that God gave us amen I promise
[56:25] you he hasn't paid me to say
[56:29] anything
[56:30] but I want to give thanks to
[56:33] God that He gave us a
[56:37] pastor that has been there and will be
[56:40] there for us
[56:44] now it's not easy to be a pastor you
[56:47] have to leave many times your own family
[56:49] your own um whatever you do in your job
[56:52] and you have to tend to people and it's
[56:55] not easy and I I always pray for brother
[56:57] Paul and I don't say this to show off
[57:00] but I keep him in my prayers he needs it
[57:03] and and and I'm so thankful that God
[57:06] gave us a pastor amen that goes by this
[57:10] amen amen he's the one through God that
[57:15] leads us to pastures and he's the one
[57:17] that the Lord puts on his heart what to
[57:19] speak yes and and I'm so thankful for
[57:22] that amen and you know what they say
[57:24] behind every great Pastor there's a
[57:29] wife and I say God bless sister Jerry
[57:32] and and we we ask the Lord to bless her
[57:35] and to make her feel better and so she
[57:37] can be with us back in the house of the
[57:39] Lord and and we're thankful for that I'm
[57:42] also thankful for my
[57:44] family my parents that raised me in a
[57:47] Christian home I'm thankful for them I'm
[57:50] also thankful for my
[57:53] wife
[57:55] sometimes we just take things for
[57:57] granted and we don't we don't appreciate
[57:59] a lot of the times what they do but
[58:01] there's a lot of stuff that they do
[58:02] behind closed door that maybe you and I
[58:05] as husbands don't even realize and we're
[58:07] we're thankful for that I'm thankful for
[58:09] my children God has blessed us with five
[58:11] beautiful children and I pray and my
[58:14] heart's desire is that they will serve
[58:17] the Lord with all their hearts amen just
[58:19] like every parent wants for their
[58:21] children and I'm so thankful for them
[58:23] and I appreciate them and
[58:27] the main thing is to keep the main thing
[58:29] the main thing God gave us something
[58:34] let's not take it for granted and
[58:36] sometimes we forget and we get so busy
[58:38] with the daily chores that we have to do
[58:42] but every once in a while let's just
[58:44] stop from what we're doing and say Lord
[58:48] thank you yes that it have to be me but
[58:52] Lord I just want to say thank you you
[58:55] know sometimes we wait until our car is
[58:57] broken down to realize how important
[58:59] that car that vehicle is for us now
[59:01] every morning when you go to work you
[59:02] just crank that engine up and it goes
[59:04] right to work and it takes you there but
[59:08] let's not get to a situation where the
[59:10] car's broken down and then we realize
[59:12] how important it is let's just stop a
[59:15] second and say Lord thank
[59:19] youen thank you Lord thank you Jesus
[59:22] amen for being with me for protecting me
[59:26] for going there ahead of me you know so
[59:28] many times we walk out of the
[59:30] house and maybe it just happens that
[59:33] we're just a few minutes late or a few
[59:34] minutes
[59:35] early but we don't realize all that God
[59:39] did for us in those few minutes yeah and
[59:41] you pass by an accident on the road and
[59:44] that could have been you there's so many
[59:46] things that we don't know that God does
[59:49] behind that's right I'm thankful for
[59:51] that amen Lord I'm thankful for the
[59:53] things that I know but I'm also thankful
[59:56] for the things that I don't know amen
[59:59] thank you Lord thank you
[1:00:02] Lord this
[1:00:06] morning the title for my sermon this
[1:00:08] morning is Ruth The Chosen
[1:00:13] moabit
[1:00:15] now we all know the story of Ruth and
[1:00:18] I'm not going to spend too much
[1:00:20] time
[1:00:22] um but I do want to emphasize that Naomi
[1:00:29] and her husband and her two sons they
[1:00:31] relocated from the promised land to Moab
[1:00:34] and search for food it was a famine in
[1:00:38] the promised
[1:00:40] land and
[1:00:43] um we see
[1:00:46] that the story turns very tragic all of
[1:00:49] a sudden and her husband
[1:00:53] dies and then her two sons die
[1:00:57] now from a cardinal perspective if you
[1:01:00] look at
[1:01:01] it you know someone could say what a
[1:01:04] tragedy for this family you know um not
[1:01:08] only that her husband died but her two
[1:01:10] sons died yes what a tragedy you know
[1:01:14] and and and and from a cardinal
[1:01:16] perspective yes that's that's how it is
[1:01:20] but you do realize that everything that
[1:01:22] happens happens for a
[1:01:24] reason amen word and what people look at
[1:01:28] and say what a tragedy the Lord says I'm
[1:01:32] here amen now I'm going to start my work
[1:01:35] when everybody thinks everything is done
[1:01:37] for there's no more hope there's no more
[1:01:41] everything is done to the ground the
[1:01:43] Lord says now I'm coming amen that's
[1:01:47] God's
[1:01:48] timing that's God's timing and so we see
[1:01:51] that
[1:01:52] after her two sons and her husbands uh
[1:01:56] her husband
[1:01:57] died um Naomi comes to a point to where
[1:02:00] she says well now I'm going to return
[1:02:02] back to my land there's not much for me
[1:02:04] here I've heard that uh the promised
[1:02:07] land is doing much better now so we're
[1:02:09] we're we're going to go and she comes to
[1:02:11] a point where she's talking to her
[1:02:15] daughter-in-laws
[1:02:17] now Ora and
[1:02:20] Ruth um you know Naomi told tells them
[1:02:24] there's no more son that I can give you
[1:02:26] there's nothing more that I can do for
[1:02:28] you and and I just want to stop here for
[1:02:30] just a second and I want to analyze a
[1:02:32] little bit Ora and I want to analyze a
[1:02:34] little bit Ruth because there are two
[1:02:37] very different
[1:02:38] characters
[1:02:41] so if we look at Ora just a little bit
[1:02:44] you know her mother-in-law says please
[1:02:46] go back to your people you know go back
[1:02:49] to your gods and um you know I'm just
[1:02:53] visualizing what orfa went through you
[1:02:55] know she said well I guess Naomi doesn't
[1:02:58] have nothing to offer me
[1:03:00] anymore um you know that she did
[1:03:03] everything she could for me um you know
[1:03:06] I'm just going to go back to my old
[1:03:09] ways um you know going to go back to my
[1:03:12] own Gods that's what the Bible says that
[1:03:14] she went back to her own Gods um and uh
[1:03:18] you know she um the problem was that she
[1:03:21] still desired that old life that she had
[1:03:24] right she she didn't she didn't think
[1:03:26] Naomi has anything to offer her and you
[1:03:29] know she was thinking about her family
[1:03:31] her parents you know the way she was
[1:03:33] brought up and she said you know what
[1:03:35] that actually sounds good I think I
[1:03:37] think I might just go back to my old
[1:03:39] ways um you know and and and uh um this
[1:03:43] reminds me a lot of the people of Israel
[1:03:46] when they went out of Egypt and they
[1:03:49] came to a point where they said well I
[1:03:51] believe our lives were better in Egypt
[1:03:53] than it was here we're starving here you
[1:03:56] know there's there's nothing for us and
[1:03:57] they started talking about all the good
[1:03:59] things that happened in Egypt oh yeah
[1:04:01] you know all the food and all the things
[1:04:05] but they failed to realize that they
[1:04:06] were
[1:04:08] slaves why would anybody want to go back
[1:04:10] to being a slave right go through the
[1:04:13] trouble of
[1:04:16] working do doesn't make any sense but
[1:04:19] the Devil comes and blinds you sometimes
[1:04:22] and you know what he he does he takes
[1:04:24] the main thing out
[1:04:26] yeah it's
[1:04:29] good they forgot about the Red Sea they
[1:04:32] walked on dry land
[1:04:36] amen do you see where human being goes
[1:04:39] to they go to always the Cardinal things
[1:04:41] that's
[1:04:42] right they were talking about the food
[1:04:45] when God separated the seed that's never
[1:04:48] been done before yeah they walked on dry
[1:04:52] land right but yet they craved the food
[1:04:55] that's right
[1:04:56] they crave the
[1:04:59] food and you
[1:05:01] know there's
[1:05:03] always a Joshua and Caleb yesen thank
[1:05:07] you Jesus for that you know when
[1:05:09] everybody said well they're too big for
[1:05:12] us no there's no way there was a Joshua
[1:05:15] and Caleb that said we are what more
[1:05:18] than
[1:05:19] able not because of who we are the truth
[1:05:22] of a matter is they are giants they are
[1:05:25] big but our God is
[1:05:27] bigger we're not going with our powers
[1:05:30] with what we can do but we're going in
[1:05:33] the name of the Lord amen amen thank you
[1:05:35] Lord for Joshua and Caleb and we ask
[1:05:38] that the Lord will show us that this
[1:05:41] morning
[1:05:44] now I want to look a little bit at Ruth
[1:05:47] so we see that oral left she went back
[1:05:52] to her old ways she went back to her old
[1:05:55] Rel Religion she went back to her own uh
[1:05:59] parents her
[1:06:01] family but here's the difference in
[1:06:04] verse 14 but Ruth did
[1:06:09] what she got a hold of
[1:06:16] her now I want to ask you a
[1:06:20] question what makes one say yeah I think
[1:06:24] I'm just going to go back to that that
[1:06:26] old
[1:06:27] way and what makes the other one grab
[1:06:33] it have you ever thought about
[1:06:38] that what was
[1:06:40] it it was nothing
[1:06:43] else but our Prophet said there's a deep
[1:06:47] that's right that calls on to the Deep
[1:06:50] there was something in there that she
[1:06:53] said there's no way I'm going going back
[1:06:55] to my old ways maybe I'm I'm imagining
[1:06:58] Ruth just thinking for a second and
[1:07:00] she's like there's no way I'm going back
[1:07:03] to that yeah that's what I grew up with
[1:07:07] nothing made sense amen I was an outcast
[1:07:10] in my family everything that they said I
[1:07:13] didn't agree
[1:07:15] with and what did she do she
[1:07:23] grabbed she was desperate
[1:07:26] yes amen this was her
[1:07:30] test this was her
[1:07:33] test one left but one got a hold and she
[1:07:37] said I'm not leaving
[1:07:39] anywhere I'm desperate I'm not going
[1:07:42] back to my family that's not who defines
[1:07:44] me I know even though carnally there's
[1:07:48] nothing that you can offer me I'm not
[1:07:50] letting
[1:07:53] go amen whatever happens happens
[1:07:56] you see
[1:08:02] now verse 15 and she said behold thy
[1:08:06] sister-in-law is gone back to her people
[1:08:08] and onto her Gods return Thou after my S
[1:08:12] thy sisterin-law and this is what she
[1:08:15] answered and Ruth said entreat me not to
[1:08:20] leave thee or to return from following
[1:08:23] after thee for whether thou goest I will
[1:08:28] go
[1:08:30] now the way I'm look I'm I'm just trying
[1:08:33] to imagine in my time she didn't say
[1:08:35] well you know what whatever you're going
[1:08:38] to go I'm going to go your people I
[1:08:41] guess they going to be my
[1:08:42] people no that doesn't sound like she
[1:08:45] was desperate right right she got a hold
[1:08:48] of her she looked her in the eye and she
[1:08:50] said I'm not going anywhere wherever
[1:08:53] you're going to go I'm going to go go
[1:08:56] your God will be my
[1:08:59] God Amen she was desperate
[1:09:05] amen the other sister-in-law went to her
[1:09:07] own Gods but what did she
[1:09:10] profess your God will be my God right
[1:09:16] she knew that Naomi had something that
[1:09:20] connected with what God put inside of
[1:09:22] her yeah right mhm that little bit made
[1:09:26] sense to her she didn't leave she said
[1:09:29] this is what I've been longing for I
[1:09:32] feel there's something in Naomi that has
[1:09:35] something to do with me that the Lord
[1:09:38] put in my heart I'm not letting go she
[1:09:41] didn't have any promises she didn't know
[1:09:44] Boaz was going to uh redeem her she
[1:09:47] didn't know anything but there was
[1:09:49] something that sparked in her heart and
[1:09:51] she grabbed and she said I'm not letting
[1:09:54] go whatever this is this is mine amen
[1:09:59] your God will be my God amen
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:07] amen now in verse
[1:10:09] 18 when she saw that she was
[1:10:14] what steadfastly minded
[1:10:18] amen this is just when I was reading
[1:10:21] this it it it it just stuck with me
[1:10:27] she was steadfastly
[1:10:29] minded there was no going back for
[1:10:32] her she had something that she was
[1:10:35] holding on even though it was very small
[1:10:38] that very small something she was
[1:10:41] holding on to
[1:10:43] right and you know what the Lord
[1:10:46] did that's my bride amen when nothing
[1:10:50] makes sense she holds on to
[1:10:53] something that is very small amen
[1:10:56] because why God chose her
[1:10:58] amen God chose her and he placed
[1:11:02] something in
[1:11:03] her and now that was coming out it was
[1:11:08] manifesting amen it was manifesting
[1:11:11] praise
[1:11:13] God now I want to jump to verse
[1:11:20] 22 so Naomi returned and root the mile
[1:11:26] her daughter-in-law with her which
[1:11:29] returned out of the country of Moab they
[1:11:32] came
[1:11:34] back and they came to
[1:11:38] Bethlehem in the end of The Barley
[1:11:43] Harvest is that what it
[1:11:48] says in the beginning in the
[1:11:53] beginning amen wouldn't have been a a
[1:11:55] sad story if they would have arrived at
[1:11:56] the end of the
[1:11:58] Harvest amen what is there to offer her
[1:12:02] everything is
[1:12:03] done but they
[1:12:05] came right in time not our time but
[1:12:10] God's
[1:12:12] time how many times were we thinking
[1:12:16] that it's going to be the end how many
[1:12:18] times were we like
[1:12:19] Lord I believe this is the time yeah and
[1:12:23] God says not yet not yet
[1:12:26] amen you're going to get it wrong not
[1:12:29] yet this makes us to where we have to
[1:12:32] trust him amen not my time but his time
[1:12:37] is perfect
[1:12:40] amen amen that jumped out at me and I I
[1:12:44] say thank you God for for showing that
[1:12:46] to me she arrived right in time at the
[1:12:50] beginning of the barley Harvest
[1:12:52] hallelujah thank you Lord for that
[1:12:55] now in Chapter
[1:13:02] 2 we
[1:13:04] see Naomi is talking to uh her
[1:13:07] daughter-in-law and she tells
[1:13:10] her and Naomi had a Kingsman of her
[1:13:14] husbands a mighty man of wealth of the
[1:13:17] family of
[1:13:20] ELC and his name was Boaz
[1:13:28] and you know the Lord just reveals
[1:13:30] things at the right
[1:13:32] time I always thought that it was Naomi
[1:13:36] that told Ruth to do something to go to
[1:13:39] Boaz but listen to what the next verse
[1:13:41] says and Ruth the moabit said unto Naomi
[1:13:47] Let Me Now go to the field amen and
[1:13:50] glean ears of corn after him and whose
[1:13:55] di I shall find Grace amen and she said
[1:14:00] unto her go my daughter
[1:14:04] amen she wasn't forced to go right it
[1:14:08] wasn't Naomi's idea all that Naomi said
[1:14:11] was there's a redeemer soon as she heard
[1:14:14] that she grabbed it and she said this is
[1:14:18] my chance this is
[1:14:20] good this is my chance there's a
[1:14:23] redeemer I've heard about him but now
[1:14:27] I'm going to go meet him
[1:14:29] right and what did she do she
[1:14:33] went
[1:14:34] why because she was
[1:14:38] desperate her life depended on
[1:14:43] it they were
[1:14:45] starving oh if that doesn't remind me of
[1:14:48] myself then I don't know what reminds me
[1:14:50] right
[1:14:52] right nothing made sense right
[1:14:56] I grew up in a Pentecostal Church a good
[1:14:59] church but most of the stuff just did
[1:15:01] not make any
[1:15:03] sense right and I often said Lord why
[1:15:07] doesn't not make sense why am I the only
[1:15:10] one that believes
[1:15:12] that what's going on I just felt like I
[1:15:15] didn't belong
[1:15:19] there but when you get desperate
[1:15:25] when you get
[1:15:27] desperate that's God timing amen yeah he
[1:15:31] comes on the
[1:15:33] scene and then gives you a little bit
[1:15:35] more yeah and then he gives you a little
[1:15:38] bit more amen and then you rejoice in
[1:15:41] that but you have to get to a point
[1:15:44] where you're
[1:15:45] desperate you have to get to a point
[1:15:48] where you you
[1:15:51] see Naomi had to die
[1:15:55] towards her
[1:15:58] Gods she had to be disconnected from her
[1:16:01] other
[1:16:02] husband yeah that's right do you see how
[1:16:05] God Was preparing her way MH yeah she
[1:16:09] had to profess with her own mouth that
[1:16:12] she's not going back to her God yeah
[1:16:14] right she had to do it that's right yes
[1:16:18] God couldn't do it for her now God knew
[1:16:21] what she was going to choose right but
[1:16:23] the choice was her hers amen she had the
[1:16:27] choice yeah her sister-in-law chose a
[1:16:29] different way but she said your
[1:16:34] God will be my God
[1:16:37] Amen wherever you're going to go I'm
[1:16:41] going to go amen that was devotion amen
[1:16:45] yeah she didn't understand many things
[1:16:48] maybe she never met Naomi's God but
[1:16:52] there was something that she said in her
[1:16:53] heart go for it and you know when she
[1:16:57] told those words to Naomi I'm thinking
[1:17:00] that maybe she just stood back a little
[1:17:03] bit and she she was surprised and she
[1:17:05] said where did those words come from
[1:17:08] that's
[1:17:09] it that doesn't sound like me that's
[1:17:13] it but there was something in there that
[1:17:16] was crying amen it was crying to the
[1:17:20] word of God that's right heyen I'm so
[1:17:24] thankful for so we
[1:17:26] see in uh chapter 2 verse two that she
[1:17:30] goes and what is she hoping for she's
[1:17:33] hoping that she's going to find Grace in
[1:17:35] his eyes
[1:17:37] amen amen oh that's just a beautiful
[1:17:41] amen beautiful picture
[1:17:43] there and then I want to jump to verse
[1:17:48] eight then said Boaz unto
[1:17:51] Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not
[1:17:57] glean in another field neither go from
[1:18:01] hands but abide here fast by my
[1:18:06] maidens
[1:18:08] nine let thine eyes be on the field that
[1:18:12] they do reap and
[1:18:15] go to after
[1:18:18] them have I not charged the young men
[1:18:22] that they shall not touch thee and when
[1:18:25] thou art a thirst go onto the vessel and
[1:18:29] drink of that which the young men have
[1:18:34] drawn so we see that as soon as Boos see
[1:18:38] her sees her he's worried for
[1:18:41] her maybe she looked a little bit
[1:18:46] withered from starving maybe she looked
[1:18:49] a little bit
[1:18:51] tired but she had one purpose
[1:18:55] to find Grace in his face
[1:18:59] amen she was desperate
[1:19:03] yeah and she was hoping to find Grace
[1:19:09] now verse 10 then she fell on her face
[1:19:14] and bowed herself to the ground and said
[1:19:18] unto him why have I found Grace in thy
[1:19:23] eyes that thou th should us take
[1:19:26] knowledge of me amen seeing that I am a
[1:19:32] stranger Church who can identify with
[1:19:35] that verse am I can identify with it
[1:19:39] amen when he showed himself to me when
[1:19:43] he showed Grace now Ruth went in hoping
[1:19:46] that she's going to receive Grace but
[1:19:49] now she sees it come to
[1:19:51] fruition I found Grace in his eyes
[1:19:55] he took me
[1:19:56] in I was an
[1:20:00] outcast but I was desperate and what did
[1:20:04] he do he took me
[1:20:06] in amen
[1:20:09] right go
[1:20:11] drink go
[1:20:14] eat started feeding her she she was
[1:20:18] thirsty so he he gave her to drink
[1:20:21] that's the kind of God that I'm serving
[1:20:23] that's my God
[1:20:25] I was out there in the world minding my
[1:20:27] own business but he took me in he gave
[1:20:31] me to drink and he fed me amen praise be
[1:20:35] to
[1:20:38] God
[1:20:41] 11 and boad Boaz answered said unto her
[1:20:46] it had uh it had fully been showed to me
[1:20:51] all that thou has done unto thy
[1:20:53] mother-in-law since the death of thy
[1:20:57] husband and how thou Hast left thy
[1:21:00] father and thy
[1:21:03] mother and the land of thy n Nativity
[1:21:07] and art come unto the people thou which
[1:21:11] knowest not here therefore
[1:21:14] amen he
[1:21:16] appreciated that she left her own
[1:21:21] ways she died to her old self
[1:21:25] and she was ready for something new she
[1:21:28] was ready to go after something that she
[1:21:30] never knew before but she was chosen
[1:21:34] amen and she responded to that deep that
[1:21:37] was in
[1:21:38] there the Deep calling onto the Deep
[1:21:41] that's
[1:21:43] right the Lord recompense thy Work and a
[1:21:47] full reward be given thee of the Lord
[1:21:50] God of
[1:21:51] Israel under whose wings Thou Are come
[1:21:54] to trust amen amen she came to trust in
[1:21:59] the Lord
[1:22:02] yes amen maybe she didn't know it but it
[1:22:07] was made known to her amen you left
[1:22:10] everything
[1:22:11] behind your old ways your old God that
[1:22:15] didn't make any sense to you and you
[1:22:17] came under the wings of the Lord amen
[1:22:21] yes sir amen what a beautiful
[1:22:26] sight
[1:22:28] 14 and Boaz said unto
[1:22:31] her at Meal Time Come Thou hither and
[1:22:35] eat of the bread and dip thy morsel into
[1:22:38] the in the vinegar and she sat besides
[1:22:42] the Reapers and he
[1:22:45] reached her perch corn and she did eat
[1:22:49] and was sufficed and left so we see that
[1:22:54] she is eating
[1:22:56] now she came in at the beginning of the
[1:22:59] Harvest
[1:23:04] yeah God sent us a prophet and what did
[1:23:08] he do he looked at the bride
[1:23:14] amen a son of man revealing the son of
[1:23:19] man amen and what did he
[1:23:22] do started feeding the bride
[1:23:26] MH and what did she do she
[1:23:30] heard yeah and something in here
[1:23:35] said that's
[1:23:38] me amen amen I'm catching a hold of
[1:23:43] that this makes
[1:23:46] sense I was born for this thank you
[1:23:50] Jesus what a beautiful sight thank you
[1:23:53] Lord hallelujah
[1:23:55] amen that's
[1:23:57] right and when she was risen up to glean
[1:24:01] Boaz commanded his young man saying let
[1:24:05] her glean even among the sheep and
[1:24:08] reproach her not
[1:24:14] amen verse
[1:24:17] 21 and Ruth the moabit said he said unto
[1:24:22] me also thou shall keep fast by the
[1:24:26] young men until they have ended all my
[1:24:31] Harvest
[1:24:36] amen she was to get everything that the
[1:24:40] Harvest was to give amen that's
[1:24:44] right she arrived at the beginning of
[1:24:46] the Harvest and what was her
[1:24:49] command stay in the word of God until
[1:24:53] the end yeah right don't walk away from

[1:25:24] nothing else will amen but this word
[1:25:27] that was revealed to you and to me
[1:25:30] praise be to
[1:25:41] God and Naomi said unto
[1:25:47] Ruth verse
[1:25:50] 22 her daughter-in-law it is good my
[1:25:53] daughter
[1:25:54] that thou go out with his

[1:26:10] onto the end of barley
