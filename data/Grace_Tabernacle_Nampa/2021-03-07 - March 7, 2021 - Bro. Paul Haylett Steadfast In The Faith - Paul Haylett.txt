good to see each one brother yannick i haven't had a chance to talk to you i pray god's blessing you and getting settled in amen just good uh brother adam god bless you had a good fellowship the other day i pondered over that many times and enjoyed that and you know we just look around us the blessings god's brought brother sergey of all the schedules that he could have it could be out on the road somewhere but god's faithful and put him here this weekend for his heart's desire and i know brother trevor sister carrie or the i hope you had a good little holiday and uh you know just good to see each one and on top of that uh you know sometimes we miss these things saints but i just want to give just a blanket happy birthday if we've missed your birthday you know uh celebration we're family amen but forgive us some older folks in the family just don't remember as well and and say god bless you and i i want to give a thank you to each and every one that helped us move yesterday uh turned chaos into uh just uh from chaos to just confusion and uh sister jerry and i this morning were like where's the toothbrush where's this where's that where's a comb you know but uh praise the lord uh thank you for that sister kristen i don't know who all provided uh sister sarah provided the sugar and it was good and sister kristen provided food for us and i sister jerry and i just want to say from the bottom of my heart thank you so let's just turn in our bibles today once again thank you i enjoyed the song service the music the special it makes me happy to see this kind of talent when the lord gave out musical talent i think he skipped my household but it's good to see it in the body of believers amen to enjoy that we want to talk this morning we're going to just pull a little farther into our thought this title steadfast in the faith realizing my brother and sister that we've been given something very very special that we are able as sons and daughters of god wouldn't it be wonderful if every day was just a beautiful day with no worries but it's not so that's right and yet in all that satan can do we've been anointed with the spirit i want you to understand it's not us we would have given up let me change that we have given up but god has anointed us with a spirit that has kept us steadfast in the faith it was not us it was him it will always be him and we have to recognize that the strength and the courage that we have to stand in the day that we stand is christ in you the hope of glory this the prophet of god said god's desire is to manifest himself in you oh hallelujah just that god would come down and just strengthen us and we realize it's him the same power that led him to the cross amen is in you oh my how beautiful let's just start uh first peter 5 1 and this scripture i i could have cut it off and just taken the portion out of it that i wanted but i just felt led to start in verse one because you see maybe i'm a product of the environment i was raised in but i believe it's very important saints that let me just put it in this context we understand the plan of god the leadership of god and and his program how he put it together that we understand that to realize that god has put men in authority but to realize as we'll go into the scripture that the reason that he put that men in authority he chose the men i tell you from my heart if it was just in the man realm i would not be standing here but we do that but god puts this lovely balance oh brother george thank you even if our natural pulpit needs to lean this way a little bit amen thank you lord for balance in our lives because without that balance we would go off in an is or a tangent we would go off in a way we would come to a place that would derail us but god puts balance in the body and we'll we'll touch on that amen i'll try not preach my sermon while you're standing amen first peter 5 1 elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucr but of a ready mind neither as being lords over god's heritage but being in samples to the flock and all i can say is lord help me and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a clown of glory that fadeth not away likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yay see i love balance yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you can we say amen be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace who hath called us see i love my brother and sister when the word remind us we didn't just show up we didn't just decide i'm going to be a believer we didn't decide i'm going to this i'm going to that god called and that calling is so strong now let me just interject this in the tree by god's grace we will just try to invite to have a housewarming something uh share the blessing that god has given us and the house that we just moved into there's a giant tree there and there is a tremendous size red-tailed hawk there and and uh you can tell this hawk says this is my kingdom and when other birds come around other smaller hawks and whatever he gets up above there and circles around over that tree and this is just a hawk this is not even an eagle he circles around over that tree and he has a cry a scream and you can hear it afar off what is it that's in you and i that we respond to this call of this age you have to be an eagle to understand the eagle you have to be a sheep to understand the shepherd what a blessing it is this is not a foreign call to us this is not something that is confusion or clutter it is not something that falls upon deaf ears but it is something that we uh in a within us just say yes i understand that that's me when he said i'd call those in the last day that would respond to my word where one stands up and says i heard it thank you lord i heard that call oh how beautiful it is saints it stirs my heart but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that you have suffered a while this scripture right here just lays it all out after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you to him be glory in dominion forever and ever amen lord we just ask for your blessings upon the word of god today touch the hearts of your saints father set me aside lord speak we ask in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints as we look at this i just want to come down through these scriptures for just a minute and just to touch upon some things that stirred my heart as we were studying you know as we look at these first four verses we'll see that they're very much uh pointed towards giving an insight to the ministry's responsibility and reward and you know as we look at this it is not for the ministry to stand up and say look how important i am but i trust that through the years it's been my heart's desire and if i have failed forgive me but you see the ministry is called to be a servant to the people now that's not necessarily the guy who runs around and grabs your dessert for you and and does all these little things but simply that he subjects himself to the holy spirit for the benefit of the people it is not there to raise him up of making him a great man but would be that god by his grace and mercy would allow that man to then be as brother branham speaks he talks about oral roberts and how that they would be on the radio or television and say you know oral roberts was very known for this uh you know reach out touch your radio touch your television as a point of contact well that's really all that a minister a pastor is is just a point of contact that would be a place that we could receive and you know imagine saints that you know i don't know if you're like me then there's certain little weaknesses things of the flesh little afflictions and satan you know he pretty much has it dialed in to keep shooting the flaming arrow at your weakness and so what we don't want is to have it where we get to control the dial of what we hear because if not we would never listen to those things that struck us deep in our own weakness but it's by god's grace that we have another channel that i would say is the holy spirit and it comes down and speaks to our needs beyond our control hallelujah and i can't tell you how many times i'm here ministering and i speak something and the afterthought is oh lord that's me you see so we're not exempt from that but by god's grace we have a channel by which it comes and and god gets to deal with us and i believe you would say amen to that i know sitting on the pew myself that you hear things preached and you're like oh my lord i needed to hear that amen so as we look at this we see these first four verses uh you know kind of uh giving a direction or insight to the ministry is responsible and responsibility you know uh just to touch on that um you know the job feed the flock not control the flock not meddle with the flock but to feed the flock because verse 3 says we're not supposed to be a lord over god's heritage and as long as we remember that it's god's heritage and not ours that makes that job you might say fairly simple but you look at this now that when the chief shepherd now you know we all uh would work you might say for someone when i say well i'm self-employed but you're still working for someone and we are here under the chief shepherd so as when the chief shepherd shall appear that is the whole goal what would a man labor his whole life to be judged unworthy of the gospel my brother and sister we want to labor that we would come and receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away so we we look at this and realize how that these things uh touch upon our life uh because now i'm this is not my subject today but it's just part of these scriptures felt led to do that my brother and sister the prophet of god now this will scare you brother adam i i just had to laugh and laugh and laugh about that because they visited a church on their vacation and he's like brother paul would like it here and uh then as the people's behavior he says i bet we'll see what the the minister's like the prophet of god made that statement he says you know that the people will take on if they're not careful the spirit of the pastor well unto you saints woe unto you you take on the spirit of christ amen don't take on the spirit of the pastor because you're going to be in trouble because you see i'm that guy when the prophet of god says you need to repent every day i'm that guy amen so you look at that and realize that the influence that there is there there is a realm of influence and we want that influence to be the holy ghost we don't want it to be a man influence and we don't want it to be a man's direction but we want it to be the mind of god expressed through the word to us now brother branham says here in the uh message influence he said when a man or a woman no matter whether he's a bishop or a cardinal or whatever he might be when you begin to feel that you are self-reliant then you better begin to watch and take heed because god went won't let you go like that because he will not share his glory with anyone no sir god takes glory alone so i just put that in there as a context of where we stand amen those first four verses how there is authority there is direction one to take charge as it were but ultimately it comes down there's only one that receives the glory and we give that church to jesus christ today amen and him alone hallelujah now as we go on here i want to touch on verse 5 we'll see my brother and sister that to him be glory in dominion uh uh forever and oh i'm on the wrong verse excuse me hallelujah likewise you're younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another see look at the beautiful balance that is there that there is no great ones amongst us but we are submitting one to another and you know that means my brother and sister if i could just open this up for a minute that means we don't sit back and just witness the issues and the state of life for those around us but we enter into that because we're submitting to them so if one has a trouble we all have a trouble one has a blessing we all have a blessing amen we don't want to amen now i tell you saints this is hard because we as humans have a human nature to deal with and oftentimes we'll internalize our problems in other words i want to kind of spank you church that we will talk in the foyer of afflictions and troubles and circumstances and there will not be a prayer request touch this pulpit why will we not submit one to another and say this is my body this is my family this is the word of god made manifest amongst a group of people but we won't even share our needs but we'll talk about our afflictions did you catch that amen we won't share the need that i have a need of prayer i have a need for work i have a need for this i have a need for family uh for marriage situations i have needs for all these things but we won't share that we won't ask the body to pray for that but we'll stand in the foyer and tell one another our problems that ought not be sold if it's personal and you don't want to share it at least turn in i have an unspoken request and let the body of christ then start lifting that need up we weren't meant to go this alone are you familiar with shrek shrek is a sheep that got lost from the flock and was found living in the wilderness shrek survived the wolf the cougar the coyote the winter and everything but shrek being a good sheep had grown so much wool that it had become almost impossible for shrek to put his face to the ground to eat and to drink i'm such a good christian i'm such a good christian i'm such a good christian shrek was not meant shrek was meant to go with the rest of the flock and be sheared every once in a while shrek was meant to go and feed amongst the other sheep to have care but when shrek got lost for whatever reason shrek didn't just dry up and blow away but the shepherd or the those that found shrek says you know what we don't believe he would have survived much longer he was carrying such a burden shrek could not lay down because shrek could not get back up shrek stood 24 hours a day yay though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil i've been led to the still waters i've been led to the green pastures says nothing about leading yourself we're not called as christians to stand alone and say i can do this on my own i can do this on my own we're called to be part of a body hallelujah do you know that sharing your burdens is not a weakness it's actually a strength the weak internalize it the strong confess it because the word says confess your faults false doesn't mean your mistakes false actually interprets out into your weakness to one another i ain't doing that they're going to judge me well you get judged now you get judged later you get judged for not wanting to be judged turns out you're actually judging when you say i don't want to be judged because you're judging them not worthy to hear your case gets complicated doesn't it lord help us this is what is called unity in the body saints when we stand together hallelujah oh my how did we get on that subject yeah we subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god you see my brother and sister if we're not careful we actually can get an arrogant spirit you say how can that be brother paul how can that be an arrogant spirit because we judge god not worthy to handle our problem when we don't take our needs to the lord we're judging him unworthy or unable to deal with our situation i will deal with my situation because i don't think god is capable you say that isn't my mentality my brother paul but that is your action we're meant my brother and sister we're meant to be part of a body we're meant to be submitted to the lord amen you know as you look at this i like this verse here that uh humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of god so so you look at this when we recognize the great supreme being of god and his ability amen we just submit to that and then he exalts you in due time you know saints there's been times in my life i'll just use myself for an example so that i don't have to trying to break this habit of pointing out people then i thought that god owed me an answer now i need an answer by friday lord friday comes you have no answer did we ever recognize the fact that the scriptures taught us to cast our burden to the lord well i didn't get an answer from the lord so i'm just going to do what i think is right you didn't cast the burden off you've held onto the burden saying lord give me an answer while i hold on to the problem cast the burden i won't even this is something i haven't even my wife doesn't even know it was just a course of a natural thing of business and etc but you know you have a situation you don't know what to do you don't know what to do you know what to do and i finally in almost exasperation to myself said lord i'm done i don't care whether it turns out good bad and different i'm just done i can't deal with it and you know when friday come my phone rings and the person says i've changed my mind i'm not doing this there was my answer i didn't have to put myself in a bad situation they themselves says this is not good i'm sorry i offered this to you i retract the offer some might say well that was bad no it was good it was an answer to prayer lord do i or do i not and the prophet of god said if you have a question don't not if you have a question just press forward till you get an answer he says if you have a question don't let the lord be in control if it's meant to happen it will happen now i'm not talking about whether you go down the road and say should i put gas in the car or not it's going ding ding ding and the lights on we're not talking about those kind of things we're talking about those events of our life that we recognize make a major difference in our life do we really cast them to the lord you know it's kind of funny i i just read this little article the guy was being humorous he said you know he said when we go fishing he said it it's a lot like the christian experience we're offering something but there's a string attached lord i give you my life i want to serve you i'm going to give myself into your complete control but there is a string attached that if i don't like your answer i spoke to the the children and and grace kids the other night amen i'll just share this with the parents so if the kids didn't come home and share it with you we were talking about honoring hebrews 6 i mean not hebrews 6 ephesians 6 talking about honoring your parents and i was speaking to the kids to the children that when you ask mom and mom says no and you go to dad and say hey dad can i and you get a different answer you're just honoring your parents because when parents are married husband and wife the scripture says they're now one and we were just speaking to the children about no means no if mom said no then you ought to spank your kid for asking dad now this is let me let me get back up some of you don't believe in spanking so let me just back up you you should punish your child in some form or fashion you can ground him like electricity you can put a hat and shove him in the corner whatever your method is but if your kid asks mom and gets a no and goes and asks dad and gets a yes the parents ought to look at each other and say we stand together and they ought to punish that child because they're dishonoring disrespecting because they've now tried to separate mom and dad from being one back into two again with different opinions all those who kids are grown up or don't have kids are like amen and all those who have kids are like well but you see there comes a time we we've got to set a boundary and a no from mom ought to be as good as a no from dad and the prophet of god teaches us a no from god ought to be just as good to a son or daughter of god as yes is because what happens when we set a culture where no is not good enough our child will then go and we'll just take it this way our child will go from mom seek an answer from dad and when they don't like the answer from dad and as they're growing up remember these are all potential teenagers and you're training them their teenage behavior is actually settled when they're this tall and so when they don't like mom's answer they go to dad they don't like dad's answer they go and they'll find a boy or a girl that will tell them the answer they want and then that boy or girl will have more authority in their life than the parents will just look in the world around us i'm speaking from experience from witnessing to see these things we need to come to the place now what happens is why are you bringing this out brother paul because when god tells us yes then we should stand on that yes and let no one convince us of no and when god says no don't let anyone come and say god's answer should have been yes amen we ought to stand on the word of god and the no is no that's what we were teaching the kids the other night no means no it shouldn't matter which parent it comes from amen and now if i'm meddling in your families plea forgive me but we need to teach our children that mom and dad are not two with different opinions mom and dad are one and that when you have the answer yes then yes means yes and if you have the answer no no means no because otherwise we'll come and we'll constantly second guess god amen i don't like the no lord there must be another answer forgive me for meddling i feel so much better that's off my chest so if nobody's happy when we leave church today brother paul will be amen yeah yeah so you see we have to cast our care upon him before because he cares for us so we can't put a string to that care we just got to cast it you know you got to just toss that out there and say lord you're in control whatever is going to happen in the future lord i know that you have my best interest in mind problem is oftentimes we think god doesn't have our best interest in mind you say no i would never say that brother paul you wouldn't say it but your actions say it hallelujah amen now he tells us here to be sober to be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh bowel seeking whom he may devour we know that scripture do we not let's get get over here we know that scripture we've heard it we've heard it we've heard it we've heard it right satan's going around of who he can devour he's looking to devour be careful young people satan's gonna devour you be careful teenagers satan's gonna devour you i heard that a lot when i was a kid it was like the the stick you know that was like get back in line get back in line get back in line who's lying who's lying because i'm talking to sons and daughters of god amen we're not talking to those that are wavering tossed about with every wind of doctrine and unsteady in their thinking and unsteady in their lives we're talking to sons and daughters of god that have heard the call they know who they are and the next verse that we don't often hear uh uh uh uh read or connected to this amen let's speak this in continuity be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil we know who the devil is amen we know he's our adversary as a roaring lion walkers about seeking whom he may devour whom who's he trying to devour those who resist steadfast in the faith now i didn't mean to set you up i mean it that way but we've already acknowledged we've already said amen we've already lifted a hand to know that it's god that's holding us steadfast in the faith it is not us in the flesh it is not our ability it's not our power amen so when we come my brother and sister have confidence that you will not be consumed by this roaring lion because you're gonna be one who stands steadfast lord your yes is good your no is good what you say lord everything about the whole picture i submit to that and i'm gonna give you my cares my problems i'll stand on this word lord and there it is the one he wants to devour he don't need to devour this one out here he don't need to devour this one out here he's already got him amen what he's seeking is you but i tell you you are identified right here in this scripture in the very next verse take the punctuation out take the numbers out it's one in continuity it comes down the one he wants is the one who's standing steadfast in the faith and he knows he can't have them he knows when it's all over that he won't get them but it won't stop him from trying he will try every way he'll make you rich he'll make you poor he'll make you healthy he'll make you sick he'll do whatever he can do but remember god gave and opened the hedge and gave satan that opportunity with job and job looked like he was sliding right out and failing but one day oh hallelujah one day god come down and said hey job where were you where were you when i hung the stars into heaven where were you when they sung for joy where were you job and job recognized oh i've always been in you i've not been in me i've been in you and so it's you it's you it's you it's you oh excuse me for getting excited this morning amen but you look at this oh you know the scripture tells us that we ought to give praise for the fiery trials now come on let's be honest saints when's the last time you got all excited running around the house praise the lord the world is falling apart and so is my finances no it's against human nature it's against human nature you know what i'm going to do finances are tough i'm going to get the wife a job i'm going to go put my wife right out here amongst the lions and the wolves really what you ought to be doing is saying lord according to your word i got a hole in this pocket and lord i'm going to submit this pocket to you the great seamstress to sew it up hope there's no lint falls out here sew up this pocket lord now if the need is there i'm not condemning anyone that has a job don't misunderstand me i'm telling you that our solution is not to go to god our solution is natural carnal that's what we're we just need more money no we need more god that's it we don't need more money we need more god hallelujah because god will stretch your dollar farther than even dave ramsey could dream of yeah come on i'm i agree with dave ramsey i don't think i've ever heard anything he said you know uh then i i and didn't agree with have a budget live on less than you make we don't make much brother paul live on less god feed the widow woman surely he feed you the bride of this last day hallelujah now i know some people don't like dave ramsey but hey he's just a man who's trying to get people out of debt he's just trying to help him that's his way you can listen to whoever you want do whatever program you want but if you live on more than you make i don't care whether you say you're the bride of christ or not you've got a problem yeah that's right but look at this how beautiful this is those that resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions that are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world you see my brother and sister within this body of believers we call the bride of christ we look real close a guy down the road that confesses nothing you might have just the same worrisome things happen in your life just like him that's right when the battery dies in your car unless god chooses to come supernaturally your car is not running he has that same problem he goes to the doctor the doctor says well you have this issue in your body you go to the doctor the doctor says you have this issue in your body but what they don't have is a promise they don't have christ himself the holy ghost who said i'm going to manifest the prophet of god said what this seventh seal what it was about i'm just paraphrasing this what this was about was god uh manifesting himself in the people that's what the whole plan was amen that is the whole issue that's the whole sum total of it is god said i'm going to come down and i'm going to manifest myself in you not just that god is present but the bride anointing the anointing of this last day is going to be manifested in you and i yeah we won't just read about it we won't just talk about it that's right we will be it that's right in fact uh my sister jerry and i talked about this i can't remember now the sermon because we've been in several lately but uh the prophet of god says you you are the rapture it's taking place right now i'm waiting for the rapture in that blessing oh no it's happening right now my some people just get all up tight they'll get in a sweat over this they probably aren't listening so it won't matter but you know what i am the rapture and i am taking place right now [Music] it's not this man in the flesh it's christ in me and it's taking place right now don't don't go looking off in another day and say you know when the rapture happens or when we see certain signs they're happening the sign we ought to be looking for is christ manifested in you and i that's the sign that fullness of christ poured into the church all that was in christ was poured into what the church who's the church the bride who's the bride amen amen okay now we've got to get on to our subject hallelujah now look at this my brother and sister verse 10 the god of all grace who hath called us into his eternal glory by christ jesus after you have suffered for a while amen aren't you glad for a while means that the suffering comes to an end amen you suffered for a while make you perfect in that beautiful i have a promise to be perfect it's taking place right now it's being manifested right as we speak this perfection of the word is bringing us into a state of perfection you say but brother paul i don't feel perfect well don't ask what you feel my brother and sister talk to god and god will reveal to you how he views perfect do you know what he views perfect as can i give you just a glimpse real quick you know it already but he views perfect as that one who submits himself with no string attached and says lord i'm yours i'm yours that's perfect because then he gets to mold in any form or fashion that he wants you know i learned a lesson in school can you imagine brother paul is an artist you're all stunned and no we can't so i took art class i think it was in ninth grade the class i really wanted to take was full class everybody wanted to take it was full so it's like what's left to do that'd be fun art class the teacher my sister knew her well was actually very very close friends with this teacher miss braden she's a lovely lady i don't know what did she have emma polio she walked with braces looked like such an unlikely person to be so gifted paint a flower sister nadia you would have been impressed i turned my flower in and the teacher's like what's this we're going to do this and the teacher would be like paul don't ever try to be that we got to pottery you're supposed to take the clay and you start to knead it you start to push it out and you fold it over and you push it out and you fold it over and you push it out you know what you're doing you're eliminating all the hard hearts i'm in the hard spots come on saints some of us sit here in church maybe even today you've got a hard spot in your heart and you will not ever become what god called you to be because when you put that lump of clay on the wheel and start to mold it on that pottery wheel and you get to the place you hit that big hard lump of clay your little deal you're making on the wheel is garbage and that'll be the same thing you hold a hard spot in your heart to anyone or anything as it were you cannot be molded into what god called you what you need to do instead of holding on to the hard spots and saying i'm not going to go there i don't want to deal with that that is painful what you do is go through the pain either now or you will go through the pain later you know paul was lazy in art class and i just fold my clay around a couple times and when my time come to go on the potter's wheel and i poked my finger in there and miss braden would be saying paul you don't even have your clay centered i can make a pot out of this yeah i'll just follow how i feel i'll just follow what i think i'll just follow this it works good when you first start to mold it but when it comes to actually molding something that has form of beauty it is not perfectly centered on the word that's it you cannot bring it out into the very finesse to create something of beauty amen are you with me got down to the end of my ninth grade my sister susan actually is pretty accomplished artist i think time and life has kind of took that away from her i don't know if she spends time but maybe as a hobby she should go back to that miss braden said paul can i talk to you miss brayden i love you she was a wonderful lady we sit down she pats me on the arm she tells me she thinks i'm going to be a fine young man when i grow up implying that you aren't right now and she said going into the 10th grade will you please take any class but mine you see there was no innate nature in me to be an artist somehow the flower i saw here transfer transferred through my thinking never made it to here no nature i hope you follow this no nature in me to be an artist and there was no nature in you or i to be brought into the perfection as sons and daughters of god but god said just stop i don't need your nature brother trevor i want you to just empty out your nature and i'll pour my nature into you and my nature will allow you to be molded by the word and you will become this thing of beauty and it will be looked upon and then the lord says that was the perfect son or daughter of god he's the one who submitted and said lord mold me however you want me to be i don't need to be me lord i need to be you i need to be you expressed see that's perfection to god is when we surrender ourself completely to his will to be molded by the word of god hallelujah hallelujah you got to love the lord now look brother branham says here oh pardon me i think that's it right there i don't know you know here recently i feel so bad about not having church that day the weather totally turned and warmed up and by noon everything was melting and i i just felt i felt really foolish but we listen my brother and sister if you haven't please go listen to lean not to down unto thy own understanding it's an incredible sermon it is just straightforward and it fits today perfectly now jesus said in saint john 10 my sheep know my voice a voice of course is his word when he is speaking my sheep know my voice my voice has been proven to them to be true it's been vindicated that it is my voice amen can we say amen to that that's the day that we live in if we're sitting here today and we have a question whether it's truth or not you will never receive the full blessing or benefit of that because in the background is always a nagging doubt did i miss something is this not right you have to my brother and sister if you're going to be a hair christian and be the best hair krishna you can be if you're going to be catholic be the best catholic you can be the prophet of god i always humored that when i was a kid i was like dad i think i'm going to follow this quote right here and my dad's like not as long as i'm alive and that was if you're going to be a bum be the best mom you can be hallelujah i lived in my pickup i slept in my pickup i skied i went here i went there i did all kinds of things because i wasn't going to be bound down to nothing i just was going to do my best at the bum but i found out that being a bum i was a different nature than the bums that you would see on the exits on the interchange i was a bum who liked to spend money and so i had to go to work and then i did finally you know decided if i'm going to go to work i might as well submit to the system i'm talking about just the natural course of life and the profit of god one day my dad gave me another quote and it says there he says you don't work you don't eat wow i like to eat too so i'm gonna have to get a job but it's been proven to us saints it's been proven to us we're not sitting here today with a doubt a nagging doubt that we could be being deceived this is truth oh let me just throw this out brother christian i've discussed this deal you can look at this what was said right here i don't understand what's right here now this was said right here i don't understand what was said right here i don't understand these things that was there there's things that you can look at and you can start putting question marks over it but i want to ask you are there things about salvation they have question marks attached to them absolutely not absolutely not you see what the devil's trying to do is trying to get you from your position of standing steadfast in the faith i don't know if i can take that promise i don't know if that's real i don't know that i think it's so funny my brother and sister let me just interject this so some little studies i've just come across now we're over here and you look in the pentecostal world and some of you will freak out and say brother paul's listening to some of these pentecostal preachers well my brother and sister they preached truth too and i'm not basing my doctrine and my thoughts there's just a few of them i just judge where they're at by hearing what they're preaching and i sit there and say sister jerry look at this that is almost an absolute word for word quote of brother branham brother brown says when they start coming for the oil look out so now you've got pentecostal preachers standing in their pulpit saying i was reading uh some writings of a minister the other day and he said blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and i'm like that's brother branham he just quoted they're not going to admit it they're not going to admit it saints but i'm telling you here's these pentecostal preachers they are just digging in heard one of them i ain't gonna tell you the name guys guy's an interesting guy stands in the pulpit i might just share this while back stands in the pulpit at a recent convention and says the problem with us pentecostals we all spoke in tongues everybody's like i spoke in tongues and he says but your problem is you've got no life to back it up dead quiet and i don't want to hear about you speaking in tongues until you've got a life to back it up i apply that we're not having a special election today you're not going to throw me out today but why don't we quit walking around i believe the message i believe the message i believe the message that's our version of speaking in tongues i believe the message i believe the message what i want to see saints is a life there's got to be a life this word of god is a life amen but back to my original thoughts so you got these guys that are over here and they say well william branham said see what he's doing and the other half of christendom is quoting the prophet incognito from thousands of pulpits and they're not chasing them down criticizing them you know why it's real simple saints i'm not going to bother defending what the prophet said he said this here now we have to prove that we have to prove this he told me to go back to my bible that's where i went i said okay i'm going to listen to the prophet i went back to my bible and the bible says it i don't care what anybody else thinks about it the bible says it i believe it while they're all arguing over whether there was this many blanket natives or that many blanket natives or another one pipes in and says who counted no go ahead do what you want to do god's real in my household god's real in my life god's real in my church amen i know i don't have to go prove it by something else i proved it by him here present today i proved it by the word of the hour and it isn't because brother branham said it and i will quote him my brother and sister as long as it is truth wait he it's not changing is it nobody snuck in and pulled the page out of our church age book and reprinted it and come and stuck another page into our church age book so what he preached is already anchored and if it was truth then it's truth now i don't care where the church has went i don't care where the message has went the word doesn't change jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and everybody's like well compared to this and compared to that read a little comment the other day well the message reason i left the message it is so old-fashioned well thank you lord because i tell you what i don't need no new modern made out of plastic message give me a good old-fashioned anchored in the rock word of god it don't need to be modern it don't need to have a whatever and we had a visitor one time right here in this church and said it was so refreshing to be here the lights were on i'm not a mushroom to live in the dark but everywhere you go and even some message churches let's put bright lights and dim you realize the symbolism of that the prophet of god touched on that anointed ministry and the people sitting in darkness no let's get the lights off we're children of light hallelujah and we're going to stand steadfast on this word of god we're not moving from it amen oh it's not about this quote it's not about that quote i quote the quote saints because i believe what i'm reading i've saw it with my own eyes it came alive it's not something i'm hoping for it's something i've already seen and by god's grace i don't have to look backwards because he said you're gonna go forward into this rapture and i am listening and i said yes lord i am going forward into this rapture because i am the rapture amen and it can't take place without me hallelujah so therefore i've got to go fill my position and move forward and claim that hallelujah oh it's not about what was wrong my brother and sister the prophet of god said right there he says you know oh how was that brother george and i was just talking about that reminds me brother george sends greetings to everyone he loves you very much hallelujah but he says if they pass this covert vaccination or you don't fly thing he says then he might not see you again for a long time so just pray that the anointing of the devil doesn't doesn't do that but you look at that my brother says where was i oh my where was i oh probably wasn't important hey now notice they're not subject to following any other voice can i just put in real blunt terms i don't care about all them why i left the message people that are on youtube well praise the lord the prophet told me it's for believers only why i left the message well that's good maybe i should make a youtube video why i why i why i imagine we can make it about almost anything i was going to say why i don't eat ice cream but i do and hopefully nobody's looking but look it's not about why i don't amen i don't i don't live out here like they do because there's nothing calling me out there i live here because there's a voice that come down and screamed and i said that's a voice i recognize that's who i am i've been walking with the chickens and trying to understand that i was what is that uh there's several different one but i think one that's really popular is called babylon to learn new language or babble something like that you know learn a new language in just uh just uh you know few weeks or whatever my brother and sister the bride of christ is not down here walking with the chickens with a babble deal going okay then they look at you oh i didn't get that right clock still didn't get it right yeah yes yes yes forgive me for being dramatic my brother and sister but that's what separated you why you're not baptist nazarene methodist mormon catholic is because you were going along repeating out of some kind of a book and then one day you were able to come to a place you could speak from the heart you could speak from your soul and your soul said i love you lord and your word is so real to me it feeds my soul and you can rejoice and shout and dance in the lord because everything that's coming speaking to your soul and the thing that's important you can speak back it's not a one-sided conversation we're gonna take communion tonight that's what it's about my brother and sister not a one-sided conversation you're not speaking to god and he's ignoring you he's not speaking to you and you're ignoring him but you got a conversation hallelujah oh my hallelujah you know i had a whole nother section of this amen i don't think we'll go on with that but look at this now let's just finish this right here now notice they're not subject to following any other voice now look i'm kind of hitting on this but my brother and sister because these things make a little surge every once in a while kind of like the tide they go away and they're quiet for a little bit and then they make a whole bunch of new videos and a whole bunch of new recordings and they edit them all out and make them sound just right and it's so from their heart that sometimes they do it three or four times until they feel like it's just perfect i like that song says listen to my heart lord you see sometimes this don't get it all spoke just quite right with my heart my heart's speaking a different language but no what we do we set up a studio and we edit it and we do this and do that until we feel like our version is perfect really why don't you speak to me from your heart i was here this happened that's us i got discouraged i left good good let me tell you my version i would have left with you but some anointing come down on my heart come down in my life and something said just stand just stand let this storm blow around you let all of the tumbleweeds and all of the thistles and all the trash blow beyond you and just stand be steadfast in the faith and i will be there with you and when it's all over i have a reward for you because you stood faithful and everybody's like i'm afraid of the devil i'm afraid of him taking our children i'm not afraid of this i'm afraid of marriages i'm afraid this this this i'm sorry i'm not i'm not everyone that said fast on the word will stand every single storm of laodicea there's nothing can come in here and destroy us because it's the faith the word of god that is holding us amen stand fast in the faith oh wow whereby you've been set free hallelujah anybody free this morning hallelujah and look i speak this thing saints not because i just read this and i'm trying to be a puppet this is something i have personally witnessed and i get to witness it every single day of my life that when i veer away i start to pull back and i start to say woe is me and the problem gets worse after a while you get tired of making your own problem worse and so you quit the woe as me and say lord help me not woe is me but lord help me oh hallelujah now look let me wrap this up sister emmy musicians if you'd come that will certainly help me how are we resisting saints by standing steadfast we can we can name dozens of things that we're doing to resist but the truth of it is the one sum total that wraps around it all we're resisting by standing steadfast take your bible read your bible every day pray every day sometimes we don't feel like it lord i just don't feel like it this is i'm so down i'm so out i'm so whatever well stand steadfast amen don't get blown by every wind just stand steadfast the devil won't be able to touch you now i'm going to skip over a whole bunch of stuff so hopefully i'll make a reference here in numbers not going to go through all the scripture for the sake of time but we see in numbers where moses a man whose mistakes and weaknesses were glaringly obvious don't you love that come on i just i i just love it myself well most of us won't walk around talking about our weaknesses and glaring mistakes and we do all kinds of things but god made moses in such a way that all of his weaknesses and mistakes were glaringly obvious i hope i don't offend anybody but god sent a prophet to our day whose weaknesses and mistakes were glaringly obvious just listen to a man the other day says well i don't know about william branham there was all kinds of supernatural events took place in his ministry we believe he was a man of god and was anointed of god but you know there has to be something that was hidden because he was audited by the irs [Music] praise the lord i find in hosea chapter 1 any man audited by the irs cannot be a man of god we saw supernatural events this won't be word for word but it's close we saw supernatural events and we saw god move god blessed him beyond measure but when he stepped out of his calling what was his calling thank you brother tim i'm going to restore you according to the word but you see their interpretation was his calling was praying for the sick elijah prophet to the day condemned ahab jezebel spoke to clouds commanded great things to happen was god's mouthpiece but when he became a cafeteria or restaurant he must have been out of his calling why would god send a prophet to one woman and a child in a whole city of hungry people god wouldn't do that god would have showed up with a caravan full of food for the whole city elijah must have been out of his calling you know what it tells me there was one woman in that city that had totally surrendered that doesn't mean she was above despair her own word says i'm going to fix this one last meal for my child and i then we will die it doesn't mean she didn't have might call it depression the terms of this day didn't see any hope in sight but god said it doesn't matter how she feels at the moment i'm god she's mine and i will answer the prayers she already spoke [Music] and god comes down into one city why in a whole city in a time in an age when people children were taken off into bondage for deaths of not even their own but of parents and other relatives taken into bondage why would god speak to a woman and tell her you go to your neighbor and you get you get vessels not just a one not just a few i want you to get everyone you go through the whole community you get every empty vessel you can and when you come and when you start the doors have to be closed in other words you can't say well praise the lord god's doing more i think i better go get more vessels you better get it now get it now because when the door closes there's not going to be any more pouring out why did god do that because that was his chosen that was his children that's where he wanted to place himself right there look at the day we're living in let me close this out right here in other words oh let me go back up here it's vindicated it's my voice now notice they're not subject to following any other voice they won't my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow me ever wondered why we're not talking about preachers saints we're not talking about who's the pastor of grace tabernacle that could change tomorrow two are following jesus christ in other words they will not understand a theological voice that's teaching contrary to the word the sheep don't understand that no more than the eagle last night could understand the clocking of the hen they don't understand it because he was an eagle and that's the same thing with a genuine born-again child of god they only understand the things that are of god you wonder why you're not happy to be a denominational christian [Music] come on so much i could say but you're believers you read you study amen prophet of god said the minute you take on the spirit of denomination he said you round it and it's done [Music] hallelujah come on saints that don't work no better than grounding your children you see it was housea the second chapter that says he who will not ground his child will spoil him now you guys have read that haven't you come on saints it's time we get back well we just don't live in a day brother paul of corporate punishment i don't care what you live in the day of my brother and sister the bible says if you don't uh you spare the rod amen you're gonna spoil that child that doesn't mean that we use the old-fashioned you know we were a kid of the 60s and dad's idea of of you know the rod happened to look like a two [Music] before but come on let's put the principles i'm not trying to tell you how to discipline your children but the principles we can't depart the principles and expect to get the results hallelujah okay i want to quit here amen now praise the lord i thought i'd get an amen on the quitting part hallelujah let me say it this way saints in that time that we look in the scripture we see that moses with all of his heirs all of his problems all of his whatever god stood with him and he just go study his little homework numbers the 16th chapter i have right here on my uh notes uh verse 27 through 34. we'll see how that dayton they come to moses and they tell them you know what we're just as spiritual as you it doesn't matter how spiritual you are if god didn't call you to that position yes we're going back tying this to the start of the service if you're not called to that position then don't try and occupy what it's called has nothing to do with how spiritual you are you saints i'll just put it this way there's many of you here no doubt are more spiritual than me [Music] but did god call you to be a pastor did god call you you see what i'm saying how spiritual we are and how god speaks to us shouldn't be based on that guy that guy say thank you lord that you open my eyes to see what i see but they came and said you know what we're just as spiritual as you and you're in control and because we're just as spiritual or more so than you we should be in control we should have a voice in numbers there god speaks to moses and tells him you know what hallelujah now look at this let's just go here i had it right here on this screen and and they got up from the tabernacle of court nathan and barum on every side and dathan and barron came out and stood in the doors of their tents and their wives their sons their little children and moses said hereby shall know that the lord has sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of my own mind if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me put himself in a supernatural judgment right here moses put himself right out there where he himself would be judged what he is judging but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that are pain to them appertained to them and they go down quick and to the pit ye shall understand that these men have provoked the lord and it came to pass as they had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground clave asunder that was under them and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained the decorah and all their goods they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation and all israel that was round about them fled at the cry of them for they said lest the earth swallow us up also now let's just interpret this to the day we have my brother and sister you think brother paul you're speaking kind of harsh on them it is because it's a seducing spirit it's a seducing spirit but i want you to just recognize this these people are taking their position and we're watching them one by one being swallowed up by the earth them their wife their children their closest friends all of this being swallowed up by the earth now look what it says here they perished from among the congregation now let's just look at this very carefully it lays the groundwork that they're still out there living breathing that's right but they perished from the congregation gone from the house of god why because they made god angry amen verse 34. i stopped right there saints it'd do us good to have a little bit of fear and flee from that bless the word worse come upon us the earth swallow us up i don't want to be swallowed up by laodicea i want to stand strong on the word of god there's things i don't understand there's things i can't explain there's things that baffle me amen but one thing i do know i'm not going to try to take a position god didn't call me too i'm not going to try and be what god didn't call me to be he called me just to be a son of god that's why the prophet of god's own words his theme only believe amen reminds me of a brother by god's grace i could speak real direct to him he said well brother paul i i think you know one of the problems we have around the message is we're ignorant i was like i agree i'm ignorant he said unless we could understand the greek and all of these things i said brother brother brown dealt with that brother what are you gonna do i mean there's there's only 14 15 different dialects of a certain dialect you're going to go learn them all spend your whole life learning that it won't do it he said well i think we need to understand that he said i believe brother ryan was a prophet but i believe there are certain things he didn't understand about what he was preaching okay i don't understand how corn grows i've just witnessed it for 30 years grow hallelujah i can't explain to you why what certain roots do what certain things in a corn plant but what i want to know is in the end of the year when that's all harvested and there's big oil ears on there and i dig it up and all these roots are out there i i don't know the scientist says this root did this and this root did this and this root was designed to take up this mineral in this mineral but not this one okay cool what root is that i don't know but it doesn't and i don't know the greek now i don't know the arab and i don't know the hebrew and i don't know all the signs and wonders that are taking on but i do know the ones that i've witnessed and i got to see them take place in my own life and i've got to come to the place that i've had people i called friends i've watched them get swallowed up and disappear from the congregation sorry to close on this kind of a note that maybe we ought to have a little godly fear that we would flee from those things so we don't have to worry about being swallowed up our own self amen stand steadfast in the word satan cannot that roaring lion cannot defeat you if you stand stead fast in the word hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i i will close i'm sorry i took way more than five minutes there hey man i i do you know brother brown did have a sense of humor he gets up starts i i believe that is lean not [Music] but brown says well you know billy told me i'll just paraphrase this down billy told me i only had about 15 minutes tonight because i used it all up last night well hallelujah i just borrowed from brother chris and brother david i know they're kind enough to loan me some time hallelujah oh let me say this again my brother and sister might not be exactly right but we see the earth consuming we see people falling away [Music] it won't hurt us come on let me just share this with you from the depths of my heart it won't hurt us to have a little godly fear of being consumed by this present fear i'm not talking about being deceived oh i'm afraid of being deceived now the word says you can't be deceived but i'll tell you what it would be that little bit of godly fear that lord it would be the seducing spirits of of this and that whatever weakness it would be the lord i don't even want to go there i'm going to flee from it flee from the very appearance of evil amen because i see it consuming what you're doing is acknowledging that satan when he gets his hands on people can make them disappear from the congregation some reappear some never do i'm a son of god i heard the call i'm not leaving the congregation hallelujah yep we got two options today saints we're either going to be taken up or swallowed up hallelujah i'm gonna be taken up hallelujah now you know sister emmy started the service off there the pre-service music and it wasn't really in my thoughts but it struck me so strong just felt like the holy spirit moved right in the office just tears in my eyes he hath forgiven me oh to think about that my brother and sister we don't have to sit here and say well well i've already repented i repent no this is me saying thank you lord that you anointed me to repent you anointed me to just uh take the word and apply it to my life and that result was as my heart was washed in his clean tonight let's just stand and sing a song or two before we dismiss today oh hallelujah oh just from your heart saints that's what we want to do from your heart hallelujah [Music] by the blood of the lamb of calvary [Music] i know he has from his memory [Music] you know the word of god says that we can have all these gifts and be able to explain all these things and do all of this but without charity we have nothing oh my brother and sister you have charity when you have the holy ghost when you have god in the driver's seat of your life you will have charity you will not have to go say i've received the holy ghost now i got to go on a journey and find charity no sir when the holy ghost shows up charity will be there satan remember i spoke to you this way the other day satan will come along and he will try to place on you make you a beast of burden the yolks broke yes we live in a day when they have this incredible stuff those of you that are carpenters they have this glue now that you can apply and you spray an activator on there in about 30 seconds you got two pieces of wood welded together my if you're doing picture frames and stuff like that there's no more holding that trying to shoot a little pin nailing it just put it on there spray it hold it just perfect the devil loves technology so he's come down and he's dragging old broken yolks around he's putting that on there and he's squirting that he's holding it back together but did you know depending on the kind of yolk part of the country you was at some of them yolks when they used them what they called a pin yolk they put that old bolt or that chunk of wood whatever it was up around their neck through that the top and it never came off that poor ox went to get a drink he has a yolk on he goes to eat he's got a yolk he goes wherever he's got a yolk on it that means the devil's got to come get you to stand still long enough while he puts that back around her neck and sticks it together and it only takes 30 seconds come on saints you've been forgiven the yoke is broken let those burdens just go away be done with them the place the problem is some of us have never cried out to the lord with real tears brother brown calls it a dry eyed confession and for so long maybe we need to find a closet get in it and have a real down-home lord forgive me the yoke is broken and i won't let anything that's from the past or from the present or will come in the future put that burden of that yoke upon me ever again i'm finished i'm finished hallelujah oh what a mighty god we serve hallelujah can we testify of that this morning what a mighty god we serve
