[2:33] [Music]
[4:02] Thank you.
[4:03] [Music]
[6:11] God bless you friends. Good evening.
[6:14] Good to be with all of you.
[6:18] Let's start with this song. Hide thou me
[6:20] number 560.
[6:23] [Music]
[6:28] Sometimes I feel discouraged
[6:34] and think my life in vain.
[6:39] I'm tempted then to murmur
[6:45] and of my lot complain.
[6:50] But when I think of Jesus
[6:56] and all he's done for me,
[7:01] then I cry, "Oh rock of aes,
[7:07] high thou me.
[7:13] Oh rock of aes
[7:18] hide thou me.
[7:24] No
[7:26] other reuge
[7:30] have I but thee.
[7:35] When life's dark veil I wonder
[7:41] far, far from thee.
[7:45] Then I cry, oh rock of aes,
[7:52] high thou me.
[7:57] Sometimes it seems I dare not go one
[8:04] step farther on.
[8:08] And from my heart all courage
[8:14] has slipped away and gone.
[8:19] But I remember
[8:22] Jesus
[8:25] and all his love for me.
[8:30] Then I cry, "Oh rock of aesence,
[8:36] hide thou me.
[8:42] Oh rock of aes
[8:47] hide thou me.
[8:53] No
[8:54] other reuge
[8:57] [Music]
[8:58] have I but thee.
[9:03] When life's dark veil I wander
[9:09] far, far from thee.
[9:14] Then I cry, O rock of agees,
[9:20] high thou me.
[9:25] Oh, what a friend is Jesus.
[9:31] Sure anor for my soul.
[9:36] So tender, true, and gracious.
[9:42] I'm safe in his control.
[9:48] My help in time of danger.
[9:53] My strong defense is me.
[9:58] Oh thou blessed rock of aes
[10:04] high thou me.
[10:10] Oh rock of aes
[10:15] hide thou me.
[10:21] No other reuge
[10:27] have I but thee.
[10:31] and life's dark veil I wonder
[10:37] far
[10:39] from thee.
[10:42] Then I cry, oh rock of aesence,
[10:48] high thou me. Oh rock of ages.
[10:54] Oh rock of aes
[10:59] high thou me.
[11:04] No
[11:06] other reuge
[11:10] have I but thee.
[11:15] When life's dark may I wonder
[11:21] far far from thee.
[11:25] Then I cry, oh rock of aes,
[11:32] high thou me.
[11:38] Amen. Let's go to the key of G number

[15:24] that makes the proud heart humble.
[15:28] It was God who devised a plan
[15:32] that in all things like a man,
[15:37] he would live so he could give to us the

[18:21] Hallelujah.
[18:27] Amen. We're going to go to prayer.
[18:30] Um
[18:32] firstly, I just wanted to thank
[18:33] everybody for praying for my mom. She's
[18:36] at home and feeling great, surrounded by
[18:37] grandkids. So, having a good time.
[18:41] Really grateful to the Lord for that.
[18:44] Um, let's just remember brother Paul and
[18:46] sister Jerry as they're um away working
[18:49] at Harvest and um I think sister Kristen
[18:52] Nash is also helping. So, let's just
[18:54] remember them in prayer. Um, let's
[18:57] remember brother Ivan with an unspoken
[18:58] prayer request. Uh, my father-in-law,
[19:01] Brother Moses, is um having some
[19:03] treatment or exams ran. So, if you can
[19:06] remember that in prayer as well. Uh, and
[19:10] brother David Nash is asking to remember
[19:13] Logan uh, Sumstead, young man battling
[19:16] with addiction and going into rehab and
[19:18] the Iikita family in San Francisco with
[19:21] dealing with death in the family. And
[19:23] then also, Brother David will be
[19:24] traveling to Canada.
[19:27] So, uh, yeah, brother Trevor, could you
[19:31] lead us in a word of prayer?
[19:35] Have we heard anything about uh little
[19:38] Isaac?
[19:40] Is he feeling better?
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, man.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; He is good.
[19:46] Okay,
[19:49] let's bow our heads. Precious heavenly
[19:51] father, thank you Lord for this time
[19:53] together, Lord. We approach you, Lord,
[19:56] boldly
[19:57] by your spirit, Lord Jesus.
[20:00] We thank you, Father, for these
[20:02] requests, Lord. each one of them
[20:05] precious. Father,
[20:08] we hold them dear, Father, and just ask,
[20:10] Lord, that you be with each one of
[20:12] these. And we thank you for the success
[20:15] of Sister Luba's surgery, Lord. Just ask
[20:17] that you'd continue to just heal her.
[20:19] I'm glad she's feeling better, Lord. And
[20:22] we just are expecting a good report,
[20:24] Father, that she's made whole, Lord
[20:27] Jesus. and for the
[20:30] the uh just unspoken request for brother
[20:33] Ivan and also brother Paul and sister
[20:36] Jerry and Sister Kristen out there
[20:38] working. Lord we just pray you be with
[20:40] them. Lord we lift up little baby Isaac.
[20:44] And we thank you also, Father, for
[20:45] healing him and just grateful that he's
[20:48] feeling better, too, Lord Jesus. And
[20:51] Lord, for these requests that were on
[20:52] brother David Nash's heart, Lord, we
[20:54] just ask that you this young man who's
[20:56] battling addiction, Father, be with him.
[20:58] We pray, Lord. And
[21:01] Lord Jesus, um,
[21:03] for just healing for from the death of a
[21:07] loved one, Father,
[21:09] you know,
[21:11] you know each situation, Lord. You know
[21:14] what everyone who was what they're going
[21:16] through, Lord. We just commit them to
[21:18] you, Father.
[21:20] just pray that you'd be their comfort,
[21:22] Lord. Lord, we ask that you speak
[21:24] through our brother David today, Father.
[21:26] Just ask that you'd prepare every heart,
[21:28] Father, to receive
[21:31] and to live the word of God, Lord Jesus.
[21:35] Ask that you'd raise us to a higher
[21:37] plane, Father.
[21:40] And may we say as those who walked to
[21:42] Emmas, Father, that
[21:45] wasn't it good to walk and talk with him
[21:48] along the way. Father,
[21:51] we love you and we thank you, Lord, in
[21:52] the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you.

[25:22] I'm kind of home
[25:29] sick for a country
[25:36] to which I've never
[25:44] been
[25:45] before.
[25:50] No sad

[27:16] Oh, I'm looking
[27:19] now
[27:24] across
[27:26] the river
[27:31] to where my faith
[27:38] will end inside.
[27:45] There's just a few
[27:52] more days to labor.
[28:00] Then I will take
[28:07] my heavenly
[28:09] fly.
[28:14] Oh, beautiful
[28:16] land.
[28:21] I'm longing
[28:23] for

[29:54] You
[29:58] keep sweet
[30:02] land. Is that on?
[30:05] Thank you. Praise the Lord. finally got
[30:08] it turned on before I got here.
[30:12] Live and learn. God bless every one of
[30:14] you tonight. I I really enjoy that song.
[30:16] Enjoyed the song service. Praise the
[30:18] Lord. We uh I thought it was going to be
[30:20] Brother David here tonight, but he's
[30:23] shaking his head going.
[30:25] Not this time.
[30:28] This David.
[30:29] Well, praise the Lord. Here we are. It's
[30:31] good to be back in the house of the
[30:33] Lord. We're going to be gone for a
[30:35] little bit. will be couple services in
[30:37] Canada and then back to Oregon and then
[30:40] probably back east or at least y'all
[30:42] have a blessed day state. And if you
[30:46] ever been to Texas, you'd understand
[30:48] that language. So, God bless each and
[30:51] every one of you tonight. Uh remember my
[30:54] wife too, she was uh still having a you
[30:58] know, she it's a cycle that she kind of
[31:00] goes through with the food. So just
[31:03] remember her if we could stand for a
[31:06] moment and uh approach the word of the
[31:09] Lord.
[31:12] And before we do that, let's just pray.
[31:15] Gracious heavenly father.
[31:18] I love you tonight.
[31:21] I thank you and I praise you Lord for
[31:23] the word of God. For thou art the word
[31:25] of God. And so we're asking that you
[31:27] would take it Lord from the rema and the
[31:30] typewritten words from the pages Lord
[31:32] and take it into the realms of the
[31:34] spiritual
[31:35] Lord. Take it into a place toward that
[31:37] we can step into it as we would say take
[31:40] a journey Lord. Let us take the journey
[31:42] tonight into the Holy Ghost and bring us
[31:46] into the presence the divine presence of
[31:50] thee Lord the son of God the word of
[31:52] God.
[31:54] And may it be instruction to us. May it
[31:56] be those things that we have need of to
[31:59] make this daily walk that we've been
[32:01] assigned to. In Jesus Christ's name we
[32:03] ask it. Remember those that aren't able
[32:05] to be here this evening and those who
[32:08] desire and for those out online. God
[32:10] bless you. Father we pray for them in
[32:12] Jesus name. Amen.
[32:15] Let's turn first to Colossians
[32:20] uh chapter 1. This is be kind of a a
[32:25] little bit of a continuation of of last
[32:27] time right before we finished we got a
[32:29] little talking about the translation
[32:33] and uh there's so much in scripture
[32:39] about that
[32:41] in I guess you could say hidden places
[32:44] but in uh Colossians first chapter and
[32:47] we know right off the bat as we were if
[32:50] we were to go to ch Colossians chapter 2
[32:52] that we're in a battle. In fact, I'll
[32:54] just read that as we get started. Uh
[32:58] he says, "For I would that ye knew what
[33:00] a great conflict I have for you and for
[33:03] them at Leodysia and for as many as have
[33:06] not seen my face in the flesh." We are
[33:08] in a conflict.
[33:11] That's pretty It's Yeah. He said,
[33:13] "You're in a conflict." And he's saying
[33:15] that to the Colossians. and he's saying
[33:17] that Leodysia, you better be paying
[33:20] attention to this because we're in a
[33:21] battle. So, with that in mind, then we
[33:24] go back to chapter one
[33:26] and let's look a little bit about what
[33:28] this battle is about.
[33:32] And I guess we'll start there about
[33:35] chapter verse 11.
[33:38] strengthened with all might according to
[33:40] his glorious power unto all patience and
[33:43] longsuffering with joyfulness, giving
[33:46] thanks unto the Father, who hath made us
[33:48] to be ma partakers of the inheritance of
[33:51] the saints in the light, who hath
[33:54] delivered us, that's past tense, from
[33:56] the power of darkness, and hath past
[33:59] tense, translated us into the kingdom of
[34:03] his dear son, in whom we have redemption
[34:06] through his blood, even the forgiveness
[34:10] of sin. Now, before we're seated, let's
[34:13] turn one other place, and that would be
[34:16] Revelations 12
[34:20] and begin to see the
[34:23] importance as it was of translation and
[34:26] how we get into it.
[34:32] See, is that the right one? 12 verse 12
[34:35] and verse 10.
[34:37] Well, we'll start there at verse 9. And
[34:39] the great dragon was cast out, and that
[34:41] old serpent called the devil and Satan,
[34:44] which deceived the whole world, he was
[34:46] cast out into the earth, and the angels
[34:49] were cast out with him. And I heard a
[34:51] loud voice saying in heaven, "Now
[34:55] is come salvation
[34:57] and strength, and the kingdom of our
[34:59] God, and the power of his Christ. For
[35:01] the accuser of our brethren is cast
[35:02] down, which accused them before our God
[35:06] day and night." And they overcame him by
[35:09] the blood of the lamb, and by the word
[35:12] of their testimony, and they loved not
[35:14] their lives unto the death. Gracious
[35:17] heavenly father,
[35:19] please Lord take this vessel, take these
[35:22] vessels and speak Lord heart to heart
[35:24] from your heart to theirs in Jesus name.
[35:26] Amen. Please be seated
[35:33] as we look at this and we think about
[35:36] translated or being trans uh and we
[35:41] covered it many times. It's simply to tr
[35:45] it comes from the word transfer to move
[35:47] from one place to another and that one
[35:50] place to another and how that that in
[35:54] the moving there's things that can move
[35:56] with it as the water we talked about
[35:58] last time
[36:03] I just transferred the position of the
[36:05] water. Well, it wasn't just the water.
[36:08] That's the part you saw and maybe heard
[36:10] with if it was if I had it close enough
[36:12] to the mic. But there's more that came
[36:14] with that in that transferring process
[36:18] in that water for human beings is life.
[36:23] And when we drink the water, we not
[36:25] don't get just the movement of the water
[36:27] from place to place or from bottle to
[36:30] mouth and mouth to the the other parts,
[36:33] but what comes with it is the life
[36:35] that's in the water. And then that life
[36:38] becomes
[36:40] our lives.
[36:42] As we absorb that water, that water
[36:46] becomes part of us and we become part of
[36:48] it. And so the life that's in the water
[36:52] begins to transmit from the water into
[36:55] us. And so we begin to live the life of
[37:00] the water.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:03] Now Jesus said this word is water.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; This is water. And I believe it was the
[37:12] woman at the well where she went to the
[37:13] well and he said, "Hey, if you knew who
[37:15] you were talking to, I would give you
[37:17] water that you never thirst again."
[37:20] So we realize that the scriptures, the
[37:23] the the God of heaven, the I am that
[37:26] poured himself out through Jesus Christ
[37:29] has the ability to give life from the
[37:32] water of the word.
[37:36] And as we looked there
[37:40] in Revelations, excuse me, it said there
[37:43] that they overcame him, that's the devil
[37:47] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[37:50] their testimony.
[37:53] So they have had a testimony that
[37:56] overcame
[37:58] the the devil. So we we mentioned that
[38:01] scripture there in Colossians and how
[38:03] that we are in a battle and this battle
[38:06] because we are living in the age of
[38:09] Leodysia. We're not Leodysians.
[38:13] No, we're here but not by choice
[38:16] perhaps.
[38:18] But we're here because somebody has to
[38:22] have a testimony that overcomes the
[38:24] devil during the period of this age.
[38:28] This age in as we know from the church
[38:30] ages is called the age of people's
[38:33] rights.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; And if everybody we talk about you know
[38:36] they talk about well we have rights to
[38:38] do this we have rights to do that and uh
[38:42] it just gets crazy really because
[38:46] everybody thinks they have the right to
[38:48] to do something or and what we forget is
[38:51] that God has rights.
[38:55] God has a right because he is
[38:57] righteousness himself
[39:00] &gt;&gt; and he pours that righteousness. It says
[39:03] that we become talking about the the
[39:06] church of the living God or the br we
[39:07] call it the bride of Christ. We become
[39:10] the very righteousness of God
[39:13] &gt;&gt; because the righteousness of God just as
[39:17] I I'm going to take another drink
[39:18] because my throat's a little scratchy.
[39:24] that life that now came into me as we
[39:27] drink from the word of God. A and it
[39:30] says that he is the righteous one. And
[39:32] from the righteous one, as we drink of
[39:35] him, he is called the word of God. As we
[39:37] drink of the word of God, we become the
[39:42] literal righteousness of Jesus Christ to
[39:46] display God's rights.
[39:50] God's rights because it's, you know, we,
[39:53] you know, who he hath called, he hath
[39:55] chosen, and how that we're not going to
[39:56] go into predestination, those things
[39:58] tonight, but that by his choosing, he
[40:02] has the right to choose.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And as we read uh in in another place,
[40:09] it talks, you know, well, what if God
[40:10] chose Pharaoh just to show his glory?
[40:14] &gt;&gt; That was God's rights.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we think about this, when
[40:20] he made mankind all the way back to the
[40:22] before the garden, before the garden,
[40:26] because it was when it said he created
[40:28] man in his image,
[40:31] and we know created he male and female
[40:34] created he them. What was the image of
[40:36] God?
[40:38] Well, he's God.
[40:41] And that image, part of that image is
[40:44] the the ability to choose.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; God chose
[40:52] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; He knew who he was and who would display
[40:59] him. And he chose
[41:02] &gt;&gt; he chose to make Adam. He didn't make
[41:04] Barney or Bill or somebody else. He made
[41:07] Adam.
[41:08] And Adam was the divine nature of God
[41:13] being expressed. And he made him in the
[41:16] form as we think of it, male and female.
[41:19] And that male and female was, we know,
[41:22] type and shadow of Christ and the church
[41:24] or Christ and the bride.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; And how that from that choosing
[41:32] that right to choose, he put that in us.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have the right to choose
[41:40] because God said so because we're made
[41:43] in his image and he retained the right
[41:46] to choose.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; And so we have a right to speak to speak
[41:54] a testimony to live up to a a standard
[41:58] whatever standard each one of us has
[42:00] here tonight or out there on the line.
[42:02] whatever whatever your standard is, you
[42:04] have the right to choose that because
[42:07] God put that choice in us.
[42:11] And so here when he starts to talk there
[42:14] about translated into the kingdom back
[42:19] I'm back in Colossians fir first chapter
[42:26] said giving thanks unto the father which
[42:28] hath made us meet partakers of the
[42:30] inheritance of the sight of the saints
[42:33] in light. We are to be partakers of the
[42:37] inheritance. What inheritance?
[42:41] What inheritance is he talking about?
[42:44] Well, we look back at the types and
[42:46] shadows of Israel and how that they were
[42:49] given an inheritance. It went all the
[42:52] way back to Abraham who with uh when God
[42:57] came to Abraham and he told him, you
[42:59] know, your children are going to go down
[43:00] for 400 years and after that time I'll
[43:04] bring them out. another place he said,
[43:05] "I'll bring them out and take them in."
[43:08] That was the inheritance. And we
[43:11] understand that in this age that that
[43:13] was an inheritance for them as a natural
[43:16] covenant, a natural inheritance, but it
[43:19] types and shadows the supernatural
[43:22] inheritance
[43:24] of the gentile bride.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; That speaks of us. And we look at how
[43:30] when he spoke that a and how that that
[43:35] was the promise, that was the
[43:37] inheritance that God spoke to Abraham
[43:40] for your children.
[43:43] That was their inheritance. That's what
[43:45] they were to receive. And how from that
[43:48] inheritance they they we took them out
[43:51] of Egypt. God said, "I'll bring them out
[43:54] and I'll take them in." And they came
[43:56] out of Egypt. What they did not
[43:58] understand that being under the
[44:01] anointing of Moses because God had told
[44:04] Moses, "You go down and be a god to
[44:07] those people."
[44:10] What a choice.
[44:13] You go down and be a god to those
[44:15] people. Whatever you say, Moses, I'll
[44:18] back you up.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, Moses, I'll back you
[44:23] up, bride of Christ. Whatever you say,
[44:27] he said, you can have it
[44:29] &gt;&gt; if thou can't believe.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; So, and and here it is. They come out of
[44:35] the kingdom. They go into, you know,
[44:37] they had all kinds of problems. They're
[44:39] people just like you and I. You have any
[44:41] problems tonight? Well, you can't be a
[44:44] problem because that word's not in the
[44:45] book. And if you're the word, you're not
[44:47] the problem.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; It's got to be something from out there,
[44:51] right?
[44:52] &gt;&gt; It's It's really not there. So you're
[44:54] not the problem.
[44:56] And so
[44:58] but when they got out and they got in
[45:00] that land and they went through trial
[45:03] after trial and day by day they walked
[45:06] what they didn't understand by that
[45:08] being under the anointing of that
[45:11] prophet messenger for that day
[45:14] as he spoke the word of God and they
[45:18] received it. Every step they took, they
[45:22] became the fulfillment of the promise.
[45:28] Even when they, you know, they, hey, you
[45:31] know, no straw for the bricks, all those
[45:33] things didn't matter because the
[45:35] anointing was there to transform them
[45:41] &gt;&gt; or translate, move them from slavery
[45:45] into freedom. Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; And not just slavery to freedom, but
[45:50] from freedom into the next level, which
[45:53] was a wilderness experience,
[45:55] but it was the anointing of God on them
[45:59] that goes back to Abraham that said,
[46:01] I'll bring them out.
[46:03] And they became the literal fulfillment
[46:07] of that scripture.
[46:09] I'll bring them out. They were the
[46:11] fulfillment of it.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the Egyptians. It wasn't
[46:15] somebody else. It was them because the
[46:17] promise of God had anointed them to
[46:20] become that promise.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; You are anointed to become a promise of
[46:26] God. You shall not all die. You shall be
[46:29] changed
[46:32] &gt;&gt; you're anointed to bring that promise
[46:34] &gt;&gt; because God said so.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Well, we know they got in the
[46:39] wilderness. They got in trouble and it
[46:41] came down to a certain place and I guess
[46:44] it was Kadesh Barnea and spies went in,
[46:47] spies came back and when the people
[46:50] asked him, well, how was it? Oh, it's a
[46:53] good land. Oh, really? But then they
[46:57] said, yeah, but we can't have it.
[46:59] We can't have it.
[47:03] What do you mean? Well, there's giants
[47:05] in the land.
[47:07] Oh, it's terrible.
[47:09] Giants. We didn't expect this. Yeah,
[47:12] we're like grasshoppers. How many
[47:14] grasshoppers do we have here tonight?
[47:17] Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother.
[47:21] Who said that? God didn't call them
[47:23] grasshoppers.
[47:25] You're not grasshoppers, people. You're
[47:27] sons and daughters of God.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; But somebody, they believed it. And when
[47:34] they believed it,
[47:37] you know, somebody said, "Oh, that we
[47:39] had died in the wilderness. Oh, that."
[47:43] And they went on with their negative
[47:46] confession. And when they did that, what
[47:49] happened? They because they were under a
[47:53] spoken word experience
[47:56] becoming the fulfillment of the promise,
[47:58] they spoke themselves out. God didn't
[48:02] cast them out.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. They spoke themselves out.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; They spoke themselves out of the promise
[48:13] because they didn't realize it was only
[48:15] Joshua and Caleb who came back. They
[48:17] tried to steal them and they say, "No,
[48:18] no, no. Watch Joshua and Caleb." They
[48:22] said, "Let us go up at once. God hath,
[48:28] we just read it, hath translated."
[48:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. He's saying he's that
[48:32] kingdom is already ours
[48:34] &gt;&gt; because from his heart he wasn't there
[48:37] yet
[48:39] &gt;&gt; and yet down here he was already there.
[48:42] It was already his
[48:43] &gt;&gt; and he's going to claim it and walk into
[48:46] it.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Well, it took 40 years to get rid of all
[48:49] the unbelief. Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; But when the day came and Joshua walked
[48:52] to that river and they put the, you
[48:55] know, laid the stones and the water
[48:56] rolled back, when he stepped through
[48:59] that on that dry land and got on the
[49:02] other side, he could have turned around
[49:03] and said, "This day, that promise to
[49:05] Abraham is fulfilled."
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; One day,
[49:10] today, you might as well claim it today.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. this day that these scriptures
[49:17] we're talking about bride and
[49:18] translation are fulfilled in me.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; In me. In you.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; We look at the outside world. It's
[49:29] falling apart, friends.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Earthquakes and this and that and all
[49:33] the stuff going on. It's crazy. But in
[49:36] you,
[49:38] &gt;&gt; he said there, let's read it again.
[49:42] who hath delivered us from the power of
[49:43] darkness and hath translated us into the
[49:46] kingdom of his son. Where have we been
[49:49] translated into
[49:52] the kingdom?
[49:54] &gt;&gt; We have been translated.
[49:58] We have been moved
[50:00] from
[50:02] &gt;&gt; this kingdom what they call Leodysia or
[50:05] Leoia, however you pronounce that. They
[50:07] have we have been moved from that
[50:10] kingdom into another kingdom. And that
[50:13] kingdom originates and exists within
[50:15] you.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Within me.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; It's the kingdom of God. And I I forgot
[50:21] I had that scripture. It's Luke 17:21
[50:24] when they're talking about Let's read
[50:27] it.
[50:42] It says that uh
[50:46] where's that? Okay. And when the
[50:48] Pharisees and when he was demanded of
[50:51] the Pharisees, they weren't even nice
[50:52] about it. When the when the kingdom of
[50:56] God should come, he answered them and
[50:57] said, "The kingdom of God cometh not
[51:00] with observation." You can't see it.
[51:04] Not on the outside.
[51:07] Comes without observation. Neither shall
[51:09] they say, "Lo here, lo there." For
[51:11] behold, the kingdom of God is within
[51:14] you.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; You look at this guy. Okay. Yeah, I get
[51:19] scratchy places on my arms. I had to go
[51:21] get a haircut.
[51:23] You know, all the things we go through
[51:24] in this life, that's not what you're
[51:27] looking at. We are looking at the
[51:29] promise of God. Even as Joshua and Caleb
[51:32] looked all the way back, I brought you
[51:34] out. I'll take you in.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Even though they had to what? They had
[51:40] to fight for it.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; They had to fight for every inch of it.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Did they make mistakes? Yeah, you can
[51:47] read them.
[51:49] But and I always laugh. Maybe I
[51:52] shouldn't laugh, but I I chuckle because
[51:54] you know they were so commanded. Don't
[51:57] make any covenants. What's the first
[51:59] thing they did? Before they even got
[52:01] there, they made a covenant with Rahab.
[52:07] Big no. And even when they go back and
[52:10] tell Joshua, he says they he they told
[52:13] what befell them, what circumstance
[52:17] caused them to make a covenant when they
[52:20] weren't supposed to do that.
[52:22] Or then there was the I believe it's the
[52:24] Gibeonites not so long after. And here,
[52:28] you know, Israel, they're they're
[52:29] feeling sorry for these guys because
[52:31] they have the the old clothes, the moldy
[52:35] bread, all that. And then, well, okay,
[52:37] we'll make a covenant with you.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; H
[52:41] hello,
[52:43] &gt;&gt; we make mistakes.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; We all make what look like mistakes, but
[52:49] if we give those things back to God,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. with the Gibeonites. God
[52:56] actually raised up the Gibeonites
[52:58] because they were a strong tribe.
[53:01] And when the other tribes all saw that,
[53:04] oh, the Gibeonites, they made a covenant
[53:07] with Israel. Let's go kill the
[53:08] Gibeonites.
[53:10] Well, the Gibeonites, they got a nice
[53:12] protector. They have Israel and the God
[53:15] of Israel. God said, "I raised this up
[53:18] so that I could destroy those kingdoms
[53:20] all at one time. So you don't have to
[53:22] fight each one individually."
[53:25] H
[53:27] So their mistake
[53:29] was the power and the grace of God,
[53:32] although it's still a thorn in their
[53:34] flesh to this day.
[53:37] But see, we are being translated. We are
[53:40] being moved.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. from one place and the life
[53:45] &gt;&gt; that's in the water of God's word.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; The life is being translated into us.
[53:55] You are receiving the life of
[53:58] translation right now.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are receiving the word of
[54:02] God, whoever you are, wherever you are,
[54:05] you are, as we read last week, we have
[54:09] the mind of Christ.
[54:12] As we've been around a lot of different
[54:14] languages, and I try to learn as much of
[54:17] I can as I can anywhere I go because I
[54:19] have found out that if you can learn
[54:22] even a little bit of the language, it
[54:24] gives you kind of an open door to how
[54:27] they think.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. how people think Spanish
[54:33] they it's similar in a lot of ways to
[54:36] English but they reverse everything
[54:41] they reverse it you know when I speak
[54:43] and people ask me because I know a whole
[54:45] lot of Spanish words I've been there a
[54:47] lot and but when I try to speak it they
[54:50] just laugh and shake their heads they go
[54:52] brother we know what you're saying but
[54:53] that's not Spanish
[54:56] that's and I call it spanglish
[54:59] Yeah, I know it's spanglish, but that's
[55:02] because I don't reverse the stuff. Well,
[55:05] when we're in Japan, now that's a holy
[55:08] that's a whole different kind of thing
[55:10] cuz it's not only at least English and
[55:12] Spanish, you know, kind of the same
[55:14] words, same alphabet. No, no, not over
[55:17] there. And it's not even the same side
[55:20] of your brain, right?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Left brain, right brain. And it's they
[55:26] say it's one of the hardest languages to
[55:27] to learn because you got to switch your
[55:30] entire way of thinking.
[55:33] They claim that you know artists and and
[55:36] and musicians have a little better
[55:38] chance because they use that creative
[55:40] side of the brain. Their whole language
[55:42] is that way. And the translation I know
[55:45] in Malagasi we the translations
[55:49] sometimes
[55:51] I might say
[55:53] you know a sentence you know God said
[55:55] let's go here. Well sometimes they can
[55:58] do that in one word
[56:01] &gt;&gt; and the next time I'm thinking oh that
[56:03] was easy. So you say something simple
[56:07] and it goes on and on and on.
[56:12] And I'll ask people, did he say the
[56:13] right the same? Oh, yeah. He said the
[56:15] same thing.
[56:19] But it's how you approach the language.
[56:21] I'm sure I see the sister back there
[56:23] smiling. The sisters
[56:26] and you know for Russian, Ukrainian, all
[56:29] those different things
[56:31] to really understand the people and to
[56:34] understand what's going on. If you can
[56:37] get into the language and get into the
[56:39] spirit of the language, then what
[56:41] happens? You can begin to communicate. I
[56:45] call it hearttoheart
[56:48] &gt;&gt; because just knowing the language
[56:50] doesn't always tell you the heart of the
[56:52] people.
[56:54] But God so loved the world, he gave his
[56:57] only begotten son. And that son sends
[57:01] forth the Holy Spirit so that we not
[57:04] only have the rema or the written word.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; But we can step into the spirit of God
[57:13] to understand the heart.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Of Jesus Christ.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; To take on the life of Jesus Christ. to
[57:22] not only move the water from place to
[57:24] place, but to receive the water and the
[57:28] life that's in it.
[57:31] And we talked again a little bit last
[57:33] week about translation and what how that
[57:38] you can learn, you know, like a word at
[57:40] a time or like I which is kind of the
[57:42] way I have learned Spanish and I almost
[57:45] got
[57:47] well, I wouldn't say conversational in
[57:49] French. Whoever made French, they say it
[57:52] like a joke. They said whoever was
[57:54] writing out that language, they were
[57:56] getting paid by the letter and that's
[57:58] why they have all those extra letters.
[58:01] And you know, I won't fight with them,
[58:03] but I How do you get D and it's D E Aux?
[58:07] I don't know.
[58:09] But it's just the nature of the
[58:12] language. And we need to step into the
[58:16] nature of Jesus Christ by way of
[58:19] receiving the life of Christ, the life
[58:22] that's in the water.
[58:24] So,
[58:26] and as we do that, we look back again to
[58:29] Israel. How did they do that? They did
[58:31] it one step at a time.
[58:34] The first day or whatever, you know,
[58:36] day, weeks, however long it took. I
[58:38] don't know the exact time period, but
[58:41] when Moses went in, oh, they were all
[58:43] excited. Oh, we're going to be
[58:45] delivered. And then Pharaoh took away
[58:46] the the straw. All of a sudden, the walk
[58:49] got a little tougher. And they wanted to
[58:51] even stone Moses.
[58:54] and
[58:55] how that but every day after every
[58:58] plague all those things however long it
[59:02] took every day they got closer and
[59:06] closer and became the fulfillment of the
[59:10] promise every day you walk with Jesus
[59:13] Christ every time we pick up a Bible we
[59:16] pray in the name of Jesus Christ we get
[59:19] in the spirit through song through
[59:21] worship through praise through
[59:22] thanksgiving
[59:24] All those things take us one more step,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; amen,
[59:29] &gt;&gt; into the promise.
[59:31] And that promise or those promises,
[59:34] however you want to look at it, they're
[59:36] here.
[59:38] We look at it, I look at it sometimes
[59:42] as, well,
[59:45] what do you mean they're here? Because
[59:47] you look, we look around and we see all
[59:49] the darkness. And it says we got
[59:51] delivered from the darkness.
[59:53] But we as we look at those things, it's
[59:56] not the darkness that we're supposed to
[59:59] be concerned about because there is a
[1:00:01] scripture that actually said God is
[1:00:03] revealed in the thick thick darkness.
[1:00:06] You remember which one that is, brother?
[1:00:10] So God can even be revealed or reveal
[1:00:13] himself in the darkness.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; God reveals himself. Well, why is that?
[1:00:21] Because he's the light.
[1:00:23] He is the light.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; And where it doesn't matter how dark it
[1:00:28] is.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; He can be. He is revealed because
[1:00:32] darkness has no part of him.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; And so he is revealed. And how how do
[1:00:39] these things happen? Let's look at
[1:00:41] Isaiah 28. Um we're doing okay.
[1:00:49] and how we're entering into things
[1:00:54] far quicker and far greater than I
[1:00:57] believe sometimes I understand
[1:01:00] as Christians. Do we really understand
[1:01:03] this? In Isaiah 28,
[1:01:05] we might have mentioned this last week
[1:01:07] and it starts out there in Isaiah 28:5.
[1:01:11] In that day the Lord shall the Lord of
[1:01:13] hosts be a crown of glory and for a
[1:01:16] diadem of beauty unto the residue of his
[1:01:18] people. In that day shall the Lord of
[1:01:21] hosts.
[1:01:23] Pay attention when you see it says well
[1:01:26] the Lord did this, the Lord did that and
[1:01:28] how it announces it. We realize with
[1:01:32] Abraham at the time of the sacrifice,
[1:01:35] God appeared in a certain form and it
[1:01:38] was I believe Jehovah Gyra and and
[1:01:42] which is God our provider. But it also
[1:01:44] means the God who sees.
[1:01:48] important
[1:01:50] because when Abraham was about to slay
[1:01:54] that child, the God who sees
[1:01:58] looked all the way into the bottom of
[1:02:00] Abraham's heart and said, "You don't
[1:02:02] have to kill him
[1:02:05] because I see your heart, Abraham.
[1:02:09] I see that you would do it regardless."
[1:02:13] And when he saw,
[1:02:16] then what? He appears as a ram where
[1:02:20] behind him.
[1:02:22] So here is Abraham. I want you to think
[1:02:24] about this. Here's Abraham and ready to
[1:02:28] do this. And God, oh, you don't have to
[1:02:30] do it, Abraham. Ah, hallelujah.
[1:02:34] Praise the Lord. He saw that Abraham
[1:02:37] because you read about it in the book of
[1:02:38] Romans said Abraham believed that if he
[1:02:41] killed him, he was able to raise him up
[1:02:43] because God gave him to him as one from
[1:02:45] the dead. So when God saw that Abraham
[1:02:49] recognized him as a resurrection,
[1:02:53] he knew that the God
[1:02:56] God saw that Abraham believed him as the
[1:02:59] resurrection. I am the resurrection and
[1:03:02] the life. Who's the resurrection? The I
[1:03:04] am.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection.
[1:03:10] And when he saw that Abraham believed
[1:03:13] him in that form, he said, "You don't
[1:03:15] have to kill him." And then he appears
[1:03:18] behind him as a ram caught in the brush.
[1:03:20] Behind him,
[1:03:22] how did Abraham know it was there?
[1:03:25] Have not we seen in this last I'll say
[1:03:29] this last age
[1:03:31] that a prophet of God turned his back on
[1:03:34] the audience
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; and said, "Hey, you over here, Mrs. So
[1:03:37] and so in blue dress. you over here,
[1:03:39] mister.
[1:03:40] What was he showing us? It was the same
[1:03:43] God.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; That was with Abraham.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Is here tonight.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And he sees and he knows.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; He knows
[1:03:56] what we believe. He knows us personally.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:02] And if we believe him as the
[1:04:04] resurrection and we begin to testify, I
[1:04:08] said there the Lord of hosts. Do you
[1:04:10] know what the Lord of hosts actually is?
[1:04:12] It's God coming with all of his saints.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; So what day is he talking about right
[1:04:19] now?
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Because because God is on the scene with
[1:04:23] his saints, with his host,
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; with his bride.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because as we walk day by day, we
[1:04:31] are walking into the fullness
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; of the promise.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; It's already here.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; It's already within you. The full
[1:04:39] promise lies within us.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; The kingdom, the entirety of the kingdom
[1:04:45] lays within you.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; It lays within us.
[1:04:51] And the kingdom, that's another word. If
[1:04:53] you if we think about it in the old
[1:04:55] times, when we talk about the kingdom of
[1:04:58] God, it's not just
[1:05:01] the the geography of the kingdom. It's
[1:05:04] everything in the kingdom belongs to the
[1:05:08] king.
[1:05:10] You look at Ahazerus and and some of
[1:05:13] those other prophets, they had the right
[1:05:15] if some they didn't like somebody, they
[1:05:16] just kill them because they were his
[1:05:19] property. You are God's property.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; When we have given ourselves to Jesus
[1:05:27] Christ and became members as it were of
[1:05:30] the kingdom,
[1:05:32] we are his property.
[1:05:35] You say, "Whoa, wow. That's kind of H.
[1:05:38] But there's benefits to that
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; because he's the God who heals.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; He is the God who supplies your needs,
[1:05:47] our needs. He is the God who fights our
[1:05:51] battles.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; We're in a battle, but we're not the
[1:05:54] ones that have to fight it.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; He does. Just like Israel fought for the
[1:05:59] Gibeonites.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; He becomes our everything.
[1:06:05] That's right.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And so in the day of the Lord of hosts,
[1:06:10] which is God coming with his and if you
[1:06:12] have a doubt, you know, he's really here
[1:06:14] with all of his saints.
[1:06:16] Have you not read in Hebrews chapter 12,
[1:06:19] we are encompassed about by such a great
[1:06:22] cloud of witnesses? I'll flip back
[1:06:23] there. Keep your finger in Isaiah, but
[1:06:24] let's read it real quick. Hebrews
[1:06:27] chapter 12
[1:06:30] starts out, "Wherefore, seeing we also
[1:06:33] are accompassed about with some great
[1:06:36] cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
[1:06:38] every weight of sin which doth easily
[1:06:40] beset us, and let us run with patience
[1:06:42] the race that set before us.
[1:06:47] Looking where?" unto Jesus, the author
[1:06:49] and finisher of our faith, who for the
[1:06:51] joy set before him endured the cross,
[1:06:53] despised the shame, and is sat down at
[1:06:55] the right hand of the throne of God.
[1:06:58] We are compassed. We are
[1:07:03] That's a now word.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; That's a right now word. And he said,
[1:07:07] "They're here. Don't see them,
[1:07:12] but they're here."
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Not because whether I see them or not
[1:07:16] doesn't matter. That's right.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; They're here because God said they are.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; And the host of heaven is here. Remember
[1:07:24] when Elijah and Ghesa and they were
[1:07:27] surrounded and it looked terrible. I
[1:07:30] mean, his servants going, "Oh, master,
[1:07:32] what are we going to do? Lord open his
[1:07:35] eyes." And when they looked outside,
[1:07:38] there was a greater host with them
[1:07:41] than against them. There is a greater
[1:07:43] host with you tonight
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; than there is against you.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Hope this is giving you a little
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Okay, back to Isaiah. And the spirit,
[1:07:58] okay, cameth the residue of his people
[1:08:00] and for a spirit of judgment to him that
[1:08:03] sits in judgment and strength to them
[1:08:05] that turn the battle to the gate.
[1:08:08] So why is the Lord of hosts here? It's
[1:08:12] for a spirit of judgment. Now I know
[1:08:15] most people think they get judgment and
[1:08:17] justice confused. No. Judgment is the
[1:08:21] law spoke against everybody.
[1:08:24] No man could keep the law. Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] was the only one who could and did
[1:08:29] because he was the fulfillment of the
[1:08:31] law.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And judgment is when we come
[1:08:35] before that judgment seat of Christ. We
[1:08:39] come before that judgment seat and he
[1:08:41] reviews the case. And from the message
[1:08:44] of the hour, we said, you know, he paid
[1:08:46] our price for sin at Calvary. That's why
[1:08:50] we have this cross there to represent
[1:08:53] Calvary. And that's why it's empty
[1:08:55] because he became the resurrection.
[1:08:59] But after that he comes he said and he
[1:09:01] became our lawyer.
[1:09:04] So I'll just step away from here for a
[1:09:06] minute. So okay your your penalty is
[1:09:08] already paid. You got nothing to worry
[1:09:10] about but just in case he becomes the
[1:09:13] lawyer through the Holy Ghost and begins
[1:09:16] to plead the case because the judge is
[1:09:19] up here and and so here your lawyer is
[1:09:21] that Christ becomes our lawyer. And we
[1:09:24] start to, you know, we look at the case
[1:09:25] and and and he said that he paid for
[1:09:29] every sin,
[1:09:32] for every believer
[1:09:34] from the very first one all the way
[1:09:36] through the last one. When he was on
[1:09:39] that altar of sacrifice or on that altar
[1:09:42] of
[1:09:44] uh
[1:09:46] becoming our lawyer, he covered every
[1:09:49] sin. Your honor, they didn't mean to do
[1:09:51] that. They repented. There is no sin.
[1:09:56] And so then the judgment seat becomes
[1:09:59] the greatest mercy
[1:10:02] that was ever on the face of the earth
[1:10:05] because only the judge has the right to
[1:10:08] say.
[1:10:10] Case dismissed. Absolutely. God bless
[1:10:12] you, brother.
[1:10:14] Case dismissed. And the next thing
[1:10:16] they'll say, you can leave the
[1:10:19] courtroom. get out fast.
[1:10:24] I'm going go to the story, but it cost
[1:10:26] me a lot of money because I didn't
[1:10:30] don't do what I did.
[1:10:34] So, it becomes the greatest mercy. And
[1:10:37] when people say, "Oh, no, don't you
[1:10:39] judgment. Oh, judgment." No, we're not
[1:10:41] talking about justicees means you pay
[1:10:43] for what you did.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ already paid it for you.
[1:10:48] Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Already paid it. Paid it and then
[1:10:52] wrestled before the judgment seat. And
[1:10:54] then he stepped around and becomes the
[1:10:57] judge
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; and he said, "You're done. You're
[1:11:00] finished. Get out of here."
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; And with that judgment, what does it
[1:11:11] give? Strength to turn the battle to the
[1:11:14] gate.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:16] What was the promise to Abraham?
[1:11:19] Abraham, thy seed shall possess the
[1:11:21] gates of its enemies.
[1:11:24] And when he becomes the judge, that's
[1:11:27] when the strength comes to where we can
[1:11:30] turn back and say, "Satan, you are a
[1:11:33] liar."
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; I refuse to believe.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. I refuse to believe
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; whatever it is, that sickness, that
[1:11:42] bill, that that you're going to die,
[1:11:45] you're, you know, all the things. Hey,
[1:11:47] he runs that stuff constantly over us as
[1:11:51] believers trying to get to us. But what
[1:11:53] did we read from Revelations? They
[1:11:55] overcame how?
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; By the blood of the lamb, which was the
[1:11:59] sacrifice.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; And what? By their testimony. Testimony
[1:12:05] of what? That's right. The testimony of
[1:12:08] believing the word of God.
[1:12:12] The testimony of believing what God said
[1:12:15] about you. What God said about me and
[1:12:20] testifying unto he's already come with
[1:12:24] his saints. I am gathered. They are
[1:12:26] gathered about us tonight. That's right.
[1:12:29] whether I see him or whether I don't
[1:12:31] doesn't matter because they're part of
[1:12:34] this kingdom. And then, you know, if you
[1:12:36] want to get into the speaking the word
[1:12:37] and and the double anointing, why is it
[1:12:40] so important for that double anointing?
[1:12:42] Because somebody has to be able to not
[1:12:44] only speak for themselves to get out of
[1:12:46] this world without death.
[1:12:49] Brother Brandham said, we have to be
[1:12:51] able to turn back and call for the
[1:12:54] generation before us.
[1:12:58] Because when he used that scripture uh
[1:13:00] the first shall be last and the last
[1:13:02] shall be first. He said what is that? He
[1:13:05] said that is those that are in the last
[1:13:07] time because we know we will know if we
[1:13:12] don't maybe right now we'll know who it
[1:13:14] is. And he said we will turn back and
[1:13:17] call for them. So the last will be the
[1:13:20] first to receive the revelation of God
[1:13:22] to get us out of here.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. And he said, "And we will
[1:13:25] turn to that generation who in turn will
[1:13:28] turn to the next generation to the next
[1:13:31] to the next to the next until it gets
[1:13:33] back to Paul and his group." How
[1:13:36] important was it that a prophet said, "I
[1:13:38] preached what Paul preached."
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; And when it gets back there, the first
[1:13:44] will be the last to receive the
[1:13:47] revelation to get out of here.
[1:13:52] You're smiling, brother. You know it's
[1:13:54] the truth.
[1:13:56] Amen. Brothers, sister,
[1:14:00] we are to have an anointing so powerful.
[1:14:05] Scripture, I believe, calls it double
[1:14:06] anointing or something along that line
[1:14:09] to where we not only speak for
[1:14:11] ourselves, but we speak for the
[1:14:12] generation before us. And as that
[1:14:16] anointing rolls back through time, the
[1:14:19] last
[1:14:22] become our first and the first become
[1:14:24] the last to leave this globe.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; And it comes by translation. I haven't
[1:14:31] even got to that scripture yet, have I?
[1:14:33] Praise the Lord. Well, we're still doing
[1:14:35] okay.
[1:14:37] And he begins to talk. He said they
[1:14:40] aired through wine, strong drink, so
[1:14:42] forth, and they're swallowed up of wine.
[1:14:44] But then he drops down to verse nine.
[1:14:48] Whom shall he teach knowledge? Whom
[1:14:50] shall he make to understand doctrine?
[1:14:52] Them that are weaned from the milk and
[1:14:54] drawn from the breasts.
[1:14:57] Why is that important?
[1:15:01] Because we're not talking about God as
[1:15:03] El Shi
[1:15:05] on the breast. We're talking about the
[1:15:07] Lord of hosts. We're talking the people
[1:15:10] in this scripture are mighty warriors.
[1:15:13] Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; You are warriors.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You're not babies anymore. You've been
[1:15:19] drawn from the breast.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; We Oh, I love it when, you know, God
[1:15:23] comes along and gives us a milk of the
[1:15:27] word and stuff, but that's all there for
[1:15:30] us to give us the strength to be the
[1:15:32] warriors to withstand the enemy at the
[1:15:35] gate through the spirit of judgment. And
[1:15:39] then he goes precept upon precept,
[1:15:41] precept upon precept, line upon line,
[1:15:44] line upon line. Here a little, there a
[1:15:45] little. For with stammering lips and
[1:15:48] another tongue will he speak to this
[1:15:49] people.
[1:15:51] What to whom he has said, this is the
[1:15:54] rest.
[1:15:56] What's our rest?
[1:15:59] H precept upon precept. We've given you
[1:16:04] a few tonight by the grace of God. I
[1:16:06] It's not me. It's not brother David.
[1:16:09] It's Christ. When we go into this word,
[1:16:11] I we prayed. Let's make a journey. We
[1:16:13] started into this.
[1:16:15] And it's precept. That's a precept.
[1:16:19] The saints are here. Precept upon
[1:16:22] precept. We're moving from slavery to
[1:16:26] freedom. Upon precept, from freedom into
[1:16:30] a promised land. Precept upon precept.
[1:16:34] as we learn these things, as we we
[1:16:36] become the things that we are learning,
[1:16:40] because that anointing is on us
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; to become the fulfillment
[1:16:46] of God's word in this day and this age.
[1:16:50] Somebody has to do it. Why not me?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Why not you?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Claim it.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Precept upon precept, line upon line.
[1:17:03] And how do we get to there? For with
[1:17:05] stammering lips and another tongue will
[1:17:07] he speak to this people
[1:17:10] to whom he said, "This is the rest
[1:17:11] wherewith he may cause the weary to
[1:17:13] rest. And this is the refreshing yet
[1:17:15] they would not hear.
[1:17:19] This is the rest." Well, the stammering
[1:17:21] lips in another tongue. That refers to
[1:17:23] the Holy Ghost, but it also re refers
[1:17:28] to,
[1:17:30] have you ever stammered when you were
[1:17:31] trying to learn a new language? I do it
[1:17:34] all the time. That's why I get laughed
[1:17:36] at. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; With stammering lips. Lips that don't
[1:17:42] always understand or know how to speak.
[1:17:46] It's because I don't always know how to
[1:17:48] speak in this situation I'm in.
[1:17:51] Sometimes, you know, I try to get people
[1:17:54] to the word of God as best I can
[1:17:58] and but it doesn't always come out
[1:18:01] right. And it's because we're caught
[1:18:03] between we're caught in this, you know,
[1:18:06] what if I have precept upon precept upon
[1:18:08] precept, but I haven't got to the fourth
[1:18:10] one
[1:18:12] because it's a walk. It's a journey.
[1:18:14] It's a journey by way of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:17] upon us and within us into the word of
[1:18:21] God, into the mind of Christ.
[1:18:25] We're making this journey, friends.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; The fulfillment of the promise lies
[1:18:30] within us.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; It's already there. The kingdom is
[1:18:34] within you. Two scriptures and then
[1:18:36] we'll close. Lord,
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; and it comes line upon line, precept
[1:18:41] upon precept. Maybe we come back to that
[1:18:43] sometime, but not tonight. Let's look at
[1:18:45] Psalms
[1:18:50] and it's uh Psalms 21.
[1:18:55] And how perfect the word of God is. I I
[1:19:00] love it. I just I don't spend enough
[1:19:03] time in it. I as much as I want,
[1:19:07] but when you when God opens something
[1:19:10] up, it just amazes me. I stand I tell
[1:19:13] people sometimes, I stand amazed.
[1:19:16] As I go, wow.
[1:19:20] Psalms 21:es 1 and 2. And the king shall
[1:19:24] joy in thy strength, O Lord, and in thy
[1:19:29] salvation. How greatly shall he rejoice.
[1:19:34] Do you know the word rapture that we use
[1:19:36] so much that isn't in the Bible
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; was my son Jonathan was re you know
[1:19:41] studied this out it actually means
[1:19:43] extreme or complete joy.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; So the king shall joy in who? And thy
[1:19:50] strength the strength of the I am God.
[1:19:53] We our joy our what we call rapture
[1:19:58] is from the strength of God. Oh Lord,
[1:20:02] and in thy salvation, how greatly shall
[1:20:05] he rejoice.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Now, why? Who's the king? We know Jesus
[1:20:10] Christ is the king. In fact, he's the
[1:20:11] king of kings.
[1:20:14] But look at the next verse. Thou hast
[1:20:17] given him his heart's desire and hast
[1:20:20] not withholden or withheld the request
[1:20:23] of his lips. So his joy and his
[1:20:27] strength. There's another scripture I
[1:20:29] believe it's not Habacook but it says
[1:20:30] the joy of the Lord is our strength and
[1:20:33] the joy of the Lord you know the is the
[1:20:36] strength and it's God's strength and it
[1:20:39] brings salvation in which we can rejoice
[1:20:41] in it comes back to this and said
[1:20:44] because thou hast given him his heart's
[1:20:46] desire and didn't withhold the request
[1:20:50] of his lips and it says sila you know
[1:20:52] what sila means it's a musical interlude
[1:20:54] or time for the music to unfold. Music
[1:20:59] is also a type of prophecy. When you
[1:21:01] sing these songs, you're prophesying.
[1:21:04] That's why sometimes I'll hear a song
[1:21:06] that says, you know, that Jesus is way
[1:21:07] off in the future. I don't sing it that
[1:21:09] way. So, if you hear me singing weird,
[1:21:11] it's okay. I'm just singing it, Lord,
[1:21:14] you're here
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; because that's what the word says.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; He's here. They're here. And so, but it
[1:21:22] says he
[1:21:24] he didn't withhold his lips, but in that
[1:21:27] space of time for the music or for the
[1:21:30] prophecies to unfold. Let's look at
[1:21:34] we'll close with this. John the 17th
[1:21:36] chapter. What re caused him to rejoice?
[1:21:40] What caused him this rejoicing? What
[1:21:44] caused him this strength, this joy?
[1:21:48] And we go to John 17.
[1:21:50] You know, last time we read John 14 and
[1:21:52] he said, "I in you, you in me." And so
[1:21:55] on,
[1:21:57] but in John 17,
[1:21:59] I love this
[1:22:03] because he kind of repeats it in a way.
[1:22:08] I'll go ahead and start verse 20.
[1:22:11] Neither pray I these for these alone,
[1:22:14] but for them also which shall believe on
[1:22:16] me through thy through their word.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Through their word.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; They believe on me through their word.
[1:22:27] How did they get out of there? By the
[1:22:30] blood and by their testimony. Okay, I'm
[1:22:33] glad I read that. that they may all be
[1:22:35] one, as thou art in me, and I in thee,
[1:22:39] and they also be one in us, that the
[1:22:43] world may believe that thou hast sent
[1:22:45] me, and that the glory which thou gavest
[1:22:47] me, I have given them, and they may be
[1:22:51] one, even as we are one, I in them, and
[1:22:54] thou in me, that they may be perfect.
[1:22:58] That's complete.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Perfect and complete in one. and that
[1:23:02] the world may know that thou has sent me
[1:23:04] and hast loved them.
[1:23:08] That the world might know that you sent
[1:23:11] me and that you love them. I'm pointing
[1:23:14] at every one of you.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; He loves you.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; He loves you. He loves me. And then
[1:23:26] watch this scripture. Well, this is the
[1:23:28] one I was going to thinking I' I'd
[1:23:29] finish with. Father, I will
[1:23:34] I will that they also whom thou hast
[1:23:37] given me be with me where I am, that
[1:23:41] they may behold my glory which thou hast
[1:23:44] given me. For thou lovest me before the
[1:23:47] foundation of the world.
[1:23:52] Father, I will.
[1:23:56] It's the will of
[1:23:59] the father, the I am that
[1:24:04] we be given to Jesus Christ as a bride,
[1:24:08] that where
[1:24:10] that they be with me, that where I am,
[1:24:15] they may behold my glory which thou hast
[1:24:18] given me because you loved me from the
[1:24:20] foundation of the world. And God's love
[1:24:23] for Jesus Christ is transmitted into us.
[1:24:27] And we by our testimony
[1:24:30] become the love of God in Jesus Christ
[1:24:33] to a dying world.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; You are the love affair with Jesus
[1:24:40] Christ.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; You are the love of God being displayed
[1:24:44] in this world.
[1:24:46] You are the joy of the Lord because God
[1:24:51] granted the king,
[1:24:54] his word, his desire, his will that we
[1:24:58] be with him where he is
[1:25:02] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:25:05] then there verse 26. And I have declared
[1:25:08] unto them thy name and will declare it.
[1:25:11] and the love wherewith thou hast loved
[1:25:13] me may be in them and I in them.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; It's God's love through Jesus Christ
[1:25:21] transmitted to us as we drink the water
[1:25:26] precept upon precept. Just keep walking
[1:25:32] and keep drinking
[1:25:35] because God will and has given granted
[1:25:39] the king his desire and it's his desire
[1:25:43] that we be with him. God bless you.
[1:25:47] Let's stand.
[1:25:50] Gracious heavenly father, I love you
[1:25:52] tonight. I thank you. Give you praise,
[1:25:54] honor, and glory. Lord
[1:25:57] Jesus, I want to say that with more
[1:25:58] sincerity.
[1:26:01] Jesus, I love you.
[1:26:04] I love you.
[1:26:06] I love your people,
[1:26:08] God. And I know that these that are here
[1:26:10] tonight and some of those out there on
[1:26:12] the line, they love you, too.
[1:26:16] And Lord, those other generations before
[1:26:18] us as we speak, may they maybe they're
[1:26:20] here tonight.
[1:26:22] We look at as a small group. This could
[1:26:24] be a stadium here tonight listening to
[1:26:27] the declaration of your word.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; As we call your word on this scene
[1:26:33] tonight,
[1:26:35] Lord, touch for healing. Touch for to
[1:26:38] overcome grief. Touch to whatever it
[1:26:41] might be tonight that they have need of.
[1:26:45] Brother spoke and said he's, you know,
[1:26:47] his job's been driving him crazy. Lord,
[1:26:50] you can turn that around in a heartbeat.
[1:26:54] We could go on and on with how many
[1:26:56] things you've done for us.
[1:26:59] God, I love you. I thank you as we give
[1:27:02] you this service in the mighty name of
[1:27:04] Jesus Christ for your honor and glory.
[1:27:08] Amen. I in them that where I am, you
[1:27:11] might be also.
[1:27:13] Praise the Lord. There she is.
[1:27:17] You know that I bless your name. You
[1:27:19] know that song? I I've been thinking
[1:27:20] about that and I even wrote it down.
[1:27:25] There's another scripture in Proverbs
[1:27:26] that I like that says, "A divine
[1:27:28] sentence
[1:27:30] is in the lips of a king." It's the
[1:27:33] divine sentence is you never did it.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Get out of the courtroom.
[1:27:39] And where is it? It's in the lips of the
[1:27:41] king. Right now, you're his lips.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; It's your testimony, my testimony, and
[1:27:48] the blood of Jesus Christ. Go ahead,
[1:27:50] sister.
[1:27:52] You know, you don't know.
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:28:01] I bless his name, you know. I bless his
[1:28:05] name.
[1:28:09] I bless his name.
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:15] I give him all
[1:28:22] under give him praise
[1:28:30] the light.
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:40] There we go. I bless your name.
[1:28:48] I bless your name. Praise the Lord. Stop
[1:28:53] for just a second.
[1:28:56] There's another song. I will bless the
[1:28:59] the Lord at all times. His praise shall
[1:29:02] be continually in my heart or in my
[1:29:05] mouth. Uh,
[1:29:07] any of you ever been to a football game?
[1:29:10] When somebody makes a touchdown, what's
[1:29:12] do people do? Do they go, "Praise the
[1:29:16] Lord. He made a touchdown."
[1:29:20] No, no, no. Hallelujah. He made a
[1:29:24] touchdown. Let's speed it up a little,
[1:29:26] sister. Don't Not your fault. Okay. Some
[1:29:30] midnight hour.
[1:29:36] The light
[1:29:39] give you life.
[1:29:43] Burn in your mind.
[1:29:48] Reach out and pray.
[1:29:53] defy those chains
[1:29:58] and they will fall
[1:30:02] in Jesus name. That's better. Yeah. I
[1:30:08] bless your name.

[1:32:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[1:32:10] brother David. Enjoy that tonight.
[1:32:13] Um I had a
[1:32:16] song on my mind. Um
[1:32:18] Oh, how He loves You and me. Can you
[1:32:20] find that?
[1:32:29] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:32:39] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:49] He gave himself.
[1:32:54] What more could he do?
[1:33:00] Oh, how he loves you.
[1:33:05] Oh, how he loves me.
[1:33:10] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:33:21] Jesus
[1:33:23] to Calary
[1:33:25] did go
[1:33:31] his love for mankind
[1:33:35] to show
[1:33:41] what he did there
[1:33:45] brought peace
[1:33:48] despair.
[1:33:51] Oh, how
[1:33:53] he loves you.
[1:33:56] Oh, how he loves me.
[1:34:02] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:34:13] Amen.
[1:34:15] Um, can you find the song Who I am?
[1:34:18] I can see now who I am.
[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:25] B flat.
[1:34:29] Oh, glorious victory.
[1:34:34] That day he set me free
[1:34:38] and he made my heart
[1:34:43] his very throne.
[1:34:48] My life is no longer mine.
[1:34:53] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[1:34:58] And now I live
[1:35:03] to praise his name.
[1:35:08] Who I am, Lord.
[1:35:13] Who I am.
[1:35:18] Oh, I can see now
[1:35:23] who I am.
[1:35:26] am
[1:35:28] a part of my savior,
[1:35:33] a part of his word.
[1:35:37] It's a revelation
[1:35:42] of who I am.
[1:35:47] On Calvary,
[1:35:50] he died
[1:35:52] to redeem his lost bride,
[1:35:57] the King of Kings.
[1:36:02] He became my Savior.
[1:36:07] This is God's great mystery.
[1:36:12] of love expressed in me
[1:36:17] that Christ said I
[1:36:22] might be made one.
[1:36:28] Who I am, Lord,
[1:36:33] who I am.
[1:36:37] Oh, I can see now
[1:36:43] who I am.
[1:36:48] A part of my Savior,
[1:36:53] a part of his word.
[1:36:57] It's a revelation
[1:37:02] of who I am.
[1:37:07] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[1:37:13] Who I am.
[1:37:18] I can see now.
[1:37:23] Who I am.
[1:37:28] A part of my Savior.
[1:37:33] a part of his word.
[1:37:37] It's a revelation
[1:37:42] and it's predestination
[1:37:47] of who I am.
[1:37:53] Amen.
[1:37:56] Give me the B B flat.
[1:38:00] All he wants
[1:38:04] is you.
[1:38:10] No
[1:38:11] one else
[1:38:14] will do.
[1:38:20] Not just a part.
[1:38:24] He wants all of your heart.

[1:39:30] of me.
[1:39:34] All
[1:39:35] he wants
[1:39:38] is me. Sing verse one again.
[1:39:43] Oh, all
[1:39:46] he wants
[1:39:48] is me.
[1:39:54] No
[1:39:56] one else
