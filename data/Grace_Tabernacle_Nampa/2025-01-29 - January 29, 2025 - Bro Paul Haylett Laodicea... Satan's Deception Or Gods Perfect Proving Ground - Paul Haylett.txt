declare the end of what's today the confusion we'll start on tomorrow amen we can say Amen to that isn't it he he's just so wonderful to us and he's so good to us and you know um just uh you know I won't go into it tonight but just all kinds of little things that happen that you realize the hand of the Lord is on that and uh in that you know we we just realize the the the how beautiful it is to be Sons and Daughters of God to be part of this family of God and uh tonight uh before we go forward I you know it's always when when you think about prayer requests and stuff and then you forget those and uh we want to remember uh brother Tim sister Maryam traveling or traveled to Oklahoma I think today uh sister Sue I know would desire to be remembered in prayer and our dear brother and sister brother pant sistera we want to always be faithful and I say God bless you to each and every one of you tonight and it's not snowy outside it's not but it just seems like the sometimes Wednesdays just kind of creep up on you had a brother contact me wanted to have a conversation and and I kind of you know it's like well maybe not now and then he's like it's Wednesday and uh you know so that's just kind of how things are sometimes amen so this evening if we could put up our our title I I it's kind of an interesting or you know different title in the way to to look at things but uh the title tonight is leoda Satan's deception or God's perfect Proving Ground And when you look at that we're not speaking this now to the world out there so it's not you know how how are we fitting this but my brother and sister God's dealing with the bride now we we don't want to sound oh I'm sorry musicians thank you okay now we'll call the end of the confusion for today but uh you know uh um the the day we're living in the word clearly shows us that there is a deception out there and and in that deception many people uh uh find themselves uh good people doing what they perceive as good things or according to the word but yet without wisdom and without wisdom you know we we'll look at that and say this is what we must do but looking through carnal eyes and carnal eyes won't do it and uh so you know we come so my title today is talking about our day our age our time and it's Satan's deception or you can make a decision to have it be God's Proving Ground his perfect Proving Ground have you ever thought Lord why am I here in this age wouldn't it been wonderful walk on the shores of Galilee except for they would have hated you then can I get one more shot at ending today I trust you guys had a wonderful anniversary time and greetings brother Daniel Amen so look at this my brother and sister you see in the day that God placed whatever portion of his bride it was the age of deception and it was the age of God's perfect Proving Ground so let's turn in our Bibles tonight I just want to explain my title a little bit so it wouldn't think that um uh we're here under Satan's deception he wants it to be right that's the very Spirit of leod deia is to deceive the people and many people think that it's like the flash of the hand that he deceives them but a lot of good people just studying in the message brother Bram lays this out a lot of good people just led to sleep and there was the deception they just got LED you see when we speak of the 10 virgins they were all in a sleepy stage it doesn't say that five virgins were diligent and ready on the mark it was a sleepy age Le oysa and yet there were those with an ear to hear and so God come and supernaturally spiritually awaken them that they heard the call and they had the answer already they didn't have to say now what do we do what's next they already knew amen let's turn 1 Corinthians 15 51- 58 and uh we'll just uh take this a very familiar scripture to US 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on IM mortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God Can someone say thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord there is one of Satan's deceptions what I'm doing is not making any difference but God says that this work amen is not in vain amen amen keep pressing on Saints keep fighting weld the sword no matter how discouraging or dark it looks in front of us because God has promised not the pastor not the Evangelist not the prophet but almighty God himself through the word has told you your work your labor is not in vain Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this time together this evening father there may be just a handful of us but Lord we just uh we stand here tonight not to be counted in the crowd not to be counted and not to look as numbers but to be as Sons and Daughters of God standing in your presence we thank you for that ask for your blessings upon all the prayer requests all the needs all the body of Christ in the name of Jesus Amen you may be seated and we always want to you know everything Pops to your head uh I had to take a quick trip um you know uh last week and we was trying to meet up with brother Jose and sister sephi there in the Tri Cities but that didn't work but let's certainly remember them they're just that little group and uh uh you know their their everyday service is just uh very small so we want to lift them up in prayer amen let's go also turn to 1st Samuel 17 starting with the 45th verse and now I hope that uh you know sometimes our thoughts would would come to a place in we tie things together that might not make sense to everyone else I pray it does tonight then said David to the Philistine now comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee and I will give the car Mar us of the host of the Philistines this day and to the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and I want to just look as this okay and all the assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with the sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands amen sister via if you'll just go back to the start of those scriptures amen thank you I'd forgot there was one more verse um now look at this my brother and sister let's read this scripture right now for today let's not look it back into Israel let's look into the hour we are living because we are serving the same God and he does not change so his thoughts that he anointed then is the same thoughts he will anoint today and so we're not trying to misplaced scripture but I believe there's a nice little principle in this and and uh you know he's talking to the enemy he's talking to that Spirit as it were there was Flesh and Blood there but he's talking to that that would desire to destroy God's chosen and when you look at this he's telling them you got a sword you got a spear you've got a shield but what do we have tonight Saints we have got the name of the Lord amen the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is everything that we need in the day that we live and we go out into a world out here and we could try to fight the spirit of leoda with the spirit of leoda and that's not going to work because that's already been a watered down misconstrued stirred up and turned out backwards and that wouldn't work you can't go I had a good friend a little bit of this thought come a man that used to live out close to us and and uh I met him when he was just a a a poor young man trying to get started farming and he would always come and ask me questions and I was always truthful to him and and I I one day just was so truthful I just had to tell him Ben you just don't quite have the farmer Knack you might want to think about doing something different and Ben went on and did something different started buying and selling equipment and and has now built up a very very large substantial business with many many employees and and doing very well and I I I saw him uh uh yesterday in fact and you know we're standing in an agriculture culture show in Caldwell and and all of his employees and salesmen are standing around hoping to meet someone to sell them and we're standing there talking about the things of the Lord and talking about how good God is and how that he has seen God answer so many prayers and and as we're talking you know I'm always trying to reach out a little something but sometimes my brother and sister the spirit of leod deia has put as brother brandham showed us it's put a religious spirit and that religious spirit has covered and everything that you can mention about the word of God and about those sayings they've got a counter to that but there's something missing amen and this is a thing that makes the Warfare of leoda such a scary thing is because men feel like they are all right with God even though there's something missing he made comments to me like he said you know we started going to a certain church and and the you know the wife and I under the stress of this business uh and and the wife and I had been having some strain and we went to a new church and that new church was trying out a new individual just have church in somebody's home in all these little groups and and then they come back together like every second or third Sunday and and he said you know there was this Minister that come to our church and he would speaking and when we walked out of the service that day my wife was so angry at me and he was like I know we have some disagreements I don't spend enough time with you and the children and and some things like that they didn't have something that was life shaking but you know and it's there and she come out of there so angry and she was just like you know if you were like him our marriage would be better and he says you know what Paul a year later it was found out what that man really was he was preaching to the women y not the gospel but something else now what the prophet say the church was in this day a woman I hope you can catch this my brother and sister you see we're not just preaching to any old woman when we get up here and preach we're preaching to a bride we're not trying to draw the woman we're trying to draw the bride and the bride is very specific because there's ownership there does that make sense to you and so there is is a such a difference in the world that we live in because when you preach to the woman you can fill a church up but when you preach to the bride you empty the church and so we see the day that we're living in that when we come we're not coming in a Warfare of Flesh and Blood the scripture says but we're coming fighting against principalities and powers of darkness and in that Warfare of the day my brother and sister if we do not see the true essence of the Warfare that we are fighting and let this be brother or sister tonight that we are looking as individuals but yet as the bride of Christ that God has already called us and prepared us and anointed us and put the Hedge around us job was not more important than you job was not honored by God more than you but it's there that God placing a hedge there says you know what I'm going to get you out of leod deia Victorious amen we should not be here tonight as a defeated people we should be here tonight with a mindset now I know it's easy In the Flesh to have a long day and the stress and strain of life to bring us to church with just a kind of a our own little private Cloud you know that we come into church with but my brother and sister what we should is just by exercise when I say that I'm talking about mechanical approach we should stop and say Lord I'm leaving the world I'm leaving everything that is discouraging or stressful or what is uncertain of tomorrow I'm leaving it out here in the step I don't even want to leave it in my car cuz I don't want to go back to it I'm leaving it out here and I'm coming in the house of God tonight because you promised I would be victorious in Leo deia now if we can convince ourselves enough to labor as we do in the flesh day after day week after week year after year just trying to provide a little bit better a newer car I'm not talking about fancy but you replace the old one and to do this and to do that and we'll do that in the Physical Realm Satan loves that because we get so caught up in those things but we ought to be able to come and say you know what I'm laboring in the gospel El in the presence of God for a brighter future for a better tomorrow that is not wealth or fame or prosperities blah blah blah my brother and sister that's a higher spiritual walk and as we are here in leod deia now God's not calling us to to absolutely forsake everything the Lord doesn't care if you have saved your whole life you have something a little bit nice you have something of that but my brother and sister the word shows us that we forsake take those things for a closer walk am and so as you look at this he David speaking to to uh the Philistines here speaking to this and and telling them you know what uh you come prepared for your form of battle you come with your attitude you know you can imagine Goliath the huge man that he was you know get up in the morning stretch pull out his take his shield grab a spear ready hits right on the mark that's why he wasn't afraid right he could handle a big old sword like it was nothing he could handle the shield to protect himself like it was nothing and the spear not even get close to me before i' drive it through your armor in your chest that was his preparation for war but not to get too caught up tonight my brother and sister God prepared a man named David and he walked down in the brick and you want to talk about spiritual leadership those five Stones he picked up there are some uh theologians that say they were just random stones that God anointed but I think we'll take a different approach to that that God knew exactly where he' stop and exactly where he'd bend over and exactly what stone he would pick up God ordained those stones to be his weapon and those weren't weapons of warfare they were weapons of Faith they were weapons that God chose because how improbable my brother and sister to stand at that distance and take a sling and throw a rock hard enough to drive it into a man's head you see there's a different approach because the weapon is not Satan's weapon it's God's weapon now on on uh Sunday we're talking about that what what is going to be our overcoming power what's going to make us Overcomer even our faith oh oh you didn't give me a chance guys I was going to say even brother bram's faith is going to make no see the thing is God's personalizing it just as it was with David it became so personal that he was there and if he had tried to choose right he already was there could have walked out there with Saul's armor on but he he knew something struck him it wasn't just the fact that the armor was too big for him it was the Revelation that that was not his way to fight the battle oh my brother and sister we don't fight the battle by trying to fill this Church up amen we don't fight the battle by trying to be known throughout the Nations we fight the battle by being faithful to God and faith comes by hearing the word and so the Crux of our world we live in today our faith amen uh F AI t h right is the same God's grace God's faith God's favor my brother and sister it follows all the way down through here God says I've got a way for you to fight the spirit of the age and I need you just to trust me cuz if you'll trust me you'll be victorious but if you go down there clunking in somebody else's armor you go clunking down there packing somebody else's sword that's it amen all the imitators you can go back through it I don't waste the time with names but then several swords you know like brother Brown said you know it wouldn't matter if they said they had the spikes that they crucified Jesus none of that matters but look how those Spirits are even in the realm of the message years ago several men rose up and say God's put that sword in my hand one even had a sword that was uh wherever he got it you know said this is the exact sword but no one could prove it wasn't except for his life proved God would not have placed that sword in his hands sounds judgmental a little bit but it's a truth amen so as you look at this was this boastful see it all is a matter of how we look at it our perspective of it some people would say man David was boastful I would have never said those words and that's why you've never found Victory that's right see you come to a place to be able to stand and imagine if you and I today would take this vocabulary this day the Lord will deliver the into my hand I'm talking to you to Satan tonight I am weak I am feeble I am nothing but you are going to be delivered into my hand by the Lord amen this is what is happening this is how we overcome remember this story where the prophet of God goes to that man and and uh uh gets that carton of cigarettes and sends it to that man that just couldn't seem to overcome smoking now my brother and sister it makes no sense at all for a minister of the Gospel a prophet of God to get someone to buy a carton of cigarettes and send it to a man that that just is so improbable it just don't make sense there's something wonky about this except for it wasn't wonky to the man that had come and when that man handed him that cart and the cigarettes and they said well what's the deal here oh it's from Brother branam boom never touches another cigarette tell me God doesn't know what he's doing God knows how to fight the Battle of Le oia he knows to how to fight the battle and make you and I Overcomers in this age it's not to use the word Overcomer like a cliche I think some people think that the you know when we're talking about overcome overcome overcome we just have a cliche until you're the one in Leo deia that has something you need to overcome and God comes on the scene and you overcome suddenly overcoming is a whole personal subject with you and it ought to be so he tells them you're going to be delivered in my hand and I'm going to smite thee and take thy head from thee my brother and sister I want you to look out and think about politics of the world today headship has been taken from this world rulers presidents premieres prime ministers all stumbling around virtually no Nation on earth now is not drowning in debt and yet you can have a 12 12-year-old balance a checkbook are you with me he's already taken their headship they are it's already taken from them saints s Satan is now here in this time only bluffing that this is his kingdom he already knows he read the word he heard it it's been taken from him just as sure as David speaking to Goliath and it came to pass the word has come now and taken the headship from the the Kings and kingdoms of leoda so now they're under an anointing you got to remember having true headship and just being anointed are entirely different things so one can be anointed to something remember brother brandom baffled a lot of people years ago when he said you could be anointed of the Holy Ghost all the days of your life and go to hell they were like no possible way but we're seeing the evidence of it it is happening and so here we are seeing this scripture brought into light into this day coming right to pass before us and so what he's doing he's taking their headship from him and the people he said carcass now carcass usually is referred to something dead what the prophet of God say would be the spirit of this age Yep they're carcasses it's dead and it's there spiritually dead they've missed the point they think it's about their Church be careful Saints it's not about you or I or the church it's about that relationship with the Lord and so here it is it we're seeing that in the end there's coming even comments being made in the religious world that God is more present than we thought he was but we're Christians We Believe God's omniscient omnipresent but not here if you don't think so just go listen no don't go listen don't waste your don't waste your time but I'll tell you the voices that are there are speaking in the realm of God's put all the power in our hands and that means you buy me a Lear jet that's what they think is religious that's a sign of God's favor I think I've got quite a ways to go Mattel makes Lear Jets they even make them now that you don't even need glue they just snap together so I hope that made sense to you so we live in this age and we have a challenge that is particular to our day my brother and sister the word says there's nothing new Under the Sun but God bringing this kind of particular uh or peculiar challenge in our day is because we are coming to the end of time there's not another age there's not another time God's not prepping us to go into another church Age We Are are coming down at the Fulfillment and the prophet of God anointed I've tried to trim this all down prophet of God anointed to say well we're not even in leysia any longer so if you wondered whether or not you defeated Le oysa hear me well tonight you're not even in Le oysa amen he said you're in the bride age and so it's there that we got to quit trying to fight the spirit of leoda with the weapons of leod deia we need to step into the bride age and fight the spirit of leoda with the bride's weapon and the bride's weapon is just such a simple Weapon It's called the word amen and when we stand on that word and we deal with the spirits of leoda we're going to knock the head off of that concerning our own personal lives there'll be no headship of the spirit of leoda controlling the Bride of Jesus Christ when the Rapture comes amen she will will be absolutely completely free from any Spirit of this age am think about how glorious that is my brother and sister no more will be knocked around and and buffeted we're going to come to the place yes they'll be challenged right because the prophets shows us that we're clearly under the leadership of the holy spirit so then Satan just wants to get you to step a little bit out from underneath that headship and and when we step out from underneath that headship Satan's got a whole big Target it's a little harder to stay under that headship than it sounds isn't it so the buffet of leoda is still here but part of it is Saints we are keeping ourselves in leoda brother brandham says the church should be farther along right by now now not to go in and start throwing things around but even the prophets acknowledging that we're kind of hindering this y Lord don't let it be me help me father I want to be the Overcomer that steps beyond that I don't want to push it off to be someone else but I don't want to be the one hindering this make sense amen so we look at this this age we live in we have challenges that are peculiar to our time the internet let's stop tonight and just examine the internet for a moment is it good or is it evil the mixed multitude it's right there yes mixed fruit right everything is there but you see my brother and sister if people choose for the internet to be evil it is evil to to them but if they choose to be blessed by the internet then they are blessed and so it can carry the gospel and it also can bring uh forth even I I've got notes on the wall I guess I'll preach this one of these days my brother and sister but but you can have deception hidden in truth amen it's it's a little take you might say from the trail of the serpent you can have deception and man preaching and I bring this in tied with what my friend spoke about he figured out they figured out that Spirit something wrong it aggravated his wife you're such an insufficient husband You're such you know a a lagered you're such a waste you're you're and to find out what was the spirit that was anointing the women cuz he said practically every woman in their church was anointed by that spirit and there was such chaos hit their church only to find out I'll just say it out loud only to find out the man was in a dozen or more uh uh Affairs at the very time he was speaking those words what was he doing in the spirit of adultery a leodan It's Always Been Through the Ages but here we are in this time because this is now a time that natural adultery is something that might even be easier to quit and be forgiven of than spiritual adultery natural adultery a man can come and bring himself and be held accountable to his wife and do all of these kind of things and do that but my brother and sisters spiritual adultery follows him day and night everywhere he goes that spirit is there twisting the word deceiving amen and no one even knows it's happening so the internet good or evil just like my title bringing it out you have to decide it all depends on how you look at that and you decide that it's good I can hear the a Bible I can hear this preaching I can gospel real good honest gospel music there's just so much good my brother and sister on the side there's a spirit for every one of those that's evil you know in that time before the Reformation I have some other examples but we'll skip over you guys got the point you you know in the time before the Reformation they didn't even want the Bible printed and what they said was the reason was is you hope you don't mind making a personal today are not intelligent enough to understand it it will only confuse you well I can tell you I lived in a world as a young man when Jerry and I first married that there was certain church and certain Ministries and they actually used that same line and when our eyes were open to that we realized one day we woke up wait this is exactly the same spirit that was there and God anointed uh men like whitecliffe and different ones to come and start to say there's something wrong here these people the just shall live by faith means the just must have the word because it's only the word that brings faith and so here's Luther coming into that movement and and starting to push against this whole spirit that that you guys just need to listen and do what we tell you my brother and sister sometimes that's good amen I know Brother David would know this I know some of the things brother David's gone through the years if people would have just stopped and listened and done what their Pastor or minister or whatever told them they would have been so much better off but the prophet of God in the resume of the ages is talking about how that all through those ages what was happening is the spirit of the nicians was there pushing all the time pushing pushing looking for an opening and every time they found an open whether it was in a church or whether it was in a family or a single person or whatever it was then that comes in there and starts to control their life in other words they're no longer trusting the Holy Ghost they are now trusting man's Wisdom so it becomes a man's leadership and this is the age my brother and sister when that nickan spirit has blossomed and grown to be so large of men telling men what to do or let's put it in the spiritual context it's men telling women what to do because the woman is the church so now you got men that believe they are the voice to the church my brother and sister the prophet of God countered that when he said I never I'll just paraphrase this I I never called anyone to myself that's right there are people say well well that's that's what's the whole thing that's why it's a cult well here again let me say it one more time if we're a cult we're the poorest managed cult on the face of the earth I want to see everyone that's associated come to this church I want to see a higher spiritual walk but pardon me to put this way brother Daniel you're never going to see me beat your door down and demand that you serve God I want to do by God's grace what I was called to do to minister this gospel where it would convince your soul where the Holy Spirit would deal with you at your level in your circumstance in your time and God would do it and then when you walk away you would never say well I believe the message because brother Paul had me in a headlock no I believe the message because the message is Jesus Christ and I'm in love with him I saw him in his Beauty and because for he first loved me but the beauty of his grace and creation and everything brings me to the place I can't help but love him right and then there's nobody can talk you out of something that God talked you into and when I use that talk to you into I don't mean it in the conventional form it's God speaking to the soul speaking to the seed we we understand amen amen but when God shows it to you when God's the one that come if I could put it in a human element and embraced you amen who's going to convince you it's not real that's right so they didn't want the Bible in the hands of the people years ago said they weren't capable to understand but the Bride of that day understood amen now we're here in this age and the same spirit is cropping its head up and there are those that believe it's only in the hands of the clergy and if it was only in my hands Saints you guys are in trouble I'm sorry to tell you that I mean I do my best to be a good pastor and a somewhat reasonable Minister but just follow me around for a day and they would say you know brother Paul you are Vindication or confirmation of one thing when the prophet said backslide daily you're the proof of that that's nothing to boast about but I believe what the prophet said and I don't feel condemned when sometimes I'm frustrated and the different things happen but we're not going to glory in the flesh we are going to look to the word and say Lord the prophet of God showed us we might backslide daily but we repent daily amen and we come back in your presence and come before you daily amen because that we're not left out in the cold of the spirit of leoda but God's given us opportunity to rise up into the bright age amen rising up into the position where we can look back at mistakes and say Lord you know I didn't do that amen now to the average carinal Christian they're going to say what are you talking about you did it but see they don't understand the revelation of the word that God will not hold one thing to the account of his bride just as though I never did it amen but that doesn't mean I go out the next day and do more something about that causes our heart to say Lord forgive me for that deliver me from that anoint me to never go back amen that's the spirit of the Holy Spirit in this day amen the nature I should say of the holy spirit in this day amen so what what struck me in my studies there is the very fact that of every age from the very first age every Age The Bride of that age in in spite of the darkness of the Dark Ages there was a bride who believed it and it wasn't a a belief of ignorance it wasn't a a belief that was connected to being naive but it was Revelation it was pure Revelation came to the Bride of every age and my brother and sister when we look at that is so incredible you know what I think is just startling is when we realize that Satan doesn't just want you to not get Revelation it'd be one thing just to try and block you you know like a mother I watched one time in a store convenience store they come around the end of an island and all the candy was on this side and as that mother come around she just switched hands on that little kid of hers and moved him right over here and the whole way down this deal that little kid could not see one drop of candy my brother and sister it's not God actually trying to hide us unfortunately I'd have to say we are IM immersed in Leo DEA especially you know those that just work in the public you know and interact well you know what forget about working in the public if you go to a grocery store amen you've been immersed in leod deia and so you look at this now but you know what the real issue is Satan is afraid of Revelation you bet he is it's not that he just doesn't want you to have it he's actually afraid of Revelation amen and I'll make this statement I say it bold the devil TR probably dig his Sledgehammer out and trying to hit me with it but he's afraid of Revelation and you know what that actually means the very depth of Satan's afraid of Revelation he's afraid of you that's right the Lord wow now I'm going to be brutal here don't get offended with me how many of you feel like Satan's afraid of you but we need to claim that thought not cuz I said it my brother and sister but the word that is in you the word that you say Amen whether it's verbally or in your heart the word that is giving you life is revelation and if Revelation is in you and Satan's afraid of Revelation then he's afraid of you as the bride of Christ people many years ago kind of mocked and criticized brother Johnnie rean because he just up in the Pulpit there and some of you many of you might have heard that but he says you know you stretch in the morning you wake up and he said you know and you roll over there and put your feet on the side of the bed they're on the floor and then the demons are like oh help me I need help he's got out of [Applause] bed we ought to believe that we ought to take a halz of that and say I'm going to live the kind of life when I get out of bed Satan is saying hey I need reinforcements over here the guy's still living he got out of bed and said praise the Lord for another day and I don't know how to deal with him I need reinforcements but you know brother Donnie used to break that out he said them other demons are out there saying deal with them yourself come on so Revelation in you and I I believe that was one of the reasons not just so we could see with natural eyes but that's one of the reasons the prophet of God said pray for Revelation he knew the power of Revelation in dealing with Satan amen you know it's interesting how powerful fear is yes sir now I I I don't think we have to I don't think we have to be like those guys that I just seen a clip of a video the other day um this guy's on the ledge of a building it has to be at least 12 stories or maybe more the building is being built the guy just goes over there sits down turns around drops down catches the edge of the balcony with his fingers does some one-handed chin-ups I can't even do those does some one-handed chinups then he did what scared me is he pulled himself up no hands spun around caught it again then he threw one leg up and balanced himself are any of you brave enough not 12 stories high I don't even know if I would do it off a back deck at 3 feet but do you see my brother and sister we're living in an age the word says they won't even have fear of anything now when you have that kind of a atmosphere that kind of a world that kind of a mentality do you think they're afraid of hell you think they're afraid have respect for the word natural spiritual you follow me you see what it is this is the age we're coming years ago they would have took a man off to Asylum for for doing that kind of behavior now it's normal and and so as it is there is this this faith that they have in the natural of their own physical strength of their hand their grip their balance they have that natural but they cannot bring that kind of faith into you will not bring natural faith into a spiritual realm because the natural the carnal can only go so far and then God designed you and I to trust him to go further amen and not we're not here to do acrobats with the word no you know we're not here to do dog and pony shows sorry to put it that way in the church we're not here to put zip lines inside the church and then come flying down with a cape to the platform we're not here to turn all the lights off and put all multicolored lights and as a visitor came to the church here years ago and said I I'm so glad to come in your church and you guys have your lights on you're not mushrooms you see but the age living in my brother and sister that's what Satan's doing because it reminds the people of the good experience they had at the last Rock concert they went to right the last time they dwelt in the dark with Spirits left them feeling warm and fuzzy and they don't mind that being replicated in church that's it h wow so close but it won't deceive the very elect amen now faith comes by hearing the word of God right that we we're all we're all solid on that so faith is an attribute so the word is actually if I could just do this brother Trevor if you don't mind here's the word of God I believe we're safe to say this is Faith when God anoints it right not every man can read a Bible won't do a thing for him but when God anoints that this is Faith now this Faith would come down and it will come and rest itself in the heart of the believer because he says I believe every word of that yeah but someone else it would come down and they would say that's just a Bible and N would some would say uh I see the scripture I followed it you could say that tonight with Paul I follow what he's saying but I don't agree that it's a significant as he says it is and another says if it came out of the word of God I be leave every single word see so it's matter as I'm kind of portraying tonight it's a matter of how we look at it and you know you you might find this a little bit different for me to say this I think sometimes maybe we ought to forget about the doctrine of some of these things we need to forget about oh what is the seventh seal what is this what is that we need to prove the church ages and we need to actually get into the word and let the word become us I don't need to defend the word to you my brother and sister how God deals with me and speaks with me I don't need to defend that to you even though I'm even your pastor I don't need to defend that that's how God speaks to me and I'm not going to come here and I'm not going to criticize how God deals with you because God knows the beginning from the end vice versa he knows all of this what he needs to do to get our attention amen and some times some of us pardon I'm speaking to myself so no one be offended he has to deal a little harder with the Knuckleheads they've developed calluses on their forehead from beating their head off everything they come in contact with through life and God still knows exactly how to deal with them and then you got some people that from just a little child are so soft that God just moves and they're they're not they're not little puppets they're not little mus you whatever they're real Believers but their spirit that was just born so soft that they might be six seven8 years old want to be baptized cuz God's dealing with them they this is the truth this is who I am I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God faith is an attribute and you know Faith does not have fear when the script scure is speaking of fear it's talking about reverence amen the fear of the Lord reverence it's not us terrified of God but Satan would like you to God's mad at me this is happening in my life God is mad at me well stop why would you offer up something that would make God mad why not offer up something that makes him happy yeah so usually when you hear that oh God's mad at me maybe I'll stop instead of pushing back look and say what could I have done I still don't believe God's mad at me he's wooing me maybe he's just hitting that callous now the way to have Fellowship here this is U 1955 brother Brown says there I got to hurry I hope you guys don't mind if I kind of start preaching fears of the devil now look at this I'm going to apply this to me so none of you can claim offense fear Makes You Weary does I don't think I've ever been as tired in my life as I am right now I feel thrashed out I feel like I can't hardly I I couldn't climb a mountain now if hardly if my life depended on it now we got to stop is that just a physical attribute or is there a spirit that is trying to make us weary the scripture saying not be weary in well-doing goes a little deeper I think than most of us give it any credit it goes right down to this level that if we are weary and wello we need to get rid of the spirit that is causing us to fear and be weary are you guys good with that I don't want to leave any confusion but you know as well as I do that when you wake up in the middle of the night and you lay there for hours that's not of God right cuz if it was God he would turn you to purpose when God wakes a son or daughter of God up in the middle of the night he doesn't leave them in turmoil he has purpose it might be for us to get things out of our life roll over put our face in the floor the pillow or whatever and cry out to him but it has purpose but Satan just comes and robs our peace and then we wake up we're troubled we're worried and we're weary yeah right fear makes you wonder y and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do to get all stewed up about it you know that's actually quite a profound statement because when I read this quote which I've read it many times when I read this quote I thought oh Lord help me I got so far to go cuz I would be worried worried so cuz would it be painful will it be slow what will it be oh isn't that so unreasonable be worried about something that would be out of your control oh wait the footsteps that's right of the righteous we were going to die in the morning it would have to be in God's plan am H what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would it do me to worry about it well you say what good would it do to have faith well faith can sign my pardon amen amen sure there's value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love amen first look at how this is brought in oh I need I need faith for healing what what's keeping that what's keeping me from that I should say might be this little thought that we got against someone amen might be a little underlying thing that that we're a little bit bitter and we can't figure out why we're not healed and it could just be this little thing over here when we come to the place we'd say Lord I I'm sorry and we deal with that and straighten it up there's no roadblocks at all that's it you know it's so interesting now we don't want to be like a little video I saw happened over in Germany they had fast traffic some kind of construction thing so they set barriers here and then little distance and they set barriers here so the traffic could still go but it had to go like this well it turns out this man is in a big truck and he has fallen asleep and he comes down there gets to the first barrier you know he wasn't afraid of that barrier he was oblivious to the barrier and the people on the other sides of the barrier were all confident we're behind the barrier but when that truck plowed through every one of those barriers and went all the way through and kept going all the natural confidence that there was in the work of the barrier was for not and unfortunately for the man that was in the cab of the truck his attention he was actually asleep was all for not I think he got sentenced to prison or something for that you see we don't want to have a false confidence I'm in God I'm in Christ God gave job a hedge he's obligated to give me a hedge but I'm here to tell you just bear with me it was on Sunday that God told Satan that he would open the Hedge and we're over here praise God I'm the bride of Christ I've got a hedge around me God might have said I see a little speck of something there I think I'll let the devil come in and we'll just burn that Speck right out of you you see we we don't want to become arrogant or proud serving God should we be confident as I started the service to say I'm a Son of God and God's in control and Satan I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ that's not you that's him that's not confidence in us it's confidence in him and that's what he gave us to fight the Battle of leoda is a confidence in him amen cuz this flesh will fail us okay what good would it do only way you can have faith you got to have love first for love produces faith for perfect love get it perfect love casts out all fear and what is the spirit of this day my brother and sister the prophet of God talks about we're coming into an age of neurotics what is the basis of neurotics fear anxiety fear amen amen God has cast out fear that's right and we're here to stand and say you know what if God's calling me yeah God called me to be a Son of God called me to be a daughter of God I need to banish every fear of what it will be like to serve him 100% we need to stand and say if he called me he's provided for me made the way for me everything I'll need is already been supplied to me and then when you walk out in leod deia everything can go wrong around you spirits and the Warfare and you can walk and say it's already provided it's already provided he's already provided all the peace I need all the forgiveness I need all I need every anointing I need everything's already been provided and that's how we're going to fight the spirit of leoda it won't be with us going around getting a bigger it won't be us going out and going back and telling uh uh telling them you know I'll take that Armor after all Saul can I can I actually get that armor I I think I think you're right I need that armor you imagine that sord draging behind David The Shield takes two arms to hold up how could he even fight a battle when it took two hands no my brother and sister David went out there not arrogant not boastful and certainly not naive and the Bride of this age believes the word of this age and she is not arrogant she's not proud and she's not naive she knows what God promised she's counting on it she's standing on the word amen okay let's go Revelations 19 um you know the scripture amen you see we can look at this for this righteousness of the Saints see God's provided and described it give us a very clear description of what righteousness is it's not self-made not self-promoted and will never actually be supported by self we have righteousness today and we step away from God we'll find that we won't have righteousness tomorrow that's how many a believer that has been a Believer for a long time got anoint Ed with those spirits and said well we've always been Believers we can go out here just a little further and when they got out there they woke up one day or maybe never woke up yeah and their righteousness is gone there's only righteousness in the fine linen of God's garment and God's garment is the word amen that's what he's covering us with let's go to the way to have Fellowship sister via amen maybe I'm looking at the wrong one okay sorry I got ahead of myself preaching do you guys ever do that no no not preaching just get ahead of yourself you know sometimes we we get into something and you know anyway 1 John 4:18 says there's no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love amen Who Wants to Be Perfect tonight amen by the word of God hallelujah amen day by day A Closer Walk sister Ruth please come Hallelujah you know as I was studying this and putting this all together I thought oh my uh how do how do I bring this out but my brother and sister I hope that it came I hope you understand where we're coming from but you see our weapon of our Warfare in this age has nothing to do with the church I'm going to just say bold it has nothing to do with the message as per se if it did every man woman family that had the message in their bookcase would have the answer the answer to the Battle of Le oysa we can sum it all up but it's sumed simply in a relationship with Jesus Christ because without that relationship you can't even have faith and the scripture says faith is our Avenue to overcome just like the scripture says you can't even say that Jesus is the Christ without the Holy Ghost a lot of people say that he's the Christ but the evidence is not there and I don't say that judgmentally it just shows you that we got to interpret this by the word not by our thoughts we are going to win this battle Amen in fact to put it correctly from the word we've already won amen thank you for your patience amen may we day by day just have a closer walk amen let's just stand as we put up uh uh 700 Give Me Jesus [Music] Amen in the morning when I rise in the morning when I

give me [Music] Jesus you know we've been preaching tonight we talked on this talked on the spirit of fear I'd just like to sing this verse again just a little reminder when Satan gets inside there and he starts to deal with you in that realm that we know now don't don't feel condemned by this but we know that's not the atmosphere the Lord has called us to let's just could we just be bold enough to say you know what I'm just going to rebuke this fear that's right well what will happen if [Music] no it's not what's if Lord what will happen will be your perfect will that's right it will be your
