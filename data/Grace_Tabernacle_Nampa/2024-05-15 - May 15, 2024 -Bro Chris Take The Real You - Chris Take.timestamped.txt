[23:32] to judges chap
[23:35] 6 man it's good to be in the house of
[23:37] God and always a um always a
[23:42] privilege whether our flesh feels like
[23:45] it or not that's right Spirit within us
[23:47] says yes so we're here amen you can
[23:51] start uh from the first slide there
[23:53] Gideon I want to minister tonight on the
[23:55] real you amen
[23:58] and in Judges chapter 6: 11 we'll read
[24:02] here tonight very familiar passage of
[24:04] scripture we're talking about
[24:07] Gideon but I wanted to key in on
[24:10] something right here to launch from this
[24:13] tonight um verse 11 and there came an
[24:15] angel of the Lord and sat under an oak
[24:18] which was in ofra a fun little study you
[24:21] can do in your devotions is look and see
[24:23] the different trees that God met his
[24:26] people under
[24:28] which o which was in Oprah and that
[24:31] pertained unto
[24:33] joash the azerite and his son gidan
[24:36] threshed Wheat by the wine pressed to
[24:38] hide it from the midianites and the
[24:40] angel of the Lord appeared unto him and
[24:41] said unto him the Lord is with thee thou
[24:43] Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto
[24:46] him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us
[24:49] why then is all this befallen us and
[24:51] where be all his miracles which our
[24:53] fathers told us of saying do not did not
[24:57] the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now
[25:00] the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered
[25:02] us into the hands of the midianites
[25:05] Gideon asked the Lord a question he says
[25:09] basically where is the god where is
[25:13] Jehovah and this is the Lord's
[25:18] response he says go in this thy might
[25:21] and thou shalt save Israel from the hand
[25:23] of the midianites have not I sent thee
[25:26] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[25:27] word you can be seated
[25:29] tonight
[25:33] so the title like I said is the real you
[25:38] because there's
[25:40] there's you know we talked about twins
[25:42] for a while so there's there's two of
[25:44] you Titus amen so next time someone
[25:48] makes a joke about it say well it's true
[25:50] there's two of me amen I used to get
[25:53] teased like that growing up oh there's
[25:54] two two chrises well there
[25:56] is there were for a while I only knew
[25:59] one then I met Christ and I met the
[26:02] other one amen because I have a
[26:04] theophany you have a theophany you have
[26:06] the spirit of Christ inside of you you
[26:08] have your flesh man fighting your spirit
[26:12] man and the spirit man is the one that
[26:14] God called before the foundation of the
[26:16] world not this flesh this will R in the
[26:20] ground he called you and the real you is
[26:24] not the one who you know gets upset in
[26:27] traffic and and and makes mistakes and
[26:30] shortcomings that's not the real you if
[26:33] if you focus on that person you're going
[26:36] to get
[26:38] confused even more so if you focus on
[26:41] that person and your brother amen you're
[26:43] going to be offended that's right you're
[26:45] going to miss the the thing and and
[26:47] there'll never be Unity as as we think
[26:49] because we're looking for Unity of the
[26:51] flesh that's never going to happen
[26:53] that's right guess what when God comes
[26:55] and the Rapture happens there will not
[26:57] be Unity of the flesh at that point
[26:59] there'll be Unity of the spirit of
[27:00] Christ within us because we all come
[27:02] into Unity with Christ am this quote
[27:06] here Gideon never mind I got it right
[27:10] here says in the Mighty God unveiled
[27:13] before
[27:14] us whenever there's a title like that in
[27:16] the in the sermons because brother B's
[27:18] preached it a different couple different
[27:19] times I mean just go back every once in
[27:21] a while and listen to it because it's
[27:23] just mindblowing but he says that the
[27:25] old Badger skins what did it do it hid
[27:28] the glory of God from the people right
[27:31] the badger skins the reason the people
[27:34] couldn't see it because it was a skin
[27:36] that held it the glory of God was behind
[27:38] the skin and now the glory of God is
[27:41] behind your skin that's right and the
[27:45] Traditions don't see it it's inside the
[27:47] veil where his word was so brother is
[27:52] talking about the shakina glory of God
[27:55] is behind your skin amen
[27:59] wrap your little human brain around that
[28:01] one the shakina glory of God that
[28:04] presence that only the priests could
[28:06] come into contact with and and I was
[28:09] just reading in in uh numbers I'm
[28:10] reading through numbers right now and
[28:12] and there's all those Dayan and cor rose
[28:14] up said well we can we can basically
[28:16] take the office of the Levites or we
[28:18] don't need Moses and um they go to burn
[28:21] the incense and then God opens the Earth
[28:22] and swallows them all up right because
[28:25] they were trying to take that position
[28:27] but that presence that
[28:29] demanded the Levites and the priests and
[28:32] that presence that cast that judgment on
[28:35] those the whole families is a presence
[28:38] that lives it behind your
[28:41] skin first of all well that's the real
[28:44] you that's right that's the real you
[28:47] that's who you really are that's right
[28:49] and
[28:51] and once you've come to the place where
[28:54] where you you you've you've crossed and
[28:56] you your justification sanctification
[28:59] baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm talking
[29:01] to you amen because if if we if we fail
[29:05] that's is why brother B says the cross
[29:07] is important because if we fail to keep
[29:09] that preached people will go around a
[29:13] mess thinking they have the shanic glory
[29:15] behind their skins but there's a process
[29:16] to get there amen but those of you have
[29:19] gone that way gone that path and the
[29:22] devil says look at who look at the mess
[29:24] you are and I'm not talking about Sin
[29:27] and and habits that are just terrible
[29:29] I'm I'm talking about the little the
[29:31] silly ridiculous things that we do
[29:33] because we just have too much pride and
[29:35] and we can't keep our mouth shut and and
[29:38] you get the end of the day and you look
[29:40] back at what you did and you say oh my
[29:42] goodness the devil says comes along and
[29:45] he whispers he says see you're just a
[29:47] badger but you see in order for the
[29:50] Badger's skin to be there the badger had
[29:52] to give his life away that's right in
[29:54] order for our skin to be the sh to be
[29:56] the skin that covers sh of Glory we had
[29:58] to give ourselves away we had to lay
[30:01] ourselves out to be skinned skinned
[30:04] alive amen I mean it's it's a it's a
[30:08] process that that takes you giving up
[30:12] your identity your skin think about your
[30:14] skin right it it what forms you over
[30:17] your features and your bones and it
[30:20] gives you the look that you have it's
[30:22] that it's that thing that holds it all
[30:23] together but God said I need it that's
[30:27] right so give it away give your life
[30:29] away so the answer to Gideon's question
[30:32] the reason we read the scripture is
[30:33] because the answer to Gideon's question
[30:35] Where's God is the Lord's response is
[30:39] have not I sent thee in other words
[30:42] you're looking for God and he's right
[30:45] there exactly right he's behind your
[30:47] skin this is God talking to Gideon
[30:49] saying I've sent you you want to know
[30:51] where God is I sent you amen
[30:55] tonight you know what you just can't
[30:57] explain the word of God so tonight I I
[30:59] need you to just
[31:00] it well you should do this every time
[31:03] say Lord help me to catch what you're
[31:05] saying tonight because there's only so
[31:07] much you can say and God has to reveal
[31:09] it to your heart but the answer to where
[31:13] go where is God today where where is God
[31:15] today what's the answer have not I sent
[31:19] thee that's right where is God where
[31:21] where's the Prophet The Prophet died
[31:23] what's going to happen where then God
[31:25] said no I'm in you I'm in the bride amen
[31:28] the bride coming of Christ amen so you
[31:31] are Christ where where is God people say
[31:34] well God's not real or where is God and
[31:36] they're looking upstair up upstairs up
[31:38] to the universe above them and they're
[31:40] looking around them saying well where is
[31:41] God and all the while we're rubbing
[31:43] shoulders with them and it's shakina of
[31:45] Glory behind your skin amen you that's
[31:49] the real you that's right you think
[31:52] about the shakina glory of God hidden
[31:55] behind the skin of the Bride
[31:58] go back in in your in in the Old
[32:00] Testament and read about the power of
[32:02] that shika
[32:05] Glory why do we fall
[32:07] short because we give into the flesh
[32:10] that's right that's the only reason but
[32:12] that's not the real you that's right and
[32:15] if you can remember well that's not
[32:16] really who I am something in your
[32:19] thinking because God understands he
[32:21] created us he created our brain and our
[32:23] emotions and what we how we think and
[32:26] process things and so he gives us the
[32:28] scriptures into our own language not
[32:31] English human right he condens sended
[32:36] God who created the heavens and the
[32:37] Earth and and and and you talk about the
[32:39] smartest person in the world can't even
[32:41] hold a twinkle much less a candle to
[32:45] God's intellect but he brought it down
[32:48] so you could have digest it as a human
[32:51] and so when he says this is the real you
[32:53] it's something that triggers in your
[32:55] brain if you can believe it what is that
[32:57] fath Faith which is revelation amen
[33:00] because you're recognizing what did
[33:01] brother said if the bride could realize
[33:03] who she is she will be an invincible
[33:05] Army Amen in order for us to come to the
[33:08] position where we're ready for rapture
[33:10] we have to be an invincible Army so what
[33:13] are we doing we're chipping away at the
[33:16] things that beset us run the race and
[33:19] and and there's a cloud of many
[33:22] witnesses lay aside those things that so
[33:24] easily beset us what is Paul talking
[33:27] about he's talking about the pride of
[33:29] life and and vanity and bitterness and
[33:31] jealousy and these things that we hold
[33:34] on to and that's what he's talking about
[33:36] and Lord help me I have so far to
[33:39] go so inside this place you have the
[33:43] show bread and this is just a couple of
[33:44] scriptures just to set us into context
[33:47] here that we set the showbread up there
[33:49] before me y this is God speaking and
[33:52] then there was the Brethren sons of the
[33:54] coites were over the showbread to
[33:56] prepare it every Sabbath
[33:58] Sabbath so this this bread was was was
[34:00] always
[34:02] fresh
[34:04] Generations went by Century centuries
[34:07] went by yet this bread was always fresh
[34:10] there because it was constantly baked
[34:13] again you know David David and his men
[34:15] ate the
[34:16] showbread right the priest said well I
[34:18] have this bread here
[34:20] and so the word it's the word brother
[34:23] and says the show is Christ amen and and
[34:26] the word you talk about freshly baked
[34:29] bread the word is fresh every day amen
[34:34] but says the hidden Mana is to show
[34:36] bread it's Christ it's the bread that
[34:39] that's there and it's it's it's always
[34:42] the thing that I found fascinating about
[34:43] this is It's always current amen it's
[34:46] never outdated so you talk about fresh
[34:49] right these are all of the a the uh
[34:53] acronyms of the word fresh not stale
[34:55] crisp un I don't know why that's
[34:57] supposed to be untainted I think unfaded
[35:00] natural unprocessed unpreserved without
[35:03] preservatives guess those are the same
[35:05] thing clean clear pristine Untouched by
[35:08] the world original unconventional
[35:11] radical revolutionary restored these are
[35:14] all in the thesaurus for the word fresh
[35:18] this is Christ this is the word of God
[35:20] it's invigorated it's vibrant it's
[35:22] revived it's refreshing it's pure it's
[35:25] unpolluted uncontaminated tainted it's
[35:28] brisk this is the word of God
[35:31] Amen not your
[35:33] Bible that's right I was in the office
[35:36] praying it's like oh God we we sit with
[35:38] our coffee in the morning and our in our
[35:40] Bible and then we just miss you because
[35:43] we're reading a page that's right but
[35:45] God this is your Living Word this is God
[35:47] this is this is fresh this is crisp it's
[35:50] not processed there's no additives
[35:52] there's no preservatives it doesn't need
[35:54] preservatives it is life in
[35:56] itself amen it needs nothing to contain
[35:59] itself it is that's right it is the
[36:03] container amen it is there's nothing
[36:06] that can touch it and nobody can can
[36:09] excuse it no Generations can can forget
[36:12] about it they're going to argue about it
[36:14] and discuss it they can't forget it amen
[36:17] because it is the indelible foundation
[36:20] of the world because God spoke the world
[36:23] into existence the very Earth you walk
[36:26] on is the word of God
[36:28] the very body you walk in that that
[36:30] houses the kind of Glory of God is the
[36:33] spoken word of God because he created
[36:36] you
[36:37] amen when you walk outside and you see
[36:39] the trees you looking at the
[36:41] manifestation of the spoken word of God
[36:44] when you look at yourself in the mirror
[36:46] the mirror of the word of God not the
[36:48] glass mirror on your wall the mirror of
[36:50] the word of God you should see the real
[36:53] you not the mistakes that you have but
[36:56] the real you and as soon as you come
[36:58] into contact with that and you realize
[37:00] that the shakina glory of God is housed
[37:03] in this Badger skin you don't become
[37:06] arrogant you'll fall to your knees and
[37:08] say God are you serious you chose me to
[37:12] hold your sacred glory to be you to the
[37:15] world around you and he says absolutely
[37:18] I wouldn't have it any other way that's
[37:20] right before the foundation of the world
[37:23] he said this is the best way to display
[37:26] my word why because he wanted you amen
[37:29] he wanted you by his side for eternity
[37:32] and the only way to do that is to get to
[37:35] the place where you could be the shikina
[37:37] glory of God housed in human flesh
[37:40] that's right the real
[37:43] you identified Christ of all the ages he
[37:46] says in the Old Testament there was
[37:48] Badger skins that hid God he was in the
[37:50] shikina glory they was behind the badger
[37:53] skins before they become behind the
[37:55] badger skin the word was in most Now
[37:58] watch how the word comes because brother
[38:00] B says the word comes to the prophet
[38:02] first that's right and he says that's
[38:06] where you know if there's if there's
[38:09] word to be revealed that's
[38:13] it to a generation to an age it must
[38:16] come to the prophet amen once it's come
[38:19] to the prophet now you have access to it
[38:22] that's it and that's simply because
[38:24] that's the way God said it should be
[38:26] that's right don't try to figure out why
[38:29] that's right that's just the way God
[38:30] said it to be and there's there's a lot
[38:31] of different angles you can come to it
[38:33] so you can glean more more about the
[38:36] topic but don't pull your brains out
[38:38] trying to figure out why that's just
[38:39] what God Said So the word was in Moses
[38:42] so now God has this desire and I I I
[38:46] catch the parallel here God has this
[38:48] desire to bring the word to the children
[38:50] of Israel they're a mess they're in
[38:53] bondage you know 400 something years or
[38:55] whatever it was and around that time
[38:57] frame and and he'd spoken to Abraham and
[39:00] and and they they reference they referen
[39:02] the god of Abraham so they they need
[39:05] access to God firsthand there's a word
[39:08] that has to be brought to them and and
[39:10] in order to bring them out right so God
[39:13] God brings them out of Egypt but to in
[39:15] order to sustain you so God brings you
[39:17] out of the world but to sustain you you
[39:19] must be filled you must be filled with
[39:21] the glory of God so the word was in
[39:23] Moses the prophet he went up on the
[39:25] mountain
[39:27] he met the pillar of fire and it was
[39:29] spoke to him you catching the
[39:31] parallel he went down and performed the
[39:34] signs of the Prophet brought children of
[39:36] Israel out of Egypt to this mountain and
[39:38] then God came down and identified Moses
[39:41] by bringing him into that Pillar of Fire
[39:45] excuse me and veiling him no one else
[39:48] could go not any person to try to
[39:50] impersonate that they could not do it
[39:52] they died
[39:54] amen taking one man he went in behind
[39:57] there to the pillar of fire into the
[39:59] glory of God and into the shikan of
[40:01] glory and it was that position that
[40:03] Moses took that God was able to bring
[40:06] the word to the children of Israel okay
[40:09] and when he came out with that word for
[40:11] that age he was so shining with the
[40:13] glory of God till he had to Veil his
[40:15] face the people couldn't steadfast look
[40:17] upon him and that was the natural Veil
[40:21] natural always types the spiritual so
[40:24] it's the same thing today there's this
[40:26] when you are
[40:28] changed and God puts his spirit inside
[40:31] of
[40:32] you there's a veil that's right because
[40:35] the world can't look upon it that is why
[40:38] brother R says it's a secret amen why is
[40:41] it a secret because of it because of
[40:44] what he is that's right that's why it's
[40:46] a secret because of what he is he
[40:49] himself displayed through you has to be
[40:52] veiled amen the world's too dirty to
[40:55] contain it but you you with the flesh
[40:58] veiling the spirit of Christ inside of
[41:01] you then now you can walk Amen in the
[41:04] world that's
[41:06] right because God always hides himself
[41:09] in Simplicity that's
[41:11] right what is it when a man breaks
[41:13] through that Veil into the shikan glory
[41:15] now the world calls him a fanatic they
[41:18] can't see what's wrong but behind there
[41:21] there's no beauty of him he might not
[41:25] pronounce his words right he might not
[41:27] not dress just right he might not dress
[41:29] in clergy clothes she might not dress
[41:31] the way she think she ought to he's not
[41:33] talking about modesty he's just talking
[41:35] about you know well they didn't you know
[41:38] have I don't know brands of skirts
[41:40] whatever it may it may be but you see
[41:43] inside behind that Badger skin behind
[41:45] that human skin and there is the shikina
[41:47] glory and there is the power and there
[41:50] is the word in there is the showbread
[41:52] and the shik glory which is the light
[41:55] that makes light that ripens grain amen
[41:59] you Kansas people know that by your weat
[42:01] crops without that sun it won't
[42:04] light and until you come in behind that
[42:07] Badger skin until you get out of your
[42:09] old skin your old thoughts your old
[42:12] Creeds and come into the presence of God
[42:15] then the word becomes a living reality
[42:17] to you so you say Lord Make It Lord make
[42:20] your word more real to me and he's
[42:23] looking at you saying have not I sent
[42:25] thee that's it oh God I want to know you
[42:28] more personally and he's looking at
[42:30] himself in you saying if you would just
[42:33] realize who the real you is you would be
[42:37] closer than you've ever been before CU
[42:40] you're living in the presence he says
[42:41] eating the showbread that's only
[42:44] provided let me back up then you're
[42:47] awakened to the shikina glory the spirit
[42:50] man was asleep but then something came
[42:52] and woke you up the real you then the
[42:57] ible becomes a new book then Jesus
[42:59] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[43:00] forever you're living in his presence
[43:02] eating the showbread that's only
[43:04] provided that day for believers priests
[43:08] only and we are priests royal priesthood
[43:11] holy nation peculiar people giving
[43:14] spiritual sacrifices to God he says but
[43:16] you must come into behind the veil to
[43:19] see the unveiled God and God is unveiled
[43:23] that's his word made manifest so okay
[43:26] there's
[43:28] there's a lot in that quote because he
[43:30] says he says the shakina glory is a the
[43:33] word becomes a living reality to you
[43:36] when you put aside your flesh your skin
[43:39] and you step into the word of God in
[43:42] other words you are giving up your own
[43:43] self for him to take the place of you
[43:47] amen and when you're in that position
[43:50] now he says you're eating the showbread
[43:52] that's only provided for the Believers
[43:57] he says but you must come into behind
[43:59] the veil to see the unveiled God so if
[44:03] you want to see the glory of God
[44:06] unveiled in your life you have to come
[44:09] into contact with the real you amen amen
[44:13] that's right in other words where is
[44:15] Christ Christ The Mystery of God
[44:17] revealed is sitting right here because
[44:19] it's oh my goodness see you just feel
[44:21] like you can't say it enough see it's
[44:23] it's you it's inside of you it's right
[44:26] there it's not something you need to go
[44:28] find you just need to look into the
[44:30] mirror of the word of God and say oh I
[44:32] see you Lord and he says yes
[44:36] amen I'm right here and he's unveiled
[44:39] where is he unveiled he's not unveiled
[44:41] in a in in the building of the church
[44:43] he's not unveiled in in in the actual
[44:46] message book He's not unveiled in the
[44:48] actual Bible he's unveiled because you
[44:50] see him in you amen you see the real you
[44:54] which isn't built and shaped in the
[44:57] image of God
[44:59] Amen we pray to the God within us we
[45:03] don't reach to pray for God beyond the
[45:05] stars because if you do that you're
[45:07] praying to the wrong thing right you're
[45:09] not pray you're praying to lowercase G
[45:11] God but when you say Lord and you and
[45:14] you're praying to the god that's within
[45:16] you the spirit of Christ that has risen
[45:18] up inside of you and changed you and
[45:20] made you a Dwelling Place of the shikina
[45:22] glory of God you need not go anywhere to
[45:25] access God right there with you the only
[45:30] reason you don't feel god with you is
[45:32] because you walked out of the
[45:35] gate and you walked as flesh that's it
[45:39] and God says if you'll walk back into
[45:41] the gate that's right back
[45:45] into the
[45:48] sanctuary you'll find me again and it's
[45:51] not you and your feet walking
[45:54] down walking across time it it's
[45:57] you coming to a place where you but the
[46:00] only way to see that Christ inside of
[46:03] you is in the mirror of the word say I
[46:06] want to see you God and he's waiting for
[46:09] you right here amen behind the veil amen
[46:13] and when he unveils himself that's why
[46:15] when you that's why Revelation changes
[46:18] who you are that's right because you you
[46:21] stop acting like somebody you aren't
[46:23] that's it because you see Christ so then
[46:26] you see Christ it's like it's like
[46:27] somebody who
[46:29] who didn't realize I don't know this is
[46:33] just going to be farfetched didn't
[46:34] realize they had arms they heard about
[46:37] arms and man arms and hands would be
[46:40] amazing and all along they're walking
[46:42] along everyone's looking at them saying
[46:43] you've got arms and hands and they're
[46:45] saying no I don't I wish I hadn't but I
[46:47] don't and then they see thems in the
[46:49] mirror and they realize they have arms
[46:50] and hands guess what that's going to
[46:52] permanently change their personality
[46:54] that's right because now they have arms
[46:56] and hands now they're going to do the
[46:58] things they always wanted to do because
[47:00] they have arms and hands I know that's
[47:03] goofy but it it's what it is you realize
[47:05] who you are now you stopped acting like
[47:09] you stop acting like Saul and you act
[47:11] like Paul you stop acting like Cain and
[47:13] you act like Abel you stop acting like
[47:15] Esau and you act like Jacob Israel you
[47:19] because you realize you're you realize
[47:22] you you are an heir to the son of the
[47:27] free woman amen not an heir to the bonds
[47:30] woman that's right imagine somebody who
[47:32] you know who who didn't know they had
[47:35] been
[47:36] liberated they were a slave for years
[47:39] they lived their life as slaves their
[47:40] identity was a slave and then they were
[47:43] free but they hadn't heard yet they
[47:46] continued to live like a slave but they
[47:48] were
[47:49] free you're free but you're continuing
[47:51] to live like a
[47:53] slave and then the message comes what
[47:56] are you doing you're free y amen you're
[47:58] not a slave anymore you haven't been for
[48:00] two
[48:01] weeks immediately that person changes
[48:04] their Dwelling Place immediately that
[48:07] person changes their identity they no
[48:10] longer belong to this master of the
[48:11] world they belong to the G to Christ I
[48:14] am a son of the king that's it that's
[48:18] right something changes amen something
[48:21] changes in you and what is that that is
[48:24] a revelation of the real you you which
[48:26] isn't some kind of Buddhist theology
[48:29] it's the revelation of Christ because
[48:31] Christ is veiled in your skin amen the
[48:34] shakana glory of God the same Glory that
[48:38] made Aaron's Rod butt into a tree lives
[48:42] inside of you so you can create worlds
[48:46] and live on them you say well yeah but
[48:48] faith and we're held back no the world
[48:51] around you you want a family to be a
[48:54] certain way you want a family create
[48:56] that world speak that world into
[48:58] existence you have the very ability to
[49:01] create that you want your family to be
[49:04] different speak amen speak the word of
[49:07] God how do you speak the word of God oh
[49:09] Lord I just thank you for who you are I
[49:11] thank you for your mercies I Praise You
[49:14] Lord I lift up my brother you're
[49:16] speaking the words of God and you're
[49:18] coming into contact with what a God out
[49:21] there know the god inside of you you've
[49:23] stepped down into a place that's why
[49:25] when you pray you have to pray yourself
[49:28] through the gate into the holy Place
[49:33] into the holiest of
[49:36] holies that's called breaking
[49:38] through and you have to drag yourself
[49:41] along I remember I gave the example you
[49:43] got to drag those emotions along with
[49:45] you they're going to be you know playing
[49:48] golf and doing other things but you drag
[49:51] them along or out fishing or hunting or
[49:53] fixing your bow or fixing your dirt bike
[49:56] those itions but you have to drag them
[49:58] through and as you come through and you
[50:00] pull through the sanctuary and the holy
[50:03] place and the holiest of holies your
[50:04] entire being becomes in tune and
[50:07] suddenly you you're praying and words
[50:09] are coming forth and you're in you're in
[50:11] what you're in the presence of
[50:14] God because you have stepped inward amen
[50:19] right that it's very popular in the
[50:21] world secularly SEC secular whatever
[50:27] you understand it's very popular people
[50:29] to go off and and and go into these uh
[50:32] they call it a
[50:35] um I can't remember what it is but
[50:37] basically you go into this dark room you
[50:38] can't hear anything see anything and you
[50:41] find
[50:42] yourself and you tap into who you are
[50:46] and people come out say wow you know
[50:48] it's amazing it's amazing I didn't know
[50:49] why I was so
[50:52] awesome well that's the natural and
[50:56] brother says says that I just read the
[50:57] quote today natural always types the
[50:59] spiritual because the devil can't create
[51:01] he perverts so if it's something out
[51:03] there and you say well there's got to be
[51:04] the right thing here in the word of God
[51:07] so you need to you need to find the real
[51:09] you go find yourself do it yes sir go
[51:14] find yourself you you meet you know
[51:17] friends at work say yeah I'm I'm finding
[51:19] myself they'll give you all kinds of
[51:20] advice and you don't want to take it but
[51:23] you're doing the same thing you say oh
[51:24] yes I'm on a journey to find myself too
[51:27] and that's what happened to Enoch he was
[51:29] on a journey to find
[51:31] himself and then he saw
[51:33] himself and he disappeared amen you're
[51:37] going to come face to face with yourself
[51:40] brother said that seventh angel looked
[51:42] familiar yes
[51:45] sir if he can come face to face with
[51:47] himself we can
[51:50] too and it was that face to face what
[51:53] that revealed Christ in our age you see
[51:57] he as the prophet had to come to that
[51:59] position because the word has to come to
[52:02] the prophet first so he had to come to
[52:04] that position so that we could have the
[52:05] word to bring us to the same place to
[52:09] see ourselves face to face the real you
[52:14] amen and God is unveiled that's his word
[52:17] made manifest that's what's going to
[52:19] make you shout act emotional the word of
[52:23] God coming alive to you you don't need
[52:25] no assistance
[52:28] the word just manifest itself inside of
[52:30] you sorry I don't know what's going on
[52:32] manifest itself inside of you and
[52:34] suddenly you cannot contain yourself
[52:37] anymore cuz yourself yourself is not
[52:40] yourself it's himself amen he says I I
[52:43] said see I sound like a fanatic praise
[52:46] God no he was Jehovah people tried to
[52:48] push him around saying he's just a good
[52:50] man ordinary man he was the Divine one
[52:53] God manifested In the Flesh seen
[52:58] now I want this quote here is to show
[53:01] you where how brother B talks about how
[53:03] God Jesus was all God yet he was all man
[53:06] that's right because you are in the same
[53:08] exact position yes sir you are all man
[53:12] but you are all God that's exactly right
[53:14] because the real you is the god inside
[53:16] of you okay so Jesus walked in flesh to
[53:19] know what it's like to be all God in
[53:21] stuck in flesh amen so that he could
[53:24] have mercy and understand your
[53:28] position that's right he says he says he
[53:31] was the Divine one God manifested In the
[53:33] Flesh see even the world gets
[53:36] confused because they saw
[53:38] man the Pharisees and the Sadducees saw
[53:41] a
[53:43] man it he was veiled veiled in flesh and
[53:47] the same thing has to happen today as in
[53:50] the days of Noah so shall it be in the
[53:52] coming of the son of man as in the days
[53:54] of lot so shall it be in the coming of
[53:57] the son of man in other words it's Jesus
[53:58] Christ the same yesterday today and
[54:00] forever so you're going to experience
[54:03] exactly this he says manifested in the
[54:06] flesh seen of angels preached on
[54:09] received up into the heaven see you can
[54:10] get really confused sometimes because
[54:13] you see the Flesh and the mess that it
[54:15] is but then you see God and the the
[54:16] spirit of Christ inside of you and God's
[54:19] saying look don't worry about it it's
[54:21] the two it's the two just keep the one
[54:24] in check sitting at the right hand of
[54:26] the father certainly he was God he was
[54:29] more than a man he was a God man he was
[54:32] man in flesh but he was God in spirit
[54:35] that's what he was God coming down to
[54:38] suffer Temptation and martyrdom to take
[54:40] sins upon himself that he'd pass on the
[54:43] human race bearing our sins
[54:48] himself okay further down because he
[54:51] he's talking about a conversation he had
[54:53] with with with a lady and further down
[54:57] he answers and he sayses because she
[54:58] says 'w Jesus wept so he was a man and
[55:00] he sayses I said he might have cried
[55:03] that's true on his road down to meet
[55:04] Lazarus he was human as far as human is
[55:07] concerned in his flesh he was human but
[55:10] is but his spirit in his Spirit he was
[55:13] God that's right praise the Lord s
[55:16] that's the same you were in the same
[55:18] position that is you right there there
[55:20] you are that is the real you the spirit
[55:23] who you are is the spirit of Christ
[55:25] inside of you
[55:26] veiled the sh Glory the real you he said
[55:30] I I cried that was a man
[55:33] crying he was man when he was crying
[55:35] going down to lazarus's grave but when
[55:38] he stood there and straightened that
[55:40] little frame up and said Lazarus come
[55:43] forth and the man that been dead four
[55:46] days come to life again that was more
[55:48] than a man the doctor gave you the bad
[55:52] news and you wept but then something
[55:54] came over you that's right what was that
[55:57] that was the real you the real you
[56:00] straightened up the flesh amen that was
[56:03] getting weak that's why in your weakness
[56:05] you're perfected because in your
[56:08] weakness then God comes in his strength
[56:11] and it's Paul says when I am weak then I
[56:14] am
[56:15] strong I am strong why because it's
[56:18] Christ in you it's the real you
[56:22] amen that's
[56:24] right that was God speaking through
[56:26] there Hallelujah God was in his son that
[56:29] was God speaking through mortal flesh
[56:31] corruption knew its master I love that
[56:33] line corruption knew its Master that's
[56:36] right you speak to the situation the
[56:38] flesh you look look your flesh which is
[56:41] corruption it knows who's the boss amen
[56:44] it knows who's the boss you just have to
[56:47] know that's who the boss is that's it he
[56:50] was man when he was up there on that
[56:51] mountain that night come down and looked
[56:53] all around that little fig tree there
[56:56] and there wasn't nothing to eat he was
[56:57] hungry he was a man when he was hungry
[57:00] but when he took five biscuits and two
[57:01] fishes and fed 5,000 people that was
[57:04] more than a man that God in the man
[57:07] Hallelujah he's talking about Jesus but
[57:10] he's talking about you that's right he
[57:12] was a man when he laid on the back of
[57:14] that little boat that night when 10,000
[57:16] Devils of the sea swore they would drown
[57:18] him the little old Storm come up and a
[57:21] little boat pitching like a bottle
[57:23] stopper out there on that Lake like that
[57:25] devil said we'll drown him him tonight
[57:27] he was so tired virtue had gone out of
[57:29] him all day from preaching and healing
[57:31] till he was so tired the storm didn't
[57:33] wake him up but when the disciples woke
[57:38] him he's always activated by a call for
[57:41] help amen he's always activated when you
[57:44] ask him amen he's always there he's a
[57:46] gentleman and he's always there why is
[57:49] he always there because he's walking
[57:51] around inside of you he was a man laying
[57:53] there sleeping when he put his foot upon
[57:55] the rib of the boat said peace be still
[57:58] there that was more than a man that was
[58:00] God speaking through his son amen he was
[58:04] a man when he cried up there on Calvary
[58:06] my God why hast Thou forsaken me he died
[58:09] like a man you died like a
[58:11] man you gave up your life for his
[58:15] spiritually speaking you died you gave
[58:17] up who you are as as a as a man and
[58:20] pride and all of this stuff that you
[58:21] have and you gave it all up and you said
[58:24] Lord whatever you want me to do I am
[58:26] yours to do it whatever I no longer am
[58:29] the boss I am not in charge you did the
[58:32] same thing and then on your Resurrection
[58:37] morning he rose and brother B says you
[58:41] Rose with him amen amen we heard a
[58:44] beautiful sermon by our brother David
[58:46] around that you Rose with him he says I
[58:49] was there when Paul revered right I was
[58:52] there when Washington crossed Delaware
[58:54] and he says I was there what he's
[58:56] identifying I am I am an American so I
[58:59] was there he says now as a Christian as
[59:02] a Son of God I was there when he went to
[59:04] the cross and I was there when he rose
[59:06] again
[59:08] amen why were you there how could you be
[59:11] there how how could you be there there's
[59:13] only one way you could be there you were
[59:14] the seed of God inside of him amen
[59:17] that's right and you had a space of time
[59:19] to be expressed into that's exactly
[59:22] right and the same thing can be said for
[59:25] you God in
[59:27] amen he says he rose breaking the seals
[59:30] of death corruption rising to ascend to
[59:32] the father above showing that he was
[59:33] more than a man he was God in flesh
[59:35] that's it the Bible said Jesus Christ is
[59:37] the same yesterday today and forever now
[59:39] why would the prophets say that why
[59:42] would he say that he said so much that
[59:45] only by Revelation you can catch between
[59:47] the lines that's it he's connecting it
[59:49] back to you amen say that's God then
[59:52] then where is God right now
[59:53] today he's right here UN in unveiled In
[59:57] the Flesh of the bride and when you can
[1:00:00] believe that when you can recognize that
[1:00:02] that's the real you you will no longer
[1:00:04] go around saying I am the son of flint
[1:00:06] and hanit take that's it because it's
[1:00:09] the real you that's it right I I if you
[1:00:12] were if you were an orphan and you
[1:00:13] didn't know you were an orphan and and
[1:00:16] and you had been a you know lost lost on
[1:00:19] the on a you know Wagon Train out west
[1:00:21] let's say and you you just got lost and
[1:00:23] Indians picked you up and you grew up
[1:00:24] with the Indians and all you knew was
[1:00:26] Indians and you thought you were an
[1:00:27] Indian and then somebody came along one
[1:00:29] day and told you says look you're not an
[1:00:32] Indian you're the son of the owner of of
[1:00:35] of all of the metal work on the west
[1:00:37] coast you're a
[1:00:39] billionaire I mean we're I think we're
[1:00:41] out of times here but whatever guess
[1:00:45] what you're going to stop acting like an
[1:00:46] Indian because now you know who you
[1:00:48] really are see they're goofy but the
[1:00:50] foolishness of preaching goofy examples
[1:00:53] but it's the same thing you were going
[1:00:55] along that's why you were sinning cuz
[1:00:57] you didn't know who you really were
[1:00:59] that's right that's why people struggle
[1:01:02] even sitting in church cuz they don't
[1:01:04] know who they really are exactly right
[1:01:06] you're you're free but you're still
[1:01:08] working the feel of the devil that's
[1:01:11] right even though you're free say well
[1:01:14] excuse me I thought I was free I know I
[1:01:16] went and my goodness the spirit of the
[1:01:18] Lord came down yes you are you just need
[1:01:21] to now deny that it's got to be a shift
[1:01:25] into your in even in your mind cuz it
[1:01:27] goes from your mind down to your soul
[1:01:29] that's it it got to be a shift in the
[1:01:31] greatest battle ever fought the Army up
[1:01:34] there has to realize we're not
[1:01:37] defeated right you know it's like the
[1:01:39] soldiers that are hiding in the trench
[1:01:42] thinking they're being shot at but the
[1:01:44] enemy's already been already ran off
[1:01:47] then finally somebody takes the courage
[1:01:49] to peek their head over the bunker
[1:01:51] they're
[1:01:52] fine but when you cower down to the
[1:01:55] devil cuz you you think you're still
[1:01:56] bound but you're free the Devil Himself
[1:01:59] is like my goodness I didn't think this
[1:02:01] guy was
[1:02:03] bright no there's a time it's like the
[1:02:05] Johnny Crow right but then tells the
[1:02:07] story he you're free you're free go
[1:02:09] ahead fly away but he was so long
[1:02:11] chained he couldn't accept it why it has
[1:02:13] to be Revelation your deliverance has to
[1:02:16] be Revelation to you personally and
[1:02:18] that's what keeps the devil at Bay is
[1:02:22] the Revelation that you get that you are
[1:02:24] no longer a child of the Bond woman amen
[1:02:28] that you're a child of the
[1:02:33] free he was all
[1:02:35] God yet he was
[1:02:38] man in Luke 17: 29 and 30 it says but
[1:02:41] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[1:02:43] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:02:46] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:02:48] it be in the day when the son of man is
[1:02:50] revealed now in our day and age that we
[1:02:52] live in the son of man was
[1:02:54] revealed Christ was revealed to
[1:02:58] us and so we read this scripture and we
[1:03:01] say yes destruction and destroying and
[1:03:04] brimstone and everything coming down to
[1:03:05] the world around us but what was
[1:03:07] happening to the believer in this space
[1:03:09] of time amen always look to the positive
[1:03:13] amen always look to the positive there's
[1:03:17] a positive and there's a
[1:03:18] negative because God's going to hide
[1:03:21] himself in his word that's it during
[1:03:25] this space of the time Abraham was on
[1:03:28] the backs side of the
[1:03:32] desert and you can argue about the
[1:03:34] timelines but it was the same
[1:03:36] season lot's down there Abraham's out
[1:03:41] there and it was in that space of time
[1:03:45] where the Lord comes down robed in flesh
[1:03:49] and speaks to Abraham and through the
[1:03:52] spoken
[1:03:54] word the promises brought to pass amen
[1:03:57] he'd said it before but then God came in
[1:04:00] flesh that's right and stood there in
[1:04:02] front of Abraham and said Sarah shall
[1:04:05] conceive amen it was the spoken word
[1:04:09] planted the
[1:04:11] seed in the womb in Sarah's womb amen
[1:04:15] that was the promised son okay so the
[1:04:18] world we live in Christ has come down in
[1:04:22] flesh you and I but we're in this season
[1:04:25] and O in the days of lot this is where
[1:04:27] we are amen and guess what the spoken
[1:04:30] word is planting and bringing forth the
[1:04:35] promised son in your life exactly right
[1:04:37] that's the third pole that's it that's
[1:04:40] exactly it's that simple amen that's
[1:04:42] right they say the spoken word I got to
[1:04:44] like stand up and and and speak well
[1:04:47] yeah actually but you speak the word of
[1:04:49] God you you feed the word of God you you
[1:04:52] listen to the word of God you if if you
[1:04:55] let me put it this way and maybe this is
[1:04:57] a bit Blasphemous forgive me if it is
[1:04:59] but if you are if the shakina glory of
[1:05:02] God is behind your skin and you talk
[1:05:05] about the things of God you are God
[1:05:08] speaking you are this you are the spoken
[1:05:11] word you're life itself is the spoken
[1:05:14] word people say well I don't know why
[1:05:15] this happened well you kept saying
[1:05:18] it you kept saying it you speak it
[1:05:21] that's why you got to speak the positive
[1:05:24] create the atmosphere yeah why because
[1:05:26] you have the power because the real you
[1:05:29] because of because of the real you you
[1:05:31] have the power amen you have the power
[1:05:34] that's why when we speak the words Lord
[1:05:36] we bind every hindering Spirit In The
[1:05:38] Name of Jesus Christ do you know that
[1:05:40] that has to have an effect if a child of
[1:05:43] God says those word it has to have an
[1:05:46] effect the devil does not have a choice
[1:05:49] that's it you got issues in your home
[1:05:52] speak those words that's exactly you're
[1:05:54] going to meet with somebody and it's you
[1:05:56] know whatever it might be you just say
[1:05:58] God bind the spirit in the name of Jesus
[1:06:00] Christ those aren't just words we say
[1:06:02] that sound like we're spiritual and you
[1:06:04] know we're not
[1:06:06] like you know those people out there
[1:06:09] that are caught up in in all that stuff
[1:06:12] you know like Pentecostals and all that
[1:06:14] crazy stuff I you know I remember when
[1:06:18] Co was happening and what's that TV
[1:06:21] evangelist tried to bind the demon and
[1:06:22] all this weird stuff he has no author
[1:06:25] Authority the seven son of of CA said
[1:06:28] well this is pretty cool we're going to
[1:06:29] go try it out and they almost lost their
[1:06:31] lives because they had no Authority but
[1:06:34] if you know God and God knows you you
[1:06:37] have the authority because if God knows
[1:06:39] you and you know God the devil knows who
[1:06:41] you are you see before you even realize
[1:06:43] who the real you is the devil already
[1:06:45] knows that's why brother man say that
[1:06:47] the weakest Christian gets on his knees
[1:06:49] all hell trembles because they know you
[1:06:51] they know the real you amen and all the
[1:06:54] devil can do is is whisper lies to you
[1:06:56] to try to cons convince you otherwise
[1:07:00] that's exactly right and as long as he
[1:07:02] can convince you otherwise only for a
[1:07:04] season because a child of God will find
[1:07:06] Victory then he's got you I heard it
[1:07:09] said one time if the devil was going to
[1:07:11] kill you he wouldn't tell you about it
[1:07:12] he would just do it you see but he wants
[1:07:15] to whisper these things to you all Laden
[1:07:18] with fear and nothing nothing about
[1:07:20] faith there
[1:07:30] in Matthew 3:1
[1:07:32] 13-17 this is this is where Jesus comes
[1:07:35] and he is just gonna move this he is
[1:07:39] gonna be baptized by John says then
[1:07:42] cometh Jesus from galile to Jordan unto
[1:07:44] John to be baptized of him see the word
[1:07:46] came to the prophet that's it that's why
[1:07:49] John had to baptized Jesus because the
[1:07:51] sacrifice had to be cleansed and the
[1:07:52] word had to come to the prophet so so
[1:07:55] God Christ comes to John to be baptized
[1:07:57] of him but John forbade him saying I
[1:07:59] have need to be baptized of thee and
[1:08:01] comest thou to me and the focus went
[1:08:04] from John the Baptist to
[1:08:06] Jesus you see the focus went from the
[1:08:09] prophet to Christ in our in our in our
[1:08:12] age that we the day that we live in and
[1:08:15] that and that's where where people get
[1:08:18] confused right because they they forget
[1:08:20] to move on that's it that's it but says
[1:08:23] God turns Corners that's it and he says
[1:08:25] that's where people always fall off the
[1:08:28] wall that's right and Jesus but John
[1:08:31] forbade him saying I have need to be
[1:08:32] baptized of thee and comest thou to me
[1:08:35] and Jesus answering said unto him suffer
[1:08:37] it to be so now for thus it becometh us
[1:08:39] to fulfill all righteousness for the BR
[1:08:41] went through the same thing he says well
[1:08:43] you know maybe I'll just go into the
[1:08:44] woods and and live my life out
[1:08:47] there what was he saying he was saying I
[1:08:50] can't do this I can't baptize you but
[1:08:53] God came and showed him what's going to
[1:08:54] happen to him and and then showed him
[1:08:55] the hills what it was God encouraging
[1:08:57] the man to fulfill what God had called
[1:09:00] him to fulfill but he went through the
[1:09:02] same process but Jesus says look the
[1:09:04] word has to come to the prophet first
[1:09:05] you have to do this John Jesus answering
[1:09:08] said to him suffer it to be so now for
[1:09:10] thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:09:13] righteousness then he suffered him and
[1:09:15] Jesus when he was baptized went up
[1:09:17] straightway out of the water and lo the
[1:09:19] heavens were open unto him and he saw
[1:09:22] the spirit of God descending like a dove
[1:09:24] and lighting upon on him and L a voice
[1:09:26] from Heaven saying this is my beloved
[1:09:28] Son in whom I am pleased to
[1:09:30] dwell says the same
[1:09:33] thing so he says
[1:09:36] here he says this is in in reference to
[1:09:39] the scripture he was man in one sense he
[1:09:41] was God in another sense he was man in
[1:09:43] flesh in spirit he was God we just went
[1:09:47] through that so did we the Dove came on
[1:09:50] the lamb so the dove like the spirit of
[1:09:52] God descended like a dove onto Jesus who
[1:09:54] was the lamb L the sacrifice and they to
[1:09:57] became one the lamb was one creature the
[1:10:01] dove was another creature and when the
[1:10:03] Dove and the man the Dove and the lamb
[1:10:06] United together God was manifested in
[1:10:08] flesh amen that's right and now are you
[1:10:12] ready for this hold on to your seats now
[1:10:15] he's manifested in your flesh by being
[1:10:19] adopted Sons and Daughters to the
[1:10:20] kingdom of God through the baptism of
[1:10:22] the Holy Spirit when you were baptized
[1:10:24] then the Dove came down his Spirit came
[1:10:27] down and the two became one
[1:10:30] amen baptism of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:10:33] right and you become joint HS with the
[1:10:35] Lord Jesus Christ oh Church you got the
[1:10:38] power if you got the faith to use it
[1:10:40] that's it you see that's where we lack
[1:10:42] it we lack the faith what is Faith it's
[1:10:45] Revelation why do we lack Revelation
[1:10:46] because we don't feed on the word enough
[1:10:48] that's it or we don't put the emphasis
[1:10:51] enough on Christ that's right we're too
[1:10:53] busy trying to be Christians that's
[1:10:55] right rather than just serving God and
[1:10:56] getting to know God we're too busy
[1:10:58] trying to fulfill some kind of creed and
[1:11:00] fulfill some kind of thing that we think
[1:11:02] we have to do it and and we're
[1:11:04] completely missing
[1:11:06] God Lord help us right I mean help me
[1:11:10] I'm not perfect at all you see you see
[1:11:14] but we have the power we just don't have
[1:11:15] the faith to use it amen so if there's
[1:11:18] something lacking in your life you know
[1:11:22] what the problem is you don't have the
[1:11:24] faith to use the power that's it you
[1:11:26] don't need power that's it oh give us
[1:11:29] the power of God I want access to the
[1:11:31] power I need more power of Christ in my
[1:11:33] life no you don't you have all the power
[1:11:35] of Christ in your life you say God give
[1:11:37] me the faith to use iten you see there's
[1:11:40] there's you know Believers and miracles
[1:11:43] have happened in their life because they
[1:11:45] have the faith to use it you are that's
[1:11:47] right now all things must be done
[1:11:49] according to God's will of course but
[1:11:51] you lack we lack oh ye of little faith
[1:11:54] that's right that's what he says he
[1:11:55] didn't say oh you of little power he
[1:11:58] said oh you of little faith have not I
[1:12:00] been so long with you that's it you see
[1:12:02] Saints how not the Lord been so long in
[1:12:05] your life hidden behind your skin and
[1:12:07] you still lack the faith to use the
[1:12:09] power he's standing there saying you
[1:12:11] have all of it that's right if you just
[1:12:13] have the faith to use it and he's
[1:12:16] saying he said so then he shows you
[1:12:19] again how it's done sir he stood on the
[1:12:21] boat he oh ye have little faith have I
[1:12:23] been so long with you but he still stood
[1:12:24] on the and spoke to the storm why
[1:12:27] because he was showing them how to use
[1:12:28] it he was giving them Revelation amen
[1:12:32] cuz they saw the word in action that's
[1:12:34] it you see the word read when you read
[1:12:37] the word of God it comes into your soul
[1:12:39] and then you believe it it goes into
[1:12:42] action how's that how's that go Faith
[1:12:44] puts into action or something like that
[1:12:47] there's a quote maybe Brother David
[1:12:48] knows I can't remember but brother bam
[1:12:53] says fa I think he says faith puts the
[1:12:55] word into
[1:12:57] action
[1:12:59] so love came to the lamb oh Church you
[1:13:02] got the power if you got the faith to
[1:13:04] use it amen that's what we need Lord
[1:13:06] give us more faith today so where is is
[1:13:10] Christ today well I think we all know
[1:13:12] the answer to that question by now I
[1:13:13] would hope so Christ is in you the real
[1:13:16] you that's right the real you I you know
[1:13:20] it's hard to believe it and that's the
[1:13:23] point if it wasn't hard if it wasn't
[1:13:25] hard there be no character formed that's
[1:13:28] it it has to be hard it has to be hard
[1:13:30] to believe it it has to be hard to to
[1:13:32] have the faith to access the power of
[1:13:34] God because there would be no character
[1:13:36] so he puts you through the ringer so
[1:13:39] that you
[1:13:40] realize he puts you in a position
[1:13:43] whether whether by trial he puts you in
[1:13:45] a position by trial that's how he does
[1:13:47] it and then now you have no you have no
[1:13:51] other way but to have the faith he
[1:13:55] almost pushes you into a corner right
[1:13:58] job was shoved into a corner and what
[1:14:00] happened Christ came
[1:14:03] forth that's why the the Lord said go
[1:14:05] ahead to the devil go ahead and test job
[1:14:07] because I know what will happen how did
[1:14:09] God have that Faith because he knew what
[1:14:12] was in job that's it because he knew Job
[1:14:15] you know when the sons of God came
[1:14:17] together job was there too the real job
[1:14:20] was there amen job just didn't realize
[1:14:23] the real him was there but he was was
[1:14:25] here at the same time you're there but
[1:14:27] you're here at the same time but that's
[1:14:29] the real you this is the ne well brother
[1:14:32] this is the negative in the
[1:14:34] film yeah I'm my goodness I don't know I
[1:14:38] was still pretty young when digital
[1:14:40] cameras came out but I remember film
[1:14:42] Titus do you remember film cameras yeah
[1:14:45] cool okay guess if you have parents who
[1:14:47] are just stuck in the old ways and no
[1:14:49] matter how old you are you'll have film
[1:14:51] but you look at it it's the worst thing
[1:14:52] you ever saw in your life
[1:14:55] you know you hold up to the light it's
[1:14:57] terrible like my goodness and then you
[1:14:59] develop it and it's a beautiful
[1:15:01] picture and that there is you is your
[1:15:04] flesh now that's exactly
[1:15:07] right and then because that's not the
[1:15:09] real you that's it Lord help us to catch
[1:15:12] that that's why he says if you catch
[1:15:15] that I'm going to read between the lines
[1:15:18] for you right now if you can come into
[1:15:20] contact with the real you you will be an
[1:15:22] invincible Army amen that's what brother
[1:15:24] man saying that's what he
[1:15:26] say he says okay so as Christ was the
[1:15:29] first one to
[1:15:31] raise from all the
[1:15:33] prophets and so forth although typed in
[1:15:36] many places he was the first fruits of
[1:15:38] those that slept in the bride coming of
[1:15:41] Christ coming out of the church there'll
[1:15:43] have to be a sheath waved again in the
[1:15:45] last days waving of the sheath what was
[1:15:48] the sheath the first one that come to to
[1:15:50] mature the first one that proved it was
[1:15:52] a wheat that proved it was a sheep
[1:15:55] in other words he was our example do you
[1:15:57] want me to switch to a handheld mic here
[1:15:59] let me
[1:16:07] switch first one that come to mature the
[1:16:10] first one that proved it was a wheat
[1:16:11] that proved it was a sheath so he was
[1:16:13] our example what what was he an example
[1:16:15] of of who we really are the real you the
[1:16:18] real you is that sheath that wave
[1:16:20] offering cuz he was the first one to
[1:16:22] come to maturity so that wave over you

[1:16:27] this is what it really looks like you
[1:16:29] see God brought forth the word revealed
[1:16:31] Christ to you so you could see that's
[1:16:33] what I really need to look like that's
[1:16:35] the real me you saw that open up to you
[1:16:38] it had to be waved so that you knew what
[1:16:41] to become that's it Christ had to be
[1:16:44] revealed every part of Christ had to be
[1:16:46] revealed in the world in the age we
[1:16:48] living today because we need to be
[1:16:50] exactly like the first amen he is Alpha
[1:16:54] and Omega the beginning and the end and
[1:16:56] we are the bride of
[1:16:58] Christ waving of the sheath what was the
[1:17:00] sheath okay the first one to come to
[1:17:03] maturity Hallelujah I'm sure you see I'm
[1:17:06] sure you see what I'm talking about do
[1:17:08] you see what he's talking about tonight
[1:17:10] do you catch it are you catching it the
[1:17:12] only way you can catch it is by faith it
[1:17:14] was waved over the people and the first
[1:17:15] time that will come forth for the bride
[1:17:18] age where we are today for the bride age
[1:17:21] for your Resurrection out of dark
[1:17:23] denominationalism he doesn't say
[1:17:25] denominations he says denominationalism
[1:17:28] because that's the same thing we're
[1:17:29] dealing with today that's why the
[1:17:31] message church is the mess is because
[1:17:34] it's denominationalism oh The Message
[1:17:36] Church the message will never denominate
[1:17:38] no it won't but there'll be
[1:17:39] denominationalism in the message and the
[1:17:42] only way for you to oppose that is to
[1:17:44] look to the chath look to the wave
[1:17:46] offering and says that's the real thing
[1:17:49] that's the real me that's what I need to
[1:17:52] be he says he says will be a message
[1:17:56] amen the message is the way she that's
[1:17:59] it that the full maturity of the word
[1:18:03] has turned back again in its full power
[1:18:06] see we're not lacking power we're
[1:18:08] lacking the faith to use the power and
[1:18:11] waved over the People by the same signs
[1:18:14] and wonders that he did back there amen
[1:18:17] because I live ye live also speaking to
[1:18:20] his wife praise the Lord because I live
[1:18:24] ye live also what a resurrection that
[1:18:26] that was and what a resurrection this is
[1:18:31] you see I was I was out running today
[1:18:34] and I was listening to a tape and I
[1:18:36] realized where the emotion lies the
[1:18:39] emotion lies you know because he says
[1:18:41] you know you got to have the emotion and
[1:18:42] I realize the emotion when it's sprung
[1:18:45] from the word like this that comes forth
[1:18:48] and you just can't hold on to yourself
[1:18:50] it's not the music provoking it it's the
[1:18:52] word of God provoking it that's the
[1:18:54] emotion we need to have he stand up here
[1:18:57] she shouting and spitting like I am
[1:18:59] right now the world says wow that guy's
[1:19:00] a fanatic why because the word of God
[1:19:02] within me is quickening something
[1:19:04] because I know this I heard this one
[1:19:07] time before the world was ever formed
[1:19:09] before there was ever a star in the sky
[1:19:10] I heard these words and now the deep is
[1:19:14] responding why because the real me was
[1:19:18] there not this guy that you see not this
[1:19:21] guy that you see but the real me was
[1:19:24] there that's
[1:19:25] right praise the Lord saints of God if
[1:19:29] if we could just catch a revelation of
[1:19:31] that we would stop fighting with one
[1:19:32] another that's right we would stop being
[1:19:35] so disagreeable we would stop being
[1:19:37] depressed we would stop getting mad at
[1:19:39] the person in front of us in the road I
[1:19:41] say that all the time because that's my
[1:19:42] problem guys mad the person behind us
[1:19:45] who's riding our tail we wouldn't even
[1:19:47] care that's it you know a true Son of
[1:19:49] God of God Son of Son of God cannot be
[1:19:51] provoked that's right I believe that yes
[1:19:54] sir and you say well I've been provoked
[1:19:57] I'm not a real Son of God no no no no no
[1:19:59] no the real you the real you can't be
[1:20:02] provoked all you have to do is say God
[1:20:04] increase my faith my Revelation so that
[1:20:07] more often than not the real me talks
[1:20:10] amen more often than not I act like the
[1:20:12] real me that's right you know when kids
[1:20:15] are growing up and they're transitioning
[1:20:16] from one phase in their life to the next
[1:20:19] every once in a while they we we call it
[1:20:20] regress they go back and they act like a
[1:20:23] baby he say hey that's not who you are
[1:20:26] you have to remind them as their parent
[1:20:28] you say look son you're not a baby
[1:20:30] anymore speak strong act like a man
[1:20:33] because that's what you are amen that's
[1:20:35] why Paul said when I was a child I spake
[1:20:37] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:20:39] away childish things why it's time to
[1:20:42] transition it's time to step forward in
[1:20:45] maturity and say you know what I am not
[1:20:48] that anymore I
[1:20:50] am the Son of God Amen a excuse me a son
[1:20:54] of God
[1:20:55] M be Son of God
[1:20:56] actually go ahead you can say it it's
[1:20:58] not blasphemy because it's Christ in you
[1:21:01] it's Christ in you oh my goodness can we
[1:21:04] even catch a hold of that The God Who
[1:21:06] came down and created flesh to walk in
[1:21:08] as mzc The God Who came down and spoke
[1:21:11] to Abraham and says why did Sarah laugh
[1:21:14] behind the in the tent behind him the
[1:21:17] same God who who who went to the grave
[1:21:20] and and took your sins and rose again
[1:21:22] and and the same God who performed the
[1:21:24] Miracles and and and the prophet and the
[1:21:26] word that came forth and The Sword and
[1:21:28] the Hand this isn't just stories this is
[1:21:31] this is the reality this is the real you
[1:21:34] that's right you you know what can I say
[1:21:37] this you were there when he held the
[1:21:39] sword in his hand why were you there
[1:21:41] because you were a you're a brandom no
[1:21:44] no because it's God you're part of
[1:21:46] Christ so you stood there when the sword
[1:21:49] came down that you were right there you
[1:21:52] were a part of that because that's the
[1:21:54] real you he said well I wasn't born yet
[1:21:56] it doesn't matter you were always you
[1:21:59] always were amen
[1:22:03] amen oh God help
[1:22:05] us what a rection that and what a res
[1:22:08] Resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:22:11] from the dead to may be made alive in
[1:22:14] Christ
[1:22:17] Jesus by God's quickening power
[1:22:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:22:28] and forever you know Saints this was the
[1:22:30] this was one of the the scriptures that
[1:22:33] he brother B uses as his campaign
[1:22:37] slogan and the more I learn about God
[1:22:41] the more revelation God gives me of his
[1:22:42] word I always come back to this
[1:22:45] scripture exactly right it wasn't just
[1:22:47] he didn't just use it to use it no there
[1:22:50] was an inspiration this is the model for
[1:22:52] the bright age amen
[1:22:54] when when you get to know more of Christ
[1:22:56] and God reveals the things in the
[1:22:58] scriptures to you and things in the
[1:22:59] message together to
[1:23:02] you all of a sudden the light bulb comes
[1:23:04] on and you think my goodness that's
[1:23:06] amazing you'll come back to this
[1:23:08] scripture that's right because you
[1:23:10] realize oh it's Christ that's it it's
[1:23:17] Christ where was Samson's Victory we've
[1:23:22] heard Samson mentioned a few times in
[1:23:23] the past few
[1:23:25] Services where was his victory he said
[1:23:28] well he was in the in the house in the
[1:23:30] grinding away and and the hair came
[1:23:33] back that was not his victory no that's
[1:23:36] right his victory was when he came into
[1:23:38] contact with himself Amen in that
[1:23:41] grinding house he realized who he really
[1:23:44] was
[1:23:47] amen he realized who he really was and
[1:23:49] the reason he was acting like that
[1:23:51] before is because he didn't know the
[1:23:53] Real hymn that's it that was his victory
[1:23:58] when he recognized the Real hymn and you
[1:24:01] know what happened he killed more in his
[1:24:03] death he was more successful in his
[1:24:06] death than in his entire life so let me
[1:24:08] ask you this are the footsteps of the
[1:24:09] righteous order of the Lord says why my
[1:24:12] goodness Samson made a giant mess did
[1:24:16] he if he didn't do what he did with
[1:24:18] Delilah he wouldn't have killed that
[1:24:20] many
[1:24:21] Philistines you see what I mean when I
[1:24:23] say when you realize the real you that's
[1:24:26] it he says well I did all this I made
[1:24:28] this mistake I I I I just I I I made
[1:24:30] this mistake that I cannot change in my
[1:24:32] life Samson couldn't either he didn't
[1:24:34] have any eyes that's
[1:24:37] right but he realized who he was he had
[1:24:42] to be there he had to come to that
[1:24:46] position the more I the more I feed on
[1:24:49] this saints of God the more I realize
[1:24:51] God his a a true son and daughter of God
[1:24:54] can do and make terrible mistakes yes
[1:24:59] sir but God's will is not lost that's he
[1:25:04] he he it's not that he uses those like
[1:25:07] oh it happened I I can use that he uses
[1:25:10] those that's it but remember says God
[1:25:13] gave us free moral agency so that the
[1:25:17] Adam and Eve would fall in the garden
[1:25:20] that's it see well God caus it to happen
[1:25:22] well kind of but they still had the
[1:25:24] choice that's if you can catch a
[1:25:27] revelation of that your past will stop
[1:25:30] haunting you that's it exactly if you
[1:25:32] can realize all of that that you did the
[1:25:35] mistakes that you made was God's hand
[1:25:39] that's that's exactly right Saints you
[1:25:41] will see the real
[1:25:43] you yes sir Gideon where was Gideon's
[1:25:46] Victory when he came into contact with
[1:25:49] himself that's it God said have not I
[1:25:51] sent thee and Gideon went away thinking
[1:25:53] why did he say that why did he say how
[1:25:56] why didn't he tell me where where the
[1:25:58] Miracles were why did he say have not I
[1:26:00] sent thee and then and then he went
[1:26:02] along and he went along and he went
[1:26:04] along and we say oh Gideon was weak
[1:26:06] that's why God set him down no no no no
[1:26:08] no he was right in the hand of God cuz
[1:26:12] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:26:13] ordered of the lord we either have to
[1:26:16] believe that or we don't it can't be
[1:26:19] applied to certain situations it's
[1:26:21] either all the time or it's not so
[1:26:24] Gideon goes down to the tent and what
[1:26:26] does he hear he hears about the bread of
[1:26:28] life and he says oh that's who I am you
[1:26:32] think oh you know Gideon just got the
[1:26:33] courage because he heard he was going to
[1:26:35] win no kide Gideon got the C courage
[1:26:38] because he realized who he was he says
[1:26:40] I'm the
[1:26:42] deliverer I'm the one that I'm the god
[1:26:45] that's why God said have not I sent thee
[1:26:47] he's right here that's what Gideon tried
[1:26:50] to do when he handed his son The Sword
[1:26:52] and said slay him slay the enemy you
[1:26:55] have the power to do it and his son
[1:26:57] couldn't do it and it came back to haunt
[1:26:59] him you see God takes us through things
[1:27:01] and then we we stand here you stand
[1:27:03] there with your brother saying slay it
[1:27:05] take the sword slay it why because
[1:27:07] Gideon knew who he was amen that's why
[1:27:10] Gideon grabbed the sword and took care
[1:27:12] of business amen so
[1:27:16] now where do you find your Victory
[1:27:18] that's it
[1:27:24] where do you find your
[1:27:27] Victory when you come into contact with
[1:27:29] himself that's it right there it is see
[1:27:32] that's terrible English brother
[1:27:37] Chris but it makes the point that's when
[1:27:40] you come into contact with the real you
[1:27:42] who's the real you it's Christ Christ in
[1:27:45] you the hope of glory the hope of glory

[1:28:15] only
[1:28:16] reason the fake you gets in the
[1:28:20] way it's because you stopped remembering

[1:28:26] it's so important not to get too busy in
[1:28:28] life that's it because when you're busy
[1:28:30] in life and you're caught up with all of
