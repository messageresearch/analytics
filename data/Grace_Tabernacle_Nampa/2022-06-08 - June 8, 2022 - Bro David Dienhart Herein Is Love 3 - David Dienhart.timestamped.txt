[28:54] amen living
[28:56] god bless you tonight it's good to be
[28:58] in the house of the lord
[29:01] this is a building
[29:03] when you're here it's the house of the
[29:04] lord
[29:06] because you're the house
[29:08] i mean i'm glad for that aren't you and
[29:10] in this house god bless you
[29:13] let's stand together
[29:15] i'd like you to turn with me
[29:18] to the book of matthew
[29:22] i was tossed around and reading this
[29:24] because i i have a part 4 and if i don't
[29:27] finish part 3 i'll go to 3b
[29:30] so we'll have to do it that way
[29:33] it looks like about five parts the lord
[29:35] willing
[29:36] and
[29:38] it just keeps building as the word does
[29:40] and there's many many many quotes and
[29:43] things that i'd have to leave i can't
[29:44] even begin to touch them it's just all
[29:47] over
[29:48] and but
[29:50] but
[29:51] god
[29:52] is love
[29:55] and remember what we said remember one
[29:58] thing
[30:00] love never fails
[30:03] love never fails
[30:06] praise the lord let's bow our heads in
[30:07] word of prayer our heavenly father as we
[30:10] bow in your presence
[30:11] we want to thank you right now for
[30:13] meeting every need that's been spoken
[30:15] here over this destiny
[30:17] it's been asked for we believe it's now
[30:19] taking place
[30:21] we believe it's being manifested
[30:23] because you made the promise
[30:25] and we believe what you said
[30:28] and now father god we thank you for this
[30:30] opportunity to be assembled together
[30:32] and those that are listening in on the
[30:34] internet lord may you bless them as the
[30:36] word goes forth may you impart life
[30:39] strength and whatever they have need of
[30:42] not only to us present but through thy
[30:44] word to those that are listening in
[30:46] we say it in the name of jesus christ
[30:49] for the glory of god
[30:51] and now father
[30:53] we expect and know that these words
[30:55] cannot drop
[30:57] you said that your word was nigh us even
[30:59] in our mouth
[31:00] and because you said if you abide in me
[31:02] and my word and you ask what you will
[31:05] because it's not our will it's not even
[31:08] our name we're asking in your name and
[31:10] that you asking through us
[31:12] so thy will
[31:14] is being done
[31:15] now father we thank you for your word we
[31:17] ask you to impart it as you desire to
[31:19] every individual as you please
[31:22] and father may this word become alive in
[31:24] our hearts we are calling upon you for
[31:26] revelation
[31:28] that lord is more important in our lives
[31:30] and we begin to even imagine
[31:33] lord because your prophet said we are
[31:35] saved by revelation because revelation
[31:37] is the revelation of your own self
[31:41] your word
[31:42] yourself in us
[31:45] we thank you for that now give you
[31:47] praise expecting the seating and
[31:49] abundantly and to walk out of here
[31:50] closer to you
[31:52] because of your presence because of your
[31:54] word coming forth may we draw life
[31:56] through this filter provided for us to
[31:58] make a rapture
[32:00] in jesus name amen
[32:03] amen
[32:04] herein is love part three
[32:07] my subtitle here would be the word
[32:10] living
[32:11] and in
[32:12] action love
[32:15] in action
[32:17] the word living and in action the
[32:19] prophet said this bride
[32:20] would be and i believe she is now
[32:24] the word
[32:25] living
[32:26] and in action there's no other person
[32:28] upon the face of the earth only the
[32:30] bride because only in her can the
[32:32] mystery of himself be revealed
[32:35] so she is the word living
[32:38] he is the word living and by the same
[32:40] spirit she is the word living and in
[32:43] action it's good to see our young people
[32:45] back god bless you trust you had a good
[32:46] service a good time i should say at camp
[32:49] and good services
[32:51] amen so we i'm sure that brother paul
[32:54] would ask you for testimonies but we
[32:56] don't have time tonight
[32:59] so no i don't mean it that way it
[33:01] sounded we have time but just carry on
[33:05] one thing you want to do come come and
[33:06] come from a camp
[33:08] is keep feeding on the word you've got
[33:10] to feed your experience
[33:13] don't fail to forget that feed your
[33:15] experience
[33:17] amen and you'll grow in christ
[33:19] amen
[33:21] so if you'll turn with me to matthew
[33:22] maybe you already have 6 verse 22.
[33:31] i'll just read verse 21 with it
[33:34] for where your treasure is
[33:37] there your heart
[33:39] be also
[33:41] for where your treasure is now it
[33:43] depends what your treasure is see so
[33:45] where your treasure is there your heart
[33:47] be
[33:48] also
[33:50] the light
[33:51] watch how he brings us right behind it
[33:53] the light of the body is the eye
[33:56] now i want you to look at this
[33:57] spiritually it is natural but let's look
[34:00] at it spiritual the light the light god
[34:03] is light in him is no darkness the light
[34:06] of the body is the eye
[34:10] that's what sees
[34:12] okay the light of the body is the eye
[34:15] if therefore thine eye be single
[34:19] let that word single just
[34:21] leap out at you
[34:24] therefore thine i be single thy whole
[34:27] body shall be full of light
[34:31] but if thine i be evil thy whole body
[34:34] shall be full of darkness
[34:36] if therefore that light that is in the
[34:39] be darkness
[34:42] how great
[34:44] is that darkness
[34:46] now watch how he comes right behind this
[34:48] because he's bringing the same thing in
[34:49] another little parable no man can serve
[34:52] two masters
[34:54] you can't serve two and have your eyes
[34:55] single
[34:57] it's either the one or the other prophet
[34:59] said you're identified you must be
[35:00] identified in this hour you're either in
[35:03] christ
[35:04] or out of christ he said there's no
[35:06] halfway
[35:09] amen you're either in christ or out of
[35:11] christ there is no halfway
[35:15] so you can if your eye be single
[35:18] if thy light if the light be thine i
[35:22] if thy light be single i be single
[35:26] then your body's full of light you can't
[35:28] serve two masters for either you will
[35:29] hate the one and love the other or else
[35:32] you will hold to the one and despise the
[35:34] other
[35:35] you can't serve god and mammon
[35:37] and remember there's two powers in the
[35:39] world
[35:40] there's the power of satan by deception
[35:42] it's evil which is unbelief
[35:44] and it's a power but his power is
[35:47] is perversion
[35:49] there is upon another power which is
[35:51] original
[35:52] which we're going back to which is god's
[35:55] own power which is his word which is
[35:57] eternal
[35:58] for there's two powers the purity spirit
[36:00] of god and the spirit of the devil
[36:04] amen
[36:06] and one of those powers is motivating in
[36:08] everything you do everything we do every
[36:11] everything we say
[36:13] every every person everything
[36:15] is that's being done is motivated by one
[36:17] of is controlled by one of those two
[36:20] powers
[36:21] amen
[36:22] it's manifesting one of the two
[36:26] amen

[37:44] today he is standing among us now isn't
[37:46] that positive that's wonderful he is
[37:48] standing among us
[37:51] in the person
[37:52] of the holy ghost that person is an
[37:54] eternal life person eternal life is a

[38:00] us in the person of the holy of the holy
[38:03] spirit which is the person of eternal
[38:06] life
[38:07] and that is what's leading the bride
[38:11] he's standing among us not just back
[38:13] here when a man when a prophet was on
[38:15] the scene
[38:16] he's standing here as the word of that
[38:18] prophet that prophecy has turned
[38:20] his turn from the prophet you can
[38:23] receive this to his prophecy
[38:26] you are his prophecy
[38:30] amen you are his the word spoken for the
[38:33] season made manifest you are the
[38:36] prophecy that god gave through his
[38:39] prophet speaking of you
[38:42] just if you don't believe if you don't
[38:43] want to accept that go back to pick up
[38:45] your pen and write
[38:47] he spoke what his prophecy was
[38:50] all right
[38:51] god did
[38:53] so he's so he's standing among us in the
[38:55] person of the holy ghost
[38:57] manifesting note manifesting himself
[39:02] more
[39:03] and more
[39:05] where coming into his
[39:08] church
[39:10] that's his bride
[39:11] manifesting himself more and more coming
[39:13] into his church making
[39:16] himself brother brandon used the word
[39:18] his self same thing himself his self
[39:22] known
[39:23] known
[39:25] not imagine
[39:26] not imagination not not something of the
[39:29] past he is standing among us in the
[39:31] person of the holy ghost manifesting
[39:33] himself more and more
[39:36] more and more greater and greater
[39:38] not less and less
[39:42] he's manifesting himself more and more
[39:45] coming into his church making himself
[39:49] not another not someone else not a
[39:52] church not a building but making himself
[39:55] known
[39:56] where
[39:57] in his church
[39:59] where in his church in his bride in his
[40:02] people in his provided place of worship
[40:07] now watch this
[40:08] they're becoming one for what
[40:11] if you remember on page 27 perfect faith
[40:14] he's pouring himself into her into the
[40:16] bride they are becoming one for what the
[40:18] wedding supper which is a celebration of
[40:20] a marriage
[40:22] all right so he's becoming one
[40:25] becoming one for the wedding supper
[40:28] making himself known revealing god
[40:32] see revealing god
[40:34] you came from revealing the god you came
[40:37] from
[40:39] as he did
[40:41] only
[40:43] as excuse me revealing god he's
[40:45] revealing god make himself known
[40:47] revealing god
[40:48] you came from god as he did
[40:52] but the only thing difference between
[40:54] you and jesus christ was you bypassed
[40:57] your theophany
[41:00] and you don't know all things
[41:02] only as god reveals himself to you but
[41:04] the one that's in you his spirit that
[41:07] became in flesh jesus never did bypass
[41:09] his theophany
[41:11] he was a man but he was first visited
[41:14] abraham
[41:15] not as jesus man
[41:17] but as god in flesh so he became
[41:20] theophany before he became the word in
[41:22] the flesh
[41:24] as a kinsman to us
[41:26] i mean i i hope i you understand what
[41:28] i'm saying okay now
[41:34] speaking of his church
[41:36] brother branham in the message
[41:39] um in shreveport god's chosen place of
[41:43] worship he called god's
[41:46] uh
[41:50] god's place of work again wait a minute
[41:52] god's
[41:53] chosen place of worship and then he he
[41:55] spoke of god's
[41:57] provided place of worship and then he
[41:59] said god's only that's what i'm trying
[42:01] to say in the in this report he said
[42:03] god's only
[42:05] provided place of worship
[42:07] all right then
[42:08] so he said only
[42:10] you can only worship
[42:12] god
[42:14] in the church
[42:15] of his choosing
[42:18] he said god has a church that's only a
[42:21] church of his choosing now he's not
[42:23] talking about the buildings
[42:24] he's not talking about this church over
[42:26] here in some other church over here he
[42:28] only you can only worship him in the
[42:30] church he said of his choosing he has
[42:32] only one church he chose for you to
[42:35] worship in
[42:39] and it's the church of his choosing his
[42:40] chosen place of worship you cannot
[42:42] worship him in another church nor will
[42:44] he receive your worship and have the
[42:46] other place
[42:47] rather than where he placed his name
[42:52] he can't now he if you're you're
[42:54] watching here he's remember he's
[42:56] standing in our midst
[42:58] you can't worship him in any other place
[43:00] but where he chose to place his name and
[43:02] that's the church of his choosing
[43:05] now i'm not we're not talking about well
[43:08] you take the choice of your church you
[43:10] choose to come here to this church he's
[43:11] not talking about this
[43:13] the church of his choosing is the
[43:15] mystical body of jesus christ
[43:18] amen that's the church of his choosing
[43:21] that's his body
[43:23] that's himself
[43:25] all right then and you cannot you cannot
[43:28] fight you cannot worship him only in
[43:31] that place
[43:35] now that's pretty straight
[43:36] because a lot of people are worshiping
[43:38] but the bible said they worship him in
[43:40] vain
[43:42] because why they're not born again
[43:46] amen you must be born again to be able
[43:48] to worship him in that place
[43:54] you can only come into this place
[43:56] through the blood and the baptism of the
[43:58] holy spirit
[43:59] you say well what is the baptism holy
[44:01] spirit it's the new birth
[44:04] the baptism of the holy spirit is the
[44:06] new birth
[44:08] all right the new birth
[44:10] or you are baptized by one spirit or
[44:13] born or birthed into that body by one
[44:16] spirit into one body which is christ the
[44:20] only place of worship
[44:23] all right
[44:24] now first corinthians 6 17 says by he
[44:28] that has joined unto god unto the lord
[44:30] he that is joined unto the lord is one
[44:33] spirit
[44:35] amen
[44:36] now that
[44:38] i pray that god will reveal that to
[44:40] every one of us
[44:42] because because when you see that
[44:45] you're seeing who you are
[44:49] not only seeing you who you are but that
[44:51] but that is the revelation of who you
[44:53] are
[44:53] because it's christ revealed in you
[44:57] he that has joined or united
[45:00] we're talking about union here he that
[45:03] is joined or united to one to the lord
[45:06] is
[45:07] that spirit remember
[45:09] brother jesus said himself he that is
[45:11] born to the flesh is flesh and he that
[45:14] is born of the spirit is
[45:16] spirit
[45:18] amen
[45:19] amen that's talking about his spirit
[45:22] because you're born of him
[45:24] you become him
[45:26] if you're born of him who are you
[45:29] you can't
[45:30] another hallelujah if i'm born to my
[45:34] father i'm his son
[45:36] amen is that right i'm his son i came
[45:39] from him i have a part of him
[45:43] amen i'm identified by him
[45:46] if you give me a blood test my blood
[45:48] test would prove i come from my father
[45:51] you give the church a real blood test
[45:52] it'll prove whether they came from him
[45:54] or not
[45:56] all right so you see so you realize then
[46:01] that's why the prophet said on on on
[46:04] things that are to be he said you are
[46:06] the spirit of god in you
[46:08] that's you
[46:10] that's what brings the body under
[46:12] obedience to the word is you are in that
[46:14] body it's you in that body he said
[46:18] amen
[46:19] all right that tells you where you come
[46:21] from
[46:22] who you are and where you're going and
[46:24] there's only one
[46:27] literature that can tell you that and
[46:28] that's the word
[46:30] but it was hid until it was opened by
[46:32] those seven seals and the full
[46:34] revelation of it was not opened until
[46:38] that seventh seal capped the thing off
[46:41] amen
[46:42] that's right
[46:43] all right now you've united now he comes
[46:46] right behind this and said you've he i
[46:50] that was when i spoke of his choosing
[46:52] and things that was that was what i said
[46:54] now i'm coming back to what he said
[46:55] you've united by the word
[46:59] you've been you've united or you've come
[47:01] in union by the word and the word
[47:04] was in the beginning is that right the
[47:06] word is original the word of god is
[47:09] original anything added to or taken from
[47:11] that is perversion
[47:14] amen so the word is original was in the
[47:17] beginning that word will go back to the
[47:19] beginning so you can't see what is time
[47:22] time is simply eternity space
[47:26] that's what time is it came down
[47:28] eternity came down into a hickey of time
[47:30] that it has to go right back into
[47:32] eternity again it come from god we go
[47:34] back to god jesus said i come from god i
[47:36] return back to god
[47:38] i bypass theophany then i'm returning to
[47:40] my i'm returning back to what i should
[47:43] have been but i came anyway into a body
[47:45] of flesh direct from the mind of god
[47:48] amen is that right but we're not
[47:50] conformed to the world we're being
[47:52] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[47:56] to prove what is good and acceptable and
[47:58] the perfect will of god
[48:00] all right so he said we so we and the
[48:03] word was in the beginning we'll go right
[48:05] back to the beginning
[48:09] and
[48:10] that and he said which is god and so we
[48:13] see there's a restoration back in our
[48:15] day and our time this message is a
[48:17] message of restoring restorating
[48:20] restoring to what the original eden
[48:22] without this message we'd never be
[48:24] restored back to the original again and
[48:27] pick up to where we left off
[48:30] to where we left off in the seventh day
[48:33] seventh day wasn't completed so we have
[48:35] to go back to where that left and we
[48:39] pick it right back up as though it never
[48:40] ended
[48:44] because eternity doesn't have the
[48:46] beginning it doesn't have an end but it
[48:48] dropped down into time but that didn't
[48:49] move eternity it goes right back into
[48:51] eternity again it just goes rolls on
[48:56] amen you come down here from the mind of
[48:58] god and the thought of god come down
[49:00] here in a body of flesh god said it and
[49:03] and you bypassed it because of the
[49:05] unbelief
[49:06] you were represented you had to be you
[49:08] were represented by adam and eve
[49:10] amen
[49:12] and so god knowing this would have to
[49:15] bring you back
[49:16] because it's himself he's bringing back
[49:18] to show forth his attributes of what he
[49:21] wanted and had in his mind he used the
[49:23] devil as a tool
[49:26] god can't lose anything he will not lose
[49:29] himself
[49:31] and if you were in the thinking of
[49:33] himself you have to be himself in this
[49:35] hour that's the earnest of our change
[49:38] and we become from this body into a new
[49:41] body
[49:42] which the word revealed in us is
[49:44] bringing us to
[49:45] so you have no fear you can let off the
[49:47] pressure
[49:48] if his word himself is revealed in you
[49:52] it testifies that you're in him and you
[49:54] have a body waiting
[49:59] amen amen all right so
[50:02] so he said because he said in that day
[50:04] and prophet said that day that jesus
[50:07] spoke of in saint john 14 20 is this
[50:10] day and so in that day you'll know
[50:14] you're not going to come to an
[50:15] imagination you're going to have this
[50:17] thing revealed to you
[50:19] that you came from god
[50:22] praise the lord
[50:23] and that's your and you're returning
[50:25] right back to god you came from god amen
[50:28] you were in his son and now that what
[50:30] was in his son is now revealed in you
[50:35] in the form of the holy ghost which is
[50:37] not another person it's god the person
[50:42] manifested in another form
[50:45] now we're coming to that in just a
[50:46] minute
[50:47] but in that day you'll know that i am in
[50:49] my father
[50:51] uh you say brother david what are you
[50:53] talking about i'm talking about love
[50:56] in that day you'll know that i'm in my
[50:58] father in that day this day you will
[51:01] know why because the seal had been
[51:03] opened to seal this in the book the book
[51:05] was a sealed book
[51:08] the little book of the complete
[51:09] revelation of of of jesus christ
[51:13] was sealed
[51:15] but it was unsealed we see who the
[51:18] manifestation or the mystery of god is
[51:21] it's you
[51:23] the full mystery of god is revealed
[51:26] in the day of the seventh angel his
[51:28] message his voice
[51:30] which is still being voiced
[51:32] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[51:34] angel the mystery of god
[51:36] would be finished
[51:39] completed
[51:40] full completely fulfilled
[51:44] so we also was found in that revelation
[51:48] the bible is the complete revelation of
[51:50] jesus christ and the book of revelation
[51:53] reveals that you were in him always
[51:57] hallelujah
[51:59] all right
[52:00] now
[52:01] i am in my father that that day you'll
[52:04] know that i am in my father the father's
[52:07] in me
[52:09] i
[52:11] in you
[52:13] who is that i eternal life god himself i
[52:16] in you and you in me
[52:22] hallelujah
[52:25] hallelujah
[52:26] i said that he said it we're here
[52:29] he said hallelujah we're here this is
[52:32] the day of that revealing hallelujah
[52:35] we're here
[52:38] and one day you'll see one day you'll
[52:41] see that's an individual you'll see
[52:43] one day you'll see that what you feel in
[52:46] your heart and see his identification
[52:48] will become personalized
[52:52] before you
[52:55] now that not only that not only is a
[52:57] change of our body becoming be
[52:59] personalized what's in me it becomes
[53:01] personalized but it's becoming
[53:03] personalized to the place of of of a of
[53:06] a perfect position
[53:09] what is my perfect position you can't go
[53:11] any higher than god himself which is our
[53:14] headstone
[53:17] amen he brings it right up to that
[53:19] position
[53:20] and caps the bride off
[53:23] amen
[53:24] amen she we were identified under that
[53:27] headstone that headstone which is love
[53:31] himself
[53:33] identifies the bride
[53:35] by the capping of her
[53:37] positioning of her
[53:40] amen
[53:42] identifying her
[53:45] all right
[53:46] much of this i have to kill hold back
[53:48] because i don't want to go back into
[53:49] part four here so
[53:51] one day you'll see now he said become
[53:54] personalized then he said then you and
[53:58] he are one so the personalizing himself
[54:00] was taking the veil off of himself
[54:04] and unveiled himself
[54:06] so we could have a full view
[54:08] and real life
[54:10] mama
[54:11] say
[54:12] that's me
[54:14] because when you look into the mirror of
[54:15] his word
[54:17] you're going to see who you are
[54:20] by seeing who he is you're seeing who
[54:21] you are when you look at yourself you're
[54:23] looking at the glory of god
[54:27] which is his wife
[54:31] which is himself
[54:33] all right
[54:34] now
[54:35] i'm not just saying cliches here this is
[54:38] real this has become this is reality
[54:40] that's why we're getting close to our
[54:42] body change
[54:45] now
[54:46] he said
[54:47] then you and he are one now watch what
[54:49] he says god will be so manifested into
[54:52] his bride
[54:54] he's not talking about a day off of here
[54:56] he's talking about right now
[54:58] to be changed
[55:01] to a full
[55:03] adoption
[55:05] amen
[55:06] to a full placing
[55:09] okay
[55:10] now god will become so manifested in
[55:13] into his bride his church till they will
[55:16] both be the
[55:18] same they are one
[55:22] now you see where we're at
[55:26] they are one he said now you see where
[55:28] we're at
[55:32] now it's got to come right straight back
[55:34] to that original ministry brother brown
[55:37] said the ministry of the groom and the
[55:39] ministry of the bride
[55:42] is the same
[55:46] amen got to become to the same ministry
[55:51] it's the same word it's the same spirit
[55:53] it's the same life
[55:56] it's the same person
[55:58] just in another form
[56:02] and we'll get to that in just a moment
[56:04] if he said now it's got to come right
[56:06] straight back to that original ministry
[56:08] that he had on that he had on earth
[56:11] watch what he said because it's the
[56:13] bride
[56:16] it's got to come back to the original
[56:17] ministry that he had on earth because
[56:19] it's the bride
[56:21] they are one
[56:25] see we're
[56:27] we're not wanting to feed you milk
[56:31] i don't believe the message of the hour
[56:32] is feeding milk
[56:33] it's needful that's fine
[56:36] but we ought to be we ought to be
[56:38] maturing here
[56:41] we keep have to
[56:43] have you something you can go forward
[56:45] towards
[56:47] amen all right
[56:49] now
[56:51] he said i wonder he said they are one
[56:54] because it's the bride they are one i
[56:56] wonder he said if we are sufficiently
[56:59] impressed with the word in our midst
[57:04] he said i wonder if we are sufficiently
[57:07] impressed
[57:08] with the word in our midst let me give
[57:10] you a thought here
[57:12] so i'm going to give you a thought to
[57:14] think on how do we pray
[57:16] now remember he is the word
[57:19] he's in our midst where is he
[57:22] in the bride
[57:24] revealing himself in the church
[57:27] he said i wonder if we're sufficiently
[57:28] impressed with the word
[57:30] in our midst let me give you a thought
[57:33] how do we pray we pray in jesus name
[57:36] don't we
[57:38] then he has to be here
[57:43] he's here if you pray in jesus name
[57:45] you're not praying in the was i was
[57:48] you're praying in the i am you're
[57:49] praying in the present tense you're
[57:51] referring to the person that's unveiled
[57:53] in you
[57:54] and when you ask in his name the prophet
[57:56] said it's him asking through you
[58:01] amen it's not another person it's him
[58:03] asking through you it's not your thought
[58:06] you don't pray in his name it's his name
[58:08] asking for the very thing that his word
[58:10] promised
[58:11] and you speak it in his name
[58:14] what is that it's his word
[58:17] in our midst
[58:22] he said he said we pray in jesus name
[58:24] don't be every prayer
[58:26] is in his name or there isn't any answer
[58:34] now
[58:37] matthew 6 22 as i said if your eye be
[58:40] single
[58:41] you can't separate god and the word
[58:45] they are
[58:46] one
[58:50] so this i that is single has a focus on
[58:53] one thing the eternal not the temporal
[58:57] while we look not at the things which
[58:59] are seen because if you judge yourself
[59:01] by the things that are seen those things
[59:03] are temporal
[59:05] you can't judge yourself by your
[59:06] mistakes and your failures if you're a
[59:08] believer if you're a christian you don't
[59:10] judge yourself because god will not
[59:12] judge yourself by what you see your
[59:14] mistakes your failures your reasoning
[59:16] your feeling he won't judge you by that
[59:18] he does not judge you by the
[59:21] way of the flesh no more
[59:25] that was under law
[59:28] you're above the law
[59:31] christ fulfilled the law
[59:34] you're not under law you're under grace
[59:38] the god that's in you keeps you
[59:40] that's all the god that's in you fulfill
[59:42] the law
[59:44] you're free
[59:46] you have liberty where the spirit of the
[59:48] lord is there's liberty of the law from
[59:50] the law
[59:51] hallelujah
[59:52] amen
[59:55] that's right
[59:57] that's right you can't you well i won't
[1:00:00] go any further than that i think here's
[1:00:02] that you can't separate god and the word
[1:00:04] they are one
[1:00:06] if your eye be single your body's full
[1:00:08] of light if the light of of your of your
[1:00:11] body is the eye if that eye be single
[1:00:15] then your body's full of light turn me
[1:00:17] to romans 8.
[1:00:21] let's look at verse 14 starting with
[1:00:23] verse 14.
[1:00:25] romans 8
[1:00:26] 14. so your focus is not on the temporal
[1:00:30] while we look not at the things which
[1:00:31] are seen but the things which are not
[1:00:33] seen for the things which are seen are
[1:00:35] temporal that's first that's second
[1:00:37] corinthians 4 18.
[1:00:39] all right i want to go to romans 8. for
[1:00:42] as many as are led by the spirit of god
[1:00:44] hallelujah
[1:00:46] how are you being what is being what are
[1:00:47] you being led by
[1:00:49] by god
[1:00:51] which is
[1:00:54] love
[1:00:58] okay that's love
[1:01:00] you can't go that is the height of love
[1:01:02] you
[1:01:03] god's own love it's god's own love that
[1:01:06] he placed in his own that in his seed
[1:01:08] where is love of god in his seed
[1:01:12] and that love that seed be quickened
[1:01:13] then god is quickened and brought alive
[1:01:15] in you which is the word living
[1:01:20] amen
[1:01:22] all right my subject is herein
[1:01:24] is love
[1:01:26] all right so
[1:01:30] so you you focus on the single on the
[1:01:34] one
[1:01:35] not the double
[1:01:37] because if it's evil you're going to
[1:01:39] focus on everything that's temporal
[1:01:40] you're going to focus on everything
[1:01:41] that's sensual you're going to focus on
[1:01:43] all kinds of your feeding will be on
[1:01:45] those kind of things
[1:01:47] now
[1:01:55] i'll just go further romans 8 14.
[1:01:59] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:02:01] god they are the sons of god they are
[1:02:05] sons what manner of love and god bespoke
[1:02:08] upon us that we should be called the
[1:02:10] sons of god for now we are sons of god
[1:02:13] what makes the sons of god many is are
[1:02:15] led by the spirit
[1:02:18] of god where's that leadership it from
[1:02:21] is it an outside leadership it's not an
[1:02:23] outside teacher
[1:02:24] where is it it's in you
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:29] it's in the body where did i say he
[1:02:31] placed his name where is he he's in his
[1:02:34] church
[1:02:37] where is he being worshiped in his
[1:02:38] church
[1:02:42] amen you in christ
[1:02:44] where what is his church jesus christ
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:52] we're not divided god and his word are
[1:02:54] one god and his word
[1:02:59] let me drop a little and if you be that
[1:03:01] word
[1:03:04] all right
[1:03:05] romans 8 14 and now verse 15. for you
[1:03:08] have not received the spirit i'm going
[1:03:09] to come into this further
[1:03:12] part 4 for you have not received the
[1:03:14] spirit of bondage again to fear
[1:03:18] you have not received the spirit of
[1:03:21] bondage
[1:03:23] again to fear
[1:03:24] but you have received the spirit of
[1:03:29] adoption
[1:03:32] now we could start right at the
[1:03:33] foundation of the new birth and build
[1:03:36] from faith all the way to the capstone
[1:03:38] here
[1:03:41] what is the capstone well it's adoption
[1:03:45] placing
[1:03:46] not you've already been you're already
[1:03:48] born the son you already received the
[1:03:50] seal of the holy ghost
[1:03:53] you're already born again
[1:03:55] you're already a son
[1:03:58] but you grow into him into who it's
[1:04:01] himself growing in you it's that word
[1:04:03] growing
[1:04:04] you start of an infant you grow to
[1:04:06] maturity the maturity the perfecting of
[1:04:09] that body
[1:04:11] is himself
[1:04:14] now you can see what the capstone is all
[1:04:16] right i'll just i'll just let that go
[1:04:18] because that's coming up more
[1:04:20] all right now
[1:04:22] so verse 16 again you have received the
[1:04:25] spirit of adoption so you don't have to
[1:04:26] worry about whether you're going to get
[1:04:28] adopted or not because you've already
[1:04:29] received the spirit of it
[1:04:31] hello
[1:04:33] praise the lord
[1:04:34] okay
[1:04:35] you've already received the spirit of
[1:04:37] adoption whereby we cry abba father are
[1:04:39] you going to reach the milestone are you
[1:04:41] going to go up to the full positioning
[1:04:43] of the head and the body as one unit
[1:04:45] certainly you are because you've
[1:04:46] received the spirit of adoption
[1:04:49] glory to god
[1:04:51] brother branham said you know you aren't
[1:04:53] born again then subsequent to that
[1:04:54] receive another holy spirit
[1:04:58] he said the new birth is the holy ghost
[1:05:00] baptism
[1:05:04] that starts it out
[1:05:07] you have to start
[1:05:08] infants
[1:05:09] to grow
[1:05:11] but you're still the word you are the
[1:05:12] son and you must come to perfection and
[1:05:14] god will see to it i don't care if he
[1:05:16] has to take you through a knot hole
[1:05:18] he'll get you there
[1:05:21] because you're already born his son amen
[1:05:26] amen
[1:05:28] now if you don't you just go back and
[1:05:29] listen to what the prophet said take
[1:05:31] what all he said you'll find out he said
[1:05:32] you're already noticed he said you're
[1:05:34] already his son
[1:05:37] he's got to bring you to that place
[1:05:39] what is it is it this growing no it's
[1:05:41] not to do with this growing is christ in
[1:05:44] me growing to a full stature
[1:05:50] to
[1:05:50] a perfect or a maturity now i'm going
[1:05:54] beyond myself now i don't want to go any
[1:05:56] further
[1:05:57] okay
[1:05:58] verse 16 the spirit itself now watch
[1:06:01] this you've received the spirit of
[1:06:02] adoption watch what the spirit does in
[1:06:04] you the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:06:08] with your spirit now if we go back to
[1:06:10] ezekiel you had to receive a new spirit
[1:06:15] because your old spirit wouldn't agree
[1:06:17] with god
[1:06:18] it had to be sanctified it had to be
[1:06:20] brought under submission and obedience
[1:06:22] to the word so he had to give you a new
[1:06:24] spirit to get along with him
[1:06:27] remember brother brown said to get along
[1:06:28] with him you had to have a new spirit
[1:06:31] all right because that spirit is the
[1:06:33] channel that's your heart it's a channel
[1:06:35] it's governed by imagination memory
[1:06:37] conscience reasoning affection it's a
[1:06:39] channel to either let in or let out
[1:06:42] and god uses that channel to get out to
[1:06:46] get out through your body
[1:06:48] because the soul whatever's in the soul
[1:06:50] will control the spirit and whatever's
[1:06:52] in the spirit will control the body
[1:06:54] however the spirit is controlled it will
[1:06:57] control your body
[1:07:01] amen it brings it either subject to the
[1:07:04] word or takes you away from the word if
[1:07:06] you see yourself i'm not talking about
[1:07:08] sinless perfection of the body i'm
[1:07:10] talking about the control of it you make
[1:07:12] a mistake who corrects you
[1:07:14] who says father i'm sorry i didn't mean
[1:07:17] to do that
[1:07:18] brother branham said you do that and
[1:07:19] know you were convicted he said that
[1:07:21] shows the holy ghost in you
[1:07:26] that's right and so he said now just
[1:07:28] relax he said if you do anything if
[1:07:31] you're born again and the holy ghost
[1:07:32] what is the new birth the holy ghost
[1:07:34] coming in you revel revealing himself in
[1:07:36] you
[1:07:37] you are therefore by that spirit he
[1:07:40] doesn't put the spirit in and take it
[1:07:41] away you are birthed you are absolutely
[1:07:44] sealed to the day of your redemption
[1:07:47] by that spirit
[1:07:51] but you've got to grow
[1:07:53] and you grow up into him
[1:07:56] faith has to be perfected
[1:07:59] amen matured
[1:08:02] love is matured
[1:08:04] love grows
[1:08:05] grows into what what's it going to grow
[1:08:06] into his very stature
[1:08:12] it's the stature of a perfect man well
[1:08:13] david is not a perfect man
[1:08:18] oh that was a revelation wasn't it
[1:08:22] you are not a perfect man
[1:08:25] but the one that's growing is
[1:08:30] hallelujah
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:32] all right the further abraham got the
[1:08:35] more perfect his faith was
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:45] all right now
[1:08:46] i've got to quit going out so far here
[1:08:48] and this it will help me
[1:08:50] verse 16 and the spirit itself beareth
[1:08:52] witness with our spirit
[1:08:55] so god giving you a new spirit that will
[1:08:57] bear witness that he can bear witness
[1:08:59] with your spirit testify give witness
[1:09:04] through you through your spirit
[1:09:08] that's how it's got to come through that
[1:09:10] channel
[1:09:12] that's why it's important that we give
[1:09:13] the word a right mental attitude
[1:09:18] bring it under obedience to the word
[1:09:19] paul said bring it under obedience bring
[1:09:22] it subject to the word that's a right
[1:09:24] mental attitude because an attitude is a
[1:09:26] placing or a positioning
[1:09:29] a right mental attitude be a right
[1:09:31] mental positioning to what
[1:09:33] to whatever you believe
[1:09:37] amen is that right but in our case it's
[1:09:39] a right mental position
[1:09:42] all right i'm not going to go into that
[1:09:43] because that's another message
[1:09:46] all right
[1:09:47] now
[1:09:48] so he bears witness with our spirit that
[1:09:51] we are the children of god
[1:09:55] so what's doing it the holy spirit is
[1:09:57] bearing fruit
[1:09:59] that we are the children of god bringing
[1:10:01] forth his own life through you and when
[1:10:04] you see that spirit in use bringing you
[1:10:06] subject to the word
[1:10:08] that's the holy spirit
[1:10:14] okay first john 4.
[1:10:16] let's go back over here and read some of
[1:10:18] these things that we
[1:10:20] have been reading
[1:10:23] and i want to begin reading here with
[1:10:25] verse 2 this time
[1:10:27] saint john or stop excuse me not saint
[1:10:29] john i say first john or first john
[1:10:32] first john 4 2.
[1:10:37] now it says in one believe but beloved
[1:10:39] that's us beloved well loved beloved
[1:10:42] believe not every spirit
[1:10:44] but try the spirits whether they are of
[1:10:46] god because many false prophets
[1:10:50] are gone out into the world now watch
[1:10:52] what he says hereby know ye
[1:10:55] the spirit of god if you try the spirit
[1:10:57] hereby know we the spirit of god every
[1:11:00] spirit that confesseth
[1:11:02] watch how he bears witness with your
[1:11:04] spirit every spirit that confesseth that
[1:11:07] jesus christ
[1:11:09] comes in the flesh
[1:11:11] is of god
[1:11:13] so it's so the holy ghost has got to
[1:11:15] bear witness with your spirit that he's
[1:11:17] made flesh in you
[1:11:21] why how because you're going to bear his
[1:11:23] life
[1:11:24] through your body
[1:11:28] amen it's not an inaction the holy ghost
[1:11:31] is action
[1:11:33] all right now
[1:11:36] and every spirit that confesseth not
[1:11:42] that jesus christ is come
[1:11:44] in the flesh i just read it to you right
[1:11:47] here today he's standing among us where
[1:11:49] in the flesh
[1:11:52] again
[1:11:55] in the person of the holy ghost all
[1:11:56] right now so he said and every spirit
[1:12:00] that confesseth not that jesus christ is
[1:12:02] come in the flesh is not of god and this
[1:12:06] is that spirit of antichrist
[1:12:10] to be an antichrist all you have to do
[1:12:11] is just leave one little
[1:12:13] portion of the word out and say it's not
[1:12:15] so for today and not be able to
[1:12:18] live that word
[1:12:20] you can shout you may dance you may do
[1:12:22] all these things anointed by the genuine
[1:12:24] holy ghost
[1:12:26] and still
[1:12:27] not have that typos or that ultimate in
[1:12:30] that soul
[1:12:33] because this is where it comes from it
[1:12:35] comes out of the soul
[1:12:37] to the spirit and the spirit
[1:12:39] gives way to that
[1:12:41] because he said bring every thought
[1:12:42] under obedience who's bringing that
[1:12:44] thought is david bringing that thought
[1:12:46] no the holy ghost in me who i am is
[1:12:49] bringing every thought under obedience
[1:12:51] to that word
[1:12:53] i'm bringing my spirit that's the
[1:12:54] thought that's the mind you don't think
[1:12:56] with your body you think with your
[1:12:58] spirit
[1:12:59] so every spirit that won't confess that
[1:13:01] jesus christ has come in the flesh it's
[1:13:03] not living that life
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:06] bearing the wrong fruit saying i'm a
[1:13:08] believer i'm a believer but never coming
[1:13:10] to the true revelation individually that
[1:13:13] they are a believer
[1:13:16] the only one person that can bring you
[1:13:18] to that revelation that you are a
[1:13:19] believer that's the holy ghost dwelling
[1:13:21] in you and you had to be his seed in
[1:13:24] order to be that true believer
[1:13:26] you say well what what is a true
[1:13:28] believer what is a worshiper true
[1:13:30] worshiper jesus said they that worship
[1:13:32] me must worship me in spirit and in
[1:13:35] truth
[1:13:36] all right then a true worshiper is both
[1:13:40] both mechanics
[1:13:43] which you were a part of before the
[1:13:45] foundation of the world
[1:13:46] the word
[1:13:49] and the word is the is the mechanic you
[1:13:51] can have you can have your you can have
[1:13:53] your mechanics all in line you can even
[1:13:55] be filled up with gasoline which
[1:13:56] represents the word and the octane is in
[1:13:59] it
[1:14:01] but unless the holy spirit that wrote
[1:14:03] the word unless the holy spirit that
[1:14:05] gave the word unless the holy spirit
[1:14:07] comes in you and sparks that gasoline
[1:14:12] you cannot be a true worshiper
[1:14:18] you are a religious person you can mark
[1:14:21] religion you can act the message but
[1:14:23] you'll never come to the true revelation
[1:14:27] listen to what we said about revelation
[1:14:29] i'm going to come to that just a minute
[1:14:30] lord helping me he said you'll never
[1:14:33] come to that true revelation without
[1:14:35] coming into a new birth first because
[1:14:37] you cannot call jesus the christ or
[1:14:40] jesus the lord without the genuine
[1:14:43] revelation of himself being in you
[1:14:46] because you don't know it
[1:14:50] you don't know that he is
[1:14:53] you have no revelation that he is you're
[1:14:55] hoping that he is you're hoping you've
[1:14:57] come through the blood instead of having
[1:14:59] i'll come to that in a minute so let me
[1:15:01] stop right there and and let's go on
[1:15:03] further because i've got something here
[1:15:05] i want to get to
[1:15:06] now
[1:15:08] so he said here he said
[1:15:11] it's spirit of antichrist where have you
[1:15:13] heard it should come into
[1:15:15] even now which is it should come and
[1:15:18] even now already is it in the world
[1:15:20] how is it in the world
[1:15:22] it's in flesh also
[1:15:26] all right
[1:15:27] you are but watch what he said you are
[1:15:30] but you are of god
[1:15:34] little children little elect seed my
[1:15:36] offspring
[1:15:39] and have overcome them who's them
[1:15:42] antichrist spirit
[1:15:45] deception denominational spirit whatever
[1:15:47] you want to call it outside of the word
[1:15:49] of promise for this hour all right he
[1:15:52] said you have overcome them because
[1:15:55] greater is he that he is eternal life
[1:15:58] that he is god in you that he is love
[1:16:01] which can never fail that he
[1:16:03] is a
[1:16:04] person
[1:16:06] it's greater is he that is in you than
[1:16:09] he
[1:16:10] that is in the world so he that is in
[1:16:12] you is single that your eye is focused
[1:16:15] on that
[1:16:18] jesus said told those pharisees and all
[1:16:20] the rest of sadducees you're judging
[1:16:22] after the flesh
[1:16:25] you judge me after the flesh he said i
[1:16:28] judge no man.
[1:16:31] saint john 8
[1:16:33] 15 he said i do not judge a man after
[1:16:36] the flesh
[1:16:38] paul said i don't know any man after the
[1:16:40] flesh
[1:16:41] hallelujah that ought to take care of it
[1:16:44] so what's in you that is that god is
[1:16:47] looking at and
[1:16:48] realizing and judging you by
[1:16:53] how did he love jacob when jacob hadn't
[1:16:55] done anything so he couldn't judge him
[1:16:57] by his works or the lack of it
[1:17:01] he had to judge him because the seed was
[1:17:03] in jacob
[1:17:04] god planted that seed in jacob
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:10] he loved jacob
[1:17:12] and jacob went on to have that wrestling
[1:17:15] match with god and come out a limping
[1:17:17] prince but he was changed
[1:17:20] and he had no more fear of he saw his
[1:17:22] brother
[1:17:24] coming with a
[1:17:25] multi-faceted army he didn't care what
[1:17:27] he come by he had met god and when you
[1:17:30] meet love and when you meet god he's
[1:17:33] therein in you and what do you have to
[1:17:35] fear
[1:17:41] amen
[1:17:42] he's in our midst he's in you
[1:17:46] he's coming right back to the original
[1:17:47] word you are the original word you are
[1:17:49] that original word
[1:17:52] that's what we heard today in the
[1:17:54] message of the hour was the original
[1:17:55] word
[1:17:58] the original life the original seed
[1:18:01] amen
[1:18:02] but has been sealed up and hid in the
[1:18:04] word and being hid in the word
[1:18:06] it had to be unhid
[1:18:08] you couldn't get it until it was
[1:18:10] released
[1:18:11] but it was released you came to it
[1:18:13] because your name that mystery was your
[1:18:16] name is who you are was revealed in that
[1:18:19] book
[1:18:21] hallelujah
[1:18:23] hallelujah when that mystery is revealed
[1:18:25] in you which the headstone was in the
[1:18:27] pyramid and the pyramid is the bride
[1:18:30] and it was sealed in there but it had
[1:18:32] the cap the seal the seventh seal the
[1:18:34] capstone had to be removed
[1:18:38] amen and looked inside and there's white
[1:18:40] stone what is white stone elected
[1:18:45] you also are lively stones
[1:18:49] you also
[1:18:50] are the elect
[1:18:52] amen we could go back into first peter
[1:18:54] or second peter 2 or 1st peter 2.
[1:18:58] and you would find that out it's the
[1:18:59] stone of stumbling to many it's a rock
[1:19:01] of offense but to you it's life
[1:19:05] because because it was unwritten word
[1:19:08] and what was and he said i had to go
[1:19:10] west to get the revelation of that
[1:19:12] unwritten word on that stone
[1:19:15] it was a secret there's your seventh
[1:19:17] seal it was a mystery
[1:19:22] but it's revealed
[1:19:24] it's been open but who's it open to
[1:19:28] it's only opened to her brother brahm
[1:19:30] said only she i preached on it here not
[1:19:32] too long ago only she could receive it
[1:19:36] it's only known to her her
[1:19:38] only
[1:19:41] all right so where is this bride it
[1:19:43] doesn't matter where it is and how many
[1:19:45] there is and how many there isn't are
[1:19:47] you one of them
[1:19:49] the only way you can know is god to
[1:19:51] vindicate that so to you in your life
[1:19:54] in you
[1:19:55] and when he does so you're identified to
[1:19:57] be his seed and if you're his seed there
[1:20:00] is absolutely no way you can pass away
[1:20:03] you you pass from death and to life the
[1:20:06] resurrection was great when jesus raised
[1:20:08] but how much yeah but if that was a
[1:20:10] great resurrection what about this one
[1:20:14] because you raised with him
[1:20:16] and you're identified that you raised
[1:20:17] with him what a resurrection that was
[1:20:20] but the prophet said what a resurrection
[1:20:22] this is
[1:20:25] yes
[1:20:26] because now you know you were identified
[1:20:28] in that resurrection you defeated death
[1:20:29] hell in the grave
[1:20:31] yourself i can just defeat it you've
[1:20:32] done defeated it
[1:20:35] there's no turning back from that
[1:20:38] amen amen
[1:20:40] what are we doing we're we're
[1:20:41] stabilizing we're positioning the bride
[1:20:44] here
[1:20:47] right
[1:20:48] now
[1:20:49] so we go on here now i may not read all
[1:20:51] this because i don't have time but we've
[1:20:53] read first john you can go and read it
[1:20:55] some more because god is love he that
[1:20:57] has the love of god he that's got the
[1:20:59] spirit of god is in love and perfect
[1:21:02] love casts out fear and we have in the
[1:21:04] day of judgment that we're in now herein
[1:21:06] is our love made perfect that we may
[1:21:08] have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:21:10] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:21:13] how's he going to judge us when he's
[1:21:14] already took our judgment
[1:21:16] he's already been judged perfect you are
[1:21:18] accepted you are received you are
[1:21:21] accepted in the beloved and his spirit
[1:21:24] in you identifies that you are in love
[1:21:28] you came from love you came from the
[1:21:29] source of love you came from the same
[1:21:31] source he came from
[1:21:34] amen our lord came jesus came from the
[1:21:37] same source he came from you came from
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:42] so it's christ in you
[1:21:44] the hope of glory
[1:21:46] what is the hope of glory
[1:21:48] substance
[1:21:49] christ in you is the substance
[1:21:51] of things hoped for
[1:21:54] it's already given to you when christ
[1:21:55] comes in you everything he purchased for
[1:21:57] you calvary is yours you just have to go
[1:22:00] lay claim on it because he's already
[1:22:02] laid claim on you
[1:22:04] and said look i've already redeemed you
[1:22:06] i've given you my spirit i've laid claim
[1:22:09] on you and that settles it
[1:22:12] amen
[1:22:13] well if i just would have this up or
[1:22:15] down forget your up and down
[1:22:17] all is well
[1:22:18] when you're in christ all is well let
[1:22:20] him lead you then let go and let him
[1:22:22] lead you
[1:22:23] take him at his word when you take him
[1:22:25] at his word you crucify yourself
[1:22:28] self man's self you recursively hide the
[1:22:31] humanness
[1:22:32] you crucify you take up your cross you
[1:22:34] follow the word if your reasoning and
[1:22:36] your feelings speak contrary to the word
[1:22:38] you deny your reasoning and feelings and
[1:22:40] follow the word
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:45] amen all right now
[1:22:47] so
[1:22:49] so i'll just i'll bypass some of that
[1:22:52] hebrews 4 12 let's go over there real
[1:22:54] quick you know we're very familiar with
[1:22:55] that scripture but i want to read it
[1:22:57] here because i want you to see it and i
[1:22:59] know you've seen it before but these
[1:23:01] things are pointed out time and time and
[1:23:03] time again why because god knows when it
[1:23:06] could be quickened
[1:23:08] it's got to go from the intellect into
[1:23:11] the revelation in your soul when it's
[1:23:13] revealed in your soul now it's substance
[1:23:18] amen it's just not something you say
[1:23:20] well i'll just try and see if it works
[1:23:23] no when it becomes substance nothing can
[1:23:25] take it out of you you've got it already
[1:23:27] you've got it just as certain as
[1:23:28] anything you'll see the manifestation of
[1:23:31] it then
[1:23:32] you have to just like a body change i've
[1:23:34] already got my body changed he said
[1:23:36] brother david now how how dare you speak
[1:23:38] that i've already done got it how do i
[1:23:40] got it substance
[1:23:42] faith
[1:23:43] it's already in that seed it's already
[1:23:46] in him my whole journey everything i
[1:23:48] need for this journey is in me including
[1:23:50] the rapture how many know the prophet
[1:23:52] said that he said everything you need in
[1:23:54] this journey when you have the holy
[1:23:56] ghost is already in you everything you
[1:23:58] need to have is already
[1:24:00] there it's given to you in your season
[1:24:03] in your time as he desires to give it to
[1:24:06] you
[1:24:08] amen and you rest in that leadership of
[1:24:11] eternal life you rest in that leadership
[1:24:14] of god brother branham said in the last
[1:24:16] message he preached outside of communion
[1:24:18] he said it's the leadership of eternal
[1:24:20] life
[1:24:22] leadership he preached on leadership
[1:24:25] oh my what a message all right
[1:24:28] all right now
[1:24:31] so we see then he says for the word of
[1:24:33] god
[1:24:35] for the word of god is quick and
[1:24:37] powerful that's why the prophet said
[1:24:39] though that
[1:24:40] that this bride would be the word
[1:24:42] living for the word of god is quick and
[1:24:45] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:24:47] sword piercing even to the dividing of
[1:24:49] sunder of who you are and who you're not
[1:24:53] and of the joints and marrow
[1:24:55] and as a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:24:57] intents of the heart because whatever
[1:24:59] youth in your soul is who you are
[1:25:02] you can have all the emotions of the
[1:25:04] spirit you want you can even be a
[1:25:06] believer even love god by your spirit
[1:25:08] but if that word doesn't abide in your
[1:25:11] soul and quicken in your soul you don't
[1:25:13] know him
[1:25:14] but it had to be placed there did it
[1:25:16] wasn't you that place it there or if i
[1:25:18] could just get it if i could get it no
[1:25:19] it's what you are doing with the word
[1:25:21] now
[1:25:24] because faith that pleases god faith in
[1:25:27] you who is the real believer
[1:25:29] because remember
[1:25:31] dynamics with mechanics is true worship
[1:25:34] yes
[1:25:36] amen that's true worship
[1:25:39] no other way of true worship it's spirit
[1:25:41] and truth together
[1:25:43] that's what jesus christ is that's what
[1:25:46] he was that's what he is today
[1:25:50] is the dynamic and the attic together
[1:25:53] until the bride gets to that place
[1:25:55] dynamics alone no good he said mechanics
[1:25:57] alone no good they've got to come
[1:25:58] together to bring that car down that
[1:26:00] road and bring it into a body change or
[1:26:03] bring your body there see you can't do
[1:26:06] it in yourself
[1:26:10] amen you cannot do it in your own self
[1:26:14] you can try everything you want you can
[1:26:16] have every picture you want on the wall
[1:26:18] you can bring you can you can dress ever
[1:26:20] so right and everything and i have
[1:26:22] nothing to say about that thank god for
[1:26:24] that
[1:26:24] but
[1:26:26] to be in the bride
[1:26:28] you have to be united with him as one
[1:26:34] that's what we're after is that bride
[1:26:36] because that's who's taking the rapture
[1:26:39] that's who's going in the in the rapture
[1:26:42] amen i don't know who that is i just
[1:26:44] believe i am and how do i know i am by
[1:26:46] revelation
[1:26:49] amen
[1:26:50] because that is a substance in me i've
[1:26:52] already entered my rapture i've already
[1:26:55] been raptured how can the body not be
[1:26:57] when i've already am
[1:27:01] oh brother david i wish you'd stop
[1:27:03] talking some riddles it's not riddles
[1:27:05] it's truth
[1:27:08] it's just spiritual that's all
[1:27:10] that's why it's a new tongue it's not an
[1:27:12] untongue it's a new tongue
[1:27:16] it's speaking the new tongue
[1:27:18] that's what they did in the day of
[1:27:19] pentecost they were announcing and
[1:27:21] testifying of the word of promise for
[1:27:23] that hour they had received it and 3000
[1:27:25] heard them in their own language
[1:27:28] what an
[1:27:30] unknown it was known to those believers
[1:27:33] because 3 000 were added to the church
[1:27:38] hallelujah we're back right back to that
[1:27:41] same pentecostal life
[1:27:43] not pentecostal religion not pentecostal
[1:27:46] shuck we're back to the original life
[1:27:49] the original faith
[1:27:52] whose faith god's own faith
[1:27:54] all right my time is slipping
[1:27:57] now
[1:27:58] watch this now i'm bypassing some of
[1:28:00] this you okay now
[1:28:05] the husband of life are okay
[1:28:07] the same spirit that was in christ is in
[1:28:09] his bride in his body that unites them
[1:28:12] together
[1:28:13] with all the word god living there
[1:28:15] himself manifesting it
[1:28:18] now now i don't have to go into this is
[1:28:20] god materializing himself the whole the
[1:28:22] whole mystery the whole manifestation of
[1:28:25] god the whole revelation of the bible is
[1:28:27] god becoming material
[1:28:31] god becoming substance god becoming
[1:28:33] material tangible could be felt could be
[1:28:36] shook hands with i could wash the feet
[1:28:37] of it
[1:28:39] of him
[1:28:40] he'd become tangible it's become flesh
[1:28:43] that god not another that god all right
[1:28:46] i'm going to bypass some of this i've
[1:28:48] already preached it god help me to
[1:28:50] realize what i preached i'm going to go
[1:28:51] back over it again all right now that
[1:28:53] makes you then his subjects that makes
[1:28:56] you his eternal subjects
[1:28:59] amen because you were in the thinking of
[1:29:01] himself you were his thoughts you were
[1:29:05] his
[1:29:06] thoughts
[1:29:08] and you imagine that so other words you
[1:29:10] were god to be from the eternities
[1:29:14] you never started either
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:20] you say well god didn't start he didn't
[1:29:22] he has no beginning and there's no end
[1:29:24] neither are you i'm talking about his
[1:29:26] thoughts
[1:29:29] that right
[1:29:30] his thoughts
[1:29:34] that ought to settle it for you
[1:29:36] you get desperate enough and want to
[1:29:37] meet him he'll meet you
[1:29:39] you draw a night to him every day he'll
[1:29:41] draw an eye to you
[1:29:42] it depends on what you want to feed on
[1:29:45] what you're giving yourself the
[1:29:46] influence to see
[1:29:48] if our thoughts were more on him he'd
[1:29:50] appear more often when you're thinking
[1:29:52] on him
[1:29:56] well i'm sorry brother david i don't
[1:29:57] have enough time to think on him you
[1:29:58] don't have enough time to go home either
[1:30:01] so so you might as well just
[1:30:04] take your choice
[1:30:07] everybody in here is old enough to
[1:30:09] receive what i'm saying
[1:30:11] it's not a matter of how old you are
[1:30:13] it's a matter of god reveals it or not
[1:30:18] amen quickens it
[1:30:20] you know that as well as i do
[1:30:23] it's something in you you didn't put
[1:30:24] there says i need more of him
[1:30:28] i've got to have him or perish i've got
[1:30:30] to have that birthright or perish
[1:30:36] okay
[1:30:38] we should get to that place
[1:30:41] and many of them just hold on they don't
[1:30:43] we know what's the problem they don't
[1:30:44] want to die
[1:30:46] you've got to die to resurrect you've
[1:30:48] got to die to yourself you've got to
[1:30:49] give up yourself you've got to give up
[1:30:51] your habits you've got to give
[1:30:52] everything over to god
[1:30:57] die
[1:30:58] in order to be born again you have to
[1:30:59] die because a new birth is a union a new
[1:31:02] birth is a resurrection
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:08] and then you go on and die daily
[1:31:10] because this old boy will want to raise
[1:31:12] up but he that is in you the keeping
[1:31:14] power the typos will hold you and you've
[1:31:17] got to have confidence in that hold
[1:31:19] and you will if you're elected
[1:31:23] amen because it'll constantly bring you
[1:31:24] back to that bring you back to that
[1:31:26] because god is directing it god is
[1:31:28] leading it and when you're born again if
[1:31:30] there's any little thing the prophet
[1:31:31] said you do that's not right he said he
[1:31:33] will show you
[1:31:38] so you are the manifestation you are
[1:31:40] right now today the manifestation
[1:31:43] of his thinking
[1:31:45] you were in christ in the beginning amen
[1:31:48] you anything eternal never began to not
[1:31:51] end that's why i'm saying you were
[1:31:52] eternal to begin with
[1:31:54] amen you just stepped into a body of
[1:31:56] time but you're realizing this isn't me
[1:31:59] that
[1:32:00] thought
[1:32:01] that word expressed that seed has been
[1:32:04] quickened
[1:32:06] amen who am i himself
[1:32:11] amen
[1:32:12] amen
[1:32:13] what they want to kill jesus for him
[1:32:15] being a man makes himself god
[1:32:21] he said you judge after the flesh
[1:32:25] you don't see me rich i don't have any
[1:32:26] beauty you desire you're judging after
[1:32:28] the flesh can't be of us he can't be of
[1:32:30] us he's not in our denomination he's not
[1:32:33] with our group
[1:32:36] you're judging after the outward
[1:32:38] appearance of things i don't judge that
[1:32:40] i don't judge a man after that i'm not
[1:32:42] i'm not judging you by way of the flesh
[1:32:46] amen
[1:32:48] do you believe that
[1:32:50] rest in that all right now
[1:32:52] now
[1:32:55] the seed planted you has been quickened
[1:32:57] by the baptismal holy ghost you are born
[1:32:59] again recognize that you are his
[1:33:01] attributes if you've got eternal life
[1:33:03] your life always was
[1:33:07] amen now first john 3 18
[1:33:10] let's just now we can bypass you can
[1:33:12] read first john 1 1 through 2 when you
[1:33:15] get home
[1:33:16] those saying we've talked we've touched
[1:33:18] him we've handled him the word of life
[1:33:20] and now because he's in us we see him
[1:33:22] we're testifying of him that you too may
[1:33:25] have the fellowship we have with him
[1:33:27] that's what first john 1 1 and 2 reads

[1:33:43] things here but i'll wait and take a
[1:33:45] part 3

[1:33:56] four
[1:33:59] and
[1:34:03] my little children
[1:34:04] let us not love in word
[1:34:06] neither in tongue
[1:34:08] but in deed
[1:34:10] and in truth
[1:34:13] all right
[1:34:14] little children let us not love and
[1:34:16] tongue neither in deed but in truth
[1:34:22] and
[1:34:22] hereby we know
[1:34:25] that we are
[1:34:27] of the truth and shall assure our hearts
[1:34:30] before him because there's only one that
[1:34:32] can live that
[1:34:33] and that's he and you
[1:34:35] all right
[1:34:37] now
[1:34:39] i want to share this with you and i'm
[1:34:41] closing
[1:34:52] and then i'll come back
[1:34:59] he that's in you is greater than he
[1:35:00] that's in the world god in you god in
[1:35:03] you like he was in jesus christ
[1:35:08] because what all god was he poured into
[1:35:11] christ
[1:35:13] i pray that you'll get this and all
[1:35:15] christ was
[1:35:17] which is all god was
[1:35:19] so all god was christ was and what all
[1:35:22] christ was he poured into the church
[1:35:29] there's your revelation if you can
[1:35:30] receive it there's the threefold mystery
[1:35:32] of the seventh seal
[1:35:35] all right
[1:35:36] now
[1:35:39] see that's god in you he poured into the
[1:35:42] church see he said that's god in you
[1:35:46] oh well that sure that's god in me no
[1:35:48] that's god in you
[1:35:50] he that's in you
[1:35:52] god above us
[1:35:54] the holy spirit father god with us son
[1:35:58] god in us holy ghost god above us god
[1:36:02] with us god in us
[1:36:06] amen
[1:36:08] what's the what's the capstone of this
[1:36:10] of his creation
[1:36:12] what was the capstone of of the creation
[1:36:14] of god when god brought the mystery that
[1:36:17] was hidden adam out of adam
[1:36:19] in the form of his wife
[1:36:23] amen
[1:36:24] that's right what was the capstone of
[1:36:27] god's full mystery of himself
[1:36:29] ephesians 2
[1:36:31] ephesians 1 22 verse and 23 the church
[1:36:34] is his body
[1:36:36] ephesians 1 23 says and he the body is
[1:36:40] the fullness of himself
[1:36:45] the church is his body
[1:36:48] and verse 23 said and the church is the
[1:36:50] fullness of himself
[1:36:54] that filleth all in all so who's the
[1:36:56] fullness of himself his bride
[1:37:00] it's the full revelation of himself
[1:37:03] don't take that lightly
[1:37:05] that's where we're at
[1:37:06] we have jesus christ today as he
[1:37:09] promised
[1:37:10] before just before the rapture revealing
[1:37:12] the son of man in bright form
[1:37:17] that's what the message is about that's
[1:37:19] the message
[1:37:23] and god's trying to get this love over
[1:37:25] to you that this is love
[1:37:27] this is where he's at
[1:37:31] she can't be anything but his love
[1:37:36] expressed
[1:37:38] she can't be anything but his love
[1:37:40] manifested she cannot be anything but
[1:37:43] his love projected she cannot be
[1:37:45] anything but his love
[1:37:48] living
[1:37:51] all right
[1:37:52] because that's what he is
[1:37:56] now and it never fails
[1:38:02] i'm not throwing a wrench into that
[1:38:04] it never fails
[1:38:07] how you going to fail when you're that
[1:38:13] now you'll feel every day in this
[1:38:15] but you've got to be able to come to the
[1:38:16] fact that this is not the real you
[1:38:19] the real you is the holy spirit in you
[1:38:21] there's where you're identified
[1:38:25] you're not identified in this
[1:38:28] god doesn't even deal with you about
[1:38:30] this
[1:38:31] he uses it it's his instrument he uses
[1:38:33] it he's made flesh he's identified it
[1:38:35] he'll change it
[1:38:37] but where is he what's he doing what's
[1:38:40] who's working that
[1:38:42] nothing to do with your intellects
[1:38:45] nothing to do with your ups and downs
[1:38:46] your failures and mistakes he took all
[1:38:48] that that was under the law
[1:38:50] he condemned you under the law because
[1:38:53] you couldn't keep it
[1:38:56] but he and you will keep the word he'll
[1:38:58] keep his commandment he will keep his
[1:39:00] word
[1:39:02] you don't have to worry about keeping it
[1:39:03] david doesn't have to worry about
[1:39:04] keeping it he'll keep it
[1:39:07] so who's david subject to
[1:39:11] i'm subject to him
[1:39:14] he said he would bring your body under
[1:39:16] obedience to the word
[1:39:18] he will lead you
[1:39:20] he will guide you will he or won't he
[1:39:24] if you either believe that or you
[1:39:25] believe what your feelings are saying
[1:39:30] amen
[1:39:33] hallelujah all right now let me get
[1:39:35] through this i'm i'm done
[1:39:38] god and morphe mask
[1:39:41] in the pillar of fire god above us god
[1:39:44] in morphy in a man called jesus
[1:39:47] in morphy means he's poured himself into
[1:39:49] another mask not another god into
[1:39:51] another form
[1:39:53] all right another actor
[1:39:56] god in morphy in his man in the man
[1:39:59] called jesus god a morphy in his church
[1:40:02] god above us god with us god in us the
[1:40:05] condescending of god he was god in form
[1:40:11] same god in another mask or form not
[1:40:14] another god
[1:40:16] no wonder the winds and waves obeyed him
[1:40:18] what did they obey his words
[1:40:23] all right obeyed his words because it
[1:40:25] was god's word through him
[1:40:27] he was a man but he was the word made
[1:40:30] flesh so it was god's word through him
[1:40:32] what about the bride it's god's word
[1:40:35] through you
[1:40:37] who speaks
[1:40:39] when if you abide in me in my word and
[1:40:41] you ask what you will are we not
[1:40:43] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:40:44] our midst who speaks
[1:40:48] he does
[1:40:52] it's not jew does he does not david it's
[1:40:54] him it comes out of my mouth but it's
[1:40:56] him speaking
[1:40:59] it's either greater is he that is in me
[1:41:01] or isn't
[1:41:06] see there's where you've got to meet him
[1:41:07] there's where you've got to know him
[1:41:10] it's not knowing religion it's not
[1:41:12] knowing a message you have to come in
[1:41:14] relationship and union with this message
[1:41:17] to become this message unless you become
[1:41:19] this message there's no rapture because
[1:41:21] the message is the rapture
[1:41:25] and it's the going home
[1:41:27] of the bride
[1:41:29] and it's who she is
[1:41:31] all right
[1:41:33] now
[1:41:36] god through him he was a man he was word
[1:41:37] made flesh that was god above us god
[1:41:39] with us now it's god in us same god the
[1:41:43] holy spirit not the third person
[1:41:46] the same person
[1:41:48] can we visualize that can we understand
[1:41:51] that that god was in jesus christ and
[1:41:53] god was in him is now in you but he was
[1:41:56] in one man now he's in a mini-member
[1:41:58] body i have a portion you have a portion
[1:42:01] each one has a portion of him you're in
[1:42:04] your position and place he's in his
[1:42:06] position in place
[1:42:10] amen
[1:42:11] all
[1:42:12] right i'll pick up the rest of it later
[1:42:18] it's hard to leave it right now
[1:42:20] but i will let's stand
[1:42:26] i took overtime i took about i wanted to
[1:42:28] go 45 minutes
[1:42:30] that's what i wanted
[1:42:32] but i finally realized lord i have to
[1:42:34] give this to you
[1:42:36] i can't do it
[1:42:37] maybe others can preach it that way but
[1:42:39] i can't i'm not that kind of preacher
[1:42:42] so thank the lord i'm not that kind of
[1:42:44] preacher
[1:42:45] who is the preacher
[1:42:51] you passed the first test
[1:42:56] i'm just joking with you amen
[1:42:58] well
[1:43:00] that's where we ended so we'll come to
[1:43:04] that next time
[1:43:07] then when we're born of him
[1:43:09] i've got to get this part because i read
[1:43:10] first john 3 18. now listen we're
[1:43:13] closing this is it
[1:43:15] then we're born when we're born of him
[1:43:17] we are filled with him
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:21] see your life
[1:43:23] his life
[1:43:24] is in you
[1:43:26] these are quotes now that's not
[1:43:27] something i'm just saying out of the
[1:43:28] blue
[1:43:29] then all our actions should declare him
[1:43:36] so everything we do is motivated by one
[1:43:40] of the two spirits
[1:43:41] what you wear
[1:43:43] what you do every day
[1:43:45] what you feed on let me see what you
[1:43:47] feed on the books you read
[1:43:50] and i'll tell you what's in you
[1:43:55] amen that's exactly right let me see
[1:43:57] what you look at let me see what hangs
[1:43:59] on your walls let me see what you feed
[1:44:01] on
[1:44:01] let me see the mu let me let me hear the
[1:44:04] music you're listening to
[1:44:06] and i'll tell you
[1:44:08] what's in you
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:13] amen
[1:44:14] i'll tell you what's what's moving you
[1:44:16] i'll tell you what's feeding
[1:44:20] because the holy ghost will only draw
[1:44:21] through one filter and feed on the word
[1:44:23] himself
[1:44:25] and you buy that draw life to quicken
[1:44:27] that word in you further it's a
[1:44:29] continual revelation from glory to glory
[1:44:32] the walk of a believer is from
[1:44:34] from light to light light to light
[1:44:38] the light grows greater how does that
[1:44:40] scripture go
[1:44:42] from glory but there's another one
[1:44:45] path of the just is as a shining light
[1:44:48] that grows greater and greater to that
[1:44:50] perfect day
[1:44:52] now if you don't see that in your life
[1:44:54] moving
[1:44:55] living
[1:44:56] something isn't right
[1:45:00] because that's what he said he would do
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:05] amen
[1:45:07] i hope that's plain enough
[1:45:09] all right
[1:45:11] hallelujah
[1:45:13] so
[1:45:16] oh my look bringing his signs of life
[1:45:18] evident of his resurrection proving to
[1:45:20] the world that eternal life
[1:45:21] [Music]
[1:45:24] and think of it alive with god our
[1:45:26] redeemer who created us for the very
[1:45:27] same purpose the church and his creative
[1:45:29] life is in you
[1:45:32] what's his creative life spoken word
[1:45:35] i heard brother neville say this morning
[1:45:36] someone might have asked him why i
[1:45:38] didn't preach on the holy ghost why i
[1:45:39] didn't do this here it is the holy ghost
[1:45:42] is the action in you
[1:45:44] it's a life not an emotion not some sort
[1:45:47] of fleshly evidence but it is a person
[1:45:50] jesus christ the what's god in you it's
[1:45:52] a life not an emotion not some sort of
[1:45:55] fleshly evidence but it is a person
[1:45:57] jesus christ the word of god established
[1:46:00] in your heart to quicken every too quick
[1:46:02] and every word of this age right he said
[1:46:05] right watch the holy ghost in action not
[1:46:08] so much in demonstrations but in action
[1:46:12] what it does according to the word
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] there's the action he's talking about
[1:46:18] then all our action should declare him
[1:46:22] amen do you love him
[1:46:24] amen
[1:46:26] praise the lord
[1:46:29] praise the lord praise the lord
