[41:46] two different opportunities this last
[41:49] week
[41:50] to witness a man named chris
[41:54] a lady named sarah just a time to open
[41:57] doors that
[41:58] you never imagined would be open to be
[42:00] able to
[42:01] step in with a boldness and there be a
[42:04] spirit there that the people just stop
[42:06] no argument no contesting just listening
[42:10] and you know our prayer is see

[42:35] and he's the one that said i'll lead you
[42:37] and guide you to all truth so if we can
[42:39] get them to look to christ then god will

[42:47] convert them or
[42:48] or get them to our way of thinking we
[42:51] want want you to come you need to be a
[42:53] part of
[42:53] my church let's get them to christ

[44:20] he said but i'll be right there with you
[44:23] oh hallelujah
[44:25] look saints well to thank the lord we
[44:28] see across the nations many people
[44:30] my brother and sister have lost their
[44:32] life many people have spent weeks
[44:34] and some even into months in the
[44:36] hospital because of those things
[44:37] and god comes right down in our midst
[44:40] amen
[44:41] said i i'm gonna i'm gonna let you oh
[44:44] i'm gonna get so sidetracked this
[44:45] morning

[45:02] hallelujah don't you thank the lord for
[45:04] that this morning
[45:05] amen well speaking on our thoughts amen
[45:09] we want to speak on
[45:10] uh true revelation brings
[45:14] implement i struggle to say this word
[45:16] forgive me
[45:17] implementation hallelujah amen
[45:20] now that's in big letters my brother and
[45:22] sister because
[45:24] you study brother branham talks about
[45:26] true revelation
[45:27] he doesn't under those words have a
[45:30] great expanded
[45:32] explanation because we can simply stop
[45:35] and say
[45:36] true revelation and i think we
[45:38] comprehend what that is
[45:40] versus just any old revelation versus a
[45:43] revelation that's not true so true
[45:46] revelation
[45:48] brings implementation
[45:51] amen in other words if you really have a
[45:55] revelation
[45:56] it's going to bring some kind of action
[45:59] in our life hallelujah amen
[46:03] let's uh as we stand i just want to um
[46:08] announce that we are having communion
[46:10] and foot washing this coming sunday
[46:13] uh at 5 00 pm i didn't really look at
[46:15] what the date is on that
[46:16] um 8th on the 8th
[46:21] of november we are having communion and
[46:24] foot washing
[46:25] and i want to apologize that we have
[46:28] been so long without communion and foot
[46:31] washing i
[46:32] kept thinking well when we get the
[46:34] basement
[46:35] straightened up but we've had all kinds
[46:38] of distractions and all kinds of things
[46:40] come through and
[46:41] the basement's not finished
[46:45] but that's not going to keep us
[46:48] from stepping into what god asked us to
[46:51] do
[46:52] amen so the sisters will be upstairs
[46:57] discussing it with some of the brothers
[46:58] it doesn't matter if we get dusty
[47:01] we whatever we'll go right down and
[47:04] we'll have our foot washing in the
[47:06] basement just like always
[47:08] you see it wasn't about what we come to
[47:10] show our fine robes
[47:13] it wasn't our own righteousness we come
[47:15] to show off
[47:17] amen it's him it's always been him it
[47:21] will always
[47:22] be him amen
[47:25] sister jerry and i would just like to
[47:27] say to you thank you so much
[47:29] for your kind words your appreciation
[47:32] your gifts
[47:35] very humbling i have to say if you
[47:37] really knew me you probably wouldn't
[47:39] have said those words
[47:43] but it's by god's grace and only by his
[47:47] grace
[47:48] that we can be what we are
[47:52] this old nature i'm not talking to you
[47:54] but it might be people like you
[47:57] can be contentious and grouchy and
[48:00] argumentive
[48:01] and all these kind of things but you see
[48:03] god come down
[48:04] and says the real you
[48:08] oh let me explain to you the real you
[48:11] you see saints just let me express it
[48:14] this way we're on
[48:15] this side looking at the cross but did
[48:20] you know the real you
[48:22] is on this side looking back into what
[48:26] we
[48:27] call time and the real
[48:30] us is looking back and saying i see who
[48:32] i am
[48:33] i see what god called me for i see the
[48:36] provision that was made
[48:38] and i can fulfill that
[48:42] and then we bypassed our theophany and
[48:44] god set us right down here
[48:46] in time and we're here
[48:50] through many struggles toils and snares
[48:54] i have already come
[48:57] and all of them that are still coming
[48:59] because i'm not looking at it from my
[49:01] flesh man i'm looking at it from
[49:04] this side i look back in time and say
[49:06] there is
[49:07] nothing that will keep me from
[49:10] fulfilling
[49:11] the calling in my life can we just give
[49:14] the lord a hand clap
[49:16] lord thank you nothing
[49:19] nothing
[49:22] amen hallelujah once again thank you for
[49:26] your kind words and gifts
[49:28] amen um i we appreciate that from the
[49:31] depths of our heart i
[49:33] i'll pass on before i start crying
[49:37] um let's turn in our bibles to john
[49:41] first john 1
[49:45] amen you know as i was asking the lord i
[49:49] just
[49:49] was a little inspiration come and i said
[49:51] lord
[49:53] where do i bring this from or how do i
[49:54] bring this and
[49:56] sometimes you have an idea you have a
[49:58] thought and
[49:59] quite honestly you don't even have a
[50:01] scripture for it and you just have to
[50:02] say lord now
[50:04] where do you want me to go where do you
[50:05] want to start and
[50:07] how would you like to bring this about
[50:10] amen
[50:11] and i feel like the lord led me to first
[50:13] john
[50:14] 1. in the beginning
[50:19] oh that's john 1 brothers first john
[50:22] first john brothers amen i might have
[50:25] wrote it down wrong
[50:27] will be just a second saints well i'll
[50:28] just read
[50:30] that which was from the beginning which
[50:33] we have heard
[50:34] can someone say amen which we have seen
[50:38] with our eyes
[50:40] which we have looked upon and our hands
[50:44] have handled of the word of life
[50:47] now i want you to realize in that verse
[50:49] my brother and sister
[50:50] and we'll tie it together a little later
[50:52] but in that verse
[50:54] we are not talking about what this great
[50:57] man
[50:57] experienced what that great man
[51:00] experienced
[51:01] we're talking about what we have
[51:04] experienced too many people
[51:08] friend and foe of the gospel is looking
[51:11] back
[51:12] well this is what this is that's good i
[51:14] love
[51:15] lady i was witnessing two yesterday said
[51:17] well what what what
[51:18] verses what chapter in the bible or
[51:20] whatever it means the most to you
[51:22] and and i gave her the most convoluted
[51:24] answer that you could ever
[51:26] ever get well i love john 1 in the
[51:29] beginning was the word
[51:31] but i said i love the corinthians and i
[51:34] love romans because the apostle
[51:36] paul showed our life and the behaviors
[51:38] and the struggle
[51:39] and all of these things the correction
[51:41] by the word and then i love the book of
[51:44] revelation because it shows us what the
[51:45] beginning was
[51:46] and it shows us what the end is i said
[51:48] so i can't just pick one spot
[51:52] but as you well know revelations 19 6 7
[51:55] 8 9 means a lot to me because it
[51:57] declares that
[51:58] his wife hath made herself ready
[52:02] and i'm identified in the rest of the
[52:04] bible as
[52:05] his wife and that's a confirmation that
[52:07] i'm getting ready
[52:09] amen i i i the lord was very present
[52:13] there
[52:13] and sister jerry and i this lovely
[52:15] opportunity
[52:16] and so she didn't catch the fact that my
[52:18] answer was so convoluted it really
[52:20] didn't pick out one single scripture
[52:23] because you see
[52:27] verse is connected to verse
[52:31] which is connected to verse which is
[52:33] connected to verse
[52:34] and somebody said it was chapter
[52:37] whatever
[52:39] but you see you go right from in here
[52:42] looking at first john you look
[52:44] right from verse one verse two
[52:48] you don't make separation and when you
[52:51] get to into what we call the chapter
[52:53] the thought the continuity carries right
[52:55] on
[52:56] i'm sorry there's just no book in the
[52:58] bible that overrules the other
[53:00] book every book that was necessary for a
[53:02] bride is connected right here in
[53:04] what we call the bible amen
[53:07] oh hallelujah let me get started
[53:11] which we have heard which we have seen
[53:13] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[53:15] and our hands have handled of the word
[53:17] of life
[53:18] for the life was manifested and we
[53:21] have seen it amen not just someone
[53:25] telling us about this but
[53:26] we have seen it and bear witness
[53:30] and show unto you that eternal life
[53:32] which was with the father and was
[53:34] manifested
[53:35] unto us that which we have seen and
[53:37] heard declare we unto you
[53:40] that ye also may have fellowship with us
[53:42] and truly our fellowship is with the
[53:44] father
[53:45] and with his son jesus christ and these
[53:48] things right
[53:49] unto you that your joy may be full
[53:52] this then is the message which we have
[53:54] heard of him and declare unto you
[53:57] that god is light and in him is no
[54:00] darkness at all if we say that we have
[54:03] fellowship with him
[54:04] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[54:08] the truth
[54:10] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[54:12] the light
[54:13] we have fellowship one with another
[54:17] now remember church i made a statement
[54:19] here recently in a service
[54:22] that the whole unity movement that is
[54:24] around
[54:25] people saying well we just need to come
[54:27] together we just need to come together
[54:29] we have no agreement we don't have same
[54:32] doctrines but
[54:33] we want you know we got to have this
[54:35] love we got to have this unity
[54:36] i'll take you right here to this
[54:38] scripture we've got to be walking in the
[54:41] light
[54:42] before the unity can come and when we
[54:45] walk in that light
[54:46] we can have fellowship not only with him
[54:50] but with one another so if you
[54:53] are walking and there is what i would
[54:56] call
[54:56] difference not just different
[54:59] understanding but
[55:00] difference i want you to think about
[55:03] this scripture because
[55:04] we can't walk in the light and embrace
[55:08] something that's not in the light amen
[55:12] some people think i'm trying to separate
[55:14] us
[55:15] no saints i'm sorry i have no
[55:18] hidden agenda
[55:22] i have no secret meaning to my words
[55:27] but as i was witnessing to this man
[55:29] named chris
[55:30] a man that had been a faithful in church
[55:32] and believed in the lord when he was
[55:34] young
[55:35] look me in the face and says my wife
[55:36] doesn't even know this
[55:38] but i believe god failed me
[55:43] boy that's worrisome except for i
[55:46] actually rejoiced because you see that
[55:48] was more than these double doors being
[55:50] wide open i was like here we go buddy
[55:53] are you ready
[55:54] we can go back to talking about seed and
[55:56] fertilizer and whatever else
[55:58] or we can go here and he's like go ahead
[56:00] go
[56:03] you see my brother and sister if we're
[56:05] not walking in complete light
[56:07] spirits like there seems to be a
[56:11] conflict
[56:12] spirits come in that say well
[56:15] there's no unity we have unity
[56:20] we have unity i've been united
[56:24] to jesus christ through his word
[56:28] amen sister jerry and i talking a little
[56:32] bit now don't misunderstand us i love
[56:33] every one of you
[56:35] but how many of us if it wasn't for this
[56:37] word of god in this hour would be
[56:38] sitting here this morning fellowshipping
[56:40] together
[56:42] we wouldn't even know each other in most
[56:43] cases
[56:45] and if we did we'd have enough
[56:46] personality conflict
[56:48] now i'm just going to be real blunt okay
[56:50] brother trevor and i believe
[56:51] are absolutely in unity you should have
[56:55] seen us we looked like a couple big horn
[56:57] rams on top of the mountain
[56:58] butting heads i don't say that negative
[57:01] to him
[57:02] i don't say that negative myself but you
[57:05] know what happens
[57:06] god comes down and deals with brother
[57:08] trevor
[57:09] god comes down and deals with brother
[57:11] paul
[57:12] and we both recognize our shortcoming
[57:15] and then we look at each other and i saw
[57:17] a whole different man
[57:19] but it wasn't because brother trevor
[57:21] changed that i saw a whole different man
[57:23] it was because god dealt with me and
[57:25] changed me and through looking through
[57:27] the lens of the revealed word
[57:29] are you with me now you know i just used
[57:31] brother trevor for an example we're not
[57:33] throwing him under any kind of bus or
[57:35] making any kind of example but but you
[57:38] see i just know we have this open
[57:39] relationship
[57:40] amen we just know we've had our times
[57:43] that we have vehemently disagreed with
[57:45] each other
[57:46] but what it is is god dealing with both
[57:48] of us and it didn't come down brother
[57:49] trevor submitted to my idea
[57:51] and it wasn't paul submitting brother
[57:53] trevor's idea we both submitted to the
[57:55] word
[57:57] there's where unity comes in the body of
[57:59] believers
[58:00] when we all submit ourself
[58:04] to the word amen
[58:07] now where was i if we say we have
[58:11] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[58:13] we lie and do not the truth
[58:15] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[58:17] the light we have fellowship
[58:18] one with another do we catch that
[58:21] we're going to be walking in the light
[58:23] to have real true fellowship
[58:26] one with another and the blood of jesus
[58:28] christ his son cleanses
[58:30] us from all sin if we say that we have
[58:32] no sin we deceive ourself and the truth
[58:35] is not in us
[58:36] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[58:38] and just to forgive
[58:39] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[58:42] unrighteousness
[58:43] if we say that we have not sinned we
[58:45] make him a liar
[58:47] and his word is not in us
[58:50] heavenly father we just asked for your
[58:51] guiding hand today father you know my
[58:53] heart's cries
[58:54] i i have uh lord this morning just
[58:59] tried to find your mind completely lord
[59:02] eliminate ourselves from it
[59:04] lord you know what i have said would
[59:06] have asked father
[59:08] just ask you to move in the midst of us
[59:11] the midst of this body of believers
[59:13] those that might be listening
[59:15] father let us come in a complete
[59:19] honest submitted
[59:23] fellowship with you lord
[59:26] lord no isms that's right no ideologies
[59:32] no preconceived ideas but lord just
[59:35] submitted to your word we ask you now to
[59:39] guide us today in the name of jesus
[59:40] christ
[59:41] amen hallelujah you may be seated
[59:47] now saints i have decided that the
[59:48] preaching time clock doesn't start until
[59:50] you're seated
[59:54] i want to just revisit the scripture
[59:56] here for just a few minutes so if we
[59:58] will go back to
[59:59] uh first john 1 1. uh look at this
[1:00:03] now my brother and sister i believe is
[1:00:04] believers we sit here today
[1:00:06] uh now we we can't go by those who say
[1:00:10] that you're crazy
[1:00:11] uh you can't go by those that have a
[1:00:13] different ideology
[1:00:14] my brother and sister let them go let
[1:00:16] them travel their path
[1:00:18] as our brother george smith says and i
[1:00:20] don't say this to
[1:00:21] throw this back on brother george but as
[1:00:24] brother george says and i like the
[1:00:25] phrase he said let them run their race
[1:00:27] we will run our race and then we will
[1:00:29] meet at the finish line
[1:00:31] amen so i'm not allowing someone else to
[1:00:35] to control what god has revealed or
[1:00:38] uh uh you might say brought to me
[1:00:41] you see that which from the beginning
[1:00:43] which we have heard did we not hear it
[1:00:45] the message the word come to us
[1:00:47] which we have seen with our eyes and my
[1:00:49] brother and sister i tell you today if i
[1:00:52] would deny what i have seen amen in
[1:00:55] these few short years of my life
[1:00:57] i you could declare me a crazy man i
[1:01:00] have seen the supernatural
[1:01:02] i have seen god come down on the scene
[1:01:04] and change situations in such a fashion
[1:01:07] that no one present believer or not
[1:01:09] could deny
[1:01:10] that something supernatural had just
[1:01:13] happened in their midst amen
[1:01:15] and we have looked upon it and our hands
[1:01:17] have handled of the word of life
[1:01:19] amen so the life was manifested now as
[1:01:23] we look at this
[1:01:24] my brother and sister i want to just
[1:01:25] expand on this i have used this word
[1:01:28] manifest manifested manifestation uh
[1:01:31] you know to my amazement there's been
[1:01:34] times in my life
[1:01:35] in using that that people were upset and
[1:01:38] some people think if you just simply
[1:01:40] say well okay i believe the message of
[1:01:42] the hour
[1:01:43] that is sufficient i'm sorry my bible
[1:01:46] and the message that i believe
[1:01:48] says there is a time and a place that
[1:01:50] there will be a manifestation
[1:01:53] and so in that my brother and sister
[1:01:55] this is not simply something for us to
[1:01:57] talk about it is not simply something
[1:02:00] and i will use this phrase lip
[1:02:01] service several times in the service so
[1:02:04] please don't feel like i'm being rude
[1:02:06] but it is not something for us simply to
[1:02:08] have lip service
[1:02:09] i remember as a young man really
[1:02:11] honestly backslid i gave up on the lord
[1:02:14] you know kind of felt you might say that
[1:02:15] the lord had failed something was wrong
[1:02:17] when i was about 15 years old
[1:02:19] and uh you know my brother and sister
[1:02:21] you can learn to say the right things
[1:02:24] young people
[1:02:24] you can learn to say the right thing and
[1:02:27] act in the right way
[1:02:29] though that will not change what is down
[1:02:31] in your heart
[1:02:32] i would encourage you from the very
[1:02:34] depths of my heart to you
[1:02:35] that you would either decide it's real
[1:02:37] or it's a lie and move from there amen
[1:02:40] because you go along in the realm of
[1:02:42] hypocrisy
[1:02:44] and all you do is compromise your own
[1:02:46] character of who you are
[1:02:47] now having said that i will tell you
[1:02:50] that until you come to a place that you
[1:02:52] truly have been
[1:02:53] moved by god anointed in the spirit uh
[1:02:56] this is kind of a blunt phrase forgive
[1:02:58] me
[1:02:59] but don't knock it until you have
[1:03:00] honestly tried it
[1:03:02] amen too people look at the things of
[1:03:04] god they look at the word of god
[1:03:06] and they say well i don't know i don't
[1:03:08] know i don't know
[1:03:10] well i had the courage bold my brother
[1:03:12] and sister as the scripture
[1:03:13] says that i just in this last few days i
[1:03:16] just spoke it out now i'm not lifting up
[1:03:18] paul
[1:03:18] i'm lifting up a boldness that god would
[1:03:20] place upon us
[1:03:21] to step upon a step over all thresholds
[1:03:24] and say you know what this is a word
[1:03:26] they need to hear the word we're not
[1:03:28] lifting ourselves up look to me look to
[1:03:29] me look to me or look to my church
[1:03:31] we're saying look to jesus christ this
[1:03:33] is the truth that if you
[1:03:35] have not truly from the depths of your
[1:03:37] heart try jesus christ as a solution to
[1:03:40] your life don't knock it
[1:03:42] don't say it's a lie don't say it's
[1:03:44] nothing you seem
[1:03:46] nothing is more wasteful
[1:03:49] than the superficial right
[1:03:54] i want you to think on that the
[1:03:56] superficial
[1:03:58] i always joke you know i can't do it
[1:04:00] anymore because i'm driving a ford but i
[1:04:02] always used to you know
[1:04:03] just harass people that drove forwards
[1:04:05] on that you know what was it just
[1:04:07] superficial banter
[1:04:12] a waste of time no i'm not talking about
[1:04:15] us sitting around
[1:04:16] and fellowship and saying something we
[1:04:18] had a laugh i i
[1:04:19] i promised i wouldn't throw anybody
[1:04:21] under the bus but
[1:04:22] we spent a little bit of time there with
[1:04:25] the little
[1:04:26] party they had for sister olga uh one of
[1:04:28] the sisters made a comment that i'm
[1:04:30] still
[1:04:30] busting up over when i think about it
[1:04:33] hey man you know you look at that and
[1:04:34] you think yeah
[1:04:35] okay i'm not talking about seeing some
[1:04:37] humor i'm not talking about
[1:04:39] enjoying a good laugh in life but i mean
[1:04:41] when we go day
[1:04:42] after day after day living
[1:04:46] a superficial life
[1:04:52] come on i did it for over 20 years of my
[1:04:56] life
[1:04:57] lived a superficial life
[1:05:01] oh you'll find something to fill that up
[1:05:04] the devil's got all kinds of things to
[1:05:06] offer up to you but he says for the life
[1:05:09] was manifested and we have seen it
[1:05:12] now the word manifest is saying
[1:05:15] abel this is webster online able to be
[1:05:18] seen
[1:05:19] clearly shown or visible
[1:05:22] easy to understand or
[1:05:25] recognize readily perceivable
[1:05:29] by the senses and especially by the
[1:05:31] sense of sight
[1:05:34] now look at the scripture what does it
[1:05:35] do for the life was manifested
[1:05:39] and we have seen it right
[1:05:43] god didn't hide it god didn't say i'm
[1:05:45] going to put it off and i'm going to
[1:05:46] make it so difficult for people to
[1:05:48] recognize that i am
[1:05:50] present that very few would see it no
[1:05:52] god
[1:05:53] openly placed you and i in this world
[1:05:57] openly to display jesus christ
[1:06:00] amen and for all that truly are looking
[1:06:02] upon and looking for christ
[1:06:04] they recognize that my brother and
[1:06:06] sister
[1:06:08] they recognize that because you see
[1:06:13] it goes on to use the word
[1:06:16] obvious and a synonym
[1:06:20] of evident you see this is what god is
[1:06:23] doing
[1:06:24] the life has been made obvious the life
[1:06:27] has been made
[1:06:28] evident the life is readily perceived
[1:06:32] the life is easy to understand
[1:06:36] the life has been clearly shown
[1:06:39] and is visible
[1:06:43] hallelujah we're not in a basket
[1:06:45] somewhere we're not in a corner
[1:06:47] we're not removed from this world god
[1:06:50] put us here
[1:06:51] made it real to you and i that our life
[1:06:54] would make it real to those around us
[1:06:57] can someone say amen to that and i use
[1:07:01] that because it goes on and there's
[1:07:02] quite a lengthy
[1:07:04] uh deal and this is in contrast to
[1:07:06] something that is vague
[1:07:09] you see mother and sister i'm going to
[1:07:11] speak direct today i hope i don't offend
[1:07:13] no one
[1:07:14] but for us to take a position that we
[1:07:16] just say well praise the lord i'll be in
[1:07:18] the rapture
[1:07:18] because i believe god sent a prophet is
[1:07:20] so vague
[1:07:23] it is so vague the word of god gives
[1:07:25] very clear-cut
[1:07:26] instruction to you and i of what it will
[1:07:29] take to be an overcomer in this day
[1:07:32] and to stand before that throne are you
[1:07:34] she
[1:07:36] i had no idea my wife was singing that
[1:07:38] song this morning
[1:07:39] are you she see it is not a
[1:07:42] vague thing that defines who the bride
[1:07:45] of christ
[1:07:45] is god's word is clear but many stay i
[1:07:48] don't see it the way you see it well you
[1:07:50] don't have to see it the way i see it
[1:07:52] but you need to see it this way because
[1:07:55] if you don't see it this way you have
[1:07:57] completely missed it
[1:07:59] amen amen i'm not too harsh am i
[1:08:02] okay that which we have seen and heard
[1:08:07] declare we unto you that he also may
[1:08:10] have fellowship with
[1:08:11] us my that sounds very narrow right
[1:08:14] we're going to declare these things to
[1:08:16] you that you can have fellowship with us
[1:08:19] but you see real true fellowship i want
[1:08:21] to come back drive this home
[1:08:24] truly our fellowship is with the father
[1:08:28] see the fellowship is not with grace
[1:08:30] tabernacle
[1:08:32] the fellowship is not with brother
[1:08:33] so-and-so the fellowship is with the
[1:08:36] father
[1:08:37] and his son jesus christ amen that's
[1:08:40] where it's all connected together my
[1:08:41] brother and sister
[1:08:43] now i'm not pushing back against
[1:08:44] anything no one please misunderstand
[1:08:46] when the lord led me to this and did i
[1:08:49] actually had been reading
[1:08:50] and putting things together before it
[1:08:52] dawned on me really what
[1:08:54] this was saying because it was actually
[1:08:56] just a portion of this we'll get to in a
[1:08:58] minute
[1:08:58] that that really rung true at first but
[1:09:01] you realize
[1:09:02] all this fellowship has to become and
[1:09:05] brought down through one channel
[1:09:07] amen amen amen
[1:09:12] hallelujah and these things right we
[1:09:15] unto you that your joy may be full
[1:09:17] now my brother and sister sometimes we
[1:09:19] preachers can get a little adamant
[1:09:22] let me tell you it's not from a control
[1:09:24] freak issue
[1:09:26] it is of a heart
[1:09:29] burden to see people catch a full
[1:09:33] revelation of jesus christ it is not
[1:09:37] us trying to make anyone feel as though
[1:09:40] they were
[1:09:40] of a lesser understanding or promote
[1:09:43] someone of greater
[1:09:44] understanding but truly that we could
[1:09:47] come to a plane
[1:09:48] that we recognize our relationship with
[1:09:51] jesus christ
[1:09:52] your relationship with christ does not
[1:09:54] include
[1:09:56] this or that
[1:10:00] or that it's you and christ
[1:10:04] it's not you and the pope you say well
[1:10:06] we're not catholics of course that isn't
[1:10:08] but some people have raised their own
[1:10:09] pope up
[1:10:17] we'll leave that alone this then is the
[1:10:20] message which we have heard of him and
[1:10:21] declare unto you that god is light
[1:10:23] and in him is no darkness now my brother
[1:10:26] and sister i hope
[1:10:27] this morning as we go brothers to verse
[1:10:30] six
[1:10:31] i hope this morning you will catch this
[1:10:33] because i'm going to put this to you
[1:10:35] in this point at this point there is
[1:10:37] failure to implement the word
[1:10:39] so we can all say oh praise the lord the
[1:10:41] light has come the latter's come god
[1:10:43] sent a prophet laodicean age this last
[1:10:45] stage
[1:10:45] and we can all say amen to that but
[1:10:48] there now comes a time
[1:10:50] of separation because uh we'll read
[1:10:52] quotes here in a little bit but the
[1:10:54] prophet of god talking about
[1:10:56] revelation and how it is affected
[1:10:59] in our lives and what it brings about
[1:11:02] and my brother and sister we can all use
[1:11:04] the vocabulary of revelation
[1:11:06] but there is a vast difference of the
[1:11:09] implementation
[1:11:10] of what revelation is amen and so as we
[1:11:13] look at this we're coming now
[1:11:15] into the place where implementation
[1:11:18] has uh it's failed to take place and i
[1:11:21] hope you follow me
[1:11:22] this is a message we've heard of him and
[1:11:23] declaring to you that god is light and
[1:11:25] in him there's no darkness
[1:11:28] i should ask the brothers to hide like
[1:11:29] this it's highlighted in my notes
[1:11:32] if we say i want you to catch this now
[1:11:35] what is it you know i love you okay
[1:11:38] nobody feel like i'm rubbing on you
[1:11:40] if we say
[1:11:45] all through the word of god god has
[1:11:47] allowed or
[1:11:49] caused people
[1:11:52] to declare their position
[1:11:56] and we live in an age we live in a time
[1:11:58] that god will cause you
[1:12:00] to declare your position amen if we say
[1:12:03] that we have fellowship with him
[1:12:06] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[1:12:08] the truth
[1:12:12] no implementation amen but if we walk in
[1:12:16] the light
[1:12:17] see the words come the light has come we
[1:12:20] recognize the the light is here
[1:12:23] and i now have opportunity to walk in
[1:12:26] that light
[1:12:27] i must choose to walk in that light or
[1:12:30] not
[1:12:30] right now i'm talking saints not just
[1:12:33] whether god sent a prophet
[1:12:34] we are way beyond that amen this is the
[1:12:37] word being made manifest in you and i
[1:12:40] we'll have to choose when the word is
[1:12:42] open to us
[1:12:44] you know how it is sometimes we can go
[1:12:45] for years with a certain
[1:12:47] idea and one day god comes and corrects
[1:12:49] that idea we have to stop and say will i
[1:12:51] accept the correction or not
[1:12:53] it should be instinctive that we would
[1:12:54] say lord forgive me and we move right
[1:12:56] into that but it's not always so
[1:12:59] maybe it's something that's very deep
[1:13:01] affects your life
[1:13:02] and then you struggle with that do i do
[1:13:04] i do this do i do this not
[1:13:06] i oh my goodness what do i do but you
[1:13:08] see my brother and sister if we say we
[1:13:10] have the fellowship and we
[1:13:12] are in darkness we lie and do not the
[1:13:13] truth but if we
[1:13:15] walk in the light amen as he is in the
[1:13:18] light we have fellowship one with
[1:13:19] another you see
[1:13:20] it's all relevant whether we make the
[1:13:22] decision as the light is moving now the
[1:13:25] prophet of god said
[1:13:26] that god never stops opening his word
[1:13:29] god never stops revealing himself
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:37] it won't do us any good i was saved 40
[1:13:40] years ago brother paul i believe this
[1:13:41] message for 40 years
[1:13:43] are you 40 years ago are you in the
[1:13:45] light that is here present today
[1:13:50] you have to decide what you're going to
[1:13:52] do i believe god sends a prophet
[1:13:53] that's wonderful that is one of the key
[1:13:55] elements but have you believe the word
[1:13:58] that he
[1:13:59] opened to our generation
[1:14:02] and that's what makes the difference
[1:14:04] amen
[1:14:06] and no any critic that might be
[1:14:08] listening i'm not bashing brother
[1:14:09] branham
[1:14:12] i believe with all my heart you'd stand
[1:14:13] right here and say that's absolutely the
[1:14:15] truth
[1:14:16] i come i open the word according to that
[1:14:19] but the word
[1:14:20] is still being revealed to you and i oh
[1:14:23] no that's not a new message
[1:14:25] some people when you start talking about
[1:14:27] the word being revealed to you
[1:14:29] are like oh my i've had it spoke to me
[1:14:31] oh my
[1:14:32] you are saying there's something beyond
[1:14:34] brother branham no
[1:14:35] i'm telling you that when god opened the
[1:14:38] word to this laodicean church age
[1:14:41] we didn't have a clue all that was in
[1:14:44] the word
[1:14:45] and it's still being open to you and i
[1:14:48] we are still seeing more and more and
[1:14:51] more of who
[1:14:52] we are because many of us were in that
[1:14:55] position that we were in a cycle
[1:14:58] and we would come lord i love you and in
[1:15:00] your heart you're speaking from the
[1:15:01] heart
[1:15:02] lord i love you and i believe you but
[1:15:04] then we would fail
[1:15:05] and it puts us right back in the start
[1:15:07] of the cycle again
[1:15:09] and over time the word of god shows us
[1:15:11] that man becomes
[1:15:12] tired of the repetition of forgive me
[1:15:15] lord forgive me lord
[1:15:16] and in that then they either give up
[1:15:18] entirely or they move into a mode of
[1:15:21] well god knows i'm just a sinner
[1:15:24] the spirit in the world today my brother
[1:15:26] and sister denomination
[1:15:28] now i don't recommend you go and listen
[1:15:29] to a lot of this honestly i don't
[1:15:31] please don't but my brother and sister
[1:15:33] the spirit in the world today
[1:15:35] is a behavior that is unchecked a
[1:15:38] behavior that is
[1:15:39] unchanged and their excuse in the cycle
[1:15:42] is to say well god knows i'm broken
[1:15:49] but i know a god that fixes things i
[1:15:52] know a god that doesn't leave us broken
[1:15:54] i know a god that comes and takes all
[1:15:57] the broken pieces
[1:15:59] and puts them together and in that he
[1:16:02] anoints that to be a vessel of honor
[1:16:05] not some broken patch together vessel
[1:16:08] that's not good for holding much more
[1:16:10] than dirt
[1:16:11] he says i will make you perfect if i
[1:16:15] hadn't had that bout of vertigo
[1:16:16] this last wednesday and i'm lord willing
[1:16:19] i'll preach it this coming wednesday
[1:16:20] talking about perfection it was the lead
[1:16:23] up to this but i still felt led to
[1:16:25] preach this
[1:16:26] amen but my brother and sister you see
[1:16:28] god doesn't look at you
[1:16:30] as the broken god looks at you as the
[1:16:33] perfect
[1:16:34] god looks at you as the righteous god
[1:16:36] looks at you as the holy
[1:16:39] yes right hallelujah you know if you're
[1:16:41] on the internet very much and
[1:16:43] and i i'm not really in one sense but
[1:16:45] you look and and you know there's an
[1:16:46] advertisement out there i don't remember
[1:16:48] the name of the stuff
[1:16:49] but they've got a glue now kind of some
[1:16:51] hybrid epoxy
[1:16:53] that literally they can take and glue a
[1:16:56] steel bar to a brick
[1:16:57] and drive over it with a car and can't
[1:17:00] break it
[1:17:02] well praise the lord
[1:17:06] that's me no it's not
[1:17:11] god said he'd take you back to the
[1:17:12] original
[1:17:14] you're not a vessel that's got all these
[1:17:16] little lines that are glued together
[1:17:19] not a vessel that's got all these little
[1:17:21] pieces that little chip here and a
[1:17:22] little chip there
[1:17:23] that's what we see in the flesh but i
[1:17:25] want to see you as god sees you
[1:17:34] oh brother paul wait how do we
[1:17:38] how do we reconcile this i just told you
[1:17:44] i'm perfect i just told you you're
[1:17:46] perfect
[1:17:47] but the word says if we say that we have
[1:17:49] no sin
[1:17:50] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[1:17:52] not in us
[1:17:55] the lack of acknowledgement
[1:17:59] that it's because he's perfect
[1:18:02] that we're perfect the lack of
[1:18:04] acknowledgement
[1:18:06] that because he's righteous we're
[1:18:08] righteous
[1:18:09] the lack of acknowledgement because he
[1:18:11] is holy
[1:18:12] we can be holy remember what i preached
[1:18:16] to you last sunday you see we
[1:18:17] we've like the like that that statue
[1:18:20] uh what was michelangelo moses he knocks
[1:18:23] that chunk off of that
[1:18:24] that chunk even though removed was
[1:18:26] always a part of that statue
[1:18:30] and we be taken off of christ as the
[1:18:32] prophet of god showed us
[1:18:34] we are a part of him amen
[1:18:39] so
[1:18:43] if we say
[1:18:47] i want you to catch this i hope you
[1:18:49] catch this today
[1:18:50] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[1:18:52] ourselves and those truths not ends
[1:18:54] look what the counter type is it's been
[1:18:57] implemented now if we confess our sin
[1:19:00] oh my god aren't you glad saints i tell
[1:19:04] you there's days that i'm just like oh
[1:19:06] paul and then i remind myself go back to
[1:19:09] the court where brother branham says
[1:19:10] that we backslide daily
[1:19:12] wait a prophet of god he wasn't speaking
[1:19:14] about you
[1:19:16] he included himself in there he didn't
[1:19:19] remove himself
[1:19:20] exclude himself i'm perfect you're not
[1:19:23] you know that's why oh
[1:19:24] i'm gonna get sidetracked here but
[1:19:26] that's why the prophet of god right on
[1:19:28] tape
[1:19:28] for critic friend or foe to hear he
[1:19:31] talks about how the telephone rings
[1:19:33] and he just tells his wife tell him i'm
[1:19:36] not here
[1:19:38] sounds perfect to me
[1:19:42] you know what the perfection was that he
[1:19:45] could not live
[1:19:46] without making that not
[1:19:50] in his anointing of almighty god coming
[1:19:52] down on a vessel
[1:19:54] not brushing it under a carpet well you
[1:19:57] know the reason i behaved
[1:19:59] oh lord help me now i feel a little
[1:20:02] spiritual vertigo here
[1:20:05] oh lord help us help me lord
[1:20:09] to no longer make an excuse for the
[1:20:12] reasons
[1:20:13] i have excuses well if you knew what
[1:20:17] i've been through
[1:20:21] i'm preaching to myself so nobody get
[1:20:23] offended well
[1:20:24] hallelujah i know i have problems too
[1:20:29] my goodness i have problems but i went
[1:20:32] under the blood
[1:20:34] and i came out the other side and one of
[1:20:37] those things that washed away from me
[1:20:39] was my excuses
[1:20:41] i don't need him any longer i've got the
[1:20:44] blood i've got him
[1:20:46] amen so i can confess my sin he's
[1:20:49] faithful and just to forgive us
[1:20:50] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:20:52] unrighteousness
[1:20:54] if we say
[1:20:57] we have not sinned we make him a liar
[1:20:59] and his word
[1:21:00] is not in us you see it comes down my
[1:21:03] brother and sister simply the
[1:21:04] implementation of the word of god in our
[1:21:06] life
[1:21:07] it's here it's in the open it's not
[1:21:10] hidden
[1:21:11] all we have to do is say there's the
[1:21:12] word and that hurt
[1:21:15] oh my come on i'm just going to be blunt
[1:21:18] this morning we might come to a place we
[1:21:19] stop and say oh lord
[1:21:21] the lust of the flesh the pride of life
[1:21:24] all of these things oh god that's me
[1:21:27] i'm affected by them the winds of
[1:21:29] laodicea blow against me lord
[1:21:31] and they sway me
[1:21:35] but i can confess i can confess oh god
[1:21:38] forgive me forgive me
[1:21:42] of everything that's not pleasing to you
[1:21:44] forgive me lord
[1:21:46] and he's faithful and just to forgive us
[1:21:49] oh hallelujah does that make you happy
[1:21:52] amen you see we don't need to come to
[1:21:54] the place if we say that we have not
[1:21:55] sinned
[1:21:56] there's no need for us to come to this
[1:21:57] place and say i was unable to implement
[1:22:00] the word of god
[1:22:01] in my life all we have to do is simply
[1:22:04] submit to the word
[1:22:05] and say lord i believe hallelujah now
[1:22:09] the word implement
[1:22:10] is to begin to do to use something a
[1:22:13] plan
[1:22:14] to make something active or effective
[1:22:17] to carry out or accomplish
[1:22:20] to have a practical effect to ensure an
[1:22:23] actual fulfillment
[1:22:24] by concrete measures
[1:22:28] you know what concrete measures not
[1:22:31] theory
[1:22:34] it's what it says right in webster not
[1:22:36] theory something
[1:22:38] solid hallelujah
[1:22:41] well i'll tell you i i found no need
[1:22:43] real estate's getting really expensive
[1:22:45] but i don't need to build my house on
[1:22:47] sand i'll pay the price
[1:22:50] to find me a rock and build my house on
[1:22:52] that rock
[1:22:54] hallelujah you see but people don't want
[1:22:56] to pay prices we live in a world my
[1:22:58] brother and sister that people are not
[1:22:59] willing to pay the price
[1:23:01] amen now a true revelation
[1:23:05] brings about an implementation we hear
[1:23:07] the word
[1:23:08] something in us response what is it the
[1:23:11] prophet god showed us clearly through
[1:23:12] the ages that's the holy ghost in you
[1:23:15] my brother and sister you cannot respond
[1:23:17] to the word of god if god has not
[1:23:19] anointed you
[1:23:20] to respond to it amen so the holy ghost
[1:23:23] in you
[1:23:24] moves you to say that's nothing but the
[1:23:27] truth
[1:23:28] see we couldn't do that on our own
[1:23:30] saints we couldn't do that but it's the
[1:23:32] holy ghost
[1:23:34] in you now oh this always gets so
[1:23:36] complicated doesn't it
[1:23:38] how that we could not necessarily be
[1:23:39] right with the lord and the holy ghost
[1:23:41] anointing us
[1:23:42] to respond people struggle with that
[1:23:46] well wait uh that man's got problems
[1:23:48] what do you mean the holy ghost
[1:23:49] no the word says if he didn't call you
[1:23:53] you won't come
[1:23:56] amen now remember when the prophet of
[1:23:59] god that man come to him and said
[1:24:00] brother brown
[1:24:01] i've been seeking the holy ghost i went
[1:24:02] over here i've went over there i went
[1:24:04] here i went there
[1:24:05] and i i don't know i don't seem to find
[1:24:07] the holy ghost brother branham uh you
[1:24:09] know how do i get the holy ghost when
[1:24:10] did one know
[1:24:11] and and brother branham's talking to him
[1:24:13] there and he says now when you
[1:24:16] read that little pamphlet the day that
[1:24:20] you started seeking god you read that
[1:24:21] little pamphlet
[1:24:25] what happened he said i knew i knew i
[1:24:28] had to serve god i
[1:24:29] knew how to brother brown says that's
[1:24:32] when he came to you
[1:24:35] not the man that's in church without a
[1:24:36] single problem just his life
[1:24:38] is perfect
[1:24:42] don't get silent saints you ought to be
[1:24:46] rejoicing right now
[1:24:48] hallelujah just as
[1:24:51] i am without
[1:24:54] one please oh
[1:25:05] let's not let satan make this message
[1:25:08] complicated
[1:25:09] amen let's keep this my brother and
[1:25:11] sister because you see
[1:25:12] the holy ghost in you is what moves you
[1:25:15] to say that's nothing but the truth
[1:25:16] and i tell you an amen from the heart is
[1:25:19] very powerful
[1:25:21] it doesn't have to be amen from the lips
[1:25:23] right you know the scripture says that
[1:25:25] you know your
[1:25:26] your lips how does that go your lips you
[1:25:29] speak of me but your heart is far from
[1:25:31] me
[1:25:31] hey man you see my brother and sister
[1:25:34] the lips don't mean much
[1:25:36] amen we've seen this men pleasers
[1:25:40] give lip service amen
[1:25:48] i don't want to get any more sidetracked
[1:25:50] here now in revelation
[1:25:52] 3 17 very familiar scripture to us right
[1:25:57] commission of our age of the laodicean
[1:25:59] church age
[1:26:01] what's the first words right there
[1:26:07] if we say
[1:26:10] because thou sayest i am rich and
[1:26:13] increased with goods and have need of
[1:26:14] nothing and know us not that thou art
[1:26:16] wretched
[1:26:17] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:26:19] naked now
[1:26:20] this is the holy ghost speaking through
[1:26:23] john
[1:26:25] to become the written word to our day
[1:26:29] he says i counsel thee to buy of me
[1:26:32] gold tried in the fire so there's the
[1:26:35] counsel that he's giving
[1:26:36] he says that thou mayest be rich which
[1:26:39] is the counter
[1:26:40] of what they say they say i'm rich
[1:26:43] already
[1:26:43] but his counselor says you got to buy
[1:26:45] gold of me
[1:26:47] that thou mayest be rich amen so there's
[1:26:50] something
[1:26:50] it must be followed it must be
[1:26:52] implemented we can't just get that
[1:26:54] religious spirit any old place
[1:26:56] we got to come to god and get what would
[1:26:58] be the real religion
[1:27:01] hallelujah and white raiment
[1:27:04] that thou mayest be clothed in the shame
[1:27:07] of thy nakedness see
[1:27:08] we counter this with being naked up here
[1:27:11] of what they're saying see they say one
[1:27:13] thing but the reality is
[1:27:15] amen but he's now the holy spirit god
[1:27:19] through john speaking and says look
[1:27:21] if you'll get this white raiment the
[1:27:23] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:27:24] shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[1:27:27] and anoint thy eyes with i salve that
[1:27:29] thou mayest see
[1:27:32] he turns right around after getting that
[1:27:33] direction on how to deal with it not
[1:27:35] what
[1:27:36] you say not what i say
[1:27:39] not what they say but what was the
[1:27:42] counsel given to us
[1:27:43] and he comes right behind that and says
[1:27:46] as many as i love
[1:27:47] i rebuke and chase and be zealous
[1:27:49] therefore and repent why because he knew
[1:27:51] every one of us saints would be guilty
[1:27:53] of those verses of that position of what
[1:27:56] we have said
[1:27:57] but he had grace and he had mercy upon
[1:27:59] us i don't need to go around and declare
[1:28:01] well
[1:28:02] i'm righteous i'm holy i'm this i'm that
[1:28:04] my brother and sister
[1:28:05] i'll let the word i hope you're with me
[1:28:07] this morning i'll let the word that is
[1:28:10] in me
[1:28:10] do the speaking for me now god might use
[1:28:14] your voice might use
[1:28:15] my voice will use your life will use my
[1:28:18] life
[1:28:19] but the word that is in you will speak
[1:28:22] it cannot be held silent if we say
[1:28:25] amen now look at this oh i don't want
[1:28:28] you to get discouraged today saints
[1:28:30] look at this we have heard have we not
[1:28:33] gone back to first john there we have
[1:28:36] heard
[1:28:37] and we heeded the council amen that will
[1:28:40] be one of the things that separates
[1:28:43] this bride even from the church
[1:28:46] is that she's heeding the council
[1:28:49] she's listening he said i need to get my
[1:28:53] riches my gold
[1:28:54] my self-worth my value in this life
[1:28:57] from him i can't go out here and get it
[1:29:01] my accomplishment
[1:29:03] i can't get it out here in the life that
[1:29:05] i live
[1:29:06] i can't give it out here no matter how
[1:29:09] much i have seen
[1:29:12] i can't get it there now look at this
[1:29:15] when this little bride acted upon this
[1:29:17] council of
[1:29:18] uh uh uh uh of the word here amen as
[1:29:21] it was stirred you might say uh by this
[1:29:24] council
[1:29:25] there has to be a vindication
[1:29:29] now here again i don't mean to be
[1:29:31] offensive there's some people have
[1:29:32] different views on this that's fine and
[1:29:34] i'm not trying to
[1:29:34] pick on you or rebut anybody you you
[1:29:37] need to have it revealed to you by god
[1:29:39] and
[1:29:39] if i'm wrong i need god to reveal it to
[1:29:41] me amen
[1:29:43] can we agree on that amen but my brother
[1:29:46] and sister you see
[1:29:48] this word of god when it come forth it
[1:29:51] come forth in such a way
[1:29:53] and i believe god intended for it to be
[1:29:55] this way the word of god come forth the
[1:29:57] bible i'll start with it
[1:29:59] come forth in such a way that we can
[1:30:00] come up with ten thousand different
[1:30:02] religions that all say we believe the
[1:30:03] same bible
[1:30:04] amen some people nope that don't matter
[1:30:07] well i'm sorry
[1:30:08] it does matter amen god's not going to
[1:30:11] contradict himself and if he ever said
[1:30:13] something was important it remains
[1:30:14] important
[1:30:16] and so what happens is is when we have
[1:30:19] acted
[1:30:20] upon the council we'll find out that we
[1:30:22] were actually anointed and that
[1:30:24] anointing
[1:30:24] is revealed in revelations 19. amen so
[1:30:28] that anointing that has come down
[1:30:30] uh is uh now expressed you might say
[1:30:34] in revelations 19 so we've jumped a
[1:30:36] whole lot of things that have happened
[1:30:38] we've jumped over the vials we've jumped
[1:30:40] over the thunders we've jumped over all
[1:30:41] of these things
[1:30:42] and now we've come down to a place
[1:30:44] because this is coming right back
[1:30:45] into the intimacy of the bride of christ
[1:30:48] in the word for the hour
[1:30:49] and that word come and says a voice come
[1:30:51] out of the throne saying praise our god
[1:30:53] all ye is servants and all you that fear
[1:30:55] and both small and great
[1:30:56] and i heard is a great voice of a great
[1:30:59] multitude
[1:31:00] and a voice of many waters and a voice
[1:31:02] of mighty thundering saying hallelujah
[1:31:04] for the lord god omnipotent rainus amen
[1:31:07] now look at this verse seven i just love
[1:31:10] this verse i'm sorry i'm just in love
[1:31:12] with this verse
[1:31:12] because you see it is now a key stepping
[1:31:16] stone
[1:31:17] of the revelation of jesus christ in me
[1:31:20] i was not just hearing the word you were
[1:31:23] not just hearing the word
[1:31:25] but this little bride right here is
[1:31:28] glad she's not all pouty face amen she's
[1:31:32] rejoicing
[1:31:33] she's giving honor because she knows why
[1:31:36] she is who she is she's not there
[1:31:40] looking to calvary she's now by
[1:31:43] revelation
[1:31:44] looking at what her fulfillment is on
[1:31:47] this earth she's no longer saying
[1:31:49] whoa unto me why was i born in this day
[1:31:53] why do i look like i look why am i who i
[1:31:56] am
[1:31:56] she's looking back from the other side
[1:31:58] saying i was
[1:31:59] chosen oh hallelujah i was
[1:32:03] chosen of almighty god
[1:32:06] to be his representative
[1:32:10] this isn't an accident this is not by
[1:32:13] chance
[1:32:15] this is not the equivalent of a lottery
[1:32:17] ticket
[1:32:18] this is god in his return
[1:32:21] pre-determinant
[1:32:24] people get caught up there well that
[1:32:26] can't be because then it's
[1:32:28] it's all a waste of time because god
[1:32:30] already knew and guarded no no
[1:32:32] no free moral agency's still here i can
[1:32:35] walk right over here and i can choose to
[1:32:37] shake brother trevor's hand
[1:32:39] or i could choose to slap his face
[1:32:44] might not end well
[1:32:47] but i just want you to understand a
[1:32:48] radical or silly little thing like that
[1:32:50] we get to choose we get to choose to say
[1:32:53] amen are we gonna choose to think man i
[1:32:55] wish he'd shut up so we can go home
[1:32:58] come on we get to choose
[1:33:02] but he's telling us be glad and rejoice
[1:33:04] and give honor
[1:33:06] for the marriage of the lamb has come my
[1:33:07] brother and sister this word of god
[1:33:10] come and set the stage that it's not god
[1:33:13] plucking you and saying get ready buddy
[1:33:16] but something down inside of you says i
[1:33:18] believe that word
[1:33:19] that word was spoken he was speaking to
[1:33:21] me oh lord i want to be ready
[1:33:24] i want to fulfill this word i want that
[1:33:27] life to be my life
[1:33:29] i want to be bone of his bone i want to
[1:33:31] be flesh of his flesh
[1:33:33] spirit of his spirit hallelujah
[1:33:36] you see my brother and sister because
[1:33:39] the revelation of the word has come to
[1:33:41] you
[1:33:41] that is what is moving you to get ready
[1:33:45] it's no preacher it's no great
[1:33:47] evangelist
[1:33:49] none of them will ever move you trust me
[1:33:51] i know some of you folks
[1:33:53] couldn't move you with a 10-ton jack and
[1:33:55] a bulldozer
[1:33:57] but god can oh hallelujah
[1:34:01] don't get offended amen because i've got
[1:34:04] a quote for you if you are
[1:34:07] but look if i couldn't let your pastor
[1:34:10] move you
[1:34:11] i could come down here and push and kind
[1:34:14] of coerce and
[1:34:15] kind of beg and kind of whatever
[1:34:20] but just let the holy ghost come down
[1:34:23] because of who you
[1:34:24] are the holy ghost comes down and
[1:34:27] something in your heart goes oh lord
[1:34:28] that's right oh lord i want to be your
[1:34:32] word
[1:34:33] i want to be that life
[1:34:37] and what does she do she starts making
[1:34:40] herself ready
[1:34:41] you know how she makes herself ready
[1:34:44] come on now this might sound like a
[1:34:45] little loaded forgive me
[1:34:48] but when this simple preaching of the
[1:34:50] word comes
[1:34:52] and you recognize something in your life
[1:34:54] however small
[1:34:56] and you go lord forgive me deliver me
[1:34:59] from that lord
[1:35:01] see that's getting ready some people
[1:35:03] think getting ready is we've got a whole
[1:35:04] library of the message
[1:35:06] and we've got a whole nother library of
[1:35:08] the cross references of the message
[1:35:10] that show this and show that and tie
[1:35:12] this to this and puts this here
[1:35:14] and shows why their idea of the message
[1:35:16] their version of the message is correct
[1:35:19] but you see this real preparation
[1:35:23] comes through the simple preaching of
[1:35:25] the gospel
[1:35:27] that moves upon us now i might speak a
[1:35:30] little blood here maybe you've got a
[1:35:31] little problem lying
[1:35:34] the lord speaks to you and you say lord
[1:35:36] deliver me from that
[1:35:38] god comes on the scene satan's going to
[1:35:40] jump on that
[1:35:42] he's going to put you in and multiple
[1:35:44] things to try to get you back
[1:35:46] maybe the lust of the flesh now we all
[1:35:49] get spooked about that
[1:35:51] we all get freaked out that's a real
[1:35:53] spirit and it's a powerful spirit
[1:35:55] and you look at it as it was in the
[1:35:57] beginning so shall it be at the coming
[1:35:58] of the son of man let's not stick our
[1:36:00] head in the sand and not act like those
[1:36:01] spirits are not even going to come
[1:36:03] around us and afflict us
[1:36:05] come on saints amen and that's not just
[1:36:08] something stuck with man
[1:36:10] eve hadn't been attracted to that
[1:36:11] serpent
[1:36:16] and that's not too straight is it
[1:36:19] but you see it's by the preaching of the
[1:36:21] word
[1:36:23] amen now i'm not going to eliminate it
[1:36:25] see this is the problem we have on one
[1:36:26] side they want to eliminate
[1:36:28] ephesians 4 entirely and just go to the
[1:36:30] tapes but i tell you if you have balance
[1:36:32] in your life
[1:36:32] you recognize we need what's on those
[1:36:34] tapes the prophet of god said rapturing
[1:36:37] faith is on those tapes
[1:36:39] amen we need that the bible also gives
[1:36:42] us
[1:36:42] a ministry hallelujah so let's not let's
[1:36:46] not get selective here and throw one out
[1:36:48] throwing out
[1:36:48] because you might just throw out the
[1:36:50] very thing you need amen
[1:36:52] find balance in this but you see the
[1:36:55] word has come and what has it done
[1:36:57] she's recognized oh lord deliver me from
[1:36:59] this
[1:37:00] lord help me here lord i have a spirit
[1:37:02] of maybe bitterness i have a spirit of
[1:37:04] depression i have these things
[1:37:05] lord deliver me and sincerity from the
[1:37:08] heart
[1:37:09] but you know what it is most of the time
[1:37:10] saints i'm just going to speak blind
[1:37:13] on those besetting sins you might say
[1:37:15] we're so ashamed of them
[1:37:17] we would never let no one on earth know
[1:37:20] something like that bothered us
[1:37:22] we would never say church pray for me or
[1:37:24] pastor pray for me
[1:37:26] because my goodness we're just terrified
[1:37:28] at the idea somebody would know we were
[1:37:32] human
[1:37:34] and you people have androids for phones
[1:37:39] androids are hard to use they're hard to
[1:37:42] deal with
[1:37:43] i heard that they're unrepentant
[1:37:48] you carry one you should know it's
[1:37:50] nature then
[1:37:53] i'm just making light of that honey
[1:37:57] we're human why should we be
[1:38:01] ashamed that we're human
[1:38:06] little brian stand up and take your
[1:38:08] god-given right
[1:38:10] stand right up and stand on that why
[1:38:13] because as she makes herself ready
[1:38:16] she was granted this didn't just come
[1:38:19] automatic this wasn't a free gift
[1:38:23] do you catch that she was granted
[1:38:27] one was connected to the other one would
[1:38:29] not come to pass until the other one had
[1:38:31] come to pass
[1:38:32] interconnected
[1:38:36] and to her was granted that she should
[1:38:37] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:38:39] for fine linen
[1:38:40] is the righteousness of saints let's
[1:38:42] take this back to revelations 3 right
[1:38:44] they're naked
[1:38:46] and he's telling him
[1:38:49] come to me
[1:38:52] so you won't be naked amen what is a
[1:38:56] part of this covering see we can get
[1:38:58] this and we can argue with the sequence
[1:39:00] that these things take place saints
[1:39:02] but i tell you what part of it is as
[1:39:04] this little bride
[1:39:05] starts to get ready
[1:39:09] she responding to the word one step at a
[1:39:13] time
[1:39:13] sometimes it's an instant metamorphosis
[1:39:19] go to church in a low slung blouse and a
[1:39:22] mini skirt
[1:39:23] god deal with the heart come back never
[1:39:26] dress that way ever again in their life
[1:39:29] but for some it took time
[1:39:32] maybe fashion was something they had a
[1:39:34] little passion and they oh you know
[1:39:36] but you see as they're making themselves
[1:39:38] ready i'll help you get this as god's
[1:39:40] taking
[1:39:41] one covering away
[1:39:45] another one is coming and covering this
[1:39:48] bride
[1:39:50] he didn't say now you instantaneous have
[1:39:52] to do this
[1:39:53] but you see she's making herself
[1:39:56] ready and as she's being
[1:40:00] undressed from ungodly
[1:40:04] she is being dressed by the godly
[1:40:07] oh my brother and sister god taking that
[1:40:09] away taking it from her
[1:40:11] oh my goodness oh my goodness
[1:40:14] now let us just go on
[1:40:18] let's go on right here i need to hurry
[1:40:20] along my goodness
[1:40:22] my reputation is going to kill me one of
[1:40:23] these days
[1:40:26] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[1:40:28] forever there's one thing to teach
[1:40:30] something
[1:40:31] there's another thing for god to confirm
[1:40:33] it and say it's the truth see saints
[1:40:36] that's what's important
[1:40:39] that you take it back to the word
[1:40:43] and we'll touch on that in just a minute
[1:40:44] get going paul it's one thing to say
[1:40:46] something it's another thing to do
[1:40:48] something
[1:40:49] it's not hearers it's doers
[1:40:52] show me your faith without your works
[1:40:54] and i'll show you my faith paul said by
[1:40:55] my works
[1:40:56] if you believe it you will and let me
[1:41:00] change this just for the sake of our
[1:41:01] deal today
[1:41:02] if you believe it you'll implement it
[1:41:07] amen it'll bring an action in your life
[1:41:10] that you'll say lord your word said
[1:41:13] now you know brother paul wasn't very
[1:41:14] polite about that but it's still fit
[1:41:17] and lord i'm not going to get offended
[1:41:19] because it was your word
[1:41:22] not paul
[1:41:25] if you believe it you'll act upon it
[1:41:27] that's it and then your faith becomes
[1:41:29] works and god
[1:41:30] can go with you then you see my brother
[1:41:32] and sister
[1:41:34] we don't want to just hear it whatever
[1:41:37] aspect of the word of god it is we don't
[1:41:39] want to just hear it
[1:41:40] we want to stop if it hurts you now i'm
[1:41:43] not going to ask you how many of them
[1:41:45] you know i did that the other day and
[1:41:47] then i kind of felt bad later because
[1:41:48] way
[1:41:49] too many of you raised a hand
[1:41:54] but the man behind this pulpit might say
[1:41:56] things that might hurt you
[1:41:58] say him in such a way that you feel
[1:42:00] offended or whatever
[1:42:02] but you see ultimately it's the christ
[1:42:04] in you the holy ghost in you
[1:42:06] that can sift through that and say
[1:42:10] he wasn't picking on me he wasn't
[1:42:13] picking on me
[1:42:14] i'm going to recognize that was god
[1:42:17] speaking to me that i would recognize
[1:42:19] i need to let that go
[1:42:24] and for everything god takes away from
[1:42:26] you he gives you something
[1:42:28] so god will never leave you bankrupt
[1:42:31] amen
[1:42:33] if you'll accept it
[1:42:36] but if you choose not to accept it you
[1:42:39] might find yourself feeling bankrupt
[1:42:42] hallelujah amen now we're going to go
[1:42:45] through some quotes here real quick if i
[1:42:46] can figure out what the definition of
[1:42:48] quick
[1:42:48] is amen church age ephesian church age
[1:42:52] they knew the righteous life that
[1:42:53] accompanied the bearing of that name
[1:42:55] for whosoever nameth the name of the
[1:42:57] lord let him depart from sin
[1:42:59] be holy ye that bear the vessels of the
[1:43:02] lord
[1:43:02] thou shalt not bear the name of the lord
[1:43:04] thy god in vain
[1:43:06] these ephesians were christians
[1:43:09] oh is there any christians here this
[1:43:11] morning hallelujah
[1:43:13] amen i don't want to be some you know
[1:43:15] kind of half-hearted i don't want to be
[1:43:17] some kind of lukewarm
[1:43:18] i want to be a real christian they bore
[1:43:22] a name and that name was christ who was
[1:43:24] the spirit of god within them
[1:43:26] which was one of the threefold names of
[1:43:28] their lord as for my name's sake
[1:43:31] hath labored and has not fainted
[1:43:34] these believers weren't laboring for
[1:43:37] come on saint i want to drive that home
[1:43:40] for you
[1:43:41] you are not laboring for no one else but
[1:43:45] for our lord jesus christ young people
[1:43:48] you're not laboring for mom and dad
[1:43:50] a husband you're not laboring for a wife
[1:43:52] wife you're not laboring
[1:43:53] for a husband amen brother's not
[1:43:56] laboring for sisters
[1:43:57] the word tells us to do all things as
[1:44:00] unto the lord
[1:44:01] amen hallelujah so if we can do that and
[1:44:04] say amen to it
[1:44:06] then when the word comes back to correct
[1:44:08] us we need to recognize
[1:44:09] it's not this one it's not that one it's
[1:44:11] not that it's not that
[1:44:12] it's god speaking to me
[1:44:14] [Applause]
[1:44:16] they weren't laboring for paul or for an
[1:44:18] organization
[1:44:19] they weren't committed to programs and
[1:44:22] institutions
[1:44:23] whereby they built up the holdings of
[1:44:24] value they worked for the lord
[1:44:26] they were his servants not pawns
[1:44:30] ooh now i'm telling you my brother and
[1:44:32] sister
[1:44:33] everybody's like old brother animal
[1:44:35] brother adam i'm telling you if brother
[1:44:36] brown did come back
[1:44:37] he'd rip the height off of us
[1:44:40] and they'd be a whole lot of people
[1:44:42] would say whoa mistake that's not my
[1:44:44] prophet
[1:44:44] he loves everybody that's right he loves
[1:44:47] everybody
[1:44:48] but he knows what the word of god is
[1:44:50] because as god's mouthpiece
[1:44:52] he says those i love
[1:44:56] those i love i buy nice gifts for and i
[1:44:59] compliment them and i tell them what
[1:45:01] wonderful people no
[1:45:04] no because i love you he says i
[1:45:08] chasten you because i want you to be
[1:45:11] what the word
[1:45:12] in you called you to be not
[1:45:15] just words
[1:45:18] don't pay play lip service to this
[1:45:20] message things
[1:45:22] if you believe it believe it
[1:45:28] hallelujah they didn't go to church on
[1:45:31] sunday and talk about that name and then
[1:45:33] forget about it the rest of the week
[1:45:35] they didn't give lip service to that
[1:45:38] name
[1:45:41] no sir it was their lives
[1:45:44] that were given they just took their
[1:45:47] life and said you know what lord here it
[1:45:49] is what do you want to do with me
[1:45:51] this lady i was witnessing to i i was
[1:45:53] talking to her
[1:45:54] about the fox book of martyrs
[1:45:58] and she goes oh i don't like books like
[1:46:00] that and i said
[1:46:01] you need to read it because it's a
[1:46:03] reminder
[1:46:05] to a christian of the courage
[1:46:08] that god can give to you and i we are
[1:46:11] not puppets
[1:46:12] we are not pawns we are not cowards we
[1:46:15] are
[1:46:15] stalwart soldiers of this cross
[1:46:18] hallelujah amen no sir it was our lives
[1:46:21] that were given all they did they did in
[1:46:23] that name and in that name they acted
[1:46:25] and if they could not act in that name
[1:46:28] then they refrained from acting now i'm
[1:46:30] going to be real blunt and bold this
[1:46:31] morning saints we need to apply that
[1:46:34] that little sentence is right there we
[1:46:36] need to not be going out and doing this
[1:46:37] and then oh lord forgive me
[1:46:39] many of the behaviors that we have oh
[1:46:41] i'm preaching to you paul
[1:46:42] amen many of these behaviors that we
[1:46:44] have many of these little petty things
[1:46:46] we have to deal with
[1:46:47] we knew that we shouldn't do that
[1:46:51] it's not why the devil tricked me no we
[1:46:53] gave ourself to it
[1:46:55] oh i know that might skin some of you
[1:46:57] and if i didn't get down to blood let me
[1:46:58] come and try and skin you again
[1:47:01] my brother and sister we need to cut out
[1:47:03] the nonsense
[1:47:05] we need to cut out the nonsense but if
[1:47:07] they couldn't act in that name
[1:47:09] then they refrained from acting that
[1:47:11] leave a lot of us silent and seated
[1:47:13] they were heavily placed christians by
[1:47:15] whose behavior was in
[1:47:17] the lord but that false vine group that
[1:47:19] wanted to defile that name
[1:47:21] hung like skulking wolves in the dark
[1:47:25] waiting to get in and tear down
[1:47:30] wow this last line
[1:47:34] is what the inspiration to me was but
[1:47:37] the saints
[1:47:39] stood the test hallelujah
[1:47:42] kept the word and the name
[1:47:46] hallelujah i don't care how many wolves
[1:47:48] you know i've kind of been on a terror
[1:47:49] forgive me
[1:47:50] just saints i i don't want to distract
[1:47:52] the church with the things that disturb
[1:47:54] me and
[1:47:55] whatever you just have to forgive me
[1:47:57] right because i i promise you i want to
[1:47:59] be the kind of pastor
[1:48:00] that lays down in the gate of the sheep
[1:48:02] fold i want to smell like the sheep and
[1:48:03] when it snows
[1:48:04] i don't care the snow get on me i want
[1:48:07] the sheep to be safe
[1:48:08] when the wolf is circling i don't want
[1:48:10] to come and say i'm afraid of the wolf
[1:48:12] i want god to anoint me to lay or stand
[1:48:15] in that gate and say i know a wolf when
[1:48:17] i see one
[1:48:18] and i might hit back on these things and
[1:48:20] i know it's disappointed some of you
[1:48:21] that i've hit on these things
[1:48:23] but my brother and sister if god lays on
[1:48:25] my heart to defend
[1:48:27] and to stand and to warn
[1:48:30] amen i have to do that i can't sit back
[1:48:33] and say well that's too bad
[1:48:35] the devil just drugged some of our young
[1:48:37] people out and
[1:48:38] killed them
[1:48:46] no sir no sir we'll
[1:48:49] fight him right now to the very last
[1:48:53] drop of strength that is within us
[1:48:57] and we'll identify it and we'll bear the
[1:48:59] burden but the saints stood
[1:49:01] the test and kept the word in the name
[1:49:04] this
[1:49:04] is after the wolf come in the dark
[1:49:07] trying to get in and tear it down
[1:49:09] the saints were still standing oh
[1:49:11] hallelujah that makes me excited
[1:49:13] we ain't gonna be out here saying it's
[1:49:15] too bad the church was decimated by a
[1:49:17] spirit
[1:49:18] no sir there's gonna be wolves there
[1:49:20] might be scars there might
[1:49:21] be a little blood shed there might be a
[1:49:22] little unhappiness go around
[1:49:24] but in the end the saints will still be
[1:49:27] standing
[1:49:28] hallelujah now i i don't mean to just
[1:49:32] take this humorous i
[1:49:33] want you to say lord reveal the depth of
[1:49:35] what brother paul's fixing to put on the
[1:49:37] screen to me okay
[1:49:38] can you say that amen
[1:49:50] i can't tell you how many times i've
[1:49:51] heard people say well
[1:49:53] that man tells it like it is he did but
[1:49:56] the problem was he added to it or took
[1:49:58] away from it
[1:50:00] he told it to you in a way that was
[1:50:02] appealing to you
[1:50:04] he told it to you in a way that you did
[1:50:06] not realize
[1:50:08] that he is a wolf
[1:50:12] and people find that offensive my phone
[1:50:16] has rang and
[1:50:17] whatever and people were offended my
[1:50:19] brother and sister i'm sorry
[1:50:22] when i see a wolf i don't care if he's
[1:50:24] wearing a suit and tie
[1:50:25] what we don't see here maybe if i was
[1:50:27] going to expand this
[1:50:28] until a complete uh
[1:50:31] thought concerning the church it might
[1:50:33] be a bigger picture and this guy might
[1:50:35] have a bible
[1:50:38] this guy might have a message book
[1:50:42] [Applause]
[1:50:43] but you see when it's just that one word
[1:50:45] off he might as well be
[1:50:47] saying i'm going to eat you
[1:50:54] and it's just a cartoon saints this
[1:50:57] cartoonist has some others that were
[1:50:59] quite interesting too but you see
[1:51:03] might tell it like it is we're all just
[1:51:06] sinners saved by grace aren't we glad
[1:51:08] god sent a prophet to this day
[1:51:09] hallelujah we have revelation that the
[1:51:11] world don't have we're standing upon the
[1:51:14] revealed word of god
[1:51:16] a wolf can say that
[1:51:25] okay i think i'm finally getting my axe
[1:51:28] ground down
[1:51:29] saints because you see i want to make it
[1:51:31] clear to you
[1:51:33] you that are here in grace and you that
[1:51:34] might be listening at some other time i
[1:51:36] want to make it clear to you
[1:51:38] the wolf doesn't have to be the one that
[1:51:40] comes in here
[1:51:41] and just openly twists this message
[1:51:44] comes in here and openly tries to get
[1:51:47] you to one side or the other
[1:51:49] this wolf can invite you to dinner
[1:51:56] come on do you get it this wolf will
[1:51:59] invite you to dinner only he didn't have
[1:52:00] anything other than
[1:52:02] you hallelujah and when it's all done
[1:52:07] all that you were will have been
[1:52:08] consumed by him
[1:52:11] oh you're still living you're still
[1:52:12] breathing you got a house a car a job a
[1:52:14] family
[1:52:15] but you've been consumed by that i'll
[1:52:18] tell you what i want you to be consumed
[1:52:19] by
[1:52:20] it's right here i want you to eat this
[1:52:24] and when it's bitter in your belly i
[1:52:25] want you to say
[1:52:26] thank you lord thank you lord that your
[1:52:30] word you love me so much you'd correct
[1:52:32] me
[1:52:34] hallelujah amen
[1:52:39] well praise the lord
[1:52:44] works his faith expressed you know
[1:52:46] there's some people that dates
[1:52:48] when the message is preached matters to
[1:52:50] them i find that rather amazing myself
[1:52:52] now i realize brother branham's
[1:52:54] uh revelation in the message as god was
[1:52:56] dealing with brother branham
[1:52:58] it had a subtle shift do you understand
[1:53:00] what i'm saying
[1:53:01] what it was in 1947 was not what it was
[1:53:04] in 1965 right god dealt with him
[1:53:07] amen what the what the horse riders were
[1:53:09] different things like that god
[1:53:10] god revealing or opening it to the
[1:53:12] prophet right
[1:53:13] so so i i just want you to understand
[1:53:16] that amen
[1:53:17] so there's some people though that are
[1:53:18] like well that was preached before the
[1:53:20] seals it doesn't matter
[1:53:22] okay well you know they don't get much
[1:53:25] later than this one right here
[1:53:28] so if we're playing trump cards amen
[1:53:32] it don't get much later than this right
[1:53:33] here like they did on the day of
[1:53:35] pentecost they laughed and said these
[1:53:37] men are full of new wine
[1:53:39] they know it was it was a great thing to
[1:53:41] those it was happening to
[1:53:46] yes sir excuse me for a moment
[1:53:50] great thing to those happening to it's a
[1:53:54] great thing to those i'm not saying it
[1:53:55] has to happen to everybody in this way
[1:53:57] but it's a great thing when god wakes
[1:53:58] you up in the middle of the night speaks
[1:53:59] to you
[1:54:00] it's a great thing when the word of god
[1:54:02] speaks to you it's a great thing when
[1:54:04] the message of god speaks to you
[1:54:06] it's a great thing when the holy ghost
[1:54:07] comes down and just lays on your heart
[1:54:09] to pray for someone and you find a days
[1:54:12] weeks or
[1:54:12] maybe months later that in that very
[1:54:15] time frame someone was going through a
[1:54:16] great trial
[1:54:18] it's a great thing to know that god said
[1:54:20] you're connected you're connected you're
[1:54:22] connected
[1:54:23] oh hallelujah it was a great thing to
[1:54:25] those it was happening to why it was god
[1:54:27] revealing himself to the individuals
[1:54:30] okay now we'll get this right down
[1:54:35] is there revelation outside of what god
[1:54:38] revealed to the prophet
[1:54:40] yes we can have an argument now can't we
[1:54:47] there's nothing outside what the prophet
[1:54:49] brought
[1:54:52] i want you to hold that this great
[1:54:55] debate
[1:54:58] it was god revealing himself to the
[1:55:00] individuals while others laughed
[1:55:02] these were rejoicing it was an in
[1:55:05] individual revelation
[1:55:06] which is faith faith that's revealed if
[1:55:09] it wasn't faith then it wouldn't
[1:55:11] even be there it was faith just seeds
[1:55:14] have to have
[1:55:15] the ground prepared first therefore all
[1:55:17] he foreknew
[1:55:18] he called all he called all he for knew
[1:55:20] he predestinated
[1:55:21] if you want to read that romans 8 28 34
[1:55:24] and
[1:55:25] also ephesians 1 1 through 5 see all he
[1:55:27] foreknew he did call and only called he
[1:55:30] justified and all he justified
[1:55:32] he has already glorified there's
[1:55:35] nothing out of order amen
[1:55:39] we think there is but look in the
[1:55:40] scripture it's just hitting exactly the
[1:55:43] way god's word said it would
[1:55:44] we see the message is rejected today
[1:55:47] isn't that just what the scripture said
[1:55:49] they would do
[1:55:49] now i want to speak to that for a minute
[1:55:51] my brother and sister it is
[1:55:53] here in this way i have encountered this
[1:55:55] let's not hear say this is not
[1:55:57] an ideology my brother and sister people
[1:55:59] are like well
[1:56:00] uh we witnessed the message to this
[1:56:02] individual
[1:56:03] we spoke to these over here and they
[1:56:05] rejected it
[1:56:09] i believe the message and i would reject
[1:56:11] your version of it too
[1:56:15] that's kind of blunt isn't it
[1:56:18] and you know why
[1:56:21] because it doesn't line up with the word
[1:56:26] what i want to do saints and i encourage
[1:56:28] you to do
[1:56:29] is when you witness or you teach your
[1:56:31] children
[1:56:33] you put this bible right out there and
[1:56:35] say here
[1:56:36] is our foundation not what we think
[1:56:40] not what this man said not what that man
[1:56:42] said but right here
[1:56:43] children neighbor friend
[1:56:47] here it is hallelujah
[1:56:54] my paul you can sure dig a hole
[1:56:57] amen yes sir isn't that just what the
[1:57:01] scripture said they would do sure
[1:57:03] all these things are ordained of god oh
[1:57:05] it should make you walk happy
[1:57:08] that's a trouble with we today so much
[1:57:11] difference
[1:57:11] than the christians of old hmm oh my
[1:57:14] there's a difference
[1:57:16] when the real true revelation of jesus
[1:57:18] christ being emmanuel
[1:57:20] dwelled in the hearts of those men they
[1:57:22] were rugged people
[1:57:24] oh come on saints if we don't fit this
[1:57:26] right here then i ask you don't get
[1:57:28] offended change
[1:57:30] but today we're padded by the
[1:57:32] denominations in the message
[1:57:34] i mean i'm we're padded by the
[1:57:35] denominations with oh
[1:57:38] i tell you they ain't got no revelation
[1:57:44] i've run into in africa i've run into it
[1:57:46] in europe i've run it in south america
[1:57:48] and i've run into it in the state idaho
[1:57:53] they ain't gotten up the revelation you
[1:57:55] come over here
[1:57:57] you're depending on their revelation
[1:58:01] if their revelations isn't according to
[1:58:03] the word of god then it's wrong
[1:58:05] mine or anybody else's that's where the
[1:58:07] showdown comes
[1:58:09] the word of god tells which is right
[1:58:13] and wrong oh my
[1:58:17] my brother and sister it don't matter if
[1:58:19] they were with the prophet or best
[1:58:20] friends with everybody that was friends
[1:58:22] with the prophet
[1:58:23] my brother and sister a prophet of god
[1:58:25] says go back to
[1:58:26] that word hallelujah
[1:58:30] hallelujah i i hope you guys aren't
[1:58:33] aren't too tired
[1:58:38] or too hungry or too thirsty
[1:58:42] amen okay we now come to a conclusion
[1:58:46] such conclusion as we have already found
[1:58:49] in the word amen
[1:58:50] as much as we believe in trying to find
[1:58:52] the oldest and best manuscripts
[1:58:54] to get the best record of the word
[1:58:56] possible we will never get the true
[1:58:58] meaning of it
[1:58:59] by study or comparison of scriptures
[1:59:02] sincere
[1:59:03] as we may be now don't read any further
[1:59:05] saints
[1:59:14] you see the prophet of god if you'll
[1:59:18] study the message
[1:59:20] warns us of an intellectual spirit
[1:59:26] that will come into the church
[1:59:31] that intellectual spirit will believe
[1:59:34] because they can tie these things
[1:59:38] together
[1:59:42] but intellectualism will never give
[1:59:46] life to the word
[1:59:49] intellectualism will tell you the
[1:59:52] tolerances
[1:59:54] as i joke our brother doug baker's
[1:59:57] pastor and a church down there in
[1:59:59] phoenix and brother doug says you know
[2:00:01] and people are always using phrases like
[2:00:03] well you know that's not rocket science
[2:00:05] where brother doug was a rocket
[2:00:06] scientist
[2:00:09] and he says no this this word is rocket
[2:00:12] science
[2:00:15] see in a rocket when they make a missile
[2:00:18] i believe where he worked down there at
[2:00:19] one time
[2:00:20] i don't know they made the thor missile
[2:00:24] the tolerances are to the
[2:00:27] hundreds of thousands of an inch
[2:00:33] now let me entertain this thought in
[2:00:35] your mind
[2:00:36] he said if a man would add one word
[2:00:41] to or take one word
[2:00:45] away his name would be removed from the
[2:00:48] book
[2:00:49] and he would be cursed how tight
[2:00:55] pretty tight pretty tight
[2:00:59] he didn't say one big word he said
[2:01:02] one word you see
[2:01:06] oftentimes in our human vocabulary we
[2:01:08] use the word i think
[2:01:10] and we don't want to be too critical of
[2:01:11] each other it's a expression
[2:01:15] but remember that wolf we were talking
[2:01:16] to
[2:01:18] he thinks also
[2:01:23] i think you see we need to when we
[2:01:26] approach the word
[2:01:27] remove that i think that's right the
[2:01:30] word says it
[2:01:31] amen i don't necessarily understand it
[2:01:33] but lord i believe it
[2:01:35] then let that become life and then god
[2:01:37] will expand
[2:01:38] your understanding to all catch us
[2:01:42] to all that is necessary to make a
[2:01:45] rapture
[2:01:48] i don't need to know one more thing
[2:01:50] that's right than what it takes to make
[2:01:52] a rapture
[2:01:53] i don't need to be able to explain
[2:01:55] creation
[2:01:56] i don't need to explain whether there
[2:01:58] was a prior civilization we was having
[2:02:00] that
[2:02:00] lovely conversation the other day uh we
[2:02:02] don't know what was out there i don't
[2:02:04] need to explain that i don't need to
[2:02:05] know
[2:02:06] right where did the where did the you
[2:02:08] know the
[2:02:10] whatever you call an elephant that was
[2:02:12] froze in the ice where did he come from
[2:02:14] i don't need to know i don't need to
[2:02:18] know how
[2:02:18] this all works what i do know is my god
[2:02:21] is perfect
[2:02:23] that's what i need to know now see
[2:02:26] we can do study and comparison sincere
[2:02:29] as we may be
[2:02:31] i've dealt with people that you'd be
[2:02:32] talking about something in the message
[2:02:34] and they will throw 10 12 15 quotes at
[2:02:37] you
[2:02:38] that's why you're wrong but you see
[2:02:42] they missed a couple key components
[2:02:46] it's not about how
[2:02:49] you come about it's whether you believe
[2:02:52] it will come about i can't explain a
[2:02:55] body change
[2:02:57] but i'm going to take one and people
[2:03:00] will come and they might make a comment
[2:03:02] you see they don't see they don't
[2:03:03] understand and my brother and sister i'm
[2:03:06] sorry
[2:03:06] i'm not going to fight about it people
[2:03:08] they feel like they defeated you on the
[2:03:10] idea because you didn't push back
[2:03:12] but you see i'm not going to fight about
[2:03:14] it if you don't believe that god is in
[2:03:16] you
[2:03:17] i'm not going to fight with you
[2:03:21] but there is over 100 quotes the prophet
[2:03:22] says that god's in you just in case you
[2:03:25] need something to back up to that
[2:03:28] it will take listen it will take a
[2:03:31] revelation from
[2:03:33] god to bring it out that is exactly what
[2:03:36] paul said which things we also
[2:03:38] speak not in words which man's wisdom
[2:03:40] teaches
[2:03:41] but which the holy ghost teaches first
[2:03:44] corinthians 2 13
[2:03:45] the true revelation is god interpreting
[2:03:49] his own word
[2:03:50] by vindicating what is promised now i'm
[2:03:53] telling you my brother and sister i read
[2:03:55] my bible it says there is a lamb's wife
[2:03:57] and she's making herself ready you know
[2:03:59] what vindicated that scripture
[2:04:01] you did you did you did you did you did
[2:04:04] you did you did you did
[2:04:06] amen you can look at that and say well
[2:04:08] okay that's to happen
[2:04:09] but if you don't believe it is happening
[2:04:11] in you it will pass right over you
[2:04:14] it will leave you sitting there
[2:04:16] questioning well how can this be and how
[2:04:18] can that be
[2:04:19] and someone else said this and someone
[2:04:21] else said that my brother and sister
[2:04:23] don't allow that to happen
[2:04:25] god's word says that you step and say
[2:04:27] lord i don't understand but i want to
[2:04:30] and i believe it amen and you will move
[2:04:33] forward
[2:04:34] because i'll tell you my brother and
[2:04:35] sister the prophet of god showed us
[2:04:37] quite clearly
[2:04:38] in the message in his word speaking but
[2:04:39] he backed it up in the bible
[2:04:41] that they would come in this
[2:04:43] intellectual age in an intellectual
[2:04:45] spirit
[2:04:45] and they would tie you in knots
[2:04:47] concerning the bible
[2:04:49] but the spirit of life which is the holy
[2:04:51] ghost is not in them
[2:04:52] they have an intellectual spirit
[2:04:56] and i'm telling you you can take the
[2:04:57] simplicity of this gospel
[2:04:59] and apply it to a drunk a drug addict
[2:05:02] a prostitute whatever you want to talk
[2:05:05] about
[2:05:06] and i'm not so much in the united states
[2:05:08] but in south america
[2:05:09] god has allowed me to deal with every
[2:05:11] one of those kind
[2:05:12] amen homosexuals we have seen it all i
[2:05:15] don't want to dwell on all that negative
[2:05:17] side of that
[2:05:17] and i have by god's grace seen
[2:05:20] delivering
[2:05:21] power come and take a young lady that
[2:05:24] had already moved in the direction
[2:05:26] of giving herself to men and figuring
[2:05:28] out i can make money doing this and god
[2:05:31] deliver her
[2:05:32] i'm banned in a homosexual relationship
[2:05:35] crying out to god
[2:05:36] brother paul will god forgive me and i
[2:05:39] speak in terms that i know not
[2:05:41] of and the man comes back and not only
[2:05:43] did god restore him
[2:05:45] to his marriage and to his children he
[2:05:47] restored him to the household of faith
[2:05:50] i have seen these things these are not
[2:05:52] fairy tales
[2:05:53] these are not all that happened to
[2:05:54] brother branham's time that happened in
[2:05:56] days gone by
[2:05:57] why my brother and sister because we
[2:06:00] come to the place
[2:06:01] this is what the word is teaching us
[2:06:04] this is john 1 in the beginning was the
[2:06:08] word and the word was with god
[2:06:09] and the word was god this is god
[2:06:13] hallelujah we shouldn't have to be
[2:06:15] taught we should be believing
[2:06:18] we should be saying lord open my eyes
[2:06:21] then i can see
[2:06:22] and then let me take this word and apply
[2:06:25] it to my life
[2:06:27] there's the life changing we can talk
[2:06:30] about well i believe the message
[2:06:31] you don't go to church you don't pray
[2:06:34] you don't read your bible
[2:06:35] you don't witness you don't do none of
[2:06:37] these things and you say i believe
[2:06:39] i question that i'm sorry that's blunt
[2:06:42] but it's the truth
[2:06:44] you see my brother and sister it's not
[2:06:46] what man's wisdom
[2:06:48] teaches but what the holy ghost teaches
[2:06:50] see that true revelation is god
[2:06:52] interpreting his
[2:06:53] own word by vindicating what his promise
[2:06:56] now don't let anyone be misled by what
[2:06:58] i've said and think that i do not
[2:07:00] believe in the accuracy of the word as
[2:07:01] we now have it
[2:07:03] i believe the bible is accurate
[2:07:06] jesus completely authenticated the old
[2:07:08] testament when here on earth
[2:07:10] and it was compiled exactly as was our
[2:07:13] new testament
[2:07:14] make no mistake about it we have the
[2:07:16] infallible word of god today
[2:07:19] and no man dares take from it or add to
[2:07:21] it but we need the same
[2:07:23] spirit that gave it to teach it
[2:07:27] to us not an intellectual spirit
[2:07:31] not not an academic type approach to
[2:07:33] this message
[2:07:34] but let let's let's pray oh god help us
[2:07:38] saints let us pray that the holy ghost
[2:07:41] will come down in this church
[2:07:42] in our midst and teach us this word
[2:07:46] amen it's not enough to say i believe
[2:07:49] my the prophet showed us the devil
[2:07:51] believes
[2:07:53] but we need that same spirit that gave
[2:07:55] it to teach it to us
[2:07:56] oh how we need revelation by the spirit
[2:07:59] we don't need a new bible
[2:08:01] we don't need a new translation though
[2:08:03] some are very good i'm not against them
[2:08:05] but we need the revelation of the spirit
[2:08:08] and thank god we can have what we need
[2:08:11] for god wants to
[2:08:13] reveal his word to us by his spirit
[2:08:16] now look at this closing out the service
[2:08:18] i've been long enough forgive me
[2:08:21] may god begin by spirit to give us
[2:08:25] do you believe in the value of words i'm
[2:08:28] sorry i believe in the value of words
[2:08:32] may god begin by spirit to give us what
[2:08:36] is that word
[2:08:38] continuous
[2:08:42] yes that's right the word continuous
[2:08:44] also has a context of lasting
[2:08:47] never ending always present available
[2:08:53] by his spirit to give us a never-ending
[2:08:58] life-giving
[2:09:02] what's that word
[2:09:07] hallelujah
[2:09:12] oh where am i i'm so lost
[2:09:17] hallelujah i guess i quit preaching from
[2:09:21] my notes quite a while ago it's probably
[2:09:22] obvious
[2:09:31] i am lost oh there we are praise the
[2:09:35] lord
[2:09:36] i was lost but now i'm found
[2:09:40] amen to give us continuous
[2:09:43] unending life-giving and the word
[2:09:46] prevailing
[2:09:47] now has you know the english language
[2:09:50] has several
[2:09:52] definitions mostly for every word but
[2:09:54] one of those of the word prevailing is
[2:09:55] current
[2:09:59] may the lord give us an unending
[2:10:01] life-giving
[2:10:02] and current revelation
[2:10:07] you see we're not moving not one iota
[2:10:10] from the message the prophet brought us
[2:10:15] but we are led by the holy spirit to
[2:10:18] recognize
[2:10:19] that open word for november 1st
[2:10:23] 2020. i don't have to look to 1961
[2:10:27] something
[2:10:29] i don't have to look back to to spurgeon
[2:10:32] and tozer
[2:10:33] and wesley and luther i don't have to
[2:10:36] look back
[2:10:37] there's an open word that's right here
[2:10:40] today god having opened that
[2:10:44] to us now our only duty saints that we
[2:10:47] have
[2:10:48] is to apply it all we have to do is
[2:10:52] implement the word that has been given
[2:10:55] to
[2:10:55] us oh if the church
[2:10:59] well now if nothing's changed
[2:11:04] please don't think i'm being facetious
[2:11:05] but these spirits are out there i've
[2:11:08] dealt with them
[2:11:10] they don't think one thing has changed
[2:11:11] since the prophet left the scene
[2:11:14] well i'll tell you why i'll argue with
[2:11:15] him
[2:11:17] i was about
[2:11:22] what would i bend december 61
[2:11:25] december 65 four
[2:11:28] four years old
[2:11:32] my comprehension of the word of god at
[2:11:34] four years old was zero
[2:11:38] i'll tell you what's changed this book
[2:11:41] has been opened and i see myself in that
[2:11:45] book
[2:11:46] and there was a time i said i'm done
[2:11:48] with this and i ran and i ran and i went
[2:11:50] and i lived other places and i didn't
[2:11:52] live a horrible sinful life saints don't
[2:11:54] misunderstand
[2:11:55] god preserved me on that part
[2:11:59] and i ran and i ran around and god let
[2:12:01] me run so far that i got back and i was
[2:12:03] at the starting point
[2:12:05] hallelujah i say thank you lord amen
[2:12:09] but you see the revelation of the
[2:12:11] message now this will sound a little
[2:12:13] blunt i'm sorry
[2:12:14] but the revelation of the message
[2:12:18] in the late 70s and the early 80s
[2:12:22] was you will do this and you will do
[2:12:25] this
[2:12:25] and you will not do this and if you
[2:12:28] don't do what your pastor says and if
[2:12:30] you don't this and if you don't do this
[2:12:33] hmm some of us me as a teenager i
[2:12:36] thought i was in prison
[2:12:39] i wanted to go to the movie theater
[2:12:42] but i was going to hell if i went to the
[2:12:43] movie theater and that's probably
[2:12:45] correct
[2:12:47] but the problem was they made it a rule
[2:12:51] not a relationship and the message
[2:12:54] the word of god has went from rules of
[2:12:57] do and don't
[2:12:59] has went to the relationship where you
[2:13:01] say i want to please you lord
[2:13:03] amen the prophet said that those movie
[2:13:05] theaters had demons hanging everywhere
[2:13:07] lord i don't want to be around those
[2:13:08] demons
[2:13:09] that's right i don't want to do that i
[2:13:11] might accidentally drag one of those
[2:13:12] things to the house of god
[2:13:14] no i won't do that you see my brother
[2:13:16] and sister
[2:13:17] if the church could only get
[2:13:21] a fresh revelation my my brother and
[2:13:24] sister
[2:13:25] he says here that his spirit give us a
[2:13:26] continued life-giving and prevailing
[2:13:28] revelation
[2:13:29] he goes on to say if the church should
[2:13:31] only get a fresh revelation
[2:13:33] now did he mean that we're going to have
[2:13:35] something that surpasses the
[2:13:37] prophet to laodicea no sir but the word
[2:13:40] that is here before us now be opened
[2:13:44] once again
[2:13:45] come alive to us where our hearts
[2:13:49] burn within us amen not just
[2:13:53] a church experience not just if mama
[2:13:56] quits if daddy quits i guess i have to
[2:13:58] quit
[2:13:58] or vice versa my brother and sister but
[2:14:01] a real burning desire
[2:14:03] a living word manifested
[2:14:06] what is that this open word fresh
[2:14:09] revelation
[2:14:10] is creating a bride that is a living
[2:14:14] word manifested
[2:14:17] it's not just a bunch of people that say
[2:14:19] i believe the message we go to this
[2:14:20] convention tell everybody praise the
[2:14:22] lord brother so-and-so is my pastor
[2:14:27] i always found that offensive isn't that
[2:14:30] terrible
[2:14:33] but then the word said i need to be a
[2:14:35] rugged christian so i'm going to put all
[2:14:36] of those offenses behind me
[2:14:38] amen and i'm just going to stand on the
[2:14:40] word and say you know what it doesn't
[2:14:41] matter
[2:14:43] you guys don't know what the world's
[2:14:44] like
[2:14:46] that wasn't fair to say was it you guys
[2:14:48] don't know what it's like in the world
[2:14:49] of being around message ministers
[2:14:53] hmm how many people in your church
[2:14:56] brother
[2:15:00] well how big is your church brother
[2:15:06] well let's just say your four years
[2:15:07] bigger than our whole building
[2:15:10] we'll get that over with and praise the
[2:15:13] lord we'll settle another thing right
[2:15:14] here i'd rather have a hundred
[2:15:16] faithful than 500 that were well anyway
[2:15:22] no we live in that world those spirits
[2:15:24] don't go away saints
[2:15:26] what we want is we want a fresh
[2:15:28] revelation
[2:15:29] and that is not a new idea on the word
[2:15:32] but that is god coming to us his mercies
[2:15:35] new every morning oh sister emmy come
[2:15:39] before i just keep going
[2:15:40] on and on and on
[2:15:46] hallelujah look
[2:15:49] i didn't touch on a couple things so
[2:15:50] this might seem a little kilter to you
[2:15:53] but all the authority that the word has
[2:15:55] given to us
[2:15:57] declares that we are sons and daughters
[2:15:59] of god i have the authority to claim
[2:16:01] that
[2:16:02] amen the word says we're overcomers the
[2:16:05] word says we're part of the bride of
[2:16:07] christ
[2:16:07] the word says we are chosen amen
[2:16:10] this is not something saints to give lip
[2:16:13] service to
[2:16:14] this is not something i encourage you
[2:16:17] now i'm not condemning i'm not speaking
[2:16:18] down to any one of you
[2:16:19] but i'm encouraging i want you to see
[2:16:21] the picture of laodicea
[2:16:23] that would come to the place that we
[2:16:24] believe by just acknowledging
[2:16:27] that it's okay but there comes a time
[2:16:29] and a place we have to
[2:16:30] implement it we have to implement this
[2:16:33] word in our life
[2:16:34] i say this morning you need healing
[2:16:36] believe you're healed
[2:16:38] declare i'm healed amen you need a
[2:16:40] deliverance believe your deliver
[2:16:43] and step forward and say i'm delivered i
[2:16:45] don't care whether it's from something
[2:16:47] in your mind
[2:16:48] some affliction or whatever some
[2:16:49] addiction or whatever it might be
[2:16:51] stand up and say i am delivered
[2:16:56] no question mark no commas no dot
[2:16:59] dot dots no second guessing i'm
[2:17:01] delivered
[2:17:03] amen some would say well i need guidance
[2:17:05] in my life i don't even know what to do
[2:17:07] he says he's your counselor and guide
[2:17:09] believe him
[2:17:11] amen you say i need more of god i you
[2:17:14] just stand up and say i believe
[2:17:16] the holy ghost is here to lead me oh
[2:17:19] but it's so easy to go well if and i and
[2:17:22] that and
[2:17:23] and mama says this and daddy says this
[2:17:25] and our old pastor i love that one
[2:17:29] the church you left you're still quoting
[2:17:31] that pastor
[2:17:34] my old pastor says
[2:17:38] well sister jerry handed me a deal here
[2:17:39] a while back and i have to at church we
[2:17:42] have a terrible sense of humor
[2:17:44] a terrible sense of humor we were going
[2:17:47] to hang it on the board in the foyer
[2:17:48] there
[2:17:49] and it was talking about you came from
[2:17:51] there to hear but you want here to be
[2:17:52] like there but if you were there and
[2:17:54] liked it so much why are you here
[2:17:56] [Music]
[2:18:00] come on you want to walk through life
[2:18:03] quoting your old pastor why don't you go
[2:18:05] to church with your old pastor
[2:18:08] amen what i want to do is quote the word
[2:18:10] i want to quote this message
[2:18:12] i want to quote that there's life here
[2:18:14] amen it's current it's fresh
[2:18:17] we don't need lip service saints let's
[2:18:19] just drop all our excuses you know
[2:18:21] that's what excuses are their lip
[2:18:22] service the reason i can't is
[2:18:27] has nothing to do with it usually what
[2:18:30] we voice has nothing to do with it i'm
[2:18:32] not talking about that saying well i was
[2:18:33] in church on wednesday because i had
[2:18:34] vertigo
[2:18:35] i don't believe that's a lip service
[2:18:37] amen you know i would have walked into
[2:18:39] church i would like that you probably
[2:18:40] would have been entertained i'd walked
[2:18:42] in here
[2:18:42] [Music]
[2:18:45] imagine if i'd have preached i'd
[2:18:47] probably been falling down on the
[2:18:48] platform
[2:18:50] but you know what i'm talking about that
[2:18:52] real
[2:18:53] living word
[2:18:57] satan says well this is why it was the
[2:19:00] way you was raised
[2:19:01] that's why you're like you are my god's
[2:19:04] a deliverer
[2:19:06] i would do this and this because but
[2:19:08] this and this no you're giving lip
[2:19:09] service
[2:19:10] or god's greater than any kind of excuse
[2:19:13] our god's greater than laodicea our god
[2:19:16] has already vanquished every enemy our
[2:19:18] god
[2:19:18] has already declared he's the overcomer
[2:19:21] his word has already showed us where the
[2:19:23] devil's going
[2:19:24] my maybe we forgot to read the end of
[2:19:26] the book maybe we need to go into
[2:19:27] revelation read the end of the book
[2:19:29] remind ourselves that what god said
[2:19:32] and how he declared it would end up oh
[2:19:35] hallelujah
[2:19:37] we don't need lip service we need to
[2:19:39] believe
[2:19:40] hallelujah let's just stand worship the
[2:19:42] lord probably burnt up a good pot roast
[2:19:45] somewhere
[2:19:45] forgive me but you know some of you are
[2:19:48] the cause of this problem
[2:19:51] hallelujah i'm serious i'm serious some
[2:19:54] of you are the cause of this problem

[2:21:00] little tightness on the end go all the

[2:23:40] i exalted
[2:23:51] i just feel led to clarify one thing
[2:23:53] before we move on
[2:23:55] my brother and sister i don't believe
[2:23:57] there's one word to be added or taken
[2:23:59] away from
[2:24:00] the message that brother branham was
[2:24:01] commissioned to bring
[2:24:04] you see when we talk about new
[2:24:06] revelation
[2:24:07] as sons and daughters of god that's the
[2:24:10] word
[2:24:11] being open to you amen
[2:24:15] you see there might be something that
[2:24:16] you have a great strength in your life
[2:24:20] and you have something that's a weakness
[2:24:23] we can stand solo and say praise the
[2:24:25] lord i understand this god dealt with me
[2:24:27] and this is
[2:24:28] good but you see god can come down and
[2:24:30] reveal
[2:24:32] the avenue to defeat that weakness it
[2:24:35] becomes revelation to you
[2:24:37] it becomes revelation some find it my
[2:24:39] brother and sister i'll just share this
[2:24:41] just real quick
[2:24:42] down in chile a family there husband and
[2:24:44] wife
[2:24:46] they wait on sister jerry and i hand in
[2:24:48] foot and
[2:24:49] i kind of you might say rebuke the
[2:24:51] brother i said brother that's fine we're
[2:24:54] we're healthy we can get up we can get
[2:24:55] our own drink we can
[2:24:57] you know get get more butter we can do
[2:24:59] whatever
[2:25:01] and i kid you not this is the truth he
[2:25:03] come up to me
[2:25:04] laid his hands on my shoulders
[2:25:07] and said you don't understand brother
[2:25:09] paul this
[2:25:11] is the ministry god gave me
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:17] to humble myself
[2:25:20] to serve god's people
[2:25:24] and it struck me at first i thought he
[2:25:26] was just speaking kind words but then i
[2:25:28] realized
[2:25:30] he truly meant to humble himself
[2:25:34] and he looked me in the face and says
[2:25:36] please don't rob me
[2:25:37] of my blessing you see my brother and
[2:25:41] sister
[2:25:42] [Music]
[2:25:43] we often don't think that we need
[2:25:46] humbling
[2:25:48] but god knows how to humble us god
[2:25:51] humbled that brother
[2:25:53] and it became a commitment that him and
[2:25:54] his wife gave they said this is what we
[2:25:57] can do we're not preachers we're not
[2:25:58] this we're not that we don't sing we
[2:26:00] don't play instruments
[2:26:01] but we can serve and that become their
[2:26:05] identity
[2:26:06] they're known in the church for that
[2:26:08] right there and they do it sincerely
[2:26:11] not laboriously not as under obligation
[2:26:14] but i can serve i can serve
[2:26:18] and buy that god humbled this man and
[2:26:21] his wife
[2:26:23] from kind of a haughty spirit
[2:26:26] oh my brother and sister go ask him
[2:26:30] i might help you with your plane ticket
[2:26:32] but i won't buy it
[2:26:34] but you can go look them in the face and
[2:26:35] ask them what happened
[2:26:37] and then this they'll tell you we
[2:26:39] realized one day
[2:26:41] we're only as good
[2:26:44] as the spirit by which we serve god
[2:26:48] i want you to think about that in
[2:26:50] closing you're only
[2:26:53] as close to god as you are by the spirit
[2:26:57] by which you serve him oh my brother and
[2:27:00] sister
[2:27:01] god help us god help us

[2:27:10] time
[2:27:11] but praise the lord there is a fountain
[2:27:14] open in the house of david

[2:27:36] sorry to admit this but
[2:27:38] the rest of life sometimes seems to be
[2:27:39] dominated
[2:27:41] by the need to earn a living to pay some
[2:27:43] bills
[2:27:44] to turn around and do it again and again
[2:27:47] and again
[2:27:49] god help us break the shackles of this
[2:27:52] earth
