TRANSCRIPT
========================================
washed by the water of the word. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's go to number 651, please. KFC. [Music] I know not why God's wonderous grace to me he hath made known. For why unworthy Christ in love redeemed before his own. But I know who I have believed it and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. Oh, I know not how this saving faith to me he did in part. Or how believing in his word brought peace within my heart. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. I know not how the spirit moves, convincing men of sin, revealing Jesus through the word, creating faith in him. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. Oh, I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for me. Of weery ways or golden days before his face I see. Let's sing verse five. Oh, I know not when my Lord may come at night or noon day fair, nor if I I'll walk the will with him or meet him in the air. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. Amen. number 627 please. I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazary and wonder how he could love me. A sinner condemned unclean. How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. For me it was in the garden. He prayed not my will but thine. He had no tears for his own griefs but sweat drops of blood for my. Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. In pity, angels beheld him and came from the world of light to comfort him in the sorrows. He bore for my soul that night. How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. He took my sins and my sorrows. He made them his very own. He bore the burden to Calvary and suffered and died alone. How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. When with the ransomed in gloryy, his face I at last shall see. will be my joy through the ages to sing of his love for me. How marvelous, how wonderful and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. Amen. As we stand together, we'll prepare to go to prayer with the song KF F number 710. The blood that Jesus shed for me [Music] way back on Calary. [Music] The blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose its power. For it reaches to the highest mountain and it flows to the lowest valley. Oh, the blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose its power. It soothes my doubts and calms my fear. ears and it dries all my tears. The blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose its power. For it reaches to the highest mountains and it flows to the lowest valley. The blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose its power. For it reaches For it reaches to the highest mountain and it flows to the lowest valley. The blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose it power. It will never Oh, it will never lose its power. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. We'll go to prayer with um a few needs to remember. Um if you could continue to remember my mom in prayer, Sister Luba. Um the surgery went very well, but they're going to have a couple of follow-up appointments and treatments. So, uh I believe for full restoration. Um, sister April is not here. So, let's remember her in prayer. And the Dean Hart's family traveling u to preach uh preach for brother Rich and Brother John Andy's and uh brother Trevor messaged me tonight saying that he's not feeling well still and couldn't make it. So, let's remember them in prayer. Brother David, could you lead us into our prayer? [Music] Let's pray. Our heavenly father, it's so good to be in the house of God. And Lord, this house has been appointed for the house of God to meet. And we're thankful that you're here because your life is here. Your elect is here. Your seed is here, Lord. And Lord, we're so thankful that the life that flowed through that blood, the very love of God abides in our hearts. What a great possession we hold. An eternal possession. We are your possession, Lord. We look forward to receiving from you tonight. We expect you to minister through our brother. And Lord, we expect to receive the word and expect to receive revelation and to leave here raised to a higher plane. Lord, we bring these requests before you. Lord, our sister Luba, we give you thanks for healing her body. &gt;&gt; We know that every test will come back a positive result. And Lord, we expect that. And Lord Jesus, we just pray for our brother Trevor. In the name of Jesus Christ, we see healing. We send healing word to him right now expecting you to touch him, renew his strength. We pray and encourage him in thy truth and in the word of God. And Lord, there's others here that things that have been mentioned. Lord, you know every one of them. And we just ask you to minister to each one according to your divine pleasure and purpose. and those that aren't here tonight and those that are on the internet. Lord, we ask your blessing that you would bless your word to them. Reveal yourself to them. And Lord, we expect these things. For you said, "Ask much that our joys may be full." And we praise you now because we know that we've received what we asked for. In Jesus Christ's name, we pray for it and ask it and give you thanks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] and you may be seated. Greetings once again to you all. Greetings to our visitors. God bless you. Um, let's see what we have. We'll just sing one more song as we invite brother Paul to come. Number 471. [Music] shackled by a heavy burden and need the load of guilt and shame. Nothing. The hand of Jesus touched me. And now I am no longer the same. For he touched me. Oh, he touched me. And oh, the joy that floods my soul. Something happened and now I know he touched me and made me whole. Since I met this blessed savior, since he cleansed and made me whole, I shall never cease to praise him. I'll shout it while eternity rose. He touched me. Oh, he touched me. And oh the joy that floods my soul. Something happened. And now I know he touched me and made me whole. Oh, let's sing that one more time. For he touched me. Oh, he touched me. And oh, the joy that floods my soul. Something happened and now I know he touched me. &gt;&gt; God touched us again. [Music] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad tonight we can say the Lord has touched us. Amen. in a time in our life that he just come and we're living in a day and age that we see so much pain and so much you might say em emotional injury spiritual injury from the spirits of the day but we get to stand here tonight and I want to speak to you on the thought of amazing grace uh washed by the water of the word and u brother Alex was just sharing with me because you see when I scroll to the end of My thought tonight, the very song he started with is also right there. And I just thought that was wonderful that God is good. I know our visitors have been greeted, but God bless you and trust you would enjoy yourself here tonight. Amen. And uh we just want to remember I I don't know if y'all remember brother Fabian. They've come before with the saints from Salt Lake City. And uh brother Fabian's in Ecuador sent me some some uh communication, some pictures today and they're there doing a youth deal and some pictures and just a a lovely lovely time. All these young people just worshiping the Lord and you know sometimes we think oh you know how many believers or how many children will be there in Ecuador and places like that but from the looks of that there's a lot. Amen. And so we just want to remember for their rest of their week um that God would just come down, you know, uh Satan would just love to take a hold of our children and put his mark in their life early on. But you know, as we would see, just as the uh blood over the door in Egypt, you know, sealed the household, God is sealing his young people, sealing them their lives. Amen. They don't have to go out there. They don't have to be marked by the world. God just keep his hand upon them and and so we just ask that the Lord would just move mightily in the work that they are doing there. Amen. Let's just stand as we would just go into our thought for a little bit this evening. And uh while I don't have much for notes, I I don't want to say we'll only be a few short minutes because that always backfires. Amen. That always comes back to haunt me. But uh uh who can say go you have experienced God's amazing grace in your life. Amen. And uh I say thank you for that Lord that uh we don't have to be some super people or whatever. We just have to be God's people. Amen. And he makes us super. Hebrews the 4th chapter verses 1-16. We'll read a portion of that and then allow you to be seated. Amen. Hebrews 4:1. Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them. But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. Now, I want to just not be too redundant tonight, but I'm telling you, it's amazing grace that the word that you have heard has profited you. that that was God's gift to you. It's not something we did or could do, but God has just poured that into us. And and uh no, we're not happy that it doesn't profit them. But I tell you, I am happy that it profits us. Amen. For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, as I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest, although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise. And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. And in this place again if they shall enter into my rest. Amen. Let's just be go to the Lord here. Heavenly Father, we just ask you father just to speak to our hearts tonight and just help me to be concise Lord and just convey these things Lord that's on my heart. Lord just bless each and everyone. There are many who are not here tonight. We ask you, Father, to be with them, Lord. Whatever their circumstances might be, sickness, work, etc., Father, just be with them, Lord. But bless those that are here tonight, Lord, just to receive a special portion from the ministry of the word, Father, that you would come down and touch our hearts. We ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Now, I like verse six, and this is why I I really like the break here. Seeing therefore it remainth that some must enter. So, as we'll look and see how the word of God is that this promise is given out and and while there would be many, you know, they quote John 3:16, but my brother and sister, there has to be something there for it to have an effect upon them. And so, it is therefore it remainth that some must enter. The word says there will be a select group of people that will receive or enter into the word. So it remainth that some must. Amen. That word must is like a command. Amen. And uh they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief. again he limitth a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear if ye will hear his voice and harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterwards have spoken of another day there remainth therefore a rest to the people of God I say Lord let us enter into that rest amen for he that is entered into his rest he als also has ceased from his own works. Now, I think what's really important about this, my brother and sister, is that we as humans constantly uh maybe without even meaning to tend to labor in our own works of what we try to accomplish, what we try to do. And and he's telling us here that uh once we've entered into that rest, we've ceased from our own works as God did from his. and let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. So I just find that is such a beautiful beautiful uh thought as this is. So let's continue on here the last few verses. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to dividing a sunder of soul and spirit, of joints and marorrow, and is the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and opened under eyes of him with whom we have to do. Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Blessings on the word of God. As we read that, I I just love those those words in Hebrew 4 that uh it really lays out a very clear picture. Now, to the believer, sometimes I I I've read just here again recently another little thing where this person thought that Christians were uh kind of arrogant to believe that they were a special people. But I don't know how that you could read your Bible and and uh in your heart be able to say amen to every word in the Bible and not consider yourself a special person. there there there's just no way that that by God dealing with you, dealing with your heart, changing us, amen, conforming us into his image, that you don't wake up one day and realize that that the word of God has formed me and is forming me, transitioning me into a new creature in Christ Jesus. We can't remain the old man. And I'm glad that we don't because the old man was not all that likable. Amen. You know, it uh is just something that that uh when you get in a certain atmosphere uh you know, say if you're you work in the office, uh the people in the office become your friends. If you're into sports, the people in the sports become your friends. Uh and as it is, but outside of that element, there's no connection. But the thing that I find so beautiful is when we enter into the rest in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, we can have this unity, this fellowship across a very broad spectrum. You don't have to uh you know be engaged in all the same activities because we are engaged in Jesus Christ. Amen. That is our connection. And so the what we do as we enter into the word, we find that it slowly changes us. Now, the last thing that Satan wants is for you and I to find rest, to find peace. We live in a day and age that there's all kinds of of anxieties and fears and and these things uh affect people's lives to such that they, you know, brother Brandham said it many years ago. They need a pill to get up in the morning. They need a pill to go to bed at night. They need something to calm their anxieties and fears. But my brother and sister, we're here by the grace of God tonight. Amen. We have a father and he hears our cry. He hears our prayer and he is the greatest thing. Now, does that take away your insomnia? No, it doesn't. I I don't mean to focus this on me, but just the last little while, I've been just dealing with a lot of case insomnia. And you know, I've just been implying the age old uh antidote that God has. and and you know you just roll over, you just start praying and you wake up later. Amen. Cuz the devil would rather let you sleep than you pray. So we say, "I can't sleep." Well, amen. Maybe God is uh giving you an uncction to pray. Amen. So if Satan can keep us in a constant state of unrest and we'll just look I'm not real big on looking into all the news and what is happening uh uh on the computer. But if you look in the world around us it is a in a state of unrest. People are afraid of everything there. They're talking about there's war and there's a rumor of a war. And so if you don't mind me putting this directly into the scripture, we have this conflict in in Europe there with Russia and Ukraine. And not just Russia and Ukraine, but it's kind of spreading out a little bit. And then all of a sudden now we have something happening with South America and we have a little thing here and we have a little thing there and we're seeing the scripture coming to pass and and Satan wants to keep us in a state of unrest. But we want to look at the countertop of that that God wants to keep you in a place where you are yearning where you are seeking his face. He does not want us as Christians, as believers, to become complacent in our position. Amen. Where we just sit down and say, "Well, I'm saved. You know, uh, when God comes, he's going to take me home. I can just relax now." No. God wants you to be diligent. It says, Amen, that we should, Amen, work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Amen. That's not a holiday. That's actually pursuing our position in Jesus Christ. Amen. Now, if Satan can keep us in a constant state of unrest, think about how many steps ahead he is, that he would come, if we're still reacting to yesterday, then he is already moving ahead. And he's got a lot of things to put on your plate. And this is why we as sons and daughters of God have to come and get in the word. We have to study. We have to pray. We have to be prepared for this because then we are covered. And when Satan would come, does that take it away? You know, kind of the analogy. We have full expectation in this world. We get up in the morning. We do breakfast. We go out to get in the car to go to work. We put the key in the ignition. We turn the key. We have full expectation. The car is going to start and we're going to drive away. And what happens to us? A high state of anxiety. The minute the car goes click, click click. Amen. So in that realize if Satan is doing such in our spiritual life, Amen. that when we need the Lord to come on the scene, there's a little accident, there's a little something comes and our spiritual key only brings a click click click because we do not have the right approach. Amen. Now is that right approach saying God's not prepared for us? No, my brother and sister. It is showing that we have not energized ourself by the word to be prepared for whatever situations come in our life. And so Satan's always looking ahead trying to keep that. Now I want to use this simple analogy tonight. Amen. He wants to keep you in, as the phrase says, a constant state of stumble. And that is every day you are stubbing your toe. There's something that keeps that. Now, you know as well as I do, it's easier to keep your balance in the beginning than it is to recover from the stumble. And we've all done that, right? You catch your toe on something and then you have to make all these uncontrolled steps. Now, don't think about those just in a physical realm. Think about it as in your own spiritual life, your family, decisions around you. If Satan can get you to stumble, then you will find yourself stumbling and making uncontrolled or un uh uh not u well uncontrolled will be fine. Amen. Steps that that are not necessarily the steps that you meant to take or you know that is best for you. And so if uh it's easier to keep our balance in the beginning than it is to regain it. And having said that, my brother and sister, as we look at Israel coming out of Egypt, it would have been much easier for them if they had come to the Red Sea and never stopped walking. &gt;&gt; They would have just walked right down into the Red Sea because God said that he would not allow anything to hinder them from fulfilling the promise that he had given them. If they had believed that with all of their heart, they might have walked out in the Red Sea and the water might have been all the way up to their nose. But God would have honored his word, but it was there. We looked too much to the right, too much to the left, too much to our emotion, too much to our circumstance. And before we ever even start, right, look at Israel. They never even walked out in the Red Sea. and they'd already decided that was a obstacle they could not overcome. Amen. Now, I want to ask you this evening politely, of course, have you ever had that circumstance. You never even stopped. You never even prayed because you just saw an impossible circumstance in front of you. But that's not what God called us to do. He called us to believe his word. And when we see an obstacle before us, he wants us to put the word before us. Amen. The word is not to follow us. Amen. The ark was in the front of the people as they come out of Egypt. And that's where God wants us to put the ark is in front of us that we follow the word. Amen. Because the word was inside the ark, right? And so he wants us to just follow the word, not try and decide what's going to go wrong. Amen. But to decide God's in control and he put his word out first and I'm just a follower. Now, people would say, "Oh, oh, you Christians are just a bunch of followers." Yes, I don't want to be the leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know what I can do in my own life. I can mess it up royally, left to my own device. But God says, you just follow my word and everything will work out just fine. Because as the scripture said that before the foundation of the world, these things are already dealt with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't need a new solution. We don't need a new answer. We need to follow the word of God. And I would say today that when we get in that that place, those positions, that we realize just how smoothly God can come. Did that take the problems away? No. My brothers and sisters, we're in uh Brother David's in it also. A prayer connection there. you know, all over the country, not just here in United States, but uh Mexico, Central America, South America, Europe, whatever, there's people cancers and sicknesses and accidents and all kinds of things. So, in Ecclesiastes, it says that these things happen to the rich and to the poor. So, don't say, "I'm a Christian, so I've got an exemption card." But we have an answer. Amen. We don't need an exemption card. We have an answer to every circumstance and that is follow the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just follow the word and God's already got it taken care of. Now, as we'll look at this, if Satan can keep you and I in a constant state of stumble, then you're never going to stand solidly in the word. &gt;&gt; You're always going to have turmoil, unrest, right? He promised that we could enter into the rest. But if we don't enter into the rest, then we can't claim that it didn't work because it's us that didn't enter. So if Satan can keep us in a constant state of stumble, then we'll never find rest. There'll always be that thing that we think, "God didn't hear my prayer." &gt;&gt; Now, my brother and sister, let me just put this out real quick. If Satan plants it in your mind that God did not hear your prayer, maybe God's selective, maybe only a certain kind of prayer on a certain day under a certain circumstance. Is that what the word of God says? &gt;&gt; That's not what the word says. The word said he hears the cries of his people. &gt;&gt; He hears our prayer. But the word also says that sometimes our prayers are not answered because we ask them selfishly. And uh so Lord, I would like you to just help me to be a better off financially. I need a bigger house, a better car, nicer clothes. I need, you know, bigger vacation. I need No, no, my brother and sister, that's not the way to approach God. &gt;&gt; We approach it, Lord, you promised &gt;&gt; you'd take care of the sparrow &gt;&gt; that you would take care of me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the sparrow's needs are met &gt;&gt; and my needs are met. &gt;&gt; It's not worldly wealth &gt;&gt; that we're taking out of here. &gt;&gt; But yet, as humanity, we pursue wealth. We pursue a better life just because I guess you'd say we're human. &gt;&gt; But that's not what we're taking out of here. We're taking our character. We're taking the Holy Ghost anointing us is what we're getting out of here. Now I want to just bring this uh u to to a point here in spiritual amnesia. Uh we'll look at this. Uh he says how about he said if you abide in me and my word in you you can ask what you will and it will be done for you. And I would say right here saints we need to just believe that wholeheartedly. We don't need to have a question mark of whether God's going to honor this. God honors his word. Amen. Are you identified there to believe that this is the truth? Mark 11 when he said, "If you say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you have said, it will come to pass." You can have what you've said. Can you be identified there to believe that is the truth? See, that's very hard for people to look at that in our educated minds today that you would come to a state and say, "Well, that mountain be moved. I mean, it's just impossible." But my brother and sister, God works. Amen. He never never steps away from his own word. And it would be, if I could put it just in a simple analogy, it might be just one rock on the backside of your mountain starts to move. But if you don't doubt, God said he would move the mountain. Now, if you've ever been in a state of high anxiety, high fear, whatever these things are, and when you start to call out on the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. God comes on the scene. I testify this of the truth. Amen. Man, as I've shared, you know, from my youth there, being a backslid state and a pickup there on the edge of the cliff, hanging there. Amen. And crying out to the Lord and having one little rock stop your vehicle from falling in the canyon. My brother and sister, you can't tell me that it won't be just one little rock on the back side of the mountain that works. Amen. Don't look for the whole mountain to shake. Maybe the mountain's in your attitude. Maybe the mountain is in your approach to God. Maybe the mountain is in your fear or your anxiety. And you believe that God's going to deliver you from that. Then you hold on to that. And you'll wake up one day and God has removed it. And sometimes it's not in a huge dramatic fashion. Sometimes God doesn't shake the building, but he moves your mountain. Amen. And we believe that. That's I believe a tenant that we can't believe just a portion of the word. We have to say amen to every word of God. &gt;&gt; And when we say amen to every word of God, amen, does it change God's word or does it change us? &gt;&gt; I say it's us. God's word's unchangeable, unmovable, unshakable. You don't doubt in your heart, but believe it will come to pass. You can have what you said. Can you be identified there to believe that this is the truth? If it hasn't, then you're getting spiritual amnesia, right? We're forgetting what God has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, how often we do that. We forget what God's already said. Amen. And you forget. You lose your Christian balance. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I think it's good to study the word of God. I do it all the time and look up words to see what what does that word mean? I want to understand it better. But my brother and sister, I I'm not doing that to be educated. I'm doing that just desiring to have understanding. But we'll find in the age that we live in, there's often times, and I don't mean this to be a big dig, but uh often times when there's different ministry around the world, uh you know, they list that they have they're a PhD in theology and these kind of things. My brother and sister, that's not what God said he would do. He said he would reveal it to the babes. I I'd rather be a babe than a PhD. Amen. God promised he would reveal it. So, you lose your Christian balance. You can't tell where you belong. You say, "I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist. That's what I know about it. I'm Pentecostal. I'm this, that, or the other." Watch out. That may mean that the disease sign is showing on you that you've got some spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we look at this and and we have to find that balance of of how it is that we identify ourselves. Sometimes it's a convenience thing. But yet if a person will take and hold to what their church believes over what the word of God says then what's happening is is we are actually choosing church over God. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to do that. Amen. Let's move on. He says, "Well, now you say, brother Brandham, I believe this and I don't hardly." Now wait just a minute. If God promised to do these things and said that they would be in the last days and your creed will keep you from it, that's a good sign. I see the disease sign on you. It's spiritual amnesia. You have forgotten to identify yourself with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we don't want to take an identity that's outside of what the original word of Christian like. Amen. not churchlikemen, &gt;&gt; but Christlike. &gt;&gt; And so what we don't want to do is get spiritual amnesia that our our creed or our or things is greater than than the word of God. Amen. So I say it's amazing grace that um we we can stand in this hour and God can take us back to the word and uh we realize the word is completely sufficient &gt;&gt; for what we need today. Now it's been prophesied not just in this day but in in times gone by it will be pro it's been prophesied that every organization that does not put Christ first will fail. So there are men that have have spoke these words many in some cases hundreds of years ago that if it's not identified directly with Christ, it will fail. I think their prophecies are coming to pass now. And thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy. Uh I did not I did not list that one, brother Alex, but um you see they fail to hear that still small voice of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what keeps us balanced. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost that comes to you and keeps you balanced. Amen. Not a church holding you rigidly to a creed, but the Holy Ghost dealing with you and keeping you lined up with the word. That still small voice. It's not a voice to the whole world out here, my brother and sister. It's a voice to you. And that voice to you is what keeps you balanced. Amen. And so we want to just uh get to a place in our life, amen, that the still small voice is present in our lives. It's it's not uh that we ignore it or uh someone tells you it's no longer relevant, but that still small voice is you praying and God speaking. You talking to God, God speaking back. Amen. Always like that analogy. If you don't mind me repeating this. Amen. When Esther come before her husband, the king. Amen. And they told Esther, "Now, if you go in there and go before him without him holding the scepter, you may never see him again. If he does not receive you, you will be banished." But Esther had another thing that they didn't have. And that was she knew that her husband, the king, &gt;&gt; but she didn't just, oh, king, he's king to me. He was husband to her. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And we are here, Revelation 19, and the lamb's wife. So, we've got a husband. Amen. And it's not that he looks down on us as a poor subject, but he looks down on us. My wife loves me, and she loves me enough to bring her problems to me, and I love her enough to be the solution to her problem. And Esther come there. She had that revelation. It's a shame that all these years later, not every Christian has that kind of revelation to know that her husband cares enough, loves her so much that by amazing grace, he's not going to say, "You've got to do this, you got to do that." Now, that's not to say that God does not have an appointed way for us to approach him. None of this, you know, just really loose and sloppy worship. Amen. God wants us to worship him in spirit and in truth. But still he looks down and he sees you and I and says that's my bride. That's my wife. That voice I know that voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say thank you Lord that he knows our voice and he hears our voice and he answers. Amen. Now look see God didn't send messengers all through the scripture for it to be explained away. He did he didn't send a messenger down to the ages to just have somebody explain why this is not relevant. He didn't send a messenger to this day for it to be explained away. You say, "But my circumstance says or my emotions says or my lack of understanding says uh that this isn't possible, this isn't relevant." Well, my brother and sister, if God didn't send a messenger to this age, then the word of God's not been fulfilled. And God's not going to leave one word of his word unfulfilled. He's not going to forget it. It's not going to be laid to the side. He didn't come later and say, "This is not relevant. Things have changed." God knows what is happening. Amen. And he spoke the word into the age. And the hidden mana was laid in the scripture. It was laid out for sons and daughters of God in the right season to have the word open to them to realize this is what God wants me to do. Now, my brother and sister, as one man uh brother that builds houses said one time many years ago, he said, you know, God is not here going, "Oh, I forgot to build the walls. I built the roof on the foundation." No, God doesn't do that, my brother and sister. He puts everything in place. And when it's all done, every shingle will be in the correct position. Everything within this house of God, amen, this assembly, Amen, will be in its correct position. And so it's there. Look at the spiritual food in due season that God has given us. Amen. As we read our Bibles, why didn't we see some of these things from scripture 15, 20, 30 years ago? Because God in due season knew the season that we'd be living in. Knew the economics of the day. He knew the politics of the day. He knew the religious spirit of the day. And he opens his word to us in the right season that we can come and when we need answers, there's answers. When we need fed, it's fed. When we need encourage, there's encouragement. When we need healing, there's healing. Amen. Everything that we need. And when we need revelation, there's revelation. Amen. And so it's there to uh the life is in the seed, right? You don't plant a dead or cracked or damaged seed and then expect it to be repaired when it's already in the ground. God planted good seed and that seed is going to bring forth of its kind. And that should encourage us because what Christ has already done in you and I, amen, is already as the scripture says, it's done before the foundation of the world. We don't have to sit here and say, "I hope to be worthy to be a son or daughter of God." He already planted a seed that was worthy before the foundation of the world. That's what the word tells us. And when he planted that seed, he knew that it would bring forth exactly what he planted. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he puts the seed in you and I to be sons and daughters of God. Amen. And that we could come, that the washing of the water of the word would come. And it then germinates that seed and that soil that we're planted in, Amen. And as we see the parable of the sewer, God did not plant you and I on the thistle on the side of the road. He didn't plant us in the gravel out on the borrow pit of the road. He planted you and I in the good soil of his word. And that word is bringing forth and nourishing sons and daughters of God that are going to bring forth a bride of Christ. That is exactly what God says that's what I planted before the foundation of the world. Amen. Let's get over the fear that we're not going to meet up. We're not going to make it. Amen. You can't make it on your own anyhow. It's God's word, God's grace, God's mercy in your life is what brings you to fruition to live this word in this hour. Amen. And God's already bringing that to pass. Amen. In our lives. And we would see how that God would come and he would work upon our life and we would be there. And we would see that in just the right moment. Now, being a farmer, these things, you know, you focus on, you realize there's spots in the state of Indiana. There's actually a little circle down through that part of the world down there that in in 40 years has not suffered a drought. Over here, it's dry as a bone. Crops are burning up. And just a few miles further to this side, it's rained so much the crops have drowned, but there's this little spot right here. We might reference it to go. There's a little spot right here. Rains when it needs to. Amen. The crops are healthy. They grow. They flourish. Now, my brother and sister, God didn't say, "I'm going to put you over here in a drought." And he didn't say, "I'm going to put you over here and drown you." But he said, "I'm going to put you in the good soil of the word." Amen. And that good soil's got everything you and I need to grow into a full, mature, healthy Christian to stand in the day that we're living. So God is the one who planted you. A church. Amen. We've all been led to the Lord. Somebody was part of that experience, right? But they didn't lead you to the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No man's come to God. That's what the word says, right? Amen. God's come to man. So we look and there's people in our life that we say, you know, maybe he introduced me or led me to the Lord. Just let that be a figure of speech because it was actually God wooing you. And God then put upon a a man or or somebody to come and be part of the process to put you in the right place. But in this good soil of the word, no man ever placed you in the good soil of the word. It was God who said, "This is where I'm planting you in my word, in this word that you could come and be nourished by the word &gt;&gt; to be what I called you to be." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some people say, "If you're not in our church, you're not with our group, you don't agree with us, I'm sorry. You're trying to plant people when God says he's the one who's planted the seed." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it won't be God saying, "I'm going to let man decide where to plant you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's God who plants us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we look at this. See, the life is in the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Plain and simple. &gt;&gt; We've been given access to all of the message, right? We've got access to all of it. Everyone has access to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But where does the real opening &gt;&gt; of the word come from? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Man cannot give an opening of the word. Man cannot give you. Man can educate you. Man cannot give you revelation. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; And so when God comes and starts to give revelation, people will question you because you start to see things and they want to know where did you get that? Well, I didn't get it out of a book. &gt;&gt; I didn't get it from a seminar. I didn't get it from what podcast. No, &gt;&gt; God gave it to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God gives it to you, if God gives you the revelation, &gt;&gt; then it's yours. &gt;&gt; That's it. It's yours. That's a good way to put it, Brother David. It's yours. No man's going to come and say, "I'm going to take that revelation back from you." When God gives that to you, Amen. You talk about amazing grace, saints. You talk about amazing grace cuz we've went to church. We've spent time. We've rubbed elbows with people and we see them go in different directions that is not pulling them closer to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And yet they say, "I believe like you do." &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's it. &gt;&gt; But we are not We cannot boast, right? &gt;&gt; No. No way we can boast of oursel. There's nothing that we can boast of oursel. But we can boast on our Lord Jesus Christ cuz his amazing grace opened our eyes and opened our ears that we could hear and we could see. And that is a great work of God that we should thank the Lord for tonight and say thank you Lord that my eyes are open and that my ears can hear and that my spirit is reacts to you when you speak to me. Now my brothers and sister if I could put this in analogy of a marriage that if a husband would speak words of endearment to a wife and she just ignored him that marriage is not going to flourish. And we as the bride of Jesus Christ, when he speaks to us in the love language of his word and we ignore him, that relationship is not going to flourish. God's looking for a bride that reacts and acts upon his word. And when that is there in the spiritual context, when you read the word and you say, "Amen, Lord, thank you for that. Thank you for that word, Lord. That means so much to me. come in just the right time and the right circumstance that I know you know my circumstance and you've discerned my heart. Amen. That's God speaking to us. Can a man do that? You can have circumstances even right here in the church. We just had some of it here just recently where things preached from the pulpit touch right into people's lives. Even sometimes discerning right to the very words of a conversation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can this man behind this say, "Look what I did." &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; using the word and the man to convey the message. &gt;&gt; Now, that works two ways, my brother and sister. If it's bad news to you, like God correcting you, you don't shoot the messenger. And if it's good news to you, God healing, delivering, encouraging, whatever, you don't go lift that man up. Cuz all you do when you lift that man up is cause God to have to come along and knock him off the pedestal because God's not going to share his glory &gt;&gt; with anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look how God's amazing grace is. He just brings a balance in our life that even sometimes in our own everyday testimony, we say the right words that encourages someone and strengthens them and they can say, "Oh, that's what I needed to hear." Is it that man? No. It was God that put the words in the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or the woman or the sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the opening of the word. Amen. There's an opening, but it's got to be in its right season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we look at the light of the scripture in the day that we live in, I'd have to say amazing grace has rained down upon us. Amen. That we can stay you might say out of this radical approach, the church going into almost a rock and roll world. Uh dressing any way you want, just come to church. Come as you are. Leave as you are. My brother and sister, we have expectation. When we come in the house of God, I want to leave changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want God to deal with my heart. I want to walk out of church and if there's something that's just not right, that God would come and put a correction to that. And and Amen. We don't want to just go on saying, "Oh, I go to church. I go to church. I want to walk into the presence of almighty God." Now, think for a moment. The priests, amen, when they came and went into the holiest of holies, they didn't just waltz in there any old way. They spent time. Amen. People say, "Well, that's under the law." But Jesus said, "I didn't come to do away with the law. I come to fulfill the law." So, the Old Testament is still the building block of our faith. Amen. It's still there. But look at those priests. They didn't just walt in there and say, "Hey, look, Lord, I made it. I'm here." No, sir. They come and in the mirror of the word put everything in order. Cuz I'll tell you what, as a minister, I don't want to be drugged out by a rope tied around my foot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't want my life to come to knot because I wouldn't prepare myself. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every one of us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come in the presence of the Lord. We need to come correctly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But look at the light of the world we live in. &gt;&gt; Everything the scripture said, we're seeing it come to pass. lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Lifting up their own idols, lifting up their own priorities, doing everything saying that is evil. This is good. All of this is coming to pass. And there are so many voices. I don't want to be critical tonight and start naming it off, but my brothers and sisters, there there is mainstream voices in the land that are basically saying, you know what? God loves you so much, he wants to make you rich. I can't find that in this scripture. &gt;&gt; I do find where he said he would provide for me. &gt;&gt; And I do believe that a man that won't work shouldn't even hardly even take a bite of food. He He's not worthy. He needs to work. That's what we were put here for. But you see so many uh voices. But the thing is I think is so special about this bride of Jesus Christ. She knows the voice of her beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody's going to fool. It says it would deceive the very elect if it were possible. But when this bride knows the voice of her bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to deceive her. She knows what voice is speaking to her. And when he calls her to a higher life, she knows that's him. Amen. And when another voice says, "You don't have to. You don't need to," she's not going to follow that voice because it's not the voice of her beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we know according to Revelations, the bride has something testify, right? Amen. The bride's got a voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's not afraid. Oh, no. We're not talking about just going out and blasting the world. You're all going to hell. &gt;&gt; No. No. This &gt;&gt; voice is going to be a voice that's backed up with a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, it's empty words. I could tell you as many times as you would listen to me. I'm going to give you a million dollars. I'm going to give you a million dollars. I'm going to give you a million dollars. What it would come down to is if I gave you a million dollars. Amen. And they say, well, you've got the Holy Ghost, but nothing changes in their life. Is God welching or they're speaking without authority? I know that's kind of blunt. Forgive me. But you see, God's not going to. He promised us the Holy Ghost, but we don't live any old way. We are not going to be unconverted and filthy. What he's going to do, brother Alex and I was just chatting for just a moment. Amen. Every one of us has had a time in our Christian experience where we come to the time that I don't know the right words to use. I'm just going to use the words that we kind of exaggerated. We kind of fudged. We kind of left something out. You know how easy it is when you're telling something, you know, how did this get broke? Well, I know that some of the guys were right around here and one of them must have &gt;&gt; and that one was you. &gt;&gt; But you don't say, "I broke it." &gt;&gt; Right? And God would come and a real believer, God says, "That's not good enough." Another man, sorry to sound judgmental, another man, his conscience says, "Hey, if the boss doesn't know I broke it, I'm not telling him." But a real Christian, a voice starts to speak to him and says, "You didn't really tell him the truth." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the Holy Ghost. Now, that's a simple analogy, but when that starts, you can't dig into the deep things of God without settling the simple things of God in our life. Amen. I want more revelation. I want this. I want that. My brother and sister, start with simplicity. Just start cleaning out the house. Just start cleaning out the closets. Start getting rid of the trash. Start dealing with the things of your life. And you think, "Oh my, they they'll look down on me." I'll tell you what from experience, I can tell you. You tell them the truth of where you stand and they'll look up to you. They'll say, "This is an exceptional individual because I don't know that I could do that. I don't know I could take that position." And they're not going to look down on you because you standing on the word of God and honoring God, God will honor you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean they'll like it, but they can't help it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you look at this. Amen. Now, let's look what the word says here for just a moment. One, we know the bride, the spirit, and the bride say, "Come." So, the bride's got a voice. This word is alive. It's not a dead letter. Amen. It's not dead letter. We don't we don't pass it out as a dead letter that you possess this library or something of these brochures in your home and everything will be fine. No, it's got to the life's got to come off the page. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's God's amazing grace to you and I that this word comes alive to us that we're not just saying I read in the scripture one time, but it's there. God said, I'm going to write it on the fleshly table of your heart. And that doesn't mean we chunk our Bible out, but what God's saying is, I'm going to make this so personal that I get to come right down into your life, into your heart, and I'm going to write my word on your heart. This is God's amazing grace, my brother and sister. This is not something we're forced to obey, but this is when you say, "Lord, I volunteer. I want the word to correct me. I want the word to move me. I want to experience the moving of the Holy Spirit." And it changes us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the word being alive, Amen. You're bloodbought, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now realize Calvary was just an earthly example of what God did before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; We were already chosen and placed in Jesus Christ. That's what the word says. But that blood, there are some today saying the blood is no longer a valid thing. And it just stuns me. I'm like, where do you get that? It's not coming out of the Bible. No, sir. It's coming out of some man's thoughts that he doesn't really want to have to deal with the blood because he wants to live like he wants to live and still claim Christianity. &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister, you ever get under that blood, get washed by that blood? The word promised we would come out whiter than snow. &gt;&gt; So if we're saying we're under the blood, been washed by the blood, and we're coming out black and blue and green and grungy, my brother and sister, we weren't really under the blood. Amen. But the blood will wash us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Does the word say that we're called of God? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Clearly says so. Does the word say that he would endure us with power? &gt;&gt; Amen. I say absolutely. Amen. So, does the word also declare in so many fashion you might say that uh the bride is not going to sit on the sideline and just watch the world pass her by? No, sir. This bride's got something to stand up and testify. The Apostle Paul was a perfect example of that. I trimmed some of this out of my my thought tonight, so you'll have to forgive me. I don't mean to be vague, but it's there. My brother and sister, the Apostle Paul says that I was called to this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't say, "I'm going to be a spectator to this." He said, "I was called to this." &gt;&gt; I was called. Some say, "Oh, boastful Paul." He says, "I Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ." He was identifying, I have a position. Amen. We might not be apostles tonight, but we can lift a hand and say, I and put your name in there. Called to be the bride of Christ. Amen. To put myself in there. Oh, where are we going to find this bride? She's going to be in the word getting washed. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I know it's a terrible analogy, Paul and his terrible analogies. Um, sometimes I feel so sorry for our poor little doggy and I eat breakfast and there's maybe scraps on the plate and my wife is just like, "Don't you do it." But I have to start slipping the scraps to my dear little doggy. Amen. Do you want to eat after that plate when he's done? I don't think so. I joked with Sister Jerry today. I said, "That plate looks pretty clean." &gt;&gt; Hold it up in the light. It's all shiny. &gt;&gt; Do you want to eat off of it? &gt;&gt; I don't. And I shouldn't do that. It's a bad habit. I'm sorry. Hopefully that wasn't over the top for you. But you see, I use that over-the-top example because we can clean ourself and be pretty happy with what we look like. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we want to be washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; We want the Holy Ghost to come down and cleanse us. Not to our satisfaction, &gt;&gt; but to his satisfaction. And when we are washed by the water of the word to his satisfaction, my brother and sister, we don't sit back and say, "Oh, praise God. I'm righteous. I'm holy. I'm" No. What it is, though, we can stand with a confidence that God has come and proven that the word is changing us and transforming us and bringing us into the image that he said he would bring us into. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But look at this now. Just like work clothes, we all have different jobs. Some get dirty. There's hardly a day goes by that I don't get very grungy. Amen. You want to wear those same clothes for a year? Flew into Chac once and our luggage didn't make it. I wore the same clothes for eight days straight &gt;&gt; and when the clothes showed up, we were actually standing in a blizzard on the runway. They threw my suitcase off and I said, "Sir, can you throw it back on?" We flew into Bethl, rented a room, and I about broke the hotel cuz I stood in that shower forever and ever and ever. And it's like, "Oh, this is wonderful." Now my brother and sister, if in the natural we could be that way, how about the need to be washed by the water of the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; How about the need for the Holy Spirit to come and take those things in our life that is there, little things that would bother us and plague us. And my brother and sister, remember as we spoke Sunday, Satan wants you to reach back under the blood and pull those things out. He's telling you, you did this. And my brother and sister, there's no need if we've been washed by the water of the word. That is under the blood. It is settled. It is washed. It is clean by God's standard, not by man's standard. And we need to have confidence and stand on that and say, "I place that under the blood of Jesus Christ. And I am clean. I am righteous. I am holy because he is and I am." Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, let's see here. You know, I think I'll just I think I'll call it quits right here. Just very close to my thought. Amen. 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he said unto me, Amen. Now, we don't we can't look hindsight, Google. What was the Apostle Paul's thoughts? I'm sorry. They might speculate, but they don't have an answer. that the apostle Paul leaves a very clear picture that even as a man called of God, he had a rough road to hope. &gt;&gt; I mean, he stands there openly and honestly and says, "And when I would do good, evil is present with me." Now, whether some people say, "Oh, Paul was doing things nobody knew about." No, no, nonsense. Come on. He's a man of God. But those spirits were right there to buffet him. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those afflictions as it were in his flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. The aches, the pains where he had been beaten and mistreated and uh you know all of all of the things. We won't elaborate. And he was there. And he's telling you, you do good, evil's going to be present with you. It's going to be there. It's going to afflict you. Whether it's in the mind or in the flesh, whatever it is, it's going to be there to afflict you. And uh so as he's speaking here, he he's declaring to the Corinthians. He says, "And he said unto me," this is God speaking to Paul, "You know, my grace is sufficient for thee, &gt;&gt; for my strength is made perfect in weakness, sir." &gt;&gt; Not God's weakness, &gt;&gt; Paul's weakness. Now if the apostle Paul who God chose to write this great portion of the New Testament was uh God was made strong in Paul's weakness. Now we my brother and sister are of the same fabric that Paul was made from cut from. And so God is going to be made strong in our weakness. Not that we can stand up and boast about what we have done but to stand here today and say without him I can do nothing. Without him, I cannot overcome. Without him, I have no ability. Everything I have to live the word of God is in my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So that we cannot boast. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmity, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Can we say amen to that tonight? I want Amen. not to be a boastful Christian. I want to be a man that in my own weakness. Recognizing that when I would do good, evil would be present with me and not be ashamed to acknowledge we have mind battles. We have physical battles. We have struggles in this world around us. We testify to somebody and then feel like we fall short of the very witness that we witness to somebody. And we struggle with that. And yet God comes and those words that spoke. Now the scripture says that God's word will never return void. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Where's God speaking today? &gt;&gt; Right here, you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God chose us. You say that sounds pretty boastful. That's what the word says. &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly right. &gt;&gt; That God's got hands. He's got feet. He's got a voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He chose this bride to stand up and speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the word speaking in this hour. It's not this man right here. It's the word coming through us. And when we surrender to the Lord and say, "Lord, I can't live without you." Then he says, "Oh, I can be made strong right here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he does. &gt;&gt; And he lets our life be a light or a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I think we'll just stop right there. Amen. Sister Vikica, would you come? And I'm just going to see since how brother Alex is already warmed up on that song. Amen. I'm just going to invite him to come and and uh sing that. I was just amazed. Of course, he got to see, you know, the glimpse of of the notes for putting them up and he come in the back room and he says, "Hey, &gt;&gt; guess what my first song is." That makes me happy, my brother and sister, because, you know, we're not just off on this limb and we're not just off on that limb, but God's speaking and he's dealing. He's dealing with us as a people. Amen. Bringing each and everyone, the bride of Jesus Christ around the world. Amen. Being drawn right into a unity, not a man-made unity. It's not man saying, "Hey, everybody, we're sending out a newsletter. Everybody preach on this." No, it's the Holy Ghost that is laying on the hearts of sons and daughters of God and taking them to same scriptures, same thoughts, same things and dealing with hearts. Amen. I've got connections all over the world, men and touch. You know, I got brothers call me from different places in the world today. My brother and sister, what are you preaching on, brother Paul? Uh, you tell me first. &gt;&gt; You know, not that I think they would change their story. They're good men, right? But you tell me first. Well, I just spoke on this. Oh, so did I. Oh, is that a conspiracy? It is. If the Holy Ghost is a conspiracy, but the Holy Ghost is not a conspiracy. He said, "I promise I'll be with you &gt;&gt; and I will be in you." Now, that's not a North American promise. That's not a South American promise. It's not an African promise, a European promise, an Asian promise. That's a promise to the bride of Jesus Christ, sons and daughters of God, the believers, that he says, "I'll be with you even in you. I'll speak to your hearts. I'll fill your mind with my mind, my thoughts, &gt;&gt; and your desires will be my desires." Hallelujah. You know, let's change this more than one song. Amen. 505, Sister Rachel. And I'll just let you sing are you washed as a followup if you want to. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you, our visitors. I hope tonight that Lord speaks something good to your heart and you enjoy yourself here. And Amen. God bless you all. My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy lean on Jesus name. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. When darkness seems to highest face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the hill. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. His oath, his covenant, and his blood support me in the welling flood. When all around my soul gives way, he then is all my hope and stay. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. And he shall come with trumpet sound. Oh, may I then in him be found, dressed in his righteousness alone, fought blessed to stand be for the throne. On Christ the soly rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. Amen. Well um shall we sing that song again? Are you washed by the water? 766. Do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling? Not to wonder where you're going when you die. Not condemned of the past, not afraid. Tomorrow holds in store. and know the reason why. Yes, that's just how it is when you go down in the water. Cuz by faith you believed in what you heard. It's no impossible dream. You can start over clean. When you're washed by the water of the word, are you washed by the water? Washed by the water of the word. Oh, are you washed by the water? washed by the water of the word. Oh, it's like being born again with a whole new life to live, never having to look back to what you've been. Cuz according to the Lord, you've just started your existence. He's concerned there never was no sin. [Music] When God looks your way, he no longer sees a sinner, but a saint who's been washed white as snow. Not by anything we've done, but by the blood of God's own son. Are you washed by the water of the word? Oh yes, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. Yes, I'm washed by the water. I'm washed by the water of the word. Praise the Lord. Amen. Number 653. Please sing the song sweet by and by. There's a land that is fairer than day. And by faith we can see it afar. For the Father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there in the sweet. By and by, we shall meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by. We shall meet on that beautiful shore. We shall sing on that beautiful shore. the melodious songs of the bless and our spirits shall sorrow no more. Not a sigh for the blessing of rest. In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet. By and by, we shall meet on that beautiful shore. To our bountiful father above, we will offer our tribute of praise for the glorious gift of his love. and the blessings that hallow our days in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by we shall take on that beautiful shore. Amen. Um, as we dismiss, sing the song, give me Jesus. You know, we usually sing it on a Sunday morning cuz it says in the morning when I rise, but I'm thinking of tomorrow morning going back to work and dealing with all of that. So, I need Jesus [Music] be flat. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. [Music] You can have all this world but give me Jesus. [Music] And when I am alone. Oh, when I am alone. When I am alone, give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. You can have all this world. But give me Jesus. When I am afraid. When I am afraid. When I am araid. Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus. [Music] Give me Jesus. [Music] You can have all this world, but give me Jesus.
