[29:32] is where we'll start tonight
[29:46] matthew 25 verse 1.
[29:53] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[29:55] likened unto ten virgins
[29:56] which took their lamps and went forth to
[29:58] meet the bridegroom
[30:00] and five of them were wise and five were
[30:02] foolish and they that were foolish took
[30:04] their lamps
[30:05] and took no oil with them but the wise
[30:08] took oil in their vessels with their
[30:09] lamps
[30:10] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[30:12] slumbered and slept
[30:13] and at midnight there was a cry made
[30:15] behold the bridegroom cometh
[30:18] go you out to meet him then all those
[30:20] virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
[30:23] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[30:25] us of your oil
[30:27] for our lamps are gone out
[30:30] but the wise answered saying not so lest
[30:32] there not be enough for us
[30:35] and you but go you rather to them that
[30:37] sell and buy for yourselves
[30:40] while they went to ba to buy the
[30:42] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[30:44] went in with him
[30:46] to the marriage and the door was shut
[30:49] amen and then matthew 6 verse 6 i just
[30:53] have it written here
[30:54] but thou when thou prayest enter into
[30:57] thy closet
[30:58] and when thou has shut thy door pray to
[31:00] thy father which is
[31:01] in secret and thy father which seeth in
[31:04] secrets
[31:05] shall reward thee openly let's bow our
[31:08] heads
[31:09] heavenly father lord jesus we asked lord
[31:12] that you would come
[31:13] father and keep your word tonight lord
[31:15] jesus father we are here gathered in
[31:17] your name lord
[31:18] ready to hear from you whether ready to
[31:21] be touched by you
[31:23] father lord may not the stumblings and
[31:26] the stutters of this man get in the way
[31:28] tonight but father you just come and
[31:30] speak to our hearts lord father if we
[31:32] come tonight and we only hear a man
[31:34] speak and we
[31:36] go away from here father will not be any
[31:38] better but lord
[31:39] if you come and you speak father we'll
[31:42] go from here
[31:43] changed lord jesus i pray father that
[31:46] you would anoint these words tonight
[31:48] anoint the hearts of your children
[31:50] father lord of your bride lord
[31:52] your sweet heart father lord and remind
[31:56] us again tonight father
[31:58] lord all about the goodness that you
[32:00] have done for us for
[32:02] remind us again tonight father of all
[32:04] the goodness you have in store for us
[32:06] father may we remember who we are lord
[32:09] we listen to the voice of the world
[32:11] every day father for that is where we
[32:13] live
[32:14] and lord it tries to tell us and bring
[32:17] us down
[32:18] we are not nothing special but lord the
[32:21] word
[32:21] pushes back against that and father we
[32:25] want to be reminded tonight
[32:27] of how much you love us father lord and
[32:30] how much
[32:30] father our life means
[32:34] so much more than our daily life here on
[32:36] this earth
[32:37] father may you just come tonight we pray
[32:39] in jesus name
[32:40] amen you may have your seats tonight
[32:45] so my title tonight is behind a closed
[32:48] door now
[32:52] i um last time i
[32:56] spoke we talked about thomas and what
[32:58] wasn't in my notes it was
[33:00] inspiration of the holy spirit that we
[33:03] saw that
[33:04] the door was shut but jesus came inside
[33:08] anyways
[33:10] and behind that closed door he turned
[33:13] thomas's doubts into revelation
[33:17] and i just kept thinking about that i
[33:18] couldn't get that out of my head
[33:20] and uh brother david was preaching last
[33:22] wednesday and
[33:24] just the notes coming out felt bad i was
[33:27] hoping no one thought i was texting so
[33:29] all i had was my phone so i was taking
[33:31] notes on my phone
[33:32] but as brother david knows and uncle
[33:35] paul if you don't write it down you will
[33:36] not remember it
[33:38] so we were there and then
[33:41] sunday morning our pastor opened up and
[33:44] now
[33:45] i couldn't i couldn't believe what what
[33:47] he was preaching on
[33:49] and um we're going to pick up literally
[33:52] in the next
[33:53] verse where he stopped and that's just
[33:55] the goodness of god
[33:56] and as the kind of stuff my god does and
[33:59] you can't
[34:00] plan that because we didn't swap notes
[34:03] but if we turn in john
[34:04] 20 let's just refresh our memories on
[34:07] thomas
[34:09] john chapter 20 verse 26.
[34:22] and after eight days again his disciples
[34:24] were with
[34:25] were within and thomas with them and
[34:27] then came jesus the doors being shut
[34:30] and stood in the midst and said peace be
[34:32] unto you
[34:33] then saith he to thomas reach hither thy
[34:36] finger and behold my hands and reach
[34:37] hither thy hand and thrust it into my
[34:39] side and be not faithless
[34:41] but believing and thomas answered and
[34:43] said unto him my lord
[34:44] and my god amen so thomas's doubts
[34:48] return to revelation
[34:49] behind a closed door
[34:52] amen so now let's step forward into
[34:54] second kings chapter four
[34:57] amen we heard on sunday about the the um
[35:00] the sister with the pots
[35:02] she had no money to pay what was due and
[35:04] her sons are going to be taken
[35:06] from her to be servants to pay her debt
[35:09] and she goes to the prophet elisha
[35:13] the word and the word told her
[35:17] to get all the pot she could and to just
[35:20] pour the oil
[35:21] not to worry about where it was coming
[35:23] from or how much was in the bottle but
[35:24] just to pour the oil sometimes god asks
[35:27] us to do things that don't necessarily
[35:29] make sense
[35:30] but if we do them we'll find god's
[35:32] promise fulfilled
[35:34] in those actions because your actions
[35:36] testify of your faith
[35:38] that god is going to cover your back
[35:41] amen second kings chapter four
[35:48] see here
[35:56] amen six five four okay second kings
[35:59] chapter four
[36:03] and uh verse seven
[36:06] is where the she she comes and she tells
[36:09] the man of god go
[36:11] and he said go sell the oil and pay thy
[36:12] debt and live thou and thy children
[36:14] of the rest i just it just moved me to
[36:17] see that
[36:17] we ended there on sunday and we're
[36:19] picking up in verse eight to nine
[36:21] this is how god works sometimes so verse
[36:23] eight and it fell on a day that elisha
[36:25] passed
[36:26] to shut him there was a great woman and
[36:28] she constrained him to eat bread and so
[36:30] it was that as oft as he passed by
[36:32] he turned in thither to eat bread she
[36:34] must have made
[36:35] a good bread maker and she said under
[36:37] her husband behold now i perceive that
[36:39] this
[36:40] is an holy man of god which passes
[36:43] passeth by us continually so they
[36:46] didn't necessarily know who he was when
[36:48] he first started coming around
[36:50] amen but they began to realize by his
[36:52] his
[36:53] manners and how he conducted himself and
[36:55] what he talked about that this guy was a
[36:57] man of god
[37:00] and she says let us make a little
[37:02] chamber i pray thee on the wall and
[37:04] let us set for him there a bed and a
[37:06] table and a stool and a candlestick and
[37:08] it shall be
[37:09] when he cometh to us that he shall turn
[37:12] in thither
[37:13] and it fell on the day that he came
[37:15] thither and he turned into the chamber
[37:16] and lay there and he said the gehesa his
[37:18] servant called this shinumhai
[37:20] and when he had called her she stood
[37:21] before him and he said unto her say now
[37:24] unto her and um
[37:28] behold thou has been careful for us with
[37:30] all this care
[37:31] what is to be done for thee
[37:37] what is thou be spoken for to the king
[37:40] or to the captain of the host
[37:42] and she answered i dwell among my
[37:44] unknown people
[37:46] and he said what then is to be done for
[37:47] her and gaheza answered verily she hath
[37:50] no child
[37:51] and her husband is old and he said call
[37:54] her and when he
[37:55] had called her she stood in the door so
[37:57] elisha sent kahesa to talk to her
[38:00] geheza comes back and tells him what she
[38:02] said
[38:04] and gaza knew that she had no child and
[38:07] her husband was getting old
[38:09] and so he said now go bring her to me so
[38:11] she she comes and he says
[38:12] and when he had called her she stood in
[38:14] the door and he said about this season
[38:16] according to the time of life thou shalt
[38:18] embrace his son and she said name my
[38:20] lord thou man of god do not lie unto
[38:22] thine handmaid
[38:23] and the woman conceived and bear a son
[38:25] at that season that elisha had said unto
[38:27] her according to the time of life
[38:29] so she didn't have the faith to believe
[38:31] it but the word had spoken
[38:34] amen you didn't necessarily have the
[38:36] faith to accept
[38:37] god's word but the word was spoken over
[38:39] you before the foundation of the world
[38:41] and there would become a time
[38:43] in this right season where you would
[38:45] bring forth
[38:46] amen that promised son amen and that
[38:50] is a testimony to the life of christ
[38:52] inside of you that's what the whole
[38:54] thing's about
[38:55] is you receiving seed from your husband
[38:57] jesus christ
[38:58] and then bringing forth the promised son
[39:00] amen which is the word of god
[39:03] amen your life will testify of it and
[39:06] so now uh verse 18 and when the child
[39:09] was grown it
[39:10] fell on a day that he went out to his
[39:13] father to the reapers
[39:14] and he said unto his father my head my
[39:16] head and he said to a lad carry him to
[39:18] his mother
[39:19] so we speculate he had got a heat stroke
[39:23] and when he had taken him and brought
[39:25] him to his mother
[39:26] he sat on her knee till noon and then
[39:29] died
[39:30] and she went up and laid him on the bed
[39:32] of the man of god
[39:33] and shut the door upon him and went out
[39:36] immediately she took her concerns her
[39:39] worries
[39:40] and laid them on the resting place of
[39:42] god's word
[39:44] amen and that resting place is the faith
[39:47] that god will keep his promises
[39:50] god promised her a son and the devil
[39:53] tried to take it away
[39:54] but she knew this was a promise from god
[39:56] so straight away she puts him in the bed
[39:58] she saddles up the donkey and she called
[40:00] her husband verse 22
[40:02] and said send me i pray thee one of the
[40:04] young men and one of the asses that i
[40:06] may run to the man of god
[40:07] and come again and he said wherefore
[40:09] will thou go to him today it is neither
[40:11] new moon nor sabbath and she said it
[40:13] shall be well
[40:16] praise the lord her son's lame are dead
[40:20] but her testimony says it shall be well
[40:22] amen revelations it says they overcame
[40:24] him
[40:24] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[40:26] of your testimony
[40:28] praise the lord and he said wherefore
[40:30] okay twenty-four then she sat on an ass
[40:32] and said to her servant drive
[40:34] and go forward slack not thy writing for
[40:37] me except i
[40:38] bid thee in other words go as fast as
[40:40] you can don't worry about me
[40:41] hang on so she went and came under the
[40:44] man of god to mount carmel
[40:46] and it came to pass when the man of god
[40:48] saw her afar
[40:49] off that he said to geheza his servant
[40:52] behold yonder is that shinomite
[40:55] run now i pray thee to meet her and say
[40:57] unto her is it well with thee
[40:59] is it well with thy husband is it well
[41:00] with the child and she answered
[41:03] it as well well the he didn't know why
[41:06] she was coming god had hid it from him
[41:08] and when she came to the man of god to
[41:10] the hill she caught him by the feet
[41:12] but geheza came near to thrust her away
[41:16] and the man of god said let her alone
[41:18] for her soul is vexed within her
[41:20] and the lord hath hid it from me and
[41:22] hath not told me
[41:24] then she said that did i desire a son of
[41:26] my lord
[41:27] did i not say do not deceive me amen
[41:31] i got a little note written in my bible
[41:32] here holding god to his promise
[41:34] amen sometimes you gotta hold god to his
[41:36] promise that's what he's looking for
[41:38] he's looking do you
[41:39] actually believe the promise that i have
[41:41] given you are you willing to say
[41:43] cry jesus you promised me he says
[41:46] are they are they are they're just gonna
[41:48] accept defeat and walk away
[41:50] but not the children of god you can't
[41:51] accept defeat you have to stand
[41:53] on the word when you say lord you
[41:56] promised you're not being arrogant
[41:58] you're saying you have faith you have
[42:00] faith that what god said he will do
[42:02] he's going to fulfill in your life and
[42:04] that's exactly what she was doing
[42:06] say hey you promised me a son
[42:09] i had that son but now he's dead
[42:13] did not you promised me a son amen she's
[42:16] holding the word of god
[42:17] to the promise then he said to gahesa
[42:20] gird up thy loins
[42:21] and take my staff in thine hand and go
[42:24] thy way
[42:25] if thou meet any man salute him not if
[42:28] any salute
[42:29] thee answer him not again and lay my
[42:31] staff upon the face
[42:32] of the child i mean just like the
[42:34] handkerchief that paul
[42:36] and we've we've done now and um the
[42:38] mother of the child said as the lord
[42:40] liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not
[42:42] leave thee
[42:43] and he arose and followed her so she was
[42:47] like that
[42:47] she was like that woman that kept
[42:49] knocking on the judge's door
[42:51] she didn't stop right she said that's
[42:53] fine gaheza can go with his staff
[42:55] but i'm going to stay with you and
[42:57] that's what you got to do when something
[42:59] happens calamity happens in your life
[43:01] or you just need god to come and answer
[43:03] a prayer stay with him
[43:06] stay right there with him and then don't
[43:08] accept a substitute
[43:10] amen and passed on before them and laid
[43:14] the staff upon the face of the child but
[43:16] there was neither voice nor hearing
[43:19] wherefore he went again to meet him and
[43:20] told him saying the child is not awake
[43:23] and when elijah was come into the house
[43:26] behold the child was dead
[43:27] and laid upon his bed he went in
[43:30] therefore and
[43:31] shut the door upon them twain amen
[43:33] behind a closed door as their title
[43:34] tonight
[43:35] so he shuts the door and and and prayed
[43:39] unto the lord and he went
[43:40] up and lay upon the child and put his
[43:42] mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon
[43:44] his eyes and his mouth hands upon his
[43:47] hands
[43:48] and he stretched himself upon the child
[43:50] and the flesh of the child
[43:51] waxed warm then he returned and walked
[43:53] in the house to and fro and went up and
[43:55] stretched himself upon him
[43:59] and the child sneezed seven times and
[44:02] the child opened his eyes and he called
[44:04] geheza and said call the shinami
[44:06] so he called her and when she was come
[44:07] in unto him he said take up thy son
[44:11] then she went in and fell at his feet
[44:13] and bowed herself to the ground
[44:14] and took up her son and went out amen so
[44:18] here he had so here's elijah comes

[50:21] amen of your life and that is what you
[50:23] need
[50:24] in order to make it to the end of time
[50:27] amen matthew 28.
[50:48] matthew 28 in the end of the sabbath as
[50:51] it began to dawn toward the first day of
[50:53] the week
[50:56] mary gay mary magdalene and the other
[50:59] mary to see
[51:00] the sepulcher and behold there was a
[51:03] great earthquake
[51:05] for the angel of the lord descended from
[51:07] heaven and came
[51:08] and rolled back the stone from the door
[51:11] and sat upon it
[51:13] his countenance was like lightning in
[51:14] his raiment white as snow
[51:17] and for fear of him the keepers did
[51:19] shake and became as
[51:20] dead men and the angel answered and said
[51:23] unto the woman
[51:24] to the women excuse me fear not ye for i
[51:26] know that ye seek jesus
[51:28] which was crucified he is not here for
[51:31] he is risen
[51:32] as he said come see the place where the
[51:34] lord lay
[51:36] amen john 10 verse 9 i am the door
[51:39] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[51:42] saved
[51:42] and shall go in and out and find pasture
[51:46] amen christ is the mystery of god god
[51:48] revealed
[51:49] but the banner says but god's great
[51:51] mystery what the eternal god had as a
[51:53] mystery has now been
[51:55] unfolded in jesus christ
[51:58] then given right down to his church
[52:01] what was once in god's mind is now in
[52:04] the body of christ amen do you believe
[52:06] you're the body of christ tonight
[52:08] jesus making love to the church whoa
[52:10] wait
[52:12] we're not there yet right no
[52:15] no no no no that that's that's coming
[52:17] that's what some people want to say
[52:18] that's coming
[52:19] we're not there yet why because they
[52:21] don't want to do that because to do that
[52:23] is to sell out completely
[52:24] that's right you can't you can't yes sir
[52:27] see what okay so if you read we read in
[52:30] matthew 25
[52:31] about the foolish and the wise virgin
[52:33] they both
[52:34] slumbered and slept see the foolish
[52:37] virgin
[52:38] wanted to to enjoy the blessings of god
[52:42] in rest but they didn't do so according
[52:46] to the word of god so they slumped
[52:48] slumbered and slept
[52:49] in laziness but the bride the wise
[52:52] virgin slumbered and slept
[52:53] in peace and rest because they had
[52:57] the holy ghost giving them their eternal
[53:00] sabbath right their sabbath their rest
[53:03] praise the lord because once you've sold
[53:05] out to him completely
[53:07] and then he takes everything you gave
[53:09] over to him and he fills the inside of
[53:11] you with
[53:12] his oil and then you got plenty of oil
[53:14] of the holy spirit to shine your light
[53:16] amen and so praise the lord he goes on
[53:20] to say he says jesus making love to the
[53:22] church his bride
[53:23] whispering secrets to her you know how
[53:26] you tell your wife things you know
[53:28] the little girl you're going to marry
[53:29] you love her so much you just tell her
[53:31] the secrets and get her up next to you
[53:32] and love you
[53:33] and everything you know how it is that's
[53:36] what god christ
[53:37] is doing to the church see he is letting
[53:40] her
[53:40] know the secrets christ can't do that
[53:43] unless he's married you
[53:45] if if he was doing that without marrying
[53:48] you he would be contradicting his
[53:50] own word so where does that leave us in
[53:53] matthew 25. somewhere in there
[53:57] right there are they looking for oil
[54:01] that's right right but
[54:04] we have gone with christ amen and we
[54:06] read in there
[54:07] they shut the weed we went in with the
[54:09] bridegroom and
[54:10] shut the door that's why they're trying
[54:13] so hard to find it
[54:16] in tapes only in this preacher or that
[54:19] preacher
[54:20] but they'll never find it and then
[54:22] they'll look but they'll never find it
[54:24] and when they find something it'll be
[54:26] too late amen
[54:28] praise the lord by having the revelation
[54:31] of his secret made known to them
[54:33] by his grace how the grace of god he
[54:36] says
[54:37] so it was the grace of god amen that
[54:40] you even had the oil to begin with
[54:43] and then it's the grace of god that says
[54:45] hey ah
[54:48] come away my love right
[54:51] come on over here sweetheart calm inside
[54:54] the room
[54:55] and then i'm going to shut the door
[54:57] behind the closed door god
[54:58] christ reveals himself to you amen and
[55:02] that's good and
[55:03] and and and and that's the word of god
[55:06] and when i read stuff like that you know
[55:08] growing up in the message when i didn't
[55:10] unders
[55:11] before god gave revelation i didn't
[55:12] understand what that all was it kind of
[55:14] went over my head
[55:15] and so as a minister and i read that
[55:18] kind of stuff
[55:18] and it stirs me all up but i want to
[55:21] know where does it apply
[55:22] now where does it apply now
[55:26] it applies now you got to get in there
[55:29] if you want victory over
[55:30] sin if you want victory over sickness
[55:33] if you want victory at your job if you
[55:36] want victory in your marriage
[55:38] if you want victory with your children
[55:40] you've got to get in behind the closed
[55:42] door with christ
[55:43] you want to raise up amen that
[55:46] we with the youth group we're going
[55:49] through the church age book right now
[55:51] and we just went through the ephesians
[55:53] church ages so we talked a little bit on
[55:55] friday night
[55:55] about going back to our first love amen
[55:58] that's what you have to do you find
[56:00] yourself like the ephesians
[56:02] lacks guess what just because it happens
[56:04] it doesn't mean you're lost
[56:06] because it happens to everybody it's the
[56:07] world we live in but around says we go
[56:09] through cycles of revival
[56:11] and death amen and we're able
[56:14] and what what got what god's going to do
[56:16] when he starts to get closer to that
[56:18] departure time
[56:19] amen is he's going to start pulling on
[56:21] you pressing on you
[56:23] and then so that you're there you're
[56:24] less time between
[56:26] you're between your lows and your and
[56:28] your highs right and did more
[56:30] of a steady amen upward climb like enoch
[56:33] he was walking
[56:34] the earth walking in the in as a
[56:37] believer
[56:38] amen walking after christ and then one
[56:40] of the one day then he just started
[56:42] walking straight up because what he knew
[56:44] and his revelation of christ
[56:46] couldn't he couldn't keep here anymore
[56:49] and that's why the rapture is
[56:50] inside of you because
[56:54] if you if before the foundation of the
[56:56] world
[56:57] god picked you and then
[57:01] potentially gave you the eternal life
[57:04] which is predestination
[57:05] yes sir and then now you're gonna come
[57:08] down here
[57:09] where he picked where you would live and
[57:11] then you're gonna find the rapture out
[57:13] here somewhere
[57:14] that that contradicts with the word of
[57:16] god everything
[57:18] comes from the word because god
[57:21] according to the laws of the universe
[57:23] that he created it's the spoken word
[57:26] so he had to speak it for it to come to
[57:28] pass
[57:29] amen so he spoke it already and one of
[57:32] these days does it going to catch a
[57:33] revelation in your heart
[57:35] in your life we're all going to catch it
[57:36] at the same time and we're going to
[57:38] rapture out of here that's
[57:39] how it's going to work it lines up right
[57:41] with his word
[57:43] praise praise the lord so you'll find
[57:45] victory when you shut the door on the
[57:47] world
[57:52] amen
[57:56] now it's got to be the right door
[58:01] that's right it's got to be the door
[58:06] for ordained which is christ
[58:09] christ is the door so you you got to
[58:12] shut the door and you got to get behind
[58:13] the closed door but that door has to be
[58:15] christ because there's
[58:16] closed doors amen in the world
[58:19] and there's nothing happening behind
[58:21] there that's good
[58:22] and then the closed doors and
[58:24] denominational churches but there's just
[58:26] death behind those doors
[58:31] now amen praise the lord that
[58:34] door has to have the token applied to
[58:37] the doorposts
[58:38] hey man you go go search it there's the
[58:41] the door
[58:43] the subject of the door through the
[58:44] scripture is just
[58:46] it could go 100 100 sermons 100 ways
[58:52] but the token applied to the door so god
[58:55] raised you up and then god transformed
[58:58] your life
[58:59] amen and he gave you the blood a meant
[59:02] to sanctify
[59:03] to justify the door of your heart amen
[59:07] now once that door is justified
[59:10] and sanctified and the the token is
[59:13] applied amen the holy spirit
[59:15] and then testifying of that within your
[59:18] life
[59:19] now you've got a place where you can go
[59:21] and get away with christ
[59:22] and draw closer to him behind that token
[59:26] amen there what there is what brother
[59:28] brown says
[59:29] there's protection from god as long as
[59:31] you're behind his will
[59:33] it could be the same thing as the door
[59:35] because he is the door
[59:37] and as soon as you step out of the door
[59:39] as soon as the children of israel
[59:40] stepped out of the door
[59:41] in egypt where the death angel was
[59:42] passing they would die but unless they
[59:44] were behind the door
[59:46] and then with the blood applied to the
[59:47] doorpost then there was safety
[59:50] so there's victory amen there's there's
[59:52] revelation
[59:53] and there's safety amen behind the
[59:55] closed door
[59:56] with christ amen praise the lord
[1:00:01] now the doorpost can hold the blood of
[1:00:04] christ
[1:00:05] or can be used to bind you to the devil
[1:00:08] because the scripture in exodus says and
[1:00:11] if the servant
[1:00:12] exodus 21 verse 5 to 6 and if the
[1:00:14] servant shall plainly say i love my
[1:00:16] master
[1:00:17] my wife and my children i will not go
[1:00:19] out free
[1:00:20] then his master shall bring him unto the
[1:00:22] judges he shall also bring him to the
[1:00:25] door
[1:00:26] or unto the doorpost and his master
[1:00:28] shall bore his
[1:00:29] ear through with an all and he shall
[1:00:31] serve him forever
[1:00:33] amen so you you have a choice you can
[1:00:36] serve god
[1:00:37] you can put your life into god or you
[1:00:40] can say never mind i don't want to go
[1:00:42] free and then you're marked amen on the
[1:00:45] door of your heart to your
[1:00:47] your your mark through the ear and then
[1:00:49] now forever
[1:00:50] amen you are a servant to the devil but
[1:00:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:55] god said you are my child
[1:00:58] and so you're not going to be asking for
[1:01:02] the all in the ear
[1:01:03] amen you're ready to to go on and serve
[1:01:06] god and if you read here
[1:01:07] it says that if the servant becomes the
[1:01:10] man becomes a servant to his master and
[1:01:12] he
[1:01:12] doesn't have a wife and children and he
[1:01:15] ha he gets married and he has children
[1:01:16] while he's a servant
[1:01:18] he has to leave them behind to go free
[1:01:21] and the scripture we mention this friday
[1:01:22] night too the scripture says
[1:01:24] jesus came not to not to to um
[1:01:27] he came to to to bring division between
[1:01:30] a son
[1:01:31] and his father and a daughter and her
[1:01:33] mother amen
[1:01:34] god's word calls for total separation
[1:01:38] amen sometimes that separation comes
[1:01:41] where it hurts
[1:01:42] but see god wants to see abraham
[1:01:45] do you love me enough to sacrifice
[1:01:49] isaac man you're all abraham's children
[1:01:53] amen so we have you know say oh well i
[1:01:56] got my smile from my dad or i got my
[1:01:58] eyes from my mom
[1:02:00] or i got my hair from my from my mom or
[1:02:02] this side of her we got
[1:02:04] we got that faith from our father
[1:02:06] abraham
[1:02:07] coming on down through and now we stand
[1:02:10] and we testify
[1:02:12] amen that christ means more to us than
[1:02:15] any blessings he gives us anything that
[1:02:18] he gives us we're
[1:02:19] ready to lay that down and say we're
[1:02:22] giving it all to you lord
[1:02:24] amen there's safety behind the closed
[1:02:27] door
[1:02:27] i mean just like noah's ark amen who
[1:02:29] shut the door
[1:02:34] god shut the door and no one couldn't
[1:02:37] open it
[1:02:39] once you are sealed in you can't open it
[1:02:44] you say oh i made him i made a mistake i
[1:02:47] you know i did this man you know
[1:02:50] it's too late for me no no no
[1:02:53] god shut the door you can't even open it
[1:02:57] much less anybody else sign
[1:03:00] sealed and delivered amen there is
[1:03:04] safety behind the closed door
[1:03:07] and god is going to see you through
[1:03:09] whether it be floods
[1:03:12] amen
[1:03:15] covid you say well we had covert yeah
[1:03:18] but you're okay
[1:03:20] and if you weren't and you passed on
[1:03:24] yeah you're doing a lot better than the
[1:03:25] rest of us are
[1:03:28] so they were safety behind the closed
[1:03:30] door amen
[1:03:32] you say well i don't understand
[1:03:36] everything i read them the seals and i
[1:03:38] read these
[1:03:40] these messages and we're reading the
[1:03:42] church book and i
[1:03:43] i'm just not really getting it
[1:03:48] you got to get men behind the closed
[1:03:51] door
[1:03:52] and god will reveal it to you now
[1:03:57] i uh most of you know i'm a software
[1:03:59] engineer and if if
[1:04:00] if i start stressing about the time and
[1:04:03] how long it's taking or something i have
[1:04:06] to do or i start stressing about
[1:04:07] something i
[1:04:08] i can't even think and i have to be able
[1:04:10] to think if i'm gonna get
[1:04:12] anything done if when you start
[1:04:15] stressing about it and you're getting
[1:04:16] worked up about it
[1:04:18] you're working right into the hands of
[1:04:20] the devil he wants to stress you out
[1:04:22] about it
[1:04:23] you say oh i i can't figure it out i
[1:04:26] don't understand what the preacher says
[1:04:27] and you're walking around and you're
[1:04:28] talking and you're thinking and you're
[1:04:30] trying to figure it out right
[1:04:33] no that's not going to get you anywhere
[1:04:36] you're
[1:04:37] at that point in time you're trying to
[1:04:39] solve
[1:04:40] your problem when it's as simple as this
[1:04:45] close the door say father
[1:04:50] can you tell me a little bit more about
[1:04:51] you and he's going to give
[1:04:54] you everything you need in
[1:04:58] due time amen in in
[1:05:01] the season if you read the story of
[1:05:03] corey ten boom
[1:05:05] she was traveling with her father on a
[1:05:07] train and she asked him a question
[1:05:09] about life in general and he said
[1:05:12] he she said he didn't answer they got to
[1:05:16] their destination they got up and he
[1:05:17] said
[1:05:18] corey can you grab me that suitcase she
[1:05:20] couldn't lift it
[1:05:22] and he said there are some things
[1:05:28] for you to know when you're strong
[1:05:30] enough to carry them
[1:05:32] the same thing he said the same thing
[1:05:33] god does he doesn't give us more
[1:05:35] than we can carry amen god is going to
[1:05:38] give you
[1:05:40] the desires of your heart god's going to
[1:05:41] give you everything you need in
[1:05:43] due time amen don't try to force the
[1:05:46] issue
[1:05:47] wait on god and he will come along and
[1:05:51] give you the strength
[1:05:53] so you say so you could say look at it
[1:05:55] like this i'm you're carrying a big
[1:05:57] burden in your life right now
[1:05:59] why i can hardly handle this
[1:06:03] guess what you wouldn't be carrying the
[1:06:05] burden
[1:06:06] unless your father knew you could carry
[1:06:09] it
[1:06:12] you wouldn't be going through what
[1:06:13] you're going through unless god knew
[1:06:15] you could handle it amen the next time
[1:06:17] you're tempted to do wrong
[1:06:19] remember he has enough faith in you
[1:06:22] for that temptation because he knows you
[1:06:25] will move beyond it in victory in christ
[1:06:30] amen the next time you're facing a
[1:06:32] battle
[1:06:33] you say you know
[1:06:36] praise the lord sometimes we'll just
[1:06:40] we'll just take a little fictional
[1:06:41] character here you have a
[1:06:43] a young man who's who's learning to
[1:06:45] fight
[1:06:46] and the old knight knows in great wisdom
[1:06:50] amen he sees you practicing with the
[1:06:53] sword and the shield
[1:06:55] and fighting for practice and then he
[1:06:58] says okay we're gonna
[1:06:59] you're gonna go over here and you're
[1:07:00] gonna fight this other guy
[1:07:05] you're you're nuts master and
[1:07:08] chief you're nuts i can't handle that no
[1:07:11] no it's okay you go do it
[1:07:13] the faith that god has in you amen
[1:07:16] should give you a boost of confidence
[1:07:19] that you can handle amen the battle that
[1:07:22] is before you
[1:07:24] amen praise the lord i think i think
[1:07:26] i've said that
[1:07:27] as many ways as i possibly can and then
[1:07:29] that god is not going to give you
[1:07:31] anything more than you can handle
[1:07:33] but if you find yourself guess what if
[1:07:35] you don't feed
[1:07:37] you're going to get weak and if you
[1:07:39] don't if you find yourself
[1:07:41] struggling to carry the burden or
[1:07:43] struggling to fight the battle
[1:07:45] go behind closed door and god will give
[1:07:47] you the strength
[1:07:49] for the victory in your life
[1:07:52] amen praise the lord amen praise the
[1:07:56] lord
[1:08:02] amen that's well you'll find
[1:08:09] then i read the scripture and i totally
[1:08:11] skipped over it
[1:08:12] i read the quote and then i moved on so
[1:08:13] we read the scripture in matthew 28
[1:08:16] where they go to the sepulcher where
[1:08:20] they're expecting to find
[1:08:22] their promised son buried
[1:08:26] but god comes
[1:08:29] and moves open that door man
[1:08:33] god wanted to reveal himself to you it's
[1:08:35] the same thing in our day because this
[1:08:37] is
[1:08:37] the rising of the sun he wanted to
[1:08:40] express
[1:08:40] himself to us so you we couldn't go
[1:08:44] they tried for six ages they tried to
[1:08:47] tap into it they got a little bit
[1:08:48] but they couldn't open up the door they
[1:08:51] couldn't open
[1:08:52] the tomb and bring out christ and then
[1:08:55] god had to do it an angel had to come
[1:08:58] and roll that stone away and when and
[1:09:01] when that
[1:09:01] happened amen that through that from
[1:09:03] that opened door
[1:09:05] then god could reveal himself to you
[1:09:08] and that was in history and like i said
[1:09:10] it's the same thing for you
[1:09:12] god's going to come and he's going to
[1:09:14] roll that stone away
[1:09:15] and reveal himself to you amen
[1:09:18] in his good time praise the lord now i
[1:09:21] know that was a bit
[1:09:22] short tonight but i believe you you can
[1:09:23] forgive me for that
[1:09:26] sister and means you guys want to come
[1:09:28] up tonight
[1:09:32] i had a um seasoned minister that i
[1:09:37] one time he said just get out
[1:09:40] speak the point don't try to fill in the
[1:09:42] words just say it
[1:09:44] and then move on so tonight we came out
[1:09:47] we said it we made the point that's what
[1:09:49] god led to my heart
[1:09:50] it only took 42 minutes but i don't know
[1:09:53] you have preachers that worry about
[1:09:54] preaching too long and i stress about
[1:09:56] preaching not long enough
[1:09:59] but god is faithful
[1:10:07] man god is faithful and
[1:10:11] sometimes you have services like tonight
[1:10:13] and just feel like you're sitting around
[1:10:15] a fire with pop of god
[1:10:18] and just hearing a little bit about him
[1:10:21] amen i love to spend time with him
[1:10:23] amen and if you're missing you know
[1:10:25] sometimes you get busy
[1:10:26] i know i know this will probably mostly
[1:10:28] be for married couples or
[1:10:31] but even just families you get busy you
[1:10:32] don't see each other right you're busy
[1:10:34] you're doing this
[1:10:35] you get busy in life and you're not
[1:10:36] seeing much of god
[1:10:38] you know you start to feel a little bit
[1:10:40] of a disconnect
[1:10:42] go find go on date go on a date go spend
[1:10:46] some time with christ
[1:10:47] and and you'll find that everything else
[1:10:50] runs a lot smoother
[1:10:54] just just does your house your house
[1:10:56] runs smoother when you
[1:10:57] put a little time into your wife praise
[1:11:00] the lord

[1:18:50] it's in a couple of weeks still but as a
[1:18:52] church let's be praying for the youth
[1:18:55] group that's going to
[1:18:57] peterson's camp um the 1st of june
[1:19:01] so just a few weeks away getting closer
[1:19:04] but
[1:19:04] i pray that we all would join together
[1:19:06] in prayer that god will do something
[1:19:08] special
[1:19:10] and keep us safe a bunch of crazy kids
[1:19:15] across the west remember but that god
[1:19:18] would do something special
[1:19:20] i want to find a balance
[1:19:24] but i say this i first felt the calling
[1:19:26] to preach at a camp
[1:19:27] i was 15 years old and under the
[1:19:30] presence god began to speak to my heart
[1:19:32] for that
[1:19:33] and then it was i was 18 years old and
[1:19:35] brother lindsey mcgrady was preaching
[1:19:37] and i was
[1:19:38] at another camp and in the middle of a
[1:19:40] sermon he pointed right at me and said
[1:19:41] don't be afraid to do what god has
[1:19:43] called you to do
[1:19:44] pinned me to my seat and i went home and
[1:19:47] i started preaching
[1:19:49] but god god does great things because of
[1:19:51] the atmosphere
[1:19:52] he can do things anywhere you go if the
[1:19:55] atmosphere is created
[1:19:57] amen but what happens is you have a
[1:19:58] bunch of people coming together who are
[1:20:01] there to create that atmosphere so great
[1:20:03] things happen
