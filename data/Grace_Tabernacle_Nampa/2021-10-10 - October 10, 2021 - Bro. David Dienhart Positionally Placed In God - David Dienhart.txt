saints down there if you have any needs on your heart just raise your hand as we were our prayerful sergeant if you come and our lord knows what's on our hearts sees your desires amen just bring them before him heavenly father a couple minutes ago it was our confession you are our reality that's the only reality we want our circumstances our troubles it's not reality it's just a small faith small shade but when you come when the sun rises lord everything disappears every shade every darkness lord and we know you are among us because you promised that because you're the same god we can we can

he's in the house who's house [Music] amen this house this house and if he's in this house he's in this house is that right you know where the house of god is it's not a building made with hands the bible makes that very clear it's a house that is not made with hands it's a created word a word creation that god made it's a mythical body mystical not mystical doesn't mean it's something far off it's a mystery but today the opening of the word the mystery is revealed we know where he dwells he dwells in his words is that right he dwells in his word but wherever his word is there he dwells amen hallelujah praise the lord good to be in the house of the lord this morning amen i'm glad to be here also i work for you just have a word of prayer before we go to the word let's bow our heads our heavenly father as we are here bowing our heads to the dust from which we came these bodies came but our hearts turned heavenward to the reality in revelation of your presence we are not dependent on man we are not dependent on self this morning we are totally dependent on the word that's in our midst living and father you gave that as our as our uh victory you gave that as our rest you gave that lord as as the very thing that we would defeat every devil every circumstance with was that word living in us and we know that that is perfect faith we thank you for that lord we give you praise for that and now lord we are expecting you to speak and to bless your word you know every individual that's here this morning you know every heart you know what's in that heart you know why they're here they haven't come on their own there was something inside of them that drawed them satan would not have wanted them to come to hear the pure word for the season preached so lord may we open our hearts to receive from you may you close our mind to the things of yesterday the things of our senses and may you open our hearts open our minds open up our soul through the channel lord of your word that we may receive and hear what you would have for us now we committed all to you and these lips are yours to speak and to bring forth what you have ordained i'm expecting that because lord as a man i can do nothing i can do nothing you said we can do nothing without you and lord we are so thankful that lord we are not dependent on man we are dependent upon you the living word the living christ that has revealed yourself in this day through your word to your bride we thank you for this lord we give you praise now in jesus christ's name amen amen with you just stand with me turn to ephesians chapter one i want to title this message this morning positionally placed in jesus christ positionally placed in jesus christ that's a big word and i pray that god will bring it down into the simplicity that it is the simplicity of the word is the word revealed in you you can't in your own human mind figure out god's word you'll never figure it out you can't intellectualize it it's got to be a revelation and then for that to happen the holy ghost has got to be in you amen amen so it's to it's to a people the word of god today is not to everyone the word of god is to a special class of people now who those people are i don't know i know individually what it is because i know i'm in i'm in that class individually not i'm not boasting it's by the grace of god through revelation that that is made known it's nothing i've done it's nothing you can do god didn't give us a book of rules to keep amen he made it very simple he said i have amen amen i will amen amen so it's not us figuring things out amen it's us believing what he said taking god at his word amen it's not it's it's it's you believing amen what he said in his word amen amen so so i want to title this positionally placed in christ and it's god's great army his body the bride and that's not the title the title is positionally placed in jesus christ but god's great army his body the bride and i i'm i'm wanting to to get us to realize your positive position your positive position and let me say it like this your eternal position now how positive is that your eternal position amen brother branham said this he said when the bride knows what she is when she knows what she is he said it'll take the rapture or other words she will take a body change when she knows what she is no man can teach you that it's not based on your emotions it's god reveals it to you amen that's that's what it has to be and that's what it is and that's what it will be amen in the in the message and i don't want to keep you standing but on page 15 of the church age book i just feel to read this now i thought i'd read it let me touch back on it again but on page 15 very familiar quote satan fights revelation he cannot stand revelation we know the bride loves it because with divine revelation in her life the gates of hell cannot stand against that revelation of christ in you with the revelation of the word there's nothing there's no gates of hell can stand against the revelation of the word amen and he said if the people get the true revelation and we know she will get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she knows who she is she knows her position she knows where she stands she can impart eternal life to a believer amen amen she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army we're talking about an army here so obviously we're talking about fighting we're not on a picnic we are in a battle and i'll just say this right now we are in the greatest battle the greatest the greatest battle ever fought is being waged right now right here in this little tabernacle this meeting place right here on the battleground of your mind the greatest battle ever fought is being waged every day death and life are in their final struggle truth and air are in their struggle amen life and death is in its struggle amen amen she'll be invincible she cannot when she knows what she is she's impossible for her to be defeated and when you know that what kind of a manifestation would it be through you amen all right so if if they when they if they get but when they get a true revelation because they are of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church spirits we're not worrying against flesh and blood we're warring against spirits and the bride is only in tune to receive one that's the word for the season amen so when you get a revelation of two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit because you know your position discern and withstand the antichrist spirit that is so close to the real it would deceive the elective possible and you can't discern the difference because of their emotion and their actions you only can discern the difference by revelation by the holy spirit the only that's the only discern today the word of god is a deserter the word that is quick and powerful living in operative is only as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen all right so satan by that revelation by god's spirit will be definitely powerless before her amen satan hates revelation but we love it ephesians 1 you have that you have it okay let me read one other thing here on the super sign before we turn to that scripture 1963 11 29 super size say that for those on the internet i know and and god bless those that are on the internet i know i have a cousin in montana that's on the internet with us every sunday and his wife and and there's others i've even had others say we go on the internet and hear your service we're not supporting and provoking internets we're from we're promoting the word amen right amen and so we i'm bringing this so that they write it down and they go and look it up all right so 11 29 63 is called the super sign there and it's there is a man a prophet indeed he's talking about john the baptist he had a sign that he had to watch are we hearing we had a prophet too amen that also fulfilled like john the baptist was sent to forerun the coming word before on the coming and he was on earth at the time of his coming because he introduced him and bride i've introduced you to him he can't pregnant a bride and not be here can't marry bride and not be here there's a union going it can't be a union unless he is here so the mystery of the seventh seal is his coming all right so he said here he said he had a sign he had to watch where was the sign it was in heaven what's the sign that caught the attention of the prophet what's the sign that catches our attention amen what is this sign on sunset mountain he had a sign he had to watch and when he seen the messiah he was sure that he was coming in his day he was so positive oh if the church now he turns it right back over here to the bride oh if the church could only get its positive position he had to introduce the messiah oh if the church could only get its positive position if it would only know its stand in this hour the bible says without us there must be something very important that's been unveiled in this hour for without us they the ages could not be made perfect without this perfect word revealed to us that's hidden beneath the book in the book book's been opened right it's sent to claim a bride amen and when the book was opened and a voiced as a lion roar seven thunders under their voices and that's the mystery that will bring the bride into a body change and that mystery can only be revealed to the bride she's the only one that can hear that absolutely right all right now it would only know it stand in this hour for according to the scripture he was the one to introduce the messiah and he knowed he had to be on earth in the days of his prophecy therefore he was lingering near to where he was preaching so much that he said there's one standing among you now now brother sister now there's one standing among you now he said that when he was here on earth also there's also one standing among you now but we know it's now also that you don't know who doesn't know the public there's no idea of it but this isn't hid from the bride it can't be let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come amen see standing among you now that you don't know one among you right now he knew it he knew it he was there the hour was at hand now he said i've introduced you to him now i've got to decrease and he will increase what's he increasing to to a meeting in the air no body change all right i don't i don't want to keep you standing but this just a moment spoken words original seed 62 3 18 as the end time prophecies will repeat i believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner how many know what that second forerunner was the second forerunner of what the second coming see we're in the advent of the second coming of who christ all right now he says the end time prophecies repeat i believe the forerunner came to the wilderness cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word-born bride where's the lamb the lamb opened the seals where's the revelation where's the resurrection we're living in where is he pride form amen for what purpose for our meeting we have to have a spiritual union before we get there amen all right the prophet said now we see this day this scripture is being fulfilled in our midst ephesians 1 4 according as he hath chosen us in him i'm talking about your position now your positive position talking about the bride that god's army soldiers individual according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world praise the lord it didn't have a thing to do i didn't have anything to do with it i still don't i david still doesn't it's not my achievement it's god's achievement [Music] it's not me unveiled it's god unveiled amen are you with me all right now watch he said before the foundation of the world we were chosen in him that we should be holy and without blame before him in love now who's going to say it can't happen who's going to say it doesn't happen all right verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption placing of children by jesus christ position then adoption of children by jesus christ according to the good pleasure of whose will good thing it's not my will good thing it's not david's will you may be seated i won't keep you standing anymore amen unto the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace its grace see and what are we crying to the headstone our message is the capstone what are we crying grace grace unto it right nothing but grace grace isn't something you manufactured grace is a divine enablement that enabled you and placed you in him before the foundation of the world to hear the word in your season day and be the very manifestation of it that's the bride stand that's the bride's position all right now let's turn over here and let me just bring up something behind this ephesians 1 4 to the faithful now paul in the first verse he says paul an apostle this is ephesians 1 1 apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus listen to what the prophet says about this he said to the faithful in christ jesus now this letter is addressed to those not to the outside world paul wasn't preaching a sermon to the unsaved he was preaching to the saved the called out the separated the set aside and the faithful in the call now that's who he's addressed it to those in jesus the believer's position in christ that's who's he's addressed it to in jesus the believer's position is in christ and christ will only meet the believer can only the believer can only worship christ as he is positionally placed in christ now brother brown knew that didn't go over very well and he said i don't believe you get it so he said let me go another route look a believer cannot worship and has no right to worship neither do you have to take communion i'm just going to drop that in because i could go quote after quote on that all right he said you have no right to worship you cannot worship have no right to worship no man has a right to worship the lord outside of being in the body of the lord jesus christ how do you get in that body by one holy ghost baptism by one spirit are you placed in that body amen hallelujah all right let's go to jeremiah 29 29 11. i was pushed here at this going on and i didn't even get them marked down so i'll look them up as you look above 29-11 maybe that's better anyway let's just start with verse 10. i'm emphasizing 11 here but there's so much here first few verses for thus saith the lord that after 70 years that's the type of our seven ages that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you here's you is there any you here this morning causing you to return to this place now they had a a land a natural land we have a spiritual land we have an inheritance we have an eden to come to amen we have a position to come to in this place to to return to this place not only in eden but a position that he's restored in this day to us so that we can return to eden i will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place where'd they start they got to come back to where they started in christ all right verse 11 i love this for i know i just love this is thus saith the lord amen speaking to individuals this morning for i know the thoughts that i think toward you when once i'll allow to get that in a minute i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord see sayeth the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end you know what brother sister bride you the cat you that's filled with the holy ghost your future's clear i'm not saying you won't have trials and tests and persecutions but your future is clear you're going to the other side i don't care what happens in the middle my brother spoke to that wednesday night the storm or was it i don't remember sunday or wednesday the storm but that didn't keep him from going the other side he was in their midst he was present they had they didn't recognize their position amen all right to give them an expected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me see when you get to your position you shall pray you shall call unto me you shall go and pray unto me i'll hearken unto you why it's my thoughts being expressed then you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart where's that happening today very few they'd rather search the internet they'd rather search their games they'd rather search something else besides searching the scriptures searching the word seeking and you shall find me search for me and i will be found of you hallelujah saith the lord and i'll turn your way your captivity and i'll gather you from all the denominations for us it's denominations it's denominational spirits amen i'll gather you out of all the nations and from all the places whether i've driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again into the place wherein i cause you to be carried away captive i will restore saith the lord amen amen amen hallelujah all right revelations 1. revelations chapter 1 verse 5. it's a salutation to start with verse 4 john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is him grace from him which is which and which was and which is to come from the seven spirits which are before the throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness amen and you are my witnesses which is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the first begotten of the dead first one up amen who are you the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god amen concerning jeremiah 29 11 we just read now according to the word of god and let me just quote to you saint john 15 16 you know it jesus said you have not chosen me but i have chosen you now according to the word of god the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world the choosing of the bride was purpose in himself that purpose was purposed in himself ephesians 1 9 you can find it and in romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of god according to election might stand amen who elected it he did how he elected by what he knew is that right or knowledge all right the purpose of god you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take up the eternal the heart purpose listen the eternal prayer the heart purpose strong words this is god's own heart purpose it's god's only eternal purpose was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself praise the lord if that purpose with himself his purposes are perfect and complete not movable not changeable his purpose is perfect amen amen he won't change his purpose see of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal him being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world before you did either good or bad works before either either boy jacob or esau that he works they were chosen one he loved the other he hated before either one of them did any works amen jacob i loved esau hated is that right because jacob was his seed jacob was in himself jacob was jacob was the thought of god himself not the only thought but was a part of that thought of himself amen that's why he loved jacob all right now hold that paragraph 149 2 of the church age book watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was god god is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was so he was at that time potentially god and he was known only as an eternal spirit and the bride was already in his mind i just read here jeremiah 29 11 i know the thoughts that i think towards you brother branham said what about those thoughts of god they are eternal are they not amen uh-oh what about those thoughts of god i know those thoughts concerning you you were chosen himself therefore you are eternal i know those thoughts concerning you what about those thoughts they are eternal they are eternal thoughts there's only one form of eternal life that's god there is no other form of eternal life you cannot have eternal life and not be from god or of god not from god of god amen the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see this you will see many things if you can just get your position and recognize that this eternal is standing here in a body of time that he the person you are the word that you are the thought of god expressed in flesh is eternal it creates a different it creates a difference it makes you act different it makes you walk different so much so it offends the carnal man because they think whoever you think you are i'm just as eternal thought i'm his eternal word expressed in flesh that's what they killed jesus for you being a man make yourself god you say you're the son of god he said doesn't your word say that i said you are god's and how can you condemn me when i say i'm the son of god i came from god it was god it was god himself in some form and this is god himself in bride form god bless god with us god in us get your position people yeah amen are you okay is this okay let's just let's just keep bringing it down to the word a promise for the season we have a mighty unveiling of god in this hour the mystery that's been sealed in the book has been taken by the lamb and has been loose to the bride this unveiled mystery is the unwritten word that's been unwritten all along john couldn't write it it's been an unwritten word is now unveiled in you all right so they are eternal they are real his thoughts are god of god the thoughts of god do you realize when he thought of you he thought of himself the thoughts of god are real the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they're not just they're just not something that's the play thing it's just them it's imagination they're real they're more real than you are in this body they're more real than what you see they are not temporal they're eternal glory to god amen all right this purpose this choosing this bride was in himself it was purpose in himself this was a part of himself he had to fulfill that part of himself this mystery was kept a mystery until the book was taken by the lamb in this day and seven seals were open and what it is that you unveiled is a still small voice and when the seventh seal opened it was a still small voice that's right that's exactly what it is that voice voice brother braham said that sealed been opened they say it's want to be closed brother braham said no it's open there's a voice in there amen amen and when elijah heard the voice it wasn't out here in the whirlwind and the earthquake and the hell that we said as our brother brought it wednesday it wasn't out there it was in her it was in him it was in him and elijah represented brother ramsey represented the church right there hallelujah there is their representation there is the thing the devil's trying to keep hid but it was kept hid from him since the foundational world in the back part of god's mind and he said i'll make it known when it's supposed to be known and it'll rapture a bride and the rapture's in progress brother braham said he said on the message god in simplicity albuquerque after the seals he said how do you know the bride how do you know the bride the rapture is not going on all the time he said pretty soon there's going to be one he said how do you know the last one will be caught up so on these days there's being a caught up are you being caught up you can say what a resurrection that was what about this one right amen what about this resurrection inside of you what a resurrection that is is that right amen all right so you see they're real they're eternal they're they are already real these thoughts of god are already real you can't stop eternity it never began and never did end do you realize who you are do you realize your position you're undefeatable you're invincible you the word living are invincible quit looking at the flesh man is ups and downs that's not even who you are the devil's pointing into that and you've got a choice you have a you have a power of choice to say no devil no i refuse to let you point me to that hallelujah that's exactly right you just don't recognize your authority because you don't know your position there you are well do i need to know that yes in order to make a rapture you're going to have to know it you've got to come to that and it'll take the holy ghost to do that you're saying well brother i need the holy ghost i'll tell you right now i'll tell you something right now the reason there's not more born again is because there's not been a true repentance that's another message in itself but there's got to be a godly sorrow a repentance of faith acceptance of what god did for you in faith and recognize you were there when he died for you you died for you there's got to be an acceptance of faith a real repentance then comes water baptism then comes the sanctifying power of the blood and i shall fill you with myself god can't lie the reason there's not many filled because there's not many true repentance that's exactly what it is amen there's not been a true repentance i'd like to preach on that i i have that in my heart i almost took it this morning no godly sorrow for sin oh i saw my friend do it i think i'll be baptized too i don't work there's got to be a repentance there's got to be a repentance of faith there's got to be turning around there's got to be an acceptance of what god did for you recognizing he did that for you godly sorrow for your sin laying yourself on the altar testifying of it that i died with him i raised him you're testifying publicly this is what's happening on the inside of me many are just go down a dry centering up a wet one because there's not been a true repentance i'll let that lay right there all right things that are to be now then when he came to the earth when god was manifested in fullness in jesus when he came to the earth this is 1205 65 things that are to be when he came to the earth and was manifested in flesh you were in him then because he was the word he was the fullness of the word the thoughts of god were expressed in a word he was the fullness of the word you were there then how do you know you have the evidence of it by the revelation of himself in you build my church upon the revelation of who i am the gates of hell shall not prevail against and if they're built upon the revelation of who he is then who are you when you grow up and build can't be another it just can't be another it's got to be him in the bride form amen because he had to fulfill the mystery of himself a full revelation of himself and that was spoken of and ministered to us by revelation 10 7 and now we have a book and we should be eating it to see the revelation and the mystery and the fullness of the of god the mystery of god finished which is you hallelujah amen amen but too many things are coming in too many thinking too much this and too much of that and too much running and brother sister we have things to do i'm not condemning that but you've got to take time it should never anything else ever have preeminence over you i don't care if it's jobs or what it is over the word of god you do that then it's become an idol to you you're bowing to it he has to have first place what did the word say about your life your walk what the words say about this situation that situation instead you want to go to your reasoning oh you're a femoral agent i'm coming to that you have a choice thank god for the power of choice that's not a negative thing that's a very positive thing because we can choose when something presented on the battlefield we can choose either take it or leave it amen people are in a turmoil they're upset they're discouraged they're dismayed they're they're beat down you can see it on their life why because they're not receiving the word they're believing a lie the devil's bringing it through their gates of reasoning imagination memory or conscience we're going to come to something here god will help me get through this all right not say if you will he does you were in him then when he came the earth manifested in flesh you were in him then because he was word in the beginning was the word the word was with god are you with me and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were when you were in him you walked with him when he was there on earth you walked with him you suffered with him you died with him you was buried with him and now you are risen with him amen your wisdom your risen your risen do you hear me bride do you hear the word this morning when he raised you raised hell is defeated the devil is defeated they're underneath his feet uh your feet he's defeated he can't live anymore he's gone he's defeated but he he'll become alive if you let him i'm talking about doubt i'm talking about unbelief i'm talking about the presentation of something contrary to the word in your mind in the battleground you can either take the faith that's in your heart that god presented to you or you're going to take doubt it's got to come from one of two sources one or two powers brother sister bride my fathers my sisters you're in the battle you are in a battle amen i'm in a battle every day we're in a battle but we are absolutely victorious we're not on a losing side there's nothing in the bible said the bride's a loser christ isn't a loser how can she be a loser christ is sinless how can she not be anything but sinless she's in him this message of this hour this opening of these seals wasn't sent everyone it was sent to only the bride this is what will bring about rapturing faith and it's happening it's happening the rapture is in progress and there's many going to be left behind because they thought well i belong to a message church i was a participator in the message but you missed possession got to be a possessor if there's even a draw of god in your heart if there's even a inkling of a desire run to it don't run away from it run into it there's only one thing going to satisfy that thirst and it won't be anything of your flesh of your thinking of the world nothing not a magazine not a picture nothing sports i don't care what it is nothing will satisfy that thirst but the thirst quencher which is jesus christ in you hallelujah you walked with him you were in him you risen with him and now you're a manifested attribute of god an attribute think of it you're an attribute nobody can take your position nobody can take your place nobody can bring the word like brother chris nobody can bring the word like brother paul nobody else can bring it like i bring it but we're all in him it's an attribute are you with me it's a measure of himself so denominational spirits are out of the question we're not one because of our church we're one because we're in christ amen christ can't fail you're now seated in heavenly places already raised resurrected to new life and setting in heavenly places in christ jesus already what what is there to fear why are you why are we being so have so much anxiety and so fretful do you not believe that he's in control do you see your position feed people feed ask god to reveal the word to you well i just read a little scripture a day and that's good that's fine but oh i said amen i did a little prayer no drink and drink and drink a little more and push out what's in you already that's hungering and thirsting for more of god amen amen amen already raised that means that means so much to us nowadays church that means so much to see so much to us to see ourself individual individual you he's speaking to you this morning he's speaking to you he's dealing with you you he's dealing because he loves you he wants you to surrender and give yourself completely to him lay your veil on his shoulders he cares for you he knows what you're going through be happy you have nothing to be discouraged over start looking at the things that god's done not what you wish would happen let go of your reasoning let go of your thinking well it's got to be this way release your thinking about it god is sovereign he'll do what he wants to do but he's perfect in all he does we don't add our thinking into it i don't say i don't know sometimes these scriptures come together i think where it's happening i don't know where to go just keep moving just keep going and it fits it fits god works those many things contrary to our reasoning even radical to our own human thinking let go of it the devil wants to capitalize on that wants to capitalize on your feelings want to capitalize well this one did this one to me what did you do oh well self in the picture it's him it's her no it's you you just haven't completely totally become dependent on your husband you're flirting with the devil am i saying you're cast away no i'm saying repent get back line back up with the truth god isn't saying this to put you down he's saying this to release you to set you free this light is coming forth this morning for that purpose i don't like the way you preach and let go of how i preach listen to the word they didn't like john the baptist either in fact jesus looked upon him with angered eyes they didn't like that either when he said he's god in the flesh see it's our own stinking thinking that gets in the way own carnal mind but you don't have to be that way you don't have to let that happen when you know your position you know you've been given free moral agency to make a choice you don't have to accept what the devil is presenting to you eve did not have to accept but she stopped to listen and the devil swept in reasoned with her why god wouldn't keep his word you let that same devil come down here and move you through your senses and your reasoning and your imagination and your memory either to move you away from the word faith does not reason faith believes the word you don't have to put your reasoning in your your thinking upon the word and put your own your own opinion in it the words perfect the word is complete the word is flawless the word is my absolute right perfect in itself and unlimited in its power how can you add anything to a perfect how can you take away anything to a perfect so quit trying to do it you either believe in your soul you believe or you don't believe right then let that dominate that mind let that dominate that battlefield let the word dominate you place it you place it god's waiting to see what your decision is you place the word amen when satan comes with that you either accept it or reject it you either give the word the release and say this is what's written this is written satan i don't believe anything else you're telling me this is god's word amen i passed out to reason i kept south your thinking right you say well how well he might come and say how is he going to do it how can you do that how can you get well being you've been 25 years in such a condition i get well because god said so he can't lie he said he healed me that sells it let the word settle it means so much to see ourselves positionally placed the devil is almost harmless 311 62 greatest battle ever fought the devil is almost harmless unless he have something to work in you remember those devils that were cast out of legion that he had they want to do more mischievousness so they wanted to go in the hogs so devils must have something to work in somebody to work through and you let or don't let amen i didn't hear any men boy this is pretty silent you know that's the truth you let or don't let do you know your position in christ you know the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart the word of faith the word of faith faith takes this final resting place anchored place in the living word in the word of god that's where it rests it doesn't move from that it's finished as long as you hold that there devil cannot punch a hole through it we just don't know our position yet too many other things the devil's brought before you that takes up the time instead of the thing the channel that god comes through to reveal it to you faith comes by hearing the word yes sir that's right because faith rests in the word yes amen i'm talking about god's faith there's two kinds of faith brother branson what we're talking about on perfect faith we're talking about a different kind of faith we're talking about perfect faith all right that's the way god does too he has to have us he's depending on us to work through us not to your not to your your carnal mind oh bless god i have this and that word but no fruit of the season no fruit for the word for the season you're trying to get you're trying to get you're trying to get an uh a relationship with god so your carnal works it don't work it don't work when you're running out there leaving your own position where you ought to be in the ministry god gave you you're running out there flirting with other things because you don't take the word you can't see the word you're missing it and if you're missing it then not discerning what scripture or not you lack the holy ghost think you have it because you shouted or did some great thing or prophesied i still sign you got the holy ghost that may be a sign that the holy ghost spoke if it's the truth but that's no sign that you have the word yourself in the soul it's not been birthed yet because you're not discerning what's truth in air you're missing you're basing that on some something in the past some like motion some feeling well it happened i did this but where's the revelation of the word in your life now all right i was standing with brother wood i've got to hurry with this just get to a couple things before i close i was standing with brother wood and brother sophman about 10 o'clock at night he's still in the messy greatest battle ever fought and i was looking up towards the sky at a great awe came over me and i said just look all that great heavenly host and i said everything is perfectly in harmony and i thought of the order of that heavenly host and one of them not one of them is out of place everyone keeps its time perfectly now you tell me who achieved that god did he put it there amen he placed it they work according to his timepiece it's his achievement do you realize that the holy ghost in you and bringing you through the word by revelation is god's achievement and that he's going to bring you exactly to like those stars amen in heaven in their position the great army in their place everything moving by the word of god you get a bride that recognizes what she is and watch what will happen you get every member to recognize that's all it's waiting on their position there's nothing going to stop a body change it's already working it's already in me god's bringing me right to that place step by step in the light you see in him was life and the life was the light in used life anybody here got eternal life where's the light now in him was life and the life was the light are we in him amen what's his message light amen amen amen that was a simple way to say it but that's the truth so what are you jesus said you're the light amen because you're in me you're part of me i'm in you you and me in that day you'll know this you won't imagine this this is going to be known you're i'm in you you and me i'm in my father father and me i and you you and me all that god was he poured to christ all christ was is where where's god where's christ what's your position is this revealed in your heart or are you just playing church and playing the message putting other things before him no zeal because you have no discernment of what the message is i'm not saying you're not sanctified but i see these things and we see and and your fruit is bearing for something that's not discernment of god whether it's in dressing whether it's what you do your your fruit your bearing it's wrong fruit amen all right what's the fruit the word for the season it's not ministering the word for the season what's the word for the season see all right now and when i begin to think that not one of those stars get out of their place not one of them get out of their place they're all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them what about the moving of the bride of them of them for a cause it's for a cause and will affect this earth you say well in the natural effects this earth we know that we've seen that stars line up move into the position they affect the earth is that right what about you as a star getting in your position i wonder how much earth it would affect i wonder if it would affect this earth i wonder if it affect the earth's of others and really bring out what's in their heart by the preaching of the truth is that right exactly right you just watch that little bride get to moving in the position she's in it stirs up things some take offense the others say it's just what i've been looking for praise be to god i'm released it's the difference takes one separates one take one leave one take one leave one take one leave one individual take one leave one you say that's not happening it is oh there's a combining going on and it's under a mighty wind of the holy ghost and it's shaking things up because there's a bride seeing her position and knowing who she is and knowing she's the word of promise for this hour made manifest she sees him she knows he's present god let us see what we're looking at or let us let us look at what we're seeing really see it amen god open our eyes it has to be by revelation you can't intellectualize it you can't i can tell you by revelation what i'm seeing and i can't explain it to you you talk about a paradox but god made it that way in fact he said he would say things in such a way to separate some to make some to leave make some to ponder is that right but when you know that you know who you are in and who's in you there's nothing going to shake that revelation brother sister you can't shake it there's no shaking to it oh it's shaking it they tried satan will try to shake it and try to do everything he can to shake it but it can't be moved amen amen amen amen hallelujah all right so i thought then if that it's effective it he said he says effective they move into other spots it's effective it affects everything and i thought then if that great heavenly host like that to keep its place is making everything in order what about the disorder of the earthly host amen when one gets out of order throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit if this group gathered under this roof this morning would be in such harmony that the holy spirit would place every member of the body would place that's here this morning in such harmony till there would till their till there would be a spontaneous healing of of spirit and body it'll just if we just hold our position healing of the soul also you know and well i won't touch on that and the only thing that he is waiting for is for his army to get their position the only thing that he's waiting for is for his army to get their position like the stars get the position i think that's worth reading again the only thing that he's waiting for is for his army to get their position like the stars get the position that's why the seven seals were opened [Music] when this great battle started earth the mind was chosen because decisions were made decisions were made in the mind but those decisions came from some source don't you miss that because it isn't just the decision of your carnal mind it had to come from a source but displaced in that mind that's where the decisions made you act on one or the other amen you say one or the other one or other power amen are you with me all right there's only two powers you've got to make he said it's the battleground of your mind he said he said that's where you meet your enemy and you've got to make your choice it meets you god is waiting wanting and waiting to see what your decision is see he's partnered with you he's partnered with man now what's your decision you speak the word how many is in that harmony i've got if i can get to it the lord willing here you speak the word he said i'll perform it right all right what word faith in a word the word the scripture the the thought revealed in a word amen amen all right that's where satan meets you is in the mind if you know your position in christ then what is your decision in the trial the test the circumstance or that thought presented to you contrary to the word what's your decision decisions are made in the mind not by your carnal mind but they are made by the mind of christ in your soul amen are you with me i'm talking to the believer your position see your positions your position in the battle and your position positions in the battle you meet satan on the battlefield your mind with the word the sword of the holy spirit the atomic bomb so because the decision is brought from the word or the decision is brought from what satan presented you either let or don't let you let the word or you shut the door and open the other whatever you put on the battlefield you're going to listen to him or you're going to refuse it when you know your position you wouldn't refuse it i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't re you'd refuse him satan you would refuse that reasoning see all right because the mind because you're because your soul has christ you have the mind of christ so where's your decision from your feelings your senses or the mind of christ you are a free moral agent you bring the word you bring it in the channel of your thought you have to bring the word into the channel of your thought you are a free moral agent to choose what's in what you choose what's in your soul faith or accept what the senses are telling you doubt fear reasoning etc just what i said now don't you let satan fortify nothing you keep the word fortified amen he said that's what i'm trying to get you to do out there anoint you he said that's what that's what he's trying to do each one of you out there is to anoint you that satan is and the only thing you have to do now that's what he that's what he tried to get each one of you to do out there anoint you and the only thing you have to do now and you're a free moral agent now you can accept it if you want to but kick it out thank god for decision if eid hadn't accepted that moment if she had to stop that moment to listen don't stop for nothing don't stop now you can accept it if you want to but kick it out if eve if see don't listen don't stop for nothing don't stop i went into a football stadium one time and going to preach and i stopped at the door now listen i'm not going to be very much longer here just just listen i went into a football stadium he said and above the door it said it's not the size of the dog in the fight you've heard this many times it's not the size of the dog we don't walk by sight we walk by faith so it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog now that's a big dog over here this brother jason's a big dog but am i going to look at how big he is it's not what determines the fight inside of him what determines it he'll be a big dog with a lot of fight or he can be a little guy with a lot of fight too and i'm a little guy but we're brothers and we both have the same fight in us that fight is the word amen so it's not the size of the dog it's the size of the fight amen that wins the battle you say well look at all these great churches all these other things and these things against it doesn't matter what's against it it's faith in the individual if you're a coward get back to your cuddle hole but brother if you're a soldier stand out there there's a battle on right and wrong is engaged let's fight take off your coat and bear right into it just keep going one objective we're going to win why you know your position you've got to win you're the word word can't lose the word living in operative the prophet said the bride is the word living and in action the word is living in operative that's what the word of god is there's your rest your rest is your husband you've entered into rest you've entered into the himself you found rest you cease from your labors your position is in him amen amen amen all right called the bride is called chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing did you catch that all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right along coming down to meet him they know the thunders will issue the thing forth pretty soon issue what body change all right here we see life and death we already said that psalm 16 8 said do as david did brother brown said just put him first i put the lord first in everything i do see i put him first set him before you i set the lord always before me he is on my right hand he is my power and authority i put him first i set him before me when this doesn't go right place god when that doesn't go right place god whatever happens place god put the word there satan can batter only once he can he can he can try to he can try to whatever he may try to do punch punch punch just keep the word right there put the word in you living that word living in you quickened in you put that word written right here say lord show me make it known to me reveal it to me lord amen this is what you said i didn't say it you said it in my heart is that faith that wrote this word that faith that holds that word that faith that anchors that word is in me and i take this word amen amen because i'm identified son of god by the holy spirit identifying that the faith is in me is your faith then i'm taking this word and it becomes my word therefore it's written it's written here it's only written here it's written right here i believe what it said and i'm putting it into force i'm putting the blood into effect i'm placing the blood over this matter hallelujah amen all right i'm trying to close now the debt the token the price has been paid the price of our salvation no one could pay it but christ not a denomination not a spirit of a pope not the spirit of some man or saint but the spirit of jesus christ upon the church is a token that the debt has been paid he's recognized you the token is required that he's recognized you in him i believe the blood brother david that's good i do too but do you have the token i believe the blood brother david i do too that's right but have you been recognized that life in that blood is upon you in you evidence let me get to another portion here two or three and i've got to leave all right now apply the token apply the token that you and your father are one i and you you and me apply the token apply the token of his resurrection apply it right don't look at the things that are seen we look not at the things they're seeing but the things that are not seen amen amen amen walk by it by sight but by faith what are we trying to do what are we saying here let's fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life faith in you brother brahm said perfect faith message he said faith in you is the believer amen faith is a no soul not a hope so faith is a revelation christ in you god's great revelation that seven sunder mystery of the seventh seals unveiled in you a still small voice not knowing everybody it's known to you it voiced the small still means a quiet voice spoken in silence oh you say seventh seal spoke oh that's a voice hallelujah right what a mighty voice not loud not but a mighty voice it changed me it changes you it's the mystery of his coming amen do you know your position oh i said here she is here here he is here he is word born bride do you know your position positively see all right do you know you're impregnated with life let's look at a couple things here i don't have time to go into everything i can't i'm just i've got to close but i just wrote here he has made his kings and priests i just read that in opening scripture he has made you victorious over death over hell over the devil over the world over darkness right now you reign as kings and priests because you become in union with him because he took he became your sin he became sin he more than just took it he became sin that you would become you could become and do our become his righteousness you're in union with him he's the firstborn of that new creation you're that creation i i have a lot that i want to bring on those things but i'm just going to speak it right there because we're in union with him jesus said a body has self-prepared me that body where he dwells that's his chosen place of worship that body is his word living because he's in that body amen amen that's his body hallelujah and the bride is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone she is him she is his body the word manifested upon this earth veil behind skin we see the mighty god unveiled what a statement what a statement all right not i because i made it it's the truth it's just alive the great revelation of christ in you that's what the seals unveiled amen that's what the book of revelation was all about it was god it was jesus revealing himself in his church amen yes sir that's exactly what it was about amen amen amen amen do you know you're loosed by the blood and it's a perfect blood that's loosed you washed you released you there is now no condemnation to them that in christ none you'll never he's already taken your judgment he's already freed you he's delivered you there is no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus and those that are in christ jesus are not walking after the flesh i'm not saying the flesh doesn't try to get you walk by it but he's already recognized you in him he's already recognized when you're in christ sealed in there that's what's got to be brother sister this is this is the capstone ceiling you've got this you've got to be sealed in there yeah when you know you're sealed in there nothing can touch that nothing can break that seal i preached that last time here nothing going to break that seal you are eternally is you are eternal life right nothing nothing that's that's that seal is is for your security to your destination that seal determines it shows who the owner is and that seal is a finished work that settles it right nothing's going to break through that seal until it gets to its destination nothing can open see because the seal has already been opened and you're found inside amen amen satan can't get in there you'd have to come through the blood to get where you are and you can't do it all right he hath made us salvation is his doing and we reign not right now we're reigning over a spiritual kingdom by one jesus christ amen i was trying to find this this statement here where he made that but i i don't know yeah here it is ah no it isn't all right just a moment um well okay but anyway the act here you'll recall did the the mention the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages there you are and unless the holy spirit gives us revelation we'll fail to get it amen it's his this book of revelation we're studying he said is himself is the actual revelation of himself in the church my my my then you wonder what the finished mystery is amen it's a complete revelation of jesus christ all right now let me just grab this i think i'm gonna have to bypass i know i am i don't want to but i got two i may have to make it part two on this lower body okay we've prepared me beginning of the creation of god you're that creation you're another creation you're his creation you are a new race you can all read that amen all right i'll finish with this we have his name i'm finishing with this we have his name we should bear his name and remember we are now as the bride pregnanted with his spirit oh my the church bearing children see what are we bearing who's this one that's alive in you every member is bearing a word child a new creation a new race that's hid behind this skin right here every one of us that's what the new birth is what is this new birth it's jesus christ birth in you that's a word child amen amen all right he said and now as his bride pregnanted with his spirit the church bearing children see pregnant by his spirit with his name bearing his name see it's matthew 1 18. holy ghost overshadowed her what she had in her was not of mary neither was it of joseph it was a word child amen is that right all right all right so he said bearing children see impregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bearing his name burying his life bringing forth the signs of life evidence with the preeminences evidence is the evidence of his resurrection showing that he's not dead but alive forevermore this is eternal life and vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him amen he said phew how do you know because you're a church member no no because christ is living through you so pregnant with his spirit you're a prisoner to anything else you're confined to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth is that is that because you're a prisoner you can't commit adultery you're already pregnated glory you can't it can't take a hold he can't take a hold the womb of life is closed anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life i made say amen that seed has come to life this is not this is not a public this is i mean uh a group affair this is an individual affair how many amen see that seed has come to life no world can get in oh i'd like to stay on that about an hour i'm sure you understand christ and his alone already finished the seat was there the seed was already there when when it when was it put there before the foundation of the world has predestinated us unto eternal life and as soon as that life-giving flow the seed laying there other seeds would just come in and wouldn't take hold just remember they couldn't do it but when that seed come in quickly it stopped up the womb all the rest of the seed was drove out like that you become a prisoner surrounded in christ christ in you his life bringing forth his evidence his sign oh my my look bringing his signs of life as an evidence of his resurrection proving to the world that eternal life vindicates to the world that you were alive in him think of it alive in god our redeemer who created us for the very same purpose the church his creative life in us the whole thing is god and man one god and man was one there and god and man is one here what is it being filled with the spirit him having the preeminences that was god's achievement that's god's purpose to do that that he might be in that he might be in christ in christ in us and all of us together one the holy spirit the same thing see it's a holy union brother sister it's the same thing it's revealed he it revealed it to christ now it reveals it here amen can you see the second fold of his threefold manifestation is he revealed in christ christ has revealed it here poured himself into christ christ now in you amen hallelujah he does not change it's god in man that's his manifestation god and man that's what he's revealing that's what he's trying to do god's own word revealing it shows that man cannot create god's a creator and it ain't in man it it ain't man no more it's god the creator in man moses could say say god told moses let there come frogs he said let there come frog see see it's the same spirit that said let the water be turned to wine amen same thing see it's the same god same one then i had written on here same one let there be a squirrel see the same one what about the same one now what's the message ring doing to bring forth himself in you to finish the mystery of himself that's god's great revelation that's the positionally placed bride she sees her position what is her position jesus christ you say oh it couldn't be yes it is there's no other position she has only one position you see the thing that people do they get to look at the flesh and say it can't be it can't be i'm not talking about the elder man i'm talking about this word revealed in me this new creation this new birth of jesus christ in you that's who you are that's the real you it's not this you make this god it's antichrist this isn't god but because god's in me the flesh is veiling him who is it walking see jesus said himself you judge after the flesh he said it's not the flesh why you being a man make yourself god they couldn't see it they just couldn't see the word unveiled for the hour that the word had to become flesh who was that god was god was veiled behind skin and god's veil behind skin today the same god and it's none other but jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever that's his bride it's god and man god and man are he said and it ain't man no more it's god the creator in man which is his church now god the creator in man which is his church now what is this being expressed to this bride eternal love amen it's what's being expressed eternal love jesus said i am he that liveth in revelations chapter one don't be afraid john i'm the first and the last i'm he that liveth and was dead and behold i'm alive forevermore what is there to fear the judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave when he descended was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus see for a surety our attorney is our judge for a surety a surety is a person who agrees to take responsibility for a person accused of a crime this is a person a surety is a person who assumes or obligation assumes obligation and legal responsibility for the fulfillment of others of another's debt or obligation that's our surety and brother braham said for a surety our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge amen and look at the key of david the key of david was the bride married to the groom takes his name obligated gives the the the vows does all that and then they're they're they're spoken as being one and she takes her veil and puts it upon his shoulder and gives him absolute right and responsibility over her and no one else and not another person has any responsibility or any right over that bride and brother brown said see that's the key of david amen and he what does he do he accepts the obligation who's accepted our obligation who's caring for you who's identified himself and being in you who's who's who's the obligation on our attorney is our judge attorney and judge as judge the case is settled it is finished and now therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promise has ever failed to manifest before us why should it fear punishment or death it all it has all been overcome he is the mighty conqueror he is the one who conquered both worlds of the scene and the unseen nothing can conquer christ amen he's the name above every name yes he conquered death hell and the grave and his and has the keys thereof what he's loose is loose looses is loose what he binds is bound there's no changing it he doesn't have another thing a thought concerning you he can't change his thoughts whatever thought he had of himself remains eternally i know my thoughts concerning you position you see what we're saying this
