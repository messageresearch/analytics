power in the name of jesus i've got the power in the name of the lord the saint and rages i shall not be defeated i've got the is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the name of my lord hallelujah can we say amen this morning amen we are not a powerless people amen we we look through this scripture and we see how god has come down in every generation not just here and there my brother and sister but a consistent pattern god coming in every generation and dealing with the hearts of his people amen now what we got to decide today is whose people we are amen because if you recognize today that you're god's people then you need to just stop maybe life is tough maybe circumstances are such but if you just stop and look around you'll find god amen no generation will be able to say i searched for god and could not find him he is here he's present now saints i'm going to put a little disclaimer before we start the service today i'm going to speak some things very narrow vision of things this morning that will be straightforward maybe you might call it blunt it's been something that's been on my heart for quite a while and certainly i don't speak it to offend i speak it because i love you amen amen uh before we go into the service um i'm we're happy uh our daughter sister joe lynn and sister leah are flying home today and you notice we context that as this is home yes and brother david and sister diane i don't know if sister ruth's going with them probably so going to be traveling to oregon this week i think in the latter part to preach for brother rich and in the latter part of this week lord willing sister jerry and i will be going to a wedding so we'll be leaving lord willing i think thursday afternoon evening so anyway just remember those traveling mercies and as we've already had the request let's remember brother sergey is going to have quite a journey back down to take care of more business i think the last one was 25 hours 27 hours or something stuffed in a van with people who want to save money so they don't even run the air conditioner and they've maximized their profits of hauling their cargo and you know that's how they feel about it they're not other humans in that van with them that's cargo and uh so we just want to definitely remember them amen it was something else i was going to say but i don't remember my appreciation circumstances caused me to miss a great portion of the work yesterday of which i'm sad about that but you notice it looks like there's been a war outside of our church and uh the enemy which in this case was all them shrubs that have been there i think since the 70s uh and they thought they were home or now uh at the landfill so anyway uh we just pray and each one and we'll have another work day and try and just finish this up and make the outside of our church look good so amen i want to speak to you this morning on my calling is clearer now and i believe that saints as we come as each day comes and we come in maturity as sons and daughters of god that um our calling who we are in jesus christ should be clear every day and if it's not clear today than it was yesterday and the weeks prior then i encourage you just to find a spot before the lord and get down and ask him for clarity because uh time is being fulfilled you know through the ages the scripture says that the scorner will say you know where is his coming but through the ages my brother and sister if you think about this that through the ages every one of those generations thought that was the coming of the lord amen but by revelation we see all of these scriptures being fulfilled everything put in place and and uh if i could use this little analogy uh my brother and sister when the puzzle is half finished we can say this puzzle will be completed but when the last piece of the puzzle is put in place we have to change our vocabulary from it will be completed to it is completed and that's what god's doing in this generation we're seeing the fulfillment of of scripture we're seeing the fulfillment of the promises of the ages of revelation now when we use the word revelation often times people will say well this man spoke this and this man spoke this and people want to put a time stamp well this man spoke this before this man did so is this man plagiarizing isn't that interesting now you notice the spirit in the world today is such a taboo to plagiarize now i hope you're going to catch this so it's such taboo to plagiarize and people will say oh oh they plagiarized that but when it comes to the word of god god speaks an everlasting promise and so whether it was spoken in uh 16 something or 17 or 18 something or in the 2000s or right now for a son of god to speak the everlasting promises of god is not plagiarizing it's a stirring of the remembrance amen to stir up our minds of these promises and so we live in a day that people are so afraid to really preach the gospel and go into many of the promises of god because they don't want to be viewed as just repeating something that a man spoke many years ago but as god speaks promises now this is kind of kind of strung out through the message so i can't just tell you go to this sermon this sermon but you see brother branham summed it up when he said i have come to put all the missing pieces in place so it's not like he's coming with a whole new gospel he's putting everything in its correct order and uh here again it reminds me of of just a conversation with sister ruth about two-sided puzzles and i had never experienced a two-sided puzzle before so that means that peace can fit in that place but it might not be long there so you have to make sure you have continuity and god is putting in this hour we're living in now continuity in his word showing us how clearly these things fit in place amen let's turn in our bibles this morning to the book of luke and i pray today this will be an encouragement to you uh and uh yeah praise the lord luke 23 starting with verse 34 to verse 45. now we are going to take out of luke's account of the crucifixion and we're going to draw just a little bit uh out of this thought but this will just help us lay a foundation going forward and i felt like that this whole some of these scriptures would be beneficial then jesus then said jesus father forgive them now saints i hope you can catch this jesus was actually declaring right there when he says father forgive them he's saying i forgive them so he brought it right down he didn't put it in a different dimension in a different context he brought it right down personal because you see he was god in flesh and so he is saying you know what they don't know what they're doing but i forgive them anyhow and as i spoke to you the other day and we'll do our best to bring this about today to make a connection you see these things had to happen it didn't need a disrupter to come in there and say whoa stop you can't crucify him he's an innocent man and and used some authority to stop the process this had to happen not just to fulfill prophecy but for you and i they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself and a superscription was also was written over him in the letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is king of the of the jews this is just another mockery one of the male factors which were hanged on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us but the other aren't you glad but the other answering rebuked him saying dost now thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly now i want you to put yourself as the other one on the cross here and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man has done nothing amiss now i want to tie that i don't want to preach you and keep you standing but i want to tie this back to last sunday remember what's between you and i and judgment let's be realistic with ourselves don't say oh we're forgiven we're forgiven it will never hurt you to remember that if you received your just reward amen now this is not to let the devil condemn you and this is not to have a false sense of piety this is for us to be reminded so that we never go back where we came from because the wages of sin is death and so we know that we should have been hanging on our own personal cross but we have one who stood in our place and by his blood we are forgiven amen but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst heavenly father we just ask you to bless this time together lord and father i just pray that you would just give us the words the wisdom father to express lord these things that are upon our hearts and lord just help us today we pray and the saints and those around us and families and neighbors and lord what just to move in their midst lord father that people could truly find the tender mercies find your grace lord find the blood and lord be redeemed father ask you to be with us today guide us in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated you know i think it's always good saints that we start off you know and as i shared with you part of this um to to look into to speak on study in the mercy seat was brought on by the words of an individual that that was expressed to me and they were very adamant in their position and and i was like you know that's not right and something laid upon my heart at that time that i wanted to just bring to the church that we would look through and discuss as it were uh speak on these things of the mercy seat that we would not be misconstrued in our understanding that we would not uh you know have some kind of teaching that come from somewhere at some time that puts god you know out there and this is a problem in the world of christianity uh there there is traditions our spirits will hit on this a little bit lord willing that that puts god out there somewhere and he's out there on the throne he's out there on a mercy seat he's out there my brother and sister that's never been the relationship that god has had with his children god has always been an up close and personal god amen he is not a god of somewhere else in the far reaches of the universe but my brother and sister he's always dwelt in and amongst his people amen and so you know to have someone kind of put it that god has got to if he's here he can't be there and if he's there he can't be here and they totally misconstrue or misunderstand the word of god and you know sometimes these are just simply teachings that come out of other things and never been let go of and so they come to the message they come to the word of the hour and they're still holding on to a teaching that come from some other age or some other time under some other uh dispensation or revelation and so we just want to look through the things of god and god stir our heart is my prayer that we would have a complete full and true understanding of the word of god now as we look my brother and sister in this and i'm going to refer to this as the story we look into the story and we see how that in this moment of time uh we see our lord jesus christ coming and he is fulfilling the very word or rarity prophecies of the prophet isaiah and jeremiah and on through the scriptures zechariah all of these prophecies have come been laid into scripture and laid there and now because god is god they will be fulfilled and so we see now our lord jesus christ is is here in this time in this place and there is a mockery of if this is god or is there a god and if he is god why doesn't he save himself and my brother and sister we have to recognize and i believe as as christians as believers we recognize that my brother and sister if he had saved himself we would be lost amen and his goal was never to save himself his goal was as it is placed in scripture a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so his goal was always to save us his goal was always to redeem us and my brother and sister that is where the opening of the seventh seal comes down because it is the book of redemption and redemption must be manifested if redemption then stays on the page and will make reference in the service today but if the words of the testator stay unfulfilled then nothing is distributed not that's not right how do i say that distributed it's not distributed but you see when the words of the testator are brought to pass and the word is then spread amongst god's people now you say brother paul um before jesus christ there was the law but my brother and sister the law was an old covenant and it was to bring to a place where people could then take a natural transition i hope you understand what i'm saying a natural transition into the fullness of the plan of god so the lamb being slain was never god's plan as it were and him himself going to calvary was not the substitute for a previous plan that didn't work so god bringing his word to come down because the day that we're living in was no longer to be a day that we brought a lamb once a year for our sins but the lamb has now been slain and we are here each day every day in fact let's break it down a little bit more it's not just every 24 hours amen this is not every hour this is not every uh you know half hour this is every moment of our life the blood is applied amen that we have a a a offering a sin offering an atonement for us and i thank god you know he's not a god that just responds uh you know uh you know you you you can call you can leave a message you can ask someone to return a call and uh you know when you call back a week later and the secretary says oh it usually takes him um a week or two to respond i'm just speaking in a natural sense you actually go out and find someone else to do business with because what i needed i needed last week i don't need it next week and so we're looking we serve a god who's not looking to put you on pause you say but brother paul i've been praying about this and i don't seem to have an answer it's in god's time it's in god's time and it will arrive right on time amen it will be for the molding of our character because here again i know church i know that you listen to your pastor and and you're all praying for patience so patience means that there's a waiting period a calm a time not necessarily of inaction so as we look at this today i hope i can articulate this i struggled a little bit this morning uh brother david expressed this here recently uh you know i didn't know which one of these three or four avenues to go on amen and i try not to bring all three or four of them to you today all that jesus said would come to pass my brother and sister is now has now happened it's there that as he is speaking to the disciples he's speaking to the people he's laying a little word here laying a little word here telling them of what is going to come to pass and so it's there that they don't really fully comprehend what is coming they they have ideas they kind of have different differences uh in the meantime there's a drama behind the story uh you know who's gonna be at your right hand who gets to sit closest to you who's more important who is this who is that and so what it is is it actually shows you saints that they're missing what jesus is really telling them and they're looking at the drama of the story amen they're looking at how they feel or trying to figure out now was this about me you know and what and they're missing the fact that he's telling them what is going to happen in the coming days to the son of man amen and so it's there that they are looking now and seeing themselves and you'll find and we won't go into this in depth today but you'll find that out is actually after the passing of our lord jesus that the clarity starts to come they they were still trying to figure out and and you just read about this and and i just my heart just you know as i'm studying this my heart is breaking because here is peter believing he has great revelation great foundation in the gospel and yet as jesus rebukes him i don't believe it's still soaked in until very sits in the midst of the group or congregation as it were and a young lady says are you not one of them i believe you are one of them and he denies and i want you to talk about the depth of disparity must have been in his soul because the scripture says that he cursed this is a believer how could this happen he's a believer and just as it was spoken to him when he comes to that point he hears the crow can you imagine how crushed he must have felt i knew that he was the jesus he was the christ i knew that how do i end up here i'll tell you what i met many a man and woman my brother and sister in the travels the lord's allowed me to be on that was right there in that position and because the devil comes and blots the memory from these things they are sitting there believing it's all over they have just went over the line maybe i've blasphemed or i've just nope i don't got it but to have a reminder come to them and stir their heart and realize sometimes god's got to bring you to the black and white and then there's no place to turn it's the reality you're looking at yourself as it were in the negative of the word and so then the reality is there and you know my brother and sister it's not really about the test you know that any of you had any trials this week amen oh maybe it'd be easier any of you who haven't listened to your hand but you know it's not about the trial it's about how you respond to the trial i'm not in church today because oh i was such a terrible person no that's where we really should be the worst the trial and maybe let me just put in this context the worst your failure should be what motivates you to be in the house of god not the opposite see satan's got it like oh i was just such a terrible person now let me put it in this context of peter i curse this week [Music] i better just stay home and feel sorry for myself and wallow in my self-pity no you shouldn't no you shouldn't you should be right to the house of god you should be right in the presence of god because you see what's in you is the reason satan is fighting you if you were empty he wouldn't even bother you in fact you would just receive an email talking about your great promotion and the realtor would call and tell you that house you uh made an offer on the owner decided to sell it to you for just half as much money and then the phone call would be real when they said you've won a car you know sister jerry and i have won a ford explorer like 32 times in the last two weeks anybody else win a ford explorer this last few weeks yeah i'll tell you what i'm going to have so many florida ford explorers that church you know just don't be surprised when one shows up in your driveway because i've put my name in at a restaurant or someplace like that and and um i've won and i'm like man i tell you what i am getting old i haven't put my name into a drawing in 25 years and the last thing i won was actually because sister jerry wrote my name and dropped it in there and i said oh now don't take this anything more than just humor it was jerry's car that won it not my own but you see my brother and sister satan what does he want to do he wants to suppress you in any fashion he can he wants you to come to the place that you're like oh woe unto me and surely god wouldn't deal with me i couldn't come to the house of god today and god speak to me or i couldn't be a contributor today [Laughter] we just had a little uh conversation this morning in the restroom amen and um you know it it's just unique how satan is just so desperate that he can just cause all this stuff to try to hinder us but we're sons and daughters of god and you know what when we see that satan is trying to bring this to hinder us we we don't look at that we look beyond to the promise and we just say you know what i did this and this happened that happened but no problem i'm moving beyond that because that's not who i am and knowing that the circumstance that that is you see satan would rather now i know it's not you and it's not families like yours but satan would just love to cause almost every family if he could to have some kind of disagreement on the way to church isn't that amazing how that works now some of you are nodding your head so i don't know if you just agree with the theory or it's reality but jesus said these things would come to pass and it's now happening and remember from this last week that the words of the testator are of none effect until the death of the testator so we see now in the crucifixion we see that the words of the testator which is our lord jesus christ can now come into effect and they are amen so the word coming forth to show us that it will no longer be written on tablets of stone but he will ride it on the hearts of his sons and daughters of god and my brother and sister there is a lot of words that have been written there's a lot of things we can look at but we find the greatest value of words is when they have gone into effect in other words we can have this bible and we can place it in a prominent position in our life whether it be on the mantle of our home on the table a bedside a table whatever it might be but if the words of this book don't come alive and take effect in us then you will just be dusting it you will just be coming back to it over and over again dusting it but my brother and sister when the words of this book so many words and lots of words in this book and when they start to take effect in our life it is a slow gradual metamorphosis as it were that we are changing and changing and changing because it is taking effect upon us and so when things have come into effect my brother and sister that's when it starts to really change our life and what happened as we look at peter just briefly for a moment peter is right there peter needed to deny christ the third time peter needed to be accosted by a young woman who said aren't you one of them i'm sure you are peter needed to curse what you're saying a believer needed to curse yes a believer needed to curse because he had to come to the moment of face to face reality with the negative of peter the man and when he come face to face with that the scripture says he went off kid himself and wept bitterly you see that had never been an effect that took place in peter's life before but now there he is face to face he finds a place alone he's crying out to god and he's weeping bitterly and there was the catalyst that brought change in his life the prophet of god talked to us over and over again about cold formal religion dry eyed confessions were we just like oh lord i'm sorry my brother and sister that won't do it we've got to come to a place face to face with our negative to realize oh god something's got to change something's got to and oh lord let it be in me today don't let this day pass lord but what i can find a place and go and find in myself something crying out in such a fashion that we can say i found my place and i wept bitterly but unfortunately we find that we have become so sophisticated and refined and and we have so much as it were external knowledge that that we just believe by knowing what we know and attending where we attend and and hearing these things that we have it i tell you my brother and sister we have it when we have broke through the veil of human flesh when we have broke through the veil of human reasoning human affections all of these things when we break through that veil then those things can take place in our life and truly will be a changed person i say this morning young and old lord let the word have it's a full effect upon us today let us not walk out of church saying well uh you know he had me up to this point and i agreed until he got to this point of contention and i liked it until he went over this time my brother and sister we are so dominated by the human elements you know as we look back through the scripture we see that everyone had to have a lamb they come to offer their offering they couldn't come with an iou they couldn't come with a paper substitute they couldn't come with a word that says my priest says he's got it covered they had to have their lamb and so we see the lamb come see no one recognized it in that day the great scholars that had been brought and the word passed from age to age from father to son coming through in the levites it come and my brother and sister what happened in every passing as it were of the word it became more tradition there was certain word that they did not bother to fulfill there was certain word that they did not focus on but yet there were certain words that they focus so laser on them and as from generation to generation so much of the word escape them we've been somewhere depending on where you want to start from six seven eight generations are you with me there's some things we have such a laser focus on and there's some things we've allowed to be set to the wayside god help us this wasn't a book that god gave us to pick and choose through either that he is his own editor would have said in laodicea they won't need this and they won't need this and they won't even be listening to this no he left the book intact and then he spoke the word and said if you believe on me you'll believe on my word knowing that he himself was the word so you would believe on all of me amen not one portion of him but all of him you see we look now and realize that the crucifixion of our lord jesus christ as the scripture says now there in exodus as we're speaking upon the mercy seat and we cannot speak of the particulars at this time we cannot go into the details of the mercy seat at this time because you see the mercy seat there to them was as it were a physical object it was something that they knew that the presence of god was associated with the cherubims and it was above the ark and that was all well and good but i hope you don't misunderstand me today that almost come down to a point of idol worship it was all just formality now formality is not all that bad right because we don't come at 11 45 to church assuming we're going to participate in the service because the formality of our services it starts at 10 30. okay so we oftentimes get into well whoa we don't want any formality you know this is where people misunderstand they say well you know the prophet said he's against organized religion and so we don't go to a church because they start at this time and they do this and they do this and that's organized well hello yes sir do i go there is that rude i would say that it's disorganized religion when you're sitting here in your bunny slippers eating ice cream for breakfast listening to a tape and saying you're having church you're telling god i know you're just an informal god you're a god who don't care how i worship well let's go over here and let's listen now to god's chosen place of worship can't have it both ways saints so the blood of our lamb had to be upon the mercy we see the formality as it were my brother and sister placed out in exodus that the blood had to be sprinkled now once again the blood has had to be sprinkled but did you know that we can look back to calvary and say well his blood was sprinkled his blood was shed it was there you know it come down and and it was for us now brother brown says god jesus christ blood was not spilt because that denotes almost as though it was an accident knocked over but my brother and sister however you want to get formal about those words that blood was shed for you and i but did you know my brother and sister and you can study this all through the scriptures that we're coming down in another dispensation of the word and it's not us looking back to calvary and saying his blood was shed at calvary but it is the believer here today applying the blood himself because you can go to church all the days of your life and not have the blood shed over you not have the blood of jesus christ sprinkled over your life amen so it's something that we ourselves have to become a participant in we don't know well i go to church when we're believers we're this my parents i don't care you've got to shed take that shed blood of jesus christ and you've got to put it over yourself sorry for stumbling around this morning my mind is just racing off and i need to rein it in amen so i say this morning lord i don't care what age we are let the word have its full effect so everyone had to have their lamb and and the blood of the lamb must be upon the mercy seat and and we look at this my brother and sister and realize that as the blood is readily available is it not we're not looking at something that's in limited supply covet did not shortchange its delivery hallelujah now and christ is god's provided lamb amen amen notice how appropriate was now showing that that jerusalem was ceasing in other words the significance of jerusalem to the believer was declining why because we're moving into a different dispensation we're moving into a different atonement as it were a different deal but the same one let me clarify the same one just different right when it was in effect until that hour the blood of the lamb was all right until that day so right to the day of the crucifixion the blood of the lamb natural being shed in the temple was sufficient but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done there was a new one and the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds it was presents what he's saying it was right there they were condemning and doing the very thing there they had to do my goodness saints we understand how this works people are going to do what they're going to do now i might say some things are a little dirt this morning but i just want you to know i love you amen i don't know if each one of you would really understand just how much i love you and i would hope that you wouldn't think that it's just like oh brother paul is fond of me and my family and so therefore he likes us and all as well i'm talking about as a son of god i look out and i see people that are striving people that are pressing to the mark of the high calling i see people that through thick and thin just keep trying and my heart is bound to your heart because that's my same story but you see people are gonna do what they're gonna do i've had a hard lesson learning that saints i have emotionally almost killed myself because i tried to convince people the direction they were going was not right can't you see this can't you see this can't you see this please look here only to have them even more bitterly reject what you bring now i don't want to become cynical man nobody wants a pastor that's cynical but i'll tell you i am coming to the point that i will give you what i feel god's laid upon my heart you do what you choose with it you'll either throw it in the dumpster or you'll eat it and that will be on your head not mine on your hands not mine amen because we're coming down to a season of the manifestation of what is really there our young people the other night i i really hope that they they they catch that i do believe they did you see i took them sorghum which was some bird seed that we had at the house i took sorghum i took a corn seed and i took a goat head now we all know what a goat head is right even our little ones are like yep i've stepped on them and that hurts and we got to talk about can we plant a goat head and come up with corn see i want to bring it down even saints to our youngest that they understand whatever seed they plant in their life whatever they allow to grow in their life is what's going to be produced in their life you cannot say well i go to church and call that the seed my brother and sister because the seed of discrepancy survives in the church so as we plant the right seed we get the right results the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very thing there that they had to do that's right god be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in the last days look the prophet's telling you you're blessed god's allowed you to see these things here see the day we're living in you can see that and when you see that my brother and sister you can do something about it but if god never opened your eyes and you literally had to go ahead and thought you had something of value and you just kept on planting goat heads must have been god's fault our family fell apart well quit planting go-heads got pain in your family you've got pain in your own life quit planting goat heads because the church isn't doing the same thing today until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing christ's word now look i want you to catch this i think this this is very striking you need to really focus on this god be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same thing today amen so he's declaring this day same thing's taking place again and to the hour that organization religion or organized religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing christ's word so we got a timeline locked right here that there is a time that it's going to be proven that they're actually sacrificing god's word for another program now i'm going to ask you just out out front is that not it's absolutely proven amen because it's interesting now i don't recommend you all go do this but it's interesting go do a little research and you'll find that this group here is condemning them for what they do and that group is condemning them for what they do and that group is condemning them for what they do and that group way down there is now condemning this one for what they do but what we see is the word of god said they're all in the same thing every one of them has compromised on the word of god and so for their form of the gospel they are now compromising or selling out the gospel to succeed at what they're doing i've joked about this and i haven't said anything about it for a long time but remember i received that deal inviting me to purchase a how to grow your church program for just like 695 bucks a month you know they have you know eight ten of those lessons that guarantee that you can increase the the amount of people in your church miniful wow you know i wonder sometimes if i shouldn't have went ahead and subscribed to that but i realized it was self-defeating because over here is the word saying you know what i'm going to thin them out so they'll pay money to get more of the same spirit of what they got so you have a lot of people that are all compromised on the word of god and my brother and sister you don't need a lot of people that are compromised because i tell you i'd rather have one or two true believers than a whole building full of compromisers so they're doing the same thing until the our organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing god's word from then on comes the word do you catch that and the word only amen so we got a season saints can i explain this for you i know you're all intelligent i don't i'm not speaking down to you but do you realize there is a time that all of this looked good all of this looked good and then there's a time that it was proven what they were doing and it was proved that they were actually sacrificing the word to fill the church up to have the money to build a bigger church to fill the church up to have the money to build a bigger church and they sacrificed the gospel to accomplish this goal hallelujah i hope this isn't too personal but sister jerry shared with me what was shared with her about a church there in kiev and how that it was just filled and they're actually sitting on the steps outside of the church and the pastor there was like to another brother what do we do you know we can't really afford another building we need another building and the pastor that give advice to a pastor a pastor giving advice to a pastor he says just wait strangely enough in the last while these went here these disagreed these quit serving god these did this now there's plenty of room in the church but there's something in the human element that says we want to fill this place up what we want is real gold what we want is real christians real believers that's what we're searching so after the time the awakening of the sacrificing of god's word then we see from then on comes the word and the word only what is it out of all of this there's a people that the word rings true to them and they're like i only want the word only want the word have you ever been to a restaurant and the minute you dug into your potatoes you're like wow they made these from real potatoes i mean you're eating them and you're like somebody has peeled a potato and boiled this thing and mashed him and served it to me and then you go to another restaurant and you're like wow i didn't know that potatoes tasted like tin cans now i want to ask you within your ability do you go get the tin can potatoes or do you go back and get the real my daddy used to teach me started farming started in business my daddy used to tell me son it only cost a dollar to go first class one more dollar just one extra dollar to go first class hallelujah well since we can settle for 10 canned potatoes or we can sacrifice just a little more and have the real thing we can settle for religion or for a little more we can have christ himself come on from the old paschal lamb passed away and christ became our lamb at the day of the crucifixion right there see the transition takes place right there and the day that the denomination crucified the word of god and accepted a creed in the stead of the word that's the day the word come into full effect and that's just been recently 1963 that's just been recently so we're not looking back my brother and sisters sadducees and pharisees we're looking well you know it always amazes me i just like somebody the other day oh when was you born and i just like hear people saying oh 2001 you're a child i mean i'd want to go back to you know the 40s or whatever but you just realize see what's happening is time is moving forward and i was a child of the 60s and so to me the 60s are not that far back and i talked to a young man one day and he said well sir if i could ask when was you born and i told him 1961 and he goes oh my grandpa talks about those days now look i say that i bring that to you maybe a little humor there but let's not look at the word that way oh my that was way back there we're of a more modern time no sir this word is enduring it's time tested it's just as powerful today as the day it was spoken amen it will fulfill everything that it declared in that day will be fulfilled in this day and we'll look right here you see when they compromise brother and sister that's when the bride of christ starts really hungering to get into the word so as they decline let me put it this way as they decline in their sincerity and when i'm not talking about enthusiasm because the prophet of god said they'll be really enthusiastic but i'm talking about in the sincerity from the depths of the heart as the worlds declined they went into program we have to have uh baseball teams basketball teams we have to have this program and that program and we're you know and we've got all kinds of programs and you'll see it on their banners and on their boards we have a new program for this a new program for that how about the program of preaching the gospel how about the program of eternal life how about the program of people hearing the word and being able to say amen that's the truth so as you see that coming to that day see that's the day that the word's going to come into full effect to the bride of jesus christ sons and daughters of god will be able to take the word in that day and be able to say praise the lord this word is effective you know speaking of the word i hope this isn't offensive to anybody but this covet vaccine is so effective they're talking about how you might need to take a third dose and if that don't work they might have to give you a fourth dose hallelujah how about just getting one dose and it being real how about we just get one dose of the holy ghost and it be real we don't have to have all kinds of this and all kinds of that i believe in special meetings and we've been kind of likes about those things for various reasons but my brother and sister if we have a revival experience then you'll continue to have to attend revival after revival after revival to keep the experience alive but what when you get the real experience you'll be able to go to the backside of the desert and come out of the backside of the desert just as filled with the holy ghost as when you went into the desert in fact you might come out with more because you will have got all the distraction of life done and god will be right there in your midst amen not this all you know i i had a reason i i couldn't be in church and and i backslid because i was in church something missing something missing something's wrong because it's not going to be that kind of experience do i believe you should be in the house of god yes i do because my bible says so hallelujah now you look at this and you know isn't that interesting it's in the message indictment what was they indicted for second that's see not even put out an indictment for the first crucifixion that had to take place but the second crucifixion would not have had to take place if they believed the word but they compromised the word and ultimately tradition we're a message church i like that oh brother chris i'm not picking on you please please believe me but i liked that we sing three songs and we have these unspoken requests and we have this thing here and we do it like this because we are a message church well how about we become a holy ghost-led church and if we happen to sing three songs and we happen to do this and we have to do that then so be it but let god be the guiding hand that we don't have to go look now this might go over wrong and people might hear this on the internet and i might get rebuffed for this but my brother and sister if we have to go look in church order to pattern a church service because we've got to know exactly what to do here and what to do here my brother and sister i think something's wrong where's the holy ghost now i'm not saying what the prophet of god said was out of line ignore it i'm talking about the fact that the holy ghost that led him to say those things should be the holy ghost that's leading us just naturally organically do we understand that organically just coming from within us to have a leadership that if we have one more now you guys are going to think i just whatever but i'm getting older and bolder and you can always you know retire me trade me and retread me but we were joking brother david the other night good humor honest humor fair not critical but the problem with a preacher leading songs why because he was created by god to find inspiration in all of these things that's what god made him for and so when he reads his song or something comes he's like okay now just a second we got a pause between songs here i've got to share this come on i hope you all find humor but david kind of smiled at me i hope he finds humor in this you see you can't help that why he's not trying to take your extra time or to take this hijack this service there's anointing and i just saw this and i've got to share this while it's fresh or we can go publish it in a little deal and send it out to all the preachers and and next month go ahead and preach on this no sir we are holy ghost-led people forgive me brother david for bringing that up i'm trying to break that habit but that's the thing see why under inspiration you want to share this thing that just blossomed before you amen so i'm not criticizing that at all i've done it way too many times myself now look at this see as we'll look in this my brother and sister as we'll look the lamb going back in the quote the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very thing that they had to do that's right why because the words of the testator had to come forth they had to kill the testator for the testimony of what was contained in the inheritance could be revealed to you and i otherwise it would remain locked up in the word amen it would be locked up in there and be a mystery to us but the scripture says in that day when the mystery of god would be fulfilled it is there that the words of the testator are unlocking our inheritance every single day another opening of the inheritance is coming to the bride of jesus christ she is seeing more clear who she is in jesus christ every single day and if they hadn't done what they were called to do then we would be today still locked up in that do you understand what i'm saying now i want to go back to 111 uh uh here uh see i kind of don't know that we really caught the revelation of this god be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this last day we don't even we don't even grasp or have a a conscious understanding of how blessed we are and you say oh brother paul no i think we do i'm telling you i don't think you do i think if we really realized how blessed we are just simply to see the revealed or open word in the day that we're living you would find us as it were not necessarily physically but in the spiritual realm hopping and skipping down the street and we would see a situation and we just claim in the name of jesus christ we wouldn't give it a second thought i need healing lord they need healing we wouldn't even never thought you know sometimes i think that we just get and we labor and we labor and we're like i'm being faithful i'm praying for this need and the reason it comes that way is because we haven't really grasped that god heard you the first time amen now i believe on remembering things in prayer yes i do the word of god shows us to pray for life it doesn't say now you just enter your petition once but i'm talking about in the real context down in our heart right we're lacking that complete supreme confidence that as a son of god i claimed healing it's going to happen it's going to happen i don't have to fret i don't have to fuss but we prayed for so and so when they passed away god's perfect will be done amen but see we we kind of miss a little something in there i believe god help us and i don't say that offensive but we're living in an hour saints when the word of god is being sacrificed they're sacrificing christ's word now i'm going to bring this down in such a fashion i hope you can follow me here it's shocking to have someone say to you now i want you to understand brother paul the reason that we operate our church and preach like we do is because we are reaching out to the foolish virgin and we are doing our best to keep the foolish virgin in church this is not theoretical this is a real live conversation i had explaining why that they do not try to hold to some standards because the foolish virgin as we're sitting there having this conversation the man literally pointed to a young woman walking by and i'll get to how she was dressed in a few minutes but he points to a young woman walking by and says it's people like her we're trying to keep in church let's take a little poll how many think brother paul's a legalist have courage if you feel it lift your hand i don't believe i'm a legalist because the scripture says he has received mercy gives mercy amen i've received a lot of mercy in my life but you see if we start preaching the word of god the message of the hour into a fashion just to keep you coming back to church that's it can you honestly say i love you because all i care about is you coming to church you see it puts it in a place that the devil anoints this and i made this statement to you saints sometime back here it was very interesting because my wife was listening to another brother in the message and he spoke almost the exact words i believe it was on the same weekend would have been the same sunday far across the country i believe to me a little confirmation it wasn't man's thinking it's god's thinking but you see we're living in an hour people are sacrificing christ's word and so to hear a man say this is why we do what we do is because we're reaching out to the foolish virgin to keep them in church well let me tell you a little something just to inform you so you'll know where i stand today the reason we operate this church and preach as we do because we are reaching out to the bride of jesus christ i'm not trying to keep foolish virgin in church i pray if there's some in church that god deals with their hearts and changes them but my brother and sister we are reaching out my heart is not to convince someone who doesn't really want to serve god that it's in their best interest because they've already made a decision that they want to do what they want to do but i tell you i want to reach to the bride of christ amen i tell you what i want you to know the ones who can't i want to preach to the ones they're the ones that just can't wait to get in the house of god i'm going to preach to the ones that just can't wait to say amen to the word to the ones that say you know what i don't care what it cost me i'm going to live this those are the ones i want to preach to i want to preach to people that down in their heart when god starts to stir them they'll say i've heard the truth i know this is the truth hallelujah they'll say amen to the word and then do according to the word you see the bride's not expecting the word to be watered down to save their feelings god's on a mercy seat i'll just live any way i want and then i'll plead mercy no i'll tell you the word of god shows us how we live is just close to the word as we can live and when we make a mistake grace is not to keep us from disgrace grace is a safety net that catches you and i when we have done our best and we still fail that people say i can live anywhere please there's grace there's mercy my brother and sister that's foolish virgin thinking am i preaching too strong this morning amen the bride wants to hear the word like god had his prophet saying now i want you to buckle your seatbelts because this is something that's been in my heart for a long time i hope this does not offend anyone here but i can no longer just hold on to this and let it eat away up my heart i must speak on it amen young sisters old sisters you'll not find one place where the prophet condoned high heels that's exactly right i will say this strongly this morning i love every one of you i've seen him walk in this door i've seen him walk out this door i have seen him and it breaks my heart but you will not find one place in fact he speaks quite strongly and there's a dream involved interpretation of a dream my brother and sister this is not something that should come in the house of god we say we believe a message and then we'll do that well let's go ahead and just add a television or let's just go to the movies and let's just do this and do that you see if we're either going to believe the message preach the message leave the message or we are compromising the message now if that was too strong for our young people i want to ask you mothers why do you allow it to happen amen i'm not here to shame you i'm not shaming no one i love you enough i don't want to see you in satan's trap i don't want to see you just moving forward that's no big deal it's no big deal it's no big deal i'm not a legalist no sir not here to shame you i love you but i tell you what it's not love if i sit back and just let you go we're not lemmings we all know what livings are don't we them cute little furry things up there north slope of alaska little grass eating critters and one of them jumps off the cliff and the next one says what could it hurt and two jump off and three and five and ten a hundred but you know they live to recreate so there's some of them that either were too slow and got lost and said where'd everybody go or some of them have sense enough not to jump off the cliff right come on saints just because other message churches are going there we don't have to go there [Music] young people young sisters that's right i'm going to look at my screen so i don't look directly at you so you won't think i'm picking on you yes you you but it's not love if you ignore it that's exactly right love is when we say look saints we're drifting this is coming into our church this is we're drifting in the wrong direction that's love because young young sisters young men too amen amen we can we can get now this might seem specific and i believe people will understand but we can turn into these shaggy looking dogs and we can come to church with pants with uh you know isn't this so cool if we had just gone on the leading edge of this thing through the years i could have provided hundreds of pairs of wore out jeans with holes in the knees and holes in the back pockets and now i could have got rich on this just my own instead they go down to the store and they gave 120 550 dollars what a bargain look saints let's let's go back young people i encourage you mothers families fathers i encourage you look at what we believe and just conform as it were i'm not talking about conforming like we're we're lemmings we're just going to conform but conform to the word of god because i tell you what i can't do i can't preach to this church like you're foolish virgin i can't preach to you like like hey you know god's going to just forgive us all because we had the message i can't do that you see i don't even want you in church you know that isn't that amazing i don't even want you in church i want you in christ [Music] just getting in church won't solve the problem need to get you into christ and when we can put away all of our little things i'm guilty saints come on most of us i think i could say all of us are guilty of some form of distraction and then we can get through all of this stuff that satan's like oh i see this one they like books and man you'll be inundated with books and you have this and we have books online and we have free books at the library you know in that amazing library your whole life you've had to check them out now you walk in the library and they're like giving you a box take these why satan's anointed to distract you now i am going to be kind enough not to go into the whole dream and and uh vision and whatever of of the woman mincing in her high heels and falling off into the pits of hell but if we care enough and i'm going to put it this way here again remember brother paul loves you i love you enough to bring this to your attention amen you care enough to go read it it's there see it's satan's subtle anybody still love brother paul okay good good can i continue yes sir mighty gone unveiled before us now when jesus come he if he'd come with noah's message it wouldn't have worked build an ark and floated out it wouldn't have worked but what noah was a portion of god he acted a peculiar way because he was peculiar and his message was peculiar because it was the word being made manifest he could not have come with moses's message because it wouldn't have worked moses was god in a portion made manifest he was a word expressed for that hour but jesus could not have come in that the bible never said he would come in that way but when he come expressed exactly like the testament had said he would be expressed than all those who were redeemable amen amen all those that were redeemable believed it because they were the thoughts of god the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to god amen now look at this what is the title tells you a lot right here amen mighty god unveiled before us saints and that's the promise of our bibles in this day right there is that god once again would be unveiled before us as a people that we could see jesus christ clearly not through a glass darkly not not through some image of man's creation but to see it clearly as many as received him to them he gave the power to become sons of god because they were redeemable they were from the beginning in the expression if we could stop here a moment if it would be possible and think of that tonight of the message of the hour the express thoughts of jehovah before the foundation of the world we are told our names were put on the lamb's book of life do we amen amen we know that is a fact right that's scripture there we can see the two sides as i first said why one is odd to the other amen there you are is it because i'm odd you're odd no sir it's the two sides of looking at the gospel or if you could let me put it in these words at odds with one another i'll just share another thing that's been spoke to my face that caught me so off guard that i was shocked to hear you guys in your church are so arrogant you think you're so special yes i do yes i do yes i do i've been given the power to become sons and daughters of god god come down and said you're after my own thoughts you're after my own heart here is the power to walk in laodicea and live an overcoming life you don't have to have a compromised church to make you feel good you will strive to live and pursue the mark of the high calling hallelujah not being given the lemonade or do we want lemonade it actually does sound good right now no sir i don't want my gospel watered down because i tell you but if any of you feel like i've been a little hard this morning i want to tell you through the years people like that brother david dean heart have been so hard on me that i have felt crushed until the awakening and then i said thank you lord someone someone needed to help me get set straight i remember many years ago stopping i don't know i'm always confused brother david the church was in show low pine top so i remember stopping through in the church down in arizona in the semi happy to be there i go to church i go in my i was even brave enough to get up like even the second row and man i tell you what by the time the service is over i wished i'd sit on the back row because every trial i had been going through got preached on and i thought that's just not fair he's picking on me and then a voice says well how did he know yeah right that's right but there's technology our technology is called the holy ghost that's a technology that sits in your kitchen your living room maybe even your bedroom or your automobile that's the technology that god uses in this hour and he comes down and says you know what i need to confirm that in their heart or i need to correct them they're headed the wrong direction i need i'll just let this man look foolish but he'll speak it and the bride not a foolish virgin foolish virgin's going to be like the preacher's picking on me again and we gave thirty five hundred dollars in ties last month i just don't think he should be able to do that so then over coffee you know you're just really making my family feel bad and then oh well i don't want to do that well i don't want to make you feel bad either but the holy ghost will speak to you if you will listen if you will listen the holy ghost will speak to you okay i better hurry along here this is you know i'm gonna have to make this two parts and brother chris will preach to you next sunday so it might be a little while we'll get to it we can see two sides as i first said why one is odd to the other it must be that way it was always always been that way it will always be that way he was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now god in back in the days of the old testament we find that after he had appeared to his people in different forms he veiled himself behind you oh i miss i misread that behind old badgers oh wait the badger skin i'll get this right i'll get this right i didn't call you a bunch of old badgers he veiled himself behind old badger skins god hiding behind badger skins what does it say right there in that last line at his mercy seat hallelujah so he's not dwelling behind a badger skin out here in a far off galaxy my brother and sister he's dwelling right here at his mercy seat and i'll tell you there ain't no one of us should be able to honestly say i haven't acted like a badger hallelujah oh my we find that how that solomon when he dedicated the temple of the lord and these badger skins was hanging there the veil how that he came in as the pillar of fire and as a cloud and went down behind there and veiled himself to the outside world do you see it you see it he's behind the badger skin still veiling himself to the outside world but by faith israel knew that he was back there they knew he was there regardless of what any of the heathen worlds had to say i say amen to that because the world says we're not even sure there is a god we've tried so hard to prove that there's a god and we can't even prove there's a god what about this and what about this circumstantial reactions to exterior inputs or impulses well hallelujah i'm moved by exterior impulses hallelujah christ in me on me around me moving me hallelujah oh the prophet said science would prove god was real there was regards what any of the heathen worlds had to say he was hid from the unbeliever but the believer by faith knew he was back there they had mercy oh i want mercy god have mercy on me and he was at his mercy seat which was a great secret and i'm telling you it obviously still is it's still a great secret today you know in the old testament to enter behind that skin was death now to stay from behind it is death so then to enter into his glory was death now to stay away from his glory is death that happened of course at the renting of the veil at calvary that's why i use the scripture that i used to open the service right there it was all about in a symbol form the renting of the veil was to now come down from a physical outer element to an internal spiritual element that the veil that separates you as a man or a woman from the presence of god has been broken it's not external it's right here and sometimes it's when god comes down and breaks the veil of our self-will of our desires of our stubborn spirits when he breaks the will of our humanness and it is rent that we can come into the presence of god but as long as we hold on to temper and self and opinion and emotion and all of these things your veil will stay in place oh god rend our veil today oh god we're in the veil of my heart today lord that you can have free access into my soul and that i can have free access into your presence hallelujah hallelujah when the veil was rent the old bill veiled now to stay out of his presence as death then to enter his presence with death amen look at this now keep going here real quick see it changes back and forth you must find the scripture to see what day we're living in now when the veil was rented at calvary the mercy seat came into plain view amen okay now it might not be anybody that's had influence over you and it might not be any realm you operate in but there's people right around us that will tell you that god's either on the mercy seat or he's here with us but he can't be both now i want to ask you this is kind of blunt and probably in the future i'm just going to be preaching blunt to you okay and i don't want you to and i don't expect you to but if you ever need to trade me on somebody else that preaches a little nicer to you that's fine too because i want to see you in rapture i don't want to see you in church i want to see you in the presence of god but i'm telling you my brother and sister when you have people that can't take and claim they believe this and they can't take this and realize that the word has been made in plain view to the believer they are doing something to hold you out of the presence of god whether intentional or unintentional they are creating an atmosphere to keep you from entering in because maybe just maybe they're actually themselves afraid to come into the presence of god and the scripture says they themselves will not go through the door but won't allow you to either don't let it happen saints god's on the mercy seat god's on his mercy seat hallelujah he was hanging a calorie dripping in blood there was the mercy christ himself in you and they had took blood year after year at the cleaning of the sanctuary and sprinkled the mercy seat there god with his great mighty stroke of lightning power split the old badger veil of paul haley from top to bottom and the mercy seat christ in me came in to plain view the real genuine lamb of god was hanging in plain view on calvary the real mercy seat when god had paid the price himself and become one of us and had manifested himself as a man to get acquainted with us and we to be appointed with him oh my problem is some of us have this conversation with him one time every two or three months or whenever communion comes and the conversation usually sounds something like oh lord i'm going to be taking communion forgive me for all the terrible things i did is that communion no no sir that sounds like catholic confession [Music] communion is a day by day conversation with jesus christ i mean i guess it would be quite interesting i'm not mocking what the catholics do don't misunderstand me but it might be quite interesting to sit in a booth and have people tell you about all the terrible things they did maybe a guy could record it and write a book probably be a bestseller well they say truth is stranger than fiction come on saints we've been given the opportunity to have communion with jesus christ every single day of our lives hallelujah amen oh sorry i don't mean to sound flip it lord just check my heart there i honestly don't to get according to us and we appointed with him the mercy seat was in plain view of all israel on that day of atonement amen now look this is a really long quote so i hope you're not i mean really long quote but last the tradition of the church fathers in that day had by their traditions veiled the true mercy seat from the people now remember the bible says these spirits never die so there's a spirit on the earth today that's trying to veil you come on can you fail you block you from seeing the mercy block you from seeing christ in your own life what does he do he gives us music he gives us clothes he gives us friends he gives us this that you just go right down the list what's he doing he's not blessing you he's blocking you right now people are like well the lord blessed me so good my job keeps me out of church i never go to church anymore but hey you know god gave me the job what can i say no sir that's the devil blocking it you know i'm sorry i don't mean to sound flippant this morning saints honestly i don't but my bible says let me just tell you what it doesn't say it doesn't say if you have this and you have that and you have a good job and you have a boat and you have a cabin and you have an airplane and you have a and you have and you have then you don't have to go to church you can forsake the assembly that's what my bible doesn't say what my bible does say is not to forsake the assembly of ourselves together amen but you see satan throws these things out of the world oh my the old testament prophecy would have been fulfilled and it was oh no wrong place if they would have known the scripture each piece would have come like the chinese tag the old testament prophecy would have been fulfilled and it was and if they had been taught the scripture they would have seen the mercy see come on saints this is where both paul's out i hope i hope you guys are good with this i hope that today you you have caught the vein of where i'm at see i'm not here just to hold you and keep you forever and just badger you after all it is my nature because i'm a badger i've got badger skin so therefore i must be a badger and must have the nature of a badger but i'm not here to badger you what is it so that we can see the mercy seat is of the halogen mercy seat is right here for you and i we don't need a certain preacher we don't need a certain church we don't need some certain program the mercy seat is right here and if they've been taught the scripture that's why it's so important that we go back and we anchor everything and to have people here again i'm being blunt and i'm sorry but when you have people say the message is my absolute not talking about the bible i'm talking about 1200 sermons is there absolutely in those 1200 sermons you will not find any word regarding that being the absolute right but in there i can find you multiple multiple places talking about the bible the word of god is our absolute amen come on let's not cut a corner let's not try to create a new vision or a new a new deal you know they wanted to carry the ark on a cart because they didn't have anybody really qualified oh no brother david they didn't the fivefold ministry was shot it was full of all kinds of problems they had caused the levites had caused every problem in israel the levites had actually come into all these israelites houses and set up idols on their mantles and the the the priests you know had come and and caused the people to dress and act and turn into drunks and chase women and whatever else it was the levites did all that and according to some they're still doing that see if they talk been taught the scripture they have seen the mercy seat so that tells me in the day we're living a lot of people aren't being taught the scripture oh my lord help me you know what sister emmy come just come lord says this is good this is good as moses said to do this day their veil is still over their hearts they don't see it but he was god the suffering and the atonement he was a genuine mercy standing in full view as we sang to him lo behold him in plain view there he is the mighty conqueror since he rent the veil into see he come the mercy seat hanging in clear view of the congregation but them being under popular opinion now men and women and delegates of this convention i want to say this without respect of person but in the view of today and view of what we're here for today i'm afraid that the traditions of the fathers church fathers has hid this from too many people and since the holy ghost has come in the last days as prophesied the veil has been rent too many people try to hang to their tradition of the fathers and that's why they can't see this extreme joy peace and things that the church has today yet it's in plain view to those who believe he hid the word the promised word of this day oh my oh my oh my praise the lord well hallelujah i'll just have to share the rest of this another time or maybe the lord just thought it was good i do want to share one last scripture because this scripture to me i made reference to it but i one of these days here i'm going to be going to preach what's on my heart here psalms 124 i think this should be a psalm of praise to us a song the degrees of david if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel say if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us then the waters had overwhelmed us the street stream had gone over our soul then the proud waters had gone over our soul blessed be the lord who hath not given us as prey to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped hallelujah our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth and if it had not been for the lord we would be the prisoners of laodicea but we have escaped from the snare of satan oh hallelujah oh my thanks you're gonna have to pray for me i keep saying lord i just gotta cut this down and be like you know some of these ministers that we have that just really lay it out but oh my well mercy rewrote my life oh hallelujah can we just stand and worship the lord for a minute saints i hope none of you had a pot roast burning amen oh mercy oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh oh god's mercy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my life [Music] oh thank you lord oh god [Music] oh i

this lightly some of you have personalities you you get by you go through life and you do but you see some of us were born with a little more badger anointing [Music] and hardly a day goes by but we have to stop well i'll just can i speak without being offensive or you look down to me there's not a day that paul had's life goes by that paul haylett doesn't have to shove the badger back under the blood a day i hope that doesn't demean maybe a little encourage you but the blood's sufficient never run out of badger i mean blood to cover that badger never have run out of blood to cover that
