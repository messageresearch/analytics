[43:44] one of these days you're coming back to
[43:46] try city's brother
[43:49] okay that's he thinks he's getting away
[43:52] with
[43:52] you know i'm not sure what but
[43:57] praise the lord let's turn to first
[44:00] samuel
[44:03] chapter 16.
[44:12] and we spoken on this i know several
[44:14] different times
[44:16] that the lord every scripture has
[44:18] compound meaning and compound revelation
[44:21] and a lot of times you know you'll get
[44:22] going along a certain path and
[44:24] we're just revealing revealing revealing
[44:26] and then pretty soon you come back and
[44:28] you look at it again and go well wow
[44:31] there's another whole
[44:32] dimension here and you know
[44:36] and you think about it and we're
[44:37] three-part human beings
[44:39] you know i have a fleshly part and you
[44:41] hit it
[44:43] i don't like it or you poke it or
[44:46] whatever and
[44:46] but then there's a spirit part that that
[44:49] you know you get in the presence of the
[44:50] lord you begin to feel the spirit and
[44:53] pain doesn't mean so much and and then
[44:55] but even beyond that there's a soul
[44:58] and even in that soul there's yet realms
[45:00] within that soul that
[45:02] because the soul is the nature of the
[45:04] spirit
[45:06] and there's many things that are uh put
[45:09] forth from the soul
[45:10] into the spirit uh you know some people
[45:13] say
[45:13] well you shouldn't be angry but yet the
[45:15] scripture says be angry and sin not
[45:19] so you go well but yet there's other
[45:21] places where he says well turn the other
[45:23] cheek
[45:24] so but all those things are within the
[45:26] soul of the word that's within us
[45:29] so we'll approach this these scriptures
[45:32] this morning
[45:33] i would like to title it if i could
[45:37] the life behind the life
[45:43] praise the lord brother first samuel
[45:46] chapter 16
[45:47] first verse and the lord said unto
[45:50] samuel how long wilt thou mourn
[45:52] for saul seeing i have rejected him from
[45:54] reigning over israel
[45:56] fill i hold with oil and go and i will
[45:58] send thee to jesse the bethlehem
[46:01] for i have provided me a king among his
[46:04] sons
[46:05] and it will drop down
[46:10] to i think it's verse 11
[46:14] and samuel said unto jesse here are all
[46:17] thy children
[46:18] and he said thou remainest yet the
[46:20] youngest and behold he keeps the sheep
[46:22] and samuel said unto jesse send and fit
[46:24] him
[46:25] for we will not sit down till he come
[46:27] hither
[46:28] and he sent and brought him in and now
[46:30] he was ready and with all of the
[46:31] beautiful countenance and a goodly to
[46:33] look upon
[46:34] and the lord said arise anoint him for
[46:37] this
[46:38] is he then samuel took the horn of oil
[46:41] and anointed him in the midst of his
[46:43] brethren and the spirit of the lord came
[46:44] upon david from that day forward
[46:47] so samuel rose up and went to rhema
[46:51] and then in second chronicles of the
[46:53] 11th chapter
[47:11] and just the third verse there i think
[47:13] it is 11
[47:15] chapters that well first chronicles i'm
[47:17] sorry first chronicles chapter 11.
[47:21] i got as we were just talking i've got
[47:23] notes on top of notes brother willie
[47:27] so first chronicles chapter 11.
[47:36] and just the third verse and it says
[47:38] therefore came all the elders of israel
[47:41] to the king to the king to hebron
[47:45] and david made a covenant with them in
[47:47] hebrew before the lord
[47:49] and the anointed david king over israel
[47:51] according to the word of the lord
[47:53] by samuel amen gracious heavenly father
[47:57] we thank you
[47:58] this morning for your word and for some
[48:01] reason
[48:02] i'd be a little nervous but lord jesus
[48:04] now knowest
[48:06] take this man take these words take this
[48:09] congregation and fill them with your
[48:11] holy spirit
[48:13] and provide unto them the bread of life
[48:16] jesus christ manifest heart to heart
[48:18] from you to them
[48:20] through the words spoken today and above
[48:22] all things may it
[48:23] when it be done and the time as it were
[48:26] be that we should walk away
[48:28] may all be said and done for the lord
[48:30] jesus christ
[48:31] in whose name we come amen praise the
[48:34] lord be seated
[48:38] now we've been through a lot of
[48:41] struggles and a lot of times that we're
[48:43] in right now seems like the you know we
[48:46] had a prophet tell us years ago that the
[48:48] whole world would be crazy
[48:50] go crazy i think we're there
[48:53] i really do i don't know you know i
[48:56] suppose they could get a little more
[48:57] crazy
[48:59] but i also remember a friend of mine
[49:01] that worked at a
[49:02] insane asylum and
[49:05] you know when they had some very
[49:09] morbid type things i mean people would
[49:11] kill people because there was
[49:12] crazy people in there and occasionally
[49:15] one person you know he said the ones
[49:17] that were really scary were the psycho
[49:19] ward because 99.9 percent of the time
[49:22] they're normal
[49:24] but it's that other one-tenth that one
[49:26] percent that when they flip out
[49:28] they could kill two or three people with
[49:30] their bare hands because they have
[49:31] many devils and uh so they told them
[49:35] when they
[49:35] during the training that the the best
[49:38] pla
[49:39] the best way to subdue a crazy person is
[49:41] to act more crazy than they do
[49:45] and he said it really works he didn't
[49:46] believe it but he saw a case where
[49:49] a man that was possessed and there was a
[49:52] bunch of guys sitting around
[49:54] watching a television and somebody
[49:56] changed the channel and one guy got mad
[49:58] and
[49:58] he said it was a big tv up high and he
[50:01] said the guy walked over and took the tv
[50:03] and he was gonna drop it or made me may
[50:06] have dropped it on this guy i don't
[50:07] remember exactly the story and
[50:10] he said he picked that he said i weighed
[50:11] hundreds of pounds
[50:13] he said he just picked it up and you
[50:15] know and everybody's you know scattered
[50:17] and everything and
[50:18] uh he said the guy that was
[50:21] working in the ward when he saw what was
[50:23] happening he ran into the midst of the
[50:25] guys jumped up on the table and started
[50:26] acting like a monkey
[50:30] and he said the guy was he didn't drop
[50:32] it yet because he was looking at him
[50:33] like this with the tv
[50:35] and he dropped it and he pointed to the
[50:36] guy and goes that guy's crazy
[50:40] so so get crazy in the lord okay
[50:45] [Laughter]
[50:47] that's the point here and i think about
[50:51] you know all the what they call mandates
[50:53] they're not
[50:54] laws they're mandates and all the things
[50:56] they got going on
[50:57] in all these different states and
[51:00] the way we see you know it looks like
[51:02] the destruction of
[51:03] the united states which we do it's gotta
[51:06] end sometime but
[51:08] as it does let's us go into the kingdom
[51:10] of god
[51:12] and i think about uh somebody was saying
[51:15] you know in washington they're a lot
[51:16] more strict than idaho praise the lord
[51:19] for idaho
[51:20] but uh they said you know this mandate
[51:23] we have to do this you have to do all
[51:25] this
[51:26] things that you're supposed to do over
[51:27] there and somebody said well the latest
[51:29] one they didn't want you to sing in
[51:30] church
[51:32] i sat there and i thought about that
[51:34] well they want me to wear a mask i got
[51:37] one here somewhere i'm not sure
[51:40] you know what they want me to do that
[51:41] you want me to stand six feet from you
[51:42] well i can do that that's okay
[51:44] but not saying in church i found over 33
[51:48] versus just looking up singing just
[51:51] looking up singing and not
[51:52] you know worship where it says to sing
[51:55] in church
[51:56] and now maybe it's a little crazy but
[51:58] i'm not even be gonna be careful how i
[52:00] answer you
[52:03] and you look at the children you know
[52:04] shadrach meshach and abednego and it
[52:06] looked crazy
[52:08] because they said bow when you hear the
[52:09] music well
[52:11] and everybody else was bowed and they
[52:12] said we're not even going to be careful
[52:14] about this
[52:15] we know god's able to deliver me from
[52:17] this and
[52:18] whether he does or not that's his
[52:20] business but i ain't gonna bow
[52:24] in fact i'm gonna sing louder hallelujah
[52:28] and if you don't like it well have a
[52:30] nice day
[52:33] but that's just how i feel about it
[52:35] because that's the word of god and
[52:37] that's a life
[52:39] in me behind this life that you see
[52:42] you know praying with the brother there
[52:44] before service and
[52:46] uh you know he's he's saying lord
[52:49] forgive us of our sins when we think
[52:50] about this out guy he was born in sin
[52:53] shaped in iniquity came into the world
[52:56] speaking lies
[52:57] he didn't get born again the outside is
[53:01] not why i got born again
[53:03] while gorna got born again is the guy
[53:05] right here
[53:07] and as we yield to the life
[53:10] behind the life that's when this life
[53:13] starts acting like
[53:15] when it's the life that it's supposed to
[53:16] act like
[53:18] so as we look at these scriptures this
[53:20] morning i'm already getting
[53:22] this thing praise the lord
[53:26] but as we think about this when we look
[53:28] at these scriptures
[53:31] how that saul had been reigning in
[53:33] israel
[53:35] and it was the people's choice really
[53:37] that had brought saul
[53:39] to the forefront he was a head taller
[53:43] than everybody he was the
[53:44] looked like quite big shot he was quite
[53:46] quite the guy
[53:47] and you know he had some good points and
[53:50] things he did for israel that were okay
[53:53] but he had a few things
[53:54] the life behind the life that was in
[53:57] saul
[53:58] never really lined up you find that saul
[54:03] you know in one place he went down and
[54:04] he was supposed to kill
[54:06] everything and
[54:10] when samuel goes to see him saul said
[54:14] well i did everything you said
[54:16] and he says what's the lowing of the
[54:17] sheep
[54:19] well we need that for sacrifice to the
[54:22] lord
[54:23] well obedience is better than sacrifice
[54:28] and and he he said disobedience is a sin
[54:31] of witchcraft
[54:33] and so you see that the life that was in
[54:35] saul
[54:36] he was a godly man i suppose in fact he
[54:39] even
[54:39] spent some time with the prophets it
[54:42] said that how he went down and they said
[54:43] is saul now among the prophets so he
[54:45] knew about the anointing
[54:48] and he knew how to yield to the
[54:49] anointing he'd even you know done the
[54:51] things that he did
[54:52] but there's also a scripture when it
[54:54] talks about that point
[54:55] where it says that saul turned his back
[54:58] on samuel
[55:01] after he was anointed he turned his back
[55:04] on samuel
[55:06] i don't know who's saying the special
[55:08] but there are people that
[55:09] are turning their back on the word of
[55:12] the hour
[55:14] they can still be anointed they can
[55:15] still do all kinds of things god doesn't
[55:17] remove the anointing but once you leave
[55:20] that
[55:22] it becomes a sin of witchcraft
[55:27] i'm just telling you what the scripture
[55:28] says
[55:30] you know and and because of that
[55:33] saul suffered bitterly and
[55:36] we know how he got many devils
[55:40] upon him still anointed king
[55:43] and so so much anointed king that when
[55:46] david had the opportunity to slay him
[55:48] and even his friends are going kill him
[55:49] david
[55:51] he goes no man he's anointed of the lord
[55:56] and so because there was a life that was
[55:59] in david behind the life
[56:01] that matched with the word of his hour
[56:05] and the word of his day so let's look at
[56:08] that
[56:10] there in chapter 16 a little more
[56:14] closely so we the first thing we find is
[56:17] the word of the lord comes to samuel
[56:20] when we know this because it says the
[56:22] lord says unto samuel
[56:25] so god is speaking words to samuel so
[56:27] it's the word
[56:29] of god coming to samuel
[56:32] samuel is the first prophet i believe in
[56:34] the scripture where it says
[56:35] when he was called that it says uh that
[56:38] the word of
[56:39] the lord was revealed in shiloh
[56:42] to samuel so it's a revelation of the
[56:45] word and what that word is to bring
[56:47] forth
[56:48] and so that word of the lord is coming
[56:50] out of samuel
[56:52] and he begins to speak things concerning
[56:56] saul
[56:58] how do you say that sometimes the word
[57:02] of the lord
[57:03] is not always what we think of the will
[57:06] of the lord
[57:10] but he waits for us to see or he waits
[57:12] to see our reaction to the word
[57:16] to determine what the future of the word
[57:18] is
[57:20] because now samuel was he was a prophet
[57:24] he was anointed with the word of the
[57:25] lord and he's been interceding
[57:28] for saul
[57:31] that's the word of the lord we should
[57:32] intercede for people
[57:34] as the bride of jesus christ when we
[57:36] think of the spirit of the judgment
[57:38] well the judge is there to pardon the
[57:41] those that need pardoned and to condemn
[57:43] those that need to be condemned
[57:46] and we think well sometimes the things
[57:48] going on you
[57:49] you know there's a part of me that says
[57:52] you want to go to hell go ahead
[57:54] that's your business but there's another
[57:56] part that says lord don't
[57:58] they're blind they don't know what
[58:01] they're doing
[58:02] and so here was samuel and he'd been
[58:04] interceding for saul
[58:05] interceding finally the word of the lord
[58:07] comes to see okay
[58:09] samuel i appreciate what you've been
[58:11] doing and i understand
[58:13] but he says how long are you going to
[58:15] mourn for him
[58:17] how long are you going to intercede for
[58:18] this he goes i'm done with him
[58:21] that was the word of the lord and so he
[58:24] tells him
[58:25] you know go fill your horn with oil and
[58:27] i'm going to send thee to jesse
[58:29] the bethlehemite where does he send him
[58:35] where does the word send samuel who is
[58:38] the word of the lord for his day
[58:40] he sends him to bethlehem the house of
[58:43] god's bread
[58:46] because the word of the lord now is
[58:47] about to change
[58:49] how the bread is administered
[58:52] he's taking on a new form or a new life
[58:57] behind the life he's been on
[59:00] king saul as an anointing but the heart
[59:03] or the life
[59:04] behind the life didn't matter it was a
[59:07] life that was not
[59:09] in conjunction with what god desired
[59:13] and yet you had to see a samuel that was
[59:15] sitting there interceding in interceding
[59:17] interceding and god says that's enough
[59:20] i'm done with saul reigning over israel
[59:24] and what does he say she goes i'm going
[59:26] to send you
[59:27] to bethlehem the house of god's bread
[59:31] and watch the next line
[59:34] for i have provided me
[59:38] god himself the word of god is going to
[59:41] be proclaimed himself
[59:43] as king among his sons
[59:47] i provided me the word is providing
[59:51] himself
[59:51] to be our king it's not wrapped up in
[59:55] churches pastors or whatever you want to
[59:57] call it
[59:57] we're only here as part of him reigning
[1:00:00] as king
[1:00:01] in human beings praise the lord
[1:00:05] yeah i need nuance it's okay
[1:00:08] but it's god is providing himself a king
[1:00:13] and he's using the word of the hour
[1:00:15] samuel
[1:00:16] to provide it from the house of god's
[1:00:19] bread
[1:00:22] now what's going on here well we go to
[1:00:26] john the first chapter it says in the
[1:00:28] beginning was the word word was with god
[1:00:30] word was god and we you know you dropped
[1:00:33] down
[1:00:34] word became flesh where did it happen
[1:00:40] bethlehem
[1:00:42] so what is the life
[1:00:45] behind the life of the word in this
[1:00:48] space
[1:00:49] god is taking the throne
[1:00:52] right here because the word
[1:00:56] is sending the word to bethlehem amen
[1:00:59] where he will find the king amen
[1:01:03] where god will proclaim himself king
[1:01:07] so saul gets up
[1:01:10] in fact he complains about it he has
[1:01:12] tried he had trials too
[1:01:14] and so but he i can't go there they'll
[1:01:17] kill me
[1:01:18] well just go tell him you're coming for
[1:01:21] sacrifice and
[1:01:22] so samuel is obedient to the word and he
[1:01:25] goes
[1:01:26] and we know the story with the different
[1:01:28] brothers came through and
[1:01:29] nope nope nope nope nope
[1:01:33] and there's no more well
[1:01:39] yeah there's one more he's out with the
[1:01:41] sheep
[1:01:42] well go get him you know
[1:01:45] hey a couple of these brothers two or
[1:01:47] three of these brothers are
[1:01:49] captains in saul's army and they're
[1:01:52] probably thinking it's me
[1:01:54] i get to be next king no you know but
[1:01:58] they go get david and when david comes
[1:02:00] in
[1:02:02] they're all just looking at him you know
[1:02:03] he's been out with a sheep
[1:02:07] you know nobody washed his feet he
[1:02:09] probably was the foot what's up funky
[1:02:12] then you know and here he comes in and
[1:02:15] god says that's the one
[1:02:17] now what's happening it says he was
[1:02:19] ready
[1:02:20] and how did it say about that
[1:02:23] he was ready and had a beautiful
[1:02:26] countless
[1:02:26] countenance and got goodly to look upon
[1:02:30] so he comes in and he's not much to look
[1:02:33] at
[1:02:34] but he's got his countenance there's
[1:02:36] something about him
[1:02:37] that's different he's the youngest
[1:02:41] this you people with more than one child
[1:02:44] does the older one ever pick on the
[1:02:45] younger ones
[1:02:49] so he's got seven brothers
[1:02:52] going hey kid you know
[1:02:55] whatever you know everybody's house is a
[1:02:58] little different i'm sure they were just
[1:02:59] nice little soldiers and never treated
[1:03:01] david badly
[1:03:03] but and so they're looking at him come
[1:03:06] in and they're going
[1:03:07] yeah you got to be kidding
[1:03:11] i mean they're human beings
[1:03:14] you got our little brother but yet
[1:03:18] when samuel took the oil and he
[1:03:21] and he anoints what was happening
[1:03:24] he was he was humble he had been humbled
[1:03:27] by his brethren
[1:03:30] and he was the most humble and he comes
[1:03:33] in
[1:03:33] and the anointing falls upon him as king
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:37] but who was making himself king
[1:03:41] god the life behind the life the life
[1:03:44] behind the
[1:03:45] word behind the prophet is coming now
[1:03:47] through the anointing oil
[1:03:49] onto the most humble of all the brothers
[1:03:51] what's he doing
[1:03:52] the bible said jesus christ would come
[1:03:56] humbly
[1:03:58] he would be the most humble of all men
[1:04:00] upon the earth
[1:04:03] and here he comes in in you know natural
[1:04:06] life form
[1:04:08] and the brothers are doing that what was
[1:04:10] happening
[1:04:12] he said the bible says he would be
[1:04:14] rejected
[1:04:16] he would be despised his
[1:04:19] you don't think they despised him when
[1:04:21] they were down at the battle
[1:04:22] before goliath came along and when david
[1:04:25] goes down
[1:04:26] there he's going down there to feed him
[1:04:27] where did he get the bread
[1:04:29] from bethlehem and his dad said you know
[1:04:32] the father says go down feed your
[1:04:34] brethren
[1:04:35] and when he goes from bethlehem just
[1:04:37] feed his brethren what do they say david
[1:04:39] get out of here
[1:04:42] get out of here troublemaker
[1:04:46] what was it it was god showing
[1:04:49] himself as king
[1:04:53] he would be rejected of his own brethren
[1:04:57] it was god showing the nature
[1:05:00] of the king of kings in a humble
[1:05:03] shepherd boy why a shepherd boy
[1:05:06] who's the chief shepherd amen right
[1:05:10] that's right god is the chief shepherd
[1:05:13] after he was anointed the next day was
[1:05:15] david up the head of the army with the
[1:05:17] shepherd's staff
[1:05:19] no he was right back out in the field
[1:05:22] protecting the sheep amen what was it
[1:05:27] god showing himself to be king
[1:05:31] and a humble shepherd boy
[1:05:35] god said i'm anointing me a king
[1:05:38] me god wants to be the king
[1:05:41] and this is what i'm going to look like
[1:05:44] that's the life behind the life
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:48] i don't think david really knew you know
[1:05:49] i'm i'm walking out and i'm
[1:05:52] i'm making a type and a shadow for the
[1:05:54] messiah
[1:05:55] i doubt if he knew that
[1:05:59] maybe but i don't find it
[1:06:02] written in the word that way but we
[1:06:05] think
[1:06:05] as it goes on and how that you know and
[1:06:08] i know we've talked about this before
[1:06:10] and when goliath came out and
[1:06:12] you know all the other his brothers and
[1:06:15] the whole army of israel
[1:06:17] saul included an anointed king
[1:06:20] all inclusive and when goliath steps up
[1:06:24] what do they do
[1:06:26] oh man this is not a good deal
[1:06:30] you know and they're all hiding but
[1:06:31] david what's he do he jumps up on the
[1:06:34] rock
[1:06:34] and says who is that uncircumcised
[1:06:37] philistine
[1:06:38] what was that that's it it's the life
[1:06:42] behind the life it didn't matter what
[1:06:44] enemy stood before
[1:06:47] it's god showing himself as king
[1:06:50] showing himself as the mighty warrior i
[1:06:53] don't
[1:06:54] care satan who you are
[1:06:57] i'll not even be careful how i answer
[1:07:00] you goliath
[1:07:02] glasses i'll feed you the birds really
[1:07:04] i'm going to cut your head off
[1:07:06] and what was that god showing himself as
[1:07:09] the prophet
[1:07:13] because god is speaking through that
[1:07:14] king that that little
[1:07:17] shepherd boy king i'm gonna cut your
[1:07:19] head off
[1:07:20] and he did it amen
[1:07:24] god is the prophet jehovah prophet
[1:07:27] jehovah king jehovah or banner
[1:07:30] jehovah our warrior amen
[1:07:34] all in the life of a shepherd boy
[1:07:37] the life behind the life
[1:07:42] well we know there's other things that
[1:07:44] happen
[1:07:46] and how that you know you think about
[1:07:50] sin or unbelief as brother branham
[1:07:53] told us in his unbelief and it's
[1:07:56] unbelief in the word of god
[1:07:58] but we think about you know watching the
[1:08:02] life
[1:08:03] of the king the king in the king
[1:08:07] and how that he got scared
[1:08:12] david got scared when an anointed king
[1:08:15] cast his javelin to kill him david said
[1:08:19] it's time to go
[1:08:21] i'm not going to hang around here any
[1:08:22] longer and he left
[1:08:26] the king of israel and all his armies
[1:08:29] and fled to the wilderness where did
[1:08:32] jesus go when he was
[1:08:35] feeling like he was signed to god lord i
[1:08:37] need a break
[1:08:39] he would go to the wilderness so what's
[1:08:42] the life behind the life
[1:08:45] david said i got to get out of here this
[1:08:46] is too much
[1:08:48] and so he fled fleeced to the wilderness
[1:08:52] but even when he's in the wilderness i
[1:08:53] think last time we were here we preached
[1:08:55] about the sword that
[1:08:56] the priest gave him the bible said he
[1:08:59] was a man
[1:09:00] after god's own heart when that priest
[1:09:02] gave him that sword
[1:09:04] what was it it was hidden behind the
[1:09:06] ephod
[1:09:08] and it's what does the sword represent
[1:09:10] the word of god
[1:09:12] where is it where is it hidden behind
[1:09:15] the ephod of this skin
[1:09:17] amen brother sister
[1:09:21] the kingdom of god is where up there
[1:09:25] that's not what the bible says he said
[1:09:28] it's within you
[1:09:31] liable to get i have to get going on
[1:09:33] another message if i'm not careful right
[1:09:35] here
[1:09:35] but and so he flees into the wilderness
[1:09:40] he receives that sword while he's in the
[1:09:41] wilderness
[1:09:42] uh from the high priest
[1:09:45] who's the high priest of our confession
[1:09:49] christ who's the word of god
[1:09:52] who received the word of god from behind
[1:09:54] the ephod that
[1:09:55] is over the heart of the priest and so
[1:09:58] we see it's
[1:09:59] god declaring himself in different types
[1:10:02] and shadows you could break
[1:10:03] i know you brothers can break this out
[1:10:06] in different
[1:10:07] all different forms of types and shadows
[1:10:09] and even uh
[1:10:12] i know brother branham one time was
[1:10:14] talking about types he said well there's
[1:10:16] the type the ant
[1:10:17] i type the ante type and the type of the
[1:10:20] type
[1:10:22] so and sometimes they're right over the
[1:10:24] top of each other
[1:10:26] and you have to kind of sort through the
[1:10:29] words to go ah i see that there but
[1:10:32] write it that word it changes to this
[1:10:34] other thing and
[1:10:36] because it's a life behind the life
[1:10:40] and we know that the whole army of
[1:10:41] israel went out a bit against david
[1:10:44] he's fleeing he doesn't want to go
[1:10:47] through with what this
[1:10:49] thing is and he flees from saul and he
[1:10:52] goes and hides in the wilderness and
[1:10:54] saul
[1:10:54] compasses him about by the cave and now
[1:10:56] this time it's david that's afraid
[1:10:59] and sometimes we are
[1:11:03] you know there's that scripture in
[1:11:04] ecclesiastes a time to do this a time to
[1:11:06] do that a time to this time to that
[1:11:08] sometimes we're to stand up boldly say
[1:11:12] i'm not even going to be careful and the
[1:11:13] next time you see david coming out of
[1:11:15] the cave
[1:11:16] very carefully how he's walking
[1:11:20] because he doesn't want to disturb those
[1:11:23] guys or he's dead
[1:11:26] and that's the life behind the life
[1:11:29] is knowing how to rightly divide the
[1:11:32] truth
[1:11:33] for our lives you as individuals i can't
[1:11:35] live your life for you
[1:11:37] you live different places you have
[1:11:38] different jobs you do different stuff
[1:11:42] everything's different but you
[1:11:45] and your relationship with jesus christ
[1:11:47] that's why it's not can't be a church
[1:11:49] relationship
[1:11:50] amen i have no way i could lead this
[1:11:53] church
[1:11:55] because every single one of you is
[1:11:56] different from a different background
[1:11:58] you're from a different
[1:11:59] some of you are from different cultures
[1:12:01] different languages
[1:12:06] all kinds of everything's different
[1:12:10] but each one of you are to have a
[1:12:12] relationship
[1:12:14] from bethlehem with the king
[1:12:18] amen and gain the life behind the life
[1:12:23] and i've seen brothers before and how
[1:12:25] they argue over certain things
[1:12:28] and i'm sitting there going man these
[1:12:29] guys are they're getting really hot
[1:12:30] about this
[1:12:31] and at one point i realized you know
[1:12:33] what they're both right
[1:12:36] they are both completely right but one
[1:12:38] is speaking of that as a natural term
[1:12:40] and the other one is speaking of the
[1:12:42] type and shadow
[1:12:44] and they're both and here they're
[1:12:45] fighting over the same words
[1:12:49] well it's the life behind the life
[1:12:53] and so one case david stands up boldly
[1:12:56] the next case he's walking
[1:12:58] very carefully and what is that you say
[1:13:01] well looks like unbelief
[1:13:04] why didn't he just stand up and okay
[1:13:05] saul i'm gonna fight you
[1:13:08] it wasn't the time he even told the guy
[1:13:11] not now it's not the right
[1:13:15] time so we have to recognize
[1:13:18] you know brother brown and preach that
[1:13:20] wonderful message recognizing your day
[1:13:23] and its message it's easy to look out
[1:13:26] there and say well we know what day
[1:13:27] we're living in
[1:13:28] we're living right at the edge you know
[1:13:31] right of things going down
[1:13:33] being done with that's what age we're
[1:13:36] living in
[1:13:37] but there's a message with this age
[1:13:42] and it's not just a message of 1200
[1:13:45] tapes and books and whatever
[1:13:48] it's a life behind the message
[1:13:51] it's what life are you living that's
[1:13:53] right
[1:13:54] from that message what kind of life is
[1:13:57] that putting in you
[1:13:59] and it's easy to criticize oh bro i mean
[1:14:01] that brother got so mad at him
[1:14:03] what's the matter with that brother can
[1:14:05] he be more forgiving
[1:14:06] and that brother might be looking at you
[1:14:08] are you crazy do you know what that guy
[1:14:10] just did
[1:14:13] it's a different life
[1:14:16] my feet are not called to do what my
[1:14:19] ears do
[1:14:21] they're just not called to that
[1:14:24] now if i lost part of an ear you could
[1:14:26] take maybe some of the skin off the
[1:14:28] bottom and sew it on there and
[1:14:29] you know sure look funny but it might
[1:14:32] work
[1:14:34] but it has a different calling and each
[1:14:37] one of you as individuals has a
[1:14:39] different calling
[1:14:41] you have something god has for you to do
[1:14:45] and i find myself a lot of times going
[1:14:47] to the lord
[1:14:48] what's my part in this
[1:14:52] and what you know am i supposed to stand
[1:14:54] up like david before goliath or am i
[1:14:56] just supposed to sneak out of here
[1:14:59] you know with nobody even knowing i
[1:15:00] always joke with brother george
[1:15:02] smith because he tells me how do you get
[1:15:04] away with some of this stuff that you do
[1:15:07] i said i live by two laws george stay
[1:15:10] under the wire
[1:15:10] and leave no trace
[1:15:14] that's just that's how i was trained as
[1:15:18] a child
[1:15:20] he used to work with the boy scouts and
[1:15:21] go in the wilderness and all that and he
[1:15:23] always
[1:15:23] trained you'd leave no trace well and i
[1:15:27] kind of liked it once i got to study in
[1:15:28] enoch
[1:15:30] he didn't leave a trace so
[1:15:33] just trying to live my part
[1:15:36] but so we see that and we know life goes
[1:15:40] on
[1:15:40] and how we read there in uh first
[1:15:42] chronicles
[1:15:43] there came the day when saul had been
[1:15:46] done away with by his own means
[1:15:49] david didn't have to kill him and how do
[1:15:52] you have killed him it would have been
[1:15:54] out of order that at the time that saul
[1:15:57] was
[1:15:58] get away with himself essentially
[1:16:02] remember the sin of
[1:16:05] oh disobedience was the sin of
[1:16:06] witchcraft where did he go right before
[1:16:08] he died
[1:16:11] he went to a witch
[1:16:14] that was supposed to have been killed
[1:16:16] but
[1:16:17] somebody missed her because she had a
[1:16:21] part to fulfill
[1:16:22] for saul to prove to him
[1:16:26] what his sin had done saul you said to
[1:16:30] kill all the witches
[1:16:32] but here i am as a witch conjuring up
[1:16:35] samuel
[1:16:36] for you because of your disobedience
[1:16:42] the life behind the life
[1:16:45] it showed that no matter how great or
[1:16:47] how big saul was and how great his
[1:16:49] anointing was
[1:16:51] something never got all the way down
[1:16:53] there
[1:16:55] he saved because samuel said you know
[1:16:58] saul this day you know by this time
[1:17:00] tomorrow you'll dwell with me he was a
[1:17:01] saved he was you know we would call it a
[1:17:03] christian man
[1:17:04] he was saved he had received salvation
[1:17:07] the salvation of his day through the
[1:17:09] sacrifice
[1:17:12] but he didn't have what it took to show
[1:17:15] the king amen he was a king
[1:17:20] and perhaps a good one in his early
[1:17:21] years
[1:17:23] but he didn't have the life in that
[1:17:26] particular case to show
[1:17:27] the king because the anointing when god
[1:17:30] said anoint
[1:17:31] me a king me asking if you want to put
[1:17:34] it that way
[1:17:36] david's the one he's the humble one
[1:17:39] he's the one that does what i tell him
[1:17:42] to do
[1:17:44] he's the one that acts on the word of
[1:17:46] god
[1:17:47] so we fast forward a little bit and we
[1:17:49] know
[1:17:50] look out david you got in trouble
[1:17:54] and shouldn't have took that woman david
[1:17:59] she wasn't yours and you even murdered
[1:18:02] me murdered a man
[1:18:05] to do it and she even
[1:18:08] became impregnated but god
[1:18:12] never let that child live
[1:18:15] and when we do wrong
[1:18:18] god will not let that child live
[1:18:22] that child has to die did brother
[1:18:25] branham said he said
[1:18:27] you have to die daily this child this
[1:18:30] stuff
[1:18:30] this child has to die amen it's
[1:18:34] got to die it was born of
[1:18:38] adultery he came into the world
[1:18:41] speaking lies it was born of adultery
[1:18:46] all the way back to the garden of eden
[1:18:48] that's how these bodies got here
[1:18:50] y'all got a belly button that tells me
[1:18:52] how you got here
[1:18:54] it's true i know it's kind of it sounds
[1:18:57] funny but it's true
[1:18:59] it tells us how we got here because of
[1:19:01] sin
[1:19:02] in the garden so we look at david
[1:19:05] and the life behind the life and david
[1:19:09] because of that
[1:19:11] he got the man killed and he was able
[1:19:14] then to take his little bride bathsheba
[1:19:18] and brought forth another son
[1:19:22] and this son so pleased god
[1:19:25] but let's just backstab just a little
[1:19:27] bit because when
[1:19:28] nathan the prophet at this time comes to
[1:19:30] david
[1:19:32] and he begins to tell him the story he
[1:19:34] said you know there was a guy
[1:19:36] and he had a bunch of sheep and such and
[1:19:39] such such
[1:19:39] shots you know there's another guy over
[1:19:41] he's he's only got one sheep
[1:19:43] but this guy over here he wanted that
[1:19:45] guy's one sheep so he killed him
[1:19:48] and took his one sheep what do you how
[1:19:50] do you judge this david
[1:19:54] why did he tell him the story of a
[1:19:56] shepherd
[1:19:58] why didn't he tell him about kings and
[1:20:00] great men
[1:20:03] because david understood the shepherd
[1:20:06] and he understood maybe that somebody
[1:20:08] had done that to him
[1:20:10] took his only sheep we don't really know
[1:20:14] there's all kinds of things happen
[1:20:15] between point a and point b
[1:20:18] and he knew what it felt like he said
[1:20:21] the man should die
[1:20:23] that did that that was proper
[1:20:26] judgment brother branham said it proved
[1:20:29] that david had the proper judgment
[1:20:32] under the law because under the law a
[1:20:35] man that committed adultery should have
[1:20:37] been stoned and burnt with fire
[1:20:40] he should have been killed a man that
[1:20:43] not just committed adultery but a man
[1:20:45] that committed murder he was to be
[1:20:47] stoned and burned with fire under the
[1:20:49] law it was the proper judgment
[1:20:51] it was the life behind the life the law
[1:20:54] living forth through david at the story
[1:20:57] of a shepherd
[1:21:02] what did the prophet say david
[1:21:06] you'll not surely die you ever think
[1:21:09] about those words
[1:21:11] what did the serpent say to eve
[1:21:14] you'll not surely die
[1:21:18] but there's a time those same words must
[1:21:20] be used to provide life
[1:21:23] because the other thing you know think
[1:21:24] about was there was it takes you know we
[1:21:27] say that
[1:21:28] in our language two to tango right and
[1:21:30] you had a woman over there
[1:21:32] that was caught in the same act
[1:21:35] that 600 years later when they brought
[1:21:38] her before jesus
[1:21:40] what did jesus say or they said you know
[1:21:42] the law says to stoner what do you say
[1:21:45] well he said you know he starts writing
[1:21:47] on the ground and they all leave
[1:21:49] he says where's your accusers she said
[1:21:52] they're gone
[1:21:54] he said then neither do i accuse you go
[1:21:56] your way and sin no more
[1:21:59] well there was another woman involved in
[1:22:01] that story that we don't hear because
[1:22:03] there's a life behind the life
[1:22:06] and she is going to become the type and
[1:22:09] shadow
[1:22:10] of the bride of jesus christ because she
[1:22:13] has received
[1:22:14] the man is the word the life comes from
[1:22:16] yes the seed comes through the man
[1:22:18] she had received the seed of her husband
[1:22:21] david
[1:22:22] the bride of jesus christ we receive our
[1:22:25] seed from our husband jesus christ
[1:22:27] and she's standing there too watching
[1:22:30] what's going on what's going on and he's
[1:22:32] giving this story david said you can't
[1:22:34] kill him
[1:22:35] she'd have been dead too
[1:22:39] finished stoned and burnt with fire
[1:22:43] so the grace that was extended to david
[1:22:47] by the word of god also extended to the
[1:22:50] wife
[1:22:52] and not just the wife the son
[1:22:57] hallelujah it's the life behind the life
[1:23:02] and she's standing there i'm not surely
[1:23:04] dying i bet she's going
[1:23:08] because what if she understood what it
[1:23:11] was all about
[1:23:12] and she might oh man this is not
[1:23:15] sounding good
[1:23:17] in fact this kind of sounds like
[1:23:18] something that happened in my family
[1:23:22] texas again my family okay
[1:23:26] but and that grace
[1:23:30] that extended itself by the word to
[1:23:34] david who is standing in position of
[1:23:39] god showing himself as king.
[1:23:44] he said you'll not die david and neither
[1:23:47] will your bride
[1:23:49] and your bride will bring forth a son
[1:23:51] named solomon
[1:23:53] who will sit upon the throne

[1:24:09] son of david and where did the
[1:24:14] bloodline come or the word line if you
[1:24:16] want to call it the life behind
[1:24:17] the blood that's it it came from
[1:24:21] the word to the king that saved the
[1:24:25] the bride that transmits itself to the
[1:24:28] sun
[1:24:29] that goes all those things you know so

[1:24:35] you see it runs all the way out to begot
[1:24:37] joseph
[1:24:39] we know that joseph had nothing to do
[1:24:40] with the birth of jesus christ really
[1:24:42] other than he was just
[1:24:43] the guy that was there to take care of
[1:24:47] mary but the word
[1:24:50] take care of mary
[1:24:54] you're mary that's it
[1:25:02] and the life now comes to the but to the
[1:25:05] word again

[1:25:22] how can this be
[1:25:26] well the holy ghost will overshadow you
[1:25:29] and this will happen and you'll yeah and
[1:25:32] she said what
[1:25:33] being unto me according to your word
[1:25:38] give me the life behind
[1:25:41] the word amen because it wasn't just
[1:25:44] words that came to her the angel spoke
[1:25:46] words just like we're speaking to you
[1:25:48] right now
[1:25:50] but if it's just words well the book's
[1:25:53] full of them
[1:25:55] it has to be a life behind the word
[1:25:58] hallelujah
[1:25:59] and when the life when she recognized it
[1:26:03] that's not just words that's
[1:26:06] supernatural
[1:26:07] life being spoken into my womb
[1:26:12] and what did it bring forth a
[1:26:13] supernatural life
[1:26:15] of a supernatural king
[1:26:18] let's jump back again and because of
[1:26:21] david
[1:26:22] and because of that what happened to
[1:26:23] david he lost his throne
[1:26:26] lost it he's a human being just like you
[1:26:29] and i
[1:26:30] do you ever wonder if well you know he's
[1:26:32] watching all the people leave
[1:26:34] and his size you know one of his other
[1:26:36] sons is threatening to kill him
[1:26:38] and land with his other wives and you
[1:26:40] know doing doing all kinds of bad stuff
[1:26:45] you think maybe he didn't kind of stand
[1:26:46] there and say oh man david
[1:26:49] hi lord i really blew this thing
[1:26:52] i'm not being much of a king
[1:26:56] look what i've done to the kingdom look
[1:26:58] what's happening
[1:27:01] you think you didn't feel convicted
[1:27:04] i'm thinking he felt real convicted
[1:27:07] lord i'm sorry i did this and we know
[1:27:11] that some of the psalms came forth
[1:27:12] because
[1:27:13] of that and how he even cried out
[1:27:18] why because the word of the king was
[1:27:20] within the king was within him
[1:27:22] and he said created me a clean heart
[1:27:27] a clean heart oh god and restore what
[1:27:31] what had happened he took the wrong
[1:27:33] spirit
[1:27:35] he had taken a lustful spirit he said
[1:27:38] restore
[1:27:39] the spirit lord restore that spirit that
[1:27:42] came
[1:27:43] all the way back here from samuel
[1:27:47] and the word and the life behind the
[1:27:49] word amen
[1:27:50] on samuel that transposed itself onto
[1:27:54] david to make him to show us
[1:27:58] god as king in david amen
[1:28:02] we think about david uh we can read it
[1:28:04] at second chronicles
[1:28:07] brother branham of course he says this
[1:28:10] far better than i'll get
[1:28:11] out today but second chronicles no first
[1:28:14] chronicles huh
[1:28:16] i don't know i keep wanting to go to
[1:28:17] second chronicles today but
[1:28:20] it must be something first chronicles
[1:28:23] 11th chapter
[1:28:26] it says uh
[1:28:31] that the philistines had you know
[1:28:34] garrisoned
[1:28:35] essentially bethlehem and in verse
[1:28:39] 15 of the 11th chapter first chronicles
[1:28:42] he said now three of the 30 captains
[1:28:44] went down to the rock
[1:28:45] to david where did that where was david
[1:28:49] he's on the rock
[1:28:53] who's the rock of our salvation jesus
[1:28:57] christ
[1:28:57] the king of kings so he's on the rock
[1:29:00] and they go down there
[1:29:03] but he's hiding he's in the hold
[1:29:06] and the philistines had bethlehem
[1:29:10] garrison they had it
[1:29:13] we don't have time to go into why
[1:29:15] philistines are what they are and what
[1:29:16] they represent but
[1:29:18] they had the house of god's bread
[1:29:22] to where nobody could get the bread
[1:29:25] they couldn't get it the philistines had
[1:29:28] it garrisoned off
[1:29:30] they had every kind of denominational
[1:29:32] creed
[1:29:34] every kind of whatever doctrine
[1:29:37] great men whatever it was they had
[1:29:39] philistines had some great guys not just
[1:29:41] goliath he had brothers
[1:29:44] and here's david hold up on the rock
[1:29:47] hiding from the philistines wondering
[1:29:50] what are we going to do
[1:29:51] we can't even get to the house of god's
[1:29:53] bread and he just has a desire
[1:29:56] oh oh that i had a drink let's read it
[1:30:00] verse 17 and david longed and said oh
[1:30:02] that one would give me a drink
[1:30:04] of the water of the well of bethlehem
[1:30:06] that is
[1:30:07] at the gate and the three men
[1:30:11] says the three break through the host of
[1:30:12] philistines and drew the water out of
[1:30:14] the well of bethlehem
[1:30:15] that was by the gate and took it and
[1:30:17] brought it to david
[1:30:20] dot dot time space he's thinking about
[1:30:23] this
[1:30:25] it says but david wouldn't drink of it
[1:30:27] but poured it out
[1:30:29] upon the to the lord and said my god
[1:30:33] forbid it
[1:30:34] that i should do this thing shall i
[1:30:36] drink the blood of these
[1:30:38] men that have put their lives in
[1:30:40] jeopardy
[1:30:41] amen the life that was in
[1:30:44] them put their lives
[1:30:48] in jeopardy for the king
[1:30:51] who was not even a king yet
[1:30:55] but they saw something in that king
[1:30:59] that said that king will be like god to
[1:31:02] us
[1:31:03] why because he was writing the types
[1:31:08] and shadows in his life
[1:31:11] of the king and so they go there
[1:31:14] and they fought they bought they break
[1:31:15] through and they bring the water to
[1:31:17] david
[1:31:19] i love the way you know they put them in
[1:31:22] in india they put their lives in
[1:31:25] jeopardy for their king
[1:31:27] david said i can't drink that water not
[1:31:30] after what these men have done
[1:31:33] i can't do it and he pours it out
[1:31:36] upon the ground i've often wondered what
[1:31:39] if i was one of the guys
[1:31:44] you know in a carnal way i think yeah
[1:31:47] i fought through all those guys and just
[1:31:49] dumping it out on the ground
[1:31:52] you know that's just natural thinking
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:55] but what was he doing brother branham
[1:31:58] said
[1:31:59] what was the well of bethlehem who is
[1:32:01] the well of bethlehem is the right way
[1:32:03] to ask it
[1:32:04] amen who is the well of bethlehem jesus
[1:32:07] christ
[1:32:08] the spirit of god and they went and they
[1:32:11] drew from the well of bethlehem
[1:32:15] a charge of water and they bring it to
[1:32:17] the king
[1:32:18] and when david sees it he pours it out
[1:32:24] christ is the well of bethlehem jesus
[1:32:27] said take the cup this is my blood
[1:32:31] what was in the cup the life
[1:32:35] and when david saw the life that was in
[1:32:38] them had been willing to fight for the
[1:32:40] life
[1:32:41] from the water of bethlehem he said i
[1:32:43] gotta pour it out and christ
[1:32:45] poured himself out for you and i at
[1:32:48] calvary
[1:32:50] because it was god the life behind the
[1:32:53] light
[1:32:53] showing us the life of jesus christ
[1:32:56] in king david
[1:33:00] praise the lord amen you understand it's
[1:33:03] the life
[1:33:05] it's his life in you and it i
[1:33:08] it's his life that makes us what we are
[1:33:15] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:33:21] and it was christ being poured out for
[1:33:24] you and i
[1:33:25] yeah so we see another type of the life
[1:33:28] behind the life
[1:33:30] and then we see you know david when he
[1:33:32] was thinking oh man i sure blew this
[1:33:34] and so he's oh i better get out of here
[1:33:37] they're going to get me too
[1:33:39] and so he heads up the hill and he stops
[1:33:41] on a rock
[1:33:43] and he begins to weep over jerusalem
[1:33:48] oh lord look what i've done
[1:33:51] look what i've done to your kingdom
[1:33:55] it's divided i
[1:33:59] what drove him to that rock what
[1:34:02] caused him to weep there over jerusalem
[1:34:05] well it was the sin of adultery
[1:34:09] and 600 years more or less we find jesus
[1:34:13] christ walking
[1:34:14] up the same hill maybe even
[1:34:17] looked around and sat on the same rock
[1:34:21] what drove him to do that
[1:34:24] the sin of adultery all the way back to
[1:34:27] the garden of eden
[1:34:30] because it was there that he had to weep
[1:34:33] over jerusalem
[1:34:34] because just as david the little
[1:34:37] shepherd boy
[1:34:37] was rejected of his brethren jesus
[1:34:40] christ has now been rejected
[1:34:43] of his own people and is getting ready
[1:34:47] to pour out his life
[1:34:50] for you and i for the bride
[1:34:54] to whom when the word said david you'll
[1:34:57] not surely die
[1:34:58] neither did she and yet she carried the
[1:35:02] bloodline
[1:35:03] from this one to this one to this one
[1:35:07] to this one and when it got to joseph
[1:35:11] what did it do it went back to the word
[1:35:13] which came to mary
[1:35:16] because only the word had the life
[1:35:19] that could reign as king
[1:35:23] praise the lord
[1:35:26] i love him and i think about
[1:35:30] you know all the stuff going on around
[1:35:32] us we're
[1:35:33] in a pretty crazy time and we understand
[1:35:35] things are you know starting to go over
[1:35:36] the edge
[1:35:38] and all that and
[1:35:41] every kingdom has to be thrown down
[1:35:44] that his kingdom can reign on high amen
[1:35:48] but where does it start the kingdom of
[1:35:52] god
[1:35:52] is with in you
[1:35:56] the kingdom of god is within us
[1:36:00] it's not you know like whoop this
[1:36:02] kingdom's right over there and we're
[1:36:03] going to
[1:36:05] jump into it it has to be here first
[1:36:09] it has to be here first
[1:36:12] or he said you'll never even see it
[1:36:14] except you'd be born again well what
[1:36:15] does born again do
[1:36:16] what's the kingdom within you right
[1:36:20] and i know the devil always comes alone
[1:36:24] you're not born again go out and do this
[1:36:26] go out and do that
[1:36:28] but i don't want to do that well just go
[1:36:30] do it because
[1:36:31] it's no good you're lost he's a liar
[1:36:36] he lied from the very first time he's
[1:36:39] lying to you
[1:36:40] most likely now if you've never come the
[1:36:42] way
[1:36:43] god said to do which whosoever calleth
[1:36:47] on the name of the lord shall be saved
[1:36:48] saul was saved the bible said he was the
[1:36:51] enemy of god
[1:36:53] you surrender your heart and life and
[1:36:56] then you
[1:36:57] step into the obedience to the word
[1:36:59] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:37:01] christ
[1:37:01] and when you do that you receive a
[1:37:03] promise you shall receive
[1:37:07] you shall
[1:37:10] might take amen 10 seconds
[1:37:14] might take 10 years but you hang on to
[1:37:17] the promise
[1:37:18] because it's the only baptism of the
[1:37:20] promise i've had people say well
[1:37:22] we baptize father son and holy ghost
[1:37:25] like jesus said well okay
[1:37:30] and when i go into roman catholic
[1:37:31] countries and have people want to be
[1:37:33] baptized
[1:37:34] the family is all catholics what i do i
[1:37:36] baptize you in the name of the father
[1:37:37] son and holy ghost which is
[1:37:40] the lord jesus christ
[1:37:43] and the family is happy oh
[1:37:47] yeah we got it he did it right
[1:37:51] but acts 2 38 is the one with the
[1:37:53] promise
[1:37:55] you go you can go up down you know i
[1:37:57] don't know jump up and down on the other
[1:37:58] one
[1:37:59] maybe maybe not i don't want no maybe
[1:38:02] not in my life
[1:38:05] i want the promise of god and he said
[1:38:08] you shall receive
[1:38:09] and how now we're talking about the life
[1:38:11] behind the life is the subject we've got
[1:38:13] on today
[1:38:14] and it's like so what's the life behind
[1:38:16] that
[1:38:17] when you run it out to the new testament
[1:38:18] to the day of pentecost
[1:38:21] the life behind the life that had
[1:38:24] created jesus christ
[1:38:26] as we know through type and shadow of
[1:38:27] king david coming all the way down
[1:38:29] and here the life behind the life that
[1:38:32] has now
[1:38:32] created jesus christ
[1:38:36] now that sounds a little tough doesn't
[1:38:38] it what do you mean created jesus
[1:38:41] that's it the bible says he was the
[1:38:44] beginning of the
[1:38:46] creation of god
[1:38:49] that's right god
[1:38:52] showing himself as king in king david
[1:38:56] those types of shadows we've been
[1:38:58] talking about what were they
[1:39:01] they were the life that was going to be
[1:39:04] exposed
[1:39:04] fully in jesus christ
[1:39:08] we look good as types and shadows oh it
[1:39:11] was like
[1:39:12] you know it was christ being poured out
[1:39:14] it was christ
[1:39:15] the well of bethlehem it was christ it
[1:39:17] was christ
[1:39:19] but the fulfillment of all those types
[1:39:21] and shadows
[1:39:22] was the day that jesus stepped out
[1:39:26] on the scene and said this day
[1:39:29] this scripture is fulfilled the life
[1:39:34] behind all of those things had now come
[1:39:38] and was to be manifest there's other
[1:39:39] places in the scripture you could look
[1:39:41] we have looked a little bit before you
[1:39:43] know abraham of course is one
[1:39:46] and how that uh
[1:39:49] it couldn't come through father abraham
[1:39:52] the one that's called the father of our
[1:39:53] faith
[1:39:54] which you can look in romans to find out
[1:39:56] what that is
[1:39:58] speaking those things which are not as
[1:40:01] though they are
[1:40:03] that's the father of the faith
[1:40:06] but salvation didn't come through the
[1:40:09] father it came through the sun
[1:40:11] because when god tempts him it says in
[1:40:13] the bible that
[1:40:14] you know abraham take your son up and
[1:40:18] slain as a sacrifice
[1:40:23] abraham was looking at this going you
[1:40:25] know
[1:40:27] i got him supernaturally in the first
[1:40:29] place so
[1:40:31] i guess god's able god's able to raise
[1:40:33] him up and so
[1:40:36] in his heart he's determined to do it
[1:40:39] but when they're going when he's going
[1:40:40] up the hill the sun now is the one
[1:40:42] carrying the wood
[1:40:44] and all the other parts of the sacrifice
[1:40:46] the the fire and
[1:40:48] the knife and all that stuff it's the
[1:40:50] sun that's going up the hill
[1:40:54] but it's the lifeline that came from
[1:40:58] abraham is now living in the sun
[1:41:02] the life behind the life going up the
[1:41:05] hill he says
[1:41:07] hey dad uh
[1:41:11] we got the fire we got the knife we got
[1:41:14] the wood
[1:41:15] where's the lamb
[1:41:19] he was old enough he knew what was going
[1:41:21] on
[1:41:23] dad where's the lamb maybe getting just
[1:41:26] a little worried
[1:41:27] because there were people on earth at
[1:41:29] that time that practiced child sacrifice
[1:41:33] dad are you in the right doctrine here
[1:41:38] come on and what is abraham said
[1:41:43] the word speaking those things which
[1:41:46] are not as though they are says god
[1:41:49] will provide himself
[1:41:53] amen a sacrifice
[1:41:57] what was that it's the mind of
[1:42:01] god that's right speaking into
[1:42:04] existence amen
[1:42:07] well when abraham gets ready to kill him
[1:42:10] what happens the word comes to abraham
[1:42:12] don't do it abraham
[1:42:13] you don't need to look over there caught
[1:42:15] in the thorn bush
[1:42:17] amen what's there
[1:42:20] ram because the time wasn't
[1:42:24] yet for jesus christ to come on the
[1:42:27] scene where god would provide himself
[1:42:29] amen that sacrifice
[1:42:33] but the life behind the life spoke the
[1:42:35] word
[1:42:36] and god says you just here's your you
[1:42:39] know we would call it a placebo right
[1:42:42] just take this sugar capsule and you'll
[1:42:45] get better
[1:42:47] because the blood and bulls and ghosts
[1:42:48] wouldn't do it but it was the type and
[1:42:51] shadow
[1:42:52] that god was going to create himself as
[1:42:55] our sacrifice
[1:42:57] through jesus christ you love him
[1:43:01] so we can find him in abraham we can
[1:43:04] find him other places in the scripture
[1:43:07] there's a genesis 49 you want to take we
[1:43:10] got time for this i
[1:43:12] you only have one service so does that
[1:43:13] mean we got six hours we
[1:43:16] they told me when we were in chile one
[1:43:18] of the places we went they put the
[1:43:20] little thing on me
[1:43:21] the guy put new batteries in he says you
[1:43:23] got three hours in there and i'm going
[1:43:25] oh sweet
[1:43:26] [Laughter]
[1:43:28] we can be here at least three hours
[1:43:32] but we didn't do that to him but and i
[1:43:34] don't want to
[1:43:36] elaborate but let's just look at the
[1:43:38] life behind the life
[1:43:39] and this is this is just so you have a
[1:43:40] third example
[1:43:43] in jesus in genesis the 49th chapter
[1:43:47] you have a different prophet his name is
[1:43:50] jacob
[1:43:51] and he's a prophet yes he is his words
[1:43:55] are all right here in the book
[1:43:56] this is a book prophecy and he begins to
[1:44:00] he knows
[1:44:01] his time is about to depart
[1:44:05] and he calls all of his sons together
[1:44:08] and he begins to give each one a
[1:44:09] blessing
[1:44:11] according to their lives and according
[1:44:12] to their
[1:44:14] you know who they are they've all got
[1:44:15] his bloodline in them
[1:44:17] but they're all called to something
[1:44:19] different
[1:44:20] just like you and i and he gets i love
[1:44:24] this one
[1:44:25] in verse 49 verse 5
[1:44:29] and he says simeon and levi are brethren
[1:44:32] instruments of cruel cruelty are in
[1:44:34] their habitations
[1:44:36] oh my soul come not in on thou unto
[1:44:38] their
[1:44:39] into their secret so there's a secret in
[1:44:42] them oh yeah
[1:44:44] unto their assembly might honor be now
[1:44:46] not united for in their anger they slew
[1:44:49] a man in their self-will they dig down a
[1:44:51] wall
[1:44:52] now the life behind
[1:44:57] the prophecy says you know
[1:45:00] it was reuben right reuben and simeon
[1:45:03] are reuben and levi
[1:45:05] simeone olivia levi says they killed
[1:45:08] somebody
[1:45:10] out of anger
[1:45:13] that was their nature that's who they
[1:45:15] were
[1:45:17] there's times maybe when you're in
[1:45:19] battle
[1:45:20] where anger is a good thing be angry and
[1:45:23] sin
[1:45:23] not that doesn't mean that means you
[1:45:26] should be angry against sin friends
[1:45:29] don't sin because of the anger but be
[1:45:32] angry against sin
[1:45:35] so there's places angry is being is good
[1:45:39] but watch how the life of that
[1:45:42] carried on because you flip over you
[1:45:45] know from genesis into exodus
[1:45:47] who do we find moses
[1:45:51] moses was the son of levite
[1:45:56] married to a woman that was a levite
[1:46:00] and when he decided it was time to take
[1:46:04] israel out and he should be the king
[1:46:06] what did he do
[1:46:08] he killed somebody
[1:46:11] amen because the life behind the life
[1:46:15] had now transferred from the prophecy
[1:46:18] into moses and he could
[1:46:20] only do what he did
[1:46:23] but there was a reason for it because
[1:46:26] that's not the only one he killed
[1:46:29] the life behind the life and they get
[1:46:32] out in the wilderness
[1:46:33] and what happens he was such a humble
[1:46:36] man
[1:46:37] i think there's a place that says he's
[1:46:38] the most humble man on earth
[1:46:40] of course he wrote the book but that
[1:46:43] that says that in
[1:46:44] but that aside
[1:46:48] what was this the life was
[1:46:51] it is in their anger they killed
[1:46:53] somebody and now they're in the
[1:46:55] wilderness
[1:46:55] and everybody is chiding with him moses
[1:46:58] you know
[1:46:59] can god give us this can he give us can
[1:47:01] he give us water
[1:47:03] unbelief and in anger what did he do
[1:47:08] he slays a man he smote
[1:47:12] the rock
[1:47:15] but not only once he smote it twice
[1:47:19] you know what brother branham said about
[1:47:20] that he said he shouldn't have done that
[1:47:22] amen he said because when he did that
[1:47:25] the life behind that anger
[1:47:28] will go all the way down through history
[1:47:30] and not only will israel reject him
[1:47:34] but the gentiles also will smite the
[1:47:37] rock
[1:47:38] the second time i
[1:47:41] indict this generation for the second
[1:47:43] crucifixion
[1:47:45] he said they'll never kill him naturally
[1:47:47] again they can't do it
[1:47:50] because he is king of kings and lord of
[1:47:52] lords
[1:47:54] and all life comes through jesus christ
[1:47:57] but he said they will kill the effects
[1:48:02] of this message
[1:48:05] where they crucified him
[1:48:09] what did it the life
[1:48:12] behind the life through levi and simeon
[1:48:16] through levi's line all the way down to
[1:48:19] moses
[1:48:21] and he killed the man he killed
[1:48:24] the man amen because pilate
[1:48:28] when he got ready he wanted to let him
[1:48:29] go what's the matter with you people
[1:48:31] you're all going crazy
[1:48:33] and you're saying crucify him he didn't
[1:48:35] do anything i want to let him go
[1:48:38] what should i do with him crucify him
[1:48:40] crucify him
[1:48:42] but i don't want to crucify him crucify
[1:48:44] him anyway
[1:48:48] and so he took him he had him whipped
[1:48:49] and when he brings him back the next
[1:48:50] time he says behold
[1:48:52] the man amen
[1:48:56] and what killed him the levitical
[1:49:00] priesthood amen
[1:49:03] because they were angry at what jesus
[1:49:07] did
[1:49:08] that's right because the life behind the
[1:49:10] life
[1:49:11] had gone all the way from genesis 49
[1:49:16] to the day they slowed him over calvary
[1:49:22] enough sufficiente for those in this by
[1:49:26] speaking do you understand it's a life
[1:49:29] behind the life
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:33] you know thinking about this deluge that
[1:49:36] we're under right now where
[1:49:37] the whole world's going crazy all of
[1:49:40] them
[1:49:41] you know there's a few countries a
[1:49:42] little less crazy than other countries
[1:49:44] for whatever reason but
[1:49:45] and states they're less crazy than other
[1:49:48] states but
[1:49:50] the only way you're going to get out of
[1:49:51] this world is to act crazier than the
[1:49:53] rest of the world
[1:49:55] to subdue the crazy people
[1:49:58] and you believe me if you you know
[1:50:00] somebody tells you to do something you
[1:50:02] said i'm not even going to do it
[1:50:04] they're going to think you're crazy
[1:50:07] because in their mind
[1:50:09] they have been anointed just drop this
[1:50:12] in
[1:50:12] you all know what brother branham said
[1:50:14] the hardest spirit he ever had to face
[1:50:16] in life
[1:50:18] religious but there was a certain way it
[1:50:20] came
[1:50:22] he said he was in the pulpit and it was
[1:50:25] a little flash
[1:50:26] and a flash and a flash and he said that
[1:50:29] spirit was so strong
[1:50:32] if he had not come if the pillar of fire
[1:50:35] had not come he said it would have
[1:50:36] knocked him out of the pulpit
[1:50:38] he said a man was trying to hypnotize
[1:50:40] him
[1:50:42] now 1957 we'll go back we're talking
[1:50:45] about our generation now
[1:50:47] 1957 they did a little experiment with
[1:50:49] the old reel-to-reel
[1:50:51] movies right every 50th frame
[1:50:55] goes by so fast you don't even see it in
[1:50:58] a movie theater
[1:51:00] they put a nice oh coca-cola man nice
[1:51:03] cold drippy thing you know
[1:51:09] one frame out of every 50 and within 15
[1:51:12] to 20 minutes
[1:51:14] everybody in the theater couldn't even
[1:51:16] see it
[1:51:18] everybody in the theater was getting up
[1:51:20] to go back and buy a coke
[1:51:23] i'm talking 1957.
[1:51:27] first time i ever noticed it
[1:51:30] and i don't claim to have a gift but god
[1:51:32] sometimes shows us things
[1:51:34] it was back under a presidential
[1:51:35] election probably 15 20 years ago
[1:51:37] whatever it was
[1:51:38] i heard a commercial i went
[1:51:42] they're hypnotizing people with that
[1:51:46] on the radio
[1:51:49] there was a subliminal voice and vote
[1:51:52] for so-and-so
[1:51:57] so what's the will of god in our day who
[1:52:00] spoke this just briefly at home
[1:52:02] a few weeks ago well we have one man who
[1:52:06] declares himself to be president
[1:52:08] and he has 50 men running in front of
[1:52:11] him saying he's the president he's the
[1:52:12] president
[1:52:14] but the prophet said goes to
[1:52:18] the woman that received the grace
[1:52:21] and said did you know what adam and i
[1:52:23] just doing
[1:52:26] david didn't even know about it because
[1:52:28] he says the king doesn't know about it
[1:52:30] he was still king he was still alive the
[1:52:32] life was still in him
[1:52:34] to be the king
[1:52:37] prophet says you go in and talk to him
[1:52:38] bathsheba and while you're there i will
[1:52:41] come and confirm your words
[1:52:44] and so she goes in she said hey did you
[1:52:47] know what ed and i just doing david
[1:52:48] didn't have a clue
[1:52:52] and he said well yeah i said that
[1:52:55] solomon would sit on the throne here
[1:52:58] comes nathan
[1:52:58] the word says lest
[1:53:02] your wife and solomon become like
[1:53:05] malfactors i don't think that's the
[1:53:07] right word used in the scripture there
[1:53:09] you can look it up i think it's first
[1:53:12] kings one
[1:53:15] he said but lest they become malfactors
[1:53:20] what are you gonna do david says get my
[1:53:23] get my beast
[1:53:26] the power in action go get the donkey
[1:53:29] bring the donkey and anoint him prophet
[1:53:32] anoint
[1:53:33] solomon king now we have a prophecy
[1:53:38] and you can find it several places
[1:53:41] from the message of william branham and
[1:53:43] he said there will be
[1:53:45] a roman catholic president and a woman
[1:53:47] that will rise to power in america
[1:53:49] amen so you look at that well is this
[1:53:52] the will of the lord
[1:53:54] did you know there's another place he
[1:53:56] said you better pray
[1:54:00] you better pray he says both sides are
[1:54:03] messed up
[1:54:04] but he said you better pray that your
[1:54:06] children will have freedom
[1:54:09] what's the will of the lord
[1:54:13] for our day amen
[1:54:18] what is it we know it's is it the will
[1:54:21] of the lord that it go that way
[1:54:24] or is the will of the lord praying for
[1:54:25] the bride of jesus christ
[1:54:28] and the peace to israel
[1:54:31] because the name solomon means
[1:54:34] peace and i don't know who read it to me
[1:54:38] but somebody read you know those things
[1:54:40] that come up on your phone
[1:54:41] israel is already saying that depending
[1:54:44] on who becomes president
[1:54:45] they could go to war with iran it
[1:54:48] doesn't sound like peace
[1:54:51] so what's the will of the lord what's
[1:54:53] our part amen
[1:54:55] do we just stand by and let it happen or
[1:54:58] do we pray
[1:54:59] or each one of you as individuals do you
[1:55:03] do i don't care who
[1:55:04] what your political politics is just one
[1:55:07] of the
[1:55:09] strands of the devil religion politics
[1:55:12] and money
[1:55:14] are the three st the threefold court not
[1:55:15] easily broken
[1:55:17] so you pray that the bride of jesus
[1:55:18] christ gets out of here without
[1:55:21] being male factors that's just my take
[1:55:24] brother paul may have something totally
[1:55:26] different brother dean heart
[1:55:28] you be praying amen that and if this is
[1:55:32] the hour that that's supposed to take
[1:55:33] place at least you prayed about it and
[1:55:35] tried to stop it
[1:55:38] amen david wept over the city jesus wept
[1:55:43] over the city
[1:55:47] drove him out but he was restored to the
[1:55:49] throne
[1:55:51] he went through his trials and he
[1:55:53] brought forth some
[1:55:54] beautiful word of god through that trial
[1:55:59] it may mean a trial for us or multiple
[1:56:01] trials
[1:56:02] but remember as i get ready to close
[1:56:05] that
[1:56:09] let me just drop this in before we get
[1:56:10] away from it there in
[1:56:12] genesis 49 how can i remember this i'll
[1:56:16] hold on to this
[1:56:17] because i want i got a thought over here
[1:56:19] we had to want to finish with but i got
[1:56:20] to feel it
[1:56:22] in genesis 49 the next one he goes to is
[1:56:26] judah
[1:56:27] and i know we spoke on this about a year
[1:56:29] or so ago judah thou art he whom now
[1:56:32] by thy brethren shall praise thy hand
[1:56:33] shall be in the neck of thy enemy the
[1:56:35] father's children shall bow down before
[1:56:36] thee
[1:56:37] judah is the lion's help from the pray
[1:56:41] my son thou art
[1:56:42] gone up he stooped down he couched as a
[1:56:45] lion and as an old lion who shall rouse
[1:56:47] him up
[1:56:48] what's that what's the life behind that
[1:56:51] prophecy
[1:56:53] there's a life behind the line of judah
[1:56:57] what line was david in judah
[1:57:01] so you see the life starting to
[1:57:03] intermingle going through time
[1:57:05] and he gives us the three comings of
[1:57:08] jesus christ in that one verse
[1:57:12] he's saying okay god is going to declare
[1:57:15] himself a king
[1:57:17] through judah as a lion's whelp
[1:57:22] jesus was the young lion on calvary it
[1:57:25] says i am compassed about by clown you
[1:57:27] know
[1:57:28] by these lions
[1:57:31] he was the young lion that was slain he
[1:57:33] became the prey
[1:57:34] but from the prey what did he do he went
[1:57:37] up
[1:57:38] amen he went all the way you know
[1:57:41] brother branham used to tell us the way
[1:57:42] down is up
[1:57:43] he went all the way to the pit of hell
[1:57:44] to preach to those people
[1:57:46] and then went up and then it says he
[1:57:49] couched as a lion
[1:57:51] that's talking about the rest people
[1:57:53] what's your rest
[1:57:55] to whom he has said this is the rest
[1:57:57] line up online line up online here a
[1:57:59] little there a little
[1:58:00] this is the rest what is it it's the
[1:58:04] couched lion
[1:58:05] the one that went up that sent back his
[1:58:07] holy spirit
[1:58:09] and he's just laying down to rest to
[1:58:11] watch what are we going to do with it
[1:58:14] what are we going to do with this rest
[1:58:16] and the last one is who shall rouse him
[1:58:18] up
[1:58:19] who roused the king
[1:58:24] you ever read the book of esther
[1:58:27] who roused the king
[1:58:32] wasn't heyman heyman was ready to kill
[1:58:34] them all
[1:58:36] but little esther the bride
[1:58:40] was willing to put her life in jeopardy
[1:58:45] to go before the king
[1:58:48] and say spare my children
[1:58:53] do we understand
[1:58:57] bathsheba had to intercede for her
[1:59:00] solomon her son and esther had to
[1:59:04] intercede to the king
[1:59:08] for the children of israel
[1:59:12] okay i said now i got this other thought
[1:59:15] out there to close with
[1:59:16] praise the lord i remembered this
[1:59:19] deluge that we're under and we
[1:59:23] oh it's the worst unbelief thing i've i
[1:59:25] never believed it would have gone like
[1:59:27] this
[1:59:28] just me personally i'm under the wire
[1:59:31] and out of sight
[1:59:34] who'd have thought it would come down to
[1:59:36] this and things that's going on
[1:59:38] do you think of other things that
[1:59:39] brother branham said when he you know he
[1:59:41] had that vision about the guys
[1:59:43] mix in the test tubes and when he cried
[1:59:45] out don't do it
[1:59:47] broke the vision
[1:59:52] was that what he saw i don't know
[1:59:56] but isn't it interesting what's happened
[1:59:58] since whatever was in those test tubes
[2:00:00] got out
[2:00:04] i don't know maybe it was something else
[2:00:07] but
[2:00:08] the stuff got out of the test tube
[2:00:10] however it got out whether it was
[2:00:11] deliberate
[2:00:13] active warfare or whether it was an
[2:00:14] accident we don't know
[2:00:17] he just said don't do it
[2:00:21] and now we see this deluge that we're
[2:00:22] under and oh it looks terrible
[2:00:25] sometimes i just lord what do i what am
[2:00:27] i going to do what am i supposed to
[2:00:28] what's my part what am i
[2:00:33] you guys does this affect you guys
[2:00:36] does your head ever just get to where
[2:00:37] you know that little emoji
[2:00:40] in there that you know when you're
[2:00:41] sending your text thing and the emoji
[2:00:43] with the person's head opened up and
[2:00:44] blowing up yeah that's
[2:00:46] that's me
[2:00:49] and because i don't know i don't know
[2:00:52] what to even tell you because you're
[2:00:54] all individuals you all have to have a
[2:00:56] personal experience with jesus christ
[2:00:58] my experience won't do it for you
[2:01:01] you must be born again you must be full
[2:01:04] of the holy ghost
[2:01:06] and if you're full of the holy ghost
[2:01:09] amen
[2:01:10] and the deluge in genesis i think it's
[2:01:12] the 11th chapter if i remember right
[2:01:15] uh no 20 nope that's jim
[2:01:19] genesis 7 and verse 11
[2:01:22] it says the fountains of the deep were
[2:01:24] opened up
[2:01:27] amen and noah who'd been sitting there
[2:01:31] you know just sitting around in the ark
[2:01:33] for seven days
[2:01:37] don't see no rain but lord this is what
[2:01:39] you told me to do
[2:01:41] just stay right here in the message
[2:01:45] no no rain yet but on that
[2:01:49] that day when the fountains began the
[2:01:52] deep began to open up
[2:01:54] amen amen did you know that brother
[2:01:57] brown said there would be 200
[2:01:59] 000 000 demons released against
[2:02:02] this message where did they come from
[2:02:06] from the deep friends and the water went
[2:02:09] up and the water came down
[2:02:15] but those that were sitting in the ark
[2:02:19] might have got a little scary for a
[2:02:21] little bit
[2:02:23] but the more it rained the more the
[2:02:25] water came down
[2:02:26] and the deep was going up the higher
[2:02:29] that ark got
[2:02:32] until one day it's just bobbing along
[2:02:34] like a cork
[2:02:36] because the rain stopped
[2:02:39] and when it got to its resting place
[2:02:42] what was there a covenant
[2:02:47] god said i'll not do that again and
[2:02:50] here's my covenant
[2:02:51] we have a covenant little bride of jesus

[2:12:19] you know saints say just a couple things

[2:12:23] really stirred my heart and i just want
[2:12:26] you i'm not i'm not gonna
[2:12:28] elaborate too much here but i want you
[2:12:29] to catch this
[2:12:31] here in just it might be months things
[2:12:35] pass quickly
[2:12:37] but just here in the recent past the
[2:12:39] governor
[2:12:40] very outspoken man governor of new york
[2:12:43] got up and declared to the world
[2:12:48] god didn't bring about this
[2:12:51] suppressing of the covet god had nothing
[2:12:54] to do with it
[2:12:56] we did it he made this declaration when
[2:12:59] the covet dropped in new york
[2:13:02] and there he stood up and boastfully
[2:13:04] said it had nothing to do with god
[2:13:07] we did it that's right and he brought
[2:13:10] about a judgment was not a righteous
[2:13:14] but a judgment because you see as it has
[2:13:17] been and this is where i won't elaborate
[2:13:19] all through this scripture every time
[2:13:20] man step forward saul this is what
[2:13:24] stirred my heart
[2:13:24] saul stepped into a position where he
[2:13:27] was god didn't do this
[2:13:28] i saw your king did this
[2:13:31] david almost went down that route
[2:13:37] but when you look at this and i'm i'm
[2:13:39] condensing this down but you look at
[2:13:40] this when samuel come to david and said
[2:13:43] here's a man with one sheep and here's a
[2:13:46] man with many
[2:13:47] but he come and took his one sheep
[2:13:51] look at the judgment the anointing that
[2:13:53] come on david
[2:13:55] it was not an unrighteous judgment he
[2:13:58] said that man should die
[2:14:00] and when samuel said david you are that
[2:14:03] man
[2:14:04] what is david didn't say well you have
[2:14:07] to understand the circumstance you need
[2:14:08] to understand this you need to
[2:14:09] understand that
[2:14:10] what did david do a righteous judgment
[2:14:13] he said oh god forgive me
[2:14:16] forgive me lord pray i have sinned
[2:14:20] amen i love that brother david
[2:14:25] bathsheba's life was
[2:14:28] all based on the righteous judgment
[2:14:32] of david amen when he said god
[2:14:35] forgive me oh aren't you glad today my
[2:14:38] brother and sister we're not lifted up
[2:14:40] in our own
[2:14:42] when the word comes and speaks to us

[2:14:49] righteous judgment and say oh lord
[2:14:51] forgive me
[2:14:52] lord forgive me why because this is the
[2:14:56] nature
[2:14:57] of the bride she's thankful she's
