[31:22] be
[31:24] amen how many believe
[31:28] praise the Lord you know that's not
[31:31] enough you know that
[31:34] right cuz Lord Jesus says even the
[31:37] demons believe and
[31:40] tremble so the difference
[31:43] is we have to believe but we have to
[31:46] take it as our own and put it to
[31:51] work because we can confess even the
[31:54] Bible says if we if we confess
[31:57] with our lips that Jesus is Christ the
[32:00] Lord but we not only have to confess it
[32:03] we have to believe it and we have to put
[32:06] it in our
[32:07] [Music]
[32:09] heart and
[32:12] then he going to bring
[32:16] fruit remember the parable of the Lord
[32:22] Jesus when this men went and start
[32:25] sowing seeds and fell in different
[32:28] grounds different
[32:30] soils some of them were
[32:34] Believers some of them were not
[32:36] Believers but some of them were True
[32:39] Believers that's a good soil cuz you
[32:43] take the promises of
[32:46] God and make make them your
[32:49] own Lord I
[32:54] believe you know I always I always I
[32:56] always say that sometimes we sing
[33:00] songs but but we sing them just because
[33:02] we like the melody or the
[33:05] Rhythm but we don't put our ear and our
[33:08] heart into the words that's
[33:12] right so we have to be
[33:15] conscious what are we saying what are we
[33:20] singing you know and the secular music
[33:24] uh we were talking to my wife this uh
[33:27] yesterday
[33:28] and the secular
[33:30] music is being a mess that's
[33:35] right and we remember I mean we I'm a
[33:38] Mexican as you notice
[33:41] already and and I remember back in in in
[33:44] the
[33:45] years the the countrymen used to bring
[33:48] serenades to the ladies but those songs
[33:52] were like poems to
[33:55] them I'm assuming back in the year here
[33:58] it was the same
[34:00] way but now the the the the the the
[34:03] letters the the words and the songs are
[34:08] garbage but you know what the saddest
[34:10] thing
[34:12] is that garbage came into the
[34:16] churches that's why we have to Be
[34:18] watchful that's right what are we
[34:21] listening that's right
[34:23] amen what kind of food we eat that's
[34:27] right yes
[34:31] sir anyway that was not my thought this
[34:36] morning you may be seated for a few
[34:38] minutes please
[34:41] um I believe you know the drill I I I I
[34:46] tell my family say if I'm going to work
[34:49] you're going to have to work
[34:51] too so uh they prepare a song for us
[34:56] this morning and uh I'm always happy to
[34:59] be here um and and a pleasure to be
[35:03] here even though I feel
[35:07] my my
[35:09] blood Rises and but you know what uh
[35:13] when you know that you're doing a work
[35:14] for God is it's worth the pressure it's
[35:18] worth the
[35:20] the nerves that come and but uh we just
[35:25] want to be a blessing for you this
[35:27] morning and I I would like you to uh
[35:30] enjoy the song
[35:32] [Music]
[35:42] [Music]
[36:07] while the world looks about me it's a
[36:11] strugle
[36:13] alone they say I have nothing but they
[36:19] are
[36:21] sorrow in my heart I'm
[36:24] rejoicing how I wish they to
[36:29] sing thank you Lord for your blessings

[39:18] the to the Book of
[39:24] Exodus 24
[39:43] 248 let's start with verse
[39:48] six it
[39:50] reads like
[39:53] this and Moses took half of the blood
[39:57] and put it in
[39:59] basins and half of the blood and
[40:01] sprinkler on the
[40:03] Altar and he took the book of the
[40:06] Covenant and
[40:08] read in the audience of the people and
[40:12] they said all that the Lord had said
[40:15] will we do and be
[40:20] obedient and Moses took the blood and
[40:23] sprinkled sprinkled it on the people and
[40:25] said behold the blood of the
[40:28] Covenant which the Lord had made with
[40:32] you concerning all these words amen let
[40:36] us pray Heavenly
[40:38] Father we all can do Lord is to read the
[40:42] Bible read the words that has
[40:45] been written there father we thank you
[40:48] for that opportunity and we ask you this
[40:52] morning that you can come and speak to
[40:56] us in a manner that we can understand
[40:59] father what you
[41:00] have we commit myself and these people
[41:04] into your hands Lord father we thank you
[41:08] for the opportunity and I ask you to
[41:11] help me to set aside myself so you can
[41:13] come and speak freely Lord in the name
[41:16] of the Lord Jesus we
[41:17] pray amen you may be seated re uh
[41:23] receive greetings from brothers and
[41:25] sisters and
[41:28] tric
[41:30] series um I've
[41:37] been as most of you
[41:41] know that we we had
[41:45] a an experience with our oldest son
[41:50] about having leukemia when he was a baby
[41:53] and since then we've been uh we've been
[41:56] blessed that God heal him we we all know
[41:59] that God uh was merciful with us and
[42:03] with him and and
[42:07] and I went and did did a little bit of
[42:10] uh I wouldn't call it research because a
[42:14] research I think is more deep but I I I
[42:17] just search a little bit about the blood
[42:20] and and
[42:23] uh reading the Bible if you go with me
[42:26] and and ver uh chapter 29 of Exodus as
[42:30] well
[42:33] um is
[42:35] is the blood
[42:37] is is so
[42:41] amazing and how the blood
[42:46] works it
[42:48] is I mean the science can Define
[42:53] it they can they can have a glimpse of
[42:57] the the the how the body
[43:00] works and that's what they sometimes
[43:04] they they do good things they they know
[43:07] what to treat but sometimes they just
[43:10] say I'm sorry I don't
[43:14] know and that tells
[43:17] me that the only one who
[43:20] can cure is God because he is the one
[43:23] who design
[43:25] amen that's right
[43:27] I don't know if I told you this before
[43:29] here but I always bring this down
[43:33] to uh we all know cars so there was a
[43:38] young man driving a
[43:40] car and all of a sudden the car
[43:45] broke and he was in the the highway and
[43:49] then the hood was up and she was
[43:53] scratching his head looking at him and
[43:55] try try and didn't start and then all of
[43:59] a sudden another car pulled in and and
[44:02] and an old man with with the suit came
[44:05] down and say what's what happened kid he
[44:08] said I I don't know this car doesn't
[44:10] want to run I say can I take a look on
[44:13] it and he said well I don't know how
[44:18] much mechanic you are cuz you're in ass
[44:20] suit
[44:21] and oh let's let us let me try then the
[44:25] old man went and moved move some wires
[44:28] and and he said okay give it a try the
[44:31] guy started and the car
[44:34] runs and he was very thankful and say
[44:38] Lord what's uh sir what's your name
[44:41] thank you very much he said I'm Henry
[44:46] Ford so who designed the
[44:50] car I mean it's it's the same way God
[44:53] works that's
[44:55] right in some that he
[44:59] designed so let's let's read verse 21
[45:03] there and thou shalt take of the blood
[45:07] of that is upon the
[45:09] Altar and of the anointing oil and is
[45:13] sprinkled it up upon apron upon Aaron
[45:17] and upon his garments and upon his sons
[45:21] and upon the garments of his sons with
[45:23] him and he shall be hollowed and his
[45:27] garments and his sons and his son Sons
[45:30] garments with him with
[45:33] him you know Moses is talking about
[45:38] Covenant and he is sprinkling the
[45:42] blood and and if we go back to Genesis
[45:47] we we know
[45:48] that when Adam and Eve
[45:52] seen what had to
[45:55] happen blood had to be
[45:58] shed to cover amen their sins amen
[46:03] that's right so
[46:05] God from the
[46:07] beginning he was sending a message to
[46:11] the Future
[46:12] Generations about
[46:14] [Music]
[46:16] blood
[46:18] so a covenant is a binding obligation
[46:23] yes it is in the in the word in the
[46:25] English word a covenant comes from a
[46:27] Latin word is is called
[46:31] convenient which means come together or
[46:34] come to an
[46:37] agreement but in the scriptures is the
[46:42] ultimate expression of committed love
[46:46] that's right and trust and it was
[46:49] usually made to to
[46:52] Define to confirm to establish or make
[46:56] by in a relationship amen that had
[47:01] beginning the making of some time a
[47:04] covenant is abiding unbreakable
[47:07] obligation between two parties based on
[47:10] unconditional love seal by Blood and
[47:15] secret oath yes that creates
[47:18] relationship in which each party is
[47:21] bound by a specific undertakings of each
[47:24] other's behalf amen
[47:27] the parties of the Covenant Place them
[47:29] under the penalty of divine retribution
[47:32] should they later attempt to avoid those
[47:37] undertakings it is a relationship that
[47:40] can only be broken by death that's right
[47:45] amen so that that's how serious God was
[47:49] when he made this
[47:51] Covenant yeah he didn't plan on Breaking
[47:53] the Covenant with Humanity
[47:57] when he he when he made a a pledge or or
[48:01] a promise or or or a a
[48:05] covenant he didn't do it thinking that
[48:09] maybe down the road he's going to break
[48:10] it and and start another cant with
[48:13] someone else no that's right the reason
[48:15] we got separated from God is because we
[48:17] broke that's right the humanity broke
[48:20] the Covenant that's
[48:22] right but God was still there that's
[48:25] right I mean Adam and
[48:28] Eve got separated from the fellowship
[48:32] amen with God because of the
[48:37] sin but God
[48:39] never pull him away
[48:43] amen God went down and looked for them
[48:47] that's right that's what he went and
[48:48] says Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's
[48:51] right and and I know many times and many
[48:55] preachers have heard have said this but
[48:57] God knew where Adam
[48:59] was
[49:01] right now the question
[49:04] remains where are we that's right that's
[49:08] it that's right
[49:11] because God is still wants to keep that
[49:14] Covenant with you yes sir yes
[49:17] sir and the only way to do it
[49:20] is through the blood of Jesus
[49:23] Christ that's right
[49:27] you
[49:31] know I hope you had breakfast this
[49:34] morning I know we don't have service
[49:37] this afternoon so I might I'm just
[49:40] kidding
[49:41] but he says in the human body there are
[49:44] many different kinds of
[49:47] tissues we Define them as muscle nerve
[49:50] fat gland
[49:51] bone and all these tissues are connected
[49:57] and they have one thing in
[50:00] common yes sir they are fixed
[50:02] cells
[50:05] microscopically small and having a
[50:07] specific and
[50:08] limitation
[50:10] function unlike those fixed cells the
[50:14] blood is a
[50:16] fluid and
[50:19] mobile that is it is not limited to one
[50:23] part of the body that's right so it
[50:25] doesn't matter if you if you your head
[50:27] you're going to bleed right you cut your
[50:29] toe you're going to bleed that's right
[50:32] so see see the importance of the blood I
[50:35] mean you have fingers in this
[50:38] hand but you don't have in your
[50:44] back amen but you have blood here and
[50:47] you have blood here that's right you
[50:49] have blood here so
[50:52] that's to me like I say I
[50:57] when they say your son has leukemia is
[50:59] is cancer in in the
[51:01] blood in other words the blood is
[51:08] contaminated and this this was very
[51:11] interesting to me
[51:13] because that
[51:16] explains the importance in the blood and
[51:18] human
[51:20] body because the blood of
[51:23] Jesus was the only one who was able
[51:27] to clean amen you know remember John
[51:30] says Behold the Lamb of God that's right
[51:34] who take it away the sin of the world
[51:37] right yes it didn't cover it right it
[51:41] took it
[51:45] away the blood is the fluid and mobile
[51:47] it
[51:51] says that runs free to move through the
[51:55] entire body and
[51:57] Supply and to fix the cells with
[52:00] nourishment and carry off the waste
[52:07] products it
[52:10] says an average
[52:14] 20 I'm sorry it's a process which we all
[52:17] call metabolism in the normal human body
[52:20] there are about five quarts of this
[52:22] fluid and this blood pumped by the heart
[52:26] circulates throughout the system about
[52:29] every 23 seconds so that every cell in
[52:33] the body is constantly Supply and
[52:35] cleanse and at the same time it is
[52:38] constant
[52:40] communication with every other cell in
[52:42] the
[52:43] body this blood is the most mysterious
[52:46] of the of all tissues being composed of
[52:50] scores of elements and compounds and
[52:53] strange chemicals bodies which whose fun
[52:56] function is not yet fully
[52:59] understood but which all of which have
[53:02] to do with the mystery of life that's it
[53:06] for the life is in the blood that's
[53:09] righten once the blood fails to reach
[53:12] the cells and members of the body they
[53:15] probably die and no man ever dies until
[53:19] his blood cease to
[53:21] circulate this life is in the
[53:25] blood and book of Acts 17:26 says and he
[53:29] has made from one blood every nation of
[53:33] men to dwell on all the face of the
[53:37] Earth and has determined their
[53:40] pre-appointment
[53:41] times and the boundaries of their
[53:45] dwellings yeah so by one blood that's
[53:49] it and brother Bram says
[53:54] that oh this brother got God beat me
[53:57] here we got the
[54:03] quote it says notice then that the blood
[54:06] came down and it was Christ Jesus amen
[54:10] and God himself coming out of the spirit
[54:13] went into Christ Jesus that's right and
[54:15] the bible say that God was in Christ
[54:18] reconciling the
[54:20] world to make to make a k
[54:24] Kinsman is that right God himself
[54:26] Jehovah lived in Christ and was made a
[54:30] Kinsman to us because he was born in
[54:33] human flesh like we are is that right
[54:36] the blood cells were developed by God
[54:38] and the flesh
[54:40] cells the flesh cells were developed in
[54:44] the womb of Mary that brought forth the
[54:47] child and God came down and lived in
[54:49] human flesh and he was tempted in every
[54:54] manner just like we are
[54:57] so if you think you're going through a
[54:59] rough time right right you're not the
[55:02] only one
[55:03] yeah CU he set example for us that's
[55:07] right and he and he did it for
[55:12] love that's right amen he did it because
[55:15] he saw
[55:16] you and this dying age
[55:21] amen that you were going to be in
[55:24] struggling
[55:27] that's why he did
[55:31] it the blood
[55:35] cells he he brought forth the child and
[55:38] God came down and lived in human flesh
[55:40] and was tempted in every manner just
[55:42] like we are do you believe that now when
[55:47] he did that he freely gave his blood he
[55:50] didn't have to do it he made it that he
[55:53] made that
[55:54] sacrifice he could have went right up
[55:57] into Glory he could have been
[56:00] transfigured like he was in the mountain
[56:03] Transfiguration went unto heaven and
[56:06] never died for us but to be willing to
[56:09] die for us he gave freely his blood at
[56:12] Calvary amen you Lord is that
[56:15] right and he picked out he was a man of
[56:22] sorrow it was he he he didn't choose the
[56:25] easy route
[56:29] because of the love yeah that he had for
[56:32] you and me amen because the moment that
[56:36] he Ste into into this
[56:40] realm he knew what what was coming to
[56:44] him amen he he he chose his
[56:48] disciples knowing what was going to
[56:50] happen knowing who was going to betray
[56:53] him but he still chose chose
[56:58] Judas but you know what every single
[57:01] brother BR says that every son or
[57:03] daughter of God has to go to a test
[57:07] yeah because God wants us to put in in
[57:09] in a position where we where we are
[57:13] useful tools in his
[57:15] hands
[57:18] amen because God can use a baby
[57:26] what can a baby
[57:28] do you have to take care of
[57:32] him well but God you know many times and
[57:36] it's a sad a sad thing to say but many
[57:40] times I
[57:43] heard Christian
[57:46] say oh I'm a I'm in the process every
[57:50] time you uh try to correct them oh it's
[57:54] because I'm in a process
[57:56] yeah but this process is being stock
[57:59] there I mean it's there's there's no
[58:01] progress in the process that's right so
[58:04] a process is a progress too amen and
[58:08] many times we we we just get that
[58:11] covered and say oh I'm in a process I'm
[58:13] a I'm a human being and uh I made
[58:16] mistakes yes but you don't get to make
[58:18] the same mistakes over and over and
[58:20] over if you want to
[58:22] grow in Christ
[58:26] I know we're going to make mistakes I I
[58:28] make mistakes daily
[58:30] but I try not
[58:34] to let me ask you this you make the same
[58:36] mistake with your wife what's going to
[58:38] happen you're in trouble or vice
[58:43] versa it's the same thing with
[58:46] God God give
[58:49] him the the children of Israel and
[58:52] remember the scripture says the people
[58:54] said to Moses every that you say that is
[58:57] you read in the we're going to obey
[59:00] right they say we're going to obey
[59:04] right but it's easy to say and it's uh
[59:08] harder to do
[59:10] amen but for that
[59:15] reason we have
[59:17] to lean more to
[59:21] God because we
[59:24] cannot overcome
[59:27] this
[59:28] world without Christ
[59:32] amen he said he he he
[59:36] said that he overcame the
[59:40] world so we
[59:43] must this not a maybe we must
[59:48] overcome as
[59:50] well because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:00] come and
[1:00:02] cleans and takes away the
[1:00:06] desire it cleans
[1:00:09] you brother Brandon says that the the
[1:00:11] the the people they got so used to bring
[1:00:15] goats and and and Cs and and and and
[1:00:18] turtle
[1:00:19] dos that they took that promised light
[1:00:23] so light that they oh I messed up yeah
[1:00:26] but next year I'll bring a father
[1:00:30] cough or a father lamb to impress the
[1:00:34] priest but guess
[1:00:38] what some of this those priests were
[1:00:41] crooked that's
[1:00:43] right so that's why you don't trust
[1:00:47] man you trust God right he's the one who
[1:00:51] gave his life for
[1:00:54] youen I
[1:00:57] I mean if I tell you how many times I've
[1:00:59] been let down by man
[1:01:04] ministers but you know what I
[1:01:06] learned you don't fall in love with the
[1:01:08] man that's right amen that's it amen you
[1:01:11] fall in love with the spirit that is in
[1:01:14] the
[1:01:17] man because if that spirit is from God
[1:01:20] he's not going to let you down that's
[1:01:23] right you know for for many people
[1:01:26] Moses let down many people yes
[1:01:30] sir oh you promis this and this and this
[1:01:33] and
[1:01:35] this it wasn't up to Moses
[1:01:38] No Moses was doing his
[1:01:42] part but you know what we we we as human
[1:01:45] beings we want everything so
[1:01:47] easy talking to brother Paul this
[1:01:49] morning there there's people that they
[1:01:52] they just like to hand the hand out and
[1:01:54] you have money for me
[1:01:59] how many people are out
[1:02:03] there because we want an easy life
[1:02:06] that's
[1:02:09] it but life is not easy no and if you
[1:02:13] became Christians to have an easy life
[1:02:15] sorry
[1:02:16] to be a bear of bad
[1:02:20] news it's no easy life being a Christian
[1:02:23] no it is as Paul that's right
[1:02:27] right well you can ask brother Paul too
[1:02:29] but Paul John Peter Luke right it's it's
[1:02:34] not an easy job it's it's it's a hard
[1:02:35] journey amen
[1:02:39] amen we have to understand that God
[1:02:42] called us to work that's
[1:02:47] right he didn't call us to a picnic oh
[1:02:51] that's
[1:02:52] right we we have to understand that part
[1:02:57] because we cannot
[1:03:00] be a light
[1:03:03] Christian it's okay to try to be on a
[1:03:07] lightweight but when it comes
[1:03:10] to fullness of God and gospel and and
[1:03:14] the spirit we we have to get as much as
[1:03:16] we can and the only way to get that is
[1:03:20] to be connected Amen to the
[1:03:24] source not what the source is Christ
[1:03:29] himself he he he promised I'm not I'm
[1:03:31] not going to leave you
[1:03:35] alone even though you think you're
[1:03:40] alone even though you feel alone that's
[1:03:43] it we're not alone that's
[1:03:46] right but even even in those darkest
[1:03:50] moments in your life when you think
[1:03:52] you're struggling alone
[1:03:56] that's when the
[1:03:59] enemy tries to talk to
[1:04:04] you see what you've been doing all these
[1:04:09] years 20 years 30 years five years I
[1:04:12] don't
[1:04:14] know waste of time you should have been
[1:04:17] having
[1:04:20] fun oh I had that those conversations I
[1:04:23] don't know if I'm the only one but I I
[1:04:26] had those talks in my
[1:04:29] ear but you know what when I when I when
[1:04:32] I look back and I
[1:04:36] look this the kind of life that people
[1:04:40] in my generation live without
[1:04:45] God and then I see
[1:04:49] myself I
[1:04:52] say thank you Lord for this opportunity
[1:04:58] because even though I'm not the
[1:05:00] Christian that I would like to
[1:05:04] be
[1:05:06] but I'm not the worst Christian
[1:05:12] either we're we're in a process
[1:05:17] right what they say work work in
[1:05:20] progress that's right
[1:05:23] is is interesting how
[1:05:29] how for everything the blood
[1:05:33] means a lot even in the animal
[1:05:38] kingdom when when when the
[1:05:40] Lambs have babies the
[1:05:45] Sheep many of them are
[1:05:48] vulnerable and many of the moms die
[1:05:51] that's right and many of the babies die
[1:05:54] too so they they ended up having
[1:05:58] orphans babies with no mothers and
[1:06:01] mothers without babies so the
[1:06:05] shepherd tries to bring the orphan to
[1:06:08] one of the the moms and she
[1:06:15] reject she doesn't want
[1:06:17] him so the only
[1:06:20] way that the shepherd makes this mother
[1:06:24] to like the other the baby he has to
[1:06:28] be
[1:06:30] vigilant and when he Sayes the baby
[1:06:33] dies he cuts his throat and the blood
[1:06:37] goes into the back of the
[1:06:41] orphan so when the mother smells the
[1:06:44] blood of the her
[1:06:46] son that's what
[1:06:48] she says welcome
[1:06:52] hallelujah what does it tell you
[1:06:55] amen if we don't have the blood of
[1:06:58] Christ amen applied to us amen we
[1:07:03] rejected that's righten brother BR says
[1:07:07] that that when God sees
[1:07:11] down he ises the blood of
[1:07:13] Christ that's why we to have mercy
[1:07:18] amen even though we're a mess we messed
[1:07:21] up here we messed up there God sees the
[1:07:25] blood up the lamb amen amen hallelujah
[1:07:28] and
[1:07:30] his enemy is so
[1:07:33] busy trying
[1:07:35] to let us know how mess we
[1:07:40] are don't you think I
[1:07:42] know right amen but he's always trying
[1:07:46] to bring you down
[1:07:49] amen and and if we allow him to take
[1:07:52] control of us that's it
[1:07:55] we're lost that's it but we have to
[1:07:59] remember that that that that we're not
[1:08:03] holy because of our of our own merits or
[1:08:07] works that's
[1:08:09] right we Are Holy because the holies of
[1:08:12] holy came down that's
[1:08:16] it that's what brother says the mountain
[1:08:19] wasn't holy it was the Holy in the
[1:08:23] mountain it's the same way today we are
[1:08:25] not holy is the holy in US amen amen
[1:08:31] amen remember Paul writing letters to
[1:08:35] the
[1:08:37] Saints the Corinthians the
[1:08:42] Galatians he was calling them saints
[1:08:45] right
[1:08:49] yes because
[1:08:53] God was manifested through them amen
[1:08:59] amen that's that's the importance of the
[1:09:02] blood or the power of the blood amen I
[1:09:05] mean even in
[1:09:07] in
[1:09:10] if if the blood has a lot of importance
[1:09:14] on this Animal Kingdom how much more the
[1:09:18] blood of Jesus Christ in the humanity
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:24] amen we you have to understand
[1:09:27] that that when when God sent his
[1:09:36] son he did it
[1:09:40] because he didn't want to lose
[1:09:44] Fellowship he knew that the fellowship
[1:09:47] was cut at the beginning and
[1:09:51] in in the Garden of Eden
[1:09:56] but he knew that that wasn't the end of
[1:10:01] it and we heard many times brother Brown
[1:10:03] says God wanted to display all his
[1:10:07] attributes that's
[1:10:10] right he had to
[1:10:12] be a
[1:10:14] way how God was going to manifest his
[1:10:18] attributes to begin with in order to be
[1:10:21] a god it has to be someone to adore him
[1:10:24] to pray praise
[1:10:28] him to be a Healer someone had to be
[1:10:31] sick
[1:10:33] right to be a
[1:10:38] savior how can he
[1:10:41] save a saved
[1:10:46] person that's what Jesus
[1:10:49] said the heal don't need doctors that's
[1:10:53] right if you have G help why you go to
[1:10:56] visit a
[1:10:57] doctor we last week or we went to a
[1:11:00] doctor dentist and and the nurse
[1:11:04] says are you happy to be
[1:11:07] here and Joe says
[1:11:10] yeah and she says nah nobody happy to
[1:11:14] see
[1:11:16] us and that's true that's the last place
[1:11:18] you want to go
[1:11:29] in
[1:11:32] Hebrews
[1:11:41] 913 it says for if the blood of bulls
[1:11:45] and goats and these ashes of Aer
[1:11:49] sprinkle in the
[1:11:51] unclean sanctifies for the purifying of
[1:11:55] of the flesh how much more shall the
[1:11:57] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[1:12:00] spirit offer himself without spot to God
[1:12:06] cleanse your conscience from dead
[1:12:09] Works to serve the Living
[1:12:16] God I don't know about you but I can see
[1:12:19] myself there yes sir the blood is to
[1:12:24] come un clean
[1:12:28] me that's what I was saying earlier we
[1:12:31] have to know what kind of words we're
[1:12:34] saying what kind of songs we
[1:12:40] sing because the songs are
[1:12:44] messages yes
[1:12:46] sir and those
[1:12:50] words can become reality in your
[1:12:54] life there's a song says oh yes oh yes
[1:12:59] I'm a son of the king how many times we
[1:13:02] sing that
[1:13:05] song and we walk out of the church
[1:13:12] defeated amen did didn't wasn't you
[1:13:16] saying that you're a son of a king
[1:13:18] that's right
[1:13:22] right we we have
[1:13:28] to make
[1:13:30] conscience
[1:13:34] amen because we can
[1:13:36] become a comfortable Christian
[1:13:42] yeah and
[1:13:44] when and when the boat cheeks a little
[1:13:47] bit we don't like it
[1:13:50] right so God told Moses what to do
[1:13:57] Moses did
[1:13:58] it Moses did his
[1:14:03] part but the people not all of them did
[1:14:07] their
[1:14:11] part and I I always
[1:14:14] think and I would like to ask Moses how
[1:14:17] do you handle
[1:14:20] it two million people
[1:14:25] back then they didn't have
[1:14:29] WhatsApp so he had to
[1:14:32] yell God says
[1:14:38] this and when he finished his
[1:14:42] statement I can imagine Moses going to
[1:14:45] his stand and sit down try to recover
[1:14:48] his
[1:14:50] throat and then Jo Joshua Moses Moses
[1:14:55] sister so and so he she wants to talk to
[1:14:59] you brother so and so wants to talk to
[1:15:02] you and there's Moses coming up and say
[1:15:05] yes how can I help
[1:15:08] you
[1:15:09] well what we going to eat
[1:15:15] tomorrow there's no
[1:15:18] water didn't I just say what God told me
[1:15:21] what to do and I just delivered the
[1:15:23] message yes yeah
[1:15:26] Hallelujah I think that's what the
[1:15:28] saying came don't shoot the
[1:15:32] messenger Moses was only the
[1:15:35] messenger and the people coming back to
[1:15:39] him you
[1:15:41] know years ago I I never been a pastor
[1:15:45] but I and I don't want
[1:15:47] to but I've been close to good friends
[1:15:50] that are pastors and and one time there
[1:15:53] was this couple
[1:15:55] like pretty much every week was brother
[1:15:58] I have this and this problem if it
[1:16:00] wasn't him was was her the wife of the
[1:16:05] husband and the brother gave him the
[1:16:09] advice oh okay brother thank
[1:16:12] you the following week the same
[1:16:16] thing sister you did what I told you oh
[1:16:20] um no but brother is there another
[1:16:26] if the problem
[1:16:29] persist
[1:16:30] the the advice is the same until you do
[1:16:33] do some changes in your
[1:16:36] life that's what I was saying you cannot
[1:16:39] be a baby all years that's
[1:16:44] right you you born a baby then you you
[1:16:49] become a toddler am I
[1:16:53] right and then a kid and then
[1:16:56] a a young I mean you know
[1:17:01] the in a Christian Life is the same way
[1:17:05] that's what that's why Paul was saying
[1:17:07] you cannot live out out of milk only
[1:17:11] that's right
[1:17:14] yeah you have to give in meat that's
[1:17:17] right how many like meat here
[1:17:23] amen I was telling brother Paul that
[1:17:27] is his fault that I like steaks now I
[1:17:31] say I was I was fine CH with carneada
[1:17:34] you know the
[1:17:37] skinny and then I hang out with some
[1:17:39] white guys and they taught me how to eat
[1:17:44] and I just can't get rid of it now it's
[1:17:51] contagious but
[1:17:59] it
[1:18:01] says the whole Plan of Redemption rest
[1:18:04] upon the power of the blood of the Lord
[1:18:05] Jesus Christ yes sir the blood is the
[1:18:08] only tissue that is unlimited and it
[1:18:11] moves within the body almost all the
[1:18:14] tissues are fixed such as muscle bone
[1:18:16] nerve
[1:18:17] Etc the blood alone is the only liquid
[1:18:20] tissue that can reach every single cell
[1:18:23] in the body and therefore all the
[1:18:26] members with the head and individual
[1:18:29] member as well now the blood has the
[1:18:32] blood has red cells that travels through
[1:18:35] the lungs come in contact with oxygen in
[1:18:38] the air we breathe and unite Loosely
[1:18:42] within the form o oxy globin you know
[1:18:47] what I'm trying to say in that form they
[1:18:50] treat it to all cells and they discharge
[1:18:54] the little cargo to the cell thus
[1:18:56] providing with the vital oxygen for
[1:18:59] combust combustion and
[1:19:02] Heat last time I was here there was a
[1:19:05] sister was a doctor is she here
[1:19:07] today okay well she can correct me later
[1:19:10] but then the blood picks up the waste
[1:19:13] products of the tissue the carbon Dio
[1:19:16] dioxide and the waste of the tissue
[1:19:20] metabolism that we may call the cell
[1:19:23] garbage but but there are also white
[1:19:28] cells those are standing army when an
[1:19:31] infection occurs anywhere in the body
[1:19:35] see see see the this is the interesting
[1:19:37] part I was saying you cut your head all
[1:19:40] this army goes to that wound you cut
[1:19:43] your toe all the Army Goes Down to the
[1:19:45] wound see the interesting of the
[1:19:49] blood it's it's is amazing how God
[1:19:52] designs the body to to cure himself yes
[1:19:57] sir oh but the the science is more
[1:20:00] intelligent than God you have to avoid
[1:20:02] this avoid that and do this and do
[1:20:05] this yeah
[1:20:09] right so this is the our standing army
[1:20:13] when an infection occurs anywhere in the
[1:20:15] body and the body is
[1:20:18] attacked you know when the enemy comes
[1:20:20] to attack you what is that's what I'm
[1:20:22] saying when God sees down what is he
[1:20:24] seeing
[1:20:26] is the blood
[1:20:29] amen isn't that amazing what what you
[1:20:33] have to do to have that such protection
[1:20:40] nothing what the teeth on the
[1:20:44] cross had to
[1:20:48] do this is marvelous yes remember me yes
[1:20:55] yeah he didn't have to do any anything
[1:20:57] else I mean he was hang hanging on the
[1:20:59] cross he didn't have time to go to water
[1:21:02] baptism
[1:21:03] yeah he didn't have time to go and
[1:21:06] return all that that he stole from
[1:21:09] people or whatever he did I don't know
[1:21:10] what he
[1:21:14] did what was his
[1:21:17] reward eternal
[1:21:20] life what was the reward of Moses
[1:21:25] eternal life
[1:21:27] amen see the burden of Moses had to Bear
[1:21:31] yeah right yeah and he this other guy
[1:21:37] here isn't not it strange how God works
[1:21:40] it is kind of unfair isn't
[1:21:42] it you you see that with a human eyes
[1:21:44] and say God you're you're not playing
[1:21:46] Fair
[1:21:48] here it's not up to you and me that's
[1:21:52] right that's right it's not how good you
[1:21:57] are
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:08] amen it says the wise Hells are little
[1:22:12] soldiers that fight the germs and
[1:22:14] millions of these soldiers are killed
[1:22:17] and are Gather in one place where they
[1:22:20] form what is commonly known as
[1:22:23] pus when the dead in a form of pus has
[1:22:26] been spelled the blood and the other
[1:22:28] white cells come in and clean up the
[1:22:30] bottle F that's right and build a new
[1:22:35] tissue until all is healed amen
[1:22:41] hallelujah I mean I I I believe me I
[1:22:45] read this many many
[1:22:47] times and every time I go through it
[1:22:50] amazes me
[1:22:53] amen because I'm not I'm not I'm I'm not
[1:22:55] only talking about the the human
[1:22:59] flesh the the the capabilities of the
[1:23:02] human flesh can do in your
[1:23:04] body imagine the blood of Jesus
[1:23:08] Christ how much can
[1:23:13] do that's why this teeth from the cross
[1:23:18] had to do
[1:23:20] anything I mean your blood works in your
[1:23:23] body
[1:23:25] but the blood of Jesus Christ Works in
[1:23:30] everybody that's right I mean if you can
[1:23:33] retain all what I'm saying today because
[1:23:34] I'm probably not either but just take
[1:23:37] that part with you amen that's right
[1:23:39] don't let go the significance of the
[1:23:42] blood of Jesus Christ in your life
[1:23:45] that's amen that's right Hallelujah the
[1:23:49] same way the blood of our Lord Jesus
[1:23:50] Christ does for each and every believer
[1:23:54] in time of trouble that's right
[1:23:57] Revelations 12 says verse 10 then I
[1:24:00] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:24:03] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:24:07] of our God and the power of His Christ
[1:24:11] have come for the accuser of a brother
[1:24:16] who accused them before our God day and
[1:24:20] night has been cast down
[1:24:25] see that's what I was
[1:24:27] saying the enemy is always worried about
[1:24:32] not let you forget how bad guy you are
[1:24:35] how bad lady you
[1:24:38] are we know
[1:24:40] that born in sin shaping
[1:24:44] iniquity do you do you think Satan I'm
[1:24:46] going to forget that
[1:24:49] no every time I look in the
[1:24:53] mirror you know but God's
[1:24:56] grace he doesn't see me the way I see
[1:24:59] myself that's
[1:25:02] right he is a complete amen work amen
[1:25:08] right that's what God sees you that's
[1:25:12] how how he see you
[1:25:21] amen sometimes Satan comes and points
[1:25:24] out our sins and failures and make us
[1:25:26] see our shortcomings the sins of Flesh
[1:25:29] we been there's no doubt to make us
[1:25:32] doubt of our
[1:25:34] Salvation how can I overcome
[1:25:37] this this
[1:25:40] infection I see no good in myself and I
[1:25:43] have no confidence in myself that's it
[1:25:46] in my flesh that's right amen but I
[1:25:51] look to Calvary that's right I pled the
[1:25:55] blood that was shed for me and that
[1:25:58] light breaks through all
[1:26:01] depends on his blood amen
[1:26:06] amen so that blood fight it sends the
[1:26:09] Army and those white cells in the blood
[1:26:12] of Christ which puts the enemy to flight
[1:26:17] i i i acknowledge my sin I do not deny
[1:26:22] it then I claim the promise
[1:26:25] amen we we we we have to recognize we
[1:26:29] we're that's exactly right I messed upop
[1:26:32] Lord you know that was do you know that
[1:26:35] that was the difference between David
[1:26:37] and Saul yes when the prophet came to
[1:26:41] Saul and says you messed
[1:26:44] up what was his
[1:26:46] reaction look for excuses that's right
[1:26:50] oh we're so good for
[1:26:51] that you must stop here yes yes but but
[1:26:54] I did it because of this and
[1:26:56] that no right your pride arrogant that's
[1:27:02] it that's what it
[1:27:06] is but when the the prophet came to
[1:27:10] David he broke that's it that's right he
[1:27:14] torn his
[1:27:17] garments and he cried to the Lord that's
[1:27:23] right that's what I always tell my wife
[1:27:25] when we got into some kind of situation
[1:27:27] is say it's it's okay to cry but we
[1:27:31] don't cry to the
[1:27:33] circumstance
[1:27:38] right what good does
[1:27:43] it that that doesn't change the
[1:27:46] circumstance
[1:27:50] remains but would you cry to God Amen
[1:27:54] that's
[1:27:56] it that's a big difference that's right
[1:27:59] that's right what what what what what uh
[1:28:02] what happened
[1:28:03] to Hezekiah
[1:28:06] was Isaiah came says get your house in
[1:28:10] order you're going to
[1:28:14] die he was a prophet God spoke to him go
[1:28:18] tell
[1:28:22] him he did his job in
[1:28:25] he was
[1:28:27] leaving and then God say
[1:28:30] wait go give him another
[1:28:36] message wait
[1:28:38] what what what did you say
[1:28:41] Lord see the strange ways God
[1:28:45] works so that's why you you when you you
[1:28:48] when you're encountering a a bad
[1:28:51] situation in
[1:28:52] life don't think that that situation is
[1:28:54] going to be there forever right that's
[1:28:56] right cuz you're not going to be there
[1:28:58] forever either that's
[1:29:01] right
[1:29:03] Hallelujah so we have to learn how to
[1:29:05] trust in God Amen
[1:29:10] exactly so he came back and say he
[1:29:13] said uh what do you want me to tell him
[1:29:18] he said I saw his
[1:29:23] cry I saw how he humbled himself before
[1:29:28] me doesn't the Bible says that
[1:29:32] God exalt the ones who humble themselves
[1:29:35] yes sir amen and what happened to the
[1:29:37] pride ones
[1:29:42] amen how many Pride people are out
[1:29:48] there right you know sometimes sometimes
[1:29:51] we act prideful yeah and it's part of
[1:29:55] the human
[1:29:57] being but there is a a right way and a
[1:30:00] wrong
[1:30:01] way you know when I see my my son here
[1:30:03] playing I feel
[1:30:06] Pride because he's he's he's doing it
[1:30:08] for God he's not doing it for
[1:30:15] me I know I can play like
[1:30:17] him and I'm not going to be able to play
[1:30:20] cuz
[1:30:22] I'm getting older enough
[1:30:24] older and we get busier and busier in
[1:30:26] some other
[1:30:28] things you know what I don't know if I
[1:30:30] told you this before but I I went for
[1:30:33] four months I went to guitar class in
[1:30:37] Mexico
[1:30:39] and I wanted to be a guitar player or
[1:30:42] not for the world but to play in church
[1:30:45] but everywhere I
[1:30:47] go all the churches that I've been
[1:30:52] in nobody
[1:30:55] ask for a
[1:31:00] musician because that seity is already
[1:31:03] filled that's
[1:31:06] it and you know sometimes you you you
[1:31:09] put in your head some
[1:31:11] things that for God doesn't make any
[1:31:13] sense that's
[1:31:15] right and the things that God puts in
[1:31:17] your head and your heart doesn't make
[1:31:18] sense to you either that's
[1:31:20] right but that's why we have to
[1:31:26] come to an agreement with God that's
[1:31:28] right what do you want me to do
[1:31:31] Lord amen I was telling the brothers in
[1:31:33] in in Tri Cities the the other day that
[1:31:37] I'm happy to be just a spare
[1:31:40] tire so if there is a need of a song
[1:31:43] leader I can just jump in even though I
[1:31:45] don't sing but I I can do the job I know
[1:31:49] there's people can do better
[1:31:51] job but I'm not afraid of it
[1:31:55] if there is someone that needs to clean
[1:31:58] the church
[1:32:01] amen I'm ready that's
[1:32:04] right but I never thought I was going to
[1:32:06] be in front of people like you that
[1:32:08] speaking that's right and to me that's
[1:32:12] probably for you doesn't mean a lot but
[1:32:13] to me it's mon it means more than the
[1:32:17] world to me
[1:32:19] amen and I was also telling that I was
[1:32:24] so blessed when I found got in touch
[1:32:27] with brother Dave and found a little
[1:32:30] group that we're
[1:32:33] in I I feel like if I ever grow in the
[1:32:38] ministry that's what I feel like I've
[1:32:41] been more useful in God's work with a
[1:32:47] little group that's
[1:32:49] right it doesn't it doesn't matter the
[1:32:52] quantities
[1:32:56] I believe brother Bron says
[1:32:58] that the devil
[1:33:01] counts that's right and God Waits that's
[1:33:06] right so the enemy wants to see crowds
[1:33:09] of
[1:33:12] people why do you think that the the
[1:33:14] denominations are full of people cuz
[1:33:17] they choose want to hear something some
[1:33:21] entertainment they don't want to hear
[1:33:24] an adulterated word of
[1:33:27] God you say something to
[1:33:31] them they just walk out of
[1:33:37] here but as long as we speak the word of
[1:33:40] God that's
[1:33:43] it I'm not responsible that's right my
[1:33:47] responsibility being here is not to
[1:33:51] offend you in a personal way
[1:33:55] but if it comes from the Lord if you're
[1:33:57] offended I'm sorry that's right
[1:34:04] amen 1 John 1:9 says if we confess our
[1:34:09] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:34:12] forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[1:34:15] from all
[1:34:18] unrighteousness as essential the then is
[1:34:21] the blood in our bodies so essential is
[1:34:23] the the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:25] to the
[1:34:26] body of Christ too this fluid that can
[1:34:31] reach every single member of that body
[1:34:33] no matter how far those members way may
[1:34:36] be they might be removed from one
[1:34:39] another just as the blood supplies the
[1:34:42] food elements for nourishment in life
[1:34:45] and then carries the carries carries off
[1:34:48] the waste products and poisons due to
[1:34:51] cell metabolism to so to the blood of
[1:34:54] Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:34:58] there to every believer the only source
[1:35:01] of Life the only support and sustance of
[1:35:05] life but also the one who keeps us
[1:35:12] clean Revelation
[1:35:15] 7:14 so he said to me these are
[1:35:20] those these are the ones who come out
[1:35:24] out of the Great
[1:35:26] Tribulation and wash the robs and made
[1:35:30] them white in the blood of the Lamb yes
[1:35:35] thank blood is a constantly circulating
[1:35:38] fluid providing the body with nutrition
[1:35:41] oxygen and waste removal blood is mostly
[1:35:44] liquid with numerous cells and proteins
[1:35:48] suspended making the blood
[1:35:51] thicker than pure water water the
[1:35:55] average person has about 5 lit of
[1:35:59] blood more than a
[1:36:01] gallon a liquid called plasma makes up
[1:36:05] about half of the content of blood
[1:36:08] plasma contains proteins that help blood
[1:36:11] to clot transport substance through the
[1:36:15] blood and perform other functions blood
[1:36:19] plasma also contains glucose and other
[1:36:22] dissolvent nutrients about half of the
[1:36:25] blood volume is composed of blood cells
[1:36:28] red blood cells which carry oxygen to
[1:36:30] the tissues white blood cells which
[1:36:32] fight infections platelets smaller cells
[1:36:35] that help blood to
[1:36:37] clo blood is a conduct through the blood
[1:36:41] vessels arteries and veins blood prevent
[1:36:45] from clothing and blood vessels by their
[1:36:48] smoothness in the Finly turned balance
[1:36:51] of clothing factors
[1:36:54] how
[1:36:57] amazing all the job for the blood in
[1:36:59] your
[1:37:02] body to keep you
[1:37:05] clean if you get hurt just fight the
[1:37:08] infection
[1:37:11] there amazing God
[1:37:14] Amen you know the other thing I I I came
[1:37:17] to me is that
[1:37:24] when
[1:37:25] Joseph was in the
[1:37:32] jail he was there for no
[1:37:36] reason
[1:37:39] and he was there probably thinking what
[1:37:43] I've done
[1:37:46] wrong I've been trying to
[1:37:49] fulfill what my father taught me about
[1:37:52] God
[1:37:54] I rejected this crazy
[1:37:58] woman and I'm here for no
[1:38:02] reason and we again we come back to a
[1:38:07] process in order to
[1:38:10] Joseph to be a useful tool in the hands
[1:38:14] of God right he had to go through that
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:20] amen because remember he was called by
[1:38:25] God but remember he was still was a
[1:38:27] human
[1:38:31] being I'm sure he had regrets against
[1:38:33] his brothers
[1:38:37] sure I'm pretty sure he
[1:38:40] was very mad about that
[1:38:46] woman so we have to
[1:38:50] work with ourselves
[1:38:55] so God send these two guys to
[1:38:59] prison the botler and the
[1:39:05] Baker and
[1:39:08] uh and again these guy these two guys
[1:39:11] had a reason why to be there not
[1:39:16] Joseph what did the thth on the cross
[1:39:18] say to the other thth
[1:39:23] we deserve to be
[1:39:25] here but this
[1:39:27] man he had done nothing right to be in
[1:39:30] this
[1:39:34] place there is
[1:39:37] Joseph between these two
[1:39:42] guys we know we all know the story says
[1:39:46] they had dreams both of them had
[1:39:49] dreams and this is the interesting part
[1:39:51] here
[1:39:55] the butler was the cup better for the
[1:39:59] king and the other one was the
[1:40:02] baker when Jesus and the Last
[1:40:06] Supper what did he
[1:40:08] say he broke the
[1:40:14] bread and gave it to the
[1:40:16] disciples and then he took the cup and
[1:40:19] he said drink amen this is my blood
[1:40:27] this is the Covenant
[1:40:31] amen that's it
[1:40:36] so the butler came to Joseph and says I
[1:40:40] have this
[1:40:44] dream and I
[1:40:47] have tree Vines and D you know the
[1:40:51] story and they say well that that means
[1:40:55] in 3 days you're going to be out of
[1:40:57] here and you're going to you're going to
[1:40:59] take back your
[1:41:02] job and the other guy
[1:41:07] wasn't he he here here's the
[1:41:15] attitude the C better
[1:41:19] was with
[1:41:21] the expecting
[1:41:23] what Joseph has to say about it about
[1:41:26] the
[1:41:28] dream and the baker guy was
[1:41:33] bitter yeah what what can you do I mean
[1:41:37] you're a cellmate like me
[1:41:39] and even the when Joseph say don't the
[1:41:43] dreams come from God and the the answer
[1:41:46] come from God too but he didn't care
[1:41:48] about what Joseph said but when he heard
[1:41:51] that he gave good news to the other guy
[1:41:54] here he comes oh what you have for
[1:41:58] me see the attitude you have to come the
[1:42:01] right attitude towards
[1:42:06] God the same way the teeth on on the
[1:42:08] other side of Jesus if he had the same
[1:42:12] attitude I don't know I don't know why
[1:42:14] Jesus will say the same thing you're
[1:42:16] going to be you both going to be with me
[1:42:19] but the attitude that's it that's right
[1:42:23] and so how many times we come to God in
[1:42:25] an arrogant way that's right Lord you
[1:42:28] didn't say that you was going to do this
[1:42:29] and if I was doing
[1:42:32] this so brightful and
[1:42:37] arrogant well unfortunately there were
[1:42:39] not good news for this other
[1:42:42] guy but this is the this is the the
[1:42:45] thing that
[1:42:46] I marel
[1:42:51] of what happened to the Bab
[1:42:53] guy he got
[1:42:58] hang and the birds ate his
[1:43:02] flesh so bring it
[1:43:05] back to the last supper with
[1:43:10] Jesus Jesus tore apart the bread which
[1:43:15] means this
[1:43:16] flesh we need to sacrifice this flesh
[1:43:24] we had to make a
[1:43:28] suffer to be able to
[1:43:30] receive the
[1:43:33] wine the holy
[1:43:36] spirit amen that's what that's what the
[1:43:40] uh Apostle Paul says that carinal
[1:43:43] Minds cannot understand spiritual
[1:43:50] things I think I had the scripture
[1:43:52] somewhere but
[1:43:56] we we we is I'm
[1:44:01] closing we have to understand that this
[1:44:05] flesh has nothing to do with the kingdom
[1:44:07] of God that's
[1:44:10] right that's right cuz this is goes It
[1:44:14] goes where he came
[1:44:16] from but what is inside of you right
[1:44:19] amen the spirit amen that's right
[1:44:25] now there's some things in life that you
[1:44:27] you and I cannot understand not not
[1:44:31] comprehend talking about the spiritual
[1:44:35] things but the good thing go that God
[1:44:37] got didn't call us to understand every
[1:44:40] single one of
[1:44:44] them do you think Moses
[1:44:48] understood what the serpent
[1:44:51] means right when he said TSS your stuff
[1:44:54] in the
[1:44:57] ground I I I don't think Moses say what
[1:45:02] what what the serpent is going to
[1:45:04] do this it's tons of snakes in in the
[1:45:10] desert
[1:45:12] no but he
[1:45:14] didn't he went and did it
[1:45:17] anyways the outcome of that action it
[1:45:20] wasn't up to Moses right you
[1:45:24] obey and leave it up to
[1:45:26] God that's right do what God told you
[1:45:29] what to do amen that's
[1:45:32] right and let God take care of the rest
[1:45:35] that's right amen and I I always like to
[1:45:39] bring this as a as an
[1:45:41] example if you have a a a legal
[1:45:46] problem you cannot go to the judge face
[1:45:49] to face right away there is a process
[1:45:54] and and you need to hire an
[1:45:58] attorney and they take all the time
[1:46:01] whatever they need to do but you leave
[1:46:04] your case in the hands of that
[1:46:07] attorney and then you just amen stay
[1:46:11] back
[1:46:12] amen why because if you go and try to
[1:46:15] help the attorney y say you know what
[1:46:18] you're not letting me do my
[1:46:20] job either you do it or I do it
[1:46:24] how many times we do the same thing with
[1:46:26] God that's right we bring with the
[1:46:28] problem bring the problem to God and say
[1:46:30] Lord I have this problem this situation
[1:46:33] and I'm living
[1:46:35] in and we don't let it go that's
[1:46:39] it if
[1:46:42] you brought it to God let it go that's
[1:46:47] right right because the way God is going
[1:46:49] to handle is going to be a better way
[1:46:51] than we can handle that's right
[1:47:00] am I don't know what what time I start
[1:47:04] but I'm going to I'm going to stop
[1:47:10] here
[1:47:14] I
[1:47:17] always have a
[1:47:23] the
[1:47:25] satisfaction that when I come
[1:47:29] here I live
[1:47:33] blessed
[1:47:36] so
[1:47:39] I I learned that every time
[1:47:43] when um someone asked me to come and
[1:47:46] speak I understood that it's God who is
[1:47:50] doing leading that person to do that
[1:47:53] amen am and at the beginning and I I
[1:47:58] used to refuse it but I I got to the
[1:48:01] point where it says lord it's got to be
[1:48:03] you so I have I have to that's right to
[1:48:05] do my part so you can do yours amen and
[1:48:09] I always grateful to brother Paul and
[1:48:11] grateful to you that have the patience
[1:48:14] with me and and and
[1:48:19] confidence we always
[1:48:23] want to do better for
[1:48:26] God and it doesn't
[1:48:30] matter where we are we we have to
[1:48:34] be uh focused that we are
[1:48:39] here just passing
