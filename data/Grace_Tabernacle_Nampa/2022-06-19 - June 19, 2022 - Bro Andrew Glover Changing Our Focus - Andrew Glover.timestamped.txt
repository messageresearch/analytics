[35:00] she's apologetic this morning because
[35:02] i'm sorry it was so late but
[35:04] she's sending me a sent me a picture
[35:06] last night
[35:08] of um
[35:10] you know it's
[35:12] i don't know how you say this it's
[35:14] nostalgic
[35:17] and
[35:18] you see saints
[35:20] while we're pressing forward to a
[35:22] victory
[35:24] a victory in love divine is how the
[35:26] prophet of god put it
[35:28] let's not fail to live life
[35:30] while we're going
[35:32] let's not get up every day saying well
[35:34] tomorrow
[35:36] let's live
[35:37] the life
[35:38] today
[35:40] and
[35:41] sister kerry sent a picture last night
[35:43] of mason and gideon
[35:46] their baptism in the boise river a few
[35:50] years ago
[35:51] and they're just these little kids
[35:55] they're just these little little kids
[35:57] and i'm thinking where'd the time go and
[35:59] time has changed because now
[36:01] now this manhood that's coming upon them
[36:03] has come and you know they've got to you
[36:06] know grab the pastor and lift him off
[36:07] the ground to let him know that they can
[36:10] do it
[36:11] they've got to shake his hand until his
[36:13] knuckles crack
[36:14] just so he'll know that they're coming
[36:16] and i don't mind that because it's a
[36:18] stage of life
[36:21] and i'm enjoying the fact
[36:23] saints that they're young men they want
[36:25] to serve the lord
[36:27] and they have life in them
[36:29] and it's beautiful and i was just
[36:32] thinking about that as our little
[36:33] sisters were singing this song
[36:36] sister vika plays the piano so
[36:38] beautifully i don't know if one of these
[36:41] days she realizes that she'll be up
[36:44] front here and
[36:45] i hope she's prepared for that and
[36:48] i hope you don't mind this little
[36:49] nostalgic moment but
[36:52] little heidi
[36:53] yes that's how i see her as little
[36:55] hiding
[36:57] watching her crawl for the first time
[37:03] in my living room
[37:06] watching her ride a bicycle for the
[37:08] first time
[37:10] in our drive
[37:14] i thank the lord
[37:16] amen
[37:17] for his power amen
[37:19] his holding power and let it not just be
[37:23] today but lord let this holding power be
[37:25] upon our young people
[37:28] our middle aged are old
[37:31] to the coming of the lord
[37:33] but let's not fail to live it amen this
[37:36] victorious life includes enjoying this
[37:38] life as it were
[37:40] because we have a special place
[37:42] in the body of the family of christ and
[37:45] anyway i hope you don't mind my little
[37:47] nostalgic moment
[37:49] vanessa come here
[37:54] we are going to have a baptism today
[37:56] after this service
[37:58] this beautiful little girl who's very
[38:00] special to me
[38:01] i've got her in trouble with her mom
[38:04] many times and i apologize for that
[38:07] but she's been after mom and dad for
[38:10] quite a while
[38:11] a heart's desire
[38:13] wants to be baptized
[38:15] and i tell you it stirs my heart if you
[38:17] want to call this another nostalgic
[38:18] moment but it stirs my heart that god is
[38:22] as brother
[38:23] as our brother last night just said
[38:26] we're not praising god because we think
[38:28] it's going to happen but we're praising
[38:30] god because we're seeing it happen and
[38:33] right here is a living proof
[38:35] amen that god is still calling children
[38:38] still calling young people still calling
[38:41] in the day that we live in a dark wicked
[38:43] world god is still calling and there is
[38:46] a people according to the word that will
[38:48] respond
[38:50] amen so today after the service
[38:52] downstairs
[38:54] we get to baptize this beautiful young
[38:57] lady
[38:58] and i look forward to that amen
[39:00] god bless you
[39:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[39:04] well i feel anointed enough to preach to
[39:07] you but it's not my job today
[39:09] so what i want to do is i want each one
[39:11] of us if you had just take a moment now
[39:15] let's lift our hands
[39:17] and let's invite the lord in our
[39:19] presence today and let's give now
[39:22] brother our brother
[39:24] expressed to us last night how we have
[39:26] to give ourselves to christ and we can

[45:14] invite you to the book of luke the 21st
[45:16] chapter
[45:31] the the 25th verse that's a lot better
[45:33] luke 21
[45:35] uh very very familiar reading to the
[45:37] believers this morning we
[45:39] probably could read these verses we're
[45:40] going to look at by heart but i just
[45:42] have a few things here on my heart this
[45:44] morning the lord's been dealing with me
[45:46] on for a few days and i was telling
[45:48] brother paul last night after service he
[45:51] was closing in the song last night and
[45:52] he made a statement about
[45:54] your eyes being turned from you to god
[45:56] and that's actually the direction i was
[45:58] looking this morning so i told him i
[46:00] said well that was just a confirmation
[46:01] amen and we we sure want to say we
[46:04] appreciate brother paul and his
[46:05] friendship and the confidence to come
[46:06] and i know the day and hour we're living
[46:09] in the the times and seasons it's
[46:12] a it's a real thing for a pastor to open
[46:15] this pulpit to minister this day and
[46:17] time
[46:18] i hate to say it this way but it's
[46:19] almost got to where you don't know what
[46:20] guys are going to say sometimes but i
[46:22] sure i appreciate the confidence and the
[46:24] invitation to come and i pray we can say
[46:27] something to be a blessing to you and a
[46:28] strength amen it's an honor brother paul
[46:30] to be able to come and put our shoulder
[46:32] to the wheel and the vision here and
[46:34] what you're doing for the message and
[46:35] for the people of god and we just we
[46:37] sure appreciate you this morning and
[46:39] amen just before we read the word let's
[46:40] just borrow our hearts together
[46:43] for a word of prayer
[46:45] and let's just ask the lord to come in
[46:46] the spirit of revelation and
[46:48] understanding this morning
[46:50] heavenly father as we gather here today
[46:53] lord we are well aware that we're not
[46:54] here by ourselves
[46:56] but lord you have sent angels into this
[46:58] generation you've sent ministering
[47:00] spirits into this building this morning
[47:03] lord we have been taught by a prophet of
[47:05] god that when we arrived here
[47:07] lord we did not walk to our seat by
[47:09] ourselves but there was an angel that
[47:11] lord accompanist and set us where you
[47:13] would have this
[47:14] lord to sit this morning and father it
[47:17] just opens our eyes to realize oh god
[47:19] that lord this is not man's doing this
[47:22] is your doing and lord it is marvelous
[47:24] in our sight for lord no man can
[47:26] orchestrate lord things the way they've
[47:28] been orchestrated outside of your grace
[47:31] now father this morning as we gather
[47:33] here on this beautiful lord's sunday
[47:35] morning resurrection sunday that you've
[47:37] given us father we are well aware that
[47:40] the world recognizes your resurrection
[47:42] one day out of the year but lord as your
[47:44] prophet said to the believer lord we
[47:46] recognize it every day for lord it is by
[47:49] your resurrection that we persevere it
[47:52] is by your resurrection that we have
[47:54] strength and grace to keep pressing
[47:56] forward lord to know that our god is not
[47:58] dead but he is alive and well and lord
[48:01] our hearts are full of joy this morning
[48:03] to see what you're doing in this
[48:05] assembly lord and i pray a special
[48:07] blessing o god upon our brother paul
[48:10] upon his family lord upon this church oh
[48:12] god i pray that your grace and mercy
[48:15] lord would continue to follow them and
[48:17] would continue to cover them oh god lord
[48:19] may you give them many souls for their
[48:21] labor lord many lord many rewards for
[48:24] their struggles oh god now lord as we
[48:26] look into your word we have been taught
[48:27] that anyone with physical strength can
[48:29] open this book but oh god it will take
[48:31] you to make it real now lord may you
[48:34] come in the spirit of revelation bring
[48:36] liberty and understanding forgive us of
[48:38] our failures oh god in our short comings
[48:40] we pray and we'll be sure to give you
[48:42] all the praise all the honor
[48:44] and all the glory for it's in the
[48:46] wonderful name of our lord and savior
[48:48] jesus christ we pray and all the
[48:51] believer says
[48:52] amen and amen the book of luke the 21st
[48:55] chapter i want to look in the 25th verse
[48:57] we also want to say god bless you to all
[48:59] you fathers happy father's day today
[49:02] yes sir amen we want to look here in
[49:04] luke 21 verse 25
[49:06] jesus here speaking says
[49:09] there shall be signs
[49:11] in the sun and in the moon and in the
[49:13] stars
[49:14] and upon the earth distress of nations
[49:17] with perplexity
[49:18] the sea and the waves roaring
[49:21] men's hearts failing them for fear
[49:24] and for looking after those things which
[49:26] are coming on the earth
[49:29] for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[49:32] the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[49:34] and then shall they see the son of man
[49:37] coming in a cloud
[49:38] with power and great glory
[49:41] now the bible is speaking of the signs
[49:43] upon the earth
[49:45] it's speaking of men's hearts failing
[49:47] for fear and then it says then they
[49:49] shall see
[49:50] the son of man coming in a cloud with
[49:52] power and great glory now notice what
[49:54] the 28th verse says and when these
[49:56] things begin to come to pass
[49:58] then look up
[50:00] and lift up your heads
[50:02] for your redemption draweth nigh
[50:04] when these things begin to come to pass
[50:07] then look up can i sit this way in other
[50:09] words change your focus
[50:11] lift up your heads your redemption is
[50:14] drawing nine i also want to look in the
[50:16] book of romans the eighth chapter
[50:18] the book of romans the eighth chapter i
[50:21] know uh this may seem like two uh exact
[50:24] opposite readings but by the help of the
[50:26] lord this morning we can hopefully bring
[50:29] these together that will help you in
[50:30] some way in the book of romans the 8th
[50:32] chapter and the 17th verse
[50:36] the bible here paul speaking
[50:39] he says
[50:40] in romans 8 and verse 17
[50:43] he said if children then we're heirs and
[50:45] heirs of god
[50:47] and join heirs with christ
[50:49] if so be that we suffer with him
[50:52] notice that word suffer if so be that we
[50:54] suffer with him
[50:56] that we may be also glorified together
[50:59] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[51:02] present time
[51:03] are not worthy to be compared
[51:06] with the glory which shall be revealed
[51:09] in us
[51:10] he says i reckon that the sufferings of
[51:12] this present time i want you to notice
[51:14] here in these two verses when you see
[51:16] the word suffering you'll find the word
[51:19] glory right behind the word suffering i
[51:21] reckon that the suffering of this
[51:23] present time are not worthy to be
[51:25] compared with the glory which shall be
[51:28] revealed in us amen we ask the lord this
[51:31] morning to add the blessing to the
[51:32] reading of his word as you can be seated
[51:34] here this morning
[51:35] from those passages of scripture for
[51:37] just a few moments if the lord would
[51:38] help me today i want to minister to you
[51:41] by the help of the lord on this thought
[51:43] and if i would title this today i want
[51:45] to speak to you on changing our focus
[51:48] changing our focus i i was recently
[51:51] hearing the prophet of god in the
[51:52] message the resurrection of jesus 1956
[51:55] and he said something that really just
[51:57] jumped out and got me he said now
[51:59] tomorrow night the lord willing or one
[52:01] night before i leave i would like to
[52:02] speak on the infallibility of the word
[52:05] of god he said and if people can ever
[52:07] get placed and their faith centered not
[52:10] upon present situations but upon what
[52:13] god has said about it now brother
[52:14] branham separates that he said not upon
[52:17] present situations but upon what god has
[52:19] said about it he said if you can
[52:21] remember that no matter what comes or
[52:23] goes or how impossible that it seems to
[52:26] be he said god's word will take its
[52:29] place every time see in the face of
[52:32] every difficulty he said nothing and he
[52:34] repeats himself nothing can take its
[52:36] place he said it has preeminence amen it
[52:40] has preeminence he said because it's
[52:42] none other than god himself in the
[52:45] spoken word and it has to come to pass
[52:48] he meant the prophet of god is showing
[52:50] us that the word has preeminence and it
[52:53] has to come to pass in the message what
[52:55] is the holy ghost he said it doesn't
[52:57] make any difference what anything says
[52:59] he meant the word of god has preeminence
[53:02] in my heart amen it doesn't make any
[53:04] difference what anything else says the
[53:06] word of god has preeminence in my heart
[53:09] that's right and i want what god's got
[53:11] for me if there's anything more open
[53:13] heaven lord cause my heart is open for
[53:16] it amen if there's anything more for me
[53:19] to receive then lord open my heart and
[53:22] open heaven because i want to receive it
[53:24] in the message the token he says i
[53:26] believe that we're now at the time amen
[53:28] that the word should have preeminence i
[53:31] believe we're now at the time that the
[53:33] word should have preeminence i believe
[53:35] the time has come he meant to lay aside
[53:37] our creeds and our faults amen and come
[53:40] back to the word then a prophet of god
[53:43] is inviting the church he meant by
[53:45] divine vision a mentor look at things he
[53:48] meant not the way the world looks at
[53:50] things he meant but to look at things
[53:52] the way that god looks at things in the
[53:54] message victory day he said god invites
[53:56] man to look but man wants to show
[53:58] himself
[54:00] he said man wants to look at what god is
[54:03] trying to show him on the basis of his
[54:05] own idea about it see but god is trying
[54:09] to show man something amen but the man
[54:12] wants to accept it the way he looks at
[54:14] it amen so you can look at something but
[54:16] if you're looking at it amen the way the
[54:18] world looks at it then you're not
[54:20] looking at it the way god looks at it
[54:22] and you will not accept it the way a
[54:24] believer ought to accept it now amen
[54:26] there's many there's many things that we
[54:28] could go through in the message this
[54:29] morning amen of world events or modern
[54:31] events or end time events and we could
[54:33] see amen the way the world looks at it
[54:36] is a totally different view than the way
[54:38] the bride looks at it amen but here's
[54:40] the here's the thing amen is that we as
[54:42] christians have to remember amen that we
[54:45] are in the world but we are not of the
[54:47] world right so we so so we're in this
[54:49] world but what our battle is he meant is
[54:51] to not let the world's influence become
[54:53] the influence of the believer amen like
[54:56] i'll show you this example like right
[54:57] now there's a there's a battle going on
[54:59] between this uh between the country of
[55:01] ukraine and the country of russia right
[55:03] amen and i'll tell you this amen it is a
[55:05] devil that is motivating that it is a
[55:08] spirit at work that is out to kill and
[55:10] destroy amen but we as believers these
[55:13] things did not catch us unaware a bit
[55:15] but we already knew about it because god
[55:18] sent a prophet who would tell us what's
[55:20] going to happen now amen i said like
[55:22] this amen if you're not careful amen
[55:24] every time that russia says something
[55:26] about a bomb amen we'll get to looking
[55:28] at it and if we look at it the way the
[55:30] world looks at it amen we'll be buying
[55:32] bomb shelters and we'll be buying we'll
[55:34] be buying sellers and we'll be we'll be
[55:36] getting all kinds of doomsday
[55:37] preparation amen you know why because
[55:39] we're looking at things the present
[55:41] situation the way the world looks at it
[55:43] but if we look at it the way god looked
[55:45] at it amen we'll look at it the way a
[55:47] prophet said he said before one bomb
[55:49] ever hits this nation he said the bride
[55:52] will be seated at the merit supper of
[55:54] the lamb amen i'll sit you like this
[55:55] friends you've got to get your eyes he
[55:58] meant off of the things the way the
[55:59] world looks at it amen and start
[56:01] focusing on the vindicated word amen
[56:04] that has come in this generation to lead
[56:06] us he meant from the confusion of creeds
[56:08] from the confusion of dogmas into the
[56:10] beautiful revelation of the living god
[56:13] now amen i'll sit you like this in order
[56:15] for the word to have preeminence he
[56:17] meant in the church amen there's got to
[56:19] be a cleansing and there's got to be a
[56:21] purging now you know the problem god
[56:22] said in that last series on the seven
[56:24] seals
[56:25] he said finding in the sixth seal that
[56:28] there is a great interruption in nature
[56:30] the moon the stars the earth belches
[56:32] forth the church is purged amen israel
[56:34] is purged and everything is purged amen
[56:37] under the sixth seal so that the
[56:39] millennium can start in there has to be
[56:41] somebody said there has to be there has
[56:43] to be a cleansing first he said and
[56:45] that's what the church today what i want
[56:47] to point to you what we need is a
[56:49] cleansing he said before anything can
[56:51] begin from god he meant we've got to
[56:54] have a purging and when we when we look
[56:56] and see things that is now under the
[56:59] present conditions existing the way they
[57:01] are then we can see that we've got to
[57:03] have something happen before god can
[57:06] continue his program and to purge him
[57:08] amen i'll sit like this something to
[57:10] happen is a change of focus now do you
[57:13] realize when israel returned to the
[57:14] homeland amen the father god said they
[57:17] came back and he said in a little film
[57:19] they made they asked him on this
[57:20] question said are you returning amen to
[57:22] the homeland to die amen look at the way
[57:25] the world was looking at the situation
[57:27] the world was looking at the situation
[57:29] and saying israel is coming back in the
[57:31] homeland but they're coming back to die
[57:33] amen but a prophet come along and said
[57:35] but there was some there who looked back
[57:37] at those reporters and said no we have
[57:40] come here amen to see the messiah and
[57:42] when you see israel the tree putting
[57:44] forth its buds it's a great sign that
[57:47] the time is at hand when israel becomes
[57:49] a nation and she's a nation today we see
[57:52] things happen in the world amen just as
[57:54] blind as it was in the days of noah amen
[57:57] but to we who look for christ amen to we
[58:01] who look for christ and then the second
[58:03] time he meant it is an enzyme that he is
[58:06] soon coming we see something is fixing
[58:08] to happen it depends on what we're
[58:11] looking at amen if you if you're looking
[58:13] for trouble you're going to see it if
[58:15] you're looking for a fault you're going
[58:16] to find them if you're looking for
[58:18] failures they're going to be there amen
[58:20] if you're looking for something to
[58:22] criticize there's going to be plenty to
[58:23] criticize hey but if you're looking for
[58:26] jesus christ the second time he will
[58:28] send a message which will be an enzyme
[58:30] that'll change our focus oh i say it
[58:32] like this god has promised to lift up an
[58:35] enzyme
[58:36] amen god has promised to lift up an
[58:39] inside do you realize that an inside
[58:41] according to isaiah 5 26 he said amen he
[58:44] will lift up an insight to the nations
[58:46] from afar and will hiss unto them from
[58:48] the end of the earth and behold they
[58:50] shall come amen with speed swiftly the
[58:53] problem of god said an inside it's
[58:55] something that's in commemoration it is
[58:57] lifted up something to people to look at
[59:00] it's something that is placed before you
[59:03] do you realize there is a sign then
[59:05] there is an ensign amen there is signs
[59:08] in the sun there is signs in the moon
[59:10] there is distress between nations with
[59:12] perplexity and then the sea amen the
[59:15] waves are roaring amen men's hearts are
[59:18] failing them for fear those are all
[59:20] signs amen but god promised when you see
[59:23] those signs i will send an end sign hey
[59:25] bendy get your eyes off of the signs and
[59:28] get your eyes back on the vindicated
[59:30] word amen we got to change our focus
[59:32] somebody say that with me lord change my
[59:34] focus we got to change our focus from
[59:37] the sign amen to the inside if you look
[59:39] at the sign you'll be a nervous wreck if
[59:42] you look at the sign you won't have joy
[59:44] you won't be able to make it to church
[59:46] you won't be able to worship god but if
[59:48] you get your eyes off the side and you
[59:50] look away to jesus and then you will see
[59:52] him in the power and the glory and the
[59:55] beauty of his resurrection you will see
[59:57] him as the mighty god you see him as the
[59:59] everlasting father you will see him as
[1:00:02] the great conquer my we got to change
[1:00:04] our focus that word that word focus is a
[1:00:06] beautiful word to me it is the interest
[1:00:08] or activity amen the center of interest
[1:00:11] or activity it is an act of consecrating
[1:00:13] interest or activity on something it is
[1:00:16] the focal point amen of a person or
[1:00:18] their eyes amen adapt to the prevailing
[1:00:21] level of light somebody say that with me
[1:00:23] prevailing level of light amen focus is
[1:00:27] for your eyes to adapt to the prevailing
[1:00:30] level of light and become able to see
[1:00:32] clearly it means to cause one's eyes to
[1:00:35] focus it means to pay particular
[1:00:37] attention to amen it means to
[1:00:40] concentrate amen so here you find amen
[1:00:43] that the word focus means a prevailing
[1:00:45] level of light do you realize it meant
[1:00:47] that there's many kinds of light amen
[1:00:49] there's natural light there's artificial
[1:00:52] light there's spiritual light there's
[1:00:54] king light there's messiah life there's
[1:00:56] denominational lie there's all kinds of
[1:00:58] light but according to isaiah 42 verse 6
[1:01:01] he said i the lord have called the
[1:01:03] unrighteousness and will hold thine hand
[1:01:05] and will keep thee and will give thee a
[1:01:07] covenant for i give thee for a covenant
[1:01:09] of the people amen for a light amen a
[1:01:12] light of the gentiles amen according to
[1:01:15] matthew 4 16 the people which set in
[1:01:18] darkness saw great light and to them
[1:01:20] which sat in the region and shadow of
[1:01:23] death amen light is sprung up the power
[1:01:25] of god said the sun is the king of all
[1:01:28] lights on the earth
[1:01:31] the sun is the king of all lights on
[1:01:34] this earth in the natural lights no
[1:01:36] matter how much artificial light we have
[1:01:38] how many great electric rays we can
[1:01:39] produce amen when that sun rises all the
[1:01:42] rest of them dim out when the sun rises
[1:01:46] all the rest of them dim out amen when
[1:01:48] the same thing it is with the word of
[1:01:50] god when the word of god rises all
[1:01:52] superstitions denominational fanaticism
[1:01:55] and things spread away and it shows
[1:01:58] exactly what it is he said see god in
[1:02:01] the beginning said let there be light
[1:02:03] amen then light only comes the true
[1:02:05] light the king light amen comes by the
[1:02:08] word of god do you realize when light
[1:02:10] appears that light does not change what
[1:02:12] it's shining upon it only reveals what
[1:02:15] it's shining upon amen like it like the
[1:02:17] prophet god said superstitious mountain
[1:02:19] he said there was no way to be able to
[1:02:21] see everything he said with that
[1:02:23] flashlight he said but when the sun
[1:02:25] began to break over the horizon and the
[1:02:27] sun began to shine upon superstitious
[1:02:30] mountain he said it was exactly what
[1:02:32] it's called it was superstition he said
[1:02:35] there was nothing to what they were
[1:02:36] saying about it and i'll say it to you
[1:02:38] like this if you're looking at this
[1:02:40] message through the flashlight of
[1:02:41] denomination you will never see amen the
[1:02:44] power of this message if you were
[1:02:46] looking at this message through the
[1:02:48] superstitious eyes of some denomination
[1:02:50] you will never see it as rapture and
[1:02:52] faith but if you can look at this
[1:02:54] message amen through the son of god and
[1:02:56] then you will see it is the power of god
[1:02:58] under salvation you will see it's not a
[1:03:00] bunch your quotes it's not a bunch of
[1:03:02] pictures it's not a bunch of man's ideas
[1:03:05] it is the power of god to change a human
[1:03:07] heart
[1:03:08] it's the light of god he said god
[1:03:10] separated the light from the darkness in
[1:03:12] the beginning amen and the word of god
[1:03:14] made manifest always amen always
[1:03:18] separates the light from the darkness
[1:03:20] when the word is made manifest amen it
[1:03:23] is an evidence that the word is right
[1:03:25] when the word is separated from the
[1:03:28] light and the darkness now notice this
[1:03:30] the word of god separates it
[1:03:32] said people can rise up isms can rise up
[1:03:34] communism all things can rise up he said
[1:03:37] but his word is superior over all man's
[1:03:40] words amen over all anything his word is
[1:03:44] the light do you realize that light
[1:03:46] coming to you was coming to a seed that
[1:03:49] was already in you
[1:03:52] his light was coming to the seed for the
[1:03:55] age amen the problem of god said he
[1:03:57] needed light to bring forth that seed he
[1:03:59] meant to make that seed live because the
[1:04:01] seed was already there do you realize
[1:04:04] when martin luther amen recognized that
[1:04:06] the body of jesus was not that bread
[1:04:08] that catholicism had made it and the
[1:04:11] blood of jesus was not the wine that
[1:04:12] catholicism had made amen do you realize
[1:04:15] when martin luther recognized that he
[1:04:17] didn't receive a seed and then this deed
[1:04:19] was already laying there it took the
[1:04:22] power of god to quicken that seed came
[1:04:24] into a revelation that there's more to
[1:04:26] god and a bunch of catholicism and
[1:04:29] martin luther moved out and said these
[1:04:31] words the just shall live by faith do
[1:04:34] you realize that that was laying in the
[1:04:35] bible the whole time he was in that
[1:04:37] catholicism system but there was no
[1:04:40] prevailing light to come upon that
[1:04:42] scripture to open his eyes to the
[1:04:44] revelation of what god was really saying
[1:04:46] but the bible says in the evening time
[1:04:49] it shall be light then to think tonight
[1:04:51] friends amen that we as the pride of
[1:04:53] jesus christ we have not come here amen
[1:04:56] is a bunch of church members we have not
[1:04:58] come here as a bunch of fanatics we have
[1:05:00] come here as the pride of jesus christ
[1:05:02] my to think tonight amen to think this
[1:05:05] morning amen i'm knocking the monitor
[1:05:07] over but we'll preach anyhow amen to
[1:05:09] think to this morning that the light was
[1:05:11] already there it just had to quicken
[1:05:13] luther's eyes to see it do you realize
[1:05:15] when wesley looked at the word and said
[1:05:17] there's more to serving god amen than
[1:05:19] just a just shall live by faith and he
[1:05:21] found the message of sanctification the
[1:05:24] seed was already laying there it was
[1:05:26] just waiting for light to quicken the
[1:05:28] seed when pentecost come along and said
[1:05:31] there's more to serving god than just
[1:05:33] the just shall let my faith and the
[1:05:35] sanctified life but there is a promised
[1:05:38] baptism of the holy ghost that will
[1:05:40] return to the church amen the seed was
[1:05:42] already laying in a one-eyed man named
[1:05:45] william seymour who received the
[1:05:47] revelation that the holy ghost amen can
[1:05:50] fill a man's life and he can go into
[1:05:52] another dimension and see god for
[1:05:54] himself come on now amen let's not stop
[1:05:57] at three let's go all the way to four
[1:05:59] amen let's go to that fourth line let's
[1:06:01] go to that fourth stage amen there was a
[1:06:03] bride upon the earth who was knowing
[1:06:06] that there's more to serving god than
[1:06:08] just the just shall live by faith and a
[1:06:10] sanctified life he meant in a
[1:06:12] restoration of gifts but there was some
[1:06:14] word laying here and there was a seed
[1:06:16] laying in your heart to be quick and to
[1:06:18] the promise of the age you're living in
[1:06:21] my he said the only thing he needs is
[1:06:23] the manifestation of the light of god
[1:06:25] upon that scripture to make it live for
[1:06:28] that age he said the hour is at hand now
[1:06:31] that the message he said the light is
[1:06:33] shining the gospel light in its power of
[1:06:36] the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:06:38] manifesting himself that he's jesus
[1:06:40] christ the same yesterday
[1:06:44] day and forever he said see that he
[1:06:46] sings his promise for this day must
[1:06:49] happen in this day the things he's
[1:06:52] promised for this day they must happen
[1:06:54] in this day if the church won't accept
[1:06:57] it amen then god is able these stones to
[1:07:00] rise children unto abraham he will get
[1:07:02] his message over because he's always
[1:07:05] done it and he always will do it let me
[1:07:08] put every devil in hell on notice you
[1:07:10] will never defeat this message you will
[1:07:13] never defeat this bride you will never
[1:07:15] defeat the holy ghost you can better
[1:07:18] stop the son and you can stop a son or
[1:07:20] daughter of god amen from believing this
[1:07:23] message
[1:07:25] come on friends you're living witnesses
[1:07:27] i know my jacket's hanging off and i'm
[1:07:29] taking it off on purpose but preach with
[1:07:30] me your living witnesses ain't been that
[1:07:33] this message will get over the devil's
[1:07:35] tried to stop it he's tried to bind it
[1:07:38] he's trying to defeat it he's tried to
[1:07:40] corner the righteous seed of god said
[1:07:42] slew righteous abel in the beginning but
[1:07:45] everywhere every time any place under
[1:07:47] any condition amen the word has defeated
[1:07:50] the devil may i announce to you this
[1:07:52] morning the word is victorious and
[1:07:54] feelings are defeated the word is
[1:07:56] victorious and memories and reasons and
[1:07:59] conscious and imagination they're all
[1:08:01] defeated this morning by the superiority
[1:08:04] of the level of light in the word of
[1:08:06] almighty god
[1:08:08] oh i tell you why the devil hates you
[1:08:10] it's because you are the fulfillment of
[1:08:11] ephesians 1 18 that the eyes of your
[1:08:14] understanding have been enlightened that
[1:08:16] you may know what is the hope of his
[1:08:18] calling and the riches of the glory of
[1:08:21] the inheritance and the saints do you
[1:08:23] realize this morning that the spirit
[1:08:25] amen moves with the word
[1:08:28] the spirit moves with the word people
[1:08:30] say well brother brother paul we just
[1:08:31] need the word and we don't need the
[1:08:33] spirit or they say we need the spirit
[1:08:35] and we don't need the word do you
[1:08:37] realize you cannot have the spirit
[1:08:39] without having the word
[1:08:41] and you cannot have the word without
[1:08:43] having the spirit they meant they go
[1:08:45] together like a hand in a glove the
[1:08:48] father god said then the main thing amen
[1:08:50] is to focus our lives to the word we
[1:08:53] must focus our lives to the word not
[1:08:55] what somebody else says amen but focus
[1:08:58] our lives to him and he is the word let
[1:09:01] me let me just go and knock another
[1:09:03] devil out while i'm here amen you have
[1:09:05] not been called to focus your life to
[1:09:07] what a man thinks about this message you
[1:09:09] have not been called to focus your
[1:09:11] preaching and your teaching to what a
[1:09:13] man thinks ought to be taught in this
[1:09:15] generation you have been called by the
[1:09:17] almighty god amen to focus your life to
[1:09:20] what a prophet said and if a prophet
[1:09:22] said it amen there ought to be some
[1:09:24] preachers with the courage of god
[1:09:25] they've been to say what a prophet said
[1:09:28] we're not called to focus our lives to
[1:09:30] what a man thinks about this message we
[1:09:32] are called to line our lives with the
[1:09:34] word he said then our life and the word
[1:09:37] becomes the same and the mind that was
[1:09:40] in christ was to fulfill the father's
[1:09:42] word which he was the word amen there
[1:09:45] you are then you and the word are
[1:09:47] focused in together and you become a
[1:09:50] living unit of god
[1:09:52] amen you become a living unit you become
[1:09:54] a living manifestation of the living god
[1:09:58] paul says in hebrews 9 24 he said that
[1:10:00] christ is not entered amen in the holy
[1:10:03] places made with hands which are the
[1:10:05] figures of the true amen but in itself
[1:10:07] now to appear in the presence of god for
[1:10:10] us somebody said that word appear amen
[1:10:12] now to appear in the presence of god for
[1:10:15] us not yet that he should offer himself
[1:10:17] often as the high priest entereth into
[1:10:19] the holy place every year with the blood
[1:10:21] of others verse 26 for then must he
[1:10:24] often have suffered since the foundation
[1:10:26] of the world amen but now once in the
[1:10:29] end of the world amen half he appeared
[1:10:32] amen there's that word again hath he
[1:10:33] appeared to put away sin by the
[1:10:36] sacrifice of himself as it is appointed
[1:10:38] unto man wants to die but after this the
[1:10:41] judgment verse 28 so christ was now
[1:10:43] offered wants to bear the sins of many
[1:10:46] and unto them that look for him shall he
[1:10:49] what appear amen the second time without
[1:10:52] sin unto salvation amen three times paul
[1:10:55] uses one word amen appear the product of
[1:10:58] god said when jesus was on earth he
[1:11:00] declared himself to be the messiah john
[1:11:03] declared there was a messiah sign
[1:11:05] following him the old testament claimed
[1:11:07] that there would be a messianic time he
[1:11:09] proved the messiah signed to the people
[1:11:11] that he was the messiah he was a god
[1:11:14] prophet amen moses the one they had
[1:11:16] followed said the lord your god shall
[1:11:18] raise up a prophet like unto me we know
[1:11:20] that we're aware of that and amongst the
[1:11:23] jews and the samaritans he sold this
[1:11:25] time but of course he never amongst the
[1:11:28] gentiles because we were heathers in
[1:11:30] those days he said our people the
[1:11:31] gentiles the romans we wasn't looking
[1:11:34] for no messiah amen and messiah only
[1:11:37] appears to those who are looking for him
[1:11:41] messiah only appears to those who are
[1:11:44] looking for him amen those who wait for
[1:11:46] him he will appear the second time amen
[1:11:49] so it would be who that's denied to be
[1:11:51] waiting for him and watching for him
[1:11:54] that we do not miss him when he comes
[1:11:56] amen now we've added another word amen
[1:11:59] when he comes so he will appear and then
[1:12:01] he will come you say preacher there's no
[1:12:03] difference well a prophet said there was
[1:12:05] so i'm going to say what a prophet said
[1:12:07] because i've been called to say what he
[1:12:09] said he said there is a difference in
[1:12:11] his appearing and his coming
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:14] is this okay there's a difference in his
[1:12:17] appearing in his coming in second
[1:12:18] timothy 4 8 his four thirds laid up for
[1:12:20] me a crown of righteousness which the
[1:12:22] lord the righteous judge shall give me
[1:12:25] at that day and not to me only but to
[1:12:28] also to them that shall that love his
[1:12:30] appearing unto all them that love his
[1:12:33] appearing first peter 1 7 that the trial
[1:12:36] of your faith being much more precious
[1:12:38] than that of gold that perished that
[1:12:39] would be tried with fire might be found
[1:12:42] unto praise and honor and glory at the
[1:12:44] appearing of jesus christ the part of
[1:12:46] god said not believes his appearing amen
[1:12:49] but loves his appearing amen such a joy
[1:12:52] to know he's coming amen not to those
[1:12:54] that believe he is appearing but to
[1:12:56] those that love his appearing that love
[1:12:59] will produce a joy amen to know that
[1:13:01] he's coming come on church we are a
[1:13:04] strange people this morning that we
[1:13:06] start preaching on the rapture and the
[1:13:07] church don't get quiet we start
[1:13:09] preaching on the second coming of the
[1:13:11] lord and the church don't quit preaching
[1:13:13] they don't quit saying amen you know why
[1:13:15] because you've seen his appearance and
[1:13:18] by seeing his appearance it is quick and
[1:13:20] something inside of you and you're
[1:13:22] looking for it's coming
[1:13:24] hallelujah i'm not a crazy man i have
[1:13:27] seen the appearing of the lord in the
[1:13:29] generation i'm living in and by seeing
[1:13:32] his appearing it has put a hunger in me
[1:13:34] amen for his coming amen the appearance
[1:13:37] of the lord amen comes before the coming
[1:13:39] of the lord the appearing of the lord is
[1:13:41] the holy spirit himself in the church
[1:13:44] and then bringing the church to
[1:13:46] perfection by a prophetic message
[1:13:49] come on amen a prophetic message has
[1:13:51] come to the church listen you're not
[1:13:53] just citizens of idaho you're not just
[1:13:55] citizens of napa or boise or somewhere
[1:13:58] amen you are citizens of a heavenly
[1:14:00] kingdom you are the part of jesus christ
[1:14:03] you are the you are the messiah ants
[1:14:05] that have been prophesied let me tell
[1:14:07] you this you know why you can't be
[1:14:08] stopped it's because you're a prophetic
[1:14:10] class of people and prophecy oh god
[1:14:13] hallelujah amen you know why you cannot
[1:14:15] fail it's because prophecy cannot fail
[1:14:18] for prophecy to fail means god has
[1:14:20] failed amen but my god has never failed
[1:14:23] he's not failing this morning and he
[1:14:25] will never fail he is the unfailing god
[1:14:29] come on church you're a prophetic class
[1:14:31] of people the devil can throw everything
[1:14:34] he wants at you and yet you'll rise
[1:14:36] again he can scandalize your name and
[1:14:38] you'll rise again you can get sick in
[1:14:41] your body and you'll still say god is a
[1:14:43] healer because you're a prophetic class
[1:14:45] of people there's a force of prophecy
[1:14:47] behind your life the prophet said
[1:14:49] there's a great big difference in the
[1:14:51] sign of jesus appearing and then jesus
[1:14:53] coming there's two different words two
[1:14:56] different things the appearing of the
[1:14:57] lord and the coming of the lord
[1:15:00] now can i say what a prophet said
[1:15:03] the appearing of the lord is now
[1:15:06] we're looking for his appearing he's
[1:15:08] already appeared he's here
[1:15:11] now preacher you've got to be careful no
[1:15:13] i don't have to be careful because i've
[1:15:15] not aligned myself with what some man
[1:15:17] called i've aligned myself with what a
[1:15:19] prophet said and he said my ministry is
[1:15:22] different from the evangelists it is
[1:15:24] different from the pastor my ministry is
[1:15:26] to declare him he is here
[1:15:29] come on friends amen he's not just
[1:15:31] coming amen he's here this morning
[1:15:34] listen friends amen the appearing of the
[1:15:36] lord is in his people his spirit working
[1:15:38] among them and proving that it's him
[1:15:40] with him getting them ready for the
[1:15:42] rapture for the coming of the lord to
[1:15:45] catch away his bride the appearing and
[1:15:48] the coming the thing we have to do is if
[1:15:50] we can believe it then be concerned
[1:15:52] about it because first we've got to be
[1:15:54] convinced that it is god amen then when
[1:15:57] we're convinced we are concerned we
[1:15:59] appeared amen i'm not going to read you

[1:18:55] lord
[1:18:56] it's the appearance or let me say it
[1:18:58] like this if you see his appearing it'll
[1:19:00] change your focus and you'll be looking
[1:19:02] for his coming
[1:19:04] come on now people say well he appeared
[1:19:06] in 1963 so we're not looking for his
[1:19:08] coming that tells me brother david they
[1:19:10] didn't see his appearing because the
[1:19:12] prophet said if you see his appearing
[1:19:14] it'll produce a love that'll cause you
[1:19:16] to look for his coming if you're not
[1:19:19] looking for the second coming of the
[1:19:21] lord jesus christ amen then you've not
[1:19:24] seen his appearance but if you're
[1:19:25] looking for the second coming of the
[1:19:27] lord jesus christ it's because you have
[1:19:30] seen his appearing
[1:19:32] now come on friends the prophet of god
[1:19:34] taught it and three kinds of believers
[1:19:36] he said every believer true believer
[1:19:38] believes in the physical corporal return
[1:19:41] of the lord jesus christ amen 1963 did
[1:19:45] not dismiss amen the coming of the lord
[1:19:48] it was the personal appearance
[1:19:52] oh god i'm trying to behave myself this
[1:19:54] morning it was his presence coming to
[1:19:56] the church amen then when you see that
[1:19:59] the prophet of god said i want to take
[1:20:00] one word this morning and i want to call
[1:20:02] it l double okay look
[1:20:05] he said see look when you hear the word
[1:20:08] it's usually trump somebody trying to
[1:20:10] get you to see what they're looking at
[1:20:12] he said everybody is looking for
[1:20:14] something they're looking for something
[1:20:16] to happen everything is looking he said
[1:20:18] the ford company is looking to make a
[1:20:20] better forward the chevrolet company
[1:20:22] looking to make a better chevy phoenix

[1:20:31] you thankful that the prophet of god
[1:20:33] separated you in the first seal and said
[1:20:36] i'm no longer going to call you church
[1:20:38] i'm going to call you bride when he
[1:20:40] separated you he was changing your focus
[1:20:43] the focus of the church was more members
[1:20:46] a million more and 44 bigger programs
[1:20:49] bigger buildings bigger schools more
[1:20:50] hospitals but a prophet said that's not
[1:20:52] the focus of this bride amen the bride
[1:20:55] is looking for the coming of her lord
[1:20:57] because she has seen his appearing
[1:21:02] oh god she is looking for his coming
[1:21:05] because she has seen his appearance my
[1:21:08] this morning to think the prophet god
[1:21:10] said we're all looking he said but it
[1:21:11] depends on what the voice is trying to
[1:21:14] tell you to look for some of us are
[1:21:16] saying look for this amen but the voice
[1:21:18] i'm trying to say to you this morning is
[1:21:20] like the writer of this epistle
[1:21:23] which we believe to be paul
[1:21:25] the book of hebrews he said see in order
[1:21:28] to do that you've got to look for the
[1:21:30] coming of jesus christ the second time
[1:21:32] in order to do that you got to see
[1:21:35] something
[1:21:36] you got to see something before you can
[1:21:39] tell somebody else to look at what you
[1:21:41] are seeing

[1:21:55] played that game we hey look over there
[1:21:57] so you look over there and the only
[1:21:58] reason they're telling you that is to
[1:21:59] distract you because they don't want you
[1:22:01] to see something
[1:22:04] come on amen amen if if we were going to
[1:22:07] bring a surprise person in here this
[1:22:09] morning to surprise you we'd say look
[1:22:11] over there look look over here until the
[1:22:13] person could come in the room amen see
[1:22:15] they're trying to distract you but let
[1:22:16] me say this a prophet of god was not
[1:22:19] tricking the church
[1:22:20] when he said these words look away to
[1:22:23] jesus he had spent 20 years telling you
[1:22:26] how you're going to see him the four
[1:22:28] ways he appears can we see jesus search
[1:22:31] we see jesus come on looking for jesus
[1:22:33] looking for him we had heard sermons for
[1:22:36] years of how to see him and then in 1963
[1:22:39] a prophet caps his year off and says
[1:22:42] look away to jesus in other words he's
[1:22:44] saying what you've been looking for is
[1:22:46] not coming it is here
[1:22:49] what you've been looking for is upon the
[1:22:51] earth my he said he was trying to get
[1:22:54] the people to look at remember was
[1:22:55] trying to get the people to look at what
[1:22:57] he was seeing what am i trying to do i'm

[1:23:04] to peter james and john as sure as he
[1:23:06] kept his word to john the beloved the
[1:23:08] revelator is as sure as he kept the
[1:23:11] promise through the church ages is that
[1:23:13] sure he's promised in this last day he
[1:23:15] would send down a ladder rain that would
[1:23:17] bring the same spirit upon the earth
[1:23:19] that was in him the light shall come in
[1:23:22] the evening time and show the same power
[1:23:24] the same signs everything he did in his
[1:23:27] day he would do again in this open door
[1:23:30] in the last day here it is we got it
[1:23:32] right with us now

[1:23:56] see what is right and wrong brother
[1:23:58] david who is that it he's talking about
[1:24:00] he said it's the holy spirit himself
[1:24:04] among church justification made way for
[1:24:07] sanctification and sanctification made
[1:24:09] way for the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:12] but the baptism of the holy ghost made
[1:24:14] way for the person himself
[1:24:16] jesus christ to step in the church
[1:24:19] it's the holy spirit speaking through
[1:24:21] human lips operating among human beings
[1:24:24] trying to show mercy and grace i am not
[1:24:26] the messiah i am no christ brother says
[1:24:29] but he is here and that's what i'm
[1:24:31] trying to get you to see he is here and
[1:24:34] he's keeping his word
[1:24:36] he is here and he's keeping his word
[1:24:39] amen i didn't come here just to be seen
[1:24:41] he says i didn't come here because there
[1:24:43] was no other place to go i come here
[1:24:45] because i felt to come here i felt that
[1:24:48] the ministry that the lord had given me
[1:24:50] amen must be sowed among the people here
[1:24:53] and i'm trying to get you to see what
[1:24:55] god really is now

[1:25:22] holy spirit come in the church which the
[1:25:25] prophet said that's god's range finder

[1:27:58] hold of the camera of your eyes and let
[1:28:00] you see what god is

[1:28:12] again but i'm going to preach the truth
[1:28:13] to you this morning you've not been
[1:28:15] brought up on the earth just to be a
[1:28:16] young lady you're not here just to be a
[1:28:18] young man you've been brought up on this
[1:28:20] earth for an eternal purpose of the
[1:28:22] almighty god that is returned in this
[1:28:25] age to make real men and women out of
[1:28:27] you
[1:28:30] oh god if i can say it to any way open
[1:28:33] your eyes and see him
[1:28:36] let's see who god is let's see what his
[1:28:38] purpose is the protagonist is a group of
[1:28:41] believers a symbol today we want to fix
[1:28:43] our thoughts we want to fix our
[1:28:45] principles and things upon the coming of
[1:28:48] the lord
[1:28:49] come on what was elohim materializing
[1:28:51] for to change your focus on the coming
[1:28:54] of the lord what was el shaddai
[1:28:56] returning to the church for to reveal
[1:28:58] himself that you could receive strength
[1:29:01] from the nourishment of el shaddai
[1:29:04] looking for christ who shall appear
[1:29:06] somebody say appear
[1:29:08] the second time without sending the
[1:29:10] salvation to those that believe and are
[1:29:12] looking for him then god here by the
[1:29:14] writer is inviting us to view this and
[1:29:17] to look at it therefore it's the word
[1:29:20] that we look to for it is the expression
[1:29:22] of what god is what a hope it gives us
[1:29:25] that god has not left us without a true
[1:29:28] witness in the days of confusion
[1:29:31] come on now it's a day of confusion in
[1:29:33] the days of confusion that we live in
[1:29:35] today we are certainly privileged people
[1:29:38] if we'll just look to the true witness
[1:29:41] that we have the word
[1:29:43] the true witness is the word the word
[1:29:46] see because that's god's full revelation
[1:29:49] of jesus christ the true witness of the
[1:29:52] church is the word which is god's full
[1:29:54] revelation of jesus christ nothing can
[1:29:57] be added to it or taken away from it
[1:30:00] it's because it is the revelation of
[1:30:03] jesus christ in the day of confusion
[1:30:05] it's a day of confusion because people
[1:30:08] are looking to signs rather than the
[1:30:10] ensign in luke 21 25 there shall be
[1:30:13] signs in the sun and in the moon and in
[1:30:15] the stars and upon the earth the stress
[1:30:18] of nations with perplexity amen the sea
[1:30:21] and the waves roaring amen men's hearts
[1:30:24] fading them for fear now notice this for
[1:30:26] looking after those things which are
[1:30:29] coming on the earth so they're here on
[1:30:32] the earth and their eyes for the paul is
[1:30:34] fixed upon the sun upon the moon come on
[1:30:37] now amen we went through it a few years
[1:30:39] ago everybody had their own
[1:30:41] interpretation of what the blood moons
[1:30:42] was
[1:30:44] they was all interpreting what the blood
[1:30:46] moons was and most of them missed it and
[1:30:48] instead of coming back and saying it was
[1:30:50] wrong and then they just went on as if
[1:30:52] everything was okay but that's what oh
[1:30:55] god
[1:30:56] that's why i don't get excited by
[1:30:58] eschatology teachers that's why i don't
[1:31:00] get excited when somebody says oh i've
[1:31:02] got a revelation on the blood moons
[1:31:04] because i know that that revelation
[1:31:05] could fail but when i heard a prophet of
[1:31:08] god say something i've tied my life to
[1:31:10] it it's an absolute for my ministry it's
[1:31:13] an absolute for my family come on it's
[1:31:15] an absolute to the bride of jesus christ
[1:31:18] now their hearts are going to be failing
[1:31:19] for fear for looking after those things
[1:31:22] which are coming upon the earth for the
[1:31:24] powers of heaven shall be shaken notice
[1:31:26] this the prophecy wherever you look at
[1:31:29] with your eyes and you see now our
[1:31:31] nation is shaken and trembling war
[1:31:33] clouds are flying everywhere every
[1:31:35] nation under distress and perplexed
[1:31:37] times every sign that jesus said would
[1:31:39] happen is happening there would be signs
[1:31:42] in the heaven above in the earth below
[1:31:44] great things will be taking place like
[1:31:46] flying saucers and things but he
[1:31:49] commanded his church come on but he the
[1:31:52] mighty god elohim el shaddai the god
[1:31:56] that not just was not the god that will
[1:31:58] be but the god which he has commanded
[1:32:00] his church to lift up their heads in
[1:32:03] that day and look up for the unseen
[1:32:06] christ
[1:32:08] will be appearing soon come on church

[1:32:26] command first thessalonians 4 and the
[1:32:28] lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:32:31] with a shout that word shout means an
[1:32:34] order or a command

[1:32:39] amen it is to soldiers by a commander
[1:32:42] with a loud summons the problem of god
[1:32:44] said in the rapture a shout what is the
[1:32:47] sound it's the message going forth it's

[1:37:41] oh god
[1:37:42] are you hearing me he's getting ready to
[1:37:45] tell you look away to jesus but if he's

[1:37:49] to be something there to see when you
[1:37:51] look so he's
[1:37:52] he identifies what you're looking to is
[1:37:55] revelation 10 1 fulfilled luke 21 27
[1:37:58] fulfilled
[1:38:01] one day turning to the right notice this
[1:38:03] it was standing there with a white wig
[1:38:05] on oh god with a white wig on looking
[1:38:08] back down towards the earth showing he
[1:38:10] is supreme authority the heavens
[1:38:13] declares it the bible declares it the
[1:38:15] message declares it all the same supreme
[1:38:18] authority with a white wig on do you see
[1:38:22] he said now some say just turn it
[1:38:24] sideways here it is it had been
[1:38:25] photographed to him he said they're
[1:38:27] looking at him from the wrong angle
[1:38:30] if you're going to see him you got to
[1:38:32] change your focus they were looking at
[1:38:34] it from the wrong angle he said but you
[1:38:36] got to look at it in the right angle and
[1:38:38] the only the lord god can reveal which
[1:38:41] is the right angle come on friends
[1:38:43] brother paul it was not william branham
[1:38:45] and the pulpit it was the mighty angel
[1:38:48] had come down into a man and was
[1:38:50] revealing who he was
[1:38:53] only the lord god can reveal who he is
[1:38:57] turn it to your right and look at it
[1:38:59] there he is just as perfect had it been
[1:39:02] a photograph up there listen brother
[1:39:04] brother brother david he says these next
[1:39:06] words he said and my house has never
[1:39:09] been without one of those picture fence
[1:39:13] brother paul my house has not been
[1:39:16] without one of those pictures since in
[1:39:19] the skies the very god i saw in this
[1:39:22] vision out here just a little boy by the
[1:39:24] schoolhouse he looked like that and here
[1:39:27] in the heavens 33 years later declares
[1:39:30] it's the truth the way he looks it's not
[1:39:33] some mystic something of somebody's idea
[1:39:37] we are not following a mystic something
[1:39:39] of somebody's idea come on church
[1:39:42] will you agree with me that the book of
[1:39:44] revelation is the book of symbols
[1:39:47] will you agree with me the book of
[1:39:49] revelation is the book of symbols from
[1:39:51] revelation 1 to revelation 22 is symbol
[1:39:54] after symbol after symbol after symbol
[1:39:57] do you realize that a symbol remains a
[1:39:59] symbol without a revelation
[1:40:01] without a revelation a symbol remains a
[1:40:03] symbol but when the revelation comes
[1:40:05] according to a prophet in the first seal
[1:40:08] the revelation comes he says it
[1:40:10] thundered when it was released in symbol
[1:40:12] form he said that how much more will it
[1:40:15] thunder when he reveals it in reality
[1:40:17] form come on church revelation 10 1 was
[1:40:20] a symbol form upon the mountain but he
[1:40:23] was
[1:40:24] god is coming quicker than i can get it
[1:40:26] out but he was not desiring to remain in
[1:40:29] symbol form his head was not looking up
[1:40:32] to the heavens he had already filled the
[1:40:34] highest office that could be filled he
[1:40:36] was god he was the mighty god so what is
[1:40:39] he doing he's looking down upon the
[1:40:41] earth
[1:40:44] i'm on church he's up high looking down
[1:40:47] if you're looking down you're looking
[1:40:48] down for a reason you know why because
[1:40:51] in 2022 there would be a group of people
[1:40:54] up on the earth
[1:40:56] there would be a group of people upon
[1:40:57] the earth who would have every reason to
[1:40:59] be looking down and they needed a reason
[1:41:02] to look up
[1:41:04] they needed something to look up to so
[1:41:07] the mighty age will come down and reveal
[1:41:09] himself in this generation to fulfill
[1:41:12] the words of jesus when these things
[1:41:14] begin to come to pass russia is
[1:41:17] hollering when nations are breaking when
[1:41:19] israel is in the homeland then come on
[1:41:21] little bride look up your redemption is
[1:41:24] drawing nigh
[1:41:25] hallelujah

[1:41:32] bunch of idiots our lord is up there
[1:41:37] our lord is up there well preacher i
[1:41:39] don't see what you're looking at maybe
[1:41:40] he wasn't born to see it but there's a
[1:41:42] bride on the earth
[1:41:46] brother paul there's a bride in position
[1:41:49] the word of almighty god has changed her
[1:41:52] focus
[1:41:55] it was a symbol
[1:41:57] can i preach it to you
[1:41:59] it's got to be a reality to the symbol
[1:42:01] or it remains a symbol may i introduce
[1:42:04] you to the symbol this morning may i
[1:42:06] introduce you to the reality of the
[1:42:08] symbol
[1:42:11] there it is
[1:42:12] there it is in the back there it is on
[1:42:14] the front row there it is in a pastor
[1:42:17] there it is in a song leader there it is
[1:42:19] in a young lady it's no longer in symbol
[1:42:21] form you are the reality of the
[1:42:24] appearance of jesus christ in this
[1:42:27] dispensation
[1:42:30] he has come the son of man he come as
[1:42:32] son of god he will come as son of david
[1:42:34] in the millennium but between the son of
[1:42:36] god and the son of david according to
[1:42:38] luke 17 30 he will return as the son of
[1:42:42] man this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:42:46] in nampa idaho

[1:42:52] praise somebody worshipping michael
[1:42:54] mighty bride

[1:43:05] now do you feel that tug you feel that
[1:43:07] charge do you know what it is it's a
[1:43:10] redeemer drawing you it's the redeemer
[1:43:12] pulling that
[1:43:17] exactly right if there's a clown picture
[1:43:19] with a symbol there's going to be a
[1:43:21] reality
[1:43:22] you say preacher there ain't no power in
[1:43:24] the picture then pray tell me how come
[1:43:26] five boys laid in their bed every night
[1:43:29] for 18 years and looked at a picture on
[1:43:31] the wall and when they grew up they
[1:43:33] everyone went into the navy
[1:43:36] but tells the story he said five boys
[1:43:39] grew up and everyone one by one went
[1:43:40] into the navy he said that they they
[1:43:43] come down and did an investigation
[1:43:45] because nobody in their family had ever
[1:43:48] been an overcomer i mean
[1:43:51] had never went in the navy
[1:43:53] nobody in their family had ever been
[1:43:56] able to overcome sin i mean had never
[1:43:58] went into the navy
[1:44:00] the whole family tree was cursed and
[1:44:02] hear these come on friends and these
[1:44:05] five boys break the cycle of a
[1:44:07] thousand-year-old tradition in their
[1:44:08] family
[1:44:11] you know what happened brother paul they
[1:44:13] went in there and they began to
[1:44:14] investigate the boy's bedroom and in
[1:44:16] them boys bedroom brother was a picture
[1:44:18] of a ship that was sailing on a calm sea
[1:44:22] god have mercy what's the picture of a
[1:44:24] ship sitting on a calm sea he said then
[1:44:26] five boys laid there every night looked
[1:44:29] at that ship and rob said like this he
[1:44:31] said see it so impressed them boys
[1:44:37] it's so impressed them boys as they went
[1:44:39] to bed looking at this picture it was on
[1:44:42] their mind to sail that quiet soothing
[1:44:44] sea and as long the morning when they
[1:44:47] first arose the first thing they could
[1:44:49] look at was that making her way
[1:44:51] through the comm sea and it impressed
[1:44:54] the boys till each one become a sailor
[1:44:56] he said now if a picture of a ship will
[1:44:59] impress boys to become navy men sailors
[1:45:03] of the sea then what ought the picture
[1:45:06] of the lord jesus do
[1:45:10] you say what brother andrew i'm not
[1:45:11] hanging up that clown picture i don't
[1:45:13] really trust it i'm going to hang up
[1:45:15] hoffman's head of christ do you realize
[1:45:17] hoffman's head of christ is a painting
[1:45:20] come on it's a painting it's not even a
[1:45:23] it's not even a real picture taken in
[1:45:25] time it was a man's painting now i'm not
[1:45:27] discrediting hoffman's head of christ
[1:45:29] the prophet god said that's the closest
[1:45:31] thing i can describe he looks like he
[1:45:33] said but see amen what happened up there
[1:45:35] on the mountain what happened in sam
[1:45:37] houston coliseum it was not psychology
[1:45:40] because the camera will not take a
[1:45:42] picture of something that's not there oh
[1:45:44] god there was a literal physical being
[1:45:47] that was
[1:45:50] there was a literal physical being that
[1:45:52] had come into the church are you hearing
[1:45:54] me therefore the picture we have amen
[1:45:56] ought to be before our children come on
[1:45:58] he said see it ought to be bring up a
[1:46:00] child and the way it should go and when
[1:46:02] he's old he'll not depart from it i love
[1:46:05] how the prophet said this are we
[1:46:06] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:46:09] our midst are we sufficiently impressed
[1:46:12] with the revelation well let me say this
[1:46:15] whatever them boys got out of that
[1:46:17] picture
[1:46:19] come on now whatever them boys got out
[1:46:22] of that picture listen i'll resent that
[1:46:24] spirit this is not coming from a man
[1:46:26] it's not coming from a preacher it's
[1:46:28] coming from almighty god this
[1:46:30] stimulation the church this morning it's
[1:46:32] not coming because andrew glover's here
[1:46:34] it's because the mighty angel is here
[1:46:36] the everlasting father the angel of the
[1:46:38] covenant has returned to the church
[1:46:42] are you hearing me hey man let me say it
[1:46:44] to you like this whatever them boys got
[1:46:46] out of that picture and pressed them
[1:46:47] enough
[1:46:49] come on now do you realize brother they
[1:46:51] didn't just look at that picture for 18
[1:46:53] years and wake up and go straight to
[1:46:55] become a navy man or a sailor put on a
[1:46:58] uniform get in the cockpit of a ship and
[1:47:00] sell the ship
[1:47:02] they had some training to go through
[1:47:04] come on you imagine the first day amen
[1:47:06] the first boy got down there oh god that
[1:47:09] first boy got down there and he went in
[1:47:10] there and the the drill sergeant said
[1:47:12] come in here boy you're gonna get a
[1:47:13] haircut he said yeah i've been needing
[1:47:15] one you know kind of get a little long
[1:47:17] on the sides so he went in there and sit
[1:47:18] down imagine that that drill sergeant
[1:47:21] said listen how do you want your hair
[1:47:22] cut he said well you know i think i'll
[1:47:24] just take a little bit off the sides
[1:47:26] here maybe line up the top you know just
[1:47:28] kind of edged up he said okay i got you
[1:47:30] he flipped the guard off turned the
[1:47:31] clippers on and buzz cut that boy down
[1:47:33] to a bald head
[1:47:36] do you realize that wasn't enough to
[1:47:37] turn him around
[1:47:39] come on
[1:47:44] that wasn't enough to turn him you
[1:47:46] imagine the next day he got up about
[1:47:47] five o'clock and they said let's go to
[1:47:49] the mess hall had breakfast and he went
[1:47:51] down there and he's thinking it's going
[1:47:52] to be eggs and biscuits and grits and
[1:47:54] bacon all kinds of good old you know
[1:47:56] butter and salt and he got down there it
[1:47:57] looked like dog food on the table but
[1:47:59] that wasn't enough to turn him around
[1:48:01] are you hearing me you realize six hours
[1:48:03] of pt or whatever you had to go through
[1:48:06] wasn't enough to turn whatever was in
[1:48:08] that picture impressed that boy to
[1:48:11] persevere regardless of the condition
[1:48:13] you know why because the suffering was
[1:48:16] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:48:19] which was going to be revealed in them
[1:48:21] boys lives
[1:48:23] are you hearing me church and i'll say
[1:48:25] it like this as a young man i have
[1:48:28] suffered for this message but i do not
[1:48:30] regret one suffering i do not regret one
[1:48:33] ridicule i do not regret one hard trial
[1:48:35] come on i don't regret one mile that
[1:48:38] i've cried my way home from a meeting
[1:48:40] because of things it was saying i have
[1:48:42] seen the glory of the lord and it has
[1:48:44] impressed me brother paul it is
[1:48:47] impressed me what are you saying
[1:48:48] preacher i'm saying young lady let this
[1:48:50] message impress you you don't know what
[1:48:52] your future holds i don't know what your
[1:48:54] future holds but the want who is in that
[1:48:57] picture is holding your future
[1:49:02] are you hearing me the one who is in
[1:49:05] that picture is holding your future
[1:49:08] he's got it all in control
[1:49:10] it may look like it's falling apart but
[1:49:13] remember he's still a waymaker
[1:49:16] he's still a miracle worker you just got
[1:49:18] to change your focus are you hearing me
[1:49:20] you got to change your focus remember
[1:49:22] what that word focus means it means to
[1:49:24] cause one's eyes to focus
[1:49:27] to cause one's eyes to focus it means to
[1:49:30] pay particular attention to to
[1:49:32] concentrate do you realize that the eyes
[1:49:34] are the gate to the soul
[1:49:37] the eyes are the gate to the soul and
[1:49:39] the soul is the real you
[1:49:44] the soul is the real you then whatever
[1:49:47] you let come through your eyes is what's
[1:49:49] getting to the real you

[1:53:31] called secondary he said the word is the
[1:53:34] major the word is the preeminence
[1:53:38] the word is the preeminence the word is
[1:53:40] the liberty the word is the direction
[1:53:42] the word is the anointing the word is
[1:53:44] the power to destroy the yoke of the
[1:53:46] enemy come on church what are you saying

[1:54:50] is the bride's revival you want revival
[1:54:53] you want a revival preach this message
[1:54:55] you want a move of god preach this
[1:54:57] message
[1:55:01] it's a spirit of intimidation it's a
[1:55:03] spirit of hierarchy that lifts himself
[1:55:04] up in a position and says well you know
[1:55:06] so-and-so is with brother branham and
[1:55:08] they've got little inside here and a
[1:55:10] little backwards story here and we're
[1:55:11] going to leave the church by that i'll
[1:55:13] tell you where you lead them you're
[1:55:14] leading the tribulation
[1:55:16] this message will lead you to
[1:55:17] glorification
[1:55:20] i'm on church somebody told me one time
[1:55:22] they said brother andrew i was talking
[1:55:23] to a brother and he looked at me and he
[1:55:25] said you know what brother problem with
[1:55:27] you is you just ain't too revelated he
[1:55:29] said what in your terms would tell you
[1:55:31] that i'm qualified for revelation he
[1:55:33] said well one time i was out with
[1:55:35] brother brandon hunting a long time ago
[1:55:36] long story i don't know if the man still
[1:55:38] alive or not but he said eyes out
[1:55:40] brother i'm hunting and he said brother
[1:55:41] branham called me buddy and he called me
[1:55:43] pal and he called me friend that young
[1:55:46] boy was told that story and it put a
[1:55:48] spirit upon that young man for years
[1:55:50] that he was not with brother branham and
[1:55:52] he was not called buddy or friend or
[1:55:54] power by the brown i said young man
[1:55:56] listen amen you might not been called
[1:55:58] buddy and you might not been called
[1:55:59] friend or power but you was called
[1:56:01] something greater he was called bride
[1:56:06] i would rather be called bride than i
[1:56:08] would be rather called free i'm on
[1:56:10] church because as the bride of jesus
[1:56:12] christ and under this message i am a
[1:56:14] friend to a prophet
[1:56:17] come on now do you realize under this
[1:56:19] messenger a friend to a prophet what was
[1:56:21] in his dream he was walking the trail
[1:56:23] brother paul and what reared its head
[1:56:25] the black mamba and he said you got
[1:56:27] power to mind and you got power to lose
[1:56:29] he said in the name of jesus christ i
[1:56:31] bind you and the mama was bound he said
[1:56:34] just to see if it worked he said i said
[1:56:36] i loose you and the thing come up and
[1:56:38] tried to bite me again he said and i
[1:56:40] bind you he said there was a man walking
[1:56:42] with me in the vision who had the same
[1:56:44] power he meant to bind and to loose the
[1:56:47] serpent do you realize where the power
[1:56:49] he meant to bind loose was coming from
[1:56:51] it was coming from walking with a
[1:56:53] prophet and he was not with that prophet
[1:56:55] he would not have the ability to bind
[1:56:57] the serpent but the strength
[1:57:01] the promise of god's asked a question
[1:57:02] can you interpret what it means to
[1:57:04] receive a prophet is to receive the
[1:57:06] prophet's reward he said it means to be
[1:57:08] the friend of a prophet
[1:57:11] come on church many are the afflictions
[1:57:13] of the righteous but the lord will
[1:57:15] deliver him out of them all do you
[1:57:18] realize can i take a little liberty here
[1:57:20] do you realize what affliction means the
[1:57:22] bible definition of affliction means bad
[1:57:26] evil
[1:57:28] unpleasant and malignant
[1:57:32] now come on
[1:57:34] bad evil unpleasant and malignant
[1:57:39] go the doctor doctor said i found a
[1:57:41] tumor what's the first thing you ask
[1:57:43] is it malignant
[1:57:45] is it cancerous come on
[1:57:48] and the bible here saying many are the
[1:57:50] afflictions of the righteous brother
[1:57:51] paulie it dawned on me one day every
[1:57:53] affliction we go through has the
[1:57:55] potential to become cancerous
[1:57:59] i'm gonna back it up by the word the
[1:58:01] protagonist said a cancer in the
[1:58:02] nazarene would be a scavenger a buzzard
[1:58:04] and eat dead things he said a cancer
[1:58:06] comes from a bruise a bruised cell
[1:58:09] usually where it's come from the cell is
[1:58:12] bruised it's all mashed up and the cell
[1:58:14] is backslidden it's something happens in
[1:58:16] there that fails to get the blood
[1:58:18] function of it to it right the get the
[1:58:20] the
[1:58:22] function of the blood to it right
[1:58:24] i'll get it out in a minute and through
[1:58:26] there satan the author of death which
[1:58:28] god is the author of life satan the
[1:58:30] officer of death puts a demon in there
[1:58:32] called the devil a cancer he said the
[1:58:35] cancer comes from the word crab he said
[1:58:37] with legs and things that runs out and
[1:58:38] like other diseases are given medical
[1:58:40] terms he said then that little cancer
[1:58:42] comes in there and first it is a spirit
[1:58:47] the first thing for the jason of cancer
[1:58:49] is is a spirit he said see then it gets
[1:58:51] into a backslidden cell brother brother
[1:58:53] david why didn't that cancer
[1:58:56] spirit amen find a strong
[1:59:00] right
[1:59:01] all cell
[1:59:02] i'm preaching to you now why didn't that
[1:59:05] spirit find a real healthy cell that's
[1:59:08] that's pulsating with white blood cells
[1:59:09] why did it find a weak back sudden sale
[1:59:12] see or a bruise sale that's not
[1:59:14] operating right amen isn't it amazing a
[1:59:16] spirit comes in the church and it don't
[1:59:18] come to pasture
[1:59:22] a spirit comes in a church and it don't
[1:59:24] come to a strong cell
[1:59:26] a strong member that the blood is
[1:59:28] functioning through them it finds
[1:59:30] somebody that's already heard about
[1:59:31] something
[1:59:34] well we might as well preach we're here
[1:59:37] are you hearing me amen you you let a
[1:59:39] spirit come in a church that says the
[1:59:41] preacher is preaching too long or the
[1:59:43] song service is too loud or the music is
[1:59:45] too fast that spirit will not go to a
[1:59:48] strong cell member of the church it'll
[1:59:50] go to somebody else who's thinking the
[1:59:52] same thing that spirit's thinking
[1:59:55] and it'll connect itself come on it'll
[1:59:57] connect itself and then that sale will
[2:00:00] go to another cell and they'll say you
[2:00:02] know what i'm not thinking
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:07] i got to thinking you know that music's
[2:00:09] a little too loud that song was a little
[2:00:12] too emotional you know i got to thinking
[2:00:14] brother paul's just he's just two two
[2:00:16] he's just too long for me i tell you
[2:00:19] what i got to thinking them pews are
[2:00:21] just not comfortable that sale is going
[2:00:23] to other sales he said oh i'd like to
[2:00:26] preach the gospel for five minutes
[2:00:27] that's what happens in the church
[2:00:30] when he gets someone failing to operate
[2:00:33] with the church someone failing and
[2:00:35] pulling off and getting indifferent
[2:00:37] that's a cancer in the church
[2:00:40] it's a devil in that person
[2:00:43] that's right he said that causes the
[2:00:46] whole church to be sick over it are you
[2:00:48] ready for this
[2:00:50] are you you want some prophetic advice
[2:00:52] you say preacher this ain't going on
[2:00:54] well hold on the devil will try so i'm
[2:00:55] going to equip you right now by the word
[2:00:57] how to defeat that devil when he rears
[2:00:59] his ugly head the best thing to do is
[2:01:02] have a spiritual operation
[2:01:08] preaching now the best thing to do is
[2:01:11] have a spiritual operation you say what
[2:01:13] is it he said first it's a spirit then
[2:01:16] it forms a teeny little cell of its own
[2:01:20] it forms a little teeny cell of its own
[2:01:23] so it pulls away from the body and says
[2:01:25] this is the direction we're going to go
[2:01:27] i could call the big words he said and
[2:01:29] no one knows it's happening
[2:01:32] come on church no one knows it the sale
[2:01:35] the spirit comes in it finds a bruce
[2:01:38] sail it attaches itself and then it
[2:01:40] begins to feed on other backslidden
[2:01:43] sails and no one knows it's happening
[2:01:46] until the spirit rears its head he said
[2:01:48] the little cell is born and it must be
[2:01:50] fed he said another cell breaks out and
[2:01:52] another cell breaks out and another cell
[2:01:54] breaks out and after a while cell on
[2:01:56] sale on sale and tumor cataract whatever
[2:01:59] it may be it grows bigger and bigger and
[2:02:02] bigger and bigger larger spreading out
[2:02:04] more sales the first thing you know it

[2:02:29] liberty out of a church a spirit will
[2:02:32] climb down the atmosphere come on now
[2:02:35] that's what the prophet of god said he
[2:02:37] said but here's what we need is a
[2:02:39] spiritual operation he said the best
[2:02:41] thing to do is have a spiritual
[2:02:43] operation for the word of god is quick
[2:02:46] and powerful and sharper than any
[2:02:48] two-edged sword he said pierce and even
[2:02:50] to the dividing asunder of soul and
[2:02:53] spirit and a joint and admiral and is a
[2:02:56] discerner of the false and intense lord

[2:07:47] hallelujah
[2:07:49] hallelujah what are you saying preacher
[2:07:52] i'm trying to close by saying what a
[2:07:54] prophet said
[2:07:55] he said this little temporary suffering
[2:07:56] that we go through
[2:07:58] it's not worthy to be compared
[2:08:02] are you ready for this
[2:08:03] to the tremendous glory
[2:08:06] that will be revealed in us
[2:08:08] when he comes
[2:08:10] for i reckon
[2:08:11] that the sufferings
[2:08:13] of this present time
[2:08:15] are not worthy
[2:08:20] to be compared
[2:08:23] with the glory amen
[2:08:27] it'll be revealed
[2:08:29] in grace tabernacle
[2:08:32] now
[2:08:35] i can say it to you like this and i'm
[2:08:37] done
[2:08:39] the line affliction
[2:08:43] cannot compare
[2:08:46] for our live affliction which is but for
[2:08:48] a moment
[2:08:51] amen
[2:08:54] are you hearing me
[2:08:56] i'm preaching to you
[2:08:57] you got to get your focus off the
[2:08:59] suffering
[2:09:00] you got to get your focus off the
[2:09:02] affliction because the light affliction
[2:09:04] that worketh but for a moment
[2:09:11] are you willing
[2:09:13] are you willing
[2:09:15] to change your focus
[2:09:16] let me ask you this what are you going
[2:09:18] to pay attention to the light affliction
[2:09:21] that worketh but for a moment
[2:09:24] or this
[2:09:25] the exceeding
[2:09:27] eternal
[2:09:29] far more exceeding
[2:09:31] an eternal weight of glory
[2:09:34] while we look under the things which are
[2:09:35] seen
[2:09:36] but at the things which are not seen
[2:09:39] for the things which are not seen
[2:09:43] for the things which are seen are
[2:09:44] temporal
[2:09:46] but the things
[2:09:48] which are not seen
[2:09:50] they are eternal
[2:09:52] are you hearing me
[2:09:54] no matter what it looks like here
[2:09:58] can i have five minutes no matter what
[2:10:00] it looks like here somebody say here
[2:10:03] we don't look at what we see
[2:10:06] we look at what we don't see
[2:10:08] come on now he says colossians 1 15 who
[2:10:11] is the image of the invisible god the
[2:10:13] firstborn of every creature for by him
[2:10:15] are all things created that are in
[2:10:17] heaven and that are in the earth visible
[2:10:19] and invisible whether they are thrones
[2:10:21] dominions principalities powers all
[2:10:24] things were created by him and for him
[2:10:27] you know what that word visible means it
[2:10:29] means open to view
[2:10:32] you know what invisible means it means
[2:10:34] the thing which is unseen or cannot be
[2:10:37] seen by the natural eye invisible
[2:10:39] problem says look at the unseen when a
[2:10:41] man once catches the vision
[2:10:45] i'm closing right here when a man once
[2:10:47] catches the vision of the invisible god
[2:10:51] and so god and knows that he's always
[2:10:55] present
[2:10:56] there is something that stabilizes that
[2:10:59] man's thinking it stabilizes his actions
[2:11:02] and in the time of distress and troubles
[2:11:05] it'll still make him look upward and
[2:11:07] above the things that are happening
[2:11:09] around him because he's looking at the
[2:11:11] unseen yet by promise abraham not only
[2:11:15] did he see the unseen and the reason he
[2:11:17] believed it was because god said it and
[2:11:19] if we being dead in christ we are
[2:11:22] abraham's seed and if the spirit that
[2:11:24] was in christ dwells in us it does the
[2:11:27] same thing it takes every divine promise
[2:11:29] of god that's in the bible and calls it
[2:11:33] present tense and rest itself upon there
[2:11:37] come on church we are in possession
[2:11:39] we're not going to be we are right now
[2:11:42] this morning in possession of divine
[2:11:45] promises that were born in the unseen
[2:11:48] world you say the unseen world there's
[2:11:50] two worlds there's the seed world and
[2:11:52] there's the unseen world the problem of
[2:11:54] god said like this he said well there is
[2:11:56] no vision that people perish even notice
[2:11:58] that word vision means divine
[2:12:00] communication it means prophecy in other
[2:12:02] words a vision causes you i promise you
[2:12:05] i'm closing right here a vision causes
[2:12:08] you to be in two worlds at the same time
[2:12:13] a vision causes you to be in two worlds
[2:12:17] at the same time he said you're in this
[2:12:19] world here now yet you're in another
[2:12:22] world and you're speaking over there
[2:12:24] knowing that your voice is being heard
[2:12:27] back here
[2:12:29] then pray tell me where was this message
[2:12:31] coming from it was coming from an unseen
[2:12:34] world by a son of

[2:12:42] from the earth it was coming from the
[2:12:44] unseen world

[2:12:50] explain the word but you have to receive
[2:12:51] the word oh hallelujah that sets you to
[2:12:54] fire brother when you receive it

[2:13:00] revelation he says something slips out
[2:13:03] yonder of the unseen world and comes

[2:13:59] these people to rejoice and express
[2:14:01] themselves in an emotional way it's not

[2:14:51] it's a charge
[2:15:05] that's what it is
[2:15:06] it's the dynamics
[2:15:08] coming to the mechanics
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:14] it's a charge
[2:15:24] you see when that intellectual faith
[2:15:25] comes down in your heart
[2:15:27] and becomes
[2:15:28] so charged
[2:15:31] with the unseen world
[2:15:34] i got a whole other message right there
[2:15:35] i can't preach
[2:15:37] i ain't got time to get into it
[2:15:41] it's an unseen world
[2:15:43] [Music]
[2:15:51] i said to you like this
[2:15:54] brother paul is the bride of jesus
[2:15:55] christ
[2:15:58] it's time for us
[2:16:00] to quit imagining
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:13] we are
[2:16:15] the reality
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:36] brother paul
[2:16:37] your ministry is the reality
[2:16:40] of what a king sword coming to a
[2:16:42] prophet's
[2:16:43] hand amen young lady you're the reality
[2:16:48] the word in action
[2:16:50] [Music]
[2:16:55] [Music]
[2:17:00] you're a twofold man
[2:17:03] the problem of god said you're a twofold
[2:17:04] man
[2:17:05] he said
[2:17:06] if you've got the holy spirit in you
[2:17:09] i mean it's got the holy spirit
[2:17:12] can i tell you what the prophet said
[2:17:14] he said then you are a candidate for
[2:17:17] association with the unseen world
[2:17:22] and supernatural
[2:17:24] no wonder people can't believe in those
[2:17:25] things they've never come in contact
[2:17:28] they got nothing in here to believe with
[2:17:31] are you ready for this but when the holy
[2:17:34] spirit comes into the heart
[2:17:36] quickly
[2:17:37] quickly
[2:17:38] he becomes then a twofold being
[2:17:43] one
[2:17:44] of the earth
[2:17:46] one of the earth
[2:17:48] and one of the heaven to live
[2:17:51] in his body
[2:17:53] he's still subject to death
[2:17:55] but in his soul
[2:17:57] he's passed from death into life
[2:18:00] in his body he has earthly contact with
[2:18:03] his five senses in his spirit he has a
[2:18:05] contact with god through the holy ghost
[2:18:08] and the angels of god visits them
[2:18:12] and speaks with them
[2:18:14] and they are messengers sent from god to
[2:18:17] reveal and bring the messages from god
[2:18:19] to the individual
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:27] brother paul it's the greater works of
[2:18:28] john 14.
[2:18:30] problems in a prayer line he says this
[2:18:32] is he said these things
[2:18:34] these things what i do show you also
[2:18:36] then is god's sworn covenant true
[2:18:39] is his sworn covenant true
[2:18:41] then what have we got to be worried
[2:18:43] about
[2:18:44] jesus is here
[2:18:48] his spirit is here
[2:18:51] don't you love how he says things
[2:18:53] he said what happened just now
[2:18:55] i went into another world
[2:18:58] brother paul what happened to you a few
[2:19:00] moments ago you went into another world
[2:19:03] he said we become so conscious of
[2:19:06] looking at one another like this but
[2:19:07] there's an unseen world and it's greater
[2:19:10] than anything you see here and here's
[2:19:13] christ
[2:19:18] do you feel that charge
[2:19:22] when things get so bad
[2:19:24] you can't even lift up your head
[2:19:27] and then all of a sudden
[2:19:29] you say praise the lord
[2:19:32] where'd that charge come from
[2:19:35] an unseen world

[2:36:07] trust the lord hallelujah
[2:36:10] if i could just have one more moment
[2:36:13] this struck me brother andrew
[2:36:16] something i read
[2:36:18] when he was talking about the naval
[2:36:22] [Music]
[2:36:27] in the days of old
[2:36:28] the sailing ships
[2:36:30] [Music]
[2:36:34] when they faced a storm
[2:36:39] i hope you get this
[2:36:41] when they face the storm
[2:36:44] [Music]
[2:36:45] they had
[2:36:46] no other alternative
[2:36:49] but to take down the sails
[2:36:51] and hide
[2:36:54] in the belly
[2:36:55] of the ship
[2:36:57] [Music]
[2:36:59] but god come and said i've got a new
[2:37:00] horizon for you
[2:37:04] got a new horizon for you what i want
[2:37:06] you to do is i want you to climb
[2:37:09] get up to the top of the sail
[2:37:11] [Music]
[2:37:12] and as a prophet went through those
[2:37:14] struggles of his life
[2:37:16] god comes to him
[2:37:18] and speaks
[2:37:20] and he said
[2:37:22] path
[2:37:23] the future
[2:37:25] is clear
[2:37:28] come on saints don't go down in the
[2:37:30] belly of the ship and hope you survive
[2:37:32] laodicea climb up the sail look to the
[2:37:35] horizon we've got a new horizon and we
[2:37:37] can look across there and say i see the
[2:37:40] way is clear before us
[2:37:42] why because we've risen oh i hope you
[2:37:44] get this we haven't hunkered down in
[2:37:46] laodicea but we climbed up in heavenly
[2:37:49] places we climbed up in the presence of
[2:37:52] almighty god and there in the presence
[2:37:55] of god you can look beyond the horizon
[2:37:58] of the atomic bomb and the economics and
[2:38:00] the destruction that satan's wreaking in
[2:38:03] and family we can look at that and say
[2:38:05] the clear it is clear my future amen
[2:38:09] saints our families it's clear before us
[2:38:12] why because we're no longer earthbound
[2:38:15] in the belly of a ship
[2:38:17] but we are climbed up into heavenly
[2:38:19] places and can look
[2:38:20] across the horizon
[2:38:22] and see what god had in store what has
[2:38:24] god got in store for saints
[2:38:27] oh the prophet of god said you ever come
[2:38:29] into that position this bible will
[2:38:31] become a brand new book to you
[2:38:35] it's time for us to let that happen
[2:38:38] oh hallelujah brother andrew could
[2:38:39] preach i think there's some anointing
[2:38:41] behind this pulpit
[2:38:42] oh my oh my oh my come on saints
[2:38:45] look
[2:38:47] one more thing i want to comment on
[2:38:49] [Music]
[2:38:51] now don't take this as i'm countering
[2:38:53] what brother andrew said because i'm not
[2:38:55] at all
[2:38:57] but we can look at that
[2:38:58] painting
[2:39:00] that picture i mean not painting the
[2:39:02] picture on the wall
[2:39:05] the parents
[2:39:07] if your children don't see christ in you
[2:39:12] you can hang every picture you want on
[2:39:14] every wall you can have a bible in every
[2:39:16] room you can play a tape in every room
[2:39:18] you can do all these things but they've
[2:39:20] got to be able to see christ in you and
[2:39:22] i
[2:39:24] if it's not showing there it won't
[2:39:26] matter how many church services we take
[2:39:28] them to
[2:39:29] but young people i want to speak to you
[2:39:33] just because you see mom and dad and
[2:39:34] you're discouraged of something maybe
[2:39:36] that you see is failure
[2:39:38] it's not an excuse
[2:39:40] not excuses brother andrew
[2:39:42] god called you
[2:39:44] you're not here by accident
[2:39:46] you're not here to become satan's cannon
[2:39:48] fodder
[2:39:49] you're here to be sons and daughters of
[2:39:51] god pursue and experience yourself
[2:39:55] pursue the presence of almighty god
[2:39:58] learn to invite god yourself it's not
[2:40:00] complicated all you got to do is take
[2:40:02] that moment and say lord go with me
[2:40:04] today lord guide me today protect me
[2:40:07] today
[2:40:08] and speak it in the name of jesus
