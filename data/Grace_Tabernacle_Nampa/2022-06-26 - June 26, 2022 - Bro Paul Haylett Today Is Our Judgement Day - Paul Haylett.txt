if there's anything that's going to stand in the way of a healing think of ifa think of this family i want you to ask for forgiveness lord before brother david comes this assembly we've bowed our heads i don't know why i feel so strongly about this we're playing the song that your prophet would always play because that's all he asked us to do was just to believe so lord if there's anything in this assembly that would hinder the moving of your holy spirit and i put myself there and i prayed it this morning forgive us lord we want nothing to stand in your way just give you thank you david [Music] let's bow our heads in this presence lord we are bowing our heads in the presence of the king of kings the redeemer the lord of hosts which is in our midst now and lord if we know that and i know there's those here that realize that lord then what manner of people are we to be even in our thoughts right now even in our motives our objectives and father as you said it's only not added to the word nothing taken from the word but to only believe [Music] lord nothing can stand before that word nothing can will stand against it for in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word is made flesh among us today and now lord we stand here with that greatest love story which is because you first loved us that's why we love you and lord we stand upon the basis of that love knowing that love shall never fail and when that love is projected by a word it has to come to pass it's projected through faith lord in the word and we stand here as believers redeemed by the blood having that possession in our hearts now to speak deliverance to every one of these requests lord there's so many to mention but you've heard them every one of them knew they would be written know they would be spoken and now we bring these things before you with an assurance that whatsoever things you desire when you pray you shall wreak havoc and lord on the basis of that word i'm asking you to meet every one of these requests those traveling those that are sick those that are troubled lord we stand here on the basis of your word declaring we are victorious and have victory through your faith in that word now lord god we say it's been done we commit every one of these to you the family the holman family brie and her children and her husband every one of these lord our brother this brother coming from ukraine sister tamara sister sharon every one of these that lord maybe can't remember i can't but they are remembered here this morning and now lord we say with thanksgiving we ask for thy perfect will and every one of these to be ministered and met now lord we're expecting to receive from you this morning to hear you speak through humanist vessel we are going out of here raised to a higher plane we are here to receive the word we are not here we have not been ordained to receive a voice contrary to the word but the word voice as it comes to your servant we are here to receive that voice now father with thanksgiving we say it's been done we're thankful that you've given us victory already we're thankful that lord we can see ourselves before the foundation of the world and know by revelation who we are where we've come from who we are and where we're going and we thank you for this lord we give you praise now expecting to be corrected expecting to receive life and strength and continued revelation as we call upon you for revelation of your word in jesus christ's name we pray and say amen because we believe it's done amen amen you may have your seats amen as we get ready to turn the service for the paul i want us to sing this song is as a confession it's already done amen amen 11 95 it's already done oh it's already done oh the battle is over the victory is one it's already done sing it again [Music] is over victory is one it's already done [Music] oh i'm already sick yes i'm already seen [Music] oh the battle is over victory's been won i'm already sealed my family see you though my family [Music] is sick oh the battle is over victory is one my family is i'll confess that i'm already [Music] the battle is over the victory's been won i'm already here we're confessing and this morning it's already done [Music] oh it's already done [Music] the battle is over the victory's been warning oh it's already done hallelujah [Music] it's already done [Music] oh it's already done is over and the victory is one it's already done let somebody lift a hand and say amen thank you lord this battle is over hallelujah the devil's trying to tell you that it's just started but the lord is saying it is over amen claim it what you have need of today claim it hallelujah hallelujah oh beautiful you know when things good things are going to happen saints you can always be assured that the devil will show up on the scene and do his very best to discourage you and to take away the freedom that god desired for you every day of your life but even this morning amen the devil would come and try to fuss and fight and stress and strain but you see that's already behind us that's already finished because we're believers of the promise amen we're not believers of the circumstance we're believers of the promise hallelujah and look look what satan did at cadiz barnea he got israel to look at the circumstance and they forgot to look at the promise and look what it cost them oh my let's look at the promise today hallelujah you know i want to just start off to say uh i was very thankful sister dorcas shared a little text with me amen we won't go in the details but answered prayer sometimes circumstance would be such that you look and you think okay it wouldn't make sense that that the people would make decisions like this and it's that but you have to just say well okay lord i give it to your hands and then we don't stress and strain over what the result will be because we know according to the word whatever the result is whether we like it or not is for our benefit but we praise the lord today for an answered prayer amen hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah and you say well brother paul these might be just natural things my brother and sister god cares about your natural things amen let's just remember brother trevor and sister kerry as they're down fellowshipping and uh uh with brother prashant sister akoncha you know i know the last time they were down there brother trevor made a comment on the order of might i have this exactly he so we went down there to encourage uh brother pershant and sister akancha and found them encouraging us that's what it's like to come together in the body of believers amen to to each one of us just come together to be encouraged by one another amen it's good to see each and every one of you every brother every sister amen this morning i want to just speak to you today on today is our judgment day and uh you know this could take a deal of uh you know y'all a bunch of sinners you better judge yourself but you know the thing is is there's so much that goes into what judgment is to a son or daughter of god you know one of the most important things and if the lord would will i want to hit this today is the fact that we would come and judge ourselves by the word and then take what the word said about you amen if we're guilty then say lord forgive me i'm guilty lord forgive me if the word says you're worthy accept god's judgment if the word says that you are healed accept your healing if it says you're delivered except your deliverance if it says that you have been set free if it says that the yoke of bondage has been broken then rejoice in the lord that the yoke is broken amen because the devil will be here just on the opposite side oh sometimes he uses flattery i read a little quotation a few days ago it says and i don't remember all the things that it said so i won't try to do it but it said if the devil can't get you this way and he can't get you this way and he can't get you like this he'll resort to flattery well i'll tell you what i believe in flattery because there is a positive note to flattery you might say oh my your dress is nice it's beautiful your hair is done beautifully those kind of things speak fact though flattery is when we're trying to cover the other story with flowers and get you to accept it amen let's turn our bibles today first peter the fourth chapter once again god bless you to each and every one that's here today amen first peter the fourth chapter now i love this scripture because it really covers a very very broad spectrum uh as this is laid out and first peter 4 12 to start and i think as we start this such a beautiful start you know if you've ever seen people in track or whatever it is and and the pistol is there and they're in the chalks ready to run and the gun goes off and you start to run now i would just say this is a great position to run from beloved think it not strange in other words don't let something be brought up in your mind god doesn't love me why me what is this circumstance i thought being a christian would be like this think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you no strange thing has happened to you saints i believe every one of us today would say well life has given us some very serious turns but it wasn't strange to god especially and if we're prayed up and we're in the presence of god we're committed to serve him you'll find it's not strange either because god will show you the direction he wants you to go i'll try not to preach all of this scripture but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy if he be pro re be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified now i want you to understand here i'm this is not our thought but i want to express this to you it says on their part he is evil spoken of do you know my brother and sister the prophet of god said that anyone who steps out of this word and takes this word as a contrary is speaking illegal ill of the word of god so they come and false teachers they are speaking ill of god amen men perverting wolf and sheep's clothing perverting the word of god they're speaking ill so you see right there my brother and sister that sometimes things come to pass in the word we don't even give it a thought but on your part he is glorified can someone say amen this morning but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a bitty busybody in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf now here again i want to hit on this look my brother and sister sometimes in life people come along and say well this and this and this happen they must have done something that displeased god they must have been out of the will of god and they are judging this situation not knowing oh they might know the circumstance but they don't know the mind of god and god says you need to go through this fiery trial you need to go through something that others think there must be something behind but god says no i am molding character and i am burning out the dross and so then god allows you to go through that oh if we're not careful we get cold and indifferent to these things because we believe god really doesn't care that much amen for the time has come could this be the time this morning saints for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if first began at us look at this god put you right at the head of the line amen you see god didn't go judge the world first my brother and sister god's word has judged the bride first and when he declared that the bride has passed the test and the character is molded it doesn't matter what anyone else says because god is our highest authority and so when we come in that position we look now any man who would glory in seeing the world judge for its position needs to go back to the altar it shouldn't break or heart saints it should cause us to be in travail as the scripture says to sigh and cry for those abominations done in the city we should be sawing and crying amen that's what we should be doing for the time has come that judgment judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved there where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god wherefore let them are any of them here yes sir wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god amen what a tremendous difference yes sir humanity can suffer and it not be the will of god you know what we spoke wednesday we make decisions if we don't weigh what the result of the decision will be before we make the finality of the decision don't act shocked when your decision doesn't yield the result you desire that's why the prophet of god said pray through word of god says pray through find the mind of god find the will of god but we just you know walk into sportsmans and knives are on sale so if one's good two ought to be better three is great four is over the top five your credit card's declined and then we wonder what's going on pray through saints don't take a step before you have prayed through yes sir amen amen i love to sorry to distract you heavenly father lord we just ask you lord today to bless the word lord just touch the hearts of your saints father make the word so real to us lord that the world just disappears behind us lord as we press to the mark of the high calling in christ jesus we thank you today lord we thank you for answered prayers and we thank you for the faith to claim the promise lord just move us forward i pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen don't want to get distracted today saints that's why i cut that off amen now look at this as we look at this scripture i i really my initial focus is on verse 17 that uh judgment uh the time has come that judgment must begin in the house of god and you know some people would take this word it's interesting how people's reactions are some people would take this word judgment and they would say yep sure enough the preacher preaching is judging me but really my brother and sister the whole premise of the word of god is not that someone else would judge you and this may seem a little strange to you so please give me a little grace uh here for just a moment but you see it's not that the preacher would judge you and it's not even that the word of god would judge you because the word has showed us very clearly we need to judge ourselves we need to be the one who is reading the word studying the word and then bringing us into a position that we look in the word and say you know what thank you lord i feel you know i feel free i feel liberty or look at the word and say you know there's something pain pinging my heart to say lord i need to up my game and you know forgive me today saints i'll say it this way to you most of us need to up our game amen but god's doing this in such a way he's not here to condemn us he's here just simply to encourage us or strengthen us to move forward and so it's that we come into the house of god now god would cause you to look in your own life anywhere you might be on the face of the earth but the word says that as we see the time or the season approaching do not forsake the assembling of yourselves together because we need the atmosphere we need the moving of god we need rubbing shoulders with saints of like precious faith to to keep that encouragement going because you see the word also warned us that if we were not careful we would become weary in well-doing and the word also declared to us said that there will come a time that if god would not shorten time that all flesh would be lost so we're recognizing my brother and sister not the fact that god would fail we're looking at the fact that our flesh would fail that we would become weary and worn down and that we would look at the things and say i don't believe that this can happen people say i don't know that i can be healed i have been sick for so long well maybe the moment of your healing will come in the moment of your confession that your god is more than able amen because if you look at yourself and you look at your circumstance you will never have the strength to press on you know it's there you know we have lots of examples through the scripture and i just had a couple go through my head but we'll just step beyond that and keep moving forward but look at this as it is so if judgment is beginning in the house of god where will it finish in the house of god i am the alpha and omega so if god began to work in you he has come to finish that work he is not like us that start a project and then somehow the years slip by but god has a very set schedule that is working in your life and it's not upon our thinking but it's upon his plan amen and so it's there if the righteous scarcely be saved now this is not saying that it's coming down to the end and it's almost like fumbling out of god's fingers and he can't quite do it my brother and sister and at the last minute he saves it no sir this is a reflection as i said of the weakness or frailty of flesh and you see sometimes as things come you see like you have experience and watch people's lives on fire the fire cooling down the fire cooling down the fire cooling down the devil says you're not even a christian the truth is all they've got to do is stoke the fire it's not they've got to get saved again get baptized again go through everything again they just need to stoke the fire so what satan does is he fills our time up with enough things and enough stress and enough worries that we forget to stoke the fire and so you know what what sometimes coming into the house of god is people say well seems like the preachers you know they've always preached something before well i would dare to say that there is not one single scripture in this bible that has not been preached thousands of times but it's still alive it's still real and it's still doing the job if we'll allow it to so the issue is not the word that's preached the issue is the condition that we approach it in and so it is my brother and sister i'll say this to you today god did not call you to be mediocre god did not call you to lay down on the job god did not call you to wait till someone would come and bail you out god said i placed a seed in you and what i need you to do is have enough courage to stand up and lay as a worthy seems contradictory to stand up and lay down but to stand up and then lay down in the presence of the sun and allow the life that's in the sun to come in you god placed a lovely natural thing when we come and we were joking about this the other day brother jason's sister emmy and jerry and i how it is you know that's the poor people that live over on the coast some people like that some people love the rain but i happen to be addicted to vitamin d i'm a person that needs to be standing in the sun amen i don't need to be indoors i need to be in the presence of the sun are you with me amen i don't need a covering of some other form of variety i need the presence of the son amen so as you see what god is doing in us he's moving us to come into the correct position amen now let's look right here christ revealed in his own word he said how about a man writing of the greatest king that ever had here on earth as crowned king now let me just preface this for a second those of you are reading stop very rarely will you find someone placing themselves in the negative side of the story it wasn't my fault it was my wife's oh you were fighting yes but it wasn't my fault i thought i'd get an amen out of that how about a man writing of the greatest king that ever had here on earth as crown king david in his committing adultery hmm what those jews ever wrote of their most noble king being an adulteress oh we have history like george washington never told the lie see what brother brahm's doing he's saying look we we have our way of putting this george washington never told a lie george did you chop down the cherry tree no dad the acts did who is behind the axe george some hands is he never wanting to come to make the admission of our part of this oh we have history like george washington never told the lion things like that and we say call that history but this is a man a bible that calls david an adulteress and he was the king of israel an adulteress who was to be the son jesus to be the son of david the very headstone and his father according to the flesh was an adulteress jews would never wrote a book like that would man write this of his own self certainly not yeah right certainly not how would that proud nation of israel you know how proud they were proud nation of israel went and wrote about their own idolatry wrote about their own rebellion against their god wrote against the dirty filthy things that they did and wrote out in a book they have sure hid that they have just showed the good things but this bible that tells what's right and what's wrong it's anyone knows that the jews would never wrote a book like that about their own uncleanness and idolatry and failure and everything they had they'd had never wrote that oh no then who wrote it the bible said in hebrews 1 1 god in sundry times and divers manners spake to the fathers through the prophets then it wasn't the prophets it wasn't mortal god not prophets in sundry time but god in sundry time and divers manners spoke to the fathers through the promise through the prophets amen so you look at this and what we recognize my brother and sister this is not the nature of man to take our life and we would deem ourselves justified now you know i oftenly joke about that that men would have an attitude and they would sing their own version of the song i'm justified i'm justified they're not talking about god coming down and doing a mighty work in their life they're coming to a place that they are justifying their position and so it's in that justification we do this now have you ever noticed that when something happens in your life and you know you should go apologize oftentimes if you don't deal with it right away you will never deal with it if you're not moved on in the spirit to turn and go and say i am sorry then you will never deal with that because what happens the very nature of man starts to justify our own behavior justify the circumstance and why and we will then start you know as the insurance companies in the day and age we live in it is uh something that's you might say a relatively newer concept but they want to assign portions of blame so if you get in an auto accident literally they want to discount by about 20 percent the the issue right off the bat because you left the house that day in a car if you had not went to work you had not gone to the grocery store you had not went to whatever and you had left the car in the garage this accident would never happen therefore it's at least 20 25 percent your fault what are they doing justifying they're trying to take part of the blame from themselves and they're trying to push it over somewhere else now my brother and sister we can look at this and i hope you catch this this morning we can look at this in the spiritual realm and sometimes well anybody that's human please raise a hand today amen you know some of you won't lift a hand so therefore i'm suspect whether you're human or not but anyway you look at this and realize anyone that's human makes mistakes and so as we move through life what happens is my brother and sister we we come to where we kind of tend to justify certain things well they did this so i did this i reacted this way because of this and you see what it is that it is satan coming and he's trying to bring it to the place because the scripture shows us that without a full repentance not partial amen not assigning 25 to this one to that one and we'll blame the devil at least 50 percent but we you know no the thing is regardless of whether you got caught in a trap the devil set you up or not god is requiring a hundred percent confession of repentance he's not looking for something where the blame has been assigned a little here and a little there i reacted like i did because of what the wife did come on my brother and sister i reacted like this because of what the devil did we should outgrow that and i say lord help paul amen because there's a time that we must come and it is there i've seen a little quotation just in the last few days that it is our recognition and acceptance of who it is to blame is what brings us the ability to change it amen if you don't accept it you can't change it so this is the nature of man just what we see right here hide the rebellion boast of the charity had the faults boast of the good things now you see judgment beginning in the house of god is bringing us to a place that we have to stop and say okay i'm a part of this equation now look my brother and sister unless we get kind of sad looking here this morning and some of you are you have to recognize that the seed that god placed in you before the foundation of the world is the seed that will take you out of this world amen it is not the present circumstance it is not the present failures you don't need to assign blame you don't need to do what we need to do is learn to rebuke the devil stay with the word and stand on the promises of god because god's already said this work is finished that was a beautiful song to fit with our sermon today it's already done but you see as long as we are in a realm that we feel compelled to blame or to put it somewhere else we're actually oh i hope you get this we're actually judging them and not ourself god wants us to judge ourselves so if judgment begins in the house of god that means you must come in these doors to start judgment no sir the house of god is in you so it's there that we must come back and go back to the throne that god has called us to and that throne is not an altar somewhere we don't have a place that we call mecca it is a place that we come in our own life in our own play and come to the lord and say lord judge me lord clean me lord now look my brother and sister when we would come some people say well i don't want to ask the lord to judge me well i'm going to tell you until you come to the place that you ask god to judge you you'll never change because you and your flesh are not compelled to judge yourself you and your flesh are not compelled to accept your own weakness or failure it is christ in you and the more that you come in the presence of god we start to judge ourselves now just speaking to this young lady here the last few days i asked her i said would you please just go back examine your life you want to see your son stay healed i mean you want to see him heal now go back in your own life and start going through your life and lay it before the lord and so in that realm right there we're not condemning we're not judging because you see it's the individual affair people say well i heard the preacher preach and he judged me no you didn't hear the preacher judge you you heard your own conscience convicting you amen because if a man has the ability to bring a conviction in your heart as a man then imagine the power that we would have over humanity we would just simply hand out conviction everywhere and as it would be with good intention everyone would be saved but you see it's the word of god that has the power to bring conviction and causes us to judge now so we don't want to hide our rebellion and boast of our charity now i want to look back for just a minute in the book of esther if you don't mind we won't turn to it but you see haman has such a clever plan that he is actually coming to the king in such a fashion and it makes it look as though that by destroying the jews he is doing a favor or a blessing for the king he's now placed it in such a way that if i was to clean the kingdom out of the with these rebellious people that you know a little money involved a little ring to mark a signet to seal it all and and it's like i'm doing good now look at the devil he's taken this approach that by weeding out and pointing out the faults of the people that he is kind of presenting it as though i i am i'm doing god a favor and so it's in that realm he brings people to the point that then they become under a judgmental spirit believing they're doing god's business when they point out everyone's faults oh you see where that spirit comes from god help us we probably all had it on us at one time or another but look at that now see so as satan's making it look like that by putting out uh showing everyone's deal i want to just be redundant here that we're doing he was doing a favor to the king in reality he had a great bitterness or hatred for mordecai now there's a lot of jews as it were in the kingdom he'd never met but because mordecai was a jew and he disliked mordecai so much he was then going to exact judgment now my brother and sister there's a lot of christians the devil's never met you're probably wondering what in the world did paul just say well that's all another sermon but my brother and sister i can take you right in the word of god and show you that until you come from under cover until you climb out of the bush or the closet or the whatever you've been hiding in the devil doesn't even know you're a christian you see you're a christian when you stand up and you actually do something when you stand for the word amen that is people say do something i'll be a missionary i'll be there no stand up and stand for the word that's when the satan starts to fight you you realize many a individual that has said for years i'm a christian i'm a christian and their life is good nothing no problems everything just goes along real great well my brother and sister the devil's not bothering them because they've never made a stand but the minute you stand up and start fighting back and getting in out of flesh and blood and into the spiritual warfare the devil is going to throw every hand grenade in hell at you because when you start to manifest the fact that i really am going to live the word then he gets nervous then he gets concerned then he challenges you then he tries to undermine you then he assaults you face to face it's then that he does that but as long as you're just in hibernation you know i got some good friends that own orchards my friend dar he's like you know paul he was actually speaking to us to me you know that little cherry tree you got in your yard paul yeah i don't like people like you really door he said yeah because people like you don't realize there's a problem with the pest until the pest is already a problem and as an orchard as they go and spray crop oil and that smothers a lot of those larvae that are laying up in the trees and when the oil gets in there it blocks off the oxygen and that see the time to treat the past is before it comes to maturity because when it comes to maturity the way you have to treat the pest then it's not you might say acceptable can i put that in terms of the church sometimes when there's an outbreak in the church and the past starts to show up then you have to go in there almost toxically and deal with it and then the people who are innocent are saying why am i being sprayed as it were with all of this forceful and powerful and cutting and whatever it is you don't realize see the pest wasn't dealt with and that's why god wants us to continually in our own life i used as a church concept there but in our own life god doesn't want it to wait until it has become a full-blown pest in our life god wants us to deal with it early and if we'll go and judge ourselves and it's hard saints look let's admit it it's hard stand in the mirror of god's word and accept the fact that you have deficiency in your life and it's just kind of like well but but our response is i i know we've used this a time but i've been a christian for a certain amount of time i've been say i've been in message for this or i've had the holy ghost none of those words are relevant if you haven't dealt with the past if you haven't stopped and examined and went through every portion of your life to deal with that past then it doesn't matter what you declare against it amen i tell you sister jerry and i down in south america as the brothers they're kind of a little bit of edge to their voice i said wow we were in the grocery store i said this to a brother i said we're in the grocery store and we went to buy a couple apples and boy they all look like they've been beat up and stuff and the brother looks at me and goes that's because we sent the good stuff to you oh excuse me but you see my brother and sister that apple with those little scrapes and dents it's just as new that is just as good so god's not even looking for the christian without a mark or a scuff upon him god's looking for the christian that's willing to give himself willing to receive of the word so i just want to i just want to point this back saints satan wants it make it look like us pointing out everyone's failures that we're doing a favor to the king but actually we're doing satan a favor amen not only does it undermine us but it undermines everyone who hears those words and the individual being spoken of now look my brother and sister going still on this thought from esther during this time i type haman as satan here but during this time satan is declaring our faults before the throne you know you take uh you take the examples of scripture and and job you know uh uh job had no clue saints that that satan was there having that conversation with god and he had no clue that god was saying oh here no problem i'll open the hedge and in that what did his friends do they started to judge him they said well you have a secret sin job there must be something in your life you have done wrong even his own wife said you know why don't you why don't you just curse god and die now my brother and sister this you say well i read that and it's just so horrible but do you know that spirit is still alive in the 21st century and it's a time that people come and the thing is is we need to look to god's will in our life and judge ourselves in the mirror of god's word and maybe not look at everyone else quite so much now i'm not talking about gross sin coming in the church that's why i was talking earlier we have to make sure that we treat this so that gross sin doesn't come in the church but sometimes our weaknesses now i know most of us including myself okay we have a real hard time confessing our faults one to another when people start standing up and i i've been there actually sister jerry's in the service but she might not have heard the words but to see you know a family come up you know to the brother that ministered and just to pour out everything i mean they hung their laundry to the wind that day and people would be oh i couldn't do that but you would if the seed inside you was trying to push out if the seed inside you said i must live i must get in the presence of the sun then it is in those cases that one is able to then just bear their soul and to pour it out you see it's that that god brings us to sometimes we need to come to a time that shame has no value our reproach of our own reputation has no value how people would think and speak and whatever of us means nothing to us any longer because we must get in the presence of the son we judge ourselves needy of god more than media of reputation of the flesh but so many times the moving of the holy spirit is stopped because people would say what will people think that's exactly right what do people think what will they think what do you care amen i mean when it comes to the time that we're judged of the word and here's the bus going to hell you're not going to be excited that they congratulate you to be on that bus but the harder battle the harder fight is to find under the banner that god has given you amen not just as a christian that's valuable we are christians but to be able to stand and say i am blood bought i have been committed and purchased by jesus christ i am his own i am his bride i belong to him and the world today increasingly doesn't like that they've watered that down that everything's a christian that's right you know the devil's pretty sly old guy isn't he get us to do his work for him reminds me years ago i think that was like what is it tom sawyer or whatever is that right huckleberry finn whatever tom sawyer huckleberry finn you know here why don't you paint while i tell you this story why don't you do this while i tell you about that i'll give you a nickel or something for this and you know in the end what was always getting someone else to do the work and the devil has come down and many times we say well we want to keep division out of the church we want to keep spirits out of the church the devil doesn't come in my brother and sister and do that we haul him in we let him in we bring him with us we're supposed to be coming to the house of god and bringing the spirit of christ with us bringing the holy ghost fire with us instead we come in the house of god doing the devil's work for him and i say god forgive us god forgive us and it comes in these little things my brother and sister little things it's not the big things it's the little things amen i say let this judgment first begin at us right for the time has come i like verse 17 for the time is come amen maybe there was a season that there wasn't but the time is come and if there was ever a season that we ought to be getting ourselves clean righteous and holy before the lord this is the season my brother and sister the word says we would come to a time and a place that we would loathe even the dirt as it were on the hymn of our garment much less anywhere else god help us that we would come to a place that even the hymn of our garment is cleansed before the lord i say lord help me this morning help me this morning amen hallelujah you know we can declare satan bound just as much as we want we can pray the prayer we bind you satan in the name of jesus christ seven sons of siva found out that didn't work so good they thought that merely mouthing the words would be sufficient to bind the devil but mouthing the words my brother and sister is something anyone can do but a son or daughter of god filled with the holy ghost is there any in our house this morning hallelujah amen but the real binding comes when we bring ourselves in subjection to the word and when we're in subjection to the word and we bind satan he's bound satan cannot overcome the word the word is so more powerful than the devil in his minion but if we are not subjected to the word then we are mouthing words just like those seven sons of siva god help us you see the word over and over i've just touched upon these things lightly here but the word here my brother and sister shows us over and over again we must place ourselves in the correct position you want to get results you got to be in the correct position amen hallelujah hallelujah jesus keeps all of his appointments and he took the note and read it and we find out that this is talking about jesus and we find out that this certain pharisee hatter was making a feast and had bid him to come down and be a guest of honor with him so jesus standing for a few moments and looking at the young man the one that brought the invitation and yet as busy as he was but you can never invite him but what he'll come can someone say amen to that we invite our lord jesus on the scene he will sir that's come right yet as busy as he was but you can never invite him but what he'll come i don't care what the situation is he'll come and he said you tell your master that i'll be there on this certain day at this certain time i'll be there and the courier must have smiled satisfied and turned away and run off down the hill to take the good news back to his master that he had succeeded in getting the message to the one that he wanted what was the matter with that courier how could it be was he conscious of what he had done the first time maybe in his life that he ever stood in the presence of jesus and never even asked forgiveness of his sins he never took the opportunity that's the same way with people today many times they realize that they're in his presence and they never ask forgiveness that's right see this is why judgment is not placed is i got to be in the church as it were the judgment is not placed i must be under a certain ministry i must be here it has to be this it is when we come in his presence we should ask him to judge our life and be able to say lord i feel your presence that's why sometimes saints the presence of god we would acknowledge right here in this church and say god is here we feel his presence but we'll walk out with the same bitter spirit we walked in with we walk out with the same insecurity and fear we walked in with and we say we were in his presence today that's the moment that we should surrender lift our hands and say oh lord forgive me lord cleanse my heart lord make my life to be the image of what you want it to be but instead come on saints i'm speaking truth to you instead we just sit there with these spirits on us and base in the presence hey isn't this so wonderful god is here god is here god is here and we walk out with the same issues in our lives heaven help us right when his presence comes that's the time to stop and say lord judge me judge me lord that i would see my faults and my failures i don't need the preacher to call my name i don't need someone to say i have a prophecy over you we can just come in that present and say lord forgive me amen that's right wash me lord [Applause] exactly right oh hallelujah hallelujah amen realize they're in his presence never ask forgiveness well he maybe never presented the opportunity another time and turned down his last opportunity to ask forgiveness amen how could he have ever done that how could this boy ever been so wrapped up in bringing this message amen pray for the preacher yes sir pray for the preacher he brings a message but that doesn't mean he's always in the right spirit the right attitude dealing with little things in his own life that he can't bear them out because he's the preacher but the one bringing the message do you follow me the one bringing this message from his master that he failed in the presence of the son of god to ask forgiveness it was all a business affair oh my goodness when did church that's it what's on the right one i've got lost here business fair that's right okay sorry and you know that's something like the people today church christ has become a business affair or a social affair a joined church and just get a little better social standing for your business or something you sound a little better in the neighborhood you know this is where i put that thought that i shared with you earlier see it is there my brother and sister that we come sometimes and we'll find ourselves coming in this and we we are so worried about that right we hide the rebellion and we boast of the charity well my chur my business i mean you know we we gave 5 000 to the youth group i can tell you of a man and this sounds judgmental but i say this and it's factual and i can prove it a man in this city right here worth millions worth millions will cut you off at the knees in business but received a huge plaque and it's in their church to this day right now for repaving the parking lot and putting up new lights and everything worth hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars but i'll tell you got the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars by ripping off everyone he did business with and even in his own church people won't do business with him i'd rather be poverty-stricken have a broom and sweep the parking lot and be right with god than to give hundreds of thousands of dollars and have art and animosities and bitternesses with my fellow man that's exactly right amen stand out a little better in the neighborhood it isn't a thing of really coming and repenting like a sinner should do many times in church people are brought right in the presence of christ and turn away and do his rash a thing as his courier did oh he should have fell upon his knees when he first realized that it was it was who he was and saying master i have a message for you but first i want you to forgive me that would have been the right approach but then if there's any business to be done let that be done later but the first is get his own soul right with god and i want to put this right before you today you got a serious need in your life you need god to come and touch you financial marital spiritual physical whatever it is don't just approach god like it's a business fair now lord i need you to do this this this and this and lord if you come and you do that can you come over here and take care of this my brother and sister our first job is to get right in the presence of god and climb in there what did esther do before she went before her king she went and she washed herself come on she was preparing herself to meet the king she washed herself and then she wrapped herself in the royal garment which is the word of god and it wrapped in that word then she come and she didn't come to the throne and when he reached the scepter out to her and she touched it she didn't start right in now king you got this vicious dirty rotten guy here and you need to do this and you need to do that what did she do she loved him she loved him i want you my king to come into my part of the house right remember she had her place in the house you come and i want to prepare a meal for you now i say this jokingly but you don't see her getting on the door dash and saying doordash deliver some grapes a little pineapple let's see what else they like some cucumbers some dill no sir the word says she prepared now whether her hands in the natural actually cut up and did all of that or whether she was there to supervise sometimes our children don't really know how to reach out to the lord mama daddy you're the supervisor you're the supervisor preparing the atmosphere for god to come and do something supernatural oh help us help us if it's not for us then help us lord to be a good supervisor a good guide in this time hallelujah see we look at this my brother and sister there it is they come but first get his own soul right with god how that young man would have been so blessed amen so blessed the fetus said um i heard about you you're jesus and said it was like hey jesus here i got a message for you well i'm telling you my brother and sister god's the one that sends the message it's not man that sends the message it's god that sends the message we don't have a message for god we have petitions amen we share to our king are you with me today hallelujah oh my oh my so what happens people start declaring i bound the devil but because of their position the devil actually has bound them you know i love the word how it lays it out father teach us how to pray teach us how i think even today i found myself the other day saints a little stressful situation i found myself saying on the order of lord i need you to do this something checked in my heart said you are approaching god incorrectly first off lord i want to come to you correctly amen wash me lord let me come to you in the right way you're my king you're my lord you're my savior you're my all in all see what happened right there saints i'm not boasting on myself because i actually felt very checked in my heart i'm not boasting myself don't think that but you see the lord took me into the judgment seat and said you're not approaching me but because i love you as much as i love you i'm not going to just put you away i'm going to tell you and remind you and show you you're asking you're demanding your incentivized for me to do something for you without any praise any worship any love amen i'm telling you saints are you with me there's times it's hard to go into the judgment room there's times it's hard to have the the word of the lord come back to you and say you know you you're you're off base boy amen oh we don't like that we like god to just pour blessings out on us don't we amen okay hallelujah i am so lost whoa okay thank you brothers that's why i think so much healing becomes a failure or professed healing because the first place the people are not ready for healing they won't confess their wrongs i'm not speaking on this young lady that was here the other day but this is why you speak and say you know what please i didn't demand of her please go in your prayer closet your bedroom whatever it is get down before god and say lord cleanse me get me prepared lord i want to do the right thing that you would come and heal my son yes and i believe her heart her heart's desire is there amen the bible said confess your faults one to another and pray one for another one for the other and we're not willing to do that yes sir that's exactly right i know it's some boastful saints but you know why often times the close of a service i encourage you when you leave pray for one another because we got to break this barrier down we got to break this satan's there trying to put the the blocks up to get this that i go to church there and we fellowship and we do this but i kind of care less whether i'm with the saints or not i do my own thing no satan's building a fence for you amen come on we're not willing to do that if we can take the healing and go ahead and go back and do what he was doing they would accept that in other words i want to just come here preacher pray for me i want healed and i want to just go on and do my life oh no god wants something out of you amen he paid for you hallelujah he paid for you but when it comes to really first coming and getting right with god people don't want to do that that's the reason it throws a bad damper over divine healing you see so many people walk in line that walk in like that and walk out and don't and god knows all about those things amen oh yeah imagine people would be like i don't i don't think that that's real i never got healed i went there remember the man mocking said take that little girls how come he didn't volunteer his own hand or arm or whatever yeah why because he had not one drop of faith take that little girl and cut her and then heal her and i'll believe that's a devil that is a devil saints that's uh oh the man was a pastor he was a religious leader he was a devil he's tempting god he's he's wanting and so strong in his spirit of deceit and and what to come and he's wanting to do it if he was such but you see he had such a spirit it's just like he'll cut that little kid and it cost me nothing cost me nothing because it's not real well i tell you what my brother and sister that man will never ever with that spirit ever receive one blessing from god not going to happen right the right mental attitude it's not the focus on mental right like being a what they call mind reader or you know mental telepathy mind over matter it's that's not what it's talking about but the right mental in other words get your mind in the right place that my god is a healer my god is a deliverer my god is a provider and when we can wrap that around it and say i don't care what happens i have an unshakable faith in god that he is my healer and it's in that case that god can come on the scene why because all the doors are open amen reminds me one time a friend shared this a little trouble in their church and the man said well i guess pastor if you want to you can come over to my house he really wanted to see this man and his family back in church and he goes to the house all their vehicles are in the driveway rings the doorbell no one answers takes a liberty walking through the gate and walking around back maybe they're on the back porch no one there goes back to the front rings the doorbell calls the man's phone that's where the man messed up calls the man's phone and the phone's close enough to the door he can hear it ring no answer goes to voicemail and he thought i know god sent me here imagine what this would be like god sent me here i know what the human effect would be disappointment he said come and now he shut me out and he's like i know god set me here my knuckles hurt finding the man coming to the door says can't you leave me alone and he said you invited me here i changed my mind god didn't man let him in ultimately they gave their hearts back to the lord amen you see because they had gave them to almost everything else on earth this brother sharing this he told me this this couple had just built a ginormous house this is all in a matter of three months built a ginormous house oh let me give you a backstory the man had been praying god bless me please lord help me help me lord god knew what kind of test this man needed god blessed him his business quadrupled in size went went from just two or three million a year to like 12 15 million a year he built a big monster house and he bought a brand new absolute decked out ford f-350 with everything on it and bought a boat that was almost too big for the pickup to pull and a camp trailer and razors and this and that and everything it was and all new furniture and whatever else and the whole time is that a blessing i'll tell you what a blessing is is when god comes in your house and when the devil wants to attack your baby the angel of the lord stands in the way amen when the wheels are ready to fall off your car and god keeps them on it those are real blessings it's not what this earth can provide it's what god has chosen to do for you and i and when our spirit would be low that he would lift us up and when our bodies would be weak he would give strength to us when our minds would be clouded he would come and say i'm here to keep you oh get this saint not put you back in your right mind but i'm here to keep you in your right mind you'll never have to fall in the beginning stand on the word stand with me and i'll keep you in the right mind i'll keep you in the right spirit i'll keep you in the right position but what happens is man wants to live like man wants to live and then ask god to come and fix it but you see god wants us to step into the judgment room and say lord am i balanced since i'm just now learning to do this i'm 60 years old i'm just now learning before i act upon this to step in and say lord am i balanced and sometimes even i hate to admit it my flesh still says i just gotta have this yeah come on still the flesh man but this fellow made a real rash thing we would think would think if i could only take his place i'd go up before the throne and take a message and the first thing i would do what would you do be interested in what your organization had sent you up there to find out about it or would you be looking around to see how heaven was decorated or in his presence with the first thing you say lord god forgive me a sinner that would be the right thing to do now as jesus watched the boy and as he went away might come in his mind why didn't that boy do that was because he wasn't conscious that's it get this saints not conscious of who he was we we talk about once again i'm around around this we talk about the lord jesus christ the holy ghost is present in the room and you know what i'm talking about we sense it we feel it it's here it's real but have we really come to be conscious of who he is and why he is here amen that's right and what he's desiring to do or did we pat ourselves on the back i went to church today and brother paul preached too long which is pretty normal but that's okay that is okay yeah you see what we've got to do saints because as i declare to you the real binding comes when we're subject to the word that's it that's exactly right people say you know brother so-and-so look i had a little brief conversation brother joel i forgot to tell you hello but you know his words were kind of twisted a little bit i think it was a bad connection on the phone because he didn't say anything about coming here and he says and when you come into my place and he had that backwards that was the words i was supposed to be saying but pray for brother jewel he's still just struggling physically he's lost a lot of weight but he's pretty weak but god's with him god's with him but i tell you saints i've been not lifting up brother jewel but i'm talking about when a man has surrendered to god i've been with brother jewell and he was there and he spoke things and people said that's exactly you know brother jewels got that mental thing yeah yeah you know that brother joe's got a real mental thing where he's able to just preach and speak right to their need you know what that mental thing is it's got the mind of christ it's not him he's not trying to figure it out he's not trying to get some voice he's just hearing it and what he hears he speaks and it's perfect because it's god amen amen why become conscience of who he is become conscious of his presence here amen amen i think there's now one more portion to this may i say this not sacrilegious may i say this not because it's this meeting or any meeting but i think that's a matter today people are not conscious of it they see the scripture exactly identified but they're not conscious of who it is they'll see something they'll say oh that was wonderful that was fine but you're not conscious of what it is if it was there would be a repentance going on a weeping a crying and the city would have such a revival till half of you would be locked up before morning that's right if we be conscious of what it is we'll pass by many times and miss the opportunity not being conscious serving god should be fun but fun has more than one definition some want fun to be the puppet show the camel the donkey they wanted to be the golf match between the ministry and the people they wanted to be the carnival with the apple bobbing and the baseball toss to dunk the preacher brian smith this is a true story can i give just a little bit of humor there was a church back east i believe it was massachusetts there was a man that was in that church it was very disgruntled and their church had a carnival and they had one of those deals and everybody starts kind of joking with the pastor hey pastor come on get up on here the pastor gets up there and this guy walks up is a dollar a throw this guy walks up there lays a hundred dollar bill on the counter what they didn't know is he played college baseball and the pastor sitting on the deal it's a little bit chilly that day they hand him the first ball ding splash pastor wow gets up ding splash ding splash ding splash ding splash ding splash a hundred times and then the pastor's like that's over and the guy reaches in pulls his wallet out and they're like that's not enough and he said i'm not through with you i've still got a little bit of animosity left line saints oh you all laugh but some of you know what i'm talking about you see what it would do my brother and sister we've got to come to the place that every little i wasn't talking about you having animosities to me i mean sometimes it's just little things that linger the devil kind of keeps pouring just a little bit of you know whatever that is you know mr z's over here at zam's house got that stuff to make the tomatoes grow you just keep pouring a little on there come on saints it's time for us to get that out i want god to move in our church i want the yoke amen we don't want to come here and try and put the yolk back together break the yolk then take the pieces and throw them out of your life don't even leave them laying around where someone might try to put that yoke back on you oh hallelujah right what do we want to do the real binding comes when we get in the right position in christ that's when we can bind the devil amen people get discouraged well i bound the devil i bound the devil what's that music playing in your house what is the books in your house what is this in your house what is your that i'm not against even having a monitor and a player and watching some kind of you know thing little things for what is it the little things for the kids veggie tales and you know whatever these things they're they're not evil saints but when it's all that you do it becomes evil and it becomes evil because it's keeping your mind from having the mind of christ it's caught in this realm right here let's get out of the physical realm and get up into heavenly places amen god in the word never did show anything about using this garbage of this day to be our babysitter amen those things are used for education and there's not a problem it's the world we live in but the minute we turn it into a babysitter here child don't bother me watch this we have stepped over a boundary god help us god help us and we're all we're all subject amen i don't have little kids anymore but i'll tell you what there's been times when little decky's been jumping all over me and and just just torment me i'm thinking go find a video kid go find something here you know come on decky you know but he just you know he's he wants to hug his his grandpa his papa and papa's tired and you see i'm telling the truth your mind is i just i love you i love you decky but go distract yourself and if we're not careful that spirit just comes in and the devil says oh you don't have time for that just go distract yourself are we okay saints just just another minute or two here amen hallelujah three or four i love that brother dwayne fair brought that he says you know can we and we have just five more minutes everybody raised their hands like okay 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40. okay i got plenty of time hallelujah now look at this we're going to just make a reference here in matthew 7 it says judge not it be not judged for with what judgment you judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye meet it shall be measured again and why behold this thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but considers not the beam that is in the own eye or how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite that's it ouch thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye then shalt thou see clearly to cast the moat out of thy brother's eyes you see this what happens when we go and we judge ourselves right we get into the house of god we judge ourself and it's there that we can come and rightly divide the word of god and come and i'll tell you what it does say and said i'll just maybe this sounds bad forgive me but you know when i started applying or doing my best i've still got a ways to go i still got a ways to go but when i started doing that i found myself being a little judgmental now maybe i would pick on brother david brother jay or somebody here brother tim or whatever just as a reference but it'd be like well i sure didn't like what they did blah blah blah and then god speaks to you and says that's you you just don't see yourself what no that can't be i'm more spiritual than that lord i'm the pastor you see any exceptions in there i don't see and if you're the pastor no no exemptions god help us what happens true seed of god when you get that judgmental spirit god doesn't want you to not judge you know that that's exactly right god does not want you to say i can't judge that's what the world that's what denominational churches are doing they're teaching the people don't judge nobody don't judge nobody so nobody is doing nothing it's a free-for-all and they call it church and they call it the moving of the spirit they come to church and clothes they shouldn't even be in their own backyard in and they do that don't judge don't tell joe we're not supposed to judge no god wants you to judge that god wants you to judge from a clean heart because he said if you first cast the beam out of thine own eye and then when you see clearly not when you are subject to an opinion or an emotion or some other thing but when you see clearly is the time you can step in and say here brother sister let me help you because you know why when that beam is out of your own eye and you look in the mirror of god's word you will then be in the altar of your own soul crying out to god forgive me lord lord bring me to a place i can be a benefit to the body not a hindrance to the body bring me to a place i could be an example to my family hallelujah but see you've got to get to that position before the word's going to give you any authority hallelujah yeah us in the flesh trying to be the judge but you know this beautiful and i i don't know just one more quote saints do we have one more quote there brothers thank you question and answer somebody's asking it says just the elect goes at that time that lex takes the millennium then brother what type of people should we be i want to live through the millennium let us lay aside every wheat and sin that so easily beset us if the fellow says something wrong or does something or does something this way pray for him that's right that's the truth reminds me of a brother i'm not this is no thing for the preacher i just want to make this point i know a brother told me he says he preached his service in the church and he said the church revolt rejoiced they were breaking free from some things they had been bound in when that services was all over a sunday evening he's wrung out he's weak he's tired he's there and the man's like i've got a list right here of everything you said wrong and he says well you mind if i read it it says yeah i want you to read it and he started reading it now this brother is a little smarter than me he's like oh well just a second here he gets his books and notebooks and well here it is in the bible almost a mirror image of what i said here i left out a vowel or two the man's like well regardless keep reading and it goes down oh well this right here in church age book see keep reading goes through the whole list not because he was smart because the bible is infallible and when it got all done the man turned around just walked off never said i'm sorry never said forgive me nothing actually angry that his accusations proved to be false now my brother and sister with those kind of spirits it's no wonder churches get all locked up you know you guys ever done that you know bent over picked up something and you go to stand up and it's like imagine when a church gets that way the word trying to set them in order and lift them up in heavenly places and they're like you're not going to get me lifted up i'm just i'm just fine where i'm at well good this sounds rude but when the lord calls us home adios my friend because i'm not going to stay here because you won't move i'm going to keep moving because that's what god called me to do amen pray for him and keep moving on yeah look at that don't allow some spirit to come in the church and bind the whole church come on church and i probably shouldn't bring this up but we experienced this a couple years ago where the whole church was so bound up that everybody's walking out with a frown on their face and there's no joy left come on my brother and sister you pray for him but keep moving on let your one alternative be set towards god and if nobody else makes it you make it whoa almost sounds like a selfish spirit but i'm here to tell you god be my judge my heart i want to see every one of you make it but i also cry out to the lord lord i want to make it i've got to make it that's it this sister so often says i have come too far to quit now hallelujah oh if nobody else makes it you make it for there's going to be an elect who's going to live through the millennium age and will go in and out with christ for a thousand years then they shall go up into glory with him and return again when the resurrection of the wicked is brought forth then the millennium will set and after millennium is over then christ will go up with the church and at the end of a thousand years he will return with the church this is scriptural right amen christ comes three times first time he came to redeem his church is that right second time he comes to receive his church third times he comes with his church see he come to redeemer he come to rapture her be caught away in the time of the plagues and so forth returns back from the millennium lives through the millennium and then the great king and queen the great king and you realize now i have very poor grasp of english those of you really smart forgive me but the way i learned english was is if the context of the sentence is written correctly and the then the great king and because of the way it is written you could actually block out king and the word and and declare it it's the great queen also because it is oh i won't even say it because you guys will laugh at me but it is the connection that connects them together just as the blood of jesus christ a new birth the holy ghost has bound us to christ it is not some kind of slippery spray with wd-40 and it might go away no sir the blood of jesus christ and his spirit in you and i has bound us together with him and what he is we are hallelujah his spirit his nature his life is now our spirit our nature and our life we are not the rift of one portion of that anybody that preaches that that you're this and he is that we'll never be the savior we'll never be the creator we'll never be the deliverer but we are in him and therefore the attributes of that are in us because all that i am i have poured into the church and all is in the church i poured into you he didn't say i poured a residue i poured a leftover i poured a portion he said all that was in there been poured into you oh hallelujah and so the great king and queen comes down for the judgment the white throne judgment is set and the books were opened and there stands a redeemed holy ghost-born church of the living god standing there in her beauty how could we be that because you get in the word of god you become the living word you are born in christ and therefore you come into the nature and the mind of christ put you in a position and i'm telling you this is not something for another day this is something god is preparing you and i for this day right now amen that we could judge and judge correctly not from what we saw not what our education said not what our emotions are or how weary our spirit is but it's by the word that we would judge all things it's by the nature of christ the life of christ is how we would judge this and because the judgment is not set at this moment then we should be giving grace to every man woman boy and girl and giving prayers and lifting them up lord save them lord deliver them lord come pour a portion out on them lord by according to your perfect will and when the will of god is done my brother and sister there is no nothing left when the will of god is done there is nothing left there is no i think it should have amen it's settled it's settled this is sure is it settled in our souls right now when god is finished it will be settled amen amen and we will not be saying but that was my friend that was my neighbor that was my cousin an uncle of what or bring it right down home you see that bride sitting there in judgment it's not going to say now lord i was so close to my cousin i know they never served you and never even tried but lord you you should save them no you see at that moment in time it's set amen and did you know your judgment right now is actually set right now because it's right here that's it that's exactly there's no other judgment to come that's it nothing of our creeds nothing of our man-made traditions or doctrines it's said amen saints step into judgment today find a mirror of god's word step into judgment and say lord amen correct me by your word don't need some big man mean man reminds me of my childhood i think sister sue would remember this my sister would remember this a man named ronald sims i was as big as a barn he was so big he used to take transmissions he was a transmission repairman he didn't use a transmission jack he crawled underneath the car and did everything grabbed that transmission lifted out there and went and set it on a bench had hands like dinner plates it was a kind of a paradox because on one side ronald was just real soft real humble man but because of other other influences i would say had an attitude as a deacon you misbehave i'll grab you by the hair of your head i'll drag you out of here and take you out in the back room and i'll beat you well if you're not saved that's just simply terrifying you know wouldn't it caleb somebody come and threaten to just drag you down in the basement and just brother ivan would be our good example imagine imagine i think caleb would i don't think we'd ever see you ever misbehave would we not even blink in church if the idea that you're going to be drug in the basement we'd hear the noise ah caleb i'll stop stop no not till you repent but if you're saved you realize how wrong that kind of behavior is because a holy ghost is a quiet humble spirit a gentleman and it comes and we judge caleb i'm using you for example buddy are you good for the ride okay we want caleb to not cut up in church and not be doing all these bad things we don't drag him in the basement and beat him we ourselves go in the basement and cry out to god amen save this young man change his life amen there's where the difference goes amen why because when we went down in the basement and started crying out to god if we're real christian yes sir we started where first lord forgive me of my own faults and my own failures lord i want to be able to be held up against the light of the word then there'll be a bunch of smudges not be a bunch of dirt on my garment help me lord amen that saints is when you see god change people in a church when everyone in the church is willing to stand in the judgment that's it of god's word then you'll see a church that the holy spirit comes in moves freely amen comes up and down the aisles and young lives are changed we don't have all these kids i'm telling you it happens i pray it never happens here god's will be done but i pray it never happens here when you see churches i was talking to brother recently 58 percent he'd had it figured out of their young people had blitzed out of their church 58 over half gone i said what went wrong he said paul what went wrong is our pastor beats the children i should invite caleb up here so i could demonstrate that is that the right way y'all going to be closer to the lord if the pastor beats you no sir let's judge let's judge so that we won't be judged let's judge ourselves by the word and let the holy ghost come down move in our midst change our lives can someone lift a hand and say lord that's what i want that's the kind of church i want to be in that's kind of life i want to live i want you to come down lord i want you to be the one that changes my life hallelujah because you know there's conforming i always like to use this example when it comes to conforming that's when we put you in a giant machine and smash you into the shape we want you to be but then at work then at work but when we come ourselves and conform ourself to the word of god by god's grace then we have a life-changing moment hallelujah let this day be our judgment day saints that each one of us if we have things we need to do i'll tell you brother jay my heart just shook when you said let's not let our i'll remember the exact words let's not let our sins and our little things hinder a healing amen let's not let those little things saints that we refuse to get out of our life and get out of our church hinder a healing hinder salvation hinder the baptism of the holy ghost because i tell you god won't won't fill himself won't pour himself in dirty vessels lord forgive us we all have our challenges but lord forgive us sister emmy would you come brother sean amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yeah praise the lord hallelujah [Laughter] [Music] are you washed amen hallelujah saints let's just stand up worship the lord for a few minutes i've tried not to keep
