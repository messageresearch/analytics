[18:14] &gt;&gt; Who's going to be there?
[18:18] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I hope I am, Brother
[18:19] David." You don't need to hope anymore.
[18:21] You can know. [music]
[18:23] &gt;&gt; You can know. There's a divine evidence
[18:26] that you can be given that you know
[18:27] you're going to be there. Amen. Well,
[18:30] anyway, it's glad to Are you glad to be
[18:32] in the house of the Lord?
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was glad David said when [music]
[18:36] they said unto me, "Let us go into the
[18:38] house of the Lord."
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Of course, we know the real house of the
[18:41] Lord. And here, this this building
[18:43] becomes the house of the Lord when the
[18:45] house of the Lord comes in it.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Because we know where there was only one
[18:50] place of worship and that's in the house
[18:52] of the Lord
[18:54] &gt;&gt; and that's where he put his name in his
[18:56] house. So, I believe there's a measure
[18:59] of the house. There's a portion of the
[19:00] house here in this day in our day that's
[19:03] called his body. Amen. So, we're
[19:06] thankful to be a part of that to know
[19:08] that we are. And so, we're happy to be
[19:11] in the house of the Lord this morning. I
[19:13] was Thank you for praying for us on the
[19:15] trip. We had a good trip. We were up in
[19:17] Washington and Oregon and and had good
[19:20] fellowship with the people and brother
[19:21] John and they sent their greetings to
[19:23] you and and uh we just had a wonderful
[19:26] time. The meetings were went very well
[19:28] and had some good visit with friends we
[19:31] haven't seen for many many years and and
[19:34] so everything went fine. We appreciate
[19:36] it. Good to be here with you and back
[19:38] and uh and let's just have a word of
[19:41] prayer while we're standing. Our
[19:44] precious Lord, we give to you this
[19:46] service had given it into your hands.
[19:49] Lord, we haven't come to frolic. We
[19:51] haven't come to to see necessarily what
[19:54] each other. We've come here to see you
[19:56] and to receive from you and to know that
[19:59] we are ordained and led to be here where
[20:02] we are. And Lord, I know that out among
[20:05] me and right here is predestinated seed.
[20:09] And Lord, may you open their hearts and
[20:12] give them such a rest and peace to know
[20:15] where they're standing because as your
[20:16] prophet said, it's so good to see
[20:18] ourselves positionally placed in Jesus
[20:22] Christ. So Lord, open your word. We're
[20:24] expecting you to we're expecting you to
[20:26] speak and I'm expecting you to reveal
[20:29] your word to us and this morning that we
[20:32] may leave here raised to a higher plane
[20:33] in Christ. Closer drawn to you for
[20:36] that's our desire Lord is more of you.
[20:39] And Lord we know that we just sang that
[20:41] song when the role is called up on
[20:43] yonder. There will be a role called and
[20:45] Lord we we know and we we are placing
[20:49] our faith in that that we are there and
[20:52] will be there because it was ordained by
[20:54] you before the world began. And you
[20:56] can't miss your purpose. Your purpose
[20:58] will be done. And we're thankful that we
[21:01] can be assembled once again. These doors
[21:03] are open. This church doors are open,
[21:05] Lord. That we are able to come in here
[21:08] still have the freedom to speak. And
[21:10] Lord, we just thank you for this. And
[21:13] Lord, I don't know who's listening
[21:15] online, but Lord, may you bless those
[21:17] that are hearing. And may they really
[21:19] hear and may all hear it this morning
[21:21] beyond our ability to outwardly hear.
[21:24] But Lord, let it what we hear be from
[21:26] our heart.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Because there's where we hear, Lord,
[21:29] truly, we ask these things now in thy
[21:32] name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[21:36] I'd like you to turn with me in your
[21:38] Bibles to Psalm 57.
[21:44] I may sound a little horsearo. I'm I'm
[21:46] feeling fine. I just kind of got over a
[21:48] little bit of a a cold and and but by
[21:52] the grace of God, we're able to take
[21:54] this service this morning and and I'm
[21:56] not passing anything to anybody. So,
[21:58] don't worry about that. And may you just
[22:01] lose
[22:02] thinking or thought of that. Amen. Amen.
[22:05] We're here by the name in the name of
[22:07] the Lord Jesus.
[22:09] I want to title this sermon as I'll read
[22:12] the scripture here. My heart is fixed.
[22:17] And my subtitle and if I should just
[22:20] give it a subject here. I'm kind of
[22:21] taking a part two way back. I preached
[22:23] in July of Christ for me to live is
[22:27] Christ. And I'm taking that back up
[22:30] again. But my title is my heart is
[22:32] fixed. And when I say my heart, I hope
[22:35] yours is too. I trust it is my heart is
[22:39] fixed and
[22:41] I'm learning to lean
[22:44] for me to live is Christ. So Psalm 57:7,
[22:49] my heart is fixed, oh God, my heart is
[22:54] fixed. I will sing and give praise.
[22:58] Psalm 112
[23:01] verse 7. Seven is the number seven
[23:04] again. He will not be afraid. Speaking
[23:07] of us individually, and I trust that
[23:08] you'll take this individually, he shall
[23:10] not be afraid of evil tidings. His heart
[23:14] is fixed, trusting in the Lord. Amen.
[23:19] I'd like you to turn with me while
[23:21] you're standing, if you will, to
[23:22] Philippians chapter 1
[23:30] and we'll read verse 20.
[23:38] Let's just take verse 19 with it. Paul's
[23:41] speaking, for I know that this shall
[23:42] turn to my salvation through your prayer
[23:46] and the supply of the spirit of Jesus
[23:48] Christ according to my earnest
[23:51] expectation and my hope that in nothing
[23:54] I shall be ashamed that with all
[23:57] boldness as always. So now also Christ
[24:01] shall be magnified in my body, whether
[24:04] it be by life or by death. for me to
[24:08] live. I want to say that again. For me,
[24:11] I hope we're looking at the individual
[24:13] member here today. He's speaking to you.
[24:16] I pray that you can put your yourself in
[24:18] that. For me, and I say for me, for me,
[24:22] and for you to live is Christ. To live,
[24:26] notice, to live
[24:30] is Christ.
[24:31] And to die is gain. You may be seated.
[24:40] I want you to turn for a little lengthy
[24:42] reading with me to Ephesians.
[24:54] And there's something I'd like to have
[24:56] you in Ephesians embrace chapter 1
[24:59] starting with verse three. Very familiar
[25:02] scriptures but powerful words. And I
[25:05] pray that we will
[25:08] remember my subject here is for me to
[25:11] live as Christ. And when I say that it's
[25:14] learning to lean on what? Christ is my
[25:18] life.
[25:19] I trust that Christ is your life.
[25:23] That he's the absolute of your life.
[25:26] That nothing else matters but Christ.
[25:28] Amen. We must come to that place and
[25:32] have that position.
[25:34] It's not just a hope. So, it's not an
[25:36] emotion. But Christ is a person
[25:39] &gt;&gt; and it's the person of the word opened
[25:41] in you. It's not another person. It's
[25:44] Christ. It's the anointed word in you
[25:46] living. And that is the believers. And
[25:49] I'm just going to jump ahead a little
[25:50] bit here and make this statement. That
[25:52] is the believers. And we'll find out who
[25:55] the believer is, but that is the
[25:56] believer's absolute. The believer's
[25:59] absolute is not what he feels. The
[26:00] believer's absolute is not his senses.
[26:03] The believer's absolute is the shepherd
[26:05] which is in you leading you. The Bible
[26:08] said Psalm 23:1, "The Lord is my
[26:10] shepherd. I shall not want." Other
[26:12] words, without want meaning I'll have no
[26:14] lack.
[26:15] No lack. For Christ is in me. That is my
[26:19] shepherd leading and said for me to live
[26:22] for me to live I want to emphasize that
[26:24] word live. I want to emphasize Christ
[26:27] and the word live because what we're
[26:30] talking about here for me to live is not
[26:31] live natural but to live spiritually
[26:34] which is eternal life. For me to live
[26:38] whether when I live in this body my my
[26:41] focus and my absolute is in Christ in
[26:44] me.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the mystery of God
[26:48] revealed would be Christ in you.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; And that is where you stand. That's the
[26:54] bride's stand in this hour we're talking
[26:56] about this morning the bride's stand
[26:59] where she is where she's identified and
[27:01] that's in Christ in Ephesians 1 chapter
[27:05] verse three blessed be the God and
[27:07] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[27:11] that's a word past tense here who hath
[27:15] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[27:18] in heavenly places in Christ now that's
[27:22] not something that will be we're talking
[27:24] about something that is now that we that
[27:28] the believer the true believer and we'll
[27:30] we'll come to that in a moment what the
[27:32] believer is. We mentioned it many times
[27:35] but you may have forgotten and the Lord
[27:37] wants to remind you who the believer is
[27:40] and what he is but here we are that he
[27:42] hath blessed us. Is there anyone here?
[27:45] He's speaking to someone this morning.
[27:47] He's speaking, I pray, to more than one.
[27:49] He's speaking to me this morning. He has
[27:51] blessed me.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Us meaning us, meaning the body of
[27:55] Christ. Because this this uh letter here
[27:59] is is addressed to the saints.
[28:02] Amen. It's not only to the saints of
[28:04] Ephesus alone, but to the saints today.
[28:08] He's addressing this. He's addressing
[28:10] this to his body that he hath blessed us
[28:13] with all spiritual blessings in Christ
[28:15] in heavenly places in Christ.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; That's the believer's position in
[28:22] Christ. According as he hath here again,
[28:26] past tense chosen us. So according as he
[28:30] hath chosen us in him. The Bible said
[28:33] you didn't choose him. He chose us. And
[28:36] he chose us. The Bible says here before
[28:39] the foundation of the world.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; So before you had any consciousness of
[28:44] it, before you even knew it, God chose
[28:47] you in himself before the foundation of
[28:49] the world.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; That should settle a lot of matters
[28:52] right now. Because if he hath chosen
[28:54] you, he's not left you. He chose you and
[28:57] he hasn't got a different thought
[28:58] concerning you. He's not got a different
[29:00] mind concerning you. The Bible speaks to
[29:03] someone. This Bible speaks to you and I.
[29:06] this Bible, we find ourselves written
[29:09] here in the word. The bride because
[29:11] she's in Christ and Christ in her,
[29:13] chosen in him. Then we find that he's
[29:15] the word. And if he's the word, you're
[29:17] the word.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Because he chose you in the word.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; So we know that in the beginning was the
[29:24] word and that's where you are, right?
[29:26] That's who in the beginning there where
[29:28] you are because the word was a thought
[29:30] and that thought had to be expressed.
[29:32] But he chose you in himself before he
[29:34] even expressed it. He had chose you in
[29:37] himself before the foundation of the
[29:38] world. And then express what he chose.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so and so here we say here we
[29:45] see that we should that he chose us
[29:48] before the foundation of the world in
[29:50] him. I want you to notice we were chosen
[29:52] in him that we should be holy. That we
[29:56] should be holy and without blame before
[29:59] him in love. Oh, you say, "Well, brother
[30:01] David, I can't believe I've been
[30:02] chosen." I want you to embrace these
[30:04] scriptures. I'm speaking to the bride
[30:06] this morning. I believe I'm speaking to
[30:08] predestinated seed. I want you to
[30:10] embrace what we're reading here from
[30:12] verse 3 to verse 12. I want you to
[30:15] embrace it. I want you to take it and
[30:17] take it as your own.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Other words, I'm as we read here, we'll
[30:21] begin to realize I want you to embrace
[30:23] who you are.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; And I want you to embrace your
[30:28] predestination and that he chose you. Y
[30:32] &gt;&gt; and I believe there's a bride that can
[30:34] take that and embrace that.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; That's that's this word right here that
[30:38] we're reading ought to be absolute to
[30:40] someone here this morning. It's absolute
[30:43] to me. I pray that it's absolute to you.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he said verse five, having
[30:50] so he predestinated that we should be
[30:52] holy. And if he said we should be holy,
[30:54] we're going to be holy. I don't know
[30:57] what you have to go through in learning
[30:58] to be holy, but you're going to be holy
[31:00] because you're going to come to
[31:01] realization of your position and that's
[31:03] in Christ.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it it should that which
[31:08] should take all the struggle away, all
[31:10] the strife away. And these scriptures
[31:13] ought to be your final word.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so so here having verse five,
[31:20] having predestinated now that big word
[31:22] and then and it doesn't have to be
[31:24] complicated. It means he forneew you
[31:27] before the foundation of the world. He
[31:28] knew all things. He knew you. He knew
[31:31] what you would do. He and he chose you
[31:34] according to what he knew.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; And so he knew you. You you didn't have
[31:39] knowing of him because you didn't know
[31:41] you were in your father before you were
[31:43] born. And now realize that you had to be
[31:45] in your father. And and to be a part of
[31:48] your father, you had to be in your
[31:49] father to begin with. And to have
[31:52] eternal life and to be a son of God, you
[31:53] had to be in God, which is eternal to
[31:56] begin with. There's no other way. If you
[31:58] are a son of God, you know you're a son
[32:00] of God, then you had to be in God. You
[32:03] had to be in eternal life and had to be
[32:05] his thought of himself.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, having predestinated us,
[32:13] predestined.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Something he could do before the
[32:17] world began. We realize that that the
[32:20] Bible said Jacob he didn't see it's not
[32:23] the person that come predestinated aresh
[32:26] from God. It's not the person
[32:28] it's the seed
[32:30] &gt;&gt; that he planted there because God
[32:32] expressed what he thought in word and
[32:34] that word became that seed. And so every
[32:37] seed shall produce of its own kind.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're a seed of God,
[32:42] there's only one thing you can do. And
[32:43] whatever God t has to take to get you
[32:45] there, you're going to recognize your
[32:47] position and realize that you're his
[32:50] kind.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can't produce anything but
[32:54] his kind. And he'll do it through a many
[32:56] membered body and members in particular,
[32:58] but they're all they're all part of one
[33:00] headstone, headship. And see, the
[33:02] message in this day has taken us from a
[33:05] birth. It's it's taking us to maturity.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adoption. Adoption is coming to
[33:12] maturity of who we are.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. In our position. And so having
[33:18] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[33:21] children. Adoption there is placing of
[33:23] children. Maturity of children. Having
[33:26] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[33:28] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[33:32] according to the good pleasure of your
[33:34] will. No, you didn't have your will in
[33:36] it. It was according to the good
[33:38] pleasure of his will.
[33:40] I want you to embrace this. Amen. We're
[33:43] here to embrace it this morning.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Come out of here raised to a higher
[33:47] plane. Forgetting your fretfulness,
[33:49] forgetting your fear about mistakes and
[33:51] failures to recognize you were chosen in
[33:54] him.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; You can't be anything else.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; You can't be anything else. You're You
[34:02] can't be someone else in your soul than
[34:05] him.
[34:06] God predestinated play predestinated or
[34:09] he placed his seedword in you
[34:13] &gt;&gt; because he chose you. All right. Then to
[34:16] the verse six to the praise of the glory
[34:18] of his grace.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; What powerful words. It's not your
[34:23] doing. It's his grace. Wherein he hath
[34:25] made us accepted. He made us. He made us
[34:30] accepted in the beloved in Jesus Christ
[34:33] who is a perfect one. He made you accept
[34:36] it in him. He lived the life that that
[34:39] Christ demanded and and required. And
[34:42] when he lived it, you were there living
[34:44] it in him.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; So you're already accepted in him.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's where our typost is
[34:53] &gt;&gt; is in Jesus Christ.
[34:55] All right. So So to to the praise and
[34:58] glory of his grace where whereby we've
[35:01] been made, we hath he hath made. He
[35:03] already made us. He already made us
[35:06] accepted in Christ
[35:10] in the beloved. In whom we have
[35:12] redemption through his blood, [snorts]
[35:15] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[35:18] riches of his grace. Seal it.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Seal it in your hearts. Embrace that.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; You have redemption through his blood.
[35:26] It's not through your works. You can't
[35:28] do enough works to to supply or to or to
[35:31] satisfy him. It's by his grace you're
[35:33] saved through his faith.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; He put the faith in you to believe what
[35:39] you what you're hearing. You He put the
[35:41] faith in you to believe this word and
[35:43] the scriptures written of you. He put
[35:45] that there. You didn't put it there. You
[35:47] can't explain it. You can't give it to
[35:49] somebody else. But God put it there.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; He's redeemed you by his blood. He was
[35:54] perfect blood that redeemed you. He's
[35:56] loosed you by perfect blood. And
[35:58] therefore, the loosing is is complete
[36:00] and perfect. concerning you.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already perfect and complete.
[36:07] Therefore, there's no condemnation to
[36:10] them that are in Christ Jesus. He chose
[36:12] you in him. Therefore, there's no
[36:14] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[36:16] Jesus. You say, "Well, brother David,
[36:18] what must I do?" Believe what you're
[36:20] hearing.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, it shows that God's
[36:23] living in you. It's not something you
[36:25] manufactured. It's not something you had
[36:27] to lift up and try to believe. It's in
[36:29] you. I say, "I believe that. I believe
[36:31] it because in me is that is that ability
[36:35] to receive it and hear it.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; It's speaking to me. It's speaking to
[36:39] someone. These words aren't just words
[36:41] in the air. These words are eternal
[36:43] words.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're speaking to someone this
[36:47] morning. They're speaking to someone on
[36:49] the on the on the internet this morning.
[36:52] They're speaking.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "My sheep hear my voice."
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. My sheep hear my voice.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Who's his sheep? Those that he chosen
[37:03] himself before the world began.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. My sheep hear my voice.
[37:10] And a stranger they're not going to
[37:11] follow.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Because why? Because now you've come
[37:16] face to face with your absolute
[37:18] something. In order for you to live this
[37:20] life, you can't live it without having
[37:23] an absolute.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:25] So the absolute is either going to be
[37:27] your own self or it's going to be his
[37:29] word.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; And God is teaching us to let go of
[37:34] self. We don't want to lift up self. We
[37:37] will not have anything to do with this
[37:39] idol of self.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want to lift up myself above the
[37:44] word.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Who brought you into this life? Who gave
[37:47] you life? Who gave you breath?
[37:50] &gt;&gt; You didn't have any choice coming into
[37:52] it. You don't have any choice whether
[37:53] you're sitting here this morning. God
[37:55] brought you here to hear this word. Now,
[37:57] it depends what you want to do with it.
[37:59] It can either be accepted or it can be
[38:01] denied.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'll tell you what, if you're
[38:06] a seed of God, I don't care what you do,
[38:09] you cannot deny what these scriptures
[38:11] are saying.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; It's life.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "You did not choose me."
[38:18] Verse chapter 15. I chose you
[38:21] &gt;&gt; and ordained you that you should bring
[38:23] forth fruit and the fruit would be my
[38:25] life manifested in its season.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] Where did I leave
[38:33] off here? Verse seven. Oh, verse eight.
[38:36] Wherein
[38:38] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[38:41] all wisdom and prudence. He's abounded
[38:44] toward us, having made known unto us the
[38:48] mystery of his will. See, that's what
[38:50] he's opening to us here this morning.
[38:52] The mystery of godliness, which is
[38:54] Christ in you.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; It's not Christ in a future, Christ in
[38:57] the in the past.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; We're speaking of a Christ that was,
[39:02] which is, and shall come.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; And we're speaking of a believer in
[39:08] Christ, which is, which was, and shall
[39:11] come.
[39:13] Amen.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; All right. So, it's having made known
[39:20] unto us the mystery. It's an unveiled
[39:22] mystery. When he called to your heart,
[39:25] when he brought the message in this day
[39:27] to your heart, the veil dropped away and
[39:29] a mystery that was hidden all along.
[39:31] It's now open to you. You didn't realize
[39:34] that you were in him before the
[39:35] foundation of the world. You didn't
[39:36] realize you were chosen. God's revealing
[39:39] the mystery of himself because he placed
[39:41] himself, positioned himself in you for
[39:44] this day and for the water of his own
[39:46] word by the spirit to fall on you and
[39:49] water that seed and bring that seed what
[39:51] was in it to life.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; That's why I said in the beginning was
[39:56] the word. I say there you were and the
[39:58] word was with God. There you were. And
[40:01] the word was God. There you are.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:06] Amen.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Got it.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. All right. So, verse 10,
[40:12] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[40:14] of times. How many believe we're in the
[40:16] dis that dispensation?
[40:18] &gt;&gt; We've come to that position. We've come
[40:20] to the fullness of times. We've come to
[40:22] that because the opening of the seal
[40:24] denoted we've arrived at the end. Time
[40:26] is fading out. Time is blending with
[40:29] eternity.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; We're at the end. We've arrived.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; We know it. We see the signs everywhere
[40:36] pointing. We are at the end. Judgment is
[40:39] beginning to take a hold everywhere.
[40:41] Amen. The the the council of churches is
[40:44] forming that council, that
[40:45] confederation, a mark to the of image to
[40:49] the beast. We see it. We see it
[40:50] everywhere. We see that that that that
[40:54] confederation becoming political strong,
[40:57] taking control of every nation
[40:59] right now, right before us.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're seeing God's word being
[41:03] fulfilled. And God will absolutely
[41:06] fulfill every word. That should be our
[41:09] absolute. And the one that wrote the
[41:11] word, the one the word speaks of is in
[41:13] us. For me to live is Christ.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; And to die is gain. Listen, when you're
[41:20] in Christ, Christ identified and
[41:22] revealed in you. It's a win-win
[41:24] situation for for me to live as Christ
[41:26] and to die is gain
[41:29] &gt;&gt; for my living here. Let me magnify him.
[41:32] Let me magnify him. Whether it be by
[41:34] life or death, I will magnify him.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That should be our That should be
[41:40] our focus. That should be where we
[41:43] focus.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That should be our focus. God has
[41:48] delivered you from the effects and the
[41:50] struggles of this flesh. He's already
[41:51] set you free. If you'll just embrace
[41:54] what he's saying to you here, that it's
[41:56] Christ you're free. He who the Son hath
[41:59] made free is free indeed.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Not a problem of, well, I might slip
[42:05] back. No, you're not going to slip
[42:06] anywhere. If he chose you in himself,
[42:08] there's only one way you're going to go.
[42:10] He'll bring you to himself. No matter
[42:12] what it takes, he'll bring you to that
[42:14] recognition of what you are in your
[42:15] position
[42:17] &gt;&gt; because he maturing a bride. What for?
[42:20] The rapture, the body change. He's
[42:23] maturing us. He's bringing us right up.
[42:24] That's why the message was sent was for
[42:26] the going home of this little bride. The
[42:29] going home. What are we speaking of
[42:31] here? Who is this predestinated? It's
[42:33] his elect.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; He chose them. He elected them. It
[42:38] wasn't say, "Well, God just said by a
[42:40] whim, I'll take this and that one." No,
[42:42] it was what he knew. It was faith in
[42:44] him. He knew you. He absolutely knew
[42:47] you. You were existing in him before the
[42:49] world began. And and in order to keep
[42:51] you and hold you, he gave you a shot of
[42:54] predestination.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. A vac a vaccination. You want to
[42:59] know about a real vaccination?
[43:02] &gt;&gt; When he chose you and himself, he
[43:04] predestinated you to adoption.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And that's an immunity from anything
[43:10] else that could keep you out of that
[43:12] placing. Nothing could keep you out of
[43:14] that placing. For me to live is Christ.
[43:16] I'm talking about the birth word in you.
[43:19] I'm talking about Jesus Christ, the new
[43:21] birth revealed in you. It's in you.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Your leadership is in you.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; It's not off somewhere. If I could just
[43:28] grab it out here. No, it's in you. He
[43:30] wants you to trust him. That's what
[43:32] we're talking about. The bottom line
[43:33] here is that we are being tested and
[43:35] tried. We are being taught and learned
[43:38] how to obey, how to lean on and depend
[43:42] on him alone.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Because we're t he's talking, bringing
[43:47] you to your position, bringing you to
[43:49] who you are, showing you this is where
[43:51] you stand.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; All right. My All right. So, in the
[43:58] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[44:00] you remember in St. John, remember over
[44:02] there in St. John 14
[44:05] 20 at that day Jesus said at that day
[44:08] you'll know that I'm in the father me I
[44:11] in you and you in me at that day the
[44:13] revelation would come that I'm in you
[44:15] and you are in me.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Is that this is that not our day?
[44:21] &gt;&gt; We had a prophet say this this is our
[44:23] day. Listen, when I say a prophet said,
[44:26] I'm talking about a perfect
[44:27] interpretation of the word that God said
[44:30] he would through every age bring through
[44:32] a prophet for the hour and the day. He
[44:35] had to bring the perfect interpretation
[44:37] of the word for this hour.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; And we and we know we have that perfect
[44:42] interpretation by God divinely
[44:45] vindicated it to be his own word.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're not taking somebody
[44:50] else's idea, somebody else's thought.
[44:52] Because the Jesus, the Lord has said
[44:55] himself said, "I will do nothing unless
[44:57] I first reveal what I'm to do by my my
[45:00] secrets of the what I'm doing to a
[45:02] prophet." That's what he said. Amos 3:7,
[45:05] I will do nothing, but I reveal my
[45:07] secrets first to my prophets.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. And we're not looking at
[45:11] just a whim of a man that just happened
[45:12] to step by here and and and proclaimed
[45:15] himself that. know God stood behind him
[45:17] and vindicated that this was the hour
[45:20] that we have an opened word. The the
[45:22] seal that hid the mystery of that book
[45:24] which you are and I am has been
[45:26] unveiled.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. The mystery of God would
[45:33] be revealed.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; John saw it open, but he only saw a
[45:39] symbol. But it couldn't be revealed
[45:41] until the message of the seventh angel.
[45:43] Revelations 10.
[45:46] All right, let's get back here. So, in
[45:48] the dispensation of the fullness of
[45:50] times, he might gather together. I'm
[45:52] bringing that to you because he said in
[45:54] this day, brother Brandham said, "This
[45:57] day is that day that Jesus spoke of in
[46:00] St. John 14:20. In that day, you'll
[46:03] know." It's not something you'll
[46:04] imagine. It's something you'll know.
[46:06] Faith is not an imagination. Faith is
[46:10] not something I hope I get. Faith is
[46:12] what's been promised to you and then
[46:14] revealed to you. It becomes an actual
[46:17] substance. It's what you know.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; And the scripture said here, you're
[46:23] going to know. Jesus said you'll know in
[46:27] that day that it's I and you and you and
[46:29] me.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Or you could say it's I and him and him
[46:33] and me.
[46:35] Either one. It's unveiled to you.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; The veil's been taken away.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your heart's been turned. You see
[46:43] that word birthed inside of you. And God
[46:46] told us how it would be birthed. He told
[46:48] us how to be birthed. When you hear the
[46:50] word and realize what Jesus Christ did
[46:52] for you, he said, "Then repent. Turn
[46:54] around. You see that you're an heir.
[46:57] Turn around. The blood was shed for you.
[46:59] You realize it. He paid the penalty on
[47:01] Calvary for all your sin and you repent
[47:03] of it. Then you're baptized in water
[47:05] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for
[47:08] your remission of sins, for the past
[47:10] sins to be remitted. If you'll receive
[47:13] that the way the prophet said it, and
[47:14] you repent thoroughly knowing and
[47:16] testifying before the people that you
[47:18] believe what Jesus Christ did for you
[47:20] was for you, he paid the penalty. He
[47:23] sent his blood. He paid and washed you
[47:25] freely. And you've accepted that. And
[47:29] you you're willing to testify, I when he
[47:31] died, I died with him. when he rose, I
[47:33] rose with him. That's what baptism and
[47:35] water says. You're not saved by baptis.
[47:38] You're not saved by water. You're saved
[47:40] by faith in that blood.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; That did that. You're only showing
[47:43] outwardly what you believe. And if
[47:45] you'll do that, the Bible said, he said,
[47:48] "I shall give you shall receive the gift
[47:50] of eternal life." You receive the gift
[47:53] of God,
[47:55] &gt;&gt; which is eternal life. Amen. Amen. That
[47:58] is what constitutes the new birth.
[48:00] Water, blood, spirit.
[48:02] Amen.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so you know how you're going
[48:07] to be. That's what Peter said, Dr. Peter
[48:09] on the day of Pentecost when they said,
[48:10] "What must we do?" He said, "Repent,
[48:13] every one of you, and be baptized in the
[48:15] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[48:17] of your sins, and you shall receive the
[48:20] gift of the Holy Ghost."
[48:22] &gt;&gt; And without the Holy Ghost, you'll never
[48:24] understand what God had for you.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; So, the first step you need to take is
[48:28] not try to figure things out. Just get
[48:31] him in you. Let him come in. You realize
[48:33] the first step you need to take
[48:35] &gt;&gt; and take it.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; And if you believe it, you'll take it.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; It won't be because I like someone or I
[48:42] want to pretend like I'm a believer. I
[48:44] want to I want to be like because I'm
[48:46] attracted to somebody. No, you do it
[48:48] because in your heart you know what he
[48:50] did for you and you're willing to to
[48:53] publicly display that
[48:55] &gt;&gt; by taking his name in baptism
[48:59] &gt;&gt; that I am a believer
[49:01] &gt;&gt; and I recognize my sins were were
[49:03] covered were were emitted by the omitted
[49:06] by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you shall receive the gift of
[49:11] himself to come and live in you.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:14] Then he will lead you into all truth. He
[49:17] will open the word to you and lead you
[49:21] &gt;&gt; and guide you. When he, the spirit of
[49:23] truth, has come, he will lead you into
[49:25] all truth.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; There's no reason to just be a put on
[49:30] and well and be pretend to be. No. No.
[49:33] We're not here to pretend nothing.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; We're here to either be real or forget
[49:36] about it.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; No reason to try to pretend.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; We're not make believers.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Either you're a real believer and
[49:45] have met the person of Christ himself or
[49:47] you haven't.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I was raised in the
[49:50] message." That won't save you. I come to
[49:52] church. That won't save you.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; You've got to meet the person.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Christ himself.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. The new birth is nothing else but
[50:02] Jesus Christ himself unveiled in you.
[50:05] Why? Because his seed was in your soul.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; A lot of people can have a mental
[50:11] conception. They can say, "I believe
[50:13] God. I believe God." "Well, how do you
[50:15] know?" Because he said, "Well, how do
[50:16] you know?"
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Well, my mom said, "So, how do you
[50:19] know?"
[50:20] &gt;&gt; You don't know. You're taking somebody
[50:21] else's word for it. You're taking You
[50:24] can even take the scriptures. But until
[50:25] you know him who wrote these scriptures,
[50:28] you'll never know what's hid behind
[50:30] these scriptures.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Because this is the love letter sent to
[50:35] his people, his bride.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; All right. I thought I'd just drop that
[50:41] in. Okay. Now, so we find that in the
[50:44] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[50:46] or other words, in this day,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; that he might gather together in one all
[50:52] things in Christ. Where is he gathering
[50:54] them?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; In Christ.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; He would have to be a message then to be
[50:58] sent to us to gather us and positionally
[51:01] place us in Christ.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:05] Then
[51:07] both which are in both the he both which
[51:10] are in Christ both which are in heaven
[51:12] and which are on earth even in him
[51:17] in whom we have obtained an inheritance
[51:20] being predestinated according to the
[51:23] purpose of him who workketh all things
[51:26] after the counsel of his own will. that
[51:29] we should be that we should be to the
[51:32] praise of the glory of praise of his
[51:35] glory who first trusted in Christ. Amen.
[51:40] Embrace it. Take a hold of it. Don't run
[51:42] from it.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; God is speaking to your heart this
[51:45] morning, saints. Embrace what I've said.
[51:49] Don't run from it. Quit your running and
[51:51] turn around and start running where you
[51:53] ought to be running for the goal.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your feelings. Quit
[51:57] looking at your mistakes and realize
[51:59] that I've chosen you in myself. I've
[52:02] called you. I positioned you. I've
[52:04] revealed myself in you. Now go forward.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go forward. There's only one
[52:12] salvation that's in Christ. There's only
[52:15] one deliverance that's in him.
[52:18] Amen. Nothing else. No. You don't have
[52:20] your your your your hope set on some
[52:23] preacher, some church. Nonsense. Let go
[52:26] of it.
[52:27] You've got to meet Christ. [snorts]
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "For me to live is Christ and
[52:33] die is gain." And Christ was Paul's
[52:35] absolute. I'm talking about now if it
[52:38] was Paul's absolute and Paul's my
[52:40] brother, it's my absolute.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about Paul was my brother in
[52:45] Christ. Paul had the same life I live.
[52:48] Paul, we were bloodrelated. I say not
[52:51] blood natural, blood spiritual. We were
[52:54] bloodrelated. Royal blood.
[52:57] And he said, "Christ is my life." I say,
[52:59] "Christ is my life." How many will agree
[53:02] with me? Christ is my life.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about not me, you too.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; All right. So,
[53:13] so he said that he said because of this,
[53:16] he said he was bold. That bold he was
[53:18] fearless. He was confidence. He was
[53:20] plain. He was open. He was frank.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; With all boldness. I'm not ashamed to
[53:26] say that Christ is my life. I'm not
[53:28] ashamed to declare that my position, my
[53:31] hold in this hour, contrary to human
[53:33] intelligence, contrary to the
[53:35] intelligence of the world, Christ is my
[53:38] life. There's my absolute. That's my
[53:40] living. That's where I live.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, I'm here. And
[53:48] the purpose of that, he said, I'm here
[53:50] to magnify Christ. It's what he said. He
[53:53] said to magnify him
[53:57] with all boldness as always. So now
[53:59] Christ shall be magnified in my body.
[54:02] Other words, Christ is going to be
[54:03] enlarged. He's going to make himself
[54:05] great. He's going to be declared great
[54:08] in my body. Is that your focus?
[54:11] &gt;&gt; That should be that's my focus every
[54:13] day. Lord, let me be that witness. Let
[54:16] me be the witness. Let me be the very
[54:18] life of Christ manifested in flesh. For
[54:20] I believe that's what I am. I believe
[54:22] every member of the body is what they
[54:24] are.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; It's God manifested through clay today.
[54:31] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[54:34] and forever.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; It's a place where you're tied to
[54:38] something. Amen. We're we're passing
[54:40] through the deepest water it's been in
[54:42] the last 2,000 years. A very treacherous
[54:44] time. More mental problems now, but
[54:47] brother Brown was here. It was more
[54:48] physical. Now it's mental. Everywhere
[54:50] you turn, it's a mental problem.
[54:52] Something mental going on. You know why?
[54:55] Because Satan is more deceptive than
[54:58] have ever been. He can work with
[55:00] feelings. He can work with those
[55:01] emotions and make you think you've got
[55:03] it. But unless Christ himself is
[55:06] revealed in you, you've met him face to
[55:08] face. You don't have it.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. I'm going to
[55:11] be very frank with you. You say, "How
[55:13] can you say that?" Because I know it.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; And there's others that know it.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; And he's calling on you. someone here.
[55:21] Amen. And we're all learning to lean.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; We're all learning to come to a place of
[55:27] dependency where we will not lift. I
[55:29] don't want to lift up. I don't want to
[55:31] make myself an idol.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; It's nothing to do with David. Nothing
[55:36] to do with you. It's all him.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; And he chose. He said, "I'll come and
[55:40] live in you and I'll be your shepherd."
[55:42] You don't have to question where the
[55:44] shepherd's leading. He just said,
[55:45] "Follow me. Deny yourself daily. Take up
[55:49] your cross and follow me.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. Deny yourself.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't lift up yourself more. Deny
[56:00] your own thinking. Deny your own
[56:02] understanding. Let go of your
[56:04] understanding. Don't lead to your
[56:06] understanding.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; But in all thy ways acknowledge him. Him
[56:11] where? Him and you.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Deny. Don't deny him. Take it.
[56:17] Embrace him.
[56:19] He's perfect in all of his ways. He
[56:21] can't be anything else but perfect. His
[56:23] leadership is perfect. You don't have to
[56:25] question his leadership. When you know
[56:27] him, let go and let him then lead you.
[56:30] Let him guide you. Let him lead you
[56:32] contrary to your human thinking. Let him
[56:34] lead you contrary to what you understand
[56:36] humanly.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[56:38] &gt;&gt; But when you know him, that's the case.
[56:41] That's what we're talking about this
[56:42] morning is know him.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; You must know him. It's not to know
[56:47] about him. It's not theology. It's not
[56:50] an intellectual conception about him. To
[56:52] know him is life. Not to know about him.
[56:55] To know him is life.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. To know him. It becomes a
[57:02] Christ centered life. Then your life is
[57:05] Christ centered. Everything rotates
[57:08] around him. Not everything not
[57:10] everything rotating around you.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; It's not his word rotating on what you
[57:14] think. It's what you putting your con
[57:17] your confidence in him in you
[57:20] &gt;&gt; because as I said the to be fixed to
[57:22] have my heart fixed it means my heart is
[57:25] confident steadfast my heart is
[57:27] established it's settled it's at rest
[57:29] it's firm
[57:33] &gt;&gt; amen
[57:34] &gt;&gt; so my heart my heart is fixed my heart
[57:38] is firm I'm at peace I've entered into
[57:41] rest I've ceased David has ceased from
[57:43] his own labors
[57:44] How many can say amen to that?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; You're ceased. You're ceased.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Feed on the word. How do you grow? How
[57:51] do you grow more deeper into fellowship
[57:53] with God? Feed upon his word.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Ask him to reveal himself.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, how does faith come? Faith.
[58:01] Without faith, it's impossible to please
[58:03] him. And how's the believer walking? By
[58:05] his faith. It's not our faith. It's his
[58:08] faith.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul, he said, had to meet Jesus
[58:14] one day on the road to Damascus. He
[58:16] said, "For me to live as Christ, Christ
[58:18] was Paul's absolute." It was his typost.
[58:21] It was his. It was the end of all
[58:23] arguments. It was Christ was his typost.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Where's your tiepost this morning?
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Where are you tied to?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Are you tied to your intellectual
[58:36] education, your understanding, or where
[58:38] are you tied? Right.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:41] Are you tied to what feels best or
[58:43] reasoning? No. We're looking beyond
[58:46] that.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; We're looking at what he said.
[58:50] Amen. Amen. And what he said is what he
[58:53] meant.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Except you become as a little
[58:57] child, you be converted. That's to be
[59:00] birthed. That's to be changed. Except
[59:02] you be converted, then become.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Then you grow up, become something. You
[59:07] become dependent upon him as a little
[59:08] child would be. It's not you the big
[59:11] one. It's not you the great one. There's
[59:12] no big ones. There's no There's no great
[59:14] ones. There's no little ones. There's no
[59:16] big ones in the body of Christ.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; I don't care if position is a housewife
[59:21] position. Your positions given to you by
[59:23] God is just as great as an apostle, a
[59:26] prophet or a preacher. Any preachers
[59:28] don't mean anything. Don't you get
[59:29] yourself fixiated on a preacher.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; They're people. A lot of preachers could
[59:35] preach like a house of fire and preach
[59:36] well very anointed and then slide back
[59:38] and leave the Lord.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; We've known it.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; But see, they didn't know him. That's
[59:45] the thing. They didn't know him. They
[59:47] were gifted. But a gift is given to you
[59:49] without repentance. A gift is what
[59:51] you're born with.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; You can't depend on a gift.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; You depend on the person. It must be the
[59:57] word himself in you.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; It's got to be living. It's got to come
[1:00:04] off of the page of just a rema. It's got
[1:00:06] to be the thought that God thought in
[1:00:09] this word revealed to you by one person
[1:00:12] that's himself.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Your typost is not your feelings. Your
[1:00:19] typost is not what others say about you.
[1:00:21] Your typost is not in a church. And
[1:00:23] brother, sister, what's happening today?
[1:00:26] The ministry, what's happening? We're
[1:00:28] are we are we and I say we not only
[1:00:30] preachers, I'm talking about every
[1:00:31] individual in the body of Christ. You
[1:00:33] have a ministry. What are you doing with
[1:00:35] it? Are you feeding it? Are you are you
[1:00:38] relying upon God to take you out there
[1:00:40] and be a lifegiving source to someone
[1:00:43] else?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; There's only one way the life of God can
[1:00:46] come through and that's through his
[1:00:48] body.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why our last commission was
[1:00:53] go into the world and preach the gospel.
[1:00:55] The housewife preaches it.
[1:00:58] Not only the the the the teenage
[1:01:01] preaches it, you've met him. What are
[1:01:04] you doing with this? Are we getting the
[1:01:06] people to Christ? Are you getting them
[1:01:08] to a church, a sensation, an emotion?
[1:01:11] What are we getting the people to?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Are we bringing them to the word or what
[1:01:14] are we bringing them to?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Where are we leading them to?
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; What are what is our witness of?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I say, let him be magnified
[1:01:27] in me, Lord. magnify yourself in me.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Let my life testify.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And it's not something you have to work
[1:01:33] up and make up. You have to figure out.
[1:01:35] Just get in love with him. Get a love
[1:01:37] relationship with him. He'll take care
[1:01:39] of the rest of it. You'll just deliver
[1:01:40] yourself into his hands as a loving as a
[1:01:43] loving husband, a loving father, and
[1:01:44] then he'll take care of the rest of it.
[1:01:46] He'll lead you and he'll guide you
[1:01:48] according to his understanding,
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; according to his faith, according to his
[1:01:53] word.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; He's not going to lead you contrary to
[1:01:55] the word. The Holy Ghost can't come in
[1:01:58] you and then take you away from his
[1:01:59] word.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; His word is the believer's absolute and
[1:02:04] that word becomes alive in you.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] It's not just being having an anointing
[1:02:14] on on your spirit. It's the anointing on
[1:02:16] the word. It has to anoint the word.
[1:02:20] And you're going to recognize, you're
[1:02:22] going to hear, you're going to receive
[1:02:24] the word of promise for this season.
[1:02:26] You're going to see it. It's impossible
[1:02:28] for you not to.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; And if you don't see him working in your
[1:02:33] life and and and leading you and guiding
[1:02:35] you into truth, unveiling himself into
[1:02:37] you, I would say, Lord, fill me.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Fill me with yourself.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; There's one thing I'm here for, and
[1:02:46] that's to magnify you. I'm here to to
[1:02:49] display your love. I'm here to project
[1:02:50] your love
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; to the people.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not an ailial love, not a human
[1:02:56] love, but a godly love that'll receive
[1:02:59] and and accept and live the word for the
[1:03:02] season.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It goes beyond agape love is
[1:03:08] is is himself. It goes beyond a
[1:03:11] friendship.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And nothing wrong with a brotherly kind.
[1:03:14] We'd have to have that. I'm not speaking
[1:03:17] against that. But we've got to go to a
[1:03:19] higher love yet.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; We've got to go to the person Christ
[1:03:22] living in you
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; that will acknowledge the truth, willing
[1:03:27] to correct, willing to love, willing to
[1:03:29] show life.
[1:03:32] And you can't, as I said, you can't make
[1:03:34] that up. You can't manufacture that.
[1:03:36] It's going to be lived automatically
[1:03:38] through you.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Just know him.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; This is not a church affair. This this
[1:03:45] is not this message is not it's a it's a
[1:03:48] relationship. It's a oneness. It's a
[1:03:50] marriage.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; It's a union with Jesus Christ.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; It's not what I know. It's not how I've
[1:03:59] been raised.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; You're going to end up in the deep end
[1:04:03] one of these days. You've got to have a
[1:04:05] new birth.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; I don't hear many preachers tell about
[1:04:09] that anymore. Well, you're hearing it
[1:04:10] now.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; You must be born again.
[1:04:14] Yeah.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; And brother, sister, if I was a young
[1:04:18] lady and a young man, I wouldn't receive
[1:04:20] nobody but what is born again.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; They must be born again. And it's got to
[1:04:25] be displayed through their life without
[1:04:27] them working it up.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; How many say amen to that?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; All right. You better believe it. Don't
[1:04:36] you accept nothing else until that life
[1:04:37] is manifested in you
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; and you see that life living.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's got to be a union of
[1:04:44] fellowship here. If there isn't, either
[1:04:46] you don't have it, they don't have it.
[1:04:48] Neither one of you may have the Holy
[1:04:49] Ghost
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost in you will be a
[1:04:52] discerner. The Holy Ghost in you won't
[1:04:54] be tied up with something that's
[1:04:56] contrary to the will of God and the word
[1:04:58] of God. Amen. How can two walk together
[1:05:00] lest it be agreed?
[1:05:03] And Bible said, how how can there how
[1:05:05] can you come? How's that say that? I'm
[1:05:07] off my line just a moment. But how
[1:05:12] don't be unequally yolked
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; with unbelievers.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; That still stands today.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That still stands. You're going to have
[1:05:24] problems. You're really going to have
[1:05:26] problems if you try to yoke yourself up
[1:05:27] with an unbeliever.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a problem.
[1:05:37] The best thing to do is just follow the
[1:05:39] word.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, there's got to be
[1:05:44] a final typos. There has to be an
[1:05:46] ultimate. An ultimate is the last word.
[1:05:48] There's got to be something in your life
[1:05:50] that is the last word.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to be.
[1:06:00] [snorts]
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; All right. So we got to realize this is
[1:06:05] Christ living in you.
[1:06:09] [snorts] Yeah. He had to meet Jesus face
[1:06:11] to face. Paul did. And he cut loose from
[1:06:13] his Phariseeic typos and retied himself
[1:06:16] again to Jesus who he knew who he knowed
[1:06:20] was crucified, died, and rose again. How
[1:06:22] did Paul know he rose again? He knew it
[1:06:24] because he met the person.
[1:06:28] So how could he meet the person if he
[1:06:30] wasn't risen?
[1:06:32] Yeah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; You see what? See what's been said here.
[1:06:35] Paul knew it because he met the person.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Met him right on the road to
[1:06:40] Damascus.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Said, "Who are you, Lord?"
[1:06:45] He knew that pillar of fire was the
[1:06:46] Lord. He knew the Lord was leading in
[1:06:49] that pillar of fire. He knew that was
[1:06:50] the Lord. And he said, "Who are you,
[1:06:52] Lord?" He said, the Lord said to him,
[1:06:55] "You're persecuting me,
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Paul. You're persecuting me because I'm
[1:07:00] in flesh in believers. You're
[1:07:02] persecuting me.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Then who am I that's who who is it
[1:07:06] that's being persecuted? Who are you,
[1:07:08] Lord? You just said, "I'm persecuting
[1:07:10] you." Who Who are you, Lord?
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you, his answer
[1:07:14] wasn't the second person in the Godhead
[1:07:16] either.
[1:07:18] It was the person himself. He said, "I'm
[1:07:20] Jesus whom thou persecutest."
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord said, "I'm Jesus who died for
[1:07:26] you." The Lord said, "I'm Jesus who
[1:07:28] redeemed you through my blood." The Lord
[1:07:30] said,
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; "Yeah,
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; this is I and I live in these people,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; and I'm being witness to you, these
[1:07:38] people, and you're coming against me."
[1:07:40] My That shake me up. It shook Paul up
[1:07:44] because then he turned right around and
[1:07:46] sent a little minister, prophet down
[1:07:48] there and said, "You'll meet a man
[1:07:50] called Saul and you're to baptize him."
[1:07:53] He's repented and re baptized him in the
[1:07:55] name of Jesus Christ. And when that took
[1:07:58] place, Paul was on fire. He received the
[1:08:01] gift of the Holy Ghost. It settled right
[1:08:02] in him. That which was predestinated see
[1:08:05] become alive.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; You couldn't shut up Paul if he tried.
[1:08:09] In fact, he said, "I know I'm going to
[1:08:10] Jerusalem to be persecuted and and and
[1:08:13] there's chains and and prison awaiting
[1:08:15] me, but I could care less about that.
[1:08:17] I'm here to fulfill my calling. I'm here
[1:08:19] to do what the Lord said do. And none of
[1:08:21] those things mean anything to me. I
[1:08:23] don't even count my life, my own life. I
[1:08:26] don't even count it. I count it as
[1:08:28] stubble. I count it as nothing to
[1:08:30] fulfill my portion that God gave me in
[1:08:32] himself.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Amen. So Paul was
[1:08:37] converted. Praise the Lord. He came face
[1:08:40] to face. If you want to find that, let's
[1:08:42] go to 2 Corinthians chapter 4. I'm going
[1:08:44] to rush through this now real quick.
[1:08:50] Philippian I mean 2 Corinthians
[1:08:54] chapter 4 and we'll find what this birth
[1:08:57] is if you want to know. Amen. Verse 6 of
[1:09:02] chapter 4. 2 Corinthians 4:6.
[1:09:06] This is what he meant. For God who
[1:09:07] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:09:09] darkness. Was not that his spoken word
[1:09:11] let there be light.
[1:09:13] Is that right? Then what's Paul speaking
[1:09:15] of? The God who spoke the word.
[1:09:19] The original seed who commanded the
[1:09:21] light to shine out of darkness has
[1:09:23] shined in our hearts. Has it shined in
[1:09:26] your heart?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And if it shone in your heart, it's for
[1:09:29] one purpose of showing it. It was to
[1:09:31] give you the light of the knowledge of
[1:09:33] the glory of God. So now you are his
[1:09:36] glory because he shined and they gave
[1:09:39] knowledge of what's been a hidden as a
[1:09:41] mystery there. It's to give the glory of
[1:09:43] God in the face of someone, in the
[1:09:46] presence of someone. And that presence
[1:09:48] and in that face was Jesus Christ.
[1:09:51] That's why Paul in 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:09:54] 3:18 said, "Now we all with open face,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; beholding as a glass, we behold who we
[1:10:01] are. We're beholding our position. We're
[1:10:03] beholding the glory of God." Amen.
[1:10:06] Because that face has been opened. Whose
[1:10:08] face? His face. And I've come face to
[1:10:10] face. And when when he opened his face,
[1:10:12] I realized that was me,
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; mama. That's me.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing this in the mirror. This is
[1:10:18] me. My face has been opened. Paul met
[1:10:21] him face to face. He didn't meet a He
[1:10:23] didn't meet a a a feeling. He met a
[1:10:25] person.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And I wonder how many here have met the
[1:10:32] person.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not judging you. I'm just speaking
[1:10:35] to you.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've met it, so be it. You
[1:10:41] yourself know that.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; But you've got to meet the person.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; You've got to meet this one who spoke
[1:10:49] the word. That spoken word was original
[1:10:51] seed. You've got to meet him.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; You've got to meet him face to face.
[1:10:55] He's got to come in you. And you hear
[1:10:57] your face. His face is open to you and
[1:10:59] you realize that's my face.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; For Christ who is our life shall appear.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Then we shall appear with him in glory.
[1:11:08] That's just exactly what that scripture
[1:11:10] said. The glory of God is revealed to
[1:11:12] you.
[1:11:13] And when you looked in the mirror, 2
[1:11:16] Corinthians 3:18, with that open face,
[1:11:19] you looked in the mirror, you saw the
[1:11:20] glory of God. Brother Brandham said
[1:11:22] this. He said when he looked in the
[1:11:24] mirror, he said, he said that mirror
[1:11:27] reflects his Jesus Christ. And the
[1:11:30] glory, he said, you receive you re you
[1:11:32] you see the glory of God, which is Jesus
[1:11:35] Christ. And and the bride and brother
[1:11:38] Bram said the bride is the glory is the
[1:11:41] glory of him.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And the glory of Jesus Christ is his
[1:11:46] bride.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; So you're seeing yourself.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've come to yourself. You're
[1:11:53] [snorts] being changed now into the same
[1:11:55] image from revelation from glory to
[1:11:57] glory. That's what it's all about. All
[1:12:00] right.
[1:12:06] on a message this well I don't Yeah and
[1:12:10] why people are so tossed about Paul said
[1:12:13] to me to live is Christ and die is gain
[1:12:16] not me that liveth anymore
[1:12:20] but Christ that liveth in me
[1:12:24] life is gone it's Christ living in you
[1:12:29] amen that old man anymore that old man
[1:12:31] that was your husband is dead eternally
[1:12:34] separated from him. He's died. And don't
[1:12:36] try to don't try to to dig him up and
[1:12:39] become alive here again. Just leave him
[1:12:41] dead.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; He's dead. He's separated. You become
[1:12:44] alive in Christ.
[1:12:47] You were always were his.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Always. Let's embrace that this
[1:12:52] morning.
[1:12:54] You're not not me that liveth anymore,
[1:12:56] but Christ that liveth in me. Christ
[1:12:58] living in the individual. So surrendered
[1:13:01] when Christ speaks through their lips.
[1:13:03] I'm talking about the individual. Christ
[1:13:05] speaks through the lips. He thinks
[1:13:07] because he's in you. He speaks. He He
[1:13:10] thinks through the mind. Sees through
[1:13:12] the eye. Now watch. He acts through your
[1:13:15] temperament.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't like my temperament. But if
[1:13:19] you're born child of God, then just quit
[1:13:22] making excuses of what you don't like
[1:13:23] and how he made you and accept the fact
[1:13:26] and give yourself to God and let him
[1:13:27] live through your temperament.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Let him work through your temperament.
[1:13:33] Amen. He's going to work through your
[1:13:35] temperament.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people don't like my
[1:13:39] temperament.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you don't like it, but he
[1:13:43] made me thus. A lot of people didn't
[1:13:44] like John the Baptist's temperament.
[1:13:47] They didn't like Jesus when he braided
[1:13:49] whips and went in there and the Bible
[1:13:51] and the prophet said and he looked and
[1:13:52] the Bible said he looked on him with
[1:13:54] anger.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; They didn't like his temperament. Oh,
[1:13:56] that's not love. That was love.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] You see, it was love. When he went
[1:14:02] around 2,000 people and went to a man
[1:14:04] that was crippled for many, many years
[1:14:06] and left all the lame, the halt, the
[1:14:07] blind, the the poor children, everything
[1:14:09] else laying there. They didn't think
[1:14:10] that was love.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; But God obeyed what Jesus obeyed what
[1:14:15] the father sent him to do. That's love.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] It isn't it isn't I believe in in human
[1:14:26] uh sympathy, but here we saw the
[1:14:28] sympathy of God when he obeyed what God
[1:14:30] said do. And when he shows you what to
[1:14:33] do, you're not answering to your church.
[1:14:35] You're not answering to a pastor. You're
[1:14:37] answering to God. You do what he shows
[1:14:39] you to do and reveals it. And if it's a
[1:14:41] true revelation and you act upon that,
[1:14:43] that thought that's revealed to you and
[1:14:44] put it in a word, then the word of God
[1:14:47] has never failed in the mouth of true
[1:14:49] believers.
[1:14:53] And it's becoming stronger and more
[1:14:55] mighty and more unveiled as we go along
[1:14:58] here
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; that it's happening just exactly all
[1:15:02] right.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; So he works through your temperament.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; The things of the world's passed away.
[1:15:08] How can it be anything but sweet and
[1:15:10] pleasant all the time? He's not talking
[1:15:11] about sweet and pleasant out here. It
[1:15:13] may not be sweet and pleasant. Your
[1:15:14] feelings may not be sweet and pleasant.
[1:15:16] forget those things and realize what's
[1:15:18] in your soul is sweet and pleasant.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; The just shall live by his faith. So
[1:15:28] what is the believer? What is the
[1:15:29] believer today? What is this believer?
[1:15:33] The believer is the faith of God that
[1:15:35] moves in you.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; What is the believer? The believer is
[1:15:39] the faith of God. God's own faith.
[1:15:43] Substance faith. revelation.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; That moves in you.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; That's the believer.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a makebeliever. It's a
[1:15:53] genuine believer.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; The faith of God. First John 5:4 said,
[1:15:59] "We overcome the world." And what is the
[1:16:01] victory that overcometh the world? Even
[1:16:04] our faith.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; That's the believer.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Our faith, our revelation of God. Psalm
[1:16:13] 62:6 said, "God is my rock. I shall not
[1:16:17] be moved." I'm Yeah. I shall not be
[1:16:19] moved.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; When God is your revelation, how can it
[1:16:22] be moved?
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; When God is in you, Satan can't come and
[1:16:25] get it out of you.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; God's unveiled himself in you. You're
[1:16:29] sealed to the day of redemption.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Embrace it, people.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; If you know that, and I've just read the
[1:16:35] scriptures, he he chose you in him. Is
[1:16:37] that real to you? Is that a revelation
[1:16:39] to you?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where were you before that?
[1:16:43] You had to be in eternity to be a son
[1:16:46] and daughter of God.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; And there's only one form of eternal
[1:16:49] life, and that's God himself.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Right. So, this is our victory.
[1:17:02] The spirit of God, the real you is the
[1:17:05] spirit of God in you. That's the real
[1:17:06] you. I'm not talking about who you
[1:17:08] aren't. This is what Satan wants to
[1:17:11] point you to. But the real you is in
[1:17:13] that third realm, that third circle
[1:17:15] inside of that heart. That's the real
[1:17:17] you.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; You remember, brother Brandham, he's he
[1:17:22] made mention how that how that science
[1:17:24] had found out there's a little room in
[1:17:26] the compartment of the heart, human
[1:17:27] heart, that doesn't even have a cell.
[1:17:29] And they said it was the place of the
[1:17:30] soul.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet comes along and he
[1:17:36] begins to build on that. Why would he
[1:17:38] build on something like that? Because it
[1:17:40] was truth.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He he he said he said when God
[1:17:46] made man, he made him thus. For he made
[1:17:49] this little certain compartment in the
[1:17:51] man for his own throne, the control
[1:17:53] tower. God wants to lead man, but man
[1:17:56] wants to lead himself.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And that's what's always getting in the
[1:18:00] way.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; There's a battle all the time because
[1:18:03] your carnal self wants to lead you. And
[1:18:05] you weren't given that to be led by. You
[1:18:07] are given faith to be led by faith in
[1:18:10] what? Faith takes its resting place in
[1:18:12] the word of God. It will be unmovable
[1:18:14] out of that word. Genuine faith. God's
[1:18:17] faith will not be moved out of the word.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; It won't leave the word.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; All right. See, so God wants to lead
[1:18:27] man. So he made himself a little control
[1:18:29] tower in the midst of his heart. Yes.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Man wants to go after what he sees with
[1:18:36] his eyes. That's where he's deceived.
[1:18:38] That's where Satan deceived Eve by what
[1:18:40] she could see.
[1:18:44] Amen. All right. But sons and daughters
[1:18:48] are led by the spirit of God.
[1:18:51] [snorts]
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] Now,
[1:18:56] so that is called that is called a
[1:18:58] little inside of the inside.
[1:19:01] Medical science found little compartment
[1:19:03] in the heart of a human being. See, and
[1:19:06] what are we concerned? What are we
[1:19:08] dealing with here? A little room.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; A little compartment.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we find out that God's tented
[1:19:17] somewhere today.
[1:19:20] He's tented in his in his body. He's
[1:19:22] tented in you. He's bedded. He bedded
[1:19:25] himself inside of you so that he could
[1:19:27] come and live inside of you.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Where did he bed that? Where did he
[1:19:31] plant that seed? In your soul.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; But it took the water of life for the
[1:19:37] season to speak. You were called by
[1:19:40] spoken word. You're birthed by spoken
[1:19:42] word. It had to quicken. That water came
[1:19:45] when you come in contact with this
[1:19:46] message which you're coming in contact
[1:19:48] today. I'm preaching to you this
[1:19:50] message. Yes. Amen.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; And you come in contact with that,
[1:19:56] there's got to be something in your
[1:19:57] heart that says it can say amen. And you
[1:20:00] recognize it waters that and it brings
[1:20:02] forth what? It can't bring forth
[1:20:03] another. It's got to bring forth
[1:20:04] himself.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; That seed can't be if it's a if it's a
[1:20:12] word seed, it's got to produce the word.
[1:20:14] If it's God's seed, it has to produce
[1:20:16] him.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] All right.
[1:20:23] [snorts]
[1:20:25] So, we realize then
[1:20:30] we're the inside of the inside is what
[1:20:32] we're speaking of. The outer man is
[1:20:35] flesh. The inner man is spirit. We're a
[1:20:37] spirit being. If you take the spirit out
[1:20:40] of me, you could you could be you could
[1:20:42] even be sitting here without your
[1:20:43] spirit. You you I could kick you. I
[1:20:45] could move you. I could slap you. and
[1:20:47] everything else you'd never move.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; You're dead.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; That spirit person that you are is left.
[1:20:54] But inside that spirit,
[1:20:57] God planted something. And either you
[1:21:00] have that typost, that word, or you
[1:21:02] don't have the word. It's either faith
[1:21:04] or doubt that guides you.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the soul. That's that third
[1:21:10] realm. The realm of the soul. that
[1:21:13] compartment that we're speaking of, that
[1:21:15] little room that you go through the
[1:21:17] blood, by the blood, go into and you
[1:21:19] meet him. You've got to meet him.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say, "Well, I I just I just
[1:21:28] I'll just work it up. I'll work it up.
[1:21:30] I'll pump it up." No, you won't pump up
[1:21:31] nothing. You can't pump up nothing by
[1:21:33] God. He either chose you or he didn't.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And you know that because there's
[1:21:38] something in your heart that you can't
[1:21:40] explain, but you know it's the truth.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Then I say pursue it.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let go of it. Let go of that self
[1:21:50] that's standing in your way because
[1:21:52] Satan won't point you to that. He won't
[1:21:55] point you to that word.
[1:21:59] No, he'll point you away from that.
[1:22:03] [snorts]
[1:22:08] Okay, this is what he said here.
[1:22:15] Let me get here just something now.
[1:22:19] So that little second realm there,
[1:22:21] that's mind. That's a mind realm. That's
[1:22:23] a mind. That's where the battle's
[1:22:24] fought.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; It's called spirit. So if I could ever
[1:22:28] get, he said, "Now the mind reasons and
[1:22:31] your mind reasons all the time. It's
[1:22:32] reasoning."
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; All right? Your mind reasons, but the
[1:22:36] heart doesn't reason.
[1:22:40] All right. Just it just believes it. If
[1:22:43] I could ever get drive that home to one
[1:22:45] of my audience, I'd have a real healing
[1:22:47] service. If I could ever get my audience
[1:22:49] to see that it's not what your heart
[1:22:51] think. Excuse me. It's not what your
[1:22:53] head thinks at all.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; There's where the devil abides, but he
[1:22:58] reasons it out. I'm sick. You reason.
[1:23:01] You He reasons it. You reason it with
[1:23:03] him. I'm sick. I can't get well. I got
[1:23:05] this. I can't be saved. I'm this. I'm
[1:23:07] that. I'm something else. I'm down. I'm
[1:23:09] this.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; I say, what are we saying?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Are we confessing what the word says
[1:23:16] about you, or are we confessing what our
[1:23:19] feeling says? What's the word say about
[1:23:22] you?
[1:23:24] He said you're perfect. You're complete
[1:23:27] in him.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; The word says you're complete in him.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Now, watch what? Watch this.
[1:23:36] You were all pre-planned by God. Nothing
[1:23:39] happens by chance
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; with God. He knows all about it. It's
[1:23:43] all pre-planned. Planned for many
[1:23:45] generations back so you could be here
[1:23:47] this morning.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Also, he said on a message called
[1:23:57] letting off the pressure. That's what
[1:23:58] God's trying to get you to do today.
[1:24:01] You're going to be under pressure, but
[1:24:03] you have a pressure place of pressure
[1:24:05] release
[1:24:07] that you can commit these things to God.
[1:24:09] Let go of it and let him take care of
[1:24:10] it. He's got a plan and a purpose. He
[1:24:12] would see everything that happens. Now,
[1:24:15] let me read this first and I'm trying to
[1:24:17] I'm trying to close. I haven't even have
[1:24:19] to touch my sermon here. He said there's
[1:24:22] there's where the devil he said, now let
[1:24:25] me get back over here. He said this in
[1:24:28] learn lifting letting off the pressure.
[1:24:32] He said nothing happens by chance.
[1:24:34] Everything is ordained by God. No matter
[1:24:37] what happens.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking to? Who's going to
[1:24:42] believe that?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; When your whole being says it's contrary
[1:24:45] to it.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. Nothing happens by chance.
[1:24:51] Everything is ordained by God. No matter
[1:24:53] what happens, all things are going
[1:24:58] to work together for good
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; to them that love God, to them that are
[1:25:07] called. Now, that's a specific that's a
[1:25:11] focused call.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; What he said this morning, he's calling
[1:25:15] his elect.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; But there is a general call that goes
[1:25:19] all over the world. Many are called But
[1:25:23] few are chosen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're one of the chosen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; I say you are because the word says you
[1:25:32] are. And if you can accept it, you are.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; If you can believe it, you are.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; And if you really believe it, it'll
[1:25:39] work.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; It'll move. It's moving in you.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; It's working in you.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; It's operating in you.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; You're the word for the day living.
[1:25:49] You're the promise of the day
[1:25:50] manifested.
[1:25:58] So he said all things work together for
[1:26:00] good. So there's nothing out of cater.
[1:26:02] Nothing happens by chance. Everything is
[1:26:04] ordained by God. No matter what it is.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; It has to go over God's desk. It has to
[1:26:10] be okayed for you.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; You're his child.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; You're under his command. You're under
[1:26:16] his control. Then that ought to be
[1:26:18] enough right there to let off the
[1:26:19] pressure.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; What's the pressure come? Because you're
[1:26:26] trying to reason things out. The
[1:26:27] pressure is no pressure in saying,
[1:26:28] "Lord, this is your word."
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Go back to the word. I take the word as
[1:26:33] a little child. I don't have to. That's
[1:26:36] my daddy. He said so. I'm not trying to
[1:26:38] work it out. I have no premonitions of
[1:26:40] how it ought to be. I just accept it.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Daddy said so. That settles it.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you know daddy said so?
[1:26:56] Now you're expressed.
[1:26:59] Now you're expressed in this hour after
[1:27:01] the word has come in you. What are you
[1:27:03] expressed for? To light up this age. You
[1:27:06] are expressing God's life in you.
[1:27:08] Because you are a son and daughter of
[1:27:09] God. Therefore, you get what I mean.
[1:27:11] See, you are now made. You're sitting in
[1:27:14] this church this morning because your
[1:27:16] duty is to express God to this nation,
[1:27:19] this people, and the neighborhood where
[1:27:21] you associate.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; That's the focus.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Do we hear the sheep bleeding? Bleeding.
[1:27:29] Do you hear the lambs bleeding? Who's
[1:27:31] going to answer them?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Who's going to hear their call? Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; The elect of God
[1:27:41] have the answer to their blading.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Little
[1:27:51] ones, old ones. The sheep are calling.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Who's going to answer them?
[1:27:58] It'll be the body of Christ.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; So, lay down your figure. I've got some
[1:28:04] things I want to share and then I'm
[1:28:05] closed. I haven't just I'm just trying
[1:28:08] to hit just exactly wherever you are.
[1:28:11] God knew you would be here right where
[1:28:13] you are.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; He's ordered it. He's planned it.
[1:28:18] There's only one thing to do. Let go and
[1:28:21] let him lead you.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Just let go and let
[1:28:26] him lead you.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; St. John 1 John 4:4 said, "Greater is he
[1:28:31] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:28:33] world."
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; What is in you? This is a question to
[1:28:37] you this morning. What is in you that's
[1:28:39] greater?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; It's Christ,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; the anointed one.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; God that was in Christ is in you.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; All God was, he poured into Christ. All
[1:28:55] Christ was, he poured into the church.
[1:28:58] Is that right? All God was, he poured
[1:29:00] into Christ. All Christ was. Then all
[1:29:03] what was all Christ? God.
[1:29:08] God had bodily was in one man. Is that
[1:29:10] right? God paid for your sin. God shed
[1:29:13] his blood for you. God did.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Who's taken the book in this hour? God
[1:29:18] did.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; He stepped forth. What? God did. A lion
[1:29:23] took your place. Yes.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Was become manifest as a lamb. Took your
[1:29:28] place today. Took the book, opened the
[1:29:31] seals and unveiled who you are
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; and your position and set you in order
[1:29:35] for a body change.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Nothing could do it unless that book was
[1:29:39] open because that book contained the
[1:29:41] mystery of who you are.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. So then God
[1:29:50] was in Christ as in you. Greater is he
[1:29:51] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:29:53] world. Now watch this. Then if he's in
[1:29:55] you,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; same today. Then if he's in you,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; this ought to just rejoice you. Then
[1:30:02] it's not you anymore living.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; It's him living in you.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; What a consolation.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; My heart is fixed.
[1:30:16] My heart is fixed. It's him living in
[1:30:18] you. Not him living anymore.
[1:30:21] Not me. Excuse me. Not you living
[1:30:22] anymore. It's him living in you.
[1:30:24] [snorts]
[1:30:27] So, church of the living God, get to
[1:30:29] your feet. Believe him with all that's
[1:30:31] in you. Hold to that little wheel in the
[1:30:33] middle of the wheel. Let it stabilize
[1:30:36] every move, every motion that you make,
[1:30:38] every thought that you have. May it be
[1:30:40] controlled by this tower. The name of
[1:30:43] the Lord is a mighty tower. The
[1:30:45] righteous run into it and are safe.
[1:30:48] Where's the name of the Lord then?
[1:30:51] in you.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; He said the tower is on the inside of
[1:30:57] you.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Because God is is sitting right in his
[1:31:04] word in this hour. God is sitting where?
[1:31:07] He's sitting right in his word.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Christ's in you.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; The word living. Christ is right here in
[1:31:18] his word in you.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are his word living.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And not only living, it's living and
[1:31:27] operative. It's in action.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:31:35] See, because God is sitting right in his
[1:31:37] word in this hour in the evening light
[1:31:39] showing forth the light. Then I say,
[1:31:42] we'll walk in the light. Right.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; So I say to the bride as he said and he
[1:31:46] said this morning arise shine
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; thy light is come.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Thy light
[1:31:54] not your neighbors yours individual.
[1:31:57] We're not talking about groups here this
[1:31:58] morning. We are talking God is speaking
[1:32:02] to individuals. I don't care what your
[1:32:04] age is.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've been wondering. You've been
[1:32:07] questioning. He's given you the answers.
[1:32:11] Quit worrying about how he made you.
[1:32:13] Worried about trying to copy, compare
[1:32:15] yourself with others. Quit doing that.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; He made you the way he made you. His
[1:32:21] life is revealed in you. Give yourself
[1:32:24] up to him. Let him use you through the
[1:32:26] temperament and the way he makes you.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And say, "God, forgive me for finding
[1:32:32] fault with the way you made me."
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Just be who you are.
[1:32:38] And if something's off the word, then
[1:32:40] he's the discerner. He'll show you. And
[1:32:42] if you're a real believer, you'll answer
[1:32:44] that call and change.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; You'll make correction. I say, "Thank
[1:32:48] you, Lord, for correcting me every day."
[1:32:51] Correcting me.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd say, "Thank you, Lord, because
[1:32:56] I know you love me." And his love is
[1:32:58] corrective.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I spoke this morning.
[1:33:06] He said on Sunday on the wheel, in the
[1:33:08] middle of the wheel, he said, "Hold to
[1:33:10] that little motion, that little wheel."
[1:33:12] Amen. Inside the heart, that little
[1:33:14] room, my heart is fixed. Amen. I won't
[1:33:17] go over that now. Let me just come back
[1:33:19] to this and I'm I'm going to share
[1:33:20] something and we're done. All right. I'm
[1:33:23] thankful I started a little early. Thank
[1:33:24] you, brother Alex, for doing that
[1:33:27] because I know that that made a
[1:33:29] difference.
[1:33:30] All right. [snorts]
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; We realize then with him and us that all
[1:33:44] that you and all that I am is in him.
[1:33:50] All that you are Lord and all that I am
[1:33:56] is in him. What is it? Words. What am I
[1:34:00] in him? Words.
[1:34:03] It's the word. He said, "We're witnesses
[1:34:06] of the word."
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're witnesses of the word. Now,
[1:34:11] Matthew 24:35 said,
[1:34:14] and I'm going to back this up in the
[1:34:18] heavens and
[1:34:20] heavens and earth shall pass away,
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; but my words,
[1:34:25] what are we in him? Words,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; but my words shall not pass away.
[1:34:32] The prophet said, "If you be that word
[1:34:34] written in that scripture, you cannot
[1:34:36] pass away either."
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; All right. So in so heaven and earth
[1:34:44] will pass away, but my words, he living
[1:34:46] in his words today.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; He's living and operating in his word.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Are you one of them?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; For me to live is Christ.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say your heart's
[1:34:59] fixed?" because it's revealed to me
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; and I am not responsible anything else
[1:35:05] but to preach to you
[1:35:07] what's inspired and revealed.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; What you do with it's up to you. I'm not
[1:35:14] responsible for that. I'm not
[1:35:16] responsible for you getting it. I'm only
[1:35:19] responsible for bringing it.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; But it's the truth.
[1:35:23] They're words and we are witnesses of
[1:35:26] that word.
[1:35:29] Amen. If we go over here and I'll go
[1:35:31] over here real quick to first John
[1:35:34] 15 or five, excuse me, [snorts] and
[1:35:37] verse 10 or verse
[1:35:40] verse
[1:35:42] yeah 10.
[1:35:45] For he that believeth on the son of God
[1:35:49] hath the witness in himself.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:55] He that believeth not God hath made him
[1:35:57] a liar, because he believeth not the
[1:35:59] record that God gave of his son. And if
[1:36:02] he gave a certain record to his son,
[1:36:04] he's given it to you.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And this is the record
[1:36:12] he that this is the record that God hath
[1:36:15] given to us
[1:36:17] is eternal life. And this life is in his
[1:36:21] son. and he that hath the son.
[1:36:26] [snorts]
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you what Paul said about
[1:36:30] that in Galatians. You don't have to
[1:36:32] turn, but Galatians 1:16. I've read it
[1:36:35] many times here,
[1:36:38] and we'll see what he said.
[1:36:42] Paul said this, "When it pleased God,
[1:36:46] who separated me from my mother's womb
[1:36:48] and called me by his grace."
[1:36:51] Amen. He was called. He was specifically
[1:36:54] called.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; He responded to that call, didn't he?
[1:36:59] He said, "What for?" When he called me
[1:37:01] by his grace to reveal
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; his son in me that I might preach him
[1:37:08] among the heathen, immediately I
[1:37:10] conferred not with flesh and blood. So
[1:37:13] what was it? The the son was revealed in
[1:37:17] Paul. As I said, he met him face to
[1:37:19] face. The son became alive in him.
[1:37:23] And he that hath the son
[1:37:26] hath life.
[1:37:28] Amen. So here again, for me to live is
[1:37:32] Christ. That's your focus, bride.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; That's your focus.
[1:37:39] Amen. You [snorts] are his witness then.
[1:37:43] And all he is and all he was, I am. And
[1:37:47] all that I am, he was. That's not a
[1:37:50] cliche. That's in a message called
[1:37:52] unveiling of God.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "All that he was and all that
[1:37:58] he is, I am
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; being born of him. All that record
[1:38:04] living in me, unveiled in me,
[1:38:07] and all that I am, he was."
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; My, what a place to stand. As I said,
[1:38:16] you're standing. You [snorts] and God
[1:38:18] become one. He is in you. You're in him.
[1:38:21] Amen. And now you see it. You've got a
[1:38:25] typost. You've got an absolute.
[1:38:29] And your absolute is unlimited in its
[1:38:32] power.
[1:38:34] Your absolute is perfect in itself.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's our typos. For me to live is my
[1:38:43] absolute. for me to live is Christ
[1:38:46] unlimited in his power.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; An absolute the final word, the amen.
[1:38:58] What [snorts] a beautiful thing it is to
[1:39:00] lay your life in his hands
[1:39:05] and say, "Here am I, Lord.
[1:39:10] Just use me now. Yeah.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Lead me, guide me, and direct me in
[1:39:17] what? In the way that would be pleasing
[1:39:19] unto thee.
[1:39:23] [snorts]
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; And then don't murmur.
[1:39:29] No matter what the path is,
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; stay with it
[1:39:34] anyhow,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; and God will work it. All right. The
[1:39:37] footsteps of a good man or of the
[1:39:40] righteous is ordered by the Lord.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Galatians 2:20 said, "I'm crucified with
[1:39:46] Christ." How may say, "Amen." That's the
[1:39:48] truth. I'm crucified with Christ.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but
[1:39:54] Christ liveth in me. [snorts] And the
[1:39:58] life that I now live in the flesh, I
[1:40:00] live by the faith
[1:40:04] of the Son of God.
[1:40:07] who loved me and gave himself. Can you
[1:40:11] catch the photo here? The picture. He
[1:40:14] gave himself for you. His seed, his
[1:40:18] predestinated, his choice, his elect. He
[1:40:22] gave himself for you.
[1:40:26] How many? I pray you'll receive it.
[1:40:29] Amen. All right.
[1:40:34] We don't have to worry, hurry. We don't
[1:40:37] have to hurry and scuffle and act like
[1:40:38] the rest of the world. Quieten down.
[1:40:41] What's the matter with the Christian?
[1:40:43] The spirit of the world today is
[1:40:44] neurotic. But that's not the spirit of
[1:40:46] Christ. Did you ever see him get excited
[1:40:49] about something? Now, we're talking
[1:40:50] about him in you. But what are we to do?
[1:40:53] Bringing every thought captive to that
[1:40:55] Christ in you.
[1:40:58] There's where the battle lays.
[1:41:01] Amen. That's the battle. It's fighting
[1:41:04] you every day because you have a part of
[1:41:06] yourself
[1:41:08] that's the word and the other part is
[1:41:11] carnal.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they're constantly at a
[1:41:15] warfare. But who's going to win?
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Which one chief feeds the most?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; So it's Christ is your absolute. Christ
[1:41:24] is your portion. Christ is the measure.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Bringing every thought under obedience
[1:41:29] to Christ.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:32] Not under obedience to your feelings,
[1:41:34] obedience to Christ. If you let go and
[1:41:36] let the word guide you, he'll show you
[1:41:38] just what to do. He's the healer. He's
[1:41:40] the deliverer. He's the savior.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; He's the provider.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Then let him do it.
[1:41:49] Quit putting yourself in the way,
[1:41:51] putting yourself in the picture. Let's
[1:41:53] just put yourself out of the picture.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; And for me to live is Christ. He is the
[1:41:58] picture. Therefore, you are the picture.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. because that's you.
[1:42:05] All right? Now, when I say that you, I'm
[1:42:08] not talking about this man out here that
[1:42:10] you see dying. I'm talking about Christ.
[1:42:13] For for me to live, for me, me to live
[1:42:17] is Christ.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've entered in. Why do some of
[1:42:23] these troubles No, I'm sorry. Let me
[1:42:26] finish this. Oh, what a blessed
[1:42:27] assurance. just like a baby to lay your
[1:42:30] trust upon him and let him take all your
[1:42:33] cares for he cares for you. Don't try to
[1:42:36] do anything about it. He will do it
[1:42:38] already. He promised he would do it.
[1:42:40] It's his business. As long as you're
[1:42:42] fooling with it, well then he can't have
[1:42:44] it. But when you turn it loose and let
[1:42:46] him have it, he will take care of you.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; He will take care of it for you.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; It's just like a child. Child just lets
[1:42:56] go of it. asks father. Father gives it
[1:42:59] to him. Said, "I've got it. I've got
[1:43:01] it."
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? I've got it.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; He'll take care of it. Yes, sir. Oh, I
[1:43:09] like that. What a perfect calmness the
[1:43:11] Christian ought to have.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Why do we come to these troubles?
[1:43:17] [snorts] What makes these things come?
[1:43:19] Let me just let me just look and read a
[1:43:22] scripture here first before I go any
[1:43:23] further.
[1:43:26] You know, we're talking about this this
[1:43:28] morning. We're talking about this. The
[1:43:31] mind of Christ ought to be operating
[1:43:33] among us.
[1:43:37] The mind of Christ should be operating
[1:43:40] among us. How many believe it is?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; See, it ought to be. Brother Bram said
[1:43:46] those words. I'm just quoting what he
[1:43:48] said. The mind of Christ ought to be
[1:43:49] operating among us.
[1:43:52] Amen.
[1:43:54] That's Christ in you.
[1:43:58] And you're predestinated as he was makes
[1:44:01] the word flesh in you as it was in him.
[1:44:06] Predestinated as he was makes the word
[1:44:10] flesh in you as it was in him.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Why should a Christian ever be
[1:44:16] perplexed? Why do we come to these
[1:44:18] troubles? Let me read one scripture.
[1:44:21] Hebrews 5:8.
[1:44:26] I want you to see
[1:44:30] and then I'll read one more quote and
[1:44:31] just a couple thing. Can you bear it
[1:44:33] out? Five minutes with me and that'll be
[1:44:35] it.
[1:44:39] Hebrews 5'8.
[1:44:41] He was a son. How many know he was a
[1:44:43] birth son of God? Just like you are
[1:44:45] birth son of God. Amen.
[1:44:48] You have a spoken word birth
[1:44:50] spiritually, not physically. He was born
[1:44:52] physically virgin born. We are born
[1:44:55] spiritually virgin born.
[1:44:58] All right. Verse five or chapter 5 verse
[1:45:01] 8. Though he were a son,
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; yet learned he obedience.
[1:45:08] I'm talking about learning to lean. Yet
[1:45:11] learned he obedience by the things which
[1:45:14] he suffered.
[1:45:17] In plain language, I just read to you
[1:45:19] the scripture here.
[1:45:21] And he being made perfect.
[1:45:24] Perfect through what? That that learning
[1:45:26] to lean, learning through uh suffering,
[1:45:30] he would made perfect and he became the
[1:45:32] author of eternal salvation unto all
[1:45:34] them that obey him.
[1:45:36] In plain language, the very character of
[1:45:38] Jesus was perfected by suffering.
[1:45:42] Then how can you expect your character
[1:45:45] to be perfected any other way? We've
[1:45:48] been speaking about your character.
[1:45:49] That's Christ in you. That's your
[1:45:52] character.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; He left a church a measure of suffering
[1:45:56] that they too by their faith in God
[1:45:58] while suffering for him would come to a
[1:46:00] place of maturity, perfection.
[1:46:07] Amen.
[1:46:11] the very the very plain language. He was
[1:46:16] he was perfected through suffering.
[1:46:19] Amen. Now, why do we come to these
[1:46:23] troubles? What makes these things come?
[1:46:25] Why should a Christian ever be
[1:46:26] perplexed? Why would not everything just
[1:46:29] run perfect for a Christian? But it
[1:46:31] doesn't, and we know it. And sometimes
[1:46:34] we have more troubles when we become a
[1:46:35] Christian than we did when we were
[1:46:37] sinners.
[1:46:42] He said, "And sometimes, of course, it's
[1:46:44] written, many are the afflictions of the
[1:46:46] righteous, but God deliverth him out of
[1:46:48] them all." God promised many
[1:46:49] afflictions, strange feelings, strange
[1:46:51] things that would be beyond our
[1:46:53] understanding. But it's always done for
[1:46:55] our good. See, it's always done for our
[1:46:58] good.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; You just can't understand it because if
[1:47:01] we did, then it would not be faith to
[1:47:03] us. We would go on with an
[1:47:05] understanding. But we do it, we have it,
[1:47:08] and we believe by faith in his word that
[1:47:11] it's going to work some good thing for
[1:47:12] us. If we could grasp that today on this
[1:47:16] morning, if we could grasp that all of
[1:47:18] our troubles and there's none of us
[1:47:20] immune from them, and if we could
[1:47:22] realize that those things are for our
[1:47:24] good. It is written in one of the
[1:47:25] scriptures in the Bible, trials are
[1:47:27] brought upon us are more precious than
[1:47:29] gold itself. For it's given, God's
[1:47:32] giving us these trials and we become his
[1:47:36] when we become his property, our
[1:47:37] confession and our baptism and our
[1:47:40] promise to walk in life for him. Then
[1:47:42] every trial that comes upon us is to
[1:47:45] perfect us for his glory.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; See, then it doesn't become a sad thing.
[1:47:50] It becomes a thing to be thankful for.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just contrary to what you thought.
[1:47:57] Amen. Because God's working out a plan.
[1:48:00] you. He He has a plan, a perfect plan
[1:48:02] for you in him, in his body. It's to
[1:48:05] bring us to a place where God can make
[1:48:07] himself more real to us than he was
[1:48:09] before the trial come. I want to join
[1:48:12] join this morning with Job in saying,
[1:48:13] "I've lived long enough to know that's
[1:48:15] the truth." I raise my hand. I've seen
[1:48:18] it in my own life, and every time a
[1:48:20] great situation arises that I can't get
[1:48:22] around it or under it or over it, God
[1:48:24] makes a way and comes out glorious. I
[1:48:26] just wonder how his grace ever does it,
[1:48:28] but he does it. And remember in all
[1:48:30] these things, Satan tries to make us
[1:48:32] nervous and upset to get us to think,
[1:48:35] "Oh, why did this happen? Why couldn't I
[1:48:38] have been like this?" He said, "Let go
[1:48:39] of that and just give it over back to
[1:48:42] God."
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; He allowed it. He purposed it. And he's
[1:48:47] taken it through you through you through
[1:48:49] it for an eternal purpose that he's
[1:48:51] ordained you for.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Then can't you see where we're standing?
[1:49:06] Life is in the grain again. Life is in
[1:49:09] the grain. What grain? The original seed
[1:49:13] that went in the ground. The same Jesus
[1:49:14] is here in the bride form. Same power,
[1:49:18] same church, same thing. It's the same
[1:49:21] word. The same word sucked up through
[1:49:23] these and come out here and come to a
[1:49:25] head. And all that life that come
[1:49:27] through there picked up his people. Now
[1:49:29] it's forming up into a head in bride
[1:49:32] form for the rapture.
[1:49:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:49:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many love him?
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You've got to go through these things,
[1:49:48] brother, sister. But remember,
[1:49:50] it's Christ in you. For me to live as
[1:49:53] Christ. Let's stand together.
[1:49:59] [clears throat]
[1:50:02] The very character of Christ
[1:50:06] was perfected
[1:50:08] by suffering.
[1:50:11] And we have a measure. If you want to
[1:50:13] read that, you can got a Brown church
[1:50:15] age book and start at one page 126 and
[1:50:18] go and read about the other things he
[1:50:20] said.
[1:50:23] God's making himself known to us
[1:50:25] personally. This is a personalizing of
[1:50:27] himself. Amen. How wants to say, "Lord,
[1:50:31] [music]
[1:50:32] give me more of you. Let me have more of
[1:50:35] you, Lord."
[1:50:37] Amen. Let me just have more of you.
[1:50:46] On the inside of that flesh man is a
[1:50:48] [music] man called spirit. He has five
[1:50:50] senses and those things are
[1:50:53] consciousness, thought, imagination,
[1:50:55] reasoning, memory, affections.
[1:50:59] You can't think with your body.
[1:51:02] You think with your mind. And there's
[1:51:05] where many Christians only stop.
[1:51:08] And they can just like the corn in the
[1:51:10] field and the weed in the field, they
[1:51:11] can be anointed with the same Holy
[1:51:13] Spirit that the real believer is
[1:51:14] anointed with in their spirit.
[1:51:17] But down on the inside of that next
[1:51:19] realm of that spirit
[1:51:22] is the soul. And that's predestinated by
[1:51:26] God.
[1:51:27] There is where the real germ lays
[1:51:31] is in there. And so the real gift is
[1:51:34] your soul down in there.
[1:51:36] That's the gift of eternal life. That's
[1:51:39] what God sees you as. That's what God
[1:51:42] knows you as.
[1:51:44] He can't look at that and look through.
[1:51:47] When he sees you, he has to look through
[1:51:49] the blood.
[1:51:51] And he can't see anything but you
[1:51:52] perfect.
[1:51:55] Do you believe that this morning?
[1:51:59] [music]
[1:52:00] Amen. You say, "But I'm not perfect."
[1:52:02] Which side are you looking at? [music]
[1:52:04] Look at what he said. No, David isn't
[1:52:07] perfect.
[1:52:08] But this word, my life, who I am on the
[1:52:13] inside is perfect.
[1:52:16] It can't be anything else but perfect.
[1:52:18] You say, "I don't believe that." Watch
[1:52:20] this.
[1:52:22] Every born again believer, true believer
[1:52:24] is perfectly, absolutely sinless before
[1:52:26] God.
[1:52:28] That's what [music] he said. We had a
[1:52:31] prophet say that
[1:52:33] he's not trusting in his works, but in
[1:52:35] the blood of Jesus that his confession
[1:52:37] is dropped into [music]
[1:52:40] the Bible says. So, see, he that's born
[1:52:43] of God does not commit sin.
[1:52:46] How can you take a birth word of God,
[1:52:49] how can you take the birth of God in
[1:52:50] your soul and commit sin?
[1:52:54] That seed cannot sin.
[1:52:59] God ever opened your heart to realize
[1:53:01] that's you.
[1:53:03] You've conquered every devil, every
[1:53:06] power.
[1:53:07] Why? Because the name of the Lord, our
[1:53:10] control, [music] our tower is in us. Our
[1:53:14] shepherd is in us. His word is in us
[1:53:18] that we [music] rely upon. You know, man
[1:53:20] was made to rely completely upon God.
[1:53:22] You know why he did? Because he knew
[1:53:24] where he came from.
[1:53:27] And when you know where you've come
[1:53:28] from, then you know who you are. [music]
[1:53:32] And when you know who you are, you know
[1:53:35] where you're going.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what's happening to the bride
[1:53:39] today. The secret is being revealed.
[1:53:41] He's here among us taking us out of this
[1:53:44] place secretly. It's a secret coming.
[1:53:48] Amen.
[1:53:50] And why will And if that's so secret,
[1:53:52] what will the rapture be?
[1:53:55] You could walk out of here and be gone
[1:54:01] and nobody would hardly know it.
[1:54:04] They'd say, "Well, we're thought we're
[1:54:06] looking for a rapture. It's already
[1:54:08] happening. One day this rapture will go,
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; not come, go."
[1:54:17] Amen.
[1:54:24] How can you make a man a sinner when the
[1:54:25] bleached blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:54:27] between him and God?
[1:54:31] That would scatter sin till there be
[1:54:32] nothing left of it? How can that pure
[1:54:35] blood of Christ ever let sin pass? And
[1:54:37] when you're in Christ,
[1:54:41] you are what he is, perfection.
[1:54:46] So let the trials be. Don't find fault
[1:54:49] with them. Give them to God. Say, "Lord,
[1:54:51] you allowed this for a purpose, and I'm
[1:54:53] giving you glory in it, giving thanks in
[1:54:55] all things, for this is the will of God
[1:54:58] concerning you." Do you get that
[1:55:00] scripture? Do you understand what that
[1:55:03] just said? Give thanks in all things,
[1:55:05] for this is at the moment happening.
[1:55:08] This is the will of God concerning you.
[1:55:11] He's got such a control over you [music]
[1:55:14] that can't be anything but God under
[1:55:16] control. Nothing happens by chance. you
[1:55:19] are a believer, then rest in [music]
[1:55:21] him. Christ is my life. My heart is
[1:55:24] fixed. I'm learning to let [music] go
[1:55:27] entirely.
[1:55:29] Amen. Let him let him control. Let him
[1:55:33] teach you.
[1:55:35] Jesus himself [music] had to learn
[1:55:37] obedience. Had to learn to depend on
[1:55:40] God.
[1:55:42] Had to learn to obey. And if he had to
[1:55:44] learn, we do. It's the same spirit
[1:55:46] working in us.
[1:55:48] Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads in
[1:55:51] prayer.
[1:55:52] Lord Jesus,
[1:55:55] this seemed like a very cutup message,
[1:55:58] especially to me because there was so
[1:56:00] much to say, [music]
[1:56:03] but I felt compelled to say what I've
[1:56:05] said, Lord. And it's in your hands.
[1:56:08] [music] It's put in your hands. Many
[1:56:10] things I'll probably go back and
[1:56:11] realize, well, I missed that. I missed
[1:56:13] that. But Lord, you said it. You spoke
[1:56:15] it. It shall not return to you void. It
[1:56:18] went out to predestinated seed this
[1:56:20] morning. May they put their arms around
[1:56:23] that predestination. Say, Lord, here am
[1:56:25] I.
[1:56:27] Here my Lord. Lead me, guide me, direct
[1:56:31] me in what pleases you. [music]
[1:56:34] For my life is your life. For my faith
[1:56:38] is your faith and it's moving [music] in
[1:56:40] me. And that's my anchor. That's my
[1:56:42] absolute. It's Christ in me. My [music]
[1:56:46] heart is fixed. Bless thy word, Father,
[1:56:49] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'd like to sing [music] a
[1:56:55] couple little song. First, I'd like to
[1:56:57] sing Learning to Lean. I'm learning to
[1:57:01] lean.
[1:57:06] Amen.
[1:57:09] I'm learning
[1:57:12] to lean. [singing]
[1:57:15] Learning
[1:57:18] to lean. [singing]
[1:57:20] I'm learning [music]
[1:57:22] to lean [singing]
[1:57:25] on G. That person Christ in you
[1:57:31] gaining [singing]
[1:57:33] more power
[1:57:36] than I'm ever [singing]
[1:57:39] seen.
[1:57:41] I'm learning
[1:57:44] to lean
[1:57:46] on Jesus.
[1:57:50] [singing]
[1:57:53] I don't think I know the verses. Do you
[1:57:55] know the verses?
[1:57:57] You don't know them either. Okay, let's
[1:57:59] just sing the chorus once again, [music]
[1:58:01] I guess. Well, it's a Well, it's the
[1:58:03] same. It's a verse. It's not a chorus.
[1:58:05] Let's go back to that again.
[1:58:09] Sad, bro.
[1:58:12] [singing]
[1:58:13] [music]
[1:58:13] At an altar,
[1:58:16] I knelt.
[1:58:18] I found [music] peace.
[1:58:21] I don't think that's right. secure.
[1:58:24] [singing and music]
[1:58:26] Have you found that peace
[1:58:29] and all [singing]
[1:58:31] that he asks me?
[1:58:35] A life,
[1:58:37] trust,
[1:58:39] and a heart [music] that
[1:58:42] is learning [singing]
[1:58:44] to lead.
[1:58:49] Well, [singing and music] I'm learning
[1:58:52] to lean. That's right.
[1:58:55] Learning.
[1:58:57] Let your [music] heart be fixed this
[1:58:59] morning. It's Christ that's your focus.
[1:59:03] Follow him. Let him lead you. Deny
[1:59:06] yourself daily and let him guide you.
[1:59:10] Oh, I'm gaining [singing]
[1:59:12] more power
[1:59:15] than I've [singing] ever
[1:59:18] seen.
[1:59:20] I'm learning [singing] to lean
[1:59:25] on Jesus.
[1:59:30] Now, [music]
[1:59:32] not my the favorite song, but one of my
[1:59:34] favorites.
[1:59:42] Isn't that funny? I just took a blank on
[1:59:45] what it was.
[1:59:48] Well, of course, the original life.
[1:59:53] That's Christ in you. For me to live is
[1:59:56] to live an [music] original life. Amen.
[2:00:00] God's attributes were [singing]
[2:00:02] manifested
[2:00:04] with bride in this last age. We have
[2:00:08] caught the revel. That's it. The last
[2:00:11] prophet's message and we somebody's
[2:00:15] going to get the revelation. Might as
[2:00:16] well be you.
[2:00:20] Praise the Lord
[2:00:22] for the original life.

[2:00:57] names are seen within redeemed, perfect
[2:01:01] without sin. Yes, we are anointed

[2:02:09] The original word

[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; It was in me to begin with. I'm seated
[2:03:23] in it now. You say, "You make that sound
[2:03:26] awful real." It is real. You say,

[2:03:30] simple.
