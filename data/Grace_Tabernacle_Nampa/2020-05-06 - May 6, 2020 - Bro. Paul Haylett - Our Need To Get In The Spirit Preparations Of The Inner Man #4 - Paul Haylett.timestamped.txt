[30:26] brother Joshua those that are still at
[30:29] home amen sometimes we we miss some of
[30:32] them so each and every one you know it's
[30:35] it's because I spent years every winter
[30:38] out on the road gone away from the
[30:40] family I always just have a special spot
[30:42] for a brother vasily brother Sergei and
[30:46] just the life that it is out there and

[31:00] good to be a son or daughter of God
[31:01] tonight isn't it amen
[31:03] you know tonight gonna speak some
[31:05] straight things but I I trust before
[31:08] we're finished that you'll have just a
[31:10] real joy in your heart
[31:12] amen that will just recognize what God's
[31:15] doing he said I just looking at this in
[31:18] question and answers I forget exactly
[31:20] what year that was do you remember
[31:22] sister Jerry I she started reading it
[31:25] and I started stealing it from her and
[31:27] reading it and someone posed a question
[31:30] there about you know if you were a son
[31:32] or daughter of God and and you'd kind of
[31:33] have drifted away would God let you just
[31:36] go and brother branham comes and says
[31:39] you know now if you're a real son or
[31:40] daughter of God he will bring you back
[31:44] amen and and you know I don't plan on
[31:46] drifting away right but it's an
[31:48] assurance something they stir
[31:50] in your heart that that God's not like
[31:53] our society of today that by something
[31:56] and just in a little short time throws
[31:59] it away
[32:00] I was talking to a man today he works
[32:03] for one of the equipment dealerships and
[32:05] and he made some comments to me and and
[32:07] he as a young man attempted to make a
[32:11] living farming and and it just wasn't
[32:13] working they were going broke and it was
[32:16] interesting to me he said and I had to
[32:19] come three years ago to a point I made
[32:21] decisions and he said I decided my wife
[32:25] was worth keeping and my family was
[32:28] worth keeping and my life was worth
[32:31] keeping and I let the farm go and I
[32:35] thought I spoke openly I spoke very
[32:37] blunt to him I said that encourages my
[32:39] heart that you would express that you
[32:41] had a wife and a family that was more
[32:43] important than these other things
[32:46] now think about who we are in Jesus
[32:48] Christ God said I would let this whole
[32:52] world be burnt over I would do whatever
[32:54] it takes I would go offer myself because
[32:58] you're my family you're my wife and
[33:01] you're worth keeping oh my heart just
[33:04] rejoiced as I was thinking about that
[33:06] thank you lord I'm worth keeping
[33:09] hallelujah hallelujah let's just stand
[33:11] this evening as we go into the thought
[33:16] tonight just you know this has just been
[33:19] on my heart lately Saints this
[33:21] preparation of the inner man you see we
[33:24] can do all kinds of things I've just
[33:26] seen a little advertisement for a little
[33:28] donut thing that you put in your mouth
[33:30] and you bite down on it and it tones the
[33:33] muscles and supposedly pulls your face
[33:35] up and makes you look much younger I
[33:37] think I'm gonna get one but anyway but I
[33:41] thought look mankind does they do so
[33:45] many things for the outer man my you
[33:49] drive down the street there's these
[33:50] monster buildings are these fitness
[33:52] centers and everybody's going in there
[33:54] to run and lift weights and to sweat and
[33:57] to do this to make the outer man oh but
[34:00] hallelujah God's anointed a bride in
[34:03] this last hour
[34:04] and he said she's not going to be
[34:06] concerned now I'm not saying we ignore
[34:07] the outer man just like mad doesn't
[34:09] matter but what God anointed us was to
[34:13] focus and say you know taking care of
[34:15] the outer man is okay but it's the inner
[34:18] man that I want ready for that day that
[34:20] time and Lord just anoint me with a
[34:23] spirit to be prepared in the inner man
[34:26] hallelujah you know you could you could
[34:29] in this life you might say physically a
[34:32] wreck but if the soul was fine-tuned in
[34:36] the presence of Almighty God then hey
[34:39] look you got to go back to that youth
[34:41] you got to go back to all of that and I
[34:43] say Lord let us focus on the inner man
[34:46] amen now this has been something that
[34:48] was kind of something bittersweet
[34:51] tonight my brother and sisters to study
[34:54] this and there's so much more to it I
[34:57] had to kind of condense it down you know
[35:00] but as I was studying this and what
[35:03] brother Branham says and looking at this
[35:05] and it struck me Oh God help me forgive
[35:08] me Lord
[35:09] because you see Saints if the flesh or
[35:14] carnal man is controlling the spiritual
[35:19] man our flesh is not dead come on now
[35:29] I'm not expecting you know just to Rara
[35:31] but look that's deeper than we think
[35:33] well I just don't feel like reading my
[35:36] Bible I just don't feel like praying I
[35:38] just don't feel like going to church and
[35:41] we could go much deeper with that I
[35:43] don't like what the what the preacher is
[35:45] preaching I just listened for just a few
[35:48] short minutes oh brother Jason Watkins
[35:49] preaching this evening of course he's
[35:52] preaching to him to a video camera to a
[35:55] microphone with just a few there at the
[35:57] church but he was preaching it says
[35:59] isn't that interesting God's plan you
[36:02] see we want the preacher to make us feel
[36:04] good we want to go to church and leave
[36:06] feeling good but God wants you to go to
[36:09] church and leave a better person amen so
[36:14] it's not us hearing what makes us happy
[36:17] but it's hearing what we need Oh God
[36:20] give us men that got a heart for the
[36:22] Bride of Christ that will preach the
[36:24] word and anointed by the Holy Ghost to
[36:27] what we need not what we want to hear
[36:31] because if it's what we want to hear
[36:33] look my brother and sister the
[36:35] compromises at first a very shallow
[36:38] slippery slope but it becomes much
[36:40] steeper later on because we talk about
[36:42] we're all making the rapture you're not
[36:45] doing what you should you're doing this
[36:46] you're doing that you're lying you're
[36:48] cheating you're stealing you're drinking
[36:49] you're smoking you know you're
[36:51] fornicating you're there bad bad but you
[36:53] are all gonna make the rapture you said
[36:57] I'm saying and everybody's like yeah
[36:59] right I forget that I'm doing these
[37:01] things because I'm gonna make the
[37:02] rapture how about someone loves us
[37:04] enough to preach the word that says you
[37:07] know what get your act together because
[37:09] every seed will bring forth of its own
[37:12] kind and we don't want that kind of seed
[37:16] following us amen oh let us sow the
[37:20] seeds of righteousness and holiness sow
[37:23] the seeds of anointing of the Holy Ghost
[37:25] hallelujah Romans 8 and 1 verses 1
[37:29] through 10 amen so we look at this
[37:33] evening just a little foundation there
[37:36] is therefore now no condemnation can
[37:40] someone say Amen to them which are in
[37:43] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[37:47] flesh but after the spirit so we could
[37:49] take verse 1 and we could counter
[37:51] produce that there is now condemnation
[37:54] to those who are not in Jesus Christ
[37:59] amen
[38:01] who walk after the flesh and not after
[38:04] the spirit right so every one of these
[38:07] scriptures my brother and sister
[38:08] unspoken has its counterpart amen for
[38:14] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[38:16] Jesus hath made me free thank you from
[38:20] the law of sin and death for what the
[38:22] law could not do in that it was weak
[38:24] through the flesh God sending his own
[38:27] son in the likeness of sinful flesh he
[38:30] didn't send him
[38:31] sinful flesh but in the likeness amen
[38:34] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[38:37] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[38:40] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[38:43] walk not after the flesh but after the
[38:46] spirit for they that are for they that
[38:50] are after the flesh do mind the things
[38:52] of the flesh but they that are after the
[38:56] spirit the things of the Spirit for to
[38:59] be carnally minded is normal hmm but
[39:07] unfortunately in loud Asiya it is
[39:11] becoming the normal look I believe it
[39:16] was 1959 I was reading brother Branham
[39:18] said and they'll be their anointed by
[39:20] that saying Christians and I can drink
[39:22] and it doesn't bother me I can smoke and
[39:24] it doesn't bother me and I can dance and
[39:26] it doesn't bother me my brother and
[39:28] sister now whined the years down here
[39:31] and here we are 2020 and what is the
[39:34] mantra of the modern church I am saved I
[39:37] can do all these things it doesn't
[39:39] bother me hmm well hallelujah well if
[39:45] we're in this spirit if we're in Christ
[39:47] the Holy Ghost is going to bother you
[39:50] Alleluia well thank you lord
[39:55] we walk not after the flesh but after
[39:58] the spirit for they that are after the
[39:59] flesh do mind the things those last but
[40:01] they they're after the spirit the things
[40:02] of the Spirit for to be carnally minded
[40:04] is death not normal not accepted it's
[40:09] simply death but to be spiritually
[40:13] minded is life and peace because the
[40:17] carnal mind is enmity against God for it
[40:19] is not subject to the law of God rather
[40:22] neither indeed can so then they that are
[40:26] in the flesh cannot please God but ye
[40:29] are not in the flesh I say amen to that
[40:31] but in the spirit if so be that the
[40:34] Spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[40:38] man have not the Spirit of Christ he is
[40:41] none of his and if Christ be in you
[40:45] let Miriam ffice eyes that if Christ be
[40:48] in you we testify tonight he's in us
[40:53] hallelujah the body is dead because of
[40:56] sin but the Spirit is life because of
[41:00] righteousness Heavenly Father we are
[41:03] thankful for the opportunity to come
[41:06] tonight and Lord as I have shared with
[41:09] the church Lord not to point to
[41:12] ourselves but just to make the point
[41:15] Lord come show us our shortcomings
[41:18] father don't let us blindly walk forward
[41:22] Lord with something in our life whether
[41:25] it be a spirit upon us a false doctrine
[41:28] a misunderstanding of bitterness Lord
[41:32] don't let us go forward
[41:34] father come through the word come
[41:37] through your moving of your spirit
[41:39] father correct us and give us a heart
[41:42] that is soft and tender Lord not a heart
[41:46] that's brutish and a bully but Lord Oh
[41:49] spirit that is tender before you one
[41:53] that would quickly say forgive me and
[41:55] would be quick to forgive those around
[41:58] them Lord I pray father for your hand of
[42:02] mercy guide each one Lord I pray in the
[42:05] name of Jesus Christ amen
[42:08] you may be seated so as I chose here out
[42:14] of Romans the eighth chapter because we
[42:17] want to set in place the importance of
[42:20] being after the spirit or in the spirit
[42:23] you see many people and I don't want to
[42:26] go you might say as it would be to the
[42:28] negative side tonight but many people
[42:31] have come to a place and we'll touch on
[42:33] it just a little bit later also but
[42:34] they've come to a place that they
[42:36] believe as long as they mentally and
[42:39] intellectually can accept or be able to
[42:42] say amen to that you know you need to be
[42:45] baptized acts 2:38 I say amen to that so
[42:49] therefore I'm a believer now my brother
[42:52] and sister the thing is is wherever the
[42:54] presence of God is brother branham makes
[42:56] this statement you'd be aware of it
[42:58] brother branham said that wherever the
[43:01] presence of God is the supernatural is
[43:04] present and so we are in a position here
[43:07] now because the word has been opened in
[43:10] our generation that we are now
[43:12] accountable people might say well you
[43:14] know I didn't understand that I didn't
[43:16] see that I didn't my brother and sister
[43:18] this is why the prophet of God made
[43:20] emphasis that we should pray for
[43:22] revelation first and foremost he says we
[43:25] should be putting that right up at the
[43:27] top of our list to pray for revelation
[43:30] but yet we live in a time around the
[43:32] message that many people are saying we
[43:34] don't need anymore revelation we've got
[43:36] enough to make it in the rapture well my
[43:38] brother and sister when we have all we
[43:40] need to go in the rapture we will go
[43:42] amen so we don't want to sit here
[43:44] thinking we've got it made in the shade
[43:46] we're just waiting for the ship to come
[43:49] to the dock and we're out of here
[43:51] my brother and sister the word clearly
[43:53] shows us that when that last seed is in
[43:55] we are gone amen so there someone might
[43:58] even be me okay we're not throwing it
[44:00] off on someone else we ought to all say
[44:02] it might be me
[44:04] Amen we might be the one hindering the
[44:06] rapture we're all looking for the lost
[44:08] seed out there but some of that seeds
[44:10] got to come to maturity and so lord help
[44:13] us I certainly wouldn't want to be the
[44:15] one that would hold up the rapture but I
[44:17] don't want the rapture to go without me
[44:19] amen so lord I need your grace I need
[44:22] your mercy Lord get me ready help me get
[44:25] ready hey men because I believe amen
[44:27] when I'm preaching tonight I believe
[44:29] with all of my heart amen sometimes
[44:32] people would be like well you know the
[44:34] scripture says that they would be those
[44:35] that would come in at the end time they
[44:37] would be preachers they would be that
[44:39] evangelists they'd be that teacher that
[44:41] would be there to deceive the very elect
[44:43] well I believe the word I believe that's
[44:45] possibility amen no matter where you go
[44:48] and that we as the Bride of Christ
[44:49] should be aware of that and that's why
[44:52] the prophet of God told us you take it
[44:54] back to the word now my brother and
[44:55] sister just because we got a vindicated
[44:58] message amen a vindicated prophet on the
[45:00] scene
[45:01] brother Brown never said and tell your
[45:03] when you're convinced then I'm
[45:05] vindicated I'm that messenger after that
[45:08] you don't have to worry about taking him
[45:09] back to the word no my brother and
[45:10] sister he said you take it
[45:12] back to the word because the word is you
[45:15] a nice anchor amen that's our absolute
[45:18] where we can go to it
[45:19] and I actually cut the quote out because
[45:21] I'm sure I'll be too long tonight I
[45:23] don't profess that to claim it but I
[45:25] just started cutting some things out and
[45:27] one of those this brother branham
[45:28] talking about circumstance I won't go
[45:30] into a whole thing but he says now I
[45:32] would say this and I would say that but
[45:34] he said now I can be wrong but the word
[45:37] is never wrong
[45:39] remember my brother and sister when it
[45:41] come down to seven hundred and seven
[45:43] thousand and people then wrote questions
[45:46] to brother branham brother branham is
[45:48] the Bible wrong brother Brown's response
[45:52] is the Bible is never wrong amen
[45:57] so my brother and sister we can do this
[46:00] now I don't know if I left a little
[46:01] question I want to just clarify this on
[46:04] Sunday I was talking about how at the
[46:06] beginning there of the sermon marriage
[46:09] and divorce now I wasn't talking about a
[46:12] man I was talking about ministers men
[46:14] who have been married and divorced and
[46:16] believed they still have rights to the
[46:18] pulpit now right in the very early
[46:20] portions of marriage and divorce brother
[46:22] Branham says if there is a spiritual
[46:25] question or I mean sorry sorry-sorry
[46:29] back up if there is a scriptural
[46:31] question there is a scriptural answer
[46:36] now he doesn't say go check out my
[46:38] certain sermon for the answer but he
[46:41] says it's a scriptural answer and we're
[46:44] looking my brother and sister in the day
[46:46] that people by interpretation of the
[46:49] message are coming up with a different
[46:51] conclusion than this word of God amen
[46:54] so you know what some people don't like
[46:56] that don't think we're progressive
[46:57] enough don't think we're in tune enough
[47:00] with the revelation of the message I
[47:02] think I'll just stick with the prophets
[47:04] side of it when he said if it's a
[47:06] scriptural question it'll have a
[47:08] scriptural answer and if I can't find
[47:10] their answer in the Bible I won't accept
[47:12] their answer and so it just makes it
[47:15] actually quite simple for the believer
[47:17] because he can then just simply say well
[47:21] brother so-and-so I'll just use myself
[47:22] brother Paul preached this is that in
[47:25] line
[47:26] with the Bible now my brother and sister
[47:29] no matter how many quotes I might give
[47:30] you or how many ideologies I might give
[47:33] you or brother so-and-so said if it
[47:36] doesn't line up with this you have every
[47:38] right to say I refuse that amen but if
[47:41] it does line up is we'll touch on that
[47:43] in just a little bit I'm getting ahead
[47:45] of myself
[47:45] amen but if there comes a time in a
[47:48] place Amen where every bit of rubber if
[47:50] you have can pardon the expression every
[47:52] bit of rubber has to hit the road if
[47:54] you're gonna go anywhere at all Amen you
[47:56] can't just have one side of the tire
[47:58] setting there and say well we're gonna
[48:00] take a trip you gotta make a move
[48:02] Amen all the rubbers got to hit the road
[48:04] and once again I just say this not in
[48:07] any animal you know animosities or
[48:10] anything but my brother and sister it's
[48:12] come a time for people to quit saying
[48:15] say only what the Prophet said that's
[48:18] the byline cuz usually they have the
[48:20] quote to produce to you of what the
[48:22] Prophet said but let's say all all a
[48:26] double-l all the prophets said man with
[48:29] all that the prophet said we have
[48:31] balance amen which brother George sends
[48:34] greetings to you amen
[48:36] whenever I think of balance I think of
[48:38] the fact that he's like brother Paul
[48:40] your pulpit it's not balanced but it was
[48:46] just given to us it wasn't of my
[48:47] creation so amen now look I want to go
[48:51] right in here and carry this thought
[48:52] right over into revelations 1 and 9 is
[48:56] where we'll start I John who also am
[49:00] your brother and companion in
[49:02] tribulation and in the kingdom and
[49:05] patience of Jesus Christ was in the isle
[49:08] that is called Patmos for the word of
[49:11] God and for the testimony of Jesus
[49:13] Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[49:18] Day you see pop wasn't there I mean John
[49:23] wasn't there just currently like I don't
[49:26] know why God sent me here John knew
[49:28] there was purpose in his life and he
[49:31] knew that the only way that John could
[49:33] live was with the Spirit of God alive in
[49:37] him and so there he is a
[49:39] on that particular day now my brother
[49:42] and sister we know that John because
[49:44] this is a law did not give any exemption
[49:46] whatever struggle you had Enoch had Amen
[49:50] whatever things face Enoch faced a man
[49:53] whatever you faced John faced amen
[49:56] so God's not going to give a pass or an
[49:58] exemption to any generation amen
[50:01] everyone faces the challenge of the day
[50:05] now obviously they didn't have to worry
[50:07] about internet to Netflix and a lot of
[50:09] things like that my brother and sister
[50:11] they didn't have a lot of the nonsense
[50:13] in the same way but remember those
[50:15] spirits were still there amen so he said
[50:19] I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day oh
[50:21] that makes me excited especially
[50:23] studying this and I heard behind me a
[50:26] great voice as of a trumpet saying I am
[50:29] Alpha and Omega now my brother and
[50:31] sister this could not be an angel this
[50:34] could not just be a Messenger of God
[50:38] because they could not take the position
[50:40] to say I am Alpha and Omega this was
[50:45] none other than our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:47] himself hallelujah the first and the
[50:51] last and what thou seest write in a book
[50:54] and send it unto the seven churches
[50:57] which are in Asia unto Ephesus Smyrna
[51:00] and unto Pergamos and unto Thyatira and
[51:03] unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and
[51:05] unto Laodicea and I turned to see the
[51:08] voice that spake with me and being
[51:11] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[51:15] now we'll touch on that in just a little
[51:17] while and in the midst of the seven
[51:20] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[51:23] man oh look at this
[51:26] John had revelation my brother and
[51:29] sister he wasn't just saying hey there
[51:31] was some guy standing there
[51:33] it was likened unto the Son of Man
[51:35] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[51:38] and Girt about the paps with a golden
[51:40] girdle so we look at this and realize
[51:43] that John anointed by the spirit entered
[51:47] into that spirit my brother and sister
[51:49] the prophet of God showed us so clearly
[51:51] how that the Holy Ghost is a
[51:53] gentleman and he comes where he is
[51:55] invited and he is also timid as it were
[51:59] like a dove and if the atmosphere is not
[52:01] correct
[52:02] he will go up as it were to the limb and
[52:04] wait till the atmosphere is correct but
[52:07] the key we must remember tonight is he
[52:10] goes where he is invited oh lord I asked
[52:14] you come here Lord tonight not only just
[52:17] come here tonight go home with us amen
[52:20] be with us in the morning noon the night
[52:22] Lord because that's the only way we can
[52:25] be satisfied my brother and sister a
[52:27] world crying out for peace reading
[52:29] articles about how this is a troubled
[52:31] age they're talking about the the the
[52:33] whole narcotic addiction the whole thing
[52:37] it's a worse pandemic than this virus
[52:40] will ever be my brother and sister but
[52:43] they still won't stop it's enough that
[52:46] they can't stop they won't stop the flow
[52:49] of drugs come on we can knock whole
[52:54] nations down to the beat them right down
[52:56] to the ground but we can't stop oh my
[52:59] brother and sister know this nation the
[53:02] prophet of God said 1956 What did he say
[53:05] about America they rejected God now when
[53:08] something starts to rot my brother and
[53:11] sister it doesn't rot from the outside
[53:13] in it rots from the inside out
[53:16] now how rotten is this nation that it's
[53:19] now reached the surface it's pretty
[53:22] rotten hallelujah so you see what's
[53:25] happening is is we're looking at a time
[53:27] now that all of these things are coming
[53:30] into fruition and what is happening is
[53:33] Satan is doing his very best to keep you
[53:36] and I out of the Spirit of God amen we
[53:40] get burdened with work with health with
[53:42] family all of these things that burden
[53:44] us that come down and weigh upon us that
[53:47] comes to the place now if I'm not
[53:49] preaching to you tonight don't reject it
[53:51] just say Amen because it'll this be the
[53:54] truth it doesn't have to apply to you
[53:55] but brother and sister we can get so out
[53:58] of the spirit that we cannot even
[54:01] sometimes pray that God would come on
[54:04] the scene to deliver us we simply become
[54:06] complete
[54:07] we paralyze all my child's lost what am
[54:10] I going to do we cry day and night we
[54:12] cry day and night we serve the prince of
[54:15] feasts amen he is in our present he is
[54:19] the one in control we need to stop and
[54:22] say Lord I've got to get out of this old
[54:24] carnal thinking I gotta get into your
[54:27] spirit which is a spirit of peace now
[54:30] peace does not mean lackadaisical peace
[54:33] does not mean that we become lazy well
[54:35] God will take care of it we have our
[54:38] part to play but we need to have the
[54:40] confidence that God is in control and we
[54:44] can trust him amen so if Satan is trying
[54:47] to get you out of the spirit and into
[54:50] the flesh to where you worry here and
[54:53] you be there my brother and sister
[54:55] rebuked that in the name of Jesus Christ
[54:57] take that very need that you have if you
[55:01] have a child not serving God I have a
[55:03] child not serving God if you have family
[55:05] as it were sons and laws daughters and
[55:08] laws grandchildren whatever it might be
[55:10] my brother and sister it can weigh very
[55:12] heavy upon it and you can just fret and
[55:15] fast but if you notice it doesn't change
[55:17] Amen but when you get a piece about it
[55:20] and you say Lord I held that baby in my
[55:23] hands and I handed him to the preacher
[55:25] or maybe he was the preacher and you
[55:28] just committed that child to the Lord
[55:30] you saw them under a commitment get
[55:33] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[55:35] you saw them labor and you saw them slip
[55:38] away and we're not happy about the
[55:40] slipping away but my brother and sister
[55:42] I would rather with confidence claim
[55:45] them in Jesus Christ then be the
[55:47] sourpuss that is always crying my
[55:50] children are lost my children are lost
[55:52] how about we testify my children are
[55:55] coming back amen my health is coming
[55:59] back amen the Liberty I had in Jesus
[56:02] Christ is coming back and as we make
[56:06] those steps you will find as you enter
[56:08] into the Spirit of God you enter into
[56:11] his presence you find a Liberty like you
[56:14] never had before you find a Liberty that
[56:17] the wheels fall off the car and you're
[56:19] able to
[56:20] say lord thank you I'm fixing to see a
[56:23] supernatural event the wheels will
[56:25] either be put back on the car or there's
[56:27] a better car coming amen now that's just
[56:30] a carnal example but my brother and
[56:32] sisters see we can't have it two ways we
[56:35] cannot be out here sighing and crying
[56:37] although is me and be in the spirit of
[56:40] the Lord hallelujah now we are called to
[56:44] take one position or the other amen we
[56:47] have no ability now I say this if you'd
[56:50] understand from a farmer's point of view
[56:52] my dad used to the struggles that
[56:55] started in the original message Church
[56:57] here in the valley my dad you know as
[56:59] things were starting to heat up people
[57:01] taken sides one side thinking no big
[57:04] deal for the pastor to have a racehorse
[57:06] and go traveling with young ladies to
[57:08] this place in that place and and some
[57:11] people just didn't have any problem they
[57:12] make statements like well I have
[57:14] confidence in my pastor well my brother
[57:16] and sister I trust people too you trust
[57:19] people
[57:20] we just don't trust the devil amen and
[57:22] so you know the thing is the scripture
[57:24] told us to flee from the very appearance
[57:26] amen so it is a matter where there
[57:29] anything went right or wrong it didn't
[57:30] look good
[57:31] amen boy if we would just judge things a
[57:34] lot of people would just judge things by
[57:36] that and that alone they wouldn't have
[57:38] to worry about details they just say
[57:40] this ain't looking good they'd run from
[57:42] it
[57:42] hallelujah oh my I better get going
[57:46] along here else we'll be here all night
[57:47] and already just really squashed that on
[57:49] Sunday didn't I amen
[57:51] now look here my brother and sister in
[57:54] the church ages the patmans vision
[57:57] brother Branham says here in Revelations
[57:58] 110 I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[58:01] Day and heard behind me a great voice as
[58:04] of a trumpet I was in the spirit isn't
[58:07] that just beautiful my I love that you
[58:11] could just call those words the whole of
[58:14] the Christian life hallelujah amen that
[58:18] stirred my heart to think of it it's the
[58:20] whole a man I'm in the spirit not just a
[58:23] spirit but the spirit of the king Amen
[58:26] hallelujah if we are going to live as
[58:28] Christians we have to be in his spirit
[58:32] now my brother and sister
[58:34] I said I was gonna make some direct
[58:35] statements tonight so don't take them
[58:37] too radically serious unless they apply
[58:39] and then take them very radically
[58:41] serious but if we're living life day by
[58:46] day week after week month by month year
[58:48] by year and we're not in his spirit are
[58:51] we Christians don't say that is
[58:59] condemnation but it's an evidence right
[59:03] we all go through droughts don't we my
[59:07] brother Chris sings that song
[59:09] down in the valley amen well you know
[59:12] what the deserts usually down in the
[59:14] valley and when you're down in the
[59:16] desert my brother and sister life is
[59:18] tough and you don't feel in the spirit
[59:20] but somewhere along the line God's going
[59:23] to bring you back up out of that valley
[59:25] or that desert and bring you into a
[59:27] mountaintop and there you're going to
[59:29] look back and realize just as the song
[59:31] says that something was formed something
[59:33] was secured in you down in the valley
[59:35] that's where you have the decision to
[59:38] make I will serve Him or I will quit oh
[59:42] my brother and sister when it's all easy
[59:44] everybody's a Christian hallelujah now I
[59:47] grew up with this drilled in my head my
[59:50] daddy used to say it all the time he'd
[59:52] say son if farming was easy everyone
[59:55] would do it
[59:55] so you know that would apply to a lot of
[59:58] things right I want to apply it tonight
[1:00:00] to being Christians if being a real
[1:00:02] Christian was easy everyone would do it
[1:00:07] hallelujah we have to be in his spirit
[1:00:10] John was not talking about being in his
[1:00:12] own spirit now my brother and sister the
[1:00:14] prophet of God talked about sometimes
[1:00:16] you know that people talk about being in
[1:00:18] the spirit having the Holy Spirit
[1:00:20] brother branham even refers to it but
[1:00:21] really what they're doing is just
[1:00:23] sharing their spirit we don't want to
[1:00:25] share our spirit my brother and sister
[1:00:27] that would be a wreck that would be a
[1:00:30] real wreck that would have not brought
[1:00:33] this these visions had to be the Spirit
[1:00:36] of God it has to be the Spirit of God
[1:00:38] with us - or all our efforts are in vain
[1:00:40] Paul said I will pray in the spirit I
[1:00:43] will sing in the spirit I will live
[1:00:46] in the spirit amen if there is anything
[1:00:49] good that will come to me has to be
[1:00:52] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[1:00:55] word hallelujah there we are here's the
[1:00:59] prophet of God once again taking us back
[1:01:01] to the word Amen there's the
[1:01:04] confirmation Amen and may manifest by
[1:01:07] the results it bears my brother and
[1:01:10] sister here's the thing
[1:01:12] we cannot no matter how we we dress it
[1:01:15] up it doesn't matter you put a tutu on
[1:01:17] it it doesn't matter if you put perfume
[1:01:19] on it a pig is a pig
[1:01:21] it will bring forth the fruit or
[1:01:23] manifestation of a pig amen now that's a
[1:01:26] little bit blunt speaking but my brother
[1:01:28] and sister the problem we've got around
[1:01:30] the message is we have people that are
[1:01:32] closeted this and closeted that and this
[1:01:34] and that and whatever and then stand up
[1:01:37] and say we are the message my brother
[1:01:39] and sister that's why sometimes I've
[1:01:41] I've been criticized for saying this so
[1:01:43] I'll probably get criticized again but
[1:01:45] at some times it just really bothers me
[1:01:47] to use the term message because you can
[1:01:50] look from A to Z and almost everything
[1:01:53] is I believe this message but what is it
[1:01:57] producing I hold this message as it were
[1:02:03] to a very high standard in fact as
[1:02:06] brother Tim prayed Lord we're not worthy
[1:02:09] but we're worthy Lord what a paradox I'm
[1:02:12] not worthy but I'm worthy
[1:02:15] amen because my brother and sister hold
[1:02:17] this message to a high standard we don't
[1:02:19] want to lower this message down where
[1:02:21] it's just common to be trampled on a man
[1:02:23] as the scripture said throwing the Pearl
[1:02:25] before the swine my brother and sister I
[1:02:27] sometimes wonder if the hog isn't in
[1:02:28] church I probably didn't need to have
[1:02:36] said that did I as surely as John needed
[1:02:41] to be in the spirit to receive these
[1:02:43] tremendous revelations fresh from Jesus
[1:02:46] we need to be in the spirit to
[1:02:49] understand the revelation that God had
[1:02:53] given to us to live by in his word for
[1:02:56] it is the same spirit look at this look
[1:02:59] at it this way
[1:03:00] all too many read the Bible where it
[1:03:02] says in acts 2:38 repent you know let me
[1:03:06] back up I I got a note about this later
[1:03:08] in my thought but I just wanted to to
[1:03:11] put this now brother Branham talks about
[1:03:14] in other places in the message I didn't
[1:03:16] bring him out tonight because I didn't
[1:03:17] want to draw it out but brother Brown
[1:03:19] says we need to be in the spirit to
[1:03:21] understand the revelations that God has
[1:03:24] given to us to live by in his word now
[1:03:26] brother branham's talking about how to
[1:03:29] see and he is explaining that the word
[1:03:31] to see the kingdom of God is not as it
[1:03:34] were with our eyes to see the kingdom of
[1:03:37] God but it is to understand now my
[1:03:41] brother and sister to understand God my
[1:03:44] brother God's ways are so much higher
[1:03:46] than our ways
[1:03:46] amen there's no way that we as humans
[1:03:49] are going to understand God this is why
[1:03:51] I always find it interesting when you
[1:03:53] hear these people interpreting the Bible
[1:03:56] and they're saying well this means God
[1:03:58] meant this my brother and sister they
[1:04:01] don't have a clue what God meant unless
[1:04:03] they have revelation that fits from
[1:04:05] Genesis to Revelation unless it has
[1:04:08] continuity all the way through the Word
[1:04:10] of God they are taking an intellectual
[1:04:12] approach by some interpretation of a
[1:04:15] language of a region of a certain age
[1:04:18] and saying that's what it meant but
[1:04:20] brother Branham comes along and says now
[1:04:22] this isn't to see with your eyes this is
[1:04:24] to see or understand like an individual
[1:04:28] would say I just don't see it I just
[1:04:32] don't understand it so we come to the
[1:04:35] place to understand how important
[1:04:39] understanding is or seeing that takes a
[1:04:43] revelation from Almighty God amen you
[1:04:45] can't just intellectually pick it up and
[1:04:47] say I see it my brother and sister God's
[1:04:50] got to reveal it to a real son or
[1:04:52] daughter of God amen hallelujah well all
[1:04:56] too many read the Bible where it says in
[1:04:57] acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every
[1:05:00] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:01] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[1:05:04] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:06] just pass right on they don't see it
[1:05:13] if they saw it now I hope this this
[1:05:15] struck me deep I hope it strikes you
[1:05:17] deep too if they saw it by getting in
[1:05:20] the spirit they would know that if they
[1:05:23] want to receive the Holy Spirit they
[1:05:25] need to repent and be baptized in the
[1:05:29] name of the Lord Jesus and God would be
[1:05:32] duty-bound to fulfill his word by
[1:05:35] filling them with the Holy Ghost but if
[1:05:37] we just read the scripture as is we'd
[1:05:40] share hey read acts 2:38 somebody with
[1:05:42] no anointing reads that well I don't see
[1:05:45] any different I've been told this so
[1:05:47] many times I don't see any difference
[1:05:49] between that and Matthew 28:19 you know
[1:05:53] it's baptism we did we just have to be
[1:05:55] baptizing and they just had two
[1:05:57] different little methods that they did
[1:05:59] it you know kind of like the difference
[1:06:00] between you know the Methodists and the
[1:06:03] Episcopalians and and the Lutheran's and
[1:06:05] the Catholics and and so we don't see no
[1:06:09] big deal see they're not in the spirit
[1:06:11] they're not catching anything that the
[1:06:13] word is conveying but thank you lord can
[1:06:16] we say thank you Lord when we saw that
[1:06:19] we knew there was something much deeper
[1:06:21] there wasn't just some scripture to be
[1:06:24] fulfilled okay if I go do this but the
[1:06:27] key that unlocked acts 2:38 my brother
[1:06:31] and sister was the revelation that in
[1:06:33] death now take this back to the water
[1:06:36] when the angel was on the water there
[1:06:39] was power in the water amen and when the
[1:06:42] angel left the water was just water and
[1:06:44] every true son and daughter of God with
[1:06:46] a revelation of who they are in Jesus
[1:06:49] Christ when they went down in the water
[1:06:51] I can assure you there was an angel of
[1:06:54] Almighty God on the water where they
[1:06:57] were baptized at that time right there
[1:06:59] if they did it mechanically with no more
[1:07:02] knowledge as a young child maybe just
[1:07:05] stirred in their heart without an
[1:07:06] understanding you would say well would
[1:07:08] there be will they really do that my
[1:07:10] brother and sister in the innocence of a
[1:07:12] child being moved by the Spirit of God
[1:07:15] to fulfill that scripture I can assure
[1:07:18] you an angel of God come down and
[1:07:20] visited that water when that child was
[1:07:23] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:24] Christ now
[1:07:26] child will have to go on catch a full
[1:07:28] revelation of who they are and when they
[1:07:30] catch that but you understand God
[1:07:32] obligates himself as a prophet of God
[1:07:35] said here and he's not going to withhold
[1:07:37] that from a child who in sincerity and
[1:07:40] innocence went down in baptism without a
[1:07:43] full understanding amen
[1:07:45] otherwise some people now forgive me for
[1:07:48] putting it this way but some people
[1:07:49] their baptism would be null and void
[1:07:51] until they were 50 or 60 years old and
[1:07:54] after 30 or 40 years and the message
[1:07:56] caught a revelation but you see God knew
[1:07:59] and God visit him there at that time and
[1:08:02] said now it might take a season for this
[1:08:06] to be fulfilled but I will fulfill it
[1:08:09] and they were a candidate and they were
[1:08:11] moved by my spirit to take acts 2:38 in
[1:08:15] to their soul and say this is the truth
[1:08:18] hallelujah much different than a
[1:08:20] completely intellectual approach to it
[1:08:23] hallelujah but did not get in this
[1:08:25] spirit when reading did we ask God for
[1:08:27] His Spirit to teach us the real truth of
[1:08:29] it I wonder sometimes my brother and
[1:08:31] sister if we really truly honestly are
[1:08:34] approaching the things of the word of
[1:08:36] God the message correctly how often now
[1:08:39] I don't know so I have to just put this
[1:08:41] out this way
[1:08:42] you receive reject say okay I don't fit
[1:08:45] that but it's the truth
[1:08:46] however you want to do it but my
[1:08:48] brother's sister I wonder how many of us
[1:08:50] actually stop and say Lord reveal this
[1:08:53] to me not some big broad cross section
[1:08:56] of like Lord reveal the message to me
[1:08:59] but how about stopping on even our
[1:09:01] particular Scripture and say Lord I need
[1:09:05] you I know there's more here Lord I need
[1:09:09] you to reveal this now my brother and
[1:09:12] sister you can't sit there as some cold
[1:09:14] formal powerless Christian say Lord
[1:09:16] reveal to me that will not apply you've
[1:09:19] got to get in the spirit and in
[1:09:22] sincerity ask God for the word to be
[1:09:25] opened up oh but when the word is opened
[1:09:29] up our life will never be the same
[1:09:33] hallelujah Amen we can't just stop and
[1:09:37] say oh praise the Lord I got a new
[1:09:38] revelation here
[1:09:39] Jack doesn't work that way I'll tell you
[1:09:43] what it does it checks down through the
[1:09:44] heart and says heart is everything all
[1:09:46] right
[1:09:47] hearts said everything in order hearts
[1:09:49] stand up for the word hearts amen to the
[1:09:52] word heart produce the word oh that's
[1:09:55] when you can start checking things off
[1:09:57] hallelujah oh my did was God for His
[1:10:01] Spirit to teach us the real truth of it
[1:10:02] if we did mmm we don't call the elders
[1:10:11] we call the elders to confess our sins
[1:10:13] be annoying didn't prayed for and that
[1:10:15] would be that it might not come
[1:10:17] immediately but in his spirit is all
[1:10:19] over there's no other Court of Appeal
[1:10:22] God will fulfill his word oh we need to
[1:10:27] get in the spirit grace burn Akal amen
[1:10:30] we need to get in the spirit and then
[1:10:32] things will be done see we can't be a
[1:10:36] cold formal power church and say well we
[1:10:39] believe the message we know God sent a
[1:10:40] prophet
[1:10:41] I believe God called me okay everything
[1:10:42] else will just kind of work its way out
[1:10:44] look I want to see things get done
[1:10:46] amen I want to see some of our our our
[1:10:48] loved ones and some of around us that
[1:10:51] are struggling and have issues and and
[1:10:53] things I want to see them delivered amen
[1:10:56] so what we got to do is come to the
[1:10:57] place we get in the spirit and then see
[1:10:59] things don't go through the acts first
[1:11:02] get in the spirit then go through the
[1:11:06] acts and watch what God will do
[1:11:09] hallelujah and it's not set back and
[1:11:11] wonder if and when and where and how
[1:11:13] God's going to work in our church let's
[1:11:16] get in this spirit he'll do the work we
[1:11:19] need to get in the spirit hallelujah now
[1:11:22] look how God works now we understand
[1:11:25] that the Bible teaches us that a man
[1:11:28] cannot even understand the Word of God
[1:11:31] without the Holy Ghost so we have
[1:11:35] thousands or tens of thousands hundreds
[1:11:37] of thousands of people who are
[1:11:39] interpreting to themselves or to others
[1:11:42] the scripture and without the Holy Ghost
[1:11:46] it has to then fall back automatically
[1:11:49] my brother and sister falls back into an
[1:11:51] intellectual
[1:11:54] we're not exempt around the message from
[1:11:56] this kind of things this is where mid of
[1:11:59] the false doctrines come in is because
[1:12:01] men without the Holy Ghost maybe they're
[1:12:03] anointed speakers they must be gifted
[1:12:06] men to speak if they hadn't been a
[1:12:08] preacher they might have been a
[1:12:09] politician or a corporate leader or of a
[1:12:12] civic leader but my brother and sister
[1:12:14] that doesn't account for getting into
[1:12:16] the spirit and getting into the mind of
[1:12:19] God to be able to speak so without the
[1:12:22] Holy Ghost we don't even have any right
[1:12:24] to interpret or get into the Word of God
[1:12:26] because without it we cannot now here it
[1:12:29] is my brother and sisters we look at
[1:12:31] this uh-oh got ahead of myself we're
[1:12:36] good though
[1:12:37] first Corinthians 2:14 brings up a good
[1:12:41] point but the natural man receiveth not
[1:12:43] the things of the Spirit of God it
[1:12:48] didn't say might not right
[1:12:51] he said he received not period that's
[1:12:54] just blunt plain out didn't get it
[1:12:59] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:13:01] the Spirit of God for they are
[1:13:02] foolishness unto him now man night might
[1:13:05] not declare it is foolishness but if you
[1:13:08] want to know whether one believes it's
[1:13:10] foolish or real it's very simple test
[1:13:14] you know how we apply that test or how
[1:13:18] that a test is applied not us applying
[1:13:20] it but whether they do it or not
[1:13:33] in the story of the Titanic many people
[1:13:37] drowned because when they said you
[1:13:39] probably should put your life jackets on
[1:13:42] many of them said this ship is
[1:13:45] unsinkable so the announcement put on
[1:13:50] your life jackets was foolishness to
[1:13:53] them now the Holy Ghost said that Lord
[1:14:00] would come as a thief in the night we
[1:14:04] judge that whether that's true or
[1:14:06] foolish by our preparation to that
[1:14:10] coming event lord help us help us Lord
[1:14:15] get us in the spirit to realize when you
[1:14:17] warned this when the prophet of God said
[1:14:19] we are so close to the coming of the
[1:14:22] Lord and people are like it's been 50
[1:14:24] years well my brother and sister
[1:14:28] foolishness will tell you we have plenty
[1:14:30] of time if we are anointed and in the
[1:14:35] spirit I think what we ought to do so I
[1:14:40] think we ought to put our lifejackets on
[1:14:42] right now and if the ship doesn't sink
[1:14:45] I'll just take my lifejacket off later
[1:14:50] are you with me I think what we ought to
[1:14:58] do is get ready for a rapture right now
[1:15:03] and if it doesn't take place and maybe
[1:15:07] they would be those in here that would
[1:15:10] be young you know brother Ivan brother
[1:15:12] Chris but there Jay is not so young but
[1:15:15] anyway sorry about that buddy maybe
[1:15:20] they'll be burying us I say this in
[1:15:24] sincerity they may be burying us saying
[1:15:30] last rites and and prayers said in song
[1:15:33] sung but I would rather go every day
[1:15:40] Lord I'm ready Lord I'm ready Lord I'm
[1:15:44] examining my life
[1:15:45] from top to bottom inside and out I'm
[1:15:48] going back to your word and I'm asking
[1:15:51] you Father show me anything that won't
[1:15:54] go through the filter and if I die of
[1:15:58] old age praise the Lord well amen
[1:16:05] neither can he know them because they
[1:16:07] are spiritually discerned so men must
[1:16:10] get in the Spirit of God for these
[1:16:13] things of God to even make tents may
[1:16:18] Amen now look I just want to bring this
[1:16:21] about so God was bringing John into a
[1:16:23] position you see the book of Revelation
[1:16:26] had to be written God had a plan a
[1:16:29] format by which he was bringing it out
[1:16:32] as it would be to come to speak as they
[1:16:36] often term the book of revelations a
[1:16:38] book of apocalypse to bring about the
[1:16:40] whole picture of what was taking place
[1:16:43] and the culmination of time and how that
[1:16:46] those wicked the tear would be brought
[1:16:48] together and the tear would come now my
[1:16:50] brother and sister when it comes into
[1:16:53] one-world government when it comes to
[1:16:55] all of these kind of things there will
[1:16:58] be a forcing but you have to understand
[1:17:01] the prophet of God shows us very clearly
[1:17:03] in the word and that the mark of the
[1:17:06] beast takes place long before the force
[1:17:10] of the tribulation hits mankind amen
[1:17:14] before they have realized that they are
[1:17:16] now bound into the system they will have
[1:17:19] already rejected the Son of God amen
[1:17:23] they will offer already rejected the
[1:17:25] word for their day and then when they
[1:17:28] feel the crush they will cry out but
[1:17:31] just as it is in some countries where
[1:17:34] they have had a transformation from
[1:17:36] serving God to to becoming almost
[1:17:38] heathen nations what will happen is is
[1:17:41] they will not many of them will not be
[1:17:43] crying out for mercy from God but they
[1:17:46] will actually be cursing God they will
[1:17:49] curse God for the very existence that
[1:17:51] they are caught in not realizing the
[1:17:53] reason they are where they're at is they
[1:17:55] rejected God back up the road somewhere
[1:17:58] else
[1:17:59] they'll view it as some failure they
[1:18:01] will blame it upon the churches that
[1:18:03] will blame it upon ministries they will
[1:18:05] blame it on all kinds of things but my
[1:18:06] brother and sister
[1:18:07] there'll be no pastor now look I know
[1:18:09] this is going to be a bold strong
[1:18:11] statement no matter what a pastor has
[1:18:13] done to humanity my brother and sister
[1:18:15] no pastor will send a single soul to
[1:18:18] hell because we within you and I between
[1:18:24] humanity sons and daughters of God we
[1:18:27] have within us the ability to lay
[1:18:29] everything on the altar committed to God
[1:18:32] ask God for strength ask God for
[1:18:34] guidance and I'm gonna say some blunt
[1:18:36] things right here my brother and sister
[1:18:38] I was preaching in a church one time and
[1:18:40] I use this very example and I was
[1:18:42] talking about how that there are certain
[1:18:43] things we go through in life certain
[1:18:45] things that we will we will experience
[1:18:48] and we won't like those things those
[1:18:50] things are hard they're crushing things
[1:18:52] but you see my brother and sister I use
[1:18:54] example about how that there will be no
[1:18:57] excuses on the on that day the white
[1:18:59] throne of judgment no excuse no one will
[1:19:01] come before God and say well this was my
[1:19:05] circumstance of what happened in my life
[1:19:08] and because of that I wasn't able to
[1:19:10] serve God I use the example of somebody
[1:19:12] being molested and a sister in the
[1:19:15] church young woman just starts sobbing
[1:19:17] my brother and sister is hard it breaks
[1:19:19] your heart you don't know what all the
[1:19:20] circumstances are but I'll tell you what
[1:19:22] it is it won't matter whether it's from
[1:19:24] a drug active a drug addict or a
[1:19:26] prostitute
[1:19:27] someone molested someone whatever it
[1:19:29] might be God will bring someone from
[1:19:32] that and deliver them fill them with the
[1:19:35] Holy Ghost
[1:19:35] put the Spirit of God within them make
[1:19:38] them an overcomer because there'll be no
[1:19:41] excuse on that day hallelujah and you
[1:19:43] say but brother Paul that's just said
[1:19:45] that's pretty blunt no I'm making the
[1:19:47] point my brother and sister we have no
[1:19:50] excuse we have the presence of God the
[1:19:52] Spirit of God is here in our midst
[1:19:56] all we got to do is let go and let God
[1:19:59] have his way amen but as long as the
[1:20:02] flesh is still alive it will keep us
[1:20:05] from getting into the Spirit of God Lord
[1:20:08] let our flesh die tonight hey man let us
[1:20:10] die to our cell
[1:20:12] and let Christ live amen hallelujah
[1:20:15] because we are beyond that we are called
[1:20:18] beyond that the word has provided a way
[1:20:21] beyond that for us
[1:20:23] hallelujah people are bitter all this
[1:20:25] thing happened to me all these years ago
[1:20:28] this certain thing happened to me I'm
[1:20:31] bitter my brother and sister you let go
[1:20:33] of that you get in the Spirit of God you
[1:20:36] commit that to the Lord you pray for the
[1:20:39] person that hurts you
[1:20:40] because God's lifted you above that and
[1:20:42] filled you with the Holy Ghost empowered
[1:20:45] you with the Spirit of God that you can
[1:20:47] rise into the heavenlies we're not an
[1:20:49] eagle that's been blowed down in the
[1:20:51] brush we're not an eagle that's decided
[1:20:54] to roost on a chicken coop pole we are
[1:20:56] sons and daughters of God called to rise
[1:20:59] into heavenly places to soar in the
[1:21:01] heavenlies in the spirit of Almighty God
[1:21:04] hallelujah we're the power of God can be
[1:21:07] let go to be put on display but if we
[1:21:11] got it all bound up we got people my
[1:21:13] brother and sister I don't say this
[1:21:14] lightly it makes my heart broken but we
[1:21:17] got people saying about the seals all
[1:21:18] know know this and that and whatever but
[1:21:20] I'll tell you they don't got to worry
[1:21:22] many of those people don't got to worry
[1:21:23] about whether the seals are broken
[1:21:24] because they have bound the Bible up so
[1:21:27] tight that it's not even living it's not
[1:21:32] even living and if the Bible's not
[1:21:34] living you don't need to worry about
[1:21:35] whether the seals are open or not if
[1:21:37] this word is not enough to deliver you
[1:21:39] from your bitterness and your angers and
[1:21:42] all you've got cooped up held up inside
[1:21:45] of you if it's not enough to deliver you
[1:21:47] from that it won't matter whether all of
[1:21:49] that is finished or not hallelujah sorry
[1:21:52] for being so blunt but look at it my
[1:21:54] brother and sister you can't say I'm
[1:21:57] filled with the spirit but I've still
[1:21:58] angry at someone from 25 years ago you
[1:22:01] can't hate your brother and say you love
[1:22:04] God the scripture says you're a liar
[1:22:07] oh that sounds blunt but it's a truth if
[1:22:10] we got that kind of bitterness and that
[1:22:13] kind of angers and those things bound up
[1:22:15] and you say that you love God my brother
[1:22:18] and sister you might as well find a
[1:22:20] mirror somewhere look in that mirror and
[1:22:22] say Lord forgive me I'm a liar
[1:22:24] No hallelujah hallelujah you hear people
[1:22:29] say well this person did this and this
[1:22:31] person did that and I can never forgive
[1:22:33] them well you'll never move any further
[1:22:35] in your relationship with the Lord so
[1:22:37] you better find an altar right now and
[1:22:39] you better get down there and say Lord
[1:22:41] they hurt me they were unjust they were
[1:22:44] this they were cruel they were whatever
[1:22:45] but Lord forgive me and Lord I forgive
[1:22:49] them because I want to fly in the
[1:22:53] heavenlies I want to enter into the
[1:22:55] Spirit of God I don't want to be some
[1:22:58] earthbound eagle hallelujah walk around
[1:23:02] with our thumb in our suspenders I'm an
[1:23:04] eagle praise God well if you're an eagle
[1:23:06] start flying hallelujah Oh hallelujah
[1:23:13] huh
[1:23:16] well Brown says here and here you him
[1:23:18] look it's come to a place friend that
[1:23:21] this world is so awful it's going to
[1:23:23] make you prove every inch of ground you
[1:23:26] stand on we're not gonna say I hear it
[1:23:30] so much I've heard it preached and I'm
[1:23:31] not speaking down on this but it there's
[1:23:35] no content behind it when they preach us
[1:23:37] all we're the Bride of Christ we've
[1:23:39] overcome all things okay I believe that
[1:23:56] how thin is his ice I won't go there
[1:24:01] I'll just say if the life in us the
[1:24:06] atmosphere of our church right on down
[1:24:10] to our brother deals don't prove it
[1:24:14] don't claim it Amen it's time for us to
[1:24:20] get a great big mirror look in it and
[1:24:22] say Lord forgive me I've been lying I've
[1:24:25] been lying Lord it's gonna make you
[1:24:28] prove every inch you stand on Satan's
[1:24:31] going to do it remember Sunday up I
[1:24:32] shared that quote brother Brown said the
[1:24:35] devil he's doing his pushing but God's
[1:24:37] pushing back hallelujah and my God can
[1:24:41] push a whole lot harder than the devil
[1:24:42] can amen amen
[1:24:44] so you know what but God's gonna let you
[1:24:46] and I my brother and sister sometimes
[1:24:48] God just sets back just enough to see if
[1:24:51] you and I are actually going to invoke
[1:24:53] the word amen hallelujah you know I
[1:24:57] remember reading a story once a man a
[1:24:58] man committed a crime pretty much
[1:25:01] everybody knew he committed a crime but
[1:25:02] they couldn't prove he had committed the
[1:25:04] crime so they used some other little
[1:25:06] petty crime to get him drawn into court
[1:25:08] and then the prosecuting attorneys you
[1:25:12] know digging into this digging into this
[1:25:13] and they're sitting there and they're
[1:25:15] waiting for the man all he had to do is
[1:25:18] invoke the Fifth Amendment or whatever
[1:25:21] I'm not gonna I'm not going to wonder
[1:25:25] that what did they determine they used
[1:25:27] yeah I'm gonna remain silent because I
[1:25:29] would incriminate myself but what you
[1:25:32] know what he did the prosecuting
[1:25:34] attorney brought it in such a way that
[1:25:35] the man he never uses he you know and he
[1:25:40] starts and he lets out one detail and he
[1:25:42] lets out another detail and he lets out
[1:25:44] another detail and and the man's lawyer
[1:25:47] is as like stunned so stunned he doesn't
[1:25:51] even response basically a man just
[1:25:53] admits right in front the whole court
[1:25:54] that he did the crime my brother and
[1:25:57] sister the devil's here to tell you home
[1:25:59] brother Tim I believe God ordained you
[1:26:01] to say those words the devil's here to
[1:26:03] tell you you're not worthy you're not
[1:26:05] worthy
[1:26:06] you're not worthy and if we're not
[1:26:07] careful we start saying it I'm not
[1:26:10] worthy now I'm not talking to the term
[1:26:11] that brother Tim was preaching but I
[1:26:13] mean in that real deep down in the soul
[1:26:14] I'm not worthy I'm not worthy and you
[1:26:16] know while we could invoke that and and
[1:26:19] not incriminate herself but if we just
[1:26:22] keep doing that but what God wants us to
[1:26:24] do is stop and say sorry I'm forgiven
[1:26:27] I'm forgiven I'm sorry you can't find no
[1:26:30] record there's no record of me ever ever
[1:26:33] being a sinner ever being caught in the
[1:26:36] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[1:26:37] I've never been a lover of pleasure I've
[1:26:39] never been Hetty or high-minded Amen
[1:26:42] because I have been forgiven it's been
[1:26:45] wiped from the record hallelujah so
[1:26:49] you're gonna have to prove every inch of
[1:26:51] ground you stand on that means even when
[1:26:53] you feel unworthy you have to remind
[1:26:55] yourself Jesus Christ made me worthy the
[1:26:58] word said I am worthy and it's coming to
[1:27:02] a time where impersonations I think
[1:27:04] you'll like this most of you probably
[1:27:06] already read the quote I'm so slow we're
[1:27:08] impersonations and carnal thinking is
[1:27:10] going to be circumcised from the now
[1:27:14] remember God always puts that um what
[1:27:20] would you say the word just slipped my
[1:27:22] mind
[1:27:23] he always puts an emphasis right there's
[1:27:25] always something that quantifier there's
[1:27:28] the word always puts a quantifier always
[1:27:32] you go through the scripture there's
[1:27:33] always a quantifier impersonation I
[1:27:39] don't think he's going to be circumcised
[1:27:40] from the real true body of Christ you
[1:27:50] see what's happening now the prophet of
[1:27:52] God said three kinds of believers in the
[1:27:53] church but my brother and sister have
[1:27:55] you noticed that when the Holy Spirit
[1:27:58] comes down that two-edged sword starts
[1:28:00] to swing and how the make believer and
[1:28:03] the unbeliever always draws back but the
[1:28:05] real believer stands there it's hard you
[1:28:08] will quiver you will shake you will cry
[1:28:11] you might even scream and sob and
[1:28:13] whatever but you'll be standing there
[1:28:15] saying cut it away Lord cut it away from
[1:28:18] me
[1:28:19] I don't want to go another day Lord cut
[1:28:22] it away but to make believer and the
[1:28:25] unbeliever they start to run because
[1:28:27] they're afraid of that word but we
[1:28:29] recognize God will not cut one bit
[1:28:32] deeper than is necessary to get the
[1:28:34] unbelief and sin out of our life and
[1:28:36] he's saying right here this
[1:28:38] impersonation and carnal thinking is
[1:28:40] going to be circumcised which requires a
[1:28:42] knife and a cutting away and he's going
[1:28:48] to have a body that's pure and holy and
[1:28:51] filled with his spirit walking in his
[1:28:54] spirit doing the works that he did be
[1:28:56] faithful to that and if there would be
[1:28:59] one call we could cry out tonight no be
[1:29:02] faithful to that Saints don't let
[1:29:04] anything come in there and disrupt that
[1:29:07] be faithful and wants something real
[1:29:12] they're hungry and thirsting to find the
[1:29:14] real thing
[1:29:15] they don't want psychologies talking
[1:29:17] about the real believer this is a real
[1:29:19] believer oh I'll tell you my brother and
[1:29:21] sister unless something changed in the
[1:29:23] message when I hear people say we've got
[1:29:25] enough of a message oh it scares me to
[1:29:29] death not only do I feel sorry for them
[1:29:31] it scares me because what do they think
[1:29:34] or where do they think they are and that
[1:29:36] they can get I'm not hungry anymore I'm
[1:29:38] not thirsty anymore
[1:29:40] just give me a nibble here and give me a
[1:29:42] nibble there oh ho no not me I'm a real
[1:29:45] eagle I've been exercising my wings I've
[1:29:48] been flying by faith
[1:29:50] amen I'm hungry over time hallelujah and
[1:29:54] that applies naturally to hallelujah
[1:29:57] they're hungry and thirsting to find the
[1:29:59] real thing
[1:30:00] they don't want psychology they don't
[1:30:02] want some intellectual speech they want
[1:30:04] something that gives them the assurance
[1:30:06] something that makes this Bible live
[1:30:10] again hallelu
[1:30:14] I don't want a Bible as a book that we
[1:30:16] can read I wanted to live hallelujah Oh
[1:30:22] hallelujah let me hurry right along here
[1:30:26] yes I need to hurry right along amen
[1:30:30] look here in the in the Tok
[1:30:34] don't just come this far and say I
[1:30:37] believe the message see we're getting a
[1:30:40] lot of that and I know people I've been
[1:30:43] criticized I've been hammered on more
[1:30:45] than you can imagine in the last year
[1:30:47] over over me pushing on this but I
[1:30:50] promise you as long as you allow me to
[1:30:52] be your pastor God allowed me to be your
[1:30:53] pastor I'm gonna hammer on this because
[1:30:56] you see if we don't the message will
[1:30:59] just slide right off into
[1:31:00] denominationalism it will slide off very
[1:31:04] easily but the prophet of God made this
[1:31:06] statement my brother and sister I'm
[1:31:08] heard men say well the prophet of God
[1:31:09] missed it because the message has become
[1:31:12] a denomination but I thought to myself I
[1:31:14] didn't say anything it was in a in a
[1:31:16] public more or less forum area I didn't
[1:31:18] say anything my brother and sister
[1:31:20] because I didn't want to cause a ruckus
[1:31:21] but I'm telling you I felt like saying
[1:31:23] that's that's your church that's your
[1:31:25] version of the message that's who you
[1:31:28] are don't include me don't include grace
[1:31:32] Tabernacle in the denominational spirit
[1:31:35] cuz will reject that every single time
[1:31:39] hallelujah
[1:31:40] we're looking to be led by God we don't
[1:31:43] need to get a cue from somebody else on
[1:31:45] what we need to do we don't need someone
[1:31:47] to pick the tape for us to listen to we
[1:31:50] don't need some heavy-handed guidance
[1:31:52] from someone who thinks they're more
[1:31:53] spiritual than else we're gonna get in
[1:31:55] the spirit if we have been immature god
[1:31:58] help our immaturity if we have been a
[1:32:01] little negligent god forgive our
[1:32:03] negligence but we're not going to yield
[1:32:05] to some man-made leadership hallelujah I
[1:32:10] believe the message you oh just say what
[1:32:16] he said that's all you got to do just
[1:32:18] say what he said the prophet of God said
[1:32:21] you obeyed the messenger that might
[1:32:24] include fine in a church with the Holy
[1:32:25] Ghost filled pastor and being faithful
[1:32:27] at opposed to duty oh just say what he
[1:32:31] said we know we don't need the other
[1:32:33] part well good to those who you might
[1:32:36] hear this he told you obey the messenger
[1:32:39] well hallelujah if I sound strident I
[1:32:43] don't mean it
[1:32:45] I say it from my heart coming to Christ
[1:32:48] you say well I believe every words said
[1:32:50] brother branham that's good but that
[1:32:52] just being able to read this it almost
[1:32:58] be rude if these people are like oh I'm
[1:33:00] a believer oh you read you're not
[1:33:03] illiterate
[1:33:04] oh that sounds a little rude doesn't it
[1:33:07] take the message take it in - hmm he
[1:33:12] skipped the head right there didn't he
[1:33:14] right he just skipped right through the
[1:33:16] intellect the mental comprehension all
[1:33:19] of that skipped right through it take it
[1:33:21] into your heart that you must have the
[1:33:24] token the very life that was in price be
[1:33:28] in you when I see that I'll pass over
[1:33:33] you oh look it's not about we know the
[1:33:37] message we can quote the message let me
[1:33:39] finish this I know a brother he's a good
[1:33:40] man but I'm just referencing this to the
[1:33:42] ability that people have or sitting in
[1:33:44] his house one night in Tennessee and I
[1:33:47] was trying to remember a quote I just
[1:33:48] read and and you know like I've always
[1:33:52] been this way I got to stop but even at
[1:33:54] this moment I'm studying out of three
[1:33:56] different messages and I don't remember
[1:33:58] which one which quote and which thought
[1:34:00] came from because I got them all jumbled
[1:34:02] together because to me they're just one
[1:34:03] giant pool with beautiful things in it
[1:34:07] amen
[1:34:08] but look the brother just so
[1:34:10] intellectual this brother I do believe
[1:34:12] has Holy Ghost does have a revelation of
[1:34:13] the message but so intellectual so smart
[1:34:16] I said well you know brother branham
[1:34:18] said Dada and he goes oh that's in
[1:34:20] Christ the mystery of God revealed
[1:34:21] paragraph 128 if you say so I know the
[1:34:28] prophet of God said it and I said at
[1:34:31] this and he goes oh that souls that are
[1:34:33] in prison paragraph 256 okay yeah I
[1:34:39] don't even remember my phone number
[1:34:40] brother but I know price real and I
[1:34:45] always in this heart that's one thing I
[1:34:47] know see so what we got to do get beyond
[1:34:50] I I believe the message the devil the
[1:34:55] prophet of God said that devil Billy
[1:34:59] but the devil cannot get in the spirit
[1:35:03] of the Lord he had his chance he got
[1:35:06] lifted up in his pride in his position
[1:35:08] he had his chance he rejected it he'll
[1:35:11] never have another chance to get in the
[1:35:13] Spirit of the Lord so he's constantly
[1:35:16] now just following along impersonating
[1:35:18] and persecuting by the word that was
[1:35:21] meant for his deliverance now the seven
[1:35:24] churches back to the Patmos vision
[1:35:26] denominations which are man directed
[1:35:29] cannot be born of God my brother and
[1:35:33] sister the minute that they lose the
[1:35:36] Holy Ghost leadership and lose operating
[1:35:40] under the Spirit of the Lord it is no
[1:35:43] longer of God period which means if it
[1:35:48] goes there it actually brother Branham
[1:35:50] in another place says it never was in
[1:35:53] the Lord in the beginning
[1:35:56] wow that's pretty fun for it is the
[1:36:01] spirit not a man that gives life how
[1:36:03] thrilling it is to think of those seven
[1:36:05] lamps drawing life and light resources
[1:36:09] of that main bowl because they had their
[1:36:11] wicks dipped therein now I want you to
[1:36:14] take this right back to the book of
[1:36:17] Revelation as we was earlier when John
[1:36:20] is there now what does John see John
[1:36:24] turned to see the voice that spoke and
[1:36:26] being turned I saw the very first thing
[1:36:29] he doesn't see not that is as the son of
[1:36:31] man the very first thing he sees is
[1:36:34] seven golden candlesticks now I want you
[1:36:37] to keep that in mind as we as we look at
[1:36:39] this now how thrilling is think those
[1:36:41] seven lamps a drawing life and light
[1:36:44] from the resources of that main bowl
[1:36:46] because they had their wicks dipped
[1:36:48] there in each church age messenger is
[1:36:51] depicted here his life is on fire with
[1:36:54] the Holy Ghost his wick life has been
[1:36:57] immersed in Christ through that wick he
[1:37:00] is drawing the very life of Christ and
[1:37:02] by it gives out light to the church can
[1:37:05] we say thank you Lord what kind of light
[1:37:07] is he giving the very same light that
[1:37:10] was in the first lamp that was
[1:37:12] and right on down the ages to the
[1:37:14] present time of the last day messenger
[1:37:16] the same life and the same light is
[1:37:18] manifested by a life that is hid with
[1:37:21] Christ in God not only can we speak most
[1:37:25] of the messengers but every be Oh
[1:37:29] hallelujah
[1:37:31] what a fire Alleluia quantifier but

[1:37:57] accused once again a shovin brother
[1:37:59] branham to the side but people don't
[1:38:01] understand the law of the first-fruit
[1:38:03] and whatever the law of the first-fruit
[1:38:05] would declare as the bounty of the
[1:38:08] harvest let all of the harvest be the
[1:38:11] same and the first fruit was our Lord
[1:38:13] Jesus Christ and the first fruit of our
[1:38:16] age was brother Branham and we will come
[1:38:19] exactly like him because our wick is
[1:38:23] stuck into the same pool of oil and we
[1:38:28] are drawing the same lies oh not a life
[1:38:32] that had to pass through a prophet and
[1:38:34] then come down to us our wick is in the
[1:38:37] same oil the same reservoir hallelujah
[1:38:42] then a prophet of God was pulling from
[1:38:45] Oh are we come under our prophet of our
[1:38:48] age yes we have we could not circumvent
[1:38:51] that we could not leave him out of the
[1:38:53] picture but my brother and sister my
[1:38:56] wick your wick is stuck in that same oil
[1:39:00] Oh hallelujah
[1:39:02] I can get in the Spirit of God if I can
[1:39:06] just die to my flesh you know the
[1:39:08] prophet of God said that was a secret
[1:39:10] dry to this flesh Oh hallelujah
[1:39:15] oh and I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:39:17] sister look at this now we go on they're
[1:39:20] all drawing I'm not making this up
[1:39:24] I don't want to sound presumptuous or
[1:39:28] whatever I don't want to sound rude I'm
[1:39:33] just saying what the Prophet said
[1:39:37] they're all drawn from the same source
[1:39:40] they have all you know who that all is
[1:39:42] don't you and including the messenger of
[1:39:45] our age and the true believer Alleluia
[1:39:52] they've all been dipped into the same
[1:39:54] Bowl they're all dead to themselves and
[1:39:56] their lives are hid with Christ in God
[1:39:58] they are sealed in by the Holy Ghost
[1:40:00] Ephesians 4:13 grieve not the Holy
[1:40:02] Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto
[1:40:05] the day of redemption hallelujah oh man
[1:40:08] can pluck them I love this I should have
[1:40:10] I got him on my screen right here a
[1:40:12] great big highlighted and colored up
[1:40:14] letters and stuff here cuz look at this
[1:40:16] now he's talking about you and I no man
[1:40:20] can pluck them out of his hand nobody
[1:40:23] nobody this is why I made that statement
[1:40:26] earlier that no preacher can send you to
[1:40:28] hell because no one can pluck you out of
[1:40:31] God's hand
[1:40:33] hallelujah no matter how they lie in
[1:40:35] preachers there ever was no matter how
[1:40:38] many deceivers no matter how many
[1:40:40] Judas's show up on the scene you won't
[1:40:43] be turned to the side because you are
[1:40:45] bought with a price
[1:40:47] you are his amen you are hid in Christ
[1:40:51] Oh hallelujah no men can pluck him out
[1:40:54] of his hands their lives they'll have to
[1:40:58] get down and determine what the word
[1:40:59] tampered with means his some people some
[1:41:04] people you know a time years ago I gave
[1:41:07] a brother
[1:41:08] I had hoped he would be a brother I gave
[1:41:12] him a house to live in I put the whole
[1:41:14] bill in the furnace I paid the electric
[1:41:16] bill I did all this stuff just trying to
[1:41:19] help them to come and get into church
[1:41:22] and serve God
[1:41:28] one day I come to a situation I said I'm
[1:41:33] sorry but life has changed I need the
[1:41:39] house back and to this day they blame me
[1:41:45] for not serving God Wow i tampered with
[1:41:53] him did I know my brother and sister I
[1:41:56] know this is gonna sound rude and it's
[1:41:58] gonna be on the video and I don't much
[1:41:59] care right at the moment what I should
[1:42:01] have done is take the Word of God way
[1:42:03] early on in our relationship and I
[1:42:06] should have just booted him with it and
[1:42:08] said look God said we're in a hot house
[1:42:13] plants we're rugged God said through a
[1:42:18] prophet that the real believer won't be
[1:42:21] offended by the Word of God and I have
[1:42:23] hot house you I have tried to protect
[1:42:26] you I've paid bills for you I've done
[1:42:28] all of these things for you I've patted
[1:42:30] you on the back I've done this but you
[1:42:32] see if it's not in there no amount of
[1:42:36] pampering Church I probably should say
[1:42:39] this on a Sunday morning but after our
[1:42:41] last experience of this last year we're
[1:42:45] no longer pampering anybody now people
[1:42:50] think this is rude and it'll probably
[1:42:51] come in as backlash and I just don't
[1:42:53] much care next time somebody sits in our
[1:42:56] church and pulls their car keys out and
[1:42:58] rattles them at about thirty minutes I'm
[1:43:00] gonna ask them if they're trying to put
[1:43:02] them in the offering plate because
[1:43:03] they're gonna give the car to the church
[1:43:05] or if they need help to their car
[1:43:08] because they want to leave but you see
[1:43:11] we're done pampering we're done
[1:43:14] pampering people want special attention
[1:43:18] people need something special I can't go
[1:43:20] to your church unless I'm special well
[1:43:22] my brother and sister it isn't my church
[1:43:24] it's God's church we're not here we're
[1:43:29] not here to be pampered because the
[1:43:32] prophet of God dealt with that talked
[1:43:34] about them hothouse plants
[1:43:37] oh wow I better change the subject here
[1:43:41] before we all go home with a frown on
[1:43:42] her face but you see my brother and
[1:43:45] sister it comes down to a time in a
[1:43:46] place that we cannot sacrifice ourselves
[1:43:48] emotionally mentally in whatever trying
[1:43:51] to hold up somebody that wants to find
[1:43:53] fault with everything in the church if
[1:43:56] all you can see is Fault in the church
[1:43:59] you're in the wrong church go find a
[1:44:02] church that you don't find fault in and
[1:44:04] then just hope or least go back to the
[1:44:07] Bible make sure they're preaching the
[1:44:09] truth to you but as I said I just heard
[1:44:14] brother Jason speaking tonight God sends
[1:44:19] the preacher to preach what God wants
[1:44:21] you to hear not what you want to hear
[1:44:23] amen if I let it be out of the mouth of
[1:44:26] two or three preachers yeah
[1:44:29] no man can pluck them out of his hands
[1:44:31] their lives cannot be tempered with the
[1:44:34] visible life is burning shining giving
[1:44:37] light and manifestation of the Holy
[1:44:38] Ghost the inner invisible life is hidden
[1:44:41] in God and fed by the Lord's word Satan
[1:44:44] cannot touch them not even death can
[1:44:48] touch them for dayit death has lost its
[1:44:51] sting the grave has lost its victory
[1:44:53] thanks be unto God they have this
[1:44:56] victory in and through the Lord Jesus
[1:44:58] Christ amen and amen
[1:45:01] o Lord let the Holy Ghost come down let
[1:45:05] us bind this flesh when this flesh says
[1:45:10] I'm too tired to worship when this flesh
[1:45:13] says I'm too tired to do this I'm too
[1:45:16] tired to do that find that flesh in the
[1:45:19] name of Jesus Christ
[1:45:20] don't let the flesh man control the
[1:45:23] spirit man hey man sister Emmy would you
[1:45:25] come hallelujah amen I smell smoke it
[1:45:29] might burn a bridge burning but my
[1:45:32] brother and sister there ain't no

[1:45:45] praise the Lord aren't you glad Amen
[1:45:48] Satan can't touch him
[1:45:49] amen but the part the line I want to
[1:45:52] reiterate there the visible life is
[1:45:54] burning and shining giving light and
[1:45:57] manifestations of the Holy Ghost the
[1:46:00] what was the word visible hallelujah

[1:48:55] something I don't mean no ill no nothing
[1:48:57] to nobody but my brothers and sisters
[1:48:59] I'll just admit to you right now that
[1:49:01] the last year I have been so bound as a
[1:49:04] minister it might have showed maybe it
[1:49:08] didn't I don't know but I have been so
[1:49:09] bound because there has been so much
[1:49:11] brother Branham didn't mean that that
[1:49:14] isn't what that says that isn't what he
[1:49:16] really meant this is this this is that
[1:49:17] look I'll tell you I got tired I got so
[1:49:19] close to my brother and sister I'll just
[1:49:21] be honest with you tonight maybe too
[1:49:22] honest I came just about the thickness
[1:49:25] of that page right there - resigning as
[1:49:30] I reach the points I I can live without
[1:49:32] this I can live without that spirit
[1:49:35] causing you to guard everything that you
[1:49:37] know is the truth but you're trying to
[1:49:38] find a way that won't cause it conflict
[1:49:42] well tell you praise the Lord I thank
[1:49:45] you for your prayers amen
[1:49:48] but keep praying for me because I'm only
[1:49:50] about that far from resigning
[1:49:52] but that's progress
[1:49:59] I stand corrected sister Kara but I tell
[1:50:07] you Saints I tell you God never intended
[1:50:11] for us to come to the house of God to be
[1:50:14] bound up God never intended for us to
[1:50:19] throw a whole sermon out because the
[1:50:22] preacher stumbled over a few words
[1:50:23] because his mind was going a lot faster
[1:50:25] than his mouth or his mouth was going a
[1:50:27] lot faster than his mind you see if we
[1:50:32] can't come to maturity to come to a
[1:50:34] place to say okay I see what he was
[1:50:37] doing I see I see where this brother has
[1:50:39] been preaching Benton didn't devote in
[1:50:42] years almost two decades of his life to
[1:50:45] come to this place and any certain will
[1:50:48] suddenly just throw us all out and turn
[1:50:49] us into some weird thing oh my brother
[1:50:52] and sister you see prophet of God if we
[1:50:56] had a clue don't feel sorry for me I may
[1:50:59] have vented just now but don't feel
[1:51:00] sorry for me but I'd like to do is stop
[1:51:03] and think about the sacrifice the
[1:51:05] prophet of God made from church to
[1:51:09] church across the nations around the
[1:51:11] world constantly be hammered our church
[1:51:14] we were taught correctly our church
[1:51:17] doesn't believe that oh this isn't right
[1:51:20] you're a Holy Roller you're this you're
[1:51:23] that constant I was just reading a
[1:51:25] little article the other day the man
[1:51:28] writing and he was saying well you know
[1:51:30] brother Branham was doing great as long
[1:51:32] as he followed Gordon Lindsay's advice
[1:51:34] well my brother and sister God didn't
[1:51:37] send Gordon Lindsay to restore a message
[1:51:41] to this age amen
[1:51:44] you see the mind of denomination we've
[1:51:47] been faithfully taught you must stick
[1:51:50] with our faithful teaching well how
[1:51:52] about the liberty of the revealed word
[1:51:55] amen the third poll coming and giving us
[1:51:59] an open book hallelujah the book isn't
[1:52:02] closed and we're hoping we can figure it
[1:52:05] out the book is open and the Bride of
[1:52:08] Christ is eating that book as it were
[1:52:11] one page at a time
[1:52:12] day by day every single day she's eating
[1:52:16] the book hallelujah
[1:52:18] and sometimes the book gives us
[1:52:21] indigestion
[1:52:24] it better but I tell you what it does
[1:52:27] you go to bed I just experienced this
[1:52:31] the other day I don't know what a but I
[1:52:32] ate something my stomach this rawrrr off
[1:52:34] half the night but middle of the night
[1:52:37] sister Jerry slid a hand over I was I
[1:52:40] was awake there I probably was making so
[1:52:41] much noise she couldn't sleep and I knew
[1:52:43] she's praying for me somewhere along
[1:52:45] here I kind of spoke of this the other
[1:52:46] day I drifted off to sleep and even
[1:52:50] though whatever a yesterday upset my
[1:52:52] tummy I woke up in the morning I was
[1:52:54] hungry
[1:52:56] that's the life of a believer right
[1:52:58] there Lord forgive me Lord help me Lord
[1:53:02] I'm guilty but Lord I plead your blood
[1:53:04] Oh Lord and you wake up in the morning

[1:53:15] look I'm not speaking ill of anybody I
[1:53:18] just want to go to church
[1:53:20] not even just be the preacher all the
[1:53:22] time God blessed us with a couple fine
[1:53:24] ministers in our church and I'm probably
[1:53:26] going to start relying on a more I'm
[1:53:28] going to become a lazy pastor but my
[1:53:32] brother and sister God meant for us to
[1:53:34] come in the house of God not to find a
[1:53:37] yoke to be bound into but we've been set
[1:53:42] free we've been set free and I'll tell
[1:53:46] you what as long as I'm pastor a
[1:53:48] sovereign a crow will fight for that
[1:53:50] Liberty we'll fight for our our position
[1:53:54] in Jesus price to take the revealed word
[1:53:57] of the hour apply it to us in every way
[1:54:00] hallelujah well it's that Holy Ghost and
