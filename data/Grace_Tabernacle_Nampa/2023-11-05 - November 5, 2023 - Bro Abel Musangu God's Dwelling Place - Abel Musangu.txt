can now do is open our Bibles and go the reading of the word pray praise the Lord if we can uh open our Bible in the book of uh Acts chapter 7 verse 47 and 49 okay let us uh go to the Lord in prayer before we read father we once again thank you for your presence amongst us this morning yes thank you for the songs of Zion that has been sung thank you for every single one every single brother and sister every child every single one who's here father God you the only one who can put that desire in our heart to come to the house of of God Amen so we ask you now to bless the reading of your word take every single thing that is not your word out of our mind let us focus on you bless and guide us as we commit our self in thy hand yes in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord uh verse 47 but Solomon build him and house Al by it the most high dwelt not in temples made with hand yes as said the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot St what house will ye build me said the Lord or what is the place of my restall praise the Lord hallelujah read also in the Book of Matthew 5: 47 and 48 um the Bible says here and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in in heaven is perfect amen amen God bless the reading of his word as you may have your seat this morning praise the Lord I'm not used to the this kind of microphone but it's fine all right so this morning by the grace of God we speaking about God's dwelling place we speaking about God dwelling place we know that uh our God is the great one he is the creator of every single things things visible and invisible he's the one who created us who the one who called us uh by his name so I'll read one quote here uh the prophet says I don't have that here says in the word of Separation it says all right water of Separation can uh we are here to hear the word it says here I pass through the city and see these big homes I appreciate that but there is none of you but live in a three room house that is all you can live in that's right you just live in a three room house when God was here he live in a three room house that is all you could live in the first is your kitchen that's it the next is your dining room or a living room and the next is your bedroom you may have three four bedroom or couple of dining rooms or something but really that is just extra rooms you come first to the kitchen where you eat after you come and eat like the church you sit you sit on bench to hear the word faith come by hearing and hearing from the word of God so faith cannot come by the news by listening to the news you can listen to the news you can listen to the podcast you can listen to anything but you don't receive Faith by doing so so because all these things can create fear all these things can create a lot of anxieties but when you come to listen to the word of God fath Faith come by hearings you know hearing the word of God because the word of God is powerful the word of God does have a power to transform the word of God does have a power to control the word of God controls situations you control event there's not event that can happen that God doesn't know God is not surprised by what is going on God is not surprised by your situations God is not surprised by any disease or any plagues that can comes on because every single things is controlled by the word of God and then when we come to hear the word of God the word of God is a seed as the Bible says the word of God is a seed and then when we listen to the word the word does have a power to do as the word says He will do because the word of God is not a word of a man it's the word of God Amen praise the Lord so he says that Faith come by hearing and hearing from the word of God then after you have eat the word then you come in the living room amen when you come the living room which is into fellowship with the rest of the church right exactly so you have eat the word and then now you come in the living rooms because men you there some people can have 16 bedroom or 16 bedroom and 20 bathroom so but you cannot live on all those rooms you live only in three rooms you live in the kitchen in the living room and then the bedrooms and the prophet said the living room is where you come and fellowship when you fellowship with the Breen when you fellowship with the Believers and then then after that you go in the secret place amen I like that we go now in the secret place it's where in the bedroom is the secret place it says it where you go and kneel down amen that when you have fellowship with God that when you bring up your prayers that when you fellowship with him and then when God and you as in a secret place so you we see that God is living uh in you as a human being you living in three bedroomroom house and then we see as we read here the Bible says be therefore perfect as your heavenly father is perfect so that word perfect means having all the require I have to read this because I put this down he say have all the require or desirable element qualities yes or characteristics as good as it possibly to be that is being perfect that is being perfect it's we F fault it's Flawless amen so being perfect mean you are without fault amen hallelujah you are flawless amen so you have all the desirable characteristics that is required to be Hallelujah so you are flawless so as a human as a man what you can your your best effort that you can do every single thing that you can do as a human it's failure that's right that's right every single thing you can try to do it's a it's but a failure that's right you cannot be perfect by yourself that's right you can you can try you can try to come to church you can try to be to be religious but you cannot be perfect as heavenly father is perfect by yourself that's right but there God you need to have something special that is coming from God or God himself come dwell inside of you in order for him to live his own life because without God living his own life you can try but you cannot be perfect you cannot be like God you cannot be like God by yourself you you you can try to come to church you can try to sing you can try all these things but without God himself coming dwelling inside of you you are just as a failure as a failure can be amen amen praise the Lord so because the Bible say for all all have seen and come short of the glory of God Amen there's no one every single one every single one was come short the glory of God is that why in Revelation chapter 5 when they say who is worthy no one was worthy the Bible says there were no one worthy even to look upon the book there were no one worthy to call the prophet there were no Prophet that was worthy there were no there were no there were no preacher who was worthy there were no one was about the Lamb of God himself the Lord Jesus Christ was the one who was worthy to take the book and to break break the seals thereof they that the only one who was perfect because when he was on the earth he said who can accuse me of sin no one can accuse him of sin it was he was so perfect it was so perfect in this message called Perfections uh where's my time here okay just need to go very slowly slowly here okay in message called perfection the prophet says here now God in the beginning require Perfection Jesus when he come on the earth says be therefore perfect like God in heaven is perfect and the law having a shadow of things to come could never make the worshipper perfect you get the picture now let's go it let's go it into it again uh so you be sure to you cannot miss it say god require perfect Holiness no one can stand in His image with one little speck of sin Jesus witnessed the same and said be therefore perf is perfect now say and the Bible say the LA could never with it sacrifice make the calmer perfect then the LA could not perfect anything it was only a pointer this sacrifice made every year could never make the worshipper perfect so therefore no one under the law or keeping of law or under the shadow could be perfect hallelujah amen amen no one could be perfect under the law amen because God G say if you do this I will do this if you do this I will do this and no one can ever keep the law of God that's right no one could do as Lord want to do every single one every single time was just failing every single time time was just failing you see because no one could could have keep what God says because this great God give the law he said th shall not do this th shall not do this that shall every single one tries but no one could ever keep the laws of God but God require Perfections because the time of manifestations and to be manifested you need to be perfect because the time of adoptions is the time of blessing of sons it's the time when you need to be like your heavenly fathers you need the time that you see every single thing is maturing sin is maturing the worldly is maturing every single thing is maturing every single things is getting is getting to the manifestations the word of God also is getting to the manifestations the Believers also are coming much more closer and closer to God by the word of God not by yourself by yourself you cannot do it but by the word of God by the the spoken word of God that the only way you can come to maturity that the only way you can count Perfections amen praise the Lord amen I feel good now I was nervous now I feel good praise the Lord so now we see that God requires that because the Bible says being born again not of corruptable seed but for incorruptable seed by the word of God which lived and abide because the word of God is quicker it's sharper and then it's it's very quick is is doing a quick work so the word of God is very quick so when you receive the problem is just receive the word and believe the word don't reason with the word of God don't say how this will happen I don't know how this is impossible Mary didn't say this is impossible Mary say let it be done to me according to your word because the word of God does have a power it's so quick it's so effective actually the word of God is very effective amen when he comes he will do as the word says we just need to lay there we just need to lay we just need to believe he said Lord I believe Lord I trust in you amen praise the Lord amen you see now God says the most high God God doesn't dwell in hand in House made with hands that's right this the great God the creator of Genesis we created every single things amen and then the Bible says folks have alls and the bird of Heaven have next but the son of man does not have a place where he may lay his head amen this is the great God who created every single things things visible and invisible the Bible say every single thing was made by him and for him and for his glory but this great God this great hellim didn't have even a place to lay his head and then Solomon come says and as we read there say which out will you build me because the most high doesn't dwell in in buildings made with man's hand amen and then he he called Moses up he said Moses now I'll show you something in Exodus chapter 25 verse 8 the Bible says here Exodus 25:8 it says and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all I showed thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instrument thereof and even so shall he make it so as we know that Moses didn't make the Tabernacle but Solomon comes and make the Tabernacle and when Solomon built that Tabernacle in first king 8:12 the Bible says here he says and it came to pass when the priest were come out of the Holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister because the cloud for the glory of the Lord has filled the house of the Lord right amen then listen then speak Solomon amen the Lord says that you will he will dwell in the thick Darkness amen this is the great God now the Bible says that in God there's no Darkness at all amen there's no Darkness at all in God but here the Solomon says the Lord has agree actually say I'll dwell in thick Darkness I'll come in your condition I'll come in your conditions when you cannot do it I'll come in that Darkness I'll come so down in your lowly conditions I come to the chiefest of The Sinner I will come in there I'll dwell with you I'll come to do my work in you it doesn't matter where you were it doesn't matter what condition you are in it doesn't matter what if you hav't gone farther away from God God says I will come I have choose to come to dwell in thick darkness in the in the thickest of all Darkness not only in darkness but in the thick Darkness amen amen amen praise the Lord in the Book of John 1 John chapter 1 verse 5 the Bible says and then this message which we have heard and declare unto you that God is light and in him there's no Darkness at all but this same God this same God has accepted to come in your conditions is accepted to come as is that say just as you are come just as you don't question just as you are come to God Amen and then he will take it from there he does have the power to transforms he doesn't have the power to change he doesn't have the power to give you courage to move forward amen praise the Lord isn't that good amen our God is tremendous you want he loves us so much he love us so much then he'll do every single thing it it takes to come and make us make sure that we make it make sure that we are perfect as he is perfect amen praise the Lord the book of uh Hebrews chapter 8 verse 6 the Bible says here but now this is Paul now picking it up he said but now that he obtained a more excellent Ministry but how much also is the mediator of better Covenant which was established upon the better promises amen you say for it that first Covenant has been thoughtless then should not Place have been sought for the second one because the first one no one could ever keep it that's it every single one was failure no one could ever keep the Covenant of God and then he says it says on verse eight it says for funding for with them he said behold the day come say the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to to the Covenant that I made with their father in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them that's it it says because they continue not in my Covenant I regard them not said the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days said the Lord I will put my laws in their minds Hallelujah and write them in their hearts and I will be them a God and they shall be me a people amen now God is putting his Covenant he putting his laws in our mind he putting his laws in our heart in order for us to be perfect as he is perfect in order for us to to stay with the word of God Amen because when God write those laws in our heart they enter in our wills and our choices yes in our affections yes now it's not as Paul say it's not me living but it's Christ Living in me that's because the laws now become our WIS that's it now it becomes now because they in our heart they start directing us where we can do what we can do is this according to God's word is this according to God's promises is this what god require for me to do because now God has put them in our hearts amen praise the Lord now when those laws are in our heart duty is transfer amen ah to delight and into spontaneous love service right it's not not again a duty to come to church right it's not a duty to serve the Lord right it's not a duty to sing and to say glory to God because now you are doing according to God it's not you it's God now it's God responding to his own words it's all God believing his own words it's God himself in you it's God inside working through the outside it's not you but it's God Amen praise the Lord amen Ezekiel 36 verse 25 you know all these things the Bible says here then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and it shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you amen a new heart also I'll give you and a new spirit will p within you I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh and I'll put my spirit Hallelujah I'll put my spirit within you and now listen and cause you that's it Hallelujah cause you now it's not even you now it's God causing you to work in my statutes it's God who's doing it now and yes he SH now and you shall keep my judgment and do them amen amen now it's God doing it for you now it's him causing you to do that is him causing you to leave his own word amen praise the Lord Amen brother Bram says here in this message here why some people don't uh keep the victory amen I think that is the one he says here it says yes that's what need today it experience of the new birth amen now I want you to watch the order that Ezekiel brought it in he said I'll give you a new heart so I'll give you a new heart and I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit in you I want you to watch there is three of it a new heart I'll take the old Stony heart away that is what that all different heart you have I'll give you a new spirit now many times and there's been a terrible mistake the people has thought sometime that the new spirit was the Holy Spirit right but it's not the Holy Spirit that's right God give you a new spirit what should couldn't even because with your whole Spirit he says you cannot get along with yourself with your old Spirit you cannot get along with yourself how can you get along with the things of God it's impossible is that why God first come he give you a new spirit that new spirit is not the Holy Ghost but the spirit that you can get along with the things of God Amen I like the prophet you see it is re it is a revealer of the word of God and then he says he gives you a new spirit and then he says H with you all and then how could you go along with the Holy Ghost say God has to give you a new spirit so you could get along with his spirit amen and and then he goes I just go back says see new heart new spirit and my spirit amen three things he spoke of that's right amen gives you a new heart a new spirit now and his Spirit that's right amen because now when you have the spirit of God now you can understand the things of God that's right because without the spirit of God they can speak the things of God they will be just like this it doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense you see but you need and then when you have the new spirit your vision will change now you start seeing things as God sees them because now you become in the same channel with the word of God now that Spirit become become a a a Same Spirit like spirit of God you you become along with the spirit of God Amen praise the Lord you see that is what it takes amen for us to be perfect like God that's it amen now here God is building his own house amen God is building his own because the only one is not dwelling in the building made by men like this that's it that's right he cannot live in here that's right and then he says I'll build myself a building I'll build myself a church amen let's read in John 14 verse1 of John chter 14:1 and then he says let your heart be no trouble because uh if you at this trouble you have so many issues with the heart with the heart heart there's so many issues yeah if your heart is not working correctly you have a lot of problem in the body that's right so that why say let your heart not be troubl let not your problem trouble you amen focus on God that's look at Jesus Christ the author and the finisher of the the work because otherwise you you you'll have a lot of heart diseases and heart problems because the prophet says uh stress or if you have anxiety or all these things they're bringing a lot of sickness that's right amen they're bringing a lot of diseases they are but that what Jesus himself Our God come he say let not your heart be troubled if you see a event you see what wherever goes God is not surprised by by the event that is going on that's right God is not surprised by any situations God is in he he got all in control amen every single thing is in control he know exactly what he's doing he is God Amen he said let not your heart be troubles ye believe in me believe in God and believe also in me now listen in my father's house are many mentions if they were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there he may be also he said in my father's house there are many mentions yes amen amen amen now listen here in the fellowship by redemptions Prophet says here says here it says I never believe that heaven was a place where where there's a bunch of buildings right amen where there's a bunch of house up there made up with more da with paper hole painted on the oil I never believe that a supernatural being will have to live in a literal house amen I believe when Jesus spoke in John's 14 in my father's house is many mention he meant a body amen he meant a dwelling place that is my subject a Dwelling Place when he said in my father's house there's many mentions Jesus met in my is me a body a dwelling but that's why Jesus came he says destroy this Temple and I'll rebuild it again when he was saying that people say this this Temple here was built long time ago I can you destroy it and rebuild it in three days you was speaking about his body amen and it says it says it mean a body a dwelling place for the scripture verify the same thing and say if this Earthly Tabernacle is destroyed or is dissolved we have one already waiting for us say you see mortal being is the only one who live in Mortal habitations so mortal being that the one who living in Mortal habitation he says Immortal beings live in Immortal habitations then the place that we go into in until we return back is not a place of bricks and Mortals and clay and precious stone and jewels it's a place a condition amen that we move out of this Dimension that we live in into another dimension and it it is a house a tabernacle amen a Dwelling Place am praise the Lord it is a house it is a tabernacle it is a dwelling place that where God want to dwell God want to dwell within your soul God want to dwell among his people God want to dwell in you so he can live his own words that when when you receive the word amen you become the word amen and then that inside man is growing when you heit the word of God the inside man that is the purpose that because without that Inside Man growing you are not it it's very difficult for you to get that new body amen because that inside man that's it that when he receiving the word you become the word amen he said that is a dwelling place that when Paul come he says know he not that you are the temple that's right of the Holy Ghost that's right amen amen the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3 say know he not that you are a temple of God and that the spirit of God dwells inside of you amen that the only way you can be attend Perfections that's exactly right that the only way you can attend maturity right that the only way you can attend adoption stage that's it amen by God coming dwelling inside of us that's right amen amen amen praise the Lord right see uh in uh this message called the Eden life now it says I like this one let re this along here it says now remember only Believers only the elected comes into that that God has chosen you I believe that in Revelation say he that overcome so it is a promise to Overcomers MH amen you say I overcome smoking that is uh that is uh isn't what I'm talking about there's a a lot more go to Christianity beside not smoking cigarettes or drinking Wiis amen there's more to that that's right so we we don't smoke we don't drink we don't do all those things but there's more to that it cannot just be stop smoking stop drinking stop smoking stop no no no it's not it's not we need to move forward amen we need to move to Perfection we need to move to to another levels we need to move into deep Waters amen and then he says he says uh it's not what I'm talking about he says here he that overcomes shall inherit all things he will be my son I'll be his God Amen I'll give him a hidden manner yes I will now listen I will ask hide him away hallelujah hallelujah I like that amen I will hide him away and I will give him the Eden thinks the word on the outside of the curtain don't know about nothing about it so when you come into that Perfections with God now remember you live in three rooms house when you come in that holies of holies when you come in that secret place when you shut in with God now God giv you a hidden manner he hi you away amen he he hi you away so the people from outside cannot comprehend you because you're a new creature in God because you are fellowshipping now now know in the holies of holy there were three things yes sir there were the Ten Commandments or the law the the word of God yeah there were Aaron Rod yeah and there were Eden Mana that's right it doesn't matter how far you've gone with God after you've gone away from God yeah but when you receive the word that's right when you comeing to God when you start shutting in with God that's right like Aaron Road when you become in the presence of God that's right when you come in the presence of God that road produce fruit amen it was so dry amen it was so dry but they just put it in the holies of holies amen and then it produce fruit amen amen amen and then he said I'll give you a hidden now remember the Mana was falling every single day that was not hidden Mana that was visible Mana everybody could see that from the outside everybody the man is here maybe from the outer Court the man could you even fall people could the man I can but God says no to him that overcome I'll will give him to it a hidden Mana I'll bring him in the holies of holies now that way you have Fellowship yourself with God now where God is revealing himself to you that where God is giving you all the revelations he said this is how you need to be perfect this is how you have to live this is it's not no it's not an effort now you're making now it's God himself causing you to live his word it's God himself making things happen you become Jesus Christ on the earth you can speak and things can happen you can say something and God will come on the scene and then it can bring a sick here and then you can lay the hand on him and he shall recover why because because you are now in the holies of holies now God is moving Us in the stage where Jesus says be therefore perfect as your heavenly father is perfect cuz they could not comprehend Jesus he was just there say you you are healed he didn't even praise that much no he was just there your faith heal you master you teach us how you do these things pick up your bed and walk it didn't pick up your bed and walk yeah pick up your no just good pick up your bed and walk amen do you believe I believe you not you can see now Hallelujah then open I can see I can see Jesus Jesus didn't didn't spend so so much time but he was in communion with God that's it he was now in the holies of holies that's it he was now in the secret place with God he was now consecrated completely to God he was now receiving the hidden manner he was in the secret place with God now he was such a consecrated person as he as now Peter experienced the same thing now when he was also so consecrated to God he could pass like this and then he shadow somebody passing in Shadow and then is heal yeah cuz the same power amen the same power because says every single thing that was in Christ he put it in the church everything that was in God he put it in Christ and everything that was in Christ he put it in the Believers the Believers who must receive the word who must lay you just say Lord let it be done to me amen according to your word Lord I believe Lord I receive I want I want you to transform me I want you to cause me to work according to your word amen praise the Lord right see I will hide him a away that's it God will hide you a away that's exactly right amen amen and I'll give him the hidden things the word on the outside yes of the curtain don't know nothing about it Prophet say hallelujah amen though they is manner but they don't know about this I'll give to him the hidden manner I'll give him a stone with his name on it I'll get what I you get what I mean now listen listen entering into the adoption or the Eden Place With God that's it amen amen that's it amen that's right right entering into adoption yes sir that's it all the hidden place with God that's it not hiden place with men that is why religion is a failure that's it the religion is a failure because people don't guide themselves

minutes okay go home relax God loves you amen next next Sunday we'll meet again okay amen next Sunday you come it's the same thing again praise the Lord amen okay don't forget your offering religion is a failure yeah that is why that is why religion is that why I was reading statistics that many people many young people don't go to church many people are run are running away from church because we don't see we don't see the power of God we don't see God acting we don't see but let me let let me tell you something the word of God is mighty even this morning in this building God is still acting God is still alive and well but what we need to do we just need to hide ourselves with him amen we need to consecrate ourselves to God Amen the adoptions amen you get what I mean entering into the adoption or theen place with God that way maturity happening amen that way God is dealing with us amen we're changing a corner my brothers yes we changing a corner that's it that's it something major is happening that's it among the Believers amen praise God is is I will hide you I will hide him away amen God is doing it God is doing it Revelation 21:3 the Bible says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there were no more seas and I John I saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepare as a bride for a husband I heard a great voice now listen listen I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God if with men and I will dwell I will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away yes all tears from their eyes amen what a time that will be God will H wipe away all tears and there shall be

for this word are true and faithful Hallelujah the Tabernacle of God if with men and I will come and dwell with them now you see now we can find an answer to the scripture that we read he said what house will you build me now God will come and dwell in his people God will come and dwell in individuals in the brothers and sisters and God now can find a place of rest hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can find out a place of rest go the prophet say God doesn't have other hand than your hand he doesn't have other feet than your feet now God is dwelling inside of us now you can see a brother or a sister is housing God am that's why the Bible says you need to discern the Lord's body that's right you need to discern the Lord body Discerning the brother and sister around you you never know what's going on with her or him she she or how's God he can be God it's say some will receive their reward just by being good to the Believers that's right because the the housing God God because we arriving a time of look at how sin is maturing look how all these things are maturing but you see the prophet said when you see the natural is a type of the spiritual or the spiritual is a type of the natural and then you see what's happening in the natural God it's already happened in the spir Supernatural because that way God is also bringing his people to the Capstone amen that's it he's bringing his people the Capstone to the maturity of the bride and then you arrive there he said all from justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Spirit the adoption itself that's right that's it and you become like God what house will you build me the most high God he say I I go to prepare you in play not speaking about building but a body a Dwelling Place amen praise the Lord

better clothes drive better automobiles we are progressing yeah so we are progressing sir but God cannot progress in that way yes sir that's it God cannot progress in that way because he was perfect to begin with amen God was perfect to begin with so you as a human you progress I have got $100 man I'm good look at her look no no no no it's nothing that's right so you're progressing so you have a better C you have a Tesla that's nice HH yeah it's nice but God cannot progress that way it says because you as perfect to begin with amen he see it don't have to say uh uh let me jump he say with different Age We have got a better thought now people have got better thoughts now because now they they disbelieve in God they can say no the Bible was written long time ago now let's make it much more relevant to this time Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen everything can change but the word never changes it's still the same God it never changes says he says and then he get better thought he says because he was God was perfect to begin with he said you know what I mean he can enter things he says they will they will do all these things but they will never they will never outp pass God yes because he was perfect to begin with amen that is our God Amen such a perfect God he's is it's a god of Perfections amen amen and then here it says here our little church here sitting here Lord men and women who believe they love who believe loves you I pray God that the spirit that fill many in the of of their heart yeah this go gone by will now come deeper in more may they lay aside everything every Strife everything that is unlike you and move up today not to men to a mure but to Calvary not to altogether to Calvary but to Christ the hope of glory the deity of God the magnificence of God the power of God that is now in our hearts amen hallelujah praise the Lord the the the the hope of glory the deity of God in our heart because our heart is the dwelling place of the most high God because the most high God doesn't dwell in Building made by men now the deity of Jesus Christ because Prophet says if you believe God you are an omnipotent omnipotent so you speak as God speak how can you speak because the deity of God dwells in the heart of the Believers Hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord the Lord oh wonderful say the deity of Jesus Christ H he says the deity of God the deity of God the magnificence of God the power of God that is now in our heart try trying to draw out the things of the world that's it only that power can draw out you can read this for yourself the de of Jesus Christ yes sir 1949 yeah you can read that for yourself it says now that power of God is draw out the things of the world and he might take us out of the earth someday unto a better land god granted for us the power of God the deity of Jesus Christ God himself dwelling inside of us hallelujah hallelujah The Dwelling Place of God that way God want to dwell Hallelujah he come Solomon when he prayed he said God has accepted he said I'll come and dwell in the thickest of Darkness like this prostitute comes to Jesus Christ at the Simon's house she was so filthy yeah she was to the eyes of people yeah no one could talk to her everybody even when she go by the perfume say what are you doing here I said everybody was was shining her out yeah but when she come in the presence of Jesus Christ when she arrive that's it that's it everybody stood up the for master you don't know what woman men this is and then and then Simon and say oh it's not the Messiah because if it was a messiah maybe you should know that this woman is a prostitute now you see this man is a fake it's not a messiah he not a prophet he should have known he should have known I come he doesn't know that the two men is a men of and Jesus comes say Simon Simon I come to your house you never anointed me with oil that's it you never greet me it I was just at the corner with dirty feet but this woman she comes say daughter stand up your sin as many as they can be the all has been forgiven go that our God does thing go no more amen because God want to come to dwell amongst us amen amen among his Believers praise the Lord see that's that's exactly the hope of that is the hope of glory amen that is exactly what we are here for that's right that exactly what we are working for it working for one person to have a relationship with Jesus Christ the prophet say I don't bring people to the Tabernacles my message not bring people to the Bram Tabernacles or to myself by my me my my message it to bring an individual relationship between one man and the Lord Jesus Christ when you have that relationship between you and God you become a Powerhouse you become a Dwelling Place of the most high God now God himself dwells in you you become a Powerhouse you become so powerful that now you can speak that when the prophet arrived and the third pool Ministry he could not no more he could just speak the word amen just speak the word let it be there be there and there and then God confirmed that happened that's exactly right because now you becoming at the maturity level that's it now because all this that where the word of God is bringing us every single time that's it the dwelling place of the most high God so when we arrive at that level brothers that's it that's right in that secret chamber that's it when we have fellowship with God that's right when you talk to him when there is is a situation where you don't know what to do go to pray to God fellowship with him amen spend time with God Amen spend time with him amen it's longing for that come spend time with me please come come come just as you are come amen don't say Lord look at me I'm so I'm so bad I look at me I I don't have any hope no no no no no there's still hope there still hope even if if if you have even a desire to come to church it's God who place that desire in you that's right Amen to come inside the church that's it because the devil want doesn't want you to come to church because the devil doesn't want you to come listen to the word of God that's right because the word of God as we read is powerful is quicker it divided it's so it's so quick it's more than high speeed internet the word of God is coming so fast it come inside the seed come inside your soul and then you don't know what happen when the word is going forth because that is a system that God has chosen it comes inside of your soul when you receive that word when you receive it inside of your soul like Mary receive it it didn't question God he didn't question the Angels you see Zachariah asked questions he say how this will happen I'm already old I cannot produce anything and then say you'll be muted that's right you won't speak no more that's it this is the priest that's it this is the priest right he could not believe it maybe he was he was he was God you don't question God no that's right don't question God but the same Angel when he went to Mary that's right he said I been sent from the presence of God you shall have a child let it be done to me am according to your word she didn't know what would happen she just said let it be done to me this is news to me I I until the first time I'll have a baby I don't have a husband but I believe Lord Lord I believe Lord I trust I don't know how that will happen but I put it in your hand as she believe as she believe as she Str say yes I meet the angel the angel come and then he it spoke to me oh praise the Lord he said I'll have a child oh I I don't know how that will happen Joseph let me tell you but this was real the angel me me Hallelujah Joseph Joseph believer praise the Lord so may we just wait on the Lord and then suddenly the word come to manifestation that's it something happened in Mary's home then she ran as we know to Elizabeth's house he said say Elizabeth my my my sister God bless you you see the angel appeared to me and he say I'll have a child his name will be Jesus Christ amen the prophet said the minute that he pronounce that name amen the name of Jesus something happened that's it in the home of Elizabeth Hallelujah why because Hallelujah now Mary have life amen shearing life amen amen amen amen that is right but she arve at the level another that is another level that's it arve on another level that's it believing God that is on word just trusting him trust and Obey I trust and Obey I don't know you don't look you don't say Lord I don't know what this how this will happen how my kid my wife my husband whatever it is what whatever situation is amen if God says we who are alive and remain that's right shall be changed in a twinkling of an eye Amen in a twinkling of an eye what is your problem yeah amen if a body can be changed in a twinkling of an eye the entire body is changed amen what is your problem that maybe fr fraction fraction of a twinkling of an eye the body will be your situation is like nothing before God if this body can be changing twinkling of eyes yes the mountain is just nothing to before God hallelujah just need to trust him just need to believe in God just just just trust just stay there like the road of Aaron in the holies of holies it'll produce fruit it will produce fruit this bed this road was dry it produced fruit see that what God does our God is waking mightly among the Believers now because this is the season this is the time this is what God is doing this is what God is bringing us to is bringing the church to the church the prophet says now now the church is changing Corners amen that's right we have t a corner amen we are not just going like this every sing no we are turning the corner and now when we tunning the corner now it become almost the pyramid is going like it was like this that's going like this that's right it's going very very slim at the top amen amen amen only when you God hide you away that's right in that place now you have that fellowship with him you become a Mystic to the people people don't comprehend you exactly say what is this what is man doing what is he believing what what's going on with him what's going on with him you have meet God sir no man meet God and remain the same no man meet God and remain the same if you meet God something will happen that's it the change will take place that's it that's it there is a change sometimes it's just like I come to church every single time I come the pastor preach preach pre but I don't see anything did you lay it in front of Jesus Amen did you surrender all to God that's right did you give it all or did you keep some for yourself that's it did you surrender it all or keep some to yourself God want a full surrender that's right God for the prophet say a total obedience to the word of God andle you to the toen the total obedience to the word of God Amen untitle you to the toen amen now you become a Powerhouse it you become the dwelling place that's right of the most high God I'll read one more thing as we handing it to close here oh praise the Lord I like this I like it amen maturity of the Bride that's it right that's exactly right the dwelling place of God that's right amen that is what it takes that is the adoption time that's it that's the maturity amen that's what God is doing exactly right so for it's God which works in you both Amen to Will and to do that's it not you but God that's it not you God is doing that praise the Lord you just you relax believe in God Amen just to trust in himen read this in behold the great solom the Solomon is here I didn't put that in the slide the prophet says here they that was like uh like that let me jump so it says here says so now a pagan worshiper worship way to do they bring the idol and set it up and then they get a priest and they bless the candle and they put this candle before the idol and they bring him something to eat and eat communion with him and then they prostate themselves before that Idol and just give in their mind in such a way till they believe that they can hear the idols speak back to them now that is Pagan idol worship that's right now that is contrary to God that's it yeah God is not a adult God is is a spirit and we prostate ourselves before that and the spirit doesn't come into some Idol or soall Christian who have us to believe but the spirit come into you and you are God's house living walking around manifesting the Living God for God dwell not in temples made with hand but a Bo a body as th prepare for me amen amen that's it a body as di prepared for me God himself building a Tabernacles amen shall we stand this morning amen second Peter chapter 1 verse3 and 4 the Bible says here it says according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertinent unto life and good godliness though the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby a given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through last amen we have become the partaker of a divine nature of God that's it Believers are become partaker amen because God is dwelling inside of us that's right is his hiding place that's right is his Dwelling Place he want to dwell inside of us he want to live in us he want to do everything with us now if they want to see God in 2023 they can see it in the brothers and sisters right they can call upon you as a representative of God you are an ambassador for God God is willing is willing to dwell he says Solomon has built me a house but the most high God is Not dwelling in things made by hand he not dwelling in those but I'll build myself a temple that's right Lord prepare me to be a temple of God I want God to dwell inside of me that where Solutions come that where you have that where you have answer to your prayers When you pray to God when you trust in God when you are shut in with God Amen when you communicate with God from the kitchen to the living room when the kitchen the prophet says when we come to hear the word of God we got the living room with fellowship with Brothers now when you go in the bedroom we go in the holies of holy when you fellowship with God When you pray to God when the situation are so difficult when you don't know what to do amen go to your [Music] knees go in that secret place am this is the time amen that God answers prayers because in Revelation chapter 5 when he took the book The Bible says this I have to read the that the Bible says this Revelation chapter 5 it says and then when uh it says there were a veil that was with the pray prayers of sins yeah all the prayers of sins you can read that in revation 5 all the prayers of sins where within that fa because that now was the time that our prayer is answered that's right cuz all the Mysteries has been opened that's right you can call to God and God can answer it's not a priest you cannot just go to the priest say priest father I've seen today can you can you answer no no no no no no you have now access to God amen you have access to God by yourself am amen you can you can ACC you can call God any time he's always there 24/7 amen he's just waiting on you he said if you need me call me I'm a present help in time of need if there's if there's an impossibility I'm God of possibilities if there's a situation that you can do I'm specializing in things that are impossible if the sickness that they said is sickness we don't have a cure we have the Jehovah Rafa the Lord Our God will heal us from all diseases he God he here and then he can do it again because the same yesterday today and forever he say I want to dwell in the Believers that's it it's a time of adoptions time of maturity that's rightly God dwelling in his Believers that that's so simple but that's so true that's right that what God is doing that's right right now that's right God himself amen living among the people amen that's why we are that's it at this last day here the time of adoptions that's right the time of maturity my brothers and sisters things are going will happen so rapidly so rapidly that if you are not careful if you are not having that relationship with God that's the key this is the moment amen this is the time amen God is still his hand is so extended yes
