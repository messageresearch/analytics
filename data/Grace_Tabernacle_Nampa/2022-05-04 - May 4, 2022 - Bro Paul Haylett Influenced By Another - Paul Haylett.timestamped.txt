[44:16] forget the youth and kids this friday
[44:18] right yes amen
[44:20] okay so um
[44:22] i think i've covered those bases let's
[44:24] turn in our bibles this evening god
[44:26] bless you thank you
[44:27] brother jay
[44:29] amen you know one thing i want to say
[44:31] saints you know uh it's not for me to
[44:34] share but you know sometimes when the
[44:35] stress comes on brother jason that's
[44:37] some of the best song services we ever
[44:38] have
[44:39] i don't know that i'm going to say lord
[44:41] keep him stressed out
[44:43] but
[44:44] i just know they're some of the most
[44:46] beautiful song service amen we spoke to
[44:49] you last wednesday on our position of
[44:51] strength and i was very thankful uh for
[44:54] the presence of lord to come down it was
[44:56] not something we manufactured it wasn't
[44:59] something because it was such a profound
[45:01] sermon but it was god pleased with us as
[45:05] a people to settle right down in our
[45:07] midst and just speak to our hearts and
[45:10] and i'm i'm thankful for that and while
[45:12] this is under that same title uh as it
[45:15] is i want to speak to you uh influenced
[45:19] by another amen and a lot of influence
[45:22] in the world today and a lot of it can
[45:24] be negative right uh we we have concern
[45:27] for our young people uh as they are
[45:30] growing up and and getting anchored in
[45:32] the word of god
[45:34] uh that there's influences out there uh
[45:38] and
[45:39] you know
[45:40] there's an influence in the bride
[45:43] amen that is so strong
[45:46] it changes our life
[45:49] it changes our thinking
[45:51] it changes all of our circumstance
[45:54] and i'm so thankful
[45:56] that we have fallen under the influence
[45:58] of another amen imagine if we had church
[46:03] just
[46:04] under the influence of man
[46:08] wow
[46:09] it would be scary
[46:12] it would i'm serious because we would go
[46:14] into tangents and we would all feel good
[46:16] about a certain thing and that would be
[46:18] the direction we would go
[46:20] and uh you know
[46:23] i read a deal once it said church is not
[46:26] like a carnival
[46:28] we don't have to scream
[46:32] all the time
[46:36] but it doesn't hurt
[46:38] once in a while
[46:40] just a little something out
[46:42] a great big
[46:44] oh i'm priming you for something saints
[46:46] i'm priming you for something let's turn
[46:48] in our bibles to the book of revelation
[46:51] uh the 12th chapter and we will read
[46:54] from 7
[46:55] uh verse 7 to verse 12.
[46:57] and
[46:59] you know if you wondered sometimes
[47:00] saints um
[47:02] this this scripture
[47:05] oh i hope that my abstract thinking
[47:07] isn't too broad tonight but you ever
[47:10] wonder why there's such turmoil
[47:14] around your world
[47:16] and then you ever wonder why so to speak
[47:18] you wake up in the morning more
[47:20] determined to press on than ever before
[47:24] you realize that's all comes under
[47:26] influence
[47:28] that is not us
[47:30] i have never influenced myself
[47:36] to
[47:37] come to a place i fully want to give
[47:38] myself to the lord it's just not within
[47:41] me
[47:42] and you might say well well just second
[47:43] brother paul i think you understand what
[47:45] i'm saying saints
[47:47] it's god's influence in our life it it
[47:49] is predestination it is the holy spirit
[47:52] pulling on us because this old flesh
[47:55] gets weary
[47:56] and
[47:57] i know it's not you guys but it's people
[48:00] like you that have said i'm giving up
[48:03] and god comes and says eat those words
[48:06] amen
[48:08] revelations 12
[48:10] starting with verse 7
[48:12] and there was a war in heaven
[48:14] and michael and his angels fought
[48:16] against the dragon and the dragon
[48:18] fought and his angels
[48:20] and prevailed not now right here's the
[48:23] point we all stop and say hallelujah
[48:26] amen the dragon and his angels prevailed
[48:29] not
[48:31] neither was their place found any more
[48:34] in heaven in other words they started a
[48:36] whole block fight and got kicked out
[48:39] thank you lord and the great dragon was
[48:42] cast out that old serpent called the
[48:44] devil and satan which deceiveth the
[48:47] whole world he was cast out into the
[48:49] earth and his angels were cast out with
[48:51] him
[48:53] so you see god did not leave satan
[48:55] homeless
[49:01] he gave him a whole nether in essence a
[49:04] whole another battlefield
[49:07] but do you see what the heavenly example
[49:09] was
[49:10] you catch that
[49:12] he's already defeated when he's cast to
[49:14] go into another battle
[49:16] so satan himself is actually in a state
[49:18] of desperation because he's already been
[49:21] defeated
[49:22] and all the tools that he had to fight
[49:27] were ineffective enough that he lost but
[49:30] god said you know what
[49:31] satan i hope you can catch my
[49:33] perspective
[49:36] i whipped you fair and square in heaven
[49:41] i'm going to give you another chance
[49:43] you imagine the devil going over giving
[49:45] you know that
[49:46] double hand clasp is often considered a
[49:49] hand clasp of sincerity
[49:52] and the devil going over and saying
[49:54] thank you
[49:55] thank you thank you for another chance
[50:00] because you see it could have been cast
[50:02] to the pit right there
[50:04] thank you for another chance
[50:07] but you see in the back of satan's mind
[50:10] oh i'm going to have to change my
[50:12] tactics a little bit because
[50:15] everything i was defeated at
[50:18] wait
[50:20] god has given
[50:21] to his children
[50:24] so now i'll have to attack them in a
[50:26] little different fashion because if they
[50:27] actually stand on the word
[50:30] i'm defeated again
[50:32] so what he's going to do is get us to
[50:34] shift off the word
[50:35] that's why since he comes in the way
[50:37] that he does the lust of the flesh the
[50:39] pride of life the cares of life all of
[50:42] these things and he's got to get you in
[50:44] that position because if we stand on the
[50:46] word
[50:48] i'm already defeated again
[50:51] yeah
[50:53] it's so beautiful i love it
[50:56] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[50:58] heaven now is come salvation and
[51:01] strength
[51:03] and the kingdom of our god and the power
[51:06] of his christ for the accuser of our
[51:08] brethren is cast down
[51:11] boy there's i'm telling you saints right
[51:13] here in verse 10 there is just a power
[51:15] packed right just right there the
[51:17] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[51:20] which accused them before our god day
[51:23] and night and they overcame him
[51:26] oh hallelujah did you read that did you
[51:29] hear me tonight
[51:31] and they who's they
[51:33] hallelujah we are they
[51:36] overcame him by our superior intellect
[51:40] or our great strength in our self and
[51:42] confidence you know we don't want to do
[51:45] anything to hurt our children's
[51:46] self-confidence because they'll need
[51:48] that to take a rapture
[51:51] no see nonsense
[51:53] the devil peddles these ideas
[51:57] no we're not here to hurt anybody's
[51:58] self-confidence but sometimes we just
[52:01] need a whoopin
[52:03] right sometimes we need to as it were
[52:05] the switch took to us
[52:08] makes you wonder in the day and age we
[52:09] live in how many grandmas actually take
[52:11] a switch
[52:13] to their grandchildren
[52:20] they overcame him by the blood of the
[52:22] lamb
[52:24] can somebody speak it with me
[52:26] and by the word of their
[52:30] testimony it's what you have declared
[52:34] jesus christ to be in your life
[52:38] that testimony is powerful
[52:41] that testimony will either put you in an
[52:44] attitude of victory or an attitude of
[52:47] defeat
[52:48] your testimony
[52:50] oh the devil made me say it no he didn't
[52:55] you let the attitude around you the
[52:57] atmosphere bring you to a place to
[53:00] declare victory or defeat that was
[53:02] actually going to be the title of my
[53:04] sermon tonight
[53:05] but i had to preach something that
[53:07] matched brother jason's song service so
[53:09] we're doing good
[53:10] amen but the word of their testimony and
[53:13] they love not their lives unto the death
[53:16] therefore rejec rejoice ye heavens and
[53:18] ye that dwell in them woe to the
[53:20] inhabiters of the earth now my brother
[53:22] and sister look here oh i'm going to
[53:24] preach this sermon while you're all
[53:26] standing up amen therefore reject ye
[53:29] heavens and ye that dwell
[53:32] in
[53:36] them
[53:43] the prophet of god said it's not for you
[53:46] this is paraphrasing it don't look for
[53:48] this quote this way
[53:49] it's not for you to wade through the
[53:51] cares of this life when you were called
[53:55] to live in heavenly places
[54:00] so look here this verse can just oh my
[54:03] goodness
[54:04] therefore rejoice she heavens and ye
[54:06] that dwell in them hallelujah anybody
[54:09] dwelling in those places heavenly places
[54:13] amen and woe to the inhabiters of the
[54:17] earth and of the sea that carnal realm
[54:20] that earthly fleshly realm those that
[54:23] are dwelling in that realm woe unto them
[54:27] my heart aches when i see christians so
[54:30] caught up in the world that the
[54:32] influence of the world is greater than
[54:34] any other influence you see what satan
[54:36] is doing he's drawing them out of their
[54:39] heavenly place
[54:40] into a carnal earthly place
[54:43] because he knows this scripture is alive
[54:46] he knows this word is effective
[54:49] the devil's come down unto you having
[54:52] great wrath because he knoweth that he
[54:54] ha
[54:55] but a short time
[54:57] hallelujah heavenly father we ask for
[54:59] the blessing on the word tonight in your
[55:01] name amen
[55:02] hallelujah you may be seated
[55:04] now look i want to come back i i'll
[55:06] probably be doubling back and i'm sorry
[55:08] i don't mean to be redundant but uh you
[55:10] look at this my brother and sister for
[55:12] you see we have this that as a voice in
[55:16] heaven is declaring now is come
[55:18] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[55:20] of our god now my brother and sister
[55:22] salvation strengthened the kingdom of
[55:24] god did not start when god threw the
[55:27] devil out of heaven but god is now
[55:30] declaring this plan of mine is going to
[55:33] now start to unfold for you to see
[55:37] you will now get to see what is going to
[55:39] happen and it's going to unfold before
[55:42] you and as it were you might say like a
[55:44] cinema or or a movie as it were you're
[55:47] now going to watch this all come but you
[55:50] see
[55:51] he's already declared the finish of this
[55:54] and so it's there that we know now has
[55:57] come salvation and strength
[56:00] god poured out strength my brother and
[56:02] sister it's not that we would come and
[56:05] be such weaklings we need to be
[56:07] weaklings unto ourself but in him we
[56:10] have been declared to be strong amen and
[56:13] so it's there that we need to make this
[56:14] declaration because as the word that we
[56:17] are reading here this evening says that
[56:19] it would be by the words of our mouth
[56:21] and i want to tell you tonight that paul
[56:24] in his own self is unable to even stand
[56:28] but
[56:28] paul's standing in christ i am powerful
[56:31] can you take that position tonight i am
[56:34] powerful in jesus christ i have strength
[56:40] amen in fact i am uh undefeatable
[56:44] oh not in my flesh
[56:47] but the christ that is in me has made me
[56:50] undefeatable you say but brother paul i
[56:52] i've had some struggles yeah no problem
[56:55] no problem you've already been declared
[56:57] victorious
[56:59] reminds me if i could just share a
[57:00] little carnal example reminds me i used
[57:03] to in years long time ago be really
[57:05] interested in boxing and it just reminds
[57:08] me there was a few welterweight guys
[57:09] they're the fun ones right the other
[57:11] guys lumber around and knock over houses
[57:13] but these guys are there and you know
[57:15] and bounce around and hit each other and
[57:17] i just remember one time this guy bam he
[57:20] bounces off of the deal and the
[57:21] announcer's like well it looks like he's
[57:23] finished
[57:24] and the guy staggers and gets up and
[57:26] they do their little thing and then for
[57:29] the next couple rounds he just defends
[57:31] himself and he's kind of staggering
[57:32] around and he comes out about the fifth
[57:35] round and you can tell something's
[57:37] changed
[57:38] and he just got a look in his eyes and
[57:40] he goes in and he starts pursuing his
[57:43] opponent
[57:45] you know most of us have the idea we
[57:46] need to run from the devil and hide from
[57:48] him
[57:49] how about saints we start pursuing
[57:52] our opponent how about we start saying
[57:55] if the opponent is in you know i was
[57:57] talking about books to you and if the
[57:59] opponent's in this book this book's gone
[58:01] if the opponent's in this apparel that i
[58:04] wear then that apparel is gone if it's
[58:06] in this music it's gone because what are
[58:08] you doing you're defeating the enemy
[58:11] not by fleeing from him but by pursuing
[58:14] him and in that fight it got to be about
[58:16] the seventh round and everybody was like
[58:18] oh my we've never seen this guy cut up
[58:21] like this we've never seen this guy
[58:22] battered like this but you know what
[58:24] when you look back into the fight you
[58:26] realize what was happening and he was
[58:28] going a certain way
[58:31] and his opponent started thinking oh
[58:35] i've hit him four or five times in the
[58:37] face and in the in the chest with this
[58:39] left hook
[58:41] it works
[58:42] you ever had that happen in your life
[58:44] little something comes in your life and
[58:46] the devil
[58:48] and then he sees you staggering a little
[58:50] time oh and he sees you stagger and the
[58:52] devil's gonna say yep gonna take him out
[58:55] but you know what happened was this man
[58:57] every time he would do that left hook he
[58:59] would drop his right hand
[59:01] and this guy just waited he took it in
[59:03] the face
[59:04] all beat up
[59:06] puffed up
[59:07] rough don't even look like he's got the
[59:09] holy ghost brother trevor
[59:14] but one too many times
[59:16] and the confidence rose too high
[59:19] he dropped his guard a little far
[59:21] and swings at
[59:23] and he just drills him right square in
[59:25] the face so hard
[59:26] once again just like he bounced off the
[59:28] canvas
[59:30] his opponent bounced off the canvas
[59:32] and i'm here to tell you that some of us
[59:34] could tell some stories about how the
[59:36] devil has whooped up on us but i'm here
[59:38] to tell you that overcoming power has
[59:41] already come and the victory's already
[59:43] been won and i don't care how many
[59:45] rounds it takes how long time is the
[59:48] song says that no matter how long it is
[59:50] till it comes we're going to be here
[59:53] we're going to still be fighting the
[59:54] devil's not going to defeat us and we
[59:57] look at this and realize that god is
[59:59] telling us saints what's coming down the
[1:00:01] path that we have salvation we have
[1:00:03] strength and we actually can say we are
[1:00:06] possessors of the kingdom of god
[1:00:09] amen i think that is so beautiful they
[1:00:11] overcome him by the blood of the lamb
[1:00:14] amen and by the word of their testimony
[1:00:16] and i'm telling you my brother and
[1:00:18] sister i might be putting a different
[1:00:20] little spin on this forgive me and they
[1:00:22] love not their lives in
[1:00:27] they laodicea not their life in laodicea
[1:00:31] laodicea had no attraction where it says
[1:00:34] here's life here's here's all that you
[1:00:37] have here's your joy here's your
[1:00:39] satisfaction they love not their life in
[1:00:42] laodicea because there was something
[1:00:44] that had been promised something that
[1:00:46] was so much greater to them that the
[1:00:48] love of the devil was not able to
[1:00:52] attract them
[1:00:54] oh my brother and sister there's
[1:00:56] something to that
[1:00:58] now let's just go on here so we're not
[1:01:00] all night
[1:01:02] the word taking us back in time as it
[1:01:04] were
[1:01:05] this great war that it's talking about
[1:01:08] that is taking place in heaven now i
[1:01:10] want to just bring this up to you in
[1:01:12] this sense and bring it to an example as
[1:01:14] it were in this fashion
[1:01:16] uh to uh the elderly as it were if you
[1:01:20] would go my brother and sister
[1:01:22] many of them considered the great war
[1:01:25] not to be world war ii or vietnam korea
[1:01:27] or any of those the great war was world
[1:01:29] war one and that was in a time when men
[1:01:32] still fought in a fashion that they put
[1:01:34] bayonets on their their their guns and
[1:01:36] they charged each other and yet there
[1:01:39] was chivalry if you had shot a man and
[1:01:41] he was laying there you you did not kill
[1:01:43] the helpless
[1:01:45] and and so it was there in the great war
[1:01:47] as it is and the scripture here in
[1:01:49] revelation is talking about a great war
[1:01:52] amen so it is uh the great war for you
[1:01:56] and i as christians
[1:01:58] is not world war one world war ii or any
[1:02:01] other war the great war is what's taking
[1:02:04] place coming out of the scripture in
[1:02:06] revelation 12. there is the great war
[1:02:09] there is the time now i'm telling you my
[1:02:11] brother and sister because satan has
[1:02:13] never been a gentleman don't you love
[1:02:15] how the prophet lays it out that the
[1:02:18] holy spirit is a gentleman
[1:02:21] but the devil's never been a gentleman
[1:02:24] the devil will get you when you're down
[1:02:26] he will he will do everything he can to
[1:02:29] decimate your life and destroy families
[1:02:32] destroy helpless children whatever it is
[1:02:34] that's the nature of the devil
[1:02:37] now my brother and sister are young
[1:02:39] people it's really sad because sometimes
[1:02:40] the devil attracts them and and quite
[1:02:43] young he starts to woo them into
[1:02:46] circumstances of their life that
[1:02:48] ultimately lead to to death as it were
[1:02:51] in destruction and he does it so so uh
[1:02:55] with such a finery that that people
[1:02:57] don't even realize but my brother and
[1:02:59] sister the gentleman is the holy ghost
[1:03:03] he's the one that wants to woo you
[1:03:05] satan's wooing but he's the one that
[1:03:07] wants to woo you and then reward you
[1:03:09] with the greatest life ever
[1:03:11] amen now this is not like a joel osteen
[1:03:14] twist on words of greatest life ever
[1:03:18] are you subscribed to on my twitter and
[1:03:21] my this and this and that and this and
[1:03:23] here you can send money this way and
[1:03:25] that way in this way and that way and we
[1:03:26] do accept cash
[1:03:29] that's not a greater life
[1:03:33] a greater life is free from the
[1:03:34] condemnation
[1:03:37] from the assault of the devil
[1:03:39] oh he'll ravage brother branham i i
[1:03:42] should have just put that in the sermon
[1:03:43] brother branham says he'll come around
[1:03:45] and scratch at your door
[1:03:49] he's going to scratch at your door
[1:03:52] but you don't have to open the door and
[1:03:54] invite him in
[1:03:56] and in fact you know it i know it works
[1:03:58] on some animals you know open the door
[1:04:00] and whoop on them
[1:04:02] you know that's the only way you want to
[1:04:04] open the door to the devil is in a
[1:04:05] position of strength
[1:04:07] you know when you're beaten down and
[1:04:09] having a hard day is not the day you say
[1:04:11] i'm just gonna fight the devil today
[1:04:13] because he'll overcome you in that
[1:04:15] condition but it's when peace has
[1:04:17] settled over you and you have comfort of
[1:04:20] who you are and the position god has
[1:04:22] called you to those are the times to
[1:04:24] face the demons as it were because then
[1:04:27] you know you're coming in a position of
[1:04:29] strength to face him amen so it's there
[1:04:31] as we look at this now look how far back
[1:04:34] in time this war my brother and sister
[1:04:37] is actually where our freedoms were won
[1:04:40] this war in heaven as it were now just
[1:04:43] take this don't don't get too technical
[1:04:44] on me okay because we know that as the
[1:04:47] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:04:48] the world is where our salvation come
[1:04:50] amen but it's in this war if you'll if
[1:04:53] you'll be kind to me it's in this war
[1:04:56] that our liberties were given to us
[1:04:59] because satan desiring to take you as a
[1:05:02] slave as a servant to use you and abuse
[1:05:06] you has come and his intention is clear
[1:05:08] but he was defeated
[1:05:11] not only was he defeated my brother and
[1:05:13] sister he was vanquished
[1:05:15] he was cast out he was utterly
[1:05:17] humiliated
[1:05:19] now you know it's really hard to say
[1:05:21] you're victorious when you're humiliated
[1:05:24] take that on the spiritual side as a
[1:05:26] christian
[1:05:27] hard to just really talk about i'm an
[1:05:29] overcoming christian i'm the bride of
[1:05:30] christ if you've been humiliated
[1:05:33] but god says i'm not looking at your
[1:05:34] human humiliation i'm looking at this
[1:05:37] fact and the fact that if you will just
[1:05:39] shift your position i'll take your
[1:05:41] condemnation and i'll put it right there
[1:05:43] and under the sea in the sea of
[1:05:45] forgetfulness under the blood of jesus
[1:05:46] christ so satan knows that you have the
[1:05:49] key
[1:05:52] to bind up condemnation
[1:05:56] we don't have to live under that what we
[1:05:58] have to do is take that key
[1:05:59] put it to work
[1:06:01] amen and bind that commandant but my
[1:06:03] life isn't perfect brother paul i'm not
[1:06:05] totally lined up on the word take the
[1:06:07] key
[1:06:09] amen put it in the lock turn the lock
[1:06:13] hallelujah
[1:06:15] so there that's the battle where our our
[1:06:17] freedoms were secured as believers
[1:06:20] as a song says maybe we'll sing it later
[1:06:22] not by power nor by might but mine by
[1:06:25] spirit saith the lord amen there's where
[1:06:29] our victory comes in it is not how long
[1:06:32] we've served or how we serve or what has
[1:06:34] been but it is by the spirit of the lord
[1:06:38] amen see now we go to verse 10 and let
[1:06:41] me just hit this real quick there was a
[1:06:43] voice in heaven loud voice in heaven and
[1:06:46] it says now has come salvation and
[1:06:47] strengthened king for the accuser is
[1:06:50] cast down
[1:06:51] i want every one of you that struggles
[1:06:53] with accusation with condemnation from
[1:06:55] the devil i want you to take this
[1:06:57] scripture tonight and i want you to
[1:06:59] repeat it to yourself
[1:07:01] he
[1:07:02] is cast
[1:07:04] down
[1:07:05] he's accusing you trying to bring
[1:07:07] condemnation in your life from a lower
[1:07:11] position than you occupy
[1:07:15] oh come on not a higher position a lower
[1:07:20] position and he's the one that is always
[1:07:24] trying to put himself up here so now
[1:07:26] he's trying to say look you yeah you up
[1:07:29] there
[1:07:31] you belong down here
[1:07:35] but who's going to listen to that
[1:07:38] come on the bride of christ is not going
[1:07:39] to oh brother paul can i just get
[1:07:41] personal for a moment we have
[1:07:44] accepted his invitation before can
[1:07:46] someone say amen
[1:07:48] but we can stand in this position of
[1:07:50] strength and look at him and say look
[1:07:52] now satan you've already been cast down
[1:07:55] once and as the word declares in the
[1:07:58] future you're going to get cast into the
[1:08:01] pit which is even lower
[1:08:03] why what are you telling us that we're
[1:08:06] down there we're above you
[1:08:09] we've overcome you
[1:08:11] and we're moving forward we're learning
[1:08:13] your tricks and we're done with you
[1:08:16] hallelujah and i know i'm kind of as i
[1:08:18] said being redundant but it just speaks
[1:08:20] to my heart amen and they overcome him
[1:08:24] by perfect attendance for 42 years
[1:08:28] in church
[1:08:29] no saints that's not going to do it
[1:08:32] and it's not even that we spoke in such
[1:08:34] a perfect language even though it's
[1:08:36] talking about our own testimony
[1:08:39] we overcome him
[1:08:43] i hope none of you are offended
[1:08:48] we can say we've got the holy ghost 10
[1:08:50] million times in our life
[1:08:53] and it won't change our position
[1:08:57] you know that
[1:08:59] i've got the holy ghost i got the holy
[1:09:01] ghost i got the holy ghost got the holy
[1:09:02] ghost got the holy ghost
[1:09:04] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:09:06] sister
[1:09:07] you take
[1:09:08] your life
[1:09:10] the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:13] and your testimony that i am a son or
[1:09:15] daughter of god and you start mixing
[1:09:18] that together it becomes no longer you
[1:09:22] it becomes him because the blood speaks
[1:09:26] the blood is alive the blood speaks my
[1:09:28] brother and sister and he speaks of
[1:09:30] greater things the scripture says than
[1:09:32] these so it's no longer what we have
[1:09:36] said although we should change our
[1:09:38] testimony our words our voice should be
[1:09:40] changed to match the word
[1:09:45] but you can say i'm saved i'm saved i'm
[1:09:47] a believer i'm a believer if there's no
[1:09:49] blood
[1:09:50] or the blood is not applied
[1:09:52] hey death angel
[1:09:54] don't come in my house the blood's in
[1:09:56] the pot
[1:09:58] oh that wasn't where the blood was
[1:09:59] supposed to be
[1:10:01] we have to apply the blood according to
[1:10:03] the word the blood is in my church the
[1:10:06] blood is here the blood is there the
[1:10:08] blood is in my pastor it was in the
[1:10:10] prophet no the blood's got to be over
[1:10:13] you
[1:10:14] hallelujah and in that position then we
[1:10:16] can come out in a power of st in the
[1:10:19] position of strength
[1:10:20] amen
[1:10:22] i love that my brother and sister
[1:10:24] overcome by the blood
[1:10:26] now look i'm not preaching anything else
[1:10:28] we know we have to have the holy ghost
[1:10:29] we know we've got to have a life that's
[1:10:31] lived correctly we've got to apply the
[1:10:33] word to our life but you'll find that
[1:10:35] when we get a revelation of one the rest
[1:10:37] start to fall in place for us
[1:10:39] amen so as you look at this now i just
[1:10:41] want to share a few little quick things
[1:10:44] i i was like oh there won't be enough to
[1:10:46] even make it and i look down at the
[1:10:47] clock and i'm like where'd the time go
[1:10:50] i wonder what it would be tonight
[1:10:53] if we could climb above the heavens of
[1:10:55] heaven
[1:10:56] and look at this great drama
[1:10:59] as it's getting set together now
[1:11:02] fixing to come to pass of god and the
[1:11:04] devil coming to a showdown
[1:11:07] i'm so glad
[1:11:09] i'm on the winning side now how can we
[1:11:12] make that declaration
[1:11:14] because we caught the revelation of what
[1:11:16] prophet was preaching in greatest battle
[1:11:19] ever fought and we realized one of the
[1:11:20] first things we're going to have to
[1:11:21] conquer is not go knock the pope off of
[1:11:23] his office see we've got to conquer the
[1:11:26] pope that's sitting on this sea
[1:11:30] i'm glad i'm on the winning side i'm so
[1:11:32] glad that i follow the lamb
[1:11:35] because it said the lamb
[1:11:37] overcame them
[1:11:39] for his king was king of kings and lord
[1:11:42] of lords
[1:11:43] you know all i got to do is get right in
[1:11:45] behind the lamb and just follow him
[1:11:47] hey man as he goes through this and this
[1:11:49] great battle that is taking place i
[1:11:51] don't have to step out and say okay i'm
[1:11:53] going to go conquer i'm going to go do
[1:11:54] this no sir i just stay right behind the
[1:11:57] lamb and where the lamb goes i go and
[1:12:00] when the lamb goes to battle i look at
[1:12:02] him and say i'm going to gird myself
[1:12:04] amen you know saints i probably
[1:12:06] shouldn't be this transparent
[1:12:08] but last wednesday when we were reading
[1:12:10] that about being girded
[1:12:12] you know when i got the revelation of
[1:12:14] that
[1:12:15] i was standing
[1:12:16] about right here looking at that screen
[1:12:20] and it leaped off at me and i thought
[1:12:22] hallelujah
[1:12:23] god wants to wrap himself around me and
[1:12:26] if he's telling me to lift my hands i
[1:12:28] want to lift my hands and if he wants to
[1:12:31] change something in my life he has
[1:12:33] liberty to do it i'm telling you i
[1:12:36] shouldn't it would have sounded more
[1:12:37] spiritual if i just acted like i caught
[1:12:40] that somewhere else but i want to tell
[1:12:42] you i just caught it right here standing
[1:12:43] in front of you sharing that it just
[1:12:46] leaped out at me and i was like
[1:12:48] wow wrap yourself around me lord
[1:12:53] not some just loose sloppy garment but
[1:12:56] wrap that perfect word right around our
[1:12:59] lives and let it pull up into every
[1:13:02] place that it needs to be pulled and let
[1:13:05] it be sown that my life would fit inside
[1:13:08] the word
[1:13:09] oh hallelujah
[1:13:11] amen i'm so glad i followed the lamb
[1:13:13] because it said the lamb overcame them
[1:13:16] for he was king of kings and lord of
[1:13:19] lords now let's go saints into hebrews
[1:13:22] the seventh chapter
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:25] and here as we look at this now i've cut
[1:13:28] this short for the sake of of the the
[1:13:30] thought tonight for time
[1:13:32] and you know it's all here you can find
[1:13:34] it dig deep in it dig deep deep deep
[1:13:37] deep deep into it
[1:13:39] for this melchizedek king of salem
[1:13:42] priest of the most high god
[1:13:44] now the prophet of god says that was god
[1:13:48] in priesthood
[1:13:53] all kinds of denominations got it all
[1:13:55] like another office special guy special
[1:13:57] envoy ambassador
[1:13:59] whatever
[1:14:00] you know it just makes sense to me what
[1:14:02] the prophet of god said
[1:14:03] he said this is god himself coming down
[1:14:06] himself revealing
[1:14:08] himself
[1:14:12] and also speaking words to abraham
[1:14:16] that only one with royal authority
[1:14:20] would be able to speak
[1:14:22] so there's some things that god just
[1:14:24] comes himself
[1:14:25] now we get a good firm grasp on on the
[1:14:28] holy ghost
[1:14:30] amen and and godhead
[1:14:33] and you realize that god going to assure
[1:14:36] that you make it
[1:14:38] come down himself into you and i
[1:14:41] he didn't leave it to just some other
[1:14:43] you see the prophet of god
[1:14:45] study this out prophet of god never said
[1:14:47] now you know after you guys kind of hang
[1:14:49] out with me for a while you'll probably
[1:14:51] no sir he said my job
[1:14:53] paraphrasing my job is to introduce you
[1:14:57] to jesus christ
[1:14:59] so actually the introduction bypassed in
[1:15:02] this context bypassed the prophet
[1:15:04] because he was making the introduction
[1:15:07] now you would never say oh brother
[1:15:09] trevor let me introduce you to sister
[1:15:11] kerry and then when you go to stick your
[1:15:12] hand out i knock it down and say no you
[1:15:14] can't you can't do that
[1:15:18] god said i want to
[1:15:20] be introduced to you personally
[1:15:23] just like when jerry and i
[1:15:26] 39 years ago
[1:15:28] thank you for your prayers we had a
[1:15:29] lovely lovely
[1:15:31] anniversary getaway
[1:15:33] got to hear some great preaching
[1:15:35] amen got to see friends we haven't saw
[1:15:38] for years
[1:15:39] it was beautiful
[1:15:41] but you know that little girl that was a
[1:15:42] friend of jerry's and it you know
[1:15:44] facilitated introducing us
[1:15:46] has
[1:15:48] jerry knows where she lives jerry knows
[1:15:50] how to find her i have no phone number
[1:15:53] for i have no address for why because i
[1:15:55] got introduced to the one that mattered
[1:15:57] to me
[1:15:58] amen and you know where i'm coming on
[1:16:00] that amen so it's there look at this
[1:16:03] this melchizedek king of salem priest of
[1:16:06] the most high god who met abraham
[1:16:08] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:16:10] kings and blessed him to whom also
[1:16:12] abraham gave a tenth part of all first
[1:16:15] being by interpretation king of
[1:16:18] righteousness and after that also king
[1:16:21] of salem which is king of peace
[1:16:24] so we see how in this position that it
[1:16:27] was melchizedek coming into the very
[1:16:30] presence of abraham and speaking to him
[1:16:33] and sharing with him and abraham
[1:16:36] recognizing isn't this beautiful
[1:16:39] recognizing the word for his hour was
[1:16:43] standing in his presence
[1:16:46] he didn't say hey god sent a messenger
[1:16:48] he knew who he was standing in front of
[1:16:54] and what it did
[1:16:56] was it brought abraham
[1:16:58] to the fulfillment
[1:17:00] of the word
[1:17:03] you know isn't it amazing
[1:17:05] i don't want to step out too far on this
[1:17:07] ice but isn't it amazing
[1:17:10] after all the mistakes abraham made
[1:17:13] god said
[1:17:15] i imputed it to him for righteousness
[1:17:20] imagine
[1:17:22] not like we're going to stand before the
[1:17:23] lord and say now lord you did that for
[1:17:25] abraham you have to do it for me i'm
[1:17:27] going to tell you right now what it is
[1:17:29] is god's going to fulfill the very
[1:17:31] promised word that was in abraham in you
[1:17:35] you don't have to come and say i i i
[1:17:37] want to claim that promise you are that
[1:17:40] promise
[1:17:41] you are that word for the hour being
[1:17:43] fulfilled and being brought forth the
[1:17:45] very life of it uh being placed in a
[1:17:48] position to to express itself now look
[1:17:52] at this my brother and sister uh and we
[1:17:55] look at this and now let's not forget
[1:17:56] this great fight that we've been talking
[1:17:58] about this great fight is going on right
[1:18:01] now around us
[1:18:03] but look at the beautiful types of
[1:18:05] scripture that it's nothing less than
[1:18:08] god himself has come down in our
[1:18:12] generation people are like no no it's
[1:18:14] just some representation of god that's
[1:18:17] good that's good for you as the song was
[1:18:19] sung tonight there are those who want to
[1:18:21] be part of the bride but god chose us
[1:18:24] special people oh about jumped out of my
[1:18:27] seat god chose a special people my
[1:18:29] brother and sister i didn't do the
[1:18:31] choosing you didn't do the choosing god
[1:18:34] did the choosing let's hear the call of
[1:18:36] god when he said come my son come my
[1:18:39] daughter because this is not some just
[1:18:42] little deal of vanity this is god's
[1:18:45] expression himself to you and i
[1:18:48] and he's coming along and he's made his
[1:18:50] choice
[1:18:52] hallelujah
[1:18:56] but what does the word tell us all that
[1:18:57] was in god
[1:18:59] was poured into christ
[1:19:01] all that was in christ was poured into
[1:19:04] the church
[1:19:05] which is us
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:08] so what is he saying here he's telling
[1:19:11] us the king of righteousness
[1:19:14] has been poured into you amen
[1:19:17] all that the king of righteousness was
[1:19:19] he has poured into you my brother and
[1:19:21] sister this is not just god coming to
[1:19:24] redeem some puny little people he said i
[1:19:27] have declared that he that is filthy
[1:19:30] will be filthy still and he that is holy
[1:19:33] will be holy still and the word of god
[1:19:36] come down and calls this separation and
[1:19:38] we said i am not identified in this
[1:19:41] filthiness i am identified in
[1:19:43] righteousness that's my heart's cry
[1:19:46] that's who i see in the mirror i see
[1:19:49] righteousness in the mirror
[1:19:51] but when i make mistakes i'm sorry devil
[1:19:55] i'm sorry devil i'm not coming down to
[1:19:58] your position i have been called into
[1:20:01] heavenly places and that's where i
[1:20:03] choose to dwell
[1:20:05] oh there's times i dip into the potholes
[1:20:08] of life
[1:20:10] but i am not going to take up residency
[1:20:14] in the pothole
[1:20:16] hallelujah
[1:20:17] so the king of righteousness has been
[1:20:19] poured into you that's what the word
[1:20:21] says and the king of peace
[1:20:23] is resident
[1:20:25] in you
[1:20:27] that's why my brother and sister we say
[1:20:29] well you know do i have the holy ghost
[1:20:32] we've all struggled with those things
[1:20:34] and i'm telling you these thoughts these
[1:20:36] interconnecting thoughts were already
[1:20:39] flowing today
[1:20:40] have nothing to do with anything that
[1:20:42] we've bumped into this was part of my
[1:20:44] part of my thought today my brother and
[1:20:47] sister you see what it is
[1:20:49] is the righteousness of christ
[1:20:51] is beyond us
[1:20:53] the word says our righteousness
[1:20:56] is filthy
[1:20:58] rags so my self-made righteousness is
[1:21:03] just nothing but a bundle you know it's
[1:21:05] pretty funny jerry and i had to go take
[1:21:07] care of some business today and and uh
[1:21:09] we're driving down the road and and
[1:21:11] we're coming up to a stop sign or
[1:21:13] and i'm like what is that what is that i
[1:21:15] was sure it was like a dead animal
[1:21:17] it was just a rag
[1:21:20] all fluffed up
[1:21:22] looked like a raccoon
[1:21:24] just couldn't quite put a nose and legs
[1:21:26] on him
[1:21:27] but you drive on up the road and there's
[1:21:29] a dead deer
[1:21:30] i felt bad for the little guy
[1:21:34] the devil got to him before he ever got
[1:21:35] mature enough to understand that cars
[1:21:37] kill
[1:21:40] do you follow me
[1:21:44] so looking at this now
[1:21:46] as it is the
[1:21:48] king of righteousness
[1:21:51] he's filling him
[1:21:52] us up
[1:21:54] he said but paul i don't feel too
[1:21:56] righteous
[1:21:57] well
[1:21:59] you haven't necessarily if you follow me
[1:22:02] been filled completely
[1:22:04] right
[1:22:05] people say well when we're completely
[1:22:07] filled with the holy ghost
[1:22:10] i think god's got grace for us because i
[1:22:12] think the filling will never stop
[1:22:17] he will be pouring himself into us
[1:22:20] even as we walk
[1:22:22] in glory from glory to glory brother
[1:22:25] david hit it right on the head right
[1:22:26] there from glory to glory he just keeps
[1:22:28] pouring itself so if you're looking to
[1:22:30] be completely so filled with the holy
[1:22:32] ghost that nothing will bother you
[1:22:35] then you're going to be disappointed in
[1:22:36] yourself because this flesh
[1:22:39] is the the vehicle god chose
[1:22:44] god chose it for you
[1:22:46] brother barry made some comments that if
[1:22:48] you listen to the sunday morning service
[1:22:50] you'll you'll understand i'm not going
[1:22:52] to elaborate on them but it is an
[1:22:54] eye-opener and he made a declaration of
[1:22:56] folks up there and he says now
[1:22:58] if the things that have happened here in
[1:23:00] the northwest
[1:23:02] hard things disappointing things
[1:23:06] but if god
[1:23:08] had not allowed it
[1:23:10] it would have never
[1:23:12] happened
[1:23:16] you say well perfect will permissible
[1:23:18] will this will that will my will there
[1:23:20] will know my brother and sister if god
[1:23:22] doesn't want it to happen it ain't
[1:23:23] happening
[1:23:24] and if god wants it to happen you can't
[1:23:26] stop it
[1:23:28] brother barry went on to say this is
[1:23:29] what has caused people to move from here
[1:23:31] and there and to go and things to change
[1:23:34] it's beautiful
[1:23:35] i'm not normally kind of a pep talker
[1:23:37] for somebody's sermon but it was a
[1:23:39] beautiful sermon
[1:23:40] amen so you see all that was poured into
[1:23:42] christ rice righteousness saints was
[1:23:45] poured into me poured into you
[1:23:47] holiness poured into you and i
[1:23:50] amen peace you say brother paul we live
[1:23:52] in a stressful world imagine what it'd
[1:23:54] be without the holy ghost
[1:23:56] we'd be a bunch of drunks partying drunk
[1:23:58] in the alleys and whatever else would be
[1:24:00] the filthy stuff we won't go into but
[1:24:02] you see my brother and sister god really
[1:24:05] has brought peace to us you say we have
[1:24:08] struggle in our house you have peace in
[1:24:10] your house because you are going to
[1:24:12] change your vocabulary you're going to
[1:24:15] change your language you're going to
[1:24:17] change what you are focused on and
[1:24:19] you're going to change it to the realm
[1:24:21] and say god said that he is the king of
[1:24:24] peace and he is in me and he is in my
[1:24:28] house and there's going to be peace in
[1:24:30] my house
[1:24:31] there's going to be righteousness in my
[1:24:33] house there's going to be holiness
[1:24:35] displayed in my house
[1:24:38] and you start speaking out and you will
[1:24:40] see it start to rise up but my brother
[1:24:42] and sister the devil comes and he tries
[1:24:44] to prick the little balloon as it were
[1:24:47] because he wants it to burst to prove to
[1:24:49] you he can still get to you and he has
[1:24:52] burst your little balloon amen
[1:24:55] but i'm telling you there's coming a
[1:24:56] time and it is now that the bride of
[1:24:59] christ is being prepared against the
[1:25:02] pressure of laodicea and she can stand
[1:25:04] the pressure not only can she stand the
[1:25:07] pressure she will thrive in this
[1:25:09] pressure because she'll be able to say i
[1:25:12] can't be burst satan you lost the
[1:25:14] original battle you lost that battle and
[1:25:17] when you lost that battle you lost me
[1:25:23] you can't make a claim on me now because
[1:25:26] you lost me in the original battle
[1:25:30] not a circumstance of laodicea not a
[1:25:32] spirit story in laodicea i was sealed
[1:25:37] and you were sealed before the
[1:25:39] foundation of the world and filled up
[1:25:41] with righteousness and filled up with
[1:25:43] holiness and filled up with peace and
[1:25:46] all of the virtues of god
[1:25:48] what we got to do is just keep the
[1:25:50] balloon a little cleaner so we can kind
[1:25:52] of look inside there as it were and see
[1:25:55] what it is god actually poured into us
[1:25:58] oh caught up in cares of life caught up
[1:26:00] in this caught up in that
[1:26:02] i don't know
[1:26:03] i know just uh
[1:26:05] i won't mention any names or nothing but
[1:26:06] i had just a lovely conversation with a
[1:26:08] young man
[1:26:09] raised in a message home
[1:26:12] drifted away from god
[1:26:15] came to a place in his life
[1:26:18] that he didn't know if there was even a
[1:26:20] god starting to believe there wasn't
[1:26:21] even a god
[1:26:23] but look how god works
[1:26:25] he's out mowing a yard
[1:26:29] with headphones on
[1:26:31] of all things a man who's not sure he
[1:26:33] even believes god exists
[1:26:35] is listening to the prophet
[1:26:38] tell me god doesn't have a sense of
[1:26:40] humor the devil's like it doesn't even
[1:26:42] exist it's not real but there's
[1:26:44] something inside there and this young
[1:26:47] man many people had said he's just kind
[1:26:49] of went too far he's out on the fringe i
[1:26:52] don't know how he'll come back but i'm
[1:26:55] telling you he told me this himself face
[1:26:57] to face i'm mowing the yard and i'm
[1:26:59] listening to the prophet and the prophet
[1:27:02] is speaking you know the the the
[1:27:03] circumstance the woman's standing there
[1:27:06] and brother branham's desiring it and
[1:27:07] brother branham says to her and the
[1:27:09] devil lied to you
[1:27:11] and this young man's on the lawnmower
[1:27:13] and those words ring in his hair the
[1:27:15] devil lied to me and he starts sobbing
[1:27:18] and gives his heart to the lord on a
[1:27:20] lawn mower
[1:27:22] not in a church service not in a revival
[1:27:25] not in an altar on a lawn mower
[1:27:30] come on saints my god is an awesome god
[1:27:33] he's a powerful god and he has already
[1:27:36] won the victory and he's already given
[1:27:39] me the victory

[1:27:44] hallelujah not to stand here defeated
[1:27:46] woe unto me stand up remember the
[1:27:49] scripture it's going to be by your voice

[1:27:56] declare victory when i don't feel
[1:27:58] victory yes tell me if you'll show me
[1:28:01] scripture where god said you feel it
[1:28:04] then you'll believe it oh my brother and
[1:28:06] sister he said you believe it and then
[1:28:09] you will feel it
[1:28:10] hallelujah the devil's tried to twist
[1:28:13] this thing or we got to feel something
[1:28:15] to respond to it

[1:30:18] brother and sister we have stepped into
[1:30:21] the presence of the king of peace
[1:30:23] and then all of those things that had
[1:30:26] our mind tore up are suddenly subject to
[1:30:30] the king of peace
[1:30:31] oh we're not hypocrites we're not liars

[1:30:37] king of peace and suddenly it's good in

[1:30:53] to us
[1:30:54] amen you can't come unless he calls you
[1:30:56] we know that
[1:30:57] but i tell you you have to step across
[1:30:59] the threshold yourself amen
[1:31:03] can can you say amen to that i can't
[1:31:06] tell you how many times i'm so troubled
[1:31:08] i joke with my wife the joke about the
[1:31:10] preacher they don't want to go to church
[1:31:12] why should i go to church why should i
[1:31:14] go to church because you're the pastor
[1:31:18] but you step into the presence
[1:31:21] of that king of peace
[1:31:23] and suddenly
[1:31:26] all is okay
[1:31:28] all is okay i can go from tormented
[1:31:31] troubled
[1:31:32] doubting myself doubting everything
[1:31:35] around me
[1:31:36] to worship him
[1:31:38] and just
[1:31:40] a heartbeat
[1:31:42] because the presence
[1:31:45] of the king of peace
[1:31:47] has been poured into us
[1:31:49] oh can somebody say thank you lord
[1:31:53] hallelujah i'm so glad otherwise we'd be
[1:31:55] neurotics like the rest of the world
[1:31:57] saints
[1:31:58] we'd be just as neurotic as they are
[1:32:00] don't think because you believe the
[1:32:02] message that that took that away from
[1:32:04] you what took you away i'm plagiarizing
[1:32:07] this and i it's not really plagiarizing
[1:32:09] if you say it but i tell you brother
[1:32:11] barry brought out a really awesome point
[1:32:13] that really stirred my heart and he said
[1:32:15] you can believe and act on the word of
[1:32:17] god in this hour because of your
[1:32:20] proximity to jesus christ it's not the
[1:32:23] books on your shelf it's not who you
[1:32:26] know where you came from it's your
[1:32:29] proximity to jesus christ is what makes
[1:32:32] this word alive
[1:32:34] oh lord help me get closer help me get
[1:32:37] into your presence lord i want a
[1:32:40] supernatural saints
[1:32:42] not so we can boast on it but to live in
[1:32:45] that presence of god
[1:32:47] oh hallelujah
[1:32:50] hallelujah
[1:32:51] now i want to go i got to hurry here
[1:32:53] amen
[1:32:55] oh my
[1:32:56] in the seven church ages this is a
[1:32:58] little bit lengthy but i'll just try to
[1:33:00] go through it because in this my brother
[1:33:03] and sister is one of the keys of how you
[1:33:06] have come into the presence
[1:33:08] of the the prince of peace
[1:33:11] the prince or king of peace and the king
[1:33:13] of righteousness this is this is a
[1:33:15] little bit puts it right in here but now
[1:33:17] he's standing in the midst of the church
[1:33:19] aren't you glad tonight
[1:33:21] amen as he stands there revealing who he
[1:33:24] is in this last age he calls himself the
[1:33:27] author of the creation of god
[1:33:30] this
[1:33:31] is another creation
[1:33:34] this is not a creation that these people
[1:33:36] out here who want to be wicked
[1:33:39] even have a clue
[1:33:41] they have no understanding amen
[1:33:44] this has to do with the church which is
[1:33:46] you
[1:33:47] this is a special designation of himself
[1:33:51] now imagine my brother and sister how it
[1:33:53] is
[1:33:55] to be able to come
[1:33:57] and sit in the presence of god
[1:34:00] and have god
[1:34:01] himself
[1:34:03] mark you
[1:34:06] it's not the church
[1:34:09] it's not the message as it were
[1:34:11] it's god himself
[1:34:13] putting a special designation
[1:34:15] on you
[1:34:17] you know have you ever done that
[1:34:20] been somewhere and something special
[1:34:23] happens
[1:34:25] it's pretty funny how that works
[1:34:27] sometimes
[1:34:28] brother trevor sister carrie
[1:34:31] we had a lovely time in florida did we
[1:34:32] not
[1:34:34] and when we got on the plane in front of
[1:34:36] you and they moved us up into comfort
[1:34:37] plus i just know you guys thought why
[1:34:39] them
[1:34:44] but the problem was
[1:34:47] is that special designation of comfort
[1:34:49] plus
[1:34:51] was right across from the bathroom door
[1:34:58] and i was like i would gladly trade
[1:35:00] almost anyone on this plane their seat
[1:35:05] as the flight from florida
[1:35:07] to seattle the door went bang bang bang
[1:35:11] bang bang bang
[1:35:18] some special designations aren't worth
[1:35:21] what the devil
[1:35:22] wants to give you
[1:35:25] oh you can be rich you can be powerful
[1:35:28] you can be an influencer
[1:35:31] scrap all them designations i want to be
[1:35:34] designated
[1:35:35] as a son of god
[1:35:37] i want to be designated as this is one
[1:35:40] in whom i am well pleased
[1:35:44] and the whole time you might be going
[1:35:45] through a fiery trial
[1:35:47] and god's over here saying
[1:35:49] i'm well pleased with you brother trevor
[1:35:51] and you're like wait the house just
[1:35:52] burned down on the wheels fell off the
[1:35:54] car
[1:35:54] and then we realize
[1:35:56] that is not what it's about
[1:35:59] this
[1:36:00] is what it's about
[1:36:02] this is what we're fighting for
[1:36:05] now look here there's another creation
[1:36:07] this has to do with the church a special
[1:36:09] designation of himself
[1:36:12] he is the creator of that church the
[1:36:15] heavenly bridegroom oh
[1:36:18] created his own bride
[1:36:22] oh my brother and sister that's
[1:36:24] beautiful that's beautiful oh but i'm
[1:36:27] just short i'm just this i'm not smart
[1:36:30] like them i'm not strong like them you
[1:36:33] are god's created tabernacle
[1:36:36] amen rejoice in who you are rejoice in
[1:36:39] what god has done in your life and his
[1:36:42] promise to fulfill
[1:36:45] after all you know if you're not as a
[1:36:47] man over
[1:36:48] five let's say i'm five ten and a half
[1:36:50] so if you're not over 510 you don't make
[1:36:53] the rapture
[1:36:56] if you're not got beautiful hair that's
[1:36:58] curly sisters you're not making a
[1:37:00] rapture
[1:37:02] if your church don't have more than 300
[1:37:04] people god's not there
[1:37:07] come on
[1:37:08] i am a tabernacle you are a tabernacle
[1:37:13] amen almost said if you don't have curly
[1:37:15] blond hair but we all know there's only
[1:37:17] one in our church that has curly blonde
[1:37:19] hair hallelujah but look my brother and
[1:37:22] sister it is not about us god said i
[1:37:25] need diversity in my body i need
[1:37:28] diversity in this world and i'm going to
[1:37:30] show the devil that as it was in this
[1:37:33] original warfare
[1:37:36] that this mere mortals
[1:37:41] i'll still beat you
[1:37:45] come on you got to think about it as
[1:37:46] though this is the alley turf war
[1:37:51] not too smart
[1:37:52] not too strong not to this not to that
[1:37:56] not this not that not that not that
[1:37:58] devil i'll still beat you
[1:38:01] because i'm going to pour my spirit into
[1:38:04] them
[1:38:05] and the devil's there going hey come on
[1:38:06] that's not fair
[1:38:09] but you see he didn't give up
[1:38:11] because
[1:38:12] i think god might help i don't know
[1:38:14] don't make a doctrine here god might
[1:38:16] have gave him a preview
[1:38:19] of these vessels he's going to pour
[1:38:21] himself into
[1:38:23] and i'll just i'll just bring this right
[1:38:25] home so i wouldn't offend anybody
[1:38:27] the devil would look down on paul
[1:38:28] haylett
[1:38:29] and said i can beat him
[1:38:33] but what he didn't know
[1:38:34] is every day is sweeter than the day
[1:38:38] before
[1:38:39] every day there's something happening
[1:38:42] and it's not paul hey let the devil has
[1:38:44] slapped him in the dirt so many times

[1:48:19] but sure in stages of your life has come
[1:48:21] to say
