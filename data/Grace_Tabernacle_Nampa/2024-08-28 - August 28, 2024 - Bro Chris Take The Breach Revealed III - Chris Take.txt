that's beautiful amen thank you brother Alex and sister the musicians there amen it's good to be back in the house of with God tonight and Brother David sister Diane God bless you welcome home amen if you want to stand with me tonight we're going to take part three of the breach revealed and um have a couple of scriptures here Matthew chapter 25 um but my subtitle or the subject of this part is the mystery in The Virgins um and we'll read these scriptures here and then we'll do a bit of a a review um before we get into this so Matthew CH 25:1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be liken unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish okay all 10 took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom but five were wise five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him midnight is the darkest time of the night then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so so gone out so one time they were lit but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves so there's a space of time where the lamps are needed to burn it's not it's not just step out the door there's a space of time where the lamps have to be burning so they said hey we don't have enough we have just enough to last that period of time you go get your own and while they went to BU the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us so this would imply they went they bought oil and they came back but they were too late but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not so no relationship watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh John chapter 3 John 3 verse one so Nicodemus here in the scripture there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except him born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verely verily brother B says absolutely absolutely I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but can not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be Jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things verily verily I I say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness if I have told you Earthly things and you believe them and you believe not how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life I know it's long few more verses for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God this is the condemnation that light is com into the world he is the light of men right Christ and Men loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word tonight Lord I pray You' come father with your with the Discerning spirit and speak to us Lord may this may the person of Christ father be be obvious before our view tonight may we see you father in plain view father may you come and open the door of our hearts Lord Jesus father that we would step into a place with you a secret place with you father and we would commune Lord as the word would come forth we would step into that we would push aside even the distractions within the building we would step into a place where it's us with you and you would minister to our hearts Lord may you come and have your way tonight bind every word that would be contrary every opinion of man it may it just be your word pure unadulterated May there be Focus father May there may we not get carried away either side but keep right on the thought we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may have your seats tonight so I want to do a bit of review here um to make sure we're all on the same page and if you can't read that that's okay I'll read it for you um so we we've been we're on part three of the breach revealed and and I wanted to kind of kind of remind us why that's our that's our study title and it it comes from the transition brother man preaches the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals so there's a trans transition there's a point where God in order for in order for the word to be open for the seals to be open the lamb had to take the book so he had to go from what the work he was doing through the church ages he had to step forth and open the book and now we know as we looked in the past couple of of of services that the mercy seed is in the bride of Christ so God continues his ministry in the bride and we say the completion of the seven Church ages we understand we are under the um under the umbrella of the lean age cuz there's a delay the the Bible says time no longer but the word has moved forward into what brother brand calls the bride age amen so we transition at the opening of the word into the bride age and we're not looking back we last service we covered a lot about not looking back to the previous age which would be Pentecost that's the spirit of the frogs in Revelations looking back right the three the three frogs and that's the Trinity so looking back so if you're calling for a word from the previous age you're under the anointing of denominationalism you're under that anointing and it won't give you Victory today you have to take a hold of I am present truth so the reason we're this the breach revealed is because we're we're talking about the change that happened in time in the breach in the separation between the close of Pentecost and the opening of the word and a lot of we we talked about uh the Feast of atonement on the first part and we last time we talked about uh the going back so tonight we want to look at in this space what is revealed from the mystery that's in the virgins and so um we have in here in Genesis chapter 3 verse six so now that we've done a bit of review let's get into the sermon tonight I want to look at at a a few different things that you know there's a lot of um we say but it's revealed but there's there's a lot in this story that we want to bring out that comes forth from this this this time this transition of the word and there's a few things we we that we'll touch on but I want to give you a high level uh I want to point to them real quick the holy spirit is the moisture that Waters the seed and when the when the foolish the all the virgins get their lamps and they go forth so they're traveling they're going to this place they're preparing for the bridegroom and in the Terry in the Terry the foolish virgin let the oil from their lamps burn burn out and when the when the cry comes so there's a cry that comes there's a message there's a shout that comes then the then the bride they all get up to go but that happens at midnight The Darkest Hour of the night according according to to science which if you think about it you know brother talks about darkest before Dawn I think midnight one two like that's the middle of the night right it is the darkest before the dawn if you're in Alaska the sun rises at 2 in the morning so okay um but once once the bride the other thing is the foolish virgin is not the bride I know that's very obvious but to say in those words for myself really brought a lot of things to light so the foolish virgin is not the bride they were never intended to be the bride amen they were not predestinated to be the bride they will go in the tribulation they will seal their they will seal their lives with their sacrifice the physical sacrifice they will be hunted down and killed and they will rise again after the Millennium and the general resurrection and they are the they are the sheep that are she separated from the goats this is all in the message so that's those things there so in in Genesis 3:6 we I want to look a little bit at at the Hybrid when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also un her husband with her and he did eat now brother R says a few things in spoken word is the Original Seed and I do apologize this the text is small we're working on that um cuz I'm a Macbook guy in the church is Microsoft so or apple versus Microsoft but in the book word is Original Seed he says the original has the life so so so Adam was the original amen Adam was the original word of God Eve was the byproduct so when Eve she she she tried to take the word of God and mix it with some wisdom and it brought death that's why the flesh is dead and brother says Eve brought forth a hybrid crop yes sir amen so and he was that seed that Eve should have produced so before the word seed could bring forth a crop in Eve he found her pregnated Adam found her already pregnated with the spirit of denomination or the spirit of the Antichrist or the spirit of the serpent the the seed of the serpent so Eve brought forth a hybrid crop so the word mixed with something else that's right that's why it was hybrid amen it can only be hybrid if it's word mixed with something else so Eve was word but she wasn't the original word amen original word will not mix Adam was not deceived he made the choice Amen to receive to to receive Eve back to him so he was not deceived he was complete word there was no way for him to fall to you know Mrs serpent he was original the original word so he has the original life Eve wasn't she was a byproduct and so so then God has to come and and and produce a bride who is the original amen okay so yeah he in that in this he says mix with some wisdom he says you're not supposed to do that that's right so the unbelief in the Garden of Eden hybrid the human race but then says we're we're hybrid he talks about he talks about this hybrid and and we'll come to it the reason we're laying this Foundation is because we'll come to where he talks about the foolish virgin is the hybrid so without the Life of Christ we stay hybrid the flesh so if you think about it the bride of Christ is it's something more it's something more there's there's a there's a life within us that has taken us over but then says you're not you anymore that's right that has to happen otherwise just what happened at the end of the church ages with Pentecost Christ came and found a bride pregnated with denominationalism so he that at that transition there so Eve fell and she mixed it wasn't the original creation she was byproduct of man amen so sometimes I get ahead of my notes here but I have to make sure staying staying in tune so the wise and the foolish version are the Saved church and if you remember last time I I made the comment you know there's just so many quotes yeah that I can't I don't have time to read them so I have footnotes so if you ever want to know where I got this from we can definitely have the conversation but all of this stuff is referenced with with footnotes which I think is fantastic but um so the wise and the foolish version are of the saved church that's right but the bandom says that in the 10 virgins and the 144,000 uh Jews so you have the wise virgins and the foolish virgins now this is this is Virgin so this is Holy clean Sanctified Justified Sanctified okay so so the the the the differences here is that is that the wise they had their lamps full of oil and they were burning the foolish had they had nothing they had the lamp they had the lamp but they had they had nothing they were there they were there waiting on the waiting for the bridegroom so they were in place he and and and and he says so it's it's not a filthy church that's right it's a Sanctified clean church right that's what the saved church is brother B says he says in in in and I think it's the same message they were both on the road he said so it's not enough to just be on the same road that's right so in other words there was a there was a portion of Revelation the foolish virgin had a hold of that's right to to be in that position this is this is this is not the daughters of the this is the Virgin but says they had the seed we'll come to that but they had the seed so he says um in here in broken sistance he said there has to be something there deratization the holy spirit is here now to germatize that and bring it to a reality to you he says all the time it's not the blood it's the life in the blood it's not the seed it's the life in the seed I can have wheat all day long First Age the first church age had the seed but that seed had to be planted they didn't have what we have today we we have to we have to understand that we and when we talk about going back to the original we have to be careful that we're understanding a reprod reproducing of the original the original was Christ we're not trying to impersonate Paul Peter Silas them we're not trying to impersonate them we are trying to get to what the original which was Christ himself and he says he says when he when he opened himself up he was the Holy Spirit that was in the Garden of Eden was to water the seed so Christ was pierced in the side that come forth that water come forth now to water the seed but it has to be gerti or it can never produce life and he he talks about he s the he'll say the woman's seed okay he's talking about that that the there's the two in the equation to bring life you have to have both together but the woman has a seed or different terminology an egg right we have chickens y'all a bunch of us here have have chickens we go out to the thing and we can get eggs all we want not worry about it because there's no rooster right exactly it's a seed it's the potential to be a chicken right but there's no life that's it you see so that's the woman's seed so something has to happen to bring that to pass there has to be a deratization of that seed so the holy spirit that was in the Garden of Eden was to water the seed so the watering the moisture so Christ Christ was the seed true life only comes through him amen and I'm I'm quoting the message true life only comes from him because Christ was the seed so God is a spirit right we understand the Holy Spirit was Christ coming back as the comforter he was that seed coming back there the the the water the washing by the water of the word the water was the word was given to water the seed right you understand you got to have the both because at one point in time the foolish virgin had oil in their lamps yeah amen so wasn't that the end all solution we sometimes we we look at it that way and to make points you know that's fine but if we're not careful we stay there and we forget the fact that there's there was something they had to go to the virgins had to go to what a a be shut in with God they had to come to a place where they shut in so the lamps had a purpose for a season now you hold on to that when I'm not blaspheming you give me a second to pull through this so that was to water the seed so now in in Luke chapter 8: 6 we B references this in this sermon that we're we're speaking a lot from the spoken word it's Original Seed I know it's 6 hours but go home and listen to it um he says in the scripture and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture so he makes he's making a point here off of the moisture and he says he says thee first thing you know denomination binds him up into a place and the moisture of the spirit is gone from him so we're in a position now today where we're not talking about a a a a church church member so one of you we're not talking about one of you decides I'm going to go be a Baptist that's not what he's talking about he's talking about the Spirit of denomination and the spirit of denomination at its root is Antichrist but as we saw last time with the frogs it's looking back and what when you look back and say well I'm going to I need that I need what they had back then I didn't live back then but I want to be that there and that thing is is now that's that's a rotten carcass and only vultures eat that and if you start to feed on it you lose moisture that's right that's it okay you lose moisture you say well brother Chris I thought we were sealed up by the Holy Spirit we're getting there we're getting there so he says he says the moisture of the spirit is gone from him so he's directly referencing Luke 8:6 so so this can happen this this takes the moisture from the seed now no life comes from the seed the seed is still sitting there in the rocks and if you found it you wanted to you could eat it right just a piece of wheat or you could take it and go plant it somewhere else it still has the potential but where it's lying the position it's in there is no place for it to come forth and bring forth life the original life so now he says in spoken word it's the Original Seed I'm going to say that a lot so just assume if I don't say I'm referencing this now look the unwise Virgin is going to be the hybrid see she had the seed without the oil the moisture to make it grow right now now I have to be honest for a long time I was puzzled by this till you begin to see that it's it's it's not the seed the seed is not enough the seed is not enough and that I mean that'll choke you if you don't pray about it and seek Revelation the seed is not enough it is the life that comes from the seed amen and the only way to bring the life from the seed is for moisture he says that's the oil which is the holy spirit brings forth the moisture so then you say okay well they had did they just not have the oil long enough in a sense yes but there was something that this was bringing the virgins to this was something that was bringing them to a position for something to happen because if you can have the moisture and then get dried up well then we would all be walking around saying well goodness gracious I hope I don't dry up and be afraid and but if you're the predes a child of God you can't be unsealed you should be having questions right now you should be looking at me very skeptically he says he says the germ that's inside the seed that's the life in the seed that's right and he he talks he talks he talks a lot about about the rain falling on the just and the unjust so this is this is that the holy spirit this is the holy spirit falling whatever the seed you have brings forth that life that's right so you can be in in the in the church be underneath the the Holy Spirit and you're not bringing forth the life you look like the wheat you shout like the wheat but you don't bear the life of the wheat that's right but yet the same rain is providing you the moisture that's right okay so remember though that's wheat and tears that's right the foolish virgin had the wheat seed but they never got the rain they didn't have the moisture enough to bring them to that place where they could well I'm not going to spoil it bring them to the place so they both had the seed right the foolish virgin be believe believed believe I don't know present past tense however you're want to put it they were preparing to meet the Lord along with the bride brother R says that in sudden secret going way of the church they everyone believed in the coming of the Lord in in spoken word is Original Seed he says you can't be a seed and disagree with the word because the word is the seed I I had to prayerfully Ponder on this because because then then he says the seed not he doesn't necessarily say the life of the seed he says the seed and disagree with the word so they agree with the word they believe in with the with the bride because they got the seed but they don't have the life they don't have moisture in their lives to bring forth the life you see you can agree with the word and not bring forth any life the Pharisees agreed with the word tell Jesus came in flesh hope you're catching that came in flesh the word is in flesh again they agreed with it to that point and then they they couldn't receive that they couldn't receive the life word in flesh is very much alive very much alive so there's there's there's nothing to point you say but they're they're clean they're Sanctified they're holy now we're not going to spend the service on the foolish virgin but I'm using this to to to as a foundation of of how you can see then who the bride is okay the bride being the wise virgin so that they both have the seed but when the cry comes forth go you out to meet him now they have to go forth to meet the bridegroom right at that point in time the bride has the oil right their lamps are burning they're ready to go the foolish vergin are not so now what's the lamp's purpose I want to look at this a little bit here cuz both groups had lamps so if the lamps was all you needed God wasn't fair the bridegroom wasn't fair cuz he said I don't even know you but they had the lamp at one point they had the fire and the oil and the scripture implies that they returned to the shut door with oil in the burning lamp cuz they it says they went to buy and they came back so that wasn't enough at that point in time okay they were shut out into into the tribulation now I'm going to say this I don't rightly know the position of the foolish virgin in present time I do know the position of the Bride in present time so whether they're out there looking whether they're knocking that's up to God I'm not going to say either way that's up to God but the bride it's very plain in the message and in the Bible where the bride is and that's all that matters right I want to know if I'm bride I want to know all about the bride if I want to be the bride I want to know all about the bride you know if I'm trying to be a if I'm trying to be a carpenter or a woodworker and I want to build you know Japanese style furniture so there's no screws no glue everything just holds together then I I want to do everything I can about that I want to become that you know I see a person who's really good at that I want to I want to do whatever they're doing to do to produce the same so as the bride of Christ we look in the word we see I want to know who the bride is how does she act what is she wearing because I want to put on the same garment I want to be in the same position that the bride is in so let's look at the lamp's purpose here so in in in uh in real quick I I I pulled this from the the the Jewish encyclopedia and now it was a bit confusing because there there's different sect of Jews and and and there's uh Jews apparently that that after after uh ad70 they went into India apparently history says so there's these different Jews and they all kind of have their own different wedding ceremonies so I'm I'm not going to I'm not going to build the doctrine off of this but it just it was just very interesting that you that you see in all of this that they they used torches and different ceremonies the the Torches were Incorporated in the process sometimes it was a a torch over the doorway to the bride's house some and a lot of times it was the the ladies with the bride Tor had torches carried them to the wedding and the or the bridegroom came with the Torches like there was always this this in this transition period of of coming to the bride or coming to the bridegroom there was always the torch so it was obviously at night there's always this this so when when Jesus here is is speaking this he's speaking this you know I wish we had solid evidence of how it did it when Jesus gave the the parable but but nevertheless he's giving a parable based on their traditions of marriage their their marriage ceremony one of the one of the sect of Jews that they say is was was in India way back in the day they the the groom would would read uh he would be he would read so they would have a seventh day feast and on the next Sabbath which would be the eighth day he would be the eighth person to get up and read and he would read he would read uh Genesis was it 24 I think where elzer goes to get the bride which I thought was very cool but um so there's a lot of information there but regardless there was there was this this this time this these torches were used and I know this is familiar stuff but it's just for me it's good to to touch back to the to this here and so in in in um so they they take their lamps and they go forth to meet him so the the the lamp the reason we're saying all this is because the lamp holds an important um does does a an important job in the process of coming to the marriage okay so in uh in in Matthew 251 they the the Kingdom of Heaven liken unto 10 virgins they took their lamps yeah hold up get in I don't have this one took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom so they go forth to meet the bridegroom with their lambs and like I said in the Terry the foolish let their lamps go out because they lack the new birth okay they lack the new birth so in in um and then in Matthew 20 in the same chapter in verse 6 he the cry comes and then they say go out to meet him so there's these two they go to meet the bridegroom then there's a Terry and then they must go out to meet him so they need the lamps they need the lamps to get them to Something in Exodus 26 think about lamps you have the Candlestick right or the manora how they call it today and and uh this this is uh he says Exodus 26:35 set the table without the Veil The Candlestick over against the table on the side of the Tabernacle toward the South that shall put the table on on the North side so the Candlestick resided in the Holy place or the sanctuary so it was the last room or the first room however you look at it in the tent before the holy holies so Christ dwells behind the veil that's right so brother Bram says he says that these real quick I just want to see okay so so the the the um the way this was lit is this was the this was this is the original and the this is lit isn't there a thing on here yes there is okay so this this is the original this is lit this is all olive oil pure olive oil and this is lit from the fire off the altar so B says that's the original that's Christ and then and then the the the little thing is blown out and they light it off this flame and light the second and then they relight it it off the second light the third so it goes down through the church ages as we'll see now there's there's another scripture here okay so the way to so the way to the veil was lit by the Candlestick it was the light in that Sanctuary you got all them heavy heavy um coverings and the badger skins and all that that outside the tent you go inside there it would it would be too dark to see your way to the veil without the candlesticks so those were there glowing and and all the types that we have there lighting the high priest's way to the veil behind the veil there was no need for M for a man-made light because Christ himself was there so the Candlestick lit the way to The Veil The lit the way to the veil of Christ okay the fire typing the holy spirit for the seven Church ages each lamp was lit okay we already went over that and then in Psalms he says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path amen David C catching a bit of Revelation here from the Tabernacle in the wilderness and the layout of the temple so the word the the the the the the Candlestick the the representing the Holy Spirit the word through the church Ages was the light the light to the path where where are we going we're coming back to God in flesh we're coming back to Christ the complete person of Christ to us unveiled before us the unveiling of God and then the invisible Union of the bride of Christ so God veiled in flesh again so we're we're we're coming down this I'm going to slow down we're coming down this to this path to the way so the lamp is lighting our way to the veil and just he says it it's wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven Church ages he says the original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring came direct from Jesus on The Mercy Seat is end doing his church through all seven ages so it's from The Mercy Seat that you have Christ on The Mercy Seat there behind the veil you have these candlesticks there and we have this this uh drawing here of the seven Church ages and by and put on the candlesticks and then that's the the measure of or how much light he saw although he did say this was total darkness he says I can't see past 1977 now enter my personal opinion that was the close of Pentecost that he saw the total darkness because the church going back to denomination but the word was coming and the word is that sliver of light he put in there to signify there's a bride in the last age in the darkness in the Terry in the time no longer so at the after the first man we're we're cruising after the first church age the word was hidden again behind the veil so God Christ came he died on the cross my wife told me last time I was too fast I'm going to really try to slow down right here cuz I get excited I I'm in my study and and like I just don't even know what to do with myself have to the time I I don't know what's I don't know what's going on but every time I go to the book I I it's almost to I can't even contain it I can't I can't even I can hardly I can hardly keep my senses about am and I'm not trying to overp spiritualize myself but when you begin to get into the book and you get into the substance of the book you the word comes to life in in such in in in depths that you you you saw the surface before you understood the surface before you understood the writing on the outside right but you begin to look between the lines and you're looking on something that's never been talked about Even Heaven said sh amen and there was silence you get into this place and then and then you know you just kind of forget yourself and that's all you want to do is is just is feed on the word and feed more and and and and and as a minister studying this there's just so much that that I have to and maybe I pulled maybe I I sifted too much but um you know it's it's I'm I'm realizing as we've been given the opportunity here a few services in a row that it's best if I can do small doses then you can meditate on that but I I want to slow down because as a man I can get up here I can get going too fast and then I get in the way but we let the the the the Lord come and speak to our hearts so I'll try to slow down so after the we we see and I and I have a drawing and I just I haven't transferred it enough yet I Dre it on paper and I'm trying to get it out like this but I just I didn't have the time to complete it but I will have it probably in the next one of the next Parts but um when when when God came and and he and he and he died on the cross he he he completed the sacrifice he redeemed redeemed the people redeemed the people of the book the veil was rent in the H holy the holiest now they had access to Christ and then and then he comes with the Holy Spirit down upon them in the upper room okay so this is transition but the Original Seed had to go in the ground to bring forth a crop so down it went and how did it go down you say oh my goodness you know the csil of NAA how terrible it was all in the hand of God cuz he had to bury the seed amen what was it it was denominationalism the spirit of the Antichrist buried the seed it's always the same Spirit burying the seed but buries the seed Now we move we move from from the holy place if you will in history to the sanctuary then out of that to the outer court till we're outside the gate and then and then as the word comes brother bam says outer court is justification inner court is sanctification holies of holies is the baptism of the Holy Spirit and and so if you think about it when we were outside the gate then came Sardis with Luther and we got justification so we were back in this in the outer Court okay then we had Philadelphia Wesley he took a sanctification to the to the inner Court uh the the the sanctuary the holy place and then Pentecost in leoda took us back into the holiest of holies okay okay but but that's but that um took us back to the holy spirit so restored it back but all the while it was this lampstand the Candlestick lighting the way back to something now Theo now the holy spirit gives you access to the holy place but do you know what you're looking at do you understand what's behind the veil do you have an understanding of Christ are you or are you just walking in and and and that's it are you or are you getting a relationship with Christ are you getting shut in with Christ in that secret place amen so it was lighting the way back to the veiled word and and and the angel of the Lord tells him you know he shows him the the I think it's the big auditori Auditorium in the tent or whatever it is the light goes over the tent and he says I'll meet you in there that's the third pull so in other words there's a place we must go there's something we're going to be shut into it's a secret amen it's a secret and we must get to there so we we are then taking the lamp and we are going to meet Christ and the lamp which is the holy type of the Holy Spirit the oil is type of the Holy Spirit the lamp is lit bringing us to that place so in in well back here to Matthew 25 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut amen that's right so the lamps brought the bride to the bridegroom amen but there's something but says Beyond Pentecost that's right there's something more there there there's this there's this Christ in flesh if if if the lamp was enough then then we wouldn't then then that would be Christ in flesh there has to be relationship because he says it's Christ again in his bride ready right here I I got a quote right here not Twain but one that's right they are one not they will be that's right present tense they are one a husband and a wife is no longer two but one that's exactly right and Christ and his body is one and the Same Spirit was in Christ as in his bride in his body that unites them together with all the word and God living in there himself that's right manifested he says Christ came well I but there was the the it was pregnated the church was pregnated by denomination he came to impregnate himself into the womb of the Bride is God then a fornicator no so where are we in Matthew 25 that's it the door shut that's right the bride is in with the bridegroom where are the foolish virgin in this space of time I don't know I have opinions but I'm not going to say them but the bride has gone to this place you see it in 62 brother Bram says Christ is engaged well guess what before the opening of the word he was that's right he was that was the shout the bridegroom's coming the bridegroom is coming that was the shout he was engaged now today 2024 he is married to the bride the wedding supper is the celebration after the marriage that's right and the honeymoon is after the wedding supper the Thousand Years in the Millennium so this is where we are so the lamps had their purpose it it's the holy the oil is the holy spirit lighting the lamps leading the way to Christ and when you get in that place with Christ that's the new birth that's why you see it's so hard you look one place but says absolutely the holy spirit is not the new birth then he says the holy spirit is the new birth and he say says it's the seed you as long as you have the seed gen of God in you you're good to go then he says it's not the seed it's the life in the seed that's right you see 6 to1 half dozen or the other it's the same thing because if you have the lamp if you have the Holy Spirit and the light you're going to get the new birth in this point of time in this space of time but if you T too long and let your life go out let your life go out you will find yourself in the wrong position so you have to get to Christ you say oh I don't want to be the foolish virgin guess what then marry Christ get into that place with Christ step into that place with him how do you do that is there a place you go is there a church you go to is there a a mountain you go hiking to is there a place in the wilderness you go camping alone is there is there a meetings in the midwest meetings in the east coast meetings on the west coast that we have to go to to get there no he says it's a secret I'll meet you in there so in other words when you you begin to see Christ between the lines you're having an intimate relationship with him because the outside world knows nothing about it the world has polluted intimacy but true intimacy the world outside knows nothing about it true Intimacy in a marriage between a husband and wife the world knows nothing about it it's just something they share so no wonder people get confused when you say read between the lines that's it or they tried to read between the lines without being in Christ and they just get way off or they say no you're getting too complicated we simplify what's complicated and we complicated complicate what's simplified we look at the word oh the seals the seals and we'll miss it but says it's simple it's simple yet as you get into it into the word of God it becomes more simple you get more Revelation about it but it's not something you just happen upon so in in a sense it's complicated because you don't just happen upon it you have to be studious you have to pursue Christ while at the same time Christ is pursuing you so I just love it I just love it love the word of God so you're you're pulling more into Christ so Christ's body United as his bride being one they're not two anymore they're one God living in there himself manifested this is why why people are calling for the Holy Ghost okay I might as well say my opinion they're calling for the Holy Ghost calling for a Revival that's the spirit of the foolish virgin amen the bride set calls for more of the word amen the Holy Spirit now I I want you to just pray about this the Holy Spirit isn't enough that's right you need the new birth said brother Chris you just contradicted yourself not if you're thinking clearly not if you got your spiritual cap on or he says what brother say put your coat on right because that gets you to that place that is the vehicle that brings you to the New Birth it's not enough to just hold the lamp if it was there would be no separation between the wise and the foolish cuz they wouldn't got the oil so well just the wrong time okay but that's not enough the bride had to go to the bridegroom the lamp led her and the Word was unveiled to the bride now she's in a place where her lamp will never go out because she shines Not By the Light of a lamp but by the Light of Christ himself a sustained light there is no draining of the oil you see before that reunion with Christ there's a draining of the oil but you step into that Union with Christ the oil never runs out Elisha a type of the Bride says go get you need to pay your bills you need to you need to make KS meat we tell oh yeah what a nice story but there's a deep within that the oil never ran out you see when you get the bride becomes in her position carrying on the ministry of Christ the oil never runs out so as the bride of Christ you will be compelled compelled and driven to spend time with God to get more of his word to get more Revelation about you can't I have a quote I have a quote here I have a quote okay I'll just jump to it he says Christ is a mystery of God revealed you can't commit adultery you're already pregnated amen he can't take a hold the womb the denomination the womb of life is closed to anything else you're already his by predestination the seed has come to life amen so there's no fear there's no running out of oil how can you say I'm not Christ when Christ himself is in you pushing forth so not Twain but one he says he's going to sew his seed somebody is going to get it because they're predestinated to be a they're they're predestinated to be a church at the the end of the road amen signifying that consummation of the marriage happens here that's right happens here so in Matthew 25 I ask you where are we amen where are we you see it's so close it would deceive the very elect if it was possible the Virgin the foolish virgin so close they got the word they agree with the word they go to church with you that's right absolutely they confess the word they they they'll even get excited about it but there's no relationship that's it that's exactly so you go outside of church and you you're confused by their actions you're confused by their interests you're confused by their family life you're confused by the disorder in their home are we saying people in this place are foolish virgin absolutely not but it stands true that if that is the behavior of the foolish virgin who have the seed but no moisture it stands true that a child of God can have dryness in their life and they aren't bringing forth the word because they've not yet come to that place you see that's why I I keep saying through this series God isn't always linear the bride is shut in with Christ yet there are seed of God who are coming to the revelation of who they are so it's not cuz brother says it's not a group it's individual right it's individual so individually speaking there are those who just have the lamp and the and the fire but they will come to a revelation of Christ himself but until they get to that place we don't we want to leave them in God's hands but there is nothing wrong with looking at that and saying that's not Christ you might be a child of God but your behavior is not Christ that's not judging that's not judgmental because if we just said oh Grace for everybody be whatever you want then no one will be compelled we're supposed to compel by the word compel our brother compel our sister sometimes even say you know what are you sure that you say this but this is what the word says are you sure all in love you see but it's a it's iron sharpening iron we're not called up here to just look saints of God when you begin to see this you realize we don't have any time we are in the de we are in the delay time no longer if you look at the Timeline 7,000 years second 7,000 years we're at 6,000 the next thousand is supposed to be the Millennium so we're in this space of time where there's a delay you should be you should be not Not Afraid not like oh goodness driving down the road looking for like Locust with long hair you shouldn't be living your life like that or in fear of all this stuff like I miss it and I miss it and you come home and everyone's gone they're supposed to be there I missed the Rapture not like that but a but we got to get rid of the apathy that's right we have to get rid of the apathy we don't have time to mess around we we have to get into the word of God and then when you're in the word of God you have to keep in the word of God you have to keep in that place amen Lord help us you see this and you and you read the word and you understand this is within the church because it's the saved church at this point in time you know I just I personally I can't see that being denominations they're not clean even if they're even if they're preaching truth their lives aren't clean they're not they're they're they're you know at the pool in shorts they're they're they're they're cutting their hair that they might be touching on the word that we see is truth but there was there was truth in Pentecost I was listening to a Pentecostal preacher it popped up and I watched it he believes in baptism in the name of Jesus Christ he believes in in in the not in the Trinity and all this stuff and and it's I mean it's chaos you know they're speaking in tongues he's preaching about the name of the Lord it must be done in the name of the Lord and it's all true but it you have to remember that there was truth in Pentecost and that truth says it doesn't go away it carries into the next age and there's more to it there's more revelation of the word as it transitions so there's more oh the name of the Lord the name of the Lord yes but what are you going to do with This Man Called Jesus that's right he that is in you right the invisible Union of the bride of Christ so it's good it's truth but it doesn't give them victory in their lives because it's the message of the past age they need the whole truth so you see this and you watch that and I and I say this with with love in my heart and sincerity but there's a lot of message preaching and that's all it is if that was enough I could go join the Pentecost that's right if that's all I need I could go to there true evangelism is not preaching like a Pentecostal preacher that's right true evangelism brother says is is bringing conviction down upon your heart and saying you're not living right that's right I thought I was going to preach this time on the balance of the fold Ministry but maybe that's part four but you see true evang we have this idea in our head that evangelism is is simplified word evangelism is still the present word for our day that's right amen so do we have do we have evangelists or do we have men who don't have have a revelation of the open word that's it and they can say the words third pole Seven Seals but they Don't Preach third pole Seven Seals they are preaching like Pentecostals amen the Bride of Jesus Christ can not survive on that meat amen they need the substance of the word they need the present day word which is the opening of the seals so we just got to preach every message on the seals if you understand what the seals is the answer is yes because it's Christ revealed to you you can't see the message the same way you can't look I can't saints of God I cannot take this book and look at it like a Pentecostal because I have seen the greater truth I have seen who God is am amen and in doing so I realized how much more I want to see of him amen but I can't survive but you say but it's truth and it's in the message it is but the message progressed through dispensations there was a point in the message where he Christ was engaged but then there's a point in the message where your Miss Jesus Christ there is a progression so if if this is why people get get off in left field and say Well only after 63 no take what you read before the seals and filter it through the open word that's right brother says love is the Holy Ghost that's it don't stop it there pull it through the open word oh it's not he says a lot of other things well I'd rather have uh wild fire than no fire at all pull it through the uPorn he says calm down you're missing it you're trying to get fire he says careful you don't get the gift without the giver he brings it into balance that's why his church split right which if you think about it is an amazing type Pentecost split from the bride age that's right they went back and if you're not careful of you're caught in the Pentecostal age what happens when there's a transition and we covered this already but I for your remembrance sake for those of you who weren't here when you're caught in the transition previous age will persecute current age that's it that's it if if if somebody says they have more truth than you and they come at you combatively that is not the spirit of Christ right if they're posting on social media to make points to show you your wrong that is not the spirit Christ therefore don't be deceived when they say Lo here is Christ or there here is Christ don't believe it amen take it to the word amen take it we we we can't like I understand you know immediately all of us are thinking of people maybe or churches but I'm not saying that at all but you you have to understand like you can't just give this a casual look this is truth or nontruth that's right this is Eagle food or vulture food and a True Body of Christ won't survive underneath that kind of ministry you will starve to death amen you will start to look elsewhere for something to feed you and eventually either God will change the heart of the pastor or he'll move you that's exactly because you have to go to truth the bride can't survive off of that amen so you realize that and you see this and then you and then all of this stuff comes from it I'm not saying figure out who's preaching nontruth don't even worry about them that's exactly right I'm saying be careful you're not underneath that's it the anointing of a previous age make sure you aren't the anointing of present truth amen the only way to do that is to get to Christ amen to open your book to challenge the status quot to challenge what you hear what is preached go back to it go to the word study the word amen but most of all just be more sincere we do a lot of goof and off when it comes to church I've done it I do it sometimes and I see it sometimes and if we're not careful we just say oh that's the spirit of the age and we excuse it you know it's like brother Bram he's talking about he talks about um um Mary Magdalene I think it is delivered of the seven demons and he lists them stress Pride we and so what I'm the point I'm making is if we're not careful we just excuse things that are are Flatout demons but the that's the Pentecost because why God smiled upon it so to excuse well that's a little thing well what what's a big thing that's a little sin what's a big sin depending on who you are if you're Mafia you know little sin is only killing one guy a month big sin is you know 40 guys a month right it's not it's not about what's big what's little and if we're not careful we we that's why I'm saying it's so important that we come into the present truth of our age because underneath Pentecost underneath that age God smiles upon a lot of things but no longer does he do that that's right he draws a straight line for the B calls it a Razor's Edge that's exactly right amen so therefore in order for us to get to the place we need to be we have to be more sincere we have to say is this right something that that everyone accepts a behavior that everyone accepts but something niggles at your heart don't ignore and just say well it's just it's just that it's just little go to prayer go to the word say God is this right and if it is then God will show you and if it's not right he will show you to fix it amen it's important that we come to church y it's important that we are in the house of God because we must be preaching fful Ministry the next part because it because it's the fful ministry is is what's given to perfect the bride amen and he's given you a church streaming is not streaming is the devil's gray area that's it for you to get fivefold Ministry look you can press play on the tape or you can press play on the stream either way you're still pressing Play Amen and you're missing a revelation got to be in church and and and when you don't have a fervent desire to be in church and you're okay with it look I'm speaking from past experience okay yes sir I'm preach I don't I'm not preaching from up here I'm preaching from right where you are from past experience if you let things build up that keep you out of church pretty soon you'll be excusing church for the simplest things I I ask you to do this I ask you to do this audit the last two months of your life of how many times you've been in church you see we we go through life and we think oh we just you know we just missed a couple Services here and there and then if you actually go back and look at it it's like oh I've only bought a few coffees and then you balance your account you're like wow that's $150 in coffee that wasn't a couple coffees AIT he said that's so psychological the holy spirit is the greatest psychologist that I know dividing aunder the very thoughts and intents of the heart amen go back and audit it say okay did I go to church Wednesday that I go to church Sunday and look at the list you know this is simple but this is something for somebody and go from there and say if it's if it's really lacking then you just you know get back on track because God is faithful I'm bringing this down to a close here so why didn't Pentecost bring the marriage they were pregnated by the spirit of denomination y that is the close of the seven Church ages so the the seven Church the the the the seven Church ages does not bring the impregnation of the Bride it brings the bride to the place she needs to be it's the light to the place she needs to be to become impregnated with Christ Christ isn't going to marry a hor and Christ found Pentecost in adultery but the bride of Christ brought forth by the call from the bridegroom won't be found the same he's coming back for a bride amen you see there's three comings of Christ yes but the son of man came in our day yes sir amen I was talking to a brother and you would know if I said his by name said him by name a a wellestablished brother with with great revelation of the word but he told me he said something had happened and he and he and in his church and he was in his position now and he went to the word for months and he studied the word and he took I think it says the seals through 65 and he said I went through and I studied in a sentence what did we miss what did we miss why is the church in this condition and he said I I came to the place I realized we miss the coming of Christ that's it we're not looking we're not looking for for a return besides the Rapture that's it that's right the son of man has come that's right as in the days of the coming of the son of man whatever that days is we're living in it that's right he has come what was the cloud amen that was Christ exactly that was the coming of because a son of man revealed the son of man amen so that was Christ amen a son of man but says the man that met Moses uh Abra on the back side of the desert he says God in flesh like a prophet that's it he says discern Sarah's heart behind his back and then he says in there I will return again according to the time of life are we waiting that return no he came that's right he came and what happened Sarah got pregnant that's right that all that's not all that happened he completely changed him you see the bride of Christ has to be changed to a original word because original word won't fail so we are not Eve amen we are Mrs Adam amen Mrs second Adam we can't be deceived we can't fall let me say it this way the bride of Christ can't fall that's right careful you don't get a arogant spirit say I can't fall right right I I I I here we go it bothers me that there's some much preaching you're the bride you can't fail you're Victorious no you're not the bride unless you get your life into Christ that's right you need to do that first okay that was my opinion so amen I said we were closing spoken word is Original Seed I I had to put this in here he says but oh God it amazes me how much of this message preached in 62 is IR relevance to the opening of the word he says but oh God there's a germ of life come from the real seed that God proved it was his seed he rose up again see that through that life that's going over the Original Seed you see why did it rise up again because it was the original seed planted in the ground that's what he's saying because the title is the spoken word is the Original Seed he says that through that life that's going over the Original Seed like was given to Eve over his real church is bringing forth life again amen through the birth through the womb of his bride amen God is not a fornicator no we we are impregnated the bride is impregnated by the word the same way Mary was be it unto me amen according to your word what is it a receiving of the word amen a rece an accepting of taking the challenge saying I will receive it amen and then what Mary with the seed of of of Christ you can take her in this and as an example of the Bride she goes now Christ is on The Mercy Seat of in the bride in the heart of the Bride amen she goes to she goes to Elizabeth and as soon as she sees her John comes to life amen I'm not trying to make a Doctrine just saying the power of God was within her why because she received the spoken word we're all trying to get the power of God and you see that all the time oh the power of God what is the power of God is to speak life amen what is life life is Christ life is the word of God it is not to make all the pews fall over or make you fall out of the Pew no so through the birth through the womb of his bride the womb of life is closed you're already his that's it the seed has come to life you see he says he says Christ is the water and and in order to bring the seed in your heart because the ver SLE fullish virgin had the seed the wise virgin has the SE seed but then she goes in with Christ and now she's got the other part and it brings forth life that's it it brings forth Christ and the full manifestation of the impregnated bride is the rapture amen she's pregnant right now am but Oh Glory one of these days we're going to have forth a promised son which is Christ himself exactly right coming down Amen to take his bride away amen saints of God it's exciting time for the bride of Christ so this is what you have she is him amen amen let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come amen we're not looking for this to happen no you don't have to wait for it to happen no it is there for you to take a hold of today amen there is I I I you know this is it they you know the world stole that I think they saw it somewhere Michael Jackson This Is It no that's the bride's message this is it amen amen this is it if if you're waiting for something else you're stuck in the wrong age amen this is it amen so all you have to do is go into the bridegroom Christ how's that how's the scripture go throned not on in I can't remember you forgive me anyways we maybe we're supposed to close but not not thrown not on the throne never mind if you remember what I'm saying it's in Revelations he's talking about the bride Christ not on the throne but in the throne in the throne man there's so much because it's the two have become one so there is no there is no judgment for the bride that's happening right here amen amen all we have left to do you know a little squeeze to get us more sincere to get us more dedicated however that looks like I think we should stop trying to figure that out just get more of Christ in us it's going to be something brother says different things you know right right before he completes his cowardly plot the bride's taken away so there's time where he's working on his cowardly plot whatever it is but Saints you know what we have to look forward to oh my goodness you talk about it you got the wedding supper I mean we always sit and we say man I wish we had more time to Fellowship we're going to be sitting at the table with each other and with Christ amen fellowshipping around the world what is the table spread with the word and then from there we go to A Thousand Years of Millennium to to it's God restoring completing the restoration of his word amen to say I to show just like he gave Noah the rainbow he gives us the Thousand Years to show to show us I have the curse is gone the curse is lifted a man can live for eternity and that's what we have an opportunity to live our lives how we were supposed to with nature not against nature build houses build Plant V years and we will reap the fruit of it there's so much in the word of God and if we can just be more sincere I think that's where we where if anything tonight take that home amen let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you so much for your word tonight Lord and we're grateful father and in light of in light of what was
