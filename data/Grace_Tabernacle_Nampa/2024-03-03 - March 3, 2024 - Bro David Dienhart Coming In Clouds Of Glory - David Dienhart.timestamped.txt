[44:32] scriptures I just want to feel very free
[44:34] this morning to follow the Lord's
[44:38] leading amen but I this this come to me
[44:41] just I had other scriptures marked out
[44:43] first but I want to read this ver in 2
[44:45] Chronicles chapter
[44:51] 5 my title this morning is coming in
[44:55] clouds of Glory
[44:56] Glory the glory we're speaking of is the
[45:00] shikina coming in clouds of the
[45:07] shakina
[45:09] now I may say some things it's maybe a
[45:12] little hard to understand for some maybe
[45:16] strangers or those are
[45:19] visiting and I by the way I want to
[45:21] greet those online not only you here but
[45:23] everyone those online that are listening
[45:26] in may God bless you with his
[45:29] word may he reveal himself to us is that
[45:34] what you're
[45:35] wanting you know faith is
[45:38] revelation now Revelation is the
[45:41] substance of things hoped
[45:44] for amen the evidence of things not
[45:48] seen this is our rest this is our
[45:53] strength but coming in clouds of Glory
[45:55] may sound strange you may you may
[45:58] disagree but before you disagree look in
[46:00] the word go back to the things our
[46:03] Prophet
[46:05] said it's all right to
[46:08] disagree and you may
[46:10] disagree but you
[46:13] pray and if you think I'm not right in
[46:16] what I'm saying here this morning then
[46:17] you pray for me that I may be right amen
[46:23] I can only preach what God lays in my
[46:24] heart to minister
[46:26] and as I said over this period of time
[46:28] there's been much much very much if I
[46:30] was to take everything that I put down
[46:33] as sermons we'd be here for a week or
[46:35] two every day maybe two or three times a
[46:39] day so trying to condense it no I'm not
[46:42] trying to condense it really I just this
[46:44] is just laid in my heart very
[46:48] deeply so second chronicles 5:13 and
[46:52] this is
[46:54] where they were
[46:56] Solomon had just finished the house of
[47:00] God we'll break into it here it came to
[47:03] pass as the trumpeters and singers were
[47:05] as one I like that were as one to make
[47:09] one sound to be heard in praising and
[47:12] thanking the lord and when they lifted
[47:14] up their voice with the trumpets and
[47:16] symbols and instruments of Music see
[47:19] music is a voice they lifted up their
[47:22] voice with trumpets and symbols and
[47:24] instruments of music and praise the Lord
[47:26] saying for he is good for his mercy
[47:30] endureth forever amen that then the
[47:34] house I want to put emphasis the house
[47:38] was
[47:39] filled with a
[47:42] cloud even the house of the Lord so that
[47:47] the priests could not stand to minister
[47:49] by reason of the cloud for the glory of
[47:53] the Lord had filled the house
[47:56] of
[48:00] God whose
[48:02] house you
[48:07] are then in seventh
[48:10] chapter I only keep you standing for
[48:13] these two scriptures here and then I'll
[48:15] let you be
[48:16] seated 2 Chronicles
[48:19] 7
[48:21] one now when Solomon had made an end of
[48:24] praying the fire came down from heaven
[48:27] and consumed the burnt offering and the
[48:31] sacrifices and the glory of the Lord
[48:34] filled the
[48:36] house yes sir and the priests could not
[48:39] enter into the house of the Lord because
[48:42] the glory
[48:45] shikina of the Lord The
[48:49] Cloud of the Lord had filled the Lord's
[48:53] House you may be seated
[48:59] the bride being his house how many
[49:01] believe that the bride is the body of
[49:02] Christ the house of
[49:04] God the bride is God's place of worship
[49:08] that's his body God has only one
[49:10] provided place of worship and that's in
[49:12] his
[49:14] body and that's in Jesus
[49:17] Christ amen remember Christ is the body
[49:20] and it's made up of many parts is that
[49:23] right amen but every part of that body
[49:26] is one part one
[49:29] Christ they're part of one
[49:32] head and that head is Jesus
[49:34] Christ and unless you Worship in God's
[49:37] provided place your worships in
[49:39] vain then how do we get into that place
[49:42] by one Spirit are we baptized into that
[49:45] one body by one spiritual baptize are we
[49:48] birthed into that body
[49:51] amen
[49:53] so so every member of that body are
[49:56] parts of members of One
[50:00] Glory One
[50:03] Cloud
[50:05] amen that one cloud is our
[50:09] head amen every part of that body is
[50:12] members of
[50:13] one
[50:18] person
[50:19] amen let's turn over with me if you will
[50:22] to Acts chapter
[50:24] 1 and before we do that I'd like to go
[50:27] to Revelations a minute let's just hold
[50:30] that in Acts one a minute but
[50:32] Revelations chapter
[50:35] 1 verse 13 I want to show you here is
[50:38] the coming of Christ up through his
[50:41] bride how much Christ come and what form
[50:44] does he come in today what form is he
[50:47] manifesting himself in in this hour and
[50:50] this
[50:53] day and if we see that then we're if
[50:55] we're seeing what part of the word we
[50:58] are and you can only to be the bride you
[51:02] must see what part of the word you are
[51:04] for the day to be the bride yes you must
[51:08] recognize your
[51:11] position the bride has a position and to
[51:14] some of you you may be as alarmed to
[51:17] believe that God has a
[51:19] bride that God is married to a
[51:22] wife and that wife is himself revealed
[51:28] in another
[51:30] form just as Adam just as Eve was part
[51:33] of Adam and revealed Adam in another
[51:39] form Eve was Adam re
[51:45] revealed so is the bride Christ
[51:49] revealed she's the mystery of Christ
[51:53] revealed she's the Caps cap capping
[51:56] Stone of the whole
[51:59] Revelation amen she's the
[52:02] Capstone part god wasn't finished with
[52:06] Adam but he was complete in
[52:12] Eve Eve was the complete revelation of
[52:18] Adam complete revelation of what God had
[52:21] in his
[52:23] mind amen
[52:29] now we could say a lot about that but
[52:31] we're saying a lot about it this morning
[52:33] as we go forth here but in Revelations
[52:35] chapter
[52:36] 1 and let's just look at him coming up
[52:39] through and see who is this one liken
[52:42] unto the son of man verse 12 and I
[52:45] turned to see The Voice John saying John
[52:47] the type of the Bride I turned to see
[52:49] the
[52:50] voice that spake with me and being
[52:52] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[52:55] we know you know the seven golden
[52:56] candlesticks are The Seven
[52:58] Ages all
[53:00] right and in the midst of the seven
[53:02] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[53:05] one like unto the son of
[53:09] man who' you expect the bride to be one
[53:13] like unto the son of man clothed with
[53:15] the Garment down to the
[53:17] foot and Girt about the paps with a
[53:20] golden girdle brother brandom said that
[53:21] was
[53:23] himself son of man himself self in
[53:26] Bride
[53:28] form garment dressed as a
[53:34] woman amen all right then he said he
[53:39] said a gird about the past with a golden
[53:41] girdle his head and his hairs were white
[53:43] like
[53:46] wool anybody ever see his picture
[53:50] today it was taken it was taken by the
[53:53] astronomers it was taken by many many
[53:54] people people in
[53:57] 1963
[53:59] right what was that
[54:03] cloud we look at the picture the right
[54:05] way and turn it to the right who is
[54:08] it why it's himself it's Jesus Christ
[54:12] returning again just like he left
[54:16] us in that form are you with me now he's
[54:21] what is now what is that what was it
[54:25] picture of what was it a what was it a
[54:28] photo of it's him the
[54:33] head all right now that seems strange
[54:37] maybe to some but if you look in the
[54:38] scripture I just said his head and his
[54:40] hairs were lightwe like white like wool
[54:42] and white as snow and his eyes were as a
[54:44] flame of
[54:46] fire and his feet like undefined brass
[54:50] his feet
[54:52] body as if they burned in a furnace and
[54:54] his his voice at the sound of many
[54:58] Waters what is that Ministry body
[55:03] Ministry amen all right now we go on
[55:10] here there we see him then in Acts 111
[55:15] if you'll turn me me where I said there
[55:17] in Acts
[55:21] 1 and verse 11 we could we could read
[55:24] the verse from verse 9 well let's take
[55:27] it from verse
[55:32] 9 let's just take it from verse eight
[55:35] because I want another scripture coming
[55:36] up here but you shall receive power how
[55:39] many receive
[55:41] power after the after what after the
[55:43] Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[55:46] shall be Witnesses unto
[55:50] me hallu to be a witness of him has to
[55:53] have a true testimony that's right
[55:56] amen and you're have your testimony is
[55:59] what of him him where him in you the
[56:04] same yesterday today and
[56:08] forever amen is that right all right he
[56:11] hasn't changed his Nature has he he's
[56:14] still it's still him it's still his
[56:17] character where is it what form is it
[56:21] in he say well Brother David are you
[56:23] expecting to see him again you better
[56:25] will but I'll meet him in the air he'll
[56:27] set foot back on the earth in the
[56:29] Millennium that man that died at
[56:32] Calvary amen but he is present here with
[56:36] us right now in the form of the Holy
[56:39] Spirit which is not another person it's
[56:41] himself that's right taking on a form or
[56:45] a morphe God himself putting placing
[56:48] himself as the actor into another
[56:49] actor's garment that's right amen is
[56:52] that right all right so he said here he
[56:55] said and you shall receive power after
[56:58] the Holy Ghost and you be Witnesses unto
[56:59] me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and
[57:01] Samaria even into the
[57:03] Caldwell amen and in Judea and Samaria
[57:07] and unto all uttermost parts of the
[57:09] earth who's going to witness of it
[57:12] where's who's the
[57:13] witness and the Bible said and I'm going
[57:15] to hit this first right here off the bat
[57:17] and the Bible said in St John 15:7 that
[57:20] you shall be Witnesses you are witnesses
[57:22] of me because you were with me from the
[57:26] beginning what was the beginning in the
[57:28] beginning was the word St John 1:1 in
[57:31] the beginning was the word the word was
[57:32] with God and the Word was
[57:35] God and the same was with
[57:38] God how is it with God as his thought
[57:42] because a word is a thought expressed
[57:45] and he expressed the thought of himself
[57:47] and you were included in that because
[57:49] you were with him from the
[57:51] beginning amen all right and
[57:55] so he he said and when he had spoken
[57:59] these things while they beheld he was
[58:01] taken up and a
[58:04] cloud received him out of their
[58:09] sight and while they looked steadfastly
[58:12] toward Heaven as he went up behold two
[58:14] men stood by them in white
[58:16] apparel what did they have what did what
[58:19] was their Ministry watch what their
[58:21] Ministry was what will be their Ministry
[58:23] to Israel
[58:26] those two Messengers what will it be he
[58:29] was speaking to them right here but look
[58:31] at what it is to us the seventh seal is
[58:34] the mystery of his coming because it's
[58:36] only known to the bride amen yes and the
[58:40] reason it's silent because it's a
[58:44] mystery amen but the mystery's been
[58:48] opened hello you say no it's been closed
[58:52] no the prophet said it's open
[58:56] amen are you with me all right so he
[59:00] said and he said a cloud he said and two
[59:02] men in white apparel stood by them and
[59:04] said which you men of Galilee why stand
[59:07] ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus
[59:11] which is taken up from you into heaven
[59:13] shall so
[59:15] come shall so come in like
[59:21] manner as you have just seen him in in
[59:24] verse n go into
[59:28] heaven all right so he's
[59:31] come he's coming he's being
[59:35] manifest somewhere where is
[59:39] he and it'll take that manifestation
[59:42] that
[59:43] Revelation to let us be caught up to
[59:46] meet him in the air are you with
[59:49] me so the head is uniting with something
[59:52] and the may let us say this I'll say
[59:54] this right off the bat let us be glad
[59:56] and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb
[59:58] is come amen and his bride has made
[1:00:02] herself ready ready through what the
[1:00:06] word right for what purpose the wedding
[1:00:09] supper she is now in a Divine Union with
[1:00:15] her
[1:00:16] bridegroom
[1:00:21] right and it's and it's the the and and
[1:00:25] she's growing into one
[1:00:28] stature the
[1:00:30] head amen
[1:00:33] himself because she is
[1:00:36] himself in another form all
[1:00:41] right so I wonder did we see him go or
[1:00:44] come as he said he
[1:00:47] left certainly we
[1:00:50] have all right so in Matthew 6
[1:00:56] 16
[1:01:00] 28 verse I'll let's let's okay let's
[1:01:03] just turn to Matthew and you know I'm
[1:01:05] kind of walking here lightly because I
[1:01:08] want to just know that I have God's I
[1:01:11] want that will and I believe he has his
[1:01:14] will to speak here this
[1:01:16] morning very careful in what I'm reading
[1:01:18] here and the order that is being read
[1:01:23] in
[1:01:28] before I do this John 14 very familiar
[1:01:32] scripture let's go there John 14 and
[1:01:35] hold that spot in Matthew John
[1:01:46] 14 verse one let not your heart be
[1:01:48] troubled you believe in God believe also
[1:01:50] in me verse two in my father's house are
[1:01:53] many dwell Dwelling
[1:01:56] Places that's Mansions Dwelling Places
[1:01:59] my father's kingdom are many Dwelling
[1:02:02] Places or in my father's kingdom are
[1:02:04] many
[1:02:06] mansions are you with me all
[1:02:10] right if it were so if it were not so I
[1:02:14] would have told you I go to prepare a
[1:02:17] place for you and if I go and prepare a
[1:02:21] place for you I will come again amen and
[1:02:27] receive you unto
[1:02:30] myself what's happening
[1:02:33] bride what took place when the seals
[1:02:38] opened what was the third
[1:02:40] pull the opening of the word yes my word
[1:02:44] will not return to me void Isaiah 5511
[1:02:48] my word will not return to me void but
[1:02:50] it will accomplish what is set to do
[1:02:54] right
[1:02:55] and if you be that word heavens and
[1:02:57] earth will pass away but if you be that
[1:02:59] word you can't pass away
[1:03:02] either and he will not allow the word
[1:03:05] that you are to come to not but it will
[1:03:08] accomplish you will accomplish what
[1:03:10] you've been sent to
[1:03:13] do for whose works are you sent to do
[1:03:16] his you've been ordained these Works
[1:03:17] have been ordained before the foundation
[1:03:19] of the world Amen you come in Union with
[1:03:22] Jesus Christ and good works which he
[1:03:24] hath before ordained that you should
[1:03:27] walk in
[1:03:30] them whose
[1:03:32] Works he said he said if if I be in you
[1:03:36] the works that I do shall he do
[1:03:38] also then who is it doing the works
[1:03:42] Jesus said my father worketh hitherto
[1:03:44] and I work and without him I can do
[1:03:47] nothing is that
[1:03:50] right Hallelujah he said he would reveal
[1:03:54] him himself to you yes amen and show you
[1:03:57] and lead you and guide you into all
[1:03:59] truth and so the works that you're
[1:04:02] caring out by that spirit of God is not
[1:04:05] your works it's the works of
[1:04:10] God Amen why because you have his
[1:04:16] mind all right I'm I'm I'm floating off
[1:04:19] over here and I got to come
[1:04:21] back amen but because you have his mind
[1:04:24] you are
[1:04:28] spiritual and it's only the spiritual
[1:04:31] that are able to receive and to hear
[1:04:33] what is being said in this hour because
[1:04:36] he said my sheep right hear my voice and
[1:04:41] a stranger they can't follow for they do
[1:04:43] not know the voice of
[1:04:46] strangers they can't receive a strange
[1:04:49] voice how many know that through the
[1:04:51] years you kept hearing that strange
[1:04:53] voice but when you heard the real voice
[1:04:55] of God something in you said that's what
[1:04:58] I've been looking for yes
[1:05:02] sir why because you always were a part
[1:05:06] of God you always were the thought of
[1:05:09] God you always were that thought
[1:05:11] expressed you were in him from the
[1:05:14] beginning and now you're here to
[1:05:15] manifest and witness him in this hour
[1:05:18] and the day that you are meant to be
[1:05:20] here to recognize that portion of the
[1:05:23] word
[1:05:24] which is himself in fullness returning
[1:05:27] back for the body
[1:05:30] change to called up to what a wedding
[1:05:33] supper a celebration of a
[1:05:37] marriage amen am all right
[1:05:42] so we look here and said I will return I
[1:05:45] will I will if I go I will go and
[1:05:48] prepare a place and I if I go I'll come
[1:05:51] again and receive you unto myself how
[1:05:54] how is he going to receive
[1:05:56] you to
[1:05:58] himself by the opening of the
[1:06:01] word he's going to unveil himself
[1:06:04] completely to you he's kept it secret
[1:06:07] but now he comes in his complete
[1:06:08] Revelation and unveils himself to you
[1:06:11] and makes himself known to you and you
[1:06:13] see your position as himself in Bride
[1:06:18] form not another person it's the person
[1:06:23] not another Glory it's his
[1:06:26] glory you don't have another husband
[1:06:28] your maker Isaiah
[1:06:31] 544 said your 545 said your your maker
[1:06:35] is your
[1:06:37] husband amen and he will not sh share
[1:06:41] the Isaiah 4811 said he will not share
[1:06:44] his glory with
[1:06:46] another but we're coming to a scripture
[1:06:48] that shows us the bride is not
[1:06:52] another right amen she's him amen the
[1:06:58] same Glory that he's glorified with and
[1:07:00] has in himself he said I give to her I
[1:07:02] give to you
[1:07:05] amen I've got the scripture on that St
[1:07:07] John 17 it's
[1:07:09] there amen all right so let us go and
[1:07:12] find these great truths out
[1:07:15] here so he said that he said in in in
[1:07:18] let's go back over here to Matthew 16
[1:07:22] verse 28 verely I say unto you there be
[1:07:25] some standing here he took Peter James
[1:07:27] and John up into a mountain apart
[1:07:32] right separated apart what's he showing

[1:16:09] now I want you to go to Isaiah 59 with
[1:16:12] me I notice the kingdom of God is not a
[1:16:15] public
[1:16:20] show it's not known to the public
[1:16:31] amen Isaiah
[1:16:35] 59 verse
[1:16:37] 19 so there so they so shall they fear
[1:16:42] the name of the Lord from the West
[1:16:46] that's the Setting
[1:16:49] Sun and His
[1:16:52] glory from the rising of the
[1:16:56] sun it's
[1:16:59] East his glory from the
[1:17:03] rising while we're in that very moment
[1:17:06] there in Isaiah 53 you don't have to
[1:17:08] turn to this but in Isaiah 53 or 43
[1:17:11] excuse me it
[1:17:20] says I thought it was 43 here just a
[1:17:33] moment well maybe I'll come back to that
[1:17:36] I I guess I I wrote down the
[1:17:39] wrong um just a moment
[1:17:48] here no it's 435 I was right I think
[1:17:52] it's 43
[1:17:58] no
[1:18:01] no oh yes here it is fear not for I'm
[1:18:04] with thee I bring I will bring thy
[1:18:11] seed I will bring thy seed from the East
[1:18:15] rising and gather thee from the West
[1:18:19] amen that is right remember but in the
[1:18:22] evening time West it shall be light amen
[1:18:26] that's right Prophet stood up and said
[1:18:30] it is the rising of the Sun what
[1:18:36] again the seed coming from the East
[1:18:39] shall appear again shall come
[1:18:43] again
[1:18:45] amen all right so in the evening time it
[1:18:48] shall be
[1:18:51] light and from the East and gather thee
[1:18:54] from the West Gathering Gathering by
[1:18:58] what the coming of the Lord amen the
[1:19:03] word amen Paul said we are being
[1:19:05] gathered together by the coming of the
[1:19:07] Lord by the coming of the lord we are
[1:19:09] being
[1:19:11] gathered I will return again and receive
[1:19:15] you amen unto who that where I am there
[1:19:20] you may be also what if we didn't have
[1:19:22] the opening of those
[1:19:23] seals we couldn't be where he
[1:19:28] is amen all right
[1:19:32] so so back to Isaiah again 60 verse or
[1:19:37] 59 19 and His glory said I'll gather
[1:19:41] Fear Thy Name from the West and his
[1:19:43] glory from the rising of the his
[1:19:48] glory from the rising of the sun when
[1:19:51] the enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:19:54] spirit of the Lord the word of the Lord
[1:19:58] revealed the spirit of the Lord will
[1:20:01] lift up a standard against him and the
[1:20:04] prophet said are you one of
[1:20:10] them are you one of those standards that
[1:20:14] can't return to him void but will
[1:20:16] accomplish what is sent to do are you
[1:20:18] the
[1:20:21] word that's the standard that he raises
[1:20:25] up is the word and you the bride are the
[1:20:29] word living and in
[1:20:33] action
[1:20:35] amen you can't be anything else right
[1:20:40] that's who you
[1:20:42] are you receive his word for the season
[1:20:46] and the day you receive it today you
[1:20:48] recognize your position because you were
[1:20:51] always a part of him the
[1:20:54] word you couldn't deny the word you
[1:20:56] can't deny who yourself that eagle in
[1:20:58] the barnyard wasn't a chicken he was an
[1:21:00] eagle and he couldn't understand the
[1:21:02] cluck of the chicken but when the eagle
[1:21:04] screamed he came to recognize who he
[1:21:10] was because he was an eagle from the
[1:21:13] beginning you weren't a chicken from the
[1:21:15] beginning you weren't uh you weren't
[1:21:17] something else you were the word from
[1:21:19] the beginning you his thought you were
[1:21:21] his substance you were dwelling in him
[1:21:23] you were alive in him living in him and
[1:21:25] he expressed it when he did that he
[1:21:28] expressed himself and you are my
[1:21:33] Witnesses
[1:21:35] Hallelujah is that
[1:21:39] clear all right all right now so we find
[1:21:43] in verse 20 now or verse let's jump to
[1:21:46] verse verse one of chapter 60 and I just
[1:21:50] I'll have to bypass some of this because
[1:21:51] of the
[1:21:53] well verse 20 said the Redeemer shall
[1:21:55] come to Zion you know what Zion is in
[1:21:57] the Bible the bride and the Redeemer
[1:22:00] shall come to
[1:22:03] Zion
[1:22:04] amen and unto them that turn from
[1:22:07] transgression in Israel Jacob sayeth the
[1:22:12] Lord so how's he coming he's come again
[1:22:16] Oh Brother David now oh yeah yeah he's
[1:22:19] come again and he's coming we haven't
[1:22:22] come to the full climax of that coming
[1:22:24] because what we have received
[1:22:25] spiritually in faith will bring us to a
[1:22:27] full reality and
[1:22:30] realization are you with me it first has
[1:22:32] to be
[1:22:35] Faith always has been God's way he spoke
[1:22:38] the word by faith he created the worlds
[1:22:40] by faith then what took place when he
[1:22:43] did that that was the word of God and he
[1:22:45] created it by faith it wasn't something
[1:22:47] he just had a whim about it was
[1:22:49] substance in him and he put the
[1:22:51] substance into a word and the word
[1:22:53] became creation glory to
[1:22:57] God that's exactly what it
[1:23:00] is and so here he is today now verse 6
[1:23:06] chapter 60 verse1 then he saying to us
[1:23:12] arise
[1:23:14] shine you're the light of the world
[1:23:17] didn't Jesus say that in Matthew 5 ye
[1:23:20] are the light is there any ye in here ye

[1:42:44] the
[1:42:46] word the word's revealed to
[1:42:49] you
[1:42:51] amen then you say what he
[1:42:54] said you're not quoting what he said to
[1:42:57] Swiss people over in this assembly and
[1:42:59] bring them over here in this one and
[1:43:00] well bless God he said this and couldn't

[1:43:12] word the faith in the
[1:43:15] word all right amen now
[1:43:22] I get on those Trails I'm sorry but I
[1:43:24] have to just say what the holy spirit
[1:43:26] says to say so we're being gathered and
[1:43:29] don't be bothered or troubled by Spirit
[1:43:31] nor by word nor by letter as from us as
[1:43:35] that day of Christ is at hand at hand
[1:43:38] means look at if you have a skull field
[1:43:40] look at that little footnote B now
[1:43:43] present Lord right sir that's right
[1:43:47] that's the truth right some of his
[1:43:49] footnotes weren't necessarily truth but
[1:43:51] that's truth
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:57] absolutely all right so
[1:44:04] now and verse seven said for the mystery
[1:44:07] of iniquity do already work only he who
[1:44:10] now he Christ who now leth will let
[1:44:13] until he Christ the bride be taken out
[1:44:16] of the way how many know I'm quoting
[1:44:18] exactly what the prophet said there
[1:44:21] Hallelujah Christ
[1:44:23] who the
[1:44:25] bride so what's Israel waiting for her
[1:44:29] Queen to get out of the
[1:44:31] way is that right it's a maturity and
[1:44:34] we're growing into that maturity see we
[1:44:36] speak another language we speak a new
[1:44:39] tongue it's not the tongue of the earth
[1:44:42] no it's a spiritual tongue that the Holy
[1:44:45] Ghost reveals to us how can we know the
[1:44:46] things of the Holy Ghost except the Holy
[1:44:48] Ghost who wrote the word abides in you
[1:44:50] and if he abides in you then you're
[1:44:52] spiritual and the prophet said the
[1:44:55] spiritual will get
[1:44:57] it and how can you have the Holy Ghost
[1:44:59] in you if you weren't the seed to begin
[1:45:02] with if he planted in you that seed put
[1:45:05] it in there by predestination and
[1:45:06] planted it and you were here for this
[1:45:08] hour to hear that word he has to see to
[1:45:10] it that you hear the word and when you
[1:45:12] hear the word he has to see to it that
[1:45:14] it's revealed to you and was revealed to
[1:45:16] you he'll see to it that you work his
[1:45:18] work for it's all him
[1:45:21] it's all him did you hear me it's all
[1:45:24] him
[1:45:26] Hallelujah that's the
[1:45:28] gospel that's the grace of
[1:45:33] God you are the seed is the reason you
[1:45:35] could be birthed not everybody is birth
[1:45:38] repentance isn't birth neither is just
[1:45:41] just repentance I'm not saying you're
[1:45:44] not a Believer but repent be baptized
[1:45:46] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:45:48] Holy Ghost the gift of God is eternal
[1:45:51] life is that right the real gift is that
[1:45:54] Soul down in there that could hear the
[1:45:56] word and receive it there's the real
[1:45:58] gift there's eternal life you didn't put
[1:46:02] that there you had nothing to do with it
[1:46:04] there but when you heard the word
[1:46:06] preached in its power there's something
[1:46:07] inside of you that responded to that
[1:46:10] regardless of how you feel on the
[1:46:13] outward
[1:46:15] Lord is that truth or not truth is that
[1:46:18] right absolutely right
[1:46:22] all right now I got to go quickly
[1:46:25] through some of these things you bear
[1:46:26] with me can you bear with me about 15
[1:46:28] more minutes did that be all right I'm
[1:46:31] sorry I just haven't preached for three
[1:46:34] months preach
[1:46:38] brother but thank God I had opportunity
[1:46:41] and Tim and I both had opportunity to be
[1:46:42] with our mother
[1:46:44] am like we've never been before and my
[1:46:47] daddy's still living our daddy excuse me
[1:46:50] Tim I don't mean to do that it's not my
[1:46:52] or it's it's his
[1:46:57] too dad is Dad that's all he got a part
[1:47:00] of dad I don't have and I have a part of
[1:47:03] dad he don't have and mother
[1:47:06] too but we're manifesting one
[1:47:13] person good brother David I like
[1:47:16] that okay
[1:47:19] now
[1:47:23] so and a man that once walked into God
[1:47:27] and the veil drops behind him shutting
[1:47:29] off the things of the world he's in the
[1:47:31] presence of
[1:47:36] God and where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:47:39] there is Liberty is that right all right
[1:47:44] and the Lord is that
[1:47:46] spirit
[1:47:48] amen okay he's in the presence presence
[1:47:50] of God other words he's in the shakina
[1:47:52] of God all right eating Mana don't you
[1:47:57] love to eat Mana yes I do I love the
[1:48:02] word no wonder 12:00 9:00 or anything
[1:48:05] he's living in the presence of the king
[1:48:08] amen no wonder every day is fine for him
[1:48:11] see look where he's at he's found the
[1:48:13] secret place he's went behind the veil
[1:48:17] what a beautiful picture of the believer
[1:48:19] in the Pres presence of God all things
[1:48:23] are his then all things was given to
[1:48:27] Christ and who are
[1:48:30] you Christ what is Christ that kind of
[1:48:35] stumbles people doesn't it you think
[1:48:37] we're making us the the calvary man
[1:48:39] outward now I'm not saying that Christ
[1:48:41] is the word anointed right it's the seed
[1:48:44] of God quickened right and that
[1:48:47] quickened seed can only reveal Jesus
[1:48:50] Christ cuz he is Jesus Christ and if
[1:48:54] that seed that planted in you is birth
[1:48:56] that's the new birth in your soul it's
[1:48:57] not an outward birth of
[1:48:59] Flesh he that is born of the flesh is
[1:49:02] flesh but he that is born of the spirit
[1:49:05] is Spirit who
[1:49:09] spirit so who are you then see the real
[1:49:11] 's laying
[1:49:13] inside this will let go someday but that
[1:49:16] you has to go to a body that's been
[1:49:18] waiting for you is that right because if
[1:49:21] this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:49:23] have one waiting for us in the heavens
[1:49:26] that's right Eternal we have one waiting
[1:49:28] for us that's
[1:49:30] Eternal that's a theop called in the
[1:49:32] Bible theophany referred to a Greek I
[1:49:35] think it's a Greek word
[1:49:37] theophany okay but that's but then that
[1:49:40] theophany will someday go pick up the
[1:49:42] body they once lived
[1:49:44] in that that person see and then that
[1:49:47] body raises what's going to happen to it
[1:49:50] sin can't rise again it
[1:49:53] died is that right right it it it it
[1:49:56] finalized right there it'll Rise Again
[1:49:59] by the quickening power that quickened
[1:50:01] you to the word will Quicken that body
[1:50:04] to the
[1:50:05] Worden and it's got to come right back a
[1:50:08] young person then we'll eat then we'll
[1:50:11] build then we'll inhabit then we'll move
[1:50:13] out into Millennium there will'll dwell

[2:12:10] and through six there and it'll tell you
[2:12:13] about the Gathering and how we're
[2:12:14] gathered and etc etc verse
[2:12:17] 12
[2:12:21] verse 11 for this commandment which I
[2:12:23] command thee this day is not hidden from
[2:12:25] thee neither is it far off it is not in
[2:12:28] heaven that thou should us say who shall
[2:12:30] go up for us to heaven and bring it to
[2:12:32] us that we may hear it and do it neither
[2:12:34] is it beyond the sea that we should say
[2:12:37] who shall go over the sea for us and
[2:12:38] bring it unto us that we may hear it and
[2:12:41] do it notice hear it and do it but the

[2:13:22] to others let us die to self to reveal
[2:13:24] him to others let us die traditions and
[2:13:27] things to reveal him to other now
