[30:42] [Music]
[30:50] [Music]
[31:01] prepared for
[31:13] [Music]
[31:18] [Music]
[31:29] [Music]
[31:38] [Music]
[31:44] i
[31:58] can we say amen this morning hallelujah
[32:02] thank you lord amen
[32:07] you know just in our studies sometimes
[32:09] you just read a little quote here a
[32:11] little quote there
[32:12] and you don't use it but somehow it
[32:14] lodges in your mind and
[32:16] you know just thinking this morning
[32:18] about some quotes that i was studying a
[32:20] certain thought and
[32:22] you know brother branham's basically i'm
[32:24] gonna twist what he's
[32:25] saying just a smidge you know he's
[32:27] saying some people got confidence in
[32:29] their church
[32:31] got their anchor hook there some got
[32:34] confidence in their
[32:35] pastor and they've got their anchor hook
[32:37] there
[32:38] but i say this morning my brother and
[32:40] sister it's a revelation
[32:42] amen people say oh no we're anchored in
[32:45] jesus
[32:46] but we're nazarenes we are anchored in
[32:49] jesus but
[32:50] our pastor our church our and they've
[32:53] got
[32:53] i just want to be just completely
[32:55] anchored in jesus
[32:58] not don't want to be anchored in jesus
[33:00] plus
[33:02] something else amen just simply
[33:05] anchored in him amen
[33:08] maybe we'll i didn't go ahead and put it
[33:10] in this in my notes this morning but
[33:12] maybe we'll touch on it
[33:13] uh just uh i like to give credit where
[33:15] credit's due i don't want people to
[33:16] misunderstand
[33:18] uh but sometimes sister jerry as she's
[33:20] listening through
[33:21] the day will send me quotes and
[33:23] sometimes they're just profound and
[33:26] and uh as you look at that you know you
[33:28] just realize
[33:29] see the prophet of god even today we'll
[33:32] we'll read a quote and we get to it
[33:34] he's he's speaking of a nature i i'm
[33:37] saying something but i'm not
[33:39] saying it but i want you to get it
[33:43] now why would he not just
[33:46] say it because it wasn't for everyone
[33:52] it needed an anointing of the holy
[33:54] spirit to speak to
[33:56] that individual and when the anointing
[34:00] of the holy spirit speaks to that
[34:01] individual it brings it to light
[34:05] right i mean how many of you we look at
[34:09] be baptized in the name of the father
[34:11] and the son
[34:12] and the holy spirit
[34:17] be baptized in the name of the lord
[34:20] jesus christ
[34:22] see once that's opened to us
[34:26] we read that and we look at that and
[34:28] it's like yes
[34:30] there's no conflict this is the same
[34:33] exact
[34:34] words but without revelation
[34:38] without revelation people are like nope
[34:40] we're either over here or we're over
[34:42] here
[34:42] sorry i can take both i can take both
[34:45] because the word
[34:47] has revealed the content
[34:50] or the intent amen we recognize that
[34:53] glad today hallelujah amen
[34:57] well let's just stand and go right into
[34:58] the word i just want to
[35:00] speak to you this morning in the season
[35:02] that our potential
[35:04] is expressed now we look at this my
[35:08] brother and sister
[35:09] um so so many things tied together and
[35:12] god help us the lord help us to to do
[35:15] this
[35:16] because when i say tangent i don't
[35:18] believe anything that you would vain
[35:20] that you would go off into the word as a
[35:21] tangent
[35:22] but uh sometimes it's very easy to start
[35:25] in a thought and
[35:26] you get to a certain point and and you
[35:28] go
[35:31] and then after a while you're like now
[35:32] what was we talking about
[35:35] but it it's just so beautiful amen it's
[35:38] so connected together
[35:40] hallelujah uh let's just turn to
[35:42] revelations 19
[35:44] and 1. um it is good to be in the house
[35:47] of the lord
[35:48] with each one of you and uh those that
[35:50] are missing from our presence i just
[35:53] thinking of brother bob and sister
[35:55] joanne
[35:56] amen how many are thankful for coven
[36:01] now come on saints now look
[36:04] i want you to look at this for a second
[36:07] on one side we stand over here and we
[36:09] say
[36:10] we believe the holy spirit can keep
[36:13] us from any disease any trouble any
[36:16] pestilence
[36:18] hallelujah but god opened the heads to
[36:22] job
[36:24] hallelujah and praise the lord
[36:27] those of you that never were affected we
[36:30] are certainly envious
[36:34] but praise the lord those of us that got
[36:36] sicker than
[36:37] sick amen we're not in a hospital we're
[36:40] not on a ventilator we're not on the
[36:42] death's door
[36:44] hallelujah i don't know how people want
[36:46] to interpret that but i'll tell you
[36:48] to me it's just the same as never having
[36:51] got it
[36:51] in the first place because god's hand
[36:54] come down
[36:56] brother sergey as we were texting i
[36:59] don't know
[37:00] time flies back a ways i was like
[37:02] brother how are you feeling

[37:05] the work therapy method

[37:11] got up he went and did it
[37:13] well i can tell you that sister jerry
[37:15] and i went
[37:18] down to mountain home we kind of
[37:19] committed ourselves to a deal there and
[37:22] we got up way before the sun ever rose
[37:24] at night we didn't stop working till the
[37:26] sun had already set
[37:28] and i thought oh my what have i got
[37:30] myself into and i thought yes
[37:32] brother sergey thank you amen work
[37:35] therapy
[37:37] hallelujah i'm going to get up in the
[37:38] morning god's going to give me strength
[37:40] to make it through this day
[37:42] and i'm not going to think about it any
[37:44] other way it's not woe unto me
[37:46] i can do this i can do all things
[37:49] through christ jesus
[37:51] amen hallelujah revelations 19
[37:54] 1-9 you know as time goes on i love this
[37:57] scripture
[37:58] more and more after these things i heard
[38:02] a great voice of much people in heaven
[38:04] saying hallelujah
[38:05] salvation and glory and honor and power
[38:09] unto the lord are god
[38:10] for true and righteous are his judgment
[38:14] for he hath judged the great which
[38:16] did corrupt the earth with
[38:18] her fornication and hath avenged the
[38:20] blood of his servants at her hand
[38:23] and again they said alleluia and her
[38:25] smoke rose up
[38:26] forever and ever and the four and twenty
[38:30] elders and the four beasts fell down
[38:32] and worshiped god that set on the throne
[38:34] saying amen
[38:36] hallelujah and a voice came out of the
[38:38] throne saying
[38:39] praise our god all ye his servants
[38:42] and ye that fear him both small and
[38:45] great
[38:46] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[38:48] great multitude
[38:50] hallelujah amen that's my hallelujah
[38:54] and as a voice of many waters the voice
[38:56] of a mighty thundering saying hallelujah
[38:59] for the lord
[39:00] god omnipotent reigneth can we say that
[39:03] this morning
[39:04] for the lord our god omnipotent
[39:08] reigneth amen we got nothing to fear
[39:10] saints
[39:12] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[39:15] honor to him
[39:16] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[39:19] and his wife hath made herself ready
[39:23] oh you know i don't like that maybe it's
[39:25] a little complex to be redundant i feel
[39:28] like oh i just keep
[39:29] but my brother and sister there is much
[39:31] more in this
[39:32] that the fact that his wife hath made
[39:35] herself ready
[39:36] that means she completely believed
[39:41] he told her there was not a doubt
[39:45] not a delay not a procrastination
[39:48] not a maybe for some future time but she
[39:51] completely
[39:52] believed what she heard
[39:55] said i'm going to get up and i'm going
[39:57] to make myself
[39:58] ready you know i don't want to throw
[40:01] sister jerry under the bus but she made
[40:03] a statement that she might not even
[40:04] remember
[40:05] making while we were in mountain home
[40:07] working she was she was sick
[40:09] her bones hurt she just whatever we
[40:11] slept terribly et cetera et cetera
[40:14] and one morning i rousted her and i said
[40:16] honey
[40:17] get up fix me breakfast and she said i
[40:19] don't want to
[40:23] but because i love you
[40:26] i will hallelujah
[40:30] this old flesh sometimes saints just
[40:32] doesn't want to push back again
[40:35] well to see you this old flesh sometimes
[40:38] just wants to go
[40:39] with the flow this old flesh
[40:42] sometimes is just like i have not enough
[40:45] strength
[40:46] to even resist the spirit of laodicea
[40:50] oh but lord because i love you

[41:07] oh hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice
[41:10] and give honor to him for the marriage
[41:12] of the lamb has come
[41:14] and his wife right she's identified
[41:17] his wife hath made herself ready and to
[41:21] her
[41:21] was granted that she should be arrayed
[41:24] in fine linen
[41:25] clean and white for the fine linen is
[41:28] the righteousness
[41:30] of saints oh my goodness
[41:34] i read this saints in my heart just
[41:36] burst
[41:37] god granted us this
[41:40] just happened it didn't just kind of
[41:43] oh look what fell our way
[41:47] god granted that you
[41:50] and i could partake of his righteousness
[41:54] rapping ourself amen
[41:58] reminds me of a little deal that i read
[42:01] this
[42:02] people were famous they were rich
[42:05] and this woman she was quite discerning
[42:08] in a way for probably worldly people
[42:11] and she started searching for a wedding
[42:14] dress
[42:16] and they had her and i don't mean to be
[42:18] crass forgive me
[42:20] but they had her in these skimpy sexy
[42:23] wedding dresses lots of flesh showing
[42:28] she didn't say no i'm a christian i
[42:29] don't wear that right but there was
[42:31] something inside there
[42:33] she said this is a special day the only
[42:36] time in my life
[42:38] that i'm going to get married
[42:41] i don't want to look like that
[42:44] and they come with another style of
[42:46] dress and another style of dress and
[42:48] another style of dress and another style
[42:50] of dress
[42:51] and one day a friend of hers says hey
[42:55] i know a young woman not very well known
[42:58] she's not famous
[43:02] but you ought to give her a chance let
[43:03] her show you what she thinks you ought
[43:06] to look like
[43:09] oh saints you just think about my
[43:11] thought
[43:12] you'll catch and this young woman comes
[43:14] in there and here again i'm not beating
[43:16] crass but
[43:17] she just has the lady basically in her
[43:19] undergarments
[43:20] don't need anything else here and she
[43:22] starts in with this
[43:23] silk that was some something silk from a
[43:26] certain
[43:26] silkworm in india that was it was
[43:29] extravagant
[43:30] it was expensive but it was also
[43:33] sensuous in the sense that it was so
[43:35] fine it was so
[43:36] soft it was so and she took the whole
[43:39] bolt of cloth and she says where is the
[43:41] dress
[43:42] she held up the whole bolt of cloth and
[43:44] said
[43:45] right here and she started to wrap it
[43:49] around her
[43:50] she brought it up here and she fluffed
[43:52] it here and she wrapped it there
[43:55] and when she was finished she was
[43:58] covered
[43:59] from head to toe in this fine linen
[44:03] yes sir and she says now bring a mirror
[44:07] and when she saw herself
[44:10] oh when she saw herself she said this
[44:14] is what i want to be married in i look
[44:17] like a lady i look like a queen
[44:22] i look regal yes sir
[44:26] oh hallelujah it's an interesting story
[44:29] because you see it just been draped
[44:31] around the lady
[44:32] now the young woman when she said this
[44:34] is what i want she had to somehow tack
[44:35] it all together to make a dress out of
[44:37] it
[44:38] but you see that's what the preaching of
[44:39] the word has done
[44:41] it's taken the grace of god's word and
[44:43] it's wrapped it around this and around
[44:45] us and around us
[44:46] but when we start to walk into the
[44:48] marriage supper it doesn't fall off of
[44:50] us
[44:51] amen we have become the word we are
[44:54] wrapped in the word we are the word
[44:56] hallelujah i hope you catch a gist of
[44:58] that story i cut a lot of details out
[45:00] but that woman it was there what was it
[45:03] just
[45:04] fine linen that's what she was clothed
[45:07] in
[45:08] she didn't have to expose herself
[45:10] express herself project herself
[45:12] she just allowed the beauty of the linen
[45:16] that she was wrapped in to become her
[45:18] beauty
[45:20] hallelujah and he saith unto me blessed
[45:23] are they which
[45:24] are called i heard that call unto the
[45:27] marriage supper of the lamb and he saith
[45:29] unto me these are the true sayings
[45:31] of god heavenly father we just asked
[45:33] lord today that you would just speak to
[45:35] us
[45:36] lord you know my heart's desire as i
[45:38] come behind this pulpit each and every
[45:40] time
[45:41] lord let us only speak your word correct
[45:44] us
[45:45] silence us lord anything that would be
[45:48] our own thought or contrary
[45:50] lord bind it and loose the word
[45:54] father to your sons and daughters
[45:57] loose the word to us lord the very words
[46:00] of life that change us
[46:02] that draws forth it bring forth the
[46:06] expression of who we really are truly
[46:09] are called to be we thank you for this
[46:13] day lord and those that are not with us
[46:14] for whatever purpose
[46:17] may your holy spirit deal with them
[46:20] lord go out to them touch their hearts
[46:23] stir
[46:23] them father lord the time is drawing
[46:27] nigh
[46:28] we ask now for your blessings for your
[46:30] purpose to be manifested in the name of
[46:32] jesus christ
[46:34] amen you may be seated
[46:43] all i can say is this morning saints
[46:45] just say a quick prayer that the lord
[46:47] would just help us to stay on our
[46:48] thought
[46:49] amen as it would be coming
[46:54] to a great intersection that has many
[46:57] many avenues we
[46:58] just pray this morning to follow the
[47:01] avenue that the lord
[47:02] desires for us revelations 1 and 19
[47:07] verse 20 also we look at this he says
[47:10] now at this is this is the start my
[47:12] brother and sister not really the start
[47:14] but it
[47:15] it it is the beginning of the expression
[47:18] that god give to uh john as he is here
[47:22] this book of revelation not revelations
[47:25] amen not a multitude of it but it's one
[47:28] continuous connected
[47:29] revelation this is why my brother and
[47:32] sister
[47:33] you know not to belabor it but just to
[47:35] put this when god opened the six seals
[47:38] if he had left the seventh seal undone
[47:41] which was redemption according to the
[47:43] prophet amen the coming of the lord if
[47:45] he left that undone
[47:47] then we would have a a avenue that we
[47:50] would come to and we simply wouldn't
[47:52] know which way to turn
[47:54] but by god's grace he opens these things
[47:56] up he connects it together
[47:58] do we always uh understand it can we
[48:01] always explain it like some kind of
[48:03] theologian
[48:04] no my brother and sister but something
[48:06] stirs in your heart
[48:08] that you realize you know what god was
[48:10] talking to me
[48:11] now the problem we have in the message
[48:14] is people
[48:15] believe that god was speaking to the
[48:18] whole multitude
[48:19] my brother and sister he calls a church
[48:21] out a people out of the church
[48:24] amen the church will have a revelation
[48:26] they'll be rejoicing
[48:27] sing and shout and say thank you lord
[48:30] but
[48:31] that group of people that was called out
[48:34] heard
[48:34] something more than the rest of the
[48:36] group amen
[48:38] now does that make you and i special as
[48:40] some kind of uh
[48:42] you know big headed intellectual kind of
[48:44] people
[48:45] no it doesn't what it does is causes us
[48:47] to rejoice
[48:49] that even though i cannot explain it
[48:51] amen and you couldn't go find it i'm not
[48:53] speaking from paul here
[48:55] the prophet of god talks about this amen
[48:58] now see
[48:58] these things cannot be taught but yet we
[49:01] come to church and by the preaching of
[49:03] the word we are taught
[49:05] but yet we cannot teach the revelation
[49:08] of jesus christ
[49:09] it is a revelation it is god himself
[49:13] coming
[49:14] many times in our darkest hours many
[49:16] times
[49:17] in the desolate places and god dealing
[49:20] with us and
[49:21] opening himself to us revealing himself
[49:24] and as we would look at this and realize
[49:27] what god is doing
[49:28] he he comes and and as revelation 1 19
[49:32] he says write the things which thou has
[49:34] seen so john has seen something
[49:36] and it's there he's now following now
[49:39] look my brother and sister
[49:40] god would have never revealed this to
[49:42] john if john wasn't
[49:44] an obedient servant many people would
[49:46] say well praise the lord i've got a
[49:48] revelation the lord spoke to me
[49:50] and i'm going to do this but it's
[49:51] contrary to the word of god look you
[49:54] don't even have to go pray
[49:55] and labor over what to do or what to
[49:58] follow
[49:58] if it doesn't line up with the word then
[50:01] it's simply
[50:02] something that somebody's just speaking
[50:04] they might be anointed they might feel
[50:06] that it come from god
[50:07] they might feel it's a direction to go
[50:10] you just go study the word of god the
[50:12] prophet of god just saying and i'm
[50:13] trying not to preach another thought
[50:14] here
[50:15] but when makeo was dealing with you know
[50:17] they said throw him in the deepest of
[50:19] prisons
[50:19] and he and we'll deal with him when we
[50:21] come back and he just oh
[50:23] was he a rebel was he mouthy no but when
[50:26] he spoke up he said look if you come
[50:27] back at all i'm false
[50:30] amen because there comes a time that the
[50:32] word must be
[50:33] anchored the prophet of god said the
[50:35] nail must be
[50:37] clenched amen we're in that hour saints
[50:41] no longer just a random message where
[50:43] hey god sent a prophet
[50:45] oh hallelujah we might throw one at you
[50:47] at the end of the service here depending
[50:48] on what the lord leads
[50:50] but look at this now revelations 19
[50:52] write the things which i'll have seen
[50:54] the things which
[50:55] are and the things which shall be
[50:58] hereafter
[50:59] so the past the present the future
[51:03] was all laid out in a great cinematic
[51:06] uh view before john where he saw these
[51:09] things happen
[51:10] now look my brother and sister this does
[51:12] not mean that john had a complete
[51:13] revelation of what he saw
[51:15] but god chose to use him as the master
[51:19] penman
[51:20] uh uh to to write out what was happening
[51:24] you see my brother and sister if you
[51:25] wonder about the presence i was asked
[51:27] one time
[51:28] do you feel like that that today is uh
[51:31] greater or more or something you know
[51:34] it's a message
[51:35] uh greater than paul's message or you
[51:37] know it was kind of a convoluted
[51:39] question
[51:40] and they were looking for just a yes or
[51:42] no well my brother and sister i'll tell
[51:44] you
[51:44] i believe that we are in right now the
[51:47] greatest time
[51:49] in history and you say well you mean
[51:51] greater than even when the prophet was
[51:53] on the scene yeah i believe
[51:54] actually greater than when the prophet
[51:56] was on the scene oh i can hear him go
[51:59] i've got him there he's fault no my
[52:01] brother and sister you see the things
[52:03] that the prophet spoke
[52:04] had to come to pass and we are now in
[52:07] the season that is coming to pass
[52:10] and so we are seeing now is a is the
[52:13] manifestation of a prophecy greater
[52:16] than the prophecy itself i believe it is
[52:20] because if there's no manifestation of
[52:22] the prophecy
[52:23] then we're doing but when the prophecy
[52:25] comes to pass
[52:27] you are recognizing that the power was
[52:30] placed
[52:30] in the spoken word and it was spoken
[52:34] forth by a man of god
[52:37] amen what if no more power touches that
[52:44] prophecy
[52:47] you see then the prophecy becomes now be
[52:49] careful here
[52:50] that's right the prophecy if never
[52:54] fulfilled
[52:56] was literally a waste of time
[53:02] i want you to think about that seems
[53:04] like a pretty direct statement to make
[53:05] right
[53:06] a prophecy unfulfilled was a waste of
[53:08] time
[53:09] amen now don't start looking through
[53:13] there saying well we haven't seen this
[53:14] we haven't seen this we haven't seen
[53:15] this
[53:16] because there's things happening on this
[53:18] earth right now my brother and sister
[53:19] that you and i have not a clue about
[53:23] there are things happening that is
[53:25] bringing about the word
[53:27] of god that you and i may never know
[53:29] things close behind
[53:31] doors of important places of government
[53:35] and of religions and whatever that we
[53:37] will never see
[53:38] but if we are aware of what the prophecy
[53:42] said would happen
[53:43] you don't need every detail and what the
[53:46] problem is is we've got detail
[53:48] finders they're not looking for the
[53:51] finished work they're looking for
[53:53] details
[53:54] i've got to have details well i'll tell
[53:57] you what my brother and sister
[53:58] i'm just looking for the finished work
[54:00] amen the word of god said that these
[54:02] things would come to pass
[54:04] before the coming of the lord amen i'm
[54:07] not concerned about what president's in
[54:09] office
[54:10] what beautiful woman supposed to fulfill
[54:12] this what religion is supposed to do
[54:13] this
[54:14] i'm looking to the finished work and
[54:16] that finished work
[54:17] is not even taking place on the earth
[54:20] for you and i
[54:21] because we're not earthly creatures it's
[54:24] taking place
[54:25] hallelujah the marriage supper of the
[54:27] lamb
[54:28] amen the time and the place we stand
[54:30] before the throne
[54:31] and we worship the millennium which we
[54:33] get to praise him for a thousand years
[54:36] and walk out on the ashes of the wicked
[54:38] and people are worried about whether
[54:40] this little thing here
[54:41] who's a beautiful woman well they fought
[54:44] this person
[54:45] and they prophesied of this and they
[54:47] said of that
[54:48] my brother and sister why just a waste
[54:51] of time
[54:52] the prophet of god told us in so many
[54:54] words don't get sidetracked
[54:57] that's right don't get sidetracked
[55:02] in the mysteries of the seven stars
[55:04] which sauced in my right hand
[55:07] and the seven golden candlesticks and
[55:09] the seven stars are the angels of the
[55:11] seven churches
[55:12] and the seven candlesticks which thou
[55:14] saust are
[55:15] the seven churches now you'll notice
[55:18] here my brother and sister i just want
[55:19] to throw this in maybe a future topic
[55:22] you'll see here that there is only seven
[55:24] stars
[55:26] amen there's not seven and a half
[55:29] there's not eight there's not six
[55:32] there's seven amen now we're either very
[55:36] confused and in the wrong
[55:38] message if we believe that we need an
[55:41] eighth
[55:42] that's right come on
[55:46] we believe we need something plus
[55:50] oh my brother and sister the prophet of
[55:52] god now we i don't want to get
[55:54] sidetracked but
[55:54] but he's when my work here is finished
[55:58] the lord will take me home
[56:02] so i've got a prophet that didn't get
[56:03] his job done he's got to come back
[56:06] no come on thanks and i'm not trying to
[56:08] be facetious i'm not trying to pick at
[56:10] somebody
[56:11] i'm just telling you seven angels to the
[56:14] seven
[56:14] churches and god took the messenger home
[56:17] when the work
[56:18] was complete hallelujah
[56:21] but you say we're still here that's
[56:23] right that means he
[56:24] has deposited everything
[56:28] we need to finish this life
[56:32] hallelujah everything we need don't need
[56:34] not someone
[56:35] now are we still finding nuggets out of
[56:37] the message i'm not talking about that
[56:39] we are finding nuggets out of the
[56:41] message we are making the connections
[56:44] hallelujah but we don't have to come
[56:46] with a new revelation
[56:48] amen and so as god works in our lives
[56:51] and this is opened up to us
[56:53] amen we are able by god's grace here
[56:55] again
[56:56] i'm not one of these people that so much
[56:58] oh got the revelation got the revelation
[57:00] but it needs to be a revelation to you
[57:03] that you
[57:03] were called hallelujah that you can i
[57:07] say it again
[57:08] you need that revelation that you were
[57:11] called
[57:12] it wasn't an accident it wasn't a
[57:15] happenstance
[57:16] god called you to the marriage supper of
[57:18] the lamb
[57:19] hallelujah amen blessed are they which
[57:23] are
[57:23] called oh hallelujah
[57:27] amen now i want to just backtrack just a
[57:29] moment this morning
[57:31] amen revelation 18 we won't put it up on
[57:33] the screen or anything
[57:34] but i want you to see right before
[57:36] revelation 19 which is talking about the
[57:38] marriage of the lamb
[57:40] revelation 18 17 18 is moving here
[57:44] and what we're seeing there in those
[57:46] chapters
[57:47] is a uh judgment
[57:50] on the whole babylonian system now many
[57:52] people would say no that that was the
[57:54] roman catholic church well okay you can
[57:57] put it right down to that but you've got
[57:59] to understand the church is only
[58:01] the physical manifestation of the spirit
[58:04] behind it
[58:05] amen so what you would say oh we go to
[58:08] rome and that that's that
[58:09] my brother and sister yes of course
[58:11] seven hills so many things scripturally
[58:13] it all ties together
[58:15] but you have to understand it's the
[58:17] spirit and you go through the message
[58:19] here again we're not going to sign
[58:20] track into these things the prophet of
[58:22] god clearly shows us
[58:23] that spirit is not confined within the
[58:26] roman catholic church
[58:28] amen in fact in one place brother
[58:29] branham says that it's a spirit of
[58:31] denominationalism
[58:32] amen that's the babylonian spirit so
[58:35] what would the babylonian garment look
[58:37] like
[58:38] amen it would be the garment of
[58:40] denomination
[58:41] amen well hallelujah we're not talking
[58:44] about baptist this morning or methodist
[58:46] this morning
[58:46] we're talking about the message amen
[58:48] we're talking about where people have
[58:50] put on that garment
[58:51] and if you're not part of our place
[58:53] right here you're not part of this group
[58:56] or
[58:56] our little system around the world then
[58:58] then you're not in at all
[59:00] well i'm sorry i just don't see that in
[59:01] the scriptures you're talking about the
[59:03] body of believers
[59:05] unless you're talking about that body of
[59:07] christ which makes up that glorified
[59:10] body around the earth amen
[59:12] from every nation kindred tongue so as
[59:15] we look at that and realize that this
[59:16] babylonian spirit
[59:18] is coming down now revelation 18 is
[59:21] speaking very directly
[59:22] uh if you haven't read it in a while
[59:24] just read it remind yourself of
[59:27] how direct god is speaking and the
[59:30] bringing of judgment
[59:31] it's speaking about how that this system
[59:33] has been judged
[59:34] and this system has been found guilty
[59:37] amen
[59:38] so that spirit that babylonian spirit
[59:41] when it causes one now catch this here
[59:44] when it causes one to exit
[59:46] the word amen
[59:50] imagine as though the word
[59:55] is your little room the prophet of god
[59:56] was talking about amen amen
[1:00:01] now look i i don't want to get in deep
[1:00:03] and i don't want to be controversial
[1:00:04] with you
[1:00:06] but that little room my brother and
[1:00:07] sister you
[1:00:09] study it in a spiritual sense and you
[1:00:11] pray over it
[1:00:12] revelation of jesus christ
[1:00:16] was inside that room amen
[1:00:24] and they walked out what happened in
[1:00:26] there
[1:00:27] well be honest with you i really don't
[1:00:29] know
[1:00:31] i walked in there in this condition
[1:00:34] follow this i walked in there in this
[1:00:36] condition and i walked out
[1:00:38] a brand new man i walked out a brand new
[1:00:42] creature in christ jesus amen
[1:00:46] it wasn't an indoctrination
[1:00:50] it wasn't an impersonation
[1:00:53] it was a revelation amen
[1:00:57] and what was that that was god coming
[1:00:59] down right into this sacred
[1:01:01] heart place that he has reserved in the
[1:01:03] hearts of sons and daughters of god
[1:01:05] now you can look at these things my
[1:01:07] brother and sister and say well we're
[1:01:08] looking for a a more
[1:01:10] uh uh uh natural uh understanding
[1:01:14] well for the sake of time this morning
[1:01:15] i'll just have to let you uh
[1:01:17] just follow with my words uh but they
[1:01:20] are there in the message
[1:01:21] the prophet of god turned it around he
[1:01:24] says well now we
[1:01:25] see these natural manifestations
[1:01:28] he said where the natural manifestation
[1:01:31] is
[1:01:31] there must be a spiritual amen
[1:01:38] well you see the churches you see the
[1:01:40] world you see groups you see things
[1:01:42] coming together
[1:01:44] i don't harp on it be redundant that
[1:01:47] word
[1:01:47] is redundant but my brother and sisters
[1:01:51] you see
[1:01:52] we don't need to create our own unity
[1:01:54] the word is bringing
[1:01:55] unity the word is bringing the bride of
[1:01:59] christ
[1:02:00] in unity oh get this now i might catch
[1:02:03] flack on this i don't really care
[1:02:05] the word of god is not bringing me
[1:02:09] in unity with you
[1:02:12] it's not bringing me in unity with you
[1:02:16] or you or you the word of god
[1:02:20] is bringing you and i in unity with
[1:02:23] christ
[1:02:24] the word and when we are brought
[1:02:27] into unity with christ the word then we
[1:02:30] have unity
[1:02:32] amen we can't have anything else
[1:02:35] but the unity or the love of god
[1:02:39] perfect love if we are in unity with
[1:02:42] christ
[1:02:43] we can endeavor to be in unity with one
[1:02:45] another
[1:02:46] and there will always be some little
[1:02:49] friction
[1:02:54] like an individual that visited our
[1:02:55] house recently as they were leaving for
[1:02:57] the evening said i don't know about this
[1:02:59] brother paul every time i come to your
[1:03:00] house i step on a goat head
[1:03:06] how many times have you stepped on the
[1:03:07] go head lately
[1:03:12] maybe that was just a reminder there's
[1:03:14] no perfect world
[1:03:17] sorry we don't like our goat heads
[1:03:20] either
[1:03:22] i don't like my badger nature
[1:03:26] either i don't like my
[1:03:29] my myself
[1:03:33] amen but when we become one so much with
[1:03:36] the word
[1:03:38] i can look oh praise the lord now don't
[1:03:41] take this judgmental
[1:03:42] but i can look past your faults i can
[1:03:45] look past your back your skin
[1:03:47] because i'm looking to christ and i
[1:03:51] see christ in you so i can't see the
[1:03:54] badger skin
[1:03:56] that's it
[1:03:59] that's why in the natural we will never
[1:04:02] find a
[1:04:03] unity that they're searching for
[1:04:06] in the body of believers because
[1:04:09] until we only see christ
[1:04:12] we will see each other
[1:04:16] and i don't like some of your habits
[1:04:21] oh was that your thoughts being
[1:04:22] telegraphed to me
[1:04:24] or was that mine being telegraphed to
[1:04:26] you
[1:04:28] it's a circuit come on saints there we
[1:04:31] should
[1:04:31] we should be able to have a tad bit of
[1:04:33] humor in our life
[1:04:35] come on you all if you'd be honest would
[1:04:37] lift a hand today and say brother paul
[1:04:38] you've said things and done things we
[1:04:40] didn't like
[1:04:42] come on some of you be honest with
[1:04:43] yourself
[1:04:46] yeah come on the rest of you know i'm
[1:04:48] telling the truth
[1:04:50] well hallelujah if i had a mirror big
[1:04:53] enough to cover the sanctuary you could
[1:04:55] just look right back
[1:04:57] amen but you see that babylonian spirit
[1:05:01] causes one to exit if you can envision
[1:05:06] amen it causes one to
[1:05:09] exit the word because as long as you
[1:05:13] stay
[1:05:14] inside of the word the prophet of god
[1:05:15] said satan can't get to you
[1:05:18] so we got to exit outside of the word
[1:05:21] for that babylonian spirit
[1:05:23] and that spirit gets on people and they
[1:05:25] say well i i just won't be a part of
[1:05:27] this i won't be a part of that i don't
[1:05:29] like this i don't
[1:05:30] agree with that okay fine whatever just
[1:05:32] make sure you stay with the word
[1:05:36] amen well praise the lord now this had
[1:05:39] always come
[1:05:40] around like a person is speaking highly
[1:05:42] of himself
[1:05:43] and i don't mean it that way but if
[1:05:46] you're staying with the word and you're
[1:05:47] saying with the word and you're staying
[1:05:48] with the word and you're staying with
[1:05:49] the word
[1:05:50] and we disagree whether it's apple pie
[1:05:52] or cherry pie i use that as a simple
[1:05:53] thing
[1:05:54] yeah do you know that sooner or later
[1:05:57] you're going to bump into me or i'm
[1:05:58] going to bump into you
[1:06:00] because if we're in the word that's
[1:06:03] right regardless of some little
[1:06:05] difference that we have
[1:06:07] we never exited the word are you
[1:06:10] following me
[1:06:11] we will come back together and our
[1:06:14] differences
[1:06:15] will be dealt with because we are in the
[1:06:19] word
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] but when we are in isms
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:28] so when the babylonian spirit causes one
[1:06:30] to exit the word
[1:06:31] god will not judge them without warning
[1:06:33] that's right
[1:06:34] i want you to think about this god will
[1:06:36] not judge them without warning that's
[1:06:38] right
[1:06:39] now i want to just bounce back to
[1:06:42] uh what i preached the other day and not
[1:06:45] on the same
[1:06:46] thought or whatever but speaking of
[1:06:47] abraham
[1:06:49] and lot you see
[1:06:52] back when he was still abram he had a
[1:06:54] directive of god to leave
[1:06:56] all of his kindred he had he had a word
[1:07:01] from god
[1:07:02] to move or separate himself
[1:07:05] and yet god in his infinite mercy and
[1:07:07] grace aren't you don't you just love his
[1:07:09] infinite mercy and grace
[1:07:11] amen so what happens abram he just can't
[1:07:14] quite bring himself
[1:07:15] to that place now i hope you see the big
[1:07:17] picture this morning
[1:07:18] abram can't quite bring himself to just
[1:07:21] pack up and leave his
[1:07:22] nephew maybe he felt uh responsible for
[1:07:25] him
[1:07:26] you know that he was too young too
[1:07:28] moldable too influenceable
[1:07:29] that he needed to kind of guard him and
[1:07:32] god in his grace and mercy doesn't slap
[1:07:34] abram down and say look i told you boy
[1:07:36] but what he does is he allows this
[1:07:39] this word that was given to him to
[1:07:41] separate himself
[1:07:42] it allows him to step outside of that
[1:07:45] word
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:50] and go for a season amen
[1:07:54] and what did he do he faced all the
[1:07:57] trouble
[1:07:58] of a mixed multitude he faced
[1:08:02] all the trouble of the three kinds of
[1:08:04] believers
[1:08:06] he faced all of the trouble of not doing
[1:08:10] all of god's word
[1:08:15] amen i love this part right here because
[1:08:18] it's so painful
[1:08:20] sometimes i want to sit down and just
[1:08:22] cry
[1:08:25] god allowed abram
[1:08:29] i just like to refer to him as abraham
[1:08:31] because that's really who he is
[1:08:33] amen that's who he was he had one name
[1:08:35] god gave him another
[1:08:36] amen sister sarah i was thinking about
[1:08:38] you about six o'clock this morning
[1:08:40] i'm just reading there where the prophet
[1:08:42] of god is talking about changed her name
[1:08:44] from sarai
[1:08:45] to sarah the name of a princess
[1:08:49] hallelujah i thought praise the lord
[1:08:52] sister sarah and look i'll just throw a
[1:08:53] rose out to you
[1:08:54] i believe you're a princess amen
[1:08:57] hallelujah
[1:08:58] but you look at this my brother and
[1:09:00] sister what happened was
[1:09:01] is god just allows him to go on
[1:09:05] until abraham is like lord
[1:09:09] i need a separation lord i need to get
[1:09:14] away
[1:09:15] i need to get away from this lord
[1:09:18] amen hallelujah i'll tell you what
[1:09:22] happens many of us that struggled with
[1:09:23] things
[1:09:24] in our life through the years past god
[1:09:28] let you get so sick and tired of being
[1:09:30] sick and tired of sick and tired of sick
[1:09:32] and tired of sick and tired of sick and
[1:09:33] tired
[1:09:34] until you begged god to deliver you
[1:09:38] amen god didn't come and slap down the
[1:09:41] ultimatum
[1:09:43] amen we'll mark you like a thief in the
[1:09:45] abrab world and we'll cut a hand off and
[1:09:47] everybody will know you have unbelief
[1:09:49] god didn't do that god let us go until
[1:09:52] we come to the place that we're like
[1:09:54] lord
[1:09:55] i'm so sick of my condition
[1:09:58] lord help me lord help me
[1:10:02] yes sir amen amen
[1:10:08] i don't know about you but i'm ready for
[1:10:10] a complete separation
[1:10:12] amen oh i'll tell you now god
[1:10:16] as we we shared there i know that's been
[1:10:18] like a month ago
[1:10:19] i know you might not totally remember
[1:10:21] those things but lord stir your memory
[1:10:24] see what happened is god gave abraham
[1:10:27] and lot see god didn't just put the
[1:10:28] decision-making on
[1:10:29] abraham or he didn't just put it on lot
[1:10:32] right
[1:10:33] every one of us has to be a partaker of
[1:10:35] the decision process
[1:10:37] amen so god giving abraham and lot a
[1:10:40] chance to make a
[1:10:41] conscious decision now the difference of
[1:10:44] conscious decision and unconscious
[1:10:46] decision
[1:10:46] is my brother and sister we'll see
[1:10:48] sometimes that decisions are simply made
[1:10:50] for us
[1:10:51] you are driving down the road and you
[1:10:53] realize um
[1:10:54] wait this is the on-ramp to the freeway
[1:10:57] and it's three lanes and there's no way
[1:10:59] i can get over that's really a
[1:11:04] unconscious decision you were
[1:11:06] unconscious and missed every sign
[1:11:09] that pointed to the fact that you had to
[1:11:10] get on the freeway but now there's
[1:11:12] nothing you can do about it
[1:11:15] but a conscious decision is right or
[1:11:17] left
[1:11:18] i get to choose i have fear
[1:11:23] or i stand on the word amen that
[1:11:25] shouldn't be an unconscious thing
[1:11:28] i just accidentally trusted the lord no
[1:11:30] such thing
[1:11:32] i just accidentally had fear no no such
[1:11:35] thing
[1:11:36] see god was bringing them abraham and
[1:11:39] lot to the place they made a
[1:11:41] conscious decision every
[1:11:44] circumstance like i said the other day
[1:11:46] and i believe this with all my heart not
[1:11:48] doctrine just something i believe
[1:11:50] that if lot had said i'm staying up here
[1:11:52] on the planes you know because i got
[1:11:53] this great big herd of sheep and goats
[1:11:55] and cattle and whatever i'm staying up
[1:11:57] here
[1:11:57] you can have the plane down there and
[1:12:00] soda
[1:12:00] they'd have been a revival in sodom
[1:12:04] because abraham would have went down
[1:12:05] there and said in the name of the lord i
[1:12:08] bind every evil spirit
[1:12:10] and symbolically by the word of god
[1:12:12] would have just started sweeping sodom
[1:12:14] clean
[1:12:16] and there would have been nothing the
[1:12:17] spirit of sodom could have done about it
[1:12:20] are you with me you
[1:12:24] because we've been given power over
[1:12:25] unclean spirits
[1:12:27] amen come on saints we've been given
[1:12:30] power over them
[1:12:32] that shouldn't even be a you know a
[1:12:34] secondary thought to us
[1:12:37] so we look at this now this conscious
[1:12:39] decision but abram
[1:12:41] abraham by the word of god
[1:12:45] see i love this because god will never
[1:12:47] force the hand
[1:12:48] the holy spirit's a gentleman amen amen
[1:12:51] abraham step back you choose
[1:12:55] amen and whatever you choose i will take
[1:12:57] the opposite
[1:12:58] amen it doesn't say if he had an hour a
[1:13:02] day a week a month
[1:13:04] a year but it come to the place he made
[1:13:08] the conscious decision
[1:13:10] i want that that's where he went
[1:13:14] see that's the different saints between
[1:13:16] satan stumbling you are tricking you
[1:13:19] and you choosing right
[1:13:23] the conscious decision is you choosing
[1:13:27] to be whatever unbelief stumbling and
[1:13:30] falling
[1:13:31] is a unconscious i don't believe
[1:13:35] and we're using the word accident but
[1:13:37] that's you stubbing your toe and falling
[1:13:39] down
[1:13:40] but the holy ghost in you gets you back
[1:13:41] up cleans you up
[1:13:43] and you come to the place that you stand
[1:13:45] and say hey this is who i
[1:13:47] am this is my identity amen so
[1:13:50] so i i just throw this out and i need to
[1:13:52] move on i just throw this out to you
[1:13:54] which way are we pitching our tent
[1:13:58] it's really what it comes down to we
[1:13:59] don't need to go in a whole big process
[1:14:01] and waste a lot of time
[1:14:03] about do you believe are you a believer
[1:14:05] in this end time message this this this
[1:14:07] and this
[1:14:08] which way are you pitching the tent just
[1:14:10] stop right now
[1:14:11] and look at your tent and say which
[1:14:13] direction is my
[1:14:14] tent pitched
[1:14:17] and if you don't like the direction your
[1:14:19] tent is pitched today
[1:14:20] pull up the stakes turn that thing a
[1:14:22] different direction
[1:14:24] amen and drive those stakes down and
[1:14:26] never change it amen
[1:14:27] hallelujah are you with me amen
[1:14:31] now look i i just got quite a bit on the
[1:14:33] plate here sorry i need to hurry along
[1:14:35] now let's take john or saint luke 17 30
[1:14:38] and
[1:14:38] watch what jesus prophesied there saying
[1:14:41] as it was
[1:14:42] in the days of sodom it'll be the same
[1:14:44] now remember
[1:14:45] notice this is at the time that the son
[1:14:48] of man
[1:14:49] would be revealed the revealing of the
[1:14:52] son of man
[1:14:54] now we can look at it i don't want you
[1:14:56] reading i'll let you stop now
[1:15:01] we usually look at that in the coming
[1:15:03] context
[1:15:04] of our day as it was in sodom talking
[1:15:07] about historical
[1:15:09] is what we're going to see today at the
[1:15:12] coming
[1:15:13] of the son of man are you with me
[1:15:16] so that's how often i don't mean to
[1:15:18] imply that to all of you but i believe
[1:15:19] that's what the majority of us actually
[1:15:21] just draw that out place it right in
[1:15:23] this day and say okay as it was in sodom
[1:15:25] this is where we're at
[1:15:26] but i want you to see there was more
[1:15:28] elements involved
[1:15:30] than just the fact of what it was in the
[1:15:33] days of sodom
[1:15:34] there's elements that make up the depth
[1:15:38] of the story now my brother and sister i
[1:15:41] i'm not trying to apologize for myself
[1:15:43] and i'm not trying to
[1:15:44] to whatever uh sometimes sister jerry's
[1:15:47] just like you know paul
[1:15:49] you like gave so many details nobody
[1:15:52] knows what you're talking about
[1:15:54] and i realize i do that i do because i i
[1:15:57] like sometimes the details because to me
[1:15:59] the detail makes a difference and i'm
[1:16:00] not picking on sister jerry i'm just
[1:16:02] recognizing
[1:16:03] sometimes i just add so much in the
[1:16:05] story
[1:16:06] that that people are like okay now
[1:16:10] did that happen in the 17th century the
[1:16:12] 18th century
[1:16:13] because that was just way too much to
[1:16:14] have happened in the 21st
[1:16:23] this is at the time that the son of man
[1:16:24] would be revealed the revealing of the
[1:16:26] son of man
[1:16:28] now the son of man was actually
[1:16:31] revealed potentially now stop reading
[1:16:38] revealed potentially
[1:16:42] now he doesn't my brother and sister say
[1:16:44] he was revealed
[1:16:46] you know why i hear i'm going to read
[1:16:49] between the lines
[1:16:50] you people that don't like reading
[1:16:51] between the lines i'm sorry
[1:16:53] here we go push pause
[1:16:58] the reason brother branham uses the word
[1:17:00] potentially
[1:17:03] is not everyone saw this reveal
[1:17:09] this was not the merchant on the corner
[1:17:11] this was not the shepherd in the pasture
[1:17:13] this is not the
[1:17:14] whatever over here and over here you see
[1:17:18] this was something that clicked
[1:17:22] yes that's right for the believer
[1:17:29] the son of man was actually revealed
[1:17:32] potentially
[1:17:34] just for a few moments there just before
[1:17:36] sodom was burned
[1:17:38] now that man was elohim
[1:17:42] look at this now two angel
[1:17:46] messengers going down to lot
[1:17:49] down in sodom but who
[1:17:54] oh i hope you catch this but who
[1:17:58] is with those that will bring forth the
[1:18:01] promised child
[1:18:03] amen it wasn't excuse me
[1:18:06] it wasn't two messengers
[1:18:10] it was god himself
[1:18:14] hallelujah and it's not in this hour
[1:18:17] people are like oh this great preacher
[1:18:19] in the message it's great here
[1:18:21] i'm sorry my brother and sister it's not
[1:18:24] a great preacher
[1:18:25] that's bringing revelation to the bride
[1:18:28] of christ
[1:18:29] it is elohim himself
[1:18:34] it is not another voice
[1:18:40] make the connection i'll get sidetracked
[1:18:41] here but somebody reign me back start
[1:18:43] pulling right now
[1:18:45] but look when the prophet of god comes
[1:18:47] and he said
[1:18:48] i am god's voice
[1:18:51] to you was that lifting up any flesh
[1:18:56] no my brother and sister not was the
[1:19:00] potential revelation
[1:19:02] of elohim himself coming down and
[1:19:06] speaking lip to ear of the bride of
[1:19:09] christ
[1:19:10] now i am speaking to you
[1:19:16] amen that man was elohim
[1:19:21] that was gone for those that struggle
[1:19:24] sometimes
[1:19:25] maybe i shouldn't be so harsh on this
[1:19:27] but if you struggle with the godhead
[1:19:30] you just go study what the prophet of
[1:19:32] god talked about god in you
[1:19:34] the holy spirit is god all these things
[1:19:39] you know what i'm just going to go ahead
[1:19:40] and throw this out here amen

[1:20:08] come on saints you've got to understand
[1:20:11] we got to get a better balance maybe on
[1:20:13] the godhead than some of our teachings
[1:20:15] man
[1:20:16] because we got people that that are
[1:20:17] thinking god's not in me
[1:20:19] i've got the holy ghost but god's not in
[1:20:21] me i'm sorry you're confused
[1:20:23] somebody hasn't taught you correctly
[1:20:25] amen the prophet of god said this is all
[1:20:27] god

[1:20:31] gone
[1:20:33] amen now you look at that my brother and
[1:20:36] sister and realize now
[1:20:37] what brother branham is saying here that
[1:20:40] was god
[1:20:41] jesus is god and god was revealed
[1:20:43] potentially
[1:20:45] right there for a few moments to talk to
[1:20:47] abraham
[1:20:48] in the investigation judgment amen oh
[1:20:51] think about this this was not now look
[1:20:53] at this we see
[1:20:54] lot has made his decision went to sodom
[1:20:57] and here
[1:20:58] is abraham sitting here now my brother
[1:21:01] and sister i'm sorry
[1:21:02] god will not allow anyone to make it
[1:21:04] without being judged
[1:21:07] people say oh don't judge me the word
[1:21:09] says oh don't you judge me now
[1:21:10] you judge me it'll come back to you no
[1:21:12] no i'm sorry they missed the whole
[1:21:14] revelation of him
[1:21:16] you get a judge yourself or you get to
[1:21:18] be judged oh god help us this morning
[1:21:21] lord help us to judge ourselves i tell
[1:21:23] you saints i'm not talking about a harsh
[1:21:25] condemnation
[1:21:27] but i want to encourage you today
[1:21:29] investigate yourself
[1:21:31] uh very uh strictly very
[1:21:34] uh deeply amen
[1:21:38] and judge yourself on that
[1:21:47] just for a little bit the son of man was
[1:21:49] revealed the son of man elohim
[1:21:51] do you see it church congregation says
[1:21:55] amen well we take another place where
[1:21:57] brother brown was speaking to billy paul
[1:21:59] and he says you know i said this and
[1:22:00] this billy paul he says yes did you get
[1:22:02] it uh uh
[1:22:03] yeah yeah daddy i think so dad
[1:22:07] said there wasn't but what is that 3 or
[1:22:09] 4 or something
[1:22:11] the whole church that got it open our
[1:22:14] eyes lord
[1:22:14] that's right amen open our eyes lord
[1:22:18] don't let us just intellectually grasp
[1:22:22] something come on saints
[1:22:26] intellectually grasping it will
[1:22:30] not open it to you and i
[1:22:33] that's the truth that's exactly right
[1:22:35] that's it
[1:22:39] the son of man elohim was revealed just
[1:22:41] for a few minutes
[1:22:43] and for the very next morning she was
[1:22:44] burned when before the sun
[1:22:47] could come up again you see what's
[1:22:50] happening there my brother and sister
[1:22:53] there is there is such
[1:22:56] an anointing of the intellectual realm
[1:22:59] brother brown talks about no the worst
[1:23:01] mistake you can do is send your young
[1:23:03] men
[1:23:03] off to seminary did he do he called it
[1:23:06] cemetery
[1:23:08] you send them off what happened we're
[1:23:09] replacing the leadership of the holy
[1:23:11] spirit
[1:23:12] with an intellectual understanding
[1:23:16] and knowledge the prophet of god says
[1:23:18] knowledge will not
[1:23:20] bring the presence of god oh god help us
[1:23:24] when you find yourself grasping
[1:23:27] something in the word
[1:23:28] i encourage you stop and say lord don't
[1:23:31] let this be intellectual to me
[1:23:33] lord i want this to be the anointing of
[1:23:36] the holy ghost
[1:23:37] that's opened my eyes so that i don't
[1:23:39] just have a bit of knowledge
[1:23:42] hallelujah right my we got all these
[1:23:44] programmer kind of people
[1:23:45] amen brother alex brother
[1:23:48] isaac uh brother chris
[1:23:52] and they type in x's and o's and all
[1:23:54] this kind of stuff that makes these
[1:23:56] things happen right
[1:23:57] and it's kind of cool right because i
[1:23:58] can't do it
[1:24:01] of course i haven't seen them make a
[1:24:02] cornfield grow lately either so i i
[1:24:04] don't have an inferiority complex
[1:24:08] but now look my brother and sister all
[1:24:12] the x's and o's
[1:24:13] and all the type it in on the screen and
[1:24:16] push enter
[1:24:17] doesn't make it real
[1:24:23] i won't go too far in depth i've got a
[1:24:26] i've got a relative
[1:24:28] you can say something and then he'll be
[1:24:29] over you can see it i've caught the
[1:24:31] pattern now
[1:24:32] you'll say something and then he'll just
[1:24:33] kind of be over
[1:24:35] well google says well i don't really
[1:24:38] care what google says but i can tell you
[1:24:40] if you're swinging a two-pound hammer
[1:24:42] and your hand is in the way
[1:24:46] google never told your brain what that
[1:24:48] felt like
[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:53] intellectual conception never moved you
[1:24:56] in the
[1:25:04] do it take your phone right now even if
[1:25:06] you want to
[1:25:07] google siri what does pain feel like
[1:25:14] until they put prongs on the end of that
[1:25:16] phone and that siri tells you to put
[1:25:18] that on your chest
[1:25:21] yeah siri google can't tell you what
[1:25:24] pain feels like
[1:25:26] nor can it tell you what revelation
[1:25:28] that's it
[1:25:31] did we find that quote brothers hey man
[1:25:33] let's pop that right up real quick amen
[1:25:36] now look i i i'm gonna say right here
[1:25:39] i'm cherry-picking this and the reason i
[1:25:41] throw that out is i want you to go and
[1:25:42] investigate to make sure all that's
[1:25:44] being said right here
[1:25:45] but you know what when we start arguing
[1:25:47] over profit
[1:25:48] and believing a prophet and this and
[1:25:50] that brother brown said this one time
[1:25:52] is that sufficient for us to believe it
[1:25:54] or do we need 100.
[1:25:57] you go back and find the point the holy
[1:25:59] spirit is the prophet
[1:26:02] of this hour do i believe
[1:26:05] that there is a prophet in the land oh
[1:26:08] my brother and sister the earthly
[1:26:10] prophet that god used
[1:26:12] to walk on this earth that we could have
[1:26:15] as brother branham talks about several
[1:26:17] places
[1:26:17] we could have a point of contact he
[1:26:20] talks about how oral robert
[1:26:21] tells him to reach out now and touch the
[1:26:24] radio or the television
[1:26:25] have a point of contact well god sent us
[1:26:28] a prophet
[1:26:29] in the flesh so that we would have
[1:26:32] a point of contact
[1:26:35] but look what that point of contact told
[1:26:37] us the holy spirit is the prophet of
[1:26:40] this hour
[1:26:42] he vindicated his word proving it the
[1:26:44] holy spirit
[1:26:45] was the prophet of moses hour the holy
[1:26:48] spirit was the prophet of
[1:26:50] michael's hour the holy spirit which
[1:26:52] wrote the word
[1:26:55] come on come on this holy spirit the
[1:26:59] word of god says that men were anointed
[1:27:02] of the holy spirit to write the word of
[1:27:03] god
[1:27:04] so you could take this and say wait now
[1:27:07] men wrote the word of god
[1:27:09] no they never because i can tell you
[1:27:11] what it's like when your mind is
[1:27:13] completely blank and you're studying for
[1:27:15] a sermon
[1:27:15] you can sit 25 30 40 50 hours
[1:27:19] but without a spark of anointing you'll
[1:27:22] have no more to preach to the church
[1:27:24] than when you started but when that
[1:27:27] anointing hits you
[1:27:28] that spark comes down all of a sudden
[1:27:31] you can't
[1:27:32] write fast enough oh hallelujah
[1:27:36] amen the holy spirit which wrote the
[1:27:38] word comes
[1:27:40] and confirms the word no
[1:27:43] i'm just going to throw this on there
[1:27:46] i'm just going to throw this on there i
[1:27:47] just can't help myself
[1:27:48] i have stood and i will continue to
[1:27:50] stand i have been criticized for making
[1:27:52] this statement
[1:27:53] and i don't really care because i
[1:27:54] believe it's the truth and i believe if
[1:27:56] you analyze it you'll believe it's the
[1:27:58] truth my brother and sister
[1:27:59] the miracles that took place when
[1:28:01] brother branham was on the scene
[1:28:03] amen he discerned the hearts we just was
[1:28:05] listening the other night sitting in bed
[1:28:07] listening to a service there comes right
[1:28:09] down in the prayer line
[1:28:10] and brother branham's talking and then
[1:28:12] he mentions a city where somebody lives
[1:28:14] and he says oh somebody thinks that's
[1:28:15] wrong
[1:28:18] holy spirit so in tune that those people
[1:28:21] had moved that very day
[1:28:23] or the day before whatever it was right
[1:28:27] right and people are like he missed that
[1:28:29] one
[1:28:31] no he never no
[1:28:35] amen amen
[1:28:40] is that the vindication
[1:28:44] of malachi 4
[1:28:48] i maintain and i will till there's no
[1:28:50] breath in this body
[1:28:51] you are the vindication
[1:28:54] of malachi 4. because if
[1:28:58] the prophecy as i spoke this earlier and
[1:29:00] i spoke it intentional
[1:29:02] if the prophecy is prophesied but no
[1:29:08] manifestation
[1:29:15] but i'll tell you one of the reasons i
[1:29:16] believe this message paul one of the
[1:29:18] reasons you believe the message you got
[1:29:19] more than one
[1:29:20] i got a list so long and knock you down
[1:29:24] one of the reasons i believe this
[1:29:25] message is because i'm seeing the
[1:29:27] vindication
[1:29:29] of this message hallelujah we could get
[1:29:32] if we could afford to do it
[1:29:33] and they would let us we could all climb
[1:29:35] on a plane today we could fly to africa
[1:29:37] we could fly to europe we could fly to
[1:29:38] asia we could fly to australia we could
[1:29:40] fly to south america we could fly to the
[1:29:42] other end of the
[1:29:43] united states and we can walk right into
[1:29:46] an assembly
[1:29:46] and you'll know that this is the same
[1:29:48] presence of god
[1:29:50] that you experience day by day the same
[1:29:52] power of the word the same thing's
[1:29:54] happening
[1:29:56] hallelujah it's not a man-made creation
[1:29:59] otherwise you'd get on a plane fly to
[1:30:01] johannesburg and it would be
[1:30:03] uh brother gideon retief flavor
[1:30:09] you could go to europe and it'd be
[1:30:12] brother
[1:30:13] uh gerwald it'd be his flavor
[1:30:18] and you go to the east coast and be
[1:30:19] their flavor and go the west coast and
[1:30:20] be their flavor
[1:30:21] but i'll tell you what i've witnessed it
[1:30:24] you can get off you can walk in the door
[1:30:27] many years ago sister jerry and i went
[1:30:28] to south africa for to speak in a youth
[1:30:31] deal
[1:30:31] and we've gone in there on a sunday
[1:30:33] night and uh the brother said

[1:30:45] room jerry and i look at each other
[1:30:48] church we want to go to church
[1:30:52] they're having communion the brother's
[1:30:54] up there they're already in the process
[1:30:55] of doing communion
[1:30:57] but the brother's up there now i don't
[1:30:58] say this to not pump anything up i just
[1:31:00] want to tell you
[1:31:01] this is my first hand witness of god
[1:31:03] doing and the brother is there serving
[1:31:04] communion
[1:31:05] he's making some comments and i'm like i
[1:31:07] just preached that on wednesday
[1:31:09] makes another comment that was the
[1:31:10] sunday previous
[1:31:12] is that orchestrated of man
[1:31:22] amen i'll tell you what i believe every
[1:31:24] word
[1:31:25] my prophet has said
[1:31:29] i say that natural and the spiritual
[1:31:32] side too
[1:31:34] hallelujah if i did not go find me a new
[1:31:37] religion
[1:31:38] but the world's just fresh out of
[1:31:39] religions that are worth following
[1:31:42] so what are we going to do
[1:31:46] please don't misunderstand me
[1:31:50] okay let's go back to where we was
[1:31:51] brothers amen
[1:31:53] hallelujah so there can be no
[1:31:57] organization left
[1:31:58] neither can there be any further
[1:32:00] advancement than what's going
[1:32:02] right now amen amen
[1:32:09] we've got a new revelation
[1:32:12] sorry it's on my axe grinding table
[1:32:16] i haven't finished grinding it yet so
[1:32:18] you'll just have to put up with a little
[1:32:20] longer
[1:32:21] when somebody can stand when the word of
[1:32:24] god
[1:32:26] timothy and titus and a prophet of god
[1:32:30] brings it out and speaks against it and
[1:32:33] yet people will say
[1:32:34] oh the prophet gave us the prophet
[1:32:38] spoke of a divorced preacher exemption
[1:32:43] in the message sorry i'm sorry it's
[1:32:46] still on my axe grinding table
[1:32:49] it won't be done until i have ground
[1:32:50] that thing past the handle and it's just
[1:32:52] no good
[1:32:54] because my brother and sister the word
[1:32:56] of god says you deviate one word
[1:32:58] amen but you know what people will go
[1:33:01] well that's just an opinion no that's
[1:33:02] false doctrine
[1:33:04] that's false and i don't care how kind
[1:33:07] the old priest is that brings it amen
[1:33:12] hallelujah so thank you for being
[1:33:14] patient while i ground my axe
[1:33:16] that's all right see there can't be no
[1:33:19] organization neither can be
[1:33:21] further advancement right prophet of god
[1:33:24] himself says
[1:33:25] look if i come and said anything
[1:33:28] different
[1:33:29] remember concerning the seals and that
[1:33:31] and they said oh brother branham the
[1:33:32] things that you could write
[1:33:34] and he says no no oh no no no
[1:33:38] i couldn't add anything to this it was
[1:33:42] already in the word
[1:33:44] it was already there i can't add
[1:33:48] anything to this
[1:33:51] amen for she'll burn before the day
[1:33:54] breaks again
[1:33:56] the revival is over across the nation
[1:33:57] there ain't going to be no more revivals
[1:33:59] big sweeping revivals
[1:34:00] this nation never receive it you might
[1:34:04] have an intellectual gathering
[1:34:07] but i i mean a spiritual revival we've
[1:34:10] seen all of it
[1:34:12] you know what that tells me saints look
[1:34:13] i'm not trying to make a great emphasis
[1:34:15] and twist anything or turning
[1:34:16] you know what it tells me you don't need
[1:34:19] to go search out the latest and greatest
[1:34:21] in this message
[1:34:22] you need to believe and live what's
[1:34:25] already been placed
[1:34:26] in your hands that's all we need don't
[1:34:29] get under some inspiration we go over
[1:34:31] here look what's going over there
[1:34:32] they're dancing down the back of the
[1:34:34] pews
[1:34:35] i'm sorry you don't need that you don't
[1:34:37] need that
[1:34:39] that's no sign prophet of god says over
[1:34:41] and over again those things speaking in
[1:34:43] tongues
[1:34:44] all of this but there that that's no
[1:34:46] proof
[1:34:47] that's no sign that you got it but the
[1:34:50] word
[1:34:52] amen becomes our sign hallelujah
[1:34:55] we've seen all of it i hope you're
[1:34:57] catching it
[1:34:59] i'm saying it in such a way
[1:35:04] i'm saying it in such a way that i i
[1:35:06] hope you get it see
[1:35:08] you know what that is that was the curve
[1:35:12] ball
[1:35:20] come on the curveball did you see it
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:26] because if you see the curve ball you
[1:35:28] hit it
[1:35:33] i'm sorry to deviate and i'm not much
[1:35:35] into sports but there's this guy that
[1:35:37] was
[1:35:37] just he's retired now but he was one of
[1:35:39] the best hitters in baseball
[1:35:42] and they said how can you be so
[1:35:44] consistent
[1:35:46] he said well the minute that ball left
[1:35:48] the pitcher's hand
[1:35:50] i could tell you where it would be
[1:35:56] can you believe that or should we just
[1:36:00] blindly swing
[1:36:05] come on this is a revelation of the holy
[1:36:08] ghost in you
[1:36:09] that when the prophet spoke and he says
[1:36:11] now i spoke this ins
[1:36:14] i sang in such a way that i hope you get
[1:36:16] it the bride of christ is like
[1:36:18] it's going to be right here
[1:36:22] there a flying off over here this ain't
[1:36:24] flying off over here
[1:36:26] i know what he meant and then people are
[1:36:29] like how can you say you know
[1:36:31] well i don't know how i know i just know
[1:36:36] praise the lord that's the truth
[1:36:40] a fine minister said a while ago brother
[1:36:41] branham if i could just have the joy of
[1:36:44] the lord in my heart
[1:36:46] come on say that's it what do you think
[1:36:50] about it

[1:36:53] you there's times that the joy of the
[1:36:55] lord just
[1:36:55] escapes you you get up and you preach

[2:03:28] i mean there's some really good quotes
[2:03:30] let's see we're on about page five or
[2:03:32] six in the rising of the sun amen
[2:03:34] but we're gonna go right to the end of
[2:03:35] it right here
[2:03:38] and we'll close with this and as he
[2:03:42] being the groom
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:45] the bride might come forth
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:51] aren't you glad we have a screen because
[2:03:53] i'd have you guys all confused what not
[2:03:58] as he being the groom the bride has
[2:04:01] to come forth because
[2:04:06] what's the cause it's a part of him
[2:04:11] wow wow this bride has to come forth
[2:04:15] a prophet's message must produce
[2:04:19] a bride of christ because
[2:04:24] it's part of him
[2:04:28] and it can only be the manifestation of
[2:04:30] the fulfilling
[2:04:31] of all the revelations any others has
[2:04:34] spoke of the bride
[2:04:35] it can only manifest
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:39] you see my brother and sister i don't
[2:04:41] care how deep the revelation is of the
[2:04:43] preacher or how
[2:04:43] shallow the revelation of the preacher
[2:04:45] is how that this pastor over here just
[2:04:48] has such this incredible
[2:04:50] a grasp on everything and can tie the
[2:04:52] greek and the hebrew and the aramaic and
[2:04:54] all this together
[2:04:55] and then this poor pastor over here all
[2:04:57] he can do is tell you jesus christ the
[2:04:59] same yesterday today i
[2:05:00] believe what do we lean to
[2:05:05] the one that breaks it all down one that
[2:05:08] breaks it down
[2:05:12] or the one that says i'm not very smart
[2:05:14] and i can't put this together but i
[2:05:16] found this reference guide
[2:05:19] and uh my prophet said it's a road map
[2:05:23] so i i just uh well look here's
[2:05:27] point a
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:31] here's point b
[2:05:35] wow i don't know how i got all the way
[2:05:38] from a to b
[2:05:39] but i really like where b is at
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:45] and it can only be the manifestation of
[2:05:47] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[2:05:49] any others has spoken see they didn't
[2:05:52] have anything
[2:05:53] they didn't make the bride they didn't
[2:05:55] provide the way for the bride
[2:05:56] they didn't give strength to the bride
[2:05:58] they were not
[2:05:59] what brought the bride to the bridegroom
[2:06:03] they were just eliezers
[2:06:06] helpers
[2:06:07] [Music]
[2:06:10] and it can only manifest it does
[2:06:12] something different from the groom
[2:06:14] it isn't the bride because this is the
[2:06:17] part i want to get excited about are
[2:06:19] you already with me come on are you all
[2:06:22] ready with me
[2:06:23] she that's me is flash
[2:06:27] of his flash hallelujah it can't go to a
[2:06:31] marriage supper without me because i'm
