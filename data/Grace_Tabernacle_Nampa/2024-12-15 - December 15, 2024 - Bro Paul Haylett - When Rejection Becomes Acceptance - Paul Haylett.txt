fullness of God in Hess babe this gift of love this righteousness scorned by the ones he came to say till on that cross as Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied for every every sin on him was laid here in the death of Christ I live there in the ground his body lay Light of the World by Darkness slain then bursting forth in Glorious Day up from the grave he rose again and as he stands in victory

I'll Stand thank you Lord thank you Lord that we stand here in your power today Lord no other power controls Our Lives father but you and father we say from the depths of our hearts thank you thank you Lord give us the confidence to Proclaim this give us the confidence to fulfill this Lord Jesus that we could stand here today in our Darkest Hours Lord when the clouds are here when the rain is falling and it seems All Is Lost may we stand upon that and testify no other power controls my life thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Lord Jesus hallelujah amen um just a couple little thoughts here real quick one we once again uh want to greet our sister Luba God bless you glad you're here with us amen and then surprise so glad to see you guys God bless you amen hallelujah to each and every one of you today it's just good to see you in the house of God knowing that this is where we were called to come to recharge we should be feeding on the word amen being you know energized by the word every single day of our life but but there's just something special about it the Lord told us not to forsake coming here you know we we live in such an age of electronics you know we get in a habit you go to bed or whatever it is and and you plug it in to recharge it because when the power runs out it's no good that's right we have to recharge amen we have to come get plugged into the word get plugged into the presence of God just let that come into us and you notice you don't just plug it in and pull it back out and it's charged it it takes time in the presence of the power of God to charge our battery and so wonderful certainly we want to remember brother Alex and sister Rachel in this time honeymoon time uh just God be with them and uh may it be a wonderful time amen I'd like to speak to you today when rejection becomes acceptance now might seem like a little bit different title thank you musicians God bless you it might seem like a little different title but you see uh we live in a day and age that um uh we are called to make a stand we have to we have to literally stop and say you know what uh I'm not of this world that's exactly right and and that has to become the very essence of who we are is our identity cannot be partially in Christ that's right and partially in the world but we have to come to a place that that we would stand and so I kind of put it as today's thought goes two ways we reject Christ then we can be accepted of Satan and we reject Satan we can be accepted of Christ amen so it comes to a time that our rejection becomes acceptance and so if we tur in our Bibles to Matthew's 16th chapter and uh certainly trust that the Lord would just help us today to to articulate this correctly um we uh as we look in 16 verse 24- 28 uh we just take a a bit of our thought from this today quite a bit of scripture so just a little prayer please to help us through this then Jesus said unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me so I think we could easily if you wouldn't mind we could easily put this point right here let him reject himself amen amen amen for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his Works whether they be acceptance or rejection amen verily I say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and I say Amen to verse 28 amen it might be that I will be gone but some of you still here by the grace of God to see that fulfilled amen Heavenly Father we just ask you to come today Lord so good to be gathered once again with the Saints Lord and father just ask you to bless this time May the word come so powerfully father not because of the power of the man but because of the power of your revealed word and father come powerfully this morning Lord deal with hearts that I would know nothing about deal with lives and situations father that maybe are hidden as a deep secret within that person but Lord we are coming today asking you Lord just to recharge us let the word invigorate us father let us give us strength father into this bodies father that we can rise up and proudly proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ there' be no question of who we are and what we are here for we ask for your blessings in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Hallelujah whenever whenever I hear this song whenever it comes forth take this whole world and give me Jesus whenever I hear that song it it always is a reminder along this thought it it uh brings me to a place that it's like stop for a moment Paul and and measure what is your motivations and what is what is uh touch in your life what is putting you in a position uh to make certain priorities and ultimately we come to this place where by God's grace we realize that truly it is a revelation to us in this day that take this whole world that's it that's it you can have all of the wealth of this world but give me Jesus amen because life my brother and sister while a life of wealth let me just uh don't don't get too caught up in what I'm going to say here a life of wealth must be glorious to be able to live and do and have whatever you would desire but even if you live to a long age say a hundred years old that will be as just a flicker in time ultimately you will come to a place that you would be I'm I'm coming to to that age right now it's it's kind of coming upon me a little bit where I stop and I say where have the years gone that's right and so imagine you live to be a hundred but you're still going to be a 100 years old and you would look at that and as it says there what would you give my brother and sister what would we give for our soul those men with billions of dollars at that age taking a last breath would give every dime they've got for one more breath and so it's there in that time that wealth must be nice but my brother and sister how can we place value on eternal life amen to know that when this life passes that it is just now a transition of molecules moving into the presence of God to be reborn as it is in our youth again in that strength of Youth but it's not just about the youth but to know that what we live for Christ here we get to continue to live for eternity amen that is what makes it so beautiful is that we just get to continue on what is the priority of this life becomes the priority of Eternity and I thank God for that amen so the gospel challenges us to be in this world but not of this world and you know that's a actually a greater challenge than I think we give credit for my brother and sister it's it's a here in this world we we realize to the young people I don't want to be a downer to you but you know you're going to get a little bit older and then you get to work work work work work but when we were young we couldn't wait to be 18 to have a car to have our own bank account to be able to do what we wanted to do and then as a whisp gone to those of you are broke you wished you had more to those of you that have sufficient maybe God would anoint you to share that's right so we look at this my brother and sister to be in this world but not of this world can you get into the lake without getting wet so we realized the very eff of life is putting us right on the front line there's no such thing as hiding out in leoda to just pass the time to find the right moment to appear but it's there my brother and sister that that if you're going to jump in the lake just expect to get wet amen if it's cold outside and you don't wear a coat just expect to get cold and if you're in Leo deia just expect the devil to be here trying to make you lukewarm isn't this scripture so interesting when it says that I work that you would be hot or cold so we would almost be better off today if you follow me it's not my desire for you but if you would follow today God would rather that we would simply be absolutely cold yeah than to be lukewarm right but yet look at the world we live in today Satan reads his Bible he looks at that and says you know what I know how God feels about this because I can read the word too then I don't want to just pitch them out he doesn't really honestly Saints he doesn't really find as much pleasure in causing a man or a woman to just go throw their life to the world as he finds that pleasure in putting them in a lukewarm position cuz in a lukewarm position he knows that God is going to spew them out of his mouth which taken in context is complete rejection almost an insult imagine sitting at a table a sister recognizes you don't like her food but you sit there faithfully and eat everything on your plate she says well that wasn't his his food that wasn't what he really liked but imagine we're sitting at the same sister's table and we spit it out sisters can you imagine with me for a moment the ultimate of insult right I know this is truth I've sat down in certain countries and they dished up food and I took the first bite and stopped and they thought I was just blessing the food again but I was there Lord please help me and you got to be careful because if you close your eyes or look away for a moment they think Phil's played again but you see my brother and sister what would it be could I go call them sister if I had then done such an insult no so we see Satan's trying in this day to bring us to a place where just simply lukewarm because he knows God will not accept us and actually we become an insult to the gospel to say I'm a Christian but I'm Luke war God help us come on Saints we're not here to to try to move you by fear even though the scripture gives us permission that by fear to draw you out but you see we're not here by fear to do this but let's not be the lukewarm Christian that would bring such an insult such a slander to our Lord Jesus amen there is very serious influences in this age is there not we we look at the day and age that we live in you know to some I I don't I don't want to pin this on no one else there's been a time in my life I was just C certain that you know I would just work really hard and I would make a lot of money and you know and I had a whole scenario a whole list mapped out about what I would do with this money when I earned it and and you know God has blessed sister Jerry and I don't misunderstand me we we've done well you might say in life but it's nothing like what my initial ambition of my life put it at and God said you know you're actually my son and and I have made a commitment to you uh and I will not lose a one and so along the way God just keeps allowing things to happen that humble us that bring us to a place that we realize I am not in control of my own destiny God May bless me God may give me a few Comforts in life a few possessions in life but my destiny is not in my hand it's in his hand and God says if I see something that is detrimental to you I reserve the right to either bring you to the place that you outright reject it or to make it so painful you draw away from it James 4:4 says ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God Amen I don't believe there's a single one of us sitting here this morning that would say I I I don't have a problem being an enemy of God my brother and sister you talk about a scary position amen because God's going to put every enemy under his feet amen I I I wasn't designed you was not designed to to be in that position we was called in fact the scripture uh gives us a a a forward view of what it will be my brother and sister we're not just going to be standing around in heaven praising God we're actually going to be as his bride in the throne that means we're in him amen we're not just sitting there not just a spectator we are a part and parcel of redemption of the plan of God of the king of kings amen and so as we look at this we recognize how Satan is so clever that he would cause us now if this doesn't fit you please don't don't reject it but he would cause us to come to a place that we don't call it compromis but we believe we can kind of straddle it we can kind of be just a little bit out here in the world and we can be uh maybe a little bit more so into the gospel but my brother and sister God's looking for 100% as we said already either hot or cold 100% in or 100% out amen and God has more respect for that so it's there see how how Satan is so clever that he slips in little compromises yes sir I I just I I I don't want to preach to you and expect you to line up to the word without acknowledging that we have our own things and and I I'm I'm I guess you would say a verocious reader I love to read it doesn't kind of matter what it is in a sense I love to read and yet God convicted me here some time back that I have books in my library that I wouldn't not want to hand to my Lord Jesus and say have you read this that's I had an initial thought of I'm going to take these books and I'll go send them down to to the Youth Ranch or something and then I was like if it's filth to me it will be filth to them and I threw them in the trash and they're now buried somewhere out in the landfill and that's where they deserve to be CU they are trash but you see what happens is is I I I hope you follow me this morning how clever Satan is to come and bring us to a position of compromise and we don't even know we're compromising we don't even realize that we have backed away from being red hot and are starting to go into the realm of lukewarm now this is the same Library saints that I have the message in bookcases stacked up book after book after book and it's all there my brother and sister you see dwelling in the same place vessels of Honor vessels of Dishonor that's it do we compromise and say a happy medium is good That's what Satan desires he desires for us to come to a place that we have enough of the message to offset enough of Lucifer's message God help us yes sir amen God help us you see we come to that place we have to reject to be accepted and you have to be willing to accept the rejection every one of us has to come to a place we're willing to give up what God's asking us to give up you know for some it might actually even come down to a job it might be if God has called us oh here's a job out in the middle of nowhere will make much money we'll be able to take our children to all kinds of special meetings and youth camps and this and that we'll be there for New Year's and communion and and then we're too busy to get in the car to go and Satan tricked us that we what we thought was a blessing was actually a trap of the devil amen and so we look at this my brother and sister now don't misunderstand me there are circumstances there are times but I'm talking about us making a life decision that keeps our children out of the house of God for year upon Year and that there's no reconciling that if God asks you to to or opens a door and you need to amen you need to go somewhere you need to take care of some work and do that my brother and sister I would trust there's more of Christ in you than to backslide in that period of time amen but you have to understand see that God wants us to be in the house of God and he wants wants us to be in fellowship and when we compromise on either one of those you will have a detrimental effect come and influence your life so it's there to be a friend of the world is an enemy of God and and so Satan's clever enough to un draw people unwittingly into this trap it's not like we willfully right go walk out and say you know what I'm just going to just step out of Fellowship because I don't need them people God said you did Sir now I can understand maybe you don't like those people that's fine but let me be harsh maybe when you get another dose of the Holy Ghost they'll look better that's right hope that didn't offend anybody and I have a quote to back it up if I need need to okay prophet of God talking about them sisters you know and the one looking out the window and whatever else you know about the time that she cleaned her window suddenly the sister across the lady across the deal there looked much better oh Lord take the isav Lord let us clean the windows let us come to the place that we're looking out and our brother and sister if we don't agree we still love them amen we still respect them and so that's what s Satan coming so clever see he works his way in and this is what I I I like and I've made kind of light of this in the past but you know my brother and sisters there's a lot of ways to to sing that song justifying you know I never did it in the first place it's their fault but you see what God wants us to do is come down that he don't care whose fault it is because if we come down to what we deserve my brother and sister none of us could sit here this morning under the presence of the Holy Spirit because we deserve much more than God said I will give you and it's there when I say that you know what I'm talking about we deserve the negative amen and God said I'm going to give you the positive I'm going to bless you when I should by all right you would be cursed but I'm going to bless you because I've taken the curse into my own flesh and straddling that fence between the world and the gospel it's not something we were ever even designed to do that's right to quote my late father he would put it this way he would tell me talking about spiritual things straddling the fence is no problem Paul until you come to a post and ultimately at a post you have to get off one side or the other so get off now that's right amen and God will bring I'm talking to Believers okay don't don't misunderstand I'm talking to Believers we might as well get off the fence now amen and not make God Force us off the fence Amen Let God move us to a place that even if it's difficult even if it's difficult my brother and sister now we have to use good judgment getting on the fence if you don't mind just a moment of of humor here as a young man we had dairy cattle my dad did not like Bob wire because it you know cuts the cattle up just like horse people don't like Bob wire it cuts up the horse and um I also learned the hard way my dad never told me about when you stradle the fence which side to get off of but if there's a hot wire on that one side amen get off the other side amen if there's judgment off one side get off the other side amen we're not here to be going through life in a constant state of continual shock amen God wants to bring us peace joy happiness amen so look what Satan's trying to do he's trying to get us to get so comfortable in this world that we think we can just kind of bounce back and forth between the two you know it was interesting Brother David and sister Diane was there in the conversation in North Idaho and and a brother up there was sharing a little bit of his life uh and some things that had happened in his life and you know he was there and come into some troubled times and Men He thought were're Brothers you might say put the hooks to him you see my brother and sister sometimes God is going to allow that to happen that we will not judge by personality or how much or how fine of life and how whatever they own and how many they own that we would judge by the word and the word says that we should judge all things righteously that's right and as we judge righteously God's promise that he would lead us and guide us and and you know part of that judging righteously is actually acting asking God to show us what we should do instead of doing what seems to be best convenient or obvious we need that kind of leadership because you see Satan will lead us into a trap of his own so if you look at this now we'll never be comfortable in this world I just want to make this announcement this morning this uh you know to glare this out here right now we will never be comfortable in this world just like we would not be comfortable in countries on the Earth today you would not feel safe you would not feel like you belong there I've had a few of experiences like that in in life amen when you find yourself in a circumstance that that the people you're surrounded with they would just as well throw you in an alley as a rag as they would to speak to you and we realize I don't belong here now it is that we in our spirit Satan now uh bear with me today I don't even know what to call this kind of service I just know this is what God laid upon my heart my brother and sister when we have DED the presence of the holy spirit in our life we end up in circumstance or location or place or purpose that we never were meant to be in but our spiritual sense is dulled and we find ourselves there and then a glimpse of something reminds us this is not my world I don't belong here Lord help me that's right and then when we get out of that D State and we come and God dealing with us we realize you know what how how did I ever end up in this condition now let's be honest this morning you don't have to lift a hand you don't have to acknowledge anything but I believe every one of us sitting here this morning would have to say yes and I'm not being arrogant I'm not trying to be bold it's just a fact how many of us have come to the point that we have hardly got enough fire in us to say Amen hardly enough fire in us to get up out out of our house and go to the house of God enough fire in us to get down and pray earnestly amen am I kind of on the right track and then we come to a place that by the grace of God we recognize and we say how did I get here well don't beat yourself up please honestly don't don't start I must not be a real Christian no my brother and sister this shows the adversary that you are facing is so clever to bring you to a place that you don't really care about God at all maybe you know that you've got sin in your life unbelief in your life and you'd say well I guess I'm so far gone it doesn't matter anyhow that's a famous lie of the devil it doesn't matter anyhow but you see my brother and S sister even if you don't feel like it please believe me this morning even if you don't feel like it God called you God brought you this but he opened the word to you he give Revelation to you he let you see who you are and the devil's trying to get you to look at the other side of the coin and not even recognize not give any credit this is what we're doing we're doing disservice to the holy spirit because we won't even acknowledge his presence amen amen amen and yet we'd still say God sent a prophet I believe the message as lukewarm as lukewarm as lukewarm as lukewarm can be and then Satan would just leave you alone for a while because he's got you where he wants you but you see the word amen we believe the word don't we amen the word says I've never lost a one amen so all the way out in lukewarm L oia God comes and brings a beautiful reminder to us of who we are and why we're here and the word suddenly Sparks alive you might be doing something this is a little bit of a testimony of an individual I was doing something totally unrelated to God and a man who just has a a a mega church kind of relationship ship with God starts telling him just how good God is and he's sitting there going oh my this man I won't go into this whole testimony this man is is here in his theology telling me how I should be excited about what God's doing and I haven't been excited for months and God used that to draw him back and say Lord why am I not excited yeah yeah does that immediately mean he's not a Believer not saved not called not chosen no it's a time we have to reject to be received amen and as long as we're willing to compromise we'll face those kind of battles that's why we should stand up and say God is my God his people Are My People amen I will worship in the way he's called me to worship and I will serve him in the way he's called me to serve him with no compromise you see Ruth is not just a sister's chapter that's right it's the believer the bride it's who we are to come with a revelation my brother and sister that truly your God is my God Amen so as we look at this now in John 15 and8 uh 18 and 19 there said if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you see and oftentimes young people we'll come to a struggle because we're kind of mocked and looked down on because we're Christians and and you know we then try to kind of compromise or strid that fence I did it through my whole high school years I straddled the fence I don't say this to be humorous I just want to tell you what anointing will do to you you I would walk out of the house I didn't have a tie on obviously nice shirt looked good respectable I would get on the school bus before I made it to the back of the school bus roll the Cuffs up unbutton the shirt the walk went from what I would call normal do you see these kids you see on the streets today I'm sorry to disappoint them Poor Boys they're nothing new they're not original they're copycats walk to the back of the bus now at my age you might find that hard to imagine at that age it came naturally yeah you know what I looked like when I got off the school bus sleeves rolled down pants pulled up you know what that's called a chameleon yeah you see I fit perfectly into the environment I was in that's also called the Great deception that's right to still think in your heart I'm a Christian and then blend into the environment that's not what God called us to God called us to be a light to the world he called us to stand out he called us to be representation of him amen and I'm I'm telling you my brother and sister when Jesus walked in the room they knew he was there that's right amen it wasn't because his clothes it wasn't because the way he walked it wasn't the latest Styles it was the spirit the presence of almighty God was in him I want to be a Christian amen right that's what it is right to be Christlike Hallelujah so if the world hates you don't worry about it they hated him before they hated you and if you were of the world the world would love his I wonder if any of you will identify with this you get out in the world and as much as you would try to be part of the world you don't fit in that's right and if you don't realize that that's Christ in you then you'll just start to think that you're some strange Oddball whatever that that just is weird to everybody but my brother and sister that's Christ keeping you from the compromise he's keeping you from coming to the place that you look like the world in a lukewarm version of Christianity that's not what we're called to but I have chosen you now I've been studying recently might preach on this I mentioned at a time or two about um Calvinism and Armenian ISM and you know they have their arguments about predestination and and how it all fits together but my brother and sister let's forget about Armenian ISM and Calvinism and let's just take the word for what it is and and am I reading this correctly in John 15 that it says there uh you know that uh because you're not of the world but I have chosen you yes sir does the scripture have that correct or did we choose him see the word says that we've never come to him he's always come to us and people say well predestination well that's deceptive to think that God chose you and he's going to let other people go to hell but he chose you to keep you from going to hell and then they just conviently they don't quote all of the Bible that's right now my brother and sister you can walk and be part of without being chosen but ultimately time we'll do the separation everything is tested amen with time amen that's right and many a person today has come down to this point and said I'm a believer I'm a believer I'm a Believer my family's been Believers for 50 60 years it doesn't matter any of that are you standing the test today or have we compromised that's are we Sliding Away to another idea to another thought to another Spirit or are we standing on the word amen amen now if he would choose you out of the world and he says that he was going to have a people called out of the church then the denominational Church would really have to be classified as the world ouch it it's kind of rough sounds like we're judgmental no we're realists that's right we're realist brother brandham didn't call him a lodge just because he was angry at them no right he called them a lodge because that was the spirit that was in them what was that Spirit outright unbelief no they believe Jesus is the Christ they believe you need the Holy Ghost they believe he's coming back but there's so much they don't believe yeah and you say but they don't publish that that's right but their life does yes that's right their life does which side the fence are they on that's right or are they straddling amen so I'd say it's a good sign if the world rejects you yeah who are they after all that's right right yes you're trying to impress people that don't even care that's my James 4:7 and8 look at this now how God deals with this he says submit yourselves therefore to God so what is this now if you submit yourself to God that means that you have to reject this world this Kingdom the one who has is sitting on the throne right now see Satan can come today and speak to you and talk about come and sit with me on my Throne because he has been given a throne so he's speaking the very same words that the gospel is speaking and people would say hey I've been invited to sit on the throne but what's beyond the throne Satan doesn't have a sea of Crystal Satan well I I won't go there that's a little bit blunt submit yourself therefore to God see one of the first things we have to do to make this work is actually come to a place of submission yes resist the devil that's our second step and let's just be honest with each other that can be hard sometimes he is such a clever salesman he presents it in such a beautiful fashion look who will like you look how you'll be accepted just temporal though that's right nothing Eternal there it's temporal acceptance that's temporal means I could like you today brother Trevor and disown you tomorrow temporal and when Satan cannot even redeem himself is he going to give his life to redeem you story of Ruth that's right yeah right he would not because he was afraid that it would uh Mar his inheritance which was life he knew if he laid his life down he would be incapable of raising it back up did our lord Jesus ever be recorded as having a fear of raising his life back up he says I'll lay it down for you and I will raise it back up for you amen Ma you talk about selfless sacrifice talk about the giving of one my brother and sister he wasn't afraid to lay his life down he wasn't lukewarm that's right he said we have Redemption and it requires a token and the token must have a price oh that reminds me the note I didn't write down is the token of free gift that's a little thought twister isn't it is the token a free gift almost like Calvinism Armenian ISM we're going to argue both sides of this the token is a free gift after Israel killed the lamb took the hiss up and put the blood over the doorpost it was free wait brother Paul we don't have a Works gospel no but we have an action gospel true God requires an action out of you and I he's not going to come down here and grab your hand and take it out here and grab the lamb and drag the lamb over here and then take your hand and grab the knife and SL lay the lamb and put the blood in the bowl and then take your hand and go out and get a handful of hsip and come back and make you dip that hsip in the blood and then lift your hand to Mark the doorpost yeah right no sir some point in time we have to catch a revelation of who I am and because of I the revelation of who I am I look at the word and the word is a living word problem we're doing my brother and sister we're turning the mess message into a historical gospel God wants it to be a living gospel he has redeemed us he's paid the price he's given everything we need for Redemption and now he doesn't want Works he wants action he wants you to be able to say I believe this and then to apply it to your own life is God going to come down and force you to be a believer absolutely not there has to be something in you that says there's action required here if the word says repent I Repent if the word says be baptized I get baptized if the word says do this I do it not works my brother and sister obedience entirely different category people are by works I can do good things I can do good deeds I'll give to the poor I'll this I'll that my brother and sister that's works but my brother and sister whenever God comes down and starts to move in the life of a son or daughter of God there's something stirs inside of them and that find Fire gets bigger and bigger it's not the fire going out amen remember the little story about the man you know that that had hit the gold you know struck it rich and went out there and his dog is barking and and he he goes out finally he's so upset at the dog barking he kills the dog his rejection now look at that story a little different way our conscience sometimes the Holy Spirit dealing with us barking barking barking I'm not being disrespectful don't misunderstand what do we do we kill our conscience and then the enemy kills us oh my brother and sister you see lot of things in life that we just don't look at it in the correct fashion amen draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you isn't it interesting I hope I hope nobody's upset that I put it this way um isn't it interesting when it comes to courtship there's something this why we must do courtship correctly because there's something in us that draws us nigh to the girl boy something in it draws us nigh and ultimately if we're not careful we can go too far and hug and pet and get in trouble but draw nigh becoming irresistible even if it's accepted in public this right here sometimes is what we settle for fck can just hold her hand imagine courting a girl and you didn't care whether you saw her or not I'll call her when I feel like calling her and if I don't feel like it I won't that's not love I won't go into that but let me just say that's how Satan's got many a Believer when I need something I want to draw nigh when I don't need anything I'm happy just like I am who knew so many things in life would tie together so much I tell you my brother and sister when I was courting sister Jerry the roads were not nearly as nice as they are now to go up there but they was sometimes I drove every weekend to the Tri Cities and I would stay till midnight 1 in the morning morning her parents said you have to be here at the house we would be sitting in the front yard as it were and finally I got to go home and then I had work to do I would sleep on the side of the highway I've slept almost every spot there is to sleep between the Tri Cities and cwell idah home because when you look up in the reflector is saying hi nice to meet you it's time to park but you see my brother and sister I couldn't stay away from her because I loved her amen can we transfer that over to a relationship with Christ amen I can't stay away from him you see how slippery Satan is often times we've become a feast and famine type relationship that we we want to be close to the Lord when we have a need but the Lord said you know sometimes when you ask I don't answer because you asked a miss right one to Heap it to your own lust amen somebody smile at me okay I'm I'm starting to feel like I'm lecturing but what can you say when God lays it on your heart right you say yes sir I'll preach it amen you see what Satan's goal is and and this will tie in here in just a few short minutes this will tie in now to to a quote I'll read to you but what's Satan's goal the destruction of your soul Soul yeah ultimately but remember we're talking about the fact he doesn't have to cause you to go be a drunk or a drug addict or a womanizer or manizer or whatever they call them and and he doesn't has cause you to do that he's just got to break your fellowship and he's fine to let you go to church he's fine for you to confess the name of Christ when he knows the connection's broken that's it so look at this Satan's goal wants to keep you Earthbound he's not even looking at this present moment but ultimately sometimes it's right here in this moment now bear with me I I'm just saying this cuz I want to encourage you believe it or not I believe this is an encouraging service and it's there but look at this my brother and sister how many times have we walked through the doors of church and sit on the Pew and walked out and did not really be blessed was not blessed because there was something else that was all stirred up in our life and we sat here in church and instead of thinking about what God's trying to tell you we think about our problem yeah yeah and so what what's happened we walked out Deliverance was in the room do you believe that every time you come to the house of God that Deliverance is in the house of God Amen that's what the word says amen and so if he can keep you Earthbound thinking about the lack of Finance thinking about this problem or that problem then what is it he's keeping you out of heavenly places keeping you Earthbound and if we're not careful we walk out of church still blaming someone else that's right and that's what I love about being the youngest we always could just take that thing this is Paul wh what what do you mean this is Paul you it can't be my fault but my sister on the other hand it could be her fault yes I need someone to put it on well look there's plenty of somebody's yeah yeah we go in the house of God Satan is already planning a way to keep you Earthbound amen he wants to keep you firmly planted in your your uh bitterness in your animosities in your complexes and all of that thing keeps you firmly Earthbound When God says you're supposed to be in Heavenly places by now prophet of God saying you know what we should have already taken a Rapture well you know it's probably people like me that stopped it well that's better than me saying people like you wouldn't we agree it's better the pastor takes the burden than you but you see what's happened is Satan has made us Earthbound every time that something moves the Holy Spirit comes and really stirs us and we're fixing to let go of a complex we've had a bitterness we've had and it's so and then just as we're fixing to take a step into Heavenly places Satan comes in and firmly back to the ground again and then we wonder why is there not victory in the church well that's cuz like a plane you're grounded you can't fly in that condition we all get upset when you're at the airport and they say we have a maintenance issue on this plane and it'll be a little bit sister Jerry and I we went to Canada had that issue we're sitting there man that plane's set there for an hour why didn't they fix it then and then you stop and you think I don't really care when they figured out it had a problem I'm just glad they want to fix the problem cuz I don't think us putting our hands out the window doing this is going to make any difference so you see it doesn't matter what stage it is in our life or relationships and all of these things just be thankful that God would expose the deficiency amen and help us Lord to get off the ground that's right amen now Satan wants to keep you Earthbound which is nothing more than a state of defeat that's right you know every time Revival sweeps the church Satan's right behind it with problems and we act like every single time that it's some new Starling thing that happened we had a glorious Revival and Trouble Follows right behind it oh my goodness what happened de we had such a beautiful time that's right God loves you enough he pull the Hedge back and say you know what you rejoice then I want to see what you're going to do now yes will you still Rejoice no I can't Rejoice it's just too hard month from that oh the promises are true thank God I'm the bride why don't we equal this out I don't want to ride a plane that does this you have to wonder is the pilot awake is there a pilot but he said I will lead you and I will guide guide you when it goes like this Saints are hands just like they would on an airplane I've seen this happen we have seen people pull their crucifixes out faster than you can take a breath look like the plane's going to slam down on a Runway and they just magically appear and they're like and you're like what's that when the roller coaster goes down the hands go up that's right when the plane starts to go down the hands go up amen When Trials come and Satan tries to blow you into the to the Dead Fall the hands go up but the normal reaction of humanity I'm sorry to just labor on this but normal reaction of humanity is we run into a roadblock and you know what happens hands go down head goes down woe is me you want to know how I can preach that I've practiced it am and we shouldn't preach it unless we practice it amen I've done that Saints but I tell you God's coming and reminding this bride this chosen bride that he has chosen out of the Nations every Kindred Every Nation every tongue and he's teaching her when the adversary comes amen you you just wait because I'm there to raise up a wall against him be patient before you start saying oh woe is me Woe Is Me Lord why did you let this happen stop and say I'm going to stand right here and I'm going to see the Deliverance of the Lord I'm going to see the power of God come and change this situation because Satan you have no control over my destiny you know we forget about that right if you've ever had a situation I don't want to go into it but you ever have a situation that is so extreme that it just feels like it has blown you to pieces and you get there and and our reaction is always to be whoa where are you God why didn't God why didn't God come and just come right over real close to us and and say I'm here that's what we'd like isn't it for God to come real close to us and say yeah I'm right here you know why he doesn't do that cuz he already said he was right there this is his voice amen this is his word this is him that's it just like he couldn't heal you or do anything anything more for you than he's already done because he's already healed you amen by God's grace we have the answer now I'm going to I'm just move along here real quick I didn't realize time was fleeting well I knew time was fleeting I didn't know it's this fleeting Ephesians 47-8 and 21- 24 and I'm just going to uh bounce through this real quick every uh one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ now you know what's interesting I I I just want to be you know a little straightforward with you I'm such a knucklehead I think God's probably given me more grace than he gave most of you and I'm not going to ask if you agree cuz some of you might actually agree but you look at that maybe I to make my point maybe I got more grace than you did but I needed it right and God didn't say oh it's too bad I didn't give you enough Grace he's given us sufficient that's good thank you brother David enough can we believe the word should we believe the word then let's confess it that's right I made a mistake but I've been given enough Grace to overcome this mistake this life that God called me to I didn't call myself to this life he called me to this life and he's provided for every single thing that I need to make it through this life and come out and I don't care if I stood next to a brother who has been an absolute Saint his whole life never made any drastic mistakes never went off the rails never anything I stand there next to him I'm going to declare I'm just as much a Son of God as you are amen because I've been given Grace sufficient for my need and I'm going to stand here today and confess that because it was God's Gift Sir Paul didn't choose it Paul didn't make it happen it was God's Gift hallelujah amen now here I want to in verse eight if you'll just look at verse eight when he ascended up on high we always have all these problems and we blame the devil sometimes I think the devil's right out here on the step of the church well that step would be better CU he can sit on the steps he's out there crying cuz we blame him for things he knows he's not in control of boy y'all look at me with this sheep eyes well you're all sheep so you no he's getting blamed sometimes because you see right here if we could really believe the word for what it says he's already LED captivity amen captive amen captivity is not free reign in your life it is got a quote for it if you need it because we stepped out from underneath the blood now if we stepped out from underneath the blood where does that put us lukew a borderline garment hand out of the word foot out of the word it doesn't stop there erosion is eternal we believe the Earth was created right yeah did it look like it looks now when it was created think so no no so when you get out from underneath the blood just a finger if you don't change the course it'll soon be your hand and you don't change that course it'll soon be a foot and then we'll come to a place that marriages are in Jeopardy children have gone crazy everything is what we'd say why Lord but you see we allowed it to happen God's not going to grabb you Saints and drag you back under he might grab your heart but he's not going to cause your flesh to obey we get this idea that because we're in the message we believe God sent a Prophet this can't happen to us I'm here to tell you it can happen to us and it's time for us to wake up yeah amen have our own woke moment Amen to wake up to realize Satan not you we're not talking about you don't misunderstand that I'm talking about you Satan is so clever that he's going to give us a reason that's it and we fall into the Trap and then wonder why it is let me Skip Along here so as you look at this well how about maybe you guys would agree Ephesians 4:7 how about just Ephesians 4 homework go home read all of Ephesians 4 it's a tremendous chapter because it really gives insight to what is happening we look at this my brother and sister that we hear him been taught by him and the truth is in him amen that's where we need to stay and we got to remember captivity has been LED captive am there's not one thing here that you can offer as an excuse of why you're not on fire for God and if you don't mind I'll just point these fingers right back at Paul amen because I'm not here to preach down to you I'm here to give the warning God laid on my heart that if we're not careful this will creep into our lives and we won't even recognize it won't even recognize it h down in Florida woman disappeared she was walking across the Lawn Lawn and all fell in gone giant hole in the ground right there not one bit of sight of that woman Satan I'm going to type this natural spiritual been eroding away not overnight for years turns out there's Cavern there and all that was the dirt that we were secure to walk on and live in and just slowly eroding away and then poof they're not going to go search for it because there's weird noises down there and it has twists and turns and they're like well don't know that we should sacrifice someone when it's pretty obvious that her and all the dirt completely disappeared my brother and sister people disappear out of the church like this and we say did we offend them maybe someone did but the scripture says that we don't take offense oh did I step on something I shouldn't have cuz I want to ask you I I just feel very if you take offense maybe they shouldn't have said what they said done what they did did but the real Spirit to take offense is our spirit God help us Satan slippery coming right in breaks off Fellowship we blame the other person we blame the pastor we blame this we blame that why don't we just stop look in the mirror and say why was I offended about that maybe if we would humble ourselves and repent restoration would come God help us H so if Ephesians if you would take it as homework please now I've got so many scriptures it tells us not to be in Romans 12 not to be conformed to the world but be transformed conformed is to comply with and transformed is to be changed see there a lot of difference right there my brother and sister when the world molds you and when Christ molds you are they even similar no no they do not produce the same results Romans 12 1 through3 now count down please brother Chris amen oh this screen has okay doesn't matter about this screen but now friends may I say this has come to the age of the astronaut we have moved out of the airplane age we got more power now now remember that this is a prophet of God not teaching us aerodynamics it's the prophet of God preaching word to us we've moved out of the airplane age we got more power now the astronaut age has come in what is it not we've come into a spiritual age of astronauts see going above it's not this it it's not it's the same Spirit only more power right you know you can preach that the the the word has changed and the bride this and the bride that but God just took his Eternal Word and just poured more power in it and when he poured power in it my brother and sister it was actually you and I that changed only more power only lifted higher can go higher see more believe more be more like Christ not the O automobile not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above each one it's called The Eagle age in the Bible God calls His prophets Eagle age we realize over in the Bible we find in Malachi 4 that were promised that in the last days now he likes His prophets to Eagles he calls himself Eagle he is the great Jehovah Eagle he is able to achieve to himself a bride that right there is a startling statement he is able to achieve to himself a bride but wait we have prophets teachers evangelists pastors every one of them is God's achievement our pastor is the greatest Pastor ever okay I wouldn't even argue it's just God if he is the best preacher ever it's just God so when we go to give praise we're going to give praise to God that's right there's where it comes down amen uh that with a ministry that's so exactly like a man and his wife becomes one and when Jehovah gets his people like him he's working to get us like him then he lives in his people ain't that awesome such Simplicity yeah praise God I am different than the world out here amen Hallelujah God lives in me amen thank you Lord I mean my it goes to prove you know some he lives in a 20 room house and some he lives in a little dinky Shack on the side of whatever but he's living in me but we like the more spiritual we like the better dressed all quotes right you know what I'm talking about but God said God said prophet's voice it'll make that silk dress hug that gingham gown that's right cuz it's not the external cloak it's Christ Living in the person lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture exactly like he said in St John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also it also fulfilled what Jesus said to take place as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now I want to ask you a question right here we're fixing the close sister Ruth as you'll come Whoever thought it would come this far I can remember years ago we were still over in the other building I preached this is Sodom the rapture's coming soon cuz it can't get any worse I laugh at myself now because I missed that Mark like so far can't get any worse my brother and sister back in them days pronoun was part of writing a sentence yeah and now it's a whole identity right perverted one but still an identity see so we're coming into the Fulfillment now do you realize as much as you who wants to volunteer husband and wife to be the victim I mean the example as much as we fuss as husband and wife [Music] When God says you're perfect you're perfect it's not the husband's fault it's not the wife's fault it's the flesh amen I'm just want to stir your minds up what if the bride as we spoke on job righteous and upright man and God still tests him what if we're in just the continued time of testing and God's actually waiting for Sodom to come to fruition see often times we preach it like oh we've got to get ourselves ready get ourselves ready I want to ask you my brother and sister if you have have the idea that Enoch and job and all of those men never made a mistake you're mistaken and God called them righteous and upright and men after his own heart I'm not trying to tell us to let down actually this should cause us to just turn it up a little bit but you see Satan wants you to believe it's your fault oh yeah you're the one you're inadequate you're unworthy but God said you're worthy that's right God said he's put everything in you that you need Amen to make it in this journey amen so don't let Satan turn this back on you that you're not good enough and will never be good enough God could be letting I'm just saying this in a context God could be letting the last little bit of the cup of iniquity to be filled up CU I don't want to blow you away but I want to put this out to you do you not face some of the same battles today that you faced a year [Music] ago you not have Satan try to build a nest in your head today just like he did a year ago are you going to stop the devil from trying to build a nest in your head no no but the prophet said when he's trying you don't let him that's right so does that mean that battle's going away I think it will get more intense myself cuz Satan sees you for who you are and he wants to stop you and if he has to just ratchet it up and cause you battle after battle struggle after struggle whether he wants to come in the mind and fight with you if he wants to come in the flesh sickness and disease and fight with you you see it's a balanced picture Prophet says you'll be ready right on time why don't we accept that part of the message we will be ready right on time Saints don't let the devil pull it over on you take a hold to the promised word stand upon that word and realize now let me finish this real quick and then we're done as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man I have to admit I never quite thought Sodom looked like this but this is Sodom so it shall be in the coming of son of man now is the astronaut age and the astronaut sees things that the horse rider automobile and airplane either sees so truly in this day by the words of a prophet we're seeing more of the word of God than they have in any age and you notice the scripture doesn't say that our day without them it says them without us that's right so when you feel defeated you feel struggle you have these things remember God chose His best for the most wicked age that the Earth will ever see Apostle Paul have more value than [Music] you no sounds boastful doesn't it but it's the truth God used them to set the gospel and they live the gospel for their day and you're sitting here today in the most deceiving darkest age ever and God's Shining Light On You amen Revelation amen is opening up to you who you are amen hold on to it Church don't let the devil take that away from you the airplane still down here bouncing around in the clouds and having blowouts and hit downs and everything else but he goes beyond the clouds of Creeds and denomination moves on up in the heavens Plum away from everything the astronaut age we are living in the astronaut age amen my church age book you know the astronaut age is in there so seven Church ages but we have a you know kind of like government regulations we have a subpart b part 131 well I'm telling you the astronaut age is in there amen God is giving it we're living the aster just as sure as God is testified by the natural happenings there so is he testifying now that if if we've achieved an astronaut God has achieved what he promised to achieve in the last days according to Malachi 4 only one thing he has to do is get somebody any somebody's here get somebody in his hands that can cut loose from the airplanes and the Automobiles and what more not not look back to what it was come on Saints let's bring this let's bring this message these words of a prophet let's bring them current to this day right here but how come on I I don't I'm not being negative I don't mean to be but what do we we often times we're referring back amen we're looking at the power the manifestation of the word we're looking back why not not look up and claim it for oursel why not allow us did the prophet himself not say that we have now a second book of Acts if we were writing the second book of Acts I wonder what it would look like I rebuked the fever and the fever didn't go away why Lord I feel defeated all the time lord and seems to be no end in sight why Lord would that be our book of Acts absolutely not Saints it's time for us to get out of the horse and buggy and start moving forward maybe our life testifies it let's let our voice testify it am I preaching too long thank you cuz sometimes it only takes one lift him up in the presence but more power okay not look back to what it was but more power to lift him higher lift him into the presence of God lift him up there where all things are possible now see it's happening there is no doubt to it so does the spiritual astronaut as the natural astronaut goes on above the Plaines the planes always wrecking up fussing in the clouds everything like that there can be nothing greater no more achievement than the astronaut amen do I need need to interpret that for you or did you get it there is no greater achievement than you it's time we believe that instead of looking at the negative and looking at what's wrong in our life God chose you you are the greater achievement amen amen only thing he has to do is just keep putting more power he'll go anywhere he wants to see because he's done gone into space isn't this beautiful airplanes still down wrecking fussing grounded everything like that but the astronaut don't have to be grounded he goes on above the clouds he goes on on above above the Creed on above the denomination on above those who Say It Isn't So It Isn't So he has got a guide the Holy Spirit the word tells him so am and he moves on Amen let's stand I know I preached way too long and I I apologize amen but look at this my brother and sister you see what's what's the word doing it's telling us keep going aim higher trust more Let the power of God be deposited in you as you move
