[30:53] [Music]
[30:58] amen there is lord aren't you thankful
[31:00] tonight that we have victory in jesus
[31:03] name we tried to have victory in
[31:04] ourselves but we failed every single
[31:06] time
[31:07] until we discovered victories in jesus
[31:09] amen
[31:10] praise the lord why don't we stand
[31:12] tonight thank you musicians
[31:20] yes it's good to see by the trevor back
[31:23] man brother david looking forward to
[31:25] seeing
[31:25] sunday
[31:30] amen
[31:32] i'm gonna put that up
[31:37] hope this make sure this works
[31:40] real quick okay there we go
[31:43] let's go to the scripture second
[31:45] corinthians chapter three
[31:48] it's on the screen only if you don't
[31:50] have a bible
[31:53] otherwise exercise your sword
[31:59] second corinthians chapter 3 verse 12.
[32:06] praise of war
[32:10] seeing then that we have such hope we
[32:12] use great plainness
[32:14] of speech aren't you glad god speaks so
[32:18] plainly
[32:20] we don't have to use big words to be all
[32:22] fancy
[32:23] to confuse everybody i read a lot of
[32:26] blogs
[32:28] at work to figure out problems
[32:31] solutions to problems and whenever i
[32:32] start reading one and that guy is just
[32:34] going all nerd on me
[32:36] i move right on because you can't
[32:38] understand it
[32:40] because people try to use big words to
[32:42] sound smart
[32:44] but if you have to use big words to
[32:45] sound smart you don't understand what
[32:47] you're explaining
[32:50] but true revelation of christ comes in
[32:53] plainness of speech
[32:55] people will try to speak to you about
[32:57] god and they'll get all
[32:59] confusing with big words not
[33:02] every single time but amen i'm glad all
[33:05] i'm trying to say is i'm glad that the
[33:06] lord uses plainness of speech
[33:08] verse 13 and now as moses which put a
[33:11] veil over his face that the children of
[33:13] israel could not steadfastly look to the
[33:15] end
[33:16] of that which is abolished but their
[33:18] minds were blinded
[33:20] for until this day remaineth the same
[33:22] veil on taken away in the reading
[33:26] of the old testament which veil
[33:29] is done away in christ but
[33:32] even unto this day when moses is read
[33:36] the veil is upon their heart
[33:39] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[33:41] lord the veil shall be taken away
[33:45] amen now the lord is that spirit
[33:49] and where the spirit of the lord is
[33:51] there is
[33:52] liberty but we all with open face
[33:56] beholding as in the glass
[34:00] the glory of the lord with open face
[34:02] unveiled
[34:04] are changed into the same image
[34:08] so we're unveiled beholding as in a
[34:11] glass the glory of the lord
[34:13] and we're being changed into that image
[34:16] from glory to glory even by as by
[34:20] a man's idea even as by the spirit
[34:25] of the lord let's bow our heads heavenly
[34:28] father lord jesus
[34:32] we come to you tonight seeking lord to
[34:35] hear from you lord jesus
[34:38] father we've come here lord we've
[34:41] done our our part brought together our
[34:44] licks of fire lord jesus
[34:46] eager to hear what you want to say
[34:48] tonight lord
[34:49] we pray that as always looking forward
[34:52] to you keeping your word lord jesus
[34:55] you're not a i hope so god father you're
[34:58] a do so
[34:59] lord you do what your word says lord you
[35:02] keep your promises you're not a man that
[35:03] you could lie
[35:04] i pray that you just take these words
[35:06] lord jesus
[35:08] father this your servant lord may you i
[35:11] just want to step out of the way lord
[35:12] i want to hear from you tonight or just
[35:14] as much as my brothers and sisters here
[35:16] father
[35:17] i pray you'd speak for jesus to us
[35:19] father lip to ear lord
[35:21] live to heart father may we have an ear
[35:23] to hear tonight what the spirit is
[35:25] saying unto us lord jesus
[35:27] revelation is what's going to get us out
[35:29] of here and
[35:30] into your arms sooner and that's the
[35:32] whole point lord we love you father we
[35:34] thank you now
[35:35] in jesus name we pray amen you may be
[35:38] seated tonight
[35:41] so my title tonight is reflections of
[35:44] the king
[35:46] i didn't put my subtitle on there
[35:48] unfortunately but it's christ
[35:49] unveiled amen but the mountain
[35:53] says in the quote
[35:56] um well see this is what happens when i
[35:59] do slides i forget one in there
[36:01] he says in the quote uh the unveiling of
[36:03] god which
[36:04] i don't think i have a quote that's not
[36:06] from that sermon so we'll just blanket
[36:08] statement it's gonna be from the
[36:09] unveiling of god
[36:11] but he says the unveiled god plain view
[36:14] they should have seen him standing there
[36:18] yet he was too common he was an ordinary
[36:21] man they couldn't see it
[36:23] see there stood a man well they said
[36:25] this guy what school did he come from
[36:28] see where were their thoughts already
[36:31] you ever meet somebody with and
[36:33] someone's already told you about them
[36:35] maybe good may be bad when you meet that
[36:37] person you go oh i see it whether it's
[36:40] good or bad because you're
[36:41] basing your introduction on a
[36:44] preconceived
[36:45] idea so already they're used to holy men
[36:49] coming from a great school from a
[36:51] pharisee or a sadducee which
[36:54] um incidentally they brought over from
[36:56] babylon
[36:58] it's in the message you can find that
[37:00] and so they have these great religious
[37:02] uh systems and so they meet this man
[37:04] that's supposed to be a holy man
[37:06] and the first thing they ask is what
[37:09] school did he come from
[37:10] they don't give him a chance he says but
[37:12] remember when that spear struck his body
[37:15] that spirit left him
[37:16] the temple the sacrifices blocks turned
[37:19] over and the lightning whipped down
[37:21] through the temple
[37:22] and rent the veil that's what the lord
[37:24] does he tears up our ideas
[37:26] amen our traditions our organization
[37:29] amen when god
[37:30] comes in his sovereignty his grace he
[37:33] turns that upside down
[37:35] he goes on to say he says what was it
[37:37] there was their god
[37:38] hanging on calvary and they were too
[37:41] blind
[37:42] to see it brought him an open few and
[37:45] still they don't see it they are blinded
[37:47] god
[37:47] failed in a human being amen so christ
[37:51] was in plain view
[37:53] when the veil was rent after he died on
[37:55] the cross that but yet the jews didn't
[37:58] realize it
[37:58] we have scripture that says they were
[38:00] blinded for our sake
[38:02] but they were still given the
[38:03] opportunity and god christ is the same
[38:06] yesterday today and forever and so there
[38:09] are scriptures for the people who are
[38:11] blinded today
[38:13] yet we preach the gospel and yet we
[38:15] desire for their eyes to be open because
[38:17] even
[38:18] in the midst jews eyes were open amen
[38:21] but
[38:21] god was veiled and when god does
[38:23] something
[38:25] a certain way for a certain thing he
[38:28] doesn't ever
[38:29] change that amen that is why the
[38:30] scripture says he is jesus christ the
[38:32] same yesterday today
[38:33] and forever you can even
[38:37] in the secular world look at history
[38:40] because history repeats itself
[38:41] and you can say okay what's going to
[38:43] happen in this scenario
[38:45] and when they collect data to say all
[38:46] right if we give an ad
[38:48] and what happens when we give an
[38:49] advertisement and what and all this
[38:51] stuff because it just
[38:52] repeats itself and um
[38:56] amen praise the lord so he was missed
[38:58] behind the veil
[39:00] the veil of christ when that veil writ
[39:03] he was telling them it's not there
[39:06] anymore
[39:07] it's behind skin human skin
[39:11] amen the renting of the badger skin
[39:13] introduced where christ was moving
[39:15] to amen brother brennan picks up this
[39:17] word in morphe which means
[39:19] always was just now revealed changing
[39:22] his mask
[39:23] he says so um god changed his
[39:26] his mass god didn't change who he was
[39:29] because he's elohim
[39:31] he that always existed you can't change
[39:35] god remember god can change you amen
[39:38] god was in morphe so he stepped from
[39:41] behind
[39:42] the veil of badger skin and he was in
[39:45] the veil of jesus
[39:46] the skin the human skin and then then he
[39:50] was
[39:50] poured out on the day of pentecost and
[39:53] we have a scripture here
[39:54] amen joel chapter 2 verse 28 to 32 and
[39:58] it shall come to pass
[39:59] afterward that i will pour out my spirit
[40:01] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[40:04] daughters shall prophesy
[40:05] your old men shall dream dreams your
[40:08] young men shall see
[40:09] visions and also upon the servants and
[40:11] upon the handmaids in those days will i
[40:13] pour out my spirit
[40:15] and i will show wonders in the heavens
[40:17] and in the earth
[40:18] blood and fire and pillars of smoke the
[40:20] sun shall be turned into darkness and
[40:22] the moon into blood before the great and
[40:24] terrible day of the lord come
[40:25] and also come to pass that whosoever
[40:27] shall call in the name of the lord shall
[40:29] be delivered
[40:30] for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall
[40:32] be deliverance as the lord hath said
[40:35] and in the remnant who the lord shall
[40:37] call
[40:38] and then brother branham says now when
[40:41] it said here that he
[40:42] emptied himself or poured out now we
[40:45] would think like this he's speaking of
[40:47] joel
[40:48] that he vomit up the english word of
[40:50] empty or poured out
[40:52] from him see something went out of him
[40:53] that was different from him but the word
[40:56] you know he says kenosis but the table
[40:59] says kinos
[41:00] so it's kenosis but i left it i didn't
[41:03] correct it because in case you wanted to
[41:04] go find the quote
[41:06] it is misspelled but in the greek does
[41:08] not mean that he vomit up or some his
[41:11] arm went off or his eye would out
[41:12] another person
[41:14] that is he changed himself he poured
[41:16] himself
[41:17] into amen into another mask so he was in
[41:21] more
[41:21] faith and he in and kenosis he was
[41:24] pouring himself
[41:25] into amen into well we're going to get
[41:28] there
[41:29] he changed himself he poured himself
[41:31] into amen into another mask
[41:33] into another form not another person
[41:35] went out of him called the holy spirit
[41:37] but it was he
[41:38] himself you get it he himself poured
[41:42] himself
[41:42] into the people christ in you how
[41:45] beautiful how wonderful to think god
[41:47] pouring himself
[41:48] into the human being into the believer
[41:52] pour out it was a part of his drama to
[41:54] do so
[41:55] god all the fullness all the godhead
[41:58] bodily was in this person
[41:59] jesus christ amen so all that god was
[42:03] was poured into jesus and all that jesus
[42:06] was
[42:07] was poured into you and i the holy
[42:09] spirit it wasn't another person as
[42:11] brother bannon says here in the quote
[42:13] it was kenosis it was god pouring
[42:15] himself
[42:16] and changing his mask because he could
[42:18] jesus
[42:20] christ and flesh couldn't pour himself
[42:22] into you so he had to in morphe
[42:24] into the holy spirit and then pour
[42:26] himself into you but it was still
[42:28] always christ i mean that's where the
[42:31] the the denominations and people that
[42:33] believe in the trinity they get so
[42:34] confused
[42:35] because it was hid their eyes are
[42:37] blinded it's hid behind the veil of the
[42:40] word of god which brother phantom says
[42:42] also i highly recommend going and
[42:44] listening to this sermon
[42:46] i haven't finished it yet but praise the
[42:48] lord
[42:49] this time around i should say it was a
[42:52] part of his drama to do so
[42:54] god all the fullness all the godhead
[42:55] bodily okay he was god and god
[42:58] alone not a third person or a second
[42:59] person or a first person but
[43:02] the person god veiled in human flesh
[43:06] and then kenosis poured out so now we
[43:10] have
[43:11] amen god behind a skin
[43:14] veil now the badger skin
[43:17] veiled god in the wilderness
[43:21] and so underneath the ministry of moses
[43:23] amen
[43:24] the the christ was veiled behind the
[43:27] badger
[43:28] but underneath the new dispensation of
[43:30] grace the ministry of
[43:32] christ amen god was be was poor was
[43:35] in the holy spirit was poured into the
[43:37] church the bride
[43:39] and now amen he was with human skin on
[43:42] it
[43:43] amen from old to new amen when god came
[43:47] into your life
[43:48] and god poured himself into you amen
[43:51] you put the badger skin behind you put
[43:54] you put that carnal skin behind you
[43:56] and you stepped into as a new creation
[43:59] in christ jesus but you're still behind
[44:02] skin amen the flesh
[44:04] that we have to fight and keep
[44:06] underneath control but we have been
[44:08] given an example a man of exactly how to
[44:10] do that
[44:11] so christ went back into human skin
[44:13] again on the day
[44:14] of pentecost amen hebrews 13 8
[44:18] jesus christ is the same yesterday
[44:20] that's kind of small can you see that
[44:22] today and forever okay so this is what i
[44:25] love
[44:26] about the word of god amen it's always
[44:30] the same it doesn't ever change
[44:34] so when you read a promise to israel
[44:36] it's a promise to you
[44:38] when you read a promise to the the the
[44:41] um
[44:42] in the word of god that was written
[44:44] thousands of years ago guess what it's
[44:46] still a promise for you today
[44:48] and if god did it for them he's bound
[44:51] to do it to you because god follows the
[44:54] only his own laws he has to
[44:56] he's bound to them because it is him
[44:59] yeah i can't be anything besides chris
[45:03] because that's who i am if i try to
[45:06] express somebody else it just gets weird
[45:09] but if i it but so christ
[45:12] because he made the law he spoke it his
[45:14] thoughts expressed
[45:16] he has to manifest that because he is
[45:19] bound to his word because his word
[45:21] is him amen so
[45:24] um we're building uh up tonight here so
[45:28] we'll step
[45:28] over here the veil of tradition brother
[45:31] branham says
[45:32] to and today the veil of tradition hides
[45:35] the word again
[45:36] saying it's not so so we have
[45:39] we have a paradox or or a um
[45:43] a scenario if you will amen you have a
[45:47] veil
[45:48] you want to be hid behind the veil in
[45:50] christ
[45:51] but that same veil hides you from the
[45:54] world
[45:55] so when he says the veil of tradition
[45:57] hides the word he's not saying
[45:59] that the word is in tradition
[46:02] he's saying that the word people in
[46:05] tradition
[46:06] are veiled to the true word
[46:09] he did not say worldly people
[46:12] he did not say heathens here he did not
[46:15] say denominational people here
[46:17] he said tradition
[46:21] traditions of religion can hide god
[46:24] from the people how do we know that
[46:27] because it happened in the bible
[46:29] it happened in god's word and now we
[46:32] have
[46:32] amen the messenger bringing it to us in
[46:34] this way
[46:36] so we look back into the scriptures and
[46:39] we see how
[46:40] the jews christ was there out in the
[46:43] open what do they say today oh if i
[46:44] could see him
[46:45] i would believe yet
[46:50] christ was in flesh
[46:53] in their midst and they didn't see him
[46:56] they called him beelzebub
[47:00] they say they say well if you just show
[47:02] me i can
[47:03] you know i can science i can see it
[47:06] i got to see it to believe it but if
[47:09] they could
[47:10] they wouldn't and then i preached a
[47:12] sermon one time i don't remember
[47:14] what it what the title or anything was
[47:16] but i was talking about
[47:18] the woman that washes the feet of jesus
[47:21] and we say oh my goodness if if i was
[47:25] if i was um what's the guy's name
[47:28] the pharisee nobody else remembers
[47:31] if i was simon i think it was simon
[47:35] invited jesus over
[47:37] you say well if i was him i would have
[47:39] made sure jesus
[47:41] had clean feet but
[47:45] yet those same people that say that
[47:48] don't
[47:49] right jesus like brother random priest
[47:51] of sermon is in the corner with dirty
[47:52] feet because you say
[47:54] when you see it in the past you say oh i
[47:57] would never do that but it's
[47:58] repeated today um so
[48:02] a veil was cast over their eyes
[48:05] amen it wasn't
[48:09] and brother brown doesn't say
[48:10] denomination tradition
[48:12] like i said he just says tradition um
[48:15] so message church tradition
[48:19] we spent too much time talking about how
[48:23] it's the denominations and it
[48:26] slipped in we preached
[48:30] at the nominations out of the mark of
[48:32] the beast and it
[48:33] slipped in the signs of the times
[48:37] um amen message church traditions
[48:40] church traditions for us oh well we sing
[48:43] for 30 minutes
[48:45] the preacher preaches for an hour or two
[48:49] special songs on sunday ever notice that
[48:53] rarely a song special is sung on
[48:54] wednesday
[48:56] unspoken prayer requests that's a good
[48:58] one some
[48:59] you know same person every sunday has
[49:01] that our unspoken request
[49:03] everybody wonders when god when they're
[49:06] going to accept anyways
[49:11] and they say we say oh the one no i'm
[49:14] talking about nothing about you think
[49:15] about people like you that are
[49:17] stuck in tradition i say oh
[49:20] order now order now
[49:23] careful not to express yourself too much
[49:26] you might encourage the preacher to keep
[49:28] preaching
[49:29] you know how you've been there in the
[49:31] services where you're tired
[49:33] and somebody's just shouting and amen
[49:35] and you're like if they would be quiet
[49:37] we could wrap this up sunday we go in
[49:44] our best suit
[49:46] oh we just we got it all crisp
[49:50] three piece wednesday we stream
[49:55] i get any laughs on that one
[50:01] after church we'll eat that this
[50:03] specific restaurant
[50:06] you're sitting in church wondering what
[50:07] you should order
[50:13] you'll never find god in tradition
[50:19] tradition is death
[50:23] christ is life they can't go together
[50:28] why why is it that tradition is such a
[50:31] big topic
[50:32] why is it labored over and over and over
[50:34] again in the message
[50:36] in the bible because tradition
[50:39] gives you a false sense of hope
[50:42] tradition gives you a
[50:43] false sense of revelation i know
[50:46] people who are message believers it's
[50:49] all in their head
[50:50] they're following a tradition not so
[50:53] much
[50:53] church this and church now like i said
[50:55] but a tradition of
[50:58] the words of the message the phrases of
[51:02] the message they got the quote
[51:04] to line up they can talk like it but
[51:06] they're speaking
[51:08] through tradition those pharisees they
[51:10] could put a pin in the scroll and tell
[51:12] you where everywhere it
[51:13] hit yet they missed christ
[51:17] it's not about knowing the message word
[51:19] for word better
[51:21] it's about knowing christ better
[51:24] and you find him in the word that's why
[51:27] we don't read the message like a church
[51:28] age
[51:29] excuse me a newspaper the bible like a
[51:31] newspaper because a newspaper you can
[51:33] memorize it
[51:34] you can memorize a or or a stanza of a
[51:37] famous poem and then you can quote it
[51:39] and sound all romantic
[51:40] but um the bible is not that way it's a
[51:44] living word and it doesn't come
[51:45] into you through memorization it comes
[51:48] into you through the anointing and the
[51:51] spirit of christ
[51:52] that's why you have to we have to come
[51:55] to church
[51:56] and we have to hear a preacher
[51:59] because that's god's provided way of
[52:02] worship
[52:03] you see i was thinking as i was
[52:05] listening to the sermon the unveiling of
[52:07] god
[52:07] and i was thinking about how god's
[52:09] provided way of worship
[52:11] is behind the veil amen god's provided
[52:14] way worship is in his bride which is
[52:17] behind the veil
[52:18] which is covering the word that's why
[52:20] it's a secret
[52:22] you can't make it a show because if you
[52:24] make it a show you pull it
[52:27] outside of the veil and when it's
[52:29] outside of the veil it's no longer of
[52:31] god
[52:33] so watch when somebody gets too much
[52:35] into
[52:36] the appearance watch when a
[52:39] church or a preacher or or an idea of
[52:42] the message becomes about the show
[52:45] there's something missing because
[52:48] they're going for what they think
[52:49] it should look like i was praying in the
[52:52] back tonight lord
[52:53] because sometimes as a preacher i come
[52:55] out with a with a preconceived idea of
[52:57] of the delivery of the sermon i said
[53:00] lord i don't want to come out here with
[53:02] how i think it should be said how i
[53:05] i have the words that he's given me and
[53:08] i believe those words
[53:09] will come but i don't want to try to
[53:11] preach it evangelistical when you wanted
[53:14] us
[53:14] in teaching i don't want to try to come
[53:17] out here and
[53:17] and then you know send you all to the
[53:19] altar when the lord's not wanting to
[53:21] work that way
[53:21] it's like lord help me to come out and
[53:24] work the way
[53:25] you see fit you see we have to be
[53:28] sensitive to the moving of the holy
[53:30] spirit in everything that we do
[53:32] lord is is what i'm doing every
[53:34] reflection of you
[53:36] that's our title it's not reflections of
[53:38] the king
[53:40] amen so behind the veil
[53:45] same sermon brother battle says in type
[53:47] moses coming from the presence of god
[53:49] with the word of god for that age now
[53:52] watch we're now in
[53:53] exodus 19 don't miss this now
[53:58] moses is coming from the presence of god
[54:00] moses is coming for the prince of god he
[54:02] has been
[54:02] into the word the word has been wrote in
[54:06] the presence of god with the word he had
[54:08] the word for that age there is a word
[54:10] for each age
[54:12] and moses coming forth his face shined
[54:15] so see
[54:16] the word was in him ready to be
[54:17] manifested
[54:19] give out to the people the true word god
[54:23] had wrote it
[54:26] it was with moses notice it was with
[54:28] moses and was ready to be manifested
[54:31] he was the word to them he was the
[54:34] living word
[54:35] hid veiled himself moses had to put a
[54:39] veil over his own face
[54:42] because it was shining so brightly but
[54:43] it was a type that the word is behind
[54:45] the veil
[54:46] why he was that word amen until that
[54:49] word was made known
[54:50] made known moses had to veil himself
[54:54] do you see it wherever the word is it's
[54:57] failed
[54:59] so now we say wherever the word is it's
[55:02] veil that we have to pray
[55:04] because the only way to step through the
[55:06] veil and we'll get to that quote
[55:08] is by revelation revelation it takes
[55:11] revelation to see
[55:13] you can't convince somebody to see they
[55:15] might act like
[55:16] it man but they're just putting on a
[55:19] show
[55:20] they've never been behind the veil but
[55:21] if they catch a revelation
[55:24] you can't tell them otherwise
[55:33] amen so the bride behind the veil
[55:36] it's a little nugget to think about
[55:40] the reflection now if you see a
[55:43] reflection
[55:45] you know what to look for to see
[55:48] the real you can see a picture of
[55:51] somebody and then you can find them
[55:52] based on that picture
[55:54] that picture is a reflection of of them
[55:57] now brother baum says in the message
[56:00] well the same message
[56:02] he says notice death to stay away from
[56:05] it now
[56:06] he's talking about he's talking about
[56:07] how in the in the tabernacle in the
[56:09] wilderness it was death to go
[56:11] into it but he says now amen christ in
[56:14] morphe and the holy spirit in the church
[56:16] now it's death to stay away from it you
[56:19] must go he says you must go into it
[56:21] through
[56:21] this veil or you won't how
[56:24] god could have mercy
[56:28] on them but remember what it was that
[56:30] god is manifesting what was behind that
[56:32] veil watch what was behind the veil the
[56:35] word
[56:36] what did it fail the word what was it
[56:39] it's in the ark it was the word
[56:41] that that veil hid see and jesus was
[56:45] that word and he is that word and the
[56:47] veil of his
[56:48] flesh hid it amen so you have to go
[56:52] through the veil
[56:56] if if if to get to the word of god in
[56:59] the tabernacle in the wilderness
[57:01] you had to go through the veil it's
[57:03] going to be the same thing today you
[57:05] have to pass through the veil to get to
[57:07] the word of god
[57:08] and to get to the word of god is to
[57:11] become a
[57:12] reflection of the king amen
[57:15] amen this comes this comes from
[57:17] something that was said
[57:19] a couple services ago and i wrote it
[57:22] down it was a little bit differently
[57:23] than i wrote it down
[57:25] but i can find it here
[57:36] the bride's dress is a reflection of the
[57:39] king
[57:40] the bride's dress isn't a reflection of
[57:42] her
[57:43] it's a reflection of the king so that
[57:45] when christ
[57:46] looks at the bride he sees himself
[57:50] amen that's why it's gold tried by fire
[57:52] we're not trying to
[57:55] look like a beautiful some beautiful
[57:57] women just
[57:58] some somewhere we're trying to look
[58:01] like christ we want to be a reflection
[58:04] of the king you are reflections
[58:08] of the king
[58:12] so now it's christ is the same yesterday
[58:15] today and forever
[58:18] so he we see he was in the tabernacle in
[58:22] the wilderness and then the jews said
[58:24] now
[58:25] where is he and the gentiles and peter
[58:28] and
[58:29] james and all them guys are walking
[58:30] around christ
[58:33] veiled and they're asking where's god
[58:35] they've been asking where's god i want
[58:37] to see god
[58:38] down through the ages so now today
[58:41] amen where is he where is god
[58:45] they look out into the outer space to
[58:48] find and back into the universe
[58:50] trying to find life but there's
[58:52] something driving them to find
[58:54] something more than their reality here
[58:58] because there's a deep in their heart
[59:01] if they're chosen of god amen there's a
[59:03] seed down in there
[59:04] but in mankind is a desire for something
[59:08] bigger than himself need a superman or a
[59:11] super strong guy or
[59:12] a beautiful woman or a handsome guy or a
[59:16] fancy car but they get that and it never
[59:18] satisfies and what is
[59:20] actually coming forth from within them
[59:22] is where
[59:24] is god amen in
[59:27] the ranks of the the message people
[59:30] are asking where is god people say well
[59:33] god is here he's
[59:34] he's over here we have to do it this way
[59:37] and and we'll
[59:38] know it's over here and he's going to
[59:39] birth adam's coming back and then you'll
[59:42] find what you're looking for
[59:45] amen but that's not where god is
[59:52] amen god is veiled in the bride
[59:56] the bride's dress is a reflection of her
[59:59] king
[1:00:00] they're looking and they're trying to
[1:00:02] find the answers and yet we're sitting
[1:00:04] here why
[1:00:04] are we expressing why are we a
[1:00:06] reflection of the king
[1:00:09] because he called out for us
[1:00:12] and we responded not of our own desire
[1:00:16] but of the desire of jesus christ to
[1:00:19] have himself
[1:00:20] a lovely little lady one that's clothed
[1:00:24] in in a fancy dress one that's
[1:00:28] clothed in tradition one that's clothed
[1:00:31] in
[1:00:31] in in in
[1:00:36] well other things
[1:00:40] i was gonna i'll just okay what some
[1:00:43] that are clothed in tape only
[1:00:45] some that are clothed in this preacher
[1:00:48] or this church no no
[1:00:49] no god is coming for the bride that's
[1:00:52] dressed in the clothes
[1:00:54] he has provided god's provided way
[1:00:57] of worship you can't worship god
[1:01:00] on the other side of the veil you want
[1:01:03] to worship god you see these people
[1:01:05] in in in you know pentecostals they sing
[1:01:08] those songs that we enjoy
[1:01:10] and you see them worshiping but they
[1:01:13] are not in connection with god right
[1:01:16] they're not in true worship true they're
[1:01:19] receiving
[1:01:20] you know effects on their flesh but
[1:01:25] true worship comes sometimes in the
[1:01:28] stillness of the morning
[1:01:31] amen in the middle of a busy day at work
[1:01:34] i remember one time when i was a
[1:01:36] carpenter in the union
[1:01:38] i was working on this job and there was
[1:01:39] a bunch of people
[1:01:41] and the iron workers i was working right
[1:01:45] next to them
[1:01:46] carpenters are really bad and then
[1:01:48] there's
[1:01:49] sailors and then there's iron workers
[1:01:52] and they had their music blasting you
[1:01:55] know heavy metal all that is a favorite
[1:01:57] of them kind of people
[1:01:59] and right there on the roof in the
[1:02:01] middle of everybody
[1:02:02] cursing their music i thought you know
[1:02:05] what it doesn't matter where i am
[1:02:08] it's inside me and right there god's
[1:02:10] presence came down
[1:02:11] it doesn't matter where you are or what
[1:02:14] you're doing
[1:02:15] if you can step behind the veil if you
[1:02:19] live your
[1:02:20] life behind the veil which incidentally
[1:02:22] is the will of god
[1:02:24] says you get out from behind the will of
[1:02:26] god you're out from behind his
[1:02:27] protection but when you're behind the
[1:02:29] will of god
[1:02:30] and then god will protect you that's the
[1:02:32] veil see how all of this just ties
[1:02:34] together like you can't make this stuff
[1:02:36] up
[1:02:37] and then it just perfectly dovetails
[1:02:38] together by the way you know a dovetail
[1:02:41] we always say dovetails
[1:02:42] it's almost impossible to break a
[1:02:44] dovetail joint
[1:02:46] the word dovetails together and where it
[1:02:49] comes together it's impossible to break
[1:02:52] amen but god's word fits so perfectly so
[1:02:55] it's the worship comes from your heart
[1:02:56] not the building
[1:02:58] we respect this building because it's
[1:03:00] what god has ordained to be that way
[1:03:02] but the worship comes from behind the
[1:03:05] veil comes from the bride
[1:03:06] because you are expressing what's inside
[1:03:09] of you
[1:03:10] and the only thing that christ accepts
[1:03:12] is the reflection of himself
[1:03:16] you can try to worship the way they the
[1:03:18] world through the world through their
[1:03:20] dancing they're worshiping they're
[1:03:21] worshiping all kinds of gods
[1:03:23] all kinds of devils it might some
[1:03:28] but when you worship from christ
[1:03:31] within you to the christ within you
[1:03:34] that's where you find god's true worship
[1:03:38] so the bride is dressed in a reflection
[1:03:41] of the king
[1:03:43] just like this this mountain lake
[1:03:46] which i did i just picked this picture
[1:03:47] but apparently that lake looks like a
[1:03:49] rainbow so
[1:03:50] there's that amen so
[1:03:53] it's not a king or some god it's
[1:03:56] the king you what i want to say tonight
[1:04:00] where
[1:04:00] god's grace is you are a reflection of
[1:04:04] the king
[1:04:05] it's time for the bride to realize who
[1:04:08] you are
[1:04:08] i don't need to stand up here and tell
[1:04:10] you who you aren't because whatever you
[1:04:12] focus on is what you become
[1:04:15] so you you know you look past your
[1:04:17] failures you you look past your
[1:04:19] weaknesses and you say i'm a reflection
[1:04:21] of the king
[1:04:22] and guess what you look behind you and
[1:04:24] you say oh i'm lining up with that now
[1:04:27] because when you look straight ahead
[1:04:32] that's where you go when you look behind
[1:04:34] you
[1:04:35] you crash try it sometime no don't
[1:04:39] i'm going down the freeway at 80.
[1:04:45] it is the king jesus christ and you are
[1:04:48] a reflection of him
[1:04:50] it's not what does the scripture say
[1:04:53] what
[1:04:53] what does paul say it's not robbery he
[1:04:55] thought it not robbery
[1:04:57] same thing for you it's not robbery for
[1:04:59] you to think of yourself as a reflection
[1:05:01] of the king
[1:05:02] because that's what you were called to
[1:05:04] be amen and as
[1:05:05] time progresses we're going to hear it
[1:05:07] more and more you're going to read the
[1:05:09] bible you're going to go wow the lord's
[1:05:10] really trying to tell me who i am
[1:05:12] yet 20 years ago you were reading about
[1:05:15] how there's a prophet
[1:05:17] now when you read all you sees how
[1:05:18] you're the bride and christ is in you
[1:05:20] and you are christ and it's all the same
[1:05:22] and he's coming back for you
[1:05:24] and you're lining up with the word
[1:05:27] you're looking like the word
[1:05:29] a little bit more every single day from
[1:05:32] glory to glory the scripture says here
[1:05:34] with open face beholding as in a glass
[1:05:36] the glory of the lord
[1:05:38] a glass a reflection amen are changed
[1:05:41] into the same image from glory
[1:05:42] to glory from eternity to eternity amen
[1:05:46] you coming you're going back to where
[1:05:48] you came from
[1:05:50] by the spirit of the lord and where the
[1:05:53] spirit of the lord is there is liberty
[1:05:56] if you're not finding liberty in
[1:05:59] your life you're doing something wrong
[1:06:02] you're not that's not christ if you're
[1:06:04] not excuse me
[1:06:05] if you're not finding liberty and what
[1:06:07] you think is christ
[1:06:09] maybe that's not christ right people are
[1:06:12] stuck
[1:06:13] in in in in bondage in in in
[1:06:18] places that are labeled
[1:06:22] message churches but
[1:06:25] and this will never denominate but god
[1:06:28] is
[1:06:28] calling you out of the message church
[1:06:33] it's about the bride of christ i i call
[1:06:37] you
[1:06:37] brothers and sisters stand up and become
[1:06:40] the bride of christ
[1:06:42] you have it it's inside of you it's
[1:06:46] ready it's waiting you're and guess what
[1:06:48] it just
[1:06:49] it does it it's
[1:06:52] amen every day you yield more to christ
[1:06:55] amen a reflection of him
[1:06:57] it's like if you had a mirror and it was
[1:07:01] it was it was it was really dirty you
[1:07:03] can't you just see this blurry
[1:07:05] outline it will just see blurry then you
[1:07:07] you wipe it down you
[1:07:09] and you there's smears and so you just
[1:07:11] see a blurry island of a person now
[1:07:13] you never maybe never seen yourself
[1:07:15] before and you're wondering what's on
[1:07:16] the other side
[1:07:17] and you and then and then god comes
[1:07:19] along and he wipes another layer off of
[1:07:21] it
[1:07:22] and then he wipes another layer off of
[1:07:24] it and next thing you know
[1:07:26] which would be in the twinkling of an
[1:07:28] eye
[1:07:29] you see christ
[1:07:34] and that's when that's when we're going
[1:07:36] to get out of here because when you see
[1:07:38] christ
[1:07:39] in the reflection of the word you're
[1:07:42] gonna
[1:07:42] you're gonna know that's who i am
[1:07:46] and nothing can hold you here because if
[1:07:49] you know where you're from
[1:07:51] you can go back there if you know who
[1:07:54] you are you can return
[1:07:56] back to that amen he's looking to see
[1:08:00] himself
[1:08:01] in you
[1:08:04] he wants you okay so he's christ
[1:08:08] is looking to see himself in you
[1:08:13] and he wants you
[1:08:16] to find yourself in him
[1:08:20] what does that mean if that if that
[1:08:22] happens what does that mean it's christ
[1:08:25] both times that was beautiful the
[1:08:28] well on sunday with the hands
[1:08:32] he wants you to find yourself in him
[1:08:36] why is it so hard for us
[1:08:40] to believe
[1:08:45] to really really really believe that
[1:08:48] this that he really wants to see himself
[1:08:51] in us
[1:08:52] we say we believe it and we believe it
[1:08:54] but when we
[1:08:55] find ourselves in a struggle or a
[1:08:58] weakness or we're down
[1:09:00] we just accept that as our identity
[1:09:04] it's the flesh right okay we understand
[1:09:06] that
[1:09:07] but i'm not talking about who you aren't
[1:09:09] so you accept that as your identity
[1:09:13] you know people have why why is it in
[1:09:16] our day
[1:09:17] there's such a big identity issue
[1:09:20] natural types of spirituals
[1:09:21] there's an identity issue in the bride
[1:09:23] of christ otherwise we wouldn't be here
[1:09:26] there is an identity issue but god is
[1:09:28] trying to tell you look you're a
[1:09:29] reflection of
[1:09:30] the king of me and he's saying don't
[1:09:34] accept the identity the devil wants to
[1:09:36] hand you
[1:09:37] wrapped up in a fancy thing or a
[1:09:40] melancholy moment
[1:09:43] but accept the identity that christ
[1:09:47] has for you in his word
[1:09:51] people are confused if they're a guy or
[1:09:53] a girl
[1:09:54] if they're a human or a dog or a lion or
[1:09:58] a tiger
[1:10:00] they're trying but when they when they
[1:10:02] think that's their identity that's who
[1:10:04] they become
[1:10:07] that's who they look like when you
[1:10:09] accept your identity
[1:10:11] i'm the bride of christ that's who
[1:10:13] you're going
[1:10:14] to become praise the lord
[1:10:17] till nobody can tell the reflection
[1:10:20] apart
[1:10:24] amen then that's the twinkling of an eye
[1:10:27] and the ride will be gone you'll be gone
[1:10:30] i'll be gone
[1:10:32] say oh how how do you know faith
[1:10:36] i'm gonna accept it look uh look they
[1:10:38] say in the world fake it till you make
[1:10:39] it
[1:10:42] and that's not we live our life by faith
[1:10:44] but you understand what i'm trying to
[1:10:45] say
[1:10:46] i hope so you ask so ask yourself when
[1:10:48] you make a choice which one would be a
[1:10:50] reflection of my king
[1:10:52] is this conversation i'm having a
[1:10:54] reflection of a king
[1:10:56] is these thoughts that i'm having a
[1:10:58] reflection of the king
[1:11:00] is me putting myself down a reflection
[1:11:03] of the king
[1:11:05] is me accepting defeat and saying well
[1:11:07] what will be will be is that a
[1:11:08] reflection of the king
[1:11:10] or does he called you to be a warrior
[1:11:13] conduct yourself
[1:11:14] as a reflection of the king receive
[1:11:17] joy and victory in your heart as a
[1:11:20] reflection of the king
[1:11:22] it is not wrong to be happy every day of
[1:11:25] your life
[1:11:27] that's a reflection of the king not just
[1:11:30] happy but joy a bubbling joy
[1:11:34] that you just can't it's contagious you
[1:11:36] can't get rid of it that's what god's
[1:11:37] called you to be
[1:11:39] it's a joyous to spread the good news
[1:11:41] you think you're gonna you think
[1:11:42] somebody wants your religion if you're
[1:11:44] got a
[1:11:45] big frown on your face all the time
[1:11:49] you know it's like it's like you know in
[1:11:50] the catholic church i don't know what
[1:11:52] are they seeing now when the guys up
[1:11:53] there all somber
[1:11:56] rattling off in latin that no one can
[1:11:57] understand yeah i want that
[1:12:00] big time no i want something with life
[1:12:03] in it
[1:12:06] yes
[1:12:08] the world is looking in all the wrong
[1:12:10] places
[1:12:12] some message people are looking for
[1:12:13] christ in all the wrong places
[1:12:16] in some man in some ministry they're
[1:12:18] moving in churches and moving churches
[1:12:20] and moving churches and
[1:12:21] oh you know you you hear them all this
[1:12:23] brother is such a good preacher and then
[1:12:25] and then and then they move on and it's
[1:12:26] this other guy over here
[1:12:28] and yet their life is still struggling
[1:12:30] and their life is still not lining up
[1:12:32] with the word
[1:12:34] because they're looking for christ in
[1:12:36] all the wrong places
[1:12:37] but christ is veiled within his bride
[1:12:42] amen you aren't just i ain't man to
[1:12:44] myself
[1:12:45] sorry brother paul you aren't just some
[1:12:48] nobody
[1:12:51] you are destined for greatness
[1:12:55] you're not just he's just somebody you
[1:12:57] know
[1:13:03] you're a reflection of the king
[1:13:10] you're you are not destined for failure
[1:13:15] um you are destined for greatness you
[1:13:18] are
[1:13:19] greatness because you are a reflection
[1:13:22] of the king
[1:13:23] now start acting like it
[1:13:28] start acting like it man it's funny how
[1:13:31] much
[1:13:32] i i i think i say it a lot and
[1:13:36] my the work i do just it's crazy how
[1:13:39] much it lines up with
[1:13:40] the word i know that sounds funny and i
[1:13:42] couldn't explain myself because you'd
[1:13:44] have to
[1:13:44] do it to understand but um
[1:13:48] one of the big things is is people that
[1:13:50] that do what i do have
[1:13:52] have there's a name for it it's
[1:13:54] basically a complex
[1:13:56] thinking they're not smart enough to do
[1:13:58] it
[1:13:59] yet they do it every single day
[1:14:04] so you have to act like it and until you
[1:14:06] convince yourself you've convinced
[1:14:08] everyone else around you but you have to
[1:14:09] convince yourself
[1:14:10] i don't know that one was free so don't
[1:14:12] carry around
[1:14:13] that worry anymore it's not yours that
[1:14:16] worry is not your identity
[1:14:19] don't carry around those chains anymore
[1:14:22] amen those chains are not your identity
[1:14:25] amen
[1:14:26] christ musicians want to come tonight
[1:14:28] christ has
[1:14:29] called out to you
[1:14:32] go out to meet him
[1:14:37] you want to become like christ you have
[1:14:39] to know about christ
[1:14:42] how are you going to know about christ
[1:14:44] only if you spend time
[1:14:46] with him in secret
[1:14:50] we're not trying to make a show we're
[1:14:52] not trying to
[1:14:54] to to just
[1:14:58] well make a show but we have a desire in
[1:15:02] our heart i was thinking that tonight
[1:15:04] i i in the back
[1:15:08] just sometimes it's hard to separate
[1:15:10] from the day
[1:15:12] especially if if you're going to preach
[1:15:14] and stepping and
[1:15:15] you're thinking about working and
[1:15:17] stressing about stuff and and you want
[1:15:19] to push that aside and i
[1:15:21] sometimes we feel like we have to
[1:15:26] we feel like we have to put on an act
[1:15:29] of what a christian supposed to be or
[1:15:31] what a preacher is supposed to be or
[1:15:33] what a song leader is supposed to be
[1:15:35] but i find that you connect with god
[1:15:39] when you're real about who you are
[1:15:42] and where you are because
[1:15:45] god's not in um
[1:15:50] god's not gonna god's not gonna accept
[1:15:53] an act
[1:15:56] and when you come to church and you come
[1:15:59] and you got two different shoes because
[1:16:02] that's just how it went
[1:16:04] um and you just six and that's a poor
[1:16:07] example
[1:16:08] i'm sorry it's all i can i i'm pulling
[1:16:11] on right now
[1:16:12] but you just say god i came to hear from
[1:16:14] you
[1:16:15] you don't you don't come you know you
[1:16:17] some some and i keep using preachers as
[1:16:19] an example
[1:16:20] that's a good thing since i'm up here
[1:16:22] but they're the one that you see is
[1:16:24] sometimes they come out and they just
[1:16:26] they they're they're talking loudly
[1:16:28] because they're trying to get themselves
[1:16:30] to to push themselves into an anointing
[1:16:33] or into an atmosphere that they think it
[1:16:35] it should be and say we just come out or
[1:16:37] you just come to church and you just say
[1:16:39] god
[1:16:39] what is it you want to say
[1:16:43] what is it you want me to hear what is
[1:16:45] it you want me to accept where do you
[1:16:46] want me to change
[1:16:48] amen that's where you connect with god
[1:16:51] i don't know i hope i hope you're it's
[1:16:54] it's coming out
[1:16:55] uh it's it's all up to god anyways it's
[1:16:58] not a
[1:16:58] it's uh not up to me just
[1:17:02] well to come to come as a real
[1:17:06] to be real is to come with an open heart
[1:17:09] to be honest
[1:17:10] that's what it is come with an open come
[1:17:12] with a
[1:17:13] a spirit and and you don't have to have
[1:17:15] had a bad day to come to church like
[1:17:17] that but sometimes those bad days beat
[1:17:19] us down until we're
[1:17:21] just what's next and we're kind of in
[1:17:23] this
[1:17:24] right but and then you can still
[1:17:28] be excited when you come to church and
[1:17:30] be open don't try to assume what god's
[1:17:33] going to do what god's going to speak
[1:17:35] just have faith that he's going to speak
[1:17:36] just that faith that he's going to talk
[1:17:38] to you that he's going to speak to you
[1:17:39] when you do your devotions i don't know
[1:17:42] last night i was praying and i and i
[1:17:45] just
[1:17:46] i was thinking about it and
[1:17:50] even even even sometimes
[1:17:53] we have a desire we're serving god we
[1:17:56] get stuck in in
[1:17:57] repetition prayers and i was praying and
[1:18:00] i was just thinking about i was like
[1:18:02] lord you
[1:18:03] now understand i know this i serve lord
[1:18:06] with all my heart
[1:18:07] but so it just hits you you're real
[1:18:11] i'm not just talking to the air you're
[1:18:14] actually
[1:18:15] listening
[1:18:18] and as as time goes on we're gonna we're
[1:18:21] gonna get
[1:18:22] closer and closer to that connection
[1:18:26] as you grow in christ as well you get
[1:18:28] closer to that connection
[1:18:30] saints when you pray you're not just
[1:18:31] praying to the air
[1:18:34] christ is actually listening to you
[1:18:39] he's there he's not far away on some you
[1:18:42] know
[1:18:43] uh unnamed planet in the universe he's
[1:18:46] he's right here he's right inside he's
[1:18:49] right next to you
[1:18:51] and when you he
[1:18:54] hears everything you're saying like i'm
[1:18:57] having like i'm right now i'm talking to
[1:18:59] you you're hearing me
[1:19:00] as christ is hearing you
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:04] i don't know amen that that's
[1:19:07] the reality that we live in the world
[1:19:11] a world around us is pretty crazy
[1:19:15] and there's a lot of noise there's a lot
[1:19:18] of noise
[1:19:20] [Music]
[1:19:21] but if we can push that aside
[1:19:25] and just realize that the lord
[1:19:28] is is right there and he's listening and
[1:19:31] help
[1:19:31] us to listen back
[1:19:33] [Music]
[1:19:34] help us to open our ears and on our
[1:19:37] hearts

[1:19:46] lord we just so thankful father
[1:19:50] to be called your bride lord to be a
[1:19:52] reflection of you
[1:19:55] that's not a a bold or a
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:59] wrong statement to make it's what you're
[1:20:02] trying to tell us
[1:20:04] because you know if we can accept that
[1:20:07] in
[1:20:07] faith that's who we'll become abraham
[1:20:11] accepted it in faith
[1:20:12] and he was given a body change and
[1:20:14] received the promised son
[1:20:16] father now we accept that in faith we
[1:20:18] look past our shortcomings we look past
[1:20:21] what we do when we when we yell at our
[1:20:24] of the kids or the wife or we speak
[1:20:26] rough or we or we don't do our business
[1:20:28] correctly and we
[1:20:30] and then we're rude with our client lord
[1:20:32] father
[1:20:33] we look past all of that and we say lord
[1:20:37] help us to keep our eyes on the fact
[1:20:39] that we are a reflection of you lord

[1:20:45] come here lord to hear from you
[1:20:47] we're christians and father we're sons
[1:20:50] and daughters of the king and we love
[1:20:52] you lord
[1:20:54] we love you so much father we don't pray
[1:20:57] this
[1:20:57] to the air we don't pray to the walls we
[1:20:59] don't pray to
[1:21:01] we don't pray to a preconceived notion
[1:21:05] of who you are we pray to the revelation
[1:21:07] of you within us lord jesus father help
[1:21:10] us lord open our eyes lord jesus to see
[1:21:12] more of you help us to find
[1:21:15] time to to to make time to spend with
