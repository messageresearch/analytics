[35:44] we're happy that you're here with us uh
[35:47] once again amen I want to speak to you
[35:50] on the title or thought thank you so
[35:52] much
[35:53] musicians um Faith proving the word in
[35:58] you and um it's interesting my brother
[36:02] and sister how that we look at things
[36:04] and and uh this will not be nothing new
[36:07] to you we're not trying to preach some
[36:09] new thought like it was a mystery but
[36:11] just reminders right to stir up our Pure
[36:14] Minds in remembrance how important it is
[36:17] because it was important enough for it
[36:19] to be placed in scripture and and uh you
[36:23] know I say if God wanted it recorded in
[36:25] the word he wanted us to read it
[36:27] remember it and have it alive and active
[36:30] through the ministry in in the body of
[36:33] Christ that Ministry isn't always the
[36:35] preacher behind a Pulpit right often
[36:38] times it is there that we are speaking
[36:40] one to another words of
[36:42] encouragement sometimes I can even
[36:44] relate to a recent conversation where
[36:47] the individual I was talking to had no
[36:50] idea how much they were encouraging me
[36:53] by the words that they were sharing and
[36:56] and that's what God wants us to do he
[36:58] wants us to find Faith through the
[37:00] sharing of the word through the ministry
[37:03] and so uh we just want to turn in uh 1
[37:07] Corinthians um the first chapter verses
[37:10] 1-8 this evening amen it's good we had a
[37:14] lovely time I bring greetings to you
[37:17] from brother Ron Peterson and and many
[37:20] Believers there that uh you would know
[37:22] in various ways at various times uh
[37:26] there and it was was kind of interesting
[37:28] I uh we we got there went to church on
[37:32] Sunday and um and it seemed like half of
[37:36] Canada had come to Arizona and so all
[37:39] these people were like oh God bless you
[37:41] brother Paul so good to see you again so
[37:43] soon and uh you know it's funny because
[37:47] it's sometimes about environment and uh
[37:50] so I'm kind of looking at this some of
[37:53] these brothers and sisters and I'm like
[37:55] who are they
[37:57] but then the minute your memory is
[37:59] stirred you're like oh yes and uh so it
[38:03] was just lovely a a lovely time amen 1
[38:06] Corinthians 1 chapter verse
[38:08] 1-8 Paul called to be an apostle of
[38:12] Jesus Christ through the will of God and
[38:15] sasines our brother unto the Church of
[38:18] God which is at Corinth to them that are
[38:21] Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be
[38:25] Saints with all that in every place call
[38:28] upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord
[38:31] both theirs and ours Grace be unto you
[38:34] and peace from God our Father and from
[38:37] the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God
[38:40] always in your behalf for the grace of
[38:43] God which is given you by Jesus Christ
[38:46] that in everything ye that ye are
[38:49] everything ye are enriched by Him in all
[38:52] utterance and in all knowledge even as
[38:55] the testimony of Christ was confirmed
[38:57] confirmed in you and I really want to
[38:59] emphasize that that the testimony of
[39:02] Christ was confirmed in you so that ye
[39:06] come behind in no gift waiting for the
[39:09] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[39:11] shall also confirm you and the end that
[39:15] you may be blameless in the day of our
[39:17] Lord Jesus Christ amen heavenly father
[39:21] bless the word I pray this evening Lord
[39:24] we thank you for the opportunity amen
[39:27] you may be seated
[39:29] Saints I look at this and I to me it is
[39:32] such a positive reinforcement of who we
[39:34] are and and you know this is not
[39:36] historical word speaking to us but it's
[39:39] a living word and I want to just bounce
[39:41] back through these scriptures here for a
[39:43] minute and uh you know he's declaring
[39:46] that he thanks God on your behalf for
[39:48] the grace of God which is given you by
[39:51] Jesus Christ and truly I am thankful
[39:54] today for the grace of God it is not as
[39:57] though that we ever intentionally go out
[40:00] and and come short of of the glory of
[40:03] God ever ever you know might say
[40:05] backslide as the prophet put it he said
[40:08] we backslide every day uh and that
[40:10] doesn't mean that we go and fall in the
[40:12] gutter of sin but sometimes little
[40:15] things happen and that keeps us and and
[40:18] certainly tonight we would say thank you
[40:20] Lord for your grace it is it is
[40:22] sustaining power to you and I and verse
[40:26] 5 says that in every everything ye are
[40:28] enriched by him and you know when you
[40:30] think about that enriched it is added to
[40:33] or supplemented or given greater power
[40:36] and so we are truly today been given
[40:39] greater power uh by our relationship
[40:43] with the Lord amen who we might be
[40:46] successful as business or successful in
[40:49] in friendships and all of these things
[40:51] but truly what it is we're looking for
[40:54] the day of our Lord Jesus Christ that is
[40:56] what we're looking to it's not about
[40:59] what we actually have in this life right
[41:01] now there are many a men many a man
[41:05] passed away today that would be
[41:06] considered wealthy but it won't change
[41:09] one thing for them to be enriched by the
[41:13] presence or the spirit of our Lord Jesus
[41:15] Christ is making you and I the most
[41:19] powerful individuals on the face of the
[41:22] Earth today amen and that power will not
[41:25] be the kind to rule governments or or to
[41:27] rule uh industry or whatever it might be
[41:30] but that is a power that God has given
[41:33] and Unleashed my brother and sister in
[41:36] the bride of Christ now the prophet of
[41:37] God says we don't have power we have
[41:40] authority but you understand what the
[41:42] word is saying here when you have
[41:44] authority if you speak words and nothing
[41:48] happens you'll realize there's not much
[41:50] power behind the words that were spoken
[41:53] so God's wanting you and I to come to a
[41:55] place that that we rise up in faith that
[41:58] when we would speak and not a Miss but
[42:00] we would speak that we would see God
[42:03] come on the scene and you know it's
[42:05] interesting just uh interacting with
[42:08] different individuals in the last little
[42:10] bit and you know to have someone come
[42:12] back and tell you hey brother Paul I I
[42:15] just have a text on my phone right now a
[42:17] brother in Arizona said brother Paul a
[42:20] friend go we go way back and and he said
[42:22] brother Paul I I have this need and and
[42:25] he he's sharing with me and he says
[42:27] would you pray with me I need God to
[42:30] come on this scene in this situation and
[42:33] you know I just got a text tonight and
[42:35] he said God answers amen so you look at
[42:38] that my brother and sister it might not
[42:40] be one individual's prayer that does it
[42:42] but God looks down and says you know
[42:44] what I'm going to answer this and
[42:47] however God chooses to do that we can't
[42:49] judge and say it was my prayer their
[42:51] prayer that prayer whatever some state
[42:53] of desperation brought it on but however
[42:56] it is but we serve a prayer answering
[42:59] God Amen I say thank you Lord and so you
[43:04] look at this uh as a testimony of Christ
[43:07] was confirmed in you now this word
[43:10] confirm when you go into the older
[43:12] English dictionary some of the newer
[43:14] ones have have kind of different deals
[43:17] but this word confirm means to establish
[43:20] and so as you were there even as a
[43:23] testimony of Christ was verse 6 even as
[43:27] a testimony of Christ was
[43:30] established in you you see my brother
[43:34] and sister it's not like we need some
[43:36] great amount of evidence that's one of
[43:38] the spirits of the age we we need some
[43:40] evidence that God answers prayer we need
[43:42] some evidence that God cares we need
[43:45] evidence that God hears us but what
[43:47] about the evidence that comes down when
[43:50] God established himself in our life
[43:54] lifechanging experience where where we
[43:56] can sit back and I believe every one of
[43:58] us tonight would have a testimony to say
[44:01] I was there at this time and place and
[44:04] God come and made the difference amen CU
[44:07] he's established himself and so it's
[44:10] there that this uh testimony of Christ
[44:13] is confirmed in US established in US and
[44:17] I like this verse 7 because in this my
[44:20] brother and sister this is something
[44:22] this Satan is trying to do in in this
[44:25] day right now uh around the bride he's
[44:28] trying to do that and sometimes it's
[44:30] well-intentioned people that are
[44:33] promoting Satan's agenda and that is if
[44:36] you're not here you're falling behind
[44:38] the bride you're falling behind the word
[44:41] if you don't attend a certain Church
[44:42] you're not under certain Ministry and
[44:44] the devil will come and when people get
[44:46] in a battle one of the first things we
[44:49] do uh is we start to doubt
[44:53] ourself now we've preached this over
[44:56] this pulpit many many times been
[44:58] preached by many
[45:00] ministers that we are the word so see
[45:04] how subtle Satan is that when we start
[45:06] to doubt ourself Satan is working at
[45:10] undermining the word and he tries really
[45:13] hard to undermine the word he can't
[45:15] defeat the word he can't overcome it uh
[45:18] he he can use subterfuge he can kind of
[45:21] twist the words but he cannot overcome
[45:23] it so the next best thing is to get you
[45:26] to doubt self which we have confessed
[45:28] for years that we are the word we are
[45:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ and when you
[45:34] start to doubt that Satan has an inroad
[45:37] amen as they say my brother and sister
[45:39] if you truly want to keep uh the cat out
[45:43] of the chicken Coupe you just put a roof
[45:45] on it but if you want to keep the badger
[45:47] or the raccoon out you got to bury
[45:50] concrete down in the ground because
[45:51] they'll dig a hole 4 feet deep cuz they
[45:54] want to kill the chicken not necessarily
[45:57] even eat the chicken they just want to
[45:58] kill the chicken so Satan will do
[46:01] everything he can do to get into our
[46:03] lives to interfere with our lives over
[46:06] the top underneath through the gate if
[46:09] it's left unlocked amen so it's there we
[46:12] see that God's coming and we are not
[46:15] behind in any single gift we could
[46:18] preach my brother and sister and
[46:20] sometimes it's a verbiage so don't
[46:21] misunderstand but we can preach that the
[46:24] Rapture should have already taken place
[46:26] if God had time the Rapture to have
[46:28] already taken place it would have
[46:30] already taken place so this bride has
[46:34] not fallen out of Step Right In The
[46:36] Vision the prophet of God telling us get
[46:39] back in Step get back in line my brother
[46:42] and sister but he didn't say get back in
[46:43] line or I'm going to leave you amen he
[46:46] was there by the word to correct them
[46:49] and get them back into their proper
[46:51] position aren't you thankful for the
[46:53] Lord amen so he comes we're not going to
[46:56] be behind in no gift we hear uh I'm
[46:59] going to speak just straightforward
[47:01] tonight I hope you don't mind we hear
[47:03] people preaching if you're not speaking
[47:05] in tongues you've missed it if you're
[47:06] not dancing in the spirit you've missed
[47:08] it and then we got the other side where
[47:11] it's like well they're just behaving in
[47:13] the flesh and and it turns that whole
[47:15] battle well my brother and sister even
[47:17] the prophet of God I I kind of like this
[47:20] is a a little bit of an affirmation the
[47:22] prophet of God said now you go down in
[47:24] the South and those people I'm
[47:26] paraphrasing it they're real Lively and
[47:28] they get up and jump and shout and clap
[47:30] and holler and then you go
[47:33] north now this no justification because
[47:36] we're North that we
[47:38] just but my brother and sister see you
[47:40] can't take one blanket and throw it over
[47:43] the whole
[47:45] bride and say everybody ought to worship
[47:48] like this here's the church that is our
[47:51] template well I can assure you my
[47:53] brother and sister uh just I have no
[47:56] evidence but I I can assure you that in
[47:58] the upper room there were some that were
[48:00] just a little bit calmer than the others
[48:04] and some no doubt were maybe even
[48:07] walking on the walls who know but you
[48:09] see we don't want to try to conform
[48:12] ourself to someone else we're supposed
[48:15] to be conformed to Christ and so as we
[48:18] conform oursel to Christ we have right
[48:20] here by scripture amen that this
[48:23] testimony of Christ is confirmed or
[48:25] established in you can someone say say
[48:27] amen and so we're not going to fall
[48:29] behind in the gift as we wait for the
[48:31] coming of the Lord see that's one thing
[48:33] that's killing people is they thought
[48:36] the Rapture was going to take place
[48:38] already so they thought it was actually
[48:40] a
[48:41] Sprint and so we're going to hold it all
[48:44] together and we're going to rush to the
[48:45] Rapture and it's going to be over but
[48:48] God turned it into an endurance race and
[48:51] as an endurance race you have to pace
[48:54] yourself you run faster some sometimes
[48:56] sometimes you run a little slower
[48:58] sometimes you have to stop and take a
[49:01] drink amen sometimes you need to just
[49:03] stop and rest for a moment but you see
[49:07] as time goes on we we are seeing that
[49:10] God is is also in verse eight confirming
[49:14] or establishing you until the
[49:17] end that should give us great joy my
[49:20] brother and sister to know that God's
[49:22] got it in control all the way to the end
[49:26] amen amen and you know I don't know it's
[49:30] kind of a verbiage thing forgive me but
[49:32] the end is not even the Rapture that's
[49:35] right that's
[49:36] right some people are like I just got to
[49:39] make it to the Rapture no my Bible tells
[49:42] me that I'm going to be in the throne
[49:45] with him there's the position we're
[49:47] shooting for that's what we're longing
[49:49] for is to be in the throne with him and
[49:53] so it's there that I better move on we
[49:56] be here a long time so I say as I read
[50:00] this scripture it's such a positive uh
[50:03] reinforcement or influence I look at
[50:05] this and realize you know what I might
[50:08] not be on Pace with with Excuse me to
[50:10] use you for an example Brother David I
[50:12] might not be on Pace with Brother David
[50:15] but I won't be left behind that's right
[50:17] amen that's right or to make myself feel
[50:21] better is it okay if I make myself feel
[50:23] better brother David might not be on
[50:24] Pace with me
[50:26] does it really matter we're not racing
[50:29] each
[50:29] other right and so so that idea should
[50:34] just be pushed away right but we're not
[50:37] going to fall behind if we are the bride
[50:39] of Christ predestinated with that seed
[50:42] in us we're not going to show up a day
[50:45] late for the Rapture we're not going to
[50:47] show up a day late for our healing we're
[50:50] not going to show up a day late for our
[50:53] deliverance now don't take that as an
[50:55] excuse that we can l gag along this
[50:58] bride ought to be on fire she ought to
[51:00] be just ready to please her husband she
[51:02] ought to be just looking to that and
[51:04] Revelations 19 she's making herself
[51:07] ready she's not sitting back Waiting for
[51:10] God to do it she's already got the word
[51:13] now my brother and sister if our Lord
[51:15] Jesus Christ came tonight in our
[51:18] presence would there be anything more he
[51:20] could do for
[51:23] us we have it he's gave it to us the
[51:27] bride is hearing it the bride is
[51:29] believing it and the bride is applying
[51:32] that what was brother brother how did he
[51:35] put that Jerry um oh
[51:40] my I'm going to stumble all over that I
[51:43] shouldn't even have let it entered my
[51:45] mind oh those steps of grabbing it
[51:48] making it your ears
[51:52] oh forgive
[51:54] me uh we'll remember it was and we'll
[51:57] we'll bring that I thought it was very
[51:59] very good
[52:01] amen so when the testimony of Christ is
[52:04] established in you is that
[52:09] temporary the word is eternal the word
[52:12] is in you that means you are Eternal and
[52:16] the results of that word is also Eternal
[52:20] amen sometimes we don't like how the
[52:22] word comes Jesus was pretty blunt
[52:26] imagine they deserve the words he
[52:28] wouldn't have done it otherwise but
[52:30] imagine how they felt to be of you of
[52:32] your father the devil that had to have a
[52:35] sting in it yeah but it was
[52:40] true and just because it stings when you
[52:42] hear it doesn't take away truth that's
[52:46] right and so we have to be careful how
[52:49] we
[52:50] respond whether it's all
[52:54] mushy you know oh makes me just feel so
[52:57] warm and
[52:59] fuzzy if it's not
[53:01] truth it won't get you in a
[53:04] Rapture sometimes the word is warm and
[53:07] fuzzy amen sometimes it's just like
[53:10] pulling a nice blanket around you and
[53:13] just basing in the warmth of it when you
[53:15] realize what Jesus Christ has done for
[53:18] you and I now look at this in Galatians
[53:21] 2:20 and so as we'll see this now these
[53:25] are strong words that is being spoken
[53:27] here to the Galatians but it is so
[53:29] beautiful to me I am crucified with
[53:33] Christ
[53:35] nevertheless I
[53:37] live what do you know what I I I think
[53:40] that's very powerful to be able to stand
[53:42] with confidence and say you know what
[53:44] I'm crucified with Christ could we lift
[53:46] a hand with that and say I am crucified
[53:49] with Christ but to turn around and give
[53:53] the proper this is where the
[53:55] establishing of the the word comes the
[53:58] proper deal yet not I but Christ in me
[54:03] in other words the only way that I can
[54:07] live is the fact that Christ is in me
[54:11] amen we can talk about faith we can talk
[54:14] about all kinds of things and apply it
[54:16] from many different ways but my brother
[54:18] and sister sometimes faith is just
[54:21] merely the expression of the word of God
[54:24] the Life of Christ in you and I and he
[54:27] put it there and it is I'm ahead of
[54:30] myself but it is a gift amen it's not
[54:33] something we could do of ourself he did
[54:36] it for us and he's producing the very
[54:39] life that we get to rejoice in he's
[54:43] producing it amen nevertheless so one
[54:48] that's crucified says nevertheless I
[54:50] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[54:53] and the life which I now live in the
[54:55] flesh
[54:57] y you see sometimes we got to stop and
[55:00] realize that he never did away with our
[55:03] flesh our flesh is still here and if
[55:06] we're not careful we always talk about
[55:08] the flesh is negative and we got to kill
[55:10] it but what about this scripture right
[55:12] here that we get to live with Christ in
[55:15] us we get to live in this flesh what a
[55:19] glorious gift God has given you and I to
[55:22] be able to live a Godly life with a very
[55:26] word of God illuminated out of Us coming
[55:30] out of us it's visible to the world
[55:32] around us and we get to live this out in
[55:36] the flesh now how could we live as
[55:38] example to somebody if we were some kind
[55:40] of perfect statue of
[55:45] something you see sometimes it's a
[55:49] Humanity
[55:52] yeah it's just the humanity that
[55:54] testifies
[55:56] that you're different
[55:58] yeah you know not moving into the
[56:01] neighborhood and running around to every
[56:02] house in the neighborhood and telling
[56:04] them praise God I got the truth and
[56:05] you're going to hell now that's not
[56:08] going to do it but I'll tell you what
[56:10] you do when you send your 12-year-old
[56:11] boy over and he mows the elderly lady's
[56:15] lawn and she wants to pay him and he
[56:19] just tells her uh no thank you I just
[56:21] wanted to do this for you and God bless
[56:23] you pretty soon the little old lady said
[56:26] says those people are different pretty
[56:29] soon she's defending that family to the
[56:33] neighborhood pretty soon she wants to
[56:35] know why they're
[56:38] different and no one had to force the
[56:41] issue see sometimes God just wants it to
[56:44] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[56:47] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[56:50] himself for me see Faith just slips in
[56:53] and becomes an integral part of Who We
[56:55] Are
[56:56] I would ask you today to just describe
[56:59] me this evening just describe to me what
[57:02] faith was to you
[57:05] today did we raise anybody from the
[57:09] dead did we do the whole list I don't
[57:11] want to go through all of it did that
[57:14] happen no but you lived in this flesh
[57:18] and lived testimony of Jesus
[57:21] Christ what a beautiful thing that God
[57:23] has given us it doesn't seem super
[57:26] natural but you just remove that gift of
[57:28] faith from us and we'll see just how
[57:30] Supernatural that is because it is truly
[57:34] Supernatural amen now my brother and
[57:38] sister this integral part of who we are
[57:41] we know we're Sons and Daughters of God
[57:43] there's no need to be boastful about it
[57:45] but there's no need to be uh you might
[57:47] say cowardly about it uh taken back of
[57:50] the fact of who we are that God called
[57:52] us to be that doesn't mean we're perfect
[57:55] but it means we have
[57:57] identification you know I was thinking
[57:59] about it as we were getting on an
[58:01] airplane and um uh on the way home a
[58:05] really nice lady there at the at the
[58:07] security and I was fumbling around with
[58:10] a backpack and my wallet in my hand and
[58:12] my driver's license and all this stuff
[58:15] and I finally kind of got it out and
[58:16] handed it to her and she said you know
[58:19] even upside down I could see it was
[58:24] you well of course there's a picture
[58:27] there's only so many ways you can dress
[58:30] up a
[58:31] mug but my brother and sister that's
[58:34] really how we are in this
[58:38] world upside down backwards things not
[58:41] necessarily perfectly in order and they
[58:45] still see it's
[58:47] you isn't this to me it's just wondrous
[58:51] I I I just how glorious it is cu I'm not
[58:54] I'm not promoting that we don't but my
[58:56] brother and sister we spend our whole
[58:57] life trying to work on presenting a
[59:00] certain kind of image to the world and
[59:02] God says I want you to live with me in
[59:06] you in the flesh in this world I'll do
[59:09] the
[59:10] rest we have to be willing we have to be
[59:13] ready just to live in the flesh and let
[59:17] Christ live in
[59:19] us and as he lives in us he uses example
[59:22] after
[59:23] example how that God would work and do
[59:26] the work and show his work and let his
[59:30] work be lived
[59:34] out now we've heard the quote and I
[59:37] almost included the whole quote here
[59:38] tonight but I I just chose to paraphrase
[59:41] it when the bride recognizes who she is
[59:45] brother Brown goes on to say she becomes
[59:47] an invincible Army so we're holding on
[59:50] to this time that we recognize who we
[59:54] are that we'll become this invincible
[59:55] Army me and I'm here to tell you you've
[59:58] already arrived amen I'm here to tell
[1:00:00] you that God's already doing that work
[1:00:03] because you'd say how how would you say
[1:00:06] that brother Paul we're still making
[1:00:07] mistakes he didn't say when you never
[1:00:10] make another mistake you become an
[1:00:12] invincible Army but what he's telling us
[1:00:14] is the moment that we not verbally not
[1:00:17] just with words saying I am the bride of
[1:00:19] Christ anyone can say I am the bride of
[1:00:22] Christ but it's when that life is
[1:00:26] established and when that life being
[1:00:29] established comes and we start to
[1:00:31] recognize this is something more than me
[1:00:34] just saying I'm the bride of Christ this
[1:00:37] is something that's living that is
[1:00:39] taking me through the really good times
[1:00:41] you might say in the natural and through
[1:00:43] the really hard times from The Valleys
[1:00:45] to the Mountaintop God's there with us
[1:00:49] and we might feel like quitting you know
[1:00:51] I I sometimes joke with Jerry it's it's
[1:00:53] more just humor but you know I teller I
[1:00:56] I think I'm done I think I'm going to
[1:00:57] quit I think I'm going to quit and then
[1:01:00] you know 30 minutes later I need to do
[1:01:02] this this this and I want to do this and
[1:01:04] I'm praying about this you see it's not
[1:01:07] in us it's not in us this is part of the
[1:01:11] establishment of the word in US is to
[1:01:14] face a reality this invincible Army just
[1:01:18] simply can't quit and that in itself is
[1:01:21] an incredible Revelation my brother and
[1:01:23] sister in a day that all these demons
[1:01:26] are trying to crush you and I there is
[1:01:29] this point that we come and think I
[1:01:31] can't go any further and God says you've
[1:01:33] just started get back in line get back
[1:01:36] in
[1:01:37] step and we start to realize yes I can
[1:01:40] do it I can do it because Christ is in
[1:01:43] me amen
[1:01:45] amen now as we look at that see this is
[1:01:49] not intellectual recognition no it is
[1:01:51] not we can look at the deal and say I
[1:01:54] see in the scripture
[1:01:57] Malachi 4 I I can see that I I can see
[1:02:01] that that God sent a prophet and the
[1:02:04] things that were prophesied now my
[1:02:06] brother and sister we're students of the
[1:02:08] message as you look in the message and
[1:02:11] you look carefully there is just one
[1:02:14] little I'm going to use the word tidbit
[1:02:16] and I don't say that to to take any
[1:02:19] value away from it but things the
[1:02:23] prophet said all these little tidbits
[1:02:26] they're falling in
[1:02:27] place absolutely they're coming together
[1:02:31] now remember the prophet talking about
[1:02:33] that man that you know had an accent and
[1:02:36] and is talking about nuts and bolts and
[1:02:39] whatever my brother and sister you know
[1:02:41] what all the tidbits are coming together
[1:02:43] for the word to be fulfilled amen and
[1:02:47] you and I are included in those tidbits
[1:02:49] that God is placing and we'll look at
[1:02:51] this that's happening do you understand
[1:02:54] things you know like like they just cut
[1:02:56] off the gas passing through Ukraine uh
[1:02:59] to the EU and and uh upset Russia very
[1:03:03] much so because it adds up to billions
[1:03:05] of dollars and so my brother and sister
[1:03:08] you'll say oh that was just politics but
[1:03:11] what we're seeing is every little
[1:03:14] tidbit put in its press right correct
[1:03:18] place and as these things are coming you
[1:03:21] say well okay that's just World politics
[1:03:23] no my brother and sister you know they
[1:03:24] actually tied directly to you yeah
[1:03:28] that's right because as that's being
[1:03:30] fulfilled that actually operates on the
[1:03:33] time piece of the
[1:03:36] Bride the bride's not operating on its
[1:03:39] time piece it's operating on our time
[1:03:42] piece and as the bride's coming ready
[1:03:45] Amen to going
[1:03:47] home I think sometimes I might just
[1:03:50] replace Rapture with going home home
[1:03:53] means it's someplace you've been before
[1:03:56] amen not just a change and we're going
[1:03:58] to have a change in fact tonight we're
[1:04:01] changing amen but we're going home we're
[1:04:04] going back where we belong it's a place
[1:04:07] that we have a right you might say we
[1:04:10] have ownership we have
[1:04:13] establishment and God's taking us there
[1:04:15] see so it it's not just the fact that we
[1:04:18] recognize who we are my brother and
[1:04:21] sister the recognition of who we are is
[1:04:25] the word manifesting in us that's right
[1:04:28] we can say I believe the message I
[1:04:30] believe the message but if the message
[1:04:32] is not in us and not evident then we
[1:04:35] have to wonder do they believe and yet
[1:04:38] I'm not going to say they don't believe
[1:04:40] but my brother and sister they are
[1:04:43] progressing and we need to pray for
[1:04:48] them that might include all of us we
[1:04:51] could look right and left and look
[1:04:52] behind us or we could just be bold and
[1:04:55] say pray for me pray for me there's
[1:04:59] still things in my life I don't like
[1:05:01] amen things that have been there from
[1:05:03] years ago and years ago didn't bother me
[1:05:05] at all but right now I start to be
[1:05:08] bothered by these things what is that
[1:05:11] God bringing you into the fullness
[1:05:14] establishing you
[1:05:17] confirming himself in us
[1:05:22] hallelujah but you know here again I
[1:05:24] want to bring this up just just have
[1:05:26] another note here amen part of this
[1:05:29] recognizing who she
[1:05:31] is and Satan not able to defeat her is
[1:05:34] because she recognizes that she can't
[1:05:37] become behind in any gift that's what
[1:05:41] the word said that's
[1:05:44] right you know there's two ways to look
[1:05:46] at
[1:05:47] that we can run with
[1:05:50] fear we can run with confidence that's
[1:05:53] right and yet the scripture tells us we
[1:05:55] should should be
[1:05:59] fearful
[1:06:00] lest we would be left
[1:06:03] behind but then the word says can't lose
[1:06:05] a
[1:06:07] one wow is this confusing no it isn't
[1:06:13] it's concrete anchored solid in the rock
[1:06:18] that God reminds you and I through the
[1:06:20] preaching of the word that there's a
[1:06:23] position God's called you to quit
[1:06:25] goofing off quit Dilly dallying get into
[1:06:28] your position and stand there with
[1:06:31] confidence of who you are in Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ and know that if you are standing
[1:06:36] in your place in the word that one you
[1:06:38] can't be left behind and two Satan
[1:06:41] cannot get you amen amen we're
[1:06:46] humans we're humans now in the quote
[1:06:50] faith is a substance and it's not there
[1:06:52] brother Alex it's actually um well in
[1:06:55] anyway it's not there I I'm I'm
[1:06:57] cherry-picking this little spot and uh
[1:07:00] faith is the substance 412 of
[1:07:03] 47 and uh I just pulled this out of the
[1:07:06] quote right there be easy to find if you
[1:07:07] need to Faith is a gift of
[1:07:11] itself you may have a portion of it but
[1:07:14] there is a gift of faith yes there is
[1:07:18] now that portion in the natural would be
[1:07:20] that we behave in such fashion that we
[1:07:23] will all tonight walk walk out take the
[1:07:27] key put it in the ignition of our car
[1:07:29] and we expect it to start when we turn
[1:07:32] the key we don't go out there well we
[1:07:35] shouldn't be driving a car that we go
[1:07:37] out there and it's
[1:07:39] like yeah I knew
[1:07:42] it no we have faith that is just in the
[1:07:46] human element that that we expect you
[1:07:49] know I always I always pray anyway trust
[1:07:52] me I always pray anyway but you know
[1:07:55] you're you have more risk of dying
[1:07:57] within 50 miles of your house in an
[1:07:59] automobile than you do flying in an
[1:08:01] airplane and when that airplane turns at
[1:08:04] the end of the runway just had this
[1:08:06] happens Monday night when the plane
[1:08:09] turns on the end of that Runway I'm like
[1:08:11] Lord please protect me and take me home
[1:08:13] safe amen it's just something about that
[1:08:16] you know you got a few hundred th000
[1:08:18] pounds with a couple basically rockets
[1:08:21] on the wings and we're rolling down the
[1:08:23] runway and you're thinking man we not
[1:08:25] going very fast and next thing you know
[1:08:27] you're
[1:08:27] flying see so there's that Faith that's
[1:08:30] there and if we could simplify our faith
[1:08:33] in God as it comes down our faith in
[1:08:36] these things in the natural I think it
[1:08:39] would actually change our lives I think
[1:08:40] most people would actually find a
[1:08:43] greater Revelation in their life if they
[1:08:45] could just take and trust God like they
[1:08:48] trust an
[1:08:52] airplane I don't know if Sister Jerry
[1:08:54] heard that but up in front of us there
[1:08:55] was somebody saying this makes me
[1:08:57] nervous and some guy quoted that to him
[1:09:00] Well ma'am you're safer in this airplane
[1:09:04] then you will be driving home from the
[1:09:06] airport in
[1:09:08] boisee that probably made her more
[1:09:11] nervous you know but the truth of it is
[1:09:14] my brother and sister we're safer in the
[1:09:17] presence of almighty God than we will be
[1:09:20] in any other place in our
[1:09:23] life amen you might might be flying you
[1:09:26] might be driving on Ice you might be
[1:09:28] doing whatever it is you are still safer
[1:09:31] in the presence of God than you are in
[1:09:34] anything this world can
[1:09:37] offer I'd like to go here there's
[1:09:39] another quote that I didn't put in there
[1:09:41] sorry about that improving his word
[1:09:44] 8664 brother brandham says here this is
[1:09:47] a little longer quote now there is also
[1:09:50] an old proverb that says prove it and
[1:09:52] I'll believe it now they got one of our
[1:09:55] one of our states in the nation they
[1:09:57] have a slogan I'm from Missouri show me
[1:10:00] see in other words prove it to me I'm
[1:10:03] from
[1:10:03] Missouri well you know that would have
[1:10:05] to apply to just about everywhere
[1:10:08] Missouri maybe got a bad slap over that
[1:10:10] one but my brother and sister it was
[1:10:12] theirs
[1:10:14] amen but this doesn't work always
[1:10:16] because God had in every age fulfilled
[1:10:19] and prove the work that he has set out
[1:10:21] for that age he spoke it in his word can
[1:10:25] we say Amen to that we're not here
[1:10:27] surmising tonight we're we're not hoping
[1:10:30] that that this is all going to work out
[1:10:32] and this is the right message sister
[1:10:34] Jerry and I was just visiting just just
[1:10:36] chatting away and and you know she she
[1:10:39] made I'm not embarrassing her I I
[1:10:41] promise you I'm not because it's
[1:10:43] something that's relevant to all of us
[1:10:45] some little thing that the devil wants
[1:10:47] to anoint to bring it down and it's like
[1:10:50] if this message is absolutely the truth
[1:10:52] why is there so much trouble around it
[1:10:57] well all you have to do is stop and
[1:11:02] study you know patents are really the
[1:11:05] devil's
[1:11:07] idea you get something and you do
[1:11:11] everything you can to protect it I want
[1:11:13] to ask you tonight do you need to
[1:11:16] protect the word of
[1:11:18] God Amen but we try we try to protect
[1:11:23] our idea well this is how I see the
[1:11:25] message this is how I see the message
[1:11:27] this is how I see being a Christian this
[1:11:30] is what I think Holiness is this is what
[1:11:32] I my brother and sister that's not what
[1:11:34] God called us to do he called us to say
[1:11:37] look I if God is a holy God and he wants
[1:11:40] Holiness in his presence then Lord
[1:11:42] reveal Holiness to me I don't need it
[1:11:45] proved I don't need some big deal God
[1:11:48] will bring it and bring it alive he'll
[1:11:51] unfold it and we'll be able to take that
[1:11:55] and it will take then a place in our
[1:11:58] life and next thing you know you will
[1:12:00] have become
[1:12:03] Holiness or we
[1:12:06] could pound on
[1:12:09] everybody got to be holy got to be
[1:12:13] holy and that would be maybe like a trip
[1:12:15] to Mishiwaka
[1:12:20] as long as I look
[1:12:22] holy everything will be fine
[1:12:25] one was trying to look it one was living
[1:12:29] it one was trying to have it confirmed
[1:12:33] in their life the other one it was
[1:12:37] confirmed God help us my brother and
[1:12:40] sister this is not for us to argue over
[1:12:42] or to press or push or do whatever amen
[1:12:46] now look at this here let me hurry on uh
[1:12:49] and every time that God's word has been
[1:12:51] proven in the age the majority has
[1:12:53] turned it down so prove it and I'll
[1:12:56] believe it is not so you can only have
[1:12:58] faith as God gives you faith faith is a
[1:13:02] gift of God ever how religious you may
[1:13:05] be yet it must take it you must have
[1:13:09] faith and your faith can only rest this
[1:13:12] is a little bit of where the my my
[1:13:14] thought or title comes from and your
[1:13:16] faith can only rest if you're a
[1:13:18] Christian upon the proven word of
[1:13:23] God so it takes Faith to bring us to a
[1:13:27] place that the word is being proven in
[1:13:30] US amen and if you got a proven word and
[1:13:33] we are in the word my brother and sister
[1:13:35] what do we have to fear what do we have
[1:13:37] to fear each day as we go out to live
[1:13:40] our life what do we have to fear the
[1:13:42] prophet of God says that God is
[1:13:44] obligated to correct you if you're wrong
[1:13:49] now here's the catch we are obligated to
[1:13:52] receive the correction when God shows it
[1:13:55] to us cuz if we refuse to receive the
[1:13:59] correction God's no longer obligated
[1:14:02] amen but God help us that we can be
[1:14:05] tender and
[1:14:07] soft you know almost like hearing
[1:14:10] someone boast you know I've been a a
[1:14:12] Christian for so long I'm just hardened
[1:14:14] to everything that's nothing to boast
[1:14:17] about should be I've been a Christian
[1:14:19] for however many years and I'm just
[1:14:21] turning into a giant puddle of of putty
[1:14:24] so to speak and when God takes a hold of
[1:14:26] me puts me on the wheel and it starts to
[1:14:29] spin I'm not there saying
[1:14:31] no I'm there saying Lord thy will be
[1:14:34] done help us
[1:14:38] Lord now I just make this as reference
[1:14:41] Hebrews
[1:14:42] 11 veres 1 through3 and now Faith is the
[1:14:45] substance of things hoped for the
[1:14:47] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[1:14:49] the elders obtained a good report and
[1:14:51] through faith we understand that the
[1:14:53] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:14:55] that things which are seen were not made
[1:14:57] of things which do appear jumping to
[1:15:00] verse 40 God having provided some better
[1:15:04] thing for us that they without us should
[1:15:06] not be made perfect now my brother and
[1:15:09] sister we could sit here and people will
[1:15:11] argue with you you're saying I was
[1:15:13] witnessing to a lady one day she got
[1:15:16] angry I mean I thought she was going to
[1:15:17] hit me because I was laying out the word
[1:15:20] and I said so we're here in this age
[1:15:23] with more Revelation more truth and
[1:15:25] everything then the previous age before
[1:15:28] us and she said you're saying that my
[1:15:31] parents didn't and boy she just went off
[1:15:33] like a Roman Candle my brother and
[1:15:35] sister I can't help what God has chose
[1:15:37] to do amen we don't want to go back you
[1:15:40] know there were saints that that that
[1:15:43] history shows us there were saints that
[1:15:45] went into the Coliseum and the Lions
[1:15:47] wouldn't eat
[1:15:48] them is that what we want to go do it's
[1:15:52] not what we were called to do we can't
[1:15:53] go back and live their day
[1:15:57] yeah so as it
[1:16:00] is God's provided something better for
[1:16:03] us that they should be made perfect now
[1:16:07] can we recognize I believe we are
[1:16:09] tonight we're we're we're well versed as
[1:16:11] message Believers recognize what the
[1:16:14] better
[1:16:16] is revelation has come down open the
[1:16:20] Mysteries yeah you see back in them days
[1:16:23] they did not
[1:16:25] understand things that we actually
[1:16:28] unfortunately take for granted yeah
[1:16:31] right isn't it terrible to take
[1:16:33] something for granted when it's truly
[1:16:35] actually a great mystery of God that's
[1:16:37] been revealed to us we should be holding
[1:16:40] on to that thank you Lord for this
[1:16:42] diamond of the word that you have given
[1:16:45] me
[1:16:48] amen we have the open word that's right
[1:16:52] I mean that that's become such a common
[1:16:54] phrase people just throw it out open
[1:16:56] word but I tell you what my brother and
[1:16:58] sister when the open word is present in
[1:17:02] the life of a Believer they recognize
[1:17:06] they've been given a great gift yes they
[1:17:10] recognize that it's not something we
[1:17:12] publish and say we've got more we've got
[1:17:14] more we've got more but I tell you what
[1:17:16] it is when it starts to live out it's
[1:17:19] the word proving itself in us right oh
[1:17:24] my right how beautiful now this will
[1:17:27] come out wrong and I'll just say it
[1:17:28] anyway but if you will do a
[1:17:30] comprehensive study of everything that's
[1:17:33] considered to be uh a a Holiness as far
[1:17:37] as religion in the world
[1:17:40] today there's a steady
[1:17:43] decline oh yeah in what is
[1:17:45] Holiness what they brand
[1:17:48] Holiness wouldn't pass the test of their
[1:17:52] forefathers yeah
[1:17:55] but as long as everybody's status
[1:17:57] quo then it doesn't have to pass the
[1:17:59] test of the
[1:18:01] forefathers but there is a test that it
[1:18:05] must
[1:18:06] pass and this is why the prophet of God
[1:18:09] puts so strongly to you and I that
[1:18:12] you've got to stay with the word because
[1:18:15] that's the only test it has to pass yeah
[1:18:21] right you talked to some Old-Timers
[1:18:25] and they'll tell you these are good Holy
[1:18:28] Ghost filled people not not not living
[1:18:30] in past
[1:18:32] age that what is represented as the
[1:18:34] bride of Christ is actually behaving
[1:18:37] acting dressing walking talking
[1:18:40] confessing more so the word right now
[1:18:44] than those that used to come to the
[1:18:49] Tabernacle some ways that sounds
[1:18:52] stunning what do you mean the prophet
[1:18:54] was there
[1:18:55] but that was a message in its infancy
[1:18:59] that's right this is a message in its
[1:19:01] maturity that's right and the word is
[1:19:04] now leading and guiding it's no longer
[1:19:07] men it's no longer a Creed or a Doctrine
[1:19:10] it is a relationship it's a life that's
[1:19:13] drawing people men and women uh young
[1:19:16] people drawing them into a closer
[1:19:18] position with the Lord amen I would say
[1:19:22] that God is proving his word today amen
[1:19:26] I believe it's alive yes yes sir
[1:19:32] amen there again it would be that we'd
[1:19:34] have to place a value on what it is to
[1:19:37] be a recipient of
[1:19:42] Revelation just because we attend a
[1:19:44] message
[1:19:46] Church gives us no guarantee of
[1:19:51] Revelation but when God is working
[1:19:54] it doesn't matter people this is also
[1:19:57] stuns me and I'll just voice it out when
[1:20:00] people are afraid for our young people
[1:20:03] that they're going to get drawn and
[1:20:05] sucked into the world and they're afraid
[1:20:08] of that my brother and sister they're
[1:20:11] expressing no confidence in the word
[1:20:13] being
[1:20:14] fulfilled God promised there would be a
[1:20:16] generation rising up in the day of the
[1:20:20] coming of the Lord amen does that mean
[1:20:22] we just quit and sit back no we do
[1:20:24] homework we do what God called us to do
[1:20:27] but my brother and sister fear of that
[1:20:29] is something that should not be in our
[1:20:31] hearts we should actually have
[1:20:33] confidence and back our confidence up
[1:20:35] with prayer amen and sharing of the word
[1:20:38] and testimony because this bride has the
[1:20:42] same seed whether they're six I'm just

[1:20:49] seed it's not a it's not a New
[1:20:52] Generation seed amen and you might say

[1:21:42] spiritual however you want to put it

[1:21:47] and sputter the whole
[1:21:51] service yeah so much for my abilities
[1:21:54] yeah so much for who I
[1:21:56] am and then God comes in spite of
[1:22:01] that and
[1:22:03] moves just reminder don't you like it
[1:22:06] when you get a reminder a friendly a
[1:22:08] friendly
[1:22:10] reminder that God is so kind to remind
[1:22:12] us without me you are
[1:22:17] nothing we don't care what people say
[1:22:20] about us our name ain't nothing it's his
[1:22:23] name our life is it's nothing it's his
[1:22:26] life it's his power not our power and
[1:22:29] there is only one thing that we love to
[1:22:31] do is to see him glorified amen and how
[1:22:36] can it be when he's glorified in Us by
[1:22:40] his resurrection that's in us we see him
[1:22:45] represented again as he was that's right
[1:22:48] today amen yes
[1:22:51] wow God would love us so
[1:22:55] much going back to earlier in the
[1:22:57] service this
[1:22:58] flesh this flesh gets to be a Dwelling
[1:23:02] Place of the Lord God Almighty Elohim
[1:23:07] amen we could go down through all the
[1:23:09] Redemptive names all the glorified names
[1:23:12] and God said I'm going to let that dwell
[1:23:14] in
[1:23:15] you oh nothing to boast about but it's
[1:23:18] not nothing to be ashamed of Amen he's
[1:23:22] glorified in Us by his resurrection
[1:23:24] that's in we see him represented again
[1:23:26] as he was today did you get that see our
[1:23:30] desire is not to be glorified our desire
[1:23:32] is not some big name our desire is not
[1:23:35] to boost some church or make more in the
[1:23:38] Sunday school or try to bring in hog tie
[1:23:41] push in offer a picnic party or bring
[1:23:43] Stars buttons or something else like
[1:23:47] that oh man I tell you I'll just share a
[1:23:53] little something real quick to you I
[1:23:55] just ask a young lady here a couple days
[1:23:58] ago what their Church does on a Sunday
[1:24:02] evening for their young people they
[1:24:05] watched a
[1:24:07] movie and then they took line dance
[1:24:14] lessons H anybody
[1:24:18] interested no because that's not who we
[1:24:22] are that's right and I don't say that
[1:24:24] boastfully and I don't say that
[1:24:26] derogatory to them but that's not what
[1:24:29] we
[1:24:35] are our desire is to see him glorified
[1:24:38] glorified what not with self- pride but
[1:24:41] in us our lives to prove he is alive and
[1:24:45] living in us if I can get myself out of
[1:24:49] the way can we just stop there for a
[1:24:52] second please don't read ahead
[1:24:57] could we lift a hand tonight and say if
[1:24:59] I could just get myself out of the
[1:25:02] way I get myself out of the way and and
[1:25:05] this would just go so much better now I
[1:25:07] want to I'm not making no emphasis I
[1:25:10] think a guy could build a Doctrine off
[1:25:11] this quote
[1:25:15] though so when William brandham is not
[1:25:18] even thought of amen
[1:25:22] amen you follow me we could start a deal
[1:25:26] nope nothing about William brandom any
[1:25:29] longer but we'd be
[1:25:32] wrong but he's saying when William
[1:25:34] Brown's not even thought of and oh just
[1:25:39] ruined my
[1:25:41] theory oh and you not even thought of
[1:25:46] till we can see Jesus glorified among us
[1:25:51] see him that's our desire can we say
[1:25:55] Amen tonight that is our desire is to
[1:25:59] not see you not see someone else not see
[1:26:02] this great Minister not to see this the
[1:26:04] prophet of God didn't want it to be
[1:26:06] about him he even declared I never did
[1:26:09] this to draw people to me that's right
[1:26:12] Amen to be lifted up to draw people to
[1:26:15] me and my brother and sisters see this
[1:26:17] right here is
[1:26:18] corrective that's right this is not just
[1:26:21] a directive quote this is a corrective
[1:26:23] quote amen he's not saying get your eyes
[1:26:26] off of me and get them back on Christ
[1:26:28] he's also pointing into this to say here
[1:26:32] is what is going to make the difference
[1:26:35] for you that's
[1:26:37] right see him that's our desire that's
[1:26:41] the gives us the quickening power and it
[1:26:43] gives us joy to know that we are with
[1:26:45] him both flesh and bone of him being the
[1:26:48] Bride of him and seeing his same
[1:26:51] Vindicated methods proving
[1:26:56] that's right can we say the next word in
[1:27:00] in that's not just a book my brother and
[1:27:03] sister that's not a tablet that's not a
[1:27:06] tape it's got to be in
[1:27:09] US
[1:27:11] amen eat the book amen eat the
[1:27:15] book seeing the same vindictive methods
[1:27:18] proving in us that he is now risen from
[1:27:21] the
[1:27:22] dead right where's the proof of the
[1:27:25] resurrection right here tonight that's
[1:27:27] right amen sister Ruth will you come
[1:27:30] amen hallelujah I don't know Saints I
[1:27:33] hope that it came out that way but this
[1:27:35] just makes me happy makes me happy
[1:27:38] realize that that as we move forward God
[1:27:41] has says you know what some of these
[1:27:44] vessels to honor some to
[1:27:47] dishonor you might not even be able to
[1:27:50] really tell a lot of difference right so
[1:27:52] close to deceive the very elect yeah I
[1:27:54] mean some of these vessels are in
[1:27:56] humaniz
[1:28:00] perfect but which one does God choose to
[1:28:03] fill that's what matters it's not what
[1:28:06] you and I see of the vessel but it's
[1:28:09] whether God will fill it or not and God
[1:28:12] has come can someone lift a hand and say
[1:28:15] God has filled me amen I have evidence
[1:28:18] that God has filled me and will fill me
[1:28:20] again hallelujah hallelujah Amen brother
[1:28:25] Isaac my throat's got a little bit
[1:28:35] of oh I guess I have one more
[1:28:38] quote I almost missed that one I'll just
[1:28:41] jump ahead I'll skip the writing in
[1:28:42] between here
[1:28:45] amen his Word of Promise reflected
[1:28:50] him in her that's right it wasn't what I
[1:28:54] did wasn't what you did it was his Word
[1:28:57] of Promise that did the reflecting
[1:29:00] that's it they had to take notice to
[1:29:02] Peter and them they hadn't been to a
[1:29:05] seminary they know that they hadn't been
[1:29:08] to any Bible School some Theological
[1:29:10] Seminary they had no education CU they
[1:29:13] couldn't even write their own name the
[1:29:15] Bible said they were ignorant and
[1:29:17] unlearned but what happened they had to
[1:29:21] take note that they had been
[1:29:24] with
[1:29:25] Jesus amen oh Lord let that be let that
[1:29:30] be something that the world would see
[1:29:32] and take note that we've been with Jesus
[1:29:36] amen for there he was with them
[1:29:38] reflecting his promise Hallelujah glory
[1:29:41] to God that's what we need in this age

[1:30:01] that we should be able to say Amen to
[1:30:03] every word of
[1:30:04] God that amen shouldn't just be for
[1:30:07] someone to hear us but that amen should
[1:30:11] be something a praise a worship a love
[1:30:14] expressed from us that's right not to
[1:30:17] the world out here but our soul your
[1:30:21] soul my soul speaking
[1:30:24] out to Christ himself right in other
[1:30:28] words you might not hear out loud amen
