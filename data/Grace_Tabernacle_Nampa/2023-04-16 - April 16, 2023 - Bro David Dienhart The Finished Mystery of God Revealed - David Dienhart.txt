Lord and you shall have the son he that hath the son hath life and whom the son sets free is free indeed o God how we thank you for Revelation Lord the revealing of your son and us is our brother Paul said in the scripture took me from my mother's womb to reveal his son and me we thank you for that new birth we know that seed had to be there for that to come to life and for you to be revealed in us the seed was laying there to begin that germ was in you before the foundation of the world The Germ that we were and what we are found us father in this day okay it comes through your word we thank you for the message of the hour the word of the hour that Lord has spoken forth and we are born from above Lord we thank you for this we thank you for your mercy now Lord we give the service to you and every individual to your hands we ask your blessing upon your word your word will never return to your Void but it will accomplish what you sent it to do we are expecting that to be Lord open the hearts of the people to the word for the season may they see their position in place we pray for that is your desire that is why this message has come father to bring to manifestation personally to us individually that we may see our position in Christ we thank you for your mercy now we give you praise in Jesus Christ's name as we commit the furthering of this service to you and For Your Glory amen [Music] amen praise the Lord how many is ready to go home [Music] you want to raise your hand how many is ready to go home some are some aren't I trust the rest of you are and will be you realize that without being birthed from above there's no rapture for you we can't presume brother sister we cannot pursue while I presume I'm all right you can't presume you have to know the new birth is not a presuming the new birth is annoying right it's Jesus Christ revealed in you amen and that is not a hearsay that's not an emotion that's not a feeling it's a revelation it's a substance amen we're thankful for is to the truth so let's not presume just because you you can you can do a lot of they have pictures of the Prophet you have messages in your home that doesn't save you come to church that doesn't save you being a part of a group doesn't save you but being born into the body of Christ does amen amen while you're standing you turn with me to Revelations 10. I'll just read something here I didn't this is towards the back of the service and sometimes the Lord will take it I mean to the all the way from the back now bring It Forward brother Branham and Samaritan Church age Church age book he was asked the question what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God we are what we have set forth be much easier for all to understand if they believe the doctrine of the Oneness of the godhead without that Revelation brother sister remember what he told Peter he said Peter Thou Art Peter an individual and he says you this Revelation didn't come by intellectual learning it came from my father he revealed this to you and upon this revelation of who I am I'll build my church amen my body and he says he says for there are not three persons in the godhead but one thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of Jesus coming in and then subsequent to that the Holy Spirit coming in to give you us power he says there aren't two comings of the spirit just one the trouble is that people don't know the real truth and they simply believe in Jesus for remission of sin but never go on to receive the spirit you remember you remember that you got to you can't you've got to go further you've got to go all the way in who can go all the way in only the elect but I pray that we're all elect and who doesn't it's just that in the elect the seed is laying there The Germ was laying there to be quickened amen that's the only one that can be born again because the new birth is Christ in you revealed and it takes the water of the Holy the baptism to baptize that seed amen amen and then you move you're sealed into the body then you grow as you lay in the presence of the Sun the message of the hour you grow amen you're growing into a stature and that stature is Christ in you amen that's who you are now I said a lot in those statements a lot could be said about it and a lot more to be said about it but let's just go to our message now my title here is the finished mystery of God revealed the finished mystery of God revealed what is the mystery of God revealed who is it is Christ it's Christ the finished mystery of God revealed amen I'll give you my subject in just a moment I'd like you to turn with me to Revelations chapter 10. beginning with the first verse we'll read the whole chapter so it can be a little bit of reading here so bear with me just stick with me on this and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud sounds like Acts chapter 1 verse 11. not only sounds like it it is and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on Earth notice the little book he had in his hand was open and he and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices other words what was uttered was the Revelation contained in the seals because the book was a sealed book with Seven Seals and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not same thing it was told Daniel in chapter 12 seal the book the book is sealed to the time of the end and we find here that we and I'll I'll just skip oh no I will read it and the angel which I saw upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand excuse me his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer so so he's declaring now he said that that this this time no longer is at the end but in the days of The Voice but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished so told us when it would be done it was the time of the end or other words time no longer is delayed brother Branham said though sealed being open tell us that we've arrived it's the end time he said how long now before we meet in the air I don't know amen but he said this was to come at the time of the end all right but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels this is message of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as the as he hath declared unto his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard what was John type bride and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open was closed it was the sealed now it's open it's unsealed brother Graham said our message is Revelations 10. the opening of The Seven Seals he said one place it's the opening of the seventh seal all right complete completion and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book that is which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth brother Branham spoke of a book within the book he said there is another record that pertains to the bride though contained in the Book of Life and it's a little book brother Brown said it was called it was the bride book and he said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me unlike its ownership give me it was open to somebody give me the little book and he said unto me take it I wonder if you can hear him saying that this morning take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter in other words in other words you're going to have struggles your child people are going to misunderstand you're going to be persecuted they're they're going to think you're speaking a foreign language it is foreign but it's not unknown right it is another language it's the birth from above it's a Heavenly language it's the revelation of the hour the message of the hour and take it and make thy biller bitter thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey amen and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again gonna ride the trail again she the brother Brown said would ride this Trail again must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and King where is the final voice in the bride the bride is the final voice amen amen she is the final voice he said before many people's Nations tongues and kings amen all right you may be seated subject is redeemed possession his redeemed possession claimed a subject is his redeemed possession or we could say she his redeemed possession claim I say claim the there the little book's been opened the marriage certificate is open how many know that that that's what the prophet said rise in their invisible union he said what are we speaking about here this little book this book that's been opened to the bride and brother Brown said only those seals were open to the bride not open to everybody else it's open to the bride notice who ate the book bride ate the book it's her book take it and eat it bride take it and eat it all right the original we're talking about here the little book open the marriage certificate is open This Record of his life of himself is opened the seals the seals have been taken off of your life bride the seals have been taken off of your position the hidden Mystery is now a revelation amen and that claims that bride who's that last one I don't know it may be in already we don't know amen but it's going to come to that time but it's known by revelation you can't get it by all your studying and studying is okay but you'll never study doesn't do it it's revealed to you sovereignly by God it's a revelation given to you amen it's the it's the revealing of the word for the hour and season revealed to you it's not a group Affair this is not a group Affair this is an individual Affair we sit here in a church but it's not about the church you go to it's an individual receiving this revelation of this message she's the living message she's The Voice it's not another voice that came through your Prophet it's the same voice but the voice went somewhere and the voice had to be made manifest and so it's manifested in Bride form who is the son the son of man the word himself is revealed in Bride form you say all the Brother David these things are too deep no they're not too deep it just takes a new birth to see it it's not hidden brother sister this isn't something it's just for somebody else it is individual but it's for you it's for you bride it's for the bride God's focus is to take a bride of his heart choosing that's his heart purpose was have a bride of his own choosing and that choosing was in himself for the Bible said you are chosen in him before the foundation of the world you didn't have anything to do with it no more than Jacob had anything to do with it or Esau had anything to do with it amen it's it's him chosey choosing you and because he chose you you can say yes otherwise you'd never say yes unless you had a predestination there laying there a germ that was in him to begin with comes by the word and finds you through the word through the message of the day that germ had to be there first amen that germ had to be there first it had to come from your father amen that's right God help us God help us to see these things they're not just words spoken in a distance something that feels good you say Brother David you preach it over it's God speaking to you a message not just David it's the ministry of the hour it's the ministry of the time it's the ministry of the season what is the season the revealing of the seventh seal unknown to everybody but the bride is the season if she catches it right she sees it how many there is I don't know but there's going to be very very few he said that are going to be in the bride but we have the message for the going home the message has been given to us for the going home of the Bride we don't have just a fly-by-night message we have a message of the complete revelation of Christ The Finnish mystery of Christ who is the mystery of Christ revealed amen that has to come out that has to be made manifest before there's a millennium it takes us right back to then that place again right back to where we left off it's restored right back this is God's achievement it's not a man's achievement it's God's achievement brother sisters not men among us we need to get our eyes off of men Philip Paul said I have no confidence in the flesh man can't do a thing I can't do a thing for you as a man but the revelation of this message that lays had been revealed in your hearts done everything for you it's already ordained it it's already done for you it's already finished work you just need to walk in the light and there's going to be somebody that walks in the light okay I don't want to keep going I've got a lot here and I want to get done and so what are we speaking of here the original life remember my subject part of my subject the original Life The Original Seed the original word is the bride the True Believer the original Life The Original Seed and the original word is the bride the True Believer there is True Believers today in Earth today there has been in every Age A True Believer to that age to that message of that age there's ones that truly believe that word and had it a revelation within them so the bride is the True Believer is the original life The Original Seed the original word and I'm going to say this I'll come back to it but the faith what is that True Believer the True Believer brother Branham said is the faith of God moving in you what are we speaking about here Hebrews 11 1 now Revelation which is faith faith is a revelation now Revelation is the substance it's not an imagination it's not a presumption it is actual substance now Revelation is the substance of things for and it is the evidence of Things Not Seen amen you wonder what the evidence is what is what is the True Believer the faith of God the substance of God moving in you you are ordained to this season you come in your decreed season and God met you with the word and you recognize your presence and your position by revelation it's all about Brother David if I could you just scuff twin to figure it out and get into the book and start reading it and asking God to reveal it to you without a new birth how can you say that Jesus is Lord you can't without a new birth because he's not a was he is it is Jesus Christ is he that believeth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God is born again amen all right God so we're speaking this is my subject what is it God's Great revelation brother Adam said Christ revealed in you is God's Great Revelation he said the great he said the great Revelation the great event that we're dealing with today he said is his coming that's coming to take us home in a resurrection in a rapture he said that paid paragraph 33 invisible Union amen amen it's happening but it isn't known to everybody but is that my purpose no my purpose is here to spread the light and it's up to God to reveal it it's up God to reveal it but he gives us a way to come through and that's a message of the hour and there's a filter there to draw through life which will manifest and bring to pass the manifestation of Jesus Christ in the bride form in you because it was laying there the German life with the seed would laying there and that seed quick and be any other person but Christ's in you amen so we're dealing about a great Revelation a great mystery we're talking about this morning a great mystery which is the seventh Angel's message of Revelations 10. the Revelation 10 message that we're speaking about here is the Capstone message it's the capping what's the capping no more it can't go beyond the cap It's the final caps the bride off caps the body off hey many men so I just read Revelations 10. which is what I'm going to say this and I'm coming through these different things I want to just kind of stay in line here it's himself in Bride form revealed unveiled it's the unveiling of himself and bride form the hidden Mystery the second coming of Christ that's already begun brother sister and it culminates in the catching away and the meeting in the air but the coming is happening it is a second Advent of Christ there had to be this manifestation in Revelation to fulfill his to fulfill the word Adam could not be complete until the mystery of Adam was revealed in flesh Hallelujah the dead this day this scripture and I'm gonna I'm going to it right now this day this scripture let me just read it hear what it is this day brother around preached the message go back and hear it if you want to but this day this and you should this day this scripture is fulfilled watch what he said is fulfilled here on this message now this day there's to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham and we know that's Christ there can't be any other super Royal Seed of Abraham that's Royal Seed of Abraham is Christ amen but God had a hidden Mystery he wanted to finish the mystery are you hearing he wants to finish the mystery and had to finish it in other words it wouldn't be complete as it was in Genesis chapter 2 verse 21-24 out of Adam came the mystery of Adam she was the mystery of Adam revealed amen all right now he said so we read it here he said now we're quoting out of out of this day this scripture fulfilled now in this day there's to come us come a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly what it would be would be a royal bride now he's talking about the seed the Royal seed and it would be a royal bride which is it brother brother brother uh brother Branham is it is it is it Christ or the bride it is Christ the bride who is that that's the son of man revealed when that word became flesh and dwelled among us we were in him bed as we were in Adam he went to Calvary with us in him he hadn't been separated yet but Calvary separated it and the water blood and spirit that makes up that that manifestation of that bride is come from him she can't be any other but him Satan hates this revelation right he'll fight every way he can against it because when that comes personalized to you you've got a new body waiting those that he called he justified declared righteous those he justified he has already he's already glorified to finish work to you oh God help us the thing is so simple it goes beyond human understanding that's exactly what it is he said you're trying to make her something I'm not making myself anybody but I'm very special and you're very special to him I am his house where was where did God pour himself only God was he poured himself into one man the fullness of the godhead bodily was in Jesus Christ where was his house that's that Jesus Christ Our Lord is the full is the full Masterpiece a peace was taken from him that had to be brought back to his position and kept kid until this hour that's what produces a body chain that's what brings us to a rapture Hallelujah we ought to be feeding on this message if you really realize what it meant to have this message it's the going home it's the it's the Rapture of the Bride it's the resurrection voice being voiced out of you is there a resurrection voice this little bride is the resurrection he said I am the resurrection when he said I am the resurrection Martha got a hold of the Revelation and went calling for her sister and said he's calling for you he never said her name he didn't say go Martha go call for Mary but Martha got a hold of the Revelation and went to Mary and said he call it for you who's calling for you today this morning who's calling for you the revelation of the word for the season is calling for you Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever is calling for you to come up higher what is this voice that this bride is it's the resurrection in life right Hallelujah and it's becoming this materializing itself in the form he said it would have to come in in the form it was like capping the capping of Hall of Creation in in Chapter 2 of Genesis under the seventh day she was the Capstone revelation amen you can't go any higher than that our our our and our maturity is the Capstone what is the Capstone it's Christ it's Jesus Christ amen we grow up into him when you have the Holy Ghost you're sealed but that Holy Ghost grows and it grows and what's it going to grow into the very stature of himself what is the message in our it's himself coming to himself it's word coming to word it's the word coming to the predestinated word amen it's not another substance it's himself today you say you're pretty you're pretty certain I'm positive of that yeah it's an unusual voice Brother David how could you how to be careful brother you know you're speaking on the internet and you know there's people going to hear that and they're going to think you're a fanatic yes what has that got to do with us when this Revelation comes that I'm United with this bridegroom what difference does it make what flesh thinks who is your absolute yourself your flesh your senses are you married to your senses are you married to your flesh are you married to Jesus Christ the word of God of this hour who are who are you to the message or your flesh who do you have confidence in I can't explain a thing I'm saying here to you I can't do it because it's revelation but I see it personally I see it and know it's the truth and I see it working in me day after day after day after day identifying himself well you just speak too loud you're mean just what they did with Jesus you being a man make yourself God you judge after the flesh Jesus said I don't judge any man after the flesh Paul said we judge no man we hereby no no man after the flesh excuse me my nose runs I run my nose runs faster okay so what are we seeing here let's go read further so in this message This Promise would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed so they that have the spiritual seed if the spiritual seed is quickened they are spiritual Oh Brother David we don't want to hear that you make yourself too spiritual I can't get myself spiritual enough Revelation it isn't me trying to bring myself anything it's the word that's inside of you revealed to the day and the season and your eyes come open and it's a mystery that's been hidden revealed that's bride listen he said this second coming he says now it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be watch a prophet prophesying there is to be a spiritual bride raise up which will be the Royal seed of the royal faith or if you could just recognize yourself a Believer people somebody is are we preaching the message for the season are we preaching the message of another season this is bride time this is bride age this is the seed time this is the life I will come to you in the time of life this is the time of life Hallelujah he said will be a royal seed to the Royal faith of Abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise given to her not to everybody else to her am I speaking to bride this morning yeah absolutely I am this message would not go out unless there's somebody here that has an ear to hear it and if it isn't a here to hear it then you're being warned this message this is the message the seventh seal mystery was his coming and it goes to happening so simple because of their understanding they did not Envision it that way let go of your understanding lean not to your own understanding but acknowledge trust in the Lord with all your heart lean not to your own understanding you're understanding human understanding will lead you astray and you'll get puffed up thinking you've got something that you have and it's not even with the word and yet anointed your spirit can be anointed and you still are a devil on the inside of your soul and it can be Anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost what am I telling you the revealing of the word for the season having an ear to hear is the evidence that you're in him he didn't say he would reveal this to everybody else he said it would be revealed to his bride and only her only she can receive the secret life this would go to everybody else around everywhere it doesn't go to everyone else it goes to her my yeah I'm happy I'm not I'm not upset I'm happy I'm happy because these things aren't just happen chance to me they are substance inside of me becoming more substance more real more real more real they're being personalized and here's a witness they're being personalized she becomes the same self person not another person she's the same person it's not another God it's the same God condescending from God above us to being God With Us now it's God in you not another God it's the same God amen amen amen all right so he said she's to come on the scene and their promise then in paragraph five that was paragraph 151 this day of scripture fulfilled on paragraph 578 of Christ The Mystery of God revealed now we see the promise being fulfilled now we see what's he speaking of he's speaking of the mystery of God revealed he said now we see the promise of God we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ Christ the true headship going in coming in where you going bride you're marching you're the word marching and step with the word where are you going up how are we going to do that the Seal's been open the seventh seal been opened that's how we do it do you think it's any power overall no it's himself revealing himself into her that's her her him himself in her she is him and let me say this he is she yes sir yes sir and we see the Promise now he didn't say we're going to do he said now we do now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship is there anything higher than the headship comes right down here to a point a fine point amen comes to a fine Razor Edge of difference the difference is revelation of the word not emotion nothing else can tell the difference if it's a true Revelation it'll speak from Revelation to the Book of Genesis to Revelation it's going to be he can't change it comes down to a fine Razor Edge why why is it so close it would deceive the elective possible because both are anointed by the same water same rain same Sons on both the seed that was planted hey many many many men when you catch the Revelation that you're the seed a True Believer quick hand the word Quicken the season the word for the season Quicken you see your position bride amen nothing is going to take you out of that position can't your position was always eternal yeah amen it always was you were in him always that Revelation was to be unfolded in this hour the the fullness of that Revelation was here to be revealed in this hour the seventh Angels message let us be glad and rejoice the marriage of the Lamb is come marriage certificate can't be opened only at the marriage it's a sealed it's a sealed thing until the marriage then it's unveiled to the public this is she this is he how can she come and not be he and how can he come and not be she now that's not me saying that the prophet said that the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride then how can she come on the scene and not be he and how can he come on the scene and not be she amen it's another tongue yeah sure is yeah right it is another tongue but it's not unknown because the day of Penny costs 3 000 of them heard it the other said these are men of new wine they're drunken they think they are we don't know what they're saying the 3 000 of them did and said what must we do yeah and the prescription was given amen it wasn't an unknown talk it was known and the Nations heard it every man out of Egypt in Saudi Arabia Syria and up in Asia they were all assembled right there and they heard it speak in their own language and they were moved inside of here like the little Eagle in the barnyard when that mothered eagle screams something stirred inside of him and said that sounds real the rest of them didn't have the germ but you were a germ you were bribed to begin with brother sister you were Jesus Christ the son of the Living God to begin with that's your identification and everything he was you are oh my I'm getting ahead of myself all right I'll come to that in just a minute if I can get off the first page all right now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ's going in headship going in going in coming in David when he heard the sound of it going he couldn't do anything against those Philistine until he heard the sound of the going then he raised up and come against them but David I imagine he sweated it out those Philistines are getting closer they're assembling more and more and his reasoning said oh God has reasoning just started kind of trying to take over take over but he remembered I hear the voice I hear the voice saying don't you go until you hear the sound of a GOI I wonder if we've heard the message of the going or if you've heard the message of the going and the coming in who's coming in what Advent is this he went away enveloped in the cloud he comes returns in the cloud amen turn it to the right who do you see who's he uniting with now what form will he be in he's here he's come the Bible said he would he had come again to receive you unto himself that where I am you may be also he's brother Bram said he's come to take you and to call you bring you bring you call you personally individually out here to for a resurrection it is the resurrection for a resurrection it is the rapture for a rapture amen are you with me if you have that faith that something got to happen in the in the in the full realization of it doesn't it but first it's faith first it's substance and what does God see what does God accept what is God receiving what does God see in Abraham his faith what did man see in Abraham his works that declared his faith is that right both Abraham both Paul and James were speaking of Faith he said one the man sees the manifestation of the faith and God sees the faith so there's got to be there's got to be a dynamic on the mechanics you can't worship him except you worship Him in spirit and in truth there's going to be Dynamics and mechanics come together you say I have the word I have the word but you don't have the Dynamics well I have the Dynamics I have the Dynamics and no word until the two come together you will not see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today ever and forever in you you won't see the message of the hour because the message the hour is she it's he manifested revealed as she for the meeting see it's just come so simple it just goes right through the people does that make me anybody make you anybody if you have the river not a thing it just makes me know I'm his always was I was this eternal thought existing substance is actual existence all right so the so we see the bride coming of now we see the Promise being doing the same Works what's the bride doing now Comes The Faith from Faith to works now we now he said doing the same works that he did at the beginning making ready and fulfilling his word as he did it first in Saint John 14 12. remember they both real wheat and weed and the wild wheat both have the same Reign and the same and they both believe in signs wonders and miracles but one is the word and the other isn't and they're shouting the same time do I believe in shouting you better believe I do I'm not speaking the thing against shouting I'm just telling you it's not the evidence that you're the word because you have any of those gifts brother Brown said I wish I could tell you that those gifts is the evidence and First Corinthians 12 he said it is not the evidence it's the evidence that the holy spirit's doing those great works but it's not the evidence that you are in filled and have him in you see that's a great Revelation that had to be opened under you see what it is so don't shoot your confidence in anything else but that word in you a substance the evidence of the Rapture the substance the evidence of your body change the substance and the evidence of Christ in you personalize you and he are one you have the substance you have the evidence I didn't I I certainly love good works but your good works without faith will never get you in the rapture unless you have the revelation of this message in you living moving that's the faith of God that's the True Believer the faith of God is the Revelation which is the substance of God revealed in you that's his body his bride can't be anything but himself revealed Jesus Christ is the revelation of the word well brother Brad and brother Baptist come bro brother man we don't believe in any Revelation then you cannot believe in Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is the revelation of the word in his season sometimes I wonder if we don't have a lot of Baptists around the message they're depending on baptism Baptist theology this message did away with all those theologies this message brought Jesus Christ face to face with you personally your absolute isn't resting and what you thinking about and what others think about it and what others well they do they'll think I'm offending it if I don't be this kind and this kind you can be kind all you want I'll never put you in the Rapture and I believe in being kind Jesus was kind but there's a difference between compassion and ophelial and compassion agape there's a difference between sympathy and compassion that's another message but I'll just drop that in compassion is doing the will of God in its season and that has to be a revelation to you or you're doing it outside of faith because if you if it's not a revelation and you have no right to speak it say it's going to happen because I spoke it without Revelation it's empty the just shall live by feelings Works no the just shall live by faith right amen now he said and so his word John 14 12 he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he Dulce did you notice that he that believeth in me when did you believe in him before the foundation of the world you believed in him if you weren't in there believing in him before the world began you're not a Believer now can't be because a real believer is born again born again again means from above his birth from above the real believer is birthed from above until your birth from above The Works of God cannot be made manifest that be manifesting that faith because that faith is not your faith it's not an intellectual Faith it's the faith of God which is perfect and it's his perfect love it's his love and how how do you know you love him because he first loved you how do you know you know him because he knew you he told others I didn't know you I will like all the works we did we prophesied in your name we've done Mighty many many works in your name why they're good people I'm not talking about bad people I'm talking about good people today but because you're a good person doesn't put you in the rapture [Applause] it's got to be the revelation of God's own faith in you that identifies the rapture what raised Jesus from the dead Same Spirit if it be in you as it was in him it'll Quicken your mortal body is that right all right then in not only a Quicken your mortal body to be changed someday it's quickening you right now bringing you subject to the word and if you don't see that Spirit swinging you sub to the word you do not have the Holy Ghost you see that your your desires and your Ambitions for the things of the world and the lover of the world and the lover of material and lover of these things you don't have the love of God even in you I see you say that's hard that's not hard that's the word you read as well as I do the problem is you're not reading it the problem is you're not feeding on it the problem is you're not laying in the presence of the word of the message of the hour and feeding on it your two took up with your iPhones and your iPads and your internet and yours and your social media that's ruining you is taking you off of the word killing the influence of the word you'll put that way over the other things of the word and what it is it idolatry you think Paul said I pre-charge you if that's what you call hard wait till it gets hard you're going to wish someday you heard it hard wake up you don't sleep in this time you have a message you ought to be you ought to be every sport every moment you can to get alone with God y'all take every moment you can to be in prayer you ought to take every moment you can to be in this word I'm not saying there's good things in this thing and that thing but it's taking the people over they're being influenced through that and they're picking up on that Spirit instead of the spirit of this word you can have that letter all you want God never made us a minister of the letter he made us a minister of the spirit amen in that letter he may he gave us his own mind you must be spiritual to no spiritual things you must be spiritual by revelation of the word and mind of God in you to even see and know the supernatural to even know Jesus Christ personally you must be born from above you could have you could have the compassion and I'm not against compassion but Jesus walked through a multitude of people lame hot blind children cripples everything and went to one man had a prostate trouble and he asked his question why'd you do that because he said the son can do nothing but what the father shows him and that same that same that same compassion that same spirit that he lived by that did the will of God that same thing will be among the bride and it will be that Unity between the bride and the groom it'll be that same Harmony she will do what she does by revelation of the word that's real compassion it's not human compassion feel your love is human agape love is God not against human compassion I wish all people could be good but that's not putting you in the message that doesn't mean you're in the message that doesn't mean I'm talking about the message being Jesus Christ doesn't mean you're in him until you're born from above and this word that he is this message that he is this Revelation that he is the hour the present tense hour that he is there's always brother Brown said a present tense hour that was the hour he spoke here it was always at present tense hour do you realize what you're seeing in Bride form is his appearing he has to appear to come and he has to come or he hasn't appeared all right then the head and the body are becoming one and brother Brown said they're no longer Twain they're one before the resurrection he said they are one okay let's go back here to this let me continue right here he said the marriage I said the bride coming of Christ that's the second Advent acts 1 11 culminates with the meeting in the air amen well people always put the second coming is only that meeting in the air oh brother unless you see that Union you'll never meet him in the air it's got to be he here or you can't lay in his presence it's got to be he that's come or you can't lay in his presence there's got to be a marriage an invisible Union you just don't go in there by yourself you're going to meet him it's him and the message the opening of the seals the opening of the seventh seal was the unveiling of himself to you bride you seem like no other woman can seem amen he's unveiled himself and you come to yourself why that's me the unveiling himself we look into that mirror of the message of the hour and what do you see you see his glory which is his bride which is himself he does not share his glory with another he can't Sherry Glory will not share his glory with another but you're not another scripture makes it very clear the same word that speaks of the groom speaks for the bride is the bride same word you're not another in fact the Bible said in Isaiah 60 thy light has come Rises I let it come in the glory the Lord is risen upon thee so you must be a part of him all right now let's look at this the marriage of the Lamb is come you must come through your real Pentecostal blessing but there's something beyond that is what I'm trying to get across to you today brother Brandon made it very clear we are not preaching the Pentecostal message he said we're in the bride age and this is the raptured age he said we've gone beyond that he didn't say we don't go through that if you don't come through that there will never be a bride age for you the corner had to be turned and you can't get the home unless you pass third base you can't stop at third and say I got it all you need to go round third and make the corner now you're on your way home amen amen there was justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again what's your position the word again the mystery of Christ revealed now you may be sitting right here disagreeing with me that's all right I'm not responsible whether you disagree with me or not I'm not looking at your reactions God will reveal his word to whom he will it's not my reactions I am commissioned by God to preach the message for the season right and I got to preach it in the way God gives it to me to preach you may not like it I may not like it very well but he does it I say I David and I David doesn't like much of anything he does that's my flesh man but that enemy is defeated by the opened word he took the seals off of my life and I see that I was in him before the foundation of the world existing in his thinking what is it that comes predestinated eternally from God the thought it being expressed is word so it's the thought or the seed that comes predestinated eternally from God wasn't Jacob Jacob was a seed is that right but Jacob was a shyster outwardly but what about the inside of him Esau was a better moral man Kinder man gentler man fed his daddy did Greater Works but he had no desire for the birthright he had no desire for the new birth he couldn't just as as as Judas could not come up to Pentecost to receive the Holy Ghost because if he did he'd had to come through the blood and Satan can't come through the blood and if he did he would be one of us he'd be my brother born from above and Peter started right there and said now take Faith and add virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance tempered godliness patience patience godliness godliness brotherly love what are you growing into sealed by God you're going into an adoption a perfect placing and you've already received the spirit for that adoption the Bible said you have received the spirit of adoption amen and that spirit's got to take you right into Capstone material and that's why the message came to show you you are one with him the Capstone The Headstone this is who you are all right now the marriage of the Lamb has come it's an invisible Union amen we're really where were they that were ready had the Holy Ghost born again they that were ready they started really ex ready in the word getting ready in the word and they were ready went in with him to the marriage and when the last one come in the door was shut all right all right and brother Branham now I'm going to bring you a quote here I'm going to bring it to you what he said he said he said this invisible Union is a secret known only to the bride his wife his it's which is his wife is happening now we are in the bride's Revival which is seed time time of life it's a bride Revival he said the bride age bride time it's bride time it's bride age he said it's seed Time Is Here he said life I've got that quote here but I'll just say it life is back in the grain again What followed the Pentecostal experience the ripening of the Grain and it had to leave the shook because the shock denominational pain I'm not talking about denominational Pentecost but denominational Pentecost went to shuck amen and the life moved right out of it the same Pentecostal experience brother Ram said that same Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost started without an ending but the point that people will get is it grows where's it girly it took a message to bring it to maturity it took a message beyond the Pentecost to bring what was birthed to maternity that's why the seals were open that's why God kept it shut until the message of the seventh angel which was Revelations 10 which was the seventh seal and brother man said the Revelation in the seventh seal is the mystery of his coming it's the revelation of his coming and he said that secret which was a secret wasn't a public show this Union is not a public show it's you as an individual I want that to stick home you could be one out of a family but it's you as an individual one out of a church but what do you have to feed upon the word for the season and how you're going to know the word for the season unless you're born again you'll never know the word for the season are you see see you say Brother David you're just making it too complicated really I think it's pretty simple all right now so we see the Promise being fulfilled then the head and the body are becoming one are becoming one in Works yes which is Faith Express and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promise word for the last days he promised this in the last days now he just got done telling you what the promise was she's come on the scene all right who's she he who's she he all right come on the scene in the last days he said now if you're spiritual you'll catch it First Corinthians and see I'm not going to get through this so I just helped me maybe Lord willing make it a part two okay because I started a little late here so I'm gonna I'm watching my time First Corinthians chapter 2. and verse 14 verse 13. which things we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but what the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things was spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God that's why you can't look at their flesh no confidence in it but the natural man receiveth not the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned all right but he that is spiritual Oh you mean somebody you mean who are we talking about here Christ the bride Christ the bride until she be taken out of the way he who letteth will let all right you know the quote I'm at there back in Thessalonians he who letteth will let him till he be taken out of the way he's letting that Antichrist Spirit go out here running among the people rampant not in realizing what's happening and he who letteth will let until he Christ the bride that's exact words until he Christ the bride is taken out of the way all right what's where well what's happening what's happening she's going right off in a rapture it's only for her only you better not presume you can't presume this all right now but he that is spiritual judgeth all things desert that judging is discerning yet he himself is judged of no man the man can't judge it amen are you with me all right then for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ there it is who's we how do you know you're identified the day is the day of identification okay only known to the wife is happening now it's seed time proving his word 1964 and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so it will be the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more church as a church no not no more the bride is called see he is in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the the bride or church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride okay what's the message to do unite the bride to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this this what's this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together when the son of man Jesus Christ will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man like it was to Sarah and Abraham I put that in there Jesus Christ not another Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh among us today and will make his word so real that it will unite the church the bride and him as one and then she and then she'll and then she'll go home to the wedding supper blessed are those that are called to the wedding supper you know the wedding suppers part of the marriage but the wedding supper is until after at the rapture three and a half years but the marriage is before that okay listen and he said he said I just see what I mean it's the son of man Jesus Christ not it's a revealing of the son of man not a clergyman see do you see what I mean it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us make his sword so real that it'll unite the bride in him as one then we'll go to the wedding supper amen she's already United when she goes to the wedding supper it's what she says right she's already United see he said we go to the wedding supper not the marriage we go to the wedding supper not the marriage fill yourself go referring to a scripture he said he said come the marriage suppers at hand fill yourself all the Flesh of Mighty Men He said why because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper now you're not going to have a marriage without a celebration of a marriage and that's the wedding supper but first it's a union right right unless that faith of the real believer is inside of you the faith of God you won't go okay I want to I want to jump ahead here and I'm going to have to close paid number 64 of perfect faith I can do nothing of myself why he relied upon what he was amen see at this marriage this Union is where the two become one and then what does it do then it what does that Union do it manifests the son of man again what is the bride's position the manifestation of the son of man again this is her day that was not her day back there this is her day here that's exactly right I got the quote on that if you want it amen it's not yeah right here she's got to be the word not the word for his day she's the word of this day that he promised would be here in this do you see that you're the promise do you see that you're fulfilling scripture that ought to set your soul of fire that ought to set you beyond the point of of why why you have the fear it's identified you're identified you're identified in Christ if Christ fails you fail but you can't fail because you're in the unfailing one and there's no sin hell against you there is no failure you're sinless he that's born of God does not commit sin there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and the spirit of Life hath made me free from the law of sin and death you're no more serving law works you're serving God in his faith amen The Works were finished the law was fulfilled at Calvary now he comes forth to take the book that he redeemed and the lion roars out calling for his Queen to come sit with him by his side in his throne she's anointed such to be his Queen I'm not saying there's going to be more open to her in the Millennium we have to learn how to rule but we've got character on this side we're developing character fit to rule but we also rule on this side did you know that you rule over your own flesh you learn to rule over that taking every thought over your own thoughts taking every thought under obedience to Christ bring it subject to the word why you go through the struggle why is it bitter because your learning character fit to rule you've got to have the character and he will you will have the character you are already in him and his character is being developed but it takes a union to do it amen pouring in of himself she's carrying the Sun for the meeting I tell you it's the same word Same Spirit same word same Revelation Same Spirit in you it was the same spirit in him Same Spirit in him is the Same Spirit in you Same Spirit and Eve Was the Same Spirit of Adam all right now so we see the marriage suppers at hand remember the marriage suppers at Hammond and and they said the kingdom according to the promises ready to be issued in the great Millennium what's next what's his third coming after the wedding supper we return right back to the Millennium Bride and bridegroom right back to it was it was in Eden we pick up right there and for a thousand years set this Earth in its order amen are you with me what for a body change the Earth's body change the earth body change because we're going to have a new heavens and a new Earth but it's got to be cleansed first and you had to be cleansed for him to come in and live his life through you you had to be washed and you have to be washed every day washed and if you want to follow him then you're going to have to take up your cross deny yourself die to yourself die to your reasoning quit trying to quit trying to depend on I'll just say it myself I've quit trying to depend on David for anything it's not David that works in me it's Christ that works in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure and his ways are perfect and because you're in him he made your way perfect now watch I'm closing now watch he said I can do nothing of myself he relied upon what he was the word knowing he relied upon knowing that he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and they was in him that give him Faith because he understood his position let me tell you that position is a positive position and that positive position is your victory because it's your faith it's his faith your faith is the victory that overcometh the world what is the victory it's our faith our Revelation the revelation of what the revelation of him and you and you and him no longer Twain in that day you'll know that I'm in my father my father and you and I in you and you and me my father and me and I and you and you and me that's the Revelation yes then you know who you are it tells you right there if you abide in me and my word abides in you how can you abide in him to begin with without the germ if my word of if you abide in me and my word abides in you then you know who you are just catch a revelation that you're a Believer rely upon what God made you as a believer the believer is the faith of God the believer is the faith of God rely upon that substance of what God said about you you were in his thinking you can't be taken out of his thinking you take out of his thinking God is no more complete he's not complete without you he understood his position that give him Faith because he understood he knew he was the word and that word was in him and that gave him Faith are you realizing what I just said John 15 7. he said in that word God he was the word God made him the word he was the word and they was in that word was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture said he was this does not the same scripture say you are this the same scripture that spoke of the group speaks of the Bride do you not realize brother sister if I could open their eyes I would but I don't have to God's already ordained whose eyes would be open amen all right therefore pay if you have 65 perfect Faith therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that can't we rely upon what God made us as believers does that stand quoting again and if he did that can't we rely rely upon what God made us as Believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was do you realize what he's saying if he that believeth in me the works that I do if you really believe in him he's living him in you he didn't say the works you do he said that you'll do the works I do I will do he worketh hitherto and you work and without that Faith you can't work right he that believeth in me the works that I do I do he's there in you doing it he has to be the one doing it because you me as David can't do any of those works so it's him and me doing it right right why do you leave all the 2000 and go to one because I can't do anything until the father shows me my father worketh hitherto it means my father works at this moment he showed me what to do he's revealed it to me and I by confession a compassion go about to do what he Wills did the natural man misunderstood it yeah they did yeah he said have lift up he was God he was the god of Eternity Creator he should have healed every one of them and he could have said all be well but he didn't do it he became a man and he was subject to the word that was in him and so were we the same Harmony because we have the same Revelation unveiled in you and I it is that substance in him he is that substance all right now she's got to be the word the this bride is the virgin-born word of God manifested Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'll read it again who is this virgin word bride who is this virgin-born bride she is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever take that on internet they want you to hear that because they'll say you're prejudice you are who do you think you are we'll put you in jail we may even kill you for it what are you going to do how many is going to stand when they want to put a gun that you said and denounce what you just said or we'll just shoot you you're you're a hindrance to society if it's a real Revelation you'll stand if it isn't you'll Bend if you're only pursuing that it's right it's not going to hold out you only have an intellectual conception you see what we ought to be praying for and Revelation cannot be overemphasized you ought to be asking for Revelation every day of your life who did he come to redeem his thoughts amen all right I'm going to get this cross to you it takes just a little bit more all right and Emma's attributes and those attributes were thoughts amen the whole thing is God becoming material amen like husband and wife bride material amen I just it's you don't have time see as he as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we'd hear his voice and hearing his voice become aware of our father calling us amen what is the evidence brother Branham goes back the evidence it's nothing else but the revealing of the word in you I can show it to you right here he says what the genuine evidence is it was a thought that became expressed is what come eternally from God Amen now it's those that can receive the word it's those that the revealed the word is revealed to what made the difference between Cain and Abel both religious both built the church both were trained in the worship God what made the difference revelation Abel had Revelation why because he was a different seed he was the seed of God he understood what God wanted yeah what the sacrifice meant he got the Revelation that it was not fruit it was bloodlife amen all right well all right okay in the message bride material you see the bride is the words hidden in the book I didn't get to that but the word hidden in the book amen had to be unveiled she was the word in the book page two he says the only thing was he was eternal amen look to show you to show look to show it's the ones that he thought of his thoughts is the Christian of today the thoughts before the foundation of the world he came as a redeemer to redeem anything bring it back bring it back it was God's thought of you little you little me no one else a word world can take my place nobody can take yours you're being a Christian filled with the spirit before the foundation of the world he's seen you and note every feature that you got and Jesus come to bring you back the Redeemer the human body is was sent to bring you back amen the life that you knew never did begin and God for if you've got eternal life he said and that's God for you as in the thought of from the Eternal and now it's expressed in a human being in your body for his glory we have this we have this treasure in Earthen vessels okay and we were his thoughts of God then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice and hearing his voice become aware of our father calling us and recognizing we are the sons of God that ability to hear that word is the evidence that your bride that you is living in you all right and I'm not talking about I'm talking about you growing again you're coming into the head that's second Peter two if you want to just read it amen now you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it he will show you things to come he will reveal you to these things that is to come and there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost amen the spirit would re he said the evidence of the spirit with those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues it's receiving the word amen he will reveal these things to you that I've taught you and will show you things to come he said so there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost amen she's got to be born of the same material the word made flesh because she is the female Tree of Life hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree amen all right so none will be picked up but them which was in his thoughts at the beginning that's what he come to redeem not the cannon fodder we see around professing to be Christians but that he came to redeem that which was in God's thinking at the beginning that's what he come to redeem amen do you love him stand with me God bless you there's a lot more I could go with here a lot more but I think we're catching the message I do want to leave two scriptures with you before we close Ephesians chapter 5 I wish you'd turn that with me Ephesians chapter 5 and we'll start with verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church watch and gave himself for it so that he might sanctify and cleanse it what's he speaking of here he's speaking typing he's typing what he's talking about and Paul says I'm showing you a mystery I'm showing you the Bride In Christ but I'm going to show you also that the husband and wife in the natural are typing or a shadow of this relationship okay but what I want you to keep the spiritual in mind here he said so he gave himself for it that he might sanctify it how does he do it with the washing of the Water by his word all right that he might present it to himself watch this he might present it to who himself as a glory as a glorious church not having any spot or wrinkle or any such thing how can there be spot or Wrinkle In the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you or any such thing but what is happening it's the revealing of this you're coming closer and closer and closer in Union in Union until it's no different you and he are one you've entered to that headstone you recognize your position as the revealing of himself The Headstone The Headstone had to come in Bride form all right all right the full manifestation of himself had to come into bride form and what are we looking for the change of our body what's it going to take this adoption but we've already received the spirit of adoption so he said here then can't you have confidence in and what God Made You To Me just keep feeding on the open book will it not take you to what he said are you really interested are you just playing Church are we really interested are we just coming for a social time are we really interested in going home are you really interested in Christ are you really interested in being one with him are you really interested in that are you not only interested is it your hearts draw and purpose then God's given you a message to draw through and you can't draw anything through there but what is according and the will of God and according to his word you can't draw anything through that but it's the Holy Spirit so it all determines what's the drawing and the desire of the Soul amen all right so and he might present it to himself a glorious Church Without spot the blemish verse 28 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies so who so what who's what's your body owned by is it not his body yes now then he'll change it is that right it's his body do you not know you're his house what's your Dwelling Place not this oh yeah we're in here but Christ is my Dwelling Place this is his house he said he would make it a habitation by the cleansing power of the blood he himself would come in you and live his life through it is that right and bring it subject to the word as we've already spoke of this morning all right now so so ottman to love their wives or ought God to love his wife is his own body he that loveth his wife loveth himself and no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it how about God over you even as the Lord the church it's not up to you to keep the wolf Away by the way it's up to the shepherd not you I can't keep the wolf David can't keep that wolf away but David's Faith keeps the wolf away is that right which is Christ in me then can I rely upon what he made me as a genuine believer which is the faith of God can I not rely upon that substance that's revealed in me can it fail no can it pass away no have I been Justified yes I never did this in the first place I was married to him to begin with that old man is dead and it's eternally separated from me I'm not living by that old man anymore Hallelujah I'm living under the new ministry the new message the third poll the opening of the seals the revealing of the word the opening of the word I am the opening of the word the bride is the message of the hour she's Christ the mystery of Christ revealed listen for this cause shall a man leave and father mother shall be joined unto his wife no it's verse 30. I'm sorry for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones yes let me read that again for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones for this cause still a man lead father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife why because the wife is the flesh the bones The Same Spirit is that right all right all right but it was his this is mine his wife is mine we were joined up in eternity She's Mine God Is Mine He's My bridegroom I'm himself amen I'm himself what God had as a mystery is now put in the bride do you not remember the quote what he had is a thought as a mystery is now revealed and put in the heart of the Bride it's now in the heart of the Bride no longer hidden it's in the heart it's opened it's open People the seventh seal is open I say the bride bride the Seven Seals opened I don't care who disagrees with that I know it's open right amen what is the bride the manifestation of this hour what is the bride the manifestation of this hour she must be a word bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride it's God the bride is displaying the attributes of God in the formation in the formation what is the formation God in morphe he had more fade himself into a form it's still him in another actor's garment it must be the bride he must be manifested as the bride we don't have the completion or we're not facing Millennium then or Rapture amen are you with me all right all right so we are here he's here in the formation of the Bride this to be present in this hour that is to be expressed in this hour that we are now living the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he is now the Bible expresses its growing in the bride to the full stature and the Bible Prophet said it's the bride growing the word bride heading up in the person of the word made manifest in this evil age we're living see where it's heading up amen I could read more quotes on that about heading up about the head brother Brown said the message is The Headstone I got this right here the Capstone Ministry the Capstone Ministry do you believe the message is the Capstone Ministry not many said amen you wanted I'd like to just throw another hour because I it can't do it though a time's up look it laughs he said now you remember now he said the same word sucked up through these and come out here we've received as we partake of of the promises we become what II Peter these precious promises we become partakers of his self I'm just paraphrasing you can go back and read it all right then then he said the same word sucked up through these through these and come out and come through these stature the stature and come to a head here to come up through the ages remember the ages had to come to the Head yeah The Headstone Ministry so as an individual okay all right without us it can't be made perfect so here he said the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all that life that come through there picked up its people now it's forming up into a head now it's forming up into a head for the Rapture let me just say this we have a seven-fold feast amen is that right certainly we do the message of the hour Was A Feast for the bride remember the member of the guy man made A Feast for his for his bride bridegroom made a feast we put that as a wedding supper but notice it doesn't come until after the Rapture so there's a marriage Feast going on and I'm preaching it to you this morning the open book it's a marriage Feast but somebody tried to get in not wearing a garment right he tried to get into that Rapture he tried not the Rapture because he wouldn't be in the rapture did you catch it he wouldn't be in the rapture right he couldn't come with the wrong garment on and be in the rapture so there's a feast going on right now he tried to get in another way except through the door he wasn't ready to go into marriage so what are you doing here you didn't come through the door and he was put out and cast out into outer darkness which is tribulation that isn't after the Rapture that's now we want to put that as a as a wedding supper it's not the wedding supper yet we do have a wedding supper you can say that but it's happening now not the one over there there's a marriage Feast going on we're feasting on it right now the union the invisible Union between the bride and the groom you can't put that man over there Beyond The Rapture he can't come in that rapture he would have to come to the resurrection be changed to be in the rapture so it's trying to get in now not ready to go into marriage he comes in the wrong way didn't come through the door no oil no revelation tried to get in some other way don't you try to get in some other way a lot of belong to the church I belong to the church no you don't belong to the church there's only one the church and that's the burn again born from above Born Again people individually are born in the church that the church is Christ this day there's to come oh God help us I'm just going to have to stop amen it's forming up into a head amen it's just I'm taking this out of other messages that's why I have so much turning but it's just it's just brother sister I hope you see it that's all I can say if I'm to take another portion I will I don't know but what it might be my last time to preach but you've heard the message God reveal it to every one of us I say I raise my hands do I want more of him absolutely I need more of him and he's been gracious and he's been merciful every day every morning I see new mercies I said Lord keep unveiling yourself the more I see it the more I desire I want to leave Lord I got to leave I want to leave and but I can't leave till that last one's come in the door can't shut until the last ones come in but what if it is brother Brandon thought it was preached souls in prison said it's going to happen I don't know if it is or not but it's going to we ought to not take this haphazardly and just lightly this message ought to be the Capstone of your life it ought to be absolutely your drive every day you ought to catch the importance and the and the and the the depth the the desperation of the hour don't leave me Lord don't leave me what if right now this day we meet our loved ones the resurrection takes place [Music] where are you standing this morning you may never come back to this church where are you standing this morning what is your

believers [Music] all that he was I am and all that I am he was amen being dead in him we are identified with him what he is I am amen you said we would receive this today and there's a people on this Earth right now that are your Witnesses with this testimony but this message as their testimony they've come through the blood and their testimony they've overcome by the word of faith which is their testimony Lord Jesus I commit this audience of people to you I commit him into your hands for Lord here we are the original life The Original Seed the original word I submit every one of them if

Glory and Honor we don't know it I'm not saying I know it Lord but it shakes me to think your Prophet said the door was beginning to close before he left the scene [Music] and he says hurry hurry hurry bride hurry get in Lord I ask you to do this and for your honor and Glory I commit this people this church which I love every individual here if I had anything in my heart against the Lord I'd be at the altar but I love them with all my heart I only desire one thing that they would see you face to face now and will oh God may you grant it let them see you in them unveiled in them as the

what is it fulfilling it he is he's doing it all doesn't have anything to do with David David's just an instrument he David is a is a somebody's work did not he say he would work in and through the bride and did not he say the bride would know that and did not he say she has thus saith the Lord the word of faith in her amen God's attributes were take this personally take it personally these
