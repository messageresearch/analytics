have the liberty to speak to our hearts we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen praise the lord man it's good to be in the house of god again tonight as it always is and why don't we if you have your bibles tonight let's turn into uh first peter chapter 2 verse 1. now i will admit this thought came to me during a service our pastor was preaching but aside from that and youth meeting as the youth will probably testify whether david and our pastor have been stepping all over me um so if we cross paths well you heard it twice or three times um it's just it's encouraging saints they see what what and god does it all the time but he's doing it again it's just everything just meshing in and uh keep giving my wife the elbow in church youth meeting or or hey look at my notes amen so we just trust god have his way tonight amen first peter chapter 2 verse 1 wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be you have tasted that the lord is gracious i love that the lord is gracious i love that phrase amen we have tasted of that you know i say all the time that a true son or daughter of god has a revelation of grace to have revelation of grace you have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious you know that applies to christ just as much as it applies to you you were disallowed of men but chosen of god and precious precious to god he also as lively stones are built as where i take my text tonight are built upon are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded thank the lord for clarity unto you and therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be a disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed or rejected the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient were unto also they were appointed but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time passed for not a people but are now the people of god which have not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy while you're standing one more scripture first corinthians 10 verse 1 through five first corinthians 10 verse one through five remember my wife tonight she her foot was acting up and since i'm preaching there's no one to carry the baby around so they had to stay home tonight but you just remember her and god would heal her foot just hurting extra bad today but it's just part of the process so uh first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 moreover moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and it all eat the same spiritual meat and it all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening so my my title tonight is two alters part one and uh i had to do it um it just you know sometimes well sometimes it just just explodes and uh i have already notes for number two i was in the back there and and um sometimes i just get so overwhelmed with what god is is inspiring that i can't hardly write it down so i just i just put what i can there to just bring to my remembrance and sometimes i have just a few pages of notes but the context is all there because that anointing was just so strong out in the office here i was just just meditating and putting notes down and that the the the anointing and the inspiration was was was so strong i almost just started bawling my eyes out right there um but i wanted to i wanted to um bring up this definition of the word disallowed um so sorry my my so my subtitle today is an altar built of lively and stones this this word disallow disallowed as the scripture says here in first peter i'll jump to it real quick um see the stone which the builders disallowed the definition of disallow is to refuse to declare valid refuse to declare valid if that isn't where we live today i don't know what it is it's not just it's not the word disagree it's not the word different opinion they it's a strong word refuse do it to decree it valid refuse you don't when someone says when someone disagrees with you nicely you don't say they refused but when somebody's in your face denying your opinion you say they're refusing or you telling somebody to do something and their your little three-year-old is refusing you don't say oh they just disagreed when they're worked up and animated about what they're saying they were refusing and so you know the saying goes you can try to lay it out for them but they refuse to accept it because it takes revelation so we're not going to go into that tonight but an altar built of lively stones and exodus chapter 20 verse 25 and i'll try to just hold myself back a little bit here so i don't get too fired up and talk too fast i'm pretty excited um but exodus 20 verse 25 and if thou wilt make an altar of stone thou shalt not build it up hewn stone for if thou left up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it so if if if the brother brand preaches the series israel and the church how many know israel types the church right so if if the an israelite goes to build an altar and they're going to build it of stone now of wood there was different rules but if they wanted to build it of stone it had to be natural stone collected from the earth they could not go and cut themselves some perfect cubes to stack very neatly like you see in the pictures and the drawings to make this beautiful ornate altar of stones they couldn't do that because if they took a a tool a hammer and a chisel to cut out you know wow i'm talking marble granite beautiful stones created by god denied by christ you they they couldn't take and cut this beautiful cube and make this pretty altar like cain did that everyone would look upon and say now i want to go to that church or i wish i was i was just as collected and you know i've been listening to the tape the statue of a perfect man and brother bam says oh help me recollect here lord uh he's talking about you know oh you need we need to we talking about people needing to to collect um not collect to become more better at speaking more eloquent use the word more better you can say brother chris needs some speech lessons he says it's not about that he's talking about the statue of a perfect man it's about building upon the faith of christ so um faith in christ we don't want to go into that sermon [Laughter] lord help me keep that the direction here but still be open to his will so they couldn't go and cut a stone with tools or they would pollute the altar because at that point that stone is now man-made and you say well what's so important but you see the old testament was the groundwork for the new testament uh everything was a type and an expression of what god had in mind and so he couldn't take just uh um a stone cut from a mountain it had to be a lively stone it had to be a stone taken naturally you know when the children of israel were in were in the land of egypt they were commanded to take hyssop to put the token the blood upon the door post hyssop is a common weed in other words you can find it wherever you look it grows everywhere right signifying that faith is simple it's a common thing guess what no matter where you are what you're doing there's stones around to build an altar no matter where you are in life no matter what situation you're in amen jacob and many times in his life was at different points of his journey how many know jacob had a lot to overcome amen but he met an angel one night and then that the lord changed his name but many times he's he's went to this place and then he built an altar or he went to this place and he built an altar and called it el bethel the house of god and he went to this place and he built an altar what it was jacob was seeking and looking for amen that same place his grandfather abraham was walking seeking that he had a desire what was it that my grandfather had that connection that he had to god jacob was building an altar and so um praise the lord so it could not be built of hewn stone and then it would be man made brother venom says in watchmen what of the night 1960 uh it's dead been dead a long time ago having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof why don't you build your hopes on things eternal they will never pass away build it on christ the solid rock i stand all the ground is sinking sand build upon the lively stone not something that's dead and been dismissed from god years ago build your hope in something now where god's a living now two altars remember that's that's our title two altars an altar built of lively stone you could say you could you could jump off of that an altar built of loudly stones what house will you build me saith the lord amen and convince and then concerned 1962 they just have these two quotes here tonight uh not give him a handshake and put his name on a book talking about a convert he's got to be born again by the spirit of god he's got to have the power of christ in his life that changes him from a dead man to a living creature a lively stone raised up and joint heirs with christ in the kingdom sitting in heavenly places you've got to be convinced first a living creature a lively stone no longer a dead stone no longer a dead man but a lively creature in christ an altar amen an altar built of lively stones and so your life amen built upon a revelation of christ amen is an altar built of lively stones and then there's no more dead stones those were tossed out they were too modified by man's tools oh you can take a man they've done it you can go and look at the videos this homeless guy gets a shave and a haircut and a bath and a new set of clothes nothing don't take this the wrong way i hope you guys know what i'm saying he looks like you know someone that just walked out of a stock exchange in wall street right but you give them some time and he's right back to the mess he was in so you can take that alter and you can just purify that thing right up you can get a little mortar and you can brush it in the side there you can make it even you can cut some stones to fill in the gaps you can make it look good which is what kane did but you see there's a big difference and we're going to get into that right here first kings chapter 18 there's a big difference between these two altars there's quite a bit of scriptures here tonight bear with me first kings chapter 18. now this this is the story of elijah on mount carmel rather than read the whole thing i'm just gonna start the story so they for the israel has forsaken the commandments of the lord they've they're following baal and jezebel's religion and god speaks to elijah and he says go talk to ahab so elijah goes to ahab and says we're going to have a showdown on mark carmel you bring the prophets of baal and all the people and i will come so they all gather on mount carmel and um elijah says okay here's the deal the god who answers by fire he is god now israel was good at keeping their history israel knew who their father father father father father father's father was they knew where they came from they knew the boundaries of their tribes and their lands and knew the history of the tribes and why this tribe was on the other side of jordan and what this altar was that they built over there in the altar of 12 stones that joshua built they knew their history i have no doubt when elijah said the god who answers by fire he is god everybody there knew what would happen yes i bet you the same maybe even the prophets of baal if they were israel i don't know you know they knew what was going to happen you see something within their hearts begin to stir up you see i keep trying to get ahead of myself you see they they god has a timing god couldn't have come along four days before this and done a mount carmel showdown the people weren't ready things weren't set in order remember that story brother talks about the hat how to be on the hook god is a god of order so things had to be in place the people's hearts were conditioned to receive the message that elijah had for them on mount carmel so we can start here in verse 25 and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying oh baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made now let me tell you something this wasn't a religion of a neighboring people this was israel's religion this was in the message this was a division in their ranks this was in the church this religion of baal so um the prophets of baal begin to do their things and elijah kind of starts to mock them and says maybe he's sleeping maybe you need to wake him maybe he's on a long journey having a little fun with him no doubt elijah was probably sick and tired of dealing with the drama brought about by these prophets of baal and um so he says you know go and look for them you know or maybe they're pursuing a journey and they don't hear you and they're they're nowhere to be found you see they had an altar they had a wood they had a sacrifice they the the the bible here says they prophesied uh let's just keep reading and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them aren't you glad we don't serve a god that demands that kind of stuff you know in this in this scripture here this is a outward physical mutilation but what happens when you follow something contrary to god's word it's a spiritual mutilation and it cuts away at who you are spiritually and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice you see the offering of the evening sacrifice they had their timing all off they looked like the right thing if you could say that but their timing was off they had the wrong day they had the wrong time but they in the evening time but there was neither a voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near to him and i love this part of the scripture i don't know if i caught it before or not but it really spoke to me tonight and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down he didn't build a new altar the altar was already there he repaired the altar that was broken down the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name you see jacob was you read about abraham you're about isaac but jacob was the first one you read about a man was a deceiver a man who needed christ a man you see his torment you know he he he was deceived with with his wives so he turned around and he put the things in the water and stole all the good sheep and all of the good cattle then he ran off and he was running from his brother sending the women and the children out first and before himself a man who was an unconverted an unconverted man portraying just the opposite of what you would expect from a godly man you see this this one of the first men in the bible you read about this torment a man fighting against his flesh is his the name he was born with you were born with a with a name if you will but one day god came along and said no this is your name this is your name israel so jacob but then jacob here now in the scripture is the one that god began to bring forth amen israel he changed his name to israel now the children of israel coming forth an expression of what god's desire to bring that seed down through which we'll get to tonight the lord be be willing so and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as what contained two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bull lock in pieces and laid him on the wood and he said fill four barrels with water and pour on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it a third time and they did it the third time and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water good luck starting that fire with the flint and steel this is what they had you can't even do it guess what you can't bring the fire you can't start your own fire god has to bring the fire the prophets of baal tried they tried to bring the fire but they couldn't because their altar wasn't built of lively stones and he said do it a second time okay and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word you see we don't go beyond god's word amen we stand and we follow god's word amen whenever god calls you to do something you stand you go through and you do that according to his word god has an order hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and all consuming fire and when all the people saw they fell on their faces they said the lord he is god the lord he is god now here we have the the the two sides of the coin you have the altar for baal and you have the altar for god one built of lively stones one built of dead stones they both looked very similar so closing deceived could have deceived the very elect if it was possible right brother says there's always there's there's always two from a revival twins revival brings twins there's always two but you see one's trying to impersonate the other but there's one thing the other is always missing the fire of god amen the revelation of christ you see elijah had no doubts when he laid those 12 stones in that altar he had no doubts that when he called upon the lord fire would come down and consume his sacrifice because he built those that altar up based on faith that god would keep his word a revelation with every stone you see not only did he have revelation but he baked a sermon into the stacking of those stones reminding the children of israel of twelve stones now rather than read it i'll paraphrase i have the scripture here joshua 4 19 and the people came up out of jordan well that's the wrong scripture joshua has them gathered 12 stones to stack on the other side of the jordan river he says let this be a remembrance when your children come to their fathers and they're desiring to know what are these stones for this 12 stone stack he said it let it be a memorial to what god has done today what did god do make them walk across on dry land no he brought them into revelation he brought them into an understanding of who christ was a type of where we live today in the promised land he brought them into the promise so now elijah sets these 12 stones do you think those people didn't notice it was 12 stones for the 12 tribes of israel they probably began to be smitten in their hearts as they remembered those 12 stones that their their father and their grandfather and however long back it was were there and witnessed the laying of those stones as a memorial they probably remembered exactly where they were and they began to be smitten in their hearts as they realized we have turned our back on the altar of god the altar of lively stones that was laid there we have disallowed we disallowed the chief corner stone and then one day they're going to realize he received those wounds in the house with his friends but in this in this example here so he begins as he sets these stones and he laid these stones in faith based on his understanding did he pick the number 12 he got that from the word see the word gave him a revelation of how many stones he needed to add to his altar you see the lord's gonna show you and give you instruction and revelation of how to build your altar so that you can receive the all-consuming fire of christ amen an altar built of lively stones now joshua 419 and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho revelations 10 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we know that mighty angel was christ joshua was a type of christ jehovah's savior joshua's the type of christ and so he brings the the children of israel the church across the river jordan into the promised land into the revelation of what they had been longing for in egypt as they toiled for hundreds of years longing to go to back to that faith of their father that faith of of joseph excuse me and so joshua type of christ brings the church now across the river jordan on the 10th um tenth day of the first month revelations 10 1. just you can just whatever you want to do with that um but um joshua now now he comes across into the promised land you see god is all about foundations god is all about an anchor point you see we sing the song the anchor holds and we sing the uh you know um that other song oh i can't remember it but it's all about an anchor point in christ there's a scripture in matthew uh 16 18 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it an anchor point the revelation of who christ is so now joshua brings him into the promised land do you think god was just like oh they'll be fine now they're in the promised land absolutely not he knew they would need an anchor point he knew they would need a reminder of what happened that day and so um excuse me so joshua collects 12 stones and builds an altar an altar of lively stones and then he says here when the children shall come to their fathers malachi 4 6 and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so what's our anchor point we were brought back to the faith of our apostolic fathers our pentecostal fathers of acts of the book of acts we're not founded on the fathers we're not founded on peter we're founded upon that revelation that he had to build his altar his altar of lively stones peter even preaches the message lively stones talking about how you are a lively stone you see it's the revelation of the fathers to cross jordan that revelation that came you see they had their fathers denied that revelation and they were overthrown in the wilderness they denied that they refused they refused to accept that amen so these this that generation was being raised up underneath a ministry of doubt under a ministry of you can't do it but they see that's what that's the thing about revelation it defies all odds you say oh that person there's no way they're going to be successful there's no way or somebody knew you when you were just i mean you know a biker with a braid they said that guy's gonna go to jail and they see you ten years later four weeks later that's what god can do and you look like a person cleaned up because revelation defies all odds revelation is the only thing that's going to get us out of here if your altar is built of dead stones their revelation is lacking but an altar built of lively stones is built by revelation and it's that revelation that joshua was anointed of the lord to lay those stones to remind them not that they just crossed over jordan but remind them of the revelation that their fathers had to cross jordan let me tell you something it takes revelation to step into muddy overflowing jordan river ever seen them flash floods a flash flood the water racing through that's probably about what the river jordan was that day it takes faith to step forward you see the water didn't part until they stepped in until they stepped in then it parted and they went across on a muddy riverbed dry land they went across on dry land you see it was a revelation to cross into the promise you can't make this up you can't make you can you can't fake it you can't fake it you know in the world today especially in the software industry well really anywhere but that's where i work so i experienced this so much you can fake it till you make it you tell somebody oh yeah i know how to write in that language and then you go and you watch everything you can and read everything you can and then the next morning you know how to write that language not recommended but it works but you can't fake it with revelation because guess what there's no fire the prophets of baal they were faking it and it almost deceived the elect but you can't fake because the stones have to be laid by revelation that is how you build an altar of lively stones and as you know the same revelation came to us turning us back to our fathers the heart of the children to the fathers when the children shall come to their fathers and then we went back to where it all started what was going to turn israel around at this showdown a fancy show the beautiful altar that the bell prophets the prophets of baal built the rugged inspiring altar that elijah built the fire of god is what turned them around but you see the groundwork was laid by elijah but you can have an altar you can have it built right but you still have to have the fire of god you still have to have it they were standing at the river jordan ready to cross but they needed the fire of god they needed a revelation of god to cross that you see elijah built the altar it was there it was set up it looked like it was the real thing but when did the fire come when elijah asked for it amen you want victory in your life you gotta ask for it you want healing in your life you gotta ask for it you want somebody that you know delivered from alcohol you gotta ask for it you want somebody you know delivered from pornography you have to ask for it because god says whatever you ask in my name you shall receive he didn't say just build an altar he wanted to see an act of your faith you built an altar let me see you step into the river jordan abraham had to build an altar one day he had a son by the name of isaac a promised son who he waited over 70 years for god said go sacrifice your son isaac so abraham goes and he builds an altar and isaac says father where's the lamb abraham by faith he said son god will provide a lamb so then when when he spoke those words they get to the location he begins to build an altar he was building an altar of lively stones because he had faith that when god promised him a son and a nation the sand and the stars he knew god had to keep that promise and so when he began to lay those stones into the altar saints of god there was nothing dead about them they were alive and kicking and screaming as he laid them down one after the other tears probably rolling down his eyes not knowing exactly what would come fully committed to take his son's life fully committed you see god knows when you're not fully committed he knows because your altar will be missing a stone so the altar is missing a stone lord your son's not fully committed yet all right give him some time give him some more grace because one day he'll lay that stone you see the faith that abrahad abraham had in christ to provide a lamb is the same faith that christ has in you to lay that last stone amen you are his elect seed and you will not return to him void abraham builds the altar isaac lays down upon it bound abraham holds a knife over isaac fully commits and the angel stops him and provides a lamb it's that same faith you see you read about abraham later on in hebrews chapter 11 you don't read and abraham by doubt took haga and had ishmael you see you have a book your writing of your life but christ has a book he's writing about you and it looks a lot different you have your mistakes listed out bullet pointed there's a concordance for you to reference christ he's more of a freestyle he's just nice and just writes it in there one after the other it's ready by faith paul haylett started pastoring a church by faith where the david moved from ohio by faith the ashdowns left canada by faith they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony you see saints of god too often we look into our book of failures too often we read from our book of failures instead of reading from his book about you his expression of you your name is written over and over and over again amen when abraham tried to sacrifice isaac and there was a ram there your name was in there when joseph stood in the prison wondering what was happening to him your name was in there when jesus walked the shores of galilee and called the disciples your name was in there when it said by his stripes you are healed your name was in there and god began to stack the stones you see it's not all up to you it's not all up to you that's the paradox of the christian life god says here son here's a stone try this one he doesn't leave you by himself by yourself god gave no praise god god gave abraham the faith he needed to build the altar to fully surrender and whenever there is full surrender there's victory there is victory abraham fully surrendered to god the knife was coming down and god gave him victory god gave him victory and an altar built of lively stones you see it's the revelation of christ it's the revelation of christ the prophets of baal were anointed but there was no revelation there was no fire they had an altar they had a bullock they even had wood they prophesied but there but they had no fire cain and abel had an altar but there was no fire on cain's altar and when cain was given the opportunity you see saints of god about the what thing about the word of god is it continues perfectly from genesis to revelations we just read in first peter that it's this he christ is the stone that was disallowed in the book of genesis god gives cain a chance and cain refuses he refuses the stone he refuses to go back and rebuild his altar god gave him a chance and he didn't just he refused it and he went there's no victory without christ the first thing gideon did after receiving revelation of who he is lower case h of who gideon himself was god had to come tell gideon you see that it's not up to you to build your it's not you're not left alone to build your altar god comes along and he says look forever you're a mighty man of valor he says no no i'm a barber he says no we can we you can let's just turn there if you don't mind judges 6 verse 24. here's gideon judges chapter six then gideon okay so the lord comes to him and gideon says look i think you're an angel but let me go make some food verse 19. oh no i'm sorry verse 17 and he said judges 6 17. and said unto them if now i found grace in my sight then show me a sign that thou talkest with me depart not hands i pray until i come unto thee and bring forth my present gift gideon went and prepared a gift and laid it on the rock yes i think it's matthew jesus says what what do you you fools you put more something about you put more into the gift than the altar but basically basically what he's saying is you you need both you need the gift and the altar they go together and and praise the lord okay we'll come we'll get to that so he lays his gift his present down and gideon says excuse me he made ready to stuff and the angel of god said take the flesh and the lemon cakes laid upon this rock verse 20 and pour out the broth and he did so then the angel the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there rose up fire out of the rock consume the flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight the fire came from the rock what is the rock it's the same rock that followed the children of israel and watered them it's the same rock that god that christ said upon this rock i will build my church you see everything you need comes from the rock water for sustaining life fire for victory amen it's all comes from the rock so here gideon's gift is consumed in a sacrifice and then gideon's afraid and the lord says don't be don't be scared peace be unto thee if you're not thou shall not die so then gideon builds an altar gideon caught a revelation of the rock and he built an altar gideon didn't build an altar first he wasn't happened to be building an altar when the angel came around no he built an altar after he caught a revelation right that everything he needs comes from the rock and he called it jehovah shalom our god is peace saying to god i don't know anywhere better you can find peace than in that rock which is christ i don't know where you can find more peace than when you have an altar built of lively stones you say oh it's it's hard for the chris to to build the altar it's hard to find them stones you know what if you just pick up stones guess what some of them stones aren't going to work you got to try this out that stone doesn't fit try this stump maybe you have to take a couple layers down and try this stone to make it fit because they're natural stones you can't cut them you can't take god's word we just heard about this you can't you can't shave part of the bedrock off to build your house you have to go with what's there you have to shape your altar around the natural stones you can't heal them with tools or it will be polluted it'll be in other words when you when you take and you take a stone that doesn't fit something in your life doesn't fit in the altar and you try to you so you take and you shave it off here and you shave it off there and you put it there what you're doing is you're trying to take god's design and shape it to meet your desires and all that does is compromises and pollutes the altar you see you don't make god fit you you make you fit god so gideon receives a revelation and he builds his altar now one thing that and i have read enough to to trigger my memory so then he goes and and the lord says look take a bullock that one in your father's pasture that's seven years old uh seven years old yes that one in your father's pasture take your father's bullock and destroy your father's idols you see prince of god the very thing the devil uses against you god gives you the power to turn around and use that against him that that sickness he held over you that god healed you from guess what that just added another layer to your back that has added more power to your punch you say okay devil oh now you're going to give me this well what about when god did this for me it just adds fuel to the fire praise god so he goes he takes this bullock and um he goes and in in the middle of the night so you see gideon had a revelation but there was still flesh thanks to god we have revelation we serve god but once in a while you're going to see the flesh now if the flesh prevails you need to pray for them but when you see the flesh of your brother apply some grace we're all in this together so he goes down in the middle of the night i want to know how he convinced all them servants that helped him to keep quiet but he did it somehow so he gets his servants you know sneaks in okay just move it a couple inches at a time they get the bull lock out and go over there strap it up okay travel to the idle all right go ahead crash and then he takes that bullock and the wood from the grove that's right and he builds an altar builds another altar uh i gotta pick it up because there's something there sorry gideon took ten men of his servants that as the lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and built and build excuse me and threw down the altar of baal that thy father hath cut down the grove that is by and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take a second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down see what did i say that very thing the devil was using to bind them now god took it around chopped it up and put it as fuel to his fire you see the devil is bound by god's ordained will [Music] that's why the devil couldn't bring fire down from heaven he was fuming as his prophets danced around the altars cutting themselves he was filming because he knew he couldn't bring fire down you see he can impersonate god's only so far only as much as god allows him praise the lord for that there's a hedge about the devil so then he builds this altar now now here's here's the thing with the altar of the lord reestablished bales had to come down there's only room for one altar there's only room for one altar and when gideon fully surrendered to god then came israel's victory you see god called gideon to that time like i said earlier he couldn't have come to gideon four days earlier to the wine to the press that he was hiding behind it wasn't the right time gideon god had been working on gideon for months or years preparing him for that moment you see you don't know when you see somebody struggling or you know somebody out in the world you don't know what god's doing or where you don't know when their time is coming that god finds them behind the wine press you do not know but god has everything ordained to time but you see when gideon fully surrendered you say how do you know gideon surrendered for one he destroyed his father's religion for two and god said knock your army down he did he said knock it down again he did gideon said i don't know but i'm going to war tomorrow he was fully surrendered but god still gave him that encouragement he needed down behind the tent see victory always follows surrender just like we heard about abraham when abraham fully surrendered isaac up that is when abraham found his victory see i just flipped it in my note i flipped it in my sermon not in my notes isaac was the promised son you see gideon caught a revelation that he was a promised son of israel gideon called revelation that whatever god asks me to do he can back me up and so gideon went out the same thing abraham and you see abraham isaac was given as a promised son this was the same son that sarah bore in her womb that types us receiving the seed of christ and bearing that life that promise the promised son which is christ you see abraham had a revelation that not a promised son but the promised son had to come he had a revelation that whether it be isaac or not in his seed shall be called or however that scripture goes from it from abraham's seed so it wasn't just oh god promised me this son this boy abraham had a deep revelation that god had a plan beyond their generation god had a plan to bring forth the promised son the word can't return void the seed was destined to come from isaac the promise didn't stop with isaac's birth it started amen a lineage was beginning so now you see here by faith you could say it by faith abraham preserved the seed you will allow me to take that liberty by underneath the anointing and the revelation of god abraham preserved that seed by sacrificing it testifying of christ when he would stretch his arms on the cross preserving the seed that's probably part three in case you were wondering so the lineage begins with isaac and next comes jacob now when jacob goes and he's fleeing from his past he's fleeing from his problems which is esau deceived esau stole the birthright fleeing from the mess he had made of his life you know what jacob didn't stop running until he met the angel he ran from esau in his home and then he ran from laban and then he was running again from esau until he fully surrendered that i will not let you go until you bless me but here comes jacob the next in the line what is god doing god's saying okay jacob you're the one you're the next one that seed has to come down through you i need to preserve that seed and you have to marry rachel rachel is who that seed is going to come through benjamin that's what i that was god's pre-ordained foreordained plan so now jacob goes to laban and you can go and find it in the scripture but he comes to the to the well and the stone is rolled over the well the stone is is rolled over the top he can't get to the water they had watered their sheep and they rolled it back and it's confusing for me personally but it sounds like the guys that were there weren't the stone back either and here comes rachel i don't know how heavy this stone was but here comes rachel with her flock rachel's jacob sees rachel and this something inside of him just explodes wow i love this girl when god saw you before the foundation of the world something exploded inside of him and he said this is my bride saints of god so what did christ do what did jacob do he says he rolled that stone away from the top of the well he rolled that stone away so that rachel could access life-giving water in order for that seed to continue to fruition the well needed to be open but the stone had to be rolled away saints of god the stone had to be rolled away so that christ could come amen and bring to us a well of living water however many years hundreds of years later jesus sits by one of jacob's wells john chapter 4 verse 7-15 if you want to write it down for reference he's sitting at the well his disciples have gone into town to collect some lunch there it is oh say to god the stone wasn't rolled over the well naturally the stone was rolled over this woman's well spiritually and she comes to the well the time of day when only women like her were allowed and he says can i have a drink john 4 7. i'm going to return there now jacob's well was there jesus therefore being weary with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour the man was weary there come with the woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink then say at the moment of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew asses drink of me which i'm a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god see there it is again saints the gift what is it that you put upon the altar the gift you put your gift upon the altar gideon put his gift upon the altar so he says if you knew the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me drink thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee living water jesus sitting there the rest of the world saw a harlot a woman of ill feign but something in jesus exploded because he saw his bride and he began to talk to her and he said the woman said unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water art are greater than our father jacob who gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children as his and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinks it of this water shall shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh all the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternal life and the woman says unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw jesus says in her go call my husband and come hither you see there was a connection there why didn't he pick the next harlot why didn't he show up the day before because the day before she was sick at home didn't make it to the well that day yes i made that up but it was that day that time and he said let me give you a drink and then you begin to open up to her her past yes and call her by name and she became a lively stone yes sir not hewn by man's design but a natural stone picked from the side of the road put to good use two altars amen jacob israel but when jacob caught a revelation that's when he became israel and that's when his altar was built of lively stones god had a seed to preserve in you so he musicians want to come tonight god had a seed in you to preserve man has tried to fix you man has tried to cut new stones for your altar you've tried to cut new stones for your altar but all it leaves behind is a an altar built of dead stones but we want to build be an altar built of lively stones because saints of god when an altar is built of lively stones then you ask through surrender the fire comes down and you have victory is it fire like mount carmel sometimes i find in the short time that i've been on this earth it's usually not because it's what what did elijah do he i think it was from there he went to the cave on mount horeb [Music] same mountain that elisha used but the verb says elisha had a spot out there to pray he went there on full moon and sunday i think it was or the new moon or something like that up there praying elijah hiding out scared [Music] thunder lightning fire wait god just came as a fire but this time it wasn't the fire it was a still small voice you see i i've been praying lord lately help me be more attentive to that still small voice sometimes we i i feel led to do things and and uh i oh that's probably just me and i by god's grace hopefully in the future when that happens we stop and we say well maybe that's you lord what if you're jesus what if you're that the next one at the well [Music] when that tattooed hippie comes walking up [Music] you know where where we are what we experience in our lives we we tend to take that and say everybody or all these people but it's just who you've been exposed to people have a tendency good people have a tendency good holy ghost people to just be like oh that homosexual [Music] they're no different in god's eyes than a liar because sin is sin since when since when did we start saying one sins worse than the other that's not from the bible sin is sin before god saved you guess what you were just as bad as that homosexual oh you were a man man you rode a bike but you were just as bad as him i don't know why i picked that example that's free i guess um but we are a chosen generation and we are a word of this generation and if your altar is built of lively stones the fire of god will be burning in that altar and when the fire is burning in your life you shed light to the world around you so if your fire's out check the wood if it's okay check your altar see are you building with lively stones or have along the way you cut a stone to fit amen because a cut stone to fit pollutes the whole thing that's right pollutes the whole you have an altar built of 12 stones you have 11 stones the right way but you have one stone that's been cut the whole thing's no good amen lord willing if we get an opportunity we'll continue this the two altars i just thought it would best because as you saw tonight there was just a lot of stuff but the lord has a plan and whatever whatever is his desire but saints of god let's check our altar let's make sure that our house you say you're talking about altars it's the same thing that our altars are burning and bringing forth a sweet incense before the lord amen us by our heads heavenly father lord jesus lord we ask that you would just take these words tonight lord father i know there was a lot there lord but i pray that we would just be able to chew on it lord and dwell on this is our altar built lively stones well we don't want dead stones mixed in there father from time to time see we have to maintain the altar lord otherwise it becomes broken down time to time and as we maintain it we try to cut a corner we try to do it easy although we know that has a cost and we try to fit a stone in there that doesn't belong father but lord help us to go back tonight in prayer in the morning in prayer day to day and check that altar and make sure it matches [Music] make sure it matches the one that you set forth thank you lord jesus we just pray that you build each one tonight lord we love you father god [Music] or sometimes as a man i i doubt myself but lord some very pointed things came out tonight that i didn't have lord if you were speaking directly to a heart i pray that would be received maybe it's down the line on somebody watching the archive maybe it's today here in the building maybe it's someone joining on the live stream i think i know the congregation but lord you truly know the congregation fathers your people that are here tonight those listening lord that those pointed things that were said lord i pray father if that was for your children they would receive that lord they would find their victory lord jesus in the rock thank you lord jesus we love you and appreciate you may your word not return void lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen praise

but he from the mountain cut of the mountain with by your hand lord father lord we have not disallowed that cornerstone because lord we are predestinated father to accept it lord father god we thank you lord jesus for opening our eyes to the truth lord thank you lord jesus for allowing us to come tonight lord to worship you father i hope to not hear chris speak as i have nothing to bring but my surrender to you lord father thank you for your word lord jesus speaking to my heart lord father help us lord jesus as your saints lord to build up our altars of lively stones lord that our life would
