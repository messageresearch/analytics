good to be able to come together once again we would certainly prefer to be here joined together you know just a bit of humor the scripture says that we are one body in Christ I thought maybe we could all just go ahead and have Church and when the authorities come we just tell them sorry there's only one here amen but you know we miss you and God bless you each and every one praying that the Lord just comes right down in your home where you're at today those that might listen to it and the days following may God just be with you this morning as I was finishing up my thought just a few little things sister Jerry was singing the song she just sang as a special and I thought how fitting that was and so I had asked her after the fact I said are you gonna sing a special today and she said yes and so I thought that was beautiful a lot of little things come together for me today you know I'll touch on it in a minute just how certain little elements come together and they encourage you and I pray today that the Holy Spirit just comes right down in your home all the elements that there are that make up the life of a son or daughter of God they're already in us right the prophet of God said that everything we need to make the rapture is already in us so I'm just praying today God just opens it up and reveals it to us let's it loose amen thank you brother Jason's sister Emmy brother Shawn sure appreciate their their contribution to the service it would not be the same without it amen I would like to speak to you today on the title focused we spoke to you last week on a distraction and we want to just balance that today on focused amen now let's just stand and turn in our Bibles to first Corinthians the fifteenth chapter you know it's just a lot of lovely thing things in the Word of God things that stir our hearts reminders you might say to us of how God is working for our benefit and that we as sons and daughters of God are living out the greatest privilege that has been given to man 1st Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed this always just stirs or bubbles something up within my heart amen for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God can we say amen to that we just give a Thanksgiving to the Lord but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know what your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen I want to read that last verse again therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast that's stable and pressing forward unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord Heavenly Father we ask Lord for your blessings upon this service today father just pray is we would proceed today father that you would just reach out into the homes of the believers of the Saints in father you would just stir hearts and Lord just remind us father Oh Lord it's not as though we have reached a place we don't need more of you but Lord as the scripture so clearly shows us sometimes we just need our minds stirred up father I pray that you would stir us today help us father to do and to live and to be all that you have called us to be in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated so as we look at this as I have said here this lovely scripture to me is very encouraging because as I read this scripture my brother and sister I take what brother Branham said that spoke to us encouraged us to do and and I I read myself into every portion of scripture and so as it's there well I say every portion now those that are gonna be bound and thrown in the pit I don't identify with them amen but here it is you know my beloved brother and he's talking to me stalking to you yeah you know be steadfast unmovable now we always want to be in a position that the Holy Spirit moves us but we understand what he is saying here that we wouldn't be moved around we wouldn't be shuffled as it were we're not pawns on a board amen so we always want to be abounding in the work of the Lord we don't want to you know Excel one day and fail the next but we want to just always be pressing forward so we know that our labor is not in vain to me that is very very encouraging amen what our Bibles are full of wonderful examples and you can just read passage after passage after passage and you will see the Bible is written in such a way to encourage the believer to to lift him up to correct him but my brother and sisters so many wonderful examples just as this scripture is to me the continuity of the word what they're doing it's always pointing us to our position in Jesus Christ so the believer my brother and sister can read the Bible by a supernatural I guess you would say anointing the believer reads the Bible recognizes those portions of Scripture and how they pertain to their life and in that when they recognize that they start to claim that as it were they start to pull these in and and it becomes part of them you know not everybody takes vitamins but you know as you would take a vitamin if you need vitamin C my brother and sister you will will have a craving your body will desire that and you know your body then benefits when you take that in remember this story the prophet of God speaks about the child that needed sulfur and come to the place that he's eating the petal off of a bicycle because there was something brother branham types is to the deep calling to the deep but there was something in that boy recognized that he needed something that was in that pedal of that bicycle and so here we are this morning as sons and daughters of God recognizing what there is in our life that we have need of you say well brother Paul I don't always know well my brother and sister you might say that it's kind of subliminal you know you'll start reading the word and it will just stir your heart up and you'll say amen to it and you'll find out later in some portion of your life then that was a portion you needed at that time and so he's always pointing us to our position in Christ and the unfailing promises of God I believe Saints today if we could just recognize and just get anchored in the fact that God has made unfailing promises to us it is not as though that it will work one day and doesn't work the next the only thing my brother and sister that might be a limiting factor would be our own acceptance of the promise to act upon it but we look at this and realize my brother and sister as we claim our position as we long for the deep is calling to the deep as we long for that God has made a promise that he would give to us and see what we need amen and so as we see that we start to become partakers of it and it changes our life and as I said already we spoke last week on being distracted and certainly distraction is a great tactic for the enemy it doesn't matter whether you're talking carnal warfare my brother and sister or you're talking in the spiritual element that if one can keep the enemy distracted my brother and sister you say well brother Paula I don't know how would I distract the devil pray amen there is the thing that changes the whole atmosphere the prophet of God tell us it changes everything my brother and sister so if the devil is trying to focus on something you might say well a flaw or however you'd like to describe it Satan's trying to focus on that in your life and you keep praying you stay under the blood you stay humble applying the word to your life you see what that does is distract Satan because he's got to find a way to get through the word to you and if you are constantly in the word under the blood then he then is the one who has the issue to struggle with amen so we don't want to give in to the Satan's into the enemy's tactics because oftentimes they will draw you out and that's been one of the greatest things in warfare of mankind would be to draw someone to push into a perceived place that they can conquer only to be encircled and so Satan were trying to draw sons and daughters of God out my brother and sister now look his whole goal his tactic is to get the bride of Jesus Christ caught up in the distractions of our age and there is a lot of distractions we're not going to reap reach that sermon but there's a lot of distractions that we get caught up in that are perfectly natural but we can get caught up too much you know the prophet of God says you can do almost anything too much you just can't pray too much amen so you know we're not like focusing on one particular thing but to realize it is a human tendency to get caught up in something and to really press into that and it can be a distraction to what a real purpose is now maybe I could give this to families with children maybe just to the Church in general it's almost you might say like a Sunday School lesson in a way but to go back to your Bible and go back to Goshen go back to the time that pharaoh finally relents and says that he's going to let Israel go and he's releasing them and then a great spirit of confidence come upon Israel and they went to their neighbors they went to those around them and demanded of them for oxen and carts and food and all of this and a spirit was on Egypt at that time and they readily gave of their pots and their pans and all of this to the Israelites now my brother and sister a conquering people giving to the conquered is unreasonable so you recognize it was a move of God that come upon them and so the people come out of Goshen and start to the promised land and they come out and started with a great zeal a great a great awakening and you might say and singing songs of praise and of worship and I like for you to go back into your Bible and look very carefully and count up the distractions that Israel faced on their journey from Egypt to Kadesh Barnea you will see over and over and over again things come up before them now my brother and sister maybe people would have a slightly different idea on this than I do I not trying to make a doctrine but my brother and sister I am a firm believer that if Israel had come to the Red Sea and had said well God said that nothing would stand before us and they had just walked right out into the Red Sea it would have opened before them at that very moment but because there already were weary now remember this is a journey that their oxen did not die it is a journey that their shoes did not wear out their clothes did not wear out but they did get tired and they did get hungry and they did get thirsty amen so it is not like they had a journey that was entirely free of distraction and circumstance but as they come just to to not be labored they come to the Red Sea here is the Egyptians behind them and here's the Red Sea before them and immediately you'll see some not all of Israel but some and as they raised their voices their voices were like the leaven in the bread and they raised their voice and said you've brought us out here to die we would that we were still back in Egypt and so this started or laid the groundwork of the distraction that every time their spiritual walk got difficult they started looking backwards instead of looking forward to the promise of God making a claim to the promise imagine Saints if we could come in our lives and walk right up to whatever our circumstance is and say you know God promised me a way through this and I'm standing on that promise I may not see the promise today I may not see it tomorrow but God said it and I believe it and we would simply walk forward right as the prophet of God so beautifully brought this out to us footsteps our possession and so as we would step into that we were actually telling God I believe your promise amen so as you see this may be a little homework for you parents for whoever would like to embrace it just go through and look at the distractions Amen I have a yearning to start touching on those but we won't for the sake of time amen the distractions you might say well it wore down these distractions wore down the people's faith they had all of these challenges that come they come to the place that they didn't even trust God's prophet they come to the place they questioned what the Prophet said in his motive for saying it because it seemed as though God treated Moses differently than he treated them but you see Moses was still doing his very best to stand upon the Word of God even though he got discouraged went up to the mountain spoke to God said look God these people that you give me to lead here who are they what are they and I really don't want anything to do with him but you look at what God was doing God was bringing it to the place that it was the people's faith that had to expressed it could not be their faith in the Prophet it could not be their faith in the great men that led them but it had to be their personal faith in Jehovah that kept them going or pressing forward and so as you see it started to wear down the people's faith and it brought them to a place at Kadish Barnea this is kind of where I kind of cut this off because you see here kadish marnya was one of the greatest distractions there ever was and that was here are the 12 spies 12 ministers they're pressing into the land and in the land that they are seeing everything that was promised to them the land was flowing with milk and honey the land was there but the land also possessed Giants in it and so it all depended upon what that minister looked at as what kind of report he brought back to the people so if the minister spent his time looking at the Giants and the vastness of the land and deciding this land was too great to be conquered by mere mortals then that was the testimony that when he come back from going into the land and come before the people at Kadesh Barnea the minister my brother and sister I hope you catch this the minister was preaching his own conviction he was preaching the message as he saw it now my brother and sister if one wants to say well I I don't see this I don't see that well that's good but if it's not God's Word for the hour the minister ought to just keep silent because the word is very clear when it declares what will happen and when it will happen God doesn't always clearly show us how it will happen other than it will be the manifesting of his word amen so I don't need to know how I will be an overcomer tomorrow all I've got to do is stand on the promise that God said I am an overcomer and I say I believe I'm an overcomer certainly my own family you know they would see my weaknesses they'll see my frustrations they'll see this but I hope they see also my faith in God's Word hey man I hope that that is not absent so you look at this my brother and sister we are seeing now how that they come to this place so weary so discouraged so influenced that they can't even say Amen to God's promise Joshua nailed you've heard this a million times but my brother and sister Joshua and Caleb they went over into the land they saw the same vastness of the land they saw the same Giants but we'll get to this you'll understand where I'm going I believe in just a few minutes but they were looking at this my brother and sister and there is a Giants there's the vastness of the land there is everything that was there but they viewed it through a different perspective they were looking through a different lens and that lens was not that they were super spiritual it's interesting in the day that we live in when one would have a victorious encounter when one would come to a place that the presence of God has so stirred them up and that they are just encouraged or trying to encourage the people to take a hold to the promise and press into it and people will then come back and say oh they sure think their spiritual my brother and sister know they have simply come to a place that they are looking at the promise of God through a different perspective they are not looking at it through their own carnal element they are looking at it through the word because the word is the thing that has become preeminent in their life and without that in their life they would be just like those other 10 ministers that are all bringing a reason we have it today people saying well you know there's things we don't understand about the message God's got to bring the profit back my brother and sister the Prophet said everything we need hallelujah we don't need another prophet to come the word has been revealed the prophet of God said that Jesus Christ is our prophet look it up amen so the Prophet is still with us the one that we have been looking to the one that we adore we praise we owe our life to is still right here with us hallelujah we don't need to have God's messenger to the aged come back because we have amen the great prophet message Jesus Christ now you look at this and realize my brother and sister when people come to the place that they cannot even say amen to the Word of God you know they say well men has failed us this is that that is that the pastor said something I didn't understand and I'm weary of him now well look at this my brother and sister Moses with just a mouthpiece and God said when Moses speaks to you it is the same as me speaking to you and so we have to come down you'll judge one way or another whether you want to believe God's mouthpiece whether you want to believe a fivefold ministry whether you whatever it's up to you my brother and sister but you'll find if you don't look beyond those things you will then constantly find yourself looking at the perceived circumstance you will look at what you think what the problem is and you will not be looking for God's solution amen now if God promised to put you and I in a rapture God promised to take you and I to the other side amen to reward us with this glorious time in his presence of eternity my brother and sister and if you cannot see that God has got a solution to get you there then you have missed something amen just reading report where brother Branham says so many people don't really have a true revelation of the Godhead because if they did they would look at these things entirely different my brother and sister I don't know how it's going to happen I look at this old flesh right here and I trying to put it to the scripture that I just read to you and sometimes I have a hard time reconciling that but one thing that you might find is a kind of odd to you I don't know maybe you're in the same position but something that I find that I just simply have to say Lord your words said it and I believe I'm a son of God and so I don't know how this is going to come to pass but it will and I'm going to stand here until it comes to pass it will come to pass and I declare this morning it will be come to pass in me hallelujah if you'll take that you'll come to pass in you too amen so we want to not look at our circumstance we want to look for God's provided solution now look my sister these people who come down and walked in the wilderness for forty years they died imagine the young people how it must have been so hard for them because they now are watching all of their relatives including maybe their parents and they're walking through the wilderness for this forty years and um they're dying right and left they're starting to question where was the promise of the promised land but you see God did not take the promise of the promised land from them they rejected or refuse to accept the promise remember what brother Brown said about a pardon I meant in the civil war a partner is not a pardon until it's accepted amen until it's received as a pardon a promise of God is not a promise of God to you until you reach out and accept it until you lay claim to it otherwise God spoke but it must not have been to you amen so look Saints I believe we are sons and daughters of God I believe we are the Bride of Christ don't let your circumstance amen keep you from accepting God's promise for your life amen now look when you think about it we think about things that are stolen we think about things that are that are pulled away from us things that don't seem to come the way we thought they were you see the promise of God was stolen from them big of group it is they're all coming together saying yep yep we're in unity we stand together on this that yep the land is there the grapes are there the weed is there everything is there but the Giants are there also and that becomes their ministry now become their ministry we can have a good life here we can worship in church expect the Holy Ghost to change your life don't expect to be filled up and be turned into a different person don't expect that old nature well we're I were through this or we're then don't expect that to go away we're just here to take know my brother and sister there's a word that come that said there's a land there's a promise there's a river and it's yours if you will stand up and pursue it oh but I'm gonna sit here until God does something well you'll just sit there a long time amen be the Rip Van Winkle Rip Van Winkle yeah Rip Van Winkle of church because you'll sit there a long long time and God won't do anything and you'll get up and walk away one day and say sure enough I set in grace Tabernacle for years and nothing happened there well I'm sorry you might look over there at that one that you looked down at and thought well they just act so spiritual you're gonna look over at them and you're gonna think well they're still acting so spiritual but what they're doing is having a jubilee because the promises of God are coming to pass in their life Oh hallelujah I know some of this kind of hurts but you know Saints sometimes maybe this is good there's only a little handful of faces looking back at me and so I don't have to deal with the frowns and whatever and the people going to sleep so I don't know maybe this is the new way to have church Alleluia some of you might be at home right now if your bunny slippers on comfortable when we wouldn't know if you went to sleep or not I hope not I hope not oh and those of you that didn't like that please get a sense of humor now look here what was stolen from them my brother and sister was actually a promise but it literally was at the tip of their tongue it wasn't at the tip of the profit it wasn't at the tip of the great men and the message it was at the tip of their tongue all they had to do was agree and acknowledge what Joshua and Caleb said they just needed to focus not on Joshua not on Caleb they needed to focus this is a promise from God there's where they got off their focus they started looking at Moses and all of the men and they started looking at what if it would have been my brother and sister of those people standing there that day would have been so focused upon God's Word God's promised to them so focused on that that when the first of those ten spies got up and said the lands flowing with milk and honey it's everything he said it would be but somebody would have said that's not in the word oh my it might have been contagious you know sometimes have they're so worried about how contagious this iris is my brother and sister I think sometimes we need something a little contagious maybe we need somebody that have a little Jubilee in church and stand up and just have the gumption to say praise the Lord and the bride oh that's how to order well I don't know if it is or not hallelujah depending on your reaction some of you they didn't like what they did would be the ones actually out of order because you'd be over there if it was up to me I'd throw them out in the parking lot right now come on my brother and sister we got to look at what God promised not this circumstance of all this somebody needed on their debt that day it Kadish Barnea somebody needed to have the courage to stand up and say you know what they didn't put a butt in that promise that God gave to Moses and Moses brought to us they didn't put any butts in there so we don't have to look at what it is that is holding us back amen so you look here now I love this my brother and sister once again I want to reiterate this what was stolen from them wasn't stolen from them from their fingertips it was stolen from them from the tip of their tongue because all they had to do is speak out the word to accept this now I love this I my brother Sergei sent this to me this morning and it was encouraging to me and the message I know Amen if we look at this and just see this read this here with me and why does God let troubles come God harness is trouble see that's not most of our point of view most of us trouble takes control of us trouble controls our emotion trouble controls our reaction trouble controls our thoughts but look what brother Branham says here and why does God let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey Him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God amen so it's all depends our focus my brother and sister on how we view trouble we can get up and say Oh trouble I've got trouble on the ride I've got trouble on the Left there's trouble in the land there's trouble here there's trouble in my workplace there's trouble trouble trouble well how about you sit back and let God put a bit in that troubles mouth and then have it come to affect you that instead of sitting there in your house paralyzed not praying not praising not lifting hands to the Lord Amen my brother and sister how about you let God put the bit in the mouth of that and you sit back and say praise the Lord something good is going to come from this I remember many years ago a brother lost his job and people were concerned because the brother had a you know fairly well paying job and the company sold out and they didn't need those departments because they were redundant to the new company and and people said you know what are you gonna do brother this seems like this is just a disaster for you and the brother had caught a revelation my brother and sister now whether he saw it as being a bit put it in the mouth of this trouble but he said well praise the Lord if God I let this job be taken from me he's got a better job for me waiting amen and it was only a couple weeks later the brother had a job and it was much more you might say friendly to to his activities of life and and paid better money and you know he testified of that not that he could come and gloat and say well this is what it is but that's what he believed he believed if God let this come that God had something better for him oh my oh my I'll tell you what I say this applies to the believer you know I remember years ago my brother and sister brothers in Chile sharing with me how that the circumstances a great earthquakes going back into the 60s and stuff and brothers shared to me how when they had that probably you know one of the rates I think is one of the worst earthquakes on the earth there and it just killed tens of thousands of people in Chile tsunami swept into the city buildings collapse people it was just a horrible time and brothers shared with me how that the churches filled up full of people people in the plaza which is kind of like the city center part and people in the plaza crying out to God for mercy crying out to God that he would come on their behalf and and so as they cried out but over time another disaster hits Chile and people cry out they go to church they cry out to the Lord but it's than before another disaster people cry out less than before until the last earthquake which was here in my years fly 2010 I guess sister Jerry and I just just a few short days before that earthquake then had got on a plane walked through the very airport that the ceilings collapsed in and different things and and so is really close to home to us I don't remember if that was a time that we were even sleeping in saint's home and earthquake put pressure on the house enough that the doors started unlatching and flying open and slamming against the walls but my brother and sister in 2010 they walked into the streets but they walked into the streets to curse God you see the shift that is taking place so much trouble so much struggle so much so much so much and the people's faith in God declined to where now it's almost non-existent in fact just to throw this in we see how the prophet of God said that they would come a time they would be a place that you would not even be allowed to preach the gospel without a permit and we saw that happen also in Chile where brothers have been there in the plaza with their little speaker and their little mic and they're sharing the message and they come along and tell them you don't have a permit you can't do this and the brothers point out and say but they're doing it they're doing it they're doing it and they would tell them they have a permit and he said where do we go to get a permit and the man looked him in the face I believe this was assistant mayor he looked them in the face and says we'll never grant you a permit you see so that persecution coming where every voice can be heard but the voice of truth oh my my brother and sister people don't like the voice we talk around the message we talk about the voice we talk about the voice but we're going to talk about the voice right here in a met in a minute my brother and sister and oftentimes people don't really like the voice now brother Branham preaches or speaks right here and Christ identified the same in all generations I think the title right there says a lot you see Laodicea we can't have a whole different approach to God it's got to find continuity to the god of the first church age all the way to our age now brother Brown says right here now the biggest robbery that ever had in the world was them seven million dollar robbery just done in England it was done by false lights they put lights out there and slowed that train down and even Scotland Yard's couldn't find it they ultimately did find out who robbed it but anyway it was a greatest robbery ever had in world's history was done by a false light it's quite an interesting story maybe another homework deal for our our homeschooled I guess every kid is home-schooled right now anyway for another thing go study that it's it's a very interesting story how that they figured out they didn't need to blow up the train trestle they didn't need to block it with some large object all they needed to do was to put a light out there and that light indicated that train should stop amen so that red light on the track that the engineers would say well now what would this be we don't know anything about this but they're going to obey the red light because in history is showed when trains tried to occupy the same time and space it never has worked so they learned to stop on the red light so it's instinctively engrained into the engineer of the train when he sees a red light he stops they stopped the train they robbed it but here look at this paragraph 122 and the greatest robbery that the Church of Jesus Christ ever had is a false light a glare of some other age when God is trying to inject or project to the people the light of the hour amen so we can't get caught up it's nice I love my brother and sister quotes her Spurgeon and tozer and many of those men of old beautiful quotes but we have message people lifting those up trying to apply Spurgeon's message that age that time that anointing as though it was pertinent in a complete and tire form to our day my brother and sister that's good read them study them but don't let them replace the light for your day don't let this change light of the hour because if we start to focus too much we can go back and my brother and sister and start looking through the dark ages we can start looking through all those times we can look in the Philadelphian age that you might say the greatest enlightenment of knowledge in man's history and you look at all of those it's all well and good and we take that as a portion to help build the platform by which we would live and stand and believe but the light of this hour is the light that is important the light of this hour because we can all go back I've got friends I've got family that think if they go back and they wear you know the clothes that the Israel was was commanded to wear and they eat what Israel was commanded to eat that somehow these promises would apply to them their Gentiles they've totally missed it they're not looking at the light of the hour they're looking backwards somewhere my brother and sister so as you look at this we realize that the light of the hour is what Satan is going to distract us from because if he can keep us from looking to the light of this hour this moment and keep us looking back now you say brother Paul what are you trying to imply I'm not trying to imply anything but I do know that the prophet of God said there was a become a time at the end of the Laodicean age that would be the bride age now he didn't place it as it would be a church age but it would be a time that the Word of God would enlighten the bride that she would be able to come in to faith we say well where's rapturing faith well God's pouring it into it wait it's already there he's pouring into you the anointing that releases the power that was already placed in you before the foundation of the world and in that you are starting to see things in the word that you never saw before you're starting to embrace a life that is you might say oh I don't even know how to put it be honest with you I want to use the word stricter but you see when you in force it on yourself it has to be your own free will it has to be something inside of you you know there's a doctor here in town very nice gentleman he told sister Jerry nine one time that the solution to a lot of our problems health-wise is uh it's what we eat and I have to agree with the Cheetos and Pepsi does not constitute a balanced diet but you know I asked him I says what do you eat for breakfast sir he said well I take a stone cut oats and I put him in a bowl and I pour he used various kinds of juices and stuff before and I pour it on them and I leave it sit in there overnight and then I eat it in the morning and I thought you know being unhealthy isn't all that bad my brother and sister but you see what it was I asked of us is how can you eat that and he said well it took me time to get used to it now I'm used to it you see my brother and sister maybe a poor analogy forgive me but you see this bride of Jesus Christ is not being forced to live the life she has changed she is not herself any longer she is becoming Christ in flesh some people struggle with that some people struggle with the idea God in flesh but don't pick a fight with me it's God's Word amen this is the mystery Christ in you the hope of glory going back to what the prophet of God said if we don't have a full revelation or a complete revelation of the Godhead we might question how can that be but my brother and sister it's God's Word God's prophets said it over and over again the scripture declares it all mine now look at this so we don't want to be faced today with the greatest robbery my brother and sister of the day that we live in because the word is here the word is available to us and we have been given every safeguard you say well how is this brother Paul that we have every safeguard well I'll touch on that in a service or two but my brother and sister all you got to do is go into the message take the search and type in searches like back to the scripture back to the word you know all of these kind of searches and you'll find that hundreds and hundreds of time's a prophet of God told us take it back to the Word of God now less that would be us misunderstood by some all I'm implying there's a prophet of God actually you say well we know brother branham's have indicated prophet why do we got to take it back to the word well good we're not proving brother branham's vindicated prophet maybe we're proving to you that you're vindicated believer and by taking it back to the word you start finding who you are and where you are in the Word of God you find your firm foundation that you don't have to take somebody else's word for it it's a problem we have too many young people too many children raised in the message without a personal experience they can sit there and say well the pastor says mom and dad says this minister says but it really comes down as Jesus was dealing them he says who do you say I am and it comes down to every single one of us has to be able to say that Jesus is the Christ and brother Branham shows us right in the Word of God he just amplifies or opens a word up my brother and sister we can't even say Jesus is the Christ without the Holy Ghost it's not even a correct interpretation or a correct manifestation if we're speaking at we can speak it with our words but to speak it from the heart you've got to have the Holy Ghost even to be able to speak to that oh my oh my now look letting off the pressure well let me back up a little bit you see in this greatest robbery my brother and sister the light of the hour which light which version there's dozens of versions I've been going to preach versions of the message for so long I I don't know I've wore it out just talking about it but my brother and sister is at version 1.0 1.3 1.7 you know how the computer thing is it goes right on man they have so many versions we have dozens of versions of the message and every one of them is saying you know what we we have it we're the ones got a right we were there see they're wrong we have this they don't have this we have this they have that and you know it was interesting brother jason de mars put it this way he said now you know he's reading and i'm take just snipping this out of what he was saying you know what it comes down to when you take what the Apostle Paul said the Apostle Paul said if you don't believe what I have preached to you you're you're lost you don't have it boy that's pretty strong I saying you got to come here and get it from us or from me the Apostle Paul spoke that strongly but you look at that that same anointing taking out my brother and sister dozens of versions of the message saying you've got to come to us to get it well I'm here to tell you my brother and sister you've got to come to the word to get it you don't got to come to a man or his movement to get it you've got to come back to the word and when you come back to the word God might lead you across the country to a certain ministry that would be there that would preach the word to satisfy your soul but you got to come to the word first because if you come to the man first and that man just has a version of the message then you will be following a version of the message but you know what in the midst of all of that amen could I sweep that under the rug in the midst of all of that there's a people that are not here to argue this message there's a people here to live it there's a people that are so focused on this word of God they're saying I am going to be the Bride of Christ I am the Bride of Christ I'm living the life this is who I am and they're not looking at all of this around they're not looking my brother and sister at manna and getting tired of the manna well we've got enough of the message oh my brother and sister that scares me when it comes from people's mouths we've got enough of the message I my brother and sister clearly identified this message as Jesus Christ and I could never say I've got enough of this message if you think this message is ink on a page of voice on a magnetic tape if you think this message is a religious following then you might come to the time that you can say I've got enough of this but when you recognize truly what this message is you cannot say I have enough of this message Oh hallelujah forgive me for being excited this morning hey man I'm not here to argue this message you take what you want to do brother Jordan Smith puts it this way you run your race and I'll run my race I'll meet you at the finish line hallelujah there it is not here to argue versions my brother and sister I'm here to run the race hey man I want to be one of those people that live it hallelujah now letting off the pressure brother Brown says here o Heavenly Father we're indeed a privileged people this morning in the face of this changing world wow this might be for us today Saints and we have a hold of the hand of the unchangeable God times may change but he is eternal and his word is in our heart it's an ultimate of our thoughts they always drift back to that word no matter where we stray it comes back to the word it's the typos in your heart we're so grateful for that you see my brother and sister what is he speaking of here when he's talking about the word now we have a great debate that is broke out over some time in the message of what is the absolute and and I understand what people are trying to say but not all people who say it say it in the same context and so it's there that if you're not careful of verbage can be put in that actually would take you or draw you pull your focus away now people would say now brother brother branham you know he preached the absolute my brother and sister some people are then saying well this message of the hour is our absolute well if you want to say it in the context that the message of the hour is Jesus Christ and Christ is the word then I'm with you but if you are believing that what brother Branham spoke with a man's voice and was put to a magnetic tape and ink to a page has become your absolute then you have missed that the prophet of God was pointing you beyond himself to Christ amen and so people say well well know how what my brother and sister it comes down simple you need to identify what you view the message at if you view the mess my brother and sister has a voice on magnetic tape and ink on a page and you say that your absolute I believe you missed it now you might want to argue with me I'm not gonna argue I'm not going to argue with you but this message is Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ spoke as it were the anointed word Amen because all of the Bible wasn't written by man was written by God and so when a man comes to that it depends on what your focus is and when your focus is on Jesus Christ let it be on Jesus Christ let every man every messenger every helper every gift everything that was in there fall underneath that focus upon Jesus Christ that's what the prophet of our day pointed us to okay so when we're coming here we're looking at this we're privileged people in this changing world we have the whole of the hand of the unchangeable God time may change but he's eternal and his words in a heart right so God doesn't change he's eternal so the word is eternal and doesn't change and it's in a heart it's the ultimate of our thoughts what the word amen they always drift back to that word now this doesn't mean that your thoughts drifted somewhere else out there and become caught up in the garbage of the world it's saying that when we go through life our day to day life our day to day doings in our things that we might be working along you'll be there laboring away and then something will come to you you remember a scripture you'll remember something and something the Prophet said and and you know your heart is rejoicing there and you come back it comes yard it's the ultimate of our thoughts and they always drift back to the word a real believers thoughts will always ultimately bring him right back to the word no matter where we stray it comes back to the word it's a time post in our heart we're so grateful for that now what I'm saying right there might offend some and I'm sorry that it would offend them but my brother and sister the Word of God the prophet of God you add them together it's going to be over 400 times using various words the prophet of God tells us to take it back to the Word of God take it back to the scripture I think I'm just going to go ahead make a public declaration that that's my absolute 400 times Plus have to admit I was gonna ride him down as I was searching through it and I didn't but you're gonna find a lot of times the prophet of God telling us take it back to the word take it back to the scripture take it back to the Bible why are we doing that we're not doing that Saints because we doubt the messenger of the hour we're doing that because every time now I don't want to offend anybody I may well already done that today but we'll work on that and I say I'm sorry and sincerity but did you know it'll do us a great benefit when the prophet of god is talking about things in the message we focus on what he said push pause whether you got your phone in your hand whether you got your hands on your Bible go look the scripture up well sunday-school brother Jason's sister Emmy and the kids a youth group what are we doing we're constantly working upon the children to be able to find things in our Bible but we're adults and we're exempt from that no I don't think so take it back to the word take it back to the word it's good for us like adult Sunday school if you want or will amen now look see I've got a lot here and will not even come close to making it through it here this morning brother Brahm says here in the message victory day we got to get ourselves focus to whether we live or die sink or drown it's Calvary Christ that's the thing that God wants us to come back to amen so there is our place that we focus now my brother and sister we got to get ourselves focused that we know it's Calvary it's Christ and that's the only thing that we are looking to hallelujah God sent a prophet for our day to correct the misnomers and misrepresentations and the confusion my brother and sister and that very prophet that was here to restore the word back in our day was also there declaring to us take it back to the word amen he didn't put a time line he didn't put a date on it he didn't say take it back until this circumstance he said take it back to the word amen now look here as we look into Victory Day hmm brother Ivan do we have another quote on Victory Day there one that would start off and what did we do at v-day we sang songs we screamed we throw our hats in the air that's all right don't worry about it brother Ivan I'll just I'll just preach my way through it real quick it's a Victory Day 1963 April 21st paragraph 116 if you want to start he's talking about how on v-day we sang songs we screamed we throw our hats in the air we shot guns in the air we cried we blowed whistles we beat drums we played music we beat one another on the back what was it it was a victory oh we had the victory how why we felt we won we have won flags went up and the trumpets sounded and all what a time we had victory victory victory we won and it was a great thing it brought peace to the Christian nations as so called and we had a little time of breathing and some of the boys as a living come back home and so forth and many but many great them days has been many of them and great wars but you know all along there had been that kind of battle fought there was also been God's believing people that had many great victory V days - oh yes there's been on both sides where the glass has focused and went to the natural side with V days also where it focused into the word in the scripture it brings another v-day sometimes now once you look at this my brother and sister is talking you know v-day was there was a deed a brother Brown talks about that there was a v-day and then there was when the war was over there was a v-day it was a victory that was broad a victory that was there and how it was founded and you know we look at Israel and we see how that Israel my brother and sister when there was victory in the camp in Israel there was always a shout that accompanied they didn't have victory and sat there silent they had a victory they screamed to the Lord they yelled praises you know sang to Hosanna and my brother and sister they were excited about that because there was a victory Amen so you know we look at this and realize how you know he's talking about now in the carnal here we've had many great battles against our enemy and God has had great men that are standing at the front who has been able to capture by the Spirit of God the thoughts of the people and throw it into the kingdom of God yonder and come out victorious now you take that quote and brother Ivan will have that it looks like in just a minute for us but you take that quote right there my brother and sister you see what we've had is we've had this glass this focus on the natural side and in the natural side we have victories we have things that happen in our lives we get a raises at work we get new jobs we buy a house car train a plane and we view those things as victories but we'll look at this my brother and sister it also focuses on the word in the scripture which brings another VD and other victory and so the same nature right natural and spiritual together the same nature that would give us victories things that we would call accomplishments things we would share with our friends and family things that we would hold up is important there is a spiritual sign where were you and I can sit here today and say by God's grace there was a time that I was I felt defeated I felt like giving up and something happened maybe you know exactly what happened but you say you know what this happened and God brought a victory and I got deliverance maybe you come to the word you know we often talk about the little story a brother branham now the man the brother couldn't stop smoking brother branham Howsam send cigarettes to the man the man looks at that and something happened what was it it seems impractical to our mind but there was a victory that was brought right there there was a little woman a little mama that was there she was praying that God would send someone to save her son who had drifted away from the Lord and caught a disease and she's out there and she's leaning on the gate and she's praying believing that God's gonna give an answer to her prayer for her baby and God is there and he moves upon a prophet who's supposed to be catching a plane and he walks out and turns down the street and goes a different direction and follows a leadership to turn and to turn into walk and then he comes and there as he calls it and Aunt Jemima she's there leaning on the fence with the dew of the morning upon her she didn't see someone coming and run out to the fence she had been so focused on God touching her boy that she took the sacrifice and a prophet of God who was focused upon the leadership of God walks out of a little cafe turns right or left I don't remember which it is and goes down the street in a different direction and turns and turns and turns and comes there and that young man received his healing because he had a mama that was focused that God was a healer and God would hear her prayer and God said I've so respect her that he led the Prophet to her to them o my brother and sister we've got to get to a place it's not just casual we got to get to a place that as a church we're not just saying well we just hope that God will do something now look this is not gonna sound right so forgive me Saints but I hope that we were sincere enough on Friday 7:30 to get down and to pray I understand their circumstances in life I'm not I'm not here to belittle to belabor this but my brother and sister we got to get to a place that was sincere enough believing that joining together while we can't do it inside of a building that joining together in the spirit in the presence of God will make a difference but if we're not focused if it doesn't mean anything to us then pray all you like it won't change you got to be sincere it's got to be something you're focused upon oh my brother and sister but look at this now we've had it we've had many of those great battles against our enemy and God has had great men out there that standing at the front who has been able to capture by the Spirit of God the thoughts of the people and throw it into the kingdom of God yonder and come out victorious you say now brother Paul what is brother Branham talking about well let me just put it to you this way Saints we have many testimonies right here in this church many testimonies of ministry that's come through this church and men ministry that's here of the preacher preaching what you spoke of at the table they preached on what you spoke of in your car in your quiet and private places they preached on the scripture that you had been led to be reading they preached on the circumstances that you were enduring or going through at the very moment was that some great man no it's right here my brother and sister God's had great men out there standing front who's been able to capture by the Spirit of God and when you're in the spirit and you have sincere things and you have the sincere desires and sincere questions and you got ministry that is sincere to be able to stand before you and preach the Word of God and the Spirit of God takes what you're speaking and takes this minister and puts them together and takes it back into the word and delivers it out my brother and sister that's nothing less than the power of Almighty God right here in our mist and then people would say well we just don't really see God doing anything well good you sit right there and say gods are not doing anything I'm gonna testify my God hears me and my God hears you and my God will witness that this is his word and he is present to bring it to us hallelujah it's not a man this is not a man I've heard people say well you know this man answered questions this man III had questions about the message of the hour this man answered my question and they put that man up on a pedestal because he spoke to their need and they totally missed it that it was the Spirit of God that man was there by the Spirit of God grasping and it was there that God knew what they needed and anointed that man and he threw that right out into the kingdom of God yonder and he come out victorious but what happened did they go back and give praise to God no oftentimes they lifted the man up my brother and sister were focused on the wrong thing don't lift the man up say God bless you say I appreciate what you preach brother it was good I needed it but give the praise in the glory and the honor to God hallelujah oh my Oh hallelujah you see my brother and sister oh my we fighter we fight it every day every Christian fights a battle every day we're in a warfare right now going on constantly within us between right and wrong shall we receive it what shall we do shall we bow to the world shall we give up this thought that we got and if we see it focus it take it oh my kind of appears to me now I'll be reading between the lines here so I might be out on a limb but he says right here and if we see it focus it ok don't just use a shotgun effect the problem is we got we got way too many message people that you know they think well the shotgun works for defending my house now it ought to work for the message so we'll get one little pellet and a chunk over here and one little pedal and a chunk over here and shred something else and what no my brother and sister the reason hoe behind this I'm gonna sound like a psychologist the reason God made a prophet to where he labored so hard to sight his rifle in so close that it put the bullet through the same hole is because he had to have that same approach to the word not a shotgun effect it had to be precise it had to hit the mark it had to be right there drilled because Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it had to hit the mark hallelujah ya see hope I'm not reading between the lines but it sure looks like he's saying take it back to the word here and if we see it focus it take it from Genesis to Revelation she has thus sayeth the Lord each time right down through there we can't give it up hmmm I just got to mind my manners here I'm feeling feisty this morning we can't compromise with the rest of them we just can't do it we've got to stay here that's all and no matter how many how great the enemy and how much machinery he's got against us and how many organizations and how many of this that and the other we yet we have pulled this focus of God's Word till we find that there's one thing and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever therefore don't make any difference what anyone else says they say the days of miracles past there's no such a thing as divine healing there's no baptism of the Holy Spirit and the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ that was for the disciples only and all these things they're trying to focus off of it oh my you see the versions of the message if it's not right on the Word of God they're trying to focus you right off of to something else in Chile I hope this wouldn't go there I wouldn't want to embarrass anyone but my brother and sister there's ministry that got caught up in the thunders years ago I preached it Church there I've preached it sister Jerry joked that I caught the spirit I was standing on the front row standing on there their deals they're preaching to him I don't know if people hand it here I can't do it here cuz sister su sitting there you might not see her right now but in reality sister Sue's right here amen but my brother and sister you see you would start to preach the word and they were so anointed they would jump up and scream and run up to the pulpit and wave their arms in your face screaming it's like what did I say what they didn't realize they did before the service over by God's grace but what they didn't realize is I was telling them what they believed was false and they jump up out of their seats and scream up to the front and wave their arms in my face we know what they told me they weren't listening their form of worship their form of coming before God had overwhelmed them they no longer listened to the Word of God it was an emotional experience but God was gracious enough I just quit preaching when they would run to the front I just stopped didn't take very long they realized I wasn't interested in all their enthusiasm Suzy Haslam's good Saints we need some right amen if we don't have any emotion we're dead some enthusiasm is good but that's not all the prophet of God says that hearing the Word of God is our priority amen it's not all the rest of this the music the songs all of this is all wonderful it's beautiful I'm glad of it but it's the preaching of the word and the hearing of the word that is the priority and God knows how to work that they like enthusiastic preaching they sure did but what it was as God was doing and you know what happened there that church had a revival and a change complete change of direction because their young people said we say we're special we say God is this but we're no different than anyone else and when the pastor's own son got up and walked out of church not not in that service but previous time said I'm done I'm done the pastor says something's wrong something's wrong but he got focused and he started going from Genesis to Revelation and he realized he had put his church in a little box on this side over here and it was no wonder it wasn't working because we weren't given just to take one little portion of the word we were given Genesis to Revelation we were given the promise I believe it would be a good place to quit right now I've got so much more I knew I did this morning as I was trying to actually just put what I had in order and I kept coming across these things but you see as we'll go I just want to finish this last thought right here and all these things they try to focus off of it what is it distraction my brother and sister people are fine they say you know it's interesting you you deal with you know like seventh-day Adventists and you deal with Jehovah Witnesses and I've got to the place I don't even debate with them I just simply ask them do you guys believe all of the Bible and they will tell you yes we believe all of the Bible all you have to do is bring up a couple points and they have to go you don't even have to argue with them you just have to speak the right things and they won't see they won't go back to the word they've been brought into a religion our message was called to focus us on Jesus Christ not how did how did brother Brown put that I won't get the words exactly right but he said something in the order I'm afraid we're getting people to church and not to Christ let's not do that Saints let's get to Christ that our focus be Jesus Christ not Church hallelujah sister Emmie would you come amen still it focuses right back to the word and nobody can say it's not there
