[39:06] you love them which love you what thank
[39:09] have ye for sinners also love those that
[39:11] love them and if you do good to them
[39:14] which do good to you what thank have ye
[39:15] for sinners also do even the same and if
[39:19] you lend to them of whom you hope to
[39:21] receive what think have ye for sinners

[40:46] getting gotten a garden crazier and
[40:48] crazier father and thousands of years
[40:51] have passed but Thor just says your
[40:53] disciples sat at your feet Lord when you
[40:55] walked in shores of Galilee father so
[40:57] today we have the same need to sit at
[41:00] your feet this morning Lord and hear
[41:01] your words father Lord it's time draws
[41:04] to an end and the culmination father of
[41:06] the Bride of Christ Lord and that the
[41:08] world begins the Lord continues to grown
[41:11] father for the manifestation of the sons
[41:14] of God may we take this morning in the
[41:16] words that you give to us Lord and
[41:18] father apply them Lord to our lives that
[41:21] Lord we could go farther forth into the
[41:23] world and shine your life for Jesus I
[41:26] pray O God that you would soften each
[41:28] heart Lord no woman no one here this
[41:30] morning would be hard or Jesus her
[41:32] father would be pliable or Jesus father
[41:35] would be willing to accept oh Jesus
[41:37] correction willing to accept father Lord
[41:41] encouragement or willing to accept
[41:43] father forgiveness and willing to give
[41:45] forgiveness out or God we love you Lord
[41:48] and we thank you for all these things
[41:49] commit this into your hands now the
[41:51] reading of the word the speaking of
[41:53] these things Lord we ask it in your name
[41:55] we pray Jesus Christ amen
[41:58] you may be seated
[42:05] praise the Lord this morning my title is
[42:09] the book of Acts part 2
[42:10] and if you think number one is missing
[42:13] don't be afraid I already spoke it here
[42:16] it's been a few weeks maybe a month or
[42:18] two but I did I ministered on the /
[42:21] overtaken by Christ and we talked about
[42:24] how Philip and he was translated out -
[42:28] or transported to meet the eunuch and
[42:32] the eunuch was riding in his chariot and
[42:34] he says you know how can I understand
[42:36] these things lest someone teach me and
[42:37] Philip begins to expound to him the
[42:39] things of God and the eunuch says you
[42:41] know what what there's water here let me
[42:43] be baptized and so that was so part 1
[42:46] looking at town how Christ is overtaking
[42:49] our lives in this day and age that we
[42:50] live in and our time and here and that
[42:53] how another book of Acts is being
[42:58] written we have a quote here from 1964
[43:02] God has provided lamb but the venom says
[43:04] how many in here would like for God's
[43:06] provided land to open a lamb to open
[43:09] your eyes so you can see him here now
[43:11] present a man there's several quotes our
[43:13] brother man talks about another book of
[43:15] Acts but I picked this one for led to
[43:17] pick this one because he how he starts
[43:19] at how lure we desire for our eyes
[43:21] should be open amen so that we can see
[43:24] him here now present not a God in the
[43:27] past but a God
[43:28] that's present but the man says all the
[43:30] time people are looking back to see what
[43:32] God has done and looking forward to see
[43:34] what God will do but never catching what
[43:38] God is doing in the present a Manning he
[43:41] says would you raise your hand say God
[43:44] opened my blinded eyes let me have my
[43:47] veil took off of my heart Lord that I
[43:50] might understand and now how will he be
[43:53] known how will we know him by his nature
[43:55] what he does his works he said I am the
[43:58] vine ye are the branches now the branch
[44:01] bears the fruit not the vine the vine
[44:04] energizes the branch and if the branch
[44:06] ever brings forth or a vine brings forth
[44:09] a branch
[44:09] it has grapes on it the next vine comes
[44:12] out or branch out of that vine will have
[44:14] grapes on it if the first church that
[44:15] come off that vine
[44:17] it was a Pentecostal church and with all
[44:20] the gifts if that ever really puts out
[44:22] another branch they'll write another
[44:23] book of Acts behind it that's what they
[44:25] had in the days of the Apostles and the
[44:28] Apostolic age never ended and then that
[44:31] was great controversy in the time of the
[44:33] brand I'm probably still today whether
[44:34] or not that those things were still
[44:36] prevalent I had someone one time a
[44:41] Baptist very loosely a Baptist um tell
[44:47] me that you know well we've moved beyond
[44:49] that stuff we move beyond the speaking
[44:52] in tongues and and all that stuff to
[44:54] move to a perfection and trying to tell
[44:57] me that that stuff isn't prevalent
[44:59] anymore but this morning I'm here to
[45:00] tell you that God still does and is
[45:03] doing what he did in the book of Acts
[45:05] and then he goes on to say he said Peter
[45:06] said on the day of Pentecost repent
[45:08] every one of you and be baptized in the
[45:09] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[45:10] of sins you shall receive the gift of
[45:13] the Holy Ghost for the promises to you
[45:14] and to your children and to them that's
[45:17] far off even as the mini our Lord God
[45:19] shall call amen skip down to the last
[45:22] paragraph 150 says Lord open our eyes
[45:24] and let us see that provided Lamb you
[45:27] promised that you would reveal yourself
[45:29] in the last days like you did at Sodom
[45:31] when the Son of Man was being revealed
[45:32] we pray God that you'll grant it now we
[45:35] are your subjects Lord we are your vines
[45:36] amen this morning amen there is another
[45:40] book of Acts being written the vine has
[45:43] put forth another branch so the vine is
[45:44] not going to the vine has put forth
[45:46] another branch and I believe that that
[45:48] is you this morning I believe that is me
[45:50] this morning and it's interesting you
[45:55] think about the book of Acts and and how
[45:57] there was many many believers but not
[45:59] all of them were mentioned in some way
[46:02] or another some of them were and their
[46:04] testimonies are written down and so I
[46:06] begin to think what will the book of
[46:07] Acts say about me what will it say about
[46:11] you what does it say about you are you
[46:14] written in there Amen I believe if
[46:17] you're living a life for Christ and you
[46:18] have dedicated yourself to serving God
[46:21] and men until the day that you die the
[46:22] song says then I believe that your are
[46:25] being written about but what is it
[46:27] saying amen it is is your your the book
[46:30] of your
[46:31] that's being written is it saying that
[46:33] you persevered and that's you that you
[46:36] Terry that you that you pressed on a man
[46:39] or is it saying that you gave up and
[46:40] that you let yourself fall by the
[46:42] wayside and then I believe when what
[46:44] happens is sometimes God because guess
[46:47] what your books not completed yet so
[46:50] it's still an edited it's still being
[46:52] edited and then we fall by the wayside
[46:54] here and sometimes there we we have
[46:56] moments of where there is no revival in
[46:58] our lives but guess what you can restore
[47:00] that God will go back and he'll after
[47:02] it'll delete a few paragraphs maybe a
[47:04] couple pages and then restore your story
[47:07] amen praise the Lord but the first book
[47:09] is our example even with the first book
[47:13] of Acts we saw the ushering in of the
[47:15] bride amen we saw the transition from
[47:17] the dispensation of the law for the
[47:19] dispensation of grace it's funny when
[47:22] you start to talk about these kind of
[47:23] things
[47:24] some people get a glassy look over their
[47:26] eyes because it's trigger phrases and
[47:28] they go oh here we go deep things again
[47:30] I understand and they turned their self
[47:32] off pay attention this morning
[47:34] catch it amen I tried that when I when I
[47:37] maybe it's a fault I have but when I
[47:39] preach I try to say the same thing with
[47:42] different words so people don't get that
[47:44] glassy look on her face amen I'll do my
[47:47] part God can take care of the rest
[47:49] praise the Lord but the second book of
[47:51] Acts is the ending or the the the
[47:54] crescendo of the Bride of Christ amen
[47:57] it's the culmination it's everything
[47:59] that they wanted in the first book it's
[48:01] everything that they wanted being
[48:03] fulfilled in us him and we are so
[48:05] blessed to be here and in the book of
[48:07] Hebrews says if it was not for us they
[48:10] would not be completed amen so we read
[48:13] the first book and it ends with the
[48:15] death of Paul and the beginning of great
[48:17] tribulation for the bride and man that
[48:20] goes into the dark ages because that
[48:22] seed was planted in the first book but
[48:25] the Bible says that C was planned in the
[48:26] first book and I had to go down into the
[48:28] ground through the dark ages and then it
[48:30] raised up again in the Reformation
[48:31] beginning because um if you have the
[48:35] seed and you don't plant it that seeds
[48:37] not gonna bring forth to life any men so
[48:39] the second book ends with the bride
[48:41] stepping into glory amen so I'm just
[48:44] kind of give
[48:44] you an introduction into this series I
[48:46] don't know how many parts hopefully I'm
[48:49] not gonna say that because then I'm
[48:50] gonna have to eat my words later on
[48:53] praise the Lord
[48:54] but we're on part two talking about the
[48:56] book of Acts and I I want to look at
[48:58] this thing in nad we could go on and
[49:00] hunt it on for weeks months years amen
[49:03] but I want my heart's desire is that
[49:05] there's so much in this Minnis the the
[49:08] time that we are in amen as Christians
[49:11] there's there's so much confusion and
[49:14] there's so much there's so much
[49:16] overthinking and then there's books did
[49:19] you know there's books written in the
[49:20] secular world about overthinking because
[49:22] that's an issue we have in this day and
[49:24] age and I think a lot of that comes from
[49:26] the fact that we don't have to do as
[49:28] much right I mean I'm a software
[49:30] engineer I sit down all day for 12 hours
[49:33] well I try to get up and stuff but
[49:35] regardless life is so easy you have
[49:39] plenty of time to overthink if you're
[49:41] working a manual labor job for 1214
[49:43] hours there's no time to think you just
[49:45] do and back in the old days you know
[49:48] that's what they had to do they had they
[49:50] had to make Amen there they had to
[49:52] survive they had to work with their
[49:54] hands and and bring things and they
[49:56] didn't have the internet to go and and
[49:58] then go and see everybody's opinion and
[50:00] millions of opinions around the world
[50:02] and be consumed by these opinions and so
[50:04] that there was no time to sit and hand
[50:06] over think you know like the Bible says
[50:08] not on this right idleness but the minim
[50:11] says Eilis is the former is a form of
[50:13] idolatry amen you become idle and it and
[50:17] you have these these problems that come
[50:18] out and so my desire is to say you know
[50:21] maybe you don't understand the seven
[50:25] seals maybe you don't understand the
[50:28] even the Godhead maybe there's things
[50:30] that you don't fully understand but
[50:33] there's something in your heart that
[50:34] keeps bringing you back to this place
[50:37] there's something in your heart that
[50:38] keep resonating and and you try to go
[50:42] away from it you try to put it out of
[50:44] your head but it keeps coming back to
[50:46] you it keeps returning back and it keeps
[50:49] reminding you of these things and you
[50:52] say well and then the devil comes in and
[50:53] says well you don't understand it so how
[50:55] can it be true well this morning my
[50:57] prayer and this
[50:58] is my prayer and it has been for some
[51:01] time and in dealing with the youth and I
[51:03] was a part of them so youth leader in
[51:05] Phoenix as well and it's my desire Lord
[51:07] I don't want to to just spew facts and
[51:10] that spew information and and Lord I get
[51:14] up here night and I preach or I talk to
[51:16] the youth I have if you will information
[51:19] I believe that information is revelation
[51:21] inspired of God but I can only speak it
[51:25] you have to accept it and we need and we
[51:28] need the anointing of Christ that's why
[51:31] you the Holy Ghost amen back to the
[51:33] basics but the anointing of Christ you
[51:35] need and and you need to be saying that
[51:38] and speaking those things with that
[51:40] anointing amen there's there there's too
[51:43] many people that speak the things of the
[51:48] message and of the Bible and they here's
[51:52] the thing they might sound the same as
[51:54] someone that's anointed of God they
[51:58] might sound the same of someone that has
[52:00] the revelation they might know how to
[52:03] say the same word but there's no life in
[52:06] it amen
[52:08] there's no life in it and so if we look
[52:14] at the book of Acts amen and then we can
[52:17] just just push aside that the seals push
[52:20] aside the the Godhead those things are
[52:22] important you have to understand those
[52:24] God will reveal those to you in time if
[52:27] you can just stay as steady and stay on
[52:30] the path so let's look at the book of
[52:33] Acts and say what happened then what
[52:36] were they doing how are their lives
[52:38] expressing Christ to the world around
[52:40] him lord help me to put my focus on that
[52:44] if all you do is focus on your questions
[52:47] and focus on your you know these things
[52:49] you don't understand you just fight with
[52:52] doubt find something that you know in
[52:56] the Word of God and watch God begin to
[52:59] build on that because you can eat that I
[53:02] mean you can't give a baby this goes
[53:04] back to this thing and we and when we
[53:06] say it all the time but you can't give a
[53:08] baby unless it's Declan
[53:11] and steak no the baby has to come of age
[53:16] to accept real food up until that point
[53:18] he only takes milk and so many times
[53:21] people have too much pride in their
[53:23] heart to admit there's still a baby
[53:25] Christian and so they continue to try
[53:29] for the steak but they can't digest it
[53:31] and all they do is choke and die you
[53:35] have to humble yourself amen the Word of
[53:38] God says you know the Lord loveth the
[53:40] broken and a contrite spirit of a humble
[53:43] spirit you have to humble yourself and
[53:46] go to that spot that you know go back to
[53:49] the milk of the word because then you'll
[53:52] begin to receive new nutrition you'll
[53:55] begin to receive life and as you receive
[53:57] life what happens you grow and you begin
[54:01] to grow and you begin to grow tell you
[54:03] form the teeth or the ability to accept
[54:07] the revelation of further things in the
[54:10] word amen and brother Branham preached
[54:12] this and preachers around the message
[54:15] say it but we still erred in the same
[54:17] way that says brother Matt says I can't
[54:20] teach Pentecostals the deep things
[54:22] afterward if they don't know their ABCs
[54:24] and people just automatically assume
[54:26] because they're in a message church
[54:28] there beyond the ABCs but you look at
[54:31] their life and you look at the people
[54:33] that sit underneath those preachers who
[54:35] just preach things way over the heads of
[54:38] the congregation never taking them to
[54:42] the beginning taking them to that those
[54:45] things never coming down because we need
[54:47] those deep things there were a mixed
[54:49] congregation there's those in here that
[54:51] can eat that stuff there's those in here
[54:53] that can't and I believe that in this
[54:55] and I believe that an anointed pastor
[54:58] understands that amen praise the Lord
[55:01] but what we have to do as a pastor is as
[55:03] the Shepherd of the flock and I think
[55:05] the Lord we're blessed with a pastor a
[55:07] man that knows how to rightly divide the
[55:09] word of God here so I'm not speaking of
[55:11] our pastor Amen but I believe that a
[55:14] pastor who's a Shepherd of the flock
[55:16] he's like a he's kind of like a um he's
[55:20] got in some ways kind of like a father
[55:21] because you know the father can
[55:25] can he raise his kids but if they if
[55:27] they never receive unconditional love if
[55:30] they never receiving love because
[55:32] they're that man-child
[55:34] a man they can't receive anything from
[55:37] him and and if and if he just beats them
[55:40] up and and and and and then tears them
[55:42] down and always tells them what they're
[55:44] doing wrong and then they go their life
[55:46] without feeling the love they need to
[55:49] develop and a pastor if a pastor does
[55:52] not preach under the anointing of Christ
[55:54] and speak the unconditional love of God
[55:57] amen the people amen the people never
[56:01] begin to feel what it is to love God
[56:05] because how can you love something amen
[56:09] how can you love something that you
[56:11] never receive love from and then we're
[56:14] called to love our means but we're not
[56:15] called to to spend time with him and and
[56:19] try to build relationships within we
[56:21] love them and we pray for them and
[56:22] that's yet a member a father or a pastor
[56:27] has got to express the unconditional
[56:30] love of Christ and unfortunately amen
[56:33] that that that love is so there's places
[56:36] where it priests really hard and that
[56:39] people never feel the love of God they
[56:41] think that God's out to get them then
[56:42] this was praised places on this side
[56:44] words just love love love love love but
[56:46] what it is is it's disgrace disgrace
[56:48] disgrace and it's not true love true
[56:52] love is compassion do you know what
[56:54] brother Brennan said compassion is when
[56:56] Christ braided the whip and chase the
[56:59] money though those people out of the
[57:01] temple beat them out and knock their
[57:03] tables over brother band says that's
[57:05] compassion amen
[57:08] love is not just standing me standing up
[57:11] here and telling you all the time how
[57:13] good you are love is me standing up here
[57:16] all the time telling me who you are in
[57:18] Christ and sometimes that hurts
[57:22] sometimes that hurts praise the Lord
[57:25] praise the Lord we talked to the youth
[57:28] on Friday night and we had a youth
[57:30] meeting in and we talked about how you
[57:33] know we took a match and we said you
[57:34] know the matches is like your soul but
[57:37] you have to strike that match
[57:38] on the matchbox for it to set fire and
[57:41] now whole day that fire is the holy
[57:43] ghost I mean that's striking it that on
[57:46] the box is Jesus Christ and to receive
[57:48] the fire the Holy Ghost it takes
[57:50] friction amen and we're not called to
[57:52] just strike our match once we're called
[57:56] to continue be filled with the Holy
[57:58] Ghost and that takes friction in our
[58:01] lives and we go through things I'm not
[58:04] even on my notes that's a problem when
[58:09] you have your your title as the book of
[58:11] Acts and preach from Genesis to
[58:14] Revelation because it's all in there
[58:15] amen the manifestation of Christ praise
[58:18] the Lord amen mm-hmm praise the Lord I
[58:22] hope I didn't leave a thought hanging
[58:23] there if you forgive me if I did when I
[58:25] went for a drink cause I remember where
[58:26] I was praise the Lord Acts chapter 7 if
[58:31] you want to turn with me there you say
[58:35] you thought I was gonna preach a whole
[58:36] sermon about the book of Acts and never
[58:38] read from acts never fear we have
[58:42] arrived Acts chapter 7 verse 54
[58:58] okay excuse me
[59:03] so Steven we fifi go back in and then
[59:08] further back Peter and the Apostles they
[59:10] said you know what how can it be for us
[59:13] to stop from preaching and go serve
[59:16] tables so they went out and they they
[59:18] they cast them Lots I think it was or
[59:21] however they did it and they decided on
[59:23] it go picked some men and we'll pick
[59:24] from those men we'll pick a few to be
[59:26] deacons and so that's where the
[59:27] beginning of Deacons was so Stephen was
[59:30] one of the first deacons and Stephen is
[59:31] out preaching and he's out testifying of
[59:34] God and the power that God had put in
[59:38] his life and he was already am a man
[59:42] that that well we'll get to that so here
[59:45] he is here Stephen he's preaching in the
[59:46] streets and and the Sanhedrin and the
[59:48] Pharisees the Sadducees and the
[59:50] Pharisees they pull him into the temple
[59:52] and they begin to accuse him and he so
[59:53] he preaches to them and he ends it with
[59:56] you know you stiff-necked and
[59:57] uncircumcised in heart and ears you to
[59:59] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[1:00:01] father's did so do ye then he says who
[1:00:05] have received the law verse 53 by the
[1:00:07] disposition of angels and have not kept
[1:00:10] it how dare this popper this low man
[1:00:18] tell the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:00:20] they have not kept the law and so if we
[1:00:24] find ourselves in verse 54 when they
[1:00:27] heard these things they were cut to the
[1:00:28] heart they were convicted and they
[1:00:32] gnashed on him with their teeth but he
[1:00:35] being full of the Holy Ghost see even
[1:00:37] you see it here even in Paul's life you
[1:00:39] see him preaching to to the Roman that
[1:00:41] the rulers even even these people they
[1:00:45] got a chance even though they already
[1:00:47] turned Jesus down and they had him
[1:00:50] crucified they were given a chance here
[1:00:52] in the Bible to accept the preaching of
[1:00:54] Stephen amen but they and they still
[1:00:57] were given that choice but they turned
[1:00:58] it down verse 55 but he being full of
[1:01:01] the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly
[1:01:04] into heaven and saw the glory of God and
[1:01:06] Jesus standing on the right hand of
[1:01:08] gone and said behold I see the heavens
[1:01:10] opened and the Son of man standing on
[1:01:12] the right hand of God then they cried
[1:01:15] out with a loud voice and stopped their
[1:01:17] ears and ran upon him with one Accord
[1:01:19] and cast him out of the city and stoned
[1:01:24] him and the witnesses laid down their
[1:01:27] clothes at a young man's feet who his
[1:01:29] name was Saul and they stoned Stephen
[1:01:31] calling upon and and they stoned Stephen
[1:01:35] calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus
[1:01:37] receive my spirit and he kneeled down
[1:01:39] and cried with a loud voice Lord explore
[1:01:42] destroy these men for no Lord lay not
[1:01:47] this sin to their charge and when he had
[1:01:49] said this he fell asleep even here we
[1:01:53] have a man of God amen approved by the
[1:01:58] word and been accepted by the people of
[1:02:01] God who preaching the Word of God and
[1:02:04] now has to pay for that with his life
[1:02:08] and and he was doing no wrong he was
[1:02:12] doing he was just showing them the love
[1:02:15] of Christ and they turned it down he was
[1:02:18] preaching for God amen yet as he's dying
[1:02:23] instead of you know praying fire down
[1:02:26] upon them he says Lord lay not this sin
[1:02:29] to their charge and this is where we
[1:02:32] come to unmerited forgiveness is my
[1:02:34] subtitle this morning unmerited
[1:02:36] forgiveness and so there was no reason
[1:02:40] no no no one would have ever questioned
[1:02:43] Stephen no one would have ever um you
[1:02:46] know spoke it out in his funeral how he
[1:02:48] didn't forgive them if he would have
[1:02:50] just died silent but he didn't a man no
[1:02:54] one would have faulted him if he would
[1:02:56] have died calling that the Lord would
[1:02:58] would put a curse upon them no one would
[1:03:00] have faulted him but he didn't he died
[1:03:03] asking God to forgive the very people
[1:03:06] who were taking his life amen what are
[1:03:10] we talking about oh when I was preaching
[1:03:11] about how the book of Acts and and
[1:03:13] you're the second book of Acts and the
[1:03:15] miracles are happening in you you were
[1:03:17] shouting and you were excited but now
[1:03:18] when I say
[1:03:20] as he dies as you die you said God
[1:03:23] forgive them that's a whole nother box
[1:03:26] of stuff to take so whole that's a whole
[1:03:31] different thing to take in but that's
[1:03:34] the friction that we have to experience
[1:03:36] so things happen in their life that
[1:03:38] cause us to die inwardly
[1:03:40] but does that mean swallow our pride
[1:03:43] it's painful amen caused us to swallow
[1:03:48] our pride and we say Lord forgive them
[1:03:54] right didn't you're free because if you
[1:03:57] harbor unforgiveness Amen that
[1:04:00] unforgiveness is going to destroy you
[1:04:03] not the person that harms us even if
[1:04:08] they don't for you did you deserve your
[1:04:15] forgiveness
[1:04:17] you didn't any man
[1:04:20] you didn't Amen but you see as Stephen
[1:04:28] died you cannot deny that he knew Christ
[1:04:32] because he expressed Christ to his dying
[1:04:37] day and that song was appropriate he
[1:04:40] expressed Christ why cuz he passed on
[1:04:44] unconditional love unconditional love is
[1:04:48] given freely there is no you don't have
[1:04:50] to do anything and then I love my wife
[1:04:53] and I love my kids because they're a
[1:04:56] part of me that's the young and they
[1:04:58] they had no choice of doing that right
[1:05:00] that was all God there is no no
[1:05:03] condition I love them for who they are
[1:05:05] Christ loves you for who you are and for
[1:05:09] who you're going to be you say how could
[1:05:12] God love me when I was in the world and
[1:05:14] I was getting high and I was drinking
[1:05:16] beer how could God love me out there
[1:05:18] because he could see who you are and who
[1:05:21] you're going to be inside of you how
[1:05:23] could God love me when I scoffed and
[1:05:25] spit in his face because that's what you
[1:05:28] did amen that's what you did when you
[1:05:31] lived in the world and you sinned you're
[1:05:32] spitting God's
[1:05:33] but God who is rich in mercy he saw who
[1:05:37] you are he saw him even today and you
[1:05:41] you're in sin Church now which is the
[1:05:44] best place you can be even if you don't
[1:05:46] get it even if you don't understand
[1:05:48] everything just come to church just come
[1:05:50] to church and keep asking and keep
[1:05:52] asking amen
[1:05:54] I've heard people friends of mine that
[1:05:56] have left the message and they said I
[1:05:57] asked and I asked for God to show me he
[1:05:59] was real but he never did he never did
[1:06:03] so I left because I felt like I was a
[1:06:05] hypocrite I'm thinking oh my goodness
[1:06:07] all you had to do was keep sitting and
[1:06:10] keep asking and keep asking and keep
[1:06:14] asking but they were chased out of the
[1:06:16] church by someone who couldn't preach to
[1:06:18] them underneath the unconditional love
[1:06:20] of Christ so they felt like they had to
[1:06:22] leave to keep from hindering the church
[1:06:25] we are not called to chase you away
[1:06:29] we're called to preach Christ and if
[1:06:31] Christ chases you away that's that but
[1:06:34] if there's something in your heart that
[1:06:35] says I want God to be real please keep
[1:06:38] coming
[1:06:39] please keep coming and keep taking it
[1:06:41] just keep taking the word and what's
[1:06:44] going to happen you're going to change
[1:06:46] because you can't sit there with
[1:06:48] something in your heart that says Lord I
[1:06:51] want you to be real to me
[1:06:53] what is that that's a see gene of God
[1:06:56] whether or not the outside of you
[1:06:58] manifests that yet there's something
[1:07:00] inside of you calling out and I'm
[1:07:02] yelling because that stirs within me and
[1:07:05] that excites me I'm not mad you praise
[1:07:08] God
[1:07:08] I want the Lord to excite it hurts me
[1:07:12] sometimes and man it pains me Lord how
[1:07:15] can i express the love of Christ to
[1:07:19] someone who laughs in my face how can i
[1:07:22] express the love of Christ there's
[1:07:24] someone who just stares at me with a
[1:07:26] blank look on their face matt has a
[1:07:28] young amen praise the Lord
[1:07:31] how can i express Christ that is what
[1:07:35] we're called to do instead we go and we
[1:07:38] go around and and I and Lord if I never
[1:07:42] want to say anything
[1:07:43] context and our contractors were but
[1:07:46] Lord why why do we always go around
[1:07:48] reaching trying to explain things to
[1:07:52] people instead of expressing we try to
[1:07:55] explain Christ the people said of
[1:07:57] expressing Christ the people stop all
[1:08:02] they're doing is creating confusion all
[1:08:05] you're doing is causing hardships show
[1:08:09] them who Christ is that's what we were
[1:08:11] called to do praise the Lord and that's
[1:08:15] what Stephen did up until the day the
[1:08:18] moment he died you know what you know
[1:08:20] why he did that because Paul was
[1:08:23] standing there if Stephen would have
[1:08:25] died without saying Lord laying out this
[1:08:28] charge upon him Paul would have been
[1:08:30] guilty of Stephens death but because
[1:08:32] Stephen said God forgive them as he died
[1:08:35] Paul was not charged with the death of
[1:08:38] Stephen
[1:08:39] how do you know but Stephen never got to
[1:08:42] stay around and see what happened to
[1:08:44] Paul he found out later on when Paul
[1:08:47] joined him on the other side but he
[1:08:49] never got sometimes you die and you cry
[1:08:52] forgiveness for the person who shot you
[1:08:56] down and you may never know what that
[1:09:00] will do for them you may never know you
[1:09:05] mean the people that knew Saul at that
[1:09:09] time had no idea what he was going to be
[1:09:14] because it's not up to us to decide
[1:09:17] someone's fate because if it was I
[1:09:19] wouldn't be here right now and neither
[1:09:21] would you so don't get all pious on me
[1:09:26] amen if we we need the Lord because he
[1:09:29] can see what's inside of you and we
[1:09:33] can't see it so how dare we pass
[1:09:35] judgment oh they're not on their toast
[1:09:43] even you know you said in the
[1:09:45] congregation you look at me but I had to
[1:09:47] look at your faces and sometimes you
[1:09:50] think they're not getting it they'll
[1:09:53] understand it then you just see time
[1:09:55] goes by and you say oh they work
[1:09:57] it they were understanding it because
[1:10:00] you don't know I don't know I don't know
[1:10:02] how's the time I don't even know you
[1:10:04] know you you have maybe have a good
[1:10:05] friend and and you know you're like hey
[1:10:08] are you alright man oh yeah I'm fine and
[1:10:10] they are fine but they have this look on
[1:10:12] their face right that nothing is fine
[1:10:14] and then but you know they're tired or
[1:10:16] whatever it is amen so we can't even we
[1:10:18] can't even figure our own selves out how
[1:10:21] dare we try to figure someone else out
[1:10:22] you know my wife can't stand I had this
[1:10:26] thing where I don't know when I'm hungry
[1:10:28] so I get hangry
[1:10:30] and she goes if you just eat we wouldn't
[1:10:33] have to deal with you I was like honey I
[1:10:38] just need you to tell me when I'm hungry
[1:10:43] praise the Lord Amen John chapter 8 John
[1:10:59] chapter 8 and verse 1 looked at Stephen
[1:11:06] who was not guilty of his chart
[1:11:08] Oh his death now we'll look at someone
[1:11:14] who was John chapter 8 verse 1 Jesus
[1:11:18] went unto the Mount of Olives and early
[1:11:21] in the morning he came again into the
[1:11:22] temple and all the people came unto him
[1:11:24] and he sat down and taught them and the
[1:11:26] scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a
[1:11:28] woman taken in adultery when they had
[1:11:30] set her in the midst they say unto Him
[1:11:32] master this woman was taken in adultery
[1:11:34] in the very act now Moses in the law
[1:11:39] commanded us that such should be stoned
[1:11:42] but what sayst I always wonder where the
[1:11:44] man was how somehow he got off scot-free
[1:11:48] this they said tempting him that they
[1:11:50] might have this is then that's what you
[1:11:52] get when you have man's judgment not
[1:11:53] God's this they said tempting him that
[1:11:56] they might have him might have to accuse
[1:11:58] him but Jesus stooped down and with his
[1:12:00] finger wrote on the ground as though he
[1:12:02] heard them not so when they continued
[1:12:04] asking him he lifted up himself and said
[1:12:06] unto them he that is without sin among
[1:12:08] you let him first cast
[1:12:11] at her and again he stooped down and
[1:12:13] wrote on the ground and they would heard
[1:12:15] it being convicted by their own
[1:12:16] conscience went out one by one beginning
[1:12:18] at the eldest given unto the last and
[1:12:21] man the eldest started first because
[1:12:22] they lived longer and then they had the
[1:12:24] more of that wisdom and then to accept
[1:12:27] and they'd be eatin crow for a lot
[1:12:29] longer than the younger ones had and
[1:12:31] Jesus was left alone and the woman
[1:12:32] standing in the midst when Jesus had
[1:12:34] lifted up himself and saw none but the
[1:12:36] woman he said unto her woman where are
[1:12:38] those thine accusers hath no man
[1:12:40] condemned thee she said no man Lord and
[1:12:43] jesus said unto her neither do i condemn
[1:12:45] thee go and sin no more she was caught
[1:12:48] in the very act completely guilty of
[1:12:51] breaking the law they had every right to
[1:12:54] throw stones at her they had no right to
[1:12:56] throw stones at Stephen but they had
[1:12:58] every right to throw stones at her
[1:13:00] because Christ had not yet died on
[1:13:02] Calvary Jesus says you without sin you
[1:13:06] cast the first stone and that's what
[1:13:09] we're talking about this morning
[1:13:10] unmerited forgiveness if you think you
[1:13:15] can cast judgment then show me that you
[1:13:19] have no sin well the man who says we are
[1:13:22] not as Christians we are not sinners but
[1:13:24] Christians have sinned little things we
[1:13:28] do you know cuz of the flesh yet we we
[1:13:33] stand in judgment to seal the deal cast
[1:13:39] the stones break break them down we get
[1:13:42] so caught up in our anger amen like this
[1:13:44] this whole world is freaking out over
[1:13:46] this George Floyd thing perhaps that cop
[1:13:50] was caught in a fit of anger because
[1:13:52] that man said something to him and now
[1:13:54] look what he's paying for right then
[1:13:58] their anger they were ready to kill her
[1:14:01] take her out of the picture and God says
[1:14:06] okay you with other sin cast the first
[1:14:08] stone you can't do it there is time and
[1:14:15] place for correction but there is never
[1:14:19] a time a place for you to judge someone
[1:14:21] in or out
[1:14:24] love is corrective she was corrected the
[1:14:29] unspoken sometimes God doesn't have to
[1:14:32] say anything to you to use coming to his
[1:14:34] presence and you are corrected the
[1:14:38] unspoken between Jesus and that woman
[1:14:41] she was corrected here she is before
[1:14:44] this this this this holy man is she
[1:14:47] called him more she had respect for him
[1:14:49] here she is
[1:14:50] and there openly saying what she had
[1:14:52] done it was not hidden anymore and now
[1:14:55] she stands ashamed and corrected of what
[1:14:58] she done God says you're forgiven go and
[1:15:03] sin no more that's what God did for you
[1:15:06] and does for you you say God forgive me
[1:15:09] and he does it why are we so quick to
[1:15:12] turn and say we can't forgive them
[1:15:14] praise the Lord because where are your
[1:15:17] accusers now even when you stand and I'm
[1:15:23] just standing people accuse you and
[1:15:27] judge you a man but God comes rich in
[1:15:32] mercy and he asks you now where are your
[1:15:36] accusers I ask you now that all those
[1:15:39] sins that you've done that you had
[1:15:42] remitted where are your accusers that
[1:15:46] feeling of forgiveness that you felt
[1:15:49] when you made your life right with God I
[1:15:52] don't have to ask you to raise your hand
[1:15:54] cuz I know every single one of you would
[1:15:55] if you've been there wasn't that the
[1:15:57] best feeling in the world
[1:16:00] why wouldn't you want to give that same
[1:16:02] gift or someone else's why wouldn't you
[1:16:06] want to give that same gift to someone
[1:16:07] else
[1:16:13] amen go and sin no more bull mmm says in
[1:16:16] the quote waters of separation 1955
[1:16:21] Isaac get to that there he says I went
[1:16:27] over it's a long quote I went over the
[1:16:29] little restaurant was closed so I just
[1:16:31] walked across the road to a common
[1:16:32] little drive-in place every what they
[1:16:34] call it and as I walked in the door
[1:16:36] there stood a policemen about my age
[1:16:37] don't be reading ahead of me brother Tim
[1:16:39] a man about 40 years old with his arm
[1:16:41] around a woman playing a slot machine
[1:16:44] and gambling is illegal in Ohio and
[1:16:46] there the law he says I thought what is
[1:16:48] this world coming to a man have you
[1:16:49] thought that don't lie
[1:16:51] you did it brethren everybody's afraid
[1:16:55] of Communists and everybody's afraid
[1:16:56] that Russia is going to come over
[1:16:57] Germany is going to come over don't be
[1:16:59] afraid of any nation whipping us they're
[1:17:00] not going to whip us were whipping
[1:17:01] ourselves our own morals is what's
[1:17:04] polluting us paragraph 19 there was a
[1:17:08] policeman to uphold the law standing
[1:17:10] there perhaps a married man with a bunch
[1:17:11] of children at home playing a slot
[1:17:13] machine I thought oh mercy I looked back
[1:17:15] at the back of a young waitress standing
[1:17:17] back there very vulgar vulgar Lee
[1:17:19] dressed and some boys half drunk with
[1:17:21] their arms around her doing things that
[1:17:22] ought not to be they ought not to do I
[1:17:24] thought oh my let me get out of here you
[1:17:27] ever felt that before ma'am and I
[1:17:29] happened to look to my right and there's
[1:17:30] had an old lady old enough to be my
[1:17:32] grandmother probably 65 or better you
[1:17:34] seen that yes she had on those foul
[1:17:38] clothes little short clothes and the
[1:17:40] purple looking stuff on her face and her
[1:17:42] toenails painted the same way poor old
[1:17:43] thing her skin was wrinkled and hanging
[1:17:45] her hair 'hard real clothes the blue
[1:17:47] looking color have you seen that and how
[1:17:50] did you feel God have mercy
[1:17:53] just get me out of here right and I
[1:17:56] thought isn't that terrible and sitting
[1:17:57] with two old men and them drunk one of
[1:17:59] them in summertime was a big R big army
[1:18:02] overcoat on and I said oh my I said God
[1:18:05] how can you stand it I said how why
[1:18:07] don't you wipe it off the face of the
[1:18:08] earth then I was sitting there thinking
[1:18:10] that and all of a sudden something
[1:18:12] struck me and the Lord said for me to
[1:18:14] sit down and I went oh sometimes the law
[1:18:17] has to tell you hey hey boy hey girl sit
[1:18:19] down shut up and I went over in a corner
[1:18:23] behind the door and started praying I
[1:18:25] thought Lord it looks like that you just
[1:18:26] simply tear the whole why will my little
[1:18:28] Rebecca and Sarah my two little girls
[1:18:30] have to be raised up here in the world
[1:18:32] under such as that oh maybe he did see
[1:18:35] it maybe he didn't but if he can only
[1:18:37] see it now I thought how can you stand
[1:18:39] it when it makes a sinner like me shiver
[1:18:41] to think of such a thing well I got back
[1:18:44] here on I saw a vision that changed my
[1:18:46] picture all together I mean that's what
[1:18:48] God does that's what I believe God is
[1:18:50] doing this morning if you can accept it
[1:18:52] as he's changing your picture he's
[1:18:54] saying look you you you what you're
[1:18:55] seeing you think is truth you think is
[1:18:59] the way it should be but I'm here Christ
[1:19:01] is saying I'm here to show you this is
[1:19:03] actually what it is well I got back
[1:19:08] there I saw a vision okay changed my
[1:19:11] picture altogether I've seen a world a
[1:19:12] turning and a notice around it was a
[1:19:14] streak like red all around and I
[1:19:16] wondered what it was and as I drew close
[1:19:17] I see myself as a boy and when I would
[1:19:20] sin well then I seen Jesus standing in
[1:19:22] front between me and God and his blood
[1:19:24] act as a bumper every time I do anything
[1:19:27] wrong it would hit him and he'd say
[1:19:29] Father forgive him he don't know what
[1:19:31] he's doing
[1:19:32] and I'd do something else in the know
[1:19:33] just like the bumper on a car to keep me
[1:19:35] God can't stand sin the day you sin
[1:19:37] you're gone that's all but the blood of
[1:19:39] Jesus was protecting me
[1:19:40] the wrath of God from me and my sin
[1:19:43] would catch it and he'd say Father
[1:19:44] forgive him he didn't know what he's
[1:19:46] doing and I looked at I said Lord is my
[1:19:49] sins treating you like that and the
[1:19:51] blood running down his face I looked
[1:19:53] crawled up a little closer and I seen a
[1:19:55] book there and my name was at the top
[1:19:56] all kinds of sin wrote on it and I said
[1:19:59] will you forgive me he touched his side
[1:20:01] and he wrote pardon thrown it over in
[1:20:03] the back behind him in the sea of
[1:20:05] forgetfulness and I said
[1:20:06] how I appreciate you Lord so is he
[1:20:10] seeing his sins being forgiven and
[1:20:12] you've you've seen your sins being
[1:20:14] forgiven and you you you thank God for
[1:20:16] your sins being forgiven and God turns
[1:20:18] around and says now I was willing to
[1:20:20] forgive you of your sins but you want to
[1:20:21] condemn her for her I say this morning
[1:20:24] you've been forgiven of your sins and
[1:20:25] you felt the freedom and deliverance but
[1:20:27] yet you'll turn around and catch judges
[1:20:29] all your brother or your sister and
[1:20:32] condemn them for their sin saying God
[1:20:33] forgive them lay not it lay it not to
[1:20:36] their charge you're not responsible for
[1:20:38] forgiving them for what they've done
[1:20:39] outside of you but for what they've done
[1:20:41] to you you could say God forgive them I
[1:20:44] forgive them and but the battle had a
[1:20:51] real turning around right there he says
[1:20:54] you know we're gonna see and he went and
[1:20:57] he stopped to walk up to the lady and he
[1:21:00] said hey can I talk to you for a second
[1:21:02] and she says oh I already have company
[1:21:04] and he goes not like that not like that
[1:21:05] where are you were you ever a Christian
[1:21:08] and she said yeah she had been a
[1:21:09] Christian and she taken the wrong row
[1:21:11] and she had two nice young ladies four
[1:21:13] daughters and here she was living like
[1:21:15] this and brother bantam letter to the
[1:21:16] Lord right there in that cafe I mean
[1:21:20] it's amazing what God can do through you
[1:21:22] when you're willing to Humble your own
[1:21:24] pride amen and pass out that forgiveness
[1:21:30] Genesis chapter 42
[1:21:45] Genesis 42 verse 1
[1:21:53] now when Jacob saw that there was corn
[1:21:56] in Egypt Jacob said unto his sons why do
[1:21:59] you look one upon another and he said
[1:22:01] behold I have heard that there is corn
[1:22:03] in Egypt gets you down bitter and by for
[1:22:05] us from thence that we may live and not
[1:22:07] die and Joseph's 10 brethren went down
[1:22:09] to buy corn in Egypt but Benjamin
[1:22:11] Joseph's brother Jacob sent not with his
[1:22:14] brethren for he said lest peradventure
[1:22:16] mischief befall him and the sons of
[1:22:19] Israel came to buy corn among those that
[1:22:21] came for the famine was in the land of
[1:22:23] Canaan and Joseph was the governor over
[1:22:25] the land and he he it was that sold to
[1:22:28] all the people of the land and Joseph's
[1:22:30] brethren came and bowed down themselves
[1:22:32] before him with their faces to the earth
[1:22:34] and Joseph saw his brethren he knew them
[1:22:37] but made himself strange unto them and
[1:22:39] spake roughly unto them and he said unto
[1:22:42] them whence come he and they said from
[1:22:43] the land of Canaan to buy food and
[1:22:45] Joseph knew his brethren but they knew
[1:22:48] him not knew not him and Joseph
[1:22:50] remembered the dreams which he dreamed
[1:22:52] of them and said unto them ye are spies
[1:22:54] to see the nakedness of the land ye are
[1:22:56] come now I bring this example and when
[1:23:00] we'll finish the story because some were
[1:23:03] not perfect people and sometimes when
[1:23:06] we're called to pass on forgiveness we
[1:23:09] don't always do it the first time we we
[1:23:13] stew over it and we think about and so
[1:23:16] here's Joseph and we think about he
[1:23:17] begins to he sees his brother and
[1:23:19] instantly he ever he ever gone away and
[1:23:22] then you go back and you see someone for
[1:23:23] the first time in a couple of years that
[1:23:25] has done you wrong and you kind of moved
[1:23:27] on with your life and you forgotten and
[1:23:28] you see them because you never forgave
[1:23:30] them and suddenly something with and you
[1:23:31] just raises up and you're angry at them
[1:23:33] here's Joseph he's been years gone from
[1:23:36] Canaan gone through all kinds of things
[1:23:39] a Amen and here he is and then he sees
[1:23:42] them again and all those things come
[1:23:43] back all the offhand remarks and the
[1:23:46] smacks on the side of the head from his
[1:23:47] older brothers and and everything else
[1:23:49] that they did throwing him in the pit
[1:23:51] Amen telling him in the slavery and
[1:23:53] everything he went through because they
[1:23:55] did that to him begins to come up to his
[1:23:58] remembrance
[1:23:59] and he remembers Amen how he was shipped
[1:24:02] of his coat he remembers how how he was
[1:24:04] falsely accused by Potiphar's wife and
[1:24:07] now he had to go to prison and then in
[1:24:09] prison when he's given an opportunity
[1:24:10] that he's forgotten he's going through
[1:24:14] all these things all these these disease
[1:24:17] feelings of anger and resentment towards
[1:24:20] theirs brothers if you were Joseph well
[1:24:24] how would you feel when you saw them
[1:24:27] you're now raised in to a position of
[1:24:29] authority with the ability to get
[1:24:32] revenge he could have said they're spies
[1:24:38] and that could have been the innovator
[1:24:45] what would you do who would we do one of
[1:24:51] these days we'll all be rulers raised up
[1:24:54] to the right hand of God we have to
[1:24:57] learn here on earth how to rule Amen
[1:25:01] with the right amount of grace so Joseph
[1:25:05] was in turmoil he says they're spies he
[1:25:09] sends them off to prison and and then he
[1:25:15] feels bad so he gives him all their
[1:25:17] money back puts him back in the sacks
[1:25:20] and they go off and Joseph in his heart
[1:25:23] he knows his famines going to last seven
[1:25:25] years and he knows they're going to be
[1:25:27] back it's part of the story you have to
[1:25:30] fill in the blanks there he knows
[1:25:31] they're going to come back and so he
[1:25:35] says he says well you have to leave one
[1:25:40] guy here and bring me this other
[1:25:43] brothers you supposedly have you're just
[1:25:45] younger brother you supposedly have to
[1:25:47] prove to me you're not spies and so they
[1:25:51] leave they leave Simeon yes yep and so
[1:25:59] they go back and take upstairs in no way
[1:26:01] are you going to take Benjamin Simeon
[1:26:05] can rot in prison
[1:26:09] you're not taking Benjamin back but see
[1:26:12] this was a process that had to take
[1:26:15] place because God needed to bring them
[1:26:18] back right needed to bring this this
[1:26:21] thing together and so they run out of
[1:26:24] grain and they started getting me hungry
[1:26:26] and when you get hungry you get
[1:26:28] desperate and so will they go back amen
[1:26:33] and I didn't I didn't jot down the
[1:26:37] scriptures of the in between but you can
[1:26:39] go back and read it they go back and and
[1:26:41] they bring Benjamin and then they put
[1:26:44] the Benjamin the Joseph cup in
[1:26:46] Benjamin's sack after after having lunch
[1:26:48] with him and so they go after him and
[1:26:51] how dare you do all this amen but I
[1:26:56] skipped ahead here a couple of points I
[1:26:58] want to make so this anger is raised
[1:27:03] rising up within Joseph as he sees his
[1:27:05] brother before he sends him away or or
[1:27:06] while he's thinking about this you know
[1:27:08] they have to come back and simians in
[1:27:09] prison and that's a burden on his
[1:27:11] shoulders he he knows he probably
[1:27:12] shouldn't have done that and he's this
[1:27:14] is this all this is going through him
[1:27:16] and here here's the very people who
[1:27:19] unjustly ruined his life
[1:27:22] or did they this is the paradox of God
[1:27:29] he say up until Joseph had was up until
[1:27:34] Joseph was in the place that he can look
[1:27:36] back on his life excuse me look back on
[1:27:42] his life when he came out of the dark
[1:27:46] part and he was on the right hand of
[1:27:48] Pharaoh until he could look back he had
[1:27:53] no idea everything was happening to move
[1:27:57] him into a position greater than he ever
[1:28:00] thought right now maybe someone is is is
[1:28:06] is doing what Joseph's brothers did to
[1:28:08] him to you you have no way of looking
[1:28:12] into the future and seeing what's going
[1:28:15] to happen because of it but all things
[1:28:19] work together for good to those that
[1:28:21] love God
[1:28:22] you are called and chosen for this time
[1:28:26] Esther Esther for such a time as this
[1:28:31] Esther was stripped of her family raised
[1:28:34] by Mordecai taken from Mordecai put into
[1:28:37] the palace then she becomes Queen right
[1:28:41] now she can look back and she's in a
[1:28:44] place to make a decision
[1:28:45] Josef's in a place to make a decision in
[1:28:47] this look he looks back and and I
[1:28:49] believe I believe maybe at this point
[1:28:50] this is when Joseph began to look back
[1:28:52] and think about everything that had
[1:28:55] happened because he says in there that
[1:28:58] will will read it he begin to look back
[1:29:01] and everything that happened and begins
[1:29:03] to see how God's hand was in it all
[1:29:06] along the way people see what happens is
[1:29:10] people go to prison like Joseph
[1:29:13] spiritually speaking not actual prisons
[1:29:16] some of them do but and not actual
[1:29:17] prison then they go into a place
[1:29:19] something happens there unjustly or
[1:29:21] unfairly put in a position maybe by the
[1:29:23] way they were raised maybe they weren't
[1:29:25] shown the law that they needed they were
[1:29:27] put in a position and they say well how
[1:29:32] can God love me if he did this how
[1:29:38] Joseph said prison he could have said
[1:29:40] how can God love me and he puts me here
[1:29:42] and if he never went to win would have
[1:29:44] went to prison he would have never
[1:29:46] talked to the cupbearer and the bit
[1:29:50] butler the baker the butler and the
[1:29:52] Baker then he would have never got to be
[1:29:56] in front of Pharaoh people see we get to
[1:30:00] a place in life and we think we've
[1:30:01] arrived we're successful we've come to
[1:30:05] this place and then partisanship
[1:30:07] Oliver's wife comes around and you get
[1:30:09] knocked back down you think my goodness
[1:30:11] I had it made it's so unfair let that
[1:30:13] happen
[1:30:14] why am i here how could God love me you
[1:30:17] were raised by an abusive parent or or
[1:30:19] something happened he say well how could
[1:30:21] God love me if he'd like me to go
[1:30:23] through that you don't see your future
[1:30:28] you don't know what God's going to do I
[1:30:31] can see this this morning because I
[1:30:34] speak from experience I can't look back
[1:30:37] and I can say that darkness was for this
[1:30:40] purpose if I would have not been there
[1:30:43] and been low I would not be here today
[1:30:48] whom you pray for preachers because they
[1:30:51] preach the most effective when they
[1:30:53] preached from experience Amen so we have
[1:30:56] to go through things just like everyone
[1:30:58] else everyone goes through trials but
[1:31:01] even you can go through things
[1:31:03] maybe it's jut you go through that just
[1:31:05] so you can expect from experience you
[1:31:08] know unless you walk a mile in his
[1:31:10] moccasins even you whether you're a
[1:31:13] preacher a housewife a song leader a
[1:31:16] school girl a school boy just someone
[1:31:19] living their life notes no special place
[1:31:22] in the church oh lord have mercy
[1:31:24] what is that who cares about that I'm no
[1:31:28] special or more special than you are I'm
[1:31:32] a servant to the God's people you people
[1:31:36] need a position you already got a
[1:31:38] position you're a son and daughter of
[1:31:40] God you're a child of the king how much
[1:31:44] better could you ask for you ever you
[1:31:46] ever see somebody and you know their
[1:31:51] parents are millionaires my kind of if I
[1:31:53] was them right guess what you are them
[1:31:58] tonight you too you are them you're a
[1:32:01] child of the king you couldn't ask for a
[1:32:03] better position than to be a child of
[1:32:05] the king what does that mean why cos
[1:32:08] you're heir to the throne and all things
[1:32:12] all things in the kingdom are available
[1:32:15] to you healing deliverance everything
[1:32:21] praise the Lord so until you know until
[1:32:24] you get to a place where you can look
[1:32:25] back and see what God was doing Joseph
[1:32:27] he would have had no idea he speaks to
[1:32:30] the puzzler a little glimmer of hope
[1:32:32] that happens to us we see a glimmer of
[1:32:34] hope maybe this is it maybe this is our
[1:32:35] big break and then you forget forgotten
[1:32:40] the butler forgets you
[1:32:42] but it's because the time wasn't right
[1:32:46] if the Bella would have just went to
[1:32:48] Pharaoh and said hey there was this guy
[1:32:49] in the prison he interpreted my dreams
[1:32:51] you ought to give this man another
[1:32:52] chance
[1:32:53] who is this okay well pull him out of
[1:32:55] prison and we'll make him a slave
[1:32:56] instead over here in this in this house
[1:32:59] because he was a house slave right yeah
[1:33:00] I'm from Potiphar okay well make him a
[1:33:02] house slave over here in a story but God
[1:33:09] God world their world over created all
[1:33:14] famine so he could bring Joseph into
[1:33:19] position do you think the world around
[1:33:22] you is just unrelated to you you see the
[1:33:27] turmoil going on it's for you without it
[1:33:32] we can't get out of here
[1:33:35] that's the age-old thing you know people
[1:33:37] get all bold and they get anointed and
[1:33:39] they sit by god I'm gonna stand here and
[1:33:41] I'll give my life you know and at some
[1:33:43] points the gun at them and it's a
[1:33:44] different story
[1:33:45] right but you God will anoint you for
[1:33:48] the time I a little bit funny
[1:33:49] when I said that so God will anoint you
[1:33:51] for what you need but people say oh you
[1:33:54] know well this is what we want we want
[1:33:56] the world to fall apart and and then the
[1:33:58] people that are feeling but scared they
[1:33:59] feel like ashamed of themselves and they
[1:34:01] try to act like they're brave too look
[1:34:03] don't act brave don't pretend to be
[1:34:04] brave just become more like God that's
[1:34:07] all that you have to do because guess
[1:34:09] what this everything that's going on is
[1:34:11] for you look at it that way don't look
[1:34:12] at it like it has to happen and oh it's
[1:34:15] afraid because it's gonna be it has to
[1:34:17] get terrifying it to be the end no it
[1:34:19] has to get the way it does just for you
[1:34:21] so you can be elevated there had to come
[1:34:24] a famine so Joseph could be elevated
[1:34:25] there has to come a family in the world
[1:34:27] and death because so that you can be
[1:34:29] elevated to your position for the right
[1:34:31] hand of Pharaoh
[1:34:33] Genesis chapter 44 we pick up the story
[1:34:35] here in verse 30 44 verse 30 there's now
[1:34:39] if therefore when I come okay so he
[1:34:41] takes him and he says you know we're
[1:34:43] gonna we're gonna kill Benjamin because
[1:34:44] he stole the cup or something along
[1:34:46] those lines you forgive my ignorance
[1:34:49] there I don't remember the story
[1:34:51] completely at the moment but here is
[1:34:53] Reuben speaking
[1:34:56] they make sure it's ribbon Judah Judah
[1:34:59] is speaking and he says in verse three
[1:35:01] says now therefore when I come to thy
[1:35:03] servant my father and the lad or
[1:35:05] Benjamin be not with us seeing that his
[1:35:06] life is bound up in the lads life it
[1:35:09] shall come to pass when he say that the
[1:35:10] lad is not with us that he will die and
[1:35:12] thy servant shall bring down the gray
[1:35:14] hairs as I serve and our Father with
[1:35:16] sorrow to the grave for thy servant
[1:35:18] become surety became surety for the lad
[1:35:20] unto my father saying if I bring him not
[1:35:22] unto thee then I shall bear the blame to
[1:35:25] my father forever now therefore I pray
[1:35:27] thee let thy servant abide instead of
[1:35:29] the lad at bond men to my lord and let
[1:35:31] the lad go up with his brethren for how
[1:35:34] shall I go up to my father and the lad
[1:35:36] be not with me let's peradventure I see
[1:35:38] the evil that shall come on my father
[1:35:40] chapter 45 and Joseph could not refrain
[1:35:43] himself before all them that stood by
[1:35:45] him and he cried cause every man to go
[1:35:47] out from me and there should no man with
[1:35:49] him while Joseph made himself known unto
[1:35:51] his brethren and he wept aloud and the
[1:35:53] Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard
[1:35:55] and Joseph said unto his brethren I am
[1:35:57] Joseph tough my father yet live and his
[1:36:00] brethren could not answer him for they
[1:36:01] were trouble at his presence and Joseph
[1:36:04] said unto his brethren come near to me I
[1:36:06] pray you and they came there and he said
[1:36:08] I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold
[1:36:10] into Egypt now if therefore be not
[1:36:13] grieved nor angry with yourselves that
[1:36:17] you sold me hither for God that sent me
[1:36:19] before you to preserve life for these
[1:36:22] two years have the famine been in the
[1:36:24] land and yet there are five years in the
[1:36:26] which there shall neither be hearing nor
[1:36:28] harvest and God sent me before you to
[1:36:31] preserve you a posterity in the earth
[1:36:34] and to save your lives by a great
[1:36:36] deliverance God sent me before you a man
[1:36:40] Joseph being called of God finds
[1:36:43] forgiveness within him and when he finds
[1:36:46] that forgiveness he begins to find the
[1:36:48] will of God because guess what it's kind
[1:36:53] of the paradox of humanity right if you
[1:36:55] don't have forgiveness now there's
[1:36:57] something between you and God now you
[1:37:00] can't clearly see God's will but if you
[1:37:04] forgive now God's fear begins to move
[1:37:06] within you and you begin to see God's
[1:37:08] hand in the situation now you can turn
[1:37:11] around and help that very person who
[1:37:14] caused you pain and the freedom that
[1:37:18] Joseph must have felt when he forgave
[1:37:20] his brethren what profit is it to
[1:37:25] forgive someone who deserves it we read
[1:37:28] that in the Beatitudes in Luke you know
[1:37:30] what what good is it to to lend somebody
[1:37:33] something and an expected in return the
[1:37:35] sinners do that or and what good is it
[1:37:37] to give a love and went to someone who
[1:37:38] loves you the sinners even do that what
[1:37:41] good is it to forgive someone who
[1:37:42] deserves it because guess what that
[1:37:44] first of all first of all no one
[1:37:46] deserves forgiveness right you have to
[1:37:49] give that that's that's yours to give
[1:37:51] that's a power you hold t.c power
[1:37:53] without character is state tennis
[1:37:55] because the ability to forgive someone
[1:37:58] of the ability to have forgiveness to
[1:38:00] hand out is a power you hold how you use
[1:38:03] that power is what you'll be judged for
[1:38:06] praise the Lord then one last story here
[1:38:09] the musicians would come when most
[1:38:14] everyone knows who she is Corrie ten
[1:38:16] Boom if you haven't read her book it's I
[1:38:19] highly recommend it
[1:38:20] it's very moving story but she and her
[1:38:22] sister were were hiding Jews and they
[1:38:25] got caught and they were sent to the
[1:38:26] concentration camp and she watched her
[1:38:28] sister brutally abused she was brutally
[1:38:31] abused and she watched her sister die
[1:38:32] and she went on to survive the the
[1:38:37] concentration camps in World War two I
[1:38:39] think he was and she now was traveling
[1:38:42] all around the world speaking of her
[1:38:44] experience and how God preserved her
[1:38:46] life and and about forgiveness and she
[1:38:50] was speaking out somewhere and I think
[1:38:52] it was in Germany and she she got done
[1:38:56] speaking and she she's walking out of
[1:38:59] the the venue and a man steps in front
[1:39:02] of her with his wife and she recognized
[1:39:04] him she recognized him as one of the
[1:39:07] soldiers in the concentration camp and
[1:39:08] all that anger and resentment and pain
[1:39:12] and bitterness came back and she felt
[1:39:15] nothing good towards the man
[1:39:17] and he says he didn't know she
[1:39:20] recognized him he said I was one of
[1:39:21] those sought Nazi soldiers in this
[1:39:23] concentration camp you were in and you
[1:39:26] talked about forgiveness will you
[1:39:29] forgive me
[1:39:31] she said she ward within herself because
[1:39:35] she knew she was called by God to
[1:39:37] forgive him regardless of what she did
[1:39:41] what he did whether he deserved it or
[1:39:44] not she was called to hand him
[1:39:46] forgiveness the gift of forgiveness so
[1:39:49] she put her hand out she said it felt
[1:39:51] like a chunk of wood but as the soldier
[1:39:55] took her hand and she said I forgive you
[1:39:58] compassion and grace and love flowed
[1:40:01] through her and she forgave the man
[1:40:04] completely
[1:40:07] sometimes God asks us a lot of times God
[1:40:11] asks us to do stuff that we don't feel
[1:40:14] at the time we want to do we're upset or
[1:40:19] mad why do they treat me like that
[1:40:22] how could they do that to me we're upset
[1:40:27] god I mercy or upset see how can they go
[1:40:32] all those years doing that damage to me
[1:40:35] and to my family and not not even care
[1:40:40] say it's all my fault
[1:40:44] maybe you can't shake their hand
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:49] but we are called to forgive them and
[1:40:53] you don't have to do it on your own God
[1:40:57] will give you the strength God will give
[1:41:00] you the power to say whether you have
[1:41:03] whether you get the chance to verbally
[1:41:05] say it or whether you just something in
[1:41:07] your heart you have to hand to them
[1:41:09] spiritually and say god I forgive me
[1:41:17] it's not gonna be layer of charcoal to
[1:41:34] forgive to forgive is to extend
[1:41:39] unconditional loving hand of God
[1:41:43] we have no problem saying we're God's
[1:41:46] children the miracles will come but then
[1:41:52] when it says we're God's children we
[1:41:54] have to forgive people turn around and
[1:41:57] walk don't be that person today
[1:42:01] forget unforgiveness as harbored in your
[1:42:04] heart is going to create bitterness and
[1:42:06] bitterness brother Branham says drives
[1:42:08] the Holy Spirit right out of your life
[1:42:12] don't let the root of bitterness take
[1:42:14] control if a root of bitterness has I
[1:42:17] challenge you this morning to hand out
[1:42:20] forgiveness we are the second books book
[1:42:27] of acts to the world are we gonna be
[1:42:31] like the Pharisees are you gonna be like
[1:42:35] Stephen and say father I lay not lay not
[1:42:39] discharged under them basically that's
[1:42:47] what it's all about saints of God
[1:42:50] there's some people in the world that
[1:42:52] will never get everything that we we
[1:42:56] have in their language
[1:42:57] maybe they'll never catch a revelation
[1:42:59] of the seals they never catch a
[1:43:00] revelation of of the Godhead but they
[1:43:03] catch a revelation that this is Christ
[1:43:06] they're gonna be there now as a American
[1:43:12] citizen speaking English you had that at
[1:43:14] your hands so when I tell you don't
[1:43:15] worry about that I don't mean don't ever
[1:43:18] worry about it
[1:43:19] don't worry about it right now all in
[1:43:21] good time will it come and then all in
[1:43:25] good time just serve God like I
[1:43:28] mentioned those friends I had they were
[1:43:30] part of my youth group they were part of
[1:43:31] my youth group they said you know what I
[1:43:32] prayed and just God never showed himself
[1:43:34] a little to me I had experiences and had
[1:43:36] anointings but it was never real to me
[1:43:39] they left too soon well we don't know
[1:43:42] the end of the story right but I know
[1:43:46] the end of the story just feed on the
[1:43:51] word don't and when i say feed on the
[1:43:54] word don't think you have to go get the
[1:43:55] seven seals if that's where you are
[1:43:57] please do but if you're not there yet if
[1:44:01] you don't know if god's real to you
[1:44:03] that's where you start you just pray we
[1:44:07] heard that about praying you know you
[1:44:09] don't just pray one once and then that's
[1:44:11] all you're allowed to pray that that
[1:44:13] lady she kept knocking on the judge's
[1:44:15] door keep knocking the Bible listen says
[1:44:20] knock twice and it shall be answered or
[1:44:22] he said to be opened unto you
[1:44:24] Bevell says knock
[1:44:26] Abraham and Sarah knock for 25 plus
[1:44:30] years before the promised son was given
[1:44:33] to them and you have a promise son who
[1:44:35] is Christ and he will be given to you if
[1:44:37] you persist because how do you know how
[1:44:41] do you know and I know that I I'm taking
[1:44:42] up too much time but how do you know how
[1:44:45] do we know that my friends we're not
[1:44:48] just that close how do we know we don't
[1:44:54] know that
[1:44:56] as a parent how do you know your child's
[1:44:59] not that close how do you know that
[1:45:06] that that's your forgiveness to someone
[1:45:08] won't save their life
[1:45:11] suicide is a real thing in the day and
[1:45:13] age that we live in I mean how do you
[1:45:16] know you they're too full of pride and
[1:45:19] they're paying for what they did but
[1:45:20] they can't bring themselves to talk to
[1:45:22] you so they're anointed of a devil to go
[1:45:24] take their lives but you give them
[1:45:26] forgiveness and use spirit you hold life
[1:45:32] in your hand the Bible says there's
[1:45:34] death and life in the power of the
[1:45:36] tongue we talk about how that can be
[1:45:39] gossiping or saying bad things about
[1:45:41] people but what it can be is is giving
[1:45:44] out forgiveness giving out praise and
[1:45:48] encouragement praise the Lord Amen you
[1:45:51] guys are pulling and I could just keep

[1:46:28] it to their remembrance Lord they could
