[13:46] across
[13:48] me
[13:49] the world behind me
[13:53] across before me
[13:57] the world behind me
[14:03] [Music]
[14:13] behind me
[14:27] the world behind
[14:30] [Music]
[14:39] hallelujah aren't you glad you can make
[14:41] that your testimony today amen
[14:45] the whole world my brother and sister
[14:48] it's become so common in the world today
[14:51] to people take a stand
[14:54] and then it's completely acceptable to
[14:56] back up from that
[14:59] look at
[15:00] everything about us
[15:02] our governments politicians
[15:04] great men that were applauded
[15:08] and then they lower their standard and
[15:09] the world says yep that's normal
[15:12] but as sons and daughters of god
[15:15] we have a testimony
[15:17] no
[15:18] turning back
[15:19] amen thank you thank you lord let's
[15:23] remember our brother bob sister joanne
[15:27] that just
[15:28] you know his age
[15:30] creeps up on all of us
[15:34] you know it's it's just uh something we
[15:36] have to face so let's just never forget
[15:40] to uh lift them up in prayer amen
[15:44] and uh i think our brother tim sister
[15:46] miriam today or in eastern idaho or
[15:49] something a little holiday or something
[15:51] as far as i know
[15:53] they didn't ask permission so i don't
[15:55] know what they're doing
[15:57] so anyway no i i believe they're on a
[16:00] little holiday together so
[16:02] and uh brother prashant sister concha i
[16:05] believe this is the weekend they're
[16:07] actually meeting together with some
[16:09] other saints that we know down there
[16:12] in that area and i think just a little
[16:15] time they're going to be having church
[16:17] together and i think that's wonderful
[16:20] you see the
[16:22] lord has an ability
[16:24] to
[16:25] put you somewhere
[16:27] and
[16:28] just accidentally right
[16:32] and so there it is that the footsteps
[16:36] of the righteous
[16:38] whatever word you want to use you hear
[16:40] it quoted both ways are ordered or
[16:42] ordained
[16:44] of god
[16:45] and so
[16:47] while we still lift them up today amen
[16:49] may they
[16:50] be able to share
[16:52] uh the light of the gospel in their life
[16:55] with those around them
[16:57] and uh just to uh
[16:59] just become
[17:00] a a you know brother brown talks about
[17:02] this oral roberts would would be able to
[17:06] speak out in the radio and tell the
[17:08] people
[17:09] lay your hand on your radio
[17:12] lay your hand on the television whatever
[17:14] and let that become a point of contact
[17:17] and you know it's interesting that we as
[17:19] humans we we need
[17:22] the truth of it is we need a point of
[17:23] contact
[17:25] we were not meant to just kind of
[17:28] uh
[17:28] float from pillar to post to just kind
[17:32] of aimlessly attach ourselves to this or
[17:34] that but god wanted us to come
[17:37] and by god's grace amen the word being
[17:40] opened to us today it's not our church
[17:43] amen it's not a certain ministry but
[17:45] it's christ himself has become our point
[17:49] and
[17:50] so i say that to say
[17:52] uh i know
[17:53] the saints that they're meeting with
[17:56] have a heart's desire just like us
[17:58] and brother prashant sister kancha of
[18:01] course is a part of this body we'll
[18:02] never let them go no matter where they
[18:04] go but that part of this body you know
[18:06] it just may they all come together to be
[18:08] a point of contact and
[18:10] amen i don't remember did you remember
[18:13] brother manasseh this morning he was
[18:15] just on my heart today
[18:17] seems like most sunday mornings he comes
[18:19] on my heart so it's pretty funny you
[18:22] know sister sophie i was telling you or
[18:24] asking i should say
[18:25] please you know respond to him i walked
[18:28] out of the service last sunday did he
[18:30] share this with you sister and um i have
[18:32] a message on my phone
[18:35] and so you know that happened quite
[18:37] quickly i guess but anyway it was just
[18:39] good i i missed that by just a moment
[18:42] let's stand as we go to the word brother
[18:43] joseph amen precious our sisters god
[18:47] bless you today
[18:49] as you're
[18:50] here with us just a group of believers
[18:52] amen we're all here together i want to
[18:56] bring to you um
[18:58] once again on the subject of obedience
[19:01] uh the two sides of obedience and my
[19:04] thought today the topic would be
[19:06] obedience brings submission
[19:09] see oftentimes we turn that around and
[19:11] think okay we have to submit to be
[19:13] obedient
[19:15] but you see my brother and sister we can
[19:17] actually as i spoke a few words to you
[19:19] the other day we actually can have a
[19:22] rebellious submission
[19:28] but when we come under obedience to the
[19:31] word
[19:33] submission
[19:34] follows
[19:37] and of course i always skip over my
[19:38] notes brother gill sister karen
[19:41] god bless you i enjoyed our fellowship
[19:43] and uh
[19:45] hopefully lord willing we can squeeze a
[19:46] moment from your family here and sit
[19:48] down again and visit
[19:50] amen but you see when when we try to
[19:53] just simply submit
[19:55] we're still struggling against all of
[19:57] the influences around us but when we
[20:00] come into full obedience to the word of
[20:02] god
[20:03] submission now this might sound a little
[20:06] direct and i'm not shooting arrows that
[20:08] no no one don't misunderstand
[20:10] but many people say i believe this
[20:12] message
[20:16] and they don't follow it
[20:19] as i've got older i tend to
[20:22] get a little more
[20:24] oh i don't know impatient
[20:27] i don't sound good does it
[20:30] a little less tolerant
[20:33] of people saying oh praise god god sent
[20:36] a prophet we can all say amen to that
[20:37] can't we
[20:39] i believe this message then they just go
[20:42] and do whatever they want to do
[20:44] i'm sorry i don't believe them any
[20:45] longer
[20:47] now does that mean that they're lost or
[20:48] i've thrown them out absolutely not
[20:51] but you see
[20:53] you have to come in to obedience
[20:56] now this is not we are we are not a
[20:58] denomination we are not here with some
[21:00] kind of conformity
[21:02] as as the token of our our uh uh belief
[21:06] or you know that we are
[21:08] faithful because we conformed you see we
[21:11] can just leave that you know see brother
[21:14] paul preached very much about y'all to
[21:15] this and y'all to that because honestly
[21:17] i believe from all of my heart when we
[21:19] get in the word and the word gets in us
[21:21] it just happens
[21:23] so we don't have to have a whip here and
[21:25] we don't have to beat you and we don't
[21:27] have to shame you and we don't have to
[21:29] do these things because when the word
[21:31] comes alive
[21:34] something happens
[21:36] and thank you lord that it's without us
[21:40] and our
[21:41] uh our ability that god says you know
[21:45] what
[21:46] they said amen to my word
[21:48] now you know sometimes people say well i
[21:50] acknowledge that god sent a prophet and
[21:52] i believe every word he said but they
[21:53] never say amen to the word
[21:57] you have to wonder
[21:58] are they fully submitted
[22:01] because sonic can tell you saints
[22:04] once they left goshen
[22:06] they believed that moses was sent to
[22:09] deliver them
[22:10] by the time they got to the red sea
[22:13] they had determined that moses was there
[22:16] to kill them
[22:20] yeah
[22:22] well praise the lord
[22:28] titus the third chapter
[22:30] let's start with the first verse
[22:33] so once again i want to just speak to
[22:35] you on obedience
[22:36] brings submission
[22:41] titus 3 1-8
[22:44] now as the apostle paul is speaking
[22:46] sending this letter to titus
[22:48] my brother and sister we can interpret
[22:50] this
[22:51] many different ways
[22:53] but what we have to know
[22:55] and we do know is the very fact that
[22:58] paul's life was completely sold out to
[23:01] the gospel of jesus christ
[23:04] paul did not build a tabernacle put his
[23:06] name on top of it demand everybody you
[23:09] know as it were bower catered to him but
[23:12] many times he come from place to place
[23:16] and was in conflict with the ministry
[23:18] that was there
[23:20] you know how difficult that would be to
[23:22] get up and be the man
[23:24] now if you were narcissistic
[23:27] if you were overbearing egotistical you
[23:30] could easily stand in front of people
[23:32] and say
[23:33] i pull
[23:35] an apostle of jesus christ
[23:38] listen to me
[23:39] he said words
[23:42] some heard it that way
[23:44] but what he was really saying is
[23:46] i'm here simply as a representative of
[23:48] jesus christ
[23:50] and if you'll listen this word will
[23:53] change your life
[23:56] but some saw him as a domineering man
[23:59] but we serve if you'll follow me now we
[24:03] serve a domineering god
[24:08] oh some would be like what
[24:11] yes we are
[24:13] i am the way
[24:16] the truth
[24:17] and the life
[24:19] there will be
[24:20] no
[24:21] other gods
[24:23] before me
[24:25] so god made some demands on us saints
[24:28] amen
[24:30] put them in mind to be subject to
[24:33] principalities and powers to obey
[24:35] magistrates and to be ready to every
[24:38] good work
[24:39] and to speak evil of no man i say god
[24:41] help us
[24:43] to be no brawlers but gentle showing all
[24:45] meekness unto all men
[24:47] for we ourselves also were sometimes
[24:50] foolish and paul says amen
[24:53] disobedient and paul says amen deceit
[24:57] and paul said amen and serving divers
[24:59] lost in pleasures and paul has to say
[25:02] amen living in malice and envy and
[25:04] hateful and hating one another but you
[25:07] know saints the reason i believe that
[25:09] god a long time ago laid on my heart
[25:11] this word but
[25:14] isn't that incredible i like the word
[25:17] but
[25:18] because while i was once all that paul
[25:21] spoke here to titus
[25:23] but
[25:26] after that the kindness and love of our
[25:29] god of god our savior toward man
[25:32] appeared not by works of righteousness
[25:35] which we have done but according to his
[25:37] mercy he saved us by the washing of
[25:40] regeneration and renewing of the holy
[25:43] ghost which he shed on us abundantly
[25:47] through jesus christ our savior my
[25:49] brother and sister not just enough to
[25:51] save you from the wickedness of this
[25:53] world
[25:54] but he poured it out abundantly through
[25:57] our lord jesus christ and abundance
[25:59] means there's more than we could
[26:01] possibly ever consume
[26:04] heavenly father we ask for your guidance
[26:06] today lord
[26:08] we just want to speak words lord today
[26:10] that would be beneficial to your people
[26:12] father bringing us closer to you washing
[26:15] us by the water of the word
[26:17] we ask you father now in the name of
[26:18] jesus christ amen you may be seated
[26:22] saints
[26:33] now the apostle paul was writing
[26:36] to titus as an elder and as a brother
[26:39] he was not trying to bring titus under
[26:43] his influence as you might say a servant
[26:46] or whatever but just looking at that and
[26:49] sharing knowing that this now my brother
[26:52] and sister we might preach on patmos
[26:54] just a little bit uh maybe when we get
[26:56] back from arizona but um my brother and
[26:59] sister if we could just grasp what paul
[27:01] experienced
[27:02] when he was on the isle of patmos what
[27:04] paul experienced i mean john uh when
[27:07] when uh he was there on the isle of
[27:09] patmos and so in that it put him in such
[27:12] a place that he was now looking at the
[27:15] word of god an entirely different view
[27:16] than ever now paul was on the back side
[27:19] of the desert i had my my characters
[27:21] turned around here but this will be fine
[27:22] it's the same point when when paul was
[27:25] on the backside of the desert he went
[27:26] through that experience there my brother
[27:28] and sister he never looked at the gospel
[27:31] of jesus christ the same way and so that
[27:33] is why we need a back side of the desert
[27:36] or we need a patmos experience so that
[27:39] we will not look at the word of god just
[27:41] as the status quo but we would have an
[27:44] entirely different view amen the prophet
[27:47] of god told us that when the bible was
[27:49] revealed to us just paraphrasing this
[27:51] that it would become a whole new book
[27:54] when revelation come in our life it
[27:56] would become a whole new book to us and
[28:00] so in that we would then see the bible
[28:02] completely different than we did as just
[28:05] a carnal man with a religious spirit so
[28:08] you would find my brother and sister as
[28:10] as paul is um writing to titus he he's
[28:15] he's laying this out in such a way to
[28:18] encourage titus to teach the people to
[28:21] uh to speak the truth as it were and to
[28:24] break it down now my brother and sister
[28:26] we know that god deals in simplicity it
[28:29] is typically you might say uh
[28:31] uh it is mostly satan's influence to
[28:34] take things in an intellectual fashion
[28:36] but yet you know if you are a highly
[28:39] intelligent person amen uh don't don't
[28:42] feel like that you have some kind of uh
[28:45] uh
[28:47] hurdle to jump over because you see
[28:49] whether we are intellectual or just
[28:51] completely the base or simplest person
[28:54] on earth it still comes down to
[28:56] submission it still comes down to the
[28:58] yielding to the leadership of the holy
[29:00] ghost and so you know some people are
[29:02] like well i have a disadvantage now i
[29:05] have spoke this many times to our
[29:06] brother christian uh and i can say this
[29:09] in in humor and whatnot here today
[29:12] i've spoken to him many times you know
[29:14] christian one of the things i think is
[29:17] as a struggle for you as you're just too
[29:19] smart for your own good
[29:23] so on thanksgiving day i'm sharing that
[29:25] with your boys
[29:27] and all three of them said it's a
[29:29] problem
[29:32] now my brother and sister the word of
[29:34] god is just as effective though when the
[29:36] seed is there
[29:38] to those that mind
[29:40] is in another element as it is to those
[29:43] that are the ignorant and unlearned
[29:46] it all comes down to something within
[29:48] the soul saying i will submit to the
[29:50] word of god
[29:51] amen so you know i never say his name
[29:54] correctly but uh my brother strokoff is
[29:58] how it
[30:00] okay i wrote a book
[30:03] amen my brother wrote a book my brother
[30:05] and sister i don't know if you guys have
[30:06] ever seen that book i made it about
[30:09] halfway through it but really it was
[30:10] like reading about 40 books because i
[30:13] needed you know an oxford dictionary and
[30:15] a webster dictionary and i needed a new
[30:18] whatever they call it dictionary because
[30:20] he used words
[30:22] i never even heard of before
[30:24] so i'm in the dictionary okay that is
[30:26] spelled
[30:28] okay i got the right word
[30:31] book
[30:33] to a different element
[30:36] he wrote that
[30:37] as a judgment to the intellectual
[30:41] that was like
[30:42] this gospel is too simple it's too
[30:44] whatever i mean this is ridiculous so
[30:47] what it is you find that when you look
[30:49] in the dictionary many times uh people
[30:51] use words right that we we don't
[30:53] normally use
[30:55] and you look it up
[30:57] and it's interesting because you see
[30:59] their word has something corresponding
[31:01] in the simplicity
[31:05] but that is where their mind
[31:07] is at
[31:10] paul is preaching
[31:11] speaking to titus
[31:13] he's telling them teach the people
[31:15] encourage the people
[31:17] and we want to put in place guidelines
[31:21] as it were now remember my brother and
[31:23] sister guidelines are not fences
[31:26] guidelines are not a prison
[31:28] guidelines are encouragement that you
[31:30] stay and walk in this path
[31:35] guidelines
[31:37] to a fruitful christian life
[31:40] and as we look at this my brother and
[31:42] sister you think about this
[31:45] put them in mind
[31:47] to be subject to principalities and
[31:49] powers to obey the magistrates to be
[31:51] ready for it to to every good work to
[31:54] speak evil of no man to be no brawlers
[31:56] but gentle showing all meekness into all
[31:59] men for we ourselves also were sometimes
[32:01] foolish and disobedient deceived serving
[32:03] divers lusts and pleasures living in
[32:05] malice and envy hateful hating one
[32:08] another he was giving this guideline to
[32:10] them that they could see if i can step
[32:13] away from what i'm going to call the
[32:15] basic element of humanity the basic
[32:18] behavior of humanity step away from that
[32:23] find deliverance from the basics of
[32:25] humanity of what your natural carnal man
[32:28] would respond to and how that you would
[32:30] react when someone would insult you or
[32:33] speak ill of you and step away from that
[32:38] and in that you will find a fruitful
[32:40] christian life because those things will
[32:43] no longer then have control of your mind
[32:45] in your flesh
[32:49] as we would see this we recognize
[32:53] my brother and sister now to be put in
[32:55] mind subject to principalities and
[32:57] powers
[32:59] lester be any misunderstanding i want to
[33:01] say this
[33:02] we're not speaking of following ungodly
[33:05] rules that serve man's wicked plans
[33:08] prophet of god said when we come to
[33:10] these places in our life it was
[33:12] mentioned here the other day of a
[33:14] situation where a wife was like my
[33:17] husband this and this and this and and
[33:19] he he wants me to to do this and he
[33:22] wants me to cut my hair and she's asking
[33:25] a pastor who has a friend of mine what
[33:27] do i do
[33:29] because he throws the scripture
[33:33] a wife
[33:34] should be subject to her husband
[33:39] totally the devil misinterprets the
[33:41] scripture at will
[33:44] he twists it any way he thinks it works
[33:46] for him
[33:48] and the brother he said you know brother
[33:49] paul this is what i shared with her and
[33:51] he wasn't really saying what do you
[33:52] think of what i shared but you know just
[33:54] as ministers would it's like you know
[33:56] maybe i missed something or did i not
[33:58] elaborate or whatever and i thought
[34:00] brother your answer was spot on that
[34:02] she's not subject to an ungodly spirit
[34:05] she has submitted to the holy ghost
[34:08] and that is the highest place that we as
[34:11] humans can come is submitted to the holy
[34:14] ghost now my brother and sister as it is
[34:16] in the natural a wife the scripture says
[34:19] she has submitted to her husband but
[34:21] that's not to be turned into a doormat
[34:24] or a dishrag that is for a man to be
[34:26] godly that is for man to be
[34:29] the correct leadership and a wife to
[34:31] follow that
[34:33] but you see the devil comes and he tries
[34:35] to twist these things around and so it's
[34:38] there when we're talking about the
[34:40] ungodly rules
[34:42] as it were of mankind
[34:46] this is not telling you to be subject
[34:50] to their ungodly rules
[34:54] remember we should always strive for
[34:56] balance in our life
[34:58] is that not right
[35:00] every time i think of balance i think of
[35:01] brother george
[35:03] and the fact that he reminds me that our
[35:05] pulpit's not balanced
[35:07] and um you know he says we lean just a
[35:10] little bit to the right
[35:13] and i don't know leaning a bit to the
[35:14] right i think that's positive
[35:18] better than leaning to the left
[35:21] but you see my brother and sister how
[35:23] important it is to follow
[35:26] that balance of the holy spirit and i
[35:29] say this is a positive statement that i
[35:32] believe with all of my heart and i'll
[35:34] read a little something to you after a
[35:35] while uh that in my mind gives a license
[35:39] to express things in that fashion now
[35:42] you look at this my brother and sister
[35:44] when the holy ghost when we truly have
[35:46] the holy ghost without any kind of
[35:48] encumbrance
[35:49] do you understand what i mean
[35:54] it automatically brings balance in our
[35:56] life
[35:57] now an encumbrance would be
[36:00] this is what the word says this is what
[36:03] the prophet preached but this is what my
[36:06] church believes
[36:08] you're encumbered
[36:10] you'll never find true balance
[36:12] because you'll constantly be looking to
[36:15] what the church or the preacher says
[36:19] but when we have the holy ghost and
[36:20] we're in the word and become one with
[36:22] the word it will automatically balance
[36:25] us
[36:26] amen now you look at that and realize my
[36:29] brother and sister that even then when
[36:32] something says it's balanced you should
[36:34] double check it
[36:36] right the prophet of god said take
[36:38] everything back to the word
[36:41] so you've say i've got the holy ghost i
[36:44] believe this i'm balanced
[36:45] just double check that by taking it back
[36:48] to the word i had a friend that was a
[36:50] finnish carpenter of the highest
[36:53] talent or degree that i ever knew and he
[36:55] used three levels
[36:59] now stabilize a company that makes
[37:02] nice good quality levels he had a
[37:04] stabila
[37:05] and he had a couple other brands and he
[37:08] started out with the rough one
[37:11] which that was the level that just got
[37:12] everything close
[37:14] and he knew he could trust it but but
[37:16] when he got down because he used to
[37:18] build these arches in these big houses
[37:21] that would be 20 feet tall would take
[37:23] him weeks to finish
[37:25] and he wanted everything it was just him
[37:27] he was driven by this desire for
[37:30] perfection
[37:32] and he wanted to be able to take the
[37:33] rosette on this side and the rosette on
[37:36] that side and they would be exactly to
[37:39] the 64th of an inch
[37:41] the same and that's when i realized that
[37:43] would never be a finished carpenter
[37:52] you see
[37:55] we should always strive for that balance
[37:58] not a close enough balance
[38:01] but that balance
[38:03] that only the holy ghost can bring
[38:06] now my brother and sister it is within
[38:08] the human element the prophet of god
[38:10] talks about you know one might say he's
[38:12] coming on a white horse and some would
[38:14] say he's coming on a cloud and the
[38:16] prophet says these words he says as long
[38:18] as you agree that he's coming
[38:21] so he's not trying to set a doctrine but
[38:24] he's putting an idea in our mind that
[38:26] just because you and i and brother you
[38:30] know david brother chris whatever sees
[38:32] the message in some slightly different
[38:36] fashion
[38:39] see now this is where it gets tricky
[38:42] this slight fashion
[38:45] might be as a pastor i would say
[38:47] brothers every one of you should be
[38:49] wearing a tie to church
[38:51] can i hear an amen
[38:54] see
[38:56] the minister might believe it's
[38:58] important
[39:00] but maybe you don't feel that way does
[39:02] that make you not a christian
[39:04] does it make you going to miss the
[39:05] rapture
[39:07] so there can be little differences of
[39:09] how we see now those that believe in
[39:11] wearing a tiger church would say the
[39:13] prophet of god said where your best
[39:19] what is the best
[39:23] see we can take that out of balance
[39:26] i've got to go here i've got to go there
[39:28] i've i need you know a 25 000 silk suit
[39:32] because i'm supposed to wear the best
[39:35] but you see really what he was saying
[39:38] was don't come to church shabby
[39:41] don't come to church disrespectful don't
[39:43] come to church as though it's no
[39:45] different
[39:46] than a local high school ball game
[39:51] come showing that you as a son or
[39:54] daughter of god so respect
[39:57] to god almighty of i i'm coming in your
[40:01] presence lord
[40:05] see the spirit of the age that we live
[40:06] in preachers are now up there with pants
[40:08] holes in their knees and sneakers and
[40:11] tie-dyed t-shirts and dangles around
[40:14] their wrists
[40:16] on why we're sharing our own opinion
[40:20] sisters
[40:22] i won't judge him
[40:24] but don't let this spirit of 25
[40:27] bracelets
[40:29] get on you
[40:31] that's the spirit of the world
[40:34] amen
[40:38] no we're not going to have somebody
[40:39] inspect you on the way in
[40:42] we just want you
[40:44] to inspect yourself
[40:48] now you see my brother and sister
[40:49] sometimes disagreeing
[40:52] uh
[40:55] let's just put it this way let's be
[40:57] careful that disagreeing does not become
[41:00] disregarding
[41:03] are you with me this morning
[41:06] you see
[41:09] when we
[41:10] disagree
[41:14] my lovely granddaughter
[41:16] gabriella
[41:20] if she was here today i don't know pull
[41:22] your sleeves up sweetie
[41:24] nope she's not gonna cooperate
[41:28] now i'm just gonna say if she's wearing
[41:30] two or three bracelets
[41:33] and i would say you know what i i don't
[41:35] like that
[41:36] as your adopted grandfather i don't like
[41:39] that
[41:41] but you see my brother and sister
[41:44] because we would disagree
[41:47] i would hope
[41:50] that she wouldn't disregard
[41:52] what i preach
[41:56] by disagreeing it'd be easy to say i'm
[41:58] no longer listening
[42:00] to brother paul
[42:04] so we have to be careful that our
[42:06] disagreeing doesn't
[42:09] become disregarding
[42:12] because when you study this out you will
[42:14] find that disregarding the word is the
[42:16] same as just declaring i don't believe
[42:18] it
[42:19] it is disbelieving the word of god to
[42:22] say you know i know what the bible says
[42:24] but
[42:29] amen
[42:32] so disregarding the word is the same as
[42:35] dis believing the word
[42:38] brother branham says
[42:39] it was iniquity
[42:42] when we would know to do right but we
[42:44] wouldn't do it it's iniquity to us what
[42:46] are we doing we're disregarding we say
[42:49] well i'm a believer but i'm just not
[42:51] going to do that
[42:52] you're actually not a believer because
[42:54] obedience brings submission
[42:58] so if we believe the word of god we will
[43:01] follow the word without a question
[43:06] now let me just say this this morning
[43:07] saints
[43:08] if this touches any one of your lives i
[43:12] am not condemning
[43:14] i'm coming in the same fashion i believe
[43:16] as the apostle paul put them in mind
[43:20] to be subject but not to principalities
[43:22] and powers i'm saying i want to put you
[43:24] in mind to be subject to the word of god
[43:28] in everything
[43:30] and you know how much this weighs upon
[43:32] each one of us
[43:34] there is no exemption cards this is not
[43:36] the game of life the board game of life
[43:38] it is not the board game of monopoly we
[43:41] do not get to go past go we don't get a
[43:43] free pass we either are aligned with the
[43:46] word of god or
[43:48] we have serious issues
[43:52] see when we disregard
[43:55] we're choosing not to be subject to
[44:01] now how long
[44:03] would a person
[44:04] i know brother gill worked for the
[44:06] caterpillar dealer for a long long time
[44:11] how long does a person survive in a job
[44:16] disregarding the company's policies
[44:20] the manager's direction
[44:23] you don't
[44:25] when you show up when you want to leave
[44:27] when you want to
[44:29] failure to follow the protocol
[44:32] they say we can find someone who will
[44:37] and so we see this in the natural life
[44:40] i've picked on brother gill there
[44:42] because most of us
[44:44] have not worked for how many years
[44:46] brother gill
[44:48] 39 years my memory said 40 but i'm close
[44:52] most of us here haven't worked 40 years
[44:53] for this same exact company
[44:56] that's why i chose you brother gail to
[44:58] make that point you do what they ask you
[45:01] to do
[45:02] and you're compensated for it
[45:05] now my brother and sister people looking
[45:07] in the day and age it's like well i've
[45:08] been a christian i've served the lord
[45:10] and it's been difficult and i've just
[45:12] and they act like there's been no
[45:14] compensation for this
[45:16] but god compensates sons and daughters
[45:18] of god my brother and sister in
[45:20] abundance
[45:22] amen he never come god's not stingy
[45:26] god says you know what i will pour out
[45:28] the blessings of heaven upon you but not
[45:32] if you disregard me
[45:37] o israel
[45:39] i am the lord
[45:41] thy god
[45:42] he was telling them look you guys are
[45:45] forgetting you're letting other things
[45:47] infiltrate in and and other things are
[45:49] becoming gods in your midst and
[45:52] and i want to remind you that i am the
[45:55] lord thy god
[45:57] and so god comes
[45:59] to remind
[46:00] that we would remember that it is not
[46:02] just
[46:04] hearing his word
[46:06] but it is also as the prophet of god
[46:08] said acting upon it
[46:11] now you know there's about a half a
[46:13] dozen ways six seven ways that brother
[46:15] brown talks about the evidence of the
[46:17] holy ghost
[46:18] now here again we'll touch on this in
[46:20] just a little bit you'll see kind of the
[46:22] approach i'm bringing on this
[46:24] my opinion is i like it where he says
[46:27] it's hearing
[46:29] and
[46:30] acting
[46:32] on the word of god
[46:34] see because we can hear it and say sure
[46:36] enough that's the truth but we never
[46:39] apply it or never act upon that then we
[46:41] only regarded what he said to a degree
[46:45] in an intellectual fashion to say i
[46:47] believe that's the truth but never
[46:49] implementing it in our life
[46:52] you remember the story brother brown
[46:53] tells about the grandmother she's
[46:55] starving and i don't remember right off
[46:57] top my head here it's been a while since
[46:59] i read that but you know she's she's
[47:01] starving there and you know somebody
[47:03] comes to check on her uh and uh they're
[47:06] asking oh i got a son he's over here
[47:09] in this place and he sends me these
[47:11] lovely letters with these lovely
[47:13] pictures
[47:14] and as the individual is looking at this
[47:16] he is realizing what she's being sent is
[47:19] money orders from another country and
[47:22] literally in her bible there was
[47:24] thousands upon thousands of dollars to
[47:27] take for her care but because she didn't
[47:29] comprehend let me put this as revelation
[47:31] she had no revelation to her it was
[47:34] something a beautiful gift without
[47:36] authority behind it and when she had
[47:40] realization of what really was in her
[47:42] hands
[47:43] her dire situation was over
[47:47] now in this case we might say because
[47:49] she was
[47:50] elder
[47:51] maybe come from a time and a place was
[47:53] not familiar with
[47:56] but you see the moment that's the point
[47:57] i want to make the moment it was
[47:59] revealed to her those were the same as
[48:02] money if she starved one more day it was
[48:04] not her son's fault it was hers
[48:10] the word of god says there come a day
[48:12] that god will no longer wink at our
[48:14] ignorance
[48:16] so there'll be no excuse on that day to
[48:18] say hey i just didn't know
[48:22] because you see he shed upon us
[48:23] abundantly
[48:26] so i
[48:28] i would say in disregarding the word
[48:32] that is choosing not to be subject to
[48:34] the word and
[48:35] we cannot say that we are obedient to
[48:37] the word saints without submitting to
[48:39] the word
[48:40] when we hear that
[48:42] now you know what this might sound
[48:44] simple to you i'm not tooting my horn
[48:46] but this might sound simple to you that
[48:48] my brother and sister if you can hear
[48:50] this in the vein that i studied this in
[48:53] and what god spoke to my heart you will
[48:55] realize that it's not this that we can
[48:57] set to this side it's not that we can
[49:00] set to this side and we can still be
[49:02] believers and everything will be all
[49:04] right my brother and sister just as it
[49:06] is i hope this doesn't offend no one but
[49:08] the word of god says to take communion
[49:11] until he is coming and we disregard it
[49:18] now might be a little direct to some of
[49:19] you but maybe it needs to be a little
[49:21] direct
[49:22] but you see we're not subject to the
[49:24] word when we set certain parts of the
[49:26] word apart
[49:31] now as we would look at this
[49:34] i want to just
[49:36] go into now
[49:38] flashing red light of his coming
[49:40] now there are some very direct things
[49:42] now those of you are already reading
[49:44] ahead naughty naughty naughty
[49:47] but there are some things that brother
[49:48] branham has in this quote here
[49:51] that
[49:52] i i don't want you to take it too
[49:54] extreme in one direction but i want you
[49:56] to be struck by the bluntness of this
[50:02] here some time ago in los angeles i was
[50:04] waiting or was out at the campgrounds i
[50:06] was riding up the road and a little lady
[50:09] a pretty little girl
[50:11] very pretty
[50:13] was going up the road and i thought she
[50:15] must be going to a show she had on a
[50:18] little frontier close
[50:20] just about six or eight inches wide
[50:24] across
[50:25] the front of her
[50:33] very vivid really
[50:35] when you read this pretty vivid
[50:38] and a little three or four inch fringe
[50:40] hanging
[50:42] and up high on her body a little spot
[50:44] just about enough that you could wad up
[50:46] and shut every bit of it up in your fist
[50:48] hanging across her this way with a
[50:51] cowboy hat on
[50:52] and a pair of boots with tassels on them
[50:55] and a very attractive i could see where
[50:58] any young man would slide breaks and
[51:00] everything to stop to her
[51:03] going twisting up the road pretty vivid
[51:06] is it not saints
[51:09] prophet of god didn't spare it
[51:11] he didn't say well like there was this
[51:12] little girl and she wasn't dressed very
[51:14] good he is given a vivid image
[51:17] and it ought to be so
[51:20] it ought to be so that we have a vivid
[51:22] image my brother and sister to realize
[51:24] that when we make an effort to cover
[51:26] ourselves up but reveal ourselves in a
[51:28] certain way
[51:32] oh can i just be bold today hope this
[51:34] doesn't offend anybody
[51:37] we wear long sleeves
[51:40] and ties as men
[51:43] and our wives wear cut out shirts
[51:47] we wear skirts to the floor but we cut
[51:50] them
[51:53] well so i can walk in it
[51:56] find something you can walk in
[51:59] you see those kind of things my brother
[52:01] and sister look at the age we're living
[52:02] in we wear
[52:07] see-through clothes
[52:09] with something under it
[52:14] don't you understand saints
[52:17] the attraction
[52:19] to the carnal man
[52:21] is to see what he can see through the
[52:23] see through
[52:29] i hope you all still love me i'm
[52:32] compelled to tell the truth
[52:34] we get a little further in this quote
[52:35] you'll see why i'm compelled to tell the
[52:37] truth
[52:38] let's judge why
[52:40] look i'll tell you this morning i'm
[52:42] telling the wife i don't need to wear an
[52:44] undershirt under this dress shirt i'll
[52:45] be fine and i'm i'll just say this not
[52:48] to lift us up but i say this my wife
[52:50] holds a shirt up in front of my face
[52:52] with her hand behind it
[52:56] okay i'm wearing an undershirt
[53:01] we need to be mindful of these things
[53:03] saints
[53:05] i'm covered up
[53:07] but i'm visible to the world
[53:10] that's not what the holy ghost is about
[53:12] my brother and sister the blood of jesus
[53:14] christ wanted to cover us so completely
[53:17] that you can't see the world
[53:22] am i getting to be a legalist no i just
[53:24] love you
[53:29] very tactical i see where any young man
[53:31] would slide breaks and everything to
[53:33] stop to her going twisting up the road
[53:35] and i was fixing to turn to the
[53:37] campground and i went upwards to the
[53:39] campground
[53:40] and i started to turn around to go back
[53:44] i thought i'd stop and say young lady i
[53:46] wish to speak to you in the name of our
[53:48] lord jesus christ though you be a pretty
[53:50] girl there is no doubt about that though
[53:53] you have a figure that would anyway
[53:57] probably you you want to hear the breaks
[53:59] whine do you realize
[54:02] do you realize
[54:04] can i say it again do you realize
[54:07] that's the spirit that's making you do
[54:09] that will drive you to a devil's hell
[54:11] where you'll suffer through the ages
[54:13] that is to come do you realize
[54:16] that pretty little formed body
[54:20] look the prophet of god is not mincing
[54:23] any words here saints
[54:26] that pretty little form body and them
[54:28] well set cheeks and hair and red lips
[54:31] and maybe in another six months the
[54:33] worms will be crawling in and out of
[54:35] that well-formed body out there in the
[54:37] dust and that soul that stays in there a
[54:40] day will be and a devil's torment and
[54:43] then something stopped me as if god
[54:45] would say if you do that they'll lock
[54:47] you up down lock you down yonder in jail
[54:50] see there you are i hope i'm you're not
[54:53] taking this too bad this morning
[54:55] amen
[54:57] come on saints
[54:59] i've told you enough times i love you
[55:01] and i'm not lying to you
[55:03] there's no amount of money
[55:05] there's no amount of prestige there's no
[55:07] amount of nothing to cause me to lie to
[55:09] you
[55:12] and if you don't believe it by now i'd
[55:14] never be able to convince you
[55:16] then i seen billy come out in motion it
[55:18] was time to come and i hear them singing
[55:20] only believe oh my
[55:22] how can people be bewitched in such
[55:25] stuff as that
[55:27] is because
[55:29] they disregard
[55:32] come on it's because they disregard the
[55:36] word of god
[55:39] whoa
[55:41] that's right
[55:43] yes sir
[55:48] another thing as ministers behind the
[55:50] platform who is associated in these
[55:52] organizations who read that and know it
[55:54] or forbidden to say anything about it
[55:56] because they'll drive their church
[55:58] congregation away from them then
[56:01] and the churches are looking for members
[56:07] anybody see the but that's coming
[56:10] hallelujah
[56:11] oh hallelujah
[56:14] but god is looking for born again saints
[56:16] of the living god that will shine as the
[56:19] stars
[56:21] oh my brother and sister let me read
[56:22] that again amen the churches are looking
[56:25] for members but god is looking for born
[56:29] again saints of the living god
[56:31] amen what we're not gonna be some bright
[56:34] shining glitzy thing out here dressed to
[56:37] the nines to just fit to the world we're
[56:39] gonna be such that we present ourselves
[56:42] as sons and daughters of god
[56:47] oh god help us be honest and tell the
[56:49] truth what jesus christ said but that's
[56:52] the day we're living in
[56:54] that's the signs that jesus said would
[56:55] be and we see it right before us
[56:58] now look these are pretty strong words
[57:00] today saints
[57:02] it would have been much simpler to
[57:03] preach to you today
[57:05] for me and maybe for you also oh praise
[57:08] the lord we heard the message we're all
[57:10] going in a rapture
[57:16] and we would all said amen and would
[57:18] have went home
[57:19] and nothing
[57:21] nothing
[57:22] would have changed
[57:26] but would that line us up to the word
[57:29] because i'll tell you what this flesh
[57:31] as much as you have the holy ghost this
[57:33] flesh
[57:35] wars against
[57:37] wars against
[57:39] the word of god
[57:41] that's why even jesus and we'll touch on
[57:43] this if we get to it even jesus
[57:46] had to learn obedience by suffering
[57:50] why did he do it forcing himself because
[57:52] he was an unbeliever no my brother and
[57:54] sister he endured that to show you and i
[57:57] that the holy ghost in us can live
[58:00] through anything this world has to offer
[58:05] my oh my
[58:16] now look at this
[58:18] the greatest battle ever fought we'll
[58:20] just skip over a couple of my notes here
[58:21] there's a time where does it go
[58:25] eve could not sin
[58:28] until she laid aside god's word
[58:32] in other words until
[58:34] she decided that she would disregard it
[58:39] so when she come to the place she said
[58:40] you know what i don't believe that
[58:42] applies to me
[58:44] i have a greater revelation
[58:47] i have the holy ghost
[58:49] you don't know what god's doing for me
[58:53] well i know what his word does
[58:55] amen
[58:57] hallelujah you know there's just certain
[58:59] things that you can are very predictable
[59:02] in life
[59:03] amen you can pour two different
[59:05] ingredients together add different
[59:07] ingredients um you know i think probably
[59:09] every uh young man young woman
[59:12] sisters whatever that's ever done a lot
[59:14] of baking knows that you know there's
[59:16] quite a bit of difference between baking
[59:18] powder and baking soda
[59:22] but you know they'll they'll work you
[59:24] know that
[59:25] i know that for a fact i made biscuits
[59:27] one time
[59:29] kind of a few years ago or did i say
[59:30] decades
[59:33] i put the wrong one in there
[59:35] and you know if you put enough butter on
[59:38] a brick you can eat it
[59:43] but you see with the right ingredients
[59:44] you can have something nice and light
[59:46] and fluffy
[59:47] that all of your friends are like that
[59:50] is so good
[59:52] i ate some of those recently
[59:58] eve could not sin until she laid aside
[1:00:00] god's word opening up her channel of
[1:00:02] reasons through her soul to begin to
[1:00:04] reason why certainly my husband has
[1:00:06] never told me these things
[1:00:08] now my brother and sister we as a church
[1:00:10] our husband
[1:00:12] is not john smith or whatever it is
[1:00:15] the lord jesus christ
[1:00:18] and the reason the lord jesus christ
[1:00:20] going to make sure
[1:00:22] you see oh we could get into all this
[1:00:24] but you already know it the first adam
[1:00:26] second adam first eve second eve my
[1:00:28] brother and sister the prophet of god
[1:00:30] goes into detail there how it will come
[1:00:33] down that while they were found in that
[1:00:36] condition
[1:00:38] they'll be
[1:00:40] a bride
[1:00:42] that comes
[1:00:44] that has not been found with another
[1:00:47] she will be
[1:00:49] a word
[1:00:50] virgin
[1:00:52] bride
[1:00:55] my husband never told me these things
[1:00:56] but i believe that you he told me i
[1:00:58] shouldn't do this but you know you make
[1:01:00] it so real and so plain i believe it
[1:01:02] would be wonderful because you're making
[1:01:04] it so plain to me
[1:01:06] i remember an individual once telling me
[1:01:08] that it's like yes sir
[1:01:11] we are in the millennium
[1:01:13] my pastor
[1:01:15] made it so plain to me
[1:01:19] jesus christ is off the mercy seat
[1:01:23] it's all finished
[1:01:25] we have to be
[1:01:27] in the millennium
[1:01:30] you'd like him to go back through the
[1:01:31] message
[1:01:33] the prophet says
[1:01:35] where is the mercy seat
[1:01:37] in the heart
[1:01:38] of the believer
[1:01:41] god ever be off the mercy seat saints
[1:01:44] no sir
[1:01:45] he will not be off the mercy seat of the
[1:01:48] believer
[1:01:50] the unbeliever the make believer
[1:01:53] the heathen the atheist the agnostic all
[1:01:56] of these yes there'll come a day he's
[1:01:58] off the mercy seat for them but for the
[1:02:00] bride he'll never be from the mercy seat
[1:02:03] so you see what it is is some preacher
[1:02:06] made it so plain he's going to be off
[1:02:08] the mercy seat this is that we must be
[1:02:10] in the millennium you know what happened
[1:02:11] i hate to say this bearer of a bad story
[1:02:13] but my brother and sister their lives
[1:02:15] got sloppy
[1:02:17] got so sloppy that all of a sudden
[1:02:19] adultery started happening in the church
[1:02:21] because we're already in the millennium
[1:02:23] this doesn't matter
[1:02:25] really did god say now when you all get
[1:02:27] to heaven
[1:02:29] pardon me for using this expression but
[1:02:30] when you get to heaven all bets are off
[1:02:32] just go do what you want now
[1:02:35] no sir
[1:02:37] we are of the righteous one
[1:02:39] he's always been righteous he will
[1:02:40] always be righteous righteousness will
[1:02:43] not fall from us just because we have
[1:02:45] taken a rapture righteousness will not
[1:02:48] fall from us because we have revelation
[1:02:51] we are righteous because he is righteous
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:55] hallelujah some of you should act more
[1:02:56] excited
[1:02:59] he told me he shouldn't do this you're
[1:03:01] making it so real i believe it would be
[1:03:03] wonderful because you're making it so
[1:03:04] plain to me see there was the first
[1:03:06] battle and through that battle has
[1:03:08] caused ev every other war and every
[1:03:11] bloodshed that's ever come was caused
[1:03:13] right there at eden she disbelieved
[1:03:15] god's word and if one iota of god's word
[1:03:18] was disbelieved caused all this trouble
[1:03:20] how are we going to get back
[1:03:21] disbelieving the word
[1:03:24] you can't do it got to shut off all
[1:03:26] these other things conscious memories
[1:03:28] reasonings all these other things
[1:03:30] casting down reasonings we don't reason
[1:03:33] about it at all nothing at all
[1:03:36] we just accept the word on the basis god
[1:03:40] said so
[1:03:43] see so we've now went from the
[1:03:44] intellectual as i was sharing there's
[1:03:46] nothing wrong going to be many
[1:03:47] intellectuals make the rapture
[1:03:50] very smart people
[1:03:52] but see where god brings us down
[1:03:54] he's taking it back
[1:03:56] he's down here where paul's at now
[1:04:01] god said it
[1:04:03] i believe it
[1:04:05] can you
[1:04:07] defend the message
[1:04:11] just second
[1:04:15] there's nothing in here says i defend
[1:04:17] the message
[1:04:18] intellectually
[1:04:21] but i defend the message
[1:04:24] in
[1:04:24] simplicity by living
[1:04:27] it
[1:04:28] out
[1:04:30] now how are you going to do that give
[1:04:31] them a time capsule of your life
[1:04:35] no sir you see they have to choose
[1:04:37] themselves
[1:04:38] to accept it on the basis that god said
[1:04:41] so
[1:04:42] but look what brother brown says that
[1:04:43] sets a stream between you and god and
[1:04:45] every channel comes open between you and
[1:04:47] god then there's the battle the very
[1:04:50] first front line let's not use a 22
[1:04:52] rifle let's get an atomic bomb i like
[1:04:55] this
[1:04:56] he thinks like i do
[1:04:58] or i think like he does
[1:05:00] let's not just sit back and say now i'm
[1:05:02] going to give the devil a sip of the
[1:05:04] word every once in a while and maybe
[1:05:06] that'll be enough to poison him
[1:05:08] no sir
[1:05:09] how about we just vaporize him
[1:05:12] i like this i know brother jason would
[1:05:13] like this
[1:05:15] amen thanksgiving evening brother jason
[1:05:17] i made some snide comment about brother
[1:05:20] jason do you think there's enough wood
[1:05:21] on the fire brother jason says nope
[1:05:25] went and got another big arm load we had
[1:05:27] a fire as high as this ceiling saints it
[1:05:29] burnt till two and then there with every
[1:05:31] word of god behind it it blows every
[1:05:33] devil every sickness every disease you
[1:05:35] say is that right brother branham that's
[1:05:37] why it does it on some and not on others
[1:05:41] and that isn't that a struggle my
[1:05:43] brother and sister some people have i've
[1:05:45] dealt with people that they have a real
[1:05:47] struggle of why why is a word affecting
[1:05:50] me like this but it doesn't seem to
[1:05:52] affect them like that my brother and
[1:05:54] sister you're not here to worry about
[1:05:56] them other than praying for their soul
[1:05:58] but we're here as that old guy at the
[1:06:01] funeral the other toy told me our wife
[1:06:04] my wife a godly wife of 65 i think it
[1:06:06] was years is already in glory and now my
[1:06:10] job is to make sure this half gets there
[1:06:13] also
[1:06:14] amen but we're too
[1:06:16] busy guarding this family as it were you
[1:06:20] shouldn't you shouldn't if you did it
[1:06:21] like this if you've done this if you did
[1:06:23] this if you did it like me
[1:06:25] oh my what a wreck
[1:06:27] y'all want to live like paul
[1:06:31] i sure hope i didn't hear any amens
[1:06:35] it's because of the channel
[1:06:37] you can look out and see it but you've
[1:06:39] got to have it in here
[1:06:41] looking this away not out there looking
[1:06:44] in you've got to be in looking out
[1:06:48] and so many times saints the devil wants
[1:06:50] to get us out here looking in and we're
[1:06:54] trying to yep yep yep but what we got to
[1:06:56] do is see what god sees and god's on the
[1:06:58] inside yeah i said that god is in us god
[1:07:02] is on the inside and it is then we start
[1:07:06] looking out then we start looking
[1:07:08] through the eyes of god the devil's on
[1:07:09] the outside he sees all your failures
[1:07:11] all your things all your shortcomings
[1:07:13] all of this and all of that first
[1:07:16] but god's on the inside what does he see
[1:07:18] first your soul
[1:07:20] amen and when we get on the inside we
[1:07:22] start to look in that way as there's my
[1:07:25] soul it never was belonging to the devil
[1:07:27] the title deed has always had the name
[1:07:30] jesus christ on it and the devil
[1:07:32] snatched it but he never got it
[1:07:33] transferred
[1:07:37] you know there's some states like texas
[1:07:39] that record the title to property in
[1:07:42] such a fashion
[1:07:43] that people come in
[1:07:46] with a forged bill of sale
[1:07:49] and they change the title
[1:07:51] into their
[1:07:54] name sit down
[1:07:59] see
[1:08:00] i've got the title lead to you
[1:08:03] you're mine
[1:08:05] but praise the lord states like idaho
[1:08:08] requiring such a process
[1:08:10] that it takes more than some
[1:08:12] simple
[1:08:13] little piece of paper thrown on a desk
[1:08:16] to take the property
[1:08:18] because the state of idaho operates
[1:08:21] on a title deed
[1:08:24] you can look it up saints prophet of god
[1:08:26] preaches on it
[1:08:29] it's real to me because i look at that
[1:08:30] and i say hey i understand that
[1:08:33] it takes an absolute signed and
[1:08:35] notarized and witnessed and proven
[1:08:40] to change the title
[1:08:42] and satan comes and says
[1:08:43] ah there's the thoughts on their mind
[1:08:46] god says got nothing to do with it
[1:08:49] all but they
[1:08:51] nothing to do with it
[1:08:53] what about
[1:08:54] nothing to do with it
[1:08:57] because i've got the title lead to the
[1:08:58] soul
[1:09:00] and the title deed to the soul says
[1:09:01] they're mine
[1:09:03] oh hallelujah somebody ought to be able
[1:09:05] to rejoice today
[1:09:06] amen amen not out here looking in you
[1:09:09] got to be in looking out see you can't
[1:09:11] come through reason you can't come
[1:09:14] through these other things you've got to
[1:09:15] come right down god's channel of it
[1:09:18] right into the soul and how do you do it
[1:09:20] what's the last channel now i'm gonna
[1:09:21] leave your homework for you to look that
[1:09:23] up amen so you can just kind of go
[1:09:26] through that now i want to just remind
[1:09:28] you my brother and sister
[1:09:30] brother branham said here going back
[1:09:32] into a flashing red light i want to
[1:09:35] drive this home to you
[1:09:37] what happened here is the churches
[1:09:41] either through the people or the
[1:09:42] ministry
[1:09:44] disregard
[1:09:47] the word of god
[1:09:49] amen
[1:09:51] i'll ignore this portion
[1:09:58] now look
[1:10:00] just a few more minutes
[1:10:03] satan's desire
[1:10:05] is to unbalance our life
[1:10:06] have you ever noticed that effect in
[1:10:08] your life
[1:10:09] you can get up some morning drink your
[1:10:11] coffee read your bible
[1:10:16] and then when the wheel falls off the
[1:10:18] wagon
[1:10:19] what started out as a beautiful day
[1:10:22] ends up with coffee in your lap
[1:10:25] and it just ruined my day
[1:10:28] the rest of my day was just horrible
[1:10:31] really
[1:10:32] because the devil
[1:10:33] come and went boo
[1:10:36] you see what we've got to do saints has
[1:10:38] realized that
[1:10:39] if satan gets us off balance oh i'm
[1:10:41] guilty of these things i just stand
[1:10:43] before you and confess i'm guilty of
[1:10:45] this
[1:10:46] satan gets us off balance
[1:10:48] and in that mindset
[1:10:50] we approach
[1:10:52] our whole day
[1:10:55] a moment when we should have come before
[1:10:57] the throne of god
[1:10:58] we're walking around a little cloud
[1:11:01] our spirit is disturbed and satan's like
[1:11:05] you know what
[1:11:06] if i
[1:11:08] i could do this seven days a week
[1:11:11] this wasn't so hard
[1:11:13] yeah so they're a christian they believe
[1:11:15] the lord jesus christ the blood all
[1:11:17] these things yes but i can just get them
[1:11:19] off balance
[1:11:22] see when we recognize
[1:11:24] i hope this maybe helps you a little bit
[1:11:26] to understand the depth of what brother
[1:11:28] george is preaching
[1:11:30] when he's talking about balance
[1:11:32] hallelujah we're going along and the
[1:11:35] devil breaks the plank in half
[1:11:37] and we're like oh my we're fixing to
[1:11:40] fall in the crick
[1:11:42] until you realize
[1:11:43] god designed you to walk the straight
[1:11:45] and narrow that you can put one foot
[1:11:49] right in front of the other
[1:11:52] and you don't have to fall off just
[1:11:55] because something went wrong
[1:12:00] submission
[1:12:01] to the word
[1:12:02] will cause you
[1:12:04] to walk on
[1:12:06] water come on
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:10] if god did it once
[1:12:12] then we had to enjoy a song today
[1:12:15] amen god does it once saints he's going
[1:12:18] to do it again and again
[1:12:20] and if you have need you'll walk on
[1:12:22] water
[1:12:23] i like how brother donnie reagan puts it
[1:12:25] he says people are like well okay
[1:12:28] i've got faith mountain move nothing
[1:12:31] happens
[1:12:33] well praise the lord mountain move
[1:12:35] nothing happens
[1:12:37] in some cases on the backside of a
[1:12:39] mountain a little rock rolled down the
[1:12:41] hill
[1:12:43] in other cases god says it's not the
[1:12:45] season
[1:12:47] it's not season for you to be speaking
[1:12:49] to mountains to them to move but if
[1:12:52] you'll still believe that you can speak
[1:12:54] to the mountain when the day comes
[1:12:57] when the time in your life that you
[1:12:59] really need a mountain to move you speak
[1:13:03] to it and it will move
[1:13:07] but we want to practice it kind of in a
[1:13:08] carnal method okay mountain move
[1:13:11] i see i want to tell you i want to prove
[1:13:13] to you guys god's real mountain move
[1:13:17] come on mountain move
[1:13:19] god you said the mountain would move
[1:13:21] backside the mountain rocks are just
[1:13:23] flying off of the mountain
[1:13:25] but they don't know it because they're
[1:13:26] coming to the word
[1:13:28] carnally
[1:13:30] god still will acknowledge
[1:13:33] your son or daughter of god
[1:13:35] but you see
[1:13:36] when you get right down to god's channel
[1:13:39] you get right into the soul
[1:13:41] how do you do it
[1:13:43] brother branham goes on here talking
[1:13:44] about what's the last channel goes on
[1:13:46] talking preaching about faith look it up
[1:13:49] amen you've got to have faith but you
[1:13:50] know what faith does
[1:13:52] faith brings us to the place we don't
[1:13:54] have to prove god
[1:13:56] you know how about we'll cut their ear
[1:13:59] off or we'll cut their arm off and you
[1:14:01] put it back on and then we'll believe
[1:14:05] see that's not what it's about saints
[1:14:08] faith
[1:14:08] is you and i having an unwavering
[1:14:11] stability
[1:14:13] in our belief
[1:14:15] jesus christ is our lord and savior
[1:14:18] unwavering
[1:14:20] hallelujah
[1:14:22] i hope this doesn't seem too cut up i
[1:14:23] realized my plate was way too big
[1:14:27] uh
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] now look at this see
[1:14:34] satan upset i got got some notes here
[1:14:36] satan upset the balance in eve
[1:14:39] and uh
[1:14:42] she was there
[1:14:43] listening to him and he says you know
[1:14:44] surely
[1:14:45] he didn't mean that you would die
[1:14:47] certainly he didn't mean that
[1:14:49] he's just kind of putting a scare into
[1:14:51] you you know like tell us all that if we
[1:14:53] just live like the world that we're
[1:14:56] going to go to hell but
[1:14:57] no
[1:14:58] i
[1:14:59] i'm a christian i believe in god
[1:15:02] you know how shocked you can be when
[1:15:03] you're trying to talk to someone and
[1:15:05] they tell you
[1:15:07] i'm a christian
[1:15:08] you are
[1:15:10] i mean i'm sorry you just look stunned
[1:15:12] you are
[1:15:13] i had no idea
[1:15:16] and i'm not saying that mockingly it's
[1:15:18] just everything about their life nothing
[1:15:20] testifies of being a christian and they
[1:15:22] say i'm a christian and i'm like
[1:15:25] okay okay i believe there's a god
[1:15:31] well the devil believes that
[1:15:34] the devil believes there's a god
[1:15:37] but let's bring the devil up
[1:15:39] and tell him if you really believe in
[1:15:42] god
[1:15:44] then live it
[1:15:51] i would redeem
[1:15:54] but lest i would mar my own inheritance
[1:15:58] in other words i look like this
[1:16:00] supremely confident man
[1:16:02] but i'm not sure if i lay my life down
[1:16:06] i can raise it back up
[1:16:08] and then
[1:16:10] my whole plan
[1:16:11] just fell apart
[1:16:16] saying sorry
[1:16:19] are you full of enough faith
[1:16:22] to lay your life down
[1:16:26] and are you full of enough faith
[1:16:29] to have a hundred percent confidence god
[1:16:32] will raise it
[1:16:33] back up again
[1:16:38] are you talking about dying brother paul
[1:16:39] no i'm talking about dying to self
[1:16:43] dying to every reasoning dying to every
[1:16:45] thought every emotion everything that
[1:16:48] makes up this humanity are we willing to
[1:16:51] die so completely to ourselves that we
[1:16:53] would be like so without personality
[1:16:55] without anything
[1:16:59] believing that
[1:17:00] god would raise us back up
[1:17:03] and as the scripture says make us shine
[1:17:04] like the stars in heaven
[1:17:08] now some of you say i'm not interested
[1:17:09] in that
[1:17:10] i don't believe you
[1:17:12] i believe you we all like to be
[1:17:14] acknowledged just we like to be
[1:17:16] acknowledged in our way
[1:17:21] come on
[1:17:24] are you willing to just lay your life
[1:17:26] down and say lord however you desire to
[1:17:28] acknowledge me
[1:17:30] that's how i want to be acknowledged
[1:17:34] hallelujah whole another sermon i'm
[1:17:35] sorry i bled over to the next page
[1:17:40] see
[1:17:43] god put a demarcation
[1:17:45] in the word
[1:17:46] the before and after right here in these
[1:17:48] verses saints we looked at this
[1:17:50] but
[1:17:50] see but before hey they're they're in
[1:17:53] that position the after amen satan would
[1:17:56] like you to see yourself no different
[1:17:59] he'd like to
[1:18:00] have you look at yourself
[1:18:03] and and say yep the me before and the me
[1:18:05] now is not really any different
[1:18:10] i hope you don't get offended
[1:18:13] brothers sisters you actually have the
[1:18:15] same problem
[1:18:18] some do i should say
[1:18:22] brother brown was
[1:18:23] going up the hill to the campground
[1:18:27] there's a little girl
[1:18:29] a little strip of cloth
[1:18:31] wearing a little dinky dress with fringe
[1:18:33] on it
[1:18:35] slinking her way up there
[1:18:37] wishing a boy would stop
[1:18:40] you see my brother and sister the devil
[1:18:42] still throws these kind of things maybe
[1:18:44] some big muscular young man
[1:18:47] i'll tell you
[1:18:50] dave to share opinions
[1:18:54] to me it's just as wrong
[1:18:56] for a brother to walk around with his
[1:18:57] shirt and button
[1:18:59] as it would be for a sister
[1:19:02] some people don't agree right but
[1:19:04] remember we talked about that
[1:19:05] disagreeing earlier right and you said i
[1:19:07] heard somebody say amen to it so i think
[1:19:09] we're on board right
[1:19:10] but i'm telling you when we start
[1:19:12] unbuttoning on our shirt and walk around
[1:19:13] like we are something special
[1:19:16] you're offering the same as a sister
[1:19:18] would be and we would flip out
[1:19:22] if a sister in this church walked around
[1:19:25] with her shirt i'm down to a button
[1:19:32] did i say that clear enough
[1:19:35] okay i just i didn't want to stumble
[1:19:37] over that one
[1:19:39] amen
[1:19:40] so you see my brother and sister what's
[1:19:42] happening is satan's coming trying to
[1:19:45] present it in such a fashion
[1:19:49] that we wouldn't see ourselves any
[1:19:50] different than
[1:19:52] then and now
[1:19:54] but the word so clearly
[1:19:56] places us in an entirely different
[1:19:59] position same flesh as it is here the
[1:20:03] same personality the same smile the same
[1:20:06] intelligence
[1:20:08] but a different person a new creature
[1:20:11] new creation in christ jesus
[1:20:14] amen but after that the kindness and
[1:20:16] love of god our savior towards man
[1:20:18] appeared
[1:20:20] not by works of righteousness which we
[1:20:22] have done
[1:20:23] but according to his mercy he saved us
[1:20:26] by washing of the regeneration and
[1:20:29] renewing of the holy spirit now look
[1:20:32] i want to hurry here i actually
[1:20:34] actually glad i didn't say i'll be done
[1:20:36] in five minutes or something
[1:20:38] amen now look at this
[1:20:40] not by works of righteousness which we
[1:20:42] have done but according to his mercy he
[1:20:44] saved us by the washing of regeneration
[1:20:47] and renewing of the holy ghost now i
[1:20:49] want to focus this thought right here in
[1:20:51] this uh in verse five as we look at this
[1:20:54] and take me back if you would brothers
[1:20:56] to the scripture verse five amen you
[1:20:59] look back now at this my brother and
[1:21:00] sister what it is saying right here that
[1:21:03] in the renewing of the holy ghost now my
[1:21:07] brother and sister the renewing
[1:21:10] according to webster is a re-affirming
[1:21:16] now we're flash
[1:21:18] we're human aren't we
[1:21:22] okay i've got a box here
[1:21:24] click only on the ones that are a train
[1:21:29] i need to make sure you're humans
[1:21:36] what happens
[1:21:40] i'm sorry out to tell you here's this
[1:21:42] little boy walking along here
[1:21:44] he sees that little girl brother brown
[1:21:46] is talking about
[1:21:48] something triggers in his mind
[1:21:51] oh i hope this isn't too blunt for you
[1:21:55] wow
[1:21:57] look at her
[1:22:00] we get so spiritual we don't want to
[1:22:02] deal with these issues
[1:22:04] but we got some teenage boy following
[1:22:06] that girl and he's got sensations
[1:22:08] roaring through his mind and his body
[1:22:10] like you can't believe he's like oh my
[1:22:13] goodness
[1:22:14] look at her she's so beautiful
[1:22:17] but doesn't realize it's actually an
[1:22:19] enticing devil
[1:22:21] it's dancing in front of him he's not
[1:22:24] really seeing the girl he's seeing a
[1:22:25] devil
[1:22:27] oh i've got quotes to back that up
[1:22:29] amen that's a devil that's there
[1:22:32] dancing before him
[1:22:35] and so we look at that and we say oh my
[1:22:38] goodness what is happening here and that
[1:22:40] little boy might be headed the same
[1:22:42] service brother brandon was that little
[1:22:44] boy all of a sudden something happens
[1:22:46] and he's like oh my goodness what am i
[1:22:48] doing i'm thinking all these
[1:22:50] oh sorry we're human and i have to
[1:22:53] preach this to you that's right all
[1:22:55] kinds of thoughts
[1:22:59] but something
[1:23:01] and he's like oh my forgive me lord
[1:23:04] i was lusting after her
[1:23:06] now he goes into the service
[1:23:08] are you with me
[1:23:10] can i bring this out this way
[1:23:12] now he's in the service and brother
[1:23:13] branham's preaching and all he's
[1:23:14] thinking about
[1:23:15] lord forgive me
[1:23:18] i was lusting after that little girl
[1:23:21] oh lord forgive me i'm not even a
[1:23:24] believer
[1:23:25] i'm not even a christian lord forgive me
[1:23:30] and the holy spirit comes down
[1:23:32] and this scripture
[1:23:34] is then fulfilled
[1:23:37] in his presence
[1:23:39] because you see saints
[1:23:43] not
[1:23:44] by works of righteousness
[1:23:46] but according to his mercy
[1:23:49] by the wash washing of regeneration what
[1:23:53] taking you back to your first estate
[1:23:57] the holy spirit coming stirring the
[1:23:59] heart of that young man and saying
[1:24:01] that's not who i am lord
[1:24:06] and the renewing
[1:24:08] did you catch this when you read this
[1:24:09] earlier
[1:24:10] the renewing of the holy ghost you know
[1:24:12] what in the right context what that is
[1:24:14] referring to a time when there has been
[1:24:18] a gap
[1:24:22] there is now a restoration
[1:24:26] a time when you stepped out from
[1:24:28] underneath the presence of god
[1:24:31] come on saints we are i'm not preaching
[1:24:34] to a bunch of sinners but i'm not
[1:24:36] preaching to people who haven't grown up
[1:24:37] in this present world
[1:24:39] and you come to that place that little
[1:24:41] gap in there and the devil will just
[1:24:43] beat you can someone say amen the devil
[1:24:46] will beat you with what happened in that
[1:24:49] gap but god come along and said by the
[1:24:51] renewing oh hallelujah by the renewing
[1:24:55] of the holy ghost i come down on you and
[1:24:58] i set you back to your first estate
[1:25:01] i set you back as though you never done
[1:25:04] it
[1:25:05] oh hallelujah how beautiful the word is
[1:25:08] my brother and sister he comes and he
[1:25:11] says yes i'm gonna give you a renewing
[1:25:14] and that young man the next time in his
[1:25:16] life he's walking a road and that is
[1:25:18] there he remembers he says oh the devil
[1:25:22] dropped me here before but he's not
[1:25:24] gonna trap me today and he remembers in
[1:25:28] the renewing of the holy spirit
[1:25:31] but that some same young man might be at
[1:25:33] work
[1:25:34] and his boss will say oh my
[1:25:37] just lie on that inventory count
[1:25:40] so we don't have to go count everything
[1:25:42] and find what's missing
[1:25:45] and he thinks oh my
[1:25:48] i wanted to go to the youth meeting on
[1:25:50] friday
[1:25:52] and if i write that we're missing 10
[1:25:54] cases
[1:25:55] we're going to be in here setting every
[1:25:57] pallet down
[1:25:58] counting every single
[1:26:00] and i won't go to youth meeting
[1:26:04] checks it off
[1:26:06] but then the holy ghost
[1:26:09] won't let it stay that way
[1:26:12] because there's a renewing coming
[1:26:15] there's a promise of the renewing and it
[1:26:17] deals with him and he walks in
[1:26:19] to his boss it might be a day
[1:26:22] two days five ten it might be a month
[1:26:26] and walks in and says i lied on the
[1:26:27] inventory count
[1:26:29] because i didn't want to have to count
[1:26:30] them all
[1:26:34] the boss says i know
[1:26:38] how do you know
[1:26:40] as i took those ten cases
[1:26:42] and gave them out
[1:26:44] as freebies to a vendor
[1:26:48] i knew they weren't there
[1:26:57] you know who that boy was
[1:27:03] right here
[1:27:07] that's why i get to preach some of these
[1:27:08] things to you
[1:27:11] i was the boy that walked behind the
[1:27:13] girl
[1:27:16] oh that sounds shocking doesn't it
[1:27:17] you're pastor
[1:27:21] i was the boy that lied about the
[1:27:22] inventory
[1:27:24] and we ain't got enough time to finish
[1:27:26] out the rest of the examples
[1:27:29] but you see by the renewing of the holy
[1:27:32] ghost god comes in
[1:27:34] and says i'm going to take you from your
[1:27:36] present place and will put you back in
[1:27:38] your original estate
[1:27:41] which i possess the title deed to
[1:27:44] so i know you're mine
[1:27:47] you've been marked
[1:27:49] a price has been paid
[1:27:52] oh hallelujah saints
[1:27:54] you ever wonder why the preacher can
[1:27:55] preach it so real sometimes it might be
[1:27:58] that he lived it that's right
[1:28:02] well praise the lord
[1:28:05] we can have elections just as soon as
[1:28:07] you would like
[1:28:11] well praise the lord sister emmy come on
[1:28:13] it's going to force me to stop
[1:28:16] and i need to
[1:28:18] fellowship by redemption
[1:28:22] now listen i want to tell you something
[1:28:25] i couldn't finish without reading this
[1:28:26] one i'm sorry i want to tell you
[1:28:28] something and listen close
[1:28:30] to it at this remark
[1:28:33] i'm going to be just a little bit
[1:28:35] different this morning
[1:28:37] i'm going to let myself loose
[1:28:39] with some of my own
[1:28:42] theology
[1:28:46] now you guys won't blink an eye when the
[1:28:47] prophet says that but if i got up here
[1:28:49] and said that without you knowing the
[1:28:50] prophet said that you guys would all get
[1:28:52] eyebrows to the ceiling and you would be
[1:28:54] so nervous you'd have one foot anchored
[1:28:56] in the carpet ready to run
[1:29:00] but you have to understand the context
[1:29:02] of what's being spoken
[1:29:07] i'm going to let myself loose with some
[1:29:08] of my own theology some of my own
[1:29:10] thoughts my own conceptions of the
[1:29:13] scripture that i've never said in this
[1:29:15] church before or no other church but i
[1:29:18] feel that it might be
[1:29:19] profitable
[1:29:21] this morning
[1:29:24] man in his own heart has ideas and so
[1:29:26] forth
[1:29:27] that he believes and holds sacred in his
[1:29:29] heart
[1:29:30] is secrets between him and god
[1:29:32] and no one else knows about but him and
[1:29:35] god alone
[1:29:36] you know that every one of you believers
[1:29:39] know that just the believer and his
[1:29:41] maker
[1:29:42] alone
[1:29:44] now
[1:29:45] right there write it down
[1:29:48] go home read the whole thing so you can
[1:29:49] make sure you got the whole thing but i
[1:29:51] want you to understand
[1:29:52] there are things that god has done in
[1:29:54] your life that no other believer can
[1:29:57] relate to that circumstance
[1:30:00] but god has made it so real to you
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:03] i'll tell you
[1:30:04] saints any of you preachers can say amen
[1:30:07] if you want to and maybe some of you
[1:30:09] others feel the same way there's times
[1:30:10] i've went home and i have felt so alone
[1:30:13] and felt so disregarded as it were as a
[1:30:16] pastor as a minister don't feel sorry
[1:30:18] for me god knows what he's doing
[1:30:20] and i literally down in my pity party
[1:30:23] and i say lord
[1:30:26] if i have even one friend
[1:30:29] on this earth
[1:30:32] my phone rang
[1:30:34] we're talking about
[1:30:36] that much of a gap of time
[1:30:38] if i have one friend on this earth
[1:30:41] [Music]
[1:30:42] and the phone rings
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:48] i only share that with you just to make
[1:30:50] the point
[1:30:52] see how
[1:30:53] that's just between me and the lord now
[1:30:55] you kind of know about it
[1:30:57] it's a very very edited version you got
[1:31:02] knows
[1:31:03] that's just between me and the lord he
[1:31:04] knows my struggles he knows my pain he
[1:31:06] knows your pain he knows your struggle
[1:31:09] and he's listening
[1:31:13] and oftentimes he's saying look you're
[1:31:16] just a little bit out of the word here
[1:31:19] just get back in the word and it will
[1:31:20] lose everything
[1:31:23] it will lose the word in your life it
[1:31:25] will lose the bonds it will lose these
[1:31:27] troubles it will loose all of this just
[1:31:29] just get in line
[1:31:31] just please take another step get in
[1:31:32] line
[1:31:34] last time i went to the airport any of
[1:31:36] you that have flown you'll know what i'm
[1:31:37] talking about
[1:31:38] they have you step in that little booth
[1:31:40] and you're supposed to put your feet on
[1:31:41] the floor
[1:31:42] put your hands up
[1:31:44] i stepped in there kind of sloppy you
[1:31:46] know not really thinking about it
[1:31:48] and the little girls there
[1:31:50] i always thought that was just they
[1:31:52] wanted you to stand in one spot because
[1:31:53] they want to just make you do it
[1:31:56] and the little girl's like sir can you
[1:31:58] step forward the machine won't work
[1:32:01] if you're not stepping in those areas
[1:32:05] struck me in my heart i thought that's
[1:32:07] it
[1:32:07] god didn't say just come to church all
[1:32:09] sloppy
[1:32:10] i was in the house of god today i didn't
[1:32:12] get nothing
[1:32:13] you know god's got a position he wants
[1:32:14] you to step into i want you to step into
[1:32:17] that channel
[1:32:18] he wants you to step into that place and
[1:32:21] and you step into that place now if we
[1:32:23] say i i don't the preacher i don't know
[1:32:25] i'm not going to do that
[1:32:27] preacher wants me to lift my hand
[1:32:30] wants me to worship
[1:32:32] that's the preacher
[1:32:36] maybe it's not
[1:32:39] maybe it's god speaking to you here's a
[1:32:40] time receive your promise
[1:32:43] receive the word
[1:32:45] act on it
[1:32:50] hallelujah
[1:32:54] just a believer in his maker all alone
[1:32:57] you see ultimately each one's got to
[1:32:59] come to the word right
[1:33:02] and the word's got to become more
[1:33:03] absolute
[1:33:04] now i'm going to put this out here some
[1:33:06] people might not like it but i'm going
[1:33:07] to say it
[1:33:08] there's something
[1:33:09] moving through the land
[1:33:12] it's very subtle
[1:33:14] believers of the message are saying the
[1:33:16] message
[1:33:17] is the absolute
[1:33:20] when the messenger that spoke the
[1:33:22] message said the bible
[1:33:24] is the absolute
[1:33:26] then they'll tell you if you call them
[1:33:27] on it well it's the same isn't it
[1:33:30] no
[1:33:32] no the bible is the bible
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:35] the word of the ages
[1:33:37] is god's bible expressed
[1:33:41] but don't let the devil
[1:33:43] turn one
[1:33:44] into the other
[1:33:47] come on
[1:33:49] [Music]
[1:33:56] i read this quote to you here just
[1:33:58] recently let's move forward and quit
[1:34:00] now notice again how jesus overcome the
[1:34:02] world system of religion when he's
[1:34:04] repeatedly badgered by the theologians
[1:34:06] of his day he constantly applied the
[1:34:08] word
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:12] constantly applied the word
[1:34:14] he spake only what the father gave him
[1:34:16] to speak
[1:34:17] there was not a time when the word was
[1:34:19] not utterly confused by the word time
[1:34:22] when the world was not utterly confused
[1:34:24] by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of
[1:34:26] god
[1:34:27] in his own personal life contending with
[1:34:29] himself
[1:34:32] come on
[1:34:33] we forget that he was tried with every
[1:34:36] temptation he'd been tried with
[1:34:39] every situation oh you're gonna think
[1:34:41] that this is heresy
[1:34:45] there was my lord jesus walking up the
[1:34:47] road towards the campground
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:50] and that same little girl
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:54] with the same spirit
[1:34:55] one little girl
[1:34:57] was right there
[1:34:59] come on
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:01] the word says he was tried
[1:35:03] in every fashion
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:08] time when the world was not utterly
[1:35:10] confused by his wisdom for his wisdom of
[1:35:11] god his own personal life contending
[1:35:13] with himself he overcame by obedience to
[1:35:17] the word of god in hebrews 5 7 to who in
[1:35:20] the days of his flesh when he had
[1:35:22] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:35:24] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:35:26] that was able to save him from death and
[1:35:30] was heard in that he feared though he
[1:35:32] were a son yet he learned obedience
[1:35:35] by the things which he suffered and
[1:35:38] being made perfect he became the author
[1:35:40] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:35:43] obey him what was he obedient to
[1:35:48] the word of god amen
[1:35:50] hallelujah
[1:35:52] hallelujah i'm sorry for some gaps in
[1:35:53] there but i've already kept you long
[1:35:55] enough
[1:35:56] amen let's just stand sing a song
[1:35:58] there's a fountain open in the house of
[1:36:00] david i thank the lord for that amen
[1:36:03] that fountain has never closed it's
[1:36:05] never gone away and my brother and
[1:36:07] sister here we are
[1:36:09] oh i didn't even bring you the other
[1:36:11] side of obedience today i didn't bring
[1:36:13] you the other side of what it is when a
[1:36:16] man or a woman
[1:36:18] would simply say
[1:36:20] that's
[1:36:21] not what he meant we touched down that
[1:36:23] last sunday that's not what he meant
[1:36:26] what are they doing
[1:36:27] they're really not trying
[1:36:30] this might be confusing for you they're
[1:36:32] really not trying to change the word of
[1:36:34] god
[1:36:35] they're actually trying to open up a
[1:36:37] spot in the word
[1:36:39] that they can slip an exemption for
[1:36:42] themselves
[1:36:43] in there
[1:36:46] because if that's what he meant i've got
[1:36:48] to change
[1:36:49] but i like me i like my life i like my
[1:36:52] understanding of the word for the hour i
[1:36:54] like all of this so what i need to do is
[1:36:57] open this up that's not really what he
[1:36:58] meant and then we'll insert
[1:37:00] our explanation
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:05] and they wouldn't judge it as though it
[1:37:06] was adding and taking away from the word
[1:37:08] of god
[1:37:10] because it's just concerning them
[1:37:12] but i'm sorry
[1:37:14] it applies
[1:37:15] [Music]
