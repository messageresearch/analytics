we could turn in Jeremiah chapter 8 and it's good to be in the house of God tonight yes it's good to be a Christian you know I was laying in bed last night thinking about the grace of God and how someone can be an absolute mess and that no one would have any respect for them no one would have any desire of a friendship with them but God can come down and in the matter of one evening turn a compersion completely around so they're respected by those around them till they hold true to their word and become someone that you can look up to that's that's the power of God's grace and it's just it's incredible when you stop you think about it Jeremiah chapter 8 verse 22 the Bible says is there no balm in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered a title tonight is when God asks the question why and my subtitle is the balm in Gilead Bauer heads Heavenly Father Lord we know that we have nothing to bring but our hearts before you father we have nothing to say father but your praises we have nothing to do but worship you tonight father we have praised you in song we have worshiped you in song father now Lord Jesus we worship you with our attention tonight father's we desire to hear Lord from you and father that the devil will come even in the service father and try to take our attention with a stirring hear or a thought of what we have to do tomorrow what we did today father take our attention away for a split second when you have something to say Lord I pray that you would just come down on each heart Lord and take every thought captive to the glory of God Lord that we would be attentive to you tonight Lord Jesus father this is quality time with our bridegroom this is quality time with our husband Jesus Christ and Lord we so desire to hear from you Lord Jesus we so desire that Lord nothing would come between us tonight but they would be open father whether it hurts we would be open with you Lord we thank you Father and commit these words and this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated tonight when God asks the question why amen praise Lord I saw this the other day says people pray for the Lord to send them bread then when he gives them the ingredients to take to bake the bread they storm out of the kitchen it's amazing how we have an are we get an idea in our head about anything really and we're so stubborn I need to do something different let me know we're so stubborn that no matter what happens no matter what proof I can show you you won't change your mind because you know you know you're right and to change the mind of a man is something that I believe only God can do you know sometimes we come even the little things we come and we have something and we print it prevent it to some to somebody but God provides the atmosphere that atmosphere for that person to to let their pride down and accept a change of mind there's a lot of things in in life where we as believers we come to a place where we realize that God is asking us to change our mind and God is asking us to look at a situation a different way or God is asking us to accept what he has for us but because it's contrary to what we thought it should be because it's contrary to you think it was or we were taught what it was our entire life we storm out of the kitchen sometimes we have a need in our life maybe we need $500 and we got to have it by Sunday and somebody calls you up Thursday and says hey if you come out and pull the weeds and clean up my yard in the back and in the front I've got three or four rentals that need this done you do that I'll give you five hundred dollars and we return it down because that's work but God answered your prayer he provided a way for you to receive about five hundred dollars and so it's I believe we have to be aware that insensitive to what God is doing in our lives and we have to be aware and sensitive to what God is doing around us and praise Lord sometimes God has to ask the question why and we're gonna get to that but we're also talking about the balm in Gilead tonight and we read the scripture in Jeremiah 822 says is there no balm in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter my people recovered in other words Jeremiah Jeremiah says asses question but the answer is yes there is a balm in Gilead and so then he says that the answer is yes why are you sick why aren't you healing and the balm of Gilead is the Holy Ghost it's the rock amen the rock in the wilderness the rock that Gideon sacrificed his doubts on and it's the revelation of who Christ is the balm in Gilead changes and gives you the right view of God a lot of people that view God through say their father or the pastor they thought the church they went to or a figure in their lament or in their life and they get a skewed view of God and they think well God is out to get me they think that God is is hanging over them with a hammer ready to strike in and denounce them to a sentence to sentence them away but God is in and where we live the day we live in here on earth God desires our relationship with you and when when sometimes we we we we have healing that we need in our life and and someone has done us wrong and God God that that is not what you would call a sin but that can come between you and God and God says I had there's a balm in Gilead the Lord says there is a salve to apply to this wound to begin the healing but first but why don't you accept it you know saying we don't want God to ask us the question why we want to stay away from that because if he has to ask us why which I believe as human beings we will come to that now did and we will probably in the future because this flesh man is that out of control actually he's not over control if you have the Holy Ghost he's under the control you understand what I'm saying and so he if he's asking you the question why there's something you're missing there's something that that that's you're overlooking and instead of getting mad and storming out of the kitchen stop and say look around and say you know what what do I have here what is God trying to show me and and and we many times we can think of the balm in Gilead as simply a healing the physician and that is true for the outward body that is true for sicknesses but I believe it goes even deeper than that and it can be healing for your soul healing for your spirit here healing for your heart and sometimes we miss God in his moving we miss him in his moving and then he has to turn around and ask us why do you still hurt why are you holding on to this pain when there's a balm in Gilead and the amazing thing about this is if you're gonna cut on your hand and you put neosporin or you put an ointment on there it'll heal that cut it will provide a to chase away the bacteria keep it clean and they will heal it but it doesn't make your thumb or your finger any stronger but the incredible thing about the balm in Gilead is it is an eternal anointment and so what happens is God lays that salve upon you and now you have to be willing to lay down because if if I have a card on my hand and I need stitches and I need some salve and I'm waving it all over the place yelling at the doctor he's not gonna be able to do anything I have to submit my hand to the doctors hand the doctors work and you have to submit your heart to the hand of the surgeon Christ and it's going to hurt there when you go into surgery that surgery is there to save your life if you will but they're still going to come pain from that surgery but that is the process of healing but what the poem does is it is it do I need a swap nice lord all righty hopefully it stays on there okay praise the Lord are we on amen The Devil's fighting us tonight one way or the other he'll come in try to turn your your attention then that's not what I prayed for the Lord keep our attention on you and now we're all thinking about a microphone but that's okay so what the balm in Gilead does is it comes and it heals but then it also strengthens you it when that healing comes you now move and and the next time you face a similar situation there's a strength that wasn't there before because God provides for what we need God prepares us for the future if we submit to him praise the Lord and there's a couple examples here in the scripture and there's more where we're brother Branham talks about or and listen this first one talks about God asking the question why and he says in the balm in Gilead 1959 he says Jeremiah many hundreds of years ago was commanded of Jehovah to stand in the gates of the city and ask this question is there no balm in Gilead or is there no physician there the question is why then he said is the daughter of my people not recovered he says the word why God asked that question when God has made a way for people to escape danger or to escape sickness or troubles or disaster provides a way of escape and the people turn it down and refuse it then God asked why what's the reason that you don't accept it see Oh God did this God took my father and he passed away God allow this this this person to hurt me God allowed this to happen why did God allow that to happen and God doesn't answer those kind of questions God just turns around and says why having accepted the balm in Gilead why have you not accepted my invitation I know you're hurt and I know you're trouble but here take my hand but people don't want that they storm out of the kitchen second Kings chapter 1 you can turn there if you if he would like I'm just gonna read it right out second Kings chapter 1 verse verse 1 and it came to pass when the Lord would take up nope first Kings oh oh maybe its first oh that's because that's chapter 2 okay chapter 1 like I said first King second Kings chapter 1 then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab and a haze I fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go inquire of Beelzebub the God of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease but the angel of the Lord said said to Elijah the Tishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and saying to them is it not because there is not a god in israel that you go to inquire Beelzebub the god of Ekron now therefore thus saith the Lord thou shall come down from that bed on which thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shall surely die and Elijah departed well the venom says in the same message little further down he says it wasn't because there wasn't a God in Israel neither was it speaking of a haze I neither was it because there wasn't a prophet in Israel but it was the King's stubbornness his hatred for the true prophet prophet of Israel it wasn't because that God hadn't supplied the remedy it was because that he was too stubborn and he didn't like Elisha well I don't like that preacher I don't like that pastor Ike and so what happens is sometimes that's the very person God's going to bring the message of deliverance through but because of your stubbornness you out into the world looking for a remedy he says it was because he was too stubborn and he didn't like Elijah because Elijah had predicted all the evil that happened to his father therefore he had created by the habits of his home to hate the man of God to despise him and reject him lord help us to uplift one another in front of our kids in uplift one another in front of our friends uplift one another in the eyes of God because you never know what your words will do to someone's influence on another person here is a haze I if he would have sent his men to Elijah the story would have been very different but instead he went looking for a remedy even though he knew because he asked them in the further down and he says unto them in verse 7 what manner of man was he which came out to meet you had told you these words and they answered him he was in a head he was a hairy man gert was the girdle of leather about his loins and he said it is Elijah the Tishbite so he knew about it latch and he knew in his heart he should go ask Elijah but he knew that Elijah would say yes you'll come off the bed if you surrender and you do this and you get rid of this and you allow your life to be washed out so there was going to be two applications if you will of the balm of Gilead the first to heal him from falling through the last and the second to heal his heart and his relationship with Christ but he was too stubborn because he didn't like Elijah he was too stubborn and the thing of it is is that we you have to ask Christians we have to look past the the the the we have to look past this earth and we have to look past what we see around us and we have to remember that that that though God is asking us to do something that would be painful because because his I would have to submit his pride and and openly confess that he believed Elijah to be a pro which would go against everything he had said everything his dad had said and so he would have to humble himself and this was just too hard for him to do but what you felt what he failed to realize was nothing is too hard to sacrifice on this side for a chance and a relationship with God for eternity much less your relationship with God here I would much rather be a Christian serving God going and making things right that are difficult to do and have peace in my heart and have rest and enjoy the pieces of this planet that I can while I'm here and have a confidence in God have a confidence of what he's done in me amen to reach out and take as many people with me as I can cuz I'm going amen Matthew nothing wrong with confessing that I thought arrogant at all Matthew chapter 25 but the RAM says you know use you to confess that perfect body that healed body in front of you and you step into it well I'm confessing Matthew step into hit into that portion and go to glory you know I loved it I loved to think about that I I don't know I feel like I feel like people sometimes they believers good good god-fearing people should - don't stop often enough to think and imagine themselves I have a very vivid imagination imagine themselves walking on gold and then and then you know you you think about the most beautiful place you've been at and as far as out in the wilderness or the now nature times that by a million and you think about it and then you then then snot to think about think about how you feel right now there's a little ache in your back maybe maybe you have a small headache maybe you have anxiousness none of that's going be there there is so much we go a lot around in life carrying because of the Fallen nature of man that we won't we don't even think about it but it won't even be there do you realize how like sometimes you know when is when it's come time to pay the bills and you're like oh goodness and stresses you out imagine having all the money you could in the world to pay anything you wanted to there'd be no stress about money you wouldn't be worried about it well it does bring grief sometimes though but on the other side all of that taken care of and none of that exists amen I don't know praise the Lord Matthew chapter 25 so we saw his eye and how he turned down he denied the balm and it brought separation it brought death Matthew chapter 25 verse 1 we all know the scripture if you know where I'm going stop let me get there first then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they were that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept the foolish virgins slept out of laziness the wise virgins slept out of peace with God and that midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish that under the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves some people might think you know that was pretty selfish of the wise well those aren't the Bible say give your cloak and don't expect it back or lend to your neighbor and not expect it back there's not what the Bible says what you don't understand is the relationship between you and God is entirely your responsibility sometimes lending someone cash is detrimental to their growth and maturity you say why won't you help them well because if I do they're just gonna get worse they say well you're supposed to to lend and you're supposed to give and know you're supposed to care for the other person sometimes you know your relationship is between you and God and you are in charge of that and that is your responsibility and if you fail there as the fluence version it in this case that was your fault that was your burden I got really quiet in here right cuz that's the sobering thought I can't save brother David I can pray for him I can extend the hand of mercy but sometimes not brother David in this example but sometimes some people turn you away then what can you do you just step aside and you pray but you don't want to be over there and they say well you're my neighbor and I never heard it from you so don't forget to spread the good news of Christ praise the Lord verse 10 and while they would to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh you know this reminds me sometimes people say well I just don't have the time I can't do that because I don't have the time but then if you were to accompany them throughout the day and you saw how much time they wasted you'd be able to say you know you had the time if you would not do this or you would or you would monitor this more closely and and you would you and you would have you would have instead of stopping here and here and here and here you didn't need to you could have done it this way look you actually have two hours extra in your day the foolish version said they maybe got to a place where they say well I just don't have the time I'm just too busy with things like I don't have the time to do that I don't have the time to take care of that and they let it go they never had a desire in their heart for that closeness of relationship that the wise version had amen and and so you see them and they're they're good people and they're falling by the wayside because they just don't have enough time if you will but at the same time see they wanted to partake of the rest that the wise version was experiencing but they are partaking of that too soon they had not yet taken care of their lamp and taking care of the the oil and made sure everything was good so that they then could rest so they tried to enter into and then sometimes believers they move past this and well no they know serpents eat and all this stuff and and I need to hear how to raise my kids I need to hear about the deep things of the word but what they do is they're moving past they're moving past that lamp they're moving past making sure and looking in early at their lives and instead going for an intellectual conception of the message and into a conception of the Word of God and they try to enter into this rest but what that rest is is a laziness because they know they they there's something they're not doing to make everything right make sure everything's good and so and so they miss their opportunity to further that relationship with God to apply the balm in Gilead now God is asking the question why were your lamps not filled you had time to sleep but you didn't have time to fill your lamps why they denied the balm and these two things in these two examples they had son as uh as I said and which brought separation which brought death amen Jesus said you know the bridegroom said depart I know you not there was no rillette out of that there is I know you in an intimate way a relationship you can only get that you know you as whenever I went to court my wife I couldn't just walk up and to her when I met her and say marry me I had to to move and I had to work right I had to say the right words I had to get her the flowers I had to spend time with her I had to to woo her right you don't just you have to go through the same process with God he's your lover right you can't just you can't just just there's there's a relationship that you what I'm trying to say is there something you have to work on there's a part you have to do and it's not that that that that there's something you need to go out and do physically it's the fact that you have to write in in order for a relationship to become intimate my wife over time had to open up to me herself who she is what she likes what she likes to do how she feels about certain things how things this bothers her or that makes her happy she has to open up in order for her to open up she has to first trust me with that right and so you have to trust God you have to put your faith in God then you have to open the parts of your heart that you have closed tightly shut because there have been hurt you have to allow that balm in Gilead to come and wash over that soul and bring openness in your heart there was a man that had this problem similar in the Bible in psalms chapter 73 amen i spoke this to the youth a few weeks ago amen his name was Asaph and ACF had a problem if you go back and you read it i encourage you to read it tonight he had it he was looking at the people of the world and this the the chapter starts off with my steps were where I was I was almost backslidden basically because I looked at the wicked and I saw the prosperity of the foolish and I saw how these you know they they they walk basically what he's saying is they walk and they've cursed God yet they are rich they have everything they have all this stuff and I was envious at the scripture the verse says I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked his eyes were on the world and he says when I thought to know this it was too painful for me he says I couldn't tell the other Israelites because what would they think about me couldn't express to them what I was what I was going through I couldn't express them how I wanted to be them but then in 7 verse 17 he says until I went into the sanctuary of God then understood I there in the sanctuary of God or the balm in Gilead until he went in with God into the sanctuary with God into the secret place with God then he began to understand and sometimes you know that takes that takes work and so we want to assume things we want to try to guess what it is we want to try to make up something that sounds good that fits and-and-and-and-and in sand and try to formulate an idea and just talk about it and man it's fun to talk right it's fun to just go what about this and what about that and he just he's just a bunch of talk but to actually go in and see for yourself what God thinks about it you have to open yourself up you have to surrender and then and in this case Asaph did so and now God doesn't ask have to ask him the question why it opened a staffs eyes to the truth and set his heart free then where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom I mean know the truth and the truth shall set you free and when that truth set you free and when it brought you into Christ and that truth will continue to set you free amen if you open yourself up to the Holy Ghost and allow him to bring the healing upon your life because the truth of what how God see this is the truth of what how God sees you not how that person sees you that truth will set you free from a spirit of inferiority from a complex of inferiority because you begin to see well how God views you amen that is truth that is the absolute truth that will set you free the balm in Gilead it brings healing from false doctrine they say well I I'm out of that church I'm out of that false doctrine yeah but there's things that linger in your life maybe you ask yourself you know how dare they why did they do that they they took away some of my years and and and now I you know he during all this false doctrine and how could they blatantly speak these words without first making sure and and and and and and you become wounded and then you become offended and if you're not careful that offense will take root in bitterness and bitterness will drive the holy spirit right out of your life but God has brought you from that situation and placed you here to begin to mend you to begin to apply the balm in Gilead so if you sit there and you hold that bitterness in there in your heart God is asking you the question why why do you hold on to that when I've set you free why do you hold on to that when I have given you a healing you say well they're not healed yet it doesn't matter for the foundation of the world God healed you before the foundation of the world God set you free amen it just takes time for that word to catch up and manifest in your life and God spoke out and said let there be light his words went out as you if you would they stretched out across the the blackness amen they came together they brought everything that needed to get out the ingredients together that they produced the ingredients however it happened and out came the Sun God spoke the word and rested on that because he knows his word will come to pass and God has spoken the word to you amen never fear God will bring it to pass amen the God the balm in Gilead provides healing from parental abuse those people have been hurt and offended by by their parents and sometimes in extreme situations sometimes not as extreme and they'll carry that with him and they begin to view themselves as less than what God wants them to see themselves and and then they'll live a life underprivileged for the Branham says I was just reading him sermon total deliverance he says there's too many underprivileged Christians he said if you're living under privileged a mentor that's not going to bring total deliverance you have to or something it's along those lines I can't remember the quote but what happens is you begin to live under privilege now it begins to affect other areas of your life and you begin to live a life of defeat simply because you accepted somebody's opinion about you rather than the truth from God amen the balm in Gilead can heal past their abuse that's a big problem because what happens is abusive pastors lift themselves up to a position that is untouchable if you will you have no right to speak to them to correct them not that they ever say that because they'll say you know they'll say oh you come you come and you show when you correct me but the way they push you down beneath them to remain control over you prevents that open feedback that open communication but that is not God and that is not how God loves you then God doesn't love you because of what you do God loves you because of who you are you are his child you are his son you are his daughter and he loves you not because you go and you do this for him and you serve and you do this and you you all this stuff and you give him these praises no he loves you because of who you are he wants you to worship Him and wants you to praise Him but when you do something he doesn't brush you off no he's standing there waiting like a gentleman saying I love you well just come on just come on come over here to the balm of Gilead amen the balm in Gilead heals from brother abuse brother offending brother sister offending sister sometimes those can't those things can just really get to you and they can they can cause you to look at somebody I think well there's no way in any in any way that that person has the Holy Ghost what do you know what do you know so they offended you there's a balm in Gilead get over it and you know I say that lovingly right there's to you you can't become brother Brown says you know that it's often quoted there's weak characters built in the things that we suffer from suffering so people feel have to walk around suffering but the Bible says character comes through victory you're not called us to suffer there's there's a portion there's a time of mourning there's a time or you you you you go through a process and you mourn but God has provided a way for you to have victory over that and if you if you go beyond that and you hold on to it you're doing yourself a disservice and God is asking me the question why why why do you want to hold on to that wouldn't you rather hold on to the Holy Spirit wouldn't you rather because if you're listen as it were we only have room for one thing in our hands if you will right cuz you're we're not good at juggling sorry you might be good in the flesh but spiritually you're not good at juggling I'm just here to say that for you okay it can't juggle there's got to be one focus now because of this world and what we live in and we have to make money God says if you put your focus in me I'll take care of everything else around you but when we say well you know I got a I have to hold on to my job I have to hold on to my job my job is really important right if I'm holding this where's my focus my Hocus is on this okay I'm holding on this is my job I gotta keep my job a job well where's the Holy Ghost where's your word well it's over there on the shelf yeah it's not doing you any good and all this is doing is this bringing destruction to everything around you but if you hold on to the Word of God take it as as it were in front of you hold on to it everything else around you prospers everything else around you does good because you're a child of God and God's not gonna let you misbehave thank you lord that's the grace of God that is the grace of God that's why you can't that's why when you hold on to your job oh my goodness you get drug through the mud face-first because you're a child of God God says no you can't do that you need to be holding onto the Word of God in front of you and then you do a man then you realize everything just starts falling into place right and sometimes it falls out of place but that's cuz God's teaching you something but it's always it's always well with your soul because you know you know in your heart when you're holding on to your job you know in your heart when you got something else in front of you right you got some other Beelzebub or some Beelzebub something of the world something some anything that you hold above the Word of God you have created an idol out of that thing and that can be any number of things it can be your bitterness it can be the offense that someone did to you don't be a hater I don't don't don't don't go in and try to solve the problem some other way go to God and say this I'm holding this offense before me but I need you to apply the balm and Gillian razor Lorne being a Christian is messy it was messy when you were born and it's messy every day of your life but messy in a good way messianic good way brother Branham says in in why 1960 and then every one of us going to school he's talking about as a kid had to take a dose of castor oil so we'd feel all right for school Monday morning our systems all of that food we had to eat and I got I can't stand to stand to smell of the stuff yet and I every time I come on hold my nose I'd say mama I was the oldest I had to take it first I'd say oh mama I just gags me I just can't do it and she'd say if it doesn't make you sick it doesn't do you any good and that's the same way with the preaching of the gospel if it doesn't stir you up to make you sick enough it'll do you good it's a doctor's prescription it's what the doctor ordered hold your nose and take it that's the best thing it'll take starch out of you it'll do that it'll wilt you down it'll make you do things that you didn't think you would do it might make you a little messy but it'll certainly straighten you out sometimes we have to do things that are as children of God we have to take that caste royal sometimes and it gets a little messy but you know what that's alright because God is in it amen and God will bless you the balm in Gilead amen it always leaves a mark on you but the man says when you meet God you go away different you either go away worse or you go away better sometimes you have a cut or something that that's bad enough that you apply the ointment and it heals but there's still evidence of that cut on your arm or on your hand it's a scar but that scar doesn't mean that scar on your heart doesn't mean God doesn't love you it means God healed you and man it means God came and he applied the balm in Gilead to your heart and he gave you healing a scarves testified to healing and once a wound has become a scar and then I'm stealing this it becomes history the the the the I our brother preached one time he's talking about the earth and how deep down in the earth there's these these and sometimes on the outer layer of the earth your fossils scars of what happened in the past scars from the flood when the flood swept over the earth man but then though the earth grew up the earth Bluegreen over it but deep in under the layers of the earth is scars of that that happened but it's a it's a it's a history that that the earth has been through and has recovered if you will there's there's history there's marks in your life and in your heart that you had that you have overcome that God has healed that God has brought and now you can turn around and testify you see this you see this scar here yeah I almost lost my hand yeah but it's good to go now right God came along and He healed you now buh-bam says you want something that you have a hard time with are you struggle with the feeling wrong in your life God watch God turned that around and turned it into a testimony to go out and help someone else you never know if what you're going through you say I don't understand why I'm going through this maybe God is sending you through it so that you can turn around and help somebody else down the road you never know so instead of feeling sorry for yourself and wondering why you're the one always going through problems amen stand up and confess it and have faith and and go to God and say maybe there's something that you're trying to teach me here maybe this is for somebody down the road and stop feeling sorry for yourself praise the Lord help us lord I got you no fingers pointing back at me amen the balm in Gilead gives revelation which is the power to overcome you know that that's why brother never says revelation is more important to you than perhaps you realize because if you have revelation of something nobody can talk you out of it and that gives you the power to overcome feel the revelation of who you are in Christ and the devil comes along says no you're not you're this person who you used to be you can say no sorry get lost that looks I have a revelation of Who I am today if you have a revelation of and this is the one we use all the time the open word no one can come along and talk you out of who Christ is because you've met Christ no one can tell me that's not Isaac Nash I've met Isaac Nash I have revelation of who Isaac Nash is you can't come a long time no that's not Isaac now session Walter sorry yeah I don't know who you are or what you're talking about you're wrong right nothing can change that it's revelation that brings you the power to overcome the balm in Gilead brings justification in your life I heard on the radio appreciated a he was talking about they were talking about just or Naaman was a preacher but no justification they read some new new translation and and the way it sounded and he tried to explain stood justification as you know that means that you're forgiving completely and I thought oh what a shame justification means you never even did it in the first place god justifies you that means you God can't look in your past and see that thing because you've been justified it's not even there it's not even there it's empty you go back and you thinking where was that again it's not there Amen that balm in Gilead brings eternal life amen but the revelation brings power to overcome revelation brings eternal life see it all goes hand in hand I'd love the continuity of the scripture one thing leads to another which leads to another which then loops back and leads back to that again eternity right goes into continuous loop so the Word of God and I I preached a sermon one time and and I don't know I think it went over everyone's head and I might put that one to the shelf but you know if any of you like geometry in in school you had to do theorems basically this proved that proved that proved that right and that's that to me I see that in the Word of God this leads to that leaves and brother Brando said God's in math you know that and so so you look at that and you see well well I know this is true because this is true anyways I find that super fascinating it's just a little that was free that one was free so the revelation your faith and your trust in God brings a revelation that revelation brings the power to overcome that power to overcome amen what brings you into eternal life brings you to the other side brings you but it also brings you that power over come brings you into a relationship with God bridge into a closeness with God amen and then that closest with God plants the seed in your womb then God begins to grow and what are you bringing forth thank you for hurting that you're bringing forth Christ you say oh that kid looks just like his dad right you're bringing forward the attributes of Christ within you and revelation restores your soul because you you you fellows that you can have the who goes on your spirit every day of your life and go to hell but you get that Holy Spirit on your soul that's a revelation because God says I see his faith and so I'm going to circumcise him as a testimony of his faith and give him the Holy Ghost that's what God did with Abraham amen and so now that revelation of God that revelation of who he is brought restoration to your soul amen the early apostles had to have a revelation of Christ to move from the dispensation of the law to the dispensation of grace this all goes back to the balm in Gilead so if you think I just took this hard right we'll just hang on believers today have to have a revelation of who Christ is to move into the marriage of the Lamb you you cannot overcome this world without a revelation of who Christ is I'm sorry you can confess with your mouth you can talk about it you can discuss who you think God is but unless you have a revelation of who Christ is you will not overcome the world God sent His only Son to die for us I'm going to bachcha the scripture that we might have eternal life we read that Scripture we hear that scripture is it is read but do you realize that that was part of the opening of the word because the opening of the word is redemptions plan how can you accept the blood of Christ when you can't accept the redemption plan how can you accept a god and desire to live with somebody to live with Christ in this instance without knowing him and who he is you know you never how do I had our Lord help me you never want to open yourself up to someone in confidence unless you have trust in them but but you're never going to get anywhere in that relationship unless you find trust at some point and if you can't trust that person then you need to move on or or if you know they're the right one and you just have trust issues and you need to pray that God gives you the ability to trust so if you never desire to open yourself up people that they that they want they want the message this is goes back to the foolish version they want they wanted that rest they wanted that sleep they wanted they wanted that benefits that the fwice virgin had but they didn't want to go through the blood if you will and they didn't want to they didn't want to go in and receive the seed because praise the Lord and so so they will that they wanted to partake of that so you see these people their lives display to you not Christ but when you talk about the word their lips speak Christ's right you know sound I'm saying the concept the intellectual side of it and if you're not careful you'll become baffled by that but what it is is it's a lip service they have it in their head but they've never opened up their heart because Lord take it from my head down to my heart or their song right in order for me to go from your head to your heart you have to open your heart and you'll meet these people sometimes they're very hard they're hard why because the sphere of Christ the Spirit of Christ is not hard the Spirit of Christ is gentle and loving and humble not like home bless you brother no they stand up with their shoulders back as their child of the king with confidence in who they are but they're not arrogant but these people go around there's a hardness why is there a hardness because they don't have the Holy Ghost so their heart is hard where's Laura Wow okay they need the balm in Gilead we need it how Wow the how dare we point a finger we don't have the right to point a finger or forgive me I wasn't trying to put the finger but it's amen so the believer has to catch a revelation of who Christ is to move into the marriage of the lamb and the invitation has been extended cool you go go out into the highways and the byways and invite them to the marriage supper the invitation has been extended why would she come I bought an ox why won't you come III got married and I and I and and I can't come why wouldn't you come I bought a piece of land and I have to go look at it you know those are just excuses right maybe even lies excuses because they're too afraid of what going accepting the invitation will require of them God wants it all he doesn't want partial he wants it all at the at the judgment God will be asking the question why as a judge ready to administer punishment or or life or death on this here now were we in this in this day and age and on earth he asks why as a gentle lover who's trying to woo you he's extending his love and saying why do you hold on to this hurt I'm here to help you with it why do you hold on to this bitterness I'm here to and it's funny it's like it's like an animal when they get hurt right you're trying to go and help them but they they try to bite at you and attack you right and you're like I'm just trying to help you sometimes we do that with God and God says well why are you trying to attack why you worried why are you coming at me why are you blaming me I'm trying to help you I'm trying to reach out to you and apply the balm in Gilead he's asking us he's saying you know come away my love come away from the burdens of the world that that that afflict you coming to the balm in Gilead you don't have to be offended you don't have to be sick to need the balm of Gilead sometimes a stressful day you just need that bond you need to spend some time with your lover with Christ amen you know after a hard day you come home your wife gives you a big hug just melts that all the way no pastor it's the same one with Christ I was after a long day you think why why am I so stressed out and God just waiting there say put on a tape sing some mute some some some praises and come into that that that place with me praise the Lord amen so he's calling out he's calling out to you and he's asking why don't you answer I have invited you why don't you come praise the Lord sister and me if you come I'm wrapping this up amen so maybe there's some place in your life that God is asking you the question why why are you holding on to this why are you turning away from me why are you insisting upon being stubborn amen the fault lies on you the responsibility is on you and matter but the blessing is on you the blessing is on you sometimes sometimes we wonder we want to just look at the negative right oh well if you don't ask her answer God's call God can ask wine it's gonna sentence you to judgment what about the other side when God extends that and you receive that blessing what a wonderful place it is to live see whatsoever things that are good what's her things aren't pure you know think on these things think about the fact that God is extending you in love that balm in Gilead no not-not-not he's not extending it to you waiting for you being like if I get to him I bet you anything he's doing turning down and I'll be able to just that's not what he's doing she's genuine in his love it's unconditional love is what it is it's unconditional love and I rambled on tonight I hope something was said that spoke to your heart he's calls you he's calling you to come deeper and deeper and the balm in Gilead is there to bring you into that deeper relationship with Christ amen don't break his heart by making him ask why in your life he loves you just give in to his calling every single day of your life he's never going to stop calling on even when you've against you answered the call today praise the Lord tomorrow he's gonna call you again I don't just I didn't just an I just I didn't marry my wife kiss her at the altar and then go off and live my own no everyday I got to tell her I love her every day she tells me she loves me oh there's a kiss there's time spent together right why it's just strengthening that relationship that's the same way it is with God it meant spending that quality time with Christ because he loves you he loves you very much we didn't know that [Music] I could give to you your name there's a table dress the bank what's the rangers gather or a celebration there
