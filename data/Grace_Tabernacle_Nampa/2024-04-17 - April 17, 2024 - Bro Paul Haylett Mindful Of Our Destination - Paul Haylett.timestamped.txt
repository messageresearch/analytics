[23:59] [Music]
[24:00] I want to see
[24:07] Jesus you know I always appreciated the
[24:10] portion where brother brandham says that
[24:13] if you don't see Jesus Christ in every
[24:15] scripture go back and read it again
[24:19] because he's present in his word he's
[24:21] present in all things and I believe this
[24:24] message strongly enough to say now we
[24:28] understand there's an influence of men
[24:30] God never took that away goes all the
[24:32] way back through the prophets of old
[24:34] they were men made mistakes Etc so we
[24:38] have balance there but I I want to say
[24:41] this in the right context every drop of
[24:44] this message points me Jus
[24:48] Christ and we don't have to go some
[24:51] people say just listen to the tape I'm
[24:53] not making a point there but just listen
[24:55] to the tape because there's no influence
[24:57] of man
[24:59] but when it's the Holy Ghost
[25:01] speaking you will only see Christ in
[25:04] what is preached amen there is a filter
[25:07] the Holy Spirit takes those things out
[25:10] because we're not called to the man
[25:12] we're called to Christ and I say thank
[25:15] you Lord appreciate that brother Alex
[25:17] sister Ruth all of our musicians
[25:20] appreciate it this evening um yes we
[25:23] definitely want to be uh in remembrance
[25:25] of our our brother Chris sister Kristen
[25:28] tonight uh I don't know you know seems
[25:32] like uh once you get far down the road
[25:35] you kind of forget about how it is to be
[25:38] young and having children and all these
[25:41] things and and I'm like okay and then I
[25:44] today just felt in prayer it's like you
[25:46] know what Paul conjure up the memory how
[25:50] you know it is and and uh it's a
[25:53] difficult time a nervous time but we
[25:55] believe God's on this scene and they're
[25:57] going to have uh this beautiful baby
[26:01] amen and and we'll get a claim it uh as
[26:04] part of our family and a boy or girl uh
[26:08] well anyway who votes for the boys uh
[26:12] anyway it was so funny uh visiting with
[26:15] them the other day and and and you know
[26:18] to see the different kids and Rosie one
[26:20] minute it's like a a girl and then
[26:23] literally she comes running back in the
[26:24] room a boy so whatever the Lord has in
[26:28] store so we want to remember them in
[26:30] prayer amen I want to speak to you for a
[26:33] few minutes and and I hope that I can
[26:36] bring this all together the Lord would
[26:38] bring it together just reading in 70
[26:41] weeks of Daniel and uh come across these
[26:44] words that just kind of touched me and
[26:46] started my mind thinking uh uh oh it
[26:50] says on the screen they have a child oh
[26:52] my oh my 6:33 p.m. boy or girl
[27:00] we'll know in a minute amen wow
[27:03] wonderful 6:33 p.m. well thank you Lord
[27:07] It's all all is well all is healthy amen
[27:11] so anyway wonderful thank you Lord so as
[27:16] we look at these things that that we
[27:19] cover in the word sometimes you know the
[27:21] Lord uses certain things and as I was
[27:23] saying I'm reading in 70 weeks of Daniel
[27:26] and and these thoughts come and so let's
[27:29] turn to Hebrews 11 a very familiar
[27:31] scripture for us a very a mainstay I
[27:34] might say uh for Christians to put us in
[27:37] a position where we can really
[27:40] understand uh what faith is you know
[27:43] often times uh we we uh don't want to
[27:47] sound judgmental or
[27:48] narrow-minded but you know the message
[27:51] is so indelibly marked us that when when
[27:54] we would interact or conversation uh
[27:58] with others and they talk about
[28:00] different things Faith being one of
[28:02] those subjects you know we realize that
[28:04] that the the message has has the opening
[28:07] of the word has indelibly marked us to
[28:10] where we look at some of these things
[28:12] entirely different than the rest of the
[28:14] church world and and in that God has
[28:17] opened our eyes does it make us special
[28:19] no it makes us blessed that God would
[28:22] open our eyes it's not what we did it's
[28:25] what he shared with us and and we look
[28:28] look at these things in in Hebrews 11
[28:31] understanding faith my brother and
[28:33] sister knowing that it is a gift of God
[28:35] and God has given it liberally Amen to
[28:38] his children his bride especially she
[28:41] has confidence uh you know in in the
[28:44] word of God and what God's doing in this
[28:46] hour how he's calling us and I want to
[28:48] talk to you um on the topic of mindful
[28:53] of our
[28:54] destination and um we would just come
[28:56] back into that and look in Hebrews 11:8
[29:00] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[29:02] go out into a place which he should
[29:05] after reive for an inheritance obeyed
[29:09] and went out not knowing whether he went
[29:13] and you realize this is a very type of
[29:15] when we get saved we're going out into a
[29:18] world we've never experienced
[29:20] before when we were living in the world
[29:23] living in sin we become quite familiar
[29:27] with the actions reactions of the world
[29:29] we lived in but when God started to call
[29:32] us and we'll elaborate a little more
[29:34] later but when God started to call us
[29:36] Saints do you realize how much faith it
[29:38] took for you to cast off everything you
[29:41] had Security in everything that you
[29:44] thought gave you peace everything you
[29:46] thought made you happy everything that
[29:48] you thought was necessary your security
[29:52] you cast it all
[29:54] off and said I'm going to trust the Lord
[29:58] and we'll stop and say I wished I had
[30:01] Faith you have faith the very first
[30:05] steps that you took as a Christian were
[30:08] anchored in
[30:10] faith we didn't recognize it is
[30:13] Faith but God doesn't have to point out
[30:16] everything you know like a legal
[30:18] document with all the little yellow
[30:21] arrows notice note sign every one of
[30:25] those poting out God said I don't have
[30:27] to do that
[30:28] you're already going to take a step
[30:30] you're going to trust
[30:31] me and you're going to have an
[30:34] expression of faith not find Faith
[30:37] you're going to have an expression of
[30:40] Faith because faith is a gift from God
[30:42] right amen we we can't we can't create
[30:46] faith we only set an atmosphere that
[30:48] faith is expressed in
[30:52] amen not knowing whether he went by
[30:55] faith he sojourned in the land of
[30:57] promise
[30:58] as in a strange country did you catch
[31:01] that often times we read over this he's
[31:04] in the land of promise as though it was
[31:06] a strange
[31:07] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[31:10] Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of
[31:13] the same promise for he looked for a
[31:16] city which hath foundations whose
[31:18] Builder and maker is God through faith
[31:21] also Sarah herself received strength to
[31:23] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[31:26] child when she was p age because she
[31:29] judged him faithful who had promised
[31:32] therefore sprang there even of one and
[31:36] him as good as dead so many as the stars
[31:39] of the sky in multitude and as the sand
[31:42] which is by the seashore innumerable
[31:46] these all died in faith not having
[31:48] received the
[31:49] promises
[31:51] H died in faith they're not going to get
[31:54] there and say well you didn't receive
[31:57] the promise so you're
[32:00] excluded no their faith that's it
[32:03] captured the promise amen so by faith
[32:08] the promise was actually fulfilled in
[32:11] them without the actual physical
[32:13] manifestation of the promise did that
[32:15] make sense God looked at it and says
[32:18] done amen I want him to look at us
[32:20] tonight done amen
[32:24] hallelujah but having seen them AAR off
[32:27] and were persuaded of them and embrac
[32:29] them and confessed that they were
[32:31] strangers and pilgrims on the earth for
[32:33] they that say such things declare
[32:37] plainly that they seek a country and
[32:39] truly if they had been mindful of the
[32:41] country from whence they came out they
[32:43] might have had opportunity to have
[32:46] returned but now they desire a better
[32:49] country that is a Heavenly can we say
[32:52] Amen to that tonight amen our country is
[32:55] not a better Nation amen the prophet
[32:57] said Abraham Lincoln uh and and George
[33:01] Washington on every country every corner
[33:03] won't change the direction of the
[33:04] country and it's becoming more and more
[33:07] and more evident in the world my brother
[33:09] and sister I don't care what great
[33:11] leader there is or what dominant leader
[33:13] there was in any Nation amen I I
[33:17] abbreviated this down tonight because it
[33:19] carries out but the word also declares
[33:22] that they would come to a time that
[33:24] their Harvest would not be fruitful
[33:27] we're looking at the promised word
[33:29] coming to pass the Harvest of this world
[33:31] of politics and Country and dominance
[33:34] all coming to not we pick on no country
[33:38] because it's not about country but
[33:40] countries that that put fear into people
[33:43] are are now showing that there's uh
[33:45] something not right something's not
[33:48] happening our great nation once dominant
[33:50] is mocked in the world today so the
[33:53] Harvest that man is looking for is
[33:55] coming to not but the bride of Christ is
[33:59] right in her midst amen I just get a
[34:01] little excited and get ahead of it she's
[34:03] been grafted in and the season of our
[34:06] grafting is close to
[34:09] finished and when that comes to
[34:12] fruition it's cut out and Israel the
[34:16] real Jew is grafted back in isn't God
[34:21] gracious and loving and kind to us amen
[34:24] we had no place but he grafted it this
[34:27] in amen Heavenly Father we thank you
[34:30] tonight for Your Love Your Grace your
[34:31] mercy for grafting Us in Lord help us
[34:34] father to be concise and Lord be able to
[34:37] express this what's uh in our heart Lord
[34:39] we ask you to be with each and every one
[34:41] that's not here tonight uh our sisters
[34:44] our brothers Lord whatever circumstance
[34:46] would be Lord just be with each one
[34:49] father make your presence known we love
[34:51] you and adore you and we appreciate what
[34:53] you do for us father ask us now we ask
[34:56] you father to just speak speak in the
[34:58] name of Jesus Christ amen
[35:01] hallelujah amen so there it is if they'd
[35:03] been mindful in that country from when
[35:05] you may be seated from that country when
[35:07] they came out they might have had
[35:09] opportunity to have returned now I I
[35:13] just say this kind of straightforward
[35:15] tonight have you had opportunity to
[35:18] return to the country you came out of
[35:20] it's before us every single day an
[35:23] opportunity to just lay down the word
[35:26] sometimes Satan will just beat on us
[35:28] he'll he'll speak he's derogatory he's
[35:30] undermining all of these things and we
[35:33] have opportunity to return back there
[35:35] there's nothing to stop us from
[35:38] returning back but the Holy Ghost amen
[35:41] there's a there is the Paramount thing
[35:43] that keeps us amen cuz you see they
[35:46] couldn't return because they had a
[35:48] desire for a better country their desire
[35:51] that they had overruled any circumstance
[35:54] and disappointment that they might have
[35:56] had so this better country my brother
[35:58] and sister as we know there's no perfect
[36:00] country on the Earth today I do find it
[36:03] interesting uh whatever continent you
[36:05] would travel to and and I I think it's a
[36:08] good thing that people are are are fond
[36:10] or uh you know uh patriotic as it would
[36:13] be that that our country is the best you
[36:16] know I say this with a little bit of
[36:18] humor you go to Africa and they tell you
[36:21] that in heaven they're going to be
[36:23] speaking Africans you go to South
[36:26] America tell you they're going to speak
[36:28] Spanish and you get over in other
[36:31] countries you know and they'll tell you
[36:33] you know uh uh it's going to sound you
[36:36] know like those in Australia and you
[36:39] know it it's good to have a a little bit
[36:42] uh of that and you know there's a little
[36:44] humor we could share on that but we'll
[36:46] pass over tonight so it's good for us to
[36:48] be happy but you see every nation
[36:52] Kindred tongue and God did not start I
[36:55] had a brother one time I believe that
[36:57] was in South Africa told me he says
[36:59] brother Paul he says a Africa starts
[37:03] with a United States starts with you
[37:07] you've got to go through almost every
[37:09] language on Earth to get to you and so
[37:13] you know it's good I I like that but you
[37:15] see it doesn't matter because I'm not of
[37:17] this Earth you're not of this Earth
[37:19] We're Not of these nations we are Sons
[37:21] and Daughters of God called Before the
[37:23] Throne of almighty God in the mind of
[37:26] God he has placed us and you know um the
[37:29] Lord one thing I think is so wonderful
[37:31] my brother and sister wherever we might
[37:33] travel or not travel too much it doesn't
[37:36] matter but you see the Lord being so
[37:38] gracious is not just thinking of our
[37:41] journey sometimes we you know in the in
[37:44] the things of life we we get up and
[37:46] there's struggles and and you know
[37:48] there's difficulties and there's
[37:50] challenges however you want to word it
[37:52] find all the adjectives adverbs whatever
[37:54] you want to uh put in there that that we
[37:56] face but my brother and sister as we
[37:59] look at this you see God's not just
[38:01] looking at the struggle of today or
[38:03] yesterday or last month or last year
[38:05] God's not just looking at this journey
[38:08] that we're going through right now you
[38:10] know we should enjoy actually enjoy this
[38:12] journey you realize that being a
[38:15] Christian and having the Holy Ghost does
[38:17] not preclude you from enjoying this
[38:20] journey but you see it's not all just
[38:22] about the journey it's about the
[38:25] destination and so the Lord is here with
[38:28] us he desires uh I believe with all of
[38:31] my heart I believe that God desires for
[38:33] us to have a good journey he desires for
[38:35] us to have a journey where we can have
[38:37] joy and laughter and happiness and these
[38:40] things are there but it's also in this
[38:42] journey as the prophet of God if you
[38:44] don't mind me kind of amalgamating some
[38:46] things together it's in this journey
[38:48] that our character is molded if we do
[38:51] nothing my brother and sister our
[38:53] character will be nothing and so it's
[38:56] there in the labor it is the labor that
[38:59] makes the man it's not the man who makes
[39:01] the labor and so if we do not have any
[39:04] Challenge and we do not face you might
[39:07] say uh failure uh sometimes it's hard to
[39:11] just uh you know uh group these verbiage
[39:14] together and make it sound correct but
[39:17] you know sometimes we just simply have
[39:18] to have failure you know how you get
[39:20] better at something look at it from the
[39:22] natural here it would be very simple
[39:25] when when you fail
[39:28] and you have a desire you go back and
[39:31] you give more of yourself to
[39:33] it and that is a very close type to the
[39:37] spiritual tonight we don't even have to
[39:40] ask which of us have had struggles that
[39:42] we have failed at things in our life
[39:44] that that we uh do the scripture in some
[39:47] places kind of declares it as besetting
[39:49] sins uh some things it's there Paul said
[39:52] it was a thorn uh whatever you want to
[39:55] look at it tonight I I won't determine
[39:57] or interpret that for you but in there
[39:59] comes a time and a place that you have
[40:01] to make a decision do I quit now or do I
[40:05] press on and it's in the pressing on my
[40:08] brother and sister is how we fulfill the
[40:10] journey and this Christian walk that we
[40:12] live in you know I I remember as a young
[40:15] kid you would hear it you know people
[40:16] would say well when I got saved I
[40:18] thought all my challenge was over but I
[40:20] found out that it was actually greater
[40:22] but you see it's in the molding of that
[40:25] character that allows us to reach the
[40:27] the destination without that character
[40:29] we do not cross over we do not overcome
[40:33] now the Lord knew that we as Christians
[40:35] as young people or young in spiritual
[40:38] maturity had to come to a place of a
[40:41] certain level of maturity before God in
[40:44] essence would open the Hedge and let
[40:46] Satan Blas you and it without that
[40:49] maturity if we're just a very beginning
[40:51] Christian in in that Utopia time uh and
[40:55] we get blasted with some of the
[40:57] challenges you have faced this last
[41:00] year you you would be overwhelmed but
[41:04] God allowed you to build up he prepared
[41:06] you in the journey and now my brother
[41:09] and sister as our sister Sue has shared
[41:11] with me many many times I've gone too
[41:14] far to turn back now amen we can see we
[41:17] can see the city we can see the
[41:20] destination it's too close it's become
[41:23] too great in our eyes for us to stop and
[41:26] say I'm going to turn away if someone
[41:29] has journeyed for many years and turned
[41:32] away and says I just not going on I've
[41:35] decided this is not for me my brother
[41:37] and sister it wasn't the challenge of
[41:39] that day but it was a lack of
[41:41] preparation for the challenge which is
[41:43] prayer and reading our Bible Etc being
[41:46] in the word when we quit being prepared
[41:49] my brother and sister the enemy starts
[41:51] preparing amen but when we're prepared
[41:54] the enemy knows there's no way he can
[41:56] overcome
[41:57] and so he is not able he might challenge
[42:00] or try to stumble you but he knows he's
[42:02] not Victorious cannot be victorious so
[42:05] we see that it's really not an issue of
[42:09] you know somehow the the message failed
[42:11] us or the Bible or God failed us my
[42:14] brother and sister but it can be a
[42:16] challenge my brother and sister that we
[42:18] have failed oursel a perfect example
[42:20] many years ago and and I I just remember
[42:23] this as as kind of a a staggering
[42:26] thought the video is out there it was a
[42:29] uh kind of marathon or whatever uh a
[42:33] race and here is a man that is I I
[42:36] believe he was African but I believe you
[42:39] know Nigeria something like that and he
[42:42] had run to exhaustion and he's not here
[42:44] to the back door of the sanctuary from
[42:46] the finish line and he is completely
[42:50] physically given out but the thing that
[42:53] mattered most is in the physical failing
[42:56] him
[42:57] it had overpowered him mentally and he
[43:01] said I'm finished there was a little
[43:04] confusion because at the Finish Line
[43:06] there was a curve but the next Runner
[43:08] that comes was there coming strongly and
[43:11] when he rounds that corner and sees the
[43:13] man who has led him the whole
[43:15] race he doesn't see opportunity to say
[43:18] I'll beat him right here but to the uh
[43:21] shock of the whole crowd he stops puts
[43:24] his arm around this man walks him within
[43:28] a couple feet of the finish line and
[43:31] pushes him across and people said why
[43:35] did you do that you could have won this
[43:37] prestigious PRI prize here and he said
[43:40] would I have really
[43:42] won but you see this bride of Christ
[43:45] when she is rejuvenated by the word day
[43:49] by day when the Holy Spirit moving upon
[43:52] her giving her strength day by day my
[43:56] brother and sister it's not another man
[43:58] in the race that's pushing us across the
[44:00] line but it's the Holy Spirit coming
[44:03] right down saying just keep going you
[44:06] can do it your flesh has failed you but
[44:10] I will not fail you the man who was
[44:13] there that pushed him across the line
[44:15] they said why didn't you do that and he
[44:17] said because I knew what my mama would
[44:22] say he had so much respect for his
[44:24] mother and the upbringing that he had
[44:27] now let me turn this just a little bit
[44:29] how much respect do we have for the
[44:32] teaching and the mentoring and the
[44:35] encouraging of the holy spirit amen we
[44:38] should look at that and not look down on
[44:40] that that's what Satan's trying to bring
[44:42] us to a place that if we see a brother
[44:44] or sister struggling we pass them by and
[44:46] say I wonder what's wrong with them but
[44:48] may us may we have a a a respect for the
[44:52] Holy Spirit to come and say you know
[44:55] what that's my brother that's that's my
[44:57] sister Son of God daughter of God we
[45:01] will not pass you by we will not
[45:03] disrespect God in you but we're going to
[45:05] help you across the line maybe you will
[45:07] not say a single word to them maybe you
[45:10] will not touch them physically in any
[45:13] form or fashion but you will pray for
[45:15] them and you will uh uh beseech the
[45:18] Throne of God and say Lord that's my
[45:21] brother that's struggling that's my
[45:22] sister that's struggling this young
[45:24] person this teenager is struggling we
[45:27] don't automatically say oh I guess they
[45:29] just don't have what it takes no we stop
[45:32] and we do our best to get them across
[45:35] the line because that was the
[45:36] destination of everyone in that race and
[45:39] it's the destination of everyone in this
[45:41] race my brother and sister to hear the
[45:43] words well done my good and faithful
[45:45] servant to be able to stand and look
[45:47] upon the Lord and I know it won't be
[45:49] that way but just bear with me without
[45:51] some nagging little thing of the brother
[45:54] or sister that we kicked out of our way
[45:59] don't
[46:00] push
[46:02] grab take a hold of them Satan you can't
[46:06] have them they belong to the Lord and
[46:10] right now I'm God's hands and his feet
[46:14] and I'm his
[46:15] voice and I beseech the Throne of
[46:18] almighty God and I rebuke you Satan for
[46:21] trying to distract or Draw this one away
[46:24] and so the Lord is so gracious he's not
[46:26] just is thinking of our journey but he's
[46:28] mindful of our destination and you know
[46:31] sometimes we can say these words and I
[46:33] found in my own life that we can say
[46:36] well the Lord's in
[46:38] control we can say the words but
[46:40] sometimes down deep in our heart it
[46:42] doesn't feel like the Lord's in control
[46:44] it doesn't feel like anything's in
[46:48] control and Satan comes and says oh yeah
[46:52] oh yeah so everything's in control in
[46:54] your world right now and and you have to
[46:57] be honest and say no it doesn't seem
[46:59] like everything's in control but you see
[47:01] every aspect of our journey God if he
[47:04] would reveal to us the
[47:07] book wouldn't you really like to look in
[47:09] the
[47:11] book cuz in the book we would say well
[47:14] this just blindsided me this happened to
[47:17] this or this happened here H and uh you
[47:20] know I I just kind of was
[47:23] blindsided if God was to open up the
[47:25] book you would see
[47:27] they said you're going to come through a
[47:28] great time of
[47:30] trial great great
[47:34] struggle your fiery
[47:37] furnace is going to come upon
[47:40] you but if I could say it figuratively
[47:42] he'd Turn the Page and he'd say but you
[47:45] overcome that's right you see if we
[47:48] really saw the book God never showed the
[47:50] book to job job had to live the book
[47:54] amen we have to live the book Saints but
[47:57] let's have faith that the next page says
[48:00] that we overcome amen that we're more
[48:03] than Overcomers that's what the next
[48:06] page says don't don't try to get caught
[48:08] in the moment but look to the fact this
[48:11] part of the journey is rough but the
[48:13] destination's in
[48:14] sight amen wars and rumors of wars and
[48:18] we could go all through that the prophet
[48:20] of God talking about this my brother and
[48:22] sister it's just amazing how it's now
[48:24] open but so veiled now we see how that
[48:28] Israel's eyes were closed their ears
[48:30] were stopped so that they would stop
[48:33] their their progression you might say
[48:35] and their position and then we as
[48:38] grafted in we come and the life started
[48:41] to flow through you and I aren't you
[48:42] glad it's flowing through us tonight and
[48:44] and so it's there that Israel they
[48:47] couldn't see they can't hear they don't
[48:49] know what it is my brother and sister
[48:51] but look how when it comes to the right
[48:53] season that is switched back again and
[48:57] my brother and sister you look at this
[48:58] today our a country and I'm not
[49:01] preaching on the economy and presidents
[49:03] none of that really matters but we're
[49:05] looking now and look how it is that they
[49:07] start to talk things like well our our
[49:10] nation can handle 35 trillion billion
[49:14] whatever dollars of debt do you realize
[49:16] the collected taxes right now are not
[49:20] very far from not being able to pay the
[49:22] interest on our debt when the I I I just
[49:26] love their bookkeeping imagine you ran
[49:28] your house the way they run this nation
[49:31] we saved $40
[49:34] billion but we're actually spending 140
[49:37] billion
[49:38] more but it's 40 less 40 billion less
[49:41] than what we wanted to spend so they
[49:44] call that savings you imagine what our
[49:46] savings accounts would look like on that
[49:48] right there well we wanted a brand new
[49:51] Lexus and a brand new this and a brand
[49:53] new that and a brand new that and I I
[49:54] want an airplane and a boat and a train
[49:56] and a plane
[49:57] but I only bought a new car so I
[49:59] therefore save
[50:01] $300,000 take that one to the bank but
[50:05] it's all
[50:06] necessary see their ears have been
[50:10] stopped their understanding is stopped
[50:13] because they're fulfilling a prophet's
[50:16] voice that said and
[50:19] America will be
[50:24] bankrupt now at the time you could say
[50:26] that was fulfilled a long time ago but
[50:28] we're talking I believe this is Paul's
[50:30] opinion but we're talking about a true
[50:33] un sustainable
[50:36] unfixable
[50:37] bankruptcy where it's gone so far beyond
[50:41] there's not a hope that when the
[50:43] Antichrist comes and says this is the
[50:45] terms they have no choice but to accept
[50:50] them this is where we're going Saints
[50:53] but this is where we're going Hallelujah
[50:55] we got a destination they got a
[50:57] destination but God's looking at this
[50:59] journey because he's molding character
[51:01] in US amen can we lift a hand and say
[51:03] Lord mold my character tonight I want my
[51:06] character to match your word Lord I
[51:09] don't want to think I'm right or I'm
[51:11] okay or this is good enough I am
[51:15] striving I am going to step out and take
[51:18] a halt of your word because my life will
[51:21] be a reflection of your
[51:24] word amen no imitation
[51:30] but you see God already put in place the
[51:33] antidote now a rough definition of
[51:36] antidote is the remedy another rough
[51:39] definition of antidote is the
[51:41] solution you see God's already put in
[51:44] place the antidote my brother and sister
[51:46] we as Sons and Daughters of God are
[51:47] sitting here tonight we should not feel
[51:50] hopeless we should not feel like we got
[51:52] to give up amen the devil when you feel
[51:54] like giving up and the devil slaps me
[51:56] with with this one pretty regular when
[51:58] you feel like giving up recognize that's
[52:01] the devil that's standing there beating
[52:04] on you that's not who you are that's not
[52:07] your heart that's not your soul that's
[52:10] not your mind that's the devil saying
[52:13] quit amen because he knows but God's
[52:16] already given us the antidote the remedy
[52:19] to this and he said when you come in the
[52:21] time of trouble and we won't go into all
[52:23] the scripture reference you know your
[52:25] Bible but it comes in all the time of
[52:28] trouble amen what does the word say it
[52:31] says apply the word amen amen take the
[52:35] hsip and put it over the door my brother
[52:38] and sister you can uh uh create the
[52:41] barrier that keeps Satan from
[52:44] controlling your life amen so we apply
[52:46] the word and do you know that
[52:49] Christ is our
[52:51] hunger
[52:54] amen those of you know the message I
[52:56] don't even need to to go bear through
[52:59] that the prophet of God tells us that
[53:02] you never found God God found you amen
[53:09] so he is our hunger when we hunger for
[53:13] righteousness amen he's hungering
[53:15] through US amen amen when we
[53:18] thirst it's not our thirst it's his
[53:22] thirst thirsting through us
[53:26] amen
[53:28] hallelujah as it is the pipe cannot say
[53:31] this is my
[53:34] water all it can say is I have been
[53:37] called upon to deliver this
[53:41] water to hold this water transfer this
[53:46] water that's right and so here we are
[53:49] today he's our hunger he is our thirst
[53:52] and you know we have looking back here
[53:54] in Hebrews 11 my brother and sister we
[53:57] have a hunger or thirst the scripture
[53:59] says a desire a better country we have a
[54:02] hunger and a thirst for a better country
[54:06] amen not for a better house amen God
[54:08] bless those that live in a nice home and
[54:11] can drive a nice car and do all these
[54:12] things we're not talking about that
[54:14] level but we're looking at a place that
[54:16] there's something inside of us that says
[54:19] you know what Lord no matter how how
[54:22] good a house I live in how good a car I
[54:24] drive how much money got in the bank
[54:27] Lord there's something I'm thirsting for
[54:30] there's a life that I want more than
[54:32] this here that is drawing me and calling
[54:35] me amen so it's not a house that's been
[54:39] built with our
[54:43] hands he is our desire
[54:48] amen you know when we're out in the
[54:52] world there's a lot of things you
[54:55] desire we have to be careful we give our
[54:57] heart to the Lord that somewhere along
[55:00] the line we have to take the
[55:02] hatchet are we allowed to use violent
[55:07] terms we have to cut its head
[55:10] off right not hold the hatchet up and
[55:13] say let's have a peace
[55:15] treaty that was Israel's problem over
[55:18] and over and over again God told them go
[55:20] slay these people wipe them off and they
[55:23] went over there and turned them into
[55:24] slaves and took them home with them
[55:25] right and it wasn't long their sons were
[55:27] marrying them and their daughters were
[55:29] marrying them and then they said how how
[55:33] did Sin get in the
[55:35] camp see in their Journey they lost
[55:38] sight of their
[55:40] destination and it just become what we
[55:42] call life do any of you just live life
[55:45] sometimes you know I mean sometimes I
[55:48] get pretty pretty
[55:50] bluy as brother jeel would say wowy wowy
[55:54] wooy get up in the morning morning go to
[55:57] work come home tired eat go to bed get
[56:02] up in the morning go to work come home
[56:05] tired eat go to
[56:08] bed am I the only one in here that that
[56:11] kind of gets to you after a while thank
[56:13] you I have some
[56:15] allies I thought maybe I might be
[56:17] strange and we start to look at it and
[56:19] start to think
[56:21] Lord what what is this all about
[56:28] I read a deal that was written by a
[56:29] denominational Pastor back
[56:32] east as something on the order I I will
[56:35] have forgotten more of it than I
[56:38] remember something on the order he
[56:40] titled it the day of a thousand
[56:43] eyes it's almost like a poem I went out
[56:47] today and a few eyes saw me leave my
[56:52] home I went to
[56:54] town a few eyes
[56:57] saw me on the
[56:58] street I went to the market and walked
[57:01] the
[57:02] aisles and a few eyes saw me
[57:07] there and he goes on through every part
[57:10] I stopped at the gas station and some
[57:13] eyes saw me
[57:15] there I went home
[57:18] today some eyes saw
[57:23] me what did they see
[57:29] yeah
[57:31] it he doesn't say anything about talking
[57:34] to
[57:36] anyone but we know enough of the word to
[57:39] know they saw Christ walking in their
[57:41] midst amen because we are living
[57:44] Epistles amen amen so we're Desiring a
[57:48] house not built with hands and when we
[57:51] come to the place that he is our desire
[57:54] amen a desire is a strong feeling
[57:57] there's a lot of definitions you you can
[57:59] draw these from the abstract to the
[58:01] modern but he is our desire my brother
[58:04] and sister so he is our strong feeling
[58:06] it's not at time I I spoke about this at
[58:09] a at the uh uh a couples's banquet up in
[58:13] Canada but my brother and sister we got
[58:15] to get over the fact that we feel an
[58:17] obligation to serve God and we got to
[58:20] start focusing on it is a privilege to
[58:23] serve God Amen cuz when Satan gets us
[58:26] into the obligation portion then we
[58:29] suddenly are no joy no no excitement
[58:33] nothing really pushing us we feel
[58:35] obligated to do this and and so it comes
[58:38] to a time we got to get over the
[58:40] obligation and realize God's given us a
[58:42] privilege to serve him we have become
[58:45] privileged to live or Express the word
[58:48] of God now my brother and sister God
[58:50] knowing what we need can we say God
[58:53] knows what I need amen there's an known
[58:56] hunger remember when you weren't
[58:59] saved there was something inside there
[59:01] you tried to satisfy it here there yawn
[59:04] but nothing would satisfy this unknown
[59:07] hunger the reason I call it unknown
[59:08] hunger is because you could not really
[59:11] identify what was missing but you knew
[59:13] something was and so it's this unknown
[59:16] hunger in you but you see now I hope you
[59:19] follow me it actually was one of the
[59:22] first Revelations that ever was revealed
[59:25] to you by the Holy Spirit and that was
[59:28] the revelation of what that hunger
[59:31] really was when you realized it was a
[59:34] hunger for God Amen that's a pretty
[59:36] startling revelation we we just gloss
[59:39] right over that and go on but that would
[59:41] be one of the very first times in your
[59:44] life that God give Revelation to you
[59:47] when it was at an altar in a service in
[59:49] a living room in your own bedroom
[59:51] kneeling in the floor whatever it might
[59:53] have been that you realize I need God in
[59:57] my life that my brother and sister is a
[1:00:00] powerful Revelation but it shouldn't be
[1:00:03] a historic Revelation it should be a
[1:00:05] revelation that's alive today it should
[1:00:08] be a revelation that this morning we got
[1:00:11] out of bed and said I need God in my
[1:00:14] life I need more of you Lord but if we
[1:00:17] put it historic we'll say well I've been
[1:00:19] a Christian for 40
[1:00:21] years what's that got to do with it
[1:00:23] that's right are you a Christian right
[1:00:25] now will you be a Christian in the next
[1:00:27] moment in the next day in the next week
[1:00:30] month year that's what matters my
[1:00:32] brother and sister not what we were 40
[1:00:34] years ago but to understand how
[1:00:36] beautiful and I hope I'm explaining this
[1:00:38] well enough to understand that
[1:00:40] Revelation right there is a tremendously
[1:00:43] beautiful Revelation that God gave us
[1:00:46] it's not slavery it's not
[1:00:50] bondage it's liberty
[1:00:53] amen because we realize
[1:00:56] I can live so sorry to take such a
[1:00:59] drastic
[1:01:01] example I know a man he's still living
[1:01:03] but I haven't seen him for a
[1:01:05] bit smoked so much that his fingers were
[1:01:08] yellow from the
[1:01:11] nicotine well into his 60s I don't
[1:01:13] remember had a heart problem the doctor
[1:01:15] got through to him and said if you want
[1:01:18] to live to see your grandbabies grow up
[1:01:21] you've got to stop
[1:01:23] this and the man
[1:01:26] cold turkey quits
[1:01:28] smoking starts feeling better doctor
[1:01:31] reminding him every day that you don't
[1:01:34] every cigarette you don't smoke adds so
[1:01:36] many minutes to your
[1:01:38] life and next thing you know he's eating
[1:01:41] healthy I need to take his example he
[1:01:44] developed an appetite for
[1:01:50] vegetables but he used the words he said
[1:01:53] I caught a revelation
[1:01:56] of what nicotine meant to
[1:01:59] me hope you can follow this or I can
[1:02:02] clarify this I used to think nicotine
[1:02:06] was my
[1:02:07] life but I got a revelation one day that
[1:02:12] my wife my children my
[1:02:15] grandchildren is not a Christian
[1:02:18] unfortunately there
[1:02:21] life that was death that's it he come to
[1:02:26] that kind of Revelation without
[1:02:28] God but you see God in his infinite
[1:02:31] grace and mercy came to you and I and
[1:02:33] showed us that out there is not life
[1:02:35] that's death this is life thank you Lord
[1:02:38] for that kind of Revelation amen amen
[1:02:40] that we could come and not only that but
[1:02:43] he come and said I've not only ordained
[1:02:45] you to life but to get you to your
[1:02:47] destination you don't need to just quit
[1:02:49] this and quit that and come here and go
[1:02:52] there and whatever what you need is the
[1:02:54] pure unadulterated ated word to make it
[1:02:57] to your destination and God knew what it
[1:02:59] would take for us to make it to the
[1:03:01] destination and he started giving that
[1:03:03] to us hey if you're born in the message
[1:03:06] and you still get saved yes born in the
[1:03:10] message doesn't make you saved amen you
[1:03:14] are born in the message you get saved
[1:03:17] and God takes you on and fills you with
[1:03:19] the holy spirit opens his word to you
[1:03:22] you realize what kind of privilege God
[1:03:25] has given to you amen he Has Lifted you
[1:03:29] up to the pedestal of pedestals to say
[1:03:32] this is a son a daughter and I'm going
[1:03:35] to keep them pure all the days of their
[1:03:37] life I'm going to give them the word the
[1:03:39] Holy Spirit I'm going to take them in a
[1:03:41] Rapture I'm going to set him down at my
[1:03:43] throne and I'm going to call him my
[1:03:45] bride amen oh my brother and sister that
[1:03:48] is the Pinnacle of all things it's one
[1:03:51] thing to be the crudest of Sinners and
[1:03:54] be saved but I tell you you my brother
[1:03:56] and sister I believe higher than that is
[1:03:59] how the word can get a halts of a young
[1:04:01] life and take them and hold them and
[1:04:03] take them through leoa and bring them up
[1:04:06] in the end pure righteous and holy
[1:04:09] before God Amen Hallelujah and I don't
[1:04:11] know if God looks at it the way I do I
[1:04:13] can't hardly expect him to but I tell
[1:04:15] you my brother and sister let's flip the
[1:04:17] coin over I'm glad that when a person
[1:04:20] can tell God no over and over and over
[1:04:23] and over again and God will would still
[1:04:26] come back and say you're my son come now
[1:04:31] and you have to obey because the word is
[1:04:34] not speaking to this flesh it's speaking
[1:04:36] to this soul and he said that's my soul
[1:04:40] and I'm not going to lose a one oh thank
[1:04:43] you
[1:04:44] Lord
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:48] oh look you know one of the critics of
[1:04:50] the message or you know one of the
[1:04:52] spirits of critics you know as they
[1:04:54] think we're out here with you know uh
[1:04:56] Jesus plus the message amen I'll tell
[1:05:00] you what my brother and sister it's only
[1:05:02] him amen not Jesus plus something amen
[1:05:06] not the message plus something not the
[1:05:09] word plus something it's Christ and
[1:05:11] Christ Alone there's where the word has
[1:05:14] come and it's in the power and authority
[1:05:17] of that word amen the sun stand still at
[1:05:20] the word amen demons flee at the word
[1:05:24] amen it's there that God is doing this
[1:05:26] work and every bit of it's recorded in
[1:05:29] the word
[1:05:30] amen hallelujah is it okay to be excited
[1:05:37] tonight the unfailing realities of the
[1:05:40] Living
[1:05:41] God the Holy Spirit comes today in like
[1:05:44] manner to present God to man but man
[1:05:47] wants to go to
[1:05:49] church I always I I found this very
[1:05:52] interesting right because we'll say' no
[1:05:53] I went to church to find God
[1:05:58] Prophet doesn't correlate
[1:06:00] that it drowns his
[1:06:04] thinking he cannot fathom it we must
[1:06:07] learn that God is not known by
[1:06:08] intellectual conception God is known by
[1:06:11] the New Birth by the Holy Ghost not by
[1:06:15] any other way Jesus the Bible has
[1:06:18] plainly quoted us that no man can call
[1:06:20] Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:26] the Bible's very judgmental yes
[1:06:29] sir we live in an age don't judge me
[1:06:32] don't judge me well I'm sorry if you
[1:06:34] refuse to be judged by the
[1:06:37] word there's no hope that's
[1:06:41] right some people say well I my God is a
[1:06:44] loving God to me this is love that's
[1:06:47] exactly right my little mind my soul
[1:06:50] says he loved me enough pull me out of
[1:06:53] the muck and the mire that's right
[1:06:55] washed me off not with a dainty little
[1:06:57] sponge and a
[1:06:59] feather but he set me up there and
[1:07:02] blasted it
[1:07:04] off and as I've often mentioned my
[1:07:06] little grandmother we would go stay with
[1:07:09] her she cleaned my elbows as a kid not
[1:07:12] with a washcloth but with a Brill pad
[1:07:15] cuz she said no grandson of mine is
[1:07:17] going to have dirty elbows they might be
[1:07:19] bleeding elbows but they're not going to
[1:07:20] be dirty
[1:07:22] elbows and she was sincere I can
[1:07:24] remember I'm it created a habit of my
[1:07:27] life that you know it's like yeah no
[1:07:29] they're clean okay yeah now my dear
[1:07:33] grandmother I love her and she she was
[1:07:35] very emphatic now if my grandmother
[1:07:39] could feel that way about her
[1:07:41] grandson how much more the Holy Spirit
[1:07:44] wants you and I
[1:07:46] clean now do you want him to use a
[1:07:48] little soft Rag and a
[1:07:50] feather or do you want the Brillo of the
[1:07:53] word and people say well that preacher
[1:07:56] is
[1:07:57] abrasive well maybe it wasn't the
[1:08:00] preacher at
[1:08:01] all maybe the Holy Spirit had the brill
[1:08:04] pad and the preacher there I don't know
[1:08:07] why I'm saying this I don't know why I'm
[1:08:08] doing this this is
[1:08:10] foolishness and then we all say
[1:08:13] Amen because that's what God said no man
[1:08:17] can call Jesus the Christ only by the
[1:08:19] Holy Ghost and if you've never received
[1:08:21] the Holy Ghost you don't know that he is
[1:08:24] the Christ for that's the only way he
[1:08:27] reveals himself oh come on this is
[1:08:29] really straightforward my brother and
[1:08:31] sister and I don't want to try and add
[1:08:33] to it but it's here that people living
[1:08:36] any old kind of Life are saying the Lord
[1:08:39] told
[1:08:42] me you know the words that I can assure
[1:08:45] that any person in any condition the
[1:08:47] Lord told
[1:08:50] them
[1:08:52] repent and be baptized right
[1:08:56] anybody can say that and I'm going to
[1:08:57] believe them the Lord told me to repent
[1:08:59] and get baptized I believe you but when
[1:09:02] you have these circumstances where
[1:09:04] people say the Lord told
[1:09:08] me foolishness talking with a brother uh
[1:09:11] whole different part of the world the
[1:09:13] other day talking about a circumstance
[1:09:16] and he says now this comes like this and
[1:09:18] this person says that the Lord told them
[1:09:22] to divorce their wife and marry
[1:09:28] this what Bible is that out
[1:09:31] of come on you you know if you read your
[1:09:34] Bible you don't even have to do that one
[1:09:37] that's a devil speaking to someone not
[1:09:40] saying the person a devil the devil's
[1:09:43] speaking so you look at this my brother
[1:09:45] and sister and if you've never received
[1:09:48] the Holy Ghost you don't know that he is
[1:09:50] the Christ the anointed one amen is our
[1:09:53] life anointed I want to lift hand and
[1:09:55] say Lord I want my life to be anointed
[1:09:58] amen I want the word to anoint me your
[1:10:01] Holy Spirit to anoint me that I can
[1:10:03] stand with confidence and what I read in
[1:10:06] this Bible standing in the midst of my
[1:10:09] Promised Land are you with me I'm in the
[1:10:11] midst of my promised land and I'm
[1:10:13] standing there as a stranger but I know
[1:10:17] that while I'm in the midst of that that
[1:10:19] while I feel like out of place and out
[1:10:22] of cter that God put me there it was his
[1:10:25] word it's his Spirit his life his
[1:10:27] anointing and whatever I'm called for
[1:10:30] even if I feel out of place he's got me
[1:10:33] there for a reason oh can we say Amen to
[1:10:37] that tonight amen so we're never my
[1:10:40] brother and sister while we're in a
[1:10:42] Strange Land we're not in a strange
[1:10:44] promise that's right we're in his
[1:10:46] promise and he'll take us through the
[1:10:48] Strange Land to manifest that promise
[1:10:52] amen oh you're not converted until you
[1:10:55] receive the Holy Ghost some people would
[1:10:57] have a hard time they'd choke on that
[1:10:58] one remember as brother Adrian
[1:11:01] preached we'll have to stop tonight not
[1:11:04] here I hope by God's grace we'll have to
[1:11:07] pick up all the
[1:11:10] fragments because you see there's some
[1:11:12] of this word we call it the message but
[1:11:16] it's the
[1:11:17] Bible and
[1:11:19] they they want to nibble on the edges of
[1:11:22] it but they're not going to eat the
[1:11:24] crust
[1:11:26] because it's too
[1:11:27] crusty it's too hard on
[1:11:30] them can't can't deal with it now this
[1:11:33] is a little something I don't know
[1:11:35] Sister Jerry just did this but it
[1:11:36] strikes me as an example so sister Jerry
[1:11:39] made some sourdough bread the other day
[1:11:41] and I come in the house and I can smell
[1:11:43] this
[1:11:44] bread I'm thinking man this smells good
[1:11:48] and I go over to where this loaf of
[1:11:49] bread is that and there is a damp towel
[1:11:52] wrapped around this loaf
[1:11:58] huh I said 'jerry why is this on
[1:12:00] there so the crust won't get
[1:12:04] hard novel
[1:12:07] idea but I like hard crust you soak it
[1:12:10] in enough butter it's
[1:12:13] soft but there's two ways you can look
[1:12:15] at that we can water the message down so
[1:12:19] it's more
[1:12:20] palatable or maybe the Holy Ghost would
[1:12:22] come and wrap himself around you and I
[1:12:24] so that but we don't become old crusty
[1:12:28] Eagles amen hallelujah however you want
[1:12:31] to look at it but it struck me I thought
[1:12:33] oh praise God I'll eat the bread anyway
[1:12:35] and no I did not leave any crumbs or
[1:12:37] fragments amen I ate every drop of it
[1:12:40] and I pray that God would anoint you and
[1:12:42] I to eat every drop of it amen not leave
[1:12:45] anything to be collected to give to
[1:12:47] someone else amen so the Bible said so
[1:12:51] after Peter had been uh saved and
[1:12:54] sanctified give power to cast out
[1:12:56] unclean spirits and preach the gospel
[1:12:58] Jesus plainly told him he was not
[1:13:00] converted that had to be
[1:13:03] painful that had to be painful my
[1:13:05] brother and sister and people get
[1:13:07] offended when the preacher would say now
[1:13:09] look you got to let go and let God work
[1:13:11] in your life oh no I've had the Holy
[1:13:12] Ghost for 25 years well maybe you're
[1:13:14] getting
[1:13:15] crusty and God's just being
[1:13:19] preemptive see it let's not look back
[1:13:21] and say I had a starting
[1:13:23] dat I mean we we always you want to get
[1:13:26] technical we always were Sons and
[1:13:27] Daughters of God that's right exactly
[1:13:30] but sometimes God's preemptive and he
[1:13:31] wants us to soak and bathe in the
[1:13:34] atmosphere because he knows what
[1:13:36] tomorrow's come the next
[1:13:38] page because you see I got sidetracked
[1:13:42] there the very page that describes the
[1:13:46] trial and I said you flip the page and
[1:13:49] then there's the words you're an
[1:13:53] overcomer let's go back two
[1:13:57] pages beyond the page that would tell
[1:14:00] you of the coming
[1:14:03] trial and we might feel like all is
[1:14:07] well but God doesn't shout a warning
[1:14:10] from the
[1:14:10] rooftops because he knows what's in you
[1:14:15] he knows you can handle this so very
[1:14:18] rarely I've had it happen in my life but
[1:14:21] very
[1:14:22] rarely um well I I I just share just
[1:14:25] smidge of that real quick we've been
[1:14:27] overseas before wake up in the middle of
[1:14:29] the night and the Lord show you things
[1:14:31] that are going to happen the next day
[1:14:33] it's just as plain as if you were living
[1:14:35] in the next day but have you noticed
[1:14:37] often times that the word does not come
[1:14:40] along and show you what Satan's going to
[1:14:43] try and do the next
[1:14:45] day because he wants us to put on our
[1:14:49] armor
[1:14:51] today and every day amen
[1:14:55] every day every
[1:14:59] day I'll buckle my armor on today
[1:15:02] because I'm going to have a great
[1:15:03] challenge no the Lord says put your
[1:15:06] armor on because every day is going to
[1:15:09] be a great
[1:15:11] challenge okay I've got to hurry so to
[1:15:14] preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him
[1:15:15] he's not converted until he received the
[1:15:17] Holy Ghost after you are converted then
[1:15:20] strengthen your brother amen if you're
[1:15:22] on an airplane if you're on a ship they
[1:15:25] will tell you get the life jacket on
[1:15:27] yourself before you try to put it on
[1:15:29] everybody else around you we need that
[1:15:32] sign hanging somewhere in the church
[1:15:34] amen if you feel like you're drowning
[1:15:37] get the life jacket on yourself first oh
[1:15:40] wait the scripture does deal with that
[1:15:41] get the mod out of your own eye amen so
[1:15:44] look at this how God's dealing we
[1:15:46] shouldn't be running around trying to
[1:15:48] put the life jacket on everyone until we
[1:15:53] ourselves and then by the time we get
[1:15:55] the life jacket on ourselves we find
[1:15:56] everybody around us has got their life
[1:15:58] jacket on Amen Hallelujah now look at
[1:16:02] this I gotta I got to hurry I'm
[1:16:05] sorry very
[1:16:08] much and that was on the night of the
[1:16:12] Betrayal that he was not yet converted
[1:16:15] no man is truly converted till he has
[1:16:17] been changed died to himself amen we use
[1:16:21] the hatchet on everybody else we should
[1:16:22] be using it on oursel the Holy Spirit
[1:16:24] Spirit has control of that person they
[1:16:27] don't want to do
[1:16:28] it get this now what's happening he's
[1:16:33] died to himself amen it's no longer what
[1:16:37] we want to do but it really has come
[1:16:40] down to what we don't want to
[1:16:43] do I don't want to be the old man that I
[1:16:46] was I don't want to express the spirit
[1:16:49] of
[1:16:50] leoda now if you get the balance of this
[1:16:52] wrong people will be like I go to Church
[1:16:55] faithful I don't need a holy ghost I
[1:16:56] don't know what they're talking about
[1:16:58] come on my brother and sister it's
[1:17:00] getting bad enough around the message
[1:17:01] even people are like our family's been
[1:17:03] in the message since brother Brandon was
[1:17:05] here what's that got to do with
[1:17:08] it got nothing to do with it God knows
[1:17:11] your destination he knows how to get you
[1:17:13] there he knows the trouble of your day
[1:17:16] and he has promised to take you to the
[1:17:19] destination even if the journey is hard
[1:17:21] but it's got to be your journey young
[1:17:23] people hear me well it's it's got to be
[1:17:25] your journey it can't be dad's Journey
[1:17:28] mom's Journey Aunt uncle grandma grandpa
[1:17:31] it's got to be your journey and it's got
[1:17:34] to be your vision of the destination
[1:17:37] that takes you on that Journey amen amen
[1:17:40] now the holy spirit will not misbehave
[1:17:42] itself in one person and behave itself
[1:17:45] in another it'll make each person come
[1:17:48] into its character meaning the holy
[1:17:50] ghost's character see because it's a
[1:17:53] spirit that leads you it brings makes
[1:17:56] you subject to its nature you don't
[1:17:59] bring it subject to your nature it makes
[1:18:02] you subject to its nature are we okay
[1:18:05] amen and the Holy Spirit makes you live
[1:18:08] and love to do it oh none of this I got
[1:18:12] to be a Christian I've got to live
[1:18:16] right no sir I have a privilege to serve
[1:18:20] God I have a privilege to say Amen to
[1:18:23] his word I have a privilege to be a
[1:18:25] living epistle amen sorry for getting so
[1:18:28] excited amen makes you live and love to
[1:18:32] do it oh how you love to give up the
[1:18:34] things of the
[1:18:36] world oh
[1:18:37] my when the Holy Spirit comes in how it
[1:18:40] cleanses you and washes you with the
[1:18:43] brillopad of the word amen it's that
[1:18:47] strong sometimes is it
[1:18:49] not and puts his desire into you to
[1:18:52] follow him and to thirst and a Hunger
[1:18:56] for More of it that's right just bathing
[1:19:01] yourself if the word was a great big
[1:19:04] pool the believer would be just like
[1:19:07] children they'd run jump in climb out
[1:19:10] run jump in climb out run jump in climb
[1:19:14] out amen because there's a thrill of
[1:19:18] getting back into the
[1:19:21] cleansing getting back into the presence
[1:19:23] getting Amen in into that completely
[1:19:26] amen reminds me of a kid we were little
[1:19:30] mix bathing back then but we were just
[1:19:32] little kids and I can remember there was
[1:19:36] there was this family that rented my
[1:19:38] grandmother's house and uh the canal was
[1:19:41] right there now in modern times giving
[1:19:43] an idea the canal to an adult would be
[1:19:46] about that
[1:19:47] deep and um this family lived there and
[1:19:52] uh they had a little girl we'd be
[1:19:53] visiting my grandmother
[1:19:55] and this little girl actually is about
[1:19:57] my age I guess and and she always have
[1:20:01] her hair all curled up her mama was big
[1:20:03] into all this
[1:20:05] stuff and she would get in the water and
[1:20:09] she'd never get her hair
[1:20:11] wet and I can remember another little
[1:20:13] boy that lived down the road there would
[1:20:15] come and and he one day looks at her and
[1:20:18] he goes my mama says if you don't get
[1:20:22] your hair wet you're not swimming
[1:20:26] I just remember that as a little
[1:20:28] memory and you
[1:20:32] know can we apply it Saints no we're not
[1:20:36] really getting into the water of the
[1:20:38] word unless we just get in amen now to
[1:20:43] finish kind of the funny side of that
[1:20:46] the canal was shallow enough right there
[1:20:47] that as boys we have to jump in and land
[1:20:49] on our bottom to get our head
[1:20:52] underwater and and you know but but
[1:20:54] there was a thrill about getting you
[1:20:56] know under the water I wonder sometimes
[1:20:59] we come to
[1:21:00] church we're okay the water of the word
[1:21:05] sosing around our
[1:21:07] ankles but never getting us completely
[1:21:12] washed now it don't matter the preacher
[1:21:15] might be poor I might not be
[1:21:16] communicating very good tonight but if
[1:21:18] you'll lay down in the presence of God
[1:21:20] it'll get every drop of you wet amen
[1:21:23] every drop of you will be washed amen
[1:21:26] it's not about how deep the preacher can
[1:21:28] preach it amen it's about whether or not
[1:21:30] you're willing to get down and get into
[1:21:33] the water of the word and let it have
[1:21:35] its effect upon you
[1:21:38] hallelujah amen it puts a desire in you
[1:21:41] to follow him and a thirst and a Hunger
[1:21:43] for More of it just bathing yourself he
[1:21:46] brings realities now God place man here
[1:21:49] and in the days of the Lord Jesus he
[1:21:50] gave man a true road map to his power
[1:21:53] right here we are in Journey a road map
[1:21:56] a road map is something that tells you
[1:21:58] tells you which way you're headed and if
[1:22:00] you want to go when we leave in the next
[1:22:03] few days I've crossed this country so
[1:22:05] much my wife and I were amazed to think
[1:22:08] of it for the last few years you could
[1:22:12] mention where you want to go and I can
[1:22:15] tell you any road that leads to it and
[1:22:18] within 15 minutes of the time you would
[1:22:20] arrive from here to California and I
[1:22:22] haven't missed it a time in I don't know
[1:22:25] sometimes right on the dot see
[1:22:27] calculating my time of what the driving
[1:22:30] time is and the average of time and I've
[1:22:32] just been back and forth up and down
[1:22:35] back and forth until you just know it
[1:22:37] and that's the way God wants us to know
[1:22:40] his word amen we've been in it it's not
[1:22:43] foreign to us we know what it means he
[1:22:46] knows where it's taking us we know the
[1:22:48] effect it's having on us my brother and
[1:22:50] sister but if we haven't traveled
[1:22:55] y we haven't traveled if we don't
[1:23:00] know just a side note brother Sergey and
[1:23:03] I have joked about this before somebody
[1:23:06] says how long does it take to get to the
[1:23:08] Tri Cities first question is how fast
[1:23:10] you're
[1:23:11] driving second question is are you in a
[1:23:14] car or a
[1:23:15] truck all these little factors my
[1:23:18] brother and
[1:23:19] sister we're going to get to our
[1:23:21] destination I don't know you see God has
[1:23:23] not revealed to us in this present
[1:23:25] condition how long it's going to take us
[1:23:27] to get to our
[1:23:30] destination it might be five more years
[1:23:33] 10 more years I don't know right but you
[1:23:37] see if you're not on the right
[1:23:40] route you're not heading the right
[1:23:42] direction that's correct and you're not
[1:23:44] moving at
[1:23:45] all right it won't make any difference
[1:23:49] right but if a Christian will get out
[1:23:51] and walk this old gospel Highway amen
[1:23:54] men and just start walking not worry
[1:23:56] about that maybe someone remember that
[1:23:58] little old lady brother brandom saw be
[1:23:59] on the curtain of time got saved in her
[1:24:01] 90s somebody which was a prophet yeah
[1:24:05] somebody had to carry the word to her
[1:24:07] she walked all those
[1:24:10] years well to her 90s to get
[1:24:15] saved where are we going to stop where
[1:24:17] are we going to
[1:24:19] start that's the way God wants us to
[1:24:21] know his word we know it we've traveled
[1:24:23] it we've tested it we tried it you know
[1:24:27] where it leads to how his road map is
[1:24:30] his Bible now his road map is his Bible
[1:24:33] the Bible is the road map that leads to
[1:24:35] the power of God faith leads you to the
[1:24:38] power power produces the promise we need
[1:24:41] power amen amen hallelujah we got about
[1:24:44] two more minutes amen Satan's not
[1:24:47] without a game plan you know that the
[1:24:50] devil has a game plan in fact the
[1:24:52] prophet of God said the devil knows you
[1:24:54] better than you know yourself that's
[1:24:57] scary when you think about that in more
[1:24:59] of a natural context that's scary that
[1:25:03] the devil could predict as it were what
[1:25:08] you would react to this situation to
[1:25:11] this situation the only way we can break
[1:25:15] Satan's understanding is to be in the
[1:25:19] word amen because it Shields see brother
[1:25:22] brandham I read this a while back and
[1:25:24] I'm going to say this is deductive
[1:25:26] reasoning so forgive me if you recognize
[1:25:28] it but amen you see Satan looking at
[1:25:32] us expecting us to act a certain way the
[1:25:38] holy spirit in US is moving us calling
[1:25:43] us to a different
[1:25:47] walk average I don't know 25 year old in
[1:25:51] the world today without God in their
[1:25:53] life Satan can pinpoint their actions
[1:25:58] reactions thoughts Deeds take a 25y old
[1:26:03] filled with the Holy Ghost he might fail
[1:26:05] once in a while come on I'm just going
[1:26:07] to be blunt tonight amen the prophet of
[1:26:10] God said I just heard him say it it's
[1:26:12] interesting to hear the prophet talking
[1:26:13] about that oh how beautiful that little
[1:26:16] girl
[1:26:17] was we all are
[1:26:20] like but the prophet's making a point
[1:26:25] and we might fail
[1:26:27] Brothers we might look that second time
[1:26:30] and Satan had go ha there it is just
[1:26:33] like I thought but then the Holy Spirit
[1:26:35] comes
[1:26:37] down and that brother's like forgive me
[1:26:39] Lord Satan's like this is not in the
[1:26:43] plan I can't see that now it's covered
[1:26:46] in
[1:26:47] blood and that's what God's doing
[1:26:50] because he knows the destinations right
[1:26:52] here and he's not going to allow ow us
[1:26:54] to fail right here did you hear me I
[1:26:58] mean it how I said it he's not going to
[1:27:01] allow us to fail amen amen the devil
[1:27:06] says but you
[1:27:07] looked but the blood's covered that
[1:27:09] Satan amen amen now Satan's got his plan
[1:27:13] Isaiah 17:10 there's more to it in
[1:27:16] Isaiah there 177 in the chapters but
[1:27:20] it's there see part of this plan of
[1:27:22] Satan is it says here in the verse
[1:27:24] because thou Hast got forgotten the god
[1:27:27] of thy salvation and Hast not been
[1:27:30] mindful of the rock of thy strength
[1:27:33] therefore shalt thou plant Pleasant
[1:27:36] plants he'll preach that everybody's
[1:27:38] going to
[1:27:40] heaven everybody
[1:27:42] saved Pleasant
[1:27:45] plants and Shall Set it with strange
[1:27:49] slips now we're not going to carry any
[1:27:51] farther in that thought but you see this
[1:27:53] all comes when Satan's plan gets us
[1:27:57] thinking about life and we start to
[1:28:01] forget the things of God and we start to
[1:28:06] do good and we forget that the only
[1:28:08] strength we have is him we got nothing
[1:28:12] else Beyond
[1:28:13] him but if he can get us to the place we
[1:28:16] think somehow we did
[1:28:18] this reminds me of a little situation
[1:28:21] you know some time back you know you you
[1:28:23] do something and and it turns out well
[1:28:26] and then the same thing on a different
[1:28:28] thing breaks and you think I fixed it
[1:28:31] before I can do this and you make a
[1:28:34] terrible
[1:28:35] mess and you realize you know what I
[1:28:38] didn't really have the ability or the
[1:28:40] skill it's only when I thought I did
[1:28:44] that I realized how weak and what a
[1:28:47] failure see our strength comes it's in
[1:28:50] Jesus our Solid Rock Amen period that's
[1:28:52] what we got to remember don't leave the
[1:28:54] house without him amen that's all that
[1:28:57] comes down to us but see Satan wants us
[1:29:00] and I I I say this as I'm closing uh
[1:29:03] Satan he doesn't
[1:29:05] come and say forget about Jesus Christ
[1:29:10] as your
[1:29:13] savior forget about
[1:29:16] Jesus as in a
[1:29:19] Manger you don't have to forget about
[1:29:21] that
[1:29:25] just get distracted long enough that
[1:29:29] this
[1:29:31] awareness that this is a holy sacred
[1:29:36] Tabernacle just forget about
[1:29:40] that little things start to slip right
[1:29:43] not big things
[1:29:45] oh yeah Jesus our
[1:29:50] savior yeah lie cheat steal you get my
[1:29:54] point making no connection to Jesus our
[1:29:59] savior I just experienced that and just
[1:30:03] recently of someone whose life is um not
[1:30:06] judgmental on them but their life is
[1:30:08] very out of kelter very chaotic very
[1:30:12] disjointed and look you in the face and
[1:30:14] say oh Jesus Is My
[1:30:18] Savior we forgot what it is to be
[1:30:21] saved forgot what it was to be be
[1:30:24] cleansed forgot what it was to be
[1:30:27] delivered forgot what it was to be
[1:30:29] empowered by the word of
[1:30:32] God and if Satan can get you to forget
[1:30:35] those
[1:30:36] things he doesn't have to deceive you
[1:30:40] you could believe God sent a prophet you
[1:30:42] could believe all of these other
[1:30:44] things but it's powerless I'm not being
[1:30:48] too hard am
[1:30:52] I so I I need to hurry
[1:30:55] here
[1:30:58] um
[1:31:00] so take a home do it as homework if you
[1:31:03] would Jeremiah 29 10-13 you know this
[1:31:06] for thus sayith the Lord uh you know I'm
[1:31:10] going to return I know the thoughts I
[1:31:12] think toward you you know the scripture
[1:31:15] amen so in the six-fold purpose of
[1:31:17] Gabriel's visit to
[1:31:19] Daniel um we'll look at this my brother
[1:31:23] and sister and and
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:29] uh yeah there we go brother Gideon thank
[1:31:33] you I hope you like this to me I I just
[1:31:37] actually loved this when I read
[1:31:40] it you can go back I shortened it down
[1:31:43] because of time wouldn't that make you
[1:31:46] good to think that God loved
[1:31:49] you if I wasn't greatly loved I'd just
[1:31:52] like to know that
[1:31:54] kind of loved a little bit up there
[1:31:57] wouldn't you
[1:31:59] yeah sure just kind of he thinks of me
[1:32:03] once in a while it would just make me
[1:32:06] just want to
[1:32:08] scream to think that he even cares for
[1:32:10] me and we have the assurance that he
[1:32:13] does care for us because while we were
[1:32:16] yet sinners Christ died in our stead
[1:32:19] brother and now which we were alien from
[1:32:23] God and now has made us nigh unto God
[1:32:26] and has given us the earnest of our
[1:32:28] Salvation that is the Holy Spirit and
[1:32:31] with uh faith in there that lifts us up
[1:32:34] above the things of the world and we
[1:32:36] ride over the top of it amen look at
[1:32:39] this my brother and sister leoda is not
[1:32:42] getting better God's lifting you above
[1:32:47] leoda and taking you taking our children
[1:32:50] our grandchildren amen our marriages our
[1:32:53] our friendships and our relationship
[1:32:55] with the Lord he's lifting us up we're
[1:32:58] no longer waiting in the swamp right
[1:33:02] he's carried us above that amen that's
[1:33:06] glorious isn't it all right while in
[1:33:09] prayer Gabriel come and told him that
[1:33:11] there was not only was not only two more
[1:33:15] years before they were going back to the
[1:33:16] Homeland but told him the entire
[1:33:19] destination of that
[1:33:21] Nation we had a message that came my
[1:33:24] brother and sister not just encouraging
[1:33:26] us to live like a Christian but gave to
[1:33:28] a bride of Christ the entire revelation
[1:33:32] of our
[1:33:34] destination oh hallelujah we're not just
[1:33:36] going to church to be able to say I've
[1:33:39] attended this church for 70 years our
[1:33:42] families believe the message for four
[1:33:44] generations now no my brother and sister
[1:33:47] the destination is a revelation amen
[1:33:50] amen the heavens my brother and sister
[1:33:53] the Heaven that the world denomination
[1:33:56] talking about is not the same Heaven
[1:33:58] that God revealed to you and that might
[1:34:01] might be a little bit to stumble over
[1:34:03] but I'm telling you their Heaven has a
[1:34:06] really broad gate yeah that's right but
[1:34:09] God called you to walk a narrow way and
