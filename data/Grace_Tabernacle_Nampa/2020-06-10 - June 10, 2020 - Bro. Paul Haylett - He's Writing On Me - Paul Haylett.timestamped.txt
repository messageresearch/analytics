[31:22] lift it
[31:31] [Music]
[31:40] it's the sound of glory I listen I
[31:52] listen I keep listening for a difference
[31:59] [Music]
[32:03] you know the prophet of God brings out
[32:05] from the Word of God and brings it to
[32:07] clarity that only the redeemed only the
[32:13] bride of Jesus Christ can hear that
[32:16] sound
[32:17] Amen it's not the whole world going to
[32:20] hear that sound it's going to be that
[32:21] bride Amen aren't you glad that God
[32:23] included us in that number to hear that
[32:27] voice that declared what was coming in
[32:30] our day a man and made it so real so
[32:34] alive with such clarity amen just how
[32:38] beautiful such clarity hallelujah amen
[32:43] you know I just want to bring greetings
[32:47] from the saints in Greeley Colorado
[32:50] their governor put them back on lockdown
[32:53] so they are having just online services
[32:57] just as we was and then brother ezq is
[33:01] having a little bit of a health issue we
[33:04] want to remember him in prayer and his
[33:06] doctor wanted him to stay away from even
[33:09] his own family just him and his wife and
[33:11] so even his own children grandchildren
[33:13] can't can't go to Grandpa's house or mom
[33:16] and dad's house and so we broke the
[33:18] rules we shook hands over the fence and
[33:21] stood a few feet away from each other
[33:24] and talked and his his son Christian
[33:27] even though brother Zeke you speak some
[33:30] English I think good enough English but
[33:33] his son Christian interpreted for us and
[33:36] we had our picture taken together
[33:39] sure it looks interesting with us both
[33:40] leaning over the fence from each side
[33:43] but it was lovely and and the Saints
[33:45] there just send their greetings and
[33:48] their love and appreciation to you here
[33:51] so that was a beautiful time that we had
[33:55] we got to go on Sunday there and eat
[33:59] with them have a little barbecue in the
[34:02] backyard and just a lovely timing so
[34:06] it's beautiful now I know on the on the
[34:10] boise church that's in Nampa there's
[34:18] been some news or whatever from brother
[34:21] Prashant sister Aakansha and a lovely
[34:24] report that sister V me in the hospital
[34:27] in for the ICU and the doctors not
[34:29] having much hope but then she's back
[34:32] home she got sick again but God
[34:34] delivered her from that again
[34:35] and I I tried finding the quote sister
[34:38] Jerry and I was listening to a message
[34:40] the other day and I tried going back out
[34:43] finding that quote and I should have
[34:46] asked sister Jerry because she has a way
[34:47] of remembering where they were at but I
[34:49] just remember the prophet of God saying
[34:51] how that God took his sword and just
[34:54] went right down into the very depths
[34:55] what Satan was and just cut him off amen
[34:58] now if it doesn't come up exactly that
[35:00] way amen please forgive me but that's
[35:02] what the word did Amen sharper than a
[35:04] two-edged sword just right down into the
[35:06] very midst and when I heard that I
[35:09] thought of sister Vee me immediately and
[35:12] sister Jerry and I stopped right then
[35:15] and there and we prayed that the power
[35:17] of God would go right down and cut off
[35:20] that enemy amen now this is not just for
[35:23] our sister Vimy it's for each and every
[35:25] one of us that the Word of God would go
[35:28] right down cut off every bit of unbelief
[35:31] every hindrance every power that Satan
[35:33] believes he can exert over us and set
[35:36] God's people free amen so let's just
[35:39] continue to remember brother pursuance
[35:41] sister Aakansha not only with this
[35:43] situation with sister Vimy but the fact
[35:46] that sister conscious all the way in
[35:48] india and brother purse want is working
[35:52] every day and they're separated and that
[35:55] alone would be a great trial amen
[35:58] so we just want to just lift them up in
[36:02] prayer amen I hear you had a wonderful
[36:04] service on Sunday praise the Lord
[36:07] amen how good our God is amen
[36:10] I just want to speak to you tonight on
[36:12] preparations of the inner man and he's
[36:16] if I give it a title I'd say he's
[36:18] writing on me
[36:19] amen and so as we'll look tonight you
[36:22] will you will obvious I believe what
[36:25] we've took our thought from as we turn
[36:27] in second Corinthians a third chapter
[36:30] verses one through six and then verse 17
[36:33] also Amen let's just stand for the
[36:36] reading of the word tonight and good to
[36:39] be back home we had a lovely but very
[36:41] quick trip very exhausting trip actually
[36:46] we we met a young man that grew up here
[36:49] sister Sue would know him Jonathan
[36:51] barber a man he's grown up actually he's
[36:54] 30
[36:55] I always forget 38 years old but he
[36:59] lives in the Greenlee area also and is a
[37:02] good friend with brother George brother
[37:03] George called him up and said that we
[37:06] were going to be there he contacted us
[37:08] and just a lovely time see a young man
[37:11] kind of off by himself from his family
[37:15] but just serving on fire for the Lord
[37:18] amen and and to see how God just leads
[37:21] and guides and opens one eyes you know
[37:24] it was just lovely to to have that time
[37:27] to to visit with him and I tell you we
[37:31] were in such an intense fellowship we
[37:32] went to there was a few restaurants that
[37:35] are open not sure why the difference
[37:37] from restaurant to restaurant but we met
[37:40] at the Red Lobster which was just a
[37:42] block from the motel we stayed in and
[37:44] they closed at 10:00 and we stood in the
[37:46] parking lot till 1:00 and it was just a
[37:50] lovely lovely time I mean we were it was
[37:52] just beautiful
[37:53] amen second Corinthians the third
[37:56] chapter verses 1 through 6 do we begin
[37:59] again to commend ourselves or need we as
[38:03] some others epistles of commendation
[38:06] to you or letters of commendation from
[38:09] you
[38:10] ye are our epistle written in our hearts
[38:13] known and read of all men for as much as
[38:17] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[38:19] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[38:21] written not with ink but with the spirit
[38:24] of the Living God immense of not man
[38:28] amen the Spirit of the Living God
[38:31] not in tables of stone but in fleshy
[38:34] tables of the heart and such trusts have
[38:38] we through Christ to God word not that
[38:41] we are sufficient of ourselves to think
[38:45] anything as of ourselves but our
[38:48] sufficiency is of God who also hath made
[38:52] us able ministers of the New Testament
[38:55] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[38:59] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[39:02] life amen we'll go to verse 17 now the
[39:06] Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit
[39:09] of the Lord is there is Liberty Heavenly
[39:14] Father we ask for your guidance tonight
[39:16] Lord let us only speak Lord would be
[39:18] pleasing to you Lord speak to the needs
[39:21] of your people father give us guidance
[39:24] and give us strength Lord each and every
[39:26] day Lord as we were encouraged by the
[39:28] Prophet father to pray for revelation
[39:30] may we be faithful to that encouragement
[39:33] and Lord just can continually asking you
[39:36] Lord to open our eyes further Lord I
[39:40] don't believe we can ever come to a time
[39:42] that we would say that we had enough of
[39:44] you Lord that we had enough of your word
[39:46] but Lord just continually pour yourself
[39:49] into us is our prayer ask for Lord every
[39:53] need every quest every heart's desire in
[39:55] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[39:58] you may be seated hallelujah good to be
[40:02] in the house of the Lord tonight amen
[40:05] now as we look here in verse 1 my
[40:08] brother and sister I find this to be a
[40:10] very interesting Scripture because as it
[40:13] is speaking is a do we begin again to
[40:16] commend ourselves in other words would
[40:19] speak or boast of ourselves you know
[40:21] sometimes now look I don't want this to
[40:24] be misunderstood I'm just using it for
[40:25] reference but sometimes we'll say well
[40:27] I've been serving the Lord for thirty
[40:30] years or whatever but you know I always
[40:33] causes me to remember the eleventh hour'
[40:35] worker my brother and sister received
[40:37] the same paycheck so it is not as though
[40:40] we can boast that we have served the
[40:42] Lord for so long but it's simply that we
[40:45] serve the Lord and if there would be any
[40:47] boasting it would be what God has done
[40:49] in you and I for you and I Amen and so
[40:53] it's not to speak or to boast of
[40:55] ourselves and you know it's not really
[40:58] that we would bring as it were a
[41:00] commendation bring a letter of reference
[41:03] that would come and you know to say hey
[41:05] look we find so-and-so
[41:08] to have been a faithful Christian or
[41:10] faithful believer for X amount of time
[41:13] and therefore we send his reputation
[41:16] written in ink on a page my brother and
[41:19] sister that's not what God intended Amen
[41:21] we do not have fellowship cards Amen we
[41:24] are not here to to you know bring a
[41:27] reference that we are in good standing
[41:29] because of the church that we attended
[41:33] or what pastor that we had we as humans
[41:35] sometimes tend to give great emphasis to
[41:38] that you know if we're not careful I
[41:40] have this happen to me and many years
[41:41] ago sister Jerry and I was at some
[41:43] meetings back east and I think they was
[41:45] just made a little something going on
[41:48] around the message at that time and I
[41:50] was having a lovely conversation with a
[41:52] brother and he asked me he says who is
[41:54] your pastor and I said well brother we
[41:56] don't have a pastor at this time but and
[41:59] he turned around and walked off Mya's
[42:02] like it was not my fault I don't have a
[42:05] pastor I wanted a pastor I wanted to do
[42:09] I had no idea at that time I would be
[42:11] pastor but you know if my brother and
[42:13] sisters sometimes we we put certain
[42:15] things that we need a recommendation
[42:17] it'd be like well this is our pastor and
[42:20] people would go oh wonderful my brother
[42:23] and sister you know those that would be
[42:25] without a pastor they can still be just
[42:27] as true a believer still as strong a
[42:29] believer amen they're living in an area
[42:32] God can raise up a pastor in that area
[42:34] amen sometimes we just give up a little
[42:37] too easy or even sometimes I think we
[42:39] might set our expectation too high just
[42:42] as it was here not speaking on my behalf
[42:43] but just as it was here my brother and
[42:46] sister God chose to drag out of the
[42:48] ranks somebody that didn't have a clue
[42:50] what he was doing and then give him a
[42:52] position of authority and then caused
[42:54] him great great distress as he felt a
[42:58] pull or a calling or a burden to step
[43:01] into what God asked him to do and so we
[43:04] look at this and it's not really the
[43:06] right letter of recommendation that
[43:07] makes us a good believer it is not that
[43:10] someone said this person is this or this
[43:12] person is that that really makes him
[43:14] amen and you know we're not here as it
[43:17] is to give a letter of recommendation we
[43:20] don't need to go around telling people
[43:22] this is a good person that is a good
[43:24] person because you see my brother and
[43:26] sister what God is doing and is he is
[43:28] proving who is controlling our life by
[43:32] our very life amen so you don't need the
[43:35] letter of recommendation because our
[43:36] life becomes the letter Amen hallelujah
[43:41] so it's there that we don't write
[43:43] letters to someone else but look how he
[43:46] speaks to the Corinthians here
[43:48] he said ye are our epistle written in
[43:51] our hearts known and read of all men now
[43:55] my brother and sister I don't want to
[43:57] sound like I am interpreting the Word of
[44:00] God I don't mean it that way but look at
[44:02] this the people became the testimony of
[44:06] Paul's ministry amen so when you looked
[44:10] at their life those that were followers
[44:12] of Paul's ministry when you looked at
[44:14] their life their life testified of the
[44:18] ministry that Paul was speaking well the
[44:20] word that he was speaking amen so the
[44:23] believers life become a very testimony
[44:26] or the commendation my brother and
[44:29] sister so it's a you know if I would
[44:32] give example this evening our lives your
[44:36] life becomes the witness of Jesus Christ
[44:38] can we say amen to that
[44:40] amen because it's the very spirit or the
[44:42] very life of Christ that is in
[44:45] that causes us to be who we are right
[44:48] now brother Brown talks about that when
[44:50] he talks about the spirit of the bet how
[44:52] do you say his name Beethoven thank you
[44:56] I'm John Dillinger
[44:58] all of those right the spirit but that
[45:00] be if they had the spirit of John
[45:02] Dillinger you'd be shooting the place up
[45:04] amen if you had the spirit of Beethoven
[45:06] you would be riding music and playing it
[45:09] so we look at that and realize that when
[45:11] the Spirit of Christ the the Word of God
[45:13] is in our life amen we become the
[45:16] witness of Jesus Christ
[45:18] now the prophet of God in several places
[45:20] throughout the message makes a comment
[45:22] about how it's weak pulpits it's people
[45:25] who are not being what they're called to
[45:29] be in other words taking a very
[45:30] lackluster approach to the Word of God
[45:33] that no wonder the unbeliever doesn't
[45:36] see anything about Christianity to be
[45:39] attracted to because they can't tell any
[45:42] difference from them to those around
[45:45] them amen so there's no testimony of
[45:47] Jesus Christ amen so my brother and
[45:50] sister to bring this down into this
[45:52] place right here your life my life
[45:55] becomes a witness of the message of the
[45:57] hour and as I've shared many times
[45:59] through the years I still feel this way
[46:01] my brother and sister that I kind of
[46:04] struggle sometimes with the reference of
[46:07] the message because the message has
[46:09] become so many different things to so
[46:12] many different people amen and so you
[46:14] say message it could actually be no
[46:18] different than saying Baptist and
[46:19] there's a you know so to speak a friend
[46:21] of mine who's Baptist he says well he
[46:23] says there's Baptists in the north
[46:25] Baptists in the south Baptists in the
[46:26] East Baptists in the West and they all
[46:28] believe different but they are Baptists
[46:30] and it's happening around us so we're
[46:37] not here to be identified with a
[46:41] movement but we're here to be identified
[46:45] of the God of the movement amen
[46:48] so as you look at that you realize our
[46:50] life becomes a witness of Jesus Christ
[46:53] it becomes a witness of the message of
[46:55] the hour I say Lord I want to be a true
[46:58] witness
[46:59] amen now it also your life my life
[47:02] becomes a witness of what this church
[47:04] stands for Amen if we preach holiness
[47:07] and we are something besides holiness my
[47:09] brother and sister people are going to
[47:11] say what's wrong with them
[47:12] amen if we say we believe the word and
[47:14] we just come out and do any old thing
[47:16] and whatever you know people are going
[47:19] to question that so you know our life
[47:21] becomes a witness of what it stands for
[47:23] now you know I was just talking to my
[47:26] momma today and and she was joking she
[47:28] said well I think I might end up being a
[47:30] preacher after all and she's been
[47:33] sitting around the table with a lot of
[47:35] these old folks they're letting them
[47:36] back out gathering together they're in
[47:38] the building and somebody asked mom why
[47:41] do you always wear a dress and she says
[47:44] yes I do and this lady says why and mama
[47:46] said well because it's in the Bible and
[47:49] the woman was shocked she said it's in
[47:51] the Bible you see my brother and sister
[47:54] that lady needed to hear that wearing
[47:57] the proper clothes is in the Bible amen
[48:00] not just some random thing so God you
[48:03] know sometimes we wonder why our
[48:06] circumstance is what it is and why we
[48:09] work where we work and live where we
[48:11] live shop where we shop but God's gotta
[48:14] have a testimonial witness in that place
[48:18] to be able to share the word amen and
[48:21] the very life of Jesus Christ amen
[48:24] so that's why god amen sometimes you
[48:26] know people say I don't know you know
[48:29] about why this is happening to me well
[48:31] quit looking at the negative look at the
[48:33] positive and say okay Lord is there
[48:35] someone here now you might even be down
[48:38] at the welfare office but don't go down
[48:40] there and say woe is me I'm at the
[48:42] welfare office go down there and say
[48:44] Lord is there someone in this office
[48:46] that I need to witness to Amen so
[48:50] instead of being down there boohoo the
[48:52] world is treating me wrong look around
[48:54] and say Lord there's got to be somebody
[48:56] here that needs to meet you amen
[48:59] so we look at this and realize what the
[49:01] beauty of what God is doing amen so in
[49:04] verse 3 says for as much as you're
[49:06] manifestly declared to be Epistle of
[49:09] Christ ministered by US written not with
[49:11] ink
[49:12] now my brother and sister when you
[49:14] realize how many Scrolls that the
[49:16] Apostle Paul must have filled up as he
[49:19] was writing the Word of God amen he
[49:21] wrote and he wrote and he wrote but he's
[49:23] telling you now and that this you being
[49:26] an epistle of him it's not drawing my
[49:29] brother and sister you to him but he's
[49:32] saying it's written in our hearts it's
[49:34] known in read of all men for as much as
[49:37] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[49:39] Epistle of Christ ministered by us if
[49:42] you look at that correctly all it was is
[49:45] Paul acknowledging that God called him
[49:47] to carry the word to you amen so it's
[49:50] exactly the day that we live in same
[49:53] thing repeated God ordained a man right
[49:56] because he's got to not break the
[49:58] continuity of the word amen so a man
[50:01] come to minister the word to us they
[50:05] were not to be lifted up into that
[50:07] elevated position and say that as it
[50:09] were is gone now remember many years ago
[50:11] just talking to an individual here
[50:13] recently many years ago right when
[50:15] brother Brown was still on the scene
[50:17] there was a whole movement of people
[50:19] saying oh brother Branham is Jesus
[50:21] Christ amen brother Branham rebuke that
[50:23] amen you know those people come to
[50:26] brother Branham we stayed in a motel
[50:27] room last night and then we had these
[50:29] crazy thoughts brother Branham they did
[50:31] that you are Jesus Christ and and
[50:33] brother Branham corrects them and but he
[50:36] says you know what the reason that
[50:37] happened is because the people who
[50:39] stayed in that room the night before
[50:42] believe that now my brother and sister
[50:45] if you don't think now I'm not going to
[50:48] do a war with me but if you don't think
[50:50] that brother Paul is is if you do think
[50:53] brother Paul's being just a little bit
[50:54] hard on some of these things that I
[50:56] preached on recently my brother and
[50:58] sister there is your proof right from
[51:00] the Prophet that those spirits will
[51:02] linger long after the people have left
[51:05] spirits will linger amen so if they'll
[51:08] linger enough in a motel room that the
[51:10] very next night people will be in there
[51:12] thinking that brother Branham was Jesus
[51:15] Christ my brother and sister those
[51:17] spirits will come and they will linger
[51:19] around you and I man that's why we have
[51:22] to be careful now I I might just have to
[51:24] you know kind of just
[51:26] be on the bad list but my brother and
[51:28] sister I want to show every spirit that
[51:30] is not pleasing to God every spirit
[51:32] that's not on the word everything that
[51:35] we can't find it in the Bible everything
[51:37] that we can't find continuity through
[51:39] the message we're gonna sweep that right
[51:40] out of the door hey man cuz we don't
[51:42] need that amen we don't need to come and
[51:45] come with some kind of spirit you know
[51:47] as those poor people all confused is he
[51:50] really Jesus Christ or are we confused
[51:52] my brother and sister now look at this
[51:54] now I know I'm gonna drag a little card
[51:56] out of our brother Christmas thought
[51:58] here and I really didn't realize what I
[52:00] was writing in my notes until kind of
[52:03] that was already down but my brother and
[52:05] sister you see right here it's here
[52:08] again I want to mention see this is not
[52:10] being done to write a letter to tell
[52:12] everyone as though it's a fellowship
[52:14] card but you see here it is that you're
[52:18] declared to be the Epistle of Christ but
[52:20] it's not written with ink amen he dese
[52:22] not Paul is moving beyond what he has
[52:25] written on the page saying there's
[52:27] something more than what was written on
[52:29] the page amen
[52:31] so it's there but with the Spirit of the
[52:34] Living God oh my brother and sister I
[52:35] think if we ever catch the revelation of
[52:38] how powerful the Spirit of God can be
[52:40] upon you and I we say well I'm just not
[52:43] worthy if God said you're worthy you are
[52:45] worthy hey man if God said he has poured
[52:47] out his grace upon you His grace is
[52:50] poured out upon you if he said I'm gonna
[52:53] give you revelation then you need to be
[52:55] saying lord I want more revelation hey
[52:57] man don't sit back and say poor me I'm
[52:59] just a person who makes mistakes
[53:02] No stand up declare what the word has
[53:04] said about you amen so with the Spirit
[53:07] of the Living God now I want to just put
[53:10] this footnote in there my brother and
[53:12] sister every move of the Holy Spirit is
[53:15] leaving its mark on you and I you say
[53:18] well it was a lovely service and the
[53:20] Spirit of God moved in our miss my
[53:22] brother and sister opened up to that so
[53:24] lord I want you to just leave your mark
[53:27] on me I don't want to just hear it walk
[53:29] out the door and forget it
[53:31] I want it written on me I want to have
[53:34] the very impression of the Word of God
[53:37] impressed upon me that it
[53:40] never leave amen I believe that's what
[53:42] an indelible marker you know that it
[53:44] cannot be erased did you know I thought
[53:47] this is just something interesting they
[53:48] have technology now that the police
[53:50] departments when they find a weapon that
[53:53] has been stolen and somebody has sanded
[53:55] the serial number off of that gun
[53:58] they have defaced that serial number on
[54:00] that gun
[54:01] did you know they discovered that the
[54:03] very impact of the printing of that
[54:06] serial number on that gun in the very
[54:08] beginning was not just on the surface I
[54:11] hope you get this it's not just on the
[54:14] surface but it changed the molecular
[54:16] structure of that whole piece of metal
[54:19] and so where they used to say this gun
[54:21] the serial numbers been taken from it we
[54:23] can't identify it now in almost every
[54:26] case they can take that gun and through
[54:28] a certain process go in there and it
[54:30] will literally stand that serial number
[54:33] back up to them because it has affected
[54:36] the whole molecular structure of that
[54:39] piece of metal now you tell me that when
[54:42] the Holy Ghost is moving amongst his
[54:44] people and we are there saying thank you
[54:46] lord i love you lord oh thank you I
[54:49] praise your Holy Name oh god we love you
[54:52] that is not putting an indelible mark
[54:54] that went all the way through the
[54:57] molecular structure of you as a son or
[54:59] daughter of God oh this is not just some
[55:03] little oh I felt good and walk out my
[55:04] brother and sister gods leaving his mark
[55:07] on his sons and daughters hallelujah oh
[55:11] look at this now every move I want to
[55:14] say this a can of be redundant every
[55:16] move of the Holy Spirit is leaving its
[55:19] mark on us Oh hallelujah amen what
[55:25] writing another book of Acts amen our
[55:29] brother Chris that was lovely I like
[55:31] that we enjoyed that another book of
[55:33] Acts my brother and sister but you see
[55:36] we don't need to put it on the written
[55:37] page we are not going to have my brother
[55:40] and sister another axe part to added or
[55:44] glued into the back of our Bible because
[55:46] in the day that we're living this word
[55:49] is being written on the fleshly tale
[55:52] of our heart the book of Acts that God
[55:56] is writing today is not pin upon paper
[55:59] not ink upon the paper but it is a
[56:02] spirit of the Living God writing on the
[56:06] hearts of sons and daughters of God the
[56:08] very life of Jesus Christ printing it
[56:11] right down into the very depth and I say
[56:14] my brother and sister he said the work
[56:16] that I have begun in you amen in other
[56:18] words if you would allow me to just move
[56:20] this a little bit what I have already
[56:23] written on you I will finish that
[56:26] writing hallelujah I'm not going to come
[56:30] to a place where it's an unfinished
[56:32] story but he will finish that story of
[56:35] what he is writing hallelujah so he's
[56:38] writing another book of Acts upon her
[56:40] heart I say Lord I lift my hands tonight
[56:42] Lord write on my heart
[56:45] write on me tonight hallelujah amen amen
[56:49] it does not being written need to be
[56:52] written on the page that's already been
[56:53] done amen the book of Acts my brother
[56:56] and sister is being written again and
[56:58] now it's being taken from the page and
[57:00] put on the fleshly table of the heart
[57:02] and we now become the Living Word of God
[57:05] God in you and I living out in the day
[57:09] that we are all the prophet of God what
[57:11] sister Jerry what what sermon was that
[57:13] where brother Brahms talking about
[57:14] beyond the veil and seeing unveiling of
[57:18] God I want to make sure I have that
[57:19] right listen to that sermon amen the
[57:21] unveiling of God it is so incredible you
[57:24] see my brother and sister what is
[57:26] happening is as we move into the
[57:29] presence of God its unveiling more and
[57:32] more and more it was not a singular
[57:34] unveiling but it is a continual
[57:37] unveiling of the Lord Jesus Christ to us
[57:40] amen and so the man who is still on the
[57:43] outside of the veil he sees it from this
[57:45] perspective and he cannot understand the
[57:49] perspective that you are seeing it from
[57:51] because it all depends on your position
[57:54] now I would give a natural type to this
[57:56] my brother and sister if I stand on this
[57:58] side of the church and I look across the
[58:01] church I will not be the same view that
[58:04] I will have if I am standing on
[58:06] this side of the church looking and when
[58:08] we stand outside the veil of God's Word
[58:11] and look at the word it is ink on the
[58:15] page oh but when we get in the spirit
[58:19] when we get to the place we say Lord I
[58:23] need you more than that very breadth of
[58:26] my body the very nutrition of my body I
[58:29] need you more than my very life the view
[58:32] starts to change Oh hallelujah Amen and
[58:38] I'll tell you my brother and sister you
[58:40] may not ever find a picture you might
[58:42] not ever find a painting you might not
[58:44] ever see as part of a frame of a video
[58:49] or movie that would tell you but each
[58:51] one of you could tonight say you know
[58:54] there's a time there's a place I've
[58:56] stood on say the rim of the Grand Canyon
[58:58] as the Sun set and I wished I had that
[59:01] picture but it's forever in your mind
[59:06] and a son or daughter of God when they
[59:09] have ever went beyond the Riven veil and
[59:11] they got that view of Jesus Christ the
[59:15] whole world around them might say we
[59:18] don't know what you're talking about we
[59:20] think you've gone crazy
[59:21] that you can't take that image that's
[59:25] been burnt into the mind and the heart
[59:27] and soul of a son or daughter of God
[59:29] they cannot unsee that
[59:31] when the word is open to you you cannot
[59:34] unsee that when God has said I am here
[59:37] in your present and you are touched by
[59:40] the word and he's writing on the fleshly
[59:43] table of your heart you can't undo that
[59:45] oh I say thank you Lord because
[59:48] otherwise the cares of this life and the
[59:51] things of this life would erase our you
[59:55] ask me it would erase what God is doing
[59:58] in her life but you see God marked an
[1:00:02] indelible mark that changed right down
[1:00:05] to the very fiber of our being and while
[1:00:07] Satan would do his best to erase it he
[1:00:11] can't well hallelujah
[1:00:14] thank you lord Oh amen
[1:00:19] it's being written on and lived out by
[1:00:21] the believer because you see it's not
[1:00:24] just on a table of stone which my
[1:00:26] brother and sister we could take our
[1:00:27] Bible tonight and say this would be the
[1:00:30] modern-day equivalent of the table of
[1:00:33] stone this would be a modern-day version
[1:00:35] of the written word of God our Ten
[1:00:38] Commandments is right here but it's not
[1:00:40] in stone right it's on ink and paper but
[1:00:43] he said we're not gonna write it a man
[1:00:45] with the ink upon the page we're gonna
[1:00:48] write it on your heart and you I don't
[1:00:49] know what will be in the future for us
[1:00:51] my brother and sister so many different
[1:00:54] ideas about how that there in time will
[1:00:56] come down and you know people say that
[1:00:59] net oh we're gonna all go through the
[1:01:00] tribulation everybody gives her life
[1:01:02] that way well I believe what the prophet
[1:01:04] of God taught us he's got too much
[1:01:06] example too much a Word of God showing
[1:01:09] us as it was that Joseph and his wife
[1:01:11] were gone from the myths not always
[1:01:13] these things my brother and sister I
[1:01:14] don't know what tomorrow holds but
[1:01:17] there's one thing I know if they take
[1:01:19] our message away they take our Bible
[1:01:21] away they cannot erase Christ from our
[1:01:25] heart and don't matter what they do my
[1:01:28] brother and sister Oh God give us a kind
[1:01:31] of anointing encourage it Shadrach
[1:01:33] Meshach and Abednego had give us a kind
[1:01:35] of courage that Daniel had when he said
[1:01:38] I'm gonna pray anyhow he could have just
[1:01:40] as easily closed the shutters and prayed
[1:01:43] behind the shutter but what did he do he
[1:01:45] threw the shutters open and he said I am
[1:01:48] NOT going to let them change my
[1:01:51] relationship with God why because it was
[1:01:55] engraved on his heart
[1:01:56] amen it was not something that he went
[1:01:59] to church to get it was something that
[1:02:01] was placed in him and it was written by
[1:02:03] the Spirit of the Living God hallelujah
[1:02:06] if a man had wrote it on there a man
[1:02:08] could take it away but when God writes
[1:02:11] it on there there's no man can take it
[1:02:13] away Oh hallelujah
[1:02:15] you know such trust verse four my
[1:02:19] brother and sister and such trust have
[1:02:22] we through Christ to God Word now I tell
[1:02:25] you that's what it comes down to
[1:02:27] if we don't have trust if we don't have
[1:02:30] trust we're just will backpedal Saints
[1:02:33] but when you trust God my brother and
[1:02:36] sister there's just well
[1:02:38] our flesh hmm our flesh let me drive
[1:02:45] that home our flesh amen but when he was
[1:02:51] talking about the fleshly table of our
[1:02:53] heart he wasn't talking about this flesh
[1:02:54] he was talking about that place prepared
[1:02:57] for his word amen actually speaking of
[1:03:00] the Soul
[1:03:01] hallelujah so we have a trust through
[1:03:04] Christ good to God were not that we are
[1:03:06] sufficient you know that's one of the
[1:03:08] most interesting things of humanity is
[1:03:11] that man gets a little money in the bank
[1:03:13] man gets a little influence he gets a
[1:03:15] following as it were my brother and
[1:03:17] sister and they start to feel like they
[1:03:19] are sufficient in themselves but my
[1:03:21] brother and sister we're not to think of
[1:03:23] anything of ourselves all that we are
[1:03:26] Amen every day everything about us is
[1:03:29] Christ and Christ alone hallelujah we
[1:03:34] would look just like the world amen we
[1:03:37] will act and live just like the world if
[1:03:39] Christ was not in us amen so we are not
[1:03:43] sufficient of ourselves amen but our
[1:03:46] sufficiency is of God amen will you say
[1:03:49] that with me tonight our sufficiency is
[1:03:52] of God amen who has also made us well
[1:03:58] not the sisters not the children not the
[1:04:02] laity is that what it says no he's made
[1:04:06] every single one of us a minister of the
[1:04:10] New Testament not of the letter but of
[1:04:16] the spirit for the letter killeth but
[1:04:20] the spirit giveth life now I remember
[1:04:23] many years ago my brother and sister and
[1:04:26] when the message first come into the
[1:04:28] valley little church and you know a lot
[1:04:32] of things happen and people would go
[1:04:34] from house to house of people they were
[1:04:36] acquainted with and they are they they
[1:04:39] spoke of them of the letter and if you
[1:04:41] believe this your serpent see people who
[1:04:44] didn't even know what serpent seed was
[1:04:46] people who didn't know what Malachi 4
[1:04:50] was revelations 10 was right and they
[1:04:53] gave them what they called the word test
[1:04:55] and then they would come back and almost
[1:04:57] in a boastful way say well they fail my
[1:05:02] brother and sister that immunity that
[1:05:05] they created created an atmosphere that
[1:05:08] was not conducive to witness to anyone
[1:05:11] that's not what we're called to do amen
[1:05:15] we're called to live such a life that
[1:05:17] the neighbor who thinks you're a little
[1:05:19] crazy because you sisters don't cut your
[1:05:21] hair and you wear a dress they think you
[1:05:23] brothers are a little crazy because just
[1:05:25] like a thing I purchased here the other
[1:05:27] day the man's like well I'll leave them
[1:05:29] on the bill of sale I'll leave the money
[1:05:32] amount out and you can put any number
[1:05:34] you want in there because we don't have
[1:05:36] to give the government the money but the
[1:05:38] problem is if I lie on that I am a liar
[1:05:42] it's not just whether the government
[1:05:44] deserves that tax money or not my
[1:05:47] brother and sister you see if we find
[1:05:50] ourselves with a double standard it will
[1:05:52] move from one to the next to the next to
[1:05:54] the next and our life becomes a double
[1:05:56] standard and it won't be long till those
[1:05:59] around you see a double standard it
[1:06:01] won't be long before your whole life is
[1:06:03] reflective of a double standard amen so
[1:06:06] what we got to do oh you know the
[1:06:08] devil's like yeah the government doesn't
[1:06:10] deserve that but you know I told sister
[1:06:12] Geri I says well just we'll fill that
[1:06:14] right out with the correct number on
[1:06:16] there because I'm not going to let the
[1:06:17] sales tax on something keep me from the
[1:06:20] kingdom of God hallelujah my you talk
[1:06:23] about crazy but you see the temptation
[1:06:26] is there the justification so you see we
[1:06:30] are ministers of the New Testament not
[1:06:32] to go out and preach the letter of the
[1:06:34] law but letting our life you see the
[1:06:37] spirit that is in you and I amen will be
[1:06:42] lived out and be reflected or projected
[1:06:45] to mankind Oh God let it be the true
[1:06:48] light amen let it be the truth that is
[1:06:51] reflecting out the people that say I
[1:06:53] don't agree with
[1:06:54] them I think they're different but they
[1:06:56] are real amen hallelujah but of the
[1:06:59] spirit for the letter killeth but the
[1:07:01] spirit giveth life now as we look at
[1:07:04] this my brother and sister every one of
[1:07:06] us is a minister of the gospel
[1:07:08] amen amen every single day we are
[1:07:11] ministers of the gospel and as we look
[1:07:13] at this we recognize that now as we jump
[1:07:16] down to verse 17 once again to touch on
[1:07:19] this amen
[1:07:20] look now the Lord is that spirit I got
[1:07:26] to go back and find it but I have found
[1:07:29] a lovely quote the other day and we were
[1:07:31] driving and I'm I thought I had wrote it
[1:07:33] down and I didn't but you know brother
[1:07:35] branham was talking about when Jesus
[1:07:38] body was laying in the tomb dead the
[1:07:44] Spirit of God come back to that body
[1:07:48] what is the spirit of life amen
[1:07:52] so you see right here now the Lord is
[1:07:54] that spirit and where the Spirit of the
[1:07:57] Lord is there is Liberty
[1:07:59] but you see we can take that Liberty my
[1:08:03] brother and sister and we can translate
[1:08:05] that if you'll just be kind to me we can
[1:08:07] take that and they'll tell you where the
[1:08:09] Spirit of the Lord is there is life amen
[1:08:12] that's the real Liberty we're looking
[1:08:14] for we're not looking as it were for
[1:08:16] liberty in the flesh to do as we want or
[1:08:19] the Liberty that you know oh that once
[1:08:21] saved always saved a Liberty to behave
[1:08:24] in a certain fashion but you see
[1:08:26] wherever the Spirit of the Lord is there
[1:08:28] is Liberty which means I have been
[1:08:31] liberated from the pit of hell through
[1:08:33] sin amen
[1:08:35] I have been liberated in the name of
[1:08:37] Jesus Christ from all of the debt that I
[1:08:40] could not have paid for myself I have
[1:08:43] been liberated from the boundaries that
[1:08:45] Satan would put on us you realize Satan
[1:08:48] don't care if you go to church he just
[1:08:50] don't want you to take anything home
[1:08:52] with you all right you start taking
[1:08:54] things home with you he starts getting
[1:08:56] concerned amen you know it's kind of
[1:08:59] like eating at a restaurant I've ate it
[1:09:01] a couple like this they serve such huge
[1:09:03] portions that as you're finishing up
[1:09:04] your meal they automatically bring you a
[1:09:07] little box
[1:09:08] amen because they know that they gave
[1:09:10] you more than you could take home now
[1:09:13] look I give that little example because
[1:09:15] I want to just kind of stir you a little
[1:09:18] bit amen I pray that you would pray that
[1:09:21] God would call me in this church and
[1:09:23] start serving us portions that our box
[1:09:27] is completely full amen and we walk out
[1:09:31] completely full and there was still some
[1:09:34] leftover amen let's not come and say you
[1:09:37] know what just get me a little box
[1:09:39] that's all I need to take home with me
[1:09:41] no give me a big box amen and I want the
[1:09:45] Spirit of God to fill up with the
[1:09:48] leftovers I wanted to be filled up in
[1:09:50] that box
[1:09:51] that is so big that I can barely carried
[1:09:53] out the door and when I get home and
[1:09:55] open it up again what I received already
[1:09:58] I get another taste Oh hallelujah
[1:10:03] Amen because you see where the Spirit of
[1:10:06] the Lord is there is Liberty to take the
[1:10:09] spirit home with us Amen Donna called
[1:10:12] formal not bound to this not bound to
[1:10:15] that not bound to a ritual not bound to
[1:10:18] a deal just talking to a brother he was
[1:10:20] pretty funny because he was sharing this
[1:10:22] idea he said you know he said I was
[1:10:25] sitting in a church service and he said
[1:10:27] I was thinking to myself uh
[1:10:29] you know sometimes these song services
[1:10:31] are really really really long amen and
[1:10:35] he said he just kind of thought that to
[1:10:37] himself but he was like lord help me I
[1:10:38] just you don't want to receive so that
[1:10:40] pastor had a question-and-answer service
[1:10:42] and so then somebody turned in a
[1:10:45] question and said you know why are our
[1:10:49] song services so long and the pastor's
[1:10:53] response was because that's the way they
[1:10:56] are
[1:11:00] come on so then he went and asked the
[1:11:05] pastor himself you know kind of for an
[1:11:08] explanation and and the pastor didn't
[1:11:12] brush him off but just kind of said well
[1:11:14] you know that's just how it is a little
[1:11:18] more singing a little less singing more
[1:11:20] tonight
[1:11:22] tomorrow night more on Sunday less you
[1:11:26] see he never gave him a fixed answer why
[1:11:29] is our service as long as it is because
[1:11:35] that's the way it is
[1:11:39] some can't handle that but I'll tell you
[1:11:43] my brother and sister I'd rather say
[1:11:45] give me a bigger box I've got a lot to
[1:11:48] take home with me I've got a lot to take
[1:11:51] home with it or we could just starve you
[1:11:52] to death amen
[1:11:55] instead of two pieces of fried chicken
[1:11:57] we'll give you one instead of that one
[1:12:00] drumstick that came off a super chicken
[1:12:02] we'll give you one that come off of
[1:12:03] banty amen now we'll be able to say we
[1:12:07] fed you but you'll leave hungry you see
[1:12:11] somewhere along the line we got to
[1:12:13] decide what it is we want amen if God
[1:12:16] desires to serve a seven-course meal to
[1:12:18] you
[1:12:19] amen don't say look I'm fine after the
[1:12:21] second course amen be of good courage
[1:12:24] keep asking him bring it on I want to
[1:12:28] see what the third course in the fourth
[1:12:29] course and the fifth course and the
[1:12:31] sixth and the seventh amen because the
[1:12:33] seventh might be dessert that is so
[1:12:35] glorious
[1:12:36] that even though you know you shouldn't
[1:12:38] eat it you will anyhow amen so where the
[1:12:41] Lord is that spirit my brother and
[1:12:43] sister when the spirit moves I'm talking
[1:12:45] about the real Holy Ghost spirit I'm not
[1:12:47] talking about just getting caught up in
[1:12:48] an emotion that we're sitting in church
[1:12:50] oh this is good this is good this is
[1:12:52] good he said everything I like amen all
[1:12:55] he ruined this service by saying I
[1:12:56] didn't mind alike no we're not talking
[1:12:58] about that kind of atmosphere we're
[1:13:00] talking about the Spirit of the Lord
[1:13:01] which is the very life of Jesus Christ
[1:13:04] poured out on you and I oh my goodness
[1:13:07] if God come down here tonight and spoke
[1:13:09] to each one of us individually and said
[1:13:11] tonight I'm gonna pour my very life into
[1:13:15] you my brother and sister it would be a
[1:13:17] crazy man I was gonna say fool but we're
[1:13:20] not supposed to use those words but it'd
[1:13:22] be a crazy man
[1:13:25] never turn and walk off if God come and
[1:13:28] said I'm gonna pour my life into you but
[1:13:29] did you know my brother and sister how
[1:13:31] many times the Spirit of the Lord
[1:13:35] moves in our midst and we walked out and
[1:13:37] the prophet of God used that words it's
[1:13:39] like Peas on a dry cowhide hey man oh
[1:13:42] God don't let us be guilty of that
[1:13:43] Saints don't let us be guilty I'm not
[1:13:46] playing on your emotion I'm just telling
[1:13:48] you look at that factually look at it as
[1:13:50] reality Lord I'm gonna come and no
[1:13:53] matter how I feel I'm gonna say Lord
[1:13:56] pour it on me hallelujah I want more and
[1:13:59] more and more and more hallelujah
[1:14:00] because you see when the Spirit of the
[1:14:02] Lord is in the building it doesn't give
[1:14:05] liberty to everyone amen some people
[1:14:08] will walk out just as bound as they
[1:14:10] walked in it is to those who have opened
[1:14:13] up and received that that find liberty
[1:14:16] and then forever there is Liberty well
[1:14:19] let's see Liberty means that you can't
[1:14:21] clap real loud but you can clap Liberty
[1:14:26] means you can say Amen but just not too
[1:14:28] many times no my brother and sister
[1:14:31] Liberty is Liberty Amen it's all Oh
[1:14:36] hallelujah it's all of this word
[1:14:39] liberated for you and I tonight every
[1:14:43] bit that we need tonight has been
[1:14:46] liberated for you and I to take
[1:14:48] possession of it and respond to it and
[1:14:51] put it to work in our life Oh aren't you
[1:14:54] glad tonight hallelujah oh my I love
[1:15:00] that where the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:15:02] there is Liberty now I want to just go
[1:15:05] right here and I want to just look at
[1:15:08] this right here
[1:15:10] Ephesians church age I didn't have a
[1:15:13] paragraph on that I guess I kind of cut
[1:15:16] that off sorry no matter how just an
[1:15:20] upright a Christian is before the public
[1:15:22] and how gracious he is to his fellow man
[1:15:27] doing not but good let him confess
[1:15:31] Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the
[1:15:35] operation the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:38] now my brother and sister many people I
[1:15:40] know some good folks that believe if you
[1:15:43] haven't spoke in tongues you don't have
[1:15:44] the Holy Ghost but this just a
[1:15:48] manifestation
[1:15:48] of the spirit amen it's not the evidence
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:54] you got you got people that are well we
[1:15:56] won't go into that some very
[1:15:58] interestingly documented cases of
[1:16:00] Ministers video after video of them
[1:16:03] speaking in tongues from the pulpit and
[1:16:05] they've embezzled all their church's
[1:16:08] money they've done all kinds of
[1:16:09] unspeakable things but they spoke in
[1:16:12] tongues mmm see my brother and sister I
[1:16:16] wouldn't be a bit surprised somewhere on
[1:16:18] the earth there's been a bank robber
[1:16:19] that spoke in tongues the two don't go
[1:16:23] together do that spirit and tongues
[1:16:27] prophecy healing and miracle and he will
[1:16:29] be condemned in other words if you say
[1:16:32] whatever God's got for me whatever God's
[1:16:33] got for our church I want it
[1:16:35] amen people start to move you right over
[1:16:37] in the fringe of that well you know the
[1:16:39] Prophet said we don't need that anymore
[1:16:41] yeah misunderstand what he was saying he
[1:16:43] was saying that's not the evidence he
[1:16:45] didn't say it was absent from the church
[1:16:47] he didn't say that that's now been
[1:16:49] erased or scrubbed out of the life of
[1:16:51] the believer
[1:16:52] amen it's just not what we put our
[1:16:54] confidence in that once we've done that
[1:16:56] amen so is that but the minute you start
[1:16:59] to acknowledge the operation of the
[1:17:01] gifts tongues prophecy healing miracles
[1:17:03] he will be condemned the spirit of this
[1:17:05] world it's actually this last portion I
[1:17:07] really wanted to drive home the spirit
[1:17:09] of this world hates the Spirit of God
[1:17:11] and because it can't whoa thank you Lord
[1:17:15] because it can't overcome the Spirit of
[1:17:19] the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel
[1:17:21] in whom the spirit of truth dwells now
[1:17:24] you wonder why you have struggles
[1:17:26] sometimes Amen the devil knows he can't
[1:17:29] overcome the God that's in you so he's
[1:17:31] going to hammer away at you amen
[1:17:34] trying to discredit the God that's in
[1:17:37] you by discrediting you but my brother
[1:17:40] and sister the Holy Ghost amen
[1:17:42] just like the brother said it's not a
[1:17:44] matter of how many times you fall down
[1:17:46] it's a matter of how many times you get
[1:17:48] up amen so we'll make our mistakes but
[1:17:51] we don't we don't revel in that or use
[1:17:53] that as an excuse like well praise the
[1:17:55] Lord Grace will cover my mistakes my
[1:17:57] brother and sister it ought to tear our
[1:17:58] heart out when we make mistakes but I'll
[1:18:00] tell you what we ought to be standing up
[1:18:02] in
[1:18:02] process while we're repenting hey man we
[1:18:04] ought to be standing up to saying thank
[1:18:06] you Lord because I realize this is not
[1:18:09] God letting me down this is the devil
[1:18:11] attacking me but you realize he can't
[1:18:14] even get to you unless God let him know
[1:18:16] God wouldn't break the continuity of
[1:18:18] what he did to Joe right he can't make
[1:18:21] job the only guy in the Bible that he
[1:18:23] opened the hedge for otherwise it would
[1:18:25] be unfair to job amen so God's got
[1:18:28] enough confidence in you and I tonight
[1:18:30] he's got enough confidence in what he's
[1:18:32] written on the table of your heart
[1:18:34] amen that he will just say you know what
[1:18:36] Satan you you have your opportunity you
[1:18:39] can do this but you can't overcome this
[1:18:43] spirit that's in my children you can't
[1:18:45] overcome that and I encourage you
[1:18:47] tonight just go open up and let that
[1:18:49] spirit live amen give that spirit room
[1:18:52] to grow
[1:18:53] give that spirit the opportunity to just
[1:18:56] show its power in its majesty and all
[1:18:59] that God has given in that in the moving
[1:19:02] of the holy spirit and it will come
[1:19:04] because you see Satan he cannot overcome
[1:19:06] the Spirit of the Lord and if this
[1:19:08] vessel and I say the word if it's up to
[1:19:11] you to claim that Amen no one else no
[1:19:13] preacher no person whatever can say
[1:19:15] you're in or you're out it's up to you
[1:19:17] to say it's in me the life of Christ is
[1:19:20] in me the Holy Ghost is in me the Spirit
[1:19:23] of the Lord is in me amen I am a
[1:19:26] predestinated I am what the word said I
[1:19:29] will be Oh hallelujah and when you come
[1:19:33] to that place you realize he cannot
[1:19:36] destroy the vessel hallelujah that ought
[1:19:41] to have us tearing the turf up hey man
[1:19:44] cuz the devil he can howl he can holler
[1:19:47] Amen sister Bonnie I was thinking about
[1:19:49] you I was gonna make a joke kinda and
[1:19:52] then I didn't and now I'm going to Amen
[1:19:54] even if you got to have new hips and
[1:19:56] knees and elbows and arms and shoulders
[1:19:58] and whatever it is it don't matter my
[1:20:01] brother and sister
[1:20:01] this body might wear out with the word
[1:20:04] that's living on the inside is growing
[1:20:06] every single day God is still writing
[1:20:10] amen it wasn't just when we received the
[1:20:13] message it wasn't just when we got
[1:20:14] baptized it
[1:20:15] when we received the Holy Ghost and God
[1:20:18] finished riding there he's writing on
[1:20:20] the table of our heart every single day
[1:20:23] Oh God
[1:20:25] keep riding amen he's still riding on me
[1:20:28] and I say thank you Lord because it's
[1:20:31] when he moved away my brother and sister
[1:20:32] that's when you help problems hallelujah
[1:20:35] oh thank you Lord amen you see this
[1:20:39] world hates the Spirit of God because it
[1:20:43] can't overcome the Spirit of the Lord
[1:20:46] now my brother and sister it's
[1:20:48] interesting it isn't very hard to find
[1:20:50] some of these clips but you will find
[1:20:53] commentary that's being spoken in the
[1:20:56] day that we live in a news reporter back
[1:20:59] east just somewhat recent not super
[1:21:01] recent but somewhat recent made a
[1:21:03] declaration right on a TV show or a
[1:21:06] newscast thing that it's the Christians
[1:21:09] that are the problem hmm
[1:21:13] imagine that you see what Satan's doing
[1:21:15] he's making the case it's trying to make
[1:21:18] the case because Satan wants to bring it
[1:21:19] around where humanity will destroy
[1:21:21] humanity just like we saw in world war
[1:21:23] two just like we saw through the ages
[1:21:26] humanity destroy humanity believing
[1:21:29] they've destroyed the vessel oh but it's
[1:21:33] not this vessel that God's riding on
[1:21:36] amen otherwise my brother and sister
[1:21:39] when we get older our life you know
[1:21:42] starts the light starts to dim Satan
[1:21:45] would be whole I've snuffed the light
[1:21:46] but you see actually that throws Satan
[1:21:49] into a frenzy because he realizes his
[1:21:51] time to truly destroy the vessel is
[1:21:54] slipping away from him the world views
[1:21:57] it in years and time and health and
[1:21:59] condition and all these kind of things
[1:22:00] God doesn't look at it even in the same
[1:22:03] similarity oh my brother and sister
[1:22:05] isn't that beautiful what God's doing
[1:22:07] his Road on the heart and it's so
[1:22:09] indelibly embedded into us it has
[1:22:12] changed our very I've been speaking to
[1:22:15] you about DNA it's changed our very DNA
[1:22:18] that we no longer even identify in this
[1:22:21] weird I no longer even identify as it
[1:22:24] were as a human I identify myself as a
[1:22:28] son of
[1:22:30] I am NOT a human because humans are
[1:22:32] frail and they fail and they fall apart
[1:22:35] and they turn into Iraq and they
[1:22:37] disappear from the face of humanity but
[1:22:39] my brother and sisters son or daughter
[1:22:41] of God is marked in the presence of God
[1:22:43] for time and eternity to always dwell in
[1:22:46] his presence I say thank you Lord and to
[1:22:49] have that understanding of the word the
[1:22:51] prophet of God says if you weren't his
[1:22:54] in the beginning then you wouldn't be
[1:22:56] his now amen so you can't be his now if
[1:22:59] you weren't in him in the beginning and
[1:23:01] the word how showed us we are in him
[1:23:05] hallelujah how is that my brother and
[1:23:07] sister now you know I say this lightly a
[1:23:10] brother did this to me years ago he goes
[1:23:11] well brother Paul he says it must be
[1:23:13] glorious to be beYOU and I was like
[1:23:15] really he goes well yeah he said I pick
[1:23:18] up my Bible and start reading in your
[1:23:20] names all over the New Testament I was
[1:23:25] like well thank you brother I like that
[1:23:27] it made that where the prophet of God
[1:23:29] said you should be able to find yourself
[1:23:30] in the Bible made a real real to me can
[1:23:32] I can I start sharing that with you here
[1:23:34] amen but look my brother and sister
[1:23:37] every one of us every one of us by
[1:23:39] revelation what is it by what he's
[1:23:41] written on our heart identifies us in
[1:23:44] the word it's not that we could search
[1:23:47] until we found something that would what
[1:23:49] we could grasp a hold of it's reading
[1:23:51] the word knowing about behold I send you
[1:23:54] Oh hallelujah he's sending me a prophet
[1:24:04] come on you identifying that why it's
[1:24:08] because it's written on your heart it's
[1:24:10] so real to you that no matter what
[1:24:12] anyone says you you identify you
[1:24:15] identify with that what happens would
[1:24:18] come to a place we're confessing what is
[1:24:21] written about us I look through the
[1:24:24] Bible my brother and sister I see a word
[1:24:26] I know it's for you but I look through
[1:24:28] the word and I look scripture after
[1:24:30] scripture yep written for me written for
[1:24:32] me written for me written for me written
[1:24:34] for me he that are overcomers written
[1:24:38] for me amen
[1:24:40] to the saints written to me
[1:24:42] hallelujah amen it's real my brother and
[1:24:46] sister why because it's been written
[1:24:48] right here deep down inside and we can
[1:24:52] rejoice because we hear the word and it
[1:24:55] corresponds write the word calling out
[1:24:59] to the word and the word responding whoa
[1:25:03] praise the Lord amen so we can hear the
[1:25:06] word being preached and there's
[1:25:08] something inside of us that says yes
[1:25:10] that's who I am yes that's what God
[1:25:14] promised to his bride and that's me
[1:25:17] Oh hallelujah it's not hype it's nice
[1:25:20] psychology it's not some brainwashing
[1:25:23] some kind of cult thing it is something
[1:25:25] that rises up but back to the veil and
[1:25:27] then we'll close sister Amy if you'll
[1:25:29] come my brother and sister if they
[1:25:31] haven't been behind the veil they don't
[1:25:34] have a clue what you're talking about
[1:25:39] because without that behind the veil
[1:25:41] experience this is all I don't even know
[1:25:44] if we should pick on the Greeks but we
[1:25:46] use that phrase it's all Greek my
[1:25:49] brother and sister aren't you glad
[1:25:51] tonight God's been writing on your soul
[1:25:53] writing on the table of your heart amen
[1:25:57] because it's there that oh there's so
[1:26:00] many things sometimes you know but you
[1:26:03] just read the word read the message and
[1:26:05] when you tie all of that starts coming
[1:26:07] together and you start to realize my
[1:26:10] brother's sister the continuity of the
[1:26:11] word people say well we really like the
[1:26:14] quotes after 1963
[1:26:18] really we were just listening to a tape
[1:26:22] I might be wrong I think it was like 56
[1:26:24] 54 56 the other day I don't know we were
[1:26:31] kind of tired
[1:26:32] maybe we hallucinate it but it was so
[1:26:38] real there were so many nuggets in it I
[1:26:40] was like wow so do those that want to
[1:26:44] put a time thing if it's not from this
[1:26:46] point to this point after the opening of
[1:26:48] the seals or whatever it might be we
[1:26:50] really don't put a lot of emphasis on it
[1:26:53] well I'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:26:57] brother brems ministry corrected itself
[1:27:01] you might say God dealing with him you
[1:27:03] know he thought the Whitehorse you know
[1:27:05] things like that God corrects him on
[1:27:07] that but you don't see a wholesale
[1:27:10] remodel of the message where people
[1:27:14] would like to like well you know no I'm
[1:27:17] sorry I'm sorry
[1:27:19] just like you and I might read a quote
[1:27:22] and kind of get a different conclusion
[1:27:25] you see God has continuity and that
[1:27:29] continuity comes down into the simple
[1:27:32] phrase at work I began in you I will
[1:27:38] finish o my brother and sister many a
[1:27:42] person says I started to write a book
[1:27:44] but I never finished
[1:27:50] if they felt the urge to start it why
[1:27:53] didn't they finish because the cares of
[1:27:57] life circumstance trouble but God didn't
[1:28:05] finished halfway he didn't stop I should
[1:28:09] say halfway he said the work I began in
[1:28:13] youth this revelation of the Spirit of
[1:28:16] the Lord riding on our hearts the book
[1:28:21] will be finished actually the prophet of
[1:28:24] God says it is finished it's already
[1:28:28] done
[1:28:28] amen God's just allowing it to be
[1:28:31] revealed out in the hour that we live in
[1:28:33] day by day
[1:28:35] circumstance by circumstance oh my
[1:28:38] brother and sister we're actually living
[1:28:40] out the prophecy Oh get this now just
[1:28:44] because prophecy can't be found in the
[1:28:46] written page but when God called us
[1:28:48] before the foundation of the world we
[1:28:51] become a manifestation of the spoken
[1:28:53] word see that birds out there coming to
[1:28:59] pass
[1:28:59] the power of the spoken word remember
[1:29:02] brother Branham said now God might have
[1:29:04] said let there be water it wasn't there
[1:29:09] was water an indeterminate amount of
[1:29:12] time might have went by but because that
[1:29:15] word was spoken water had to appear and
[1:29:19] we are a product manifestation of the
[1:29:23] spoken word Here I am Lord right on me
[1:29:28] right on me Lord every bit of life and
[1:29:32] every bit of overcoming power the very
[1:29:35] word of my Lord Jesus Christ write it
[1:29:37] Lord
[1:29:38] write it oh isn't it so good to serve
[1:29:41] the Lord Saints hallelujah John 18:36
[1:29:46] I thought this might be a lovely
[1:29:47] scripture just to close with if the son
[1:29:51] therefore make you free ye shall be free
[1:29:55] indeed oh I tell you there is he was
[1:29:59] going to Calvary
[1:30:01] all that it was transpiring and everyone
[1:30:06] must have been so shook up to see our
[1:30:08] Lord Jesus they couldn't quite fathom it
[1:30:11] but I tell you my brother and sister he
[1:30:14] had to come to the place that hanging on
[1:30:17] the cross he said it is finished it is
[1:30:22] finished you know what that is I kind of
[1:30:23] miss stated that early forgive me the
[1:30:25] way I worded that but you see when you
[1:30:29] write a book some authors close with a
[1:30:34] period some authors say the end some
[1:30:40] authors let you know there's more to
[1:30:44] come
[1:30:45] that's what the Word of God has done so
[1:30:48] just think about how beautiful heaven
[1:30:50] must be this this isn't just the soul
[1:30:54] life of people say well I've sacrificed
[1:30:56] to serve the Lord
[1:30:57] oh please change that thinking start
[1:31:01] saying it's privilege I have been
[1:31:04] privileged by Almighty God to serve Him
[1:31:09] my time on earth I've been privileged to
[1:31:12] go through the trial that I'm going
[1:31:14] through I've been privileged to be
[1:31:16] filled with the Holy Ghost I've been
[1:31:19] privileged to be able to say I'm a son
[1:31:21] or a daughter of God let's get rid of
[1:31:24] the burden let's put the burden to the
[1:31:27] side that's the flesh speaking hey man
[1:31:29] don't let yourself be condemned over
[1:31:31] that but that's just a flesh seeking but
[1:31:32] it's a privilege my brother and sister
[1:31:35] that God declared it is finished what
[1:31:39] I'm going to write when I am writing
[1:31:40] everything is complete and I close with
[1:31:44] this thought as a prophet of God said
[1:31:47] everything you need to make the rapture
[1:31:51] would you give me a Liberty tonight
[1:31:54] everything you need has already been
[1:31:58] written upon you only a cheater and I am
[1:32:05] one starts a book and then goes and
[1:32:08] reads the last chapter but my brother
[1:32:12] and sister you see God's just revealing
[1:32:13] this in you and I Amen everything that's
[1:32:17] there we don't see the end but I know
[1:32:19] what the end says he says you're
[1:32:23] redeemed you're my son you're my
[1:32:25] daughter oh you know I've got something
[1:32:28] I better not mention too much these two
[1:32:30] ministers around here are rough on my
[1:32:32] thoughts amen but I tell you what my
[1:32:35] brother and sister gods made
[1:32:36] reservations and you know there's a
[1:32:40] point beyond a reservation sometimes is
[1:32:43] only merely the chance that you would
[1:32:45] have a table at a certain time say in a
[1:32:48] restaurant but there are other times
[1:32:50] that a reservation is concrete and no
[1:32:54] matter who is in front of you and who is
[1:32:56] behind you that is yours I want to leave
[1:33:00] you with this tidbit I've got a spot
[1:33:03] before the throne I don't know where
[1:33:05] it's at
[1:33:07] but it's reserved I got a spot at the
[1:33:11] marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:33:13] there'll be a little golden basta if you
[1:33:16] know what I'm talkin about
[1:33:17] that's gonna show that that seed is not
[1:33:20] just by chance that seat is reserved
[1:33:24] hallelujah and when he placed you and I
[1:33:27] in the Lamb's Book of Life it was the
[1:33:29] only reservation that we as a believer
[1:33:32] needed everything else he has taken care
[1:33:36] of amen

[1:33:39] Jonathan there in Colorado lovely
[1:33:42] conversation and you know my brother in
[1:33:45] stir when you when you look at that and

[1:33:58] can take our place
[1:34:00] no one Amen you're not going to walk in
[1:34:03] and say I thought no reserved Amen

[1:34:13] being cast in outer darkness we've got a
[1:34:17] reservation to stand before the throne

[1:34:43] prophet of God told it right there the
[1:34:44] spirit of this world dislikes you enough

[1:40:17] to say children you will eat what is set
[1:40:19] before you sometimes you go to a
[1:40:23] restaurant they set an awful lot in
[1:40:25] front of you and you feel compelled to
[1:40:28] eat it all but remember with the word we
[1:40:33] can take the Spirit of the Lord home
[1:40:34] with us we can take them right into our
[1:40:37] kitchen into our living room into our
[1:40:39] bedroom amen the garage in the car
[1:40:42] wherever it is so you don't have to
[1:40:44] worry about consuming too much tonight
[1:40:46] they'll be leftovers hallelujah
[1:40:50] keep me Jesus as the apple of mine
[1:40:57] I'm beyond Earth
[1:41:00] I can't say me less I know
[1:41:11] PP Jesus eyes yapple of mine ah
[1:41:16] Oh keep me Jesus and temple of mine ah
[1:41:23] I'd be under the shadow of my way
[1:41:30] our Lord can't see me as I know
[1:41:36] Oh beeping Jesus an apple of my na
[1:41:43] Oh keep me Jesus I be under the shadow
[1:41:53] of my way
[1:41:58] and save me less I die
