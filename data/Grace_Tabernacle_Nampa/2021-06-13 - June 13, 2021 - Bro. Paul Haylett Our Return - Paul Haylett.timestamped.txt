[28:56] pray the lord just bless you today
[28:59] amen is it good to serve the lord today
[29:02] amen you know i just want to say this
[29:05] that
[29:06] we have the third row on on my
[29:09] left here is what i would call the
[29:11] veterans role
[29:13] and um we look right here and when i say
[29:16] that i say that as a great compliment
[29:19] because here is the evidence of the
[29:22] keeping power of god right here in our
[29:24] midst we don't have to look somewhere
[29:26] else
[29:27] we can see that how lives can be blessed
[29:30] and
[29:30] enjoyed and and fully given as a
[29:33] testimony to our lord jesus christ
[29:36] and the ages passed quickly don't they
[29:39] but how glorious it is and
[29:42] amen brother william god bless you my
[29:46] friend
[29:46] happy to see you back amen i pray that
[29:49] your travels were good
[29:51] and a blessing to you and good to see
[29:53] you here in the house of god
[29:56] hallelujah to each and every one of you
[29:57] this morning i say god bless you
[30:00] let's just go into our thought uh
[30:03] quickly today i i
[30:06] just have quite a bit that i want to
[30:09] share with you today and
[30:11] i want to do it in the shortest time
[30:13] possible i want to speak to you this
[30:15] morning
[30:16] on our return and then i would have as
[30:19] it were a
[30:19] subtitle to that to
[30:23] our correct position and i
[30:26] i believe that you will understand that
[30:29] as we press
[30:30] forward brother david sister diane
[30:32] sister ruth send their greetings this
[30:34] morning
[30:35] brother david has shared that the lord
[30:38] just blessed their time
[30:40] in the services and to the ministry
[30:43] was right on time to the needs of the
[30:46] people and
[30:46] we know that that can only be god
[30:49] because there's no
[30:50] way you can travel halfway across the
[30:52] country and know
[30:53] exactly what's going on in someone's
[30:55] life in fact we can't even drive
[30:58] the short distance to grace and know
[31:00] what's going on in someone's life but
[31:02] the lord does
[31:04] amen and he's always right on time he
[31:06] knows exactly
[31:08] what he needs you know the world you
[31:10] know scientific they say let's believe
[31:12] science let's believe science and
[31:13] science says there's no way a whale
[31:15] found jonah
[31:17] and swallowed him and spit him out on
[31:20] the shore
[31:21] but my brother and sister i look at that
[31:24] and i
[31:24] understand where science come from it
[31:27] didn't come from a laboratory
[31:29] it didn't come from man's thinking and
[31:32] man
[31:32] is so man is so incredible in his
[31:35] knowledge and abilities that
[31:37] uh he's he's uh you know still working
[31:40] on discovering what makes grass
[31:43] and so you know they can't do it in a
[31:46] lab right they can't take their own
[31:47] resources they have actually made grass
[31:49] grow in the lab
[31:51] but they had to go out and they had to
[31:53] take something from something else
[31:55] so when they have created their own
[31:57] substance to build from
[31:59] then we will totally trust science but
[32:02] um you know i just think about that you
[32:04] talk about being right on time if your
[32:06] name was jonah this morning
[32:08] you would be thanking god for that whale
[32:11] amen and that
[32:12] it would be right on time for you let's
[32:14] just stand and and just go right into
[32:16] genesis gonna start off here with laying
[32:20] a little foundation
[32:21] uh and um you know this takes us back
[32:24] you might say to the roots
[32:26] and we understand you know that the
[32:29] devil
[32:30] certainly he acts like everyone's friend
[32:32] but i've been quite fond for years of
[32:34] that saying you know that the devil's
[32:36] the one who talked you into robbing the
[32:38] bank and then he's also the one
[32:41] who called 911. and so
[32:44] you know it's it's uh just kind of this
[32:47] this
[32:47] uh relationship we see that as the
[32:50] scripture says he come to kill steal and
[32:52] destroy
[32:54] genesis the third chapter starting with
[32:55] the eighth verse
[32:57] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[33:01] walking in the garden in the pool of the
[33:04] day
[33:04] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[33:07] from the presence of the lord god
[33:09] amongst the trees of the garden and the
[33:12] lord god
[33:13] called unto adam and said unto him where
[33:17] art thou and he said i heard thy voice
[33:20] in the garden
[33:21] and i was afraid because i was naked
[33:25] and i hid myself now my brother and
[33:27] sister i want you just a little comment
[33:29] before we move on right here
[33:31] you see god knew exactly what happened
[33:36] to adam and eve but he never
[33:39] quit calling isn't that beautiful he
[33:42] knows what's happened in our lives and
[33:44] he's just never quit calling and we're
[33:46] in the house of god today because god is
[33:49] talking to us he's communicating he's
[33:51] calling and
[33:52] and i thank the lord that that never
[33:55] ends
[33:55] amen heavenly father lord we come this
[33:58] morning
[33:59] lord it's by your grace and mercy father
[34:02] that we stand here today
[34:04] lord truly if we was to examine our life
[34:07] from the human perspective
[34:09] we would just see a series of mistakes
[34:11] and faults and failures and stumbles
[34:14] but father i'm so thankful today that we
[34:16] can look through this precious blood
[34:19] and lord we see men and women young
[34:22] people
[34:23] father the word of god says they never
[34:25] done it
[34:26] in the first place lord the word of god
[34:29] says that we're
[34:30] clean and white and holy and righteous
[34:32] in your sight and father
[34:34] lord we're not going to listen to the
[34:36] devil's perspective we're going to
[34:37] listen to you lord and
[34:39] just ask you to bless this time this
[34:41] service today
[34:42] this thought help us to express it lord
[34:45] in your precious name we pray
[34:47] amen you may be seated
[34:51] so i start with this scripture because
[34:53] i'm going to use as you might
[34:55] call it the antitype to start off with
[34:58] because this is really not our focus
[35:00] because really truly my brother and
[35:02] sister when a man or a woman
[35:04] uh realizes who they are in jesus christ
[35:08] uh you would say that from that point we
[35:10] have no past
[35:11] amen and so the devil's always trying to
[35:15] to uh open up or bring about what was
[35:17] the past and what happened in the past
[35:19] and
[35:20] we see there in the garden what's so
[35:22] clearly laid out in scripture
[35:24] how this great chasm was opened between
[35:27] god and man and
[35:28] and satan's intention was to uh put
[35:31] something there that was insurmountable
[35:34] that mankind would never never be able
[35:36] to get across would never be able to
[35:39] to uh um uh bridge that chasm
[35:43] and you know this has been a hindrance
[35:45] uh for mankind ever since
[35:47] it's there that there's always the sin
[35:50] question but
[35:51] i thank god that the word shows us so
[35:53] clearly how the sin question
[35:55] has been solved and it is no longer a
[35:57] question
[35:58] but has become a declaration or
[36:00] statement
[36:01] of redemption and uh we realize the
[36:04] whole
[36:04] bible the whole plan of god as it is
[36:06] unfolding
[36:07] is a plan of redemption and it is my
[36:10] brother and sister
[36:12] such a beautiful thought when you
[36:13] realize that it is the recovery it is
[36:16] the
[36:17] bringing back the returning of and it's
[36:20] there that
[36:20] we um only way that mankind cannot
[36:23] return back to the presence of god
[36:25] is that he himself is hindered
[36:28] to the place that he does not respond
[36:31] and so we know that wherever
[36:33] we would call out whenever we would call
[36:35] out the word of god says that he would
[36:37] answer our call
[36:39] amen but you know you look at this and
[36:41] and we can get focused and often times
[36:43] you know people just preach on
[36:45] uh being a sinner and you need to repent
[36:48] but
[36:48] what we really i feel like now don't
[36:50] take this in a hard and fast but
[36:52] i think really what we need to realize
[36:55] is yes we are sinners we need to repent
[36:58] we need to be baptized and be filled
[36:59] with the holy ghost
[37:01] but you have to have a vision beyond
[37:03] that and i think what really changes the
[37:05] heart of men and women
[37:07] children today is when they catch the
[37:09] vision of who they really are not what
[37:11] they have been
[37:12] and and so by catching that vision of
[37:14] who you really are
[37:16] uh repenting and giving your heart to
[37:18] god and moving forward
[37:19] is just a natural reaction to
[37:22] recognizing who you are amen so it's not
[37:26] that we have been so evil
[37:28] and therefore we are no good but it is
[37:31] that satan has thrown this
[37:32] chasm in our way and god says don't
[37:34] worry about it i'm building a bridge
[37:36] across the chasm
[37:37] and so what i need you to do is not look
[37:40] at the depth and width of the chasm but
[37:42] i need you to look
[37:43] at the bridge that i have built across
[37:45] it for you
[37:46] amen and so you know it's it's a such a
[37:49] beautiful thing but
[37:50] men can be hindered in that and and all
[37:53] they can see is i can't do that
[37:55] you know i have dealt you know is in
[37:57] ministry here for a few years now
[38:00] uh and you know you go and you see and
[38:03] you run into people and it breaks your
[38:05] heart because they're
[38:06] they're just saying you know i made so
[38:08] many mistakes i just can't live it
[38:10] that's right you can't
[38:11] but if you just simply would see who you
[38:13] are if you come to the place that you
[38:15] say you know what
[38:16] i saw in the word that i am a son of god
[38:19] then you just keep focused on that my
[38:21] brother and sister and watch god build
[38:22] the bridge
[38:24] hallelujah you know it's not the bridge
[38:26] it's not going to appear overnight
[38:28] it's going to be drilled down to the
[38:30] bedrock first and there's got to be a
[38:31] lot of things
[38:32] that are pushed out of the way a lot of
[38:34] things that are taken away
[38:36] before the bridge can be built but in
[38:38] the whole process i want you to catch
[38:40] this
[38:40] in the whole process the bridge is being
[38:43] built
[38:44] hallelujah and so the word said you know
[38:48] that something's going to change you
[38:49] know
[38:50] and i say that is a broad statement but
[38:52] is that not what you see
[38:53] in your bible when you read it it is
[38:55] talking about what judgment would be for
[38:57] those who have not repent
[38:59] repented not received the word but god
[39:01] is there
[39:02] showing us hey i said something's going
[39:04] to change
[39:08] amen well it won't be god's word that
[39:10] changes
[39:12] amen now we look at this my brother and
[39:15] sister as we'll look at this for just a
[39:17] moment of
[39:18] what something would change now now here
[39:20] we have
[39:21] in joel 2 28 and it shall come to pass
[39:25] afterwards that i will pour out my
[39:27] spirit upon all flesh
[39:28] and your sons and daughters shall
[39:30] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[39:32] and your young men shall see visions now
[39:35] my brother and sister the prophet of god
[39:36] clearly
[39:37] tied this to the end time it was
[39:39] applicable to israel
[39:41] at that time but it is clearly
[39:43] applicable to the day that we
[39:44] live in that god once again pouring his
[39:47] spirit out
[39:48] upon his people it's no longer just hey
[39:50] we're part of a message movement
[39:52] or we identify with this or we identify
[39:55] this my brother and sister
[39:56] he says that he will pour out his spirit
[40:00] now i say lord i'm here today to receive
[40:02] of your spirit
[40:03] i'm not here today just to say i went to
[40:06] church today
[40:07] but i'm here because i'm expecting
[40:09] something greater
[40:10] than i had yesterday amen and sometimes
[40:14] as
[40:14] uh the song jason sang there is a
[40:16] closing song to the song service
[40:19] my brother and sister sometimes it's
[40:20] hard to say lord
[40:22] thy will be done not my will because
[40:25] let's face it saints it's a very fine
[40:28] line you've heard me say this before
[40:30] very fine line between being stubborn
[40:33] and determined if we have a stubborn
[40:36] spirit we resist all things but if you
[40:40] have a determined spirit god can still
[40:42] stir
[40:43] steer you still turn you but you won't
[40:45] quit
[40:47] hallelujah we don't want to be quitters
[40:48] do we we want to be identified as
[40:52] solidly in the word of god in the will
[40:55] of god
[40:56] and in that we just press forward if it
[40:59] wasn't my brother and sister
[41:01] we would have quit because stubbornness
[41:05] will not get you to heaven
[41:12] well praise the lord
[41:16] now joel 2 28 is so
[41:19] profound of scripture in my opinion that
[41:22] we come along in acts 2 and 16
[41:25] and find that they want to directly
[41:28] quote that in other words they made
[41:31] foundational
[41:33] the words of the prophet joel
[41:37] brought it into the new testament new
[41:39] covenant
[41:40] said no no that's not just an old
[41:42] testament thing i'm going to bring it
[41:44] forward into the new testament
[41:46] because it applies to you and i and so
[41:49] it comes along and i don't need to read
[41:50] it
[41:51] you know but here it is testifying but
[41:53] this is that which was spoken by the
[41:55] prophet joel
[41:55] so bringing this over my brother and
[41:58] sister you'll find in the world when you
[42:00] and i don't want to use the word debate
[42:01] but when you have conversation with
[42:04] people they oftentimes say well no we're
[42:06] not living under the law any longer
[42:08] that's the old testament
[42:10] but they somehow forget that jesus said
[42:12] i didn't come to do away with the law
[42:16] i come oh imagine this now we've all
[42:19] used one
[42:20] i come to magnify it in other words i'm
[42:23] holding this now to the law
[42:25] and you're going to see the details of
[42:27] the law that they didn't even see in the
[42:30] old testament
[42:30] you're going to see the depth of what it
[42:33] was about
[42:34] that they never taught because we are
[42:36] under a new covenant
[42:37] and i'm making it real i'm going to
[42:39] place it and
[42:40] write it have you not seen the little
[42:42] picture of the grain of sand that
[42:44] suppose
[42:45] or rice i mean that they supposedly
[42:47] wrote several thousand words on
[42:50] have you seen that look it up on the
[42:52] internet mr
[42:53] not right now mr google will find that
[42:57] for you that
[42:58] supposedly some the japanese scholar and
[43:01] the way that their words are done
[43:02] has wrote all these words tons and tons
[43:05] of words
[43:06] on a grain of rice now my brother and
[43:08] sister if a man can write
[43:10] multitudes of words on a grain of rice
[43:12] what can god write on your heart
[43:15] he can write all of his word all of his
[43:18] will
[43:19] predestination eternity
[43:22] can be written on your heart amen oh
[43:25] hallelujah thank you lord
[43:27] and i imagine even that some of that
[43:29] might be written in bold you know how in
[43:31] the day we live in
[43:32] if you're texting i never knew this for
[43:34] the longest time i wonder what people
[43:35] thought of me
[43:36] i had no idea that when you put
[43:38] something in capital letters when you
[43:40] sent a text
[43:41] that you were supposedly yelling i've
[43:44] yelled at everybody
[43:46] and i still like to write it in bold
[43:48] text because i can see it
[43:53] but i imagine some of these things that
[43:54] god wrote on her heart is probably in
[43:56] bold text my brother and sister
[43:58] because he wants you to get it he
[44:00] doesn't want you to just gloss over this
[44:02] and he wants you to get it so he's going
[44:05] to write it in bold letters upon your
[44:08] heart i'm going to write these on the
[44:10] tables of your hearts
[44:12] hallelujah so we see this my brother and
[44:16] sister
[44:17] we'll look at these words real quick
[44:19] here of joel 2 28 and acts 2 and 16
[44:21] 17 and you'll realize i could bring
[44:24] ourselves to the idea and say you know
[44:25] what
[44:26] something's fixing to happen but i want
[44:29] to put it this way to you today my
[44:31] brother and sister
[44:32] i want you to see it like this it's not
[44:34] something's fixing to happen
[44:36] something's already happen the word has
[44:39] been spoken
[44:40] and the word will come to pass
[44:44] now i want to know can you identify
[44:46] yourself in the bible can you identify
[44:48] yourself in the word and say that's me
[44:49] he's talking about
[44:51] when he talks about those that will be
[44:52] filled with the spirit
[44:54] amen with their lambs trimmed and clear
[44:56] and when he talks about those that are
[44:58] ready
[44:58] behold the bridegroom cometh and they're
[45:00] not foolish uh who are they talking
[45:02] about is it someone else
[45:04] or is it us today hallelujah it's us
[45:07] my brother and sister that we take a
[45:08] hold of that word and realize when he
[45:10] wrote this
[45:11] he didn't just write it on this page but
[45:14] it resonates to you and i because it's
[45:16] written on our heart
[45:18] amen and it's the word in us saying amen
[45:21] to the word on the page
[45:22] and the word that's anointed by the
[45:24] spirit or heart is saying amen to it
[45:26] because it is one god doesn't have two
[45:29] messages scott doesn't have
[45:31] you know something for him and something
[45:33] for someone else's we'll touch in a
[45:35] minute
[45:35] god's got one word and that word is his
[45:38] identity
[45:39] and that word in you identifies you as
[45:42] him
[45:42] and him in you hallelujah you can't lose
[45:46] on something like that when you become
[45:48] identified completely in him hallelujah
[45:51] i've phrased it this way for many years
[45:53] and i will continue to phrase it this
[45:55] way
[45:56] the rapture my brother and sister is god
[45:59] calling his word home
[46:01] and when his word is in you and he calls
[46:04] his word home
[46:05] you'll go with it because we see clearly
[46:08] the prophet of god said you know it's
[46:10] those who identify in the word and can
[46:12] say amen
[46:13] and act upon it that's the believer
[46:18] not acknowledging that that appears to
[46:20] be true
[46:22] you see too many times and these are not
[46:24] even my own words i won't
[46:26] i won't enlighten you of where they come
[46:28] from but it's not even my own words but
[46:31] too many times we preach god as a
[46:33] historical god
[46:37] what about a real god said i'll be with
[46:41] you
[46:42] even in you did god come to church this
[46:45] morning
[46:46] well we have to say amen to that if we
[46:48] believe the scripture
[46:51] amen god came to church this morning
[46:55] thank you
[46:57] oh we're not looking for something to
[47:00] happen saints
[47:01] it's happening already
[47:05] now ephesians the third chapter
[47:09] this is really in a nutshell the plan of
[47:12] god
[47:13] it is broken down right here in in its
[47:15] utter simplicity if
[47:17] by revelation we can see this and that
[47:19] is
[47:20] what i'm cutting in here at verse nine
[47:24] but catch this to make all men see
[47:28] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[47:30] which from the beginning of the world
[47:32] hath been hid in god who created all
[47:36] things
[47:36] by jesus christ now to give clarity to
[47:39] this the prophet of god says whether
[47:41] you're talking about god
[47:43] jesus christ the lord elohim
[47:46] it's all god amen so people get confused
[47:50] even around the message i've run into
[47:52] them
[47:52] that they're they're they're trying to
[47:54] segregate this it's like
[47:56] well you know god's on the throne but
[47:57] i've got the holy spirit in my heart no
[47:59] if you've got the holy spirit my brother
[48:01] and sister you've got god himself
[48:03] amen so you look how this comes down
[48:06] it created all things by jesus christ
[48:08] what is
[48:09] god's name on earth jesus christ
[48:13] amen that's how he chose to be
[48:14] identified to the intent
[48:16] that now and to principalities and
[48:18] powers in heavenly places
[48:20] might be known by the church so what's
[48:23] he doing he's making the church
[48:26] to know amen
[48:29] you know what that's called revelation
[48:34] it's also called relationship
[48:37] i won't go into that my brother and
[48:38] sister but you'll find through the ages
[48:40] and even in the courts of our land right
[48:42] now
[48:42] that if a marriage is not consummated
[48:44] it's not considered a marriage because a
[48:46] man must know his wife
[48:48] and the wife must know the husband so
[48:51] you see there's a deeper depth to this
[48:54] so a deep relationship
[48:57] of the principalities and powers in
[48:59] heavenly places
[49:00] might be known by the church see the
[49:02] church is not sitting here
[49:04] in a superficial relationship she's
[49:07] getting a very
[49:08] deep deep deep deep
[49:11] deep relationship it was brought up here
[49:15] talking about esther coming before her
[49:17] husband
[49:18] my brother and sister you know i
[49:20] remember
[49:21] years ago i become enthralled with that
[49:23] story but when it became
[49:25] real to me that it wasn't a king she was
[49:28] coming before
[49:29] she was coming before a husband
[49:32] the relationship by which she dressed
[49:34] herself up
[49:35] and went and stood in the fourier of the
[49:39] king's
[49:39] court was not a queen coming to a king
[49:42] it was a wife coming to a husband
[49:46] oh hallelujah and it was in that
[49:49] that he responded to her
[49:53] not because she was queen he had a queen
[49:56] called vasti
[49:57] if he wanted a wife that was indifferent
[49:59] rebellious and stubborn
[50:01] he would have just kept vashti he was
[50:03] looking for a wife
[50:05] that loved him as much as he loved her
[50:08] and was willing to go above and beyond
[50:11] to express that love
[50:12] and a confidence in the relationship
[50:14] that was there
[50:16] oh hallelujah hallelujah might be known
[50:20] by the church manifold wisdom of god
[50:22] according to the eternal purpose which
[50:24] he purposed in christ
[50:26] jesus our lord in whom
[50:30] we have a boldness amen now this is the
[50:34] same word my brother and sister
[50:36] in a different form you might say that
[50:38] esther lived by
[50:40] in whom we have boldness and access with
[50:42] confidence
[50:43] by the faith of him you realize that
[50:45] that is esther in a nutshell right here
[50:47] isn't not that's right
[50:48] hallelujah she was a type of this bride
[50:51] and we
[50:51] are the bride hallelujah so what she was
[50:55] a type of
[50:56] what she give a pre-figure of we are
[50:59] living out
[51:01] hallelujah amen
[51:04] wherefore i desire that you think not at
[51:07] my
[51:07] tribulations for you which is your glory
[51:15] which is your glory amen
[51:21] come on saints god's glorifying the
[51:24] bride
[51:25] he's not just leaving you here you got
[51:27] some preaching go to church
[51:29] go home live life dress like this talk
[51:31] like this
[51:32] do this do that no god is glorifying
[51:36] a bride right here on the earth today
[51:39] now the world my brother and sister
[51:40] they look at you and say they're weird
[51:42] they're odd they're different
[51:44] our church is this look how little they
[51:46] are look how great we are
[51:47] my brother and sister's got nothing to
[51:49] do with it god's not marrying a polluted
[51:51] bride
[51:52] god's marrying a pure bride he's
[51:54] marrying a bride that looks to him and
[51:56] says
[51:57] all we want to do is please our husband
[52:00] have you noticed in the world we live in
[52:02] today that's a very difficult
[52:04] spirit for people to grasp
[52:07] right hallelujah
[52:14] where was it
[52:20] now look what we have inserted right
[52:21] here
[52:23] i have no idea where this come from
[52:29] but it fits perfect i don't know is this
[52:33] a typo
[52:36] i'm serious my notes don't say it maybe
[52:37] i wrote it on the paper
[52:39] maybe brother alex added it but
[52:42] regardless
[52:43] i'm looking at that right there
[52:47] prayer for spiritual strength that's
[52:50] what we need today my brother and sister
[52:53] not not to come and and just be physical
[52:55] oh you know
[52:56] what are we going to do in this age but
[52:58] you see it'll be the spiritual that
[52:59] takes you through the age because the
[53:01] flesh is weak
[53:02] but the spirit is willing the spirit is
[53:05] powerful
[53:07] and god's going to come down and discern
[53:09] and divide and clean and cut away
[53:12] everything that is not in the day that
[53:14] we live in
[53:15] now look at this now for this cause
[53:19] i bow my knees into the father of our
[53:20] lord jesus christ of whom the whole
[53:22] family in heaven
[53:24] and earth is named so what is it we've
[53:26] said it for years but just let me
[53:28] remind you your name is not message
[53:30] believer
[53:31] your name is mrs jesus christ
[53:35] and when you catch that revelation that
[53:37] he's not coming for
[53:39] church goers or message people
[53:42] he's coming for a wife after his own
[53:45] name amen so what is this she's got to
[53:48] be willing to take his name
[53:51] to be identified in him
[53:56] some people find that hard to swallow
[54:00] in india very strong spirit they want to
[54:03] identify themselves as a bride as mrs
[54:06] william branham but the prophet of god
[54:09] said there's only
[54:10] one mrs william branham and she's the
[54:12] one that goes home with me
[54:14] at night so you see how deceptive that
[54:17] spirit is
[54:18] they try to twist the identity by which
[54:21] we come
[54:21] and place it all on the prophet to the
[54:24] age when the word of god
[54:26] says that our identity is in
[54:29] jesus christ and that is the name that
[54:32] we will bear
[54:34] not another that's right the scripture
[54:37] also tells
[54:38] us that he is jealous and will have no
[54:40] others before him
[54:42] no no don't go blaming the prophet my
[54:44] brother and sister it's man's ideas
[54:47] that does this hallelujah
[54:53] a whole family in heaven and earth is
[54:56] named
[54:57] now look as we move on i want to just
[54:59] keep going that he would grant you
[55:02] according to the riches of his glory to
[55:04] be strengthened with might
[55:05] by his spirit in the inner man now when
[55:08] you look at that being
[55:11] strengthened by might or with might
[55:14] by his spirit in the inner man my
[55:17] brother and sister i want to just ask
[55:18] you a question this morning do you ever
[55:20] feel weary
[55:22] you ever feel a little blue i hope you
[55:25] don't mind brother sergey but i'm just
[55:27] going to share it he sent me a text an
[55:29] encouraging text this morning
[55:31] and i was sitting in the office in the
[55:33] early hours
[55:34] and i was feeling a little blue
[55:38] my phone goes ding and i read this
[55:41] and i'm like thank you lord brought me
[55:44] to tears actually thank you lord
[55:46] i needed that encouragement
[55:50] oh i know i know it's just not very
[55:52] manly
[55:55] i don't really care what man thinks any
[55:57] longer that's right hallelujah
[56:00] what i want is what god thinks what god
[56:02] wants it to be
[56:03] amen hallelujah
[56:10] in whom we have boldness
[56:14] in whom we have boldness the christ may
[56:17] dwell
[56:18] in your hearts by faith that ye being
[56:20] rooted and grounded
[56:21] in love it doesn't even say being rooted
[56:23] and grounded in the message
[56:27] rooted and grounded in love you see if
[56:29] we can't have the spirit of love my
[56:31] brother and sister
[56:31] it won't matter how much you quote this
[56:34] bible or quote this message
[56:36] if you have no love in your heart amen
[56:39] so you'll find that the closer you get
[56:41] to god
[56:42] brother branham says this the closer you
[56:43] get to god the humbler you become
[56:50] somebody suddenly realizes i'm not
[56:52] nearly as important
[56:54] as i thought i was right
[56:58] i tell you you don't know how important
[57:00] one little gear on a
[57:01] one tooth on a gear is until that tooth
[57:03] is missing
[57:07] and then it things don't move things
[57:10] don't work right they make a lot of
[57:11] grumbling noises a lot of rumbles and a
[57:13] lot of problems until it just simply
[57:15] falls apart
[57:16] every little tooth every brother every
[57:18] sister every young person
[57:20] everyone has a value intrinsic value to
[57:23] this gospel
[57:24] it's not just about keeping our kids
[57:26] from the world my brother and sister
[57:27] it's not just about oh we got to keep
[57:29] seeing out of the everybody everybody
[57:31] but this is about you and i recognizing
[57:34] god called you and i
[57:36] to fulfill something he called us to a
[57:38] purpose and it's not just
[57:40] to to conform to this but to recognize
[57:43] our purpose in the gospel of jesus
[57:46] christ and when we recognize our purpose
[57:48] we no longer will grumble and growl
[57:51] and shake and shudder about fulfilling
[57:53] our part but we'll say thank you lord
[57:55] that you made me an integral part of
[57:57] your gospel you made me an integral part
[58:00] of the word to be manifested in laodicea
[58:02] the world out here needed to see me
[58:06] and
[58:11] but we're so caught up in well i've got
[58:13] problems i've got problems
[58:15] forget your problems forget looking at
[58:18] the size of the chasm
[58:19] god is building a bridge for you and he
[58:22] wants you to fulfill his word
[58:24] he wants you to walk across that bridge
[58:26] not defeated
[58:28] not your head bowed not struggling along
[58:31] but he wants you to walk across the
[58:33] bridge and say i
[58:34] am victorious in jesus christ hallelujah
[58:38] i've shared this with
[58:39] before i used to have the mentality when
[58:41] i struggled in my life
[58:43] lord if i could just crawl oh come on i
[58:46] don't want to embarrass you but
[58:48] i want to make it real to you i thought
[58:50] if
[58:51] i can just crawl across the threshold
[58:55] of heaven if i can just drag myself
[58:59] beyond the gates right
[59:03] and one day god spoke to me and said
[59:05] that's not what i called you to
[59:08] i called you to march into the gate
[59:11] victorious i called you to fulfill
[59:15] my word and not be there saying oh
[59:18] i'm not worthy i'm not worthy we know
[59:20] we're not worthy
[59:21] and the devil wants to make emphasis on
[59:23] that but for you to realize
[59:25] this is what god called me to i will do
[59:28] it with every fiber of my being
[59:30] i will press the mark of the high
[59:32] calling my brother and sister pressing
[59:35] is not crawling pressing is not
[59:37] staggering
[59:38] pressing is moving forward with strength
[59:42] and determination come on somebody say
[59:45] amen this morning
[59:46] it's time for the bride to recognize
[59:49] we're not a
[59:50] whimpering little bride
[59:54] can you imagine a young man young woman
[59:58] in the prime of life and a man marries a
[1:00:02] wife
[1:00:03] only to find out he's got a wife
[1:00:06] that snots and snivels oh i'm sorry i
[1:00:09] use such
[1:00:11] farm language snots and sniffles at
[1:00:15] every little thing
[1:00:17] oh honey i would fix you breakfast
[1:00:22] but it takes effort
[1:00:26] honey i would do your laundry i'm not
[1:00:27] picking on your sisters
[1:00:29] but i hope well anyway i won't go there
[1:00:33] i'd do your laundry but you realize
[1:00:38] i'd have to carry that basket into the
[1:00:40] machine and
[1:00:42] oh separate the laundry
[1:00:47] oh i would have cleaned the house
[1:00:51] but no sir what a man wants
[1:00:56] he's not a slave not a servant
[1:01:00] but a partner he's going to go out kill
[1:01:04] the brontosaurus
[1:01:05] drag it home he'd like to come home
[1:01:09] knowing that he's got a wife
[1:01:13] that has made that building with four
[1:01:14] walls into a home
[1:01:19] anybody can buy a house
[1:01:23] what we're looking for is a home
[1:01:26] now let me flip this to the spiritual
[1:01:28] side so many people
[1:01:29] say oh i want to make heaven my home
[1:01:33] as though it's dry and sterile
[1:01:37] and so it's just a destination we're
[1:01:39] going to
[1:01:41] what if we realize my brother and sister
[1:01:44] this house
[1:01:45] this temple this tabernacle god speaking
[1:01:48] about in so much of the word
[1:01:49] is us it's us god's not in the real
[1:01:53] estate business
[1:01:55] god's in the relationship business and
[1:01:58] he's wanting a wife
[1:02:00] that says i've cleaned the house i've
[1:02:01] made everything ready and i'm welcoming
[1:02:04] you i can come there now look i i tell
[1:02:06] you
[1:02:08] we preach and you know we can get
[1:02:10] slaughtered over these things
[1:02:12] so don't look at the critical side look
[1:02:14] at look at the point
[1:02:19] reminds me of a pastor once a couple
[1:02:22] verge of divorce in the message i know
[1:02:24] you guys think that's impossible but
[1:02:27] it's very possible
[1:02:31] this man this brother sits down with his
[1:02:33] pastor and says
[1:02:36] pastor we're done
[1:02:41] this pastor is like okay you're done
[1:02:44] i know that's not what you want to hear
[1:02:46] you want somebody to go oh no please
[1:02:48] don't do that and look bad for my
[1:02:49] ministry look bad for our church look
[1:02:51] bad for this and that what about the
[1:02:52] children and the cousins
[1:02:55] you're done remember we sing the song
[1:02:59] i got my mind made up and i won't turn
[1:03:03] back
[1:03:03] i'm gonna divorce that woman this week
[1:03:07] you'll never change that man's mind
[1:03:11] are you with me vice versa
[1:03:16] and he says i don't know what to do
[1:03:19] finally when the man's just exhausted
[1:03:20] himself the pastor says could i share a
[1:03:22] word or two
[1:03:23] yeah now i want you to remember this
[1:03:25] goes both ways saints
[1:03:28] there's no one-way streets in
[1:03:29] relationships
[1:03:32] and he says uh
[1:03:35] when's the last time you bought your
[1:03:36] wife chocolates
[1:03:41] now none of you look at sister jerry
[1:03:43] okay
[1:03:47] she uses my money to buy herself
[1:03:49] chocolates
[1:03:52] there's ain't no chocolates out there in
[1:03:53] the field where i'm at
[1:03:58] and he says i i don't and he says when's
[1:03:59] the last time you bought your wife
[1:04:01] flowers when's the last time you took it
[1:04:02] to dinner
[1:04:03] i haven't i don't
[1:04:08] well before you divorce her why don't
[1:04:09] you start give it a try
[1:04:13] now i want you to see my brother and
[1:04:14] sister the depth
[1:04:16] of despair that can be contained amongst
[1:04:19] people that say god sent a prophet
[1:04:24] that should be the fix all for us right
[1:04:27] no it's not i'm sorry to tell you
[1:04:31] he brings chocolates home comes in the
[1:04:34] door
[1:04:35] sets up on the kitchen counter which is
[1:04:38] full
[1:04:38] of unwashed dishes pots and pans it's
[1:04:42] just filthy
[1:04:44] and his wife looks at him what are you
[1:04:48] trying to do what's that for
[1:04:52] just thought i'd do that for you
[1:04:55] a couple days goes by comes flowers
[1:05:00] and this goes on for a period of time
[1:05:02] and finally one day she meets him at the
[1:05:04] door and she confronts him and says
[1:05:05] what's this all about
[1:05:06] what are you trying to do
[1:05:12] he said i'm trying to tell you i love
[1:05:14] you
[1:05:18] but he comes home the next day there's
[1:05:21] not a dirty dish on the counter
[1:05:24] there's not laundry piled up in the
[1:05:26] laundry room
[1:05:29] and i'll cut the story short comes back
[1:05:32] one day
[1:05:34] she meets him at the door and when he
[1:05:36] walks in the door
[1:05:38] she wraps her arms around him says i
[1:05:41] love you
[1:05:43] now my brother and sister do you realize
[1:05:45] that's also a perfect type
[1:05:46] of our relationship with christ
[1:05:50] god is not going to force you to do the
[1:05:52] laundry
[1:05:53] your laundry god's not going to force
[1:05:56] you to clean yourself up
[1:05:58] but he's constantly letting you know i
[1:06:01] love you
[1:06:02] i love you i love you i love you
[1:06:06] and this bride of christ in this day
[1:06:08] that we're living in right now

[1:06:15] you

[1:06:18] give you quotes if you want them

[1:06:26] wants this is a a
[1:06:27] a a redeemed people that have a voice
[1:06:31] and they're going to tell
[1:06:32] god that they love him that they care
[1:06:34] for him give praise to him

[1:09:21] hope you're with me on those thoughts
[1:09:23] this morning
[1:09:23] hallelujah now look at this excuse me
[1:09:26] for
[1:09:27] for just getting a little excited this
[1:09:29] has been something that that i've been
[1:09:30] just uh chewing on for for way
[1:09:34] too long here amen now look here
[1:09:37] brother branham now this is also in the
[1:09:40] message
[1:09:40] what the holy ghost was given for what
[1:09:42] was the holy ghost given for
[1:09:45] the church has been in the world for
[1:09:46] some time and the church really
[1:09:49] after the reformation of 1500 years of
[1:09:51] dark ages
[1:09:52] luther was the first reformer to come
[1:09:54] forth after the round of the apostles
[1:09:56] and then when luther come forth god
[1:09:59] tipped up a little bit of the spirit
[1:10:01] and poured it out upon the church in
[1:10:03] justification
[1:10:04] now almost i almost and then i thought
[1:10:06] this is too silly and then i realized
[1:10:08] i'm silly anyway so i should have just
[1:10:09] done it but my brother and sister i
[1:10:11] meant today to put the little table out
[1:10:13] here
[1:10:14] and put an empty container and a full
[1:10:16] picture beside it
[1:10:17] and just give you a very visual of him
[1:10:20] pouring
[1:10:21] a little bit out in justification
[1:10:25] now my brother and sister the
[1:10:26] justification
[1:10:28] would that be enough to satisfy the age
[1:10:30] we're living in
[1:10:32] not at all he poured a little bit out
[1:10:35] but he comes along now and then in the
[1:10:37] days of wesley he poured out a little
[1:10:39] more of himself see this is not
[1:10:41] just something people get i don't
[1:10:43] understand that they get this idea the
[1:10:45] holy ghost is somehow detached from god
[1:10:47] it's a separate some kind of entity it's
[1:10:49] god himself my brother and sister that's
[1:10:51] being poured out
[1:10:53] hallelujah they poured out a little more
[1:10:55] of himself into sanctification
[1:10:58] okay here we got this now we're gonna
[1:11:00] just pour this picture
[1:11:01] and you know it's now maybe a third full
[1:11:08] and as the age has grown on to the end
[1:11:10] time god has been
[1:11:15] filling his church
[1:11:18] amen it's not just here's my message
[1:11:20] here's this here's that believe it leave
[1:11:22] it whatever
[1:11:23] god has chose you and he's been coming
[1:11:25] by the holy spirit
[1:11:26] and he's been pouring into your life now
[1:11:28] our seasons are not all the same
[1:11:32] amen so you can't judge the whole body
[1:11:34] of believers
[1:11:35] this is a problem the unbelievers or
[1:11:37] people out here on the fence or having
[1:11:39] my brother and sister
[1:11:40] they're looking around and they're
[1:11:42] judging this whole body of believers
[1:11:44] by their relationship with god and
[1:11:46] saying there's nothing to the message
[1:11:48] nothing to the message
[1:11:49] i'm telling you they need to just go
[1:11:51] find somebody else and look at that life
[1:11:53] and realize god is pouring out
[1:11:55] and he's filling up a bride with himself
[1:11:58] hallelujah and as he fills this bride up
[1:12:00] just look around
[1:12:02] and find out if that's truth or not and
[1:12:05] so we look at this my brother and sister
[1:12:07] just you've got to be open but if we put
[1:12:09] cellophane
[1:12:12] or we put a lid on the picture pretty
[1:12:15] hard to pour into it isn't there
[1:12:19] now this might sound a little direct but
[1:12:21] i literally in the last couple years had
[1:12:22] somebody look me in the face
[1:12:25] and say we have heard enough of the
[1:12:27] message
[1:12:29] we don't need to hear anymore
[1:12:33] it ain't no wonder they're in the
[1:12:34] condition they're in that's right
[1:12:38] they're looking at the message as though
[1:12:40] it's a encyclopedia
[1:12:43] and of course i know all of you have
[1:12:44] read your dictionary recently
[1:12:49] come on saints all we got to do is stop
[1:12:52] and look around
[1:12:53] and find out if it's truth or not
[1:12:58] brother bob sister joanne is it truth
[1:13:02] amen
[1:13:11] i tell you what like i told you i didn't
[1:13:14] realize what i was saying when i said
[1:13:16] this is a veteran role
[1:13:18] brother bob sister sue is it truth or
[1:13:19] not hallelujah
[1:13:21] right when the word says the keeping
[1:13:23] power amen
[1:13:25] i know we know that brother bob's sister
[1:13:27] sue brother bob cecilia
[1:13:28] joanne have never had troubles they're
[1:13:31] they're the really blessed ones life has
[1:13:33] always just been a cakewalk
[1:13:36] everything they've ever wanted to do
[1:13:37] just fell in their lap and
[1:13:39] they've never been tempted by this or
[1:13:41] tempted by that or had a struggle with
[1:13:43] that
[1:13:44] it's just all been glorious
[1:13:53] but he poured out his spirit on all
[1:13:56] flesh
[1:13:58] some received it and some rejected it
[1:14:01] but those that received it gave he the
[1:14:04] power
[1:14:05] to become sons and daughters of god oh
[1:14:08] lord
[1:14:10] lord i just poured out lord jesus we're
[1:14:12] here
[1:14:13] pour it out saints this is not just a
[1:14:16] game this is not just words to be spoken
[1:14:18] you yourself have got to literally say
[1:14:20] lord i'm taking the lid off my picture
[1:14:22] i'm taking the cellophane off my picture
[1:14:24] and i'm going to be ready lord for you
[1:14:26] to pour something into me i want to be
[1:14:28] filled up i'm not ready for a third of a
[1:14:31] picture
[1:14:32] a half a picture two-thirds of a picture
[1:14:34] lord i want to be full
[1:14:36] and i can tell you this morning as i was
[1:14:38] studying the message the prophet of god
[1:14:40] says that's part of the problem
[1:14:41] is people are not sincere enough they're
[1:14:44] not seeking they're not
[1:14:45] sighing they're not crying they're just
[1:14:47] saying oh we've got it we believe
[1:14:53] no wonder he'll have an indictment for
[1:14:54] this generation
[1:14:58] amen amen am i preaching too hard i hope
[1:15:01] not
[1:15:03] john in 8 and 31 he said then jesus said
[1:15:05] to those jews
[1:15:09] where's the quantifier which
[1:15:12] believed not those that were there and
[1:15:15] heard it
[1:15:16] not those that saw it happen not those
[1:15:19] who heard it second hand
[1:15:21] but those which believed
[1:15:26] those jews which believed on him if you
[1:15:28] continue in my word
[1:15:30] see another quantifier can't
[1:15:34] turn on you've got to continue
[1:15:38] that means you get up wait it might have
[1:15:40] been this morning
[1:15:42] i just love that joke i'm sorry you know
[1:15:45] i don't mean to insert it but i think
[1:15:47] a little bit of toned down humor would
[1:15:49] be good for us this morning
[1:15:51] you know the man's laying in bed with a
[1:15:53] pillow over his head and his wife saying
[1:15:55] honey get up
[1:15:56] get up come on go to church he's like i
[1:15:59] ain't going to church
[1:16:00] i don't want to go to church honey you
[1:16:01] got to get out of bed you got to go to
[1:16:03] church
[1:16:03] after this goes on for a few minutes
[1:16:05] finally the man says
[1:16:07] why give me one good reason why i should
[1:16:09] go to church
[1:16:11] because you're the pastor
[1:16:20] i know you all never never never have to
[1:16:23] fight yourself
[1:16:24] to get up and go to church you're all
[1:16:27] busting at the door
[1:16:29] up at 6 15 dressed
[1:16:32] just waiting
[1:16:36] no sir i'm not here to criticize those
[1:16:39] that struggle in a little late or
[1:16:40] anything like that don't misunderstand
[1:16:42] me
[1:16:42] but what is it there's a spirit like we
[1:16:45] have heavy feet
[1:16:47] i'll sleep in just 10 more minutes just
[1:16:50] 10 more minutes
[1:16:51] just 10 more minutes hallelujah those of
[1:16:55] you have that problem and how you fix
[1:16:56] that is really simple
[1:16:58] you put the alarm as far away from your
[1:17:02] bed
[1:17:03] as you can and you put it
[1:17:07] behind something so you can't throw your
[1:17:09] pillow at it
[1:17:11] you can't throw a book at it why is that
[1:17:14] spirit there
[1:17:16] saints come on can i be blunt with you
[1:17:19] today
[1:17:20] why is it sometimes it is so hard to
[1:17:23] find
[1:17:24] enthusiasm
[1:17:27] now i'm not picking on brother adam he's
[1:17:29] our resident hunter as we all know
[1:17:32] but this is held true i've watched this
[1:17:34] and witnessed this through the years
[1:17:35] hunting trips fishing trips vacations
[1:17:38] oh can't believe it we got a flight out
[1:17:40] of boise
[1:17:41] at 5 00 am we're up at 3.
[1:17:46] god church at 10 30 we're up at 10
[1:17:49] 15.
[1:17:52] why is that why is it
[1:17:56] it's the spirit of the age because if he
[1:17:59] can
[1:17:59] keep us from this my brother and sister
[1:18:02] every little detour every little
[1:18:05] hindrance
[1:18:06] to keep us from going in
[1:18:09] the words oh i know
[1:18:12] i'm gonna i'm probably skin and knuckle
[1:18:14] or whatever
[1:18:18] coming to church in the spirit isn't
[1:18:20] your wife reading to you out of the
[1:18:22] bible
[1:18:22] while you drive to church
[1:18:29] lord just bless the service bless the
[1:18:31] pastor today amen we're in church sit
[1:18:33] down
[1:18:37] and the world is all over us
[1:18:41] we haven't shed the spirit of laodicea
[1:18:44] it's all over us
[1:18:47] and then the pastor just certainly
[1:18:48] wasn't very inspired
[1:18:51] this sunday morning
[1:18:55] i'll tell you what for every sunday the
[1:18:57] pastor gets up and preaches that it
[1:18:58] wasn't inspired i'd like you to compare
[1:19:00] with honesty
[1:19:01] how many services you came and you
[1:19:04] weren't inspired
[1:19:13] praise the lord lord jesus is all the
[1:19:16] pastor's fault
[1:19:18] and i'm not saying that don't feel sorry
[1:19:20] for me i'm trying to prod you
[1:19:23] now look right here what what brother
[1:19:26] brown says
[1:19:27] this is actually previous to the quote
[1:19:31] of what the holy ghost was given for
[1:19:33] what was the holy ghost given for
[1:19:34] these are actually earlier but i read
[1:19:36] that in that order on purpose
[1:19:38] and that's the way god did followed his
[1:19:40] own laws god cannot follow
[1:19:42] give you one law to follow and him
[1:19:44] follow another
[1:19:45] no imagine that so god's got us right on
[1:19:48] the same page with him
[1:19:51] he follows his own laws then god in
[1:19:53] order to redeem the lost church the lost
[1:19:55] world the lost creation
[1:19:56] god who is infinite in spirit to redeem
[1:19:58] the lost human race god himself become
[1:20:01] kin folks
[1:20:02] i like that i like family most of the
[1:20:05] time
[1:20:07] a man a son that he created in the womb
[1:20:09] of mary then he made an ensign or a
[1:20:11] testimony
[1:20:12] outside the gate of jerusalem he was
[1:20:14] lifted up between the heavens and earth
[1:20:16] and died
[1:20:16] and redeemed everything and in bleeding
[1:20:19] he sanctified a church
[1:20:21] that he himself might live in come on
[1:20:24] this
[1:20:24] this is my brother and sister i'm going
[1:20:26] to take this in
[1:20:27] a very very very strict method
[1:20:30] god wants to live in the four walls of
[1:20:33] grace
[1:20:35] he doesn't want this sometimes saints if
[1:20:37] this fits you then
[1:20:38] receive it if it don't fit you don't
[1:20:40] worry about it but sometimes it bothers
[1:20:42] grieves me
[1:20:43] that we can have a moving of the holy
[1:20:44] spirit in this church and the doors be
[1:20:46] wide open and people
[1:20:47] laughing and joking and whatever and the
[1:20:49] very spirit of god
[1:20:51] that was right here moving on hearts is
[1:20:53] then evaporated because we
[1:20:55] we want to just walk through the
[1:20:57] sanctuary we want to do all of these
[1:20:58] things
[1:20:59] where's our reverence grace tabernacle
[1:21:01] i'll speak really hard to you this
[1:21:02] morning
[1:21:03] we're losing our reverence of this
[1:21:05] sanctuary
[1:21:07] this is a church god wants to live in
[1:21:10] four walls god wants to be honored in
[1:21:13] amen
[1:21:17] now i said that kind of harsh i don't
[1:21:19] mean it harsh but i believe it's the
[1:21:20] truth
[1:21:22] i believe it's the truth we're not here
[1:21:23] to laugh and joke in the sanctuary
[1:21:25] this is god's house amen
[1:21:28] god became kin folks a man a son that he
[1:21:31] created in the womb of mary
[1:21:32] made an insider a testimony outside the
[1:21:34] gates of jerusalem he was lifted up
[1:21:36] between the heavens and the earth and
[1:21:38] died
[1:21:38] and redeemed what did he redeem
[1:21:41] everything
[1:21:43] and in bleeding he sanctified a church
[1:21:45] that he himself might live in
[1:21:47] and fellowship and commune with that
[1:21:50] lost spot of fellowship
[1:21:51] from the garden of eden where god came
[1:21:53] down every evening
[1:21:57] church time come on saints we can have
[1:22:01] our own time
[1:22:02] to walk as it were in the garden with
[1:22:08] him
[1:22:11] well do we want to
[1:22:14] or are we going to just hide under the
[1:22:17] fern
[1:22:20] and say well i'm naked
[1:22:24] i'm blind i'm this
[1:22:27] i'm that come on
[1:22:31] come out from underneath the fern come
[1:22:33] out and face it up lord i got something
[1:22:35] in my life if you have something in your
[1:22:37] life this morning
[1:22:38] and i'll just put it this way i
[1:22:39] personally feel like every one of us
[1:22:40] sometimes harbors some little something
[1:22:42] in our life that we need to just get rid
[1:22:44] of it might be frustrations at family
[1:22:47] members wife
[1:22:48] children it might be a little something
[1:22:50] that we just need to let go of i
[1:22:52] personally think that's why the prophet
[1:22:53] of god said
[1:22:54] repent every day don't let the sun set
[1:22:56] on your wrath just repent
[1:22:58] get those things settled up don't let
[1:23:00] them build up
[1:23:01] amen that's why the garbage man comes to
[1:23:03] your house once a week
[1:23:04] and takes the trash away that we don't
[1:23:06] end up with the alley full and the
[1:23:08] garage full in the driveway full
[1:23:10] right get rid of it wash it away let it
[1:23:13] go
[1:23:14] amen he sanctified a church that he
[1:23:16] himself might live in
[1:23:18] and fellowship and commune with that
[1:23:20] lost spot of fellowship
[1:23:21] from the garden of eden where god came
[1:23:23] down every
[1:23:25] is that what it says every evening
[1:23:30] did you notice god come down in the cool
[1:23:32] of the day in the setting
[1:23:34] of the sun now there's something about
[1:23:36] this
[1:23:37] just struck my heart this morning i sat
[1:23:38] there in tears there's something about
[1:23:40] when it starts to get night
[1:23:42] people think of church and of god
[1:23:45] christians
[1:23:46] you see the sun setting you realize your
[1:23:50] sun
[1:23:51] is setting
[1:23:54] i told sister jerry here a day or two
[1:23:56] ago
[1:23:58] how did we how did we get here
[1:24:04] how did we
[1:24:08] look at this face

[1:24:15] well i don't know who who that brother
[1:24:17] was but he's the skinny brother over
[1:24:19] there with the
[1:24:20] wrinkly face
[1:24:25] where of the year is gone
[1:24:31] you know we can serve god just as good
[1:24:33] today

[1:24:57] to stand before the lord one day
[1:24:59] brother branham says you're going to
[1:25:00] answer paul i know you didn't find that
[1:25:02] quote but i did
[1:25:03] you're going to answer paul for every
[1:25:05] single thing you say
[1:25:07] and i want you guys to be aware my
[1:25:09] brother and sister the time to play is
[1:25:11] over the time for games is over the time
[1:25:13] to just
[1:25:14] come to church and just be able to say
[1:25:16] god sent a prophet that's all over god's
[1:25:18] looking for a relationship
[1:25:19] god's looking for a people that want to
[1:25:21] move into his house
[1:25:23] hallelujah because he's there
[1:25:26] knocking on the door to move in to our
[1:25:28] house
[1:25:31] you know reminds me it didn't end well
[1:25:33] for this couple
[1:25:35] but in the message quite a few years ago
[1:25:37] as young men
[1:25:39] i believe in the beginning they were
[1:25:40] truly in love
[1:25:42] mary's a bride marries a wife
[1:25:45] then he goes out of state goes a couple
[1:25:47] thousand miles away
[1:25:49] and works for eight nine ten months at a
[1:25:52] stretch
[1:25:54] and then when it didn't work out and
[1:25:55] their marriage fell apart
[1:25:57] neither one could figure out what went
[1:26:00] wrong
[1:26:04] seems silly doesn't it i'm sorry
[1:26:08] some people say i'm dependent
[1:26:15] and i am i
[1:26:18] am dependent yes sir brother jason's
[1:26:22] lifting a hand some of you can go ahead
[1:26:23] and lift your hand that's right
[1:26:25] i'm dependent god gave me a godly wife
[1:26:29] who is not only a good cook
[1:26:33] that is actually fairly high on the list
[1:26:35] believe it or not for most
[1:26:36] men
[1:26:39] okay i'm sorry i shouldn't make fun of
[1:26:42] this
[1:26:43] we're dependent on god we can't live
[1:26:46] without him i don't want to see him
[1:26:48] every six eight ten months
[1:26:50] i don't wanna see him once a year i
[1:26:52] don't
[1:26:53] i wanna see him every day i wanna i
[1:26:56] wanna be in his presence every day i
[1:26:57] wanna be
[1:26:58] fed every day i wanna be comforted every
[1:27:02] day
[1:27:05] imagine what adam and eve felt like in
[1:27:08] the garden they knew they had sinned
[1:27:09] they knew they transgressed the word of
[1:27:11] god and
[1:27:12] and now they're walking through the
[1:27:13] garden and they're they're hiding
[1:27:15] there's no open fellowship we'll get to
[1:27:17] that if i can just hurry
[1:27:19] along
[1:27:25] and he lost that fellowship because sin
[1:27:27] would not let him do it
[1:27:29] oh in the cool of you come down and
[1:27:31] commune with them and there he lost that
[1:27:33] fellowship because sin would not let him
[1:27:35] do it
[1:27:35] and then he was made flesh and dwelt
[1:27:37] among us in order that he could come
[1:27:38] back again to man
[1:27:39] live in man restore man to a state of
[1:27:42] communion with him
[1:27:43] again and give him back his god-given
[1:27:46] right
[1:27:47] what was that god-given right communion
[1:27:50] fellowship with god in the cool of the
[1:27:53] evening
[1:27:54] come on i'm going to just take what the
[1:27:56] prophet of god's word said
[1:27:58] communion in the cool of the evening
[1:28:01] church are you with me saints
[1:28:09] i'm not chiding you i want to just bring
[1:28:11] you aware
[1:28:14] if we come into church
[1:28:18] and there's no presence of god
[1:28:21] there's something that has kept him
[1:28:25] from coming down and communing with us
[1:28:31] what might that be
[1:28:36] i've already picked on you enough i
[1:28:37] won't even go that direction
[1:28:42] give him back his god-given right what
[1:28:44] is that to dwell in the presence of god
[1:28:46] that's what he did that's the purpose of
[1:28:48] the holy ghost
[1:28:48] it's the father again god the father
[1:28:52] dwelling in you
[1:28:56] working out his plans to finish his plan
[1:29:01] of redemption working through you
[1:29:04] amen making you remember i told you the
[1:29:06] other day the word of god is not
[1:29:07] self-fulfilling
[1:29:09] i told you i had a quote for that word
[1:29:11] of god is not self-fulfilling
[1:29:13] prophecy is not self-fulfilling right
[1:29:15] here
[1:29:16] this is what supports what i was saying
[1:29:19] dwelling in you working out his plans to
[1:29:21] finish his plan of redemption working
[1:29:23] through you
[1:29:24] making you a co-worker
[1:29:28] not god coming down and saying okay
[1:29:30] you're going to be saved you're going to
[1:29:31] have the holy ghost
[1:29:32] you're going to live right you're going
[1:29:33] to do this you're going to do that no

[1:30:00] sister
[1:30:01] we get to the place that we look out for
[1:30:03] believers really well but we don't look
[1:30:05] out for much of anybody
[1:30:06] else we're not worried about the person
[1:30:08] on the street we're not worried about
[1:30:09] that
[1:30:09] i'll tell you what happened here the
[1:30:11] other day and i felt very checked in my
[1:30:12] heart
[1:30:13] and brother isaac did at the same time
[1:30:15] we're here in the church doing some
[1:30:16] stuff
[1:30:17] and this man you know normally we'd lock
[1:30:20] the door but we didn't and this man
[1:30:22] comes stumbling in
[1:30:23] and he's talking about how he's in the
[1:30:24] homeless shelter in boise
[1:30:26] and he's missed his bus and now he's
[1:30:28] going to lose his bed
[1:30:29] and i need you you have to he's talking
[1:30:31] to me you have to drive me to boise so i
[1:30:33] don't lose my bed and i'm like
[1:30:34] i'm here working i was a little annoyed
[1:30:37] i hate to admit this but i believe it's
[1:30:38] good we do
[1:30:39] i was a little annoyed it's like look
[1:30:40] i'm here working i'm not here to drive
[1:30:42] you to boise because you
[1:30:44] can't get on a bus on time
[1:30:47] and then the man was there for the
[1:30:48] longest time even talked to the homeless
[1:30:50] shelter and they said well we'll save
[1:30:51] his bed if he can get here
[1:30:53] uh if some assurance of getting here and
[1:30:55] i said well it don't look like he'll get
[1:30:57] there and he said well
[1:30:58] could you drive him to the salvation
[1:31:00] army uh they have a few open beds he
[1:31:02] could stay there the night we'll save
[1:31:03] his bed for him
[1:31:04] doing this and doing that and and i was
[1:31:06] like okay well that's probably what
[1:31:07] we'll do we'll just drive them over
[1:31:08] salvation army and and they can you know
[1:31:10] get a bus tomorrow and
[1:31:12] whatever then i just felt a presence
[1:31:23] what if this was jesus christ
[1:31:29] i'm not caring about this man's plight
[1:31:37] god help us god help us
[1:31:42] can we get so callous and so caught up
[1:31:44] in our life that we can look at this and
[1:31:47] forget why we're here
[1:31:51] the man in the meantime was discouraged
[1:31:56] walked off then we're like you know what
[1:31:59] we're going to find a compromise on this
[1:32:02] when isaac called an uber
[1:32:05] i went and found the man almost up to
[1:32:07] the boulevard got him to get in the car
[1:32:09] brought him back we waited for an uber
[1:32:13] and i took that time to sit on the seats
[1:32:15] in the foyer
[1:32:16] and ask him if he knew jesus christ the
[1:32:18] whole time repenting in my heart
[1:32:21] what if what if what if what if the lord
[1:32:25] sent
[1:32:29] a homeless man in our midst
[1:32:32] to see if we actually had any love
[1:32:36] for those that are lost
[1:32:39] i hate to admit this to you in the first
[1:32:42] half
[1:32:43] of that narrative i failed miserably
[1:32:46] but i thank god that he just nudges us
[1:32:48] and nudges us and
[1:32:50] is there lord
[1:32:53] i told the gentleman i said sir i'm
[1:32:55] sorry
[1:32:56] sorry and he was there i don't know
[1:33:01] i could be honest and say i think he was
[1:33:03] a little mentally
[1:33:04] uh cognitively impaired
[1:33:08] gentlemen but what's that got to do with
[1:33:11] me
[1:33:12] what's it got to do with you have we
[1:33:13] lost saints have we lost
[1:33:16] our care for those around us in this
[1:33:20] world
[1:33:22] now we have to use wisdom
[1:33:25] tell you about a time in phoenix that a
[1:33:27] man come and i
[1:33:29] i thought he was sincere and i gave him
[1:33:30] money and literally
[1:33:32] five minutes later he's over there some
[1:33:34] man we never even saw in the dark buying
[1:33:36] drugs off of him
[1:33:39] but i told the man whatever you do it's
[1:33:41] up to you now
[1:33:43] you want to lie to me use it for
[1:33:45] something else that's fine but
[1:33:47] don't let those kind of things stop you
[1:33:49] from
[1:33:50] losing your care for the lost your
[1:33:53] heart's desire to the lost
[1:33:55] our visitor today sat for just a few
[1:33:57] minutes and
[1:33:58] chose to leave it's okay
[1:34:01] we can't we can't change to make it fit
[1:34:04] somebody
[1:34:06] but we can be real of who we are in
[1:34:09] jesus christ
[1:34:10] he's alive he's well now look at this
[1:34:13] there's not enough spirit touching it to
[1:34:16] go to the souls
[1:34:17] oh let me go back up when it strikes in
[1:34:19] their heart
[1:34:22] let me back up way further let's just go
[1:34:23] to the top i'm lost here
[1:34:26] adam adam where art thou that's what the
[1:34:28] holy spirit does to a man or woman
[1:34:30] when it strikes in their heart and takes
[1:34:31] its abode there's a thirst and hungering
[1:34:33] for lost souls that's what's the matter
[1:34:36] with the meetings today
[1:34:37] there's not enough spirit touch in it to
[1:34:40] go for the souls of the lost and the
[1:34:42] dying it's more to make a name
[1:34:44] or a church or a building or a
[1:34:45] denomination instead of a soul-winning
[1:34:48] program
[1:34:48] yeah how pitiful we could stay on it
[1:34:51] much
[1:34:52] god poured himself into christ correct
[1:34:54] christ poured himself into the church
[1:34:56] therefore now watch at that day you will
[1:34:58] know that i
[1:34:58] am the father and you are in me and i am
[1:35:00] in you
[1:35:02] hallelujah

[1:35:17] here we're gonna
[1:35:19] you're gonna get beyond the here and now
[1:35:20] and you got to think about eternity
[1:35:23] we got to get to the place that what we
[1:35:24] think about what we focus on
[1:35:26] is not here and now but it's on eternal
[1:35:29] things
[1:35:31] amen have i skinned you enough you ready
[1:35:33] to quit
[1:35:45] and that day you'll know it first the
[1:35:46] whole thing is one plan of redemption
[1:35:48] coming down that god coming
[1:35:50] back to live in dwell with
[1:35:54] and commune to his people
[1:35:57] now i want to tell you my brother and
[1:35:59] sister he doesn't just want to be in
[1:36:01] your house
[1:36:03] he wants to be in you and he doesn't
[1:36:06] just want to be in your house
[1:36:08] now i know none of you married folks but
[1:36:10] unfortunately jerry and i have
[1:36:12] experienced this
[1:36:12] i'll just make it easy for the rest of
[1:36:14] you you don't have to say amen
[1:36:19] get a little miffed your wife or your
[1:36:21] husband or your children
[1:36:23] or your parents
[1:36:28] and we give them the cold shoulder
[1:36:30] they're in the house with you
[1:36:33] but you don't talk to them
[1:36:40] amen amen
[1:36:44] amen amen amen
[1:36:49] cold shoulder here and a cold shoulder
[1:36:52] there
[1:36:53] and i am justified
[1:36:57] i am justifying
[1:37:00] i'm right there wrong i'm right there
[1:37:04] wrong
[1:37:04] i will give them a cold shoulder
[1:37:10] you don't want the second verse
[1:37:19] we've got
[1:37:22] picture jesus christ on the wall
[1:37:27] we've got a picture of the cross or a
[1:37:30] cross
[1:37:32] we've got a picture of brother branham
[1:37:37] and we've got a cold heart and a cold
[1:37:41] shoulder
[1:37:43] if you put confidence in those pictures
[1:37:48] you're an idolater god's not on your
[1:37:51] wall
[1:37:52] he's in your heart amen the cross is not
[1:37:56] on the wall
[1:37:57] it's in your heart and the words of a
[1:37:59] prophet for this generation
[1:38:01] are not on your wall they're in your
[1:38:03] heart
[1:38:05] so we can come to the place saints that
[1:38:08] we will be there
[1:38:09] and so we have to come back god coming
[1:38:12] back to live in
[1:38:14] dwell with and commune to his people as
[1:38:16] he did
[1:38:17] at the beginning imagine if god came
[1:38:20] so real and walked literally in the
[1:38:22] doors of our house
[1:38:24] would he have to say sorry brother adam
[1:38:27] adam adam where art thou paul
[1:38:31] paul where art thou chris chris
[1:38:34] where art thou j j where art thou
[1:38:42] come just saying just saying
[1:38:49] i like these this is what motivated this
[1:38:51] whole sermon right here
[1:38:53] now then as soon as he gets his church
[1:38:56] in speaking conditions
[1:39:00] you know what speaking conditions is you
[1:39:03] talking to him just as much as he's
[1:39:05] talking to you
[1:39:07] some people you know i've done this lord
[1:39:10] forgive me the people i've tortured
[1:39:11] through the years
[1:39:13] i remember not falten sister jerry but i
[1:39:15] can remember
[1:39:17] going home spending you know an evening
[1:39:20] dinner with someone and jerry going um
[1:39:22] paul i don't mean to be rude honey but
[1:39:24] do you realize that they couldn't even
[1:39:26] get a word in edgewise
[1:39:29] it's like me yeah you
[1:39:33] you see that wasn't a conversation
[1:39:37] conversation has to include someone
[1:39:40] speaking back so it's not
[1:39:44] all us lord now lord i need a better job
[1:39:46] i need a car i need a house i need this
[1:39:48] i need that i don't need to need my kids
[1:39:49] to do this i need my wife to do this i
[1:39:51] didn't need
[1:39:55] it's not a conversation
[1:40:00] and if god speaks and you never answer
[1:40:04] that's not a conversation
[1:40:08] are we all on the same page
[1:40:12] as soon as he gets oh i hope you see
[1:40:14] this this is very
[1:40:16] very important to the future of this
[1:40:17] this quote as soon as he gets his church
[1:40:20] in speaking tradition
[1:40:21] gets his church to a place that he can
[1:40:23] flow himself through
[1:40:25] love and persuade and fellowship
[1:40:29] then there will come an eden
[1:40:34] then we return back
[1:40:37] amen where we walk in the cool of the
[1:40:40] evening with our lord jesus
[1:40:42] and he'll take his church back to where
[1:40:44] it left him at back to an eden again
[1:40:47] near where it fell and now that's made
[1:40:49] its first start or fall
[1:40:50] there is where it will be taken right
[1:40:52] back with every clean slate of
[1:40:55] redemption
[1:40:55] bringing them straight back to that
[1:40:57] place again
[1:40:59] oh hallelujah just can i have a couple
[1:41:00] more minutes
[1:41:02] amen now look at this malachi 4.
[1:41:05] now if you feel free to just go ahead
[1:41:08] and voice it
[1:41:08] when someone says malachi 4 what do you
[1:41:11] think of
[1:41:13] that's right that's right brother bob
[1:41:17] why did we kick the other verses out
[1:41:23] why have we sidelined
[1:41:27] the other verses but we've done that we
[1:41:32] have
[1:41:32] done that my brother and sister we don't
[1:41:34] make any less emphasis
[1:41:37] of verses five and six but we're not
[1:41:40] giving emphasis
[1:41:41] to the others for behold the day cometh
[1:41:44] that shall burn as an oven has that
[1:41:45] taken
[1:41:46] place not physically on the earth yet
[1:41:51] all the proud yea and all that do
[1:41:54] wickedly
[1:41:54] shall be stubble so we're not quite here
[1:41:56] yet
[1:41:58] right now we understand that the word of
[1:42:00] god is not a chronological
[1:42:03] reading right so god lays a seed
[1:42:07] leaves that seed in the ground for a
[1:42:09] season other
[1:42:10] events take place while the seed is
[1:42:13] coming to
[1:42:14] pass right happens all the time on the
[1:42:16] farm that revelation is very real to me
[1:42:19] because we'll do things plant a seed and
[1:42:21] we might be spraying something over the
[1:42:23] top of that crop or we might be
[1:42:25] irrigating or we might be doing whatever
[1:42:27] fertilizing
[1:42:28] doing whatever but that didn't change
[1:42:30] the fact the seed's been planted
[1:42:34] all they do wickedly shall be stubble
[1:42:36] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[1:42:37] up saith the lord of hosts
[1:42:38] and shall leave them neither root nor
[1:42:40] branch
[1:42:43] i'll tell you what verse 2 actually
[1:42:44] means quite a bit to me
[1:42:46] now some of you might stumble if i say
[1:42:48] verse 2
[1:42:49] means as much to me as verses 5 and 6 do
[1:42:56] you following me oh i know some people
[1:42:58] said paul left the prophet behind
[1:43:01] no i'm sorry i'm following where he
[1:43:03] pointed me to
[1:43:05] he said there it is go but unto
[1:43:09] now who is this
[1:43:12] who is this hallelujah sister hit it
[1:43:15] right on the head
[1:43:16] the you there is me me as you

[1:43:25] righteousness arise with healing in his

[1:44:03] calf of the stall

[1:44:10] you if you feel that way this morning

[1:44:57] shall be ashes unto the souls of your
[1:45:00] feet

[1:45:02] the lord of hosts
[1:45:04] you know what's happening god's word
[1:45:08] four five and six god's word
[1:45:11] in you it's what's overcoming the world
[1:45:15] god is not leaving you as some little
[1:45:17] baby to follow along behind him while he
[1:45:20] fights this battle of the spirit of
[1:45:22] laodicea god said i will be with you
[1:45:25] even in you and you are going to come
[1:45:27] out here
[1:45:28] and tread down the wicked you amen not
[1:45:31] the prophet

[1:45:43] are going to tread
[1:45:44] that down you are going to be identified
[1:45:46] as the overcomer

[1:45:55] adam was in control until he
[1:45:58] relinquished it
[1:46:00] god help us we're not here today in
[1:46:02] control
[1:46:03] and then relinquishing it we can bind
[1:46:06] every spirit
[1:46:07] we can loose the holy spirit is this not
[1:46:09] the word of god
[1:46:10] have i ventured off the word into some
[1:46:12] man's ideas
[1:46:13] this is what the scripture says that you
[1:46:15] will do this
[1:46:16] you will fulfill the word you shall be
[1:46:19] the one filled with the spirit
[1:46:20] that will then bind and release and
[1:46:23] loose
[1:46:24] and whatever that you have loose will be
[1:46:26] loose and whatever you have bound will
[1:46:27] be bound
[1:46:28] it's not someone else we don't got to
[1:46:30] look back i'm sorry i don't mean this
[1:46:32] rude but we don't got to wait for a
[1:46:34] prophet to come back
[1:46:35] my brother and sister the word right
[1:46:37] here empowered you
[1:46:40] hallelujah and if you're waiting well

[1:46:44] you just might miss it because i'll tell
[1:46:47] you
[1:46:48] if you want to google it google it perry
[1:46:50] stone
[1:46:51] on youtube is standing right there
[1:46:56] line by line going through brother
[1:46:58] branham's prophecies
[1:47:00] saying could it be the fulfillment he's
[1:47:04] not he's not there as a critic he's not
[1:47:05] saying
[1:47:06] well this guy was this and this guy was
[1:47:07] that
[1:47:09] he wouldn't claim to be a message
[1:47:11] believer but he recognized his truth
[1:47:14] he's there does kamala harris
[1:47:18] fulfill this
[1:47:22] the first prophecy is fulfilled second
[1:47:23] one's fulfilled third one's fulfilled
[1:47:25] fourth one's fulfilled fifth one's
[1:47:26] fulfilled we have number six
[1:47:29] and he talks about kamala harris could
[1:47:31] she be
[1:47:33] that beautiful but cruel woman
[1:47:36] and then he brings up and what is the
[1:47:40] prophecy
[1:47:41] of i see america in smoldering
[1:47:48] ashes
[1:47:50] you know what the prophet also said when
[1:47:53] you see them
[1:47:55] coming for the oil
[1:47:59] we're right at hand we're right at hand
[1:48:03] they're not looking to someone else out
[1:48:06] here
[1:48:07] these people are increasingly looking
[1:48:10] to these prophecies and saying what does
[1:48:13] it mean
[1:48:14] where is it you know even voices that
[1:48:19] said in the past william branham
[1:48:20] was good until he got off at the end
[1:48:22] have quieted their voice
[1:48:24] saying we have seen unparalleled
[1:48:27] fulfillment
[1:48:29] of prophecy they can't explain it they
[1:48:32] don't see it
[1:48:32] they can't come back to malachi 4 5 and
[1:48:35] anchor their soul in that and say praise
[1:48:36] the lord
[1:48:37] i'm the one that the word that word my
[1:48:39] brother and sister now let's turn this
[1:48:41] around because god chose to do this
[1:48:43] and he he put verses four five and six
[1:48:46] together tied them together in this but
[1:48:49] look at this now my brother and sister
[1:48:51] you can turn this around because we
[1:48:53] would have not been
[1:48:54] a calf in the stall except for verse
[1:48:56] five
[1:48:59] come to pass we would not be enlightened
[1:49:04] to realize that we were called to bind
[1:49:07] the spirits of laodicea
[1:49:09] and tread them under our feet except for
[1:49:12] elijah the prophet come once again
[1:49:17] you see what happened while all of this
[1:49:18] was here the seed was watered
[1:49:21] and it come forth to fulfillment i'd
[1:49:24] almost invite you all to our young our
[1:49:26] grace kids today
[1:49:28] you know i told you church about how we
[1:49:30] gave the kids corn seed and put them in
[1:49:32] a little dish and
[1:49:34] different things have happened and we're
[1:49:35] not here to criticize any of the
[1:49:36] children that their corn seed isn't
[1:49:38] growing or it's gone or whatever
[1:49:41] but i've got another point that i'm
[1:49:42] going to make with the corn seed today
[1:49:44] you see my corn seed that i planted i
[1:49:46] don't know kids
[1:49:48] you still have your corn seed probably
[1:49:50] most would say no
[1:49:52] but mine's about that tall
[1:49:56] but i cheated because i had a point i
[1:49:59] wanted to make so i
[1:50:01] knew i had to make my point but i also
[1:50:03] got another point
[1:50:05] do you know i got two corn plants
[1:50:07] growing in this little dish
[1:50:11] and on purpose i never gave them room to
[1:50:13] grow
[1:50:14] now they're starting to lose their color
[1:50:17] their vigor they're starting to show
[1:50:20] evidence of
[1:50:21] lack of nitrogen lack of potash
[1:50:25] they need a little sulfur
[1:50:32] if you're in a dish today
[1:50:35] and you find yourself stalled out in
[1:50:37] your spiritual walk
[1:50:39] why don't you give yourself room to grow
[1:50:43] why don't you get out of your little pot
[1:50:46] this is how i see the message this is
[1:50:47] how i see myself this is how i see
[1:50:49] church this is how i see
[1:50:51] get out of that pot plant it somewhere
[1:50:54] because we're actually today give the
[1:50:56] kids young kids a
[1:50:58] little pre-figure today we're actually
[1:51:00] going to pop those plants
[1:51:01] out of that and they're going to see
[1:51:02] roots that instead of going down into
[1:51:04] deeper soil
[1:51:06] have turned back on themselves because
[1:51:09] they got nowhere to grow
[1:51:12] now it might sound like i'm anti-message
[1:51:13] this morning
[1:51:15] and i'm going to tell you i'm 150
[1:51:17] percent or 200 or 5 5000 whatever number
[1:51:19] you want to put to it
[1:51:20] sold out on this message
[1:51:23] but if you don't give god room to grow
[1:51:26] in you
[1:51:28] you're going to turn back on yourself
[1:51:31] and then ultimately you're going to run
[1:51:32] out
[1:51:34] as matthew declares
[1:51:37] some amongst the stones and some amongst
[1:51:40] the thistles
[1:51:44] some in good soil some
[1:51:47] sinking their roots down and saying that
[1:51:49] word of god right there that we've read
[1:51:51] today i've heard today
[1:51:53] i'm gonna fulfill that i'm the one
[1:51:55] that's gonna be ready and when the
[1:51:56] rapture comes i'm gonna be there
[1:51:58] giving praise to the lord and i'm gonna
[1:52:00] be saying this was for me
[1:52:02] hallelujah it might not be for you might
[1:52:04] not be for you but it was for me
[1:52:06] i'm fulfilling this word because god
[1:52:09] promised and a prophet brought the words
[1:52:11] gonna take me right back to eden
[1:52:14] hallelujah and i get a walk in the cool
[1:52:16] of the evening not just in a pre-figure
[1:52:18] but i'm going to walk in the cool of the
[1:52:20] evening with my lord jesus christ
[1:52:22] and he's going to talk to me oh no paul
[1:52:25] that's that's that's
[1:52:26] old days that's time gone by that no you
[1:52:29] know no no i'm sorry
[1:52:30] get rid of that catholic spirit get rid
[1:52:33] of that old denominational spirit
[1:52:35] that's turned it into a form but no
[1:52:36] godliness
[1:52:38] amon i want power my brother and sister
[1:52:41] amen
[1:52:42] so it's there i'll send you elijah the
[1:52:44] prophet why'd he send us
[1:52:46] a prophet come on let's get down to the
[1:52:48] rubber hits the road why did he send us
[1:52:50] a prophet
[1:52:51] the prophet's own words i don't have the
[1:52:52] quote right here was that he would tie
[1:52:54] up all the loose sins
[1:52:56] his own words my brother and sister he
[1:52:59] didn't say i myself will give you
[1:53:01] rapturing faith
[1:53:02] he said rapturing faith is on those
[1:53:04] tapes and what was on the tape preaching
[1:53:07] jesus christ
[1:53:09] there's where rapturing faith is that is
[1:53:11] in jesus christ
[1:53:13] hallelujah and he's going to turn the
[1:53:15] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:53:16] and the heart of the children to their
[1:53:18] fathers i want to ask you has it
[1:53:20] happened

[1:53:43] working on me
[1:53:46] he's pouring into his church into his
[1:53:49] people we're not gonna sing that song
[1:53:51] it's just he's pouring into his church
[1:53:55] show me one place he said he was going
[1:53:56] to stop

[1:54:06] on you know what
[1:54:08] i'll tell you what go to chili they live
[1:54:11] in a dusty dirty environment
[1:54:13] every sister that's got a pitcher of
[1:54:15] lemonade or juice or something
[1:54:17] they're real fond of putting cellophane
[1:54:19] over the top of it that's where this
[1:54:21] idea is rooted they put silicon keep the
[1:54:24] dust out
[1:54:27] but it also keeps everything else out
[1:54:30] it's kind of a funny story and this is
[1:54:32] rooted in my deal one time you know they
[1:54:33] don't have much ice most of them don't
[1:54:35] even have a refrigerator
[1:54:36] that would be much more than just a
[1:54:37] little cool box
[1:54:40] and this sister is a good friend to me i
[1:54:42] laughed and laughed and laughed at her
[1:54:44] and she got all embarrassed but
[1:54:45] she come in there with a big picture
[1:54:47] with ice and she sees these these
[1:54:49] pictures with lemonade and stuff in them
[1:54:52] and she's talking
[1:54:53] she just walks over the first one starts
[1:54:55] pouring ice but there's cellophane on
[1:54:58] my eyes just like a trampoline
[1:55:02] and i just laughed and laughed and
[1:55:04] laughed at her sister ellie
[1:55:07] and um but it anchored a phone
[1:55:11] as clear as it might be saints
[1:55:18] that you don't even see
[1:55:21] that there's things in our lives that
[1:55:25] are keeping the spirit
[1:55:26] imported to us
[1:55:30] i want to caution you to encourage you i
[1:55:32] want to
[1:55:34] i want to stir you to recognize
[1:55:37] it might be something you can't even see
[1:55:41] but would you just today maybe tonight
[1:55:43] tomorrow
[1:55:44] whatever just stop ponder your life and
[1:55:47] say lord what
[1:55:48] is it if there's something lord in my
[1:55:51] life
[1:55:52] that would keep you from pouring into me
[1:55:56] would you take the cellophane off of me
[1:55:58] lord would you take that
[1:56:00] off of me that's keeping the holy spirit
[1:56:03] from filling meal saints we're living in
[1:56:07] a serious hour
[1:56:09] we're living in a serious hour it's not
[1:56:10] a time to play games any longer
[1:56:12] and say well if you just understood the
[1:56:15] circumstance of my life well maybe i
[1:56:17] won't understand maybe i'll never know
[1:56:18] the circumstance of your life
[1:56:20] but i'm telling you you have the ability
[1:56:22] yourself to pull the cellophane off
[1:56:25] and let god pour his holy spirit into
[1:56:27] your life
[1:56:28] that you could be full having need of
[1:56:31] nothing
[1:56:33] contrary to the spirit of laodicea that
[1:56:34] says ah we're rich we have need of
[1:56:36] nothing
[1:56:37] my brother and sister god's wanting to
[1:56:39] pour into this bride of christ
[1:56:41] his spirit his life that we would need
[1:56:44] of nothing
[1:56:45] right take that back you say brother
[1:56:46] paul where are you coming well look the
[1:56:48] prophet of god said everything you need
[1:56:50] to make a rapture is already in you but
[1:56:52] something's got to bring that to life
[1:56:55] god let it come to life in me lord let
[1:56:58] it come that i could see
[1:57:00] amen now i'm going to close with this
[1:57:04] right here
[1:57:05] before seal oops what did i do
[1:57:10] my oh my in the fourth seal sister jerry
[1:57:14] shared this with me
[1:57:16] and i just thought it was wonderful
[1:57:19] maybe it'll make you feel a little bit
[1:57:21] better about yourself
[1:57:24] he takes something ignorant and stupid
[1:57:26] something that don't hardly know your
[1:57:28] abcs or
[1:57:29] anything then he takes that type of a
[1:57:31] person
[1:57:32] because he can take something that's
[1:57:34] nothing and then work through it
[1:57:37] as long as something thinks there's
[1:57:39] something
[1:57:41] then they can do nothing with it he's
[1:57:44] always did that
[1:57:45] you have to become nothing to become
[1:57:48] somebody
[1:57:49] with god oh hallelujah
[1:57:53] you love the lord today you know i'm
[1:57:56] trying to break this old long-winded
[1:57:58] habit

[1:58:04] goodness of
[1:58:06] jesus and all
[1:58:09] he has done for me
[1:58:15] and my soul cries out
[1:58:19] hallelujah

[1:59:23] holy spirit just moved you know i had
[1:59:26] in my notes here he has forgiven me
[1:59:30] then brother jason gets up at the start
[1:59:31] of service and sings that and i thought
[1:59:33] thank you lord a little confirmation

[1:59:38] idea of man like hey

[1:59:41] everybody will think something's working
[1:59:42] together
