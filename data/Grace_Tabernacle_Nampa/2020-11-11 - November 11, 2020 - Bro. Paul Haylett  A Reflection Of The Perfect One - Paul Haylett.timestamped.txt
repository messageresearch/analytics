[27:18] amen you know i just can't sometimes
[27:21] saints you know i just
[27:22] can't get over you know certain things
[27:25] the prophet says
[27:26] we see in the scripture and i i just
[27:29] lingers with me
[27:30] day after day just constantly a reminder
[27:34] the prophet of god talking about when we
[27:36] see
[27:37] who we are amen and you know it's been a
[27:41] topic that's been being preached on and
[27:43] brought
[27:43] up and and um you know when
[27:47] we talk a little bit with uh brothers
[27:50] and friends from other parts of the
[27:52] country
[27:53] um i i think it's wonderful because i
[27:56] can assure you there's no little network
[27:58] on we're going to preach on this or
[28:00] we're going to be that
[28:01] but you'll find this very thought or
[28:04] topic
[28:04] of recognizing who we are is being
[28:07] preached
[28:08] around the world amen it's the season
[28:12] amen it's just like it's a season that
[28:15] we see what
[28:16] what the the will or desire of
[28:19] uh the people of our nation is and you
[28:22] see
[28:22] nothing to be scared of amen i i didn't
[28:25] include it tonight i'm gonna try and be
[28:27] timely
[28:28] but you know the prophet of god laid
[28:30] these things right
[28:31] out of this is what you're going to see
[28:33] the scripture says
[28:34] as it was in the days of sodom
[28:39] well saints i probably i don't know
[28:42] brother chris
[28:42] it's probably eight or ten years ago i
[28:45] was like we're at sodom
[28:48] hallelujah well i had no idea what sodom
[28:51] really was
[28:51] amen and so the thing is is we don't
[28:55] need to worry about what sodom is
[28:57] the word said you get ready amen
[29:01] when you see these signs you see him in
[29:03] the heavens you see him in the earth
[29:05] this is the time for you to look up and
[29:08] rejoice
[29:10] amen hallelujah i say thank you lord
[29:13] because i tell you i had a conversation
[29:15] with a a older man today as a friend of
[29:17] mine
[29:18] he actually stopped by and saw me there
[29:20] pulled in
[29:21] he's like paul have you recovered from
[29:23] the covet yet and i'm like
[29:25] yeah and uh he he
[29:28] is not a religious man at all he's very
[29:31] much a skeptic and
[29:32] we we were visiting there and he starts
[29:34] talking about the politics of it and
[29:37] saints i have to tell you i just was
[29:38] like yeah i don't care about that
[29:41] well what about i don't care about that
[29:43] no this doesn't matter
[29:45] that's unimportant thinks like what's
[29:48] wrong with you
[29:49] well you see i've got a heavenly home
[29:53] there's no trumps there there's no
[29:54] bidens there there's no pelosi there
[29:57] amen there's no banker there amen
[30:01] it's just a glorious place amen and
[30:04] that's what we're looking at and just to
[30:07] kind
[30:08] of you know as we spoke the other day
[30:10] you see i
[30:11] i just desire that god would allow us
[30:14] to not be out there as it were looking
[30:16] to calvary
[30:18] but to realize that we're at calvary
[30:21] looking back at what god asked us to do
[30:24] we already
[30:25] have a position we already have a
[30:28] calling
[30:29] and we already have a final result
[30:32] amen so this world is not our home can
[30:34] we say amen
[30:36] if it was my home i would be very much
[30:39] concerned as i built me a fortress on a
[30:41] mountain somewhere
[30:42] but it's not my home saints i would like
[30:45] you before we go into the word
[30:47] i'd like us as a group of believers just
[30:49] to stand are
[30:50] it's come to my attention that brother
[30:52] joe riley is
[30:54] in very dire health
[30:57] slipping away very quickly
[31:01] and it's time as believers
[31:05] that we don't build fences it's time for
[31:08] us
[31:09] to tear the fences down we might not
[31:12] agree on certain things
[31:15] but we need to have that tender heart
[31:17] that soft heart
[31:18] that we look and say lord this is a
[31:21] brother

[31:24] good conversation he brings greetings to

[34:22] hallelujah good to be a christian
[34:26] i tell you what it's so wonderful
[34:28] wonderful
[34:29] let's turn in our bibles this evening to
[34:32] first corinthians the 13th chapter
[34:34] i want to preach to you tonight
[34:36] preparations of the inner man we want to
[34:39] talk on the subject of a reflection of
[34:42] the perfect one
[34:43] and uh you know just uh kind of uh
[34:47] in studying scripture there's many
[34:49] others but i felt led to
[34:51] come here out of corinthians we'll look
[34:54] at this my brother and sister the
[34:55] scripture clear full of it maybe we'll
[34:57] carry on in
[34:58] future services but in the scripture
[35:00] talking about an
[35:02] image amen and so there will be
[35:05] images that are there and uh boy
[35:08] you think about that uh those images and
[35:12] how it is
[35:13] uh we want to come down and
[35:17] recognize that all that we are
[35:20] amen is because of our lord jesus christ
[35:23] amen we would be uh
[35:26] just like the world amen we would be
[35:29] reflected
[35:31] of the spirits of the age but christ is
[35:34] here amen amen
[35:35] amen and you know my brother and sister
[35:39] i want to just put it this way it's
[35:40] another thought for another time
[35:42] but you see how blessed we
[35:46] are is he spoke and we heard
[35:51] you think about that he spoke
[35:54] and we heard but now i'd like to turn
[35:57] that around
[36:02] we spoke and he heard
[36:06] that that's called
[36:09] fellowship hallelujah not a one-sided
[36:13] conversation
[36:17] you know sometimes you know you get a
[36:19] topic you get something on your mind and
[36:22] you're driving in the car with your wife
[36:24] and you're just talking and talking and
[36:27] talking and talking and talking and
[36:28] talking and
[36:29] when the time is over you say oh honey
[36:31] it was so wonderful to
[36:32] be communing or fellowshipping with you
[36:37] it's kind of like really
[36:40] you see it has to be a two-way
[36:42] conversation hallelujah
[36:45] thank you lord though i speak with the
[36:49] tongues
[36:49] of men and of angels and have not
[36:52] charity and become a sounding brass
[36:56] or a tinkling symbol and though i have
[36:59] the gift of prophecy
[37:01] my brother and sister that's pretty
[37:03] incredible when you think about that
[37:06] and understand all mysteries
[37:12] there's these lines right here you could
[37:14] just preach for months
[37:16] and all knowledge and then it now gets
[37:19] really deep
[37:20] and though i have all faith so that i
[37:23] could remove
[37:24] mountains and have not charity
[37:28] i am nothing and though i bestow
[37:31] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[37:33] i give my body to be burned and
[37:35] have not charity it profiteth me
[37:39] nothing charity suffereth long
[37:43] and is kind charity envieth not
[37:48] charity vaunteth not itself is not
[37:51] puffed up
[37:52] does not behave itself unseemly
[37:55] seeketh not her own is not easily
[37:59] provoked thinketh no evil
[38:03] us not in iniquity but rejoice in the
[38:06] truth
[38:08] beareth all things believeth all things
[38:10] hopeleth all things
[38:12] endureth all things charity
[38:15] never faileth but whether there be
[38:18] prophecies
[38:19] they shall fail where there be tongues
[38:21] they shall cease
[38:23] where there be knowledge it shall vanish
[38:26] away my brother and sister i want to
[38:29] interject in this i've hit recently very
[38:31] much
[38:32] on the topic of an intellectual
[38:34] revelation of the message
[38:36] you see where there be knowledge
[38:39] it shall vanish away there comes
[38:42] something if an intellectual
[38:44] revelation is what we have of this word
[38:47] of this day
[38:48] something will come and replace that
[38:54] oh my lord give us revelation of your
[38:57] word
[38:59] let the spirit man be able to reach out
[39:01] and take a hold of that
[39:03] and let us you know these are words we
[39:05] get excited over
[39:07] but i want you to understand the depth
[39:09] of what it really means when the prophet
[39:11] of god says
[39:12] you know or expounds upon ye are bone of
[39:14] his bone
[39:16] amen you are flesh of his flesh this
[39:19] means that you can no
[39:20] more depart from christ then he himself
[39:24] could divide himself
[39:37] for we no impart
[39:41] we prophesy in part
[39:44] but when that which is perfect
[39:47] is come then that which is in part
[39:51] shall be done away when i was a child i
[39:54] spake as a child understood as a child
[39:56] and i thought as a child
[39:58] but when i became a man i put away
[40:01] childish things
[40:03] for now we see through a glass darkly
[40:08] but then amen and another time another
[40:11] season moving into it right
[40:14] but then face to face now i know in part
[40:18] but
[40:18] then shall i know even as also
[40:22] i am known now my brother and sister we
[40:25] could look at this in a carnal realm and
[40:26] say oh how is it that we are known
[40:28] well i don't care who you are you will
[40:30] find someone who does not like you
[40:33] and you'll have someone who lifts you up
[40:36] much higher than they should
[40:40] but to be known here in the scripture
[40:43] is tying us back to the original seed
[40:49] the very image of who we are in jesus
[40:52] christ is the revelation that will be
[40:55] made known
[40:56] hallelujah and now abideth faith hope
[41:00] and charity
[41:01] these three but the greatest of these is
[41:04] charity
[41:05] heavenly father we ask you lord to guide
[41:08] us tonight let us speak let it be only
[41:10] according to thy word
[41:12] lord for the edification of the body of
[41:15] christ
[41:15] lord to give praise glory and honor to
[41:18] you we ask this
[41:20] father in your precious name amen you
[41:22] may be seated
[41:27] as i come across the words that inspired
[41:30] me to pursue this thought
[41:33] i realized my brother and sister that
[41:36] there is something in our life
[41:38] that each one of us is drawn to there
[41:42] is something that we come and let's look
[41:45] for just a moment in the natural
[41:47] there are those that might love the big
[41:49] city
[41:50] uh there are those that would be just as
[41:52] at home maybe on a mountaintop somewhere
[41:55] uh maybe they don't like the city at all
[41:57] vice versa
[41:58] and you look at this that we're drawn in
[42:00] a natural element
[42:02] now whatever we put before us my brother
[42:05] and sister
[42:06] is an influence uh in our life amen
[42:09] and so you know as we look at this as
[42:11] brother branham preaches a
[42:13] message influence uh we'll recognize
[42:16] that these things are all pushing on us
[42:18] and
[42:19] and you know in that uh sometimes you'll
[42:21] have
[42:22] something that you didn't realize was an
[42:25] influence to you but it is present and
[42:27] it's having an effect
[42:29] and so we'll look and see how that while
[42:32] we are desiring to
[42:34] uh uh fulfill every drop of the word of
[42:37] god right for the bride of jesus christ
[42:39] amen that's our desire we're not
[42:41] here just to have a religious experience
[42:45] but we are desiring to come into
[42:48] the very one amen the scripture says
[42:50] that we were made
[42:51] in his image amen and so we will be
[42:54] manifest and
[42:55] you know that's a very interesting
[42:57] thought deviate for just a moment
[42:59] we were made in his image and when god
[43:01] chose to come down
[43:03] into our presence amen what did he do
[43:06] he then came in the very image he made
[43:09] you and i
[43:10] in and that's the image he chose to
[43:12] present
[43:13] himself to us because he wanted us to be
[43:16] able to relate
[43:18] to him he did not want to come as a high
[43:20] priest it would settle on the pinnacle
[43:22] of the of the uh temple you know and
[43:25] and cause the people to bow down but he
[43:27] commonly walked with us
[43:29] and it was in him that all the deity
[43:33] of of god all of that uh mystery
[43:36] of the the body of christ was in him and
[43:40] it walked right amongst the world and
[43:42] they could not see him
[43:44] but by revelation those that were called
[43:46] saw him
[43:47] and so we see that that was the very
[43:49] type that god laid
[43:50] all through the ages is that god in
[43:53] flesh
[43:54] would be walking right here in laodicea
[43:57] and only a small portion of the world
[44:00] would even
[44:00] recognize that god was in flesh in fact
[44:04] it's a little scary my brother and
[44:05] sister that there are people
[44:07] around the message even this struggle
[44:09] with the idea of god being
[44:11] in them amen but if you ever catch a
[44:15] revelation
[44:16] of how this relationship really works
[44:19] you'll recognize that the very fiber of
[44:22] your being
[44:23] is god amen it is not you know as
[44:26] brother brown says it's not
[44:27] of charles and ella branham amen because
[44:31] that
[44:31] would be a sinful nature but we have a
[44:34] higher calling a higher revelation
[44:36] of who we really are amen and so as
[44:40] we'll look and i i just want to expedite
[44:42] this tonight
[44:43] i'm speaking to believers amen but when
[44:46] that which is perfect is come
[44:48] and you know there's many many places
[44:50] and we maybe lord willing touch on it in
[44:53] the future
[44:53] but brother branham talks about that
[44:56] when the perfect
[44:57] is come that was our lord jesus christ
[45:00] but it's not that we look back to
[45:02] calvary or
[45:03] look back to a.d 33 looking back in that
[45:06] my brother and sister and when that
[45:08] perfect brother branham says that the
[45:10] word of god the presence of god the holy
[45:12] spirit
[45:13] come in every age to manifest the word
[45:17] for that age
[45:18] amen but we're looking now at the
[45:20] culmination of the ages
[45:22] and everything that was on display in
[45:24] that first church age second third
[45:26] fourth fifth sixth
[45:27] is now brought together amen and it's on
[45:30] display now
[45:32] now you wonder just who you are well
[45:34] i'll tell you what you are
[45:35] god called you to be able to live every
[45:38] word
[45:39] amen that has come forth amen not just a
[45:42] portion not to just say well we have
[45:44] a singular portion here of our day but
[45:47] god has called you to be able to live
[45:50] every word abel but he's also placed the
[45:53] desire there that you want to live
[45:55] every word amen otherwise you could say
[45:58] well it's available but i don't feel
[46:00] like doing it
[46:00] no god's put inside of you the desire
[46:04] to live it oh how so the perfect one has
[46:08] come
[46:09] see so those things that are in part
[46:10] shall be done away now let's not confuse
[46:12] this
[46:13] that we believe we have every drop of
[46:15] the fullness of christ of the mystery of
[46:17] christ
[46:18] right here right now that we could
[46:20] describe these things you see
[46:21] we'll if life went on a million years we
[46:24] will
[46:24] never fully see who our lord jesus is
[46:27] amen
[46:28] we'll never fully have a revelation of
[46:30] who god is
[46:31] because he's so much greater than the
[46:34] capacity
[46:34] that we as humans are but we will live
[46:37] all
[46:38] he called us to live we will understand
[46:41] all he has called us to understand we
[46:44] will not be shorted on one measure
[46:47] not one bit of our stature amen so don't
[46:49] go running around trying to compare
[46:51] yourself
[46:52] or compare our church or what is
[46:54] happening here with someone else
[46:56] you seek what god has for you
[46:59] amen make your calling
[47:02] an election sure amen now we care about
[47:06] one another
[47:07] we do don't we i hope we can say amen
[47:10] but you see my brother and sister you
[47:12] can no more put me in the rapture than i
[47:14] can put you in the rapture
[47:16] but we as a body of believers can
[47:17] encourage one another and strengthen one
[47:19] another
[47:20] to stand on the word and the word will
[47:22] put us in a rapture
[47:23] amen so now see we we see through a
[47:26] glass
[47:26] darkly in other words it's there that
[47:29] there's an image we see
[47:30] these things it's not completely clear
[47:33] to us
[47:34] but the day is coming see then face to
[47:36] face
[47:37] what we know in part now we shall know
[47:39] even as i am known
[47:40] so we see how the revelation of god is
[47:43] opening to you and i
[47:45] and there will be a point in time i
[47:47] don't know when this is
[47:48] i i'm kind of a little bit loath to to
[47:51] uh try and
[47:52] drive home something amen my brother and
[47:55] sister
[47:56] if we you know what happened if we knew
[47:58] the date when the lord was coming
[48:01] most of us would just kind of live these
[48:03] laxatical lives and then the night
[48:06] before he's going to come
[48:08] we'd have a revival
[48:13] but that's not what god wants
[48:17] you imagine if i knew that the lord was
[48:20] coming on
[48:22] whatever date 2021
[48:30] maybe i won't get there that might get
[48:32] personal
[48:34] i tell you the nature of many would be
[48:35] they wouldn't read their bible they
[48:37] wouldn't pray
[48:38] they wouldn't study the word they might
[48:41] not go lie cheat steal drink dance all
[48:44] that things they just
[48:45] get lazy because we know it's on this
[48:48] date we got to get ready
[48:50] that's why he said i'm going to come as
[48:52] a thief in the night
[48:54] so what you need to do if you're worried
[48:55] about the thief in the night you just
[48:57] need to make sure you're ready
[49:00] so when i come it won't matter no
[49:01] morning noon or night
[49:04] you'll just be ready i'll tell you
[49:06] there's something liberated my brother
[49:08] and sister liberating
[49:10] about living on fire for god not not
[49:12] just existing not just
[49:14] uh trudging along but living a liberated
[49:18] life amen
[49:19] you know it's there that he called us he
[49:22] said you know what
[49:23] i'm just gonna paraphrase the scripture
[49:25] i don't want you going back to your old
[49:27] bondage
[49:28] i want you to live in the liberty
[49:31] by which i have already set you free
[49:36] amen that's where he wants us to be
[49:38] living in that liberty
[49:40] hallelujah so now as we'll move forward
[49:42] i want to just do this as we're speaking
[49:44] or coming into these thoughts
[49:46] i've really pruned this down tonight
[49:48] realize uh
[49:49] god's got mercy and a lot of this is
[49:52] will expand you might say or
[49:54] is fresh to you in proverbs 27
[49:57] 19 as we'll look at reflections my
[49:59] brother and sister
[50:02] as in water face
[50:06] enters to face so the heart of man
[50:10] to man now we'll look at this i want you
[50:12] to think about this in a natural but
[50:14] move over into the spiritual okay but
[50:17] you look at this there has to be a
[50:19] surface of some nature
[50:23] by which can reflect back you can go
[50:26] and if the wind is blowing or there's
[50:28] moss and leaves upon the water you will
[50:30] find
[50:31] no reflection but you know we have seen
[50:35] the pictures taken by professional or
[50:38] those that are good photographers we've
[50:41] seen the picture
[50:42] that is is of the lake with the
[50:45] mountains
[50:46] and how that it is reflected so
[50:48] perfectly upon the water
[50:50] uh sometime back here i saw a picture uh
[50:53] the the back story of this photographer
[50:56] is they set there for days and days and
[50:58] days and took hundreds of pictures
[51:00] until the one turned out perfect and it
[51:03] was a waterfalls coming off of the edge
[51:06] of a mountain
[51:07] into the edge of this lake and the
[51:09] picture becoming so perfect the water
[51:11] like glass
[51:12] the pitcher it looks like the waterfall
[51:15] comes in
[51:16] but if you turn the pitcher over and
[51:18] this is where they get you
[51:19] which side was the original
[51:22] it was such a perfect reflection
[51:25] you could take the photo turn it over
[51:28] and it was
[51:29] hard to decide which one was the
[51:32] original or the background
[51:34] because it was such a perfect reflection
[51:37] and so you know as it is as in water
[51:40] faith
[51:41] answers face my brother and sister if
[51:43] we're looking into the perfect water
[51:45] tonight
[51:45] it is so glassy we look down if i lean
[51:49] over that water amen brother trevor's
[51:52] face is not going to appear
[51:56] you see what it reflects back is what is
[52:00] there
[52:00] the reflection or the water does not
[52:03] determine what is
[52:04] seen but the image that is there
[52:09] are you with me it has to be an image
[52:12] there
[52:12] and whatever that image is is all that
[52:16] can be reflected back
[52:19] so we cannot come and put a faith as it
[52:23] were
[52:23] and look into the water and be
[52:25] corruptible and get an
[52:27] image back of the incorruptible you say
[52:30] wait now brother paul
[52:32] no no my brother and sister i'm on the
[52:34] right track don't misunderstand me
[52:36] you say but brother paul we're not
[52:38] perfect no my word my bible says i'm
[52:40] perfect
[52:41] so as a believer i can look into the
[52:44] water
[52:45] and in this flesh i am corruptable
[52:48] but as i look into that what is
[52:50] reflected back as a believer
[52:53] in the word of god is not corruptable
[52:56] it is incorruptible that is reflected
[52:59] back to me
[53:00] and so as we look at this following here
[53:02] in the natural
[53:04] amen for there to be an image reflected
[53:07] back there has to be an
[53:09] image original image that is there to be
[53:13] reflected because it will be my brother
[53:16] and sister
[53:17] the reflector can only reflect
[53:21] back the mirror image
[53:28] as it is that the lake can only reflect
[53:30] the image before her
[53:32] so it is to man we can only reflect the
[53:36] image
[53:37] before us now my brother and sister we
[53:41] look at this sometimes and
[53:42] and you know the the word of god opens
[53:45] up so many avenues
[53:47] that that sometimes you say which which
[53:49] one of these
[53:50] which avenue should i take well
[53:51] sometimes there is no wrong avenue you
[53:53] just have to ask god for leadership
[53:56] on what direction to go amen so as we'll
[53:59] look at the image that has been placed
[54:01] before us
[54:02] this is why sometimes my brother and
[54:04] sister i may sound redundant and i know
[54:06] you don't like me using that word it's
[54:08] very redundant
[54:09] but it's there my brother and sister we
[54:11] have to be reminded
[54:13] that we are not to look in the flesh
[54:16] to try to find what it is god wants us
[54:19] to be
[54:19] but we have to look to one that is
[54:22] perfect amen we have to look to the
[54:25] perfect one
[54:26] because if we look to that image of the
[54:28] corruptable
[54:29] all we will see is the corruptable
[54:33] amen so we as sons and daughters of god
[54:36] must look to a higher image a greater
[54:38] image amen to really see who we are
[54:41] in other words you're gonna have to look
[54:43] at something that's beyond
[54:45] this tangible world we live in if you're
[54:48] ever going to see the perfect
[54:51] hallelujah because if we look at this
[54:54] tangible level right here or this
[54:56] earthly level
[54:57] all we will see is the corruptable we
[55:00] can preach about well we are
[55:02] perfect we're righteous we're holy uh we
[55:05] are washed by the water of the word and
[55:07] then we just start looking at one
[55:08] another judging one another
[55:10] following one another around seeing what
[55:12] each other's faults and failures are our
[55:14] weaknesses are
[55:15] and we will never be able to fully grasp
[55:17] what it is to be perfect but when we
[55:19] raise
[55:20] our image oh hallelujah if i could just
[55:23] lay this out for you
[55:24] that photographer that took that picture
[55:27] of that perfect reflection
[55:29] of those mountains my brother and sister
[55:31] it wasn't about the water
[55:34] oh do you recognize it if they had
[55:37] tilted the camera down a little farther
[55:39] they might have saw leaf and twigs and
[55:41] rocks and
[55:42] and all kinds of things but you see when
[55:45] it's looking
[55:45] in the right way it is about the water
[55:48] you might see the shoreline you might
[55:51] see all the imperfections
[55:53] but what catches you is the fact that
[55:55] here
[55:56] is something so majestic here is
[55:59] something so
[55:59] incredible and everything being perfect
[56:02] it
[56:03] is reflected back to you so much that
[56:05] you can look at the water
[56:07] and you can see the trees you can look
[56:09] at the water and you can see the rocks
[56:11] you can look at the water and you can
[56:13] see the sky
[56:15] you see my brother and sister we raise
[56:18] our eyes a little further
[56:20] and we don't have to look at the
[56:21] reflection we can look at the original
[56:25] amen so it all depends on what position
[56:27] you
[56:28] choose to look and you'll find the
[56:30] christian that walks with his head down
[56:32] always laboring always struggling always
[56:34] criticizing himself
[56:36] always judging himself harshly all he
[56:38] sees
[56:39] is the rocks and the roots and the
[56:41] insects and the whatever
[56:42] it is and he lifts his eyes a little
[56:44] higher and he sees a reflection of
[56:46] something so majestic
[56:48] but he still doesn't have the real thing
[56:54] that's why religion my brother and
[56:55] sister
[56:57] just that religion we're going to move
[57:00] beyond religion because the original is
[57:02] right there before our eyes if we will
[57:04] lift our eyes up to look
[57:06] amen hallelujah
[57:10] amen we can only reflect the image
[57:13] before us
[57:14] now look when god was speaking to moses
[57:16] in the ten commandments in exodus 20
[57:19] we'll see that he says thou shalt have
[57:21] no other gods before me
[57:24] now when we read that we say okay that's
[57:26] the ten commandments
[57:28] that's good no other gods god's a
[57:29] jealous god but i want you to look at
[57:32] that scripture in light of reflection
[57:35] my brother and sister you see as we have
[57:38] jehovah the lord god almighty elohim
[57:42] before us that is what we look to
[57:46] that is what we long for that's what
[57:47] we're focused on
[57:49] what will we do we will start
[57:53] i'm talking about in the broad spectrum
[57:55] of who we are
[57:57] flesh man spiritual man when we look to
[58:00] that
[58:00] reflection as it were of the perfect one
[58:04] we start to reflect that
[58:10] i watched the metamorphosis of a man i
[58:12] knew years ago
[58:14] he went to work in a certain place
[58:19] there was a man there that was good
[58:21] family man i guess the man had just a
[58:23] lovely family but he dressed like a
[58:27] biker
[58:29] he owned a harley but it was one of
[58:31] those slicker
[58:32] kind of harleys not hardcore
[58:37] and this man i knew goes to work in that
[58:40] business
[58:41] and ends up working right on the same
[58:44] spot in a shop
[58:46] with that man the next thing you know he
[58:48] had square toed boots
[58:51] pretty soon he had a wallet with a chain
[58:53] on it
[58:55] then he had a belt with metal studs
[58:58] and then i didn't see him for a long
[59:00] time and one day i run into him and he's
[59:01] wearing this leather wristband with all
[59:03] these
[59:04] spikes on it i couldn't help myself but
[59:07] i asked him did you steal that from your
[59:08] dog
[59:11] but you see my brother and sister there
[59:14] was something about that man that he
[59:16] had maybe wanted to be in his life
[59:20] i hope you're with me and that image was
[59:23] before him
[59:24] and over time he started to change
[59:29] into that image
[59:32] it's a beautiful story because you see
[59:35] he was such a good worker and had such
[59:37] skill he was a welder
[59:39] and had such skills that he was working
[59:42] on a big commercial job in boise and
[59:43] some other company
[59:44] caught his attention they said who did
[59:46] these welds and they said it was sam
[59:50] and that company went right to sam and
[59:52] said i don't care what they pay you
[59:53] we'll pay you more come work for us
[59:55] and sam leaves that job it's a good
[59:57] opportunity
[59:58] and he goes to work for another company
[1:00:00] but in that company everybody was high
[1:00:02] tight and white
[1:00:05] and did you know over time oh can
[1:00:07] anybody tell me what happened to sam
[1:00:11] sam turn high white and tight
[1:00:14] because that was the image before him
[1:00:18] now you say that's so silly a man be
[1:00:20] that moldable
[1:00:22] you are
[1:00:25] you are and if the image before us
[1:00:29] is the image of the corruptable we will
[1:00:32] end up being in the image of the
[1:00:35] corruptable
[1:00:37] but when that image is in the image of
[1:00:39] the incorruptable
[1:00:40] you will find that any man or woman that
[1:00:43] will
[1:00:44] elevate god in their life and look to
[1:00:46] him
[1:00:47] in him alone you will see your life
[1:00:50] change oh lord change me
[1:00:54] change me lord hallelujah
[1:00:59] amen hallelujah
[1:01:02] see you can only reflect the image
[1:01:04] that's before you now as god speaking to
[1:01:06] moses as i said
[1:01:08] thou shalt have no other gods before me
[1:01:10] my brother and sister don't
[1:01:11] misunderstand me i'm not trying to
[1:01:13] turn the ten commandments but i want you
[1:01:14] to just catch this little revelation
[1:01:17] god knew that whatever image was in
[1:01:19] front of the people
[1:01:21] would be what they would start to
[1:01:23] reflect and we see
[1:01:24] moses is on the mountain and a spirit is
[1:01:27] in the camp
[1:01:28] and they take all their jewelry and
[1:01:30] rings and necklaces and all this
[1:01:31] and they melt it down and they mold a
[1:01:34] golden calf
[1:01:35] and when moses comes down from the
[1:01:37] mountain these people no longer have the
[1:01:39] image of god before them
[1:01:40] they've got the image of an idol of a
[1:01:43] calf as though there was
[1:01:44] ever a calf that provided was ever a
[1:01:47] healer
[1:01:48] ever a deliverer ever any no no calf
[1:01:51] ever did
[1:01:52] that they uh because oh so hallowed
[1:01:56] i just can't get it out amen because
[1:01:59] they
[1:01:59] never never my brother and sister
[1:02:01] anchored on jehovah
[1:02:03] as the only image they were there then
[1:02:06] moldable
[1:02:07] they were there influenceable to another
[1:02:10] image and what that image was they
[1:02:13] started to become
[1:02:15] are you with me i'm sorry tonight i was
[1:02:18] stuttering around here because my mind's
[1:02:20] already left me it's like maybe meridian
[1:02:22] headed to mountain home i don't know but
[1:02:24] look at this my brother and sister
[1:02:26] now shall have no other gods before me
[1:02:28] no other image for you to be influenced
[1:02:30] by
[1:02:31] and i want to say tonight if you and i
[1:02:33] would put every other
[1:02:35] image of this world out of our mind
[1:02:38] and raise christ up before us you say
[1:02:40] brother paul
[1:02:41] i'm struggling to live i'm struggling to
[1:02:44] be excited about serving god
[1:02:46] there might be another image in your way
[1:02:49] and if you deal with that image get it
[1:02:51] pushed out
[1:02:52] put it where it belongs and the only
[1:02:54] image you see is jesus christ
[1:02:56] you will find it's easy to follow that
[1:03:00] image
[1:03:05] i'll move on from that thought i believe
[1:03:07] you catch where i'm at
[1:03:10] now i don't mean to sound intellectual
[1:03:13] here i love to read
[1:03:15] i read a variety of things you might
[1:03:18] want to go look this up if
[1:03:20] if you're not familiar with it but when
[1:03:22] you look at the principle of probable
[1:03:24] outcome now it's more of a modern
[1:03:28] thinking but my brother and sister
[1:03:32] in the principle of probable outcome
[1:03:34] which is pretty self-explanatory right
[1:03:36] don't get too serious on it right
[1:03:39] probable
[1:03:40] outcome that's where you can sit back
[1:03:42] and say this is this and this and it
[1:03:44] will probably
[1:03:44] do this this and this and this will be
[1:03:47] it'll probably be like this
[1:03:50] the man spends all of his money every
[1:03:52] paycheck
[1:03:53] probable outcome he will be poor
[1:03:57] are you with me so i'm not trying to
[1:04:00] sound sophisticated it's just the term
[1:04:01] that goes with it
[1:04:03] now you look at this i'm being redundant
[1:04:06] here
[1:04:07] forgive me but whatever it is before you
[1:04:13] is what you're going to reflect now can
[1:04:16] i go to kind of a humorous side of this
[1:04:19] when i was a young man my family come to
[1:04:22] the message
[1:04:24] we're farmers that's the life i knew
[1:04:28] that was the world we lived in
[1:04:31] we start to get immersed you might say
[1:04:33] into the message
[1:04:35] i say this in humor nothing against my
[1:04:37] father my mother but the very first time
[1:04:38] my parents went to listen to a tape
[1:04:41] here we are these wild indian
[1:04:43] long-haired kids
[1:04:45] and i remember my dad lined us all up
[1:04:47] before we went to another
[1:04:49] another people's house and he put his
[1:04:51] hand
[1:04:53] in our face and he said if you kids act
[1:04:55] up tonight
[1:04:56] when we get home i will beat you
[1:05:02] what an introduction i set like a church
[1:05:06] mouse
[1:05:10] i remember the first time still
[1:05:11] registered my mind
[1:05:13] i heard the voice good evening friends
[1:05:18] now my brother and sister if what
[1:05:24] is set before us
[1:05:28] the probable outcome that is what we're
[1:05:30] going to reflect
[1:05:33] i do not say this to be negative but
[1:05:36] just to make a point
[1:05:39] it wasn't long as the church started to
[1:05:42] grow
[1:05:46] the guys who didn't know which end of
[1:05:49] the horse to throw the saddle on or put
[1:05:51] the bridle on
[1:05:52] were wearing cowboy boots an eagle belt
[1:05:56] buckle
[1:05:57] they had a cowboy hat and they had a cb
[1:06:00] in their vehicle you know it is kind of
[1:06:04] humorous when you look at a station
[1:06:06] wagon with two rabbit ears on it
[1:06:09] just doesn't fit the image i'm sorry
[1:06:12] everyone they scoured every gun shop in
[1:06:15] this country
[1:06:16] to find their version of blondie
[1:06:22] i hope you catch my point was it the
[1:06:25] revealed word that was drawing them
[1:06:28] no there was another image and they were
[1:06:31] conforming or being drawn into that
[1:06:33] image
[1:06:34] my brother and sister it wasn't brother
[1:06:35] branham's fault
[1:06:38] it was nothing to do with the message
[1:06:40] this was the image that people thought
[1:06:42] the message was
[1:06:43] and so they were drawn to that but when
[1:06:46] the day
[1:06:46] come that they come as it were to the
[1:06:49] skirmish line to the battle line
[1:06:51] to the battlefront let's call it that
[1:06:53] that they had no other foundation than
[1:06:56] we have conformed
[1:06:57] to what they thought the message was and
[1:07:00] when they come to the battlefront
[1:07:02] and the blood started to flow and there
[1:07:04] was casualties
[1:07:06] they said this isn't what i signed up
[1:07:07] for
[1:07:10] you see the wrong image had been left
[1:07:13] before them
[1:07:15] that they thought they were believers of
[1:07:17] the message because they had
[1:07:19] lined up to a certain image but my
[1:07:21] brother and sister
[1:07:22] i was talking with the brother george
[1:07:24] today i was going to say a brother but
[1:07:25] you're smart enough figure it out if i
[1:07:27] was talking i was talking to brother
[1:07:28] george today
[1:07:29] brother george made a comment he goes
[1:07:30] well brother paul press the battle
[1:07:32] have a wonderful service tonight and
[1:07:34] remember we got to point people to jesus
[1:07:37] christ
[1:07:38] amen we don't want to point them to
[1:07:40] ourselves we don't want to point them to
[1:07:41] our church
[1:07:42] we don't want to point them to some kind
[1:07:43] of movement we want to point them to
[1:07:45] jesus christ
[1:07:46] and my brother and sister it won't
[1:07:48] happen here because i believe god's been
[1:07:50] gracious to you
[1:07:51] you have that revelation but there's
[1:07:53] many a group in the message tonight
[1:07:55] that the image before them is a pastor
[1:07:58] the image before them is their church
[1:08:00] and its reputation around the world and
[1:08:03] that is what is before them but my
[1:08:05] brother and sister
[1:08:06] if we point to christ and that's the
[1:08:09] only image that's left before us
[1:08:11] when you get to the battle line and the
[1:08:13] blood starts to flow
[1:08:15] and their enemy is pressing to the mark
[1:08:17] you are not going to say well wait
[1:08:19] this isn't what i signed up for you're
[1:08:21] going to stand there and say you know
[1:08:23] what
[1:08:23] greater is he is in me than is in this
[1:08:26] world
[1:08:27] i can do all things through christ jesus
[1:08:31] hallelujah it won't be wait wait i need
[1:08:33] to call my pastor
[1:08:35] well i'll make a call all right lord
[1:08:37] come on the scene
[1:08:38] amen and when you speak he hears
[1:08:43] hallelujah and the reason you can have
[1:08:45] that kind of confidence
[1:08:46] is because when he spoke you heard
[1:08:49] hallelujah that's what makes a
[1:08:52] difference right there
[1:08:53] amen hallelujah
[1:08:56] see if there's other gods before us
[1:08:58] saints i'm going to just drive this home
[1:09:00] tonight i love you and i'm not preaching
[1:09:02] hard on you at all but i just feel led
[1:09:04] of the lord to lay this out
[1:09:07] we will be whatever image
[1:09:12] is before us
[1:09:18] you know something's very common in our
[1:09:20] semi-religious world we live in
[1:09:24] i've heard it around the message i've
[1:09:26] had people in other countries say
[1:09:27] brother paul i'd like to talk to you and
[1:09:29] then when they lay their problem out and
[1:09:31] you you get very direct with them they
[1:09:33] say don't judge me
[1:09:35] you don't know the circumstance you
[1:09:37] don't know my life
[1:09:39] it's a very common thing in this
[1:09:41] semi-religious world we live in
[1:09:45] you can't hardly witness to somebody and
[1:09:47] say something that might go against
[1:09:48] their grain don't judge me
[1:09:53] but you see the problem my brother and
[1:09:54] sister is
[1:09:56] it's not us it's judging it's the word
[1:10:00] you see what they've forgotten
[1:10:03] what they think people are judging them
[1:10:05] what they have forgotten
[1:10:07] is that they are projecting an image of
[1:10:09] something
[1:10:15] let's forget about denomination my
[1:10:18] brother and sister ride in the realms of
[1:10:19] the message
[1:10:21] people projecting images
[1:10:24] what is it that's what they're holding
[1:10:26] in front of them
[1:10:28] that's what stood up as a priority in
[1:10:30] front of them
[1:10:34] they can't help themselves but reflect
[1:10:38] that image
[1:10:42] well i hope i haven't stomped on too
[1:10:44] many toes tonight
[1:10:46] praise the lord now remember when
[1:10:47] somebody shut your fingers in the door
[1:10:49] stomps on your toes you say ouch
[1:10:51] amen
[1:10:55] you see what's happened saints we are
[1:10:58] either projecting the risen
[1:11:00] or the fallen there's no other choice
[1:11:04] people say well
[1:11:04] you know this is what we are this we're
[1:11:06] doing no there's only two spirits in the
[1:11:07] framework of the church
[1:11:08] we're projecting the risen or we're
[1:11:10] projecting the fallen
[1:11:13] see that risen nature is christ
[1:11:17] the fallen nature is antichrist you see
[1:11:20] so christ
[1:11:21] you might say involved in both sides of
[1:11:23] this but one they're pushing against it
[1:11:26] brother branham speaks about this
[1:11:27] several different places i kind of
[1:11:29] stepped around this because it draws off
[1:11:31] in another angle
[1:11:32] but brother branham says now everything
[1:11:34] that the sadducees the pharisees
[1:11:37] every they had studied in the word
[1:11:39] clearly
[1:11:40] showed them what they should be looking
[1:11:43] for
[1:11:47] but another image had been raised up in
[1:11:49] front of them of what
[1:11:51] it would be they knew they had the word
[1:11:54] they told them what to look for
[1:11:56] now tell me my brother and sister if
[1:11:58] that ain't the same spirit in the world
[1:11:59] we live in today
[1:12:00] we have the word that tells us what to
[1:12:02] look for but if another image gets
[1:12:05] raised up in front of that
[1:12:07] then we will move off to the right or to
[1:12:09] the left because we've been taught this
[1:12:12] image is the image you should look at
[1:12:14] and my brother and sister god wants us
[1:12:16] to go back to the word
[1:12:17] amen raise that up as the image not our
[1:12:21] interpretation of the word now i'm going
[1:12:23] to just speak a little bold this might
[1:12:25] be direct if somebody's listening on the
[1:12:26] internet and this offends you i'm sorry
[1:12:28] but it's true but many years ago when
[1:12:31] the eagle computing remember that when
[1:12:32] eagle computing not the table
[1:12:34] but when eagle computing come out the
[1:12:36] very first
[1:12:37] deal i i forget what it was it ran on
[1:12:40] dos
[1:12:41] i think it was and and i was proficient
[1:12:43] at dos at one time i know you guys won't
[1:12:45] believe that
[1:12:46] but i used to be proficient on a
[1:12:47] computer
[1:12:49] about 40 years ago
[1:12:54] but we were coming out of those we were
[1:12:57] associated with there was things we
[1:12:59] couldn't deal with
[1:13:02] and for years saints like i said i don't
[1:13:05] say this critically i'm making a point
[1:13:07] for years we had been told brother
[1:13:09] branham said
[1:13:12] i want you to see this brother branham
[1:13:15] said
[1:13:15] this this this what did it do
[1:13:18] those words raised an image up before us
[1:13:25] okay brother brahm said that we believe
[1:13:28] he's a prophet
[1:13:30] our life started to conform to those
[1:13:34] words
[1:13:35] right we're being drawn in those words
[1:13:38] because we want to be right
[1:13:43] but then god started pushing us out
[1:13:44] there were little things that happened
[1:13:46] and
[1:13:46] i won't go into that but little things
[1:13:48] started moving us and
[1:13:50] and unfortunately i will say this
[1:13:53] kind of indictment on paul god led my
[1:13:56] wife first
[1:13:58] she started saying paul this ain't right
[1:14:01] or behavior
[1:14:05] and i was like oh it's all right it's
[1:14:06] all right and she was like
[1:14:11] i'm not going to be involved with that
[1:14:12] any longer
[1:14:14] we called it fellowship
[1:14:18] friday night movies
[1:14:21] and the quality of the movies just
[1:14:22] slowly declined
[1:14:27] and she said i ain't doing it no more
[1:14:29] and i was like oh honey just
[1:14:31] yawn and go to the bathroom or something
[1:14:32] when
[1:14:34] nope ain't doing it then god convicted
[1:14:36] me because they mocked my wife
[1:14:40] not because my heart smit me but when
[1:14:43] they mocked my wife i said
[1:14:45] enough of that
[1:14:48] we started looking in the eagle
[1:14:50] computing
[1:14:52] brother branham said it we change the
[1:14:55] words
[1:14:56] every way you can change it we
[1:14:59] never even to this day have found
[1:15:02] what they said brother branham said
[1:15:06] but look at the image that was raised up
[1:15:08] to us
[1:15:09] it caused us as a group of young married
[1:15:12] couples
[1:15:13] to feel okay to behave a certain way
[1:15:17] it caused us to have a certain
[1:15:19] perspective of
[1:15:20] the message of the hour and my brother
[1:15:23] and sister i would declare to you
[1:15:24] it never existed in the words
[1:15:28] that they used that's right but the
[1:15:31] image that was raised
[1:15:34] affected a whole group of people
[1:15:40] the mere words
[1:15:44] i'm not too too direct am i tonight
[1:15:49] you see you're going to push back
[1:15:53] against this and say no way brother paul
[1:15:55] but i want you to just give me the
[1:15:56] liberty to look at this in a natural
[1:15:58] sense
[1:16:00] do you realize saints when it's crafted
[1:16:03] and molded and presented in the right
[1:16:05] way
[1:16:06] every one of you can be drawn into that
[1:16:10] the only that you're not
[1:16:14] is because the holy ghost is in you
[1:16:17] the only reason as humans in the flesh
[1:16:21] you can be molded and drawn into this
[1:16:24] because of the image that is put in
[1:16:26] front of you oh we ought to thank the
[1:16:28] lord tonight
[1:16:29] for the holy ghost amen we won't be
[1:16:32] deceived saints
[1:16:33] amen it said if it were possible but the
[1:16:36] holy ghost has sealed you to the day of
[1:16:38] your
[1:16:39] redemption so if you are sealed there is
[1:16:42] nothing can get in there
[1:16:43] to take away or draw it out we'll go to
[1:16:46] a scripture in a minute
[1:16:48] quote in a minute to draw it out or to
[1:16:51] add something
[1:16:52] into it you see if it's drawn out it can
[1:16:57] still be pure but it's depleted
[1:17:00] right that's why it's not just one
[1:17:02] filling of the holy ghost and go on the
[1:17:04] rest of your life
[1:17:05] you need many refillings because satan
[1:17:07] will draw that out of you
[1:17:09] life will draw that out of you and you
[1:17:11] will have the truth
[1:17:12] and you will want to serve god and wake
[1:17:14] up one day so weary in your well doing
[1:17:17] depleted
[1:17:17] you won't have the strength to go on but
[1:17:20] you
[1:17:21] might hold in your hand the pure word of
[1:17:23] god
[1:17:25] the other side is if you're not sealed
[1:17:28] until the day of your redemption
[1:17:29] somebody will come along
[1:17:31] this is a true story actually comes out
[1:17:32] of world war ii where they wanted to
[1:17:34] kill a man but they could never get
[1:17:36] close to him and everything was done
[1:17:38] so this man figured out if he could ever
[1:17:41] get something that the man they wanted
[1:17:42] to kill drank a lot of wine and they
[1:17:44] said if we could
[1:17:45] ever ever ever get something and they
[1:17:48] found a needle
[1:17:49] so small that they actually pushed it
[1:17:51] through the cork
[1:17:52] and injected the poison and pulled it
[1:17:55] out and the natural resonance of the
[1:17:57] court
[1:17:58] expanded back so that it was sealed and
[1:18:00] the wine never lost its
[1:18:02] i don't what did you call that it's it's
[1:18:03] a savor it's it's a
[1:18:05] flavor it's whatever and the man drank
[1:18:08] it and died
[1:18:09] you see my brother and sister satan
[1:18:10] would come and what he tries to do to
[1:18:12] you and i in our natural life and even
[1:18:14] in the church
[1:18:15] is just inject one little bit of poison
[1:18:19] he don't have to rip the cork out and
[1:18:21] pour some out and pour something back in
[1:18:23] he just injects just a little bit
[1:18:31] then what happens dead is dead
[1:18:37] incapacitated is incapacitated
[1:18:42] neither of those can claim to be alive
[1:18:53] deuteronomy 4 9
[1:18:59] only take heed to myself
[1:19:02] and keep thy soul diligently lest thou
[1:19:05] forget the things which thine eyes have
[1:19:07] seen
[1:19:08] and lest thy they depart from thy heart
[1:19:11] all the days of thy life but teach them
[1:19:14] thy sons
[1:19:15] and thy sons sons what is telling us
[1:19:19] take heed to thyself i don't care how
[1:19:22] much you hear the preacher
[1:19:23] and how revelated he is how much he is
[1:19:25] on the word of god
[1:19:27] my brother and sister you have to take
[1:19:29] heed to that
[1:19:30] because these are the things that you
[1:19:32] have to hold
[1:19:33] you have to look at that you have to
[1:19:35] know where you stand i don't care how
[1:19:37] revelated your pastor is i don't care
[1:19:39] how much
[1:19:40] that you respect that that is all good
[1:19:42] but you have to take heed
[1:19:44] you have to look at it yourself examine
[1:19:46] yourself take the word
[1:19:48] hold it up as a mirror
[1:19:51] lord how do i how do i fit in your word
[1:19:55] i don't want the word to be an image
[1:19:57] that i created
[1:20:02] amen i hope you catch the depth of that
[1:20:08] keep thy soul diligently
[1:20:11] you realize my brother and sister that
[1:20:13] right there is work
[1:20:15] in laodicea not his work
[1:20:19] you won't go a day you let it slip a day
[1:20:22] my brother and sister
[1:20:24] and the devil will be in there trying to
[1:20:26] wipe out your hard drive
[1:20:27] and inject something else on there to
[1:20:30] occupy
[1:20:31] your thoughts and everything amen
[1:20:35] so you look at that see he's still
[1:20:37] telling you right here lest thou forget
[1:20:39] the things
[1:20:40] not which we're told you catch that line
[1:20:43] not the things you were told not
[1:20:44] somebody else's experience
[1:20:46] but you can see these very things for
[1:20:48] yourself and we have made the statement
[1:20:50] i have made the statement
[1:20:51] once your eyes see you can never go back
[1:20:54] my brother and sister the word of god
[1:20:56] shows us you could see it
[1:20:58] and it could still just slowly fade away
[1:21:03] what happens life depleting
[1:21:08] not your revelation
[1:21:12] there's a man i won't go into enough
[1:21:13] detail for you to catch it but there's a
[1:21:15] man that i know
[1:21:16] made a wreck out of his family made a
[1:21:18] wreck out of his life made a wreck out
[1:21:19] of other people's lives
[1:21:21] and many years later he passed away and
[1:21:24] many years later a man
[1:21:25] that knew him as he had went back from
[1:21:28] the message preaching the message went
[1:21:30] back to being a drunk and going to the
[1:21:31] bars and the dance halls and whatever
[1:21:33] else
[1:21:33] and this man looked me in the face one
[1:21:35] day and says i never
[1:21:36] met a man who had a revelation of this
[1:21:39] message like him
[1:21:42] i remember the time i scoffed that there
[1:21:44] ain't no way what he did he had a
[1:21:45] revelation
[1:21:47] but you know the reality of it is he
[1:21:50] understood this message
[1:21:51] the nuance of it the in the out
[1:21:55] he could explain it probably as well as
[1:21:57] any man on the face of the earth
[1:21:59] but he forgot the things
[1:22:03] that his eyes had seen
[1:22:07] he had seen the moving of god he'd seen
[1:22:09] healing he'd seen delivered
[1:22:10] he saw all of that but he forgot it
[1:22:14] and the image that started to rise in
[1:22:17] front of him
[1:22:19] hallelujah i'm probably right at that
[1:22:21] age
[1:22:22] that's why sister jerry keeps a short
[1:22:24] lease on me
[1:22:25] i'm right at the age the other day i
[1:22:27] told her i said honey can i buy a dirt
[1:22:28] bike
[1:22:30] you know the reason i want a dirt bike
[1:22:32] because in the far recesses of my mind
[1:22:35] is the days when paul was 20 or 30 feet
[1:22:39] above the ground looking down
[1:22:40] this is so cool my adrenaline just
[1:22:45] and now it really hop a foot off the
[1:22:47] ground and
[1:22:52] but the image are you with me science i
[1:22:54] hope you
[1:22:55] just don't get caught up in that little
[1:22:56] story the image that's in my mind
[1:22:58] is of paul the 23 year old that just
[1:23:01] twisted the throttle wide open and just
[1:23:03] went
[1:23:05] solution to everything when in doubt
[1:23:07] gasset
[1:23:12] i can see paul now going out there
[1:23:16] pillow pillow pillow pillow pillow
[1:23:19] pillow
[1:23:21] [Music]
[1:23:22] wobble wobble woo
[1:23:29] but you see our mind will take us back
[1:23:31] into something
[1:23:32] and this man
[1:23:36] he started looking back and he started
[1:23:38] forgetting
[1:23:39] the things of god in another image of
[1:23:42] his youth when he was strong
[1:23:44] this is a man that in his older age
[1:23:47] looked at another young man that i know
[1:23:50] and told him you don't do it i tell you
[1:23:51] i'll whip you
[1:23:53] and that young man could pick up about
[1:23:55] 250
[1:23:56] 300 pounds knew how to box new karate or
[1:23:59] one of those things like that
[1:24:00] and this old man with a pot belly you
[1:24:02] don't do it i want to whip you
[1:24:04] what was it he had another image before
[1:24:07] him he had an image when he was a
[1:24:09] scrapper when he was a fighter
[1:24:10] and he told those stories so long
[1:24:14] he went back to those
[1:24:17] and it became so real to him saints i'm
[1:24:19] not condemning this man i want to paint
[1:24:21] a clear picture to you
[1:24:22] it became so real to him he started
[1:24:24] forgetting the things that he knew
[1:24:26] that god delivered him from the bottle
[1:24:27] god delivered him from a dance hall god
[1:24:29] delivered him from all these afflictions
[1:24:31] but that went away and another image
[1:24:34] rose up
[1:24:35] and he followed that image
[1:24:38] oh hallelujah are you with me amen
[1:24:42] oh it behooves us to look at ourselves
[1:24:45] oh i want to be out by now let's hurry

[1:27:40] you bear with me tonight i'm not
[1:27:42] out there looking towards the cross i've
[1:27:44] already realized who i am in jesus

[1:28:00] more than this flesh looking
[1:28:02] that's right to see who you are
[1:28:06] yes sir way more than this flesh looking
[1:28:10] to see who you are
[1:28:12] already in the presence of father we
[1:28:13] have a glorified body whoo
[1:28:16] even the prophet thought that was deep
[1:28:18] wasn't that deep
[1:28:19] all right we'll find out whether it's
[1:28:21] right or not if this earthly tabernacle
[1:28:23] be dissolved we'll have one
[1:28:25] already waiting is that right amen now
[1:28:28] look what he says here a little bit
[1:28:29] direct
[1:28:30] that's right so right now what we are
[1:28:33] there
[1:28:34] is a reflection here what we are
[1:28:37] here is a reflection of what we are
[1:28:40] somewhere else
[1:28:41] so if your deeds are evil you know where
[1:28:44] it comes from
[1:28:46] you know where your other body is
[1:28:49] waiting
[1:28:51] did you catch what the prophet of god
[1:28:52] said if your works are evil
[1:28:55] you know where your other body
[1:28:58] is now you go study this gyrus and
[1:29:01] divine healing read up from it read down
[1:29:04] from it amen
[1:29:05] you'll find that the prophet god is
[1:29:06] talking as sons and daughters of god
[1:29:08] we got a theophanic body amen it's
[1:29:11] waiting for us we know who we are
[1:29:13] we know what god's prepared for us and
[1:29:16] we're desiring and
[1:29:17] longing to receive that hallelujah
[1:29:21] oh my oh my i'll tell you what
[1:29:25] when i read that i was like wow that
[1:29:28] would offend a lot of people
[1:29:33] especially the ones that do brother
[1:29:36] deals
[1:29:38] it would offend him you're judging me
[1:29:41] brother paul
[1:29:43] no i'm sorry you judged yourself
[1:29:47] now in the sermon the harvest time
[1:29:50] brother branham uses reflection a bunch
[1:29:52] there but
[1:29:53] i knew that i kind of long-winded so i
[1:29:56] kind of pruned it down okay amen
[1:30:10] hmm
[1:30:13] it's all right brothers don't worry
[1:30:15] about it
[1:30:21] something's missing i'll just start with
[1:30:23] what i got on my screen
[1:30:25] and in that due date luke 17 20
[1:30:28] i believe it is jesus said when the son
[1:30:31] of man is being revealed
[1:30:32] not men the son of man not an
[1:30:35] organization the son of man
[1:30:37] the word living itself again
[1:30:40] among the people see the word itself
[1:30:44] made flesh in you
[1:30:49] there's people who don't believe that
[1:30:51] that's right oh i'm not talking about
[1:30:53] presbyterians or lutherans
[1:30:58] the word itself made flesh in you you
[1:31:02] are a reflection of this hour amen
[1:31:05] look what the prophet saying i hope you
[1:31:07] catch the depth of it we're not a
[1:31:08] reflection of pentecost
[1:31:10] we're not a reflection of the dark ages
[1:31:12] all of those attributes and all of those
[1:31:14] spirits of those
[1:31:15] ages we deal with them and we're going
[1:31:17] to overcome that
[1:31:18] but you see we're reflecting this out
[1:31:21] amen
[1:31:22] hallelujah we're not talking about an
[1:31:24] hour where the bride just decides well
[1:31:26] okay burn me at the stake i'll give my
[1:31:27] life
[1:31:28] nope my brother and sister this is the
[1:31:29] hour that life can be easy it can be
[1:31:32] cozy a good job a good house good family
[1:31:34] nice cars vacations and all of that
[1:31:36] stuff
[1:31:36] and you're still called to give your
[1:31:38] life
[1:31:40] but it's a different fashion now it's a
[1:31:42] battle against the comfort
[1:31:45] the feeling of the flesh intellectualism
[1:31:51] you are a reflection of this hour the
[1:31:53] message
[1:31:54] reflection of it see you live again
[1:31:58] live the life that was in jesus christ
[1:32:00] you're in the presence of the sun
[1:32:03] then to the what happened to it what
[1:32:06] happens to that church
[1:32:07] finally listen that shock pulls away
[1:32:10] from that wheat
[1:32:12] and when it begins to be manifested
[1:32:15] what happened the life that was in the
[1:32:17] shock went
[1:32:18] on out in the wheat the life won't
[1:32:21] change
[1:32:22] the carriers change they denominate see
[1:32:26] the blades the tassel the shock but the
[1:32:28] wheat can't change
[1:32:30] it's got to be a ministry just exactly
[1:32:33] on the word like he was on the word
[1:32:35] like the first church was on the word
[1:32:37] spirit filled
[1:32:39] word fed not denominational fed word fed
[1:32:43] i say amen to that hallelujah
[1:32:47] amen what is this because there is an
[1:32:50] image my brother and sister i hope this
[1:32:52] is not too simplistic but there is an
[1:32:54] image that we
[1:32:55] will follow and if we get caught up
[1:32:58] into the image we'll believe that
[1:33:00] because we go to a message church
[1:33:02] and so and so is our pastor and we have
[1:33:04] a friend here and we know this and we
[1:33:06] know that
[1:33:07] and we've been in the message for a
[1:33:08] certain amount of time that image raises
[1:33:10] up
[1:33:11] and we say we're message believers but
[1:33:13] the real message my brother and sister
[1:33:15] is jesus christ in you hallelujah now i
[1:33:19] want to put this right out to you as
[1:33:20] we're closing
[1:33:22] amen brother branham preaching seed is
[1:33:24] not air with the shot beautiful sermon
[1:33:26] amen but i want you to catch this now
[1:33:29] the shock
[1:33:31] has no reflection to the original seed
[1:33:35] that's right catch this the seed goes in
[1:33:38] the ground
[1:33:40] it sprouts it comes forth it's rising up
[1:33:43] and somebody look out in the field
[1:33:44] brother branham goes over and over again
[1:33:47] and seed is not here with the shock it
[1:33:48] goes up and it looks like there's wheat
[1:33:50] there but you go over there there's
[1:33:51] nothing there
[1:33:52] my brother and sister and people say
[1:33:53] well we have wheat we have we but you
[1:33:55] come
[1:33:56] and that shock is no reflection of that
[1:33:59] original seed that went in the ground
[1:34:01] the only reflection of the original seed
[1:34:04] is when
[1:34:05] that shock which is there as the carrier
[1:34:08] comes to maturity and it is for
[1:34:12] your day for your age you catch what the
[1:34:15] prophet saying
[1:34:16] we're not looking back to another day it
[1:34:18] has now come into maturity
[1:34:20] and the shark is there and it is not a
[1:34:23] reflection of the original seed
[1:34:25] it's only the carrier amen but when that
[1:34:28] comes to maturity
[1:34:30] and you shell that out you can go back
[1:34:32] and if you had
[1:34:33] as it were in the natural one of those
[1:34:35] seeds of wheat
[1:34:36] or corn whichever one you want to do
[1:34:38] because this scripture interprets it
[1:34:40] that way
[1:34:41] you can take that and what we have now
[1:34:43] is a perfect match
[1:34:45] to what went into the ground the
[1:34:47] original
[1:34:48] and that is what this message is doing
[1:34:50] not an image of the wheat
[1:34:52] as it is but the image of the seed amen
[1:34:55] that
[1:34:56] seed will be the perfect reflection of
[1:34:59] the original
[1:35:00] seed that went in the ground oh
[1:35:02] hallelujah i don't care if you have a
[1:35:04] thousand acres of wheat
[1:35:06] oh you have a thousand acres of wheat
[1:35:08] but there
[1:35:09] is nothing in that chuck
[1:35:13] you have nothing
[1:35:16] but did you know if you have one grain
[1:35:20] and you put it in the right soil this is
[1:35:23] why the old testament value of
[1:35:25] planting a church or coming into a
[1:35:27] community
[1:35:30] billy graham oral roberts all of them
[1:35:32] said we go in there
[1:35:33] we have all these converts we come back
[1:35:35] in a few months or a year and there's
[1:35:36] nothing there
[1:35:38] what did they do i know this sounds a
[1:35:40] little weird but just bear with me
[1:35:42] for the thought they planted a lot of
[1:35:44] shack seed
[1:35:48] the spirit of denomination but you take
[1:35:52] just one grain
[1:35:53] we've seen this the testimony villarreal
[1:35:56] paraguay
[1:35:59] brother had a comfy job
[1:36:03] kind of associated to his pastor his
[1:36:05] brother was a pastor their father had
[1:36:06] been a pastor until
[1:36:08] he passed away and he says you know i
[1:36:11] feel led to break away
[1:36:14] from this church and go down here to
[1:36:16] villarreal
[1:36:18] you know what lives in villarreal a
[1:36:20] bunch of poverty-stricken
[1:36:22] river rat labor people
[1:36:25] sister jerry's been in the sisters homes
[1:36:27] they're embarrassed they've got nothing
[1:36:30] nothing saints it should actually i i
[1:36:34] say this i'd be guilty as all of you so
[1:36:35] don't think i'm throwing stones at you
[1:36:37] it make us feel guilty you walk in there
[1:36:40] you feel guilty

[1:36:43] wall we have food here we have this we
[1:36:44] have dishes and we have furniture and we
[1:36:46] have
[1:36:47] and you go in there they sit down to a
[1:36:50] table
[1:36:50] on five gallon plastic buckets
[1:36:54] and apologize as that sister did to
[1:36:56] sister jerry i'm so sorry
[1:36:58] have nothing to offer you
[1:37:03] river rats laborers on the ships that
[1:37:06] ply the river
[1:37:09] but the word went to villarreal amen
[1:37:13] i wish i had the pictures they have a
[1:37:16] beautiful church now
[1:37:18] hundreds of believers
[1:37:21] because they didn't plant a shock
[1:37:24] they planted a seed
[1:37:28] oh saints god help us amen
[1:37:32] that we would be like the first church
[1:37:34] on the word spirit filled word
[1:37:36] fed not denominational fed word-fed
[1:37:40] hallelujah amen
[1:37:44] oh hallelujah
[1:37:49] my
[1:37:52] one more quote
[1:37:57] thank you god over us
[1:38:01] god with us
[1:38:05] somebody tell me what the next words say
[1:38:11] this message my brother and sister in
[1:38:12] the revelation associated did not stop
[1:38:15] when the prophet was called
[1:38:16] from the scene that seed was planted
[1:38:21] oh hallelujah i hope you're with me that
[1:38:23] seed was planted
[1:38:26] and that seed is going to bring forth
[1:38:29] a hundred fold it's not gonna bring 10
[1:38:32] 20 30 40. it's going to bring forth a
[1:38:34] hundred fold
[1:38:36] because it was the original seed now if
[1:38:38] any of you have ever read and it's just
[1:38:40] very public happened a few years ago
[1:38:42] they found some wheat seed
[1:38:44] in one of the pyramid and they gave that
[1:38:46] to some you know plant scientist guy
[1:38:48] and he created the perfect atmosphere
[1:38:50] for it and planted that seed
[1:38:52] and my brother and sister they don't
[1:38:54] even have a clue how old that seed is
[1:38:56] it popped to life and it grew and when
[1:38:58] it come to maturity
[1:38:59] without them doing one thing to it it
[1:39:01] put on this great big old head
[1:39:04] and the scientists like i wish we had
[1:39:05] wheat like this now
[1:39:09] why we'll just take it in this context
[1:39:12] original seed
[1:39:13] it's going to bring forth a hundredfold
[1:39:16] hallelujah not some watered-down
[1:39:18] religion not some concept
[1:39:20] of a myth of the message the original
[1:39:23] word
[1:39:24] amen god over us god with us now god in
[1:39:27] us
[1:39:27] all that god was this is the real part
[1:39:30] that just gets me bummed out
[1:39:34] i just almost cry when i think about
[1:39:36] this
[1:39:37] it's just so horrible all that god was
[1:39:42] he poured into christ
[1:39:46] and all that christ was he poured into
[1:39:49] you and i
[1:39:52] oh we hear the words and we just like
[1:39:54] yeah yeah yeah we're living underneath

[1:40:05] he brought life to the dead
[1:40:08] and he poured that into you and i
[1:40:12] but we're content i hope this don't
[1:40:14] offend you tonight but we're content to
[1:40:16] go home
[1:40:17] and say we're message believers and this
[1:40:20] is a different time

[1:40:32] father
[1:40:32] the father in me and i in you
[1:40:35] and this is the part that just really
[1:40:37] thrills me because it'd be like okay i
[1:40:38] got to see gene of god in me
[1:40:40] but what thrills me is i'm in him

[1:40:56] just somebody we're in him
[1:40:58] saints oh hallelujah
[1:41:01] so it's been god all along you see
[1:41:04] my from the moment i was born
[1:41:08] a little factual thought might be tmi
[1:41:11] forgive me
[1:41:13] my mama's for years i mean way way way
[1:41:16] before i ever ever
[1:41:18] started a minister my mom at one time
[1:41:21] just opened up and told me she says well
[1:41:22] son
[1:41:24] we determined we're going to have four
[1:41:25] children
[1:41:28] now you sisters that have struggled with
[1:41:30] these things i think you'll understand
[1:41:32] my mama said you know what your daddy
[1:41:34] and i made a decision we're gonna have
[1:41:35] four children
[1:41:40] obviously time previous to me
[1:41:43] my mom was carrying a baby girl
[1:41:51] and it dies
[1:41:56] heartbroken she thought
[1:42:00] oh two boys two girls this will be
[1:42:02] lovely
[1:42:04] that little girl dies
[1:42:12] my mama looked me in the face when i was
[1:42:14] actually pretty young not even serving
[1:42:16] the lord
[1:42:17] and she said when you were born i named
[1:42:19] you paul daniel
[1:42:21] and i told people my son will be a
[1:42:22] preacher
[1:42:27] my brother and sister i just hope those
[1:42:30] words are just family things right
[1:42:32] i don't make a big deal out of that but
[1:42:35] you see god
[1:42:36] as a program amen
[1:42:39] why my mom had that revelation i don't
[1:42:41] know how when where or why it come to
[1:42:43] her if she was grasping at straws or it
[1:42:45] was something that struck her in the
[1:42:46] soul
[1:42:48] but she went from grieving over that
[1:42:52] and she had a little baby boy i think my
[1:42:54] sister susan never
[1:42:55] forgave me
[1:42:59] she was looking forward to having a baby
[1:43:01] sister
[1:43:02] hallelujah and when i was a little kid
[1:43:04] she tried to dress me up in tutus and
[1:43:06] everything else
[1:43:09] but praise the lord
[1:43:12] you see it's been god all along you see
[1:43:17] the church is ordained it's not by
[1:43:20] chance saints
[1:43:21] sister emmy would you come the church is
[1:43:24] not
[1:43:25] by chance to carry on this work the
[1:43:27] church is ordained that's you and i
[1:43:29] you're ordained
[1:43:30] you are ordained of almighty god to
[1:43:33] carry on his work
[1:43:34] with the same spirit come on not a
[1:43:38] denominational spirit
[1:43:39] not a haughty spirit not a whatever
[1:43:42] spirit not a depressed spirit
[1:43:45] the same spirit you could carry on the
[1:43:48] same work without the same spirit
[1:43:51] now i'm gonna i'm gonna drop my little
[1:43:52] nuclear device
[1:43:54] there's way too many people packing this
[1:43:56] message around and i don't say this
[1:43:57] judgmental it's the word of god
[1:43:59] i'll stand on it till the sun comes up
[1:44:01] or goes down
[1:44:02] it's too many people carrying the word
[1:44:04] of god
[1:44:06] and they have the wrong spirit they're
[1:44:08] building kingdoms on earth
[1:44:10] everything or i i'm speaking hard my
[1:44:13] brother and sister i know that
[1:44:15] but i just want you to reflect on this
[1:44:17] the very things the prophet of god said
[1:44:19] was not to be big churches fancy
[1:44:22] churches
[1:44:23] wealth of the all of these things and
[1:44:25] it's popping up in our midst
[1:44:28] but you see we can't carry on the same
[1:44:30] work without the same spirit
[1:44:32] that's right the same spirit carries on

[1:45:01] somebody who thinks he's better than
[1:45:02] anyone else
