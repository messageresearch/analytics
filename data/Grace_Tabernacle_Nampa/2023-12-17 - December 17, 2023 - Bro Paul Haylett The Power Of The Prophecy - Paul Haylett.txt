my brother manasse God bless you my friend and your guest or visitor God bless you today hope you enjoy yourself to each and every one of you that's here sisters brothers and sisters I I think as a a body of Believers we're all just family right and that's how we identify amen sometimes it's just a you might say a unfamiliar face in the family but it's still our family and we thank God for that you know I just want to just you may be seated for just a moment have a couple things I need to just want to share with you and uh uh so on this I just want you to please another one of those brother Tim I forgot to mention to you uh brother Ron Peterson I sat with him in the hospital uh a few days ago and brother Ron was all raring to go home and uh he got out of the hospital got home and ended up right back in the hospital again so definitely remember him and you know brother Ron is is you know uh I I don't know how to say it really really politely um feisty and he was just sure he felt good but you know the thing is is when we get so weak get so run down and um he just he was more run down than he realized but he wasn't resting in the hospital he wanted to go home and rest he he told me he said you know uh that it it was just real stressful for him being there he hadn't slept um he said he you know just had a lot of things that were kind of Weighing on him things he felt like as a pastor he needed to be out and take care of uh um but the brothers um becoming maybe a little more bold you know brother Ron you've got to get your health back you've got to get up in strength and uh so um the Lord blessed our time um when brother Ron uh called asked me to take the last Sunday service there um uh he he sounded very very rough and so we certainly want to see that and got to the church and you know find out that most of the ministers in the church were sick also so amen I kind of joked with the church there that I I was just a substitute The Last Resort but it was good to be there and uh you know speaking of things we need to remember uh and and happy to announce um I uh set just a moment with sister Rebecca page brother Ron's daughter and uh talked to her right at the very end of the service on Sunday and uh she was very very happy to declare one that God loved her woed her right back into the fold praise the Lord and she's cancer [Applause] free yeah absolutely you know a treatment at one time time they're saying you know uh we just don't know if this is even going to affect it we don't know what we can do for you you need to kind of maybe settle things and get it right and you know we would like sometimes to say well the doctors just don't know but let me apply just a little different application maybe sometimes we need to hear those words because of cause and effect right right so God speaks through doctors he speaks through all these things and sometimes we like to think oh that's just a negative thing but sometimes maybe God is just giving us a little inspiration to deal with things and uh so certainly we just um vary something very much upon my heart having just come home from Phoenix um let us be faithful to pray for our unsaved children that's right abely um you know the old phrase we just love them to death but what we want to do is love them to life and we want to amen we want to make a difference you know lovely time that sister Jerry and I had in Arizona and uh you know sometimes you just kind of think oh my oh my but there's an inspiration comes with this that's you can make a difference amen miles mean nothing continents mean nothing we can make a difference amen amen Prayer Changes Things Hallelujah um just want to give you a little update on some missions thing that the things that the church is supporting we have been supporting recently some work in northern Europe um uh a new body of Believers rising up uh work there sometimes people think well is there really anything changing are we just I heard a brother one time say well it seems like we're just recirculating believers they move from here to there that that there rejoices there's new new Believers in the church and where went from uh would be saying oh we wish they hadn't left but you know God's still working and and right there in northern Europe um in the country of Lithuania uh the word of God coming into the hands of a pastor and um he believed the message he shares it with his church and the church says that's the truth they see baptism they see what God's doing and and they rise up and and um uh you know just just very incredible to see how these things come to pass a whole a whole group some leave amen we pray for them but you know to see a whole group because you see this is the end time amen and um so there in northern Europe we see little work that we're supporting there uh uh brother brother behind that I don't guess it'd be out of line to to speak out uh brother valali was here with us this last summer brother Vitali is very instrumental and uh some of that work there in the country of Lithuania and remember them weren't they weren't they wonderful people to be with they were just incredible and um we have been supporting to a fairly large amount uh uh recently within the last couple weeks to Venezuela uh inflation in Venezuela has reduced everything to the very very bare necessity uh you know Saints if it could put it in a context how would you feel if you went in a grocery store and there wasn't a single tube of toothpaste but if there was a tube of toothpaste it would cost you 2530 $35 and so this is what's happening to to Christians in Venezuela uh that old communist spirit is just is Desiring to crush the church but just as it was in the Dark Ages everything that Satan can throw at uh uh Christians at real Believers my brother and sister they might drive the message underground they can't kill it no amen so it's there that we see that and we've just also recently supported some work uh through our brother David Nash in Honduras and um none of these are are so significant that we could boast but we want to make a difference amen and um by God's grace we will make a difference and so I want to also say thank you to the brothers on their landscape project I don't know if you noticed or not but it looks much nicer if you didn't notice on your way in um I have a very good eye doctor uh but um it it's it's coming along things looking much better now concerning Christmas uh Christmas Eve we will be having Sunday morning service just like always on Christmas Eve uh New Year's uh Eve will have morning service and uh in the evening time somewhere around 6 o' if you want to come here at the church around 6 o'clock we don't want to get all carried away but around 6 o'clock we can have some fellowship time and then 7:15 7:30ish we want want to go into songs and worship and uh following that at a reasonable time in the evening uh uh we will have communion now I I don't know pastors should never be selfish but I'm getting on a plane the next morning and spending I don't know 12 hours or something flying so I won't be here at midnight if you plan on being here at midnight but um at what point we'll have communion at a reasonable time in the evening and uh after that we will uh dismiss and allow you to to uh spend the rest of the evening as you would so wish amen does that sound good Saints amen so anyway I believe we've covered all of those things um and um so let's just rise and we'll just go into the word tonight uh today it feels like night I got up so early this morning I I thought we're still operating at night but um anyway it's good sometimes you know you know the the world acknowledges you know of what happens in the night but let's not forget the Holy Spirit also moves at night oh yeah so you don't have to be standing in the light of day to have the Holy Spirit speak to you amen so meet him amen Saints meet him where he chooses to meet you amen be open amen amen God bless you brother William and uh so Revelations 10 starting with verse 7 going through 11 amen there's something else is still nagging on the back of my mind I know I wanted to share but I have forgotten so um if I remember I'll bring it up re Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and we know who that Angel is amen and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey amen and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings Heavenly Father we thank you for your word today we thank you for everyone that is here father Lord that we just desire for you to speak to our hearts Lord by your strength father We Exist Lord by Your Word father we are able to live and Lord we want to live in the full Vitality of the life Lord that you have promised to the believer Lord we ask you just to speak through these words today may we be able to take them home anchored in our hearts to know father that your grace is sufficient and your word is fulfilled amen Lord we thank you bless this time in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen so as we'll look here today amen uh just a little reminder for those maybe you can just um just a little pat on the back or a present or well-wishing or whatever sister Gabriella is coming of age and we'll just wait another a year or two and ask her how that's working out you know so we're speaking to young adults you see there's something you know when you're a little kid it's like Dad I want to go with you I want to go work I want to help you at 14 they're like what are you doing at 18 I'm busy and U that's the metamorphosis of life right and so we thank the Lord for that amen Revelations it says in verse 7 mystery of God should be finished now my brother and sister this word should is not used in the context that we typically would use it you know I should which means that there is some kind of motivation there of what should be taken care of but I should do this or I should do that but my brother and sister in this context this word should is in essence saying will be that's it it is done it is finished amen so it says that the mystery of God will be finished and uh so I I say that we should have confidence right because the word cannot fail and if we can't have confidence in the word then we are going to be in a very world of hurt because every promise in the book we don't know whether it'll come to pass or not amen I stand here before you today and there's many in our midst today that have afflictions in your flesh that you would like to be healed from can we say amen and it's there in that that we would say well using the word should like we we often use it um you know the word says I would be healed or I I should be healed or there's a possibility of me being healed and the devil will get into the comment section in your mind and pretty soon you'll be saying well it must not be God's will for me to be healed because I've been praying and I'm still sick or I still have this Affliction but I want you to understand he said by his stripes ye are healed it is a finished statement it's not something to do now my brother and sister what God chooses or allows or brings about in our life my brother and sister that's not for us to measure otherwise we'll start to question every single thing in our life and say well I thought God said and then we will come to a place that we'll go and become agnostics and then from there we'll become atheists and we've seen this happen over and over again we're not just speaking in some kind of uh almost threatening manner like this is what will happen but we're seeing a pattern amen so just trust the word trust God Amen and so it says here that uh he would be now this mystery my brother and sister we can go I preached a little bit of this last THS uh last Sunday I mean in in Phoenix but I preached that because it was on my heart here and and it just come to pass in that sense to express some of that there you see we could take mystery and make it kind of a ooh kind of thing you know like oh um mystery but my brother and sister you see what this is is God is telling us something that was hid from us is being revealed or not going to be revealed but it is revealed but yet we don't see it all that's right are you with me this morning so we could sit here and say the very mystery of God has been revealed to us but I could not stand here today and say I see it all it is still unfolding but as the word said it's been revealed the work has been finished I'm here to say amen amen just like I believe without a Shadow of Doubt my brother and sister the prophet of God said that rapturing faith is already in you I'm here to say it's already in me amen God is bringing this rapturing Faith to the surface now you know some people would say but I'm struggling on that well I'll tell you my brother and sister just as the grass that grew in the crack of the sidewalk had to struggle so will you as Sons and Daughters of God in your Christian experience have times of struggle they'll have times the devil will try to tell you what you believe is not the word that it's not right or you didn't understand it correctly what we want to do is sit back and say he said it and I believe it and it's coming to pass amen I'm pressing to the sun amen so it is uh for a mystery to really be finished my brother and sister you and I must recognize who it is that spoke it that's it cuz we can say the Mysteries revealed but if we have a question of how it was spoken to who it was spoken then you will sit here and over time you'll put it on a shelf which is not a bad idea but if you forget it's on the Shelf my brother and sister that is a bad idea other words we can put the things completely out of our life and then never look at it again and always wonder why did it not come to pass well it is there that we we understand that you must be a participant right at the Finish that's right as brother George says you run your race I'll run my race I'll meet you at the finish line but let me put it this way as a pastor to you I want to run this race with you that's right I don't want to be completely off on my own running a race I want to run this race with you as a body of Believers I believe God has put us together together and I want to run the race with you and sometimes in the race no doubt you saw the little video before I don't know a marathon or something and the man comes down he's hurting there's a little curve at the Finish Line he gets confused and he standing there dazed he's not here to the back of the church from the finish line and here comes the next contestant that is running in this race and he rounds the corner he understands where the finish line is could easily have passed that man and went on to receive the accolades of winning the race but the world was in awe that he stopped and started escorting this man hobbling to the Finish Line This is a true story hobble to the finish line and when he gets that one step from the Finish Line he stops and the man is so dehydrated he's confused and it's there that he realizes he still doesn't understand he pushes him across the Finish Line that's what I want us to be that's what I want us as Christians to be that's it not to run off and say well they have to make it on their own but to have enough grace and mercy that Jesus displayed in us to come and say my brother my sister we're at the Finish Line keep pressing on keep walking keep claiming amen and it will come to pass that's right they L later asked that man I have to share this part it always amazed me they said that's racing if a man's not able to finish the race that that's fine to pass him no shame in that and he said but I want you to know they said why didn't you and he said I want you to know my mother was watching this race and she would have been ashamed of me isin't that compelling oh let us live up to a Godly mother's expectation amen hallelujah so there's always two classes right we see it all through scripture two Vines two Spirits it's it's all through scripture you can see it can and able bring it right on down we won't spend a lot of time on that but just bring it right on down my brother and sister and the word says that in our day amen that the wheat and the tears would be separated and some people my brother and sister this is just a little farming fact we have to be careful how we interpret that because you see it's not always that the the I had a brother just mentioned this to me recently he said well now brother the wheat and the tears how are we going to separate those or how's that going to happen but I want you to understand that the Shu that surrounds the wheat is also considered tear exactly right so there's going to come a separation time it doesn't mean there's a weed growing in the midst it doesn't mean that there's all kinds of Thistle and kosa and L quarter and all these things to be separated out it could be us being simply separated from our self coming to A A Place in our life that self no longer controls our destiny that self no longer regulates our fa faith that self no longer is our limiting factor but we can come to a place that God pulling the very life that's right that's for the life at a season was in the shock that's right was in that that we might call Terror today amen always two classes there's always been two Natures yes sir there's always been two results that's right absolutely as we look here I've been studying a little influence of this come uh as I said in our time in Arizona in a revelation book of symbols it said and the world is groaning waiting today and I want to ask you just I think we're all reasonable uh uh knowledgeable people here today is this world groaning or what yes it's happening again my brother and sister not one place on Earth that's not groaning that's right our sister April went over into the I don't know what would you call it southeast Asia and that's all the further we'll go in detail she went over there and dealing with people that have been dealt harshly with people that diseases we wouldn't think twice about kills them people with infections become so inflamed and so whatever that ultimately it takes their lives and and we see that and and there's trouble there the scripture says that there'd be war on every hand and we'd hear of wars and rumors of wars and then we see these things taking place and we'll find my brother and sister that we we've got the issue of Russia and Ukraine but it's not just just an issue of Russia and Ukraine my brother and sister that issue has penetrated the world that's right and it's not just an issue of Palestinians and Israelis it's not an issue just of gaua my brother and sister this is scripture being fulfilled this is not just issues my brother and sister that we can say it's that man's fault or it's that man's fault that country's fault or that country's fault but we're talking about spiritual warfare principalities and powers of Darkness pressing in and if you think all of that is chaos you just look at what Satan is doing in the world today and I'm not going to speak negative today but I will say this we are seeing church after church compromise their belief on the word of God and then you see very directly following that the consequence of the compromise if it was just simply Army against Army we could solve those things but spiritual warfare is what pushes this right and prophecy said it would come to pass you can fight against it but you won't change the prophecy that's right he said the world is groaning waiting today people don't know the mystery of God that's right they've not been taught the mystery of God the only thing they've been taught join Church put your name on a book be a good fellow treat your neighbor right that's all right but you must know the mystery of God hallelujah must know the mystery of God no man can reveal it to you but the one that had the book amen the one that come and offered up the book is the only one that can make this mystery of the word of God real to you we can join a church we can go to classes we can go to all kinds of things I get all kinds of little postcards and little texts and whatever come to our Revelation series or come to our deal of this come to that we'll explain to you what God is doing well I'm here to tell you God already explained it amen we don't have to find a man that's got the idea God himself come down amen amen that's right the Bible said no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost you know that's a hard one for some people to digest because they believe that they've been faithful they've been faithful to do good deeds you know I don't want to sound like I'm boasting but you know I I felt like calling brother Adrien here a few days ago where in a a parking lot of a store turned out a little Romanian lady and I I believe that it was sincere I believe she told us the truth I didn't I didn't really feel not like I'm some kind of guy Iger counter to judge this but she was sincere she said I said we'll go in the store I'll buy you groceries she's like sir in her broken English she said sir I have food but food won't matter if they kick me out of my house you don't drink never you don't smoke no and I just grilled her I I probably I kind of felt like I was being a little hard on this little lady and I tell you it humbled me so much and this is why I'm sharing it I finally felt like not often I have money like this in my wallet but I had a 20 I had a 50 and I had a $100 bill I first off I was going to hand her a 20 and I was like yeah 20 will go a long ways my goodness a loaf of bread and some peanut butter and you've spent $20 and I thought well 50 might make a difference and something spoke to me and we can let emotion and these kind of things rule us but something spoke to me and said if this is my child and I just pulled a $100 bill out and I gave it to her and the results my brother and sisters what I want to share to you she starts crying she's so thankful she grabs my hand pulls it to her face and starts kissing my hand and I'm kind of like uh uh I'll tell you this my wife's never even done that and her little boy the same thing one to hug me one to shake fist bump then a h then handshake and then he just grabs me and hugs me and as I go to put my arms around him he grabs my hand and starts kissing at and he's saying thank you thank you God bless you God bless you God bless you now what they do with the money my brother and sister is between them and God but I tell you what I want to be faithful to do my part that's it amen and after we left a little later I thought you know I had a little more money in my wallet maybe I should have gave it to her I don't know but I want to make a difference I want to be a light that shines I don't want to be the the skeptic that's always if she lied to me that's between her and God that's right that's exactly but you know we could just defy not helping anyone even people in our own church yeah that's right yes no man can reveal it to you but the one that had the book no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost I tell you today my brother and sister I believe we stand here in a position of confidence but I want to tell you today I want to be able to call him the Christ I want to be able to declare who he is and not have a question mark of when where why how that means our positions got to be correct before we can judge their position that's right before we can act on anything we must be in the right place ourself exactly right this grand old Holy Ghost Church is going to come out one of these days and shine like you've never seen amen you know what I believe I believe all you got problems I believe your problems hinder you absolutely because we're looking at our problem that's it that's exactly right why don't we look at who God said we were amen and why don't we come out with confidence and shine like we have never shown before why don't we stand up and say Lord let me be a light in the darkness like I've never been a light in my life I want to be a light today lordu I don't want to look back some glorious time years or whatever ago I want it to shine today amen amen now I want to move forward here in this you know in Revelations 10:7 and on through the scripture there that utterance my brother and sister if you look at that very closely Amen brother Gideon take us back to the scripture please and you look at this this utter utterance my brother and sister is not actually a request he didn't say do this if you feel like it the voice I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go yeah amen but he didn't just point us off into wherever I'm wandering around I'm just doing what God said I'm going I'm going I'm going no he said go and then he gives direction to us can we say today God's word always gives Direction it never just sends us out on a loose errand to run here and run there running to and fro but he always always gives us Direction but if we never obey the Commandment in the beginning my brother and sister it won't matter what direction he tells you to go we got to listen to him he said go and take the little book that I'll open when I give it to you it's already open amen amen amen amen it astounds me that within the confines of the message people will argue whether the book is open or not they will argue my brother and sister if it's open it means this and this and this and this I'm telling you the word said the book is open I believe the word the book is open amen that's right and it wasn't just anybody that brought it it was open in the hand of the Angel amen which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth that's right nothing less than our Lord Jesus Christ amen he's the one that delivered the book that's right people will argue oh I heard this just the other day well so and so preached this in in the year 1888 or whatever in such and such church that's nothing new it doesn't change the fact of who delivered the book amen they're looking for an excuse to not have to act upon the book to put the book on the sh to be able to say that didn't apply to me it's not finished it's not done it's not that season but my brother and sister it wasn't Wigglesworth and it wasn't brandom that's right if you pardon me for putting it that blunt amen it was God himself he's the one that offered the open book and let me go back and correct that brother brandom I don't want to sound disrespectful Smith Wigglesworth amen don't want to be disrespectful I didn't mean it that way but you look at this my brother and sister regardless of what these men preach it's God Amen it's not us amen any man that would stand up and say this is my Revelation run now look at this how it is it's a command but this command will only be uh uh heed by a special class of people that's right I mean I'll just put it real simple that's right amen absolutely right and if you don't think so I won't name the denomination but I'll tell you right now watched a video the other day of a minister very well recognized minister in a denomination actually sitting there in his nice finally ornate office and talking about there certain passages of scripture he's not sure he can accept this is where it's heading and it's hard to go against the stream but I'm going to go against the stream amen God said it I believe it that's amen hallelujah so improbable amen I'll tell you my brother and sister if there's a need for water to run uphill God will provide that absolutely you would say it's scientifically impossible I don't care what science says if God said it was going to happen it it happen amen amen oh I could there's so many examples I could get lost in them amen so he says you know uh uh I say you know it's got to be a special class of people actually that's not my words but go and take the book okay I'm going to get up out of the chair or whatever it is and I'm going to go and I got tired before I got to the book I got distracted before I got to the book but I really want to accept or have everything that's in the book I I want to claim everything that's in the book my brother and sister no that won't work he said go so you can start the journey but you better get your hands on the book amen but if you get your hands on the book it will not be by man's interpretation of what the book says it has to be of God Amen so my point being first to worry about the Revelation you've got to have the book the book that's right amen amen I've been doing quite a bit of what you might consider to be strange studying the prophetess Luella says that God come to her the other night and revealed the end time to her this sound harsh the 's Revelation won't even fit inside the fly leaf that's right of this scripture that's she has a few hundred, followers does that make it truth no absolutely because it's popular because it seems to fit no cuz I tell you what happens my brother and sister when you get the book now the prophet of God says you can't interpret this book no human can interpret this book Only God Can interpret this book so you got to take the book you got to get it in possession possession is not merely to put it on a shelf right or even in your physical hand that's right absolutely right possession is ownership that's it amen absolutely now I'm going to take this I hope you follow me can I say I own this book yes sir yeah I believe I can but to take it with the prophet of God said if you don't mind not cter addicting you or I I can have ownership of this book but the prophet of God says you don't have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has you so this book I don't possess this book this book possesses me hallelujah amen now I'm going to just throw something at you I hope that I'm not too distractive on this but when I was in in Arizona I have to say that I felt like it was of the Lord and my eyes were just open to something and I'll just very briefly share it to you we've talked about reading between the lines many times right and the prophet of God even talks about that reading between the lines that you can see what others won't see because God opens that up but God opened my eyes to this I don't make no big deal out of it but I just believe it is true and we've always had this idea that we took the word of God now if I can just Express this as there being offence that we are passing through now we have the idea that we opened up the word and looked beyond the other side of the word and read between the lines to see what that was that would be you and I doing something but the truth of it is is the word opened up and reached out and Drug you and I into the word and said look at it from my point of view don't look at it from your point of view look at it it from my point of view and we'll stand here in the best of our English to describe it and say praise God I was reading between the lines well let's get that right you're reading between the lines cuz God opened it up and God pulled you into the word and you are reading it with new understanding with new revelation nothing we have done but all that he has done and people say well that's not the way our church sees it that's fine I'm fine I'm not going to contest with you or even be critical of you because unless God opens it up none of us understand it but God said I will I will reveal this word to My Chosen People amen hallelujah hallelujah nothing to be embarrassed about reading between them lines cuz I'll tell you what it is God got a hold to you brought it in and you got to look at it from God's point of view that's what we've been striving for that's what we long for right amen amen amen you see the recognition the real revelation of this you know we have an identity crisis in the Christian world yes sir we got people that say they got saved but nothing ever changed in their life they're still just the same old person we got people that say I see the message but nothing ever changed in that person's life my brother and sister so we have this identity crisis but I tell you what when you ever once come to the place that you see yourself in the word you'll never be the same now let me throw the the the the the the curve ball at you if it was just us seeing the word everything I spoke to you a few minutes ago is is contradicted that's right but us seeing oursel in the Word was God reaching out and pulling you in an eye into the word amen and it was there we're standing face to face with Jesus Christ in the word amen it's no longer what we are but it's what he is it's no longer what we've done but it's what he has done and we can then with confidence say I've been Beyond the Veil I've been in his presence he's spoken to me he has revealed himself to me no longer what we have done that's exactly Hallelujah but we come to a recognition this book and just pardon me I'll keep it simple for time's sake this book is my book that's right and I read it and I am a new creature in Christ Jesus amen you might read it just a little different than I do reminds me of brother won't allow anyone in the Pulpit song leader Deacon anyone without wearing a white shirt let's do a little poll today you know brother Caleb you're going to have to come finish the service buddy how do we want to interpret it our side looking in or Christ's side looking out that's ex right well let's take it other ways yeah we'll skip that one now in the seventh Church age revelation of Jesus Christ this is a familiar quote to you you'll recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself amen can someone tell me what the difference is between actual and factual some of you have been to college I found High School too hard so you'd say maybe Webster might disagree with you but did you know you can have all the facts and still not get it right that's exactly brother Manassa just this strikes me you studied some of that criminal justice you can have all the facts and miss miss it yeah body on sidewalk Bullet Hole yeah EXA right only to find out later that the bullet come from four blocks away and was a gunfight between gangsters down there nobody snuck up and shot the man but we'd think it's it's murder and we got to find Footprints and fingerprints and this and this and this so we can have facts but it not be actual that's it is the actual right not factual people say Jesus died for us but it's not really actual to them it's just a fact amen that's right I don't want to be labor that that's good revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages we are the future age then I mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it amen yeah bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study or thinking to make this book real right it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but oh my goodness you guys are so arrogant you guys are so no praise God that should bring joy in our hearts not separation the whole world should say praise God I'm that special class amen but instead they want to argue our view your view this view that view or even cadi themselves with their own view that happens can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people who take one with prophetic Insight now look at this my brother and sister I want you to understand I don't remember if I even expressed What My Title of my sermon was today did I uh I don't know you know the power of Prophecy amen but the power of Prophecy my my brother and sister is only relevant if the prophecy comes to pass right lots of prophecies that have been given in fact let's see I believe it was May 31st of this year the Rapture was supposed to take place that man has a monster church with thousands of people that follow him what happens sweep it under the carpet well brother Trevor it didn't happen because you were supposed to be sitting 6 in further down the Pew glad of that no my brother and sister nonsense amen going to take the operation of the holy spirit because it can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it'll take one with prophetic Insight did you know as a Christian you were born with a prophetic Insight that you could look at the word of God and that word speaks to you you don't have to pry it open you don't have to tear it apart you don't have to go learn Greek or or Hebrew or Arabic to make it come to life to you because you were born with this prophetic insight to look in the word amen or should I say look out from the word amen no you guys are with me amen it will require the ability to hear from God it would require Supernatural let me go back to the ability to hear from God my brother and sister if whatever voice is speaking to us doesn't come right out of this word it wasn't from God period I don't care who they are right how much Tick Tock and whatever you know I don't care how many followers they got what channels they've got none of that stuff if it doesn't come out of the word my brother and sister it didn't come from God right amen it would require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good reminds me of a deal I read recently this lady posted a deal why I quit Bible study and the title of it caught me so much I was like now why would somebody commit or uh quit Bible studying so I listened to her little deal I don't know if what you'd call it wasn't really a video it's just a voice podcast is that what you'd call that and she gives all this rambling stuff that made absolutely no sense and I'm as I'm listening to it I'm thinking well it's no wonder you didn't get anything out of Bible study but then right at the end it threw out the very Crux she said I quit because I was more confused at the end than I was at the beginning would that be the word of God to the bride of Christ no no this mystery has been revealed it didn't bring confusion it brought Clarity amen so when you start to put my idea and your idea and their idea and the school's idea and the theology idea and everything in there it ends up more confusing than it started we got seven ages of clutter that's been dumped into the gospel I'll mind my business because I I I just should I should I was just going to tell you about something else I just read quite interesting but her mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear that's it that's it you can read a verse in your Bible a thousand times if God doesn't open that to you it's the same words on the same page on number 1,000 as it was on number one how we need to hear from God and lay oh oh oh oh oh do you know lay yourselves open is just as important as take the book that's right that's right that's right that's right yeah got to be open to receive it that's right I've got the book praise God but I I don't think it fits our day it don't understand our day no it prophesied your day what do you mean it don't understand your day it prophesied your day amen it knows your day in detail how we need to hear from God lay ourselves open become yielded to the spirit to hear and know are we doing okay Saints amen okay amen you know how it is uh sometimes you just have so much we'll skip over some of that right there now let's look at this here is John laying the foundation for us now I can tell you my brother and sister that some would say in the competition I don't understand why they would be this maybe it's whatever uh Bible school they went to you know and they have to come up with something unique that nobody else has but you know some of these people being taught theology believe there was actually almost a competition and they believe it's reflected in the gospels because of this competition between the apostles and um so you you know you look at that um I I can see how that would happen you know God spoke to the Apostle Paul Apostle Paul comes and starts correcting yeah and they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa that's not how we see it but the Apostle Paul didn't say well let's sit down and compromise this he said look I was on the back side of the desert and God come to me and spoke and this is what it is you need to sit down and be silent wow how many of would accept that not many not many would accept that but to come with authority right to be able to come with authority and say this is what God spoke amen now look how this comes that in a different context because of different Natures but remember John come out of the Wilderness and they thought he was a wild man right right so here is John now well we'll we'll move on from the Apostle Paul but look now John is laying a foundation look Revelation my brother and sister is you might say the culmination of everything put together and and I I I took some quotes out a a revelation book of symbols here we'll read that in a minute but you see John is now coming and he is showing us he's laying a foundation that you would say well may maybe Apostle Paul would have said it different but it doesn't matter how the Apostle Paul would have said it it's whether or not they doed him that's it let me give you an example I thought this was so humorous out of a book I read recently somebody said what about this and that and he said well I'll tell you this it ain't up can you interpret that anybody he could have said it's down but he said it ain't up but he said the same thing did he not it's not up it's down or vice versa was he wrong different way to say it but he's whole truth now Paul's laying this Foundation exactly and this is what I really want to get to exactly as he received it amen now the ministry that God gave to the Apostle Paul became a very much a foundation of the New Testament but my brother and sister as it is we have this commonality and that is what Paul received he didn't doctor it he passed it on and as John has received this from the one who is standing on the land and on the sea he received this he doesn't doctor it he passes it right on amen he gave a proper response they said take the book amen so he come what would be the proper response if God told you today in a literal voice to you take the book what would you say give me the book that's right you know why you're sitting here today because he told you to take the book amen and you said give me the book amen amen that's right and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took I can say Amen to that well isn't that how you read it come on yeah come on I don't care how you how you look at the the page you going to be saying I that's what John said when you read it you're reading and I took the book am amen so if you just read that in sincerity you're testifying to the Lord I want the book amen or you can just read it like a novel I read my Bible and I read a sister fense story I didn't see any difference well I'm sorry you didn't really take the book you just had book give me the book but you know there's Bibles everywhere do you know the Bible is still on the bestselling list of books in the world look it up it waivers up and down you know there's been different books that that come but pretty much the Bible dominates as the most published book on the face of the Earth there ought not be a heathen one anywhere in the world but having the book and eating the book it's too different that's exactly right amen amen wait till you have a friend one day that looks at you and says you take the Bible too literal Paul guilty guilty it's a book of suggestions a book of ideas okay you're right let me change my vocabulary and God suggested that Paul take the book yeah that's a suggestion I want to follow and he also suggested that I eat the book that's right okay I don't care how technical you want to be on your langage my brother and sister because it all comes the beauty of the word is to the hearer and the critics are always right just ask them amen Bible's everywhere no value if we don't eat it now this should be read real personal really because you see it's Christ the word speaking to you and how do you respond right M exactly right give me the book amen would you agree with me today he gave you the book absolutely right absolutely lives are changed that's it our world has become completely different that's right people with behavior issues you realize how broad that is behavior issues changed amen as one Minister puts it some of you sitting here today we prison bait and some of us would had to have said that might well be us amen and we met a brother back East amen you know has to do with the prison system my brother and sister when he tells you starts sharing little things to do with the prison and you think is being a Christian difficult at times let's embrace it I ask you a question I want an answer is being a Christian difficult at times just go visit a prison and you'll think that whatever you face as a Christian it's just going to be nothing compared and that's just natural right as it were right so if being a Christian can be difficult my brother and sister let's look at this let me hurry along here so you get you ask you know he ask you he you say give me the book he gives you the book and we're being obedient right now the words right here before you Saints he told you when you eat this book can anybody answer [Music] the pain here is not bitter enough the sweetness is greater that's it amen and we keep right on Amen eating the book [Music] Hallelujah I know none of you have ever done it but you eat something it's so good you go back and eat some more and then you go get it out of the fridge and you eat some more then you eat some more then you got a belly ache yeah are you guys normal yeah normal okay you've done it okay see what happened the book is so sweet how beautiful the book is so [Music] sweet but the bitter that's it is this word that's it bringing your flesh that's it into subjection exactly right amen that's the bitter part that's right amen that's why they coined the phrase God understands I'm not going to eat the book because I don't want to deal with the bitterness but God understands no God understands when you say give me the book that's right give me the book and you said eat I'm going to eat that's what God understands he doesn't understand our convoluted view of Christianity wants people that want the book and you know it's going to be bit cuz you know it causes a body change that's it those who believe in a Rapture are looking for a body change what they're not looking for it is to happen today they want to take place in a Rapture amen but if this body doesn't change here it won't be in a Rapture so here's the body changing the bitterness of eating the book is causing us oh I just come across studying this message I won't go into detail but I just come across something that struck me I sat in my office in the wee hours of the morning crying Lord help me amen help me Lord I've got to fulfill this it's not I want to I've got to Lord amen amen the bitterness coming back affecting our life and you know what will happen we'll change amen we're not going to find an excuse we're going to change we're going to move into this sture of a perfect man we're going to move into this position God has called us to yes amen that's right but let me tell you before we close here about the honey of the word coming to us it's so sweet how do you counteract the bitter by eating more book that's it seems like a paradox doesn't it how do I deal with the conflict in my life keep eating that's right how do I get rid of this bitterness down at my belly keep eating that's right amen keep the word in your thoughts amen keep the word in your lips that's it speak it amen confess it sing of it amen give praise for it that's right Amen Let the sweetness of the word be with you every day cuz I tell you my brother and sister you know I used to be definitely a qualified overeater is that a is that a title who are you an overeater and I would eat so much ice cream I'd get a belly ache I could eat so much cake I would get a belly ache I could eat so many cookies I'd have a belly ache and in the end of it I couldn't remember remember what the first cookie tasted like and in a few minutes you can't remember what the last cookie taste like but I remember when I first ate the book that's it hallelujah hallelujah that's right and it caused a multi-year bitterness in my life that's it that I struggled and tripped and fell over and struggled and tripped and fell over and struggled and T tripped and fell over but there was there was something inside am something inside oh my diet wouldn't have been enough to have supported me today but there was something in me in that day that I couldn't help and I would go back and take another bite of the book knowing that it was going to be bitter in my belly knowing I had lost of the Flesh and pride of life and all of these other things knowing I had to deal with this but something drew me back to take another bite of the book amen and then I started to realize as a qualified overeater you don't worry about the belly ache as long as they're still ice cream in the bowl keep eating you're going to face the belly ache but the taste of the ice cream is so sweet now if we could do that in the natural I know none of you ever did that people like you we could do that in the natural how about we decide that this is so sweet that's it I've got to eat it that's it I've got to eat it I will eat it every day I'll eat it and I'll confess it and I'll sing of it I'll bring it to pass amen I'll Fellowship around it amen because you see the word's changing us amen if you don't think so that's if you don't think so maybe you can go back through your photo albums that's it had a brother ask me brother Paul why do you like photo albums so much I'm telling on a secret here if we're coming over and you got photo albums out and you don't want me to see them you might want to hide them cuz I want to see who you was that's right I remember being at some believer's house one time and i' look through a photo album and I'd look through another photo album The brother's sitting there talking to me and he's like oh you'll see in the middle of that one blah blah blah blah and I reach over and I get another photo album and his wife had stepped in from the kitchen she comes tearing into the living room not that album and I was like what and she goes That's before we were saved I don't even know why it's out here it's probably good here you goes sister I probably don't want to see that album because you see they ate and they ate and they ate and they changed and they changed and they changed and that out problem is not who they really are exactly could someone say thank you Lord You Lord hallelujah hallelujah my oh my we'll just stop right there I've got some really good quotes amen but uh we'll let them be we'll let them be I have some other things I didn't even include in the sermon I thought if I got to them I could share them but just remember this in the law Amen brother Brown's talking about when you say well I'm weak and my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say Amen well our musicians come we'll stop right here amen what you should say I I've just got to read this last part do you mind while they're coming I mean the time's consumed anyway amen he says You must never say that don't never leave your test be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all of my heart amen do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it right well our thoughts used to all be negative but they're not all negative now are they amen we're changing that's right we're changing the prophecy is coming to pass in us a people a people that would be of his nature a people of his Spirit a people that bear His Image that's right oh hallelujah hallelujah amen well praise the Lord let's sing The Little Chorus when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all he has done done for me [Music] amen let's just stand just Worship the Lord for a few minutes Saints amen oh when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all he has done done for me oh and my soul Cries Out hallelujah praise God for saing me when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all he has done for me then my soul Cries Out Hallelujah oh praise God one more time saing me oh when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all he has done for me oh then my soul Cries Out hallelujah praise God for sa me amen are we glad glad that we have been invited to eat the book praise the Lord the book is good my brother and sister and I'll tell you the bitterness in your belly actually you might say in a sense figuratively goes away because you see as we shed by the preaching of the word iniquity unbelief and we shed these things amen well the flesh will be with us yeah the flesh will be with us you know I did a couple honest things [Music] yesterday a't that good you do honest things you know I had a product delivered to us that we never paid for then I misplaced it then I found it again then I forgot about it and yesterday I looked and there it is and I said I need to return this I never paid for this you should see the clerks well I don't know if we should take this or not it's going to mess up our inventory well I'm sorry it's yours and you're getting it back whether you want it or not yeah the guy's like you
