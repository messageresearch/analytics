TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh uh capitalize on probably in one service and uh saints honestly i'm shrinking my plate and i keep trying to shrink it down further i was joking with brother jason in the back room as i was adding another chunk of scripture just you know i just lord help me to shrink the plate but remember the scripture speaks very strongly of us who we are why we're here it speaks of vessels of honor and it speaks of vessels of dishonor now we have to just look at this and i know who we are tonight amen and we look at this no we are not vessels of dishonor we are vessels of honor but satan would like to pour what he desires into the vessel but god says nope if he pour if satan pours something in there you pour it out and cleanse the vessel because it's a holy vessel amen first peter first chapter verses one through five amen peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithya now i want you to remember we're talking about potential tonight elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy have begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you now my brother and sister i want to make emphasis here if it's reserved for you there's only one who can make a reservation in heaven amen no man can no pope not even a prophet amen it's nothing short of almighty god our lord jesus christ making the reservation so if he's made a reservation for you then he knew that you contained the potential to show up it's not just about saying we're going to be there but we actually have to show up amen so he sees the potential in us to be there who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time father we just ask you to come and lord speak through us tonight and father earth the laborers of the day the weak father sometimes we don't have the time that we would like to commit or should commit but father we truly commit all of this to you tonight that you would speak father according to thy will lord to the needs of the people lord touch each and every one i pray today in your precious name amen you may be seated you know as i was reading this scripture in first peter here i i was struck my brother and sister you know elect according to the foreknowledge of god and you know as we would look at this we never want to make justification for our weaknesses or shortcomings in the flesh but we know that god knows everything about each one of us it's not a surprise when we have a struggle over something it's not a surprise maybe when our feelings get hurt or or we feel like that we have a a not a friend on the earth i don't know if uh you would have um we we might post it right here on the church on uh sunday i'm still praying about that but uh brother george shared with us a little deal about reading the bible i don't know did any of you see that i think sister jerry posted that today on the on the church website website anyway now it's going to be one of them evening saints uh so you look at that and and what that little clip is about uh is what a reading your bible does to you and so we look at this and realize my brother and sister that the uh elect according to the foreknowledge of god god had to have something that would be the stimulus to sons and daughters of god in the day that we live in and as sister jerry shared that uh uh brother george having sent that uh my brother and sister you realize the stimulus that god uh has now it is important that we would make our claim and vocalize it that i am a son of god i am a daughter of god and i have received uh the word i have been filled with the holy ghost it's important for you to make those declarations but still as we go through life my brother and sister there has to be a stimulation that comes that stirs the heart every time that it comes to us and i thought that was lovely uh uh to to see that little bit of research that reading the bible has a stimulation it's not just uh something to talk about but the actual reading of the bible uh is a stimulation amen and so as we'll look at this we realize that god has come and so is he is stirring us by his word amen now the prophet of god i don't have quotes right here tonight to back this up but certainly uh we uh understand and know the message the prophet of god uh tells us that the preeminence of coming to church is not the singing amen it is not even our time of worship but it is the word because the word is what stimulates sons and daughters of god now singing is a wonderful thing i think it's good i think we should pour our heart out when we sing but my brother and sister there's a lot of people who sing who do not have the holy ghost amen but if you have the holy ghost you will sing amen you will praise god hallelujah and so as we'll look at this tonight i want you to see here now who are kept this is verse 5 who are kept by the power of god through faith into salvation ready to be revealed in the last time and as i was reading this my brother and sister i am not now trying to turn the scripture i'm just sharing inspiration that come to me and you look at this and see to an inheritance this is what he's brought to us my brother and sister an inheritance that's incorruptible hallelujah not going to fade away you're not going to go claim a promise of god and find that that promise has been eroded by time and is no longer valid amen and so it is undef uncorruptable and undefiled and it fadeth not away it's reserved in heaven for us so all we got to do as it were is ring up heaven and ask for that reservation amen and it is there now he's talking in heaven for you and unless my uh uh vast knowledge of the english language has diminished uh much more than it already is this who here is talking about you right who are kept by the power of god through faith amen nothing else right and how does faith come by hearing the word amen it doesn't say anything about singing it doesn't say anything about testimonies these are all important they're ingredients my brother and sister but it's faith and faith cometh by hearing the word so through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time now often times when we read this scripture and it would be in the proper context to realize that it's the revealing of the word in this hour amen the call in this late hour that called you and i a revelation or opening of the word that had been unveiled from man but my brother and sister i want if you can just step out in this little thought with me this evening i want you to understand that the uh solution as it were what is necessary for you as it were all the ingredients as it were were reserved in heaven for you to be revealed now we are in the last time amen so it's not my brother and sister about a message being revealed but this is actually about jesus christ who is already in you amen who has already made reservation for you this is about what he has deposited in your name being now revealed amen the ability to believe the word was already deposited in you amen the faith to act on that word already deposited in you right the prophet of god said everything you need to make a rapture is already in you amen it's not in the preacher the evangelist not in whatever it's in you amen so we're seeing now that this power of god through faith into salvation is ready to be revealed are you with me tonight amen it is being revealed we have seen it revealed but i believe there is so much more so i don't have the quote for you tonight but brother branham says that that there is much more than we see right now for us amen so what is it god's got it he's revealing it in the time and the season and as we move forward my brother and sister we see more revelation we see more of who we are we understand the plan better than ever before and you know it's sad i want to throw this in and i don't mean it negative but those who give gave up or quit many years gone by in the past they they're looking at you now they're looking at your life they're looking at what you uh confess what you believe they're looking at that and it is even more removed from them than it was before why because since the time that many of them walked away there's been much more revelation oh i've been told recently by ministers said well when the prophet passed from the scene there's no more revelation well my brother and sister that might be why those individuals are where they're at because you see this right here my brother and sister is revelation isn't that not what revealed means amen this is revelation that is going to be revealed so what is it god is peeling back as it were the layers of the onion which is you and what is on the inside of the inside of the inside is being revealed amen not something that was back when when we were comfortable with just god sent a prophet amen not back just to the days when someone got up and said well you know look at the third pull not in those my brother and sister that's all important but that's not the revelation that it's talking about here this is a revelation of christ in you amen so the layer being peeled back as time goes on amen i imagine all of you because you are believers and have been believers for a long time this journey is getting much easier as you go on to edge of sword isn't it because as you see more of who you are it is getting easier but as you get up tomorrow morning it's not getting easier it used to be that you could even go to a grocery store and just walk through a store you know i don't mean to taint your thinking tonight but the behavior of humanity now you would think when it got cold it would change their behaviors but no they go to the store in their shorts and go-go boots in january so it has to be an anointing because it can't be any sense amen so what is this this revelation in you is bringing to a place as the season and i know it's getting harder saints okay it's just a matter of figure of speech right as it gets harder right because the prophet of god showed us how as it would come down we're headed towards a complete apostasy complete darkness so for the son or daughter of god the outside world we're living in is getting more difficult to live in but you know i say thank you lord because that's what's going to cause you and i just sigh and cry that is what's going to cause you as we spoke the other day to turn up the prayer meter amen to turn it up because we are seeing the world falling apart and i say thank you lord because you see i'm not worried about what has happened he didn't say i'm going to keep the world he said he was going to keep you hallelujah aren't you glad tonight he's keeping that promise thank you lord amen so here we are established but i want to go back and just hit that see as people who have walked away they don't understand my brother and sister how you can just stand they say well we have this and we have a contradiction here we can't find nothing i just come across the deal the other day sometimes they stick and we can't find one shred of evidence well my brother and sister i i don't know that uh they uh jesus walked on water i have not won shredded evidence well hallelujah well we could use a lot of analogies on that i'll just shut that one off but my brother and sister it wouldn't be faith if we had evidence now i don't say that that we blindly walk but there comes a time and a place you get on an airplane you don't know my brother and sister that the wing ain't going to fall off of that airplane but you get on that plane by faith and if you get nervous about getting on the plane and the wing falling off remember you have greater odds according to the statistics of getting hit within six miles of your house in a car now i don't say these things to bring up a negative thing any of you flying no but my brother and sister we have to recognize that faith is a resident to a son or daughter of god it's not fleeting it doesn't come or go it is resident hallelujah are we good now let's go right here into ephesians 1 and 18 19 in the eyes of your understanding we're talking about potential tonight right and it being developed the eyes of your understanding being enlightened right so that line right there is talking of potential amen because you see every man or every woman that read their bible ephesians 1 18 not every man who read that eyes were open so it is speaking of the potential that is in sons and daughters of god right so the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints every bit of verse 18 is speaking of potential amen verse 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power now my brother and sister you and i have believe it or not not even come into but a fraction of the power of almighty god he spoke heavens and earth now it might have been a thousand years ten thousand years it's all irrelevant whether you're a believer of the old earth and the new earth and they've got all kinds of subcategories that they put into time and they say well you know this can't be right because we have evidence of dinosaurs and we have evidence of this that and the other my brother and sister i'm just going to take what the word said and when i take this i'm reading this and i see a potential or a promise in there that says my eyes are going to be open amen so what am i looking for i'm looking for my eyes to be opened i'm not going to sit back and say well hallelujah god will reveal it to somebody look the prophet of god spoke many words that people still don't understand it takes eyes of understanding ears of understanding to understand what was already broken out of this scripture and laid on the table amen so there the potential of your understanding being enlightened amen that you have the potential to know the hope of his calling you have the potential to know the riches of his glory of the inheritance now my brother and sister an inheritance is not an inheritance unless it's been bequest it has to be designated to someone to actually be classified an inheritance you see if it's just left did you know i did a little studying on this did you know that there is a tremendous amount of money every year that goes into the state funds and depending on the situation into the federal funds because someone died with a tremendous amount of money and left it to no one and after it sets there and no one can make a legitimate claim then the state can step in put that money in account use that money as it were for uh uh we're gonna just use this term time and eternity until someone makes a claim at different states have different laws but if it passes for a certain amount of years unclaimed then the state has no obligation to ever give it up so you look at this my brother and sister for an inheritance to truly be an inheritance someone has to be named as the receiver of such amen aren't you glad i just read my name right in there hallelujah it's just plain to me as plain as day my name is right there hallelujah amen so we get to make that claim upon the word of god that there is a riches of the glory of his inheritance in wait not coming to in the saints you see god already made the investment in us hallelujah we'll get to kind of hopefully lord willing here but you see it's not this is not something to come this is something that's already here hallelujah oh many would contest that my brother and sister they believe if you talk about god being present with us that you are uh uh uh you know going off into a doctrine of parasia perugia however you want to pronounce that but my brother and sister we have way too much scripture we have way too many quotes prophet of god talking about god being with us in us amen present tonight amen the inheritance is already in the saints amen all right we are receiving that inheritance and as we claim our inheritance it is then revealed to us you know reminds me of a little story i read once a young man was a sole survivor of a family a very tragic accident took place he was a sole survivor and as he sat there uh with an attorney and the will was read uh you know he he made a statement when it was all done turns out his family grandparents parents were extremely wealthy and in the end when they have said young man you're worth millions of dollars and this is all yours right now at this moment has become yours and he said i would rather have them than this but do you realize saints when we receive this inheritance right here it is him hallelujah it's not the wealth of this world it's not objects it's not at sets it's not other stuff it is him hallelujah aren't you glad tonight amen that our inheritance is him our lord jesus christ hallelujah oh my i can get excited about that amen now look at this ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship now my brother and sister if god is almighty omnipotent on present he is is he not amen he can't build you've heard the phrase we're kind of drawing it away he can't build junk but we are his workmanship oh i'll tell you we shouldn't get a big head about it but we ought not walk around all mopey about what our life is amen whether we're short or tall skinny or chunky or whatever we might be super smart just average whatever we might be we are what god made us to be and what we ought not be looking as the outside of this flesh or the abilities of this or the thinking of the gray matter what we ought to be looking at is i am him amen i'm his workmanship he made me he poured a portion of himself out when he made me oh hallelujah thank you lord for we are his workmanship created did you catch now the little words here in scripture it's not my brother and sister all the big things it's the little ones we miss we were created not by him in him oh hallelujah created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them oh look at this now what are we looking at uh incredible potential that god has laid in you and i then i i believe i'm just going to be bold tonight amen i'm older than i was on sunday so i'm just that much more bolder amen but look at this my brother and sister i don't believe we recognize the potential that god has placed in you and i i think we're catching a greater glimpse in a greater glimpse and a greater glimpse but my brother and sister there's so much more out here because you see as it is now i don't say this derogatory but as the prophet of god says you know what are we going to do we don't have faith enough for a toothache and it's going to take rapturing faith to get out of here you know what let's not get despondent let's not get discouraged let's say lord take me to rapturing faith amen that potential of protest uh possessing or expressing really is the word we should say that expressing of rapturing faith is in me amen i don't have to go out here and look at i don't need to go find some great evangelist in the message i don't need to go find the enlightened pastor or teacher or whatever and find it it's already rapturing faith is here let's let god peel the onion back let it peel it back lord peel it back because rapturing faith is in here and it will come because if he ordained us to this position then he let me be bold had to put rapturing faith in you had to he can't call you to this position and leave that ingredient out oh can someone give a real loud amen thank you lord it's in us saints i don't care what you felt like today or yesterday or or preacher monday or preacher wednesday amen none of that matters my brother and sister god was not negligent and left rapturing faith out of those he called to be his bride oh well let's not rest on our laurels we still have a work to do we still have a a life to live we have still an expression of god to bring forth but my brother and sister let the devil knock you down and push you around that oh my i have this and i have that and i can't this and i can't that it's in there lord reveal it hallelujah oh we ought to be praying for the revelation my brother wait the prophet told us to say minister that told me that no more revelation would come because the prophet of god was off the scene my brother and sister you want to talk about how deceptive things can be prophet's gone no more revelation prophet of god told me to pray for revelation i'm gonna say what the prophet of god said and i'm going to do what the prophet of god said and i'm going to just keep praying for revelation he didn't put on that pray for revelation until i'm off the scene now pray for revelation until something happens here something happens there he said pray for revelation amen and so that revealing that we just saw in this scripture when you pray for revelation you are praying for that to come to pass or praying for it as it were to continue to manifest in your life amen that's not praying for us to wake up in the morning and we've got a new deal that we all got to go up to table rock on a certain day and stand by the cross come on i had a brother share the testimony with me called to go to a certain hilltop a certain day and do that we'll get this when one of the families didn't show up and the sun rose and there was no rapture the preacher stood out and said now if anyone you want to be upset don't be upset at me it's this family who didn't come it's their fault because if they'd have been here the rapture would have took place pretty scriptural isn't it not in the bible i read amen well hallelujah so let's look at this and let's come with the expectation of the revelation the revealed amen that the word is talking about will come to pass in you and i amen because you see what he's done he has been molding us imagine now that we come in a time fiery trials now my opening scripture i didn't go on down further into those verses and it talks about how that the fiery trials coming the testing of our faith wait did you know this is not god punishing us this is not god uncaring this is god carving away everything that is hindering your potential oh hallelujah you know it reminds me of an athlete i've told the story here in the church i'll tell it briefly here tonight there was an athlete many years ago i forgotten his name now but he was well on his way to the olympics and a great runner and he uh tore i believe it was hamstring and uh so you know they said well you tore it so bad that you are you are um your running career is over and uh so he just he had a dream of of uh you know running in the olympics and he just was like that can't be i refuse to accept that and so as he healed up and all the physical therapy all the pain or everything associated with that he reached a place that he just couldn't quite qualify uh in in these great meets that were you know racing uh uh track meets that were coming and he couldn't quite qualify and and his coach told him he said um nope you you listen to the doctors you're done but this young man he he he just couldn't receive that so he went to another coach and um a a man that was renowned for his uh uh training of athletes and he went to him and the man said well i don't i really honestly i don't think you got it in you and uh this young man got upset and he said how can you judge me and he says well i've helped i've helped hundreds i've helped hundreds of young men and women make it to this and i just don't think you got it in it now when you read this story you have to catch the fact that this coach never once is talking about his injury oh come on saints i hope you're with me i've been so hurt i've been so hurt i've been hurt by ministry i've been hurt by this person i've been hurt by this i've been hurt by family the coach doesn't talk about injury he just tells him i don't think you've got it in you and the young man starting to say well how dare you say that and the coach said well if you want me to coach you you have to do what i tell you and he finally says yes i want to do this i'll do that so is there training the coach would tell him he said you're not you're not putting a hundred percent in it he'd tell him look i've been injured i'm he said look no you're not putting a hundred percent in and when he would run he'd tell him what you've got to do you're moving your shoulders and some of this i might not have it just right forgive me you're moving your shoulders but your shoulders are moving counter to your hips and you're actually hindering yourself and you're running in such a posture i don't remember if it's head forward or head back you're limiting yourself and the coach just keeps almost sounds like a pastor he just keeps picking away at him and one day when he is run and his legs cramped up and he he's there he just he just finally the coach says you got to give more and he's i got no more to give and the coach tears into him and finally the young man just throws down and says i quit and the coach says i knew i knew oh imagine imagine brother sean the man would come and stand right in your face i knew you were a quitter and he got so angry how dare you call me a quitter i am not a quitter he says really you're not a quitter you look like a quitter and i just saw you quit and he got up in an anger but for the sake tonight i want to call it righteous indignation devil you called me a quitter you know how many times oh we don't have to raise our hands how many times we've said i'm done oh come on come on and you you know i i want to be an example pastor's supposed to be an example hallelujah amen this is times this is not edition look but it don't matter because you see something down inside and he got this young man so riled up amen and then he says will you listen to me now will you listen to me now and he said i'll listen do you know that young man went on to the olympics i don't remember exactly how he placed now but he won medals he won awards because you see he couldn't run the race the way he thought he should run he had to listen to a coach and when i reference the coach to being the preacher well we know who our real coach is amen the lord jesus christ amen so we have to listen we can't run this race our way we can't come and say well i'm doing just fine running it my way amen you see we're his workmanship so if he says put your head back and put your chest out and lift a hand up and praise the lord amen don't think that sticking your head down and shuffling along all slumped down in the depression is going to be the same then it'll work the same put your chest back and say amen i might have made mistakes but i am a child of god hallelujah that's how we run the race amen not by acting like we're defeated my dad told me many years ago when i was just a boy he said son when someone looks you in the face and says they're humble they're not because humble doesn't have to tell you that they're humble amen faith doesn't have to walk around and say i am a man of great faith no faith moves mountains amen faith moves even the heart of god oh hallelujah now you look at this now let me go back here and uh remember where i'm at and what i'm doing here tonight but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far far off were made nigh by the blood boy that's powerful blood for he is our peace hath made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us amen i preached this just on sunday but i just had to bring this in it's actually in the lower verse here having abolished in his flesh to enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace amen so there's no secondary no third no forth no way amen it's all god hallelujah that's what the prophet of god said it's all god amen uh you might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off unto them that were nigh for through him we have both had for through him we both have access by one spirit and to the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints in other words you're part of the body and of the household of god amen and are built upon the foundation of the apostles now i want you to think about this my brother and sister we're now building and the apostles god had to lay a foundation under the apostles this is not the apostles foundation this is god's foundation that he set the apostles on amen and now we're brought to set upon that same foundation and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth into a holy temple in the lord in whom also ye are builded together for a habitation of god through the spirit now as well look at this a habitation my brother and sister is the act of living in a place a place where someone lives the act of inhabiting inhabiting it occupancy a dwelling place synonyms occupancy occupation possession residency now look at this my brother and sister in whom you're building together for a dwelling place of god see it's not just a casual pass by thing it's not like the coffee shop it's not like the cafe this is a place where god said i'm going to come down and the foundation's correct the atmosphere is correct the doctrine is correct and those people that want to say well you know what we'd rather have a good spirit in our church and not worry about the doctrine if you want i'll show you where the prophet of god says you have no doctrine you don't have any faith in god amen so you have to have a correct doctrine and people say well rather have the right spirit and the wrong doctrine i've heard that so many times i want to scream in fact while back you might you guys thought it was a jet and a sonic boom in the valley that was actually paul out there on the phone screaming amen because my brother and sister when people think that we need to make the decision well i would rather have the right spirit and not worry about my doctrine i'm telling you my brother and sister the bride has the right spirit and she has the right doctrine amen oh i'm not saying against what the prophet of god said we know what he said but he was talking to the public my brother and sister and when it comes to christ speaking to his bride he's not going to say well you know what now i'm going to use to use a radical example he's going to say you know what sweetheart bride of mine the bride of christ amen you are so loving you are so kind and you really don't look that bad in that miniskirt oh come on saints come on they may as well be saying that because doctrine well it leads to all kinds of things my brother and sister because a wrong doctrine will come in and lay the wrong foundation and if christ is resting on the foundation that was laid for the apostles actually preached out by the apostles for the bride of christ and we've got another foundation what kind of building are we going to have amen one of our landlords has remodeled their farmhouse they were showing me a few days ago how that they added the porch into the house many years ago probably 35 years ago they added the front porch into the house and make the bedrooms bigger they said they never gave it much thought years ago when they added the porch into the house but now they wanted to put down this hardwood floor but the porch goes like this and they never noticed i'd rather have the right spirit good you can be happy in that house but if you want to put hardwood on the floor you're going to have a hard time god's got a good foundation it's square it's level it's plumb amen it don't need an excuse hallelujah how did we get on that subject amen what are we we'll build it together for a habitation a living place of god we're not here just simply to press through life good days bad days struggles hope we make it oh my come on you see an empty house has potential but it can't say it's occupied that's right that's why the scripture says that when those spirits are cast out if that house is not filled then those spirits return and see that the house is empty go and get seven others like them because the house that's empty is a house that has potential but it is not what it was called to be reminds me some people one time i read this story on the internet so of course it was true but there was a house that was built in a subdivision i believe this is down in texas and someone spread a story about how that house was built over a grave or something like that and they spread this story with such conviction that the house did not sell and did not sell and did not sell and did not sell but enough conviction also no one would rent the house and it took someone from out of town who moved in and he come and they were driving around and they find this house the yard is kind of weedy house has obviously not been painted for a few years but yet it never been occupied and they asked a realtor and the realer just said you don't want to do that that house is haunted now these people were christians and they approached this and i i liked their approach and i i've thought about this more than once and i've encouraged an individual one time that was tormented in a house they were living in and these people were christians and they said so why is it haunted well when they were digging the foundation the crawl space they found a grave or whatever and and nobody's ever lived in the house and nobody will rent it it's just set this way for several years and the man said we'll take it because it was a bargain price and they said sir you're making a mistake and he said no we're not we're not making a mistake and the realtor was invited to these people's first night in their home they had a party that evening the realtor was invited nice nice people and uh about halfway through the party the the man and his wife and children they all stopped and were silent and said now we're going to commit this house and the realtor is a little uncomfortable like what are you doing oh we're just going to pray they just gathered around the house opened the bible read a scripture and bound every spirit and went right on and lived in the house now the realtor later come and says if you guys ever had any issues or anything like that he said no and there never will no because you see we bound it amen and we believe the scripture that whatever we have bound is bound amen my brother and sister we need a sure foundation we need to be able to say when the word says we bound that spirit it's bound we're not saying lord bind this spirit i mean like i hope you would bind this fear or maybe you could bind this spirit but you see my brother and sister the potential that resides in the bride of christ is not an ability that i have in me or an ability you have in you it is our ability to believe the word and let the word come out of us and the word says bind the spirit they believed it they bound the spirit and lived you might say happily ever after in the home and god prepared that house for them because they bought it for a fraction of the market amen and everybody was so afraid if they'd been a real christian in their neighborhood they'd went up there laid hands on that house and said we bind every devil and we've got a cheap house but it took someone from out of town that wasn't all caught up in the local church atmosphere oh my god yes sir well hallelujah we're fishing amen now look in identification i gotta hurry right along where does the time go saints i had a hired man today he was tired and he he told me he says paul he said i'm gonna go home and i said you can't go home it's too early he says no go look at the clock i turned it forward he said but don't worry i'll turn it back in the morning then see god come down and the character of god was christ he was the reflection he was god made visible amen amen notice god made visible in the beginning was god he wasn't even god then no god is an object of worship only thing he was was the eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was expressed to words and word was made manifest now why does it bother people when you start preaching about the word being made manifest my brother and sister i'll tell you why it bothers them because it does not fit in the intellectual conception of the message the intellectual conception of the message is the prophet said it i believe it but what do you believe because if the prophet said it he was speaking the word unless you're in a cult he was speaking the word and the word has to be manifested and the word has to come to fruition oh hallelujah so you know it's better just to put on the the suit and the tie right amen reminds me of a story i just read recently a man robbed a place all he did to get in the place to rob it was put on a tux and a tie and act like he was a waiter when the party was going on he just climbed right up the people's stairs and stole all their jewels walked right back down kept serving food to the people finally slipped out a side door and walked away my oh my go study we'll save that for another time it's already time to dismiss and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and the word was made manifest what is it it's all god amen oh divide it up well it's a holy ghost it's christ it's this it's that come on let's get down to the fact it's all god becoming tangible and you are just a thought of god no you are a part hallelujah and jesus come to redeem those that was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world it was in god's thoughts and that's what he's come to redeem and them as soon as it strikes to them they see it oh it's not as soon as they reason it out and not as soon as they've studied it out not as soon as they've got quotes to back it up come on my brother and sister you know we i'm gonna i'm just gonna get rough for a moment we got people around the country that unless you can hand them a quote they won't believe it now i'm sorry my brother and sister the prophet of god did not preach the whole bible amen there's scriptures there's scriptures my brothers and sisters the prophet of god never touched so do we put them on the shelf because we don't have a quote to go with them no sir the word has continuity and revelation takes you to all of the word amen it was in god's thoughts and that's what you come to redeem and then as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there but if the life isn't in there then what can they do see they don't see it they'll never see it amen oh my this sees it takes it beyond now that's a little blunt but it takes it beyond my brother and sister i don't remember where the iq levels are but it takes it beyond whether your iq was 50 or it was 200. i think 50 means that you probably are handicapped 200 means you're a genius but you see it's not it's not counting on that and it's not a matter of i can lift up 300 pounds or i can barely lift up 50. it doesn't matter and it doesn't matter if we're good looking do you know the only time that good looking matters is when you look in the mirror mirror mirror on the wall yeah yeah come on saints look let's have a little humor amen i won't go there i have actually a tremendously funny story but it's not appropriate so for this thought i mean but if the life isn't in there then what can they do see they don't see it they'll never see it see and the whole thing as jesus said at that day you'll know that i'm in the father the father and me i in you and you in me the whole thing is god becoming material wow look at this i am the potential you are the potential of god in the flesh oh hallelujah you ought to get somebody excited tonight amen it's not just well there's some spiritual people here some spiritual people there it's only for a prophet no my brother and sister this is for you and i amen we are in god and he is in us and if you can separate those then that person is not saved come on if you can separate them put god to the side and the individual to the side then that person is not saved because when they are saved the holy ghost comes down and they become even the very physical material of jesus christ on the earth oh that's what the word of god said that's what the prophet of god said amen the whole thing is god becoming material like a husband and a wife becoming one now look i'll tell you what i'm going to make an offer to the church if any of you sitting in the church here or that would hear this tape would say well me and my husband or me and my wife are not one then i'm more than willing to spend however many hours going through the scripture with you to show you've got a serious flaw in your marriage come on if you're living as it is two separate entities in the same house then you have a spiritual separation from god because he typed the church to a husband and a wife and you cannot be separated as husband and wife and say we are connected to god well that'll quiet a church down hallelujah come on if we're in a place where we think we're separated as husband and wife then we need to find an altar husband and wife both and we get down to that altar and we break through we'll get up and recognize that before the foundation of the world god knew that you would marry that individual and knew that it would be for your benefit even if you want to choke him over this upper table like husband and wife becoming one together god and his church becoming one oh hallelujah look at the potential saints look what we have hallelujah oh my now look i want to hurry along when it fell upon luther no no there's that bad m word then it manifested that promise of that hour when it fell upon wesley it manifested the promise of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when it fell on moses it manifested the promise of that hour fell on noah manifest the promise of that hour when it fell upon jesus it manifested the promise of that hour see it's the holy spirit coming down to quicken make alive those people that's for ordained of god to be in the rapture look that quickening is not just hallelujah no alive alive that means you get up in the morning and the same thing that made you excited tonight will make you excited in the morning we'll make you excited in the afternoon we'll make you excited when you're standing in a mud hole with mud up to your knees and you got problems and things have broken broken broke and this and that and whatever my brother and sister it'll still be the same thing you can stop and say today was a terrible day but thank you lord for saving my soul oh hallelujah now i hope i don't embarrass y'all okay because like i told you i'm getting older my filter broke and i just have to say it like i see it you see when it fell on jesus it manifests the promise of our holy spirit coming down to quicken to make alive those people amen isn't it strange god always puts those quantifiers in there so there's just those people who are those those people anybody know those people amen amen oh my that's for ordained of god to be in the rapture notice that is if he's a true eagle he'll under will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle amen you know south america they have we went to a youth deal what was that far down city we went and did and go and they've got what was that rock called eagle rock needles nasty eagle rock something like that and did you know in that area they have an eagle oh i hope you catch this they've got an eagle great big feet with claws great big wingspan and one of the brothers told me says brother paul if you see this eagle you won't recognize him i said why i think i know what an eagle looks like well they call him an eagle but he's really a buzzard wow now let's read this again so we can get this right that notice that is if he is a true ego he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle not an eagle buzzard now the little eagle probably in the barnyard was eating all right but he knowed it wasn't just exactly right but when he heard the truth then he received this truth now in john 14 uh 89 john 5 24 rather jesus said speaking this way he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life and shall not come into the judgment but is past past from death and to life just think how simple that is come on saints are you with me just how simple that is well do you have this doctrine do you have this do you have this do you have that do you know this brother you met this family you know these over here one of them my dear friend i think you might know him brother george smith he's told me before he said i get sick and tired of people going oh brother george i know people that know you good maybe i don't know them though what he was implying is everybody's got to name drop well i'm good friends with brothers so and so and i go to so-and-so's church and i've met you and i really okay fine good oh my i want to speak ill of my brother george but he just has a way about him yeah he that heareth my words and believeth on him they send me half everlasting life and shall not come in the judgment but his past from death and to life just think how simple that is he that believeth now the correct way of saying that hmm amen he that understandeth it now look how that goes my brother and sister now are we turning it no i'm saying just what the prophet of god said here now you go out here on the street and say to this prostitute you believe sure you believe he's the son of god certainly been baptized sure go down to the record say you hear that you hear that preacher preach yeah you believe that sure see but amen he that understandeth he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from death unto life then when this new boy that looks ripe to start a new doctrine right there come on saints how about we just start us a new doctrine tonight when that new eternal life dwells in you amen come on some people just well they've done it on less than that then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is it is it is it is it is it is the potential or the earnest of you being quickened from mortal to immortality oh my brother and sister look what god's doing he opened his word he's given it to us he's already poured the potential into us now we're seeing with eyes that are clear the potential of who we are oh to know see he that understandeth he that knoweth his place in this hour we can look back and say well you know if i had been there if i had been here if i had been here but you're here amen you need to know who you are in this hour right now amen and when this new eternal life amen because you see this is new my brother and sister to us when we come to the lord fully committed let me paraphrase this or i may not paraphrase this but quantify this when i mean new and coming to the lord i mean we don't come with our own idea that's right we don't come with our own expectations we don't come with our own guideline we don't come with our own moral standard we don't come with our own revelation amen we give it all to him because we've heard his word that's right not this man's word not that man's word not another man's word we've heard his word and we believeth on him that sent me right oh hallelujah sister emmy would you come i've still got more oh my yes now look also in the easter seal i want to just close out this last portion here i'm just one one quote 10 songs away from the end amen let me say that again when this east when this spirit i mean i'm looking up at the line excuse me let me say that again when this spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential oh hallelujah what god put down you might say on the books is your potential not what you think not what somebody told you not whatever it is my brother and sister what god put down is your potential somebody say amen really loud hallelujah you see here's the problem we have now this is where we start to struggle like if you asked me for an oak tree and i gave you an acorn oh yeah my goodness lord i ask you for this this and this yeah i gave it to you now the life for the oak tree is an acorn now but you have to wait till it grows up so do we when you receive the holy spirit of god it's god's potential waiting upon you that's already oh hallelujah can i be a pentecostal tonight it recognized me hallelujah when the holy ghost come right down and moved through laodicea moved up and down the streets of this nation it recognized me oh hallelujah he didn't pass me over and said whoa i lost one somewhere oh it recognized me hallelujah and you're sealed by the spirit of promise of god into the body of christ when god looked down at calvary and see jesus dying he not only he died for his bride the body which is the word church [Music] why do we take it back to the word [Music] because we're a word church amen hallelujah [Music] the church that believes the word of god for the age whether it's feet body head or whatever it is see it's christ it's christ was bleeding and dying and god looking upon him and saw his resurrection and the church was raised with him on easter hallelujah i'm not trying to make a doctrine nobody here there or yonder get upset and try and twist what i'm saying but sayings i'm already resurrected if the prophet of god said if you're in him now then you had to be in him then and if you're not in him now you wasn't in him then amen so what is it it's a finished work it's a finished work at calvary my brother and sister and here we are the word of god spoken by the words of a prophet telling that he already raised amen in the resurrection and the church raised with him hallelujah now if you're already raised up i want to ask you what are you letting something stop your potential god help us to reach out and take a holds of that i got a friend that's an electrician and he's been shocked by 110 220 and 440 which wasn't his fault someone else shoved wire down a conduit and shoved it right into a live panel and the end of it was right there coiled around his feet lit him up put him in a hospital he's got quite a sense of humor my friend [Music] he said you want to know the secret of the difference of 110 220 and 440. he said really nothing they're all a shocking experience now my brother and sister i say that with a little humor tonight but if we'll just reach out and grasp the potential of what god has given to you and i as believers of his word you will find it will be a shocking experience and you'll never say oh i feel a little nervous and embarrassed you'll never do that because once you've come in his presence you're going to say i don't care what the whole world no no another rest this even matters when i see the whole plan of god and who i am and what he did from the very beginning and the fact that oh if i had just an example tonight hey you know he just took in his and said here here is this brother here's his sister and now i'm pouring in the potential what is that potential to be all that we needed to be to fulfill the word of god all that we needed to be to stand before the throne of almighty god one day all that we needed to do said at the marriage supper of the lamb reading about the millennium the prophet of god talking about no it's not going to be like this it's going to be all burnt over and all cleansed there won't be one thing left that's not of god oh hallelujah do you realize saints god's already given us the potential to fulfill that to kick everything out that's not of god amen to let our potential be expressed in the fullness oh hallelujah oh praise the lord tonight thank you lord amen let's just stand and sing a song brother jason help me uh please pray for my voice it just got a little bit of a ache in the back of my hallelujah but i don't care and i i've got i've got the answer hallelujah
