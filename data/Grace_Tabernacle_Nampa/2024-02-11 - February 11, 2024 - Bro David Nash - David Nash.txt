musicians God bless you this morning you can be seated for a few minutes before we get started we uh thanks to brother Paul for inviting us and having us come this morning we uh wasn't planning on coming back for another few weeks for the uh you know I can't say that while you guys were freezing here I was standing on the beach in El Salvador at 90 degrees holding services and boy I didn't know you know you get in that country and you like I think of Nicaragua and it's when you get heat there's also that it's wet and sticky and I didn't know El Salvador has a dry season it felt wonderful and I was you know looking at the phone going the weather reports and it's snowing and blowing and zeros and I'm going Lord thank you say really nice but uh Wow since last time we were here we've been to Honduras uh New Finland El Salvador Texas Florida back out to Oregon and uh I tell people I can't say it keeps me off the streets but I'd like to think it keeps me out of trouble so so God bless you this morning I'm glad to be here greetings from my family I have one correction I I I think I told my son uh Jackson Mississippi actually that little sister I prayed with there is from Foley Alabama and I'm not sure she would like being associated with Mississippi so excuse us for that error error corrected so just not to make you stand again but just from respect for the word if we could stand for just a moment am God bless the visitors with us this morning we pray that the Lord would Grant you something for strength and courage in these late hour in which we live so we'll start with some very familiar scriptures in Genesis first chapter first few verses there uh and I know pretty much everyone will be familiar with this says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth Earth was without form and the were and void and dark dark Ness was upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and then in John the first chapter says here page is flipping we'll read just a couple of verses there in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men and we'll drop down to the 12th verse but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name amen gracious Heavenly Father we've read a portion of your word this morning may it become part of our Lives as we commit this service to you in the holy and mighty name of Jesus Christ amen please be seated and thank you as and I suppose we've done this here before but for the sake of the visitors I view the gospel similar to this I've already drank some of it but it's it's water and it's in a bottle and a lot of the word of God as we read it it's what they call transitive and it simply just means to move from one position to another it's where we get the words Transportation transport uh and so when we think of the Gospel as being transitive it means it's moving and it's moving continuously even as we're speaking now because it's moving not just from the pages of the book but it's moving from those pages through my heart through my life through the spirit that God put in me and and by his holy spirit it's moving into your ears and your hearts as as you receive it and so the gospel's always moving and if we think of it as not just moving it place to place but inside this is water and human beings can't live without water and so H I'm drinking it where did it go well the water moved it became transitive not just from the bottle from one place to another but it became transitive to well where did it go it became part of me amen that water became a part of me and as we drink the water it becomes part of us Jesus said I give you water you'll never thirst again so we know but there's something else that we don't really see when I drank the water for human beings we can't exist without water we're I guess it's 90 some per water so there's life for us in this water that's right there's life for us in this water and so it is spiritually there's life amen in here but we have to move it I had to move it from the bottle if it just sat there in a bottle and I'm out on the desert you know hold my throat it does me no good I have to move the water from the bottle into the body amen and so it is with the Gospel of Jesus Christ it has to be moved from these Pages that's right and be moved into you know through these eyes through these ears through this right but even beyond that into the spirit that's in me that that it takes the spirit of the life of Jesus Christ to come into me Amen to as the Bible says I'm a new creation that's right now we just read there from Genesis and it said that God in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and then and then it spoke to how the Earth was void and how after that void then he speaks and he said God said let there be light and there was and not just there was but there still is and even the light that's on right now is not the same light these lights and even the sunlight outside it's not the same sunlight that was here yesterday right because the light is still continuing to move it's pouring out from God because it's transitive amen and just as the life came out of that water and goes into my body the life comes out from the Throne of God Amen and from the Throne of God it moves and the light begin continues to create I was reading something yesterday from an astronomy Channel and they talked about how they've discovered that there is a light and a sound that they don't know where it started they don't know where it came from but they said even as it's moving now through space and Through the Universe it's actually changing you know we know that light comes in waves like sound does and even the waves on the sea they come at different intervals and there's different sizes and so it is with light as it comes forth from God by the word of God it has life that it carries the inoc and they said even the spectrum of the light that was they have determined that the Spectrum the colors have changed from what was struck the Earth say a thousand years ago the Spectrum has actually changed and intensified I believe it was that it it's just it's changed to a different actual color even in the light that we see and that sounds kind of strange but you know here a few months ago they said well you got cataracts so they put some new little fers in there and uh I was so amazed about the second day after the they take the dark glasses and stuff I'm I'm looking around I'm just I'm walking up to people going wow wow I I haven't seen that blue for a long time wow look at the red on that because the Spectrum changed amen and when we put the lens of God's word and the lens of the experience asking Jesus Christ just come take me yeah that's how yeah I I look back and you know sometimes it seems like we kind of brag about what we did in the life before no man I was a rock and roll bum but when Jesus Christ got a hold of me the light the lens changed and now I looked back and I was talking to the brothers right before service and you know we did a lot a lot a lot a lot of services since we saw you last and brother Chris he said man but you look younger I said well yeah the spectrum's changed and the life of God Aaron put an old stick in the in before the Lord and the stick blood buted and you say well you know I sorry about your your mom God bless you but we know this that she might be budding right now we look at it as well that old stick that old B this old body but that spirit is budding into the presence of God and how that God can take these words and and if we realize this whole gospel that we believe in it's continually moving and continually changing and it's we realize that in Hebrews 13:8 it says that he's the same yesterday today and forever but we also read that it's in one place place that calls him and morha in the Greek which means to change the mask that's right the as we think of it we're in three part bodies we're in an outside body we're in a spirit that makes this outside body move and beyond that is the soul or the nature of the human being we were because of Genesis you know in the Garden of Eden took on a nature of the world and of the flesh but now through Jesus Christ we can take on the nature of God and as we take on the nature of God we step from one position to another position to where that God can come and begin to move the light through these mortal bodies and he can place his nature day by day Wave by wave into our lives and wave by wave you know we we sing about oh praise God I'm redeemed but it goes beyond Redemption that's right as we think of that's right in the the normal you know people well praise the Lord I believe in Jesus Christ I'm saved yeah but you're saved for a purpose you are saved so that you can exude the light of Jesus Christ so that Christ can come into us and show himself we talk about the righteousness of God he is the righteous one but his right righteousness continues to move and it continues to expand and it continues to go out in the into the universe and it moves from we would say the the heart the bottle of God into our hearts and into our lives that we might exude the righteousness and the Bible says that we become the righteousness of God the lord it's because his righteousness changed me from a sinner from whatever I was before into a man that can hopefully exude the presence of Jesus Christ that you and I can take the presence of Jesus Christ to someone else it's not just so you can sit in church it's not just so you can sit around a tape recorder or read those are all great things but the life of Jesus Christ should be moving that's it should be transitive we think of the the children of Israel and we know that there had been a prophecy how that when God had come to Abraham in the form of MDC no father no mother no and so on as you read about him in that form in the book of Hebrews but he came to Abraham and when he came to Abraham the life from that God moved into Abraham and then we know that there's so many types and shadows Jesus Christ is everywhere in this book amen and it would take months weeks years a lifetime to even touch a few chapters really sometimes but we know there was a promise given to Abraham now we think about this so here is God speaking to Abraham and he's just told him about Sodom and such and what's going to happen there and then he gives this promise to Abraham now think about this he says Abraham your seed's going to go down and dwell in a Strange Land for 400 years and after that I'm going to come on the scene and take him out and the purpose for taking them out of Egypt he doesn't call it Egypt there but he says a Strange Land he said the purpose is for that because I want to put them in another land yeah so what just happened the word of God the light the power behind the word God said let there be light and there was light it's different light today because light's continuing to move transitive through the universe through our lives and how that that word went from Abraham into Abraham's seed which was Isaac as far as the natural man but what was ISAC carrier of well you read the life of Isaac and we find types and shadows of Jesus Christ in his life and even how that when it came time for him to be married Abraham said you know gave it to his servant said go find him a wife among my Kindred we are to be a wife of this Kindred the Kindred seed of Jesus Christ and how did it move from Isaac and how from Isaac you know into to uh Jacob and Esau and on down and how that and that it was continually moving moving moving and how that everything once God speaks something the entire universe begins to come into order and to move to move and transitively move everything into position to bring the word of God to pass because that word that went to Abraham goes to Isaac goes to Jacob and it's moving moving moving through history and this one we got that one and this one and this it's all the word of God transiting moving two time until one day wow there's a famine we got to go get some food we're hungry and so they go down to Egypt hey at first everything's Grand and happy sometimes you know you you meet Jesus Christ and we used to joke around a little bit but how that wow God kind of put a hedge around you and everything's great for a while and then all of a sudden he pulls out the carpet wow I didn't know it was going to be like this and life becomes a battle and a struggle but it's God moving and putting the character the character the life that's in the Bottle Into You and I through our struggles through the things that we go through in life and eventually Egypt got to where they're in bondage they're getting be they're getting whipped they're going through all these things and what was it it's the life of God putting the character of God into them because he when they get out what's he tell them he said well you know you just went through this so you'll learn what it's like to be in Str be a stranger and be in bondage so that you'll learn how to treat other people it's bottom line and how that you all do these things because the life of God is being transferred from the word that can't started as a seed Abraham and now we see the fruit of the fruition the fullness of it being manifested in the children of Israel the word of God had become transitive the moment he spoke it and it moved in waves through time there was times they were up times they were down times they were up times they were down that's right because it moves in waves but the Spectrum changed from that little tiny seed that went to Abraham thy seed shall go down until here's a mass and a multitude of a harvest from that first little tiny words the Abraham because it's expanding it's growing it's moving it's a moving word of God in us amen amen praise the Lord the Lord that's right well maybe I should look at my notes I don't know but let's look at something we know in Genesis 1:1 you don't have to turn to it it just says let let every seed bring forth of its own kind and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and Herb yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so that little space you know and it was so there was a word went forth every seed brings forth of its own kind and it was so am and that that little those two one of the greatest Mysteries to me in this whole end time message that we talk about is that there's a time space between those two little dots what a mystery there's people out there that struggle and and and strain and wonder why why they think the bi Bible's all mix up well if you understand that it's not just 15 minutes ago this bottle was full but now it's lost some of what it had to become something else because it's moving and it was so and so seed be continues to Bear of its own kind and Seed continues to bring forth what it was if I give brother Trevor here's Trevor go plant some corn and I flip him a bunch of corn I probably should say that to Paul he's the corn planter around here but if we give here's some new corn brother Paul go try it well if he plants it think figures he's going to get fig trees or palm trees sorry buddy it's not going to happen because the word declared it would be a certain way and we read there in the in the beginning was the word the word was with God and that that's a form of God that you're listening to this morning his word and that but the ability or the life that's in the water the life that's in the water the life that's in the water has now encompassed and is fulfilling what the life is all about and it's about Jesus Christ and so it is with every seed and how and that's why I wanted to read that that 12th verse because sometimes we struggle and and we strain and we get in the trials and you know even when God first came through Moses to the children of Israel they wanted to Stone the guy because oh he's got the power you know the shepherd guy comes down out of the Wilderness the prophet of God and declares Pharaoh let my people go and he's I'm letting your people go forget it what are you talking about fact we're going to take away the straw to make it harder to make bricks just because you're a smart alec he's he's talking to the you know the president of the the world so to speak at that time and he said well and so now the next day or however however long between those waves the people the children of us they wanted to kill him because what Moses you said we're going to go out of here and now life got harder we're making bricks without straw yeah and we have to go gather our own straw at night Egyptians aren't even going to give it to us anymore well it didn't look good did it but what happened it continued to move that's right and because of that there was this plague and that plague and wave after wave of the word of God starts through Egypt because it has to bring forth amen what that little sea was in the beginning to Abraham they're going to go down there but I'm going to bring them out and not only am I going to bring them out the purpose is I want to take them in somewhere else and God's word was bringing forth of its own kind transitively moving moving moving to create the image of which you saw and in verse 12 we read it there in John and for some reason it seems like when I hear preaching from the first chapter of John A lot of people kind of skipped this verse yeah but in 12 it says but as many has received him that's a person that's right it's not just going to church it's not just saying oh I believe a Bible no it's the person amen of the word of God who is Jesus Christ it's the person you must receive him the person of Jesus Christ and when you receive him the purp the person the life that's in the water of the word then what happens it says that he gave them power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name do you believe on his name today if you believe on the name of Jesus Christ the word is already transitively moved into your heart heart to make you Sons and Daughters of God have you received him if you have received him them gave he power you have power to overcome the trials of this life you have power to overcome the whip of the Egyptian out here this world that we live in we have the power imparted to us by The Living Water of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it's moving and the people people that I look at today you're not the same people that were here last time I spoke here a few months ago because your lives are different you're just a little bit higher with God because that power that's in the water has moved off of these Pages through the preaching of the word through the brothers through what you've learned through prayer and what you've learned through Christ you're higher you taking us higher and higher and higher as it says in the book of uh Isaiah I think it's chapter 28 it says it'll be line upon line line upon line here a little there a little precept upon precept and as we receive those precepts as we receive that line upon line even without realizing it sometimes you're growing you're growing into the stature of Jesus Christ transitively moving from the pages of the book through the speaking of the word through your prayer life from whatever it is every time it's God moving it's all Jesus Christ it's all Jesus Christ moving his life out of the bottle of these pages into our hearts into our lives so that he can prove that you have become his righteousness and with that I want to say it's in Isaiah 56 but he said that not only has his Mercy has his righteousness moved it was his righteous judgment his choice that made us it was our choice to receive it it was his choice to offer it and then somebody packaged this bottle and they put water in it it was their choice to package it amen it's my choice my tongue's dry to receive it I hope you're thirsty but there's not enough left in here for today sorry but it's the life of God moving moving from his word by his Spirit into your hearts and your lives so not only are we becoming his righteousness cuz it was his choice to offer himself to us it was his choice Amen to offer and it's our choice to accept the offer and say Lord here am I Hallelujah and because it was a righteous choice we become part of his righteousness hallu but there's something else that goes with it as it was his Mercy imparted to us we become the mercy of God to a dying world that's why a lot of lot of people think it's all in church no you know the the little lady there in I think she said she's from FY Al Alabama and we just got to talking about the gospel and W up praying with her what is that it's the mercy of God because he's still looking the mercy of God dwells in you and just as the righteousness of God has been imparted to us we are made righteous by the blood of Jesus Christ so is the mercy of God that comes with his righteousness through his choice through his desire to through Jesus God's desire through Jesus Christ to offer us the life of Jesus Christ if you can believe as it said in that 12th verse receiving him gives you the power that's because it's moving transitive out from as it were the Throne of God into Jesus Christ and from Jesus Christ through not you know a lot of times we say well I believe the death burial and Resurrection but there's another part because it moved again Not only was there a resurrection there was an outpouring of what we call the Holy Ghost that's it and as and it was the life of God because you can find it in the word in the word you can find it in Acts 2 you can find it in Joel too you can find it other places in the scripture where the life of God was moving it moved from God as it were into Jesus Christ and he became the fullness of the word he he paid for the whole law he paid for all those things because it was God moving God moving and how that after he paid all that went through death and becomes the righteousness of God to be be imparted to us through death burial and resurrection and pouring himself back into US repent everyone he be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive it's moving moving through the body through the heavenlies through the outpouring of the Holy Ghost into our hearts that's right that we might show that we are the righteousness and the mercy of God every time we took you know I don't know what you did with the prayer requests this morning but every time we take those prayer requests what is that you are becoming intercessors you are showing the mercy of God by the love of God to take your time and your efforts and your words to say Lord remember this person remember this family remember remember you can still heal blinded eyes we talk about you know you don't see it so much anymore in the US as you do we go to these foreign countries and we see so many miraculous things that God does over and over and over because they're hungry and when you preach the word of God it says faith comes by hearing hearing by the word and as you hear the word you apply if we apply that and just pray Lord let that word become life in in me yeah let this water any no matter how small it is when he when he spoke that promise to Abraham look at it it's only you know two lines on the page but look what it became yeah it became a mighty nation that destroyed the greatest nation on on the earth at that time which was Egypt two little lines and it destroyed the whole thing and it delivered them not only out of Egypt delivered him through the Wilderness and into the promised land those that could receive it that's it so we see the life and the nature of God manifested praise the Lord are you hungry this morning well praise the lord well look at a couple of things quickly I don't here just to take up your time but we don't get here that often and I just long to see you stronger and stronger and stronger in the Gospel of Jesus Christ Genesis 49 if you want to turn to it you don't have to get up but let's just look at it because now it's moved from Abraham to Isaac and from Isaac to Jacob but it's the word of God moving and as it moves down through and it comes into Jacob and he's a he's a prophet as it were so he's a carrier of the word of life and as he's carrying it he knows it his time his stick's dry it's getting pretty dry and he knows you know I'm just about ready to give it up here but he calls all of his sons together and he begins he begins to pray a blessing on each son and the 12 sons that he have and he tells them there in verse 2 49 and verse two he says gather yourselves together here ye sons of Jacob har hearken unto Israel your father and then he begins to pour blessings out as it were and how that there is a nature in each blessing and how that that nature winds up pouring itself into those those those sons of his and he talks of Reuben first and then he speaks of Simeon and Levi in verse 5 and how that he says in verse 5 instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations and he talks about that in verse six it says how in their anger they slew a man well you go back and read about it they slew a bunch of men actually because it was when their sister Dina had been defiled and they they wiped out a whole town of people because that was what was in their heart as they were to do and we look at that and that light life that was in them when this prophecy is coming forth about Simeon and Levi it's not just there that this shows up because when you travel ahead as it this word begins to move through time and it moves through 400 plus years of time and it lands on another son of Levi because when it talks about Moses it said he's from he's a from the tribe of Levi from a levite father and a levite mother and God takes that Spirit or that nature of as it were slay slaying a man and he go when he goes to Egypt he slays the whole the firstborn of the whole country because that was the life that was in him by way of the prophecy manifesting 400 years later and it doesn't stop there it continues to move on through time until eventually it comes to the days of Jesus Christ and what happens it was the Levites or the priesthood that slew Jesus Christ that's right because the nature of the prophecy was planted right there in seed form right there you slew a man and you dig down a wall and it was that spirit in Levi but don't don't think there's it's a problem for God because in Zachariah it says I will purify the sons of Levi another seed that okay you served that purpose and now I have another purpose for you Levi because another wave comes in another transitive feature from the nature of God and now from the what we would say the Levites always tease about my levitical garments when we come to the pulpit but from this nature what happens life is now being imparted as it were from the seed to the people amen and we could run that ahead for those who know this of the message that was called uh the indictment where are they the most religious people the most religious Nation rejected or killed put to shame amen this word through denominational Creed in Dogma praise the Lord so let's just go look at one more and how that in the next one there in verse eight it talks about Judah Judah Thou Art he who thine Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee well he's talking about Judah correct Judah you're the one and your brothers brothers are going to praise you your hand will be in the neck of thy enemies thy father's children will bow down before thee who is it really talking about who is called The Lion of the tribe of Judah Jesus Christ so when we look at this what are we looking at well we know that David was from the line of Judah and his brother Brethren praised him after he slew Goliath which looking at the next line thy hand shall be in the neck of thy enemies you look that up in the Hebrews it means to cut the head off the enemy David had no sword he killed him with a stone what's the first thing he did he jumps up on top of him and takes his own sword and cut the head off of Goliath so it's the word of God moving in waves through history until his Brethren are going to praise him he cuts the neck off or the head off the enemy and their children will bow down before the you follow that through I want to say to uh into Chronicles and again it's moving moving moving and as it moves in the Chronicles when David they come to him and they say we we want to make you King David over all of it not just Judah but over all of Israel and they come and they bow down before him because that's part of the seed that's the growth process of the seed but what's the fullness of the seed was Jesus Christ Christ because we praise him I heard you sing a song We Praise You Lord Jesus and he cuts the head off your enemy of the world your enemies of this life and gives you the power the Resurrection The Power the righteousness of God the mercies of God so that you can cut the head off the Enemy by using the word of God Amen and at the end what happens every knee shall bow and every tongue confess amen that Jesus Christ is Lord that's right so you see the life moving transitively wave after wave through history well I don't know how long it's been let's look at Leviticus 24 for just a moment let's praying last night and this morning saying Lord spoken and so many different services and brother brandom said he used to look at his notes before he'd get up to speak and I was looking how many notes I got oh man I didn't know where to start but in Leviticus 24 and I never seen this this morning till I listening and reading to the word and the Lord spake unto Moses saying so what just happened the Lord spoke to Moses the Lord that's Elohim the self-existent one gives speech or speaks words to Moses because it says he was saying something to Moses so it's the same as the word of the Lord came to Moses amen and he's speaking to Moses then he says in verse two command the children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light to cause the lamps to burn continually Jesus Christ is in every verse somehow I wish I could brother deard I wish I could do a lot better but it's all Jesus Christ so what's he saying these word this word of the Lord that comes to Israel I like this part because I don't have you know I can point to things and how that this word of the Lord comes to Israel and he says bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light right to cause the lamps to burn continually so what is happening in this verse that points us to Jesus Christ they have to bring pure olive oil and that olive oil has to be beaten and it has a purpose it's to bring forth light so that the lamps can burn continually so what are the missing pieces or what we would call the seventh seal what is it the they're going to bring this this pure olive oil that's been beaten I don't know if I remember maybe you get didn't get a see it or maybe you did in Israel where they take the Olive and they put them on a big rock kind of a table and then they have a giant stone with a stick through it and they they push it and they roll it and it crushes the olives it crushes those olives and from and that's why when you go to the market make sure you get the one that says pure virgin olive oil because that's the first press and after they've gone around once and they take that first pure oil from the olive then they go around and around and around until there's no more oil in the olives but he said there got to be pure olive oil it's the one that's beaten that's crushed Y and the reason it's crushed is to bring forth light that's right unto the lamps no you not you're the lamps of of the Gospel right right and so this is pointing us to Jesus Christ in our day that's right the Jesus Christ that was beaten and crushed as the olive he was crushed to bring forth the oil to put in your lamps so that we can burn continually in the presence of God so that you Jesus said are the light of the world it's pointing to Jesus Christ amen and how what I I don't see how what how you can make it any way other but then it continues in verse three he said without the veil of the testimony in the Tabernacle of the congregation shall a Aaron order it from the evening until the morning before the Lord continually it shall be a statute forever in your generation so what's happening here this light for the it's for a testimony in the Tabernacle of the congregation know you not you're the Tabernacles of the Holy Ghost so this light is to go into us and Aaron which is a levite is going to order it from the evening until the morning before the Lord continually what are we talking about we just came from an evening time message in evening time light and then after the seals have been opened what do we hear it is the rising of the sun right so from the evening until the morning this is talking about you and I right now you go before the Lord continually and that's a statute or like a written thing out of the rock into us for all all generations amen praise the Lord so we'll close Lord willing thinking about those CR that crushed Olive and we're told that job is actually the oldest book in the Bible and that from Genesis Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy those were all written by Moses kind of after the fact but in job from the oldest book of the Bible in chapter 19 and I think we probably covered this before but as I said it comes in waves and the Lord just was opening up something to us here recently think maybe when I was in El Salvador in job 19 we'll start at verse 23 Brothers thank you now we know that job has been going through oh man you think you got a try out let's try uh boil some the top of your head to the bottoms of your feet you can't walk you can't sit down because he's got boils everywhere so he's going through some trials right and we know that from Job chapter 1 it talks about when you know Satan went before the Lord and the Lord said if you considered my servant job and he speaks things about job he said well just keep your finger in kn 18 but look at verse chapter 1 it said uh in verse 6 job 1:6 now there was a day when the sons of God came to prevent present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and Satan said you know the Lord says to Satan where did you come from Satan answers from walking to and fr the Earth and walking up and down and it Lord says have you considered in verse 8 my servant job and then the word of God begins to speak about job I love this because the life that's in the seed comes by way of the word Jesus said Jesus in I forgot John Which chapter I think it's eight he said my word is a seed and just as this water was put in the bottle there's life in the water so there's life in the seed and the seed that's in the that God is putting into job there's nobody like him he's perfect he's upright he's one that fears God and hates evil what has God just done to job he's put the life of the word of God into job and Satan he doesn't think like we do he's saying well you let me touch his you know t touch him and he'll curse you to his face he doesn't realize the power of of creation lies in every word God says put your for put your hand now and touch all that he hath and he'll curse it your face and God said to Satan behold everything he's got's in your power and Satan said the reason he serves you is because you have a hedge around him we skip that verse but where did he get the Hedge said he had all those cattle he had all that stuff and he performed the sacrifice not just for himself but for his family well so what's the first thing Satan does he takes all his cattle takes all his beasts knocks down his you takes his family takes their houses takes everything that job has and going into you know that next part uh you know they came and they it says the there in verse 20 still in ver in chapter 1 then job Rose and ran his mantle and shaved his head and fell down to the ground and worshiped said naked I came out of my mother's womb naked I shall return thither and the lord gave what the lord gave he hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord and in all this job sinned not nor charged God foolishly did you ever think about why because he's perfect amen that Seed Life of God has moved or is moving wave after wave into the life of Job and first he loses the cattle then he loses his family he loses all these things but it said he didn't do foolishly because the life of God had moved from the word into the life of job but we know the trial continues oh he's got all kinds of struggles Lord be merciful to me I I've thought I had a few trials before and how that you come down eventually and it gets to a place to where there in verse n chapter back in chapter 19 you pull your finger out and how that he gets to the place and we know even as early I mean it it's all through the life of Job we find different types and shadows of Jesus Christ different types and shadows of our own age and I love this little set of scriptures because it's not only about the Jesus Christ of Calvary but it's about the Jesus Christ of right now yes sir and that's the one I live for that's the one I want to drink from Lord Give Me Your Life let the life of this book live in me Amen to live live in you so that we can present ourselves to Jesus Christ a body without spot or wrinkle but he comes to the place wow if we go to verse 20 you got to go to Psalms 22 so we'll start with 23 or 22 he says why do you persecute me as God aren't you satisfied with this flesh think about it job's you know he's been scraping himself with the broken vessel what so he's you know what's he doing with that broken vessel if you you know you'd have to go back some chapters and he's scraping the poison out with the broken vessel what is that who's the broken vessel Christ he was broken for us at Calvary so he's taking the the Christ of the Bible to get rid of the poison that's in his body why did he go to the ash sheep yeah why didn't he go find a nice cold stream this is what I probably would have done I'm looking for the coldest water I can get into but not job he went to the asep because the ashes were the only thing he had left that he could look at and say I performed the the word of God I know I have performed the sacrifice because at the end of the sacrifice they burnt the offering and they would take the ashes out the camp and dump him and job when he was in that condition he went and laid himself on the ash Heap because he said I know I've done the right the right thing oh if you've never met Jesus Christ ask him into your heart Hallelujah lay yourself in the ash Heap as it were of Jesus Christ perform the sacrifice in your life in my life that that word of of God can become transitive and move and move through each of us so he says why do you P you aren't you satisfied with what I look like you know I'm all scraped up I got black stuff all over me they didn't even recognize him when they first went to see him it said they stood a far off going wow is that job can you imagine what he smelled like you ever smelled one boil they think and he's covered with the things and so he continues he said oh that my words were written in a book oh that they were printed in a book job's a prophet and he says oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in the book did you realize in the days of job they didn't use books they used the Scrolls and they would take the Scrolls and as we get into the next verse they would take an iron pin and they would take the Scrolls and in a skin left over from the sacrifice you go back to Leviticus 7 it says the priest gets to keep the skin the priest that makes the sacrifice and job knew he made the sacrifice and he's laying on the proof that he made the sacrifice but they would take in that little chisel and they would chisel the word of God into the Skins I hope you're feeling chiseled this morning by the word of God God and they would chisel it into the skins and that's why the priest got to keep the skin of the sacrifice because he would use that skin to go back and look at the words of God and he said that uh written and all that they were printed in a book what is this we just read his words from a book this day that prophecy is fulfilled before your eyes he's a prophet and he's prophesying oh that my words were written they are yes sir amen and they're printed in a book amen so that we can read them and we become the beneficiaries of the prophecy of God that was there in two little lines and now it's being imparted unto each and every one of us more than just in the book amen but the words in the book placed before us by our eyes in the flesh through modern technology how be it it's still God moving in waves just about done if you hang on a few more minutes he said and that they were Graven with an iron pen and led in the rock forever well we know these pages are actually you know printed with lead by the way I suppose now they got different ways of doing the ink but when they first started printing them in book they had the old things in it would literally print lead into the into the parchments so he's saying oh that his words were Graven with an iron pin and led in the rock forever who's the rock of our Salvation it's Jesus Christ we know that you can read it many places in the Bible he said oh that they were Graven and then you're back to that little pen Graven with an iron pen and let me read the uh I wanted to get this definition right for you uh I guess I owe this to my fourth grade teacher because when you got in trouble you didn't get to go out the recess you had to sit in there and write out pages and pages of dictionary work I learned to appreciate words from the fourth grade on and what the definitions mean when he says iron pen there it's I know the Hebrews would laugh at me but it's beer ofi yeah for what it's word that's and it says it's an iron Implement and it has mult kind of multiple meanings when you think about Hebrew each letter has represents a number in Hebrew and each number has kind of its own little uh interpretation or its own little definition and so even he says an iron pen and it's used uh well we know that it represents Rome because in the Statue of Daniel when it came down it was you know the iron legs and then iron and clay at the end time and how that that was manifested in our day if you want to call it that now it's back in the 50s and I remember seeing it when I was a little kid a man named kusf who means clay beat his foot representing that beast in Daniel on the head of the Nations the United Nations and said we'll bury you speaking to the president of a country whose name Eisenhower means iron there's your your toes because from the foot you see how God's moving and from there we see all these troubles and problems and things going on because that beast in the days of Daniel had to be smitten in the feet with a rock UNH by hand who's the rock Jesus Christ being revealed to us in his word amen love him and how that it also means when it says an iron pan it means like we said a stylus a a an iron stylus usually with a d diamond tip so that they can ride in stone in metal or used as a marking stick or chiseled as it were into the we think the parchment or the the skins and so it's an iron pen and how that iron but it has a secondary meaning and this when the Lord by his grace shows us things my it says it's an iron Implement that's used for the lean olive tree and it's used to pierce holes in that Olive before it's crushed it's just a little like you've seen the ones they do with cherries right to knock the seeds out of the Cherry this particular one is in reference to the one they used on the olives before just before they crush the olive they remove the seed and the olive Falls onto the platform and they been begin to crush the olive it's Jesus Christ what happened Jesus said My Flesh profits nothing yeah my word is a seed amen what's in the seed the life that's right and the life was removed d by an iron pen from Jesus Christ because the word said he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed and all those other Promises of God that are now being manifest in us the seed from the iron pin the life was removed so that the olive can continue hence you're here this morning friends we're Graven with an iron pen and it had to be the lean Olive that's the first fruits of the Olive Tree because it hasn't had time to fatten up yet and it's the most healthy and that's where you get the remember Leviticus said it had to be pure olive oil because the pure oil comes from the lean seed and that's where you get what we call Virgin Olive Oil amen they remove the Life by way of this seed and then they crush the olive to bring forth the pure oil so that back there with those people the light has to be stricken with fire the oil had to be stricken with fire to bring forth the light and as you receive that Holy Ghost it comes with fire as it did in the book of Acts it's all Jesus Christ every word of this some I wish I could tell you more more more drink friends because he the life was knocked out by an iron pen in those feet in those hands the life was taken out so that he could be crushed and the Bible said he even went that life that was knocked out went to fulfill one last thing from the word of God it said he went and preached to the souls in heaven that's right for you and I in the book of Peter to show them this is the gospel you rejected that Noah told you about that Enoch told you about that job told you about this is what the life looks like and from there he was resurrected after he gave testimony right of the Judgment seat because he had become the Judgment seat of almighty God and the life was knocked out of the olive so that we could receive the oil we call it the Holy Ghost and that that oil can be lit by the fire of the lamp of the word of God we love you let's stand praise the Lord I love him this morning he's everywhere wish we had time to go into the the seed of David because we could continue with Judah we took three or four Services when we were down south about the life of David and how many places his life testifies of Jesus Christ how that the lion of the tribe of Judah had to go through all these steps to prove himself as the lion could we do that song again now that we got the words found I get the verses mixed up we get to those foreign countries I was telling brother Chris I think we did uh 13 services is in nine days in in Honduras and two weddings so praise the lord we uh and if we look around young brother Chris it's because of you it's an old stick you're looking at this morning but I'm hoping it's Buddy praise the Lord my gracious Lord Jesus as we prepare to sing this song Oh God just
