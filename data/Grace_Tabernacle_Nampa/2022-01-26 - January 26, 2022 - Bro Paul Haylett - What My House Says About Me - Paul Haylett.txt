can use me i give myself away i give myself away god bless you so you can use me [Music] what a heart's desire that is amen just to offer ourselves entirely to our lord jesus christ to be able to be put in service um after all my brothers and sisters every thing that god ever called us for he could have accomplished without us if he had chosen to but he said i want to make you part of this great plan of redemption imagine a god who doesn't just want to save people but he wants to bring you and i to a place one day that he gives us our own crown as a reflection of us crowning him the lord of lord and king of kings and he says i want you to receive this portion of the glory that i am because you are me you are the expression of what i wanted to express and therefore if i am glorified and you are in me and i am in you then you must be glorified saints amen hallelujah sometimes we have to just stop and ponder what it is that god's really really desiring to express in us amen um my there was something i was going to speak this is getting scary saints pray for brother paul you know uh yeah yeah literally yesterday i laid something down in my way so i wouldn't forget it and then i just stepped over it as i went out the door and uh so anyway we'll remember amen i want to speak to you this evening about we are witnesses once again amen this is what we are called for my brothers and sisters thank you god bless you um this is what we're called for and uh um you know a little bit of something that i kind of included but i didn't i've cut it away we'll use it but my brother and sister i just want to lay a little foundation before we go into our thought tonight remember now that if we don't worship if we don't praise god the scripture says the rocks in the mountains will cry out amen as long as i have a voice i believe as long as you have a voice those rocks will never cry out because we will be lifting our voice in praise to the king of kings to to worship him to give praise to him amen to glorify him and you know i just want to uh i just want to encourage each and every one of you uh that whatever comes your way whatever days bring amen let's just take time to lift our voice in praise amen let's stand as we go i want to speak this evening on what my house says about me amen so we will look at this and in the natural you could see that uh you'll find that people are attracted to a certain style of house and um in the natural they would look at that and say oh i i like this i like you know this kind of a rancher i like this a tudor there's not very many of those people around but anyway um you know it's just i i this what i like but we want to look tonight in the word of god and see what our house says about us and so as we'll look here we will we will see from the scripture we turn in matthew the 16th chapter and is this not working or is it just not turned on it's not working we have a major crisis amen god bless you brother alex good to have you home i hope you had a wonderful trip amen matthew 16 starting with the 13th verse uh we just want to uh then take so is this not working either okay it's just the operators not working matthew 16 13 amen when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am so here he is clearly declaring in these words who he is but he's asking the question who do men say now speaking to men saints he's speaking to you and i it's not a matter of what the world says but it does matter what we say it matters what our expression is and whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiah or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god now my brother and sister he was very very direct in that there there's just nothing to beat around there uh he he had revelation god had given that to him and he speaks it out thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven heavenly father we ask this evening that you would just bless your word let it come lord into the bedding ground of our heart and soul father just speak to us we ask in your precious name amen you may be seated saints brother david nash i would just like to say i really really enjoyed um your your thought that you spoke to us this last week i would have to say it's fit with everything brother david and brother chris has spoken i just felt like it was a beautiful extension of that and so as we'll look at that and realize my brother and sister the key components of the scripture are not there just to fill up the pages but they are there to express to us the whole plan of god being brought out now we understand that it is never the man uh and sometimes we focus too much on the man but it's never the man it's the measure of christ in the man and so as we'll look down through the ages uh that uh you know what one prophet said cannot be contradicted by another prophet's message as sister jerry shared that quote with me today going along with a little thought that we have been uh discussing personally between us and you look at this and realize my brother and sister as the scripture says from age to age he's still the same by the power of his name actually the song i guess is really what that most often is expressed as and you look at this from age to age we have the foundation that was laid and it's carried through and this foundation has been more than sufficient we've never had to knock the walls out never had to fix the cracks never had to fix the sinkholes or the places where the foundation was not sufficient but uh there we see that the word has laid a beautiful foundation and uh so it's a measure of christ that is in you and i that is what is important sometimes we'll focus upon ourself and we might have issues in life you know or things that we struggle to deal with feel overwhelmed but my brother and sister god didn't call us to focus on ourself but he called for us to focus on him and when we look at the measure of christ in us then we can realize that the the ability that we have has uh come short a long time ago it simply was not something that comes short as the pressure of the age has come upon us but it is simply uh been insufficient for the whole time so it's there that we often look and look through the word of god and uh people talk about revelation and uh you know every once in a while maybe you do too but i'll get these uh giant postcards in the mail about how they're down here at a certain auditorium teaching a revelation series uh they're teaching you how to recognize revelation how to receive revelation and so i find it interesting that typically in two or three services they're going to give you revelation but my brother and sister we know that revelation comes from god and god alone amen the prophet speaks of it in various fashions bringing that around but you see no matter how much we would educate or teach someone if god does not turn on the light amen then we won't have revelation we have education and so it's there that as revelation would come to sons of god as we'll look at uh simon bar jonas we'll see him here you know uh peter looking at this there was a revelation that had come in his heart and and we don't really see much in the scripture uh preceding this of peter really expressing this i believe this was an anointing that come on him at that season right god's always on time and come on him at that season and in that moment right there the revelation struck him now i don't know if you have ever uh uh you know have this happen to you i know as ministers it happens a lot that you'll actually be preaching your own ears will actually hear the anointed word being spoke and it becomes revelation to you in other words it wasn't preceding and you come and shared revelation but you spoke the words and it come alive to the minister right at that moment also so this is the moving of the holy spirit right in our midst and and it is not a old message my brother and sister but the deeper we dig into it the fresher it is and so it's there as we'll look at this uh in verse 17 and jesus spoken to him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven now as we live in a day that increasingly my brother and sister holiness is disappearing even in the uh you might say denominations that claim holiness if the standard is is declining it's going away but i stand here today under this word and i say anointed word that we have a revelation my brother and sister it was not an age gone by that is holiness but it is the fire from the altar of god cleansing us daily that makes us a people of holiness it is not of a doctrine we adhered to or a teaching under an individual but it is that fresh fire that is cleansing and preparing that brings holiness and holds it as a standard before us amen so it's there that many times people say well we need a greater teaching of holiness in message churches my brother and sister i tell you what we need is not a greater teaching of holiness we need more of the presence of the holy ghost in our midst because when the presence of the holy ghost is here we will be a holiness people amen it will not be something we'll have to teach to them because the very nature of the age that we live in is of spirit of rules were meant to be broken and so therefore as you put it out if the rules had worked there would be no new testament but the rules didn't work so we understand that it's not revelation brought by man and so some people get all nervous when we speak this way some people say you're leaving the prophet behind or different fashions you're doing this but my brother and sister you see there is very ample evidence all through scripture and all through the message by the prophet's words that you see it was never about the prophet it has been a spirit of the age that has made it about the prophet now having said it that way people say whoa whoa paul's no no my brother and sister we give honor where honor is due but the scripture clearly shows us and the prophet's own word says that this is not a man's revelation this is god speaking through the man and so as we stand upon that we realize now that a revelation is not brought by the man it's brought by the moving of the holy spirit and god then brings the word and lays it before the people by man to anoint it with the holy spirit that revelation might stir you and i to to rise up and move forward and claim our rightful position now i'm gonna take tonight and make a little parallel if i could uh tonight if you could follow me i'll try to to do this in such a way if the lord will help me to bring a little parallel that when we have a revelation my brother and sister that is a real revelation not a teaching not an education but a real revelation we're able to see this move out in all aspects of our life it is not then a revelation of jesus christ that affects us in our spiritual walk but the revelation of jesus christ spills out and that's who we are it is we are not one man in church another one somewhere else you know age old uh two soul doctrine that started years ago there were men in positions of authority that that simply could not live the word of god and and they had you know you might say a different nature that kept being expressed and they said well you know i i'm filled with the holy ghost remember the prophet of god said don't you claim you have the holy ghost claim or speak out the holy ghost has you amen because it's easy for anyone to say i have the holy ghost but when they come look what man did they said okay now none of us are able to live this so what we're going to do is we're going to take the word here and we're going to divvy it up and we're going to have two natures now and the the spiritual nature of me goes to church reads my bible prays and the carnal nature or man nature of me is then the one that can be very devious in business and crafty and all these other things and we've got it solved we've got problem solved amen who likes to solve a problem problem solved but you see by that very nature amen they had to defy as it were the word at some point there's no way you can find continuity in the word at this point so what i'm trying to lay out here is the fact that god always brings continuity through his word no matter what stage we are amen now in first peter the second chapter uh verse 1 through 10 and i i'll go ahead and read all this quickly i really intended to just draw certain scriptures but this will be good wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby now i want to take this down into the realm of a newborn babe you never saw a newborn babe say mom mom what i really want is this there is something down inside of them that they know that nourishment must be there's an instinct that says the nourishment that i need is already been given to me and so it is there an instinct that comes and they know that they can receive that at a mother's breast so it's there that we see as newborn babes in the gospel we have spirits in the day today and and you know if people don't like the flavor over here they know we can just go down the street or we can go across the country we can go around the globe we can we can tie into this and i'm not saying that it's wrong to listen to this stuff but i'm talking about in the fundamental as newborn babes that people are searching not for what they need but what fits them or what flavor they like and what they're comfortable with you know we don't need sometimes we don't need a comfort factor what we need is to become so uncomfortable that our life changes but look at the spirit of the age that we have it is so much into comfort everything from how they advertise what you drive what you wear where you live what you eat all of this is about the comfort of humanity so much to the point we carried it to church and said i want to be comfortable in church not being uncomfortable spurgeon said if you're not shaking the people up this is a paraphrase you're not preaching well i'll tell you what spurgeon isn't it good he's in a different age he's gone because he wouldn't be very well accepted in the day that we're living so as we look at this we see now as newborn babes we desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby if so be have tasted that the lord is gracious can someone say amen to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also see how the word now is drawing us and tying us right here together with christ with the word we're being tied directly to that ye also as lively stones amen so we have a living stone here that was disallowed but the life is in that stone so now we being in christ come as lively stones are built up a spiritual house i wonder what our house says about us you see my brother and sister we can be 50 60 70 years old and be immature christians and we can be 15 years old and have maturity that people will not respect or look to because they're saying there's no way this young man or young woman can have that kind of relationship but you see the house will tell us the relationship are built of a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture and behold allah and zion achieve cornerstone elect and precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded now we'll look in the world we're living in today my brother and sister and there's a lot of things that are confounding we look at the chaos that is coming and um how that by man's reasoning you know i heard a comment said about uh uh our current president and uh they used i would guess you would say derogatory terms not profane or anything but derogatory and something just struck me and i thought you know what uh as we look at that we we don't we're actually confounded right as just humans we're confounded by what is being done but when we'll step out of that into a spiritual realm and look at this and what the prophet of god showed us through the word we should not be confounded we should be able to look with clarity and realize here is the end that is prophesied and the word is bringing this to pass but just not in the fashion we thought so people are like well um is the scripture fulfilled already you know because there's many restaurants and places you can't go if you don't have a vaccine card so would that be not buy and sell my brother and sister the prophet of god showed us very clearly it's going to be absolute chaos it's not going to be inconvenience this gospel is not just a gospel of inconvenience my brother and sister this gospel said i've come to tear apart to separate to bring this so it has to come to pass so the house that is being built people are saying well uh what will we do uh will will god let us be hungry he let other saints through the ages be hungry could we be homeless he's had saints through the ages be homeless would we have to maybe as it were hide through the ages there's been saints that had to hide from the powers that be so my brother and sister when it comes down to it whether we react one way or another is going to be based upon the foundation that we are building our house now when i say build a house my brother and sister i'm talking in this you might say back and forth between the natural and the spiritual to see that but how we perform if you would use that word in the future is going to be based upon the foundation that we have built our spiritual house on so if our spiritual house is built on a superficial revelation of what this message of the hour is then we will be looking at that and always looking as it would for god to come and make it simple or easy for us but god never promised that it would be easy or simple but he did promise you would make it through amen now in god's only provided place of worship brother branham preached this on 11 28 in the morning 1965 coming right down to the very end of his ministry now i am not a person that is oriented to location or dates amen some people are like well it's extra special if it was preached in the tabernacle uh brother branham brought a lot of you might call the controversial sermons that he didn't feel like would be accepted out in the world he preached them in the tabernacle but my brother and sister he preached sermons all over our nation all over our world and each one of those was god speaking so they have a virtue or a value to us as believers so i just pray that you don't get caught in the trap of well if it was before 63 or after 63 if it was preached here or it was preached there it is the word of god for our hour amen so right here at the end and i said all that to say now right here at the end 11 and 28 getting very close jesus said i come in my father's name and you receive me not you want this scripture on that saint john 5 43 see i come in my father's name and you receive me not then the father put his own name which is jesus in the son and he's the way he's the door he's the house so we're building a house i hope you're all with me tonight okay we're building a house and he's the house but he chose to use this vessel your vessel amen but he's the house he's where god chose to put his name god never put his name in me he never put it in the church he never put it in the methodist baptist catholic but he put it in christ the anointed emmanuel and the name is in the word because he is the word and now we can well i'll just carry on amen what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god so anyone can then say well you know i believe in jesus christ where's the manifestation there has to be a life that goes with the belief or otherwise we have could as one minister said once brother branham has referred to it himself saying i know a lot of jesus so if we're not in the anointed word we're not looking at him as the anointed we can just switch that over and say jesus i work with one but you look at this see the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of god no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven hath revealed this to you who i am so this is not a matter of my brother and sister of us identifying that that jesus christ so yes here he is god in the flesh john 1 coming down and he mixed with us and dwelt with us and lived with us and and he suffered every kind of inconvenience and trouble and strife and temptation that we have and he overcome them that's good but we've got to come down and actually recognize who jesus christ is and the hour that we're living oh we've preached this to redundancy you might say but the hour if he is the house then where is his house tonight his house or dwelling place is in his bride tonight amen so he chose to be identified in her and through her that she would then become the manifestation of who he is amen so as we are building we are we are uh creating now we look at this my brother and sister uh uh in such a fashion if i could say remember now these lively stones are building up a spiritual house now remember it's been it seems like forever a month ago it almost feels like but we were preaching about joshua coming of who's going to serve the lord who's going to stand faithful and taking that stone and standing it up as a memorial and that being now the reminder now my brother and sister we know human nature some people they looked at that stone and it was there that they could just have a jubilee right on the spot praise god we are here i'm a testimony in my own life that we are going to serve god others it was a reminder that stirred them oh the world's getting a hold of me lord forgive me i want to come close i want to serve you i'm going to stand with this memorial others chose an entirely different path to come and go and live their life so they didn't have to look at that stone now i want to draw this and tie this a little bit together for you tonight you see the prophet of god talking about that rock and the wilderness he said you know they depicted as a little boy almost with a straw out of a rock getting a little bit of water but he said that rock right there while the rock itself did not look big was sufficient to provide for two million people and all of their animals so people are looking we need to build something great we need to build something big we need to have something we can boast about this is my church this is where i go this is what i support but the problem my brother and sister has just because it's big doesn't mean it will provide what you need and so it's there in the rock of the word that it's being poured out and sometimes in the small things right what man thinks is great god thinks is small and so it's in the small things sometimes you think about this we're building this spiritual house and so what do we do we labor for great things no the prophet of god told us do the simple things make sure that what you're doing you're taking care of the simple things in the building of this house so as we see it's there upon this rock i'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down now did you catch that first line my brother and sister what's being done he's building a spiritual house here but the prophet of god is speaking here in this context i'm building a place of worship that's not grace tabernacle we've been laboring different brothers and and whatnot have put their efforts in in the basement and and we're getting very close to fruition it's starting to look very nice my brother and sister this is not the place of worship we're building this is just a a building here on earth that god give us to join together but the place that we're building to worship is that spiritual house that has been built with lively stones that were taken from christ himself amen so you look at that i'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down that'll make us happy right there whatever satan does and tries to shake can't shake you down amen amen oh living church of god stand in firm foundation on jesus christ alone you can sing this song but if you're not on christ the word you're teetering faltering sand but upon this rock christ my word see there's where we're drawing our building stone is coming out of the word of god this is a foundation where the prophet of god said read your bible every single day because i guarantee you you read your bible every day in the right attitude the right spirit and you will draw another stone to build your house with amen now this is not i saw a cute little cartoon the other day amen it was uh it was what what are those little guys three little pigs and the wolf huff and puff and blew the one house down and and the whole deal and and uh and i thought how it's easy for the world to make a little sacrilege of this uh things and uh they said you know the the modern day wolf and he's there he's got goggles on work gloves hard hat and um a jackhammer because you see they want satan wants you to believe your house can be tore down he wants to place this idea in our young people and our families that your house can be tore down satan's got the tools wiley old fox whatever his name was in that deal he's got the tool to tear your house down but that's not what the word says saints we're building a house that cannot be destroyed oh i would encourage someone to say thank you lord amen this house cannot be torn down no matter what satan might do and how wily he is because you see this was a revelation as jesus is speaking to peter this didn't come from man this wasn't taught to you this was a revelation and my brother and sister a real revelation from god cannot be tore down now look if a prophet through the ages and declare the word way way way back and it comes down through the age and every prophet following that can only buttress or build up what was spoken in the beginning imagine now as it were now pardon me for using this reference but if it's been buttressed through the ages the word reinforcing the word the word reinforcing the word the word reinforcing the word and the saints of the ages testifying this is true look at the defense that we've got in this seventh age here in this laodicean time this word has been proven to be faultless without failure there's never been a time never been a season never been a ability for satan to tear the word down amen when he crucified jesus christ they thought oh boy we've got it now but my brother and sister i like some different brothers brother donnie reagan one time demonstrated it really well i always really appreciated how he did that and he said you know jesus christ didn't come down to hell like some people did think he did and start yelling i'm here but i'll tell you what he did he walked with authority he didn't have to say oh devil please get out of my way and oh devil will you please give me the keys to the kingdom he walked with authority and he walked right in there and they split before him because they knew who he was and he took keys to death hell in the grave and he walked out of there my brother and sister not with a please or a pretty please but he had authority and that is the same if you can tie this together tonight that is the same authority that you have been given to take the word of god today not satan please not satan will you allow not satan will you it is that we have been given the authority to act on the word to activate the word and bring it to fruition without satan's permission without asking him if he will cooperate but to stand firm upon the word of god now people will say well well these things then we pray for someone why aren't they healed never never forget we are still living in god's will people have an idea okay if we have authority then this we prayed for this person that we love dearly maybe family or something and and why didn't something happen well remember god's will must be satisfied amen so it's not necessarily what our will is but it is the will of god amen so he's laid this cornerstone in its elect and it's precious and and so he is now building this and as we look here my brother and sister we we know that this is coming to pass because every one of these stones has its place and so as it is in god's only provided place of worship you're familiar with the sermon if not haven't listened to it for a while read it listen to it you see what god is laying through the prophet right there is actually a very gentle reminder to you and i where the place of worship really is it is not within four walls somewhere it's not under a certain ministry but it is living in the presence being one with jesus christ being one with the word is our place of worship anything outside of that we can say well i belong to this message church this man is my pastor all of these kind of things they might be well and good my brother and sister but that's not where we were called to find our security our security was to be found in the word now matthew 7 24-29 and if it sounds like i'm hurrying i'm trying to therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them isn't it lovely how you have these little things that kind of set the stage you hear her and you do it i will liken him until wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended was that the trials cares of life the rain descended did you know saints i know i don't want anybody go home sad but if it rains at my house it won't be long it'll be raining at your house or vice versa right or both at the same time or maybe the whole church woe unto us saints it's raining yeah well i have an old friend he's mean one of his favorite phrases used to be life is short and then you die get over it encouraging right but truthful so what we want to do is we want to take what we hear and we want to put it into action because i want to be a wise man he built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock now look at this saints if you just give me a few minutes to elaborate tonight okay just homegrown stuff just something i've been thinking about for quite a little while here it doesn't say that it was built next to the rock below the rock it was built upon the rock now the problem is is we can come along my brother and sister and we can build something and the rock is an inconvenience to what we are building oh come on i tell you i just know way too many people that the rock has been an inconvenience of what they really wanted to build in their life and so they keep struggling with the rock and they keep saying i can't get rid of the rock and then i no it's this wouldn't be right if i got rid of the rock i was born in the message but i struggle with the rock and so what i want to do and forgive me if i i kind of tie back to some other sermons here but my brother and sister you look at this and it's there that he built his house upon the rock so there had to be a rock of revelation in the foundation of his spiritual house he didn't try to get around it he didn't say you know if we just kind of softened up this right here if we kind of softened this up right here you know we could you know there was a season i preached on that and kind of joked about that but if we would just soften up a few things my brother and sister we'd have a whole lot more message believers in our church look i know for a fact but i'll tell you what i don't want to see i don't want to see people constantly having to pick up the carnage of their life when the storm comes and everything falls apart we don't want to have to deal with that my brother and sister do we deal with enough of it is yes we do my brother and sister sister jerry and i noticed some neighbors are getting their house roofed and and jerry kind of jokingly said well it's probably good that they did because they've re-roofed it a couple times or three times or whatever it was already because every time we'd drive by they'd be shingles blowed off their house and boy the last time you want to see that is when it's raining cats and dogs and look out and the whole corner of the roof is all blowed away and it's like yeah i think i'd spend the money and roof my house because there's a problem here and we look at this and my brother sister life has enough i hope you understand what i'm saying life has enough of things that we have to pick up things that get tore up things that have misunderstanding and struggle and headache and heartache with without us building in such a fashion that when the rain comes it's guaranteed to collapse so it's there that the when the rain descended and the floods came the winds blew sounds like every every little struggle of life right there amen it fell not for it was founded upon a rock so here we have two verses 24 and 25 consecutive right there now look at this my brother and sister 24 says the house was built on the rock 25 says it was founded so it's one thing to build something without knowing why you built it or did it and another to know that the purpose that you founded yourself in this position of your spiritual house had purpose there was a reason there was an underpinning of that to to give reason for that now let's just jump over here real quick uh sorry i'm jumping back and forth second timothy 2 19. and it says nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity now iniquity the prophet of god said is knowing to do and not doing it and so we have a very clear uh picture in the word that we should be founding our house on the rock now if you don't have a revelation of why you're founding your house on the rock you may build your house on the rock but you're not going to build it in the same form or fashion you would if you have a foundation or an understanding now i want you to think about this brother chris preached easy how's it cost i really enjoyed that brother chris amen unfortunately i keep looking around thinking i want to take the cheap way out i don't know that's going to cost me too much but look at this my brother and sister here we are we're building the house wouldn't it be much easier we have an excavator it's so easy when the ground is all soft and so we have some sand you can just take your little gps stick and stick it in the trench and you can just carve that off and it makes you even look like a professional be all flat and clean and nice and tidy and you can just dig and you can do anything you want but was our spiritual walk called to be easy now i'm going to try and keep this short tonight so i'm going to jump over several little things i have but now we moved over here because we have an understanding or we read the scripture we need to build our house on the rock but you know to really build our house like we want portions of the rock conflict with our house so what do we do we drill a few holes we put a little dynamite in there boom we blow that chunk of the rock off we take a excavator a big excavator and we bang on it till part of the rock breaks away still not sufficient you see my brother and sister we tear one page or one word out you might as well throw the book away so the rock's still in our way and somebody's telling us it would be a lot easier to build your house if that rock was not there so we drill a few more holes in that rock we put in more dynamite boom we blow it up there now the rock is fractured and we can dig through it and do what we want to do but that's not what the scripture said the scripture said we should build our house upon the rock in other words the whole foundation that we would be looking at we can say you know what my house is on this rock and i will build my house according to what the rock has dictated not what i've dictated to the rock because you see what happens my brother and sister if you've ever been around these things when you blow the rock enough to break it to remove it out of your way you have fractured it and it might be many many years of moisture and movement and all of these hot and cold that comes and now the rock has become unstable and we wonder why people have followed the message for 25 30 or 40 years and then quit because they fractured the rock and now the rock has collapsed out from underneath them it is no longer a solid foundation that they could place their whole soul to but we know people i i don't want to go to names but we know young men and their family and what has happened and they didn't stop it we're just going to go be denominational christians they went right on past that and they have become uh what what are they atheists and agnostics and whatever it is you see my brother and sister why because the foundation got broke the rock that they were called to build on is now unstable and when they saw a fault here they saw a fault here they saw a fault here and they said this is not worth building on but you see they themselves did it because they weren't happy to take and mold their life to the rock they weren't happy to make their house you want to see a beautiful place i i don't remember the name of it quite a few years ago jerry and i was up in north idaho uh was that pandare or whatever where we stayed and there's this house there's a deal goes out and juts out into the lake and it's so beautiful if i if i had to choose a vacation cabin house something to share with all of you to wow you that would that would qualify this thing's out there just a little neck of rock goes out and they have built this it's not huge but i would call it a mansion right on top of the rock surrounded by all of the water and the waves and everything they didn't go flat in the rock they built their house upon it and it's been there for a lot of years and it's worth lots of millions because people look at that and say that is so beautiful you see there's an intrinsic value my brother and sister of us not disturbing the word to build our house an intrinsic beauty and value of building our house to the word no one's going to appreciate it except for those who have the holy ghost and they will look at that and say you know look at that life look at that person right there look what god's blessing them why because they built upon that rock on that foundation of the rock amen so this spiritual house my brother and sister when the foundation is is uh correct the foundation is sure we have nothing to worry about my brother and sister don't let anyone and i i'm not preaching that direction tonight but i'm just don't let anyone try to undermine your understanding your revelation that god has given you in the word of god don't undermine that to to that part don't matter this doesn't matter that doesn't matter because we have ample and i could just bore you to tears no doubt every minister here tonight could bore you to tears of those examples that we see that once the rock was broken it was no longer in man's mind dependable it was no longer trustworthy i found a fault in the word i found a disagreeing point in the word and then they'll come another and they'll come another so once again i want to reiterate to you don't chip away at the rock to accommodate the house make the house build your house around the rock see we can reason that if the rock was different it'd be easier to build the house come on saints it's the spirit of the age we're not going to go throw stones at other message churches or nothing like that but it's the spirit of the age we want to fill our church up we make it easier for them to come and be part of this but you see to truly build your house on the rock you have to look at the rock and say what kind of house is the rock dictating people don't like the term dictator did you know by all definitions in this modern day jesus christ was a dictator think about it one he says you know what if you hear it and you do it you're wise sounds pretty direct doesn't it if you don't well easy seems easy doesn't it but easy as brother chris so aptly explained to us how's it cost now going back to matthew 7 verse 26 and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened into a foolish man and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it you see my brother and sister we are in the midst right now of one of the greatest spiritual storms that has ever hit the earth today they've got everything from bill gates to warren buffett to whatever else is all the antichrist and they're there and these are people in sincerity they're they're sure that it's the money it's they're sure that it's here sure that it's what this is totally missing what the rock has already declared they built upon a church they built upon an ideology they built upon education and and they're they're missing this because they didn't build in the right place and what it's doing is making it unstable now my brother and sister i want to bring this a little bit close because some of this are people i would consider friends and my heart breaks but you see people are blown by doctrines the scripture says that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways and and people are are blown by doctrines and these doctrines you cannot even take them back to the word come on saints i'm going to tell you how seducing spirits can i don't want to get caught in a different conversation keep you too long tonight but you want to talk about what a seducing spirit is is when a spirit would convince you of something and the word speaks differently so all you have to do is go back to the word but the seducing spirit is so strong it will draw you away from the word because this man discerned my heart or they prophesied and it came to pass and all these seducing spirits that bring them away from the rock that's all it is saints i want you to put it in a simple context tonight these seducing spirits are trying to get you off of the rock to where you're next to the rock or maybe part of your house is on the rock and then if you ever add on you'll look at the difficulty of building on the rock and you'll go over here on the sand and you'll think but my house is anchored in the rock but it's not on the rock everything that's not on the rock is going to suffer the loss right so we look at this and see as it comes down it's going to beat on the house and it's going to fall now my brother and sister i want to just put this in context i love you very much and i believe we're all on the same page but the spirit of this day is going to continually try to seduce you to move off of the rock let's keep that in mind don't forget you say oh brother paul you say this all the time that's right we need to be reminded constantly the apostle paul you know i'm paraphrasing here but the apostle paul says just keep stirring up their pure minds just keep stirring it up that ain't saying well i stirred it up last week i shouldn't stir it up again no keep stirring it up because you see the spirits just want to move us off and we'll wake up one day and our house will be on the sand and we'll wonder why it is that well there's so many things i could say that well i just praise the lord see blown by doctrines come on saints we we've sought jerry and i sister jerry and i saw it in south america big time you'll be there one year these people are here next year they're down the road and you're like where did they go well they started hanging out with so and so and so and so is in this doctrine do you know if you guys really want to get into a couple things here i could set you up god's everywhere right he's even on the lake on sundays and we laugh about that but people fall under that spirit and they say it don't matter i can listen to the prophet and we can sit here and say oh okay okay that's just great it's not crazy it's a seducing spirit shifted them off of the rock into a man's idea and it appeals it appeals to us it appeals to them i should say i hope not us amen so it becomes unstable blown by doctrines you know what scares me more than being blown by doctrines is blown by the influence of friends the constant constant why do you believe that why do you do that why this and why that until pretty soon we decide we we're anchored enough on the rock the kitchen and the living rooms on the rock so when we added the great room and the five-car garage and all everything else in our life it's not on the rock but but we are anchored back to the rock i grew up in the message come on i just had a conversation just the other day and people putting it in that context saints well my grandparents knew the prophet that's good but what about you you can't find the rock in your backyard you can't find the rock nowhere in your life but you have this idea that because your grandparents had built upon the rock and trusted in that that it's sufficient but you see it's not see what happens is this revelation of jesus christ this rock gets chipped away continually chipped away and then the reasoning of our age will call to question the stability of the revelation now saints uh you go brother paul okay come on you always hit on that no i want it to be in your mind i want you to remember that when people start trying to chip away at this and kind of downplay this and downplay this there's a consequence of this there's a consequence our children can be a consequence our marriages can be consequent uh our own spiritual stability can be consequence because it's the spirit of the age that is working at chipping this up my brother and sister well you don't need to go to church on sunday just play tape chipping away we're in the millennium already i actually of all the doctrines there are i like that one probably the most because you see you get right down to the very core of we're in the millennium already get to the core of it not the surface stuff they throw out to you but do you know what they're really saying god's already sealed me i can do anything i want to do but you know what that really ought to mean can i take a moment and just give you what the definition of that really ought to be the millennia we're in the millennium i'm sealed i can do anything i want where's the throne i want to worship i want to live for him i want to give thanks to him give praise to him not we're in the millennium and i'm already sealed and so hey i can go do this i can go do this and i can go do this that i couldn't do before the millennium no i'm telling you my brother and sister the millennium is going to be sons and daughters of god on steroids hallelujah come on talk about what worship will be talk about what praise will be talk about what the presence and the life of christ will be that a millennium will be us on steroids amen pardon me for putting it that way amen now i'm going to just draw a little something real quick we're closing sister emmy come we need some insurance here in the way of a true prophet brother branham preached this in uh one in 1963. uh and i'm only going to draw just i'm going to read the whole thing but i really want to draw this one portion here and this here is i i'm not applying it to us but hey the word of god is always applicable look what brother brown says here now and go look this up so you get the full measure the governor government cannot build my remark was government cannot build upon iraq that the nation votes for sand look at our nation they came to a time they come to a place they rejected the word for their day the word to our nation they rejected it and now all they can do is vote for sand that's the only thing they focus on my brother put it like this while back he said uh he's a little older he's got grandkids and when he says you know hope the lord comes quickly because our children will not be able to pay for the indiscretion of our elders right that's what the prophet spoke about the children be paying they'll be paying way down there for what's being wasted right now so it's there my brother and sister we're not looking for an escape from a national debt this nation's already bankrupt i mean if you own 29 trillion or something like that or whatever it is you know it's bounced up real recently i like i like to i like to do math and numbers and money and things you know um you couldn't this is some mathematician guy if we handed you a whole truck of ten dollar bills you as an individual could not lay ten dollar bills down fast enough to cover your share of the national debt puts it in context doesn't it imagine how fast you can lay down 10 bills and you wouldn't keep up now we're building a house inflation cost of everything's going up my last and final question or statement to you are you willing to pay the price to build the house on the rock i'm going to lift my hand to the lord tonight and say lord i want to be willing give anoint me lord to pay the price to build my house on the rock it don't matter what the natural things are it don't matter what it is but we'll come the prophet of god goes on he says how are you how are you going to build your church upon the rock how will the preacher ever stand in the pulpit and preach the rock and build it upon the fundamentals of full gospel when his audience some of his people out there would put him out now i blame the preacher for not having the audacity and the spirit of god for just shutting the door and say yet somebody else will stand for that stuff not me i admire a preacher that would do that and i tell you what i admire more is a church that will stand on that word and build on that rock hallelujah aren't you glad tonight god's given you that heart that desire amen lord it doesn't matter what the cost is we're building on this rock and we will not only build upon this rock we will maintain that house that is built upon the rock hallelujah amen hallelujah well that just begs to sing the song anybody tell me what song it is on cross christ the solid rock i stand hallelujah let's just stand up and sing it amen saints i know this may be a little different or whatever um you know but just something i just want to delay just lay that natural and that spiritual type together and and realize it really does matter where we build it really really matters you know just in a natural note years ago i helped remodel a house many years ago i helped remodel a house along the boise river these people had built a house like 12 years previous and had to fix flood damage like six or seven or eight times the guy was like i'm getting really tired of this and i'm sitting there thinking i'm just a painter i work cheap i don't have sister jerry and i didn't own much but a wore out pickup in a car and a trailer house [Music] and i thought i'm bright enough how beautiful it is saints there's your there's your back door there's the river that's just so gorgeous i walk right down out of my house and step in the river yeah yeah god's given you a supernatural knowledge where to build your house how to build your house how to maintain your house amen we don't need the words of some man whose house has been blowed down over and over again we want to build our house on the rock hallelujah [Music] my full build on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness i dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy on jesus name on christ's solid rockets and all other surroundings sinking sand all leather ground is sinking sand when darkness seems to hide his face i rest on his unchanging grace in every high and stormy gale my anchor holds within the [Music] is sinking sands all other ground is sinking sand his oath his covenant his blood support me in the overwhelming flood with all around my soul gives way he then is all my hope and stay christ us [Music] sinking sand where he shall come with trumpet sound oh me oh yes lord that's our desire rest in his righteousness alone for us to stand be for the throne on crisis solid rock i stand all other ground is sinking sand leather ground is sinking sand hallelujah can we say amen tonight i pray the lord just bless this very simple thought to you that we would just judge everything that we do the things that we build in our life friendships relationships every portion of it that we take it back remember brother brown talked about building the bridge in australia they told that man he couldn't do it now sister jerry and i've had the privilege of actually being there and driving across that bridge and seeing what the prophet of god was talking about [Music] hope you catch this don't get scared don't let the devil bluff you that if the first thing you find looks like sand that man he dredged down there he dug down there until he found the rock and the devil will try and bluff you well you're building on the wrong thing but if it's according to the word you just keep digging there'll be rock down there you get down there and get anchored into that rock and that bridge i don't remember what they call it quite a sight quite a sight to see sister jerry and i didn't do it but you can take tours and go and go all the way up to the very top of that and you get to see everywhere and and whatnot still standing after all these years if the lord saints and i'm finished here the lord tarried another 50 years what will our house look like let's build it solid let's build it not sparing one expense one effort one labor that our house will stand the test of time god bless you i love you very much amen look forward to this coming sunday amen pray for the brothers you know you think about all the work that's been done we're getting very close i don't know whether to invite you to go brother sergey wouldn't even let me walk on the carpet in my tennis shoes i'd take them off and walk in my socks so i don't know if we should invite you down there or not but just keep praying motivation everything will work we'll get this done god bless you saints we shall see you this coming sunday amen [Music] so [Music] you
