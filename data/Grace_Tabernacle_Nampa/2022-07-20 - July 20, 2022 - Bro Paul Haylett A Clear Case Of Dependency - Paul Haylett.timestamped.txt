[31:12] [Music]
[31:24] and so we're looking there to be right
[31:26] in his eyes now let me hurry right along
[31:29] now look at this if i can just play this
[31:31] out if you would just be patient with me
[31:33] we see now what happened we see peter
[31:35] peter he's crying out to the lord you
[31:37] know lord if that be you bid me to come
[31:40] and jesus doesn't say now let me think
[31:42] about this for a while or see if this is
[31:44] that he just says come he bids peter to
[31:47] come and now look my brother and sister
[31:49] peter gets out of the boat now come on
[31:53] this boat didn't have a swim deck
[31:57] he stepped out of a fishing boat that
[31:59] was able to handle the storms
[32:04] the first step he should have just went
[32:06] under
[32:06] or at least that's what happens the last
[32:08] time i stepped out of a boat
[32:10] i went under immediately
[32:13] but what happens peter steps out of the
[32:15] boat brother trevor
[32:17] you imagine the shock it must have been
[32:19] to him that when his foot come down upon
[32:22] the water knee it didn't go to his thigh
[32:25] he was standing there the waves tossing
[32:28] around and he's standing on the water
[32:30] and another foot and another foot he
[32:33] moved off with confidence he started out
[32:36] he's looking at christ i just got saved
[32:38] and the lord's gonna just solve all my
[32:41] problems as a christian i got no more
[32:43] problems
[32:46] what happens is come on if this doesn't
[32:48] apply to your life i'll apologize but i
[32:50] don't believe there's a one here that we
[32:52] didn't walk for a season and then things
[32:54] started popping up in our lives little
[32:56] habits maybe come back up that we
[32:58] thought were gone because we're now a
[33:00] christian little things that would be
[33:02] there a little baggage that wave
[33:06] look at the size of that
[33:09] doctor
[33:10] bill
[33:12] look at the
[33:14] picture
[33:15] on that
[33:16] x-ray
[33:19] look at my
[33:21] situation
[33:26] he stepped out there
[33:29] do you realize at the moment
[33:33] you realize that the moment he was close
[33:35] to the boat
[33:36] he felt security if anything goes wrong
[33:39] i can always swim back to the boat
[33:42] but imagine if we can just picture this
[33:44] some people have in their mind he was
[33:45] two or three steps away from the boat no
[33:48] my brother and sister i believe that god
[33:50] has come and he's not here just to
[33:52] deliver us just because we're close
[33:56] he come to deliver us in every situation
[33:58] in every avenue and no matter our age or
[34:01] how many years we've been serving him
[34:03] and it was there that peter got out and
[34:05] you might say the cares of life got a
[34:07] hold of him and a circumstance my
[34:09] present circumstance he may be like some
[34:11] of you
[34:13] wait here i don't want you to be
[34:14] offended so i'm going to just come out
[34:15] here and sit down and i'll just say this
[34:17] some of you sitting in church tonight
[34:19] are thinking about
[34:21] tomorrow
[34:26] some of you in church tonight are
[34:28] thinking about
[34:30] well it might as well be yesterday it
[34:32] was earlier today but it's behind you
[34:36] many of you are thinking about
[34:38] what you should have said to your
[34:39] husband or your wife or your child or
[34:41] your parent
[34:45] sorry didn't mean to quiet you all down
[34:47] so much
[34:51] what happened
[34:53] peter's mind went from christ
[34:57] and went to his present circumstance
[35:00] and he didn't just
[35:02] i don't believe saints i feel strongly
[35:04] about this i have no way to prove this i
[35:06] don't believe that peter just took the
[35:08] next step and went under
[35:10] it started coming to his ankles into a
[35:12] calf to a knee to a thigh
[35:15] to a waste
[35:17] but in the beauty of this of what christ
[35:19] has done
[35:20] he didn't just go wow
[35:24] peter
[35:25] yes
[35:28] know what you do he says
[35:33] oh my i could just about get excited
[35:35] tonight
[35:36] amen
[35:38] we start to walk we don't do this you
[35:40] know what you know what happens come on
[35:42] saints i want you don't admit it to me i
[35:43] want you to admit it yourself how many
[35:45] of you have a safe place
[35:50] you have a safe place
[35:52] visiting minister comes and he preaches
[35:54] and you don't necessarily agree with him
[35:56] you don't go out on a limb and say you
[35:57] know what i'm just going to say i
[35:58] believe this the man of god i'm going to
[36:00] say amen to this no we we retreat back
[36:02] to the safe place
[36:04] say well i can just
[36:06] i can just think about
[36:09] tomorrow
[36:17] sometimes the safe places
[36:19] our own ideas
[36:22] i have a revelation
[36:24] i'm telling you if i
[36:26] literally if i could buy memory recounty
[36:28] all the times i've had people approach
[36:30] me and say well i i liked your preaching
[36:33] tonight brother paul
[36:35] i liked your preaching you know this a
[36:36] lot happens in south america or you know
[36:39] argentina and chile and i i liked your
[36:42] preaching tonight paul but
[36:46] this one little part right here
[36:48] that wasn't what we were taught
[36:52] well okay
[36:54] i'm not arrogant enough to declare
[36:56] you're wrong
[36:58] but i am bold enough to say
[37:01] i have
[37:02] i have
[37:04] what our lord jesus said and i have what
[37:06] a prophet said
[37:08] i'm not arrogant enough to tell you
[37:10] you're just flat wrong but i want to be
[37:12] confident this is something i'm going to
[37:13] put it this way i want to be confident
[37:16] enough to be able to say let's go back
[37:18] to the word and lord help me as we go
[37:20] back to the word to not bumble around
[37:23] because i'm nervous because of this and
[37:25] because of that but lord give me the
[37:27] right words and give me a courage bold
[37:30] to be able to speak the gospel of jesus
[37:32] christ with confidence
[37:34] amen so we start to walk we don't
[37:36] realize our safe place
[37:39] has to be left behind us
[37:41] so if you're tonight saints
[37:44] dwelling
[37:46] in a safe place
[37:48] i can't fully give myself to the lord
[37:50] because i gotta i gotta keep myself safe
[37:53] really i'm telling you
[37:55] it reminds me of a deal i've seen once
[37:59] the bodyguards there
[38:01] and and
[38:03] the the person that they're trying to
[38:04] harm is yelling at him why don't you go
[38:07] uh why don't you go get them or whatever
[38:09] and the bar matches
[38:14] i want to ask you
[38:15] if god said he'd be our provider
[38:18] would he not then match
[38:21] a provider
[38:23] he says i'm your healer would he not
[38:25] then match
[38:26] as a word use the word like profile
[38:29] match the profile of a healer
[38:31] of a deliverer
[38:33] of our savior
[38:35] of a bridegroom
[38:37] no my brother and sister we're not in a
[38:38] man-made message
[38:40] we're in a message that god's come down
[38:42] and he's proving to a people in this
[38:44] generation i match profile
[38:48] i match this word of what i said i would
[38:51] be and what i said i would do and if you
[38:55] will get out of the boat you'll get off
[38:58] of your own ideas of what it takes to
[39:01] make the rapture what it takes to deal
[39:03] with your situation and just keep your
[39:05] eyes on me
[39:09] because you see we live in laodicea
[39:12] a prophet said it'd be the most wicked
[39:14] age
[39:16] we have no clue we read the story some
[39:18] of them pretty scary
[39:20] but when you look today my brother and
[39:21] sister i was just talking with an
[39:23] individual
[39:25] it was a little graphic and i didn't
[39:26] mean to but it's true story
