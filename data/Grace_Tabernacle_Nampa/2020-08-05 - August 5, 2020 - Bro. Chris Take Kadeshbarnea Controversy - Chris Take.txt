so high [Music] the love of jesus oh the love of jesus is so wonderful it's so wonderful ain't that the truth that's all you need love of christ everything else follows right in line with that okay we are plagued look to the cross all right praise the lord you can remain standing and we'll turn in our bibles thank you musicians jeremiah chapter four amen it's good to be in the house of god again like jason was saying um the devil fought my day too and i knew i told my wife i said well just then we just switch to a handheld probably okay praise the lord the red one okay i gotta take the jacket off anyways i stole a line from brother jewel forney he takes his jacket off and says he can't fight and preach with a jacket on and i'm doing both tonight praise the lord and coming out swinging at the devil because he's defeated foe and uh when he's fighting it just gives me more confidence that god's placed the right thing upon my heart amen jeremiah chapter 4 verse 1 bible reads if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord return unto me and if thou will put away thy abominations out of thy my sight then shalt thou not remove and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in truth in judgment and in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they glory for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem break up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins of your heart ye men of judah inhabitants of jerusalem thus my fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings amen we believe that we want to circumcise our hearts with the holy spirit amen deuteronomy chapter 30 had to add i felt led to add this one in here because that verse in jeremiah ends kind of doomly but um we are children of the promise and i believe that as children of god we look to the positive we know what will happen if we disobey or if we don't follow god but as christians if our eyes are on the positive and what god will do if we serve him amen that is what we will fulfill in our lives so deuteronomy chapter 30 says verse one and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee and the blessed the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the lord thy god hath driven thee and shalt return unto the lord thy god and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soul that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whether the lord thy god hath gathered thee if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven from thence with the lord thy god gather thee and from thence will he fetch thee in the lord thy god amen there's some loved ones in the that have been driven out the outmost parts of heaven and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do the good and multiply thee above thy fathers and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live and the lord thy god this is the part i wanted to get to that verse six there and then onward and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee in which persecuted thee and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do all his commandments which i command thee this day and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand and the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus you know i am but a man lord jesus and you have placed something upon my heart and i asked lord jesus that i would not get in the way tonight father lord you have something you want to say lord jesus and father you have chosen me as the vessel to to relay that lord god and i want to be nothing but a microphone in your hands tonight lord jesus father my own ideas i put aside my own thoughts i put aside lorded strictly and totally you tonight lord jesus lord we take this atmosphere into the complete control of jesus christ knowing that father you have given us that authority lord and we stand upon that standing upon your word tonight father and know that lord that the devil will come and he will fight us but we have already been given the victory lord god it says it in the end of the book lord jesus and father i pray that you would come tonight and seal the deal lord jesus in each heart god that they would catch what you want to say tonight lord they would leave here a better person lord that they would leave here with a greater desire and a greater hunger for your word lord answers to their questions deliverance to their heart healing to their bodies lord we desire one thing only tonight is that that is to meet face to face with you lord jesus commit these words into your hands in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated tonight amen my title is kadesh barnea controversy there's a lot of controversies in the world today a lot of conspiracies but the kadesh barney controversy and um my wife was like you're going to put that in there my subtitle is the hill of foreskins praise the lord that offends you i'll go back to the bible praise the lord numbers chapter 13 so the cadis barnett controversy so we read here and if you want to turn to numbers 13 verse 16 you read here in um that god is is calling israel in the book of jeremiah calling them back and in deuteronomy saying if you will follow my words and you will he's desiring that that you return that they return to the lord and they keep with with christ and and i think just really speaks to my heart because it shows the heart of the father it shows the very the very inward parts of christ and that is he's longing to pull you in to himself numbers chapter 13 verse 16. so here we have israel and i'll set a back story a little bit to bring to your remembrance they've come out of egypt and they've reached the promised land brother branham says in a quote he says they would marry him and moses were dancing it on the on the other side of the red sea little did they know they were about 10 days from the promised land but they wandered for another 40 years in the wilderness and so it wasn't that far of a journey from egypt to the promised land and they get to the river jordan and moses sends out these spies from kadesh and they go across the river and to spy out the land and so we picked this up in numbers 13 verse 16 and these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the lamb and moses called oshia the son of non-jehosha and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether intense or in strongholds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and be of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was a time of the first ripe grape so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of zinn amen so they went through the land verse 25 and they returned from searching of the land after forty days and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel under the wilderness of quran to kadish and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land wither thou sentest us and surely it flows with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it so we'll continue reading in a minute so moses picks these 12 men and he doesn't just pick any old fly by night these are solid men in the community these are men that are well respected by those around them these are men that are looked up to as leadership and so their word held a lot of weight their word held a lot of moving power and so we've we continue here in 28 nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land so here they come with a report of yes the promises are true and the promises are there but and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of ainak there do you know they did no need whatsoever to tell to give this portion of their report i don't need to hear you tell me about the devil's strengths he has none because i have christ i'm fighting against the devil i'm fighting against we are the bride of christ fighting against the enemy we want to know how to fight him better we don't want to know how he fights us better amen we want to know his tactics and we want to know his the how he moves right you understand what i'm saying but we're not going around preaching the devil's gospel and that's what they're doing here they're talking about defeat they're they're they're they're there and you you you get this with some and i feel to say tonight i am not preaching tonight to any man or against any man or against any people but tonight we're preaching against those spirits that are behind what they're doing and so tonight i'm going to push aside my desires to to and in my self and just speak what god has laid upon my heart and so many times you have preachers and they'll preach and they talk about the promises of god but they always end it on the negative they always end it in defeat and you find a people in their church are full of defeat but if you can preach the victory of christ you find the people in the church in victory in christ because guess what the story doesn't end here in verse 28 nevertheless the people will be strong that dwell in the land doesn't end there we see god brings them through even their own mistakes as we'll find out they wandered in the wilderness god even brought them through that and joshua and caleb they lived through that and they come through and they still laid whole to your promise so just because you came from a bad church or you came from a bad situation or you grew up in a bad situation god can bring you through the wilderness in your life unto your promise why because there's something in your heart amen there's a token there's that seed in your heart that says i'm identified with the land on the other side of jordan amen verse 29 the malachites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and canaanites dwell by the sea by the coast of jordan they just blew the wind out of everybody's sails but verse 30 and caleb stilled the people before moses in other words everyone started shouting arguing probably you know how it is when you have a crowd of people everyone's quiet then you give the news you know say it's a big group of uh maybe it's a factory say we're gonna have to lay off 50 people i got the whole crew there we're going to have to lay off 50 people everyone's quiet listening and as soon as it says that everyone starts fighting and arguing and yelling and trying to point this guy down and and so here's the children of israel right you get under stress you've been here you ever been under stress stress am i speaking to real people tonight amen you get under stress you yell don't lie i know you do so here they are they're yelling they're shouting i i thought tonight when i read the scripture kayla must have had a big voice because he's still the people so he shouted louder than them let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it and that's the message tonight that is what you want to focus on you will overcome it verse 31 but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we why are they arguing against the promise there's something wrong in their hearts verse 32 and they brought up an evil report evil what is evil evil is of the enemy evil is of the devil so what were they doing they were preaching the devil's gospel underneath the pretense of the ministry of moses they were sent by moses to spy out the land and here they come back giving a report as a message believer saying we can't do it they gave they spoke whatever you want to call it they preached an evil report you say how can that be the man behind the pulpit you know i don't understand why can he preach this and and then all those years or this out of the other you sat underneath that and you say how can someone get up there preaching the message but preaching it under an evil report there's something wrong in their heart and we're going to find that out tonight by the grace of god and saying they searched under the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is the land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great statue basically they said the promise is good the promise is there but if we go after the promise we're going to be devoured by the enemy i'm here tonight to say that we're going to go after the promise we're going to be attacked by the enemy but by the grace of god he's a defeated foe and there we saw the giants and the sons of anac which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sights praise the lord the circumcised children of israel turned down the promise out of fear and died in the wilderness but god always has men like caleb and joshua and these men lived on through that 40 years there's always the other part of the story here we are we see these israelites 10 out of 12 say there's no way we can make it there's no way we can go across and take the promise it's too big for us i have a question for for them them israelites if they were standing here today and i had each of them lined up in front of me and i could speak to them i said i have a question for you gentlemen what is the alternative what do you have that is better than that what can you give me that is better than the promised land a new captain to take me back to egypt to bondage because that's what they say if you read on in the next chapter let us make a captain let us return to egypt return to egypt so that's funny two weeks ago you couldn't wait to get out of egypt now you get to where you belong because moses has told us and moses has been vindicated by god and his message has brought us to this place of crossing and now you say moses is wrong what were you saying two weeks ago everybody followed moses out of egypt [Music] it's not the men it's the spirit behind the man joshua chapter 5. i couldn't hardly contain myself studying this out as i i just wanted to stop writing it's good and i said no no no i gotta write the notes down because you get up here and you think you're all inspired and you get up here and you're like what was i gonna say praise god joshua chapter i'm sorry there's lengthy reading tonight but hey maybe some of you needed some extra reading today all right so that we discussed and we talked about the refusal at kadish they refused to follow god's promise they refused to act upon god's word we have a thing in in the business called an action item you have a meeting it's great you talk about a bunch of stuff but if you never decide on any action items everyone just goes away and does nothing but in the meeting you say okay paul haylett what action item are you going to take okay we write it down this thing paul haley says he'll have this done in a week right then there's accountability i'm sorry kristen i lost my train of thought praise god joshua chapter five so they refused to go across jordan and refuse to take their inheritance that's that's the crazy thing is it's like if if if i have this is my watch and sean has my watch and sean is six foot five 235 pounds lean as a whistle and i'm afraid of him sean's like that ain't out of that already i love you man and he has my watch and but it's mine and i have the ability to take it back regardless because it's mine he can be as big and bad as he wants but it's mine right you have ever desired to get it maybe i'll go get a few friends right but i'm going to find a way to get my watch back if someone steals your car you don't go oh bummer i lost my car i guess i'll have to walk to church i guess i won't get go go to work someone lost no you go to the police you start asking you start showing pictures you know like someone loses a dog have you seen my dog you see those pictures all over the place you're singing well maybe it's a good thing that dog disappeared you're going to look for it because it's what you lost that's what caleb and joshua had a revelation of this is something they lost this was theirs to begin with it was their promise it wasn't just something that oh if you want you can go and you can have this no it was already theirs and that's the way it is with you and i it's already ours and when and when you wanna when you listen and you and you take in and you feed on that message of well but the giants but you're you're you're the same thing as saying oh i guess my car's stolen chapter 5 so now we see the israelites the in the return to the river after 40 years of wandering in the wilderness and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which are on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel let me tell let me ask you something the bible says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you think the same thing would have happened to them 40 years prior to this when they crossed the river jordan yes absolutely see what you what you do is you look at it with your unnatural eye and you say i can't do this because because this will happen and this will happen and this will happen and i might lose my house or i might lose my friends or this over here you you look at it with the natural eye but you don't know what's around the bend only god knows what's around the bin and he's trying to tell you listen he can't he can't get up there and say okay listen if you go and you do this and this and this i will give you this and this and this there's no faith but what faith does is faith testifies to your revelation of christ and that's what god's looking for in his bride it's as simple as that although not so simple to im to him apply but god is gracious there i go preaching the evil report praise the lord god will teach us and he will teach us like a little child you can't tell them one time don't touch the hot stove and that's that you have to tell them and then you tell them again and you say okay now there's a consequence now when they go up to see the wood stove the hot stove they remember the consequence and they said i better not touch that okay if there might take a few more consequences so for some kids right praise the lord and that's what god does with us we have to we have to go day in and day out sometimes a long time doing the same dumb thing over and over again until we finally get it through our thick skulls what god is trying to show us but i believe that all things are done in god's timing and though the children of israel turn and walked away we wouldn't be able to use this example if they hadn't wandered in the wilderness for 40 years and god's done many great things praise the lord chapter five and it came to pass okay verse two and at that at that time the lord said unto joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of foreskins and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt them they had not circumcised the children of israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord swear that he would not show them the land which the lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead then joshua circumcised so they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised circumcised them by the way here we have these children growing up uncircumcised in other words not so much that you know there's coming a younger generation in the message that's going to take over that's not what i'm saying rather it's the fact that those circumcised israelites that came out of egypt you see you kind of begin to see why they refuse the promise because they didn't take the word and act upon it circumcision was as obvious to them as water baptism is to us it was what you did it was a covenant and in the wilderness moses lays it into the law in the book of leviticus on the eighth day the child will be circumcised they were given the law but many of them failed to read it surprise surprise so now you have and now they have these people that they knew the law they knew of the message of moses the ministry of moses and they followed him and then and they went across the river jordan but they never applied the word in their life had they done that their children would have been circumcised amen praise the lord verse 8 and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all of people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the lord said unto joshua this day i have rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day so there was no victory in the promised land until the circumcision amen all those born in the wilderness were left uncircumcised the lord raised up the old men of war's children to inherit the promise in their stand the bible says so god kept to his word because he had to have a group of he had to have israelites to invade and inhabit the promised land so even though there was error in their upbringing god came down and used that and brought them across into the land because his word has to come to pass praise the lord amen and the lord and the lord is raising up a bride so here it is it's not it's not that you know this guy had his ch his kill children and they grew up in the message so they're going to take over and that guy is bad no that's not what i'm saying god is raising up a bride to tear down the ideology and traditions of the message or religion from those who came out of egypt with moses am i am i preaching against men no no i'm talking about the spirit the spirit of let's organize the spirit of taking this thing and it now becomes it becomes just like the lutherans and it becomes just like the methodist now the word of god says it will will not denominate but that spirit still is trying to infiltrate and god is raising up a bride like we heard on sunday to push back and take down that antichrist spirit and in verse 9 we read here that it says i have rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you and gilgal means a wheel rolling and christ we know is the wheel in the middle of the wheel the center of our purpose the very heart of the matter the very reason we are who we are today and why we do what we do in him hebrews 4 12 says for now this is interesting because god is he's the very center of it right and he he moved that reproach he rolled that wheel of reproach off of them from egypt just like the stone rolled away and um and and god's always moving god's always moving god doesn't stand still god's always moving you know some of the when when when the um the british came over to america to fight the revolutionaries they stood up in lines in a field and were waiting for us to come out and fight against them instead we ran around in the trees shooting from different positions and we ran around behind them and we were hiding we were constantly moving and some as a kid we played hide and seek we played paintball we played airsoft and if you stayed in one spot you were bound and determined to get found and shot but if you kept moving no one could find you as well because right they already looked there so god right he keeps on moving and and brother brahm says you know everyone's looking to what god did yesterday and what god's gonna do tomorrow but they fail to do what he's doing felt against what he's doing today amen because what happens is you stop and god moves on past you but here we see that that god calls him across the river jordan and he says okay now it's time to circumcise them and the word of god the very center the very the very who of dividing of the joint and the marrow hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and moral and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen christ the wheel in the middle of the wheel amen praise the lord and then amen sorry am i clearing mine verse 10 of the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the passover on the 14th day of the month at even in the plains of jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land and on the morrow after the passover unleaded unleavened cakes and parched corn in the cell same day and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year after the circumcision they ate of the old corn of the land they ate of the fruit of the promise they were like john in the book of revelations eat the book sweet what milk and honey the land flowing with honey sweet in your mouth but bitter in your belly revelation only comes once you've crossed over into the promise which is christ there was no old corn wandering in the wilderness there was manna from heaven which was sustaining which wasn't very exciting adoption 1960 brother mum says how many's received the promise of the holy ghost oh aren't you glad that you're in the land over here now eating the old corn eating the strong things of god and got a clear understanding your spiritual mind is all unmuddled up you know exactly i love this i might even pin this on my wall you know exactly who he is you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you know in whom you have believed and persuaded he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against that day amen they had the faith under the ministry of joshua which is a type of christ the children of israel had the faith to cross the river jordan amen and because of that faith god recognized that faith in their heart and god recognized the faith in your heart when you crossed over and he gave you the holy spirit he gave you to circumcise your heart amen because that's what the holy ghost is that's what circumcision is there's a covenant with abraham saying god identified his faith god has identified your faith and he's given you the holy spirit crossing over means intimately knowing christ and your womb is sealed you couldn't tell those children of israel that crossed over jordan and begin to fight that it was too hard to cross the river they'd already done that they'd already crossed over anyone with a cl without anyone without a clear understanding and without a desire to change because we're growing in christ and without a desire to change there's no one a clear understanding of the open word is not eating the old corn of the land well that's pretty straight but that's the word of god how can you be eating the old corner of the land and you don't have a desire to move anywhere with christ you're a statue to old traditions you're a statue representing the antichrist spirit that's coming to divide and and conquer but it never will they're still wandering in the wilderness they have the wilderness version but i don't want the wilderness version because the wilderness version says i can't i can't i can't but christ is the cantor amen and now i preach the virgin i can i can i can praise the lord you see what happened moses introduced israel to joshua joshua to israel and then he passed off the scene joshua's a type of christ moses brought the children of israel to the place to cross and then he goes off the scene and it was christ or joshua that took the children of israel into their promise moses just brought them to the place to cross says this is what we know this is this is what it is the message of brother branham brought us to the place to cross he brought us the word he bro he tied up the other the loose ends he didn't but god used him his ministry and he's brought us to the place but now if you stay because here's the thing in this story we have the ending but this story is not completed yet yeah so now we have a little bit of a different version we have those in the promised land just like and those outside of it in the wilderness just like the the children of israel said we want to stay on this side we want to stay on this side and so you have people still in the wilderness and you over here in the promised land and that's why you know by god's grace we we we pray and we ask god to give those that we know more revelation but we're standing here looking across the river saying why take a bite of a grape this big why you don't want this right and bro praise god we're going to get to this part because you're eating it i'm not gonna get ahead of myself remember this big whole grape now circumcision was preached by moses but no israelite was circumcised under his ministry in the wilderness underneath that because no one can be can be can be circumcised underneath the ministry of a man it's not his his words it's not his preaching that circumcise you it's the revelation of christ through what you hear that circumcises your heart amen circumcision came under the ministry of joshua or christ right but you had to have the ministry of moses to bring you to that place the ministry of brother branham per se won't circumcise you that's why you have people that listen to it and they preach something completely contrary to it right because they're hearing words you say well you're making this up for the chris go back to the gospels and read about jesus and him him preaching on the shores of galilee and says them saying you're beelzebub i'm sorry he was in their midst he was christ brother branham was just a representation preaching christ just like you and me are but here you have jesus on the shores of galilee and these people are saying to his face you're beelzebub praise the lord but it was god but god's ministry amen began to bring out and call out those people right and then and then on the in the upper room god finished the work that he started amen his ministry or message will take you to the place of circumcision in christ i it's quiet tonight i hope you understand what i'm saying i'm not preaching anything new amen false teachings come from a heart that has never met christ face to face because guess what every word of god in the bible every word in the message together preached together every part every single part of that is christ and so if you've never met christ face to face say well my goodness i was at a camp meeting and i cried for 38 hours sorry did you meet christ that's nice did you meet christ and that's where we have a false representation of this and that's where god give me grace i believe with all my heart that the bride of christ is moving into a position where she can stand up and say that and not feel guilty because she didn't get all moved in the flesh but there's something in her heart and that's going to manifest into the emotion but there's something in her heart that says okay you look like you got it you act like you got it now tell me where'd you get it well you know this and and that and you watch their life and time will tell time will tell a lot of things and you see well they never met christ because we're not going to stand the bride of christ is it oh glory to god the bride of christ is christ to this world she's not going to stand and hide and say you're wrong she's gonna stand up and say prove it by the word you have an idea you have something in your life that you're doing that you think is okay prove it by the word of god amen praise god i don't care where you gate got this and i don't care how good it sounds and how many people believe you i don't care how many people believe you if 400 people walk off a cliff guess what you're going to say that was really dumb i can't believe they all did that i'm not going to walk off a cliff but yet you walk off a cliff in spirit in the spiritual because you say well this is him this is that guy this look at all these people all these people can't be fooled yes they can yes they can you uh you know you say well this this this great man of god told me this guess what if it's contrary to the word i don't care who he is it's wrong god calls us to check all things by the scripture all things by the word and if you get an idea i'm yelling because i'm excited if you get an idea from from listening to a tape as a preacher i do this all the time i hear that oh that's a great idea i go back doesn't line up with the word i throw it in the trash can because you're a human you're a human you're going i've had to get up and say look church sorry i said this doesn't line up made a mistake i'm sorry i read it wrong because i'm a human being but what happens is you get people full of pride that says well i'm a preacher i can't make a mistake or i'm a deacon i can't make a mistake i'm a song leader i can't make a mistake everybody knows the sound guys make lots of mistakes it's all their fault just kidding i'm just kidding that's just what everyone thinks praise the lord amen but it doesn't matter who they are you check it by the word and where you fall as you begin to follow man what did the children of israel do they they followed those 10 men they followed those 10 men praise the lord wandering in the wilderness will lead to death and death is total separation from god being blown about by every wind of doctrine there's always something new exciting oh did you see wow did you hear i heard it but i never read it not that i'm saying i hear something new and i don't go in my bible you know because i've already read it no you kidding me you read one verse five times a day for the next 20 to 50 years and it will be different every single day but not we are not we're not the bride of christ is not blown about by every wind of doctrine amen those wandering in the wilderness are refusing to accept the their promise those israelites that stayed on the other side and settled in on the other side were refusing to accept their promise because there was something missing remember i said the big grape you take a bite out of it you look across the river and you go out why i don't understand don't you see this grape john chapter 6 verse 41. i don't know if my wife heard me but i read this scripture and then i read verse 44 or something like that and i went up a couple verses and i got so excited i almost put a hole in my desk i slammed down on and i jumped up and i said oh god your word is amazing amen john chapter 6 verse 41 the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am the bread of life your fathers did he man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world they he was unrecognized christ right in their midst we know this man he's the son of joseph we know this guy he can't be christ he can't be the messiah he was the unrecognized christ they're standing on the other side of the river saying no no no that can't be a grape that that big because it's too hard to take the promised land that can't be it because it's too hard to go over there's that you know that's a small kind of what are you eating what is that a rotten gore they don't even see it right it's unrecognized christ right in their midst if you go down farther in that same chapter in this bout when we jump out of my skin god okay in the same chapter jesus identifies the pharisees as children of those who eat manna in the wilderness and died children of in the same chapter he spoke those words of separation to them and to the seventy that walked away two types of people the same spirit the inability to recognize christ in their midst the inability they saw it they walked with him they argued with him as there were the pharisees these disciples walked with him but when he preached the word the two-edged sword when he began to introduce the word unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood it that came the time of separation guess what 12 of them crossed the river jordan the 70s stayed in the wilderness and died they manifested that of their fathers well another place he says you are of your father the devil it's the same spirit and god was in this chapter god was exposing those spirits because guess what a devil is just like a cockroach you walk into a dark room you can hear him scurrying around all free will he but you turn on the light they freeze and then when they think you're not looking they run and hide well guess what tonight here i'm kicking all the lights in the house on i'm turning the attic light on i'm turning the crawl space line out i'm turning the floodlights on all around the house why because it's jesus christ in our midst and it's time we stopped bowing down to the little cockroach because guess what all you gotta do is go like that and squish him but instead you stand the other side of the door i can hear him it's really dark in there i can't go in there there's too many of them just turn on the light they'll run and hide amen christ in their midst unrecognized yet he was the very thing oh my the very thing these pharisees had labored for but what happened oh i hope you take this the right way what happened god turned things upside down sometimes god does things right in your midst that looks so odd and so off from what you think it should be somebody comes up or something happens or you get a uh the word or you hear something god does something you're just like no there's absolutely no way that could be god it's too it's too different but see what happened and this is probably farther on but whatever what happened was they listened to men but the twelve listened to god because that's the only way you can tell is this god or is it not you come face to face with christ and someone brings you something false you're gonna know it are you gonna know it right then maybe maybe later on when you go to your word but because you know christ you'll say okay i know i know my wife if someone stole her phone and texted me i know this is not my wife you know give me your social what what's your bank info right i'm gonna say i don't know who this is but this isn't my wife that's not how she talks you're gonna hear somebody talking the message oh it's so easy it's so easy to sound right but you can tell when you meet christ you can tell when you hear somebody just sounding right because why the word of god divides asunder to the very what why does the scripture say the joints and the marrow because it goes to the very deepest inner parts and says this is this and this is that brother branham says in god hiding himself in simplicity now notice moses in the day that god was going to deliver the children of israel according to his word what did he do he chose a simple family right this is what i'm talking about god is doing something a little bit different we have no record of them see just the son of levi is all we know see but it doesn't matter he doesn't say this but this is my words it doesn't matter if they're preaching christ if their life is displaying christ who cares where they came from if their life lines up with christ who cares what they did their life lines up with christ that's an important part because sometimes what you did before can affect today see and so we and his wife just an ordin just a ordinary probably a mud dauber as the world would think out there making bricks for the enemy he was just an ordinary slave in israel oh praise god god can take you from a place of making bricks for the enemy to being a leader in god's presence because each and every one of you is a king and a queen in christ we're all going to go over there on the other side and be leaders because god brought you from a place of making bricks for the enemy in egypt he brought you through the wilderness and across the river jordan and now you stand as a king and as a queen for christ your your past where you came from is gone but god chose that family to bring forth to deliver just an ordinary jewish family he never went and got royalty and celebrity or something or even got some priest he took a common ordinary family see simplicity notice what he done then he brought forth a child a simple human being he could he could have ordained the sun if he wanted to to deliver them he could have ordained to see but the sun can't relate with you he could have ordained the wind to deliver them but the wind can't relate with you and you can't relate with the wind that's why christ had to come down in a body just like ours he could have ordained an angel to deliver them oh hallelujah god can do whatever he wants to do well how do you know then brother branham see they were questioning him then god won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day it's got to be simple see now he always works in simplicity but god in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel or the winds preached the gospel or an angel preached the gospel but he ordained men for that purpose and he never changes it he never ordained him he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel not machinery mechanical mechanical devices or any angelic being it was man god chose man i'm not preaching against anybody tonight i'm preaching against those spirits that we see working in our midst they meant god chose god called men but but you see the thing of it is these men had to be harnessed by god or god was going to school them for them to see everyone in the in in in israeli camp knew moses wasn't allowed to see the promised land because he smote the rock they saw that they saw his humanness and they followed him because of his message they followed him because what he said and how he lived lined up with christ i mean what we have sometimes is we have people who just blindly follow men because they're preachers or blindly follow men because of who their family is or where or who their daddy is that we have people that blindly follow men without saying does this man preach christ and guess what no no no but no man anointed truly anointed of christ is going to make himself something he's going to get smaller so christ can get bigger and that's the thing if he's not introducing you to christ but he's setting up himself a dominion and the kingdom you need to find somewhere else to go to church if that's the scenario this can happen with just people you know in your life mentors that you know in your life can lead you astray even though they're not a preacher even though they're not a deacon even though they're not a pastor you always have to check everything back to the word of god but the bible says and behold the greater than solomon is here in 1962 god never used idols he always used man god don't use machinery mechanical devices he uses men individuals excuse me i didn't mean to hauler that loud i left that part in there on purpose notice i'm not excite i'm not excited though i know right where i am that's right i just feel good guess what if you know right where you are you're just going to feel good praise the lord joshua chapter 3 verse 14. and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the lord and as they that bear the ark were come unto jordan the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of the hardest that the waters which come down from above stood and rose up upon a heap far away from the city adam that is beside zaraton and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against jericho and the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on the dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the israelites passed over on dry god until all the people were passed clean over jordan just before this god tells joshua the priests will lead the way have them step into the water and when they do the waters will part and the children of israel can walk across into into the dry land now am i saying well preachers wow they're a special they're they're there's something above you absolutely not i'm showing you god's plan god's program is that a faithful ministry would bring the message bring the word amen god has ordained that to step into the river jordan but there's some that are out there wandering in the wilderness because they can't bring themselves to cat to bring themselves to accept the word and accept the the preaching of the word through a five-fold ministry so instead they sit and they dry up in the wilderness listening to just the tapes but god has provided a way now again this is not lifting myself up at all but god has provided a way for crossing into the promise for crossing into christ and that is behind the levitical priesthood not even behind they'll step into the river then the water parts and they were the last ones to follow right showing showing that they were just but servants preaching the gospel just a servant preaching the gospel it's nothing i don't get lifted up i don't get you know i anyways praise the lord the levitical priesthood those men preaching the truth those were anointed levitical priests so when they set into the river jordan when they picked up the ark they weren't killed because they were truth they had truth but the battle says in the patmos vision he says all right voice horrible what a horrible thing for a drifting soul on the sea of life no pilate to guide him loose floating with the tides to hear the roar of the great cataracts the faults what a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting voice the minis of many waters what is his voice it's the judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many waters cried out thickness and multitudes the voice of those seven stars in his hand every church age preaching the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues the power of god the resurrection of christ the second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters came forth from this one that looked like the son of man many waters what it'll be to know that you set in meetings and heard that you should get right with god and receive the holy ghost and a drifting soul to hear that voice speak out in that meeting that you said in and heard the judgments of god preached and refused it that's part of the problem with just listening to the tapes because that that that you don't get that because guess what believe it or not they pick and choose praise the lord amen judges chapter 6 so we're tearing down the idols of tradition the bride of christ is raising up the bride of christ is rising up with a revelation of who christ is and they're beginning to identify things in their life they're beginning to identify things around them that don't line up and by the anointing of the holy spirit they're tearing those things down even as we heard on sunday they're tearing those things down because because guess what anti-christ anything contrary to christ is antichrist doesn't have to be the pope and you know all that although he is because he's antichrist amen don't complicate it praise the lord chris come on amen so judges chapter 6 verse 25 i overthink things sometimes but not anymore i'm delivered judges chapter 6 praise the lord see you can preach a message like this as a child of god and all you want to do is shout but there's always somebody just squirming in their seat collar's getting sticky right because you're preaching right now i'm not saying there's anybody here i'm just saying in general right you know you think about it you say well you know if the preaching doesn't matter what the topic is if the preaching's hot go get whatever it was that was making you feel that way dealt with praise god judges chapter six and then it will just feel so good but then tomorrow morning at 4 am it'll be bitter in your belly josh chapter 6 25 and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him talking to gideon take thy father's young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and cut down the grove that is by him and build a altar upon alter unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night gideon grew up following this idol if you will because why gideon because we do and it's it's it's a bit of a it's a it okay just gonna say you have to you don't want to take it in the context of the world because they take this asking why i think way too far they want you to know you just go to church you live in a bathtub you need to be asking why well they're right you need to know that you know that you know that you're following the truth and so i had someone tell me one time when this was working at work and he was like well why do you do that and i was like just because that's what we do and he goes that's really dumb don't ever do things just because you do it ask why find out because either there's either a good reason or you'll find out there's a better way to do it and so here we have gideon never asked why do we follow baal well we don't know that maybe he was and that's why the lord came to him when he did but god called him out of that okay so here we are we're going to take gideon like this he grows up worshipping the idol baal yet he's a israelite living in the promised land but here it is is this virgin this religion that his father raised up and now he's serving it and he's he he's helping his you know his dad out and he and he's refreshing the wheat and everything and he never stops and says well why why are we doing this why why why why we're christians why are we worshiping an idol like this and then god calls him up and god says get rid of that thing so now we have him tearing down the traditions of his fathers the pharisees guess what jesus says ministry when he came to the shores of galilee did it tore down the traditions and the religion of the fathers and restored that and so instead of instead and what happened is gideon just just takes the word he doesn't argue with god doesn't say hang on let me go get oh this is really good let me go get let me he doesn't say let me go get another sheepskin and put it down and i'm gonna i'm gonna make sure you really want me to go do this no he'd already met christ he'd already proven god by his word that's what you have to do you have a question in your heart prove god by his word don't just sit there and think well maybe everyone's lying to me because i don't understand this and i've had no one explain it to me properly search it and search it and search it and pray and pray and pray do i mean do i mean spend hours combing page by no i mean search it in your heart with prayer and god will identify if you're not doing that you're wasting my time [Music] because that's what this is about this isn't about you just swallowing everything i've said tonight this is about you swallowing what you know is christ and going back if there's anything you don't know and double checking it and that's not wrong that is what you're called to do praise the lord i'm preaching to the choir tonight i hope praise the lord if you view christ through the eyes of tradition there is a good chance you'll miss him completely that's what happened with the pharisees god didn't come up and line up with their version of religion with their version of the message the will of god is to be searched out within the word you go to your pastor you go you get advice from men from god god called men anointed men but if that doesn't line up with the word it's contrary it's wrong don't say this man is anointed he must know the will of god for my life i'm going to accept everything he says and i'm not going to pray and i'm not going to search the word and what happens is sometimes you god calls you to do something and he put something in your heart to do and you pray about it and you search the word and then you go and people fight against that you see you need to know you need to know in your heart that what you're doing is god wants you to do otherwise you'll crumble right before that and then you sit and god makes your life miserable amen until you again come to that place where you separate yourself never let what never let what you think is your duty keep you from following christ all the way well i have to i have to do this because it's my duty so therefore it's the will of god no it's not no it's not everything you do in your life you need to ask yourself is this what god wants me to do you say see well it's my duty to provide for my family so i need to keep going to this job that takes me out of church for two three weeks no maybe you should quit your job and watch god give you one amen i i lord bless our pastor i've never heard that before well maybe you should quit your job god calls us to do crazy things can i share a quick testimony amen the other night and this is not to lift myself up in any way whatsoever but to testify of god god said chris give all the cash in your wallet so i gave part of it and throughout the service i thought well now now that wouldn't be from the devil and that wouldn't be for me and the devil started bringing up all the reasons i needed that cash and so i pulled it on my wall and i get i haven't put an offering for me i didn't and i felt god was saying again prove me amen prove it prove me do something that allows me the space to prove to you who i am that's what you have to do in your life you have to do stuff sometimes that sounds totally crazy just so god has room to move and do something for you and that sometimes it doesn't happen right away sometimes it takes years maybe you never see that return but god was teaching me an important lesson and just after that at work there was a situation and um i had there was i was underneath a certain what what i thought was an agreement with something prior to where we are now and and they are coming and they're asking for this thing back and and and and i really you know something that we needed that we were using and um the very next day i got a message you can keep it we're going to honor your previous agreement don't tell me that wasn't god don't tell me that wasn't god and then and then you watch god begin to to to move and so you've got to give god room to do things and you've got to do things that are crazy sometimes throughout the ages god has called men to do things that went against the accepted norm god is a disrupter you see natural always types of spiritual you have these things out in the world you know you know we go to i don't know if everybody if you've been to blaze pizza but the big thing you know go against the break all the rules unfollow the rules is their slogan natural types are spiritual christ is calling you to unfollow the rules of man and follow him i don't take that wrong praise god i just trust him that he he may have made that point the right way but sometimes god asks you to do things that go against what you know listen you only know so much you're in a little bubble some people's bubbles are bigger some people bubbles are smaller right you think you got it all figured out man hey this is what the world is everybody thinks this everybody over here thinks this okay let's figure it out man i don't need to i don't need you to tell me anything different because guess what my bubble encompasses the entire i'm sorry it especially doesn't if you were born and raised you know i'm kidding i'm okay right but if somebody grows up in a little corner of i don't know somewhere i'm not to pick any place because i don't want to offend anybody and that's all they ever know and they that they based on what they hear off of that my goodness help them lord but see we have christ and so god can can say that's why you can find somebody in a little corner of the jungle preaching about the open word because it's christ you don't need to go out there and and then google and read everything and travel to this church and this church and this church to gather and expand your bubble god will do that for you if you let him let me say let me say something this is just god put this on my heart you have to there's only if if you will say say what you have is a box if you will bear with me please because we're eternal being so but this is just to make a point god only has so much room in there if you will bear with me if you've got something in there guess what it's getting in the way god has so much he wants to
