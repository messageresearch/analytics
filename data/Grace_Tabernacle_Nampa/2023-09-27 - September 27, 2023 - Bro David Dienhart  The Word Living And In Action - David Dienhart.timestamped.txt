[25:47] hearing from The King The King of
[25:51] Kings we're hearing your voice and Lord
[25:54] we're expected to leave here and raised
[25:56] to a higher place and when we came in
[25:59] that's our desire it don't matter how
[26:01] many's here we're not looking at numbers
[26:03] it's not numbers where two or three are
[26:05] gathered together you said in my name
[26:08] that's a birthed word in my name there
[26:12] am I in the midst of them that's all we
[26:16] need to know all is well Lord we look to
[26:19] you you are a confidence you are our
[26:23] strength and we are totally dependent
[26:25] upon you not upon this man outer man man
[26:28] not upon what it is its feelings its
[26:30] reasoning its ups its Downs that's not
[26:33] who identifies us Lord we are identified
[26:36] in Christ the word and Lord teach us
[26:39] continue to teach us to rely upon you to
[26:42] walk in the light and live out what we
[26:44] are than you Lord and For Your Glory we
[26:47] ask your blessing upon the word
[26:49] individually personally yes Lord in
[26:52] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen if
[26:56] you'll turn with me and in your Bibles
[26:59] to Philippians chapter
[27:06] 2 I want to read verse
[27:11] five first here as we
[27:17] start my title tonight is the word
[27:21] living and in
[27:24] action the Bible bride you want to know
[27:27] what the Bible bride is she's the
[27:31] word God's thought expressed she's the
[27:35] word
[27:38] living
[27:39] and in
[27:42] action amen
[27:46] amen now that's a that's a great lesson
[27:49] and probably this probably will be part
[27:51] one I don't know I just have a question
[27:53] mark by it but possibly if we have the
[27:56] opportunity to come back as there's a
[27:57] lot more to this that I'd like to
[27:59] express and it's what God's mystery is
[28:02] in Christ we're just starting with this
[28:05] God has a mystery in Christ well I
[28:07] thought Christ was the mystery of God
[28:09] revealed that's right but there's
[28:10] another mystery in that
[28:15] mystery so I'll just let you chew on
[28:17] that a while maybe we'll pick up on it
[28:20] further we'll begin to hold it bring it
[28:22] in here tonight as the Lord allow us the
[28:24] time so verse five let this mind be in
[28:28] you which was also in Christ
[28:33] Jesus who being in the form of God
[28:35] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[28:38] God but he made himself of no reputation
[28:41] it took upon him the form of a servant
[28:43] was made in the likeness of men and
[28:46] being found in fashion as a man he
[28:48] humbled himself notice and became
[28:50] obedient unto death even the death of
[28:54] the Cross daily that should be our our
[28:58] walk we should take up our cross and
[29:01] follow
[29:03] him death to self Paul said I Die daily
[29:07] yes amen amen it's not my free thought
[29:10] about anything it's what he
[29:12] said and we have a message today which
[29:15] is the perfect interpretation of the
[29:18] word by Divine
[29:21] Vindication therefore that which is in
[29:23] part is done away because we have the
[29:27] perfect
[29:30] that's not my word that's a prophet's
[29:32] word you want to hear it he said this is
[29:35] verbatim I say verbatim but we read
[29:37] between the lines don't we because who's
[29:39] he speaking
[29:41] about we do have today by God's help the
[29:44] perfect interpretation of the word with
[29:46] Divine Vindication then that which is in
[29:50] part is done away
[29:53] with amen
[29:55] amen amen we have a word to make a
[29:59] Rapture in fact the Rapture is already
[30:01] begun but we have a word to change our
[30:04] bodies and it's working in US yes amen
[30:09] amen so we read that now verse
[30:12] 13 for it is God which worketh in
[30:18] you both to Will and to do of his good
[30:24] pleasure let's just read some more do
[30:27] all all things without murmurings
[30:30] and oh this is the good
[30:33] one
[30:36] disputings you know what causes
[30:39] contention I don't know how God's going
[30:41] to bring this and I'm just going to say
[30:42] what he puts in my heart to my mouth to
[30:44] say is that all right with you yes sir
[30:46] what causes contention is
[30:50] pride one element Pride causes
[30:55] contention instead of contention why not
[30:59] pray amen all right for it is God I want
[31:03] you to make this very definite for it is
[31:06] God which worketh in you
[31:11] yes I'm talking to bride I'm talking to
[31:13] seed tonight this which is God it is God
[31:17] which worketh in you both to Will and to
[31:21] do of his good pleasure now he's
[31:23] expecting some of something from us
[31:29] amen because it's himself
[31:32] working yes see Satan's quick to bring
[31:36] disruption and distractions and all
[31:39] these other
[31:41] things but I want you he wants you to
[31:44] realize tonight where your place is and
[31:47] what you're called to
[31:49] do we are actually called in this hour
[31:51] to bear his
[31:53] name the only way we could bear his name
[31:56] is be pregnated with with his life
[31:59] right amen so that takes the
[32:03] union now that's our day that's our hour
[32:06] we're in a maturing age time I should
[32:09] say we are in a maturing time which is
[32:12] called the bride age it's not another
[32:14] church age it's the it's the
[32:17] manifestation of the mystery revealed
[32:20] through those Church ages is now made
[32:23] manifest in the day and hour that God
[32:25] intended it to be because now the seal
[32:27] is opened and I'm just going to tell you
[32:30] the seventh seal is
[32:32] open amen amen and you're
[32:36] unveiled he's unveiled when he's
[32:39] unveiled you're unveiled and that's the
[32:41] secret the bride knows so now he's
[32:44] expecting something he's expecting you
[32:46] to live
[32:48] it why by realizing your position all
[32:51] right I'm getting to preach and I'm not
[32:53] having you seated so let me just go on
[32:55] that ye may be blamed do all things
[32:57] things without murmurings murmurings
[32:58] murmuring
[33:00] murmuring disputings that you may be
[33:03] blameless and harmless the sons of God
[33:05] you know you'd think after a while
[33:06] maturing in this word if you're maturing
[33:09] you would begin to realize you're
[33:11] murmuring you may be disputing when you
[33:14] don't need to dispute there's nothing to
[33:16] be discouraged about there's nothing to
[33:18] be disputing about just take it to God
[33:21] you know what brother Brown said if your
[33:22] wife doesn't isn't really good you kind
[33:24] of acting up or you other du to her what
[33:27] he ask you to do us to do Place

[33:33] heard him say that place
[33:35] God just put God before you put God in
[33:38] the in the matter Place God y I've done
[33:41] that Brother David then have faith to
[33:44] wait Place God and let him take care of
[33:47] it position it manif pray about it put

[33:52] Place God in the
[33:54] situation let the peace of God umpire
[33:57] rule your

[33:59] amen that you may be blameless and
[34:02] harmless as sons of God without rebuking
[34:04] the midst of a crooked and perverse
[34:06] Nation among whom you individual you
[34:10] shine as lights in the world bride you
[34:13] shine as lights in the world the world
[34:16] there is Cosmos
[34:19] mankind holding forth the word of
[34:22] life amen holding what your argument
[34:26] your dispute no holding forth what word
[34:30] what do you put it under who's the head

[35:00] the word the seed Jesus Christ the word
[35:04] living and in action now that word had
[35:06] to come from somewhere and it came from
[35:08] his thought and his thought was
[35:10] substance what he had in his mind he
[35:12] expressed in a word and it become
[35:13] manifest in creation amen that's the
[35:16] mystery of how God became from word then
[35:19] to become
[35:21] flesh all right he's interested now he's
[35:25] in you so he that is in you is
[35:27] interested in
[35:28] you yes all right all right he's
[35:31] interested in
[35:33] me and he's interested to see his word
[35:37] made
[35:38] manifest that's what he's interested in
[35:41] are we willing to meet his needs are we
[35:43] wanting and willing every day say Lord
[35:45] let me meet your
[35:47] need as a wife she she labors to meet
[35:50] the husband's need
[35:52] hello that's what she does in fact when
[35:55] she gets married she just submits all
[35:57] herself to him everything she has and
[35:59] yields herself to one man I've got a
[36:02] quote on that if you'd like to have
[36:07] it but what that's what we do he's our
[36:11] head we surrendered ourselves we gave up
[36:13] our own thing our own thoughts our own
[36:15] ideas our own things and gave it
[36:17] completely to him yes that's what our
[36:20] vow
[36:21] was amen I'm giving over to you and the
[36:25] wife's position is
[36:27] submission the husband's position is
[36:31] love sacrificial love I don't know why
[36:34] I'm saying all this but anyway I just I
[36:36] just I said I'm going to say what he
[36:38] allows me to say he knows what we need
[36:40] he knows what I need and he's going to
[36:42] meet my need every day that's my
[36:46] expectation all right because I can't
[36:47] meet my need every day he meets my need
[36:49] every day so he's interested in me he's
[36:52] interested to see his word made manifest
[36:55] I'm put emphasize on that he's
[36:57] interested in seeing his word made
[37:00] manifest and he's depending look what
[37:03] he's depending on he's depending on us
[37:05] to do
[37:08] it then we ought to be growing up to
[37:10] realize what he's depended upon what is
[37:13] he dependent upon he's dependent upon
[37:15] himself in you and you've got to
[37:17] recognize this is who you
[37:20] are that it isn't going to say well Lord
[37:23] is this your will you have his will you
[37:26] have his will right here in the
[37:28] word and he reveals it to you and you
[37:31] speak it whose word is it if you speak
[37:34] it in his name it's not David praying
[37:36] it's not me praying it's him
[37:38] praying or I shouldn't be speaking it in
[37:41] his name if I do that outside of that
[37:44] I'm just using his name in vain if I
[37:46] won't believe what I ask for and have
[37:48] confidence in his word I shouldn't be
[37:50] asking it because I'm taking his name in
[37:52] vain if I do
[37:55] that that's kind of striking isn't it
[37:59] see it's not just a play thing to name
[38:02] the name has a meaning the name and
[38:04] everything that goes with it I'm here to
[38:05] bear I'm his wife my wife is here to
[38:09] Bear my life it's a witness of me yes
[38:12] before the people I'm a witness of my
[38:15] husband that's what she is I'm a witness
[38:18] of
[38:19] Christ what am I I'm his word I'm
[38:23] Witnesses of his word all right so see
[38:27] so he's depending on us to do it for we
[38:30] are his
[38:32] agents wife see maybe better word than
[38:36] agents but that's what the prophet used
[38:38] we are his agents nothing in
[38:40] ourselves you can't relying upon a thing
[38:43] in yourself well I don't feel like it
[38:45] nonsense what is feeling got to give
[38:47] forth the sacrifice of praise
[38:50] sacrifice of praise whether you feel
[38:53] like it or you don't right giv him
[38:57] thanks anyway you're not basing your
[39:00] your your life upon how you feel and
[39:02] don't feel any given time that's not the
[39:04] inside man that's the outer man that's a
[39:07] temporal man that comes and that goes
[39:10] and I can't you can't base anything upon
[39:12] that you don't have confidence in that
[39:14] you have confidence in him that is in
[39:17] you amen that's right then we should
[39:20] take every circumstance and how's every
[39:23] circumstance controlled how's every
[39:24] circumstance mastered by this faith that
[39:28] he is in you unveiled yes amen you
[39:33] control it by that
[39:36] Faith amen what do that Faith rest in
[39:39] the word the faith takes this resting
[39:42] place God's faith will take his resting
[39:44] place in his word that never-failing
[39:48] Eternal Word Faith rests in that all
[39:53] right so he's he's he said nothing in
[39:57] ourselves it's him yielding ourselves
[39:59] and walking with him he's depending on
[40:01] us to work through
[40:03] us this is just this has just struck me
[40:06] put such a different mental at just in

[40:53] are people that are able to receive and
[40:55] hear the word for the season
[40:56] nobody else can do that but the bride no
[40:59] wonder the devil's fighting at you and

[41:29] to one of two Spirits you're either
[41:31] going to surrender to the devil's Spirit

[41:34] to God's power now that faces every one
[41:36] of us right here tonight which one are
[41:38] you surrendering yourself
[41:43] to all right and what's it going to take
[41:47] to surrender to the word it's going to

[47:31] messenger because the word came to his
[47:34] Prophet it wasn't the man we're
[47:35] worshiping that's not what that that
[47:37] Vision showed it showed that they were
[47:40] watching the word because they knew they
[47:42] had the perfect interpretation that this
[47:45] message was a perfect interpretation
[47:47] that would take them into the Rapture
[47:50] because the seals have been open the

[52:59] with well I made mistakes today not
[53:01] going to do anymore that doesn't have a
[53:02] thing to do with whether he reveals the
[53:04] word to you or

[53:09] position and grow in that position and
[53:12] mature in that
[53:14] position growing up why how are you
[53:17] growing up because you are laying in the
[53:20] Rising Sun in the sun well frankly the
[53:23] Sun is up so you're laying in the the
[53:25] presence of the son by
[53:27] Union you're laying in his presence
[53:29] we're talking about a union a marriage
[53:31] Union you're laying in the presence of
[53:33] the Sun and all the greenness is being
[53:36] baked out of you and you're coming to
[53:38] realize oh why am I

[53:57] I'm here to bear that

[54:02] have to pray stay in communion with him
[54:05] go on and eat and let him reveal himself
[54:07] and act upon the
[54:10] Revelation amen it isn't you

[54:22] to to handle this and what are you going
[54:23] to do about it he puts light on the
[54:25] light doth make manifest now you have a
[54:28] choice you're either going to accept
[54:30] what he does or disagree with what he
[54:31] does not accept
[54:34] it when he shows you what to do what are
[54:37] you
[54:39] doing that word is inside of you opened
[54:41] up will'll say Amen to that word yes
[54:44] Lord that is right you are right I aired
[54:47] I didn't mean to Heir God forgive me I
[54:49] place the blood over
[54:52] it because the blood token is in me a
[54:55] identifying I've come through that blood
[54:56] then the blood is my strength the blood
[54:59] is my power and I can apply the token in
[55:01] this matter under this air these things

[56:00] first
[56:01] seal he said thank God he'll keep her
[56:04] out of that because he takes her that
[56:07] bride out of here before that covenant's
[56:09] made that traps the Jews in the golden
[56:13] money I I don't have time to go into all
[56:15] that tonight I'm just saying that
[56:16] because we are very
[56:20] close the bride is in her matured State
[56:24] I believe believe that with all my heart
[56:26] and but it's not going to leave one
[56:29] behind we mature at different
[56:32] rates but the Word of Life still needs
[56:34] to be preached I still have need of
[56:37] Christ I want more of him and I want
[56:40] more of him until I see this body
[56:42] Changed by him and I will continue to
[56:45] need more of him and I am so hungry for
[56:47] more of him and he reveals himself so
[56:50] much I can't keep up with it anymore you
[56:52] remember brother brandom at the end of
[56:53] his Ser his ministry he said those
[56:55] things are happening so fast the
[56:57] Revelation I can't keep up with it I
[56:59] thought my I wondered about that I
[57:01] understand
[57:03] now right you can't hardly keep up with
[57:06] it he's opening it so purely and so
[57:09] perfectly and so personally to you and
[57:13] me and now he's saying I'm depending on
[57:15] you what I put in you I'm depending on
[57:18] this is who you are why don't you just
[57:20] go and live who you are well I I'll make
[57:22] I'll make I'll make them mad at me if I
[57:24] do that they're going to hate you anyway
[57:26] you know what the prophet said about
[57:27] preachers he said if you preach this
[57:30] word and preach what God put in your
[57:32] heart to preach today the people will
[57:34] hate
[57:36] you not everybody the bride will love it
[57:39] but he's talking about the majority that
[57:41] carnal believer that still claims to
[57:43] believe the
[57:44] message and he'll claim it until the day
[57:46] of his death a carnal and I'm saying I'm
[57:49] not declaring whether he's saved or lost
[57:51] but to be a carnal believer carnal
[57:53] interpretation is not going to put you
[57:55] in the Rapture it's going to take the
[57:58] absolute working of God in you
[58:02] alone and that comes through a new birth
[58:05] but you after your birth you have to
[58:07] will lay in the presence of the son and
[58:09] ripen into what he intended for you to
[58:11] be
[58:12] himself
[58:16] revealed that's his
[58:18] intent that's what he called you to do
[58:23] now I'm not getting to what I wanted but
[58:26] I'm going to let the Lord take his have
[58:28] his way Hebrews chapter 4 if you go with
[58:30] me over there just a
[58:33] moment I'll read that first then I have
[58:36] and this is very very
[58:38] familiar remember they didn't enter in
[58:40] because of lack of faith I could read
[58:42] all that to you but you can read chapter
[58:44] four then we have a rest that we enter
[58:47] into where we've ceased from our labors
[58:50] as God did from his he rested depending
[58:52] on his children to take what was he
[58:54] depending on then he depended on his
[58:56] children to take care of the
[58:58] earth he
[59:00] rested but now we enter inter rest allow
[59:03] him to take care of
[59:06] us but he's still depending on
[59:09] us to carry out his will but we can't do
[59:14] it in our own
[59:18] humanness wonderful I'm glad I can't I'd
[59:22] be so flustrated if I thought I could
[59:24] I'd be making so many mistakes I'd
[59:25] finally give up and say I can't do it
[59:28] and I can't but he has put his spirit in
[59:31] me and said I will unconditionally said
[59:34] I
[59:35] have I will already finished it all
[59:39] right so now you go back here to Hebrews
[59:42] chapter 4 and ver2 for the word of God
[59:44] this is what we're talking about tonight
[59:47] the word of God that's who you
[59:49] are isn't it wonderful to know that
[59:52] Christ is revealed in his own word yes
[59:54] amen who's his own
[59:57] word
[59:59] you you're the book you're the book
[1:00:02] within the
[1:00:04] book while I'm saying that just a moment
[1:00:06] here that wheat plant was the record of
[1:00:09] the book of
[1:00:10] life but in that book of life is a
[1:00:14] section in the wheat plant there's some
[1:00:17] that are saved some that are lost in the
[1:00:19] wheat plant what is the wheat plant for
[1:00:21] to carry the life has a way for the life
[1:00:24] to come through back to seed again one
[1:00:25] seed planted comes into many seeds of
[1:00:28] the
[1:00:29] same Source same nature is that right
[1:00:32] amen all right so the that's why I say
[1:00:34] the bride of Christ the body of Christ
[1:00:36] the bride the body is the complete or
[1:00:38] revelation of himself that's what the
[1:00:40] prophet said the Bride is a revelation
[1:00:42] of himself all right so then it comes
[1:00:45] back to that then then we have well you
[1:00:47] say if my name's on the book of life
[1:00:49] isn't that good enough yes and no it
[1:00:52] depends what section of the Book of Life
[1:00:54] life your name's in that's right is that
[1:00:57] right yes it is that's absolutely right
[1:00:59] I've just went through it two two
[1:01:00] sermons ago all right then it comes up
[1:01:04] there but in that book there's a book
[1:01:06] within a book yeah there's a record
[1:01:09] within a
[1:01:11] record the bride record is different
[1:01:14] than just you say the Lamb's Book and
[1:01:16] the Book of Life the same book it is but
[1:01:19] the prophet said her name is in a
[1:01:21] section and that record is eternal life
[1:01:23] record is eternal life section and the
[1:01:26] Holy Spirit bearing record of the word
[1:01:27] in you bearing record with your spirit
[1:01:31] identifies
[1:01:33] you in the record of eternal life for he
[1:01:37] that hath the son hath life and this is
[1:01:39] the record that he's given us eternal
[1:01:41] life that's 1 John 510- 12 yes the
[1:01:45] record that he's given to us the bride
[1:01:47] is eternal life and he that hath the son
[1:01:50] and he that hath the son hath this life
[1:01:52] and he that hath not the son doesn't
[1:01:54] have that life right how can you have
[1:01:57] the son by a word birth right okay so in
[1:02:02] the be so the word of God is quick and
[1:02:08] powerful and sharper why because the
[1:02:11] word in you is Spirit
[1:02:15] yes amen you just entered into rest so
[1:02:19] where's the word it's in you it's quick
[1:02:22] and Powerful amen
[1:02:26] all right and that quick and Powerful I
[1:02:28] read this for this purpose that quick
[1:02:30] and Powerful the Greek meaning is living
[1:02:33] and
[1:02:35] operative living and
[1:02:38] operative living and in
[1:02:42] action so so the word of God is quick
[1:02:44] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:02:47] two-edged sword Watch what it pierces
[1:02:50] piercing even to the dividing a
[1:02:53] suer and God help us to get through this
[1:02:57] part of it dividing a Sund of what
[1:03:01] soul the real gift
[1:03:04] yes and spirit little
[1:03:10] s and the two can be so close together
[1:03:13] under the same
[1:03:14] anointing that would deceive the elect
[1:03:16] if possible but we've had a message the
[1:03:20] soul has been opened the veil's been
[1:03:23] removed we see the real gift and that
[1:03:26] real gift is the faith of God that moves
[1:03:28] in you amen yes amen because the because
[1:03:33] because what does the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:03:36] is for to Quicken that seed germ in your
[1:03:40] soul
[1:03:42] yes and when that's quickened is Christ
[1:03:45] in
[1:03:46] you which makes you the complete
[1:03:51] revelation of himself amen
[1:03:55] you talk about a position brother
[1:03:58] brandom said greatest battle ever fought
[1:04:00] he said God's waiting for his his stars
[1:04:03] to get their
[1:04:05] position his
[1:04:07] sons amen what's the Earth waiting on
[1:04:10] for us to get our position what's what's
[1:04:12] waiting on the manifestation of the sons
[1:04:14] of God it's in labor pains for that
[1:04:17] actually I've heard it preached the
[1:04:18] other way too they're rejoicing over the
[1:04:21] fact that sons of God are being manifest
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:25] because they're rejoicing and jumping
[1:04:27] and and all this volcanic and
[1:04:28] earthquakes everything is jumping and
[1:04:30] and rejoicing that sons of God are
[1:04:32] coming to manifestation they're looking
[1:04:34] for a
[1:04:42] restoration they're looking for the
[1:04:44] manifestation of sons of God yes
[1:04:48] Hallelujah and here they are become what
[1:04:51] makes you a son the word is unveiled in
[1:04:53] you and made flesh that becomes
[1:04:57] son but the words unveiled in you is the
[1:05:00] Eternal and you're bringing forth an
[1:05:02] eternal son in you not out here this
[1:05:06] isn't this sun isn't Eternal right it
[1:05:08] will change to Eternal by the word
[1:05:11] living in me yes but I had a beginning
[1:05:13] and I have an end but because the word's
[1:05:15] in me makes me the son amen hallelujah
[1:05:18] do you understand all right that's how
[1:05:21] Jesus Christ was son he was God's the
[1:05:23] son
[1:05:24] yes cuz God was in him yes and his
[1:05:28] dependency was God in him what is our
[1:05:31] dependency he's depending on us what are
[1:05:34] we depending
[1:05:37] on oh my now we have a
[1:05:39] union now what's going to stop it what's
[1:05:42] going to hinder you what's going to stop
[1:05:44] her from
[1:05:46] manifesting what's going to stop her
[1:05:48] from walking into a Rapture can this
[1:05:50] upset and this downset and this upset
[1:05:52] and this downset no none of
[1:05:58] it all right you're not birth I have all
[1:06:01] these scriptures I'm going to bypass
[1:06:03] some of these but now but look at he
[1:06:06] dividing piercing even to the dividing
[1:06:08] aund of who you are and who you're
[1:06:13] not amen isn't that right yes
[1:06:17] unveiling the tactic of the
[1:06:20] enemy unveiling what's Spirit what's
[1:06:22] Soul yes
[1:06:26] where the real gift is how that that
[1:06:29] spirit that spirit that second realm of
[1:06:31] spirit can be Anointed with a genuine
[1:06:33] Holy Ghost and still not have that word
[1:06:36] abiding in you and still be lost if that
[1:06:39] word's in you it was placed in you
[1:06:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:43] that's why you have the ability to
[1:06:44] receive by Revelation the word for the
[1:06:47] season amen and that is your true
[1:06:51] evidence yes amen
[1:06:55] amen I'm trying to save time by not
[1:06:57] reading all these quotes I'm telling you
[1:06:59] the truth of what they're saying to you
[1:07:01] all right
[1:07:03] now John 13 said we're birthed by John 1
[1:07:07] Peter 1:23 said we're birthed by the
[1:07:09] word word Birth by the spoken word
[1:07:13] brother Bram said the word for the
[1:07:15] season
[1:07:16] spoken birs his
[1:07:21] children amen that's a spoken word birth
[1:07:25] he said the Bride is a spoken word birth
[1:07:28] because in your soul is a connector that
[1:07:30] connects with that word when that eagle
[1:07:33] heard that voice of that eagle something
[1:07:35] inside of him resounded to that voice
[1:07:37] because he was an eagle and because
[1:07:39] you're a part of that word that voice of
[1:07:42] God that sounds in this day you receive
[1:07:44] it because you're a part of it amen
[1:07:47] yes you hear
[1:07:50] it it speaks inside opens up
[1:07:54] what is that opening third
[1:07:58] pull opening of the word Satan cannot
[1:08:04] impersonate
[1:08:07] that he can impersonate any kind of
[1:08:09] action but he cannot impersonate that
[1:08:11] opening of the word in
[1:08:14] you amen amen amen that's hid from him
[1:08:19] it's been sealed from him and open to us
[1:08:21] in the end time because now he has
[1:08:23] nothing more he can
[1:08:27] do he's been unveiled his scheme's
[1:08:30] unveiled he can't touch the bride
[1:08:32] because they know who he is and how he
[1:08:35] acts and what he does and how he does
[1:08:41] things that's what the seals opened what
[1:08:44] have you been feeding on
[1:08:46] lately videos TV magazines pictures what
[1:08:51] I'm not saying those things are
[1:08:52] necessarily wrong if they're the right
[1:08:53] things but but I I don't have much to
[1:08:55] say with TV that includes internet I've
[1:08:57] already been through
[1:08:59] that okay
[1:09:01] but what are we feeding on what are you
[1:09:04] feeding your soul on what's the desire
[1:09:06] in your soul you can always tell what's
[1:09:08] in your soul by the desire you have and
[1:09:10] if you have the desire for more of him
[1:09:12] then go to the source am don't run away
[1:09:15] from his presence run into
[1:09:18] it yes don't walk away run into it Satan
[1:09:21] could to be right there with something
[1:09:23] else he that you should do or you could
[1:09:25] read something pulling on your flesh
[1:09:29] man so what is it going to take the
[1:09:32] strength of God to resist and say no
[1:09:34] you've got a
[1:09:42] choice don't let him distract you he's
[1:09:44] depending on us he's not depending on
[1:09:47] man he's not depending on
[1:09:49] David he's depending on his own faith in
[1:09:52] you don't let the Scarecrow of fear keep
[1:09:55] you from bringing the word in action yes
[1:09:58] from being the word in action don't let
[1:10:00] that scarecrow of fear of disruption
[1:10:03] don't let that scarecrow scare you away
[1:10:06] from taking a hold of that word and you
[1:10:09] stand right there I don't care how
[1:10:12] unreasonable it
[1:10:16] is boy I should have got some Amen on
[1:10:20] that amen because that's the truth
[1:10:24] I don't care how unreasonable it looks
[1:10:25] like in your in your eyes in your
[1:10:27] feelings the word's the word right right
[1:10:31] and what do you
[1:10:34] believe are you going to be willing to
[1:10:36] take the word over your
[1:10:38] senses over your feelings over your
[1:10:41] imagination over your conscience over
[1:10:43] your memory
[1:10:44] yes are you either a possessor of the
[1:10:47] enemy's Gates or not those are
[1:10:52] Gates see Cas feel smell and hear are
[1:10:55] gates to the outer man imagination
[1:10:57] reasoning memory conscious affection are
[1:10:59] gates to the
[1:11:01] spirit but there's only one gate to that
[1:11:09] Soul all
[1:11:12] right
[1:11:14] now let's look at something here now
[1:11:18] remember this Christ in the true church
[1:11:20] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:11:24] Satan fights
[1:11:26] Revelation he'll fight it until he's
[1:11:28] cast into the Lake of Fire okay he
[1:11:31] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:11:35] people get the true
[1:11:37] revelation of the true church the
[1:11:40] bride or who you
[1:11:44] are and that and what she is if they get
[1:11:48] a true revelation of what you are of who
[1:11:50] you are what you are what you are he
[1:11:53] doesn't say say who you are he said what
[1:11:54] you
[1:11:57] are when she what she stands for True
[1:12:00] revelation of what she is what she
[1:12:02] stands for and that she can do the
[1:12:04] Greater Works she will be an army
[1:12:07] Invincible Army that's not able to be
[1:12:09] defeated do you
[1:12:11] realize that you're not able to be
[1:12:16] defeated how much better could you have
[1:12:19] it you're standing perfect in Christ
[1:12:24] absolutely
[1:12:26] sinless quit listening to the devil

[1:12:30] did this you thought this you did this
[1:12:32] you did this you did that you did this
[1:12:36] you I didn't do any of it because the
[1:12:40] word in me wouldn't do that and that's
[1:12:42] who I am the believer is Prophet said
[1:12:46] the believer is the faith of God that
[1:12:49] moves in
[1:12:52] you
[1:12:54] okay the revelation of God himself God

[1:13:39] ultimate that's what I believe that's
[1:13:41] who I
[1:13:43] am that's what I that's what that's that
[1:13:46] little
[1:13:48] wheel that everything I do everything I
[1:13:50] say I don't care how bad it is and how
[1:13:52] upside down it looks looks I'm resting
[1:13:54] in his ability to turn it right side up
[1:13:56] and put it where it
[1:14:00] belongs if I'm depending on my senses to
[1:14:02] do it you got
[1:14:03] Pride you've got a big head you've got
[1:14:07] you've got yourself in the picture
[1:14:09] instead of the
[1:14:11] word and it's going to cause
[1:14:15] contentions so one of us or both of
[1:14:20] us need to and I'm talking about between
[1:14:24] people I know what it is between God I
[1:14:27] need to die yeah cuz God isn't Pride
[1:14:29] it's not
[1:14:31] contention I have contention because of
[1:14:34] Pride but one of us need to die to
[1:14:36] oursel and forgive the other one and let
[1:14:39] go of it and pray together and put it in
[1:14:42] God's hands and go on and walk and do
[1:14:45] what the word said to do and said Lord
[1:14:46] line me up with your perfect will I
[1:14:49] don't care what it takes I don't care
[1:14:52] what it looks like I lose I don't and
[1:14:54] God gave his perfect will to that Rich
[1:14:56] Young Ruler said sell all you have and
[1:14:59] give it to the
[1:15:02] poor well I just got too many friends
[1:15:05] that look up to me you know and too much

[1:15:30] part you got to keep
[1:15:31] covered amen that's the part you keep
[1:15:35] covered by prayer when things just look
[1:15:37] like it's upside down take it to God get
[1:15:39] Alone by yourself whatever you got to do
[1:15:41] take it to the Lord say God take this
[1:15:44] thing out of me that wants me to dispute
[1:15:47] over this you know what I need to do
[1:15:48] what needs to be done you know what
[1:15:50] needs to be done with someone else or
[1:15:51] others or whatever just committ it to
[1:15:54] God I don't know how many times that
[1:15:56] I've committed something to God and let
[1:15:58] go of it and sometimes a matter of
[1:16:00] minutes sometimes a matter of hours
[1:16:02] sometimes a day or two and it's taken
[1:16:04] care of supernaturally taken care of and
[1:16:08] it's over
[1:16:11] with I know and and the greatest thing
[1:16:14] you have the greatest the greatest power
[1:16:16] brother the greatest pow as you have is
[1:16:18] committal to be able to commit things to
[1:16:21] the Lord now I'm going to probably run
[1:16:22] out of time I don't even know what time
[1:16:24] it is this thing not working all
[1:16:28] right okay now so if they get a true
[1:16:31] revelation of the see of those two
[1:16:34] spirits and don't put it out here and
[1:16:36] say well two Spirits he's of that Spirit
[1:16:38] no you got two right
[1:16:41] here you've got a spirit man that's
[1:16:43] going to war against you you've got one
[1:16:45] that keeps him under control right right
[1:16:48] amen all right so so who are he's made
[1:16:51] us Kings and Priests but who are you who
[1:16:52] are are you given to rule
[1:16:57] over this boy yeah
[1:17:00] right they're the fault Lord uh Lord it
[1:17:03] wasn't me Adam it was my
[1:17:05] wife but you accepted
[1:17:09] it and it's put on your shoulders you're
[1:17:13] responsible for her she's not
[1:17:14] responsible for
[1:17:18] you amen amen amen but she's yes she's
[1:17:22] the one that fell why because she didn't
[1:17:25] she come under another headship instead
[1:17:27] of her
[1:17:28] husband now he's going to rule over you
[1:17:31] you are an equal basis now he's going to
[1:17:34] rule over
[1:17:36] you and you're going to be subject to
[1:17:38] him and if you really love him you'll
[1:17:40] give him everything you've
[1:17:44] got that's a broad statement but go in
[1:17:48] the message and find
[1:17:50] out and let him rule whether you you
[1:17:53] like the way he rules or
[1:17:55] not I don't necessarily like the way God
[1:17:58] rules over me I don't feel good by it
[1:18:00] sometimes but his but his leadership is
[1:18:05] perfect and if your if your leadership
[1:18:08] isn't quite perfect take it to his
[1:18:10] head pray over it commit it to God
[1:18:14] change him and if he doesn't change that
[1:18:16] doesn't mean you don't serve I'm going
[1:18:18] to serve him whether I understand or not
[1:18:20] and you serve your husband whether you
[1:18:22] understand or not unless he tells you to
[1:18:24] do something contrary to the word that's
[1:18:28] right you don't have to live that way
[1:18:30] because if he makes you go out here and
[1:18:31] cut your hair and wear your can't go to
[1:18:33] church and and wear your pants and you
[1:18:35] got to do
[1:18:37] this you're not subject to that because
[1:18:40] the Lord is your head above him but by
[1:18:43] serving him you're serving the
[1:18:45] lord brother brand asked the question
[1:18:48] should I my husband doesn't believe
[1:18:49] should I withhold myself said don't you
[1:18:51] dare withhold yourself
[1:18:53] self from him see see so we I'm getting
[1:18:57] on another subject I don't mean to do
[1:18:59] that I'm why back on that again but
[1:19:00] anyway let's go on
[1:19:04] here so Revelation is going to take the
[1:19:07] operation of the Holy Ghost it's not
[1:19:09] going to take ordinary study to make
[1:19:11] this book real it's going to take the
[1:19:12] operation of the Holy Ghost that means
[1:19:14] this book can't be revealed to anyone
[1:19:16] but a special class of people it will
[1:19:18] take one with prophetic Insight it'll
[1:19:20] take the ability require the ability to
[1:19:22] hear from God now I'm going to have to
[1:19:24] go on here pretty quick I'm not I'm
[1:19:27] going to bypass the evidence here
[1:19:29] brother Brandon thought it was love it's
[1:19:30] not love he said it's Revelation is the
[1:19:33] genuine of the evidence of the Holy
[1:19:34] Ghost is that he will teach you and show
[1:19:37] you things to come amen so and and the
[1:19:41] Lord corrected him on that amen that's
[1:19:44] that's found in
[1:19:46] 647 0726
[1:19:49] evening if you want to look that up all
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:54] let's look at this real gift a minute
[1:19:56] the real gift he said he said that the I
[1:20:01] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost now
[1:20:02] that's required we have to come through
[1:20:05] that baptism but the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:07] Ghost is the temporal gift to you and it
[1:20:09] makes room for something it makes way
[1:20:12] for something
[1:20:18] yes that has nothing to do with nothing
[1:20:21] to do with it it's a temporal
[1:20:24] gift for
[1:20:27] you see see why won't all people receive
[1:20:30] it it wasn't sent to them see other
[1:20:33] words receive
[1:20:34] it they had the baptism they can have it
[1:20:37] on their
[1:20:40] Spirit but that soul is the germ that
[1:20:44] Third Realm is the germ the Third Realm
[1:20:47] watch what he says here and I'm
[1:20:49] bypassing because I have a lot of I want
[1:20:50] to read some quotes out of Christ
[1:20:52] revealed his own word but I don't have
[1:20:54] time but I want to just I'll come back
[1:20:56] to that another time but you've heard
[1:21:00] those things anyway but here he said
[1:21:04] it's sent to them to those who will
[1:21:07] believe yes God gave His only begotten
[1:21:11] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:21:14] should not perish see there's a depth to
[1:21:16] that scripture that people quote it all
[1:21:19] the time and don't know what they're
[1:21:20] quoting because when were you a believer
[1:21:22] in
[1:21:24] him when were you a believer in him you
[1:21:28] were a believer in him before the
[1:21:29] foundation of the
[1:21:31] world yes sir there you
[1:21:34] are that's who he came to die for that's
[1:21:37] who he came to to to
[1:21:39] redeem yet he poured himself off for the
[1:21:41] whole world but not the whole world
[1:21:43] won't receive it who will whosoever
[1:21:45] believeth in
[1:21:47] him is that right yet he makes the way
[1:21:51] for everybody even Cain was made made
[1:21:52] the way
[1:21:54] for he could have come under that
[1:21:56] sacrifice without sacrificing well no he
[1:21:59] couldn't have because G God said to him
[1:22:01] he said if you'll do like your brother
[1:22:02] you do well you'll be accepted so he had
[1:22:05] to make the sacrifice but he wasn't
[1:22:07] willing to make that sacrifice why wrong
[1:22:10] seed yes sir so not all can receive it
[1:22:13] that's right some will some won't but it
[1:22:16] depends on the
[1:22:17] seed all right so he says here he said
[1:22:21] that's why he's saying it wasn't sent to
[1:22:22] them that are not the seed is sent to
[1:22:24] those who will believe the message is to
[1:22:26] the
[1:22:27] believer to them that perish it's
[1:22:30] foolishness what do you mean brother
[1:22:31] Bram to them this
[1:22:33] perish they weren't in God's
[1:22:36] thinking they weren't in the Eternal
[1:22:38] thoughts of God Amen but his bride was
[1:22:41] you were in the Eternal thoughts of
[1:22:44] God how do you know you've got the
[1:22:48] evidence you're able to hear or receive
[1:22:51] by revelation in the word for the season
[1:22:54] you respond to it and it lives through
[1:22:56] you amen and God's asking us to come to
[1:22:59] that total dependency and meet my need
[1:23:02] I'm depending on
[1:23:04] you you're my wife you're taking care
[1:23:07] you're serving me who serves her husband
[1:23:09] the wife the position of the wife is
[1:23:12] serving her husband then what are you in
[1:23:15] God's sight serving him amen do you see
[1:23:19] what I'm trying to say it's serving him
[1:23:21] who serves her husband he she does
[1:23:24] what's she meeting his need what's his
[1:23:26] need to glorify and manifest
[1:23:28] him fellowship with him he wants
[1:23:32] Fellowship he needs love he needs
[1:23:35] respect he needs reverence he needs a
[1:23:38] Godly fear of reverential respect and
[1:23:40] reverence to him that's exactly what a
[1:23:44] married life should represent and and
[1:23:46] and show is that very
[1:23:50] thing what' he do for you he's giving
[1:23:53] himself every day for you what do you do
[1:23:56] in return see you serve him by what I
[1:24:01] guess I have
[1:24:02] to I guess I got to go to church time to
[1:24:05] go to church no you serve him by love
[1:24:09] you love him and love creates faith
[1:24:12] without love there'd be no faith without
[1:24:14] agape love perfect love I'm not talking
[1:24:16] about
[1:24:18] fio you can love God through a felio
[1:24:21] love and love love him that's right but
[1:24:24] still be lost and go to hell you realize
[1:24:28] that because in your spirit is FAL love
[1:24:31] that love that that love can be in your
[1:24:34] spirit you can actually be baptized in
[1:24:36] your spirit have the love of God have
[1:24:39] love love that FAL Love Is Love of God
[1:24:41] too it's just a lower
[1:24:44] love are you with me it's a friendship
[1:24:46] love it's a human love God put that
[1:24:49] there brother Bram said God we have the
[1:24:51] love for my wife I FAL her I love her
[1:24:56] because she's my she's my sister in one
[1:24:59] hand but she's part of me she's my wife
[1:25:06] yeah but there's something that's got to
[1:25:08] be above that or I wouldn't have stayed
[1:25:09] with her for 52 years oh I might have I
[1:25:13] shouldn't say I wouldn't have but you
[1:25:14] see what I'm trying to say what kept us
[1:25:17] what's holding us what's holding the
[1:25:20] disruption because I love her I'm
[1:25:22] willing to give up for her I'm willing
[1:25:24] to honor her as a weaker vessel and the
[1:25:27] wife should be willing to say Amen takes
[1:25:29] all the all the stress out of it I can
[1:25:33] give myself up to my husband and he's
[1:25:39] responsible see it keeps typing back and
[1:25:42] forth I would love to and God help me if
[1:25:44] maybe if God let her open the door I
[1:25:46] have a sermon right now I've had holding
[1:25:48] it for years I'd like to preach on is
[1:25:51] father's fathers husbands
[1:25:54] husbands where are you men men where are
[1:25:59] you remember called for Adam Adam Adam
[1:26:02] where are you you're out of your
[1:26:04] position Adam you're out of your
[1:26:08] place sisters women mothers where are
[1:26:14] you and put it back in the word not some
[1:26:17] psychology teaching of a self-help book
[1:26:20] but putting it back as a husband and
[1:26:22] wife wife should reflect the husband and
[1:26:23] wife the bride in the groom it's a
[1:26:26] revelation it lays in
[1:26:29] Revelation hey man I'm not going to go
[1:26:32] there I get started I won't stop all
[1:26:34] right so we it would take probably
[1:26:36] several parts but
[1:26:39] anyway God knows so now I'm just going
[1:26:43] to have to bypass this but that seed
[1:26:45] germ is in that Third Realm that's the
[1:26:47] real gift so the real gift brother Bram
[1:26:49] said he said to them that perish is
[1:26:51] foolishness but but to them that are in
[1:26:53] Christ a part of the seed it's life the
[1:26:55] real gift is your soul down in there he
[1:26:58] said brother Braham said the baptism is
[1:27:00] a temporal gift he said the real gift is
[1:27:03] your soul down there that that baptism
[1:27:06] watered on quickened that seed germ what
[1:27:10] is that seed germ can't be anything else
[1:27:12] but Jesus Christ yeah God himself
[1:27:17] yeah amen hallelujah that's right all
[1:27:21] right so he said he said that real gift
[1:27:24] is your soul down in there that was born
[1:27:26] of God and that controls the whole thing
[1:27:28] to the word of God and the will of God
[1:27:31] and there you grow up mature see then
[1:27:35] you're a son and daughter of God you're
[1:27:37] a child of God you're a Son of God
[1:27:39] coming forth and you see the word said I
[1:27:41] should do this I should be born again
[1:27:43] well I belong to church that don't mean
[1:27:44] one thing well I'm I I'm Pentecostal I
[1:27:47] belong if you don't line up with that
[1:27:49] word there's something wrong then you
[1:27:51] see your real father raising God because
[1:27:53] that real start is in your
[1:27:55] soul the real start the real you you
[1:27:58] know you realize that the real you is
[1:28:00] what your soul
[1:28:02] is it's not how you make believe out
[1:28:04] here and how you can dress up like a
[1:28:06] real believer and conduct yourself with
[1:28:08] such Purity and all these stuff it's
[1:28:10] what's in the
[1:28:11] soul because you can be a hypocrite and
[1:28:14] be something different in the soul and
[1:28:16] dress up and act like and have pictures
[1:28:18] on the wall and everything of a
[1:28:20] Believer that's right and say I'm a
[1:28:22] believer I'm a I'm a message believer
[1:28:24] and have no Revelation and just a head
[1:28:26] knowledge of the word see but that Soul
[1:28:29] then there's something else different in
[1:28:31] your soul what are
[1:28:33] you you're trying to pretend something
[1:28:35] you're not but I say Lord help us every
[1:28:37] one of us to live what we are in the
[1:28:40] soul I can be what I am in the
[1:28:45] soul Jesus knew his position Jesus knew
[1:28:48] who he was amen that was the faith he
[1:28:52] walked in right there now the same thing
[1:28:56] will be the bride because whatever he
[1:28:57] was we are and all we are he
[1:29:01] was did you know that all that we are he
[1:29:05] is and all that he is we
[1:29:09] are that's the true unveiling of God to
[1:29:12] you and I amen all right now if that
[1:29:17] Soul do come from God it wasn't a germ
[1:29:19] of God to begin with then you're
[1:29:20] deceived
[1:29:22] see see what how see how it comes right
[1:29:25] down all right now let's see I maybe
[1:29:28] just have to quit right now who can lay
[1:29:31] anything no I've got to cover this one
[1:29:32] more can you give me just five minutes
[1:29:35] is that all right let me finish just one
[1:29:39] thing let's turn to Romans
[1:29:42] 8 Romans chapter 8 I don't even know
[1:29:45] what time it is I'm sorry I probably way
[1:29:47] over time and I don't even know it so
[1:29:49] it's my ignorance isn't
[1:29:50] it so you you won't hold me to ignorance
[1:29:54] all right because I don't have any way I
[1:29:57] don't even have a phone or nothing to
[1:29:58] tell time and don't tell
[1:30:02] me okay Romans 8 verse one there is
[1:30:05] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:30:08] which are in Christ
[1:30:09] Jesus praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:30:13] there is therefore now no judgment to
[1:30:15] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[1:30:18] not after the flesh who are those in
[1:30:20] Christ Jesus they are those that do not
[1:30:22] walk after the flesh but after the
[1:30:24] spirit that's right Hallelujah that's
[1:30:27] right all right now for the law this is
[1:30:31] what I want to get to two for the law of
[1:30:33] the spirit that's Holy Spirit of life
[1:30:35] eternal life for the law of the spirit
[1:30:37] of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
[1:30:42] free
[1:30:44] free from the law of sin and
[1:30:49] death you're not under the law the law
[1:30:52] satisfied you're under grace yes through
[1:30:55] faith yeah
[1:30:57] amen all right consider this quoting
[1:31:01] brother brandom out of the church age
[1:31:02] book consider this so I want you
[1:31:04] consider this since it is the blood of
[1:31:06] God it is perfect
[1:31:09] blood and if if the perfect blood is
[1:31:12] loosing us from the power and bondage
[1:31:15] and defilement of sin then the loosing
[1:31:18] is perfect and complete
[1:31:27] there is now no there is now therefore
[1:31:31] no
[1:31:34] condemnation who shall lay anything to
[1:31:37] the charge of God's
[1:31:39] elect it is God that justifieth declares
[1:31:43] us
[1:31:44] righteous that's what justified mean
[1:31:46] declares us righteous when before the
[1:31:48] foundation of the world we never did it
[1:31:50] who is he that
[1:31:53] condemneth
[1:31:54] amen it is Christ that died see the
[1:31:58] scripture goes on rather is risen again
[1:32:00] see that's Romans 8:
[1:32:03] 33-34 and brother Bram said there it is
[1:32:06] his death gave us the blood and the
[1:32:08] blood carries life see the death gave us
[1:32:11] the blood and that life is the
[1:32:14] token the spirit of Life ha made me free
[1:32:17] from the law of sin and death it's my
[1:32:19] identification that is the token
[1:32:22] all right then he said now so so the
[1:32:27] blood loosed us he gave his blood the
[1:32:29] blood has loosed
[1:32:31] us amen you're not chained anymore there
[1:32:35] is now no condemnation How can there be
[1:32:38] there is nothing to be condemned for
[1:32:41] because the blood has loosed us from sin
[1:32:45] unbelief there's none yes there's none
[1:32:48] amen devil says you did this you're a
[1:32:50] liar say Satan you're a
[1:32:52] liar well I feel no I don't feel
[1:32:55] anything it's this it's what he said I
[1:32:57] know that I'm in him it's a revelation
[1:32:59] to me it's settled I have the judge has
[1:33:02] already judged me perfect the book's
[1:33:04] been open I'm judged under the open book
[1:33:06] of this hour I am judged
[1:33:08] perfect what did God say about us he
[1:33:11] said you're perfect you're not condemned
[1:33:13] you're you're perfect you're free
[1:33:15] they're you're absolutely
[1:33:18] sinless go back to to find out what he
[1:33:21] said this is my message to you bride
[1:33:23] you're perfect you're sinless you're
[1:33:26] Justified as though you never did it in
[1:33:28] the first place yes sir go back to
[1:33:30] Invisible Union see if that it wasn't
[1:33:32] God's thought to you
[1:33:35] amen amen then we need to be taking this
[1:33:39] word God wants us to take this and point
[1:33:41] it back at the Devil and say you're
[1:33:42] lying this is not who I am and bring him
[1:33:46] the word Jesus defeated the devil on
[1:33:49] every ground on the basis of the word it
[1:33:51] is written it is written it is written
