begins to show you something in the word and you're not quite catching it but you know there's something there and then God opens your eyes to it and Revelation pours through and I thought you know what it's going to be like that and when our loved ones or whoever's gone on knocks on the door I don't think we're going to be surprised to see him amen number 1077 treat him like a king [Music] when we give the Lord our heart he deserves every part but very often we hold back some things we should have given from the start I just want to be his bride oh there is nothing to hide every corner of my

perfect rest behind the inner Veil so rest little Bri rest for all is well hallu I think we should take that almost as a command that we should just stop from our nervous life stop from all the distractions and be able to just say I know who I am in Jesus Christ amen the word has come the word is real it is who I am amen and I'm just going to trust the Lord and rest amen so good to be here this morning amen so I want to start off with just a a couple little things uh here uh I don't know that brother Chris has shared so much but brother Chris and the family will be traveling uh for the new year uh going back and ministering and I always get it confused it's Indiana right not Ohio um I looked on the map and you can find the same name of a town in Ohio and so I'm always like ah anyway they'll be they'll be gone for uh I think a couple weeks two weeks so let's remember them in prayer amen let's also remember the grand family uh in Arizona with family also at this time and anyone else that I maybe missed that will be gone and I think brother vasile is still out on the road uh but let's remember him in prayer amen and uh just very happy have sister Alice sister Andrea uh here with us and um the family is here complete Amen brother Terry sister Shelly the boys just a good time when the family is all together and I think we take this over into a spiritual realm the family is together this morning amen that we stand here as as Brothers and Sisters in Christ not just a terminology but it should literally be our our heartfelt thought for one another as we're here with the family amen so so good I hope you didn't come this morning thinking you were going to hear a Christmas message brother Chris and I was just discussing that he shared with you there that that you know um my brother and sister Lambs are born in the spring we have to take what brother Chris said just a little further the denomination has lock the Sheep up in the dark and then declared when the birth was their own self but they didn't follow nature they didn't follow the word and so it's there that they have to to now put you know brother Chris I I I Google that real quick does it snow in Bethlehem does it snow in Jerusalem does does and it's very rare they say but remember it used to snow here so we can't you know people want to take today like see it don't happen but you know Lambs are born in the spring that's right amen and we as Sons and Daughters of God Lambs amen a new birth amen and God has given it to us in due season and the spring time of our lives uh is is such a beautiful time a time for us to be able to to just take the word amen thank you so much enjoyed the song service our musicians amen Allelujah we want to remember that causes me to remember our sister via who no doubt at this moment is having a time of her life uh you know I imagine uh just from Human Experience I imagine that Auntie is just a little more liberal than Mom and Dad and uh so she's probably just really having a good time let's turn in our Bibles I want to speak to you this morning on the bigger picture and I think sometimes we we get too small of a view and and we start to look at a very small picture and you know sometimes uh the very uh size of the picture influences you on your comprehension of it and uh you can take a picture of a picture and not see the whole picture and so we want to be able to see the whole picture because that's what was promised that it would be in this hour that the mystery of Jesus Christ would be revealed amen not a little portion of the mystery but the mystery and so we stand here today believing God has given us a Clear Vision a clear uh understanding of the mystery that is being revealed has been revealed being revealed in us and I pray the Lord just helps us see the bigger picture let's turn in our Bibles this morning to job the first chapter verses 6-8 and um I I trust that uh when I'm all done today it will it will be understandable amen that God would come um you know sometimes we we just as ministers I have to say that uh it might surprise you how many times that a portion of the picture gets revealed to us while we're trying to preach the picture and we're up here going wow I didn't see that and of course you know being Humanity we're not going to come and say man this is just beond me I try and explain this to you BL no we just preach it because that's God stepping in the room that's right and when he steps in the room and says no the picture's bigger than you even Minister then he gives that and we all walk away rejoicing and I say thank you Lord for that kind of a spiritual experience that the Lord desires to give to us job the 1 chapter verses 6 6-8 now there was a day when the sons of God come to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man and one that feareth God and esth Evil Heavenly Father we just ask you this morning open your word father let us see the bigger picture Lord certainly we are in that picture according to your word and father we just love you thank you for your grace and mercy to us today that we can come not of who we are or what we have done but to come father knowing that father you have desired and chosen to express yourself in US Lord we desire to be that expression we desire father to be the word coming alive in this day we ask you to lead us and guide us in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as a scripture says the day that the sons of God come to present themselves and you know my brother and sister um maybe it was a Sunday just like this maybe it was a time that that uh sons of God God were just coming in to worship to to come have their needs prayed for to lift one another up in prayer to have that support for each one of us to to worship God and and be encouraged have you ever uh uh uh just a just a moment here do have you ever found it easier to worship when you're around people who are worshiping it it's like a a a a encouragement to us an influence in our life that we see people reaching out praising God and maybe we come to church today and I'm not saying this negative but maybe we come with burdens today that are weighing our heart down but the moment you get in this and start to worship with the Saints something breaks loose and you find that that burden that you are carrying yes there's still the circumstance there but it no longer has such an influence on us and if you come in whether it's a church or somewhere else and you're in a a room full of people with Doom and Gloom we sometimes just jump right in with them and uh you know everything is woe unto me so I'd rather be in the house of God worshiping with sons and daughters of God together lifting our voices to the Lord and praising him and so maybe a Sunday just like this and Satan came to church and uh be honest with you what the prophet has taught us we look in the word somewhere in the building Satan's just waiting to to have his moment but my brother and sister we're here in the name of Jesus Christ and I say this as as not boastful but we just bind you Satan amen we bind you we're here today to worship God we're here to receive the word today not be bound sitting in the house of God so we bind you Satan in the name of Jesus Christ amen now we don't do that to believing that we and of ourselves have this ability but the word Jesus Christ has declared that if we ask anything in his name he will grant it so we don't have power but we have authority amen so we can loose the power by The Authority granted to us by our Lord Jesus Christ isn't that wonderful amen that we can make our claim on the word and God will honor that claim amen so Satan came to church that day and you know know I always find it interesting The more I've been studying on job and reading these and reading different uh things about job I always find it interesting you notice that the Lord did not rebuke Satan for coming to church my if it was in my human thoughts we would meet him at the door and uh and we would have I say this jokingly we would have today brother Ivan the big guys you know brother Ivan brother Terry would meet him at the door and toss him out but you see God didn't rebuke him for coming and so it's there in fact God comes down and starts to have a conversation with him what have you been doing now remember at one time they Fellowship together and God knows the very nature of Satan Satan thinks he knows the nature of God and I want you to hold on to that because it will be become an important component uh of what uh we're fixing to talk about for a few minutes you see Satan thought he understood God and he thought if I do this God will do this but you see Satan was mistaken and so we'll realize that the very nature of humanity under this kind of an influence we are there my brother and sister now let's remember Cain and Abel as much as we would say Okay Cain's over here and Abel's over here but my brother and sister they were birthed in the same family be with me Humanity not the same father but the same family of humanity they went to church they gave offerings they had an altar they they did everything so similar that there's a good possibility if if you and I in the early stages of that relationship were there we would not have been able to tell the difference between Cain and Abel amen they brought their very best offerings they brought their very War their very best clothes all of these things that we as humans in our comprehension think are important but it's there that one understood God and one thought he understood God and so in that realm of thinking that they understand then it tends to influence the direction of one's life and the train of thought that one has and we have to be careful because this can be so subtle that that we don't realize you know I I just share this real quick I don't want to be long today but I will be uh but my brother and sisters it's like a story at the end of World War II one of the very last uh bombers that had been made uh towards the end of World War II uh was the latest of technology and it was over in Italy and uh when the war was over they said we don't want to destroy that plane a little history tidbit they pushed uh thousands of planes in piles and turned them into scrap metal and so so they said we want to keep this plane this is the latest of technology and so these men who had a stellar record as as a a uh Bomber Crew were commissioned to fly that plane back to the United States and as they left and and uh it was very cloud cover and and very uh uh uh kind of poor weather you might say you know they took the readings with the instruments the best they could and and you know those bombers could not fly from Europe to the United States without adding fuel and and azors was a place that was uh you know one of their major bases they took their readings when the cloud cover would break they would try to take another reading but when they got to the place that the azors should have been it's nothing but empty ocean take that spiritually yeah I'm not here to end up in empty ocean and so the Navigator who is a very excellent Navigator starts in a hurry because they're at the very least of their fuel down to nothing and he starts taking readings and he starts mapping them on the deal and doing that and now this takes a man who has confidence in himself to tell the pilot turn these degrees we've missed it by 80 miles and and they turn and the pilot says I hope you're right because in 80 Mi we'll be landing in the ocean if there is no island but as the plane is coming down to almost almost absolute empty they spot land now my brother and sister I want you to take that little thought today and I want you to hold on to that because at the very best of our ability we miss the mark yeah but Christ Our Navigator comes and says time to change course yes sir time for us to stop what we've been looking at and to look at what I want you to look at and make the correction you see we're not Sinners and unworthy because of the fact that we did not set the right course absolute but it's God's love and grace and Mercy to us that he says I understand how easy it is to miss the mark see we talk about the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus and we set sometimes such a high standard for oursel that everything that comes short of that Mark we beat ourselves up and Satan's right there at church to beat us up also but it we're here as Sons and Daughters of God with a promise that I've never lost a one amen and I won't start now amen so God's always correcting our course and he doesn't we might call it sin we might look out as as ministers and say well it looks like this person this family has missed the mark but my brother and sister remember it's God not us that's in control amen so we say thank you this morning thank you Lord for the fact that you set our course straight and bring us to the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus amen men we shouldn't be nervous about this we shouldn't be sitting here this morning worried about missing the Rapture amen we should not be sitting here worried about I'm going to make a mistake oh I'm nervous about this what we need to do is be constantly saying Lord correct my course amen cuz it won't be in us it will be in Christ alone and so as he sets our course and directs us my brother and sister we come to the place that we come to the house of God and present oursel and the Devil Comes also you see God had a conversation with Satan that day just like he's having one here this morning and we kind of tend to think that we want to keep the devil out of church you see my brother and sister let me just say this it's not about keeping the sin out of your life are you with me it's about keeping the Holy Ghost in we were born in sin shaped in iniquity this flesh will never be perfect but God has given us the option the ability to keep the Holy Ghost in amen and so as we stand here today sit here today we read realize that the Lord knows just what we need you know it's just a little bit difficult for us to say uh I I'm looking forward to the next trial in my life but you see God is going to allow that to happen because he uses those trials to mold us amen we don't want to go without trials because if we go without trials it means we are unmolded that's right I don't want to stand before God with no character at all no faith at all amen we're not going to We Can't God would never present us on that day in glory to those saints that are so battle worn and scarred and here we are in our presstine never never been touched condition that's right you're going to face the battle why don't we put on the whole armor of God and just face the battle say Lord whatever it is I know that you in me I will overcome and then take that and move forward amen amen so I think the beauty of this and also the irony of this is the fact that we have the open word amen right we have the open word today God has spoke to US Open the word and you can look if you study we're all different I'm not advocating you start digging into all this stuff out here but my brother and sister I feel as a min sister then that to a degree I say to a degree there was a time I really dug into some of that stuff and my own wife I'm not throwing her under the bus I'm stating a fact to you my own wife said this is affecting you I backed up from that I don't want Leo de seea to have the influence in my life I want Jesus Christ the word to have the influence in my life but still as a minister we we go out and we start to look into the camp of the enemy and and we Advocate everybody trails along and and tries to come and look into the camp of the enemy but my brother and sister you'll see as as God leads us in these things leads us along of this we get to see uh the the Beauty and the irony as I said of this and and uh we have the open Word and in spite of the open word we still struggle it's not an accusation it's not to condemn anybody I think it's just a simple statement of fact that we're living in the age with the most open revealed word ever but Satan's also at the Pinnacle of his power so the Lord knew exactly what it would take the trials we would face everything that would happen that would cause us to react in a certain way and remember my brother and sister the law of physics for every action there is an equal or opposite reaction and so God's out here looking at us and and we go through a trial and and how many of you you know I'm I'm not judging in this but how many of us you know have said woe is me in the last six months amen I I I tell you I I've said woe is me so much that I got tired of hearing me say woe is me and so you look at that and sometimes we just simply don't realize what is happening and so so the the struggle is real and we look at that acknowledging the struggle is real we don't want to look at one another and say man they're really struggling because it might be your time next week that's right and we look at this and and if we look close you'll see that job was not much different than you and I we look at job and the words that that God spoke about job he was just and upright and and uh God was was very uh uh compliment entry of job yeah but I want you to look at the word study the word pray about it you'll see that God has spoken those very same words he spoke about job he has spoke them over you amen we're not sitting here today as a castoff or the left behind uh we are not The Wanderers in the desert we are Sons and Daughters of God that are made perfect by the word of God in this hour and that's what God wants you and I to believe but there is a time in the storm that we would think oh God will remind me who I am today but he says I already told you it's up to you to believe it and hold on to that if we so easily let go of what God said about us and who we are then all the rest of the promises of God are in Jeopardy also so if you believe that you are saved you need to hold on to your identity just as strong if you believe you are healed you need to hold hold on to your purpose Justus as strong God's not wanting us to walk around in spiritual Amnesia he wants us to walk around in a confidence of who we are and our purpose for being here on the Earth today amen isn't it amazing job was really honestly not much different and let me just throw this in it's out of my thought but it's there you realize that you're not much different than Enoch that's right amen but but I make mistakes did God say Enoch never made a mistake God said that he pleased God Amen he didn't say he never made a mistake amen and if God ever made Enoch so perfect that no one could attain to that and he has that obligation to you and I that's right so could we without being arrogant or proud or boastful today say truly the very words God spoke over Enoch spoke over job he has spoke over us he's speaking today telling us who we are amen but you have to believe it amen so we look at this isn't it amazing we're happy when life is good how you doing today brother praise God life is so good but cloudy eyes rough Seas a little sickness a little financial troubles a little of this a little of that how you doing well we think about okay we got to live our testimony here it's good brother I feel blessed nobody believes you the devil certainly is rejoicing am I speaking to you okay that's good because I was actually speaking to me so look at this my brother and sister when when life is good we we are happy but when things go sideways we struggle to understand why God is allowing this to go sideways we stop you realize that's exactly what happened with job life was good God speaks to Satan and tells him this is my servant he's good he's upright he's righteous he's everything I want him to be but go ahead I'll open the Hedge and and job now went from life being so good and everything he laid a hand to God blessing that till all of a sudden his children are gone and all his possessions are gone and his animals are gone and his buildings are blown away and I guess what would be a tornado and my brother and sister suddenly job is like man what did I do wrong but it wasn't about just what job thought about that equation everybody job went to church with yeah starts to look at that same equation saying what's wrong with job what did job do while we were all sleeping surely job must have been off doing something that became a secret sin and we know as I've preach on here in the church that God saw one little speck in job and said you know job is upright he's right rightous he's holy he's everything I want but you know my standard this is the Lord speaking my standard of perfect and the standard of perfect I've held here they're just a little bit different so I want to bring job up to my standard I'm not going to to just let job go because he's more righteous than anyone around him the most righteous man in the land I I'm not going to leave job at that place just you're the most righteous job God says I'm going to bring you up to my standard cuz you were created in my image see we can read the scripture and say oh that's right okay we can have kind of a vision when God said you were created in my image that God In the Flesh when he manifested himself which we know this as Jesus Christ had Eyes Ears Nose fingers feet whatever oh that's the image no my brother and sister God had entirely different image that he created man in an entirely different image that he called bride to than just looking like this out here I don't want to go and be negative about that out there but that out there has every attribute going back to Canaan Abel they've got an altar they've got an offering they've got everything but my brother and sister God said I want something that is perfect come on we ought to be able to say Amen this morning because God has called you to a high calling in Christ Jesus not just a calling but a high calling that puts you at the Pinnacle of it all of what he's Desiring to magnify and represent his image in that's right oh Hallelujah does that mean tomorrow we said amen today does that mean tomorrow just going to flow no probably there'll be a rocky road because Satan doesn't like it when you start to get the idea of who you really are in Jesus Christ then he was to come in by like a flood but the word is there to counter everything Satan might throw upon us hallelujah so we struggle and it goes sideways and we see this transition then uh and I'm skipping over a lot but you guys know the story we see job moving into a place where he's actually lamenting his life scripture says he cursed the day he was born now I don't believe he was out there with a filthy language of the world got to get the right kind of cursing he was lamented regretting the very day of his birth yes right I wouldn't want anyone that I know to be in that position but God knows what it takes to make us Rapture Ready he's lamenting under this pressure he's starting to struggle with what is happening Lord I know and it's all right if you say Amen to this Lord I know I have been doing everything correctly but I'm still in this trial I'm still in this circumstance yeah why Lord what more could I do well I'm going to give away the punchline because I already have what more you can do is submit to come into a higher uh uh um oh what's the word it just escaped me a higher exposure of who we really are in Jesus Christ yeah see we set our standard as humans some set standards higher than others I I'm sorry sister April you're just a good example sister Alice you're a good example some of us set our standards pretty low and my standard was excape from school some of you break into the school some of us are here to break out so while we have different standards different points of view different outlooks my brother and sister God's got one goal for you and I he doesn't say to those that are wise and prudent they got this section of heaven and to those that are as dumb as a rock they've got this section of Heaven We Are All Sons and Daughters of God made in his spiritual image and he's reflecting that in us and bringing us forward and lifting us up and so in that we see that that uh job is is struggling with this it's Suddenly It's like wow and you know I I think none of us want friends like job's friends but God gives us friends like that and while we might be angry at them at the moment and in fact we'll see in the Book of Job that God wasn't overly happy with how they reacted or come but it was God that sent them I want you to think about this now God doesn't have absolute control right he's not going to treat us like a puppet God gives us opportunity he gives us Choice he gives us a chance and so how God designed all of this and it was God who designed this my brother and sister how God designed this he gave free moral agency to job's friends and he also gave free moral agency to job but he knew in the end when you get to the end of the book he knew what it would be he knew that job's friends would repent when God uh charged them with their their deeds and he knew that job would come to a greater Revelation than ever before in his life God didn't do that for an exercise of frustration to job he was bringing job to the Pinnacle bringing him up into a higher place and so we'll look at this struggle and I share this today because I want you to see that you're lamenting can I be a little more blunt you're whining and crying God's not judging you by your whining and crying he's not saying they don't believe me they're just this they're this that my brother and sister God knows the birthing process to the new birth and it's a process every mother here knows that everyone who understands that knows what it is it's a process and it takes place and in that my brother and sister God says it's no problem I will make room I will give Grace and I will bring them to the place I want them to be amen so it's there we see I'm I'm going to just put it in this context in the following chapters we see job's friends each one of them expressing themselves as to why this is happening a common theme amongst them you might think that three would be enough in the mouth of two or three Witnesses right but you know they're coming and and uh and you know actually a lot of their thoughts were spot on they actually hid it you go back and read it I've been reading I I wanted to preach the whole thing and then I thought it'll take forever just to go to Every chapter every deal every line that they spoke to do but you go read it and you will see that they spoke spot on yeah but job anointed knowing he hadn't went and secretly sin doesn't even listen to them instead of gleaning those things that would have been beneficial job defends himself have you ever felt that need somebody says something to you and all of a sudden you're just like I'm defending myself you don't even have to ask yourself if you should you just do it when maybe we should have stopped and listened and then just said God bless you brother God bless you Sister I'll pray about it but no we're humans we feel this need to defend our decision look at this they start expressing themselves we'll shorten this to the general theme is you have a secret sin you have done something God didn't want you to do or you didn't do something God wanted you to do but regardless you have displeased god let's take this right back to Job 1 here's a man who's righteous upright es sketh evil yeah so we recognize that while their thought is correct it doesn't match God's thought yeah they thought they understood God but they didn't right they judged righteousness by their definition are we not guilty there's times that we judge others righteousness by our thoughts but we think it should be but the truth of it is is their thoughts were spot on for the circumstance that job had come to a place that in instead of coming to God and approaching him correctly and saying Lord where do we find Jesus submission what words do we find Jesus submission in Lord thy will not my will job could have taken that position and said you know what Lord whatever it is I've done my best now we don't want to use this as an excuse my brother and sister I've done my best so I can't do no more I've done my best no but we can take a position that's actually so close to that one that it would seem like that that they're mated together of Lord thy will be done I have done all this flesh and all this spiritual man is able to do but Lord I know there's more I know that you're in control and Lord I'm trusting you and that was a position job should have took he should have never even listened and responded Ed to their criticisms in fact God rebukes them I'm don't remember I I didn't write all these down because I just knew it' take too long but somewhere around job 3839 in there God's rebuking these guys for how they treated job and yet they're mostly right but they missed the mind of God don't you love how it's come through the message I'd rather have the right Spirit and the wrong Doctrine than to have the right Doctrine and the wrong Spirit Well I'm sorry to tell you they're both wrong take it in context I'm not countering anything but you see what happens is this bride I'm talking to to the bride here this morning is that okay okay I'm not countering anything the prophet said or anything but my brother and sister we're not called to have half the equation we have the opening of the word Christ is here with us we don't have to settle for half of this picture God is wanting to expand it that we see the bigger picture to see that we were called to have the right Doctrine and we were called to have the right Spirit not just live in portion but we have come to live in the fullness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ right amen that's right but we can use that as an excuse I have a better attitude than you my drine has went off the rails but my attitude is way better than yours so I'm right no sir we're living in a day my brother and sister that the opening of the word has brought it to you and I to stand here today knowing what we believe is truth not partial Truth full truth truth it is truth that we have been given and God will come and I trust you if you have an experience God bless you Sister if you have an experience that God will correct us his way and sometimes his way is hard trial sometimes his way is suffering sometimes his way is is things that we don't even understand and we don't know why this is taking place but what happens is as we come to a place we'll trust ourself before we'll trust what God's trying to do God said just trust me amen just trust me now as we look here job knows he doesn't have any secret sin I have been in Services sister Jerry was there but maybe doesn't even realize this took place were men praying for people in the altar not pounding pounding them on the back but just just confess confess how would you like to be that person that's in the Altar and you know you've got nothing confessed maybe you're there in the altar asking for more understanding asking for a deeper Revelation asking for a friend whatever it might be and they're they're the preacher thinking they're in the altar it's because they got sin in their life and then to have that person later come and say brother Paul if I have a sin in my life I'm not aware of it I I don't know how would you feel we wouldn't feel very good to be somebody questioning our Salvation questioning you know what we are doing and living and yet it's Humanity it's Humanity that we feel like somebody's in a battle someone's in a struggle I want to know my brother and sister if you would agree with me this morning morning if we had been there with job we might well be asking job about his secret sin because that's what is bothering us that afflicts us that we face that we and we face that ourself maybe that there's things we're still dealing with so we believe everybody must be just like that but God had a whole different purpose had nothing to do with secret sin cuz God did not change his mind about Job halfway through this story amen he said said that he was perfect my brother and sister my words there but he says that he's perfect and so therefore God didn't come along halfway through the story and say I didn't realize that about job and God's not coming halfway through the story saying oh I didn't realize that about you he's called you worthy he's called you blessed he's called you the bride of Christ he's not going to get halfway through the story and decide that you're a loser my brother and sister that you're just another rank sinner God is faithful and we don't understand him job in his mind is you're false I'm falsely accused but God said I do see something in you job that I'd like to root out you know the problem we have in the world today people don't want to give God Liberty to root it out they don't want to give God freedom to make it hurt in fact if you go study your history you'll find the correlation coming out of pagan worship the Cor relation between Santa Claus and the Modern Day Jesus Christ they've cut him out of the same mold you just need to bless me bring me good gifts and basically leave me alone after all Santa only shows up once a year they want God to show up maybe once a year choose between Christmas or e Easter you see my brother and sister God looked at job and he says you know what job I'm going to let you go through a painful trial time in your life and I'm doing this to bring you up higher now I want to ask you a question today Saints who wants to go up higher amen amen every one of us should be lifting a hand saying Lord draw me higher dve me higher but when you say that be prepared that God is going to take those little things in your life and he's going to root them out amen don't you love that when you get a sliver a a and uh uh it reminds me Family Camp that little girl got that sliver and it's a good deal sister April did the operation because if Paul had the girl wouldn't have been able to walk for the next week because I believe in getting way below where the actual sliver is and making it bleed and we don't want God to do that we want God to wrap it up and give it a little kiss it'll be better now but you see God says that little bit I want out I'm going to get that out just reading a little bit of history book that sister Sue had given me as a birthday gift there was a man that was on a ship it's about the convoys in World War II going across the ocean to Russia the man on his ship froze actually it froze his legs solid and um you know they cut away a lot of the Flesh and said we think we've got it but they didn't get rid of the Gang Green it kept on going it kept right on spreading and what they could have done right in the first place cost the man both of his legs because they didn't want to hurt him when in reality we wouldn't like the results you see the choice was cut off his foot or cut off most of his leg they they just thought it was terrible to cut off his foot it's going to affect everything but by that decision they cursed him pardon me for using it that way but they cursed him to lose both of his legs much farther up you see we don't want the pain so we settle for what's the easiest way out and the whole time job doesn't even understand why this is happening it's like Lord I was living for you I prayed for my children every every single day L they would have done something that was not pleasing I want to know do we pray for our children like that we should be my brother and sister but when God takes you through a trial sometimes he actually uses the children to be part of your trial and you prayed that God would deal kindly with your children and correct them and do this and you say how can this be I prayed that God would do this and yet it seems like the trial comes down to to my children and then we're actually upset with God that maybe our children are not serving God today maybe it's part of your trial that's right to come to Perfection amen but we don't think so brother brandham says here in the message show us the father and it suffices amen then when his church m members came and could not console him accused him uh uh to being a secret sinner said he'd sinned before God which every man does job knew he had not sinned and he knew he was all right but when God sent a young man down by the name of elu come down to meet job look what the prophet says it's not another one of his friends that's there to criticize but when you read what elu wrote or spoke you almost think he's in the same boat they are but there was a different anointing U didn't come as a Critic elu come as one to bring reconciliation he wanted to bring his friends and job back Amen to God Amen but when God sent a young man down by the name of elue come down to meet job perfect type of Christ again he didn't accuse job of being a secret sinner he tried to tell him of someone who would come and stand in the breach in the last days and put his hands oh Lord and put his hands upon a sinful man and upon a holy God and Bridge the way oh Hallelujah aren't you glad there's one today that has stood in that gap for you and I amen who has bridged between us as carnal people and almighty God all I can say today is thank thank you Lord thank you Lord that there's one to stand in the gap for you and I but yet look at this my brother and sister elu spoke very strong words to job and it would almost look like you see if we just read it it would almost look like we needed let me put it this way we needed the prophet to show us that this was a type of Jesus Christ cuz it just looked like another critic in another way yeah amen U strong words Lord help us to deal with strong words amen you know the scripture shows us as the spirit of the age would be a spirit of offense that's right and boy are we seeing that yes sir yeah we're seeing that you know sometime back I was in Town shopping which in itself is a rarity but I was walking out of a business and there was this lady walking towards me she looked normal and so as I'm going out I just kind of turned around the end of the door and stood there holding the door and she got about 3 feet from me and snarled and said I can hold my own door thank you please what is it a spirit of offense sounds pretty radical doesn't it can you say strong words think about some of the things we become offended over ex right they were nothing they were literally measured as nothing but the spirit of offense that's on the world wants to be on you on the bride of Christ and the Holy Ghost is here to guard you and I from that spirit of offense because that spirit of offense becomes a spirit of bitterness and on down the line so you see now that it come to the place that we needed someone who would stand in the breach in this last day and I praise God God is so mindful to you and I he actually just named this the message amen the breach Amen to show you and I what it is to be able to live this life knowing with confidence this is not permission to sin but knowing with confidence there's one standing in the Gap one standing in the breach for you and I today amen and God is here telling you don't take offense of that pray for them amen imagine how many offenses we would have in the church if the first thing we did when something slapped Us in the face we would just go find a spot and say Lord I don't know if they meant that and if they did Father help them touch them Lord Heal them give them repentance or whatever it might be reconciliation but you know we usually go around the corner I never like them anyhow well the prophet of God says is you can find one thing one thing I was just talking to a brother overseas just a few days ago very difficult situation there the brother found himself getting caught up in the situation and the Lord brought him to a quote I'd read it to you except from my phones in the office brought him to a quote and the prophet says if you find there's one thing in your heart against that person amen the Holy Spirit cannot be there amen amen you mind if I sit down and just weep for a moment or two because we find times in our lives yes sir we hold great feelings of animosity that's right absolutely right then we wonder why our own life is sterile from the present pres of the holy spirit amen and if we're not careful we even tried to blame that on that individual amen I'm not praying and reading my Bible because of them wow wow see how we think we understand God and we don't that's right let me hurry along here I'm going to have to hurry along really fast so look look at this my brother and sister that that elu had strong words for job and and he speaks them out he doesn't come and apologize for what God's called him to do no more than our Lord Jesus Christ would apologize for standing in the gap for you and I he knew where he stood and he knew what was necessary and he spoke it amen Lord let us have friends like that let us be in the presence of men like that amen so eloh recorded in Job 35: 1 and two elu speaks to job and he says thinkest Thou this to be right that thou said us my righteousness is more than God's do you realize what that is let's tone that down and make it palatable that's a self-righteous spirit that our righteousness is greater than God's in other words instead of finding the word and it's showing us how to deal with it we just judge it ourself Lord help us amen we think we understand God but we don't also jumping down a little bit there in job 35 uh 16 therefore doth job now this one to me was just a really a Zinger therefore doth job open his mouth in vain he multipath words without knowledge how easy that is to do how easy that is to do God help us I I'm going to repent right in front of you today right here right now Lord forgive me Church forgive me how many times we by the increase of our words think we actually know what we're talking about what we need is the Holy Spirit to come and give us that little bit of a nudge but sometimes God's nudge feels like a sludgehammer to you and I but God is just nudging us in the the right direction because he's not going to have a bride and you are his bride he's not going to have a bride that holds these kind of feelings holds these kind of spirits lives in this kind of anointing God's not going to so you think it's a sludgehammer God thinks it's a nudge change a song there oh Lord bring the sledgehammer just now oh Lord bring the sludgehammer just now amen we want the Holy Spirit Lord come move by your Holy Spirit I didn't want the sludgehammer Lord it was just the Holy Spirit God just lining us up rhetorical question for you is it possible to serve god without knowledge or understanding we would say no but God says yes at the end of the book you'll find where God comes and chastises those men tells them they need to take and give gifts to job and repent because you see they acted without knowledge or understanding so you being the bride we being the bride let me put it that way we being the bride my brother and sister God will let us do things how many times you don't have to lift your hands cuz somebody that knows might see it but how many times we have spoken things when we were right but we were wrong yeah that's right typically you'll see this more so with husbands and wives or if I can kind of just poke a little bit with wives and husbands same equation amen why did you interpret that different you see what happens to us we interpret it where it finds favor for us right so look at this now that God is doing and and so elu coming on the scene he he comes and and he starts pointing uh uh this whole situation away from uh I never pronounce him right so forgive me elifas bildad and zofar he he starts elu comes and he takes his whole conversation and he starts turning this away from those three men he turns it and he turns it and he turns it a and pretty soon you know they're uncomfortable because they realize that elue is right but they don't like what their own attitude produced but elu is right because going back to the quote it's gone now but that's all right elu was coming as Christ how are we going to argue with Christ the Holy Ghost in you can't argue with the word amen because the word in you is expressed as the holy spirit amen so you can't argue with that that's why the prophet of God said that a real believer will say Amen to every word of God because it's the Holy Spirit moving them and the Holy Spirit spirit is the word represented so you can't say no to it so he starts pointing them away from that but look what happens if you read this when I say open mind I'm not think talking about you know mixed up theology but just expand it Beyond just reading a few boxed in words and then he moves Beyond them and he starts to speak to job he's the youngest there they're all Elder to him and he starts to speak to them and he starts to declare you know what uh you've been looking at this as why job why was you praying about show me God's house so I can see show me this and show me that God show me why oh how many times have we done that Lord show me why I need to know why I'm going through this trial why don't we just stop and say Lord I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God if I'm going through this trial it's only because you want me to go through this this trial you allowed it to happen you pulled the Hedge back and let Satan inside the head it's not Satan prying his way in like a burglar it's God saying I'll use you devil I'll use you just fine I'll put a in your mouth and I will shot your feet and I will use you to fulfill my word and to bring my bride into maturity and so it's there he starts to speak to job why are you saying this why are you saying this why are you standing there and bemoaning who you are has God not been faithful to you has God not blessed you through the years and this season of a trial is it not still God and our God is an awesome God our God is a powerful God our God's in control of everything what are you doing job this word's living again we're sitting here as a bride of Christ you know job had all those lands all those houses all those Ox all of everything that he had and you're rich richer than job is amen amen come on realize that you're richer than job ever was well I maybe don't even own a house I maybe this I maybe that who cares about those things it burns my brother and sister but God comes and uses El U to start pushing job and job because he's the son of God and God never breaks the word had to say amen that's right he had to acknowledge that's right what elu Christ exactly was speaking to him what does he do starts to turn the focus on God and His Majesty that's it How Great Is Our God Amen his righteousness and turns the focus on his authority who can argue it's right there I'm paraphrasing it right there in job who can argue with God I'm not qualified I don't know about anybody else but you see I found there's been times but then the Lord gracious many years ago here won't go into that whole story but I realized you can ask God a question don't question God that's right that's differ it's all about our approach and yet we found times in great Calamity and trial that we almost want to question God God says no sometimes you just have to trust me that's right I just need you to go ahead and just trust me right and in trust it's in the Psalms and in trust God rewards faithfulness my Lord I want my reward how I want my reward let me be faithful amen see he explains to job this understanding that God is so Superior to man his thoughts and his ways and you know what happens I need to hurry here please pray for me our reasoning misleads us us when we misunderstand God's character I can't tell you how many people I've dealt with that are angry at God and they have a reason we'll get to this in just a moment if I can have just a few more minutes of your time they Ang they're angry they're angry at God he never answered this prayer well maybe your prayer was ask them yes maybe your motive wasn't Pure or maybe the results if your prayer had been answered would be a disaster but we still want what we want when we want how we want and God says my ways are higher than your ways you're my son you're my daughter can you just trust me that's it that's it you know that's a hard statement that's it put the right context or the right circumstance and I don't know just take one of us to one another one here in the assembly and say just trust me y you realize the human flesh kicks in why does it kick in because you've been betrayed that's show me where Jesus Christ ever betrayed anyone that's it I'm faithful to my word amen amen that's right that's our God he's faithful to his word it's not about Humanity now don't get confused by what I'm going to say but it's kind of direct God's not faithful to you you go what what are you saying Paul God is faithful to his word that's right our job is to make sure the word is in us and then I can say God is faithful to you but you see the promise of redemption my brother and sister has been offered to humanity but they don't trust God and they abuse it when they ask for it praise God brother Isaac shares a deal that he had seen once years ago a church service the preacher I I don't know if I have this 100% right but the preacher comes down and starts going down the aisle of the church pray for money money money money we want money money money Lord bless us with money money money Mone money does God owe you money come on let's face it'd be a betrayal of those in the Dark Ages that hid in the caves starved labored that's right we're in fear that'd be betrayal God has no obligation to make your life easy then he would have be obligated to somehow go back and make their life easy you see when we misunderstand the character of God we come to the wrong conclusion I say Lord help me to understand help me to understand lord it's not what we think Saints but it's what God thinks amen amen Romans 9:11 and I'm just going to go through this you might find out if you wish to bother to look you'll find out this is one of the great scriptures that's being used today to cause people to question the goodness of God because now you've got whole big Ministries Mega Ministries that are saying we have misinterpreted there was something wrong with the writings or something that surely God would not do this that would be unkind and in the day of my emotional well-being imagine you have two wishes save your emotions or save your soul do you realize the anointing in leoda they would ask for their emotion to be saved and would reject the very word that would save their soul I stand here today with no desire to offend any one of you but if I have to choose to make you happy or save your soul it is to me not even a question of what we go forward that's right amen because making you happy and you lose your soul you would stand as it was the Rich Young Ruler and you would be looking across the gulf asking for Relief asking for something and your emotions at that time would mean nothing amen I'm sure you've thought of this heard it preach but how much water fits on the tip of your finger and the Rich Young Ruler asked would you send Lazarus to dip his finger and come across and give that to me that is desperation I'd rather you walked into heaven said our pastor was mean but I'm hereall amen yes sir so do a little homework read Romans 9 uh 11 through 23 I don't want to belabor that here but you know it's talking about the Potter and the clay and this part I will draw out my brother and sister when it comes to the time we think as message Believers that we can actually tell God how he wants how we want him to form us that's an arrogant Spirit that's exactly right amen starts with an intellectual Spirit turns into an arrogant Spirit I'm here to tell God what I want we spanked our children when they behave that way and would we wonder today that maybe the Lord would spank us amen help us Lord help us Lord let me move along please go read that his homework okay amen see job misunderstood his friends misunderstood elu was anointed to see how they actually missed God's work in job imagine El elu had a revelation of what God was wanting to accomplish before job did but you'll also notice that elu being faithful to what God called him to do did not get more houses more lands more cattle he didn't get anything but he found God's favor amen what do you want houses lands money in the bank or God's favor Lord give us your favor give us your favor hallelujah amen so as it is elu is speaking he he really digs in and he's forceful amen and it's there he's telling them in the end of all of this God is still God I don't care about your circumstance job all you friends I don't care about what you think was the right thing God is God and it's time for us to glorify God it's time for us to praise God it's time to lift our hands and worship God because God is in control it is not me it's not you it's not you job and your self-righteous spirit that spirit that was there but you remember you won't find in scripture what God took away the words he spoke about job no sir but let me tell you the speck the speck that's right can we shrink that even further the speck yeah that God will see in you he's obligated to take it out Can someone say Lord amen fulfill your obligation take that out amen do we realize what we're asking for for to bring man to see God and His Majesty I want to ask you trying to turn this back very positive here you know sometimes we look at that and we want to see something Supernatural we want to see something that would just somehow stir our life how about settling for seeing God's hand that's it in your life that's it that's it to bring us to a place that we just realize that he's leading and guiding and he's blessing us that's right and all we might see figuratively if I could say it's God's hand I would have went here in our trip to Canada we got to experience develop a new friendship with a family and as they share their testimony I'm sitting there thinking the whole time at the point we talk to them they still have a ton of questions I'm sitting there looking at this whole thing hearing their testimony and it's like that's God's hand that's God's hand that's God's hand that's God's hands but I'll tell you on the natural flesh side of this they're crying tears and they're saying we don't understand I'm over here saying God's hand God's hand he didn't say only understand the prophet said only believe and by God's grace that family is believing and God is shaking their whole world and they're still saying we know there's a reason this is happening yes sir yeah God help us that's right God help us I don't need to defend myself oh it's my human nature you might come along and you see Paul defending himself I'm telling you you're looking at flesh amen God don't owe that to us amen but we're Looking In the Flesh but if we'll ever come to the place we don't have to fully understand it but we'll stand there and say Lord thy will be done Lord and when thy will is done I'll still be standing here receiving it amen I won't run I won't hide I won't deny I will receive am Hallelujah would you put up that quotation I come across this in some of my readings recently kind of stirred me a little bit it's not out of the message just just some stuff that I've been reading instead of allowing our circumstance to come between us and God we should keep God between us amen and our circumstance brutal moment of truth I think most of the time we have that backwards our circumstances ruling our life that's it that's exactly right and we give what's left over to God that's the truth Lord help me you don't have to lift your hand maybe you can just lift it in your heart Lord help me I don't I don't want my circumstance coming between me and you Lord I want to put you between me amen and we could stereotype this that's probably not the right words but any man that would take his wife and tell her to go deep with the Intruder it's not much of a husband come onen maybe you send her if she's meaner than you are tougher than you are a better shot than you are but you understand what I'm saying amen Christ is not going to put you out to the front and say you deal with the devil you deal with the devil and I'm going to sit back and see whether you can live through the onslaught I can tell you we can't no that's right but with Christ between us and the devil we will come out of that will you still have pressure will you still have strain will you have so to speak skinned elbows and knees you will but you'll come out of that healthy and still serving God Amen Hallelujah okay just I'm trying to go okay let's go to the Rapture amen anybody like to just skip I like that I I got excited when brother Chris said you know I'm packed up and ready to go yeah amen packed up ready to go but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her that's the truth wait you mean it's not a physical it's a revelation that's it I believe what the prophet said my mind could say well there has to be something physical about it but what it really is is the physical is so secondary you see we're sitting here right now raptured into Heavenly places exactly as Sons and Daughters of God we're already going into a body change and if you're sitting here and I don't say this factiously I don't say this in bad humor but if you're sitting here today and you're not seeing a body change come to me after service and let's pray through because this word is creating a body change in you and I a change of our thinking a change of our heart a change of our Consciousness a change of our life amen that's it it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture oh I'm waiting to understand the seventh seal I'm waiting to understand this I'm waiting to understand that I'm going to live in the place where the revelation of the Rapture comes to me amen amen amen I might not be able to explain it you guys will be shocked when we get to heaven find out that your pastor preached a lot of things that he didn't even know oh yeah but God knew that's right and even though you can't see the strings I'm just a puppet isn't that what you want or do you want Paul to preach to you we'll settle for God amen amen the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture now it is a Revelation for the Revelation is Faith that's exactly right I sure enjoyed I did I tried calling him couldn't get back but brother Wayne just shared this beautiful thing with me I I just I was just like wow praise God my brother and sister you see we got to break all this down to Simplicity we don't need to preach it as a complex this thing where it's some kind of trigonometry and chemistry and this that and the other my brother and sister let's get down to the fact that Revelation is Faith amen oh you can say I've got a lot of Revelation but you got no faith something missing and you can say I've got a lot of this turn it around and something's missing that's it amen Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being Faith look at the date this was preached God did not leave a bunch of time for the prophet to come and correct this this is pure gold amen yes amen faith of Revelations cuz something that's revealed to you that's right come on don't don't don't even try to rely on a husband or a wife children don't try to rely on your parents get serious get into desperation and say Lord if you are real Lord please you got to show yourself to me I need Revelation because somebody can tell what you ought to do but when you know what you ought to do you will do what you know you ought to do H something revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him not revealed to somebody else to him that's it right as though it wasn't so now this is just for example please don't take these I could stand here this morning and I declare you guys aren't worthy for a Rapture you're not worthy to call yourself the bride of Christ you're not worthy and there would unfortunately be some influence by that but if you would take the revelation God has given you turn that right back to the word and You' say no you're wrong brother Paul I'm worthy because he's worthy that's right I've got the Holy Ghost because he made a promise personal not a church promise not an age promise although that applies also but he made a promise I'll be with you walk around my wife there just imagine I went over there and sit down right beside her I'm with her how far away is Christ from us this this morning in us that's right don't let anyone any Spirit any circumstance keep you from recognizing that's it Christ in you is the hope of glory hallelujah amen jump down here now Faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God and the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body sister Ruth if you would come amen let's just stand let's go let's sing the song 953 Hallelujah is it good to be a Christian today amen amen our God is faithful amen he's with us leading us guiding us [Music] amen how great are you Lord how great is your mercy how great are the things that you have done can we say Amen to that right there how great are you Lord your loving kindness is filling my heart as I sing how great are you Lord How Great Is Your Love it reaches to the heaven

filling my heart as I sing how great are you Lord hallelujah ain't that wonderful amen you know I just think about this 969 please [Music] brother we say here this morning and I trust something's been said that would bless you amen and we look at this and one of the greatest tricks is sat is using right [Music] now as the unbeliever is coming to the believer and say explain this to me how do you explain the unexplainable impossible amen God said what I'd like you to do now we could sit here pardon me for putting it this way but we could sit here and say only believe but God would actually like you to come to this place right here that you would look at this and say that's who I am that's right do you know now let me explain why I put it that way look at all the gender identity and all the other uh misidentifications there are you see what Satan's doing he's not trying to turn us from boys to girls girls to boys he's trying to turn us from Believers to unbelievers and you realize that's actually the same Spirit yes it is because we don't believe what God said that's it we are that's right can we just maybe close our eyes lift our hands and say thank you Lord for the understanding of who I am today that I could see even if there's been things and struggles and trials and struggles in my life Lord I believe what you said I am I'm not looking to be changed to another image but I'm standing here before you today Lord saying I believe I Trust You Lord you opened yourself your word to me I've caught a revelation of it and that Revelation is not a revelation of who we are as men and women it's a revelation of who we are in Jesus Christ that's it and father I thank you for very strong Revelation father for this Revelation is our faith we stand upon that to know you have spoken and we have heard and we have believed now Lord just help us in our struggles our trials everything that's happening in our life let us just stop and realize Lord even if it looks like the devil is in control Lord we know you are in control amen and we believe it amen and we won't backslide over the devil's deception we will stand firm upon the word today Lord I lift my hands as my signal Lord I believe Lord I believe your word I believe what your Holy Spirit has spoken to me I believe the life that you have given me is ordained of you Lord we claim it amen we Proclaim it in the name of Jesus Christ bless the Saints father speak to their hearts Lord Jesus that we can see clearly who we are Amen in Jesus Jesus Christ Hallelujah can we give a hand clap of praise to the
