service and a perfect song here um we have we're short staff today so I'm going to give brother Alex a chance to get back there um thanks brother Sergey to all his help but um you know this uh tonight I'm just going to share with you what what what I see and you you go home and you study it and uh I have prayerfully very prayerfully for weeks to months God has been moving in my heart and you read something you you listen to tapes and and you you hear a brother Minister and God always pointing you to something but you you know you're not catching it and so for for so long I just was praying and just reading and more more tapes and more sermons and and uh brother Alex I also sent it an email just the audio clip to you and if you can play that um mie when it's time instead that'd be great so I keep this slide going but if not that's right um so just coming up to this and and then just the past few weeks you know um was sharing with Alex there when we were traveling to North Idaho a couple weeks a few weeks ago how the Lord's been dealing with my heart about the fact that you know why do I need any other entertainment but besides the word if if my goal is to be Christlike if my goal is to go on a Rapture shouldn't I be doing everything I can be doing to prepare myself for that and so I really took that to heart and I started to to to spend more time in prayer and more time feeding on the word um and and as I did God began to open to my heart more of what I want to talk about tonight and it's a lot I have never had 15 pages of notes in my entire life and I know we're not going to go through them I know that but if we have another opportunity uh we will be a few parts I'm sure but tonight you know we we uh I've heard it said more than once um you study like there is no anointing and then when you come up to preach You Preach like you never studied so we're leaning on God completely I have things on paper or iPad I guess it's not even paper anymore um but we just want God to speak to our hearts and and if uh if if if something isn't um just just I just it's nothing new it's nothing new I'm like it's like you're going to go skydiving right you just think you're going to die because they have to go over everything just in case so this are the footnotes but if you hear something that you haven't heard before just prayerfully go back to the word and correct me if I'm wrong please amen you want to take your Bibles tonight and stand with me we're going to turn to Revelation chapter 4 Revelations chapter 4 Revelations chter 4 we'll read the whole chapter I know it's Wednesday so everybody's full of energy Revelations chapter 4 you know you always wonder when God gives you sermons like tonight on Wednesday night praise the Lord got to keep your thinking caps on and your spiritual jacket on and focus as best you can he says uh very familiar chapter in Revelations and after this I looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and a Sardis Stone sardine stone sorry and there was a rainbow round about the throne and in sight like unto an emerald and round about The Throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold now there's lots in this um I I have my my general thought that the Lord laid on my heart but there's a lot in these scriptures and these quotes that myself I don't yet completely understand everything but that's that's our goal right that's our that's our ambition is to understand Christ as best and get more revelation of Christ and out of the throne preceded Lightnings and Thunders and voices and there was seven lamps of seven of of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God brother B says that's the seven the seven spirits or the seven Messengers to the church ages and so they're coming from the throne and the throne is Lightnings and Thunders and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal so brother Bram says that was the The Brass sea cuz now this Throne that we're looking at that is the the the the altar or the ark or The Mercy Seat in the holiest of holies because the Tabernacle in the wilderness was modeled after heaven and then now he went from the Tabernacle now it's modeled in us so this is this is now uh the the the brass sea and that's the where they would wash the sacrifices that's the sea of glass like onto Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion second beast like a calf third Beast had a face of as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle these are the cherubs six wing and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever and the 4 and20 Elders F fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory honor and power for thou Hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created and I in verse f chapter 5 and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written Within on the back I don't have it there Alex on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals so now so now the the the Christ on the throne is holding the book so he's on the throne he's behind he's at the mercy seat behind The Mercy Seat and and he just said there was lightning and Thunders and and when the when the priest well I I don't want you to stand forever and it saw a strong angeling with a loud voice who was worthy to open the look and to loose the SE seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was was able to open the book neither to look thereon so John looks everywhere excuse me John looks everywhere and he see he doesn't see see who's worthy there's nobody worthy and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book and one of the elders said saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath preved bailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld lo in the midst of the throne so he sees the lamb come and the seven horns seven eyes seven spirits of God and he takes the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps okay and that's where we'll stop let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we thank you tonight for your word Lord and father you know my heart my heart's desire just to be completely and totally harnessed to the will of the father Lord that we would just Minister your word and your word only Lord there would be nothing of ours in here father you would Empty Me Out Lord to be completely and totally just uh in your in your hands in in your mercy Lord I do not want in approaching your word I do not want to cause error do not want to add to or take from Lord so may you just help us to settle into that place in your Lord with your word Lord Jesus that you could speak to us and open our eyes we pray in Jesus name amen you can be seated so he he doesn't see the lamb the lamb comes and the lamb takes the book from him that sits on the throne and he takes the book and we know that then follows chapter 6 where he he opens the book The Lamb opens the seals now go to Isaiah chapter 6 and savior's spot there in Revelations Isaiah chapter 6 verse 1-8 like I said this is nothing new and maybe you've already you're far ahead of me in your Revelation uh Isaiah chapter 6 now you have to remember one important thing and I ask you to pray for me because I have a lot up here that I've been studying for a long time and and um I don't want to get I don't want to I don't want something to distract me cuz there's a lot we could go this way and that way and I want to stay right right with what God wants to say tonight so in Isaiah chapter 6 you have to remember as we read the scripture that the the the seals were revealed under the Sixth Seal so first through seven were opened under the Sixth Seal and under the Sixth Seal all seven trumpets were were the trumpets were sounded so Isaiah 6 right chapter 6 I'm not trying to make a Doctrine out but brother bam says the Bible is numerically perfect he says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain now the Bible says seraphim but brother bam connects us and says these are the same angels that were the four beasts around the throne with Twain he covered his face with Twain he covered his feet with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I so the house so the house is full of smoke you have to remember when John was looking for the lamb he couldn't see the lamb because the lamb was in Christ Behind The Mercy Seat shrouded by the incense that was burning on the altar the pray of the saints that was going up so he couldn't see it but then the lamb stepped out and he took the book okay so so the there's a smoke fills the fills the the house and then I said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lip lips from mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the Sims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged now remember everything brother BR before he preached s it says God hiding himself in Simplicity and when we try to make it complicated we miss the message we miss the point of everything that was laid out before us everything that was laid out in the word and the point is this right here the purging of our sins we're we're 110% if I can say it in the position now pure vessels because Christ can only inhabit such a vessel so so now here you'll see the the revealing which is the same thing as Revelations 10 1-7 in verse 8 John goes and takes the book Isaiah here he he takes the fire so so so the the opening of the word comes to Isaiah in the form of a coal from the altar from The Mercy Seat which is which is Christ himself the shakina glory of God brother said the shakina of Glory of God now dwells in his people we'll read a quote Here and Now verse eight okay remember numerically it's perfect verse eight also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me John did the same thing in verse 8 revelation 10 1-7 was the was the was the the the the word coming forth which was the the seventh seal the revealing of Christ and then from that on number eight or or as the the the eth the eighth day which is the restart right the Sabbath day the restart the step into eternity the angel says go take the book and then he eats the book so now John must must go prophesy right the type of the Bride Isaiah here saying here am I send me and he said go so verse 9 just the same thing he says go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not now I want to read this part I don't fully understand this but I just want to read it because for me it it's it's just I think it it's it's I think it's important uh the the last part of verse 13 so he's sending him out saying go this is what you have to say and he says the holy seed shall be the substance thereof the holy seed which is Christ which is or the word the word is is a seed that is the substance that's in the bride so yet I don't know exactly how that fits but there you go you can take that home and study that so in in uh Revelations oh sorry can you thank you Revelations chapter 4 he says now the The Mercy Seat now the mercy seats in the heart seat were in the heart seat where The Shining forth of his glory in all of his children the shakina glory in the human heart it's it's amazing to me if you go back and you look what brother Bon preached before he preached the seals and how much he was saying that was yet to be opened to our understanding after the seals the man himself in in ministering as as we'll see he ministers this he talks about the mercy seed is now in the human heart so the mercy seat is in the bride he says he says it's the bride's Ministry so now where is Christ God's provided place of worship where is Christ he's in us okay cuz we'll get we I don't want to get ahead of myself here but he says now the mercy seats in the heart the human heart is that right is that The Mercy Seat how do you come to it through okay he says comes into here through here Shak Glory it's God's presence and when a man's walking or a woman he's reflecting the shakina glory the shakina glory was what the scripture used to talk about the presence of God that dwelt in the mercy seat and the holiest of holies it's God's presence okay he says he didn't okay Jesus then Jesus Christ I have so many quotes I'm trying to just skim through them reflects himself through him with the shikan of Glory doing the same things he did back there manifesting the same gospel preaching the same word amen so now we want to turn to Leviticus uh chapter 16 verse one and and I I never did my title can you pull my title screen brother Alex so my title tonight is the breach revealed in the Feast of atonement if you go back and and you just just take a second to look at the title that brother brandham titles he says the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals so there's a gap between the church ages and the Seven Seals something happens in that space of time he calls it the breach so uh now in in our in our day and age that we live in or the time that we are in we are you can go back to Leviticus 16 here we are we are the Feast of Pentecost has completed the trumpets were comp the Feast of the trumpets you have to remember God ises not always perfectly chronological like we think things can happen at the same time yet it's it's in order in the scriptures but it can happen at the same time so where we are right now is the we have we have moved but the says that the Pentecostal age he said he calls leoa the Pentecostal age so but then he says we have moved beyond that and we are in the briding age Pentecost was the Feast of Weeks or the or the Feast of Pentecost and that was the seven Church ages because it was seven weeks they would wave the wave sheath which was Jesus he was the wave sheath this is what you need to be and they didn't have it they had they had Christ there but they didn't have the the what we have today because without us they are not perfected okay so so you have to remember in time things move in time not not what you have today isn't what they had in in in Wesley's day isn't what they had in in Paul Paul's age oh they had they had they wrote the scriptures they had a revelation but they didn't have what what came to this day which was Christ back the but there says the bride coming of Christ he only says that he only says that line in one in one place and um so so time has progressed so now now the Mysteries being revealed these are the the the the Mysteries the Loose Ends those were the things written on the outside of the top of the mountain and brother and that the junior Jackson had the dream where brother man came and popped the top off and it was white stone that's between the lines that's the revelation of Christ himself the the Mysteries that was part of the completion of the the the of the of his message but that was under Pentecost but now the bride is what we're looking at the white stone at Christ himself revealed in us this is the only age where the word is made flesh in a many membered body Christ poured him Spirit into the church but it wasn't the word made flesh in the first first age that happens today because this is the marriage of the Lamb okay so he had bride down through time but this is the marriage of the Lamb so we we're we the Feast of Pentecost and the trumpets Feast of Pentecost is complete the trumpets we know deals with the Jews and there's still trumpets to sound right because you have uh Moses and Elijah so but this is where we are right now we are underneath this Feast of atonement in time so uh Leviticus chapter 16 y'all already there Leviticus chapter 16 you can you can read the Leviticus 23 lays out the progression so this Feast of atonement is is the sixth Feast like I said the Bible is is perfect numerically perfect I just want to verify yeah so you have there's seven feasts and the Feast of Tabernacles is the last feast and that's the Millennium so the day a told would be the sixth Feast so verse one and we'll probably go to 24 we'll see maybe we'll stop and the Lord spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they offered before the Lord and died so they they weren't supposed to be doing what they did and the Lord said unto Moses speak unto Aaron thy brother that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat which is upon the ark that he die not for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat so again Cloud right obscured can't see behind that unless you go behind The Mercy Seat so he says thus shall Aaron come into the holy place with a young bolock for a sin offering and a RAM for a burnt offering he shall put on the holy Lin coat and he shall have the linen breaches upon his flesh and shall be girded with the linen girdle and with the linen miter shall he be attired These Are Holy garments therefore shall he wash his flesh in water and so put them on and he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering and one RAM for a burnt offering and Aaron shall offer his bulock of the sin offering which is for himself and make an atonement for himself and for his house so the Feast of of at atement was was in the was was like I said after the Harvest um and and I can't remember which month it is but it's it's in the fall so we're coming up close to it in the next couple of months and and before Aaron could go and offer the the atonement for the children of Israel for the whole nation so when they sinned and they knew their sins they had to come and bring a sacrifice for themselves to to to restore that right but this is for the this is a this is a I could be so liberal to say a blanket atonement for everything whether they knew it the entire nation purged but before before Aaron can do this he first has to show himself to the children of Israel a worthy priest a worthy high priest because if he goes in to make an atonement for himself and he is not fit to be in that office he doesn't come back out they pull him out by a rope so just like Jesus First St he goes he he makes the atonement and he comes back he goes down to Hell preaches his he preaches down there and he comes back and and um preaches the souls in prison now right they don't accept it but he comes back right so he proved himself a worthy high priest that he made the atonement Jesus made the atonement just like the type of Aaron as the high priest so Aaron does this and he comes back and the children of Israel see him so now he's good they can trust him to go in and do this work of atonement for them verse 11 and Aaron shall bring the Bullock of sin offering which is for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house he shall okay verse 12 and he shall take a sensor full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small and bring it within the veil I'm going to slow down whatever we get to we get to don't want to rush through this and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord that the cloud of the incense May cover the mercy seed okay okay so again just like John saw there's a there's a shrouding of The Mercy Seat so he looks says where's the lamb which all the while the lamb was behind the The Mercy Seat but then he as the lion of Judah then he steps out as the lamb and he takes the book so Mercy Seat that is upon the testimony that he die not and he shall take up the blood of the bolock and sprinkle it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat okay East word and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle the of the blood with his finger seven times so he does the that's what he does for himself and he does the exact same thing when he does the sacrifice for the atonement of the children of Israel he takes the blood and he goes the Bible says finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward so the the holiest of holies was West it was laid out west so the holiest of Hol so the the very back we call it back it would be the front I guess is is um is do I need to change mics are we good okay is West and then you had you know the different directions so if for in order for for the high priest to face Eastward he has to step you know if we if we had the The Mercy Seat was this chair or these chairs since they're connected and this is the west and then sorry folks over there this this is the the mercy SE Aaron comes from the the holy place he comes into the Hol of holies and he steps Behind The Mercy Seat because he's facing Eastward and he sprinkles the with the his finger the blood seven times Eastward he spreads it Eastward okay and the reason it's Eastward but says he emphasizes it in a quote we have the reason it's Eastward he says or he says pay attention to that so because the only way for that to the reason that that's in the scriptures so we know the location of the high priest when he does this he's Behind The Mercy Seat and he spreads that and that that spreading of the blood there was a type for the seven Church ages it was blood for each Church age but then he says then says but and before the mercy seat so now he comes back from around the mercy seat and before the mercy seat he sprinkles blood seven times and then he goes and and and Israel knows their sins have been atoned for amen so that's that's uh you know we see Christ our high priest comes and reveals himself to us that means we are a part of him I can imagine a shout going up from the camp when Aaron would walk out because they knew everything was covered nothing was left out and that's what this is this is the book of redemption nothing is left out it's all taken care of and he shall make verse 16 an atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel well we can read verse 15 so you know I'm not making this up then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is before that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat he shall make an atonement okay and there should be um praise the Lord we'll stop there so so again these are the scriptures but and then um so he spreads it the same way he did but then in Leviticus 23: 27 he says also on the 10th day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement so that's when that's when the Feast of atonement happens is on the 10th day of the seventh month now the Bible could have easily said the seventh month in the seventh month on the 10th day but it didn't it said the 10th day of the seventh month because it's Revelations 10:7 the Bible has to be perfect numerically everything has to be perfect I used to think that people when they talk like this they were just trying to be extra spiritual but that's not the case but the B labors the point it's numerically perfect and it opens to us what God is doing so Revelations 10:7 would be this point in time this this Feast of atonement this the high priest coming forth in this way and um so in in um yeah go ahead and go to the next quote there so I somehow have that quote in here but not in my notes and he shall take so this is Revelation chapter 4 part three and he shall take up the blood of the bulock and sprinkle with his finger upon The Mercy Seat upon The Mercy Seat watch we're going to get into this after a while East word he says don't forget that word Eastward where's Jesus coming from the east in a Cloud of Glory where does the sun rise Su n rise east where will the s n rise east where was The Mercy Seat sitting towards the east why have I got you all sitting this way towards the east the altar is to the east we'll say it after a while how beautifully I'm going to draw it out sprinkle it Eastward before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times seven times toward the East he says the seven Church AES shall be covered by the blood Hallelujah Jesus Christ's blood just as sufficient in yesterday today and forever all right so in order and and we'll just we'll hold there don't don't go in in order to to that's kind of that's a a foundation and you know our title is the breach revealed in the Feast of atonement and if this if this is where we are so brother brandom brother brandom preaches the seals and after he preaches the seals he preaches Christ as the mystery of God revealed now you have to remember his understanding of this his revelation of this was GR growing just as if you were working through the tapes he's ministering in order and God would reveal it to you as you come to each next sermon was the same thing that was happening to him he didn't preach the seventh seal and then have it all figured out God was opening him himself to him and and he preaches the message so after the seals he preaches the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and I'm sorry this is all the quotes I had time to to put into the slides but I have them if you want them he says God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in that in the bride as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or Creed now Pentecost went into denomination and and every word to the church ages brother says the messenger comes at the end of the age well we've been here for how many years since brother bam has passed away off the scene and God God's not going to break break the system just because we're a latest and age it's got to fit the the program and and brother brandham says I can't see past 1977 and he says you can go through the and look at it where he says the Pentecostal age has closed so as far as the word we're underneath the umbrella of the lean Church ages because time shall be no more in other words a delay in time a delay in time which which is God's grace and God's mercy and God's plan God is Sovereign like I said I don't have everything figured out but there's this delaying time but we are in the bright age I believe we we all of us here understand that but so so then he says it's dark past 77 well that's that's the closing as a messenger comes towards the end of the age that was the closing of the Pentecostal Age and and now and now so then this is this is all kind of happening and the the preaches of seals he's preaching Christ's mystery of God revealed which is the seventh seal and he's and and and so he he's he's beginning to come and you can see it in the sermons that he preaches which you might as well go to the next slide there brother Alex so I I took a screenshot of of the sermons and I know it's small but that that was just what I did I was in a hurry um but he preaches Christ as the mystery of God revealed and and he so I'll finish reading the quotes I have from that sermon he says she is coming back with the pure unadulterated word of God being manifested he says later on he says that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded now you see it what they left off so it's important to remember like I said Pentecostal age that has closed they went into denomination he says that the message will never denominate so Christ turned the corner and we're in the bride age right you have to understand we're still underneath the umbrella of the lean Church age but that he he calls lean Pentecost so it's interchangeable so there was that was the seventh Church Age and and so I want to put you in the place where the Brandon was in as he's preaching these messages after the seals so in order for in order for the lamb to take the book he can't be mediating or intercessing behind The Mercy Seat he can't be spreading blood for these Church ages and go and take the book because he takes the book and he stand before the mercy seat and he breaks the seals open that's the seven sprinklings of the blood before the mercy seat so he can't do both so brother B preaches the seals and God begins to open him to this and he preaches this message which is very pivotal in this so let's let's this is where he is he's seeing it God is opening the word he says that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded he says now you see it what they left off if Luther would have went on it have been here if Wesley would have went on if Pentecost would have went on what would they done now there was only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can follow it nothing else can follow it now The ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there can be no denomination and no not nothing else follow it he says she is ripening into Christlike fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him now really quickly you have to remember where we are where in this point in time where where because like I said time moves on right so some of the stuff history be or prophecy becomes history so in in this point in time there in 6 uh 63 you have you have the two you as in the days and I'm trying to keep this in continuity so you understand as in the days of of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man two angels went down to Sodom to preach and and down there they had they had lot right who was a a make believer and then you have the unbelievers in Sodom but you had those two angels go so that's that's or Roberts and Billy Graham which they're both off the scene now but and brother M says and I wish I got the quote I there were so many quotes I had to pick and choose and I still put too many in but brother brah says when God came down to Abraham he created a body he said a man flesh to step into like a prophet and he speaks to to brother brand Abraham and he says I will visit you according to the time of life and you shall have a son his backs to the tent Sarah laughs and he discerns Sarah's heart so it's it's a sign which is which is exactly what happened in brother bram's Ministry okay and he says he calls Sarah out and everything and all that happens is to show that discernment of the hearts and then he the then the man this the Lord the angel of the Lord goes off the scene or or the man the the the the the the the messenger that was sent goes off the scene but he revealed himself to Abraham because Abraham takes a covenant and Abraham gets the name change before this meeting so Abraham is revealed now all this time taring for the promise all through the church ages they were caring for the promise they were looking to what you have today they were Desiring it they were pressing for it they wanted it Abraham they're pressing for however many years for the prom and then God comes in this channel of time because it had to be a perfect type to today and he and he shows himself so we have the the cloud right just the is the coming of Christ right that is where a lot of people in the message missed it is that Christ came he didn't come in in in in his in his in his in his body form and and take the Rapture he came in his bride the bride coming of Christ and the only way that can happen is if you get the promised son so the message comes to Abraham and then comes forth from there the promised son so that is where where we're at in time right there and then he preaches so you can see he preaches Christ Ministry of God revealed so now I just went straight to Jeffersonville because he says in these in these latter years of his ministry I only preach Doctrine there out there I preach Evangelistic fundamentals in the token he says it's a seed a sign that the seed has been deratization the progression of what he's coming to it's a my own life and I'll raise it up again at the last days and as you walk you have confidence that the Life of Christ is in you if you remember that Abraham had the circumcision he had the circumcision he had the Holy Spirit now that was enough for Pentecost but then when God turned a corner you're sealed by the Holy Spirit and this is where I have to be careful because this is is brother and I have lots of quotes in the token here where he goes back and forth but it is the holy ghost that is what SEALs you that is the token it is the life in the blood he emphasizes it over and over and over again he says the token is the Holy Ghost he says but it's the life so Pentecost got the Holy Ghost but they didn't get Christ himself okay so we as a message we turned the corner somewhere you you could speculate say 77 78 whatever I don't know somewhere we turned the corner and and a and a bride begin to catch the Revelation that it's the promised son manifested inside of us the Holy Ghost was for Pentecost we are sealed by the Holy Spirit we needed that age we needed that time the we the Feast of Pentecost we needed that but then God steps forth himself and he says and he reveals himself he tears the seals off of the book The Book of redemption and he reveals himself to you and I and now we're in the bride age receiving the word himself so brother random is coming to this and he's and he's talking about you know Holy Ghost and and he talks about the astronaut age which I don't know if I have the quote or not he says see how far beyond we are justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost he says it's astronaut age so you could take that and run with that and say well we have to have something more than the Holy Ghost but you got to take that and run that back through the message because he says the holy spirit is the seal so what is he talking about brother man is contradicting himself no you cannot receive Christ himself the promised son in your flesh until you are sealed by the Holy Spirit but you must receive him yes you must catch a revelation of Christ to you you have to there there's no if buts ands about it Having the Holy Ghost now I have to be careful right isn't enough you understand what I'm saying the Holy Ghost seals you and brings to you to Christ but this is where brother R says you can get the Holy Ghost every day of your life and go to hell right anointed by because they're just anointed by it yeah so Pentecost was anointed by the Holy Ghost they had all the signs and the Wonders and if you and I really believe in my heart if you can catch this you can see where we are today in the church because every age prior fought the succeeding age they said Luther said sanctification what are you talking about we're Justified the just shall live by faith Wesley said what is this Holy Ghost you Holy Rollers now Pentecost Now Catch This Pentecost is looking to to you saying where's the signs where's the Wonders yeah and you're over here saying it's the word yeah absolutely see there's a corner that God turned and we'll pray that we're not saying that those who say that are sealed they're done we're not saying that but it's evidence that God turned a corner and we're in the bright age now it's God himself revealed to us because he's not mediating Behind The Mercy Seat he can't be and brother B is coming to that so he says as you walk you have confidence The Life of Christ is in you you are in him by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and seal there by the Holy Ghost among this Believers like this okay we apply the token which is the seal the believer today standing under the shed blood identified with the sacrifice you start to hear him in this message talk about identified identify with the sacrifice he says oh it's not the blood he says his blood went into the ground and it and it went back to the particles that it was made of he says it's the life in the blood and he says he says he says the blood is the token then he says the holy spirit is the token and he says you're identified with with Christ so he goes it sounds like he's contradicting himself but he's covering if if you can say it this way he's covering the perimeter of the Revelation that is that it's the whole thing it's the life you're sealed with the Holy Ghost and you're identified with the sacrifice of the blood see he says see you are identified in your life by your sacrifice that makes you what you are now he says something here very important he says the blood is the token and the token must be applied see or it's not even the Covenant is excuse me not in effect the Covenant was the circumcision that God gave to the children to Abraham so without the token applied the Covenant is not in effect brother talks about the foolish virgin he said they have the seed but they don't have the moisture to make it grow right they didn't have oil in their lamps so in order to to if you will to activate the token you've got to have the Covenant but in order for the Covenant to be activated you have to have the token yeah but he says the Holy Ghost is the token amen you see because he's preaching he's preaching what he doesn't even yet understand but he's coming to you'll see that as we go down through these some of these sermons but he in Genesis 17 verse 10 this to God speaking to Abraham this is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised there's also PR destination in there but Abraham didn't have the promised son he had the Covenant but that didn't give him the son if if if it was if it was just get the Holy Ghost again I think we've laid the basis of what I mean when I say that then then there would have been the promised son but the word had to come to Abraham and reveal himself and make a sign to Abraham the Discerning of the hearts in order for Abraham to get the promise son so it was the opening of the word to Abraham brought forth the promised son so but he had to have the Covenant and that's exactly what brother B was talking about when he's preaching the token he's saying you need the life he says I need to look at you and I need to see Christ because he all these people running around say I got the Holy Ghost I got the Holy Ghost no life to match it right oh I got delivered I got healed so what show me your life James says show me your faith by your Works in other words James wants to see evidence of the token in your life and brother brandham is calling out for the same thing here under the anointing so the circumcision of the heart we know that's the Holy Spirit after the circumcision then came the promised son so there is something more for us there is Christ himself you got the Holy Ghost you're moving on in the right direction you've crossed the river Jordan you're moving unto adoption which is what's the top of the pyramid Christ himself Divine love and brother Brenham I don't if I have the quote I do have the quot so we'll come to that so in in the countdown he says astronauts how far it is back from the old horse and buggy how far it is even from the airplane how far it is from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost they're coming to Eagles the first they were friends excuse me they were lizards then they become chicken and they become crows now they're Eagles no one can follow them when the seventh seal was opened there was a a a silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour there was a white stone nothing written in other words it takes the C Gene of God it takes Christ himself to reveal Christ himself to you it's not written it can't be written because this is a secret not even the the devil understands you see he gets the Holy Ghost he impersonates it all the time because the Holy Ghost will make you run run up and down and shout and do all that they will it can happen but he's imperson but but brother says he will not impersonate now I hope you're moving with me here and in the token again he says the token never come into existence until the evening time God is requiring a token that you your yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it's the only way the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer I'm reading these quotes from The Token but they're not they're not all together in order I'm jumping through here the token is the Holy Ghost upon the church that they see Christ not a third person same person returned again in the form of the Holy Ghost to continue the work on Jesus Christ this today and forever that's the token see he says he says form of the Holy Ghost to continue the work on continues on said the book of Acts he says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the token I'm telling you go back and listen to this to this sermon and you'll see where he bounces back and forth it seems like but he's he's laboring the point it is Christ himself he says remember if that token was not displayed even the Covenant was anold so the children of Israel in Egypt had the Covenant they were all circumcised yet if they did not apply the blood to the doorpost they died the firstborn died you see so so he's not he the baptism of the Holy Spirit seals you but you need Christ himself you need the promised son but if you're sealed of the Holy Ghost you will come to this you see look you can't explain it even as a minister it's between the lies you know I I sent for the Sergey this if you look between between the lines in your Bible it's white it's the white stone okay so and I didn't I didn't make that up so I got that from somebody else but it's all the word so you you you you just have to have God show it to you revelation of it because he hides it right but it's in simplicity so the Covenant was unold there was there was there was no Covenant as long as that token wasn't there so they had proof of circumcision but without the token applied it was anold in other words Pentecost wasn't wasn't enough you see what I'm saying you got to have Christ him Christ in you the hope of glory but you need the Holy Ghost and if you really have the Holy Ghost you will come to Christ I'm going to make sure I back that up because you could really go off the deeping with this right so we need something no we need God what it is when we say something more you need the Holy Spirit to then have God reveal himself to you greater every day passes God opens himself up to you more and is that intimate relationship that brings forth the promised son so there is more there is more but a true b a true child of God with the baptism of the Holy Spirit Will desire the more Jacob but says Jacob had to had to focus on the one thing that mattered was the birthright yeah the token stood for the Covenant so he says the covenants anull without the the token but he says the token stood for the Covenant so it's the life on display that stands for the Holy Spirit the life on display that stands for the Covenant that you have show me your faith by your works for the token had to be it wasn't in effect the token wasn't okay so but but Jesus says in the gospels he says Those Who hear my word and do them right so that's hearing your word takes takes the Holy Spirit revelation of Christ takes the Holy Spirit purges The Vessel you hear the word you revelate of the word and then when you do it you are displaying the token but we're not preaching the token okay yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna stop stop with the token here it was just I got into it and it was just so good okay so now brother brandom comes down and he preaches he preaches Souls that are in prison now and this is in the morning and he's preaching and he's saying the seals are open I'm paraphrasing the seals are open but if they're open the Lamb's not behind the throne and if the Lamb's not behind the throne mediating for the church ages then who can be saved right he's Waring with it's in his sermon he says it looks like it could it be I don't know he says but under the Sixth Seal this is from the same sermon were there were were where these trumpets opened remember under there we find out that the lamb came forth appeared on the scene he left The Mercy Seat his work of redemption was finished and he come forth and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now I can't explain to you exactly everything here because I wasn't born yet when the when the Pentecost and God moved the corner I wasn't born yet so but all these names were written on the book before the foundation of the world okay God doesn't need you to be born to you know complete something like this he's Eternal he's outside of time but he works according to his pattern of scripture okay so he says he had left The Mercy Seat his work of redemption was finished and he come forth and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and time was no more and immediately an angel appeared in the seventh chapter or he says or the 10th chapter and the 7th verse jump with me real quick Revelations 10 verse 7 I think we can most of us quote it by heart but I like to read it anyways Revelations 10:7 now remember this is the Feast of atonement in the 10th day of the seventh month but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets so the prophet had to come to bring this scripture to pass to bring us to verse 8 but he says he says or the 10th chapter 7th verse the angel come down and swore that time was no longer so he's reading he's referencing verse six he's talking about the mighty Angel standing and he has he has I think it was the the book little book open and his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth so he's talking about this he says but you see in this book was what was redeemed it was the book of redemption and everything that he had redeemed was written in that book all that he died for was written in the book he could not leave his mediatorial seat until he had thoroughly redeemed like I said I can't explain the fact I wasn't born yet but that's what he's saying he said he couldn't leave till it was thoroughly redeemed he couldn't redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated in the Lamb's Book of Life he had to stay on there to make intercessions until the last person was finished later on in the sermon he says after the book was taken by the lamb he says the Sixth Seal is revealed and all the seals so the lamb has to take the book in order for all the seals to be open and he knows the seals are open and we know the seals are open so he's confronted with this conundrum this this problem of the fact that if if if the seals are open which I believe they are then the then the Christ isn't mediating Behind The Mercy Seat because you can't do that and open the seals so he says it could be I hope hope it isn't it could be all right he says the lamb had redeemed it but he could not come forth until every name was revealed what does revealed mean in this context born obviously not and that was taking place under the Sixth Seal before the seventh broke then the now remember the revelation of the seventh seal is is opened but the seal itself is is the the culmination of of everything the time and and going off to the Millennium but it's revealed he says then the then the lamb came forth from for for what he had redeemed he comes to claim what he had redeemed it's already got it right there in the book taking it from his hand now he's coming to receive what he has redeemed that's his work he's done he's come to receive it has proven it the seventh seal proved it come back and took the book of redemption then he says it could be I hope it isn't it could be right so he's Waring with this and we read we read Isaiah 6 1-8 and you can read Revelations and and uh oh I'm sorry we read re we read Revelations 7 but you we all familiar with 1 through 7 so I'll just jump here the uh verse eight and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth so the book is opened the book is open so the the lamb had to come break the seals so the lamb is in front of the mercy seat and he sprinkles seven times because he's breaking the seals open that is in the morning but man preaches the souls that in prison now and it's it's it's it's it's it's solemn it's intense he's seeing this what's going to happen now and that evening he preaches he that is in you yeah good I'm I mean Saints I was going through this last night and I just in my office as I as I sat there and I looked at these sermons and the progression of these sermons and the titles that they held I begin to weep and I realize what what a what a first of all I realized what a what a dedication the prophet had to fulfilling God's Will and second I I realized how well that's the most important thing was how marvelous God's word is he preaches he that is in you so he's having this war where is if he's not on the earth seat then how can no more people be saved then he comes and he preaches he that is in you he says now but he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world God in you like he was in Jesus Christ because what all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church see that's God in you he that's in you so now brother catches revelation the mercy seed is in the Bride of Jesus Christ because it's God in you and I read there you you see two years prior to this he preaches how the mercy seed is in the heart so God moves and now he's in the Bride of Jesus Christ and now he says you are Kings and Priests so we are the high priests we are the mediators we we you know if they give you a cup of water they can be given eternal life right there's and and and all of these things so Christ now he says he says go he says Christ and I paraphrase will we continue his ministry in the bride his ministry continues in the bride in the bride age so there there you have he he realizes it's literally Christ in you it's literally Christ made flesh in the people and then and he says and so he preaches and we'll just do this real quick he preaches what shall I so he he preaches souls are now what are we going to do there's no more Mercy then he realizes oh it's he that is in you amen then he says what are we going to do what Jesus called Christ then he goes on he says he says he placed the gifts and then he preaches Church order what is he coming to he's coming to where's it at okay it's further down he's coming to a place because now if it's Christ revealed open to you and Christ comes forth from the breaking of these seals now there's something coming there's something that's going to happen it's called The Marriage of the Lamb he says so he gives Church order he places an order and then there's some some more sermons here but the unveiling of God God Amen this is what's coming forth from the real of Revelation it's Christ in you and he he preached that before but he's seeing it for himself just like we are today and he preaches the Masterpiece Go I mean that sermon he says it pleased him to bruise Christ because it was his Masterpiece when when when when when uh Michelangelo struck the statue that peace broke off only that peace can only fit that statue he says that's a mercy to se he preaches Rec the Feast of the trumpets he clarifies the trumpets and and they reveal them The Sixth Seal recognizing your day and its message future home of the Heavenly badroom so it's like he's talking to the fiance yeah he's saying this is look he says this is how this is how God's gifts works this is what you do with Christ this is Introduction this is Christ this is how this is this is the gifts this is how I want the things set in order and then he says then this and unveils God the unveiling of God he says the the the bail has been rent right so he's going on then he says now this is what praise God this is what your home's going to look like he said that that that he tells a story I don't I know it might be in that Ser he tells a story about the girl who who who going to marry the the was the Armor All boy and he goes back and he builds her a home and he comes back and he gets her right he's telling that story somewhere in here and then he preaches the seed is not air with the Shu so now he says you are going to be married to Christ but there's a separation he says God has been in unveiled to you or the word says God has been unveiled to you now a separation comes separation from what from Pentecost moving into the bride age next slide he preaches this day this scripture is fulfilled then he preaches God's chosen place of worship he says where you already read further I know you did where where is God's chosen place of worship he says where he puts his word where his word is he's identify then he says he says I marry you to Christ that's just a wedding ceremony for somebody you think that was there by accident no way God he says you are Ms Jesus Christ am that's right you see this building up he says what are we going to do there's no more Mercy then he says oh it's he that is in you and then from there he unveils God and it's Church order and this is what your home is going to look like and then we have smack in the middle of this wedding ceremony and then he clears up marriage and divorce why because your husband has old husband has to be dead you can't marry Christ until your old husband's dead that's right and then who is this mzc and then he preaches is the rising of the sun I had quotes for each of these sermons but we're just going to push forward we're not we're going to go back so he preaches the Masterpiece and in the Masterpiece is the first time so go back to there slide I guess I have the remote here but um I'll put it away so he there's the unveiling of God and then he preaches the Masterpiece and it's in the Masterpiece he tells the vision for the first time of the preview of the Bride in the church he had not yet gone there that was the first time God show somewhere in this time frame God shows him this Vision the preview of the Bride he says now I'm going to tell you the tell the vision I don't know that I can interpret it I'm going to tell I'm going to tell the vision for my first time so he tells he he gives he gives a preview of The Bride I don't have the quote here but you can you can go back and find it in the Masterpiece and he says you know I saw the Bride come up oh beautiful lovely lady and then said here's comes the Church of this country or this nation and this nation and the Church of America and they said they had a paper before them and wiggling around doing all this stuff and he said I was just smitten and then God and then he said Here Comes the Bride again he said because it's the Alpha and Omega what she was at the beginning she is now again again today and he says the last few started to get out out of line and and there's a one place you can find it where he says they were looking they were looking to that and and both times he tells the vision both times it tells the vision they're they're they're he says they're walking like the beat of rock and roll and they're walk and then the the bride was walking through the rhythm of like Onward Christian Soldiers so they look off what do they get distracted by could be the music could be the doctrines but they get distracted by the church the last few in the preview of the Bride which is where we are today the last few get distracted in Isaiah it says there is a Highway and a way so the way is perfect there's distractions on either side of the the highway but the way is perfect because it's the bride from the church amen so where does that leave this filthy looking example of a church I don't believe it's it's he does type it to completely how they're in the state of undress but it's also spiritual they've got a paper before them I got the message I got the quotes he yet no life to back it up and the bride gets distracted by the church what is it it's a lot it could be a lot of things but it's also the conflict between Pentecost and the bride age every time God makes a transition there's conflict but now this is it this is it so there are those sealed under the Pentecost age but you know personal opinion those are the folks that were back there in time so he says again in the message after he gives the this preview of The Bride he says the seed fell in the ground at NAA that was the original seed and she's come through the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days I will restore see the Masterpiece is brought up that's the reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time and she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the grain right quick and then he preaches a few other sermons that we've already went over okay this is actually important so recognizing your day and its message he says the time of the Gentiles has been in this Pentecostal Feast so you see how we the Pentecostal Feast is is is wrapped up you have the feast of the trumpets the Feast of atonement Feast of the Tabernacles the Jews fit in there as well as we fit in there so it's not like I said don't have it all figured out it's not always chronical logical how we think it would be he says the seventh is that great trumpet as we had last Sunday the sixth trumpet sounded under the Sixth Seal just like our Sixth Seal open everything at the same time only theirs all sounded at once where we've been 2,000 years in the Pentecostal Feast so that was the church ages because there were seven the the the seven weeks Pentecost that was the Gentile dispensation that was the the the church ages but now you have the Feast of atonement is the opening of the word which also applies to the Jews because they received the atonement underneath the seventh trumpet I think it is so take that you like I said you don't have everything all the angles figured out but it's obvious that this is where we are now as as message people as the Gentiles we're in this it's it's a thin line between now and the end of time I mean where where are we I mean you have all this stuff foolish virgin wise virgin that's P while they went out to get oil the brid grou came we married to Christ on this side so you know are there still more to be saved absolutely are there still wise version coming to Christ absolutely so you see it's not boom boom boom God moves his word I like to say is dynamic right it moves so God doesn't have to fit our our perfect a b c d e f g because he's outside of time so praise the Lord I like this quotes all thrown in here future home of the heav Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride notice this is still not referred to this Millennium Reign the thousand years is not the new Earth see the Millennium Reign is a different Reign that's what we go into the millennium but that isn't the new Earth the new heaven no no no that's just a rest Place see a rest period That's a honeymoon not at all that was my words not at all the new heavens and new earth for you see in the Millennium we have things that would not go into that in other words into eternity into into beyond the Millennium it's a time of a type of the old seventh day out of Eden out at Eden the seventh day after he made the world the seventh day he rested in Eden and the millennium so tribulation will happen the Earth will get burned but it's not a new Heaven or New Earth we'll come back a solto will be there right we'll come back and we'll live here for a thousand years as we should have in the beginning we'll work with nature we build and all these things and we'll live a thousand years and a uh and that's a whole another sermon but he says again he says now remember there is there is Seven Feast days and I can feel youall winding down so we we'll to wrap this up the Feast of the trumpets the Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of the she of sheath waving there is seven great feast days and that was only a type of the seven Church ages and you remember how many sabbaths there are between one and the other see seven sabbaths between Pentecost and the trumpets which was the seven Church ages and there was seven feast days that represent the seven Church ages keep your numbers running okay then he goes on to talk about the eth day and how it's to restart the holy convocation the restart he says um and and he and and he and I'll put this in here with with with with with emphasis on on on on go home and search this for yourself but he says he says right here I'm just going to read the quote and then we're going to move forward when there is no more time then you go into eternity after the seventh Church ages is over and it is lther age is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is over now you go into what eternity eternity no more sevens no more threes no more other there in eternity where there is so no such time as numbers and times and things so you see how easy people can get way off left feel and say well we're in the millennian already but time no longer is a delay and he says the bride of Christ has an eternal quality yeah so right now being a partaker of Christ if you're the word in flesh a part of you is eternal that's right even though you're bound in this earth and bound to this Dimension you are walking in eternity I don't know about you but every day when I open up the word I'm walking in eternity Hallelujah you see it's the fullness of Christ come down for us you don't have the fullness of Christ in you because if you did you wouldn't be here right you have a measure but you're walking in eternity my goodness the word opens up to you Revelation comes and he stimulates you I mean I'm walking in eternity see that's why I said it's not always exactly Verbatim what we think and and and I'm very Analytical in my thinking so I have to overcome that when I come to this kind of stuff cuz all things think well I'm I'm I'm you know I'll get get to worrying that I've got it all wrong but it's like well just read what he said and so he says you cross from that seventh day into the eth I mean verse eight take the book Isaiah verse 8 who will go I I'll go send me yeah so eight eternity that's the bride's Ministry amen okay I think we need to move forward so he he gets down and he preaches it is the rising of the Sun and I wanted brother Alex to play uh this portion of this quote here um if he can so there he spoke to me and said the Seven Seals will be open the seven Mysteries seven F mystery of the Bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we get a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these Blessings Now hearing those Mysteries marriage divorce serpentes all these different questions has been completely uh revealed to us not by man but by God himself let's open those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last days and now as this went up we have the picture outside on the plaque but then I have the picture link present here if you notice as Life Magazine had it but I wonder if my audience visible here has ever really looked at the picture see see and the way it should be you remember I was preaching when this Vision Came Upon the subject of the book of the revelation were the old judges or we've seen Jesus in Revelations 1 when we started to open the Seven Seals of the or the church ages rather just prior to the opening of the seventh seal Christ was standing with hair like wool white and I describ that to you that the old English judges and judges of long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you probably see it from the audience it's Christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes no his mouth just turned the picture from this way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be and can you see it he is supreme judge there's none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a Vindication this message is the truth it is and making him not a third person but the only person with a white see you see the dark his face his beard his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to on the cross that's where he looked to the right where he Pardon The Sinner in the light of his resurrection we still go forth in his name in that sermon that's the first time he tells them turn the picture that I can find and it is the sermon it is the rising of the sun you see what Pentecost missed they missed the coming of Christ where we are today Christ came he had his picture taken perfectly and and and brother bham talks about it and you hear him say like a pyramid because he's got it the wrong way in different sermons he'll talk about look at the cloud look at the cloud and then he preaches it is rising in the sun he says turn he says it's Christ and this comes in in succession to all of these all of these sermons here now this day the scriptures fulfill the wedding ceremony who this MZ it is the rising of the sun that's where we are today saints of God I had another quote here I don't know where it went maybe I didn't see it well I must not have needed it yeah amen we'll close it off right there let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you tonight for your word Lord father just just looking here at this step through the these Revelation and the revealing of your word Lord and how it's come down to where you you've moved from the church ages and now you're in a bride the word has been opened and now you step forth as Christ in the unveiling of God the Masterpiece and father near the close of the prophet's Ministry he preaches the sermon it is the rising of the sun father you have and it's in that sermon Lord he says the bride coming of Christ the only place he says it the bride coming of Christ father you have come in this age your ministry is in US father what a privilege what what an honor and what a sacred

Pentecost we want to be the wife of Jesus Christ Lord may you just come tonight Lord what was sad maybe was there was parts of it maybe were hard to understand or hard to to to stay with Lord may you just pull all of that together and put it in our hearts that we could go home and and chew on it Lord we love you Lord we thank you Jesus name we pray amen you see Saints he he shifted he had to move from Pentecost to the bride age he had to breach the church ages and the seals he had to open the word and when he did he closed one and he moved into the next and we have to move with Christ and and what the devil wants us to do is is he will even so much as cloak himself in Pentecost he wants us to and but and you could find quot but says go back to Pentecost so I'm not talking about that right I'm not talking about that I'm talking about Pentecost the age Pentecostalism the age and I'm not talking about pointing fingers at people who run the aisles I'm not talking about that talking about everything that goes with that the Traditions the the ideas of of how church go right it's been laid out in the in the word church order it's been laid out in the word how we conduct ourselves how we dress the music that we listen to the what we feed on everything there's this whole culture bound into the Pentecostal age and if we're not careful we'll try to drag that in now and we'll have that little doohickey hooked to our tuning fork and we won't sound to the word right see like I said this goes every direction possible Right Here amen let's stand tonight can we sing that song um that I
