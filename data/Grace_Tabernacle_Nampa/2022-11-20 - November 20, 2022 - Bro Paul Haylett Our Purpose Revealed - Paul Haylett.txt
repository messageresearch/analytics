coming soon he's so good to me Hallelujah we say Amen to that Saints praise the Lord Hallelujah amen just have just a couple quick things to say here let's not forget communion this afternoon at five o'clock and uh I know there'll be circumstances probably hinder some maybe from coming but let's do our very best amen just to fulfill the word of God what the what the word has spoken to us um want to uh just remind everyone hard decision for me to make but there'll be no Wednesday service and uh consequently we just ask the Lord to just give each one of you a blessing a Happy Thanksgiving amongst family celebrate that let's remember the real real reason we're thankful it's not for houses or lands or fine clothes but it's for his Precious Blood his love redeeming power amen that he has for us and so we just want to remember a Thanksgiving Day brother Trevor sister Kerry will be enjoying the fine amenities of El Al so let's just lift them up in prayer we're happy to have our sister Elisa to come down to visit and say hi or not buy we don't have goodbyes but you know uh might be a little while before she gets to see her her dear friend sister Emmy again so glad to come and and sister Alice and sister Andrea uh you know uh we don't save pews but we could make arrangements to uh you know just happy always happy I enjoy their Fellowship so much and so um brother Jason's dad and mom uh didn't make it here this morning no doubt just spending that time with family but uh we love our brother Gill sister Karen find a Affinity with them and so let's just always remember to lift one another up in prayer and let's always just look on the bright side Saints we have so much to be thankful for we come into this Thanksgiving season which a nation then pours out all kinds of decorations and efforts and you know it's good the world says it it goes back uh you know the United States I should say it goes back to to to uh Plymouth Rock and the pilgrims and all of this but our Thanksgiving goes back even before go golf a hill even before man understood it goes from the foundation of the world and the fact that we are in Christ and so blessed that the word has been opened to us let's let's be thankful all the Days of Our Lives now I want to put just a little bit of a disclaimer that no prior conversation no prior knowledge young adults but I just had went down uh in the basement just a few minutes ago and I had to because it's just my nature look around the corner and see what's on the young adults board there and I'm telling you it's not collusion it's not conspiracy it's Christ and uh so let's just stand and turn in our Bibles to II Timothy the first chapter verses 7 through 9 and um just kind of give me a little uh and give me just a I don't know a little spark I just was down there and you know I've never really tried to jump and click my heels since I've got older but I was just I looked on the board young people young adults and I was just like praise the Lord and if any of you need to understand you can just go down after church and look on the board and you'll understand first or second Timothy 1 7-9 for odd hath not given we've got to get our halves and haves-nots correct for God hath not given us the spirit of fear we can say Amen to that can't we but we need to also give equal Amen to the very next portion but of power he's given us power Saints not to just sit around and wonder what is happening but power as Sons and Daughters of God nowhere will you find the scripture declaring that we should back away from the word of God in any time shape form or fashion and sometimes that hurts sometimes it's just painful to face our reality but that's what God called us to do for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God verse 8 might be a tough one in the flesh to deal with but in the spirit it moves us into a whole different position who hath saved us sorry I'm breaking this down but I just want to make these points before we move on hath saved us past tense not when you get good enough I will save you he says I have already saved you and called us with a holy calling not according to our works come on Saints let's just face it we we just say well we don't believe in a Works gospel while we're working while we're trying to do everything we think God would be pleased with we're working because it's a nature that God has placed in US amen but there comes a time when our works always come short that we have to realize the rest of this verse not according to our works but according to his own purpose in other words he claimed ownership of this purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began now if we can ever recognize Saints we can never recognize and grasp this it will bring a peace in our life that we can move forward with confidence and faith and say Lord this path you set me on I have stumbled over every Rock and I have fallen in almost every Briar Patch but you said I would make it and I am going to believe that and I'm going to act upon that because I believe you were talking about me amen I got a little excited here I jumped right over the beginning of things here I want to speak to you today and our purpose revealed see God wouldn't give us purpose without showing us what the purpose was and how to fulfill it Heavenly Father we just ask you this morning Lord just to come down in our midst speak to our hearts and Lord just thank you Lord for your grace your mercy your kindness to us Lord that you would just continually woo us to you you're drawing us to you father and father it becomes alive in us and Lord so many thoughts so many things that we've studied so many scriptures and quotes Lord but I pray today Father you would just allow us the Lord to articulate what you desire to be spoken and we ask this in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen Hallelujah you know God is good he is so good to us now sometimes we look in the world around us and we kind of wonder what is going on and making knives uh the influence is there are in the world today you know if you go and study this you'll find that this has been recognized even in the carnal world how influence or perception can be and this is why many times you'll see the pretty girl draped on the hood of the car because they have figured out that some sub such subtle messages are effective now those are obvious ones my brother and sister but Satan you see has come and recognized that he can give all kinds of subtle Direction subtle influence and we would say that uh you know we we really don't believe it affects us as Believers but you better believe that it affects you and we'll we'll touch on that a little bit more we are living uh in a Time increasingly that people specifically you'll see this amongst young people you will see this a young amongst young white males is one of the most predominant deals that they are going through life and will openly declare that they do not recognize any purpose for their life it is almost as though it is a disease that is spread in the minds of of people that they're going through life without any purpose they will they will voice questions like I don't even know why I am here what is the reason of my being and so as this goes we'll find that uh we'll see that there's always there's the prophet of God said every time that God is doing something Satan will come he's always a little behind right because he's not a Creator he's an impersonator he's the counterfeiter and so there has to be a real to be a counterfeit and the real comes out first but it's not long behind that that the counterfeit comes and so as God is coming in the hour we're living in and I trust that we as Saints of Grace can say Amen to this we see that God is focusing down to understand what our purpose is that why we're here and what we are facing and as God is bringing us into an increasing Focus my brother and sister Satan has come and he's loosing in the opposite to get the action and he's literally robbing the purpose or if there is purpose the purpose has been contaminated we'll find that it's one thing that we must work in the part of the the wages as it is is a reward for work and greed effect of that which one desires to accomplish or uh acquire more than is necessary more than is beneficial more than is is a blessing and so you know um it is there that Satan's coming he's trying to counter this and so God is coming in an hour the revealed word of the hour my brother and sister was not just to tell the world that Jesus is coming again we can read our Bible and get that but God said I'm going to come down and go right back into the beginning and restore every part of the word in its correct place so that we can understand that it's more than just Jesus Christ coming back for a people but he's coming back for a specific purpose and those people are not going to be now I'm not doing away with the 11th Hour worker but by and large my brother and sister God is choosing to use a people to fulfill his word and so God could do that he could use nature he could use trees or whatever and he does but God specifically chose us in His image to come and fulfill the word of God and we're living in a day whether they are Christian born in Christians home raised in in church or whatever there is an apathy that's coming upon the people uh kind of a lethargic reaction without Direction and you'll see this my brother and sister and the world we live in today and um it brings in such a nature such a fashion that people don't look out and have a vision for the future now the word of God says that to without a vision the people perish and we are Sons and Daughters of God are not just coming to church to check off a box on the calendar that we came to church today to be able to count up I went to church X number of times this last year that should be sufficient my brother and sister it's not of our works it's of his purpose and so it's there that God's purpose was not for us to check the box on the calendar but our purpose is to be revealed in the word of God so if we are in the word our purpose will be revealed to us see we cannot come and be in the will of God in the word of God without recognizing what our purpose is and so as we see this we see the nation heading the direction that it's hidden we see the nation coming manifesting certain things in the world we live in today we'll look at this and I have to say for myself and I believe that you would agree with me that if it weren't for the fact that God had opened our eyes to the direction to speaking specifically to the United States if God had not opened our eyes to the direction this nation must go we would be in as much mental turmoil as the rest of the world but we see that God's word being revealed has revealed there is a purpose behind this whole plan and in that we'll look and in 1956 the prophet of God declared that year he said they'll either accept or reject Jesus Christ as a nation this year and my brother and sister I have done the research spent the endless hours of studying and cross-referencing and you will find my brother and sister the rise of all problems you might say in our nation begin in that time frame and as it was people blame it on those returning from the war those that were coming we went into the Korean War it went on into the late 50s early 60s the conflict in Vietnam which tore our nation apart and people that say we believe these are the influences the whole hippie uh love movement all of the these are the reasons my brother and sister those are the effects they were not the reason they were the effects and so it's there that God's anointed a prophet to say they accept Christ or they uh reject him in this day and it is a season and of a time my brother and sister we're seeing the fruits of rejection we're seeing what is happening to a nation that rejected God so you see it didn't happen overnight they didn't reject God in 1956 and 1957 chaos broke out but it's just like an apple setting on on the rail it will look good for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks now follow this but as a season of coldness comes it actually has a preserving effect so we think the apple is going to be okay but inside internal down in the deepest of the deep which we would call the soul Realm the apple is decaying and the first hint of heat all corruption manifests itself that's what we're seeing you say well where's the heat in our nation our nation's getting cold away from God this bride my brother and sister has an atmosphere that she is on fire she is the Heat and so God is now bringing forth a heat in the land that is causing the corruption to be manifest you see if it was only lukewarm and cold it could endure for a long time but there's some heat that's coming forth being manifested in the day that we're living in so you look at this my brother and sister I would say today that the rejection of God's plan in 1956 has affected every one of us are you not daily affected by the spirit of laodicea of the things of this world we are affected and that's why God has been so loving so kind so gracious to give us the warning he says look if you just sit on the Pew if you just sit there and you do you're not going to just sit there and get hotter and hotter you're going to sit there and get older and colder and of course we can see that in the natural sometimes uh it's my own fault as it words sister Jerry will call me and tell me supper is ready I tell her I'll be there in a minute and 50 minutes later I show up now I cannot complain to my wife that she served me cold food because she did not she served me hot food I failed to come and partake and the word of God the fire of God the Holy Ghost is just as hot today as it was when he said come out of her my people it's just a matter of whether we decide to come or not or wait but you see what's happening my brother and sister in our nation we're reflecting another leadership that's why the word of God said come out of our people and this is why we can sing songs like this world is not my home because we're under a different leadership and that's why what we see in politics and all of these the all of this greed and all of the things that are taking place we're seeing another leadership because Lucifer said you know what I want to rise I'm just paraphrasing this I want to rise above his throne I want to rise to the highest Pinnacle the highest peak and he declared that he was going to and so what he was basically saying was is I have leadership skills I have something that will pull the people even the very angels of God he had sway over them to pull them now look at us mere mortals a whole world now being sway being drawn I just saw a picture the other day if they hadn't said it was a man I wouldn't have recognized it was a man high heels on shave legs with some kind of stalking with this big white dress and doing and kind of the weird spiky hairdos they do with all these dangling earrings and they were giving this is for in Europe they're giving this man some kind of a award that he's accomplished some great thing and if you looked at this you would you would just look at this and go that that is so ludicrous if I was to show you a picture whoever designed his clothes had to been on something and they were an anointing from the pits of hell and they're now raising up and giving awards to men like this that's no man I'm telling you that man could not survive a day outside of his Satan's created Eden now it sounds judgmental and I don't mean it judgmental In the Flesh the man's got a soul I'd like to see that Soul saved but this is the effect of the rejection this is the effect of allowing Satan to rise to a pinnacle see there's a lot of things that we don't understand Saints can we say Amen to that a lot of things we don't understand but that's one thing I want to drive home to you today no move of God is ever wasted we might be sitting here this morning saying there was a time in my life that God dealt with me and it would be and the devil would be saying see that's your only opportunity God's moved on but I'm telling you if your sons and daughters of God and we'll touch scripture here in a few minutes you're a son or daughter of God no move of God in your life is a wasted move and so we'll find ourselves sometimes having got cold got lukewarm and cold and we're there and we wonder would God ever move in my life I want to give you reassurance today that God is setting a stage in your life because that seed cannot be lost it cannot be departed it cannot go away my brother and sister and so God is moving and it's like as it were we referenced it sometimes to like a a game of chess and there's moves that are made and Satan's moving here and there's times that Satan would say Checkmate but you know what God gives Supernatural inspiration for us to move into another position and Satan's trap Falls it fails it can accomplish and we see this I'm telling you no move is wasted if God wants you in the wilderness my brother and sister I don't know I'm not going to put anybody on the spot today but I believe probably in our midst today there would be some that would say you know what I feel like I'm in a Wilderness there's a purpose for you being in the wilderness if you I feel like I've been thrown in the fire there is purpose for you being in the fire you know no matter where you're at spiritually or naturally this bride of Christ now we're just humans right and we have no way to come to a point to say I know you're a son of God I can take a little DNA and go prove that but my brother and sister the DNA of God is how we respond to the word and when you respond to the word of God you recognize then that couldn't be me I'm just flesh and blood and I can do ancestry.com and trace my family right back generation Generation generation there's no God in my family my great great grandmother did not marry a god but yet the very DNA of Sons and Daughters of God chose where we come from and people would say well you guys are a little bit arrogant because you think that you are something special I don't think I'm something special the word showed me clearly I am special and it's not me and my flesh it's the word it's the word saints that said we were special it's a word that declared our position and I believe the word can we say we're Believers this morning I'm a Believer amen and so this bride of Christ no matter where it's at spiritually naturally she's been made to be an overcomer she was not just by chance going to overcome a little here and a little there you see what you're facing is God is bringing you into a position where you recognize as a scripture that I opened with that you have been blessed with power now that power is only to be manifested with us in a correct position in the word right the prophet of God said you don't really have power you have authority but yet my brother and sister if you have authority to unloose the power you have power but God would anoint the bride right just like it is for money you know he used to be around the message we'd never talk about money over the pope but that was just almost like too carnal but my brother and sister if you need you have a need in your life and you're sincere you come and ask the Lord he says ask for some things in my name anything but you see what separates this bride from the religious world is the bride's not going to say I need a 7 000 square foot house I need a Bentley I need a Lear jet I need this I need that I need that I need a million dollars in the bank the bride will never do that but if the bride has need and she comes in sincerity God said I've never seen the word says I've never seen my children begging bread somebody say but I'm flat broke well look yeah you have to determine then what is begging see God has a way of providing God has a way of moving and a lot of that has to do with our perspective see spiritually are naturally this bride has been made to be an overcomer and the reason my brother and sister as the prophet of God just sharing some of those stories he says you know these other birds they they can fly really really high but they can't fly as high as the eagle and so this bride has been brought into a position uh handcrafted as it were by the grace of God to rise up and live in Heavenly places and now I could take you to the quote but I won't because you know I'm telling you the truth the prophet of God says we are guilty of living below our privilege now who are we going to blame come on we've all played the blame game at some time in our life who are we to blame if we are living below what God declared is our privilege we can't blame God we have to come back look in the mirror and say you know what what's hindering me is me and so Lord help me come then when I would ask I would ask in sincerity not a miss and that you would come now look our Joshua I love reading the book of Joshua come on Church our Joshua was declaring to us today rise up at once and possess the land and that's not an empty command he says because you are more than able to it's not I'm sending you out there to be slaughtered in laodicea he's there declaring possess your land but our land is not real estate in this state or any other state our land is a spiritual Kingdom and so he's telling you you are more than able to go possess this land rise up at once I love those passages in Joshua rise up at once and take the land but look at the Spirit of the age look at the spirit that 1956 has brought to America that people would say I want that but won't cross the street to go to church won't get out of bed to go to church won't do a lot of things but they want it there's something down in their soul that they're craving that but they won't put out the effort and you say but it's not works brother Paul yes it is the prophet of God gave that as it were indictment that they would not even cross the street to go to church so what was it the word says you ought to be in the house of God we can apply that across a lot of different fronts okay not just about coming to the house of God but our Joshua said rise up at once and so if we will just follow Joshua's command imagine the Bible would be a whole different book if Israel had listened to Joshua whole different book my brother and sister but you see it just wasn't in them it just wasn't in them so many times in so many places the ministry not entirely responsible but so many times in so many places the ministry says I don't I don't want to offend them I'll just water this down they have good intentions don't they I love you I wouldn't want to hurt one of you but I tell you how much I love you I love you enough I will preach this gospel that it will get you in a rapture that's real love is not making you feel warm and fuzzy not making you just I feel so comfortable in church that's not love my brother and sister Real Love is going to say that you need to get that out of your life you need to get on fire you need to get this and re-establish these things in your house and in your family and in your life that's real love the rest is called pandering yeah but the world would interpret that as being love says my love is corrective now do you want my love as a natural man or do you want God's love amen because me as a man would be prone to make it easy on you me as a man would never want to have a sharp edge to what we're preaching but Christ in me Christ in any holy ghost-filled preacher is going to look at you and say you know what all I really care about I care about the natural I care about these things of your life I care about the Troubles of life but what I care most about is you standing Before the Throne of almighty God you standing in his presence is what I really care about but look at the Spirit of laodicea look at the age we live in you tell me as you study as you read as you listen if the prophet of God did not hit it on the head over and over and over again concerning what this day would be like they're looking for the educated tall beautiful handsome curly-haired and then no offense meant then anointer virtually a child a young man like her brother Tim Pruitt didn't make him some poster child a man with a little bit of handicap and these kind of things and a gravelly voice and whatever and then when he preaches the power of God goes out and touches lives and changes lives as it was as it would be sorry to make this connection back to her brother Tim but just as they said about Jesus there was nothing to attract you to him and the prophet of God says they'll be attracted to this fine churches find choirs beautiful singing almost in their streaming the church will run it through a program that gives us about a 10 second delay so if anybody makes a blooper we can cut it out do you want Jesus Sermon on the Mount edited or unedited you realize that Satan doesn't mind a Wilderness experience he actually looks for it and the reason is is it gives him more opportunity to throw more roadblocks or obstacles in your way for you to overcome you know what the devil is out there when Israel's coming out of Egypt he's rejoicing look he could have just walked over the promised land but hey now they're going out here and what it did now we understand the Judgment of God Satan didn't have any influence on that you might say in that judgment but you see Satan was there saying that's the right decision send them out into the Wilderness for 40 years and just let them die off in their unbelief but there was a generation come on there was purpose my brother and sister for the Wilderness there was a generation that looked at that and said I love my daddy I love my mama I love uncle and auntie and I love all these people but I'm never gonna get caught in the same trial and if God says walk I'm going to walk if God says speak I'm going to speak if he says Sing I'm going to sing if he says worship I'm going to worship and when the word comes I'm going to let him know I believe Lord I'm over here in the corner in the far back corner of the congregation I believe and It produced a people that were not free of doubts remember those that come and said hey uh this side of the river is a land for cattle and we're people men of cattle we we just want to say here Joshua didn't say I'll go make a reference and see what was Joshua had already heard the prophet Joshua already knew what the word was Joshua responds right there says you'll either cross over or you'll die just like your parents young people Saints of Grace we got no place to say we believe God sent a prophet and we just settled down on that we don't do anything we have to cross over we have to get on the other side and experience what it was to enter the Promised Land then if we come back on this side right here and God blesses you with a nice job a nice home a good family some of the amenities of life that's wonderful I have no qualm about that but we've got to get on the other side first or all of this over here in La Lucia will corrupt us will destroy us tear us apart but you see the bride of Christ doesn't mind the Wilderness either this might come across as a strange thought to you but maybe not hope not we should not mind the Wilderness called laodicea because it's giving us more opportunity to say woe is me no it's giving more opportunity to say look at that brothers and sisters that looks bad to my flesh but my spirit says that looks like victory that looks like a Bible I'm going to win and I haven't even entered into it yet not as a victory I can stop right now before I even Drew my sword and Mark another victory you see that's the bride she's not contained in the spirit of laodicea she's contained in the spirit of the word which is the Holy Ghost amen she's not looking at this woe unto me that we're here in this world and the things of this world and the impact on my family from this world it is a victory I'm going to claim my unsafe family I'm already declaring them in the name of Jesus Christ I believe that because otherwise what are you going to pray for woe unto me Lord my children are lost that's not the prayer of the believer and you can't just say well I put them in the Rapture you can't do that either but I'm telling you you can come down and you can enter in and be the intercessor in prayer intercessor Before the Throne of God and first and not first and foremost but amongst the top you can live this Living Word in front of them oh children we can be Overcomers as we crash and burn oh we will crash and burn it's just human nature but we're going to go down fighting we're going to take a breath and we're going to rise up fighting oh my brother and sister the problem is is we just go down whimpering and if we do come back up it's still a whimper hmm this bride's going to look at this and say look at that God's given me another opportunity to overcome not that I might but to declare it I am going to overcome this situation look Church young people whoever it might be you're sitting here right now you've got to struggle in your life and you realize that's keeping you from being on fire for God I would ask you in your heart outward however you want to do it to come and say Lord change my words change my vocabulary let me be there saying Lord I believe your word and this trouble and this stroke struggle I'm in the trouble I'm in it's big it's before me but I will overcome it I am an overcomer not a might be could have been once was I am right now an overcomer in Christ Jesus oh Hallelujah God giving you that recognize your purpose my brother and sister you see it's all a matter of perspective not us saying oh no another trial I don't like them as much as any anymore than anybody else I don't like them you know believe it or not God's use farming to temper me on some of these things as a young boy my dad used to say farming he'd say if it's the living breathing it will die if it's a machine it will break and there's nothing like getting a phone call from an employee saying you know the pump that's mounted on the right side of the bell housing or the hydrostat of this machine yes just blew up there's about eighteen thousand dollars my life is over if God loved me this would never happen no okay Lord thy will be done I'm going in the Rapture anyhow this is all going to burn if I can just figure to leave you put this to you'll come back to earth and there's going to be a little spot right there and you're going to realize that was all my farm equipment that I valued so much as everything I play so much value is this little pile of molten metal right here and God's going to say you place value on this see the battle we have to fight with God says you know what fiery trials anybody had any lately what are they for to make our trucks break down our tractors break down and this breakdown and that breakdown and empty our bank account no sir he said it's for molding your bank account character and if you could stand before God and say Lord what would it take to mold my character into a son or daughter of God and he said everything you've got standing in his presence you would say it's yours Lord but we here in the flesh hold on we claw oh oh bro it's a dollar and God's saying where are you placing your value what is your purpose now you know as well as I do in the flesh we'd like to all have a hundred thousand dollars in the bank versus one dollar that's a carnal fleshly thing but when you recognize God doesn't see value in anything other than the word that we see value we're looking from two different perspectives God says you know like you've no doubt heard the jokes you know or the guy shows up in heaven good Christian man but he shows up in heaven a couple suitcases full of gold and the angel up there says oh more pavement yeah that's about how much God places value on what we place value okay let's move on here you see we must God giving us opportunity to overcome you see but the real Victory is recognizing what our purpose is a matter of perspective we can say oh no another trial or we can say oh my look another victory it's all in our perspective my brother and sister and when we recognize our purpose for being here it will change our whole view of the world we live in and when we see things around us we'll recognize this is not about Flesh and Blood this is not about uh this issue or this issue or this issue this is about principalities powers of Darkness but mostly focused on this is about me and the word it's not even now this sounds a little harsh my brother and sister but it's a two-way two-edged swords waves here you see it's not about me wondering what's wrong with you I'm just really going to focus and figure out what's wrong with this brother or this sister you know what Lord help me judgmental Spirits you know where they come from the man who is not bold enough to pull the beam out of his eye we're too big a coward to pull the beam out of our own eye but we're going to fix everything for everyone else you know why because pulling the beam out of your eye is painful I don't have enough prayer life I'm not reading my Bible faithful enough I'm not in the house of God like I should I'm not praying that's what happens when the beam comes out Spirit of laodicea has come and affected me more than I thought my music is no longer okay how I dress is not correct how do you say this my stomping and pulling the beam out of our eye and I love that story about how you know that lady she's just really down on that lady look at her house it's so dirty her yard her windows one day in a fit of inspiration you guys know this story she goes out and washes her windows and she looks out and she's like oh praise God the neighbor finally did something about their house pulling the beam out because you see until we get the beam out Saints we could sing and shout and dance about and it won't do us one bit of good amen Lord help us I'll lift my hand first and say Lord help us help us Lord because you see what God's doing is bringing us a place that when it comes so close it would deceive your vision will be so clear that's not the word that is the word rightly dividing able to discern the spirits of the age able to come to the place that you see Christ as the prophet of God said you see Christ in everything you mean the wickedness out here we see Christ in that yes sir it's the word fulfilled he he prophesied the word must be fulfilled oh my we have went so far south amen I know we're still on here but so look at this now Saints sorry I'm going to say this just kind of I'm not going to water it down for any of you some of you have just been sitting around and decided that it must be just your trial of life to be Satan's punching bag here I am devil beat me up again there's one thing between having a trial and putting yourself in a position be Satan's punching bag because in a trial my brother and sister you have decision to decide do I move forward do I camp here in the wilderness of sin or do I go forward do I detour you know at Moab what do I do at Moab what do I do here when I get to Katie's Barney what am I going to do you have decision but when you have given up and you just stand there and let the devil beat on you you will not see the spirit of being an overcomer you will not be as it were fighting the good fight of Faith you are just hoping somehow you will endure this I'm here to tell you today if you don't have a vision to know that God has already given you power by the word to bind those spirits and to move forward oh does it apply it does my dear wife is so loving and kind of money embarrass her right now and I'm sorry to do this but you know what Thursday morning she looked me in the face and says having a little trouble living what you preached last night I had to go off and cry because I was I was there just you know what's the little guy in the cartoon that had the little rain cloud over his head wherever he went was that lioness or one of those guys you know you know my own personal see it's raining here until you consult the man who turns on the light and you say you know what Lord I I walk out of the house I can pick up I drive off and say Lord I'm not going to be defeated today I'm not going to be defeated so it sounds a little harsher my dear wife to say you know are you having trouble living with church last night but you see God knew I really needed to hear that because I needed to tell the cloud go away I'm done with you go away I'm not going to be defeated I spoke the truth I can reinforce it by the word of God I can take it back through the message I can run it through the filter it goes I'll have to say oh a little went through I guess we're okay no it all went through the filter amen so Satan get out of here I'm not going to be depressed I'm not going to be overcome by your spirit of laodicea I'm going to stand on the word in spite of what my flesh feels like Hallelujah you see I'm not here to testify of defeat and neither are you amen we're here look this is a calling God has given to Sons and Daughters of God we are here to defeat Satan and glorify Jesus Christ that is summing down bringing down our purpose of being here oh I'll tell you what I just had to cut so much out of this slot because it was going to be too long and it still will be but my brother and sister the prophet of God said the purpose that you have on this life is to defeat Satan sister Andrea Hallelujah Satan you want to put this on me you're defeated the devil would say but no no butts amen Ephesians I'm sorry Saints I have just barely have got started here Ephesians 1 and 6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted imagine you're walking down the line there and you're coming and you're doing we were talking Sister Lisa we were visiting last night talking you're going along in these things and the devil's just reminding you oh you did this and you did that my brother and sister you got to remember there's a transformation taking place and he didn't say when you've made yourself acceptable he said I made you acceptable I'm the one I know it did this you just stand and let me work you stand and let me come and accomplish my purpose in you Hallelujah in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known when people say there's things that God has not brought and you have no right to claim it my brother and sister my Bible says he's made known unto us the mystery of his will do I comprehend it all I'm not speaking down on myself but I'm probably amongst the least intelligent there is in this building right here but God never said Paul your IQ will save you what he said was is your faith oh Hallelujah I'll get excited about that my has nothing to do with where I was born in the family uh what the birth order was what state I was born in what nation I was born in on the dark side on the sunny side or whatever side nothing to do with that he said my faith is there deposited in you and you are now receiving that faith and by faith you will overcome by faith you will manifest the very purpose I put you on the Earth oh Hallelujah is it okay to be excited today amen having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure with which he hath purposed amen in himself you realize my purpose your purpose is not even anchored in US a PhD or a high school dropout big and strong or weak had nothing to do but I tell you what you'll find in The Believer faith giant sized faith and it won't matter what the world thinks or how the World Views it or what the results as it were of them physical accomplishment of this world is none of that matters faith you can preach about 10 sermons right off of that one right there which he has purposed in himself you realize my whole purpose your whole purpose is his purpose I don't have no message identity of purpose I don't have no church identity of purpose I don't have no certain Minister identity of purpose I have purpose in him well our family's totally messed up is that your purpose we're poor is that your purpose rich is that your purpose no those are called crutches you don't see healthy people walking on crutches let's be healthy dispensation fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance I like that idea I like obtaining an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who has worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be the praise the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that she heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise how beautiful we set solid not shaken by every wind of Doctrine and doubt and fear we set solid and in the end it all comes down that he says you know what I'm going to do I'm going to give you this inheritance the earnest of it until the Redemption of the purchased possession until the you know what I've got brother Trevor and I just visiting a little bit about that I just keep coming back uh running into quotes where brother Brown's talking about the diamond and how even the chip off of the diamond it's still the diamond it's not throwed away I might be the least in the Kingdom my brother and sister but I'm in the Kingdom amen now God made me a part of the body of Christ and I'm gonna claim that I'm going to stand in that I'm going to confess that because I recognize now that I have purpose now First John 3 7-9 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous and he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested isn't that amazing for that very purpose he was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him you know what the devil's after says he's not after your brain he's not after your muscles he's after the seed that's what he wants but you know the devil can't take the seed from you but he can convince you to give it to him but even the word said whoever is born of God now okay let's stop for a moment you don't have to shake your head you don't have to lift a hand you'll have to do but we have sinned face it we have send so how can you reconcile yourself to that right there I was born of God but yet I committed sin I mean my mind says I sinned but your life through the blood comes out pure white Before the Throne of God scripture says I won't even hold it to their account is that not an awesome God we serve isn't that awesome beautiful I just want to just Rejoice I want to run up down the aisle here my brother and sister because God says I knew what your flesh did but I know who you are and I cannot even that's what it really comes down to I cannot even hold that to your account because I have made you a part of me and I am sinless so if I am sinless and you are a part of me there's no way on Earth you can be a sinner oh thank you Lord hallelujah amen so while we're trying to be over here and we won't go to church because we've done this and we won't go to church because we've done this and we won't go to church because this reason and we won't pray because I and we won't read our Bible because forget it my brother and sister recognize God said you have a seed and my seed is that seed that remaineth in you everything else will be tore apart even families will be fractured down to the very core of their lives and people will be upset about these things and all this falls apart kingdoms falling down economics falling down America my brother and sister the prophet of God said even now she is bankrupt right that terrifies me as a man that does business to think I'm doing business in a nation dealing with banks and everything else that are all bankrupt but I'm telling you my brother and sister the word of God come and says that all right I will cause the spirit of the age to take care of you I will create a harbor for you I will give you a piece of escape to run into and I will feed the sparrow I will feed you don't worry about it when the day comes I will take you home and let the Judgment say has been heaped against the Nations will come and it will pour out like a flood over them and we don't need to be sitting here having a mental breakdown over it we need to be saying Lord help me help me rise up Lord I want to live in Heavenly places I want to live this word I want to have purpose in my life I want to be a testimony in my family I want to be a testimony in the house of God testimony in my community oh Hallelujah look at this because whoever is born of God doth not commit sin amen that seed will not come out of you but Satan's going to try and get you to hand it over he might dig every bit of Earth as it were that's covering that seed over but he can't take it he can't kill it so some of you that keep falling back in condemnation and just don't you just don't even hardly put an effort to serving God because condemnation's been heaped upon you my brother and sister what you got to do right now is step up out of that position and say I will no longer occupy and perform Satan's purpose I will serve the purpose of my God hallelujah oh let me just jump over some things oh how to yeah you know I had a little Revival this morning Saints I just have to tell you amen this is what I wrote down the Church of the Living God is a devil defeating word believing group of people so if you ever need to figure out who you are identity crisis or whatever just remember you are a devil defeating amen a Bible believing word believing people amen and the prophet of God says how do you do that you just let the word flow through you you don't go learn Greek in Hebrew and you don't do all these other things and you don't have to you know fast yourself into skin and bones just let the word flow through you you know what that means remember when the prophet of God preached about channels you've got to let the word the Holy Ghost come through and clean that channel out I want the I want the Holy Spirit to move through me but it just don't work well maybe you need to repent a little bit watch a log break loose or pen a little bit and watch a boulder roll away repent a little bit and do you know as a farmer we deal with water all the time do you know that a whole pile of leaves can stop water just as much as a whole loader bucket full of dirt can one little complex laying next to another little complex overlapped by another complex next to a big complex next to a little comp and pretty soon the channel blocked off and then we say I sure don't feel the presence of God that's right the sprinklers don't run if there's no water coming out of the pipe yeah come on let me hurry along here Saints I don't want to be too too late influence of another brother Brown says this I'm I'm definitely I'm definitely cherry picking this out you go look and read it in the whole context okay but look at this the only thing that'll manifest the word of God is the Holy Ghost itself amen amen when he the Holy Ghost will come he will take these things of mine and show them to you you know I preached quite a few years ago well I believe it was dedication of Living Word the challenge of our day my brother and sister is not to get the sin out of the church the challenge of our day is to get the Holy Ghost in because you can fight to keep sin out of the church for the rest of your life and deem your personal Ministry your own personal life a failure but you get the Holy Ghost in and the sin will leave that's the challenge of our day my brother and sister not how big our church is or what we have or what program we did but to get the Holy Ghost inside of our church and watch it make a difference in our lives amen oh Hallelujah now just several quotes as we just wind this down here God knew this great where Warfare was going on between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy was going to do now I hope this isn't offensive to you we're now seeing a revelation of a new kind of warfare like we've never saw before we've had spy planes for years right all the way back Cold War spy planes but now you can go down to Best Buy and buy a hundred dollar drone and run it up in the air and fly it out there and see what the enemy's doing a new kind of warfare and let me tell you right now the devil like never before is scrutinizing your lives to see where he can get in to see how he can afflict something upon you we're living in the day my brother and sister the prophet of God will just break this down paraphrasing it as it were the prophet of God said you in this day right now if you don't want the devil after you you have to get under the blood okay I got another Blood you said you have to stay under the blood theirs where the key is my brother and sister because he's got the devil's got his spiritual drone as it were out here and he's looking he's looking he's looking where what's happening in these lives I can just come in all I need is one little in the armor to inject some poison all I need to do and you know what if we're not careful we're just living life but maybe we get a little sloppy about things and see there it is I don't know if any of you watched some of this warfare that's taking place over there uh you know I mean it just it terrifies me honestly in my flesh it terrifies me there literally was a deal these Ukrainian soldiers got a big plastic box and I'm like that sure looks like the Drone we have at the farm he pulls that thing out sets it over on top of a deal how's the deal Loops it around his neck it looked like it had an iPad on it and he just there and it's just like nothing flies off and only a couple minutes later zeros in oh look at that people walking in and out of this hole in the ground it's only like five minutes later never before in the history of mankind has Satan had such a microscope on the Bride of Jesus Christ every single moment every move where can I get them where can I Stumble them maybe it won't be a bomb maybe it'll just be a canister filled with all kinds of this is not true that's not true you're deceived you're in a cult they've proven that the war of the mind is pretty much as effective is the of the bomb and missile and bullet hmm sorry I keep dragging this out forgive me Saints you know just exactly how to equip his people so if we notice the very first thing that God equipped his children with being infinite he knowed what it took to defeat Satan any time any place anywhere on any condition come on let's not offer excuses any longer I I can't I can't deal with this part of my life God's given you everything you need any time any place anywhere on any condition do we believe this is the words of a prophet the words of God now he wouldn't say I'll give them something here now I want you to just forgive me because I'm going to butcher this quote he didn't say I'll give you something in 1965. and then I'm just going to let you go a few years and then maybe I'll study out something better to give them than after a few years later that's where most of these false doctrines come from Saints people are like well brother Branham had this but he never really gave us the full revelation of that my Bible says in the fullness of time all the mysteries of God would be revealed not a cookie here and a cookie there not a little bit here a little bit there now that's how Revelation comes to us but God laid all of that word out and then it's our Revelation that is what's expanding and growing not a new word of God see so I want to go back here real quick see we noticed he know just exactly how to equip his people anybody equipped here today amen we've been equipped Saints we don't have an excuse we shouldn't look for an excuse amen because we've been equipped and we've been given that ability to defeat Satan Anytime Anyplace anywhere on any condition bye let's just hurry here looking unto Jesus that's the very reason that Jesus was not understood when he come to the Earth if they would have only looked into the word of God instead of their own of their tradition of that day they would have known he was the son of God because the Bible plainly declared his full coming and he come in full revelation of the word and each generation reveals him in the full Revelation that's lauded for that time this generation come on let's not be looking backwards prophet of God told us don't be looking backwards 50 years come on now you say well you can use that out of context well I don't mean it to be out of contact but my brother and sister we should not be looking back to say I sure wished I had been in the Tabernacle band then you go study you'll go study what the prophet of God said there's times in the message that he says this Tabernacle is just as bad as any of them he didn't cut him Slack why because he wanted them to get the draws out he wanted them to get to the place that they looked through the word and not just oh we were from the Tabernacle now there are those in our midst that their family the roots go back and it's very very incredible and at some time in place when God would anointed I would love to hear about some of that but you see my brother and sister the New Birth has still got to be connected I went to this church no New Birth you're in trouble go to that church you've got a new birth God bless you that you went to that church but otherwise you see so he says here now each generation reveals him in the full Revelation that's allotted for that time this generation must Jesus Christ that's the revelation of him that's promised in the word must be revealed to this generation now all of you already read all the way down to that bottom line and I wish I could have blocked it out a little bit but my brother and sister I tell you you know a song I Love the song I love to sing the song but it's there if the churches won't receive it somebody will rise up and do it I believe my whole Hallelujah God has come in our hour he's given us purpose he's given us word he's given us unction to act upon it he's given us overcoming power from depressions and fears and doubts and everything that's there Satan's assault on the mind and on the spirit and on the body and it's there God's give us overcoming power to that and it's there if they don't want to receive it we're going to rise up we're going to rise up my brother and sister and do it oh I'll tell you I hope you misunderstand I'm not just excited for excited sakes I'm right here I'm looking at this realizing he's talking about me he's talking about me the whole story of my life my brother and sister every story if I gave every detail there would be times that you would say oh this is terrible that's terrible but I can look back and realize even down in the depths of Despair I was rising up I was rising up when I wouldn't hardly utter the name of Jesus Christ I thank the Lord I never used his name in vain but even I wouldn't utter the name of Jesus I was rising up even at that point I just didn't know it I didn't know it he was pulling me up out of the pit of despair he was bringing me up and he says you know what I'm going to put you in church Paul thank you Lord you put me in church you know Paul was happy my poor wife married to me for a lot of years Paul the chameleon I could go to church and people would be like God bless you brother Paul I fixed tractors I figured all kinds of things out in church and people think you're there getting blessed might find it shocking I did it to make her happy I didn't do it to make God happy but God said hey there's a day now Paul I'm going to raise you up a little higher I got raised up on that and I actually thought that that was it I thought praise the Lord I finally made it and I was there for seasons and God says okay now that you made it back to Ground Zero Paul would you like to go a little higher than something inside of me said I want to go a little higher and it's never stopped it's never stopped right because you see I've had some days I've got to see the absolute glory of God move power and authority and something in my soul says Paul you're only within the view of heavenly places you're just there as it were looking in the door come up a little higher up a little higher Paul you can do it you can see all the years it took you see sometimes Saints I hope you don't mind me putting it this way some of us are a little bit slower than others I don't mean that derogatory but he made me a promise that I would live in Heavenly places and it's still happening it's still moving and you already did my sis what year would it been that we came parents introduced to the message I always posted about when I was nine which would have been about 1970. something like that I'm just now breaking into Heavenly places and the whole time God has been saying come on Paul come on Paul come on Paul you couldn't do it Paul just step in my footsteps just follow me you know who the brave ones are on a hike is the one who sets the pace the Holy Ghost is come on Amen I'll never leave you I'm not going to take that other turn in the trail and forsake you I'll be right here keeping you guiding you don't worry about it I've never lost a one I read a or saw a video deal that had some reading on it about this Christian man that went Grizzly hunting in Alaska and he chose this particular guide because the man was a Christian and they're going through Bear Country thick brush this guy got incredibly nervous he said you could just smell bear and he was a man from a relatively large city and he said I'm walking through this brush and all I can think of is a big paw he said I had a vision of this big paw coming out and the guide would go hey where did you go and the guide stopped and says I sense something's not quite right here and he quotes scripture to him he says never fear I will lead you and guide you and then he smiles at this Hunter a big grin and he said I've never lost a one that's right even in that stage of life he said I realized I wasn't trusting God Saints trust him trust her Hallelujah we have purpose we're seeing the manifestation of it and if the churches won't receive it somebody will rise up and do it sister Ruth come we'll just call that good right there Hallelujah you know if you need a simple reminder Saints our purpose is living the word amen we don't have to be super Christian we don't have to have an answer for everything we just have to trust God because he said purpose is not in us the purpose is in him oh God bless you God bless
