[45:34] would say could not be done and father
[45:36] you granted that for her to have this
[45:39] ability to come and go and father we
[45:42] would ask you Lord that she would be
[45:44] able to hold the memories of this time
[45:46] and with her family her children and her
[45:50] grandchild father Lord let those be
[45:53] Precious Memories but father let her
[45:55] light that light shine so strongly
[45:58] father when she gets back amongst the
[46:00] Saints there in denque father that Lord
[46:04] it would be just a beautiful time a a
[46:07] beautiful experience father and Lord to
[46:10] know that you've called us to be
[46:12] victorious no matter where we're at or
[46:14] what our circumstance is so father we
[46:17] ask you to Grant to our sister nah
[46:19] traveling mercies today Lord and bless
[46:22] her in all things we pray in the name of
[46:25] Jesus Christ amen
[46:27] Hallelujah truly Saints you know when
[46:30] the government decided in that
[46:32] circumstance to allow our sister nah to
[46:35] uh be able to come back that was a
[46:38] miracle amen amen because our government
[46:40] just takes a stance once you forsake
[46:43] that it's finished and yet God come and
[46:46] just granted that so I think that's
[46:49] wonderful amen um brother Ben God bless

[49:16] uh just uh be praying for that
[49:20] amen amen good to be in the house of the
[49:22] Lord today amen amen God is good let's
[49:26] turn in our Bibles I want to talk to you
[49:28] once again uh kind of a continuation of
[49:31] last Sunday uh a personal message and um
[49:36] you know God deals with church ages he
[49:40] deals with churches but his real focus
[49:43] is to deal with us as individuals uh
[49:46] even the message of the hour uh is
[49:49] spoken in this day uh uh God give a real
[49:53] Focus that it was about the individual
[49:56] there will not be a church relationship
[49:58] that gets us in it will not be a message
[50:00] relationship that gets us in but it will
[50:03] be a personal relationship that um gets
[50:06] us into the Rapture into the presence of
[50:08] the Lord let's turn in Ephesians the fth
[50:11] chapter uh starting with the eth verse
[50:14] uh lay a little foundation in just
[50:16] actually the last uh two or three verses
[50:19] there for ye were sometimes Darkness but
[50:23] now are ye light in the Lord walk as
[50:26] children of light and I think all of us
[50:28] can say Amen to that verse there's been
[50:31] times that we we uh didn't walk really
[50:35] in the present Truth uh and um yet God
[50:38] has given us a wonderful opportunity to
[50:40] be children of light amen for the fruit
[50:42] of the spirit is in all goodness and
[50:45] righteousness and Truth proving what is
[50:48] acceptable unto the Lord and I want to
[50:51] just CU we're not going to preach on
[50:52] this but I want to just just uh uh make
[50:55] a little emphasis on verse vers 10 there
[50:58] God is proving in our lives what is
[51:02] acceptable unto him now when we come
[51:06] short of what is acceptable to him God
[51:09] does not say well I guess you failed the
[51:12] test and you're finished but he takes us
[51:14] back through and it's amazing my brother
[51:17] and sister because we would be
[51:19] embarrassed you might say uh sometimes
[51:22] of of things that happen in our life and
[51:25] we'd say you know I thought I was beyond
[51:27] that I thought that that would be no
[51:28] longer an issue in my life but you see
[51:31] God has a way of going back into our
[51:34] circumstance and actually allowing us to
[51:37] come short in the test amen it's
[51:41] actually in his will amen that we come
[51:43] short because in that time uh if we
[51:46] would use the word failure I don't
[51:48] really like to use that word but if we
[51:50] use that word failure it's a time of our
[51:52] failure that it exposes not to the devil
[51:56] not to everyone else in the church but
[51:58] it exposes to us yes our shortcoming
[52:02] that we need to work on that we need to
[52:05] submit to the Lord and so when God works
[52:08] through failure my brother and sister we
[52:11] know it wasn't us that overcome it was
[52:15] him Christ in US
[52:17] amen and have no fellowship with
[52:20] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[52:23] reprove them for it is a shame even to
[52:26] speak of those things which are done of
[52:28] them in secret but all things that are
[52:31] reproved are made manifest by the light
[52:34] for whatsoever doth maketh manifest is
[52:38] light wherefore he saith awake thou that
[52:42] sleepest Lord help us to be awake and
[52:45] arise from the dead and Christ shall
[52:47] give thee light see then that you walk
[52:50] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[52:55] and I thought this is interesting
[52:56] brother Trevor you just mentioned that
[52:58] right there when you were here in the
[53:00] Pulpit Redeeming the time because the
[53:04] days are evil wherefore be not unwise
[53:08] but understanding what the will of the
[53:11] Lord is Heavenly Father we ask you to
[53:14] bless the time lord the word today May
[53:17] it touch each and every heart father
[53:19] Lord we we just want we long father to
[53:22] come closer to you Lord as the song says
[53:26] J a closer walk with thee Lord that is
[53:29] our desire that is our plea father and
[53:33] we ask you to come speak to each and
[53:34] every heart Lord bless our visitors
[53:37] today Father Lord and those on the
[53:39] internet Lord would just uh pray father
[53:42] that that Lord you know every
[53:44] circumstance and you know every need
[53:46] that we have to hear the word not to
[53:49] hear a man but to hear your word father
[53:53] so let your word come forth pure
[53:55] righteous and holy for its full benefit
[53:57] to the body of Believers in the name of
[53:59] Jesus Christ amen you may be
[54:02] seated amen you know as we look at this
[54:07] I I've said this quite a few times
[54:09] through the years that um I'm not so
[54:13] sure that the present day Church could
[54:16] handle Paul he he was so direct he he
[54:20] was so blunt that certainly in the
[54:22] spirit of the age now we're we're you
[54:25] know we we so much don't want to desire
[54:28] anyone that uh you know the prophet of
[54:31] God said it would come a time that that
[54:34] they would I'm paraphrasing it that they
[54:36] would have the word so watered down that
[54:38] it would be of none effect and uh I
[54:41] think I think we've reached that time I
[54:43] think we've come into this season where
[54:45] where uh the world is is speaking the
[54:48] gospel they quote the scripture they
[54:50] quote The Messengers of days gone by and
[54:54] yet it is so watered down that that it
[54:56] is um of none effect but Paul is
[54:59] speaking here to the Ephesians and he's
[55:01] speaking pretty
[55:02] straightforward and you know when when
[55:05] God speaks to his bride through his
[55:07] Messengers uh it's the same as being lip
[55:10] to ear of God speaking to you and I amen
[55:15] if if it's the word we're not talking
[55:17] about personality of man we're not
[55:19] talking about man's ideas but when it is
[55:22] the word of God coming forth that is the
[55:24] same as God being right beside you and
[55:27] his lips by your ears speaking to you
[55:30] the word for the hour amen that's why my
[55:34] brother and sister the Prophet come and
[55:36] and he approached things in such a
[55:38] fashion that he while speaking boldly
[55:42] never made emphasis that it was about
[55:44] him he made emphasis that this is the
[55:47] word from God for you for this day and
[55:51] so when God speaks through to his bride
[55:54] through his Messengers as I said it's a
[55:56] same as lip to ear and I believe it's
[55:58] the same in this day my brother and
[56:00] sister you take the message of the hour
[56:03] you take what God has given us and when
[56:05] we will ponder this study it read it
[56:08] pray about it you'll find that it's
[56:10] actually God right here beside you
[56:13] whispering in your ear amen it is not a
[56:16] man's idea not a man's message because
[56:18] we can look at history and we can see
[56:21] that if it was a man message it would
[56:23] have denominated by now it would have
[56:26] failed by now and become just a book of
[56:29] ideas and doctrines and rules but this
[56:31] my brother and sister I I don't know I
[56:33] can only speak from my experience but
[56:35] this is so relevant that you can
[56:37] literally come and find yourself in a
[56:40] situation and reach out to the Lord and
[56:43] realize the an is right there in your
[56:45] hand and it was this season that God
[56:48] said it's time for you to see a little
[56:50] bit more it's time for you to grow a
[56:52] little bit more amen uh and so in that
[56:56] we we'll see how God is working he is
[56:58] opening his word and we talk about the
[57:01] road to emus my brother and sister and
[57:03] how that they were walking they were
[57:05] discouraged anybody ever get discouraged
[57:07] amen and they were walking discouraged
[57:10] and the word came to them and as they
[57:13] were there the word was being placed in
[57:15] their hearts amen they were listening to
[57:18] the things that were spoke now when we
[57:20] read those verses did Jesus said now you
[57:22] poor mistreated little
[57:24] guys no
[57:27] you fools and slow of
[57:29] heart could we believe my brother and
[57:32] sister that God would speak to that call
[57:34] us fools and and slow of heart to
[57:37] believe the word but yet when it come
[57:40] down to the time that they broke bread
[57:43] amen their eyes were open the Revelation
[57:45] that the word was in their midst come
[57:47] alive we are here this morning and the
[57:50] bread has been broken amen we're here
[57:53] and it's been open to us to become real
[57:56] not something we talk about what
[57:58] happened in the past but a real word
[58:00] present tense with us today amen and so
[58:03] as you look at this uh uh God is
[58:06] speaking now amen and the word has
[58:08] spoken and so we can therefore declare
[58:11] God has spoken amen now sometimes we get
[58:15] the ideas you know people get this where
[58:18] they get discouraged life is tough and
[58:20] and they feel like the word being
[58:22] preached is always just uh uh you know
[58:24] straighten up straighten up correct this
[58:26] you're doing this wrong but my brother
[58:28] and sister the word is not all
[58:30] correction it it it is not all just a
[58:33] line up tow the mark amen but I just
[58:36] want to ask you you know you don't have
[58:37] to lift a hand if you don't but who
[58:39] needs correction amen I know that I need
[58:42] correction there's times that I'm
[58:44] walking as a blindfolded man and you
[58:47] know you think oh I wouldn't run off the
[58:49] road I I wouldn't get detoured and
[58:52] distracted but then we do and we don't
[58:55] even realize and that shows just how
[58:57] deceptive the spirit of the age is is
[59:00] when we can start to get lukewarm and
[59:02] cold and not even realize it but God
[59:06] says I love you too much to let you get
[59:08] lukewarm I let love you too much to let
[59:10] you get cold I love you too much to let
[59:12] you drift off the road of life it's
[59:15] straight and it's narrow and I'm going
[59:17] to keep you centered on that road and
[59:19] yet if we're not careful we'll go man
[59:21] the preaching of the word is is so hard
[59:24] so hard on me let's make it more
[59:26] personal amen so hard on me but do you
[59:29] realize that God has come because he
[59:32] knows just exactly what the pull of the
[59:36] world is now when we're talking amongst
[59:39] Believers we talk about the pull of the
[59:40] world we're not talking about cigarettes
[59:42] and alcohol and dance halls my brother
[59:45] and sister we're talking about the
[59:47] lukewarm Spirit of
[59:49] leoda we've got truth can we say Amen to
[59:52] that and we believe that all is well
[59:54] because we possess the truth TR but
[59:57] sometimes my brother and sister the
[59:58] truth is
[1:00:00] stale amen still truth but stale because
[1:00:06] we're looking back to another day that's
[1:00:09] right that's right you follow me that's
[1:00:11] right amen so it's not all correction
[1:00:15] but we need it amen it's not all just
[1:00:17] about promises the the song service
[1:00:19] there you know singing about some
[1:00:20] promises it's just not just about
[1:00:23] promises my brother and sister but we
[1:00:25] need to see the promises amen so it's
[1:00:27] not a carrot on a stick often times
[1:00:30] that's what promises are are viewed at
[1:00:33] as a something to uh cause you to take
[1:00:35] another step because you're trying to
[1:00:37] attain to it you're trying to get the no
[1:00:40] it it's not but we do need those
[1:00:42] promises because those promises are
[1:00:45] God's promises amen amen that is not a
[1:00:47] church promise it's not a man promise
[1:00:49] amen it's not a denomination promise
[1:00:52] it's a god promise amen and so we need
[1:00:55] to see the promise we need to be able to
[1:00:57] see tangibly that's what happened to
[1:01:00] Israel in the wilderness they got out
[1:01:02] there and somehow or another and the
[1:01:04] preoccupation of traveling in a dry
[1:01:07] Dusty land remembering that working in
[1:01:09] the the Brick Factory in Egypt wasn't
[1:01:12] all that
[1:01:16] bad you talk about a deceptive spirit in
[1:01:18] the day we live in when people are
[1:01:20] delivered from drugs and alcohol and all
[1:01:23] of the things that pertain to the world
[1:01:26] and 25 30 40 years later tempted to go
[1:01:32] back my brother and sister Satan has
[1:01:35] come and he's
[1:01:39] beautified I want you to think about
[1:01:41] that he's
[1:01:42] beautified the
[1:01:45] circumstance what we once I just reading
[1:01:48] this morning the prophet said you know
[1:01:49] where we once cried out all night we
[1:01:52] once cried out to God for deliverance
[1:01:55] now we just accept
[1:01:57] it my brother and sister that's not what
[1:02:00] we were called to do but we need to see
[1:02:02] the Promise and who likes blessings amen
[1:02:05] amen I love blessings amen but it's not
[1:02:08] just about being blessed my brother and
[1:02:10] sister it's not just about oh God's
[1:02:13] pouring out blessing the church we have
[1:02:15] more Cadillacs and Mercedes and this
[1:02:17] that and the other in the parking lot
[1:02:18] than any other church we have a finder
[1:02:21] my brother and sister none of that means
[1:02:23] one thing to your soul that's right
[1:02:26] you can drive an old beat up you know it
[1:02:28] used to be when I was a kid uh there was
[1:02:31] certain imported cars and I won't say
[1:02:33] where they were from but uh uh for the
[1:02:37] sake of some Believers here but anyway
[1:02:40] uh but but you know that was a joke if
[1:02:42] you were talking about a car that would
[1:02:44] be driving down the road and the fender
[1:02:45] would just fall off that's what you
[1:02:47] called it and so you know that was the
[1:02:51] insult of all insults when it come to
[1:02:53] cars and you look at that you know and
[1:02:56] and uh we're like praise God we've never
[1:02:59] had to drive something like that and
[1:03:02] praise God we've been blessed beyond
[1:03:04] measure praise God my brother and sister
[1:03:07] I'll tell you what the prophet of God
[1:03:09] told us we'd be better off eating soda
[1:03:11] crackers and drinking Branch water and
[1:03:13] be in the will of God than to be blessed
[1:03:16] in the tangible worldly things and be
[1:03:18] without Christ amen our souls in a
[1:03:21] spiritual
[1:03:23] drought now drought means different
[1:03:26] things to different people my brother
[1:03:27] and sister but when a drought comes
[1:03:29] nothing's
[1:03:30] blessed amen so it's there you know this
[1:03:36] will be something maybe that um you
[1:03:38] would um kind of question me making a
[1:03:41] statement sometimes we need to stir our
[1:03:46] intellectuals
[1:03:48] amen now if that sounds odd ball I have
[1:03:50] the quote to back it up amen prophet of
[1:03:54] God talking about stirring the
[1:03:55] intellectuals what he's doing God's
[1:03:57] coming in stirring our minds it's
[1:03:59] scriptural in more than one way because
[1:04:01] he said to stir up your pure Minds in
[1:04:04] remembrance amen stirring up your
[1:04:06] intellectuals but yet this message is
[1:04:09] not an intellectual message amen it is
[1:04:11] to some they grasp it that that we can
[1:04:14] take a a chart or a board and put
[1:04:16] everything in exactly the right place
[1:04:19] but if that doesn't live you don't have
[1:04:22] much right you've got a diagram you've
[1:04:25] you've got a a um oh what's the word uh
[1:04:29] anyway you understand a chart you've got
[1:04:32] it all laid out this is going to be this
[1:04:34] is this goes that that's good my brother
[1:04:36] and sister but there's got to be life
[1:04:38] those lines connecting all that got to
[1:04:40] be life amen it's got to be something
[1:04:42] that touches your heart and brings you
[1:04:44] back in line and you know what we
[1:04:47] sometimes you know I'm thinking the
[1:04:48] church we need to get a few visiting
[1:04:50] ministers that will come in here and and
[1:04:52] shake the church hard enough to pull the
[1:04:54] SC screws out the floor on the pews Amen
[1:04:57] to shake it because sometimes we need a
[1:05:00] shaking sometimes we get complacent we
[1:05:02] can say Amen well the prophet said a
[1:05:05] Believer would say Amen to every word of
[1:05:07] God but I want to know is there
[1:05:09] something deep down inside that amen
[1:05:11] that is almost demanding I want more of
[1:05:15] that or do we simply acknowledge that we
[1:05:19] agree by saying
[1:05:22] amen have we come to the place that
[1:05:25] desperation is a word that's not spoken
[1:05:28] in our church it's not spoken in our
[1:05:33] lives we're message
[1:05:36] Believers we've got
[1:05:38] truth We're The
[1:05:41] Chosen well my brother and
[1:05:44] sister we're The Chosen and the proof is
[1:05:48] in the pudding that's
[1:05:50] right that's right
[1:05:53] because I don't care if you have all the
[1:05:55] right
[1:05:56] ingredients doesn't mean your pudding is
[1:05:59] going to turn out
[1:06:01] right amen now I I I I've been breaking
[1:06:06] this pretty good but you know Sister
[1:06:08] Jerry you'll cook something a dessert a
[1:06:11] meal and it will be just so
[1:06:15] scrumptious and I would say hey I would
[1:06:19] like that again this next
[1:06:21] week I can tell I've got to know her
[1:06:24] really well she gets kind of this
[1:06:26] awkward
[1:06:27] little and she said I don't know I just
[1:06:30] dropped a dab of this and a shake of
[1:06:32] that and I thought what would this be
[1:06:35] like if I added basil what's
[1:06:40] basil well it's what made that taste
[1:06:43] good but a little too much or not
[1:06:46] enough never be
[1:06:51] recreated what was a book of Acts the
[1:06:54] day of Pentecost what was it doing my
[1:06:56] brother and
[1:06:57] sister it was planting the seed of a
[1:07:01] word and a life that can be replicated
[1:07:04] again and again and again and again
[1:07:09] Through the Ages amen everything that
[1:07:12] they have we have now our need is to get
[1:07:17] it in the right proportion we can stack
[1:07:19] the message up I've been collecting
[1:07:21] message books from people that either
[1:07:23] quit or thought because we live in in a
[1:07:25] digital age they didn't need their books
[1:07:27] anymore I I collect them up you want to
[1:07:29] give any of your books away just call me
[1:07:32] amen I don't care if I have 25 of the
[1:07:35] same message book I'll take yours amen
[1:07:39] because that's how important this is to
[1:07:41] me and yesterday I was putting away I
[1:07:43] was putting away a a bunch of message
[1:07:46] books that I had once again collected up
[1:07:49] and I was putting them away in my
[1:07:50] bookcase and you know my brother and
[1:07:53] sister as I was putting that away I got
[1:07:55] complet complely distracted because I
[1:07:57] was pulling it out waiting to put this
[1:07:58] certain book in a certain place and I
[1:08:00] thought oh I haven't read that message
[1:08:02] for a while you know after a bit I'm
[1:08:04] like wait just a second I'm supposed to
[1:08:06] be cleaning up this room not not you
[1:08:08] know sitting down but I'm telling you if
[1:08:11] the desire to be in the word is not
[1:08:14] greater than our desire even for a clean
[1:08:17] office amen if it's not greater than for
[1:08:20] a a benefit of this or a benefit of that
[1:08:23] if our desire for that word is not great
[1:08:25] than anything around us then we have a
[1:08:28] clutter much worse than something
[1:08:31] stacked on top of a desk amen we got a
[1:08:33] clutter in the soul amen and I tell you
[1:08:37] sometimes God just needs to shake us I I
[1:08:39] don't know maybe I'll just step out our
[1:08:40] limb how many of you would like to have
[1:08:42] some Ministry come to this church that
[1:08:44] would shake it amen that would come and
[1:08:47] and just just remind us that the devil
[1:08:50] is a Sly old Fox amen would remind us
[1:08:53] that we have to be diligent day in and
[1:08:55] day out now remind us that we're living
[1:08:57] in a time that Satan produces everything
[1:09:00] he can produce that will distract you
[1:09:03] he's got books he's got movies he's got
[1:09:05] this he's got that just go down the list
[1:09:07] and name it and it's all there as a
[1:09:10] distraction right it might not turn you
[1:09:13] from serving God but it will turn you
[1:09:15] from serving God like we should that's
[1:09:17] right amen a distraction amen I tell you
[1:09:22] but wow we need the word to be uh uh to
[1:09:25] Shake us yeah we also need a tender
[1:09:28] Embrace amen amen how how many of you
[1:09:31] love that when the Lord comes midnight
[1:09:33] hour early morning when the sun's Rising
[1:09:35] whatever that is and you just feel that
[1:09:38] tender Embrace of our Lord Jesus
[1:09:40] speaking to your heart and sometimes in
[1:09:42] that tender Embrace there's
[1:09:44] correction sometimes in that tender
[1:09:46] embrace my brother and sister there's
[1:09:49] Revelation but we need that tender
[1:09:51] Embrace God is not a God that's just a
[1:09:53] god of judgment God loves us amen and
[1:09:56] he's proved how much he loves us by what
[1:09:58] he has done for us amen and so that
[1:10:02] tender Embrace in Isaiah 40 amen we'll
[1:10:06] look right here Isaiah 40 the voice said
[1:10:09] cry and he said what shall I cry all
[1:10:12] flesh is grass all the goodliness
[1:10:15] thereof is as a flower of the field the
[1:10:18] grass withereth and the flower fadeth
[1:10:20] because the spirit of the Lord bloweth
[1:10:22] upon it surely the people is grass the
[1:10:26] grass wherewith the flower fadeth but
[1:10:29] the word of our God shall stand forever
[1:10:34] oh Zion what bringeth good tidings get
[1:10:36] thee up into the high mountain oh
[1:10:38] Jerusalem what bringeth good tidings
[1:10:41] lift up thy voice with strength amen
[1:10:44] amen you want good tidings lift up your
[1:10:47] voice with strength we're not here to
[1:10:49] whimper and to cry and be Beggars we're
[1:10:52] here to stand on the promised word that
[1:10:54] God has given us my brother and sister
[1:10:56] and from the day that Esther walked into
[1:11:00] the the palace and walked up and heard
[1:11:02] those words amen that even to the
[1:11:07] half do you realize from that day on
[1:11:10] Esther who had the right nature the
[1:11:12] right Spirit the right character amen
[1:11:15] she didn't become suddenly a bossy woman
[1:11:18] but she knew then she had authority to
[1:11:21] speak and it was her husband backing her
[1:11:24] up amen come on are we the bride of
[1:11:28] Jesus Christ or not amen are we just a
[1:11:30] bunch of churchgoers that heard a
[1:11:32] message and agreed with it no we're the
[1:11:35] Esther of our age we're the Esther the
[1:11:38] Bride of this day that has heard the
[1:11:40] word that says to the half of my kingdom
[1:11:43] and then we know we can come not as
[1:11:46] bossy women but come as the Bride of
[1:11:49] Jesus Christ with the authority of the
[1:11:51] bridegroom behind us oh how beautiful
[1:11:55] amen oh Zion bring us thou Good Tidings
[1:11:59] get thee up to the high mountain oh
[1:12:01] Jerusalem that bringeth good tidings
[1:12:03] lift up thy voice with strength lift it
[1:12:06] up Be not Afraid say unto the cities of
[1:12:09] Judah Behold our God behold the Lord God
[1:12:14] will come with strong hand his arm shall
[1:12:17] rule for him behold his rewards is with
[1:12:21] him and his work before him he shall
[1:12:25] feed his flock like a shepherd He Shall
[1:12:29] Gather the Lambs with his arm and carry
[1:12:32] them in his bosom and shall gently lead
[1:12:35] those that are with young oh my brother
[1:12:38] and sister I say today we need to break
[1:12:41] the apathy of leoda and long and desire
[1:12:45] and cry out to be in the bosom of our
[1:12:47] Lord Jesus Christ no longer we're
[1:12:49] checking off that that we're in church
[1:12:52] we we went to church oh you know we had
[1:12:54] more important things well my brother
[1:12:56] and sister that's fine I'm not faulting
[1:12:58] for that I'm coming in a harvest season
[1:13:01] here I pray God opens a door that I can
[1:13:03] be in every service whether I'm
[1:13:06] ministering or not but sometimes the
[1:13:08] things of life might hinder you from
[1:13:10] being in church but that doesn't stop
[1:13:12] you from being in the presence of God
[1:13:15] wrapped in his bosom amen with his
[1:13:19] strong arms around you pulling you in
[1:13:22] his
[1:13:23] presence amen that's what we long if we
[1:13:26] can sit in church we can be here and not
[1:13:29] be in his Embrace that's right we canot
[1:13:32] be in his will and be in the house of
[1:13:34] God what we want to do is be in his
[1:13:38] bosom and in his will in his presence
[1:13:42] living his life through US amen
[1:13:47] hallelujah we must be balanced
[1:13:51] people when I think of balance anymore
[1:13:53] here a couple years ago or however long
[1:13:56] it was I was in the farm shop there and
[1:13:59] I was talking to the help they were all
[1:14:02] circled around and they all thought I
[1:14:04] was playing games but suddenly the world
[1:14:07] started spinning and it spun faster and
[1:14:09] faster until I fell face forward on the
[1:14:14] concrete that
[1:14:17] hurt but I'm laying there on the ground
[1:14:21] now I can't so to speak fall any further
[1:14:23] down and my head didn't stop spinning I
[1:14:26] tried to lift my head I thought I was
[1:14:29] looking straight ahead and they said I
[1:14:30] was sitting there with my head turned
[1:14:32] this way CU that's what I
[1:14:38] fought balance is very
[1:14:41] important we're not going to go into a
[1:14:43] lecture about the inner ear and all
[1:14:45] those little balls that are rattling
[1:14:47] around inside there uh we're not going
[1:14:49] to go into the whole thing how the inner
[1:14:51] ear and outer ear and how they're all
[1:14:53] connected I've heard the doctor say that
[1:14:55] again and again yada yada
[1:14:58] yada but you see there's something
[1:15:01] that's got to be connected from the
[1:15:03] inner right to the
[1:15:06] outer for us to have
[1:15:09] balance if there's no connection there
[1:15:12] we'll think we're walking correctly
[1:15:14] we'll think we're looking okay but
[1:15:18] completely out of
[1:15:20] balance amen Christ on the inside my
[1:15:24] brother and sister must connect with the
[1:15:25] man as it were on the outside that's
[1:15:27] figurative figure of speech we're not
[1:15:29] trying to derive a perfect spiritual
[1:15:33] scenario there but what's on the inside
[1:15:35] must be connected there must be
[1:15:38] something that reflects back to you and
[1:15:40] I in other words my brother and sister
[1:15:42] the prophet of God talks about a man
[1:15:44] having a temper and the man being a
[1:15:46] faithful member of the church I believe
[1:15:48] a deacon or something like that and and
[1:15:50] you know but there was not there was
[1:15:51] something not quite connected there and
[1:15:53] and the man had a temp
[1:15:56] and claimed to have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:57] something on the inside was not
[1:15:58] connected to something on the outside I
[1:16:01] say God help us to have that connection
[1:16:03] like we need to have so that we can come
[1:16:06] and and he's promised to feed his flock
[1:16:09] Like a Shepherd amen you think our
[1:16:11] Lord's a sloppy Shepherd no no my
[1:16:14] brother and sister he's the finest
[1:16:15] Shepherd That Ever Walked amen caring
[1:16:18] more amen knowing exactly what we need
[1:16:21] what pasture we need to eat from and
[1:16:23] when we should go to the water amen all
[1:16:26] of these things and he'll feed his flock
[1:16:28] Like a Shepherd and he'll gather his
[1:16:30] Lambs now I don't know you know uh you
[1:16:34] might think I'm too old to call myself a
[1:16:36] lamb but when it comes to serving God
[1:16:38] I'm just a tender little lamb amen and
[1:16:40] it's there you know I I just really I
[1:16:43] just really Saints want us to catch a
[1:16:45] revelation of what it is to be drawn
[1:16:48] into his Embrace in the time of trouble
[1:16:52] amen when the fiery darts are flying
[1:16:54] when the is in your face when the enemy
[1:16:56] is trying to convince you you're not
[1:16:58] even a believer because of something
[1:17:00] you've said or
[1:17:04] done well you know guys I'm pretty
[1:17:06] personal do you know what I'm talking
[1:17:09] about yes sir Amen in those times we
[1:17:12] need to know God still got his arms
[1:17:15] wrapped around me dealing with an
[1:17:17] individual just here somewhat recent
[1:17:19] saying you know what brother Paul I've
[1:17:21] just done too much for God to to love me
[1:17:25] to carry on and I said
[1:17:29] really really more than
[1:17:32] balum no I'm not a
[1:17:35] balum more than Judas no I'm not a Judas
[1:17:40] then what are you talking
[1:17:42] about that's Satan talking to you you've
[1:17:46] done too much you can't H you're not
[1:17:48] over going to overcome this ever no my
[1:17:50] brother and sister the word is here amen
[1:17:54] Christ has got us wrapped in his Embrace
[1:17:57] Satan wants us to ask the Lord to drop
[1:18:02] us let me tell you right now he's never
[1:18:07] dropped a
[1:18:09] lamb Hallelujah I hope you don't mind a
[1:18:11] little humor but when we first had our
[1:18:13] first child sister jool and they're not
[1:18:15] here today not feeling well forgot to
[1:18:18] put them in the prayer
[1:18:20] requests I carried jool Lynn around on a
[1:18:24] pretty good size had my favorite pillow
[1:18:26] for carrying my daughter around I place
[1:18:29] her plunk in this pillow and then I pick
[1:18:32] the whole thing up oh that people would
[1:18:34] be like oh that's so nice you know make
[1:18:37] her comfortable no I was afraid of
[1:18:38] dropping
[1:18:40] her amen I would walk around like H what
[1:18:45] would I ever tell Jerry in the world you
[1:18:47] know show up at church and my little
[1:18:49] baby girl's got a black eye a no problem
[1:18:51] I just dropped
[1:18:52] her it happens
[1:18:55] but God's never dropped a
[1:18:57] one amen he's not going to show you
[1:19:00] display you as the bride of Christ with
[1:19:01] a big black eye and a laceration on your
[1:19:04] head oh sorry I dropped you my brother
[1:19:07] and sister never dropped a single lamb
[1:19:09] he holds them in his brace and that is
[1:19:12] their Fortress is in his Embrace amen
[1:19:16] amen now I tell you what that don't get
[1:19:18] any more
[1:19:20] personal right that's why we as message
[1:19:23] Believers don't believe in all this this
[1:19:24] cuddly stuff like the world does you you
[1:19:27] go to churches you go to places and
[1:19:29] visit and and you know everybody's going
[1:19:32] around and hugging everybody and and you
[1:19:34] don't know who husband whose wife who's
[1:19:37] what who's that cuz it's all just this
[1:19:39] big hucky thing but my brother and
[1:19:41] sister God didn't want our Embrace to be
[1:19:44] carnal he wants our Embrace to be
[1:19:48] spiritual amen and that ties right down
[1:19:51] to husband and wife amen that those
[1:19:53] relationships are very very important to
[1:19:56] God they're they're not just casual God
[1:19:58] doesn't want casual marriage in the
[1:20:00] church he doesn't want casual
[1:20:02] relationship in the church he wants it
[1:20:04] to be intense he wants it to be powerful
[1:20:07] he wants it to be focused amen come on
[1:20:10] are you with me amen God wants that my
[1:20:14] brother and sister not a casual thing
[1:20:16] but you see we got to be
[1:20:21] balanced CU if we're not balanced
[1:20:25] we can't even trust
[1:20:28] God
[1:20:29] H do you realize your trust in the Lord
[1:20:32] Jesus Christ is directly connected to
[1:20:36] your spiritual
[1:20:43] balance that's why the song I want more
[1:20:46] of
[1:20:46] Jesus really should have a deeper
[1:20:49] meaning than I think we mostly give it
[1:20:51] that's right because the more we have of
[1:20:54] him
[1:20:55] the better our balance
[1:20:58] is have you ever found yourself
[1:21:02] judgmental can I go ahead and just lift
[1:21:04] my hand for all of
[1:21:09] us you know why we're
[1:21:13] judgmental because we ourselves don't
[1:21:16] have balance of the
[1:21:19] situation you see somebody
[1:21:22] fail no they failed
[1:21:25] but because you have failed and found
[1:21:27] restoration should give you more balance
[1:21:31] for those who have fallen that's right
[1:21:34] amen not less
[1:21:38] right you've heard the old phrase they
[1:21:41] threw the book at them yeah I want to
[1:21:44] ask you this morning what would
[1:21:46] happen if we had this book thrown at
[1:21:53] us give guilty is the only thing I can
[1:21:58] say but who has been
[1:22:01] given much grace amen may we give much
[1:22:07] grace hallelujah
[1:22:10] amen now let's go on Amen Satan's Eden
[1:22:15] now I like this brother brandom is
[1:22:18] actually coming he's dealing with us in
[1:22:20] such a
[1:22:21] fashion uh here and and if you go and I
[1:22:25] you know I always encourage you go back
[1:22:26] look at these things in the full
[1:22:29] context but we find you know the prophet
[1:22:33] of God is saying you know what I I
[1:22:35] wanted to speak to you something to
[1:22:36] bring something to Enlighten
[1:22:41] you to Enlighten to you the promise of
[1:22:44] God for this age
[1:22:46] amen see we got to be careful that we
[1:22:49] just don't gloss over the promises yeah
[1:22:51] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:22:54] the prophet wanted the people I I I hope
[1:22:58] you don't mind me putting it this way he
[1:23:00] wanted the people to catch a
[1:23:03] revelation of the promise to them amen
[1:23:06] not that just God made a promise right
[1:23:09] amen I was just reading the prophet of
[1:23:12] God put it this way he said you need to
[1:23:16] have uh deeper
[1:23:19] understanding than just I'm Healed
[1:23:26] how many of us have been prayed for or
[1:23:29] been sick and said I'm
[1:23:30] Healed but you see you have to have a
[1:23:34] deeper understanding that when you said
[1:23:37] by his stripes I'm Healed that you
[1:23:41] literally stepped into that promise and
[1:23:45] said amen it's finished now that's right
[1:23:49] I'm healed amen but you know what
[1:23:52] happens now I'm going to speak from
[1:23:53] Paul's okay is that okay I think I'm as
[1:23:57] normal as you guys
[1:23:59] are and um you know what we do we we
[1:24:03] come to church and we say praise God I'm
[1:24:07] Healed we're out in the foyer somebody
[1:24:09] says how you guys
[1:24:11] doing well my head hurts my shoulder
[1:24:14] hurts my back hurts my my wallet hurts
[1:24:19] my now I don't say that drug Tory I've
[1:24:21] done it just as many times as you have
[1:24:24] but the prophet's trying to get us to
[1:24:27] understand that when we claim our
[1:24:29] healing it has to be a revelation that
[1:24:33] you would be able to say oh do I have
[1:24:37] some pain in my body yes but praise God
[1:24:41] I was healed amen
[1:24:44] amen now I know that's hard but I can
[1:24:47] tell you for the last week and a half
[1:24:50] I've had tremendous pain in my body and
[1:24:53] I've been testing Ed with this very
[1:24:58] test hang on to your
[1:25:00] Pew I
[1:25:04] failed because I blamed every single
[1:25:07] thing that malfunctioned in the last
[1:25:09] couple weeks on this
[1:25:13] hip instead of telling this hip to shut
[1:25:17] up amen amen I sympathized with it now
[1:25:21] you guys know what I'm talking about
[1:25:23] right it's a human thing but you see I I
[1:25:27] think and I don't want to go too far on
[1:25:29] this because I want to preach about it
[1:25:30] later but I think we need a change in
[1:25:34] our thinking yeah we need to come to a
[1:25:37] place we do not need more Revelation
[1:25:39] from the word we need more Revelation in
[1:25:42] US amen we need to be able to say you
[1:25:45] know what I've heard the word I know the
[1:25:47] word is true am I lining up with this
[1:25:50] word and I think unfortunately this
[1:25:52] might sound harsh unfortunately most of
[1:25:55] the time we would have to say no I'm
[1:25:58] not okay I'm not judging you I'm sitting
[1:26:01] out on the Pew with you but you see what
[1:26:04] we need is a change in our
[1:26:09] thinking see I wanted to speak to you
[1:26:12] something to bring something to
[1:26:14] Enlighten to you the promise of God for
[1:26:16] this age see something not something
[1:26:18] that somebody else was in some other day
[1:26:22] mean Times Gone by but something and
[1:26:24] when them things are all right we all
[1:26:27] refer to those things but I thought I
[1:26:30] would try to bring something to your
[1:26:32] mind with these scriptures I got written
[1:26:35] here that would Enlighten you to know to
[1:26:37] make you a better soldier in the field
[1:26:40] that you're fighting in now to learn the
[1:26:43] tactics of the enemy so that you can
[1:26:45] block everything before it gets to you
[1:26:48] see the main thing is to learn to keep
[1:26:52] the punches off of you you as much as
[1:26:55] you can you see so we cannot go back and
[1:26:59] say I I I I'm I'm speaking from some
[1:27:02] personal
[1:27:03] experiences and you know an individual
[1:27:06] I'll just put it that way saying I sure
[1:27:08] wished I could go back to Paul's
[1:27:10] day I'm quite comfortable in leysia I'll
[1:27:13] be honest with you I'm quite comfortable
[1:27:16] here in Le oysa because you see the
[1:27:19] faith that it would have taken to be
[1:27:21] Overcomers in Paul's day is the same
[1:27:25] faith that you need to be an overcomer
[1:27:27] in this day if you can't overcome leysia
[1:27:31] you would not have overcome Paul's day
[1:27:34] if you had been in Ephesus you would not
[1:27:36] have overcome if you can't overcome here
[1:27:39] so why do you want to go back in time
[1:27:42] Amen to go to another day to look in
[1:27:45] that day thinking it would be an easier
[1:27:47] time it would have not been one drop
[1:27:49] easier than it is now amen and we are
[1:27:52] living in an age with the greatest
[1:27:54] Revelation that has been given the
[1:27:56] opening of the word amen the Seals
[1:27:59] Everything has been laid out before us
[1:28:01] and we are living in this day and there
[1:28:03] is Faith to overcome that in this day
[1:28:07] amen we do not need to go back to find
[1:28:10] something we can overcome amen we are
[1:28:14] Overcomers amen so what the prophet is
[1:28:17] saying here that would Enlighten you to
[1:28:19] know make you a better soldier in the
[1:28:22] field you're fighting in now now amen
[1:28:25] not in a field of another age not in a
[1:28:27] field of some time that people think
[1:28:30] there's some that think there's a whole
[1:28:32] another age to come well the eighth day
[1:28:34] my brother and sister is the bride's day
[1:28:36] amen and we will be uh fit and ready for
[1:28:41] that day why because the prophet of God
[1:28:44] already brought it out that we've
[1:28:46] stepped out of leod deia Amen we have
[1:28:49] stepped into the age of the Bride the
[1:28:52] word coming creating an over CER see
[1:28:55] that's where we're at today it's not I
[1:28:57] hope someday I will be I fell to that
[1:29:00] fallacy in my teenage years I told
[1:29:03] myself for years oh when this happens I
[1:29:07] I I'll I'll do better at serving God it
[1:29:10] happened I
[1:29:12] didn't and I was disappointed so I moved
[1:29:15] on to something else I come along to a
[1:29:17] stage of my life I thought if I get
[1:29:19] married amen that'll be the answer to
[1:29:21] all Paul's questions I'm marrying a
[1:29:23] Godly girl I mean I married a girl that
[1:29:25] was a perfect example as a daughter of
[1:29:27] God Amen except for when I made her mad
[1:29:30] but anyway
[1:29:33] uh well then it just showed she was
[1:29:36] human right but you see I got to that
[1:29:40] point married to a wonderful girl a girl
[1:29:43] that said you know Paul if you're not
[1:29:44] going to serve God I'm going to serve
[1:29:46] him anyway she's willing to stand up to
[1:29:49] the test of the household the test of
[1:29:50] the day in the household and she said I
[1:29:53] don't care I'm going to serve go God and
[1:29:54] my brother and sister I thought when I
[1:29:55] get to that place that will make the
[1:29:57] difference it
[1:29:58] didn't and that kept going right on and
[1:30:01] on and on and on until one day God by
[1:30:03] his grace and mercy come along and said
[1:30:05] you know what I've got something that's
[1:30:07] going to make you come to the place that
[1:30:09] you will be enlightened to the promise
[1:30:12] of God for you in this age amen that's a
[1:30:16] very personal message my brother and
[1:30:18] sister that's not a message just to say
[1:30:20] let's go back to what Paul preached Paul
[1:30:22] never talked to me directly but I can
[1:30:25] tell you in this day right here God has
[1:30:26] spoke to me directly amen the word has
[1:30:29] been opened directly in this day amen
[1:30:32] dealing with each and every one of us
[1:30:33] amen now look your battle is
[1:30:36] personal right amen when the devil tells
[1:30:40] you nobody's ever experienced this
[1:30:42] before he's actually telling you the
[1:30:44] truth because I could never be you and
[1:30:46] you could never be me but I tell you
[1:30:48] what we have we have a word that never
[1:30:50] changed from age to age to age amen from
[1:30:53] Individual to individual from church to
[1:30:55] church that word never changed amen and
[1:30:57] so your battle is a very personal battle
[1:31:00] and sometimes you know it's kind of
[1:31:02] stunning uh we're in South Africa sister
[1:31:05] Jerry there because we're dealing with
[1:31:06] some young ladies uh sister Jerry right
[1:31:09] there and and I just remember I was
[1:31:11] stunned I I was stunned I looked up at
[1:31:14] Jerry and Jerry's just kind of like
[1:31:16] wow because you shouldn't have 12 and
[1:31:19] 13y old children in those situations in
[1:31:22] those conditions under those those kind
[1:31:24] of influences and so the battle is
[1:31:26] really personal you know what I can
[1:31:28] think of one little young lady that we
[1:31:30] stood outside of the chapel there and
[1:31:32] she shared her story and and we're just
[1:31:35] I I was stunned and I thought you know I
[1:31:38] I found myself as a man starting to
[1:31:40] speak to say you know I understand and I
[1:31:44] bit those words off cuz one I've never
[1:31:47] been a
[1:31:49] girl and I've never been
[1:31:51] 13 with that kind of circumstance
[1:32:01] is our God awesome or
[1:32:04] not very personal God come right
[1:32:08] down open your mouth your mind's
[1:32:10] thinking a thought you open your mouth
[1:32:12] and different words come out you know
[1:32:15] what I'm talking about Brother David
[1:32:17] you're thinking this right here well
[1:32:19] I'll say this I'll sympathize a little
[1:32:21] bit you go to speak an entirely
[1:32:23] different word come out and it turns out
[1:32:25] those were exactly the words that were
[1:32:27] perfect for the moment and it left man
[1:32:30] completely out of the picture and it was
[1:32:33] all God and that makes it a personal
[1:32:36] message to that
[1:32:39] individual when you're surprised your
[1:32:41] own self of the words The Voice coming
[1:32:44] out of your own mouth when you're
[1:32:45] shocked I never thought of that I never
[1:32:48] pondered that I wasn't pres ready or to
[1:32:52] present that but it's God speaking and
[1:32:56] it changes a young lady's life my
[1:32:58] brother and sister we serve a personal
[1:33:00] God Amen and we've got a personal
[1:33:03] message from a personal God Amen God's
[1:33:06] word to you is very personal we can take
[1:33:10] the I I don't want it to be a cliche my
[1:33:12] brother and sister but uh we we well
[1:33:17] I'll skip that for a moment we need need
[1:33:19] to let the Lord speak to us on a
[1:33:21] personal level we shouldn't walk out of
[1:33:24] church today and say brother Paul
[1:33:25] preached A good
[1:33:27] sermon Paul don't have much to give
[1:33:30] you something speaks to your heart
[1:33:33] Pricks you reminds you that's God
[1:33:36] speaking to you that's God coming on a
[1:33:39] personal level to connect with you that
[1:33:43] you would realize he cares people say
[1:33:46] well I prayed and God never answered my
[1:33:48] brother and sister I sometimes wonder
[1:33:50] what their prayer really was how sincere
[1:33:53] were were they were they willing to take
[1:33:57] no for the
[1:34:00] answer to accept no the way they would
[1:34:02] accept
[1:34:05] yes God help us that's
[1:34:08] right because a no should be just as
[1:34:11] good as a
[1:34:12] yes
[1:34:16] amen your battle is personal the word is
[1:34:20] personal amen I always like this it's a
[1:34:23] it's a
[1:34:24] a example that we should all relate to
[1:34:27] because the prophet shares this the two
[1:34:30] men walking out of church and one says
[1:34:31] he called me a
[1:34:33] bozzer and one says he called me an
[1:34:35] eagle now my brother and sister what we
[1:34:38] don't know is what was the spirit they
[1:34:42] took into church right amen they come
[1:34:46] out being called a buzzard in their
[1:34:50] idea did they not take a buzzard spirit
[1:34:55] to
[1:34:58] church God is a god of love but he's
[1:35:00] also a god of
[1:35:01] judgment he's also a god of Truth
[1:35:06] amen and when truth
[1:35:09] comes now I know this will be getting
[1:35:13] personal don't lift your hands I don't
[1:35:16] embarrass themselves have you ever come
[1:35:19] to church with a bad
[1:35:22] attitude I want to make it simple I'm
[1:35:24] going to lift my hand for everyone
[1:35:28] here yes sir that's right and now you
[1:35:32] just answer for yourself we don't want
[1:35:34] to make too many things personal
[1:35:37] public what did you get out of the
[1:35:47] service and did you leave with a bad
[1:35:49] attitude
[1:35:58] but I've got something to bail y'all out
[1:36:01] let me help you with this it wasn't your
[1:36:04] fault the pastor didn't pray
[1:36:11] enough I've heard it come onen and the
[1:36:15] people who think that actually believe
[1:36:19] that
[1:36:21] my what our answer should be I came with
[1:36:23] with a bad attitude we all I've saw it
[1:36:25] on your faces so we can go from there
[1:36:28] you know your faces kind of tell on us
[1:36:31] don't
[1:36:32] it but if we walked out in a contrite
[1:36:37] spirit saying Lord forgive me that's
[1:36:43] it I don't want to get distracted
[1:36:48] here you see we got to get at the level
[1:36:52] God speaks to us
[1:36:54] amen now you see even back in those days
[1:36:58] was such a glorious time here in the
[1:37:00] United States the prophet is Chris
[1:37:01] crossing the country the Nations the
[1:37:03] world a and um you know they were still
[1:37:06] the scoffers when brother Brandon would
[1:37:08] say well the Lord spoke to me and
[1:37:09] there'd be people like no he doesn't do
[1:37:11] that anymore that's old that's old and
[1:37:15] brother brandham come along and he's
[1:37:17] talking a little different subject but
[1:37:19] the context is is the same he says I can
[1:37:22] show you where God put it in the church
[1:37:25] you show me where he took it out that's
[1:37:28] right see so there's so many conflicting
[1:37:31] Spirits because the people would say
[1:37:32] this is done this is finished and that
[1:37:35] comes right down into this day right now
[1:37:36] my brother and sister there's people
[1:37:38] that think we'd be just fine if we never
[1:37:41] ever ever uh did anything more than just
[1:37:45] knot our head a little bit never got any
[1:37:47] more uh demonstrative as it were and
[1:37:50] there's people and that's good but you
[1:37:53] have some over here that rejoicing in
[1:37:55] the word of God I'm not going to steal
[1:37:58] their rejoicing and their praise because
[1:38:01] I'm the quiet tender kind that tiptoe
[1:38:05] into
[1:38:06] church and would like the preacher to
[1:38:08] quit preaching because I'm
[1:38:16] thirsty they judge them they judge
[1:38:20] them you know what a personal God does
[1:38:24] he gives you
[1:38:26] unction he gives you
[1:38:30] unction you can yell Hallelujah you can
[1:38:34] whisper
[1:38:37] Hallelujah you can halfway through
[1:38:39] church after you've told your children
[1:38:42] don't want you walking in and out of
[1:38:45] church halfway through church you can
[1:38:47] get up and go to the water fountain your
[1:38:50] salvation's not at
[1:38:52] risk it's a
[1:38:54] personal message to you amen and young
[1:38:59] people hear me and hear me well
[1:39:03] please it's not Grandma and Grandpa's
[1:39:05] message that's right it's not Mom and
[1:39:07] Dad's message it's not the pastor's
[1:39:10] message it's got to be a personal
[1:39:14] message to you that's
[1:39:18] right there the reason we have a lot of
[1:39:20] troubles my brother and sister is
[1:39:22] because we' pampered our children
[1:39:23] children to keep them from the world we'
[1:39:26] we've tried to isolate them and that's
[1:39:27] well and good but in isolation we never
[1:39:30] got them in the presence of Christ amen
[1:39:33] we isolated him too well that's right
[1:39:35] amen I know that's a little straight but
[1:39:38] I don't want to be responsible that day
[1:39:39] to stand before God that I did not
[1:39:41] preach truth that I did not lay out a
[1:39:44] foundation that we could come to a place
[1:39:46] by simply being uh open and and letting
[1:39:50] God come to us let him speak to us we've
[1:39:53] got to give that opportunity to God Amen
[1:39:57] the prophet of God said that he's a
[1:39:59] gentleman he'll never barge his way into
[1:40:01] your life you have to give him
[1:40:03] opportunity to come Amen to show that he
[1:40:07] is real in this day amen hallelujah I'm
[1:40:11] kind of glad my brother and sister I
[1:40:13] know this probably will come across uh
[1:40:15] and I probably shouldn't even say it but
[1:40:17] I'm kind of glad that I don't have my
[1:40:19] parents' message
[1:40:25] amen our parents came out of
[1:40:26] denomination most of them they had a
[1:40:29] whole another set of baggage that they
[1:40:32] had to deal with that's right they had a
[1:40:34] lot of things they learned somewhere
[1:40:36] else that they had to decide does this
[1:40:40] fit or does it not they had a lot of
[1:40:44] baggage to unpack to move into the open
[1:40:48] word that's right I'm actually glad I
[1:40:51] don't have my parents' message amen but
[1:40:53] you see there would be others that they
[1:40:56] knew the whole story of my life would
[1:40:58] say I'm sure glad I don't have Paul's
[1:41:02] message but you say when God comes and
[1:41:05] he has a personal message for
[1:41:10] you did that all make sense to you guys
[1:41:13] I don't want to leave any Topsy Turvy
[1:41:15] out
[1:41:17] there my brother and sister you know
[1:41:20] when
[1:41:22] you when you grow up as a young
[1:41:26] child in a household going through some
[1:41:30] of my mother's effects and come across
[1:41:32] pictures and I'm not going to show that
[1:41:35] picture to any of you because you know
[1:41:38] the Lord chastize Brother brandham for
[1:41:40] calling them
[1:41:41] Ricky and that's a picture of a
[1:41:46] Ricky long hair defiant
[1:41:49] look and that's truly defined who I was
[1:41:54] but God had a personal message for me
[1:41:58] amen the Lord I've shoplifted I should
[1:42:02] oh did I say that out
[1:42:04] loud I've shof lifted I've broke every
[1:42:07] traffic law that there
[1:42:10] is I don't glorify this but I'm telling
[1:42:13] you my brother and sister some of these
[1:42:14] things would might be quite
[1:42:16] shocking we' done it but God said that's
[1:42:19] not who you are amen and now Paul I I
[1:42:23] have a message for you amen amen and in
[1:42:27] that message I had a hard time that's
[1:42:30] why I made the statement I said about my
[1:42:32] parents message I had a hard time of
[1:42:34] letting go of who Paul
[1:42:37] was things ingrained in Paul the
[1:42:42] Defiance the Rebellion the
[1:42:46] attitude oh don't look at me that way
[1:42:49] Saints I know you guys too well amen we
[1:42:53] have to let go with that amen because
[1:42:55] God's message to us has no room for
[1:42:58] Rebellion that's right it has no room
[1:43:00] for defiance it has no room for
[1:43:02] disrespect it has no room for blat and
[1:43:05] disregard of God's word
[1:43:08] hallelujah oh yeah it's to the age the
[1:43:12] message is it's to the church right the
[1:43:15] church has called out people but it goes
[1:43:18] deeper than that it's to you personally
[1:43:21] amen hallelujah I need to hurry up and
[1:43:25] close you know it's a personal word that
[1:43:27] makes you who you are amen we sit here
[1:43:31] today Overcomers it's God's personal
[1:43:33] word to you amen amen you can be
[1:43:38] reformed and you can be
[1:43:41] re-educated but the only thing that
[1:43:43] really matters is to be rebirthed amen
[1:43:46] amen that's the only one that really
[1:43:48] matters out of all of that
[1:43:50] hallelujah amen
[1:43:53] I tell you how it works give you an idea
[1:43:55] what it is to be changed I had a good
[1:43:58] friend in the construction world when I
[1:44:00] I left that I kind of our friendship
[1:44:03] kind of
[1:44:04] faded he was an alcoholic from the time
[1:44:07] he was about 12 13 years
[1:44:10] old he got up there about
[1:44:13] 35 had a wife and
[1:44:16] children and he got sick and tired of
[1:44:18] being sick and
[1:44:20] tired and he went to rehab after rehab
[1:44:24] after
[1:44:26] rehab and right after he got out of him
[1:44:29] he
[1:44:30] failed finally he went to a
[1:44:33] rehab
[1:44:35] and he whipped it and the last I ever
[1:44:39] had connections with him he had never
[1:44:40] drank
[1:44:42] again now I want you to catch this
[1:44:45] there's spiritual side to this I asked
[1:44:47] him one day I said how did you do this
[1:44:50] and he said well Paul I read the
[1:44:52] brochure years I didn't comprehend what
[1:44:55] they were talking about I checked in to
[1:44:58] this rehab they showed me my room they
[1:45:01] showed me the building they showed me
[1:45:03] all of the things and then they showed
[1:45:05] me the
[1:45:07] bar and I thought I'm paying 20 grand to
[1:45:11] go to a place that has a
[1:45:16] bar yep drink all you want he said when
[1:45:21] the sun went down the first day he was
[1:45:23] in there he was Stone drunk didn't even
[1:45:27] remember going to
[1:45:28] bed the next day he got up wandered down
[1:45:31] there there's all the
[1:45:34] alcohol and he said I thought this got
[1:45:36] to be a joke of some kind he went over
[1:45:38] poured him some
[1:45:41] alcohol and he's
[1:45:44] like they've ripped me off this is a
[1:45:48] scam but what he didn't know is they
[1:45:53] started putting
[1:45:54] something in the
[1:45:57] alcohol and he went in there and he
[1:45:59] drank drank all he could drink remembers
[1:46:02] that remember going to bed but he did
[1:46:05] remember falling out of bed and
[1:46:06] wretching in the middle of the
[1:46:09] night and wretching and the next day he
[1:46:12] was wretching and the day after that he
[1:46:14] was wretching until as a man who has
[1:46:17] finally beat
[1:46:19] alcoholism just the sniff of Al
[1:46:23] alcohol causes him to just oh I got to
[1:46:27] get out of
[1:46:31] here he said the one fallacy catch that
[1:46:35] Saints the one fallacy that I saw after
[1:46:39] the
[1:46:42] fact I still wanted to drink alcohol
[1:46:53] hope you follow me as we
[1:46:55] close God's personal message to you was
[1:46:58] not to make you sick of
[1:47:03] sin but to completely deliver you from
[1:47:07] it
[1:47:09] right not the idea of sin caused you to
[1:47:15] revolt but the scripture says the
[1:47:17] Apostle Paul says he took away the
[1:47:19] desire of it amen that's a personal
[1:47:24] message from God dealing with us not
[1:47:29] causing a
[1:47:32] countertype I've joked about it before
[1:47:35] we got some Believers in Montana I hope
[1:47:37] they don't listen to this you know let's
[1:47:39] just move way up in the mountains of
[1:47:40] Montana you guys know how beautiful it
[1:47:42] is up where brother Adrian sister aah
[1:47:44] are hey you know we could move out in
[1:47:47] the woods out there and we could just
[1:47:48] have some pretty strict laws about what
[1:47:51] can even be brought into to our
[1:47:54] colony and then we can enforce those
[1:47:57] rules on
[1:47:58] you but you know what
[1:48:01] happened there'd be some of us that
[1:48:03] figure out how to break the rules right
[1:48:06] cuz the colony in the mountains is not
[1:48:09] going to save
[1:48:11] us but God said my personal message to
[1:48:14] you is strong enough I'm going to take
[1:48:17] you right in the middle of leod deia and
[1:48:21] set you down
[1:48:24] and you are going to be the Overcomer
[1:48:27] amen you're going to be the one who is
[1:48:31] still living the word you're going to be
[1:48:35] the one that is still praising God
[1:48:37] you're going to be the one why it's not
[1:48:41] a
[1:48:42] fix it's a new birth amen a new creation
[1:48:46] and Christ has this personal message to
[1:48:50] you amen I think I'll just uh quit right
[1:48:53] there I got quite a bit more um but I
[1:48:57] would like to read this last little
[1:48:59] quote right here
[1:49:00] persant now see the works of God are for
[1:49:03] ordained of God do you believe that
[1:49:06] congregation says amen Jesus met a blind
[1:49:10] man one time and said who sinned him or
[1:49:12] his mother or so forth or his daddy
[1:49:16] neither one but the works of God might
[1:49:19] be made manifest see this is the work of
[1:49:23] God and when you feel something pressing
[1:49:26] to you hold on to it that's God speaking
[1:49:31] to you amen amen we're living in that
[1:49:34] time my brother and sister that the word
[1:49:36] has come amen it
[1:49:39] is
[1:49:41] hard let's see I think we raised our
[1:49:44] hand earlier and acknowledge that we
[1:49:46] maybe had a bad week or some
[1:49:49] struggle wonder why that would be is it
[1:49:52] because you're weak and have no faith is
[1:49:55] it because you might possibly be a
[1:49:59] lukewarm
[1:50:01] believer some would like you to believe
[1:50:04] that but I'll tell you what I would like
[1:50:07] you to believe exactly what the prophet
[1:50:10] taught this is God working manifesting
[1:50:14] his word in you going to be tested
[1:50:18] without a
[1:50:19] test going to be purified with no fire
[1:50:23] going to be an overcomer without any
[1:50:25] fiery
[1:50:26] darts come on we should be able to say
[1:50:30] Lord whatever you have for me that's
[1:50:33] right whatever comes my way Lord the
[1:50:35] word is more than enough amen amen I
[1:50:39] will learn how to fight I will quench oh
[1:50:44] let let me just so that so this won't
[1:50:46] come across as a soft soap sermon okay
[1:50:49] if you're not listening to the right
[1:50:50] music I hope the Lord deals with your
[1:50:52] heart
[1:50:53] I hope that he makes you feel like that
[1:50:55] you have just reached the very bottom if
[1:50:58] you are doing things amen if you're you
[1:51:01] know what I I'm allowed to preach this
[1:51:03] you know why I am cuz I was one if
[1:51:06] you're a
[1:51:07] chameleon you know I used to get on the
[1:51:09] school bus I look like the perfect
[1:51:11] little message boy I got on there my
[1:51:14] hair was combed amen the shirt you know
[1:51:17] everything get on the school bus by the
[1:51:19] time I got off the school bus my sleeves
[1:51:22] were rolled up the shirt tail was jerked
[1:51:24] out my pants were pulled down oh no
[1:51:26] that's not a new
[1:51:28] thing I got off the bus with
[1:51:32] attitude don't mess with me man yeah you
[1:51:36] know what I looked like when I got off
[1:51:37] the bus at
[1:51:45] home yes ma'am no
[1:51:48] ma'am let's not be
[1:51:51] chameleons I i' rather we be men and
[1:51:54] women young men young women strong
[1:51:58] enough to say you know what Pastor I'm
[1:52:01] struggling I need prayer I need a little
[1:52:03] help I need I need something I need you
[1:52:05] to help me break through something
[1:52:07] encourage me let the word encourag
[1:52:09] because I'm going to sit right here and
[1:52:11] say I can't fix your problem but I can
[1:52:13] pray for you amen I can change your life
[1:52:16] through prayer and when you realize it's
[1:52:19] God dealing with you you'll come to the
[1:52:22] the place you won't have to run to the
[1:52:24] pastor every time that's right you won't
[1:52:26] have to run to those you think are great
[1:52:28] men of God you'll be able to stop and
[1:52:31] say that's the devil and I know it's the
[1:52:33] devil that's a footprint of the
[1:52:35] devil and I'm not I'm not going there
[1:52:39] because as the opening quote we read the
[1:52:42] prophet wanted us to see how to fight
[1:52:45] against those things how to fight back
[1:52:50] to be uh a wear be prepared when Satan
[1:52:55] comes rars up his ugly head you can say
[1:52:58] oh oh I've got a bad attitude right now
[1:53:00] but that's a devil and my bad attitude
[1:53:03] uh w wow yeah that bad attitude is the
[1:53:09] devil I don't even want anything to do
[1:53:11] with this bad attitude because I don't
[1:53:14] want anything to do with the devil and
[1:53:17] suddenly my brother and sister we don't
[1:53:18] invite him in we don't sit down and
[1:53:21] drink tea with him no I read a quote
[1:53:24] once I don't remember a Spurgeon or one
[1:53:26] of those was talking about tea and the
[1:53:28] devil that's why I've never liked
[1:53:30] tea amen I I don't want to drink tea
[1:53:33] because I don't want to end up find
[1:53:34] myself sitting with the devil drinking
[1:53:35] tea amen but my
[1:53:38] brother to all the you that drink tea
[1:53:41] that's up to you
[1:53:43] amen but look at this my brother and
[1:53:45] sister we are here
[1:53:48] today because God has a message for you
[1:53:52] and and I am oh I'll throw one last
[1:53:56] ringer at you before we
[1:53:57] quit I'm not talking about brother Brown
[1:54:03] sermons God's got a message for
[1:54:06] you he wants to deliver it to you lip to
[1:54:11] ear amen he wants to get close enough to
[1:54:16] deliver his message to you amen amen
[1:54:20] will we let him y that's the question
[1:54:23] will we let him get close enough now
[1:54:26] don't misunderstand when I say that it's
[1:54:28] not the
[1:54:29] message if you have spiritual
[1:54:32] understanding you'll know what I'm
[1:54:32] talking about because we could walk in
[1:54:36] today with our
[1:54:38] Bible and 10 messages under our own and
[1:54:42] that won't change
[1:54:44] us but you ever get close enough and
[1:54:48] allow the Lord to get close enough to
[1:54:51] whisper in your
[1:54:53] ear you'll never be the same now I know
[1:54:57] none of you ever have temper tantrums
[1:54:59] and never suffer from the depressions
[1:55:01] and the anxieties I know none of you
[1:55:03] ever do that but those of us that aren't
[1:55:06] as
[1:55:07] strong we need to learn how to fight the
[1:55:10] devil and I say thank you Lord he's
[1:55:13] given us his word amen hallelujah you
[1:55:16] guys I know you love the Lord isn't that
[1:55:18] interesting how preachers are always
[1:55:19] like do you love the Lord I think I
[1:55:22] think what they're really trying to say
[1:55:23] is do you still love
[1:55:25] me yeah
[1:55:29] amen
[1:55:37] hallelujah
[1:55:42] yeah how many of you have
[1:55:50] Twitter yes it's a TR
[1:55:55] but we could put any other name in
[1:55:58] there
[1:56:00] Facebook I don't know what are the names
[1:56:02] of those things I'm so archaic it's just
[1:56:05] getting to be
[1:56:07] ridiculous but anyway you
[1:56:13] know maybe you don't use Twitter but I
[1:56:16] have it on here and it's good because
[1:56:17] most of you shook your head no so that
[1:56:19] makes it really
[1:56:21] good but
[1:56:24] does Twitter preach the
[1:56:29] gospel does Twitter ever condemn men of
[1:56:34] sin does Twitter ever cause a
[1:56:39] Revival now I'm going to step out
[1:56:43] whatever it is on your
[1:56:45] phone ask the same questions of
[1:56:50] that we've got a message message it was
[1:56:53] not delivered by
[1:56:56] Twitter it's a personal
[1:56:59] one-on-one Holy Ghost
[1:57:02] message delivered to
[1:57:06] you
[1:57:09] behold I
[1:57:11] send Leo deia Elijah the
[1:57:15] prophet does that scripture sound
[1:57:18] familiar behold I send your church
[1:57:24] Elijah the
[1:57:26] prophet what did he say somebody remind
[1:57:30] me behold I
[1:57:34] send
[1:57:36] you personal that's right is
[1:57:40] that okay I know I get all those things
[1:57:42] you know the teachers used to say
[1:57:44] diagram the
[1:57:46] sentence and um I figured out my teacher
[1:57:49] never wanted me back in English class
[1:57:51] and I'm not proud of that but it was
[1:57:54] effective so I just diagrammed them any
[1:57:56] old way and they'd all be marked I she
[1:58:00] loved him so much she highlighted them
[1:58:02] with a red marker and
[1:58:05] uh I know it shows I know it shows nouns
[1:58:09] pronouns adverbs those are all good I
[1:58:11] hope those will make some money for you
[1:58:14] someday but my brother and sister the
[1:58:16] one thing I do
[1:58:18] know is when something is personal
[1:58:22] and when it's personal you can recognize
[1:58:25] it as
[1:58:27] personal and the
[1:58:29] prophet
[1:58:31] delivered Elijah's gospel to us we have
[1:58:35] it delivered to you and I let's not let
[1:58:38] it sit on the Shelf let's not let it be
[1:58:41] diminished in
[1:58:42] value let's make it
[1:58:46] important as the scripture says our
[1:58:49] daily
[1:58:50] bread I don't know about you guys I love
[1:58:52] to
[1:58:53] eat amen and when you think about the
[1:58:56] word being as valuable to us as our
[1:58:58] daily bread it means got to eat got to
[1:59:03] consume it must have it amen oh God
[1:59:07] bless you all amen let's just stand sing

[1:59:58] would speak emphatically will'll serve
