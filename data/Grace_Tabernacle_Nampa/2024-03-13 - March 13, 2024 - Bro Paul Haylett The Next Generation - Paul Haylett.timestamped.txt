[31:11] it aren't you glad tonight you can say
[31:14] Amen to that just to
[31:17] know every promise that God has
[31:20] given I just think it's wonderful there
[31:24] because U just our little thought
[31:26] tonight be very
[31:28] very simple I want to speak to you about
[31:31] the Next
[31:32] Generation and all through the scripture
[31:35] we see the
[31:37] reference of God blessing a generation
[31:40] cursing a generation being with those in
[31:42] that Generation all of these
[31:45] generational things and here we are
[31:48] tonight and you know we have to be
[31:50] planning what the next generation will
[31:53] do we have to lay all of the stones we
[31:56] have to build the foundation as it were
[31:58] of the Tabernacle for the Next
[32:00] Generation we can say well uh we're
[32:03] we're here looking for in our generation
[32:06] but we have to understand that in this
[32:08] moment of time there's another
[32:11] generation coming but there's also a
[32:13] generation that's leaving
[32:15] us and so the church has always been
[32:18] built upon the foundation of the Next
[32:21] Generation we're looking forward if we
[32:23] do not introduce our children to the
[32:26] Lord Jesus Christ to they do not receive
[32:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost if they
[32:31] don't have a personal relationship there
[32:34] will be no Next Generation but God has
[32:37] given us a beautiful gift not something
[32:39] that we have to produce in and of
[32:41] ourself we don't have to say we've got
[32:43] to make this happen but what we do is
[32:45] just lay the groundwork and sometimes as
[32:48] we'll look back through the Bible we
[32:50] won't revisit all of this tonight but
[32:52] you look uh they laid their life down
[32:54] for the Next Generation they sacrificed
[32:57] themselves for for their next generation
[32:59] and uh which might be their very own
[33:02] children but they lay that out they
[33:04] don't say well if God if God wants it to
[33:07] be then it'll come to pass the word says
[33:10] he wants it to be and he expects us to
[33:13] be part of the bringing of it to pass
[33:16] I'll just give you a little quick type
[33:18] the spirit and the bride say come if the
[33:21] bride sits down and says I'll speak I'll
[33:24] make a noise I'll be a
[33:26] witness if God wants me
[33:30] to he's already declared he wants you to
[33:33] he's already declared you are the voice
[33:37] of the end time amen good to see each
[33:40] and every one of you tonight let's just
[33:42] turn in our Bibles amen as we'll just
[33:45] take I I've used this scripture a few
[33:48] times lately in Jeremiah
[33:50] 29:11 but um you know I just keep coming
[33:54] back to it because uh you see uh I I
[33:58] know uh the thoughts God has to me the
[34:02] thoughts God has to you we we know that
[34:04] the word thank you musicians uh sure
[34:07] enjoyed the song service brother Alex uh
[34:10] and so he says right here in verse 11
[34:13] for I know the thoughts that I think
[34:15] toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of
[34:18] peace and not of evil to give you an
[34:20] expected end now if we'll just focus on
[34:23] that little thought right there God's
[34:26] already got an expect Ed end for us amen
[34:30] that we we sometimes you know and I I
[34:33] don't want to be too harsh but it's
[34:35] almost like it's denominational thinking
[34:38] that we're still somehow got to labor to
[34:41] get ourselves in here what we've got to
[34:44] labor is just to Simply accept it and
[34:48] act upon it in every situation Lord help
[34:51] me amen that's what we're not going to
[34:54] labor and get ourselves in what we got
[34:56] to do is labor to get ourselves out of
[34:59] the picture because God's already said
[35:01] you are in the picture amen hallelujah
[35:05] thoughts of Peace not of evil to give
[35:06] you an expected end then shall ye call
[35:09] upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me
[35:12] and I will hearken unto you and ye shall
[35:15] seek me and oh I love this amen not a
[35:20] question mark there ye shall seek me and
[35:24] find me when you shall search for me
[35:26] with all Your Heart Lord help us to
[35:29] search for you with all of our heart
[35:32] Lord bless this time tonight Lord Jesus
[35:35] we thank you for your grace and mercy
[35:37] Lord just help us the little sniffles
[35:39] and these things Lord that would just
[35:41] try to hold us back but we just claim
[35:43] the blood we claim the healing virtue
[35:45] and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:47] tonight Lord that we can do father great
[35:50] things in the word tonight just want to
[35:53] Father just uh remember those who are
[35:55] not here uh the struggle of life our our
[35:58] brother Sergey on the road brother
[36:01] vasile I I believe probably on the road

[36:06] one father that we would have need of
[36:08] tonight oh Lord that you would just
[36:11] speak to each heart be kind to us father
[36:14] we ask Lord just ask for your word to
[36:17] come forth the way you would desire in
[36:19] the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[36:24] seated had a nice little visit with our
[36:27] brother John Andes uh and uh he sends
[36:30] his greetings to all of you and uh you
[36:34] know you just have to love brother John
[36:37] uh when I called him you know the he
[36:39] answered the phone and the first thing I
[36:41] hear is hallelujah hallelujah and so you
[36:45] know you just got to love a man that no
[36:47] matter what you know just has that kind
[36:49] of enthusiasm so greetings to you uh
[36:52] from Brother John Andes his family and
[36:55] the church there amen
[36:58] as we look at this I want to just draw
[37:01] attention for a
[37:02] moment upon three elements here first
[37:07] you have to call upon him and and I
[37:10] would pray you know is is it has to be
[37:13] something we should not have to labor to
[37:15] call upon the Lord he is not the 911 of
[37:19] Our Lives he is there everpresent with
[37:22] us he's not only to be called upon
[37:24] emergencies but we should learn to just
[37:27] draw him into every element whether it
[37:30] be going to work or traveling or
[37:33] whatever it might be a difficult
[37:35] situation sometimes my brothers and
[37:38] sisters uh we we will be uh venturing
[37:41] you might say in business or something
[37:43] and we need to know whether to go
[37:45] forward or to stop and you know it's so
[37:48] easy just to draw our Lord into it and
[37:50] just ask him Lord if this is not
[37:52] supposed to happen please close the door
[37:55] and uh you know sometimes God allows the
[37:58] door to be unlocked and he's waiting for
[38:00] us to find the faith to you might say
[38:03] reach out and lay a finger on that door
[38:05] but at the same time we don't come with
[38:08] a battering ram and a sledgehammer and a
[38:10] sawall and say nope God opened the door
[38:13] but we have to find that balance in our
[38:16] lives and so when we look upon this we
[38:18] call upon the Lord now the word says
[38:20] that when we call upon him he draws nigh
[38:23] to us can anyone tonight testify that
[38:25] that is the truth amen that when we call
[38:28] upon his name not half-hearted like oh
[38:31] Lord but a serious call upon him he
[38:34] comes right down in our midst and he
[38:36] speaks to us and he answers and I don't
[38:39] know if this ever happens to you but you
[38:41] know sometimes you know we have
[38:43] questions and and uh you know I tell you
[38:46] when I was a younger man uh it impacted
[38:49] me greatly when the prophet of God was
[38:51] there at his cave and he had those
[38:53] questions before the Lord and the wind
[38:56] would come and blow his his Bible open
[38:59] and then he thought oh well that's not
[39:01] really an answer there is was a breeze
[39:03] and close it again and the wind would
[39:05] blow it right back to the same exact
[39:07] scripture God was using that breeze amen
[39:12] he's in the wind and was speaking to the
[39:14] prophet and so when we look at that and
[39:17] realize the keys that God is using uh to
[39:20] speak and when we call upon him he said
[39:23] I draw near or nigh unto you and I say
[39:27] Lord help us to make that one of the the
[39:29] foremost things that we do in the
[39:31] elements of life is to call upon the
[39:33] Lord and then he follows this here in
[39:36] Jeremiah and tells them you know um I I
[39:40] want you to go and pray unto me so just
[39:43] uh drawing nigh to him calling upon Him
[39:47] is not quite the same as praying right
[39:50] we can say oh Lord uh you know give me
[39:52] wisdom but how about get specific about
[39:56] what your need for this wisdom is and
[39:58] and pray out and and ask and wait you
[40:01] know one of the the failures I think we
[40:04] have in humanity is uh and and I know
[40:07] sometimes in my busy life I I do this
[40:10] and I'm not proud of this I want to
[40:11] break this habit but we'll pray and
[40:14] before even our words almost go into The
[40:17] Ether we're already up and gone and so
[40:20] you know it's like Lord bless my
[40:23] day and you know I'm trying to break
[40:26] that habit I'm trying to to get to the
[40:28] place that I I want to really take a
[40:31] moment and and we can justify to
[40:33] ourselves well I'm praying I prayed this
[40:36] morning sister Jerry and I have
[40:39] devotions in the morning and you know
[40:41] sometimes uh they're pretty abbreviated
[40:44] I'm sorry to say and it's usually Paul's
[40:46] fault because Paul has a zillion things
[40:49] went to bed last night with unfinished
[40:51] things got up this morning somehow
[40:53] overnight they didn't finish themselves
[40:56] and so it's there that just like
[40:58] devotions breakfast you know got to go
[41:01] but you know what we really need to make
[41:04] that time and I'm preaching to Paul in
[41:06] case this seems a little direct but I I
[41:09] need to just take that time and and uh
[41:13] you know he says you pray unto me and
[41:15] I'll hearken unto you I I'm going to
[41:17] hear you I give you this assurance that
[41:20] I'm listening to your needs and he says
[41:22] you shall seek
[41:24] me and when you search for me with all
[41:27] your
[41:28] heart my I tell you I believe that God
[41:32] understands our lives but I believe that
[41:34] we should understand that we've got more
[41:36] of Our Lives to give we've got more to
[41:40] give back than we seem to think and you
[41:43] know we look at God's plans for our
[41:44] futures and and uh you know sometimes we
[41:48] we have I I I'm a firm believer in in
[41:51] planning your future young people if the
[41:53] Lord so leads you to to get a certain
[41:56] education or to do certain things if
[41:59] it's in the will of God pursue it but
[42:02] you know the thing is is it's as the
[42:04] scripture says seek ye first amen so if
[42:07] we we go and do all these things without
[42:10] God blessing it well we will be able to
[42:12] say God was with us but maybe not to the
[42:15] degree he would have if we had committed
[42:18] it fully to him and so as we look at
[42:21] this I I just want to jump down into
[42:24] Psalms 119 uh 102 to
[42:28] 106 and uh forgive me tonight just been
[42:32] suffering with some kind of allergy or
[42:34] something and then you know there's
[42:38] always a action and a
[42:44] reaction Psalms 1119 says I have not
[42:47] departed from thy judgments now this is
[42:50] David declaring unto the Lord I have not
[42:53] departed from thy judgments for thou
[42:55] Hast taught me I want him to be my
[42:58] teacher how sweet are thy words unto my
[43:02] taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth
[43:05] through thy precepts I get understanding
[43:08] therefore I hate every false way now you
[43:12] look at this I want to just elaborate on
[43:14] that for just a moment of uh hating
[43:17] every false way do you realize my
[43:19] brother and sister what God has done to
[43:22] you and I it sometimes the false way
[43:25] sometimes the teaching it is actually
[43:28] just seems to make more sense and more
[43:31] comfortable and it's more reasonable to
[43:33] our hearing and yet God has done
[43:36] something to you and I that we come to
[43:39] the place that we hate every false way
[43:42] and that alarm that God put in you you
[43:45] know that subconscious I was just
[43:47] reading brother Brown's talking about
[43:48] this he's talking about the little deer
[43:50] how that he put that in that little deer
[43:53] there's something in there and the
[43:55] little deer don't know why he start
[43:57] starts to shake and get nervous he
[43:59] doesn't understand exactly what it is he
[44:01] can't see the enemy might not even be
[44:03] able to smell the enemy but there's
[44:06] something there that he senses something
[44:08] isn't right and he put that in that
[44:10] little deer that when that enemy the
[44:12] wolf or whatever it might be is coming
[44:14] upon the little deer that he's he's
[44:17] starting to look around he's no longer
[44:19] comfortable just shoving his head in the
[44:21] grass but he starts to look around and
[44:23] say what is it and that's the same
[44:25] Instinct in the whole holy spirit that
[44:27] God has given to you and I that when
[44:30] people with wrong spirits and different
[44:32] things and I don't mean to elaborate too
[44:34] much there's nothing other than just a
[44:36] teaching moment but you know brother
[44:38] brandham said all Satan has done has
[44:41] perverted the word so when a perversion
[44:45] a perverted Spirit comes it might be
[44:47] just a little twist of Doctrine might be
[44:49] a little twist of something it might be
[44:52] people justifying their behavior
[44:54] whatever it would be but when that
[44:56] Spirit comes the bride starts to get a
[44:58] little nervous there's something in the
[45:00] air that she doesn't sense or she does
[45:03] sense but it it isn't right and she
[45:05] starts to say Lord what is this and many
[45:09] times you'll see people are get very
[45:11] concerned about you know being deceived
[45:13] we' we've talked about this many times
[45:15] but let's remember God put something in
[45:17] you amen we don't have to talk about
[45:20] well we know the word we know this we
[45:22] know that God's put something in the
[45:24] bride that knows things are not right
[45:28] and Lord help us to just yield and let
[45:31] the Holy Spirit deal with us and give us
[45:34] guidance amen hallelujah you know you
[45:37] you go and and I I I think South Africa
[45:41] there the experiences we've had is quite
[45:45] uh to me startling drives at home my
[45:48] brother and sister you'll see there how
[45:51] that the the uh leopard he will slink
[45:55] through the grass and we've experienced
[45:57] this personally that they can move so
[46:00] close not be seen we're looking at it
[46:02] saying hey hey gazelle hey you gazelle
[46:06] you and sometimes we think that little
[46:08] gazelle right here that you know he's
[46:11] he's going to be the one the cat jumps
[46:13] on but what he does is the cat's looking
[46:16] and he's got the one who's got his head
[46:18] stuffed in the
[46:20] grass and the cat's already made several
[46:23] bounds before the other one looks up up
[46:27] and says oh
[46:29] my you see the holy spirit is our
[46:33] warning he is our strength he's our
[46:36] guidance he's the one and we need to
[46:39] learn my brother and sister and you know
[46:41] this is actually a teachable moment now
[46:43] we can't teach our children the Holy
[46:45] Spirit but we can teach our children or
[46:48] make it aware to them and when I say
[46:50] children I mean whatever uh spectrum of
[46:53] age that there is to to when this alarm
[46:57] goes off heed it pay attention to it
[47:01] don't ignore it somebody says hey go out
[47:04] and go with us to here and you know go
[47:07] over here we're going to go to the
[47:09] movies we're going to go park on the dam
[47:11] we're going to go do this and that alarm
[47:14] goes off we can make our children aware
[47:17] that you need to heed that that warning
[47:19] you need to heed that alarm clock not
[47:22] alarm clock alarm warning that is going
[47:25] off you need to heat it
[47:27] because there's Generations before you
[47:29] will tell you that we didn't heed it and
[47:32] there was always trouble
[47:37] there and we see how sweet the words are
[47:41] to my taste sweeter than honey through
[47:44] thy precepts I get understanding
[47:46] therefore I hate every false way now
[47:49] this is not a personal hate my brother
[47:51] and sister this is something that
[47:53] becomes repugnant that becomes something
[47:55] that we push away from something that we
[47:58] we are willing to let go and verse 105
[48:01] says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[48:04] a light into my path and I have sworn
[48:08] and I will perform it that I will keep
[48:10] thy righteous judgment what something
[48:13] you know we don't uh uh speak in the
[48:15] sense of what the world calls swearing
[48:17] or but when we sworn it's like an oath
[48:20] that we've told the Lord you I'm going
[48:22] to obey your word Lord I'm going to
[48:24] stand on this word and I will perform
[48:27] and I'll keep thy righteous judgment and
[48:29] my brother and sister if this seems
[48:30] strange to us every one of us in some
[48:32] form or another in our own words our own
[48:35] way have performed this or sworn to the
[48:37] Lord I'm going to serve you it is an
[48:40] oath as it were it is a commitment that
[48:42] is made it is something that is spoken
[48:45] out from the heart or even from our lips
[48:48] that Lord I want to serve you as David
[48:50] said I want to dwell in the house of the
[48:52] Lord all the days of my life that's what
[48:55] I'm talking about amen I'm not talking
[48:57] about going out and saying a bunch of
[48:59] words and and just saying well I I made
[49:01] some kind of commitment but David put it
[49:03] so well in words that I want to live
[49:06] dwell in your house all the days of my
[49:09] life and he's making that commitment and
[49:11] putting it out there and saying that's
[49:13] what I want to stand by and I say Lord
[49:16] help us help us and you know some might
[49:19] say well you know that that wouldn't
[49:21] work because I've already failed him no
[49:23] my brother and sister God already knew
[49:25] what you were going to do knew every
[49:26] step you would take every word that you
[49:28] would speak every thought that you would
[49:30] think amen either that or he's not God
[49:33] and he's already said I made the way for
[49:36] you to be able to stand in my house and
[49:38] say this is where I want to be all the
[49:41] days of my life and Grace my brother and
[49:43] sister is sufficient in God's eyes it
[49:46] steamrolls over every accusation that
[49:49] Satan's got everything that we have
[49:51] failed everything we come short it steam
[49:53] rolls right over it and God says you're
[49:55] in my house
[49:58] Hallelujah well look at this this is
[50:00] taken out of Luke
[50:01] 1:50 and this is really scripture that
[50:04] is there concerning as it is being
[50:07] recounted of Mary there in the Book of
[50:10] Luke but I want to just draw this verse
[50:13] out it caught my attention and his Mercy
[50:16] is on them that fear Him from generation
[50:20] to
[50:21] generation I remember one time a brother
[50:23] told me he says I just you know was
[50:26] looking
[50:27] and I I just has God just choose a
[50:30] family and just bless
[50:32] them well that's what the word says amen
[50:36] God chooses a family and blesses them
[50:39] now we know many here even amongst us
[50:42] there are the only one in their family
[50:44] that is a Believer but God has given
[50:47] promises and we are looking forward and
[50:50] back my brother and sister I don't care
[50:52] brother Trevor sister Carrie going to
[50:54] visit family I don't care there
[50:56] circumstance as long as there's breath
[50:58] there's life There's Hope amen we get
[51:02] you know get to looking at things you
[51:04] know especially those even that have
[51:05] left the message left what we believe
[51:08] left the word of God and we look at that
[51:10] and the devil like to discourage us but
[51:12] my brother and sister as long as they're
[51:13] breathing There's Hope amen and we
[51:16] should hold to that hope amen and raise
[51:19] up nothing
[51:21] more my own granddaughter here and those
[51:24] that are very special to me amen I sit
[51:27] here and look and I don't just hope for
[51:29] your future I pray positively for your
[51:33] future I pray that as a young child as a
[51:36] teenager that the presence of God
[51:39] surrounds you young people and Carries
[51:42] you forward and when the alarm goes off
[51:44] I pray that you have learned and your
[51:46] parents have taught and the preaching of
[51:48] the word is sufficient that when the
[51:50] alarm goes off that you're going to say
[51:52] I'm out of here I'm not going any
[51:54] farther forward I'm not going to to
[51:56] embrace this the alarm is going off but
[51:59] you see if we're not careful the cares
[52:01] of Life make it such that we think I can
[52:04] deal with this God didn't call you to
[52:06] deal with it he called you to be as it
[52:09] were that when the alarm goes off you
[52:11] run right back into his presence you run
[52:14] right into the Tabernacle you run right
[52:17] into the altar not saying I think I can
[52:20] deal with it and if not there's Grace
[52:23] you know that's a denominational
[52:24] teaching of the day live like you want
[52:26] claim Grace my brother and sister Grace
[52:29] is not for our
[52:30] misbehavior Grace is for when we
[52:40] fail we know that there's only one way
[52:42] to eternal life that is our Lord Jesus
[52:46] Christ we could also take that and word
[52:48] it in such a fashion if we may there's
[52:51] only one way to eternal life and that's
[52:53] through the
[52:54] word because Jesus Christ was the word
[52:58] now
[53:00] Matthew hope yall don't mind if the
[53:02] service is a little abbreviated tonight
[53:05] not sure as I said that it won't be
[53:07] but Matthew the 7th chapter verses 13-
[53:11] 27 we may not read all of this but as we
[53:16] look at
[53:19] this we recognize as we're talking about
[53:22] the Next
[53:23] Generation right every one of us has got
[53:25] a test testimony can we say Amen to that
[53:28] and sometimes our testimonies are very
[53:31] similar but some testimonies um I hope
[53:35] won't be
[53:37] similar I'm trying to break my habit of
[53:40] throwing people under the bus but it
[53:42] seems weird to use yourself for an
[53:44] example I hope young people that none of
[53:46] you choose the route of backsliding in
[53:49] your
[53:49] teens because what'll happen is you'll
[53:52] just have a long rough rocky road but
[53:55] God will draw you right back in and so
[53:59] it's better to recognize that God called
[54:02] you that who you are is not subject to
[54:05] the spirit of Loda it is not something
[54:08] that you know I I'll just be honest with
[54:10] you when I hear that it's in song and
[54:12] it's in statement oh they're just
[54:13] working on their testimony well I'll
[54:15] tell you the testimony you need to work
[54:17] on is I've been in the house of the Lord
[54:21] all the days of my life that's the
[54:24] testimony we should be working on not
[54:27] this idea that we go out here and we do
[54:30] this and do that and go there and go
[54:32] there and get bit and scarred and
[54:34] tainted and then God calls us home my
[54:36] brother and sister that's not the
[54:38] testimony we should be working on Amen
[54:41] we should be teaching and coaching and
[54:44] encouraging our children do what's right
[54:46] do the word not kind of some kind of
[54:49] recovery plan I've never met a man who
[54:53] successfully recovered from being an
[54:55] alcoholic that says I would go back and
[54:57] do that again cuz I was working on my
[55:00] testimony no sir they leave scars they
[55:03] have trouble they have even you might
[55:05] say Nightmares From the life that they
[55:07] did and the mistakes that they made and
[55:10] many a time as you see them I'm speaking
[55:12] in the Christian realm these men come
[55:14] and say oh that God would have kept me
[55:17] from going down that road but I wouldn't
[55:25] listen so if we're going to choose
[55:27] tonight if we had a whiteboard we would
[55:28] write on here work on your testimony
[55:32] that I shall dwell in the house of the
[55:33] Lord all the days of my
[55:37] life now Matthew 713- 27 it says ENT ye
[55:42] at the Straight Gate for wide is the
[55:44] gate and Broad is the way that leadth to
[55:46] destruction and many there be which go
[55:50] in there at because straight is the gate
[55:53] and narrow is the way which leadth into
[55:55] life few there be that find it beware of
[55:59] false prophets now I want you to make
[56:02] this connection here in Matthew that it
[56:04] goes from finding the
[56:06] gate to false prophets in one verse one
[56:11] bit of writing because you see it will
[56:14] be the false prophet that encourages you
[56:17] that this
[56:18] gate is wide God intended it to be that
[56:24] way because we have
[56:28] Grace well I've met grace and grace is
[56:33] wonderful but I don't want to go before
[56:36] my Lord one
[56:38] day with some kind of hope that grace is
[56:42] sufficient to cover bad
[56:45] behavior bad
[56:48] judgment bad
[56:50] Doctrine could go right down the list
[56:52] right so there it is so there'll be few
[56:56] that find it the false prophets are
[56:58] telling you we have the gate God's given
[57:01] us the gate so just listen to us and
[57:04] you'll get in the gate but my brother
[57:06] and sister the word said what I want you
[57:09] to do is go back to the word and find
[57:12] the gate through the word and when you
[57:15] find the gate through the word it
[57:16] wouldn't matter if the gate was this
[57:18] wide or that wide you'll make it in the
[57:21] gate because you're in the word but when
[57:24] we reason it now I'll get to a point
[57:27] here in a minute uh so beware of the
[57:29] false prophets they come to you in
[57:30] sheep's clothing but inwardly they are
[57:32] ravening wolves and you shall know them
[57:34] by their fruits so every ravening wolf
[57:37] has some kind of fruit that he is
[57:40] displaying and sometimes it's so good
[57:45] you don't notice
[57:46] it I Marvel you got to you got to love
[57:50] this I have to share this with you when
[57:52] I was in my teens there was another
[57:55] young man grew up with and we were doing
[57:57] construction work together and typically
[58:00] when a job would get finished we would
[58:02] get some pretty good siiz paychecks and
[58:05] and uh you know one day uh I can even
[58:08] get so close it's the bank that's right
[58:09] in the parking lot of cart your Mall US
[58:12] bank now is what it was it was Ido First
[58:14] National back then and we come out of
[58:16] there and you know I loved cash still do
[58:19] I I'm sorry to admit it hope you guys
[58:21] don't mind you can you can have plastic
[58:23] I take cash but anyway
[58:26] uh it's the love of money
[58:29] right I just liked it I didn't love it
[58:33] so look at this now we walk out of the
[58:35] bank we both got pockets full of cash
[58:39] and I I Marvel at this we were too naive
[58:41] growing up in the message in our little
[58:43] world we were too naive to put it all
[58:45] together but this man comes up and goes
[58:48] hey hey guys uh you guys look like you
[58:50] would be the kind of guys that would
[58:52] like a fancy watch and literally I'm not
[58:54] kidding you he open opens his coat just
[58:57] like all of the symbolics you know just
[59:00] and and he's got all these watches and
[59:03] he said and my friend says oh I really
[59:05] like the looks of that one he pulls it
[59:06] on you know he shows it to him he tries
[59:08] it on and he goes yeah this watch in the
[59:10] Bon marhe is uh you know
[59:14] $275 and the alarm starts going
[59:20] off I've been in the bond
[59:23] Marse I've never seen a spot their store
[59:27] they sell
[59:32] watches the guy keeps going on and I'm
[59:34] like do I say something it's my
[59:37] friend I told him
[59:39] hey um Bon mer doesn't sell watches and
[59:42] the guy immediately say how crafty the
[59:44] devil
[59:46] is you don't know what you're talking
[59:49] about you're a young man you probably
[59:50] never even go in there Bon marhe is a
[59:53] woman's store oh no no I bought I bought
[59:55] dress clothes in there oh you don't even
[59:58] know what you're talking about my friend
[1:00:00] obviously showed his confidence in
[1:00:02] me yeah what's the deal with you buys
[1:00:06] the watch doesn't even go week it quits
[1:00:08] he takes it to a jewelry store to get
[1:00:10] the watch to work and the guy goes oh
[1:00:12] yeah this is about the 50th one of these
[1:00:15] that I have it's junk throw it in the
[1:00:18] trash so you know at the time I told him
[1:00:21] you want to watch go buy a real watch go
[1:00:24] from a store that if it quits you go
[1:00:26] back in there and say this thing has
[1:00:27] quit and and and the guy just brushed
[1:00:30] over that he had an answer for
[1:00:31] everything maneuver it my brother and
[1:00:33] sister there's a
[1:00:34] wolf now if that man had been a preacher
[1:00:37] imagine how effective he would have been
[1:00:41] yeah that anointing that was there so
[1:00:45] you see what happens is is because it is
[1:00:48] very straight to the gate they have to
[1:00:51] go as it were figuratively at night and
[1:00:53] they have to move the boundary marker
[1:00:56] of the word to make it look like that
[1:00:59] there's way more room for living like
[1:01:01] you want to live and that is what you
[1:01:03] see when I give just a short abbreviated
[1:01:06] version here is when they were anointed
[1:01:08] to come and make such an emphasis about
[1:01:12] Grace now their emphasis on Grace my
[1:01:14] brother and sister doesn't even touch
[1:01:17] how awesome and wonderful and wide
[1:01:19] reaching that real Grace is but they
[1:01:22] present Grace as something that they can
[1:01:25] push a button and it's all going to go
[1:01:26] away God's going to ignore everything
[1:01:28] that happened that didn't go the memory
[1:01:30] is wiped out but you see it is because
[1:01:33] the false prophets come and it's there
[1:01:37] and if you give them time you can look
[1:01:40] behind their life what they're leaving
[1:01:44] behind you can see that young people I
[1:01:48] want you if you would listen to me
[1:01:49] tonight I want you even to Brother
[1:01:52] Paul's life Brother Paul's Ministry I
[1:01:55] want you to look at it with a magnifying
[1:01:57] glass and if it don't line up with the
[1:01:59] word of God you don't listen to me
[1:02:03] because that's how close it will come to
[1:02:05] deceive the very elect it will try so
[1:02:07] hard to deceive you but the prophet of
[1:02:10] God said it can't deceive you so just be
[1:02:13] confident and take that maybe even you
[1:02:15] might say practice that now look if it's
[1:02:18] because I don't tie my shoes the same as
[1:02:19] you that it doesn't
[1:02:21] count and if I you know the other day I
[1:02:24] I come to church and fortunately I
[1:02:26] caught it before I come out I don't know
[1:02:28] how I got out of the house that way but
[1:02:30] you know it's always a little weird when
[1:02:32] you're
[1:02:33] ties about like that that's not a
[1:02:37] deceiver okay he's not trying to draw
[1:02:39] your attention away from something
[1:02:42] so everything know ye that by them
[1:02:45] fruits men gather Grapes of thorns figs
[1:02:48] of thistles even so every good tree
[1:02:50] bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt
[1:02:52] tree bringeth forth evil fruit and I I
[1:02:55] don't I want to change the scripture but
[1:02:56] I want to add this to you but a
[1:02:58] corrupted tree cannot bring forth good
[1:03:04] fruit
[1:03:07] period a good tree cannot bring forth
[1:03:09] evil fruit neither can a corrup tree
[1:03:11] bring forth good fruit every tree that
[1:03:13] bringeth not forth good fruit is he down
[1:03:16] and if you don't mind can I go on a rant
[1:03:19] tonight it's about time in the message
[1:03:21] we quit making
[1:03:23] excuses for those whose fruit aren't
[1:03:26] good and we start but but you just have
[1:03:29] to understand I do I want to stand
[1:03:33] boldly tonight and tell you I do
[1:03:34] understand the word says that those that
[1:03:36] are good bring forth good fruit and
[1:03:39] those that are not good bring forth
[1:03:40] corrupt or evil fruit and it's time that
[1:03:43] we quit making excuses for these kinds
[1:03:45] of Ministries and behaviors and whatever
[1:03:48] I'm not talking about being judgmental
[1:03:50] but in that realm right there when you
[1:03:52] have somebody who 15 years ago behaved
[1:03:55] that way and today here in 2024 still
[1:03:58] behave that way and haven't changed a
[1:04:01] drop and people are still making excuses
[1:04:03] for
[1:04:04] them it's time we stop that it's time
[1:04:07] that we start looking at the fruit this
[1:04:09] is not judgment my brother and sister
[1:04:11] they're actually bring their own
[1:04:13] judgment because everyone just like Cain
[1:04:16] he came and offered his fruit to The
[1:04:18] Altar and it wasn't that God was in a
[1:04:21] sense picking on Cain but God said hey
[1:04:25] look if this is this is what you have to
[1:04:26] offer you need to go back and bring
[1:04:28] something else to offer and Cain says no
[1:04:31] this is my fruit and I'm proud of it I'm
[1:04:35] not going to go change I'm not going to
[1:04:36] make another altar I'm not going to
[1:04:37] clean or sanctify my altar I'm going to
[1:04:41] take it and basically say God accept it
[1:04:44] or not this is all I'm going to give you
[1:04:47] I'm I'm here my brother and sister
[1:04:48] tonight I'm here to to be changed by the
[1:04:52] word I want our young people in a world
[1:04:55] we live in that's getting darker and
[1:04:57] darker I want them to be changed by the
[1:05:00] word I don't want them to be good little
[1:05:02] Christians good little message kids
[1:05:04] coming to a point that when they're 20
[1:05:06] years old they light the rocket and
[1:05:08] they're out of here I want by the time
[1:05:10] they're 20 years old they know I was
[1:05:12] called of God I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:05:14] this is who I am this is my identity I
[1:05:17] see myself in the word and it's alive
[1:05:21] and it's real and it's in
[1:05:24] me
[1:05:27] because there comes a time that those
[1:05:29] who don't bring forth good fruit is he
[1:05:31] down and cast in the fire whereby their
[1:05:34] FR fruits you'll know them and so as we
[1:05:37] look at
[1:05:39] this pretty strong words that we have I
[1:05:41] want to just hurry along here because
[1:05:44] not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord
[1:05:46] shall enter the kingdom and uh have we
[1:05:50] not
[1:05:52] prophesied have we not cast out devils
[1:05:56] in thy name haven't we done Mighty
[1:05:58] works and he's going to come back and
[1:06:00] say you know what I never knew you
[1:06:04] depart from
[1:06:06] me because they weren't
[1:06:10] 100% the
[1:06:12] word it's crazy to use this for an
[1:06:15] example but
[1:06:18] um I remember one time I was shopping
[1:06:20] with sister Jerry and this
[1:06:24] man was there in the aisle in the
[1:06:26] coolers with his wife older
[1:06:29] gentleman and his wife's like put that
[1:06:31] back that's not real orange
[1:06:33] juice and I I think they had a little
[1:06:36] humor going between them but it was a
[1:06:38] little hard to decide and he's
[1:06:41] like I'm not it tastes
[1:06:45] good and she's like read the label it's
[1:06:48] not real and he says I don't care if
[1:06:50] it's real it tastes good and she's like
[1:06:53] you ain't putting it in this cart and he
[1:06:55] says fine I'll go find my own cart and
[1:06:56] I'll just fill it
[1:06:59] out and she turned around looked at him
[1:07:02] I don't remember the man's name but it
[1:07:03] was like
[1:07:06] Robert you know that tone we all heard
[1:07:09] that tone our mothers used it sometimes
[1:07:11] our wife uses it even our daughters and
[1:07:14] granddaughters use
[1:07:16] it Robert he looks at her and it's
[1:07:21] like puts it back but the thing that
[1:07:24] caught my attention if he didn't care
[1:07:27] what it was it tasted
[1:07:36] good so we see
[1:07:41] here if we go for what just tastes good
[1:07:44] my brother and
[1:07:46] sister we're actually would fill this
[1:07:48] building
[1:07:49] up if we started only doing what tasted
[1:07:53] or felt good we'd fill this building up
[1:07:56] but I I I I won't even look at you so
[1:07:59] you can raise a hand if you want to but
[1:08:01] you know uh in that day you know they're
[1:08:04] going to say didn't we do all of these
[1:08:07] works and uh he's going to say unto them
[1:08:11] I never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:08:13] work in iniquity I think I would much
[1:08:17] rather hear the
[1:08:19] words well
[1:08:21] done well done my good and faithful
[1:08:24] servant
[1:08:27] and you say brother Paul where are you
[1:08:28] going with this I'm telling you we can
[1:08:30] teach our young people the path that
[1:08:33] leads them into well done we don't have
[1:08:36] to sit back and just hope that they will
[1:08:38] catch a revelation we don't have to sit
[1:08:40] back and just hope that somehow the
[1:08:42] world doesn't draw them away my brother
[1:08:45] and sister there's power in prayer
[1:08:48] there's power in prayer and if we are
[1:08:51] concerned enough to call on the Lord cry
[1:08:53] out to the Lord and seek Him diligently
[1:08:57] God will hold up his end of the equation
[1:09:00] can we say Amen to that amen
[1:09:04] hallelujah now I'm not thinking that
[1:09:06] there's anybody in our church that's
[1:09:08] going Wayward or anything like that
[1:09:10] don't misunderstand me but this is what
[1:09:11] God laid on my heart and I just have to
[1:09:14] bring it forth amen so you
[1:09:19] know he's going to tell him depart from
[1:09:22] me but he says who so hearth these
[1:09:25] sayings of mine and doeth them I will
[1:09:27] liken him to a wise man build your house
[1:09:30] upon the rock and the rain will come
[1:09:32] Troubles of life will come the winds
[1:09:34] will blow things will beat on that house
[1:09:37] and it will not fail we are God's we are
[1:09:41] Christ spiritual house amen how do we
[1:09:44] want to build this house amen I want to
[1:09:47] build this house so it stands every test
[1:09:49] that comes in my life and I think I've
[1:09:51] had tests and trials in my life until I
[1:09:54] meet other people
[1:09:56] and and when you meet them and they
[1:09:57] share their testimony you realize Lord's
[1:10:00] been really good to me I tell you just
[1:10:03] if I could make this in a natural sense
[1:10:05] I was in Home Depot and um yesterday and
[1:10:10] as I'm exiting the
[1:10:12] store I my attention is drawn to a man
[1:10:15] who is walking quite awkwardly the first
[1:10:18] thing I notice he's walking with another
[1:10:19] gentleman and the first thing I notice
[1:10:22] is he raises his hand that it has a
[1:10:24] pincher on it
[1:10:26] and I thought oh my that guy you know
[1:10:29] has lost his
[1:10:31] arm but then my tensions drawn on the
[1:10:34] other side is just U what you might say
[1:10:36] a um I don't know fake hand you realize
[1:10:42] this this man's lost both arms then my
[1:10:46] attention is drawn to his walk and it is
[1:10:49] this very much lopsided gate that it's
[1:10:54] there and I realized he has no left
[1:10:59] leg and then my attention is drawn to
[1:11:02] how he looks and stands and and I
[1:11:05] thought this this young man's been in
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:09] military what a
[1:11:12] sacrifice what a sacrifice but one thing
[1:11:16] I I noticed he was a happy
[1:11:19] man he he was there he had joy in him he
[1:11:22] wasn't there with a woe begone count
[1:11:26] and you realize Lord you've been really
[1:11:28] really good to us now if we can feel
[1:11:30] that way in the natural my brother and
[1:11:32] sister how be it that we sit here with a
[1:11:35] word of the hour that's revealed to us
[1:11:37] that is guaranteed to deliver our souls
[1:11:40] to the straight to narrow gate how much
[1:11:42] more we should be happy we say oh my
[1:11:45] troubles oh our troubles oh these
[1:11:48] troubles but we look at this and realize
[1:11:50] that it don't matter what Satan has done
[1:11:53] whether Satan's took a bite whether he's
[1:11:55] left scars whether he's done damage but
[1:11:57] we have been given the very Breath of
[1:12:00] Life and it's there that we should take
[1:12:02] that and say you know what family
[1:12:05] children everyone around me we are
[1:12:07] blessed beyond measure because God has
[1:12:11] looked upon us and we have found favor
[1:12:13] in his sight and if we take the word now
[1:12:17] I'm not glossing this over to make it
[1:12:18] Simplicity but if we take the word and
[1:12:21] believe the word and act upon the word
[1:12:24] the word tells tell us that when you
[1:12:26] believe it and you act upon it you are
[1:12:29] there as a son or a daughter of God that
[1:12:32] I've made the way before you we're not
[1:12:34] earning it we don't have to be slaves to
[1:12:37] this world we don't have to care about
[1:12:39] what the world thinks we are Sons and
[1:12:41] Daughters of
[1:12:43] God
[1:12:45] hallelujah maybe some people would think
[1:12:47] that I make a fool out of myself and I
[1:12:49] don't mind because it says the
[1:12:50] foolishness of preaching but as we were
[1:12:53] there in Canada you know the weekend
[1:12:56] there I just got right down on the floor
[1:12:59] making an example of that young woman
[1:13:01] that had been claimed by by the uh
[1:13:04] meatpacker son the Rancher's son has
[1:13:07] claimed her and she's down there on the
[1:13:09] floor she had a choice Saints she's down

[1:13:19] I'm scrubbing the floor look who I am I
[1:13:21] I I'm just he won't come back for me
[1:13:23] whoa why was I so foolish to think that
[1:13:26] he would claim me build a mansion for me
[1:13:28] come back for me what was I thinking my
[1:13:31] brother and sister instead while she's
[1:13:33] being ridiculed she's down on the floor
[1:13:35] praise God praise God he promised he's
[1:13:38] coming back he said he's coming back and
[1:13:41] he's a man of character he's a man that
[1:13:43] I can trust and I'm going to give myself
[1:13:45] to him I'm his already he's coming for
[1:13:49] me we can make that decision which way
[1:13:52] we want that relationship to be I want
[1:13:54] to be the Overcomer Lord help me I want
[1:13:57] to be the one that stands up in the
[1:13:59] worst of situations and say God's got my
[1:14:02] back amen he's covering it amen he knows
[1:14:06] who I am he knows my weakness and he's
[1:14:09] going to take me
[1:14:11] anyhow oh
[1:14:13] hallelujah amen cuz my
[1:14:16] house Lord help us my house was not
[1:14:19] built to fall
[1:14:21] down amen every generation wants a Brad
[1:14:25] Avenue to
[1:14:27] Christ look at church life look at the
[1:14:30] world we live in every generation wants
[1:14:33] a broader

[1:14:39] much broader than it is now be honest
[1:14:41] with
[1:14:44] you there's a preacher that I come
[1:14:47] across a deal about
[1:14:50] him a
[1:14:52] man divorced one weekend acknowledg in
[1:14:55] his church married the next weekend

[1:14:58] pastor how much would you give for a
[1:15:00] pastor like
[1:15:02] that I would hope not
[1:15:06] much but the people
[1:15:09] stood and applauded him as he introduced
[1:15:12] the new
[1:15:15] Ms
[1:15:22] H Hebrews chapter 6
[1:15:39] brother Brown says here paragraph

[1:15:53] willing tonight by the word do you love
[1:15:55] it oh Thy Thy word is a lamp unto my
[1:15:59] path and feet oh now you say brother
[1:16:01] brandom I I don't understand it at all
[1:16:03] see I love this this makes me feel good
[1:16:05] as a preacher I don't understand this at
[1:16:08] all brother Brown neither do
[1:16:10] I sometimes that kind of helps you where
[1:16:13] you you just kind of come to a point
[1:16:15] you're like Lord I I I'm I don't know
[1:16:18] where we go from here I I don't quite
[1:16:20] put these pieces
[1:16:22] together um but one time I was preaching
[1:16:25] down in Kentucky is this all right this
[1:16:27] is going to be just a little story but
[1:16:29] there's a nice little point in there and
[1:16:32] one time I was preaching down in
[1:16:33] Kentucky some of the newcomers and
[1:16:35] Catholic and different ones uh may not
[1:16:38] understand how these deep rich things of
[1:16:40] the scripture I'd been preaching on
[1:16:42] Divine Healing a little barefooted this
[1:16:44] was might shock some of you a little
[1:16:47] barefooted girl brought she wasn't 15
[1:16:49] years old had a little baby and it was
[1:16:52] had the py and I said what the matter
[1:16:54] sister with your baby and said it's got
[1:16:58] the jerks she didn't know what to say py
[1:17:01] she didn't know what to call it little
[1:17:04] thing probably never had a pair of shoes
[1:17:05] on in her life and some man's darling
[1:17:08] long hair hanging down and I said Do you
[1:17:10] believe and them little steel gray eyes
[1:17:13] looked at me and she said yeah sir I
[1:17:16] sure believe and I took the little baby
[1:17:19] and while I was praying for it it quit
[1:17:20] jerking uh-huh and I went out it went
[1:17:23] out and next day I was squirrel hunting
[1:17:25] over on the side of a mountain and I
[1:17:27] heard some men sitting there talking uh
[1:17:30] old saw buzzing and I slipped down and
[1:17:33] been squirrel hunting and they was
[1:17:35] talking about me I'd SLI down there too
[1:17:38] what do they got to say is it good or
[1:17:40] bad yeah don't tell me you wouldn't
[1:17:43] either yeah yeah I think every one of us
[1:17:46] had slipped down there and uh sitting
[1:17:49] there chewing tobacco spitting the
[1:17:52] leaves flying like that and they were
[1:17:53] talking about now about the meeting the
[1:17:55] night before and one of them said I've
[1:17:57] seen that baby imagine the language that
[1:17:59] would be there brother Brown's using I I
[1:18:01] can't even imitate it but it would just
[1:18:03] be that that uh you know that South I
[1:18:06] seen that baby I went by there this
[1:18:09] morning it isn't jerking yet this
[1:18:12] morning see he said that was real and he
[1:18:15] was
[1:18:18] spitting now I hope this doesn't come as
[1:18:20] too much of a
[1:18:21] shock but there was a time in school my
[1:18:24] parents ever figured it out in fact no
[1:18:26] one in my family figured it out but
[1:18:27] there was a time I chewed
[1:18:29] tobacco and I did my best to to hide
[1:18:32] that from my
[1:18:33] family and while you know it's eating
[1:18:35] your teeth and your gums and everything
[1:18:37] else it's just hard to
[1:18:41] stop I don't know why must be a spirit
[1:18:45] attached to it probably not the Holy
[1:18:51] Spirit they had rifles leaning against a
[1:18:54] tree so I thought I'd better make myself
[1:18:55] known you know they have feuds down
[1:18:58] there so I walked up and said good
[1:19:00] morning Brethren and that great big
[1:19:03] fellow seemed to be speaking he had a
[1:19:05] chew of tobacco in his mouth like that
[1:19:08] way out in the side like that if you
[1:19:10] know what that means that means his
[1:19:11] cheek was bulged out there he had him a
[1:19:14] great big cut is what he had and like
[1:19:17] that big long neck and and he had a
[1:19:19] great big old hat on pulled down over
[1:19:21] his face and he looked around and seen
[1:19:23] me he reached up and go that hat jerked
[1:19:26] it off went brother brandom swallows and
[1:19:28] swallowed that Chew
[1:19:32] Tobacco I hope none of you have ever
[1:19:34] chewed
[1:19:35] tobacco but I tell you what it takes a
[1:19:38] cast iron stomach to swallow that old
[1:19:41] chew tobacco and not just turn green
[1:19:44] like a fish and can I say it in public
[1:19:49] puke and this old boy brother Brown says
[1:19:52] he just swallowed that chewed tobacco
[1:19:55] and said good morning
[1:19:57] Parson see yes sir sir respect that's
[1:20:01] right how he ever lived over it I don't
[1:20:04] know but he
[1:20:06] did maybe he turned green right there in
[1:20:09] front of brother brown but I'm telling
[1:20:11] you some of that stuff is
[1:20:13] vicious
[1:20:16] amen so the next night coming back there
[1:20:18] was a man there who wanted to argue with
[1:20:20] me a little bit he went to a church that
[1:20:23] didn't believe in Divine heal so this
[1:20:25] was a Methodist Church White Hill
[1:20:27] Kentucky and he said I was standing
[1:20:30] outside and he had Lantern in his hand
[1:20:31] he said I want to say something preacher
[1:20:33] I just can't accept that cuz I can't see
[1:20:36] it I said you can't see it he said no
[1:20:40] I'm a sick man myself but I just can't
[1:20:42] see it I said where do you live he said
[1:20:45] back over there on the big renox and I
[1:20:48] said well how are you going to get home
[1:20:51] he said well I'm going to walk home and
[1:20:53] I said can you see your home and he said
[1:20:55] no sir awful dark tonight it's cloudy he
[1:20:58] saides and I said how you going home and
[1:21:00] he said byy this Lantern I said the
[1:21:02] lantern doesn't show light all the way
[1:21:04] to the house said how do you go he said
[1:21:08] oh I walk by the
[1:21:10] Lantern and I said that's it you got to
[1:21:12] walk by the Light of the lantern now and
[1:21:15] every time you step this way the light
[1:21:18] will keep showing on ahead of you if you
[1:21:20] just keep walking the light will keep
[1:21:23] going with you am
[1:21:26] hallelujah amen we need to teach this to
[1:21:28] our young people it's not about how dark
[1:21:31] it is out here or how rough the trail is
[1:21:34] if the lantern is lit walk by the Light
[1:21:38] if you know that Christ is a lord and
[1:21:41] savior A Healer a redeemer our
[1:21:43] bridegroom don't try to figure it all
[1:21:46] out just walk with the light of the
[1:21:48] lantern of the word for our
[1:21:51] hour we don't need to get complicated
[1:21:53] and make our kid kids understand the
[1:21:55] seals at 12 years old or the church ages
[1:21:58] at 12 years old what they got to
[1:22:00] understand is Christ is there
[1:22:02] Illuminating their path of life before
[1:22:05] them and if they'll just walk in it
[1:22:07] he'll Shine the Light for them but we
[1:22:10] get it all complicated I'm sorry I don't
[1:22:13] want this to offend nobody but we start
[1:22:15] lecturing because sometimes it's easy
[1:22:18] for an intellectual to lecture what it
[1:22:21] should be but what we need is some
[1:22:23] family some friends a church a pastor
[1:22:27] that is going to live this gospel and
[1:22:29] let the light shine and cumulative we'll
[1:22:32] bring our lick of fire and have a
[1:22:34] bonfire in this church amen we won't
[1:22:36] have to have some cold formal
[1:22:39] religion homework about birthdays and
[1:22:43] what day of the week was it when this
[1:22:45] squirrel was shot come on I know
[1:22:47] churches that teach that to the young
[1:22:49] people as though that's going to get
[1:22:51] them in a Rapture I'll tell you what
[1:22:53] gets them in a rapture
[1:22:54] knowing Jesus Christ and being filled
[1:22:57] with the Holy Ghost that's what gets our
[1:22:59] children gets our families gets the
[1:23:01] preacher in the Rapture is being filled
[1:23:04] with the Holy Ghost and knowing Christ
[1:23:06] on a personal basis
[1:23:09] hallelujah
[1:23:11] hallelujah I should have never said a
[1:23:13] thing about getting out
[1:23:15] early amen aren't you glad you got a
[1:23:18] lantern oh thank you Lord we got a
[1:23:21] lantern oh praise the Lord you know what
[1:23:24] I I I want to I want to keep this if I
[1:23:26] launch into this next portion you guys
[1:23:28] will be looking at the clock saying um
[1:23:30] it's early for tomorrow brother
[1:23:33] Paul I'll just put it this
[1:23:36] way
[1:23:38] illumination brings
[1:23:41] Revelation Every Little Rock on that
[1:23:43] trail was illuminated by that Lantern
[1:23:46] and every little demon that would try to
[1:23:49] keep you and I out of the Rapture we'll
[1:23:52] be illuminated by the word of of God be
[1:23:56] Shone right on those Devils exposed and
[1:23:59] they will
[1:24:01] flee whatever you do young people don't
[1:24:04] become good at hiding hiding hiding
[1:24:10] hiding your failures amen get
[1:24:14] good at confessing and exposing your
[1:24:19] failures if it mattered within this
[1:24:22] church on those terms I would say
[1:24:24] say
[1:24:26] Church let's have Grace for one
[1:24:29] another when our failure is
[1:24:32] exposed don't turn it into conversation
[1:24:35] turn it into
[1:24:37] prayer there should not be one in our
[1:24:39] body that we would say well I don't know
[1:24:42] what's happening with them and I'm just
[1:24:44] going to step away from this I don't
[1:24:45] know I don't
[1:24:47] know I'm telling you my brother and
[1:24:49] sister it's time just as I said it's
[1:24:52] time for us to quit giving EXC excuses
[1:24:54] to those people that keep presenting
[1:24:57] this message distorted it is also time
[1:25:00] for us to quit offering excuse for why
[1:25:04] we're not digging in and feeding on it
[1:25:07] and seeing the fruit be raised up amen
[1:25:14] hallelujah I got quite a bit more here
[1:25:16] but this will be
[1:25:22] good sister via if you would come please
[1:25:26] all our
[1:25:39] musicians hope it didn't sound like I
[1:25:41] was railing or preaching to any one
[1:25:44] person or
[1:25:45] thought but it just strikes me deep in
[1:25:48] my
[1:25:50] heart Lord It's time for Paul
[1:25:55] to quit making
[1:25:58] excuses it's time for Grace
[1:26:01] Tabernacle to quit offering up any kind
[1:26:04] of
[1:26:05] excuse It's time for us to teach our
[1:26:08] children grandchildren how to be
[1:26:11] Warriors in this
[1:26:13] gospel how it will come the
[1:26:18] day if you don't mind this is a little
[1:26:20] cutting maybe a little
[1:26:23] criticism
[1:26:24] I knew some brothers back east and as
[1:26:27] the young people in their Church come
[1:26:31] up went off to college every one of
[1:26:35] those young people Everyone back
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:44] Sid and the brothers in their church had
[1:26:47] a meeting where all the men sat
[1:26:49] down and they said we have a real
[1:26:53] issue our children are not surviving out
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:26:57] there and this sounds a little harsh and
[1:27:00] I I don't mean it to be harsh on this
[1:27:01] brother this
[1:27:03] man but one brother piped up and said
[1:27:05] well I have an easy
[1:27:06] solution they're all looking for an
[1:27:08] answer what is it let's just not send
[1:27:11] them to
[1:27:13] college sounded good didn't
[1:27:17] it but then finally there was one little
[1:27:23] girl 18 19 years old daddy I'm going to
[1:27:26] go to college oh honey education's of
[1:27:29] the devil got a quot for
[1:27:33] it this little girl looked at her Daddy
[1:27:36] in the face and said Daddy is that
[1:27:37] really the
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:39] answer and the man broke down in tears
[1:27:43] said no it's not an answer honey it's an
[1:27:47] excuse that little girl by the grace of
[1:27:49] God went to the
[1:27:52] university converted two other little
[1:27:54] girls to the message brought them back
[1:27:56] to
[1:27:58] church what God did was use a little
[1:28:01] girl for a job the ministry should have
[1:28:05] done Lord help
[1:28:08] us because you see we don't need to
[1:28:11] hide we don't need a back door to life
[1:28:13] to keep our children from falling we
[1:28:16] need to get the front door wide open for
[1:28:19] them to invite Christ and when he moves
[1:28:22] in and their scriptural the foundation
[1:28:24] for that right when the house is cleaned
[1:28:26] and not
[1:28:28] occupied our our young people they they
[1:28:30] they're clean as they're going to be as
[1:28:32] clean being in church raised in church
[1:28:34] they're going to be as clean as any
[1:28:35] young people on the face of the Earth
[1:28:37] but if the house is not
[1:28:39] occupied what we need is just get the
[1:28:41] house occupied then they can go and it
[1:28:44] will be that they can go anywhere that
[1:28:46] God would send them and God's not going
[1:28:48] to send them to The Honky Tonks and the
[1:28:50] back alleys and the trash God's going to
[1:28:52] send them there but if they're going to
[1:28:53] go to college go to college with the
[1:28:55] Holy Ghost they'll come out of college
[1:28:56] with the Holy Ghost amen and you send
[1:28:59] them wherever that might be they'll be
[1:29:01] able to live in that environment and we
[1:29:04] won't have to offer an excuse to ourself
[1:29:07] of how to do this now I know what the
[1:29:10] prophet of God said about education so
[1:29:13] don't think I'm just blindly stomping
[1:29:15] along here but I'm telling you my
[1:29:16] brother and sister in the world we live
[1:29:19] in today so many people offer an excuse
[1:29:22] they kept their kids from even going on
[1:29:24] to uh intermediate or whatever you call
[1:29:26] it education because they were afraid
[1:29:28] what would
[1:29:29] happen but then you got families they
[1:29:32] send their kids out there boldly and
[1:29:35] people I've been there I've heard the
[1:29:37] conversations telling them they're
[1:29:40] foolish but I tell you what when a daddy
[1:29:42] knows and a mama knows that their son or
[1:29:45] their daughter's got the Holy Ghost
[1:29:48] You're Not Afraid this scripture says
[1:29:50] what can separate us from the love of
[1:29:53] God
[1:29:54] not Peril not sword not nothing my
[1:29:57] brother and sister we need to do our job
[1:30:00] God help us and if I have failed this
[1:30:02] church or these families Lord forgive me
[1:30:05] but we need to get the word not just
[1:30:08] indoctrinated into them but the very
[1:30:10] life if we could it would be that we
[1:30:12] would take that flame and we would go
[1:30:14] put it into their life but we can't so
[1:30:17] the next best thing we can do is show
[1:30:19] that Christ is real that we can show in
[1:30:22] this church that God's Alive not a bunch
[1:30:24] of old sad frowny people that are just
[1:30:27] waiting for church to get over to go
[1:30:29] home and play our whatever or do
[1:30:31] whatever my brother and sister but to
[1:30:33] have a church that's filled with the
[1:30:35] Holy Ghost and I believe we are I
[1:30:37] believe we are I'm not preaching tonight
[1:30:38] like you guys straighten up we we're no
[1:30:41] but it's something we need to make it
[1:30:43] real to the Next Generation
