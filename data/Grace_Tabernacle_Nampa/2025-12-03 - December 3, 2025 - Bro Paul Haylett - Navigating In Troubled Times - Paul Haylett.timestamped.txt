[3:20] here in this day. Uh just a couple
[3:22] little encounters this week where you're
[3:24] a little bit marveled that you know
[3:26] people make an identity and say you know
[3:28] I believe the Bible therefore I'm a
[3:31] Christian and and no recognition that it
[3:34] goes much deeper and no desire for it to
[3:37] go much deeper. And so you see that God
[3:40] is working and and uh and the vision of
[3:44] all is become unto you as the words of a
[3:46] book that is sealed. And I when I read
[3:49] this scripture, it struck me that here
[3:51] we are in this day in this age and the
[3:54] seventh seals being sealed up. And it
[3:57] was there that God said, you know,
[3:59] before this is finished, I will unwrap
[4:02] or reveal the seals. And many people
[4:05] still today uh would say that the seals
[4:08] are not open. But my brother and sister,
[4:10] this scripture clearly shows us if the
[4:13] seals are not open, we're blind. Amen.
[4:16] And God never called us to be a blind
[4:18] people. Amen. Stumbling along, stumbling
[4:21] through life, not sure what God wants,
[4:23] what sure God desires, what we're
[4:25] supposed to do. But the seal has been
[4:28] taken off. And so it's there. We are not
[4:32] here any longer. Amen. This thing's
[4:35] about to land in a trash can. Um, we're
[4:38] not here any longer to say when this is
[4:41] revealed, we can move forward. But you
[4:44] see, God's already revealed it. Now,
[4:46] there's many things that that I have to
[4:48] admit myself. I'm not sure that I have a
[4:50] full understanding of what it is, but I
[4:52] can't sit here and say because I do not
[4:54] understand it that it's not open. Amen.
[4:57] God is revealing himself, opening the
[4:59] word to us. Slow but sure it's taking
[5:02] place. Amen. And so there's one that
[5:04] says, "I I I cannot, for it is sealed."
[5:08] And there's it's delivered to one that
[5:10] is not learned, saying, "Read this, I
[5:12] pray thee." And he said, "I'm not
[5:14] learned." So both have an excuse for not
[5:17] diving into the word of God and taking
[5:20] hold of that word to move forward and
[5:22] have greater revelation. And that
[5:24] certainly is a reflection of the world
[5:26] we live in today that many people they
[5:29] come along to to certain things in their
[5:31] life, certain things of the word. And
[5:33] unless they just readily see it, they
[5:35] just put it on a shelf and and uh don't
[5:38] even want to really deal with it. And uh
[5:41] God wants us to deal with it, right? The
[5:43] prophet says, "Pray for revelation."
[5:45] Amen. That's a very valuable tool just
[5:47] to pray for revelation. It doesn't
[5:49] require some great mighty thunder and
[5:52] lightning and whatever happening. God's
[5:54] going to give you revelation when you
[5:56] pray for it in the right season. And so
[5:58] it's there that uh one can say I'm not
[6:01] learned. Now there are many many wise
[6:03] people around the message of the hour.
[6:06] But God brought it down in such
[6:07] simplicity that folks such as myself
[6:10] could come along and grasp the very
[6:12] meaning of the word and be able to move
[6:14] into that and live in that promise.
[6:17] Amen. So therefore we see that uh verse
[6:20] 13 very relevant of the day that we live
[6:23] in says wherefore the Lord said for as
[6:25] much as this people draw near to me with
[6:28] their mouth and with their lips do honor
[6:30] me but have removed their heart far from
[6:33] me and their fear toward me is taught by
[6:36] the precept of men. Now you look at that
[6:39] and realize how that me many people
[6:42] Amen. It would be us except for the
[6:44] grace of God. Many people uh uh they say
[6:47] I'm a Christian but at the same moment
[6:50] will will speak of things that a
[6:52] Christian should not speak of. Amen.
[6:53] They participate in things a Christian
[6:56] should not participate in. And it's
[6:58] there that by their words they can say
[7:00] I'm a Christian. And um then they dare
[7:03] anyone to uh contradict that actually
[7:05] with very aggressive behaviors. And so
[7:08] you look at that and you see now uh it's
[7:11] it's a very beautiful thing as we come
[7:14] in this. So we see that people can draw
[7:17] near with their mouth. If they're just
[7:18] drawing near with their mouth, there's
[7:20] got to be a people who are drawing near
[7:22] in another fashion. That's right.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. In another way, they're drawing
[7:25] near. They're saying, "You know what,
[7:27] Lord? I I want to be with you. I want to
[7:29] be." We sang tonight. Amen. Lord, I need
[7:31] you. I want you. I want to serve you.
[7:34] And And that's not just with their
[7:36] mouth. Amen. So they remove their heart
[7:39] and their fear is taught by the precept
[7:42] of man. So there they they the church
[7:44] comes along and says this is what God
[7:46] means and uh this is what you should be
[7:48] reverent to. This is what it is. And uh
[7:52] and I won't go into that tonight because
[7:54] it kind of goes into another branch. But
[7:56] you know uh touch not God's anointed is
[7:59] another way of teaching fear to the
[8:00] people where the ministry would stand
[8:03] here and say don't question me. Don't
[8:05] don't uh ask a question. Don't question
[8:08] me. Don't do this because I'm God's
[8:10] anointed. See, they're putting another
[8:12] kind of fear into the people. It's not
[8:14] God's fear. And when we put the fear of
[8:17] God into the life of a son or daughter
[8:19] of God, it's a reverence. We reverence
[8:22] God. We we come to him and we give him
[8:26] uh praise and glory and honor for who he
[8:29] is. And we know by scripture that when
[8:32] we praise the Lord, he blesses us. Amen.
[8:35] You want to be blessed, just open your
[8:37] mouth and be praising the Lord. Amen.
[8:39] Not empty words, but just be speaking
[8:42] from your heart. Amen. So, we don't want
[8:45] to be taught by a precept of men. Amen.
[8:48] So, um
[8:51] we look at this.
[8:54] Woe unto them, verse 15, that seek deep
[8:57] to hide their counsel from the Lord.
[9:00] Now, why would any Christian
[9:03] has a relationship with the Lord, seek
[9:06] to hide their counsel from the Lord?
[9:10] This sounds more like out of the Old
[9:12] Testament, those men that would come and
[9:15] they would be false prophets. They would
[9:18] be their balums, you might say, of the
[9:20] scripture. and and uh they wanted to
[9:24] misguide the people. That was their
[9:25] intent. But they didn't want it to be
[9:28] revealed that they literally were
[9:30] outside of the word. They wanted to stay
[9:32] as though they were real prophets, real
[9:35] men of God. But you know, um God won't
[9:39] let that rest. He won't let that go. And
[9:42] so their works are in the dark and they
[9:45] say, "Who seeth us and who knoweth us?
[9:47] Surely your turning of things upside
[9:50] down shall be esteemed as potter's clay.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Look at that, my brother and sister.
[9:57] Imagine. Have any of you ever done
[9:59] pottery? You know, it's there. You're
[10:02] you're doing that and the pressure in
[10:04] the right place, the right amount of
[10:06] moisture, the right, you know, and next
[10:08] thing you know, you have a beautiful
[10:10] vase or in my case just a vase. But you
[10:15] look at this and see uh how can that
[10:18] potter's clay say, hm,
[10:22] why did you make me this way?
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Why did you do this? And how it would be
[10:27] that we as Christians uh would sit here
[10:30] today now we have challenges in our
[10:33] lives. We have things we bump up. I was
[10:36] visiting with a young man today, talking
[10:38] to him about the word of God, about the
[10:40] message of the hour. And um you know,
[10:44] you come to realize how Satan so
[10:46] cleverly makes a young man or young
[10:49] woman feel like they can never attain to
[10:53] that point.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; No. So Satan's trying to talk to them,
[10:56] trying to tell them. Uh and then on the
[10:58] other side, in behavior that's not
[11:01] acceptable by the word, God understands.
[11:04] So God doesn't understand on this side.
[11:06] He understands on this side. Amen. So
[11:08] it's there in that realm. We'll see. And
[11:11] so you know what? We're at this point
[11:14] right here. We're not here to question
[11:16] what God's done in our life, how he's
[11:18] brought us, the path he brought us, the
[11:19] struggles that we go through. But what
[11:21] we are here is to claim the victory over
[11:25] every circumstance. To claim the victory
[11:27] in that battle, in that challenge. Amen.
[11:30] And so you know it's here he shall say
[11:33] of him that made it he made me not. Or
[11:36] shall the thing framed of him that
[11:39] framed it he had no understanding. How
[11:42] many times saints maybe maybe not you
[11:46] but how many times we've said something
[11:48] to the Lord on the order of Lord you
[11:50] don't understand.
[11:53] My
[11:55] imagine we could say something like that
[11:58] and actually believe he doesn't
[12:01] understand. He made us.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows our every fiber, every
[12:07] being. And then we're going to tell him,
[12:09] "You made me wrong. You know, you should
[12:12] have made me." Well, who wouldn't say
[12:14] that? Just make me, you know, like this
[12:17] saint over here. Amen. If you're
[12:19] Catholic, you'd say, "Make me like
[12:20] Mother Teresa." You know, we'll probably
[12:23] find out one day. Mother Teresa had a
[12:25] lot more problems than anybody guessed.
[12:28] And so, uh, what what are we going to
[12:30] do? The God that framed us hath no
[12:33] understanding. No, I think he knows our
[12:36] every footstep. Amen. The every bat of
[12:39] our eyelash. Amen. The bat of even the
[12:43] flea, he knows what happened there.
[12:45] Amen. So, what Satan's trying to do is
[12:47] get us to a place we doubt ourself. And
[12:50] when that is a strong enough form, we
[12:52] actually start doubting God. Amen.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; And
[13:03] so we look at this. See the vision as it
[13:06] says in the scripture there, the vision
[13:09] is covered over and the book is sealed
[13:11] to many people. Now my brother and
[13:14] sister don't don't be negative on people
[13:16] that say the book is the book is uh the
[13:18] seventh seal is not open uh because they
[13:21] are living at the level of understanding
[13:23] that they have and because their
[13:26] understanding will only take them so
[13:28] far. Uh that's all the farther they can
[13:31] go. They can't force themselves into
[13:33] revelation. So the vision is covered
[13:35] over and the book is sealed to many
[13:37] people in the world today. I I I've
[13:40] recently have went online and just
[13:42] searched through different things and
[13:44] and uh you know, you just realize how
[13:47] many people that that is a great mystery
[13:48] to. They don't have one bit of
[13:50] understanding. But by God's grace, we
[13:53] see.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's something we ought to thank
[13:56] the Lord for. But Lord, by your grace,
[13:59] we can see this.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the position of those to whom
[14:05] it is sealed, they stand there and say,
[14:07] "I cannot see it
[14:09] &gt;&gt; and I cannot read it. The book is
[14:11] closed.
[14:13] There's no revelation there."
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Now that might have been you and I uh
[14:17] years ago
[14:18] &gt;&gt; and it might be even some of our young
[14:20] people a stage of their life that you
[14:22] say, "I don't understand this." But the
[14:24] prophet of God said, "Pray for that
[14:26] revelation to come to you. Don't just
[14:28] sit back and do nothing. just sitting
[14:30] waiting for God to give it but actually
[14:33] pray Lord let me see what your word has
[14:36] for me today and when we would take that
[14:39] position that we are praying to have the
[14:41] word revealed to us God will speak to us
[14:44] amen I don't mean to get caught up into
[14:47] accounts that I have been but I've had
[14:49] people young people come to me and say I
[14:51] I just I don't know I just don't see it
[14:54] I don't see how it can be I I'm I'm
[14:56] probably going to turn away from it and
[14:58] and you ask Have you prayed for
[15:00] revelation?
[15:02] &gt;&gt; No.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; So that is an important factor that
[15:06] every one of us here tonight should be
[15:08] praying for revelation. That's what the
[15:10] prophet of God said. Pray for
[15:12] revelation. It doesn't mean in our
[15:14] carnal flesh here that we're
[15:16] automatically going to see it. These are
[15:18] things. Amen. You can't even say Jesus
[15:20] is the Christ without the anointing of
[15:22] the Holy Ghost. So how would we see the
[15:25] revelation of the word without the
[15:27] anointing of the Holy Ghost? And so it's
[15:29] there that we should be praying for that
[15:31] and then be expecting God to answer that
[15:34] prayer that we would hear that. Amen. So
[15:38] it's it's something you know when we see
[15:40] this just taking this back out of the
[15:42] scripture a little bit the position of
[15:44] those to whom it is sealed. They they
[15:47] say the book is sealed. I can't see
[15:49] that. Amen. And they cannot read it. See
[15:52] the book is a closed book to them. And
[15:54] there's a good possibility that book
[15:56] will remain closed to them because God
[15:58] never promised revelation to everyone.
[16:00] That's right.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll say this kind of
[16:02] straight. Somebody people come to
[16:04] brother Brandham and said, "Brother
[16:05] Brandom, will all of our children, we
[16:07] believe, will all of our children be
[16:09] saved?" And brother Brandham doesn't run
[16:11] them around the bush. He just tells
[16:12] them, "Your children will be saved if
[16:15] their name is on the Lamb's book of
[16:16] life." Amen. So it's not some vague
[16:19] empty promise that somebody chases
[16:22] forever. and revelation of the word is
[16:24] not some vague empty promise that we
[16:27] just chase. We need to have a
[16:28] confidence. Lord, you said that you
[16:30] would reveal yourself to your bride in
[16:33] this day and I've already identified I
[16:35] am the bride and so I believe revelation
[16:38] is going to come to me and I'm going to
[16:41] be patient and wait for it right here.
[16:44] Amen. So many people believing they have
[16:47] a revelation.
[16:49] Amen.
[16:51] And
[16:53] they just confuse people.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's interesting. I'll speak
[16:59] sufficiently vague here. We were in
[17:02] Europe
[17:03] and there was an individual said, "I
[17:06] don't want to know anything. I don't
[17:07] want to hear anything. I don't want to
[17:09] see this. It just bothers me." And uh
[17:13] and it was about the thunders. And I
[17:15] just felt
[17:18] pressed to push
[17:30] against that and to talk to her because
[17:33] you see the thunders in scripture
[17:36] are not there
[17:38] to confuse the bride of Christ.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; No, not at all. The thunders are there
[17:45] &gt;&gt; to encourage, to strengthen,
[17:48] give direction
[17:52] to the bride of Christ.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to help her along in her
[17:56] journey.
[17:58] If it's flashing, does that mean the
[17:59] battery's low or something? No. Now it's
[18:02] red. Now it's green. Now it's red.
[18:08] Lord, give me a revelation of this
[18:09] thing.
[18:11] Okay, there we go. So, you see all of
[18:14] these promises in scripture, they're not
[18:16] there to confuse us and us to run hide
[18:19] from them. They are there to shine light
[18:22] in a portion of our lives that we can
[18:25] come and see absolutely who we are in
[18:28] Jesus Christ for us to see the greater
[18:31] portion of the revelation that has been
[18:33] poured into us. And we'll look at this
[18:36] now as it is the thunders doctrine. It's
[18:38] out there. you young people will
[18:40] encounter at some point in your life.
[18:42] Amen. The thunderous doctrine in
[18:44] scripture has nothing to do with raising
[18:46] up a great man unless that great man is
[18:49] Jesus Christ. Amen. God will use any
[18:52] voice that he wants to use. He'll use
[18:54] your voice. Amen. He'll use Well, I was
[18:58] texting with a brother and I I text him
[19:02] back and I said, "Well, you know, God
[19:04] used a donkey." And he he texts me back.
[19:07] I know his humor. He says, "Doesn't that
[19:10] make you feel good?"
[19:12] So, you know, it's there. God can use a
[19:14] donkey, my brother and sister. We can't
[19:16] be lifted up in our own thinking. God
[19:19] will use whatever he needs to convey his
[19:22] message. And in the hour we live in,
[19:25] young people. He chose to use you. He
[19:27] wants you to be a witness, a testimony
[19:30] in the in the neighborhood or in the
[19:32] store or wherever it might be. He wants
[19:35] you to do that. He's not there to keep
[19:37] you baffled of why why why. But it is to
[19:41] become something so real that you are a
[19:43] living testimony. Not the clay saying
[19:46] why did you make me thus but the clay to
[19:48] stand there and say thank you Lord you
[19:51] made me thus because there's purpose.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's there. Now look our fear.
[20:00] Let me back up just a little bit.
[20:04] If you don't have revelation which
[20:06] understanding of the word and you
[20:09] believe you do, you are headed down a
[20:12] path that will lead to confusion. Amen.
[20:15] And so God wants us to take a hold of
[20:18] every word of God and we want God to
[20:21] give us uh wisdom to put it in its
[20:23] correct position. Amen. And as I said
[20:26] already uh I I would ask it now as a
[20:29] question. Has your fear or reverence
[20:32] been taught to you by a man or by the
[20:35] word?
[20:36] &gt;&gt; So if it's been taught to you a man, I
[20:38] just encourage you, whatever it would
[20:39] be, go back and let the Lord teach you
[20:43] what real reverence to the word is.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; And to keep that simple, the real
[20:49] reverence to the word is you submitting
[20:52] and saying amen to every word of God.
[20:55] There's a reverence. Amen. But you see,
[20:58] God didn't put that there for you to go
[21:00] in confusion and and just all the days
[21:03] of your life shy away from something
[21:05] that was meant to be a revelation to
[21:07] you, meant to give you strength, wisdom,
[21:10] amen, rapturing faith, all of these
[21:12] things. But when man gets in there and
[21:15] he puts a lot of woo stuff around this,
[21:18] people shy away from it. But what they
[21:20] do is they always go back to that man
[21:22] because he has the revelation.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; But God wants you to have the
[21:25] revelation. God's not wanting the
[21:27] pastor, the preacher, whatever, just to
[21:29] be the one with the revelation. He wants
[21:31] you
[21:32] &gt;&gt; to have that revelation. Amen. So, it's
[21:35] there. We We need to make sure that our
[21:37] reverence to the word has been taught to
[21:40] us by the Holy Ghost. Now, men
[21:42] preaching, teaching in the church will
[21:45] give guidance, but that real deep
[21:47] reverence that would take you into the
[21:49] holiest of holies can only come from
[21:52] Jesus Christ himself.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:55] Now, we're looking at this scripture and
[21:58] we're realizing the carnal man is
[21:59] confused. He says, "Um, I don't
[22:03] understand it. I I can't do this."
[22:07] He's confused. The carnal man, if we're
[22:09] not careful, we will sit here, even in
[22:12] this church, under a carnal influence,
[22:16] and when we don't get it, don't see it,
[22:18] we just don't touch it again.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; That's it. And God wants us to actually
[22:22] get out of this flesh, get into him,
[22:26] come into his presence, let his Holy
[22:28] Spirit move down through us. And when we
[22:31] get in that position, God says, "I want
[22:33] you really, really, really to see who I
[22:35] am. So, I'm going to come to you and I'm
[22:38] going to reveal myself to you. The
[22:40] preacher maybe already has this
[22:41] revelation, but I want you to have this
[22:44] revelation for you to see who you are."
[22:47] Amen. And that's one of the issues that
[22:49] we see so much in schools today. Young
[22:51] people around the world, Belgium,
[22:53] Netherlands, Amen, Germany, uh, South
[22:56] America, they go to school and a young
[22:58] person doesn't really know who they are.
[23:00] And they get in this school and somebody
[23:02] starts, you know, kind of calling them
[23:04] names like, "You're a holy roller,
[23:05] you're a this, you're a that, you belong
[23:07] to a cult." I was just talking to a
[23:09] young person here just a few days ago
[23:11] and it was there in that case in that
[23:13] time that you know they come and
[23:16] somebody told them you're in a cult. My
[23:19] brother and sister, you see, you need to
[23:21] be prepared for that. I you don't have
[23:23] to be 20, 25 years old. Amen. Young
[23:26] sisters, amen, that are here tonight,
[23:28] you can be prepared for that. Amen.
[23:31] You're not a cult. You are the word of
[23:34] God expressed in this hour. Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by accident. Not sitting here
[23:40] saying, "Lord, why did you make me
[23:42] thus?" But being able to rejoice that
[23:45] God made you a daughter of God. And when
[23:48] he made you a daughter of God, you've
[23:50] got every element. Brother Bram said,
[23:52] it's like you take and dip that in the
[23:54] ocean. You've got every element that's
[23:57] in the ocean is in you. And when the
[23:59] Holy Ghost comes down and touches your
[24:00] life, you've got every element of that
[24:02] Holy Ghost. Does that mean we have
[24:04] complete maturity? No. Time is what
[24:07] creates or makes complete maturity. The
[24:10] testing. Amen. So the carnal man gets
[24:14] confused. The spiritual man says, "Hey,
[24:16] this is a time for us to start on a new
[24:17] journey. God's taking us a new place."
[24:20] Now, in 2 Corinthians
[24:23] 4, I don't know that we need to read all
[24:26] of those verses, but uh therefore,
[24:28] seeing we have this ministry as we have
[24:30] received mercy, we faint not, but have
[24:33] renounced the hidden things of
[24:34] dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
[24:37] nor handling the word of God
[24:38] deceitfully, but by manifestation of the
[24:41] truth, commending ourselves to every
[24:44] man's conscience in the sight of God.
[24:47] But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to
[24:51] them that are lost.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; And so we don't really need to go on.
[24:55] It's just reassurance here. Verse seven,
[24:57] we have this treasure in earthn vessel.
[24:59] That's our bodies. Amen. The excellency
[25:01] of the power be of God and not us. My
[25:05] anytime somebody stands up and and uh
[25:08] just was in a conversation here a few
[25:10] days ago and and an individual would
[25:12] preach something and then they would be
[25:14] telling others about that service and
[25:16] say, "I preached this phenomenal
[25:20] sermon."
[25:21] My brother and sister, they didn't do no
[25:23] such.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; If they are a son of God, they didn't
[25:28] preach a phenomenal sermon.
[25:30] They got far enough out of God's way
[25:34] &gt;&gt; that God used them to bring it in a
[25:37] phenomenal way.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; But you say we are mere mortals. Now in
[25:41] the world of talent, the carnal world of
[25:43] talent, some people are more gifted than
[25:46] others. Amen. Have a sharper mind. But
[25:48] you see, when we start to take credit
[25:51] for ourself, the prophet of God says
[25:54] that's when we stumble and fall. Amen.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; So we never want to go there and say I'm
[25:59] I'm becoming quite a good Christian. We
[26:01] just want to say the Lord is gracious to
[26:03] me and we are able to stand in this
[26:06] time.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I don't know why I would feel
[26:10] the need to hurry but um as you you can
[26:15] look here in that in 2 Corinthians just
[26:18] everything that is that is taking place
[26:21] there. Um, Apostle Paul says, "We preach
[26:24] not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord
[26:26] and ourselves, your servants
[26:29] &gt;&gt; for Jesus' sake."
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; For God who commanded the light to shine
[26:34] out of darkness
[26:36] &gt;&gt; has shined in our hearts.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; So imagine here it is. This light in
[26:41] darkness, it's shining out. And we maybe
[26:45] are dwelling in that realm of darkness.
[26:47] And the light didn't just go out and
[26:50] disperse.
[26:51] God focused that light.
[26:54] It's the whole principle of how they in
[26:56] kind of you might say recognized or
[26:58] invented the laser. They realize that
[27:00] when light is focused, it's powerful.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the gospel light is
[27:07] focused on us,
[27:09] &gt;&gt; it is powerful.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lifechanging. Amen. Now, verse
[27:16] eight. I don't imagine any of you would
[27:18] necessarily
[27:20] uh relate to verse eight. Um
[27:25] that's always, you know, the other
[27:26] people.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But troubled on every side yet not
[27:30] distressed. We are perplexed but not in
[27:33] despair. Persecuted but not forsaken.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Cast down but not destroyed.
[27:45] always bearing about in the body the
[27:48] dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life
[27:50] also of Jesus might be made manifest
[27:54] &gt;&gt; in us in our body. For we which live are
[27:59] always delivered unto death for Jesus'
[28:02] sake, that the life also of Jesus might
[28:04] be made manifest in this mortal flesh.
[28:07] And that sounds, you know, pretty
[28:09] graphic or something, but really when we
[28:11] get up each and every day and we just go
[28:13] about serving the Lord, we will find
[28:16] that we are fulfilling this word is
[28:19] coming. That we are delivered into the
[28:22] death, amen, of our Lord Jesus. For his
[28:25] sake, we're delivered. We don't have to
[28:26] force our way in. We don't have to try
[28:29] and try and figure out how to get in.
[28:32] But it's just that life. Amen. And when
[28:34] we see it, we see the life of Jesus
[28:36] Christ being made manifest in us. And
[28:39] this young man I was talking to today,
[28:41] he he was telling me, he says, "You
[28:42] know, sometimes in the past I would just
[28:45] get so angry." And he says, "Something's
[28:48] happened to me."
[28:50] &gt;&gt; And and now I actually have my heart
[28:54] goes out and I I don't want him to be
[28:57] angry at me and I don't want to be angry
[28:59] at them. I want to help them. my brother
[29:01] and sister, that's God working on that
[29:03] young man. That's God making him into a
[29:05] new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. Now
[29:09] Daniel 12:1
[29:12] I I pull this in here uh just to say
[29:15] that at that time
[29:18] shall Michael stand up the great prince
[29:21] which standeth for the children of thy
[29:23] people. And there shall be a time of
[29:26] trouble such as never was since there
[29:29] was a nation even to that same time. And
[29:32] that time thy people shall be delivered.
[29:35] everyone that shall be found written in
[29:40] the book.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; You see, we don't have to worry about
[29:43] being deceived. We shouldn't spend our
[29:46] time worrying about being deceived.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; We need to spend our time, Amen, working
[29:51] out our salvation with fear and
[29:53] trembling to make sure that our life
[29:56] matches and our name would be there.
[29:59] Amen. So, we have this defense. I as I
[30:02] was reading this, I thought, man, that's
[30:05] awesome. We have this defense. We're
[30:07] standing here as believers tonight. And
[30:10] we have got Michael the archangel. Amen.
[30:14] We're not out here as a little lamb
[30:16] caught in the bush waiting for the wolf
[30:19] to to devour us. We have got heavenly
[30:22] beings. Angels are here in our midst and
[30:25] they're here to protect us and to lead
[30:28] us and guide us. So, you know, there's
[30:30] nothing like, you know, a good defense
[30:34] is a good offense. You hear it all the
[30:36] time when they talk about things like
[30:38] soccer and football and whatever that a
[30:41] good defense is a good offense. And when
[30:44] we get in the word, amen, which is our
[30:47] offense, getting in the word, it
[30:49] actually is our defense. And we can
[30:52] stand solid on that. We don't have to
[30:54] worry about, will God back up his word?
[30:57] No, God backs up his word. We don't have
[30:59] to be uh worried about that. Amen. So
[31:04] when we look at that, uh every life
[31:06] testifies
[31:08] uh of what it is. If you are in control
[31:11] of your life, it testifies.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost is in control of your
[31:17] life,
[31:18] &gt;&gt; it testifies.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can do like the rich young
[31:22] ruler and follow all of the commandments
[31:26] and not know Jesus Christ.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:31] And we have this promise of deliverance.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. At the time thy people shall be
[31:36] delivered, everyone that shall be found
[31:38] written in the book. So every man,
[31:40] woman, boy, girl, Amen. We need to stand
[31:42] up and be bold to receive our promise.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like distractions in the
[31:47] day that we live in. Satan just wants to
[31:49] draw us off this way, draw us off that
[31:51] way, uh get us uh focused on something
[31:54] else. A and in that all he's doing every
[31:56] time, he's like the pickpocket in the
[31:59] spiritual world and in the natural
[32:01] world. He's your pickpocket. Amen.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Now, the quote faith
[32:09] might seem a little bit different off
[32:11] track here, but the Lord laid this on my
[32:13] heart.
[32:15] The astonishing thing today is the
[32:17] behavior,
[32:19] the spiritual behavior of the Christian
[32:22] church.
[32:23] How can we have faith? How can we trust
[32:26] God when one wants to be above the
[32:29] other? When one wants to be a ruler over
[32:33] the other? When one wants to be a little
[32:36] greater than the other? Have a little
[32:39] bigger campaign than the other. Have
[32:41] something. How Jesus said, "How can you
[32:43] have faith when you seek honor one from
[32:46] another?" How can you have faith when
[32:48] you're trying your best to pull with all
[32:50] your strength to be the state prespitter
[32:52] or the bishop or some kind of overseer?
[32:56] Oh, the conduct of the church is
[32:59] terrible.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; My saints, I hope that that does not
[33:03] apply to us.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, help us that we don't have
[33:07] some conduct behind the scenes that has,
[33:09] you know, jealousies and and whatever
[33:11] else associated with it. Amen. The
[33:14] conduct of the church is terrible.
[33:16] Trying to keep the people away from the
[33:18] real thing of God. How can we? It's
[33:20] after we have an experience with God,
[33:23] then we become conducted as Christians,
[33:26] as brethren, as men and women who know
[33:29] God. Amen.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; So the only way that we can really come
[33:32] as it would be to judge anything around
[33:35] us is we need to have an experience
[33:37] first.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter whether we're
[33:40] talking offices in the church, we're
[33:42] talking families in the church, whatever
[33:44] it might be, we need to make sure that
[33:46] we have got our line, we're lined up.
[33:50] Amen. That God would be able to use us.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Not to step on someone's toes, step on
[33:58] someone's fingers. Amen.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a time for us to take
[34:04] an account of who we are,
[34:06] &gt;&gt; right now is that time.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should be good examples of
[34:10] God's grace.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not thinking I've got more portion
[34:14] of God's grace than you, but to be a
[34:17] good example of God's grace. Amen. That
[34:19] means we give grace to those around us.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be examples of God's grace, to
[34:24] be examples of his love. And the word
[34:27] says this will happen in troubled times.
[34:30] So troubled times is not going to be our
[34:32] excuse.
[34:34] It's actually going to be something that
[34:35] should motivate us because we're seeing
[34:37] it come to pass. Amen.
[34:43] In the quote water baptism,
[34:47] Brother Bram says this, "Sister Ruth, if
[34:50] you'll come."
[34:55] And if your revelation doesn't tie and
[34:57] you say, "God revealed to me that I
[34:59] should be baptized name of Father, Son,
[35:02] Holy Ghost." If that don't tie in with
[35:04] the word in from Genesis to Revelation
[35:08] and tie it together, then your
[35:10] revelation's wrong.
[35:11] Yeah. You say, "God revealed to me that
[35:14] I should be baptized in Jesus name." If
[35:17] it doesn't tie in with the word, then
[35:20] the urum thumbum don't back it up. No
[35:23] matter how real it seems, this is the
[35:26] authentic word. This is God's urum
[35:30] thumb. And we'll see times when people
[35:33] will say, "The Lord told me to do
[35:35] something."
[35:37] And then time, it's not me, it's not
[35:39] you. Time proves that it really wasn't
[35:44] the Lord that told them to do that.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; And and so we'll see how sometimes
[35:49] people get they get all excited. They
[35:51] get uh focused on something and they
[35:54] really want it to be what God told them
[35:56] to do. They do their best to craft it
[35:58] into what God wanted them to do. But in
[36:01] the end, just let the revelation of who
[36:04] you are guide you to be what God wants
[36:07] you to be, where he wants you to be.
[36:09] Amen. Then there's no doubt in your
[36:12] mind, no doubt in the world around you.
[36:16] Satan actually doesn't even have a
[36:18] doubt. He might persecute you, but he
[36:20] doesn't have a doubt of who you really
[36:22] are. Amen. Isn't it good to serve the
[36:24] Lord?
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very simple tonight. Amen. Hope
[36:30] that was all right with everyone. Amen.
[36:34] Don't want to whine and complain, but I
[36:36] actually didn't feel good. I almost
[36:37] called you, Brother David. Yeah.
[36:43] Amen.
[36:45] 309.
[36:50] Amen.
[36:53] D.
[36:58] Oh, I think you will once you get
[36:59] started.
[37:01] These are troubled times,
[37:04] my friend.
[37:07] must be faithful to the end, keeping
[37:12] perfect peace
[37:14] with our Lord
[37:17] and satisfying
[37:19] all his command,
[37:21] striving till we reach
[37:24] our reward
[37:27] through the awesome power of his word.
[37:32] These are troubled times,
[37:35] my friend.
[37:37] God is in his people on again.
[37:42] God is in his people once again
[37:47] fulfilling all the promise he has said.
[37:52] The truth, the word, the life manifest,
[37:57] the wonders of his glory again in flesh,
[38:03] preparing for the day
[38:06] when we see no longer through this glass
[38:10] of self darkly.
[38:13] God is in his people once again.
[38:18] So we must be faithful to the end. Maybe
[38:23] we ought to get a real song leader.
[38:25] Brother Alex, brother Isaac, somebody.
[38:29] Amen. We'll sing it again. It's a lovely
[38:31] song when when you get in the right What
[38:33] do you call that? When you get in the
[38:34] right cadence or the right whatever, it
[38:37] flows really nice. It just didn't flow
[38:39] for me. Amen. But praise the Lord. He
[38:42] never said, "Paul, I called you to be a
[38:44] song leader." And I say thank you for
[38:46] that. Just ask brother Alex how he feels
[38:49] about being a song leader and you'll
[38:50] realize sometimes it's not too exciting.
[38:53] Brother Isaac, what do you think about
[38:55] being a song leader? Yeah. Yeah, that's
[38:57] what I thought. Amen.
[39:00] Let's stand sing a song here.
[39:04] Isaac already took my prime song that I
[39:06] had of ancient words. So, we will we'll
[39:10] just sing another one here. Amen. 70.
[39:14] Amen.
[39:20] Let's just remember everyone who's not
[39:22] here tonight. Um, Sister Sue, Brother
[39:26] Trevor, Sister Carrie um on on down
[39:30] through each and everyone. Brother
[39:33] Sergey, I'm assuming is out hit the
[39:35] road. Amen. So, we want to be that.
[39:38] Brother Vasilei, etc. Be with each and
[39:41] everyone.
[39:43] Just
[39:45] &gt;&gt; you don't know this song.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; You want a song leader? But
[39:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to fire you because I
[39:55] would have to then try to figure out how
[39:56] to play the piano and sing. So that's
[39:59] just not going to work.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'll sing of the mercies of the
[40:03] Lord forever. That's number 67. Sister
[40:06] Vika, we know that one, don't we?
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:12] I will sing of the mercies of my Lord.
[40:37] With my mouth
[40:40] shall I make known
[40:44] thy faithfulness.
[40:47] Thy faithfulness.
[40:50] With my mouth
[40:53] shall I make known
[40:58] to all generations.
[41:03] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[41:08] forever. I will sing of the mercies of
[41:12] the Lord.
[41:15] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[41:20] forever. I will sing. Oh, I will sing.
[41:28] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[41:33] forever. I will sing of the mercies of
[41:38] the Lord.
[41:40] With my mouth
[41:43] shall I make known
[41:47] thy faithfulness.
[41:50] Thy faithfulness.
[41:53] With my mouth
[41:56] shall I make known
[41:59] thy faithfulness to all generations.
[42:06] I will sing of the merc of the Lord
[42:11] forever. I will sing of the mercies of
[42:16] the Lord.
[42:20] Amen.
[42:25] I didn't I had like one song written
[42:27] down but I actually feel to sing um hold
[42:30] to God's unchanging hand.
[42:41] Time
[42:43] is filled with swift transition.
[42:50] Not unmoved the earth can stand.
[42:56] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[43:03] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[43:11] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[43:18] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[43:24] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[43:31] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[43:38] Trust in him who will not leave you.
[43:45] Oh soever years may bring
