[32:23] isaiah 40 28 it says
[32:27] hast thou not known
[32:29] hast thou not heard that the everlasting
[32:32] god the lord the creator of the ends of
[32:35] the earth
[32:36] fainteth not
[32:38] neither is weary there is no searching
[32:40] of his understanding
[32:43] there we go sorry
[32:46] how many heard that
[32:48] anybody want me to repeat it
[32:50] okay
[32:51] you want me to repeat it okay
[32:53] isaiah 40 28
[32:55] hast thou not known
[32:57] hast thou not heard
[32:59] that the everlasting god the lord the
[33:01] creator of the ends of the earth
[33:05] fainteth not
[33:07] amen
[33:09] there is no there neither is weary
[33:12] there's no searching of his
[33:14] understanding
[33:15] will he not reveal his word to whom he
[33:17] will
[33:19] you don't have to mentally try to figure
[33:21] it out
[33:24] amen
[33:25] let's stand together this morning
[33:28] i thank the lord for his presence
[33:32] i'm expecting god to bless his word this
[33:34] morning i'm expecting him to give it to
[33:36] you as he desires it individually and
[33:38] personally
[33:39] and i'm expecting him to speak through
[33:43] his word
[33:44] through these lips his thoughts may they
[33:46] be expressed i have no business being
[33:48] here
[33:49] trying to figure out and trying to give
[33:50] you my thoughts
[33:53] but god let god give you his thoughts
[33:56] he quickened
[33:58] through the things that he laid in my
[33:59] heart
[34:01] may have opened your heart if you come
[34:02] here kind of stirred up i just say lord
[34:04] just quiet my spirit
[34:08] satan just did everything he could to
[34:09] keep this from coming this morning stop
[34:12] my printer everything he could do
[34:16] but he's lost
[34:18] he doesn't have the victory
[34:22] so we're expecting god i'm expecting how
[34:24] many has come expecting him to speak to
[34:27] you
[34:29] is that your desire
[34:31] are you willing to lay yourself down
[34:35] for that to happen
[34:38] amen
[34:39] oh no lord i'll have my own way you
[34:41] can't have your way in his way
[34:43] you've got to have one or the other
[34:46] his way is perfect
[34:49] amen let's just have word of prayer
[34:51] heavenly father
[34:53] our father
[34:55] who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[35:00] thy kingdom come lord
[35:02] right here in the heart of your saints
[35:04] is coming
[35:05] it's coming lord

[35:10] us
[35:11] individually lord it's a love affair
[35:16] lord
[35:17] the kingdom come
[35:19] thy will be done
[35:22] in this earth
[35:25] that i'm hidden behind lord in this
[35:27] earth
[35:29] and in this earth here lord
[35:31] i will be done in earth as it is in
[35:34] heaven
[35:35] i'm willing to have that father i know
[35:38] there's people here willing lord to do
[35:40] everything they can
[35:42] what they do must do lord is die to self
[35:46] give up themselves and take that
[35:50] perfect
[35:51] word
[35:54] lord jesus
[35:55] we love you we commit this service have
[35:58] committed it i believe you brought
[35:59] everyone here that should be here
[36:02] lord may your perfect will be
[36:05] accomplished
[36:07] and ministered i pray and for your glory
[36:10] in jesus christ's name we ask you to
[36:12] bless your word
[36:14] amen
[36:17] amen
[36:19] been a while since i've ministered and
[36:20] it's you'd get nervous
[36:24] because it's
[36:25] a dying of this old self
[36:29] but i know he's present right yeah they
[36:32] always here
[36:33] that's all i need to know
[36:38] i trust you will not leave here and i do
[36:40] not believe you can come in the presence
[36:42] of the lord and leave here the same as
[36:44] you came in
[36:46] you're going to either be closer drawn
[36:47] to him or further from him
[36:49] and the word will do the separating
[36:53] that's right
[36:54] so in isaiah the 55th chapter if you
[36:57] turn feed your bibles
[37:06] and i've been kind of a quandary where
[37:08] to start reading but i think i'm going
[37:10] to start with verse one here and maybe
[37:12] skip a little bit
[37:15] forgive me if i i don't know what it is
[37:17] when i get up to preach my nose runs
[37:20] and says you just use your
[37:23] use your
[37:25] rag here
[37:35] i lost it there it is thank you brother
[37:39] now that's a good that's a good mic
[37:42] controller
[37:45] okay
[37:48] now you've seen me raise that again turn
[37:50] it down would you
[37:52] okay
[37:57] okay isaiah 55
[38:00] and verse 1.
[38:02] and i might just add here when
[38:04] we were visiting with brother
[38:07] jason's sister emmy i mentioned brother
[38:09] jason this song oh everyone that thirsts
[38:12] this is where this is taken from
[38:14] isaiah 55 1 whole everyone that
[38:17] thirsteth
[38:18] come into the waters
[38:21] and he that hath no money
[38:23] come ye
[38:24] buy and eat
[38:26] yay come
[38:27] buy wine and milk without money without
[38:30] price
[38:31] isn't that wonderful why can't you give
[38:33] up yourself
[38:36] you can't purchase this
[38:38] there's not enough work you can do to
[38:39] merit it
[38:41] why don't you just let yourself go and
[38:43] repent
[38:47] the problem is with so many
[38:50] today there's not so many new births as
[38:52] the problem is they haven't truly
[38:53] repented
[38:57] repentance is a sorrowfulness for your
[38:59] sin a breaking
[39:01] a turning around
[39:03] and a faith in your heart to say god you
[39:07] you purchase my salvation isn't what i
[39:09] do it's what you've already done for me
[39:11] and my faith in that you repent and be
[39:14] baptized in water but it's repentance
[39:16] first
[39:18] water baptism will not save you
[39:22] amen it will not it's only an outward
[39:25] expression of an inward faith of what
[39:27] you have the final work in calvary
[39:30] that's repentance
[39:34] you truly repent
[39:36] and you truly take that baptism in his
[39:38] name there's nothing going to stop you
[39:39] from having the holy spirit
[39:44] see where it becomes short if anybody's
[39:46] here that hasn't really repented it's
[39:48] not a mental makeup it's not a mental
[39:51] work up
[39:52] you can re you can you can quote
[39:54] scriptures right unless the devil does
[39:56] the same thing
[39:58] even quote the message
[40:02] but unless you're born again
[40:05] unless the holy ghost himself comes from
[40:07] works in you then it's a growing up
[40:11] you don't stop right there then you lay
[40:13] in the presence of the sun and ripen
[40:16] that's the only way that you can have a
[40:18] body change
[40:20] amen takes repentance first a sorrow god
[40:25] forgive me
[40:27] take these sins from me
[40:29] birth yourself in me
[40:32] i'm taking my stand for you
[40:34] you love me first it's that faith that
[40:36] genuine faith that causes repentance
[40:39] in what jesus christ did for you
[40:42] i won't go any further with that
[40:45] so but wherefore why do you spend money
[40:47] for that which is not bread and your
[40:49] labor for that which satisfyeth not
[40:52] hearken diligently unto me and eat that
[40:54] which which is good and let your soul
[40:56] delight itself in fatness
[40:59] incline your ear and come unto me here
[41:01] and your soul shall live and i will make
[41:02] an everlasting covenant with you even
[41:04] the sure mercies of david
[41:08] behold i have and let's stop it seek ye
[41:11] the lord verse six seek ye the lord
[41:13] while he
[41:14] may be
[41:15] found
[41:16] i don't know the door may shut any
[41:19] moment and it may already be
[41:23] amen the bride will still be on earth
[41:25] for a period of time preaching to the
[41:27] eternal loss i'm not saying it is please
[41:30] understand but if you have a pull in
[41:31] your heart for more of god you better
[41:34] run quickly to his grace
[41:36] and give up your life to him
[41:39] don't you depend upon some sensation and
[41:42] some emotion
[41:43] it's got to be that word genuinely
[41:45] revealed in you
[41:47] because the new birth is jesus christ
[41:49] revealed it is jesus christ in you
[41:52] amen
[41:53] how many believe that
[41:55] then what are you worried about
[42:01] he's not going to take it away
[42:03] you're in him you're in him amen we're
[42:05] coming into that
[42:07] god help me
[42:10] that he may be found call upon him while
[42:12] he is near let the wickedness is too
[42:14] loud
[42:16] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[42:18] righteous man his thoughts that's better
[42:20] thank you
[42:21] let him return unto the lord and he will
[42:23] have mercy upon him is still getting a
[42:25] rebound
[42:27] you can turn that down a little bit
[42:31] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[42:33] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[42:35] return unto the lord he'll have mercy
[42:37] upon him and and to our god for his
[42:39] abundant will abundantly pardon i'm
[42:41] coming into my thoughts here for my
[42:43] thoughts are not your thoughts
[42:47] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[42:49] lord may god reveal that to every one of
[42:52] us
[42:54] my thoughts
[42:55] david's thoughts david's carnal thoughts
[42:58] david's ways are not his ways
[43:01] so let go of your ways
[43:03] let go of your carnal thinking
[43:05] you say those thoughts come yes they do
[43:07] but you don't have to keep them there
[43:11] because it's not you satan want to
[43:12] present a thought but that come from
[43:14] your soul you know whether you're born
[43:16] again or not
[43:18] you have the mind of god if you are if
[43:20] the holy ghost is dwelling in your soul
[43:22] you have the mind of christ
[43:24] and christ don't think those thoughts
[43:28] so where did it come from didn't come
[43:30] from you
[43:31] didn't come from your heart
[43:34] then take authority over by the word
[43:37] amen
[43:39] so my thoughts my thought david's
[43:41] thoughts are not
[43:43] my excuse me my thoughts god's thoughts
[43:46] god speaking are not your thoughts
[43:48] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[43:51] lord
[43:52] for as the heavens are higher than the
[43:54] earth so are my ways higher than your
[43:57] ways
[43:59] and my thoughts then your thoughts
[44:02] so now therefore his thoughts and his
[44:05] ways then become my absolute yes
[44:09] he's expressed that in his word to us so
[44:11] our absolute is the word
[44:14] now god sent a prophet because god's
[44:16] word comes to his prophets and the
[44:17] prophet has the interpretation of the
[44:19] word for the season
[44:21] then that becomes absolute
[44:24] that
[44:25] that interpretation for the word for
[44:27] this season don't you add to it and take
[44:30] from it if you do then you really don't
[44:32] believe god sent a prophet a vindicated
[44:34] prophet
[44:35] because when he interpreted this word to
[44:37] be something how dare you try to add to
[44:39] or take from god's thought
[44:42] because he sent a prophet to interpret
[44:44] the word for the season
[44:45] [Music]
[44:46] i may believe that i can show you quote
[44:48] after quote the prophet said that amen
[44:53] be careful we don't water the message
[44:54] down
[44:57] amen the message i'm talking about the
[44:58] message is jesus christ revealed
[45:01] amen
[45:04] not your interpretation nor my
[45:06] interpretation
[45:07] it's his what he said brother brown said
[45:10] we now have the perfect interpretation
[45:12] of the word by divine vindication that
[45:14] you argue with him
[45:18] amen
[45:20] you can't take this and just figure it
[45:21] out
[45:23] and even know what god's speaking unless
[45:25] god sent a prophet to interpret it for
[45:27] us
[45:28] 2.
[45:30] not the man i'm not talking about
[45:32] william branham the man i'm talking
[45:33] about god the word who came to that man
[45:36] vindicated his own word see amen
[45:40] so when these two come together you've
[45:41] got mechanics and dynamics
[45:46] that's right when the holy spirit and
[45:47] this word come together you've got the
[45:49] mechanics and dynamics without the holy
[45:51] spirit you'll never discern what it's
[45:53] saying
[45:54] you'll never get what the prophet's
[45:56] saying i don't care how many quotes you
[45:57] give of the prophet you can add your own
[45:58] thinking and give your own quote
[46:01] but if what he said doesn't line up with
[46:03] this word
[46:05] in your thing in your heart and see it
[46:07] properly in the word you said the wrong
[46:09] thing you can quote him all you want
[46:10] you're not saying what he said
[46:14] i hope you understand that
[46:17] all right
[46:18] now for the rain cometh down from and
[46:21] the snow from heaven and returneth not
[46:24] thither other words he sent the rain
[46:26] down it was for a purpose he sent the
[46:28] snow down as for a purpose
[46:30] but watereth the earth and make it that
[46:32] bring forth and bud
[46:34] that it may give seed to the sower and
[46:36] bread to the eater
[46:38] verse 11 so shall my word hallelujah
[46:42] so shall my word that's his word
[46:45] and that's your word if you be in him
[46:48] amen are you with me yes
[46:52] okay so shall my word be that goeth
[46:55] forth out of my mouth
[46:59] it shall not return to me void other
[47:01] words it's going to return to him but it
[47:02] won't return void it's got to come
[47:05] to manifest it will manifest what he
[47:07] sent it to do it won't return to him
[47:09] void
[47:10] amen it will not return to me boyd but
[47:12] it shall accomplish that which i please
[47:17] and it shall prosper in the thing
[47:19] whereunto i sent it now sent it that's
[47:22] my absolute yes
[47:27] for ye shall go out
[47:29] now it's ye
[47:31] what's he speaking of here
[47:33] the prophet said now if you be that
[47:36] word heavens and earth will pass away
[47:39] but my word shall not fail and if you be
[47:41] that word that come out of his mouth if
[47:43] you be that word you cannot pass away
[47:46] either
[47:48] amen
[47:49] all right so my word who is there
[47:51] anybody here that would be his thought
[47:53] express
[47:54] so my word shall not return to me void
[47:57] but and for ye shall go out with joy he
[48:00] sent it
[48:01] and ye shall go off with joy and be led
[48:04] forth with peace
[48:07] the mountains and the hills shall break
[48:09] forth before you unto singing and all
[48:11] the trees of the field shall clap their
[48:13] hands
[48:16] so you've got a hope you're looking for
[48:18] you're looking for a fulfillment of what
[48:19] he started in you he will finish
[48:25] you can be seated i got some more
[48:27] scriptures here

[48:36] subject my title this morning is the
[48:38] greatest love story
[48:42] the greatest
[48:44] love
[48:45] story
[48:48] a subject
[48:49] is ripening in the presence of the sun
[48:53] having spiritual contractions
[48:58] that sound like a a
[49:00] funny saying doesn't it
[49:03] that we're the greatest love story and
[49:05] then we're in the midst of spiritual
[49:07] contractions
[49:08] why
[49:09] we're in travail for a body change
[49:15] amen
[49:16] anybody in travail for a body change
[49:19] amen
[49:21] the next thing for the bride is
[49:23] body change
[49:27] we don't live by dogmas
[49:29] we don't live by some man's idea
[49:32] some thought saying well there's got to
[49:34] be this or that if it's not in the
[49:35] scripture it's dogma
[49:38] amen
[49:39] amen i don't care if you quote the
[49:41] prophet and then try to tell by the
[49:42] prophet's quotes that you try to express
[49:44] your own thoughts if your thoughts isn't
[49:46] in this word
[49:47] amen it's dogma
[49:50] it may seem true but it's not
[49:53] i'll just leave that there i was going
[49:54] to preach a message dogma versus truth
[49:57] but it's a anyway
[50:01] but in job 38
[50:04] verse 3
[50:06] gird up now thy loins like a man
[50:10] for i will demand of thee and answer
[50:12] thou me
[50:14] where wast thou
[50:16] when i laid the foundation of the earth
[50:19] declare
[50:20] if thou hast understanding
[50:26] who hath laid the measures thereof if
[50:28] thou knowest or who hath stretched the
[50:30] line upon it whereupon are the
[50:32] foundations thereof fastened or who laid
[50:35] the cornerstone thereof
[50:37] when the morning stars sang together and
[50:40] all the sons of god shouted for joy
[50:42] where were thee
[50:45] where were you bride
[50:49] where were you
[50:53] all right ephesians chapter one
[51:05] starting with verse
[51:06] three these are little lengthy
[51:08] scriptures but you just bear with me
[51:12] we really don't have anything to rush
[51:15] for
[51:17] if you do and you need to get up you're
[51:19] welcome
[51:20] you see i got so much built up over two
[51:23] months that
[51:26] i have to let it out
[51:28] somehow
[51:30] now part of that is just kidding the
[51:32] part of it's serious
[51:36] it's true
[51:38] but i will follow the lord
[51:41] and that is true
[51:43] verse 3 blessed be the god and father of
[51:46] our lord jesus christ
[51:48] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[51:51] blessings
[51:53] in heavenly places

[51:57] according as he had chosen us in him
[52:01] where were you
[52:04] according that he had chosen us in him
[52:07] before the foundation of the world

[52:17] you didn't choose that
[52:18] he did

[52:28] before you performed anything before any
[52:30] works were done
[52:32] right
[52:34] you were chosen in him
[52:36] that ought to settle it we could say
[52:38] amen and go home happy
[52:40] full of joy
[52:42] having victory over
[52:43] the battlefield
[52:48] amen
[52:51] you were chosen in him before the
[52:52] foundation of the world that you should
[52:54] be holy and without blame before him in

[58:25] real repentance
[58:30] amen
[58:31] and you take that water baptism with
[58:33] that faith in your heart knowing that
[58:34] what god did is a final it's finished
[58:38] you're going to come with the holy ghost
[58:41] you'll be at something take place in
[58:42] that soul because faith will be answered

[59:09] you got to come through the door
[59:12] repent and be baptized every one of you
[59:14] in the name of jesus christ and you
[59:16] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[59:18] god has to keep that word and if you've
[59:21] got that true faith in that word he's

[59:25] right
[59:27] and he gives you that faith
[59:29] amen
[59:34] i was going to preach a whole message on

[59:37] and deep on my heart
[59:40] and paul said this we do if god permit
[59:43] you young people don't try to come some
[59:45] other way
[59:47] you've got to recognize what he did for

[1:00:07] something's got to happen
[1:00:09] something's got to take place
[1:00:12] the reason it isn't because many times i
[1:00:14] say it again no true repentance
[1:00:18] you don't come with a dried confession
[1:00:20] brother it's just a dried confession
[1:00:21] something got to drop in your heart that
[1:00:23] it's finished and you're willing to lie
[1:00:25] right there and give yourself over to it
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] all right
[1:00:31] amen i have to pray that god help me to
[1:00:34] i think

[1:00:42] see you again and he says now he said 21
[1:00:45] second verse and ye now therefore have
[1:00:47] sorrow but i will see you again
[1:00:49] amen and your heart shall rejoice in
[1:00:52] your joy no man taketh from you
[1:00:57] and in that day you shall ask me nothing
[1:00:59] verily verily i say unto you whatsoever
[1:01:01] you shall ask the father in my name he
[1:01:02] will give it you amen amen amen all
[1:01:06] right
[1:01:09] these things have spoken unto you in
[1:01:10] proverbs but the time cometh when i
[1:01:12] shall no more speak unto you in proverbs
[1:01:14] but i shall show you openly
[1:01:18] all right i think that day's come
[1:01:21] it's here sure absolutely i say it not
[1:01:23] in bed it's been another day but we've
[1:01:25] returned back to the restoration of that

[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:29] openly
[1:01:32] plainly of the father
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:35] all right
[1:01:36] he said you will have sorrow but your
[1:01:38] sorrow shall be turned to joy
[1:01:41] the bible said in his presence his
[1:01:43] fullness of joy
[1:01:46] amen that's where
[1:01:49] that's where we live his fullness of joy
[1:01:54] at his right hand is pleasures
[1:01:56] forevermore
[1:01:58] amen amen where are you living in christ
[1:02:03] amen all
[1:02:04] right but does the devil come and try to
[1:02:07] beat you out of that sure he does
[1:02:09] because you got an outer man that's not
[1:02:11] born again
[1:02:12] and he's against you it's an enemy
[1:02:15] i may know that brother brown but
[1:02:16] scripture i mean scripture said your
[1:02:18] carnal self is an inmate enemy enmity

[1:06:08] romans 8
[1:06:10] 18.
[1:06:13] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:06:15] present time
[1:06:17] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:06:19] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:06:23] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:06:26] creature
[1:06:27] waited
[1:06:28] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:06:31] that creatures creation
[1:06:34] for the creature or creation was made
[1:06:36] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[1:06:40] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:06:42] in hope
[1:06:43] but the creature itself also shall be
[1:06:46] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:06:49] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:06:51] children of god this whole earth will
[1:06:54] someday be absolutely changed to a new
[1:06:57] heavens and the new earth and the earth
[1:06:59] is in birth pains for that to happen

[1:07:15] what are they looking for
[1:07:17] because actually the pains are rejoicing
[1:07:20] and a leaping and a joyous thing because
[1:07:22] sons of god are coming to their position

[1:07:27] going to be redeemed under a son of god
[1:07:32] are you with me
[1:07:33] they're actually rejoicing over it
[1:07:34] that's why they're leaping and things
[1:07:36] are happening they're going to give way
[1:07:39] yet it's a it's labor pain
[1:07:43] what about this little bride today

[1:07:59] the devil don't want you to really
[1:08:00] recognize what's happening
[1:08:05] if he can keep you beat down
[1:08:08] so you don't recognize your position and
[1:08:10] who you are
[1:08:13] but if you recognize your position and
[1:08:15] who you are
[1:08:18] amen he's defeated
[1:08:21] to you he's already defeated
[1:08:24] but he's going to try to keep you not to
[1:08:25] believe that

[1:11:02] not lost anybody on that statement all
[1:11:04] right
[1:11:05] verse 2 for the life the life the life
[1:11:10] was manifested and we have seen it
[1:11:13] in other words
[1:11:15] revelation of the word is christ or
[1:11:17] god's way of making himself known to his
[1:11:19] bride
[1:11:21] i don't want you to forget that
[1:11:23] we could go back to saint john 17 verse
[1:11:25] 3 he said that which things we know and
[1:11:28] well i'll just let's just let's just
[1:11:30] clip over there just a minute
[1:11:32] saint john 17 hold your place right
[1:11:34] there i'm coming right back but i want
[1:11:35] to make this statement here and you'll
[1:11:37] see where we're talking about remember
[1:11:38] his word can't return void
[1:11:42] amen his word cannot return void so we
[1:11:45] go back here to saint john 17
[1:11:48] and verse 3 says and this is life
[1:11:52] eternal
[1:11:54] that they may know
[1:11:58] thee
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:06] let's know thee intellectual no no you
[1:12:09] will get anywhere with an intellectual
[1:12:10] knowledge of him you must know him
[1:12:13] he said i don't know you what didn't he
[1:12:15] know of you you weren't part of him but
[1:12:17] he's you're a part of him and he reveals
[1:12:19] himself to you i just read it out of
[1:12:21] ephesians you'll make the mystery known
[1:12:24] all right and this is life eternal that
[1:12:26] they may know thee the only true god
[1:12:29] which is only eternal life there is and
[1:12:31] jesus christ whom thou hast sent that
[1:12:33] doesn't mean jesus christ is another
[1:12:35] being it was god manifested
[1:12:38] they're not separated it's one god
[1:12:41] right there the scripture tells it amen
[1:12:45] amen
[1:12:48] this is eternal life that they may know
[1:12:51] thee the only true god and jesus christ
[1:12:53] whom thou hast sinned a lot more in that
[1:12:56] scripture we could go to but we won't
[1:12:58] take time
[1:12:59] now
[1:13:01] revelation of the word revelation is
[1:13:04] god's way of making himself known to his
[1:13:06] church his pride
[1:13:09] for the life was manifested
[1:13:12] i want you to hold that because we are
[1:13:14] in the midst of seeing life manifested
[1:13:19] and life manifested as more than i'm not
[1:13:21] against it more than shouting jumping
[1:13:27] it's living the word
[1:13:29] the holy ghost
[1:13:31] is an action in you
[1:13:33] it's a word lived
[1:13:35] it's the word live for the season you
[1:13:38] recognize and you receive the word of
[1:13:40] promise for the season because you are
[1:13:43] seeing it
[1:13:46] you hear it
[1:13:48] all right so the life was manifested and
[1:13:51] we have seen it and bear witness and we
[1:13:54] see it being manifested where today
[1:13:59] the word the light being manifested is
[1:14:01] jesus christ
[1:14:02] but where is he
[1:14:05] the greatest love story
[1:14:07] he reveals himself and you and i
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:12] all right
[1:14:14] and we have seen it and we bear witness
[1:14:17] and this has all been preached i'm not
[1:14:19] trying to preach brother paul's message
[1:14:20] again we have seen it and bear witness
[1:14:22] and show unto you that eternal life we
[1:14:24] have something to
[1:14:26] show and
[1:14:29] unto you that that eternal life which
[1:14:31] was with the father and was manifested
[1:14:34] unto us
[1:14:35] that which we have seen
[1:14:38] and heard
[1:14:39] declare we unto you that you may have
[1:14:42] fellowship with us so you see where
[1:14:44] fellowship is
[1:14:45] it's in the revealed mystery
[1:14:47] so you so that you may have fellowship
[1:14:49] with us
[1:14:50] or it's the message revealed
[1:14:53] brother brown said the new birth is the
[1:14:55] message of the hour
[1:14:58] amen all right he said he said you may
[1:15:02] have fellowship with us and truly our
[1:15:04] fellowship was with the father and with
[1:15:07] himself manifested in flesh
[1:15:10] truly our fellowship is with the father
[1:15:13] with his son jesus christ
[1:15:15] verse 5 this then oh i'm sorry and these
[1:15:19] things we write unto you that your joy
[1:15:21] may be full
[1:15:25] i just told you
[1:15:26] the presence in his presence is what
[1:15:29] fullness
[1:15:31] of joy
[1:15:33] he sings we write unto you that your joy
[1:15:35] may be full this then is the message
[1:15:38] which we have heard of him and declare
[1:15:40] unto you that god is light
[1:15:43] and in him is no darkness at all not
[1:15:46] even a shadow of eternity it's perfect
[1:15:49] god's ways are perfect and he said and i
[1:15:51] made your way perfect
[1:15:55] all right
[1:15:57] all right now
[1:16:01] the elect only the elect will see
[1:16:04] and here
[1:16:06] only the elect
[1:16:10] only the elect can be reborn
[1:16:15] you know why don't you because the seed
[1:16:17] is there to be quickened
[1:16:20] what seed god seed
[1:16:23] the word seed
[1:16:25] is there to be quickened in this hour to
[1:16:27] manifest the word for the hour that's
[1:16:29] why you will see the hour and the time
[1:16:32] you receive it you see it others say i
[1:16:34] can't see it
[1:16:36] but you see it
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:40] all right
[1:16:43] now
[1:16:44] the word is god's thoughts express i may
[1:16:47] say amen the word of god the word is
[1:16:50] god's thoughts
[1:16:52] expressed
[1:16:55] of course that's what a word is and i'm
[1:16:57] talking about god's word
[1:16:59] is god's thoughts expressed
[1:17:01] revelation okay which is his
[1:17:04] way of making himself known to the
[1:17:06] church
[1:17:07] now on the message 318
[1:17:10] 64 i didn't write down the message but
[1:17:12] you can look it up
[1:17:13] in the beginning paragraph 81 i'm
[1:17:15] playing this out so you go back as
[1:17:17] brother paul always said many times go
[1:17:18] back and read ahead and behind
[1:17:21] now you say well why don't you put it up
[1:17:22] i've got so many i don't want to put
[1:17:24] them up
[1:17:26] and i'm not used to that i'm an old
[1:17:28] order preacher
[1:17:31] and if you either just sit there and
[1:17:33] pick it up you just it makes you listen
[1:17:35] doesn't it
[1:17:36] all right i don't have to worry about
[1:17:38] you reading ahead of me
[1:17:44] something could come out of it anyway
[1:17:46] all right
[1:17:47] in the beginning
[1:17:49] in the beginning god was not even god
[1:17:51] now isn't that a statement
[1:17:54] why because god's an object of
[1:17:57] but he was eternal being he was a being
[1:18:00] all right
[1:18:01] but he had to have something to worship
[1:18:03] him you know the rest of the story
[1:18:04] created angels okay but in the beginning
[1:18:07] god was not even god
[1:18:09] he was the great eternal and in there in
[1:18:12] there where in that great eternal was
[1:18:15] attributes
[1:18:16] attributes was his thoughts
[1:18:20] whose thoughts god's thoughts
[1:18:22] all right
[1:18:25] and then he became a word
[1:18:28] like this
[1:18:30] and
[1:18:31] a word expressed well a thought
[1:18:33] expressed is a word a word expressed is
[1:18:36] a thought
[1:18:38] all right so in the beginning was the
[1:18:40] word
[1:18:41] keep that in mind and the word was with
[1:18:43] god and the word was god
[1:18:49] paragraph 82 same message and then
[1:18:51] remember if you ever was in god's
[1:18:53] thinking you will always be there
[1:18:59] if you ever was in god's thinking
[1:19:02] you'll always be there
[1:19:08] right now you see right now right there
[1:19:10] the devil's defeated amen
[1:19:14] when that revelation comes in you alive
[1:19:18] there's nothing going to take you out of
[1:19:20] this
[1:19:21] oh he may try i'm not saying we'll try
[1:19:23] your old man will speak back to you
[1:19:27] but that doesn't change
[1:19:29] the revelation
[1:19:31] right all right
[1:19:33] and remember if you ever was in god's
[1:19:35] thinking you'll always be there if
[1:19:37] you've got eternal life you are the
[1:19:38] expression or the attribute of his
[1:19:40] thoughts for this age
[1:19:45] if not
[1:19:47] there is only one eternal life and it
[1:19:50] always existed
[1:19:52] and you
[1:19:54] in his mind
[1:19:56] existed existed
[1:19:59] existed
[1:20:00] before there was a world
[1:20:04] hallelujah
[1:20:09] before there was a world that's the
[1:20:11] reason he said he chose you
[1:20:14] before the foundation of the world why
[1:20:16] you were in the thinking of himself
[1:20:23] therefore being in himself you are
[1:20:26] perfect
[1:20:32] you say well brother david you don't
[1:20:33] seem very perfect when you get upset and
[1:20:34] you do this you say this
[1:20:36] and the wife says this and i say that
[1:20:38] and this something else says this
[1:20:40] you're just talking about the wrong side
[1:20:42] of the veil
[1:20:49] why brother branham you make yourself
[1:20:51] god to the people he said well is that
[1:20:54] so far off the truth
[1:20:58] isn't that what the prophet said mighty
[1:21:00] god unveiled he said i knew which side
[1:21:02] of the veil he was talking about
[1:21:06] to make him god william branham
[1:21:08] is antichrist but to making that word
[1:21:10] living in its day and hour
[1:21:13] is the truth so is the bride
[1:21:18] amen
[1:21:20] amen
[1:21:21] my word will not return to be void
[1:21:25] it's going to accomplish
[1:21:27] you're going to accomplish
[1:21:28] you're going to do exactly those works
[1:21:30] have been predestinated in him before
[1:21:32] the foundation of the world
[1:21:38] you're his workmanship created in christ
[1:21:40] jesus under good works which he hath
[1:21:41] before ordained
[1:21:46] where do you ordain it in himself
[1:21:50] it's not your will it's his will
[1:21:53] he placed his will showed himself in you
[1:21:56] amen all right
[1:21:58] now
[1:22:00] so he says
[1:22:01] and you the real i'm talking about the
[1:22:04] real you

[1:22:14] believer
[1:22:17] amen all right he said and you in his
[1:22:21] mind existed before the there was a
[1:22:23] world
[1:22:25] that's the reason he said he chose you
[1:22:29] before the foundation of the world isn't
[1:22:32] it isn't what we think
[1:22:35] what somebody else
[1:22:37] thinks
[1:22:40] not even what david thinks
[1:22:43] this man's always against me
[1:22:46] every time i turn around against me is
[1:22:47] that right
[1:22:48] oh well how do you know why you would
[1:22:50] look at now it's only reasonable to say
[1:22:54] why your feelings are testifying
[1:22:55] something different
[1:22:57] does he ever speak to you like that
[1:23:00] certainly
[1:23:01] if you're a real believer
[1:23:02] you're in battle you're not on a picnic
[1:23:05] and you're fighting for every inch of
[1:23:06] ground god's already given you
[1:23:10] and this battle getting hot and heavy is
[1:23:12] getting closer and closer together
[1:23:15] but we're only showing one thing i'm
[1:23:17] ready for a body
[1:23:18] change i'm coming to that
[1:23:21] amen all right
[1:23:25] all right so and you and his mind
[1:23:26] existed
[1:23:28] it isn't what we think what somebody
[1:23:29] else thinks it's what god eternal it's
[1:23:33] what god eternal
[1:23:34] thinks
[1:23:35] you always was see in his thinking
[1:23:43] this is his thinking revealed
[1:23:45] the word
[1:23:46] is this is a letter
[1:23:48] but you aren't ministers of the letter
[1:23:50] even
[1:23:54] and yet we are but how are we ministers
[1:23:56] of the letter by the spirit that wrote
[1:23:58] it
[1:24:02] without the spirit that wrote it you
[1:24:03] won't understand the letter
[1:24:05] you'll take a mental conception about it
[1:24:07] and go off in sin
[1:24:11] amen that's exactly right
[1:24:15] but if you
[1:24:16] believe it hold the mental conception by
[1:24:19] the same token god said you're i've
[1:24:21] given right mental attitude
[1:24:25] amen
[1:24:26] i'll make it known
[1:24:28] so something's got to control that
[1:24:30] all right
[1:24:32] i won't go any further than that all
[1:24:34] right now

[1:30:30] responsibility let him do what he wants
[1:30:32] to do let him act the way he wants to
[1:30:35] act through you quit leaning on your own
[1:30:38] self deny yourself there's no greater

[1:31:00] it's bright age it's the raptured age
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:07] he's capped it off the bride is not
[1:31:09] another age it's the capping of the ages
[1:31:12] it's himself
[1:31:14] we're caught up in the manifestation and
[1:31:16] manifesting himself in the bride form
[1:31:19] that's the full revelation of himself
[1:31:22] makes you the complete revelation of the

[1:31:36] so the heart the purpose of god the
[1:31:38] heart purpose the eternal purpose
[1:31:44] was a bride of his own election
[1:31:47] his own choosing and that purpose was in
[1:31:49] himself and being eternal was decreed
[1:31:52] before the foundation of the world you
[1:31:54] have a thing to do with this
[1:31:58] he decreed it before the world began
[1:32:03] watch carefully now and see this before
[1:32:05] there was even a speck of stardust
[1:32:07] before god was god god's an object of
[1:32:09] adoration no one there to worship him so
[1:32:12] he was that time only potentially god
[1:32:14] and he was known only as an eternal
[1:32:16] spirit the bride was already in his mind
[1:32:27] oh
[1:32:29] what's this got to do with all these
[1:32:31] little ideas that he sought you that you
[1:32:33] know is the devil talking to you
[1:32:39] what was he defeated with in the
[1:32:40] beginning it is written
[1:32:45] it is written where
[1:32:47] in your heart
[1:32:54] it right here in the word and this
[1:32:56] becomes in you
[1:32:57] you are the word living and in action
[1:33:00] the manifestation of the holy spirit
[1:33:03] let me just say this that manifestation
[1:33:05] holy spirit is not will be is not going
[1:33:08] to be is catching away a bride is
[1:33:14] sounds like a rapture going on to me
[1:33:18] what's the rapture going to end in the
[1:33:19] change of my body
[1:33:22] glory
[1:33:24] how many believe that
[1:33:27] the truth
[1:33:29] here we are
[1:33:30] we've arrived
[1:33:33] what's left for the bride to lay in the
[1:33:36] presence of the sun to ripen
[1:33:40] how can you lay in his presence if he
[1:33:42] hasn't here how can you be pregnant with
[1:33:44] life if he hasn't come how are you going
[1:33:45] to have a marriage unless he's come here
[1:33:47] to have a marriage
[1:33:50] the headstone
[1:33:52] i could take we can take just quotes
[1:33:54] after quotes after quote brother i'm
[1:33:57] showing the time the season the
[1:33:58] headstone she's making up the headstone
[1:34:01] the headstones here
[1:34:07] she's been molded through those ages
[1:34:09] right up clear up to the prophet for
[1:34:11] running as john 4 rhonda said i'll
[1:34:13] declare him to you i'll i'll tell you
[1:34:15] and pretty soon he said here he is
[1:34:17] here's the one i talked to you about
[1:34:18] here he is even the picture taken of him
[1:34:20] there right on sunset mountain here he
[1:34:22] is
[1:34:28] the headstones come what's happening
[1:34:30] there's an invisible union that's not
[1:34:31] known to the public it only can be known
[1:34:34] to his elect bride amen
[1:34:37] but he said well what's a different
[1:34:38] preaching because it's got to be
[1:34:39] preached this faith has got to be
[1:34:41] preached
[1:34:42] it's the season it's the hours the time
[1:34:45] and it's separating shock from the true
[1:34:48] wheat
[1:34:51] it's delivering you out of
[1:34:52] denominational darkness
[1:34:56] it's definitely delivering you from
[1:34:57] idolatry
[1:35:01] from some other image beside the true
[1:35:03] word living image
[1:35:10] bowing to another image you're not
[1:35:11] bowing
[1:35:12] those images they want to create they
[1:35:15] could go on and on i could preach in the
[1:35:17] flee idolatry message right now
[1:35:20] anything that comes between you and the
[1:35:22] word being preeminent and dominant and
[1:35:24] and the and the and the deity in your
[1:35:27] life
[1:35:28] is an idol
[1:35:31] bout of that thing i don't care what it
[1:35:32] is
[1:35:33] and god's trying to shake you out of it
[1:35:35] realize
[1:35:37] there's more of this life than your
[1:35:39] games and your videos and everything
[1:35:40] else you've got to play with
[1:35:42] you better get down to business this is
[1:35:44] an urgent message you better hurry up
[1:35:47] because what if the door is shut
[1:35:51] only once he's going to reveal to us
[1:35:53] himself to the bride she's already in
[1:35:57] i'm telling you right now individually
[1:35:59] you were in before the foundation of the
[1:36:01] world
[1:36:04] and it's got to be manifest because that
[1:36:06] word that he decreed will not return to
[1:36:07] him void
[1:36:10] he spoke of his bride he showed it it
[1:36:12] was a hidden mystery of himself a hidden
[1:36:14] thought in his mind
[1:36:15] in the back part of his mind is now
[1:36:18] revealed in the heart of the bride the
[1:36:20] bride has that revelation
[1:36:23] and it's putting her into a body change
[1:36:25] and by that you're coming to more
[1:36:26] testing you're coming to more trials
[1:36:28] you're coming to more you're turning
[1:36:29] more circumstances more pressure more
[1:36:32] this pressure that pressure turn here
[1:36:33] turn there just keep your focus on one
[1:36:36] thing keep your focus on jesus the
[1:36:38] revealed word that is in our midst
[1:36:45] i may preach hard i may preach this way
[1:36:47] but brother sister leave me alone i'm
[1:36:48] having a good time
[1:36:51] you may not like it
[1:36:53] i didn't choose what kind of ministry
[1:36:55] i'd have i didn't choose that god did
[1:36:58] there's one thing i know i love you and
[1:37:00] i love him and i can't love him and not
[1:37:02] love you and i know i love you i love
[1:37:05] you beyond words to express i'm going to
[1:37:07] express it you may not like the way it's
[1:37:09] expressed it neither did they like john
[1:37:11] the baptist when he expressed it
[1:37:15] i'm not saying i'm john the baptist by
[1:37:16] any means i'm just saying that nature it
[1:37:20] does don't you start looking at the
[1:37:21] outside and judging the outside
[1:37:25] start judging the word the truth
[1:37:27] is there a life lived
[1:37:31] amen amen amen amen you know something's
[1:37:34] wrong with that word and you do it
[1:37:36] anyway you are sin you are in sin and
[1:37:39] you're dying
[1:37:40] you just go right on thinking you're all
[1:37:42] right when the word says you're not
[1:37:45] why don't you just humble yourself give
[1:37:47] yourself up to god repent
[1:37:54] confess you're wrong forsake it
[1:37:57] and then the word said
[1:37:59] you'll have mercy
[1:38:04] you're not willing to forsake it you
[1:38:06] want to reason with the devil about it
[1:38:08] well it's okay this is okay it's not
[1:38:11] with people
[1:38:12] you don't have to worry about this that
[1:38:14] just the same old thing he told them to
[1:38:16] leave
[1:38:18] he didn't mean that
[1:38:19] here let me interpret to you what the
[1:38:21] prophet said
[1:38:25] let me tell you
[1:38:27] let me tell you what jesus meant
[1:38:29] don't you accept his own religious
[1:38:31] doctrines
[1:38:36] perfect interpretation of the word by
[1:38:37] divine
[1:38:39] you ask god to reveal it to you
[1:38:45] that's it
[1:38:46] you won't make it right you're not going
[1:38:48] any further
[1:38:50] you're stopped right there
[1:38:53] you're sucking on the wrong filter
[1:38:57] you're going to suck on the filter that
[1:38:58] satisfies the taste in your soul but
[1:39:01] god's given us a filter
[1:39:05] that'll bring in the holy spirit in your
[1:39:07] life
[1:39:08] you can't draw through the word filter
[1:39:10] you can't draw through the message
[1:39:11] filter you won't draw through this word
[1:39:13] filter anything but the holy ghost
[1:39:15] himself to quicken the word in you for
[1:39:17] the season and there's a resurrection
[1:39:22] god has provided this filter why are you
[1:39:24] trying to manufacture and produce
[1:39:25] another one
[1:39:33] you'll hear it
[1:39:34] i may not have another chance
[1:39:39] i know someday i've got to send
[1:39:41] the judgment
[1:39:43] and give testimony for what i said
[1:39:45] and i know i have to answer before him
[1:39:47] at a judgment bar judgment for reward or
[1:39:50] not
[1:39:52] and i know i'm full aware
[1:39:55] i would like to preach a message and
[1:39:56] will the lord willing if you help me i
[1:39:58] want to preach on who are those
[1:40:00] righteous at the white throne judgment
[1:40:01] that are saved
[1:40:05] not the bride bride's already in
[1:40:08] but who are those righteous that he
[1:40:10] separates the sheep from the goat
[1:40:13] what are they where's their place who
[1:40:14] are they and who are those that are cast
[1:40:16] away and taking the name off the book
[1:40:19] what makes them do that
[1:40:21] what produces that judgment
[1:40:23] it's a great mystery and i and it's so
[1:40:26] i just can't hardly stand it i'd like to
[1:40:28] preach it i almost preached it here but
[1:40:29] i just felt checked again
[1:40:31] god has a time if i ever do but you go
[1:40:34] to the sumerian age and read what he
[1:40:36] said
[1:40:39] this bride's name is not only in the
[1:40:41] lamb's book of life she's in a section
[1:40:43] of the book of life
[1:40:45] and that section is the eternal life
[1:40:47] record
[1:40:48] and that name can never be removed from
[1:40:50] it i'm telling you right here he can't
[1:40:52] remove your name from his
[1:40:55] because your name and his is the same
[1:40:57] name

[1:41:05] god help me i've got to get through this
[1:41:06] what time is it okay i've got just a
[1:41:08] little bit more to be to be brother
[1:41:11] david's preaching
[1:41:14] would you rather me take your way of
[1:41:16] preaching your mind or what god showed
[1:41:17] me
[1:41:19] you see what i'm saying it's not even
[1:41:20] mine
[1:41:23] my normal is about an hour and a half
[1:41:24] plus
[1:41:30] now if god don't want that done i
[1:41:31] believe god will stop me
[1:41:33] if he wants it to you have you have
[1:41:35] grace his grace is sufficient
[1:41:39] you're feeding keep feeding
[1:41:41] but you're looking at your time and deny
[1:41:43] yourself
[1:41:47] all right listen to me now
[1:41:52] i believe we've been i believe we've
[1:41:53] grown up over these things brother
[1:41:54] sister
[1:41:56] we've grown up here we've grown up over
[1:41:58] that
[1:42:00] amen
[1:42:01] now let's get back to where i said this
[1:42:03] here i got a little no i didn't
[1:42:06] okay
[1:42:09] the bride was existing in his thoughts
[1:42:12] she was existing already in his mind
[1:42:15] and what about those thoughts of god
[1:42:17] what about those thoughts of his bride
[1:42:20] are they eternal or are they not
[1:42:28] saint john 1 i've already quoted in
[1:42:29] beginning was the word matthew 24 35
[1:42:32] said my word will not pass away
[1:42:35] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:42:37] word shall never pass away
[1:42:40] and you were those thoughts expressed
[1:42:43] and now expressed into a being
[1:42:47] into flesh into a veil behind skin which
[1:42:50] you're just wrapped in and trapped in
[1:42:55] paul said oh
[1:42:57] wicked man that i am
[1:43:00] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:43:02] this corruption
[1:43:04] but i thank god through jesus christ my
[1:43:06] lord
[1:43:08] so the law of his spirit hath made me
[1:43:10] free from the law of sin and death
[1:43:14] think on these things
[1:43:17] amen are you with me all right
[1:43:19] he said that that in me that is in my
[1:43:22] flesh or life no good thing
[1:43:24] so why are you putting confidence in it
[1:43:33] god's trying to get our confidence based
[1:43:34] on one thing
[1:43:36] let's look beyond the curtain of time
[1:43:40] like john did and said there's john
[1:43:43] look beyond the curtain of time
[1:43:46] second corinthians 4 18 said while we
[1:43:49] look not at the things which are seen
[1:43:53] see taste feel smell here the things
[1:43:55] which are seen
[1:43:56] but the things which are not seen
[1:43:59] are eternal for the things which are
[1:44:01] seen are temporal
[1:44:03] temporal
[1:44:04] so my do we put so much emphasis on
[1:44:07] temporal
[1:44:08] when our total emphasis shouldn't be
[1:44:11] anything between me and the word the
[1:44:13] word
[1:44:14] is my eternal
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:18] that's where i judge everything is from
[1:44:20] that little wheel in the middle of the
[1:44:22] wheel
[1:44:27] amen
[1:44:29] let the little wheel do the moving
[1:44:33] not your feelings not your senses
[1:44:36] quit trying to be something you're not
[1:44:39] be what you are
[1:44:41] be what you are on the inside
[1:44:43] don't make a make-believe out of this
[1:44:48] be genuine
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:53] i'm not saying that to scare anybody i'm
[1:44:55] saying you just start looking down here
[1:44:56] on the inside of the inside what are you
[1:45:00] where are you putting your confidence in
[1:45:07] amen i'm i may not get to where i want
[1:45:10] to get here let's go a little bit
[1:45:11] further
[1:45:16] he is omniscient
[1:45:18] he has never had a new thought about
[1:45:20] anything
[1:45:24] he can't change
[1:45:26] what he thought of you
[1:45:30] what he said about you
[1:45:33] he's expressing it right here through a
[1:45:34] prophet
[1:45:38] and
[1:45:38] this what the prophet said brought us
[1:45:40] right back to this
[1:45:41] i
[1:45:42] can't leave it
[1:45:45] you believe that you can't leave it
[1:45:47] the prophet won't leave the word
[1:45:50] amen
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:53] but god's word is of no private
[1:45:55] interpretation but the prophet is not
[1:45:58] the private interpretation it's the word
[1:46:03] interpreting
[1:46:05] you don't believe that
[1:46:06] oh yes
[1:46:08] that's what he said
[1:46:10] that's what the word said
[1:46:12] god of old wrote the scriptures
[1:46:15] how did he write it through men of old
[1:46:17] were moved by the holy ghost
[1:46:20] amen
[1:46:23] they had god's interpretation of the
[1:46:26] word
[1:46:30] i know there's somebody here doesn't
[1:46:31] believe that but i don't care it's the
[1:46:33] truth
[1:46:35] amen
[1:46:37] amen whether they believe it or not
[1:46:40] all right now
[1:46:44] those thoughts
[1:46:46] of god are eternal they are real they
[1:46:48] are not simply like a man with a
[1:46:49] blueprint
[1:46:51] that is drawn up which will someday be
[1:46:53] translated into substance and form but
[1:46:55] they are already real and eternal and
[1:46:58] they're part of god
[1:47:02] amen
[1:47:04] it is the groom who decides and chooses
[1:47:07] a certain woman for his bride
[1:47:09] saint john 15 16 you have not chosen me
[1:47:12] but i've chosen you now according to the
[1:47:14] word the bride was chosen before the
[1:47:16] foundation of the world the choosing of
[1:47:18] the bride was purpose in himself we read
[1:47:21] it ephesians 1 9.
[1:47:23] psalm 139 15 and 16 will give you a
[1:47:26] little idea of this my substance mean my
[1:47:29] substance you was not hid from thee when
[1:47:31] i was made in secret and curiously
[1:47:34] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth

[1:47:38] being imperfect and thy and in thy book
[1:47:40] were all my members written
[1:47:42] which in continuance was fashioned as
[1:47:44] yet
[1:47:45] there was none of them
[1:47:48] so the thought was there in his mind
[1:47:50] that thought was eternal and had to be
[1:47:52] expressed
[1:47:54] when he created adam was formed in the
[1:47:56] dust the earth his spiritual being was
[1:47:58] created being created by god then adam
[1:48:01] became god sought express and those
[1:48:04] eternal thoughts were now manifested

[2:14:23] that i know i'm a part of that amen
[2:14:31] look
[2:14:32] look he says
[2:14:33] before their creation there has to be a
[2:14:35] creator blessed are they which do hunger
[2:14:37] and thirst after righteousness see
[2:14:38] there's something in us you raised your
[2:14:40] hand a while ago i want more of god how
[2:14:43] many want more of god
[2:14:46] i didn't see it my every hand ought to
[2:14:48] be up here
[2:14:49] you want more of god well you say
[2:14:51] brother david i want more of god then
[2:14:53] obey what he said do first
[2:14:57] all right you want me to come down the
[2:14:59] line a little further
[2:15:00] why won't you take communion
[2:15:02] when it's command of god to do so three
[2:15:04] things he left us
[2:15:06] three things
[2:15:09] water baptism
[2:15:11] foot washing communion
[2:15:13] three ordinances if you won't keep those
[2:15:15] ordinances you have no part with the
[2:15:16] tree of life if you won't take communion
[2:15:19] it's a showdown
[2:15:21] it shows you have no part with him
[2:15:27] if you don't have the holy spirit you
[2:15:29] take that baptism or excuse me i
[2:15:31] communion unworthy i'm talking about the
[2:15:33] lord's supper and you take it unworthily
[2:15:35] you bring damnation upon yourself you go
[2:15:37] out of here saying that you communion
[2:15:38] with god and go out and live another
[2:15:40] life
[2:15:43] unworthily
[2:15:45] but when you're filled with the holy
[2:15:46] ghost brother ram said you shouldn't
[2:15:47] even take communion until you're born
[2:15:49] again
[2:15:52] now go look and see what he said
[2:15:58] future home
[2:16:00] other places
[2:16:02] but he said it's a showdown communion
[2:16:03] 1965 it's a showdown if you don't take
[2:16:06] it you have no part with him
[2:16:09] you're showing it
[2:16:10] and if you take it unworthily you bring
[2:16:12] damnation upon yourself
[2:16:14] so you see what place it puts you in
[2:16:17] it's a command of god and you say i
[2:16:18] believe the prophet's message i believe
[2:16:20] message and do what he said
[2:16:23] this due in remembrance of me
[2:16:26] brother braham said this is a sacred
[2:16:27] thing we come here with a sure assurance
[2:16:29] of where we stand in christ that we are
[2:16:31] partakers
[2:16:34] and you won't do that
[2:16:36] you're not born again
[2:16:38] and if you are born again you never knew
[2:16:40] it before now you do
[2:16:46] i'm sorry if that hurts your feelings
[2:16:48] nobody's hurting your feelings it's love
[2:16:50] projected
[2:16:52] it's the light across your pathway now
[2:16:54] you can either reject it or accept it
[2:16:57] that's up to you
[2:17:01] i'm not telling you how often but you're
[2:17:02] not taking it when he commanded you to
[2:17:04] do so how can you say you love him and
[2:17:06] won't keep his commandments
[2:17:12] all right phew
[2:17:15] okay
[2:17:18] if you love the world going out that way
[2:17:20] and the things of the world the world's
[2:17:22] travel you'll go and in the fall you'll
[2:17:24] be come out your sons and daughters of
[2:17:26] the king the king be lady and gentlemen
[2:17:28] walk like christians live like
[2:17:29] christians act like christians look in
[2:17:31] your looking glass tonight see which way
[2:17:33] am i headed is jesus preparing a place
[2:17:36] for me a body
[2:17:37] the body that body is perfect that body
[2:17:39] walks ordinally orderly it's a son or
[2:17:42] daughter of god before god
[2:17:44] and i'm
[2:17:45] i and i'm in birth pains in here to be
[2:17:49] born into that body there
[2:17:52] if i still love the world it shows that
[2:17:55] i'm not i have no body there i'm just a
[2:17:57] church member i wasn't the germ of god
[2:17:59] i'm not he's not my father
[2:18:02] you see what he's saying
[2:18:04] all right
[2:18:05] and so is it in the spiritual realm it's
[2:18:07] water justification by faith believing
[2:18:09] god receiving him as your personal
[2:18:11] savior repentance see and being baptized
[2:18:13] second sanctification of the spirit that
[2:18:15] god cleanses the spirit from all
[2:18:17] elements of the world and the desires of
[2:18:19] the world and then the holy spirit comes
[2:18:21] in and gives a new birth and fills up
[2:18:23] that sanctified vessel
[2:18:25] if you want to go read about that
[2:18:27] justification you go read romans 5 1-7
[2:18:30] we live by faith not sight
[2:18:35] time to read these second corinthians go

[2:19:18] through this trials and tests too
[2:19:20] contradiction of sinners contradiction
[2:19:22] of unbelievers claiming to be in the
[2:19:24] message but unbelief
[2:19:28] we are putting it we carry these things
[2:19:30] brother sister we're pressured by these
[2:19:32] things why it's a part of
[2:19:35] our going home
[2:19:38] all right
[2:19:39] you say oh i don't i don't believe god

[2:19:42] take all that away from me and and i
[2:19:44] just live a happy-go-lucky no i'm sorry
[2:19:45] you don't know my lord
[2:19:49] i don't have to have pain suffering i
[2:19:50] didn't say you have to receive it and
[2:19:52] hold it i'm saying but you're going to
[2:19:53] suffer
[2:19:56] amen go back and read church age book
[2:19:58] page 116-119
[2:20:00] and see what he said i don't have time
[2:20:02] to read it this morning
[2:20:06] and see if there's not suffering for the
[2:20:07] individual believer
[2:20:12] and if you're going to be birthed you're
[2:20:13] going to give birth into a new body
[2:20:14] there's going to be suffering there's
[2:20:16] going to be travail there's going to be
[2:20:17] contractions and the contractions are
[2:20:19] going to come and they're going to seem
[2:20:20] awful hard and they're going to
[2:20:21] disappear and you say why praise the
[2:20:23] lord and then the other one comes and
[2:20:25] it's harder
[2:20:27] and then why my it lets up and then
[2:20:29] another one comes it's harder than ever
[2:20:32] how many know that's happening
[2:20:34] you wonder why every day there's
[2:20:36] pressures you hear this you'd and and
[2:20:38] then and then the politics and then the
[2:20:40] the world and and this covet and this
[2:20:43] that and something else you're bombarded
[2:20:45] and bombarded and bombarded
[2:20:49] you don't have to listen to it
[2:20:52] amen
[2:20:54] but you're what's happening you're just
[2:20:56] under pressure oppression the devil's
[2:20:58] trying to do his best you see this old
[2:21:01] man raises up and you you reason with
[2:21:03] this and that and something else just
[2:21:05] stay steady people press in
[2:21:08] keep your focus
[2:21:09] press in press in with the reality and
[2:21:11] revelation of who you are and if you
[2:21:13] don't know ask god to reveal it to you
[2:21:18] feed on his word don't let these other
[2:21:20] things come in it's too late
[2:21:22] i know you got to go to work and they
[2:21:24] say i'm not talking about that but when
[2:21:25] you have opportunity
[2:21:30] amen
[2:21:31] amen it's urgent i'm making it urgent it
[2:21:35] is urgent
[2:21:40] you have birth pains here to be born
[2:21:42] into that body
[2:21:43] and so is the spiritual realm it's water
[2:21:45] justification by faith believing on god
[2:21:47] receiving a personal savior being
[2:21:48] baptized second see all these things and
[2:21:51] god cleanses the spiritual elements of
[2:21:53] the world all right i really quoted that
[2:21:55] excuse me that's the same thing in new
[2:21:58] birth we never go back we go forward
[2:22:00] when you're born again
[2:22:02] you never go back you go forward
[2:22:05] so many so many i think so many rather
[2:22:08] genuine new births we don't have too
[2:22:10] many genuine new verses because the seed
[2:22:12] maybe will sympathize with the word
[2:22:15] or the person but they don't want to rot
[2:22:18] away from the old system they're in they
[2:22:20] don't want to come out of it they want
[2:22:23] to stay in the old system and claim the
[2:22:25] new birth
[2:22:26] the message of the the new birth the
[2:22:28] message of the age
[2:22:34] if the doctor went to an examine a
[2:22:36] patient and it was in labor one of the
[2:22:39] first things the doctor would do which
[2:22:40] i'm talking in the presence of two or
[2:22:42] three i know of good medical doctors
[2:22:44] and i would ask this one of the first
[2:22:46] things the doctor does after it's been
[2:22:48] watching the patient is the time the
[2:22:49] pains
[2:22:50] birth pains he times the pains how close
[2:22:53] are they are together how much more
[2:22:54] terrific each one gets
[2:22:56] one is more harder than the other one
[2:22:58] and next one still harder gets closer
[2:23:00] closer spiritual
[2:23:02] contractions you wonder why where did
[2:23:05] that thought come from why am i going
[2:23:07] through this
[2:23:08] the devil's right there to give you an
[2:23:10] answer
[2:23:11] but the word's given you the answer
[2:23:13] that's what god knows you're coming down
