[28:40] couple of Sioux Saints if I could I just
[28:44] wanted to read a scripture if that's
[28:46] okay I was just reading this a few days
[28:50] ago when it touched me Psalm 91 I think
[28:53] it's very fitting for what we're going
[28:55] through
[28:58] yeah Psalm 91 verse 1 and it says he did
[29:02] wealth in a secret place of the Most
[29:04] High shall abide under the shadow of all
[29:06] of the Almighty I will say of the Lord
[29:09] he is my refuge and my fortress my god
[29:12] in him I will trust surely he shall
[29:15] deliver thee from the snare of the
[29:18] Fowler and from the noisome pestilence
[29:22] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[29:24] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[29:30] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[29:32] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[29:35] of night out there by night nor for the
[29:39] arrow that flieth by day nor for the
[29:42] pestilence that walketh in darkness nor
[29:45] for the destruction that wasteth at
[29:48] noonday
[29:49] at Thousand shall fall at thy side and
[29:52] ten thousand at thy right hand but it
[29:56] shall not come nigh be only with thine
[29:59] eyes shalt thou behold and see the
[30:00] reward of the wicked because thou has
[30:03] made the Lord which is my refuge even
[30:08] the most high the habitation there shall
[30:12] no evil befall thee neither shall any
[30:14] plague the plague come nigh thy dwelling
[30:18] for he shall give his angels charge over
[30:21] thee to keep thee in all thy ways they
[30:25] shall bear thee up in their hands lest
[30:27] thou dash thy foot against a stone
[30:30] thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder
[30:34] a young lion and the dragon shall doubt
[30:37] trample under feet because he has set
[30:40] his love upon me therefore will I
[30:42] deliver him I will set him on high
[30:44] because he had known
[30:46] name he shall call upon me and I will
[30:49] answer him I will be with him in trouble
[30:52] I will deliver him and honor him with
[30:55] long life will i satisfy him and show
[30:58] him my salvation will Saints legisla

[38:37] normal
[38:40] [Music]
[38:50] Oh
[39:02] my god
[39:04] [Music]
[39:32] open our supership
[39:41] to be privy to your throne
[39:49] Oh
[39:56] normal
[40:00] the whole car hello babe
[40:09] you're the brain
[40:14] the reason man my god
[40:23] [Music]
[40:30] amens good to be in the house of the
[40:32] Lord today and just to be able to come
[40:36] and worship him once again and while we
[40:40] are not here you might say in the
[40:43] physical body together we are here in
[40:47] the spirit and the Spirit of the Lord to
[40:50] be able to come and worship the Lord
[40:53] together today and I think that's a
[40:55] beautiful beautiful thing the Lord's
[40:58] given us I just want to encourage
[41:01] everyone to follow the website to look
[41:06] for any announcements that would be
[41:08] there so if you are wondering what
[41:12] schedules might be or or anything that
[41:17] would be coming up just go to Grace
[41:21] Nampa dot org obviously if you're
[41:23] streaming you you know that and don't
[41:27] hesitate to call or text prayer requests
[41:30] other needs brother Ivan brother Jason
[41:33] myself just send off a phone call a text
[41:38] something if if you need some help or
[41:42] have a question amen we I talked to a
[41:45] brother George yesterday and as much as
[41:47] we would love to have him come if he did
[41:49] come he would just be speaking to you
[41:53] through the live streaming and so we
[41:55] thought it would be best to have him
[41:57] come when we can enjoy him in person
[41:59] plus it wouldn't be fair of us to
[42:02] impress upon him to have to travel at
[42:05] this time so we're just going to work on
[42:10] having brother George come back when all
[42:13] of this comes back to normal
[42:14] amen god bless you thank you so much
[42:18] this morning amen the challenge of doing
[42:22] things differently is actually good for
[42:24] us I think makes us kind of grow a
[42:26] little bit and so that's that's a
[42:29] wonderful thing amen
[42:31] so God's blessings to each and every one
[42:34] of you Saints we we certainly love you
[42:37] and would prefer to be right here
[42:40] together
[42:40] the
[42:41] this morning but we just take this time
[42:44] and do what the Lord lays upon our
[42:46] hearts and I want to speak to you this
[42:48] morning on these presents distractions
[42:51] and there's a season here that we will
[42:55] find that there's a lot of distraction
[42:57] around us the the world my brother and
[43:00] sister is caught up in all kinds of
[43:03] things we we have people believing
[43:06] declaring that this is this is something
[43:09] the Chinese have done to us but my
[43:12] brother and sister it's not a conspiracy
[43:15] it's not a warfare yet you know a lot of
[43:18] things are going to change it's true
[43:20] they're going to change currencies if
[43:22] they can they're going to take advantage
[43:24] of the people put them back under
[43:26] bondage if they can but my brother and
[43:29] sister to the bride of Jesus Christ this
[43:31] is nothing more than a distraction and
[43:33] the more we focus on that the more we're
[43:36] distracted from something else and so
[43:38] the Word of God will come to pass that's
[43:41] one thing we know for certain I believe
[43:43] we can all say amen to that that the
[43:45] word will come to pass and so these
[43:47] things that we see around us whether
[43:49] they're conspiracy or not is irrelevant
[43:52] the bride has the word she is becoming
[43:55] the word and so as the word is unfolded
[43:59] the bride responds to that and as
[44:02] brother Branham taught us my brother and
[44:04] sister in the sermon I always get the
[44:06] title a little mixed up in the sermon
[44:08] actions as how I always remember it but
[44:12] you know my brother and sister every
[44:14] time that we take a step forward and do
[44:18] an action God brings a reaction you say
[44:20] amen to the word you're saying so be it
[44:23] so then that releases the power of the
[44:26] word you said amen to and and you move
[44:28] forward into that and so that is what a
[44:31] God has called us today so if we would
[44:34] just stand this morning and just respect
[44:36] to God's word want to turn to Joshua 23
[44:40] 1 through 8 and we'll just take our
[44:43] thought from that this morning because
[44:45] just by God's grace we'll we'll just
[44:48] take a little vision here of these
[44:53] present distract
[44:54] and placed these things in the right
[44:57] context for for us amen Joshua 23 verses
[45:03] 1 through 8 and it came to pass a long
[45:07] time after that the Lord had given rest
[45:10] unto Israel from all their enemies round
[45:12] about that Joshua waxed old and stricken
[45:16] in age and Joshua called for all Israel
[45:20] and for the elders their elders and for
[45:24] their heads and for their judges and for
[45:26] their officers and said unto them I am
[45:28] old and stricken in age and ye have seen
[45:32] all that the Lord your God hath done and
[45:35] to all these nations because of you
[45:37] for the Lord your God is he that hath
[45:40] fought for you behold I have divided
[45:44] unto you by law these nations that
[45:47] remain to be an inheritance for your
[45:50] tribes from Jordan with all the nations
[45:53] that I've cut off even unto the Great
[45:55] Sea westward and the Lord your God he
[45:59] shall expel them from before you and
[46:01] drive them out of your sight and ye
[46:04] shall possess their land as the Lord
[46:07] your God has promised unto you be
[46:09] therefore very courageous to keep and do
[46:13] all that is written in the book of the
[46:15] law of Moses that ye turn not aside
[46:18] therefrom to the right hand or to the
[46:21] left that G come not among those nations
[46:24] these that remain among you neither make
[46:27] mention of the name of their gods
[46:30] neither cause to swear by them neither
[46:33] serve them nor bow yourselves unto them
[46:36] but cleave unto the Lord your God as you
[46:40] have done unto this day Heavenly Father
[46:44] we just ask Lord for blessing upon your
[46:47] word Lord as the Saints are in their
[46:49] homes today father just asked Lord that
[46:52] you would just come and meet them father
[46:55] where they are at father may we be
[46:58] joined in spirit this morning Lord as
[47:01] though we were here in the house of God
[47:03] father - to rejoice to partake
[47:08] father of your word today Lord if the
[47:11] word brings correction Lord let us
[47:13] receive correction as it brings blessing
[47:15] let us rejoice and say Amen to the word
[47:18] father ask for your guiding hand of
[47:20] mercy today in the name of Jesus Christ
[47:23] you may be seated
[47:25] amen you know I'm just looking and then
[47:29] the world we live in
[47:30] today there's you know all kinds of
[47:32] definitions and different online
[47:34] dictionaries and all kinds of
[47:37] interpretations of words but this
[47:40] morning I just want to just take a basic
[47:43] description of the word distract is to
[47:46] take attention away from someone or
[47:48] something and direct it to someone or
[47:51] something else and we look in the world
[47:53] we live in today that certainly Satan is
[47:56] doing his very best to distract us and
[47:59] he is presenting all kinds of things
[48:02] around us now my brother and sister we
[48:04] are human God made us this way so he
[48:06] understands humans and we are here today
[48:10] some might be worried about their
[48:12] economics and some are worried about
[48:14] their health and and all kinds of
[48:16] different things that that is being
[48:18] taken place some you know their jobs are
[48:22] going away because that they can't go to
[48:25] work and some you know it is something
[48:28] else but basically we can look at this
[48:31] and realize that one of Satan's tactics
[48:33] is to distract us from our real job or
[48:37] real calling that God has in or life
[48:40] today and so if we get too distracted
[48:43] too worried about all these things
[48:45] around us we will have a tendency as
[48:48] humans to draw our attention from what
[48:51] it should be place it somewhere else and
[48:53] you know this would be a something of
[48:56] contention maybe and I don't mean it in
[48:58] that sense but my brother and sister
[49:00] most of us would do well to not trying
[49:03] to multitask it's hard to immerse
[49:05] ourself into all of the world and think
[49:08] that we can serve God and still be
[49:11] immersed in the world no my brother and
[49:13] sister we need to focus the scripture
[49:16] doesn't tell us seek you first a good
[49:19] job and then you'll be able to help the
[49:21] church
[49:21] the scripture tells us seek you first
[49:23] the kingdom of God that's our first
[49:26] priority it's the very top it is the
[49:29] climax of what we would be focused on
[49:32] and so as we seek you first the kingdom
[49:35] of God then all of these other things
[49:38] shall be added unto you and so we don't
[49:41] want to try and turn the recipe around
[49:43] we don't want to try and say well Lord
[49:45] in this day it's different two
[49:47] priorities are different my brother and
[49:49] sister God's priorities or God's
[49:51] priorities and they last through the
[49:53] ages so as we look at that let's just I
[49:56] just would call your attention to this
[49:59] that we would not get too caught up by
[50:02] the distractions of this world and make
[50:04] sure we stay focused on what God has
[50:07] called us to these are unprecedented
[50:09] times there is no doubt about that
[50:11] we my brother and sister are seeing
[50:14] incredible things happening as in some
[50:18] cases you might say nerve-racking things
[50:20] that are happening but my brother and
[50:22] sister this is what it is to taste and
[50:26] see the unfolding of the word in our day
[50:30] now no age has ever been easy my brother
[50:34] and sister you look maka the Saints on
[50:36] the day of Pentecost they didn't just
[50:40] have it easy and got the Holy Ghost and
[50:43] went on there was struggle and there was
[50:45] travail the Dark Ages had tremendous
[50:47] struggle and travail and yet the prophet
[50:50] of God points to or brings our attention
[50:53] to the fact that when persecution comes
[50:55] upon the church comes upon the Bride of
[50:57] Christ that that is the time that the
[51:00] church actually flourishes so in weak
[51:04] have a comfort zone we tend to settle
[51:07] into that so we're coming into a time
[51:09] unprecedented time to experience these
[51:13] things but my brother and sister what
[51:15] we're also seeing is the word coming to
[51:18] pass being fulfilled in and you might
[51:21] say a greater fashion or a quicker
[51:23] fashion than ever before because the
[51:26] word will come to pass and so this right
[51:29] here this plague as it would be pandemic
[51:32] they call it of this virus
[51:35] brother and sister I believe is just a
[51:37] foretaste of what is going to befall
[51:40] this earth and so I say thank you Lord
[51:43] and a reason to be focused is because my
[51:47] brother and sister this will become the
[51:49] norm hallelujah
[51:53] it seems extraordinary and unprecedented
[51:55] now but it will become the norm because
[51:58] the scripture says that plague shall
[52:00] come upon the earth in the latter day so
[52:03] we look at this my brother and sister
[52:05] how tremendous this is and I would say
[52:09] because of the technology the internet
[52:12] all of this that most of us by now have
[52:15] heard or seen quotes of brother
[52:19] branham's words concerning germ warfare
[52:21] and these kind of things and and what I
[52:24] want to just touch on this morning my
[52:26] brother and sister is one we see how
[52:29] that these things are coming to pass but
[52:32] you know sometimes it's going to become
[52:34] a reality for it to really affect us in
[52:36] God's provided way of healing brother
[52:39] Branham says here let me pass something
[52:41] here quickly as our times are going
[52:44] listen did you know the Bible predicts
[52:46] in the last days that there'll be a germ
[52:49] warfare so my brother and sister if the
[52:52] Chinese did it if the Russians did it if
[52:54] we did it in the United States meaning
[52:56] my brother and sister it's irrelevant
[52:58] the Bible as brother brown lasers
[53:01] predicts it in the last days so this
[53:04] will happen regardless of who they say
[53:07] is responsible you know everybody says
[53:10] this come from some Chinese guy eating a
[53:12] half cooked bat my brother and sister it
[53:14] doesn't matter what it came from the
[53:17] Bible predicts it to happen so it will
[53:20] come that diseases will break out upon
[53:23] the people and will fall on everyone
[53:25] without the baptism of the holy spirit
[53:28] but with the angel or who had charged
[53:30] over these plagues was given orders to
[53:33] touch no one in whom the mark was why
[53:36] how much kind of teachers why let me go
[53:39] back here why how much kind of teachers
[53:42] have we got to be brethren to get the
[53:45] church in order to be in that condition
[53:48] and I want to put a pause here the
[53:52] church in order to be in that condition
[53:54] immune amen you see the preaching of the
[54:00] word will bring the church into a
[54:02] condition that she is immune now we can
[54:06] go down and we can get a shot in the arm
[54:08] and if you'll go right here in God's
[54:10] provided way of healing and go into the
[54:13] next paragraph or two you'll see how
[54:15] brother Branham is talking about he is
[54:17] standing there with a sore shoulder
[54:18] because of all the shots they just give
[54:21] him to go overseas now I want to just
[54:24] kind of break out on this for just a
[54:26] moment my brother and sister if I could
[54:28] we'll just hold the quote up on the
[54:30] screen but you look at this my brother
[54:32] and sister that diseases would break out
[54:34] upon the people and will follow on
[54:36] everyone without the baptism of the Holy
[54:38] Spirit
[54:39] you see we got to be careful if we focus
[54:42] on the disease we've missed the point
[54:45] the point was not to be concerned about
[54:49] the disease the focus was on the Holy
[54:52] Ghost not the virus amen so there's a
[54:56] prophet of God is laying this out he
[54:58] shows us it will break out upon the
[55:00] people and it will fall on everyone my
[55:03] brother and sister that's a pretty clear
[55:06] declaration in my mind net that it will
[55:09] fall upon everyone but with angel or who
[55:12] had charge over the plagues as given
[55:14] orders to touch no one on whom the mark
[55:17] was now Philippians 3 and 14 we'll go
[55:20] there for just a second now I press
[55:23] toward the mark for the prize of the
[55:26] high calling of God in Christ Jesus you
[55:30] see in Philippians 4 I mean 3:14 here my
[55:34] brother and sisters are pressing for the
[55:36] fullness of the Holy Ghost people get
[55:39] the idea my brother and sister that we
[55:41] get the Holy Ghost I've got the Holy
[55:43] Ghost that's all there is there's no
[55:45] more but my brother and sister the
[55:47] prophet of God teaches us that there is
[55:49] a greater in filling in other words we
[55:52] can be anointed and remember the brother
[55:54] Branham put it I guess I call it the
[55:55] sliding scale he said you can be
[55:57] anointed on the flesh all the days of
[56:00] your life and go to
[56:01] hell so there was annoying thing that
[56:03] only made it to the flash level and we
[56:06] can have the Holy Ghost but we must have
[56:08] many reef fillings and as often as we
[56:11] refill it will determine how full we are
[56:14] of the Holy Ghost so if we can go for
[56:17] days weeks and months and not really
[56:19] refill it my brother and sister you're
[56:22] not going to be in a position to say
[56:24] well I'm completely full of the Holy
[56:26] Ghost but you will look and realize as I
[56:28] have used this analogy for years and I
[56:30] maintain that is accurate that the Holy
[56:34] Ghost is gasoline to the believer as gas
[56:37] is to the car and so if you don't fill
[56:40] it up it will run out and so you'll see
[56:43] sometimes in the lives of believers that
[56:47] they will will kind of get caught up in
[56:49] things of life and you you can tell in
[56:52] their approach sitting in the house of
[56:55] God how they conduct life you can see
[56:57] that something is dwindling away there's
[57:00] no longer an enthusiasm not a fire there
[57:03] not an amen for the word but it's just
[57:06] coming that they're just existing
[57:08] they're struggling maybe not trying to
[57:10] maintain we weren't called to just try
[57:13] to maintain my brother and sister we
[57:15] were called as the overcomer
[57:17] and I hope you can say amen to that so
[57:19] it's there he gave orders to touch no
[57:21] one on whom the mark was and we know now
[57:24] as we look at this that the Holy Ghost
[57:26] the mark of the high price a high mark
[57:30] for the prize of the high calling of God
[57:31] in Christ Jesus so our focus now
[57:35] remember as we have touched I didn't
[57:37] preach that here so it's kind of just
[57:38] some references I made but my brother
[57:40] and sister you see when our focus that
[57:43] when you focus on something you can't be
[57:45] looking in the other direction and be
[57:46] focusing on something else and so our
[57:49] focus and our action is the prophet of
[57:51] God speaks he he talks about an action
[57:54] he was talking about people stepping out
[57:56] claiming their healing and as they
[57:58] stepped out into the aisles and stepped
[58:00] to the altar he's talking about how
[58:03] their action will bring a reaction and
[58:07] so when you press to the mark of the
[58:09] high calling that is an action and it
[58:12] must bring a
[58:14] the action God will not watch you press
[58:17] and not reward you as it were for that
[58:20] pressing but as you press into the mark
[58:22] of the high calling the filling of the
[58:24] Holy Ghost we become stronger and
[58:26] stronger and stronger in the word amen
[58:29] now look brother branham in the end of
[58:31] this quote he says why how much kind of
[58:36] teachers have we got to be brethren to
[58:39] get the church in order to be in that
[58:41] condition you see it's not going to be
[58:45] just a simple God sent a prophet if you
[58:49] believe God sent a prophet you've got it
[58:51] covered
[58:52] our teaching at this stage of the
[58:54] message should be far beyond my brother
[58:57] and sister God sent a prophet should be
[58:59] what we're speaking to the unbeliever
[59:01] who's searching and hungry for something
[59:04] more but when we have people who have
[59:06] said in church for years and the message
[59:10] that they're being given day by day God
[59:12] sent a prophet just believe that my
[59:15] brother and sister they're setting these
[59:17] people up for a great disappointment
[59:19] because you see the Holy Ghost my
[59:22] brother and sister is what is going to
[59:25] make us immune to this world not only
[59:29] these diseases and viruses and whatever
[59:32] but immune to the spirits and of all of
[59:35] these I won't go into it this morning
[59:36] but all of these spirits that are here
[59:39] in the world that are fighting against
[59:43] the bride of Jesus Christ all of those
[59:45] if we want to be immune it's going to
[59:47] take something where we dig into the
[59:50] word and not just that this kind of to
[59:52] the preachers right here amen this would
[59:55] be you know to our ministry amen why how
[59:58] much kind of teachers have we got to be
[1:00:01] we can't just be some slacks lawful you
[1:00:04] know just easy does it want to make
[1:00:06] everybody happy my brother and sister
[1:00:09] we're not going to make everybody happy
[1:00:10] we can't make everybody happy I don't
[1:00:14] remember which one of those old
[1:00:16] ministers that there's quotes out there
[1:00:18] about but it might even have been
[1:00:20] Spurgeon that said it that if you go to
[1:00:24] church and you don't offend someone you
[1:00:25] haven't really preached
[1:00:28] you think about it amen this two edged
[1:00:31] sword can't come in our presence and Pat
[1:00:34] us on the back that's not what the
[1:00:36] two-edged sword is about the two edged
[1:00:38] sword is to cut away every little thing
[1:00:41] of the spirits of the age that's trying
[1:00:43] to connect itself to us that two-edged
[1:00:46] sword is there to trim that back off
[1:00:48] amen so it's there but we need to be we
[1:00:51] need to have we need to follow we need
[1:00:53] to support the kind of teachers that
[1:00:55] would bring us to the place that would
[1:00:58] get the church in order to be in that
[1:01:00] condition immune Satan wants to distract
[1:01:04] us from that he wants to tell us now
[1:01:07] Saints I believe this I believe in
[1:01:09] preaching an encouraging message and I
[1:01:11] believe all the years that I've pastored
[1:01:13] here then I I believe I can make the
[1:01:15] claim that I preached an encouraging
[1:01:17] message but my brother and sister there
[1:01:19] comes a time that we need to call white
[1:01:21] white and black black and we need to
[1:01:23] come down and settle these things
[1:01:24] because it's not about us sitting here
[1:01:27] as some big happy church it's us being
[1:01:29] ready and being immune to the spirits of
[1:01:33] this age to the diseases and viruses of
[1:01:37] this day this is what our purpose is
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:41] not just to say there's a church in our
[1:01:43] community and and stand upon that alone
[1:01:47] now the times that we're living in there
[1:01:50] are different times they're difficult
[1:01:52] times you know brother Brown talks about
[1:01:55] it we have in our midst of our church
[1:01:57] those that have saw this we have got
[1:02:00] generations actually still on the earth
[1:02:02] now even all these years later from
[1:02:04] brother Branham that bet they're quite
[1:02:06] old aged right now but they have gone
[1:02:08] from horse and buggy to this space age
[1:02:10] the prophet of God talks about that
[1:02:13] probably the greatest time in history of
[1:02:16] mankind that man went from the horse and
[1:02:20] buggy to being there to see a spaceship
[1:02:24] going into outer space and you look at
[1:02:27] that and realize what's going on now my
[1:02:29] brother and sister we have all kinds of
[1:02:31] things that are happening in the day and
[1:02:33] age that we're living in everything
[1:02:35] that's done in the physical has
[1:02:36] something in the spiritual and my
[1:02:39] brother and sister we've got now I've
[1:02:41] referenced
[1:02:41] this before it's it's kind of in
[1:02:44] incredible stuff I just saw reference to
[1:02:46] it again the other day that they are now
[1:02:48] doing this hologram projection I don't
[1:02:52] remember the right words but you know
[1:02:53] they could literally project an image
[1:02:56] that would look like this here and you
[1:03:00] wouldn't even see me could totally block
[1:03:02] me out then just to projecting an image
[1:03:04] and you look at that and they're
[1:03:06] thinking how is developed or why it was
[1:03:08] developed was for warfare how many
[1:03:11] soldiers could could then proceed to you
[1:03:15] know assault or advance on something and
[1:03:18] somehow an image would be projected out
[1:03:21] there that looked just like the trees
[1:03:22] the graphs or whatever that was already
[1:03:24] there now I want to bring just a small
[1:03:26] reference my brother and sister when you
[1:03:29] take that kind of idea and put it back
[1:03:31] into the spiritual world Satan is here
[1:03:34] is part of his distraction as he is
[1:03:37] getting people to project an image that
[1:03:40] they are Christians when behind that
[1:03:43] image is not a Christian life it is not
[1:03:46] a Christian behavior not a Christian
[1:03:48] atmosphere all this is always a tinder
[1:03:51] subject not a Christian a dressing dress
[1:03:55] code now my brother and sister the
[1:03:57] prophet of God he speaks very clearly
[1:03:59] that if you don't touch on the clothes
[1:04:01] line religion you're not preaching the
[1:04:03] gospel well we don't beat on that but it
[1:04:05] ought to be something that we would pay
[1:04:07] attention to amen so we don't want to
[1:04:10] say we're Christians and behind that
[1:04:12] image be something that does not line up
[1:04:15] with the word and so as you look Satan's
[1:04:18] distraction and we're coming and we're
[1:04:20] watching we're seeing these things being
[1:04:22] manifested is that we're seeing the
[1:04:24] church becoming worldly but yet
[1:04:27] projecting an image that they are Christ
[1:04:30] chosen my brother and sister these two
[1:04:32] things will not reconcile the church
[1:04:34] cannot be worldly and be Christian
[1:04:38] period
[1:04:40] there's no way to project the world and
[1:04:42] project Christ at the same time so as we
[1:04:46] look at this we'll see the times that
[1:04:47] we're living now in Romans 8:14 we will
[1:04:51] see here my brother and sister how that
[1:04:53] God would bring things in
[1:04:55] such a way that it would dis cut out you
[1:04:57] might say the wiggle room that we would
[1:05:00] come and say well I'm a Christian but I
[1:05:03] I've got this other issue or I've got
[1:05:05] now we have issues but when we give it
[1:05:08] over to Christ we should fully give it
[1:05:10] over to Christ
[1:05:11] now romans 8:14 said for as many as are
[1:05:14] led by the Spirit of God they are the
[1:05:18] sons of God so this would show us very
[1:05:21] clearly that if a person is led by the
[1:05:24] Spirit they will produce what is defined
[1:05:29] as a son of God
[1:05:32] the Spirit of God cannot produce
[1:05:34] something else it can only produce
[1:05:37] itself now remember we shared this last
[1:05:40] few services we shared my brother and
[1:05:43] sister the DNA the engrafted now if God
[1:05:48] is truth and we are of his DNA then what
[1:05:52] we will produce the word proves his
[1:05:55] truth the word produces truth we're
[1:05:57] engrafted into the word amen we're the
[1:06:00] firstfruits well then we will be nothing
[1:06:03] but truth so the Spirit of God then they
[1:06:06] are the sons of God that will produce
[1:06:09] the life of God for you have not
[1:06:12] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:06:14] fear but you have received the spirit of
[1:06:17] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father now
[1:06:21] this spirit of adoption my brother and
[1:06:23] sister is what the Holy Ghost bringing
[1:06:26] Liberty the mark of the high calling in
[1:06:28] our life my brother and sister is also
[1:06:31] you might say the sign of having
[1:06:33] received the spirit of adoption because
[1:06:35] we're no longer than bound by this yoke
[1:06:39] of bondage the spirit of bondage that
[1:06:41] spirit of bondage is where fear is
[1:06:43] coming it's being injected now I know
[1:06:46] this might be a little direct but my
[1:06:48] brother and sister if you are sitting
[1:06:50] here today and you are sitting under a
[1:06:52] spirit of fear this is not just fear but
[1:06:56] Satan is trying to bring you to a
[1:06:58] bondage now you say well well you know I
[1:07:02] wouldn't let the devil put me in bondage
[1:07:04] but if you have fear he's already
[1:07:07] putting this yoke
[1:07:08] papania amen but you have received the
[1:07:11] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[1:07:14] Father the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:07:16] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:07:19] of God and if children then heirs heirs
[1:07:22] of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so
[1:07:25] be that we suffer with him that we may
[1:07:27] be also glorified together for I reckon
[1:07:31] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:07:33] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:07:36] glory which shall be revealed in us now
[1:07:39] you know I as I was studying or thinking
[1:07:42] on this my brother and sister you see
[1:07:44] we're coming in a time that people are
[1:07:47] catching a little glimpse of what it may
[1:07:50] be if times got more difficulty in our
[1:07:53] nation and not to go into the political
[1:07:55] realm but all of those things are
[1:07:57] encapsulated in the fulfilling of God's
[1:07:59] Word and you know I saw a little deal
[1:08:03] the other day that said if you like you
[1:08:06] know empty shelves in the grocery store
[1:08:08] something of that nature empty shelves
[1:08:11] in the grocery store if you like this
[1:08:13] welcome to socialism and you look at
[1:08:16] what's happening is people are are the
[1:08:19] reason my brother and sister the shelves
[1:08:21] are empty in America today is not
[1:08:24] because of necessity and just a few
[1:08:27] weeks ago everything that was needed to
[1:08:30] live or exist here in the United States
[1:08:32] was on the Shelf in abundance and what
[1:08:35] we are seeing is fear this is the yoke
[1:08:40] of bondage being placed upon the people
[1:08:43] that is causing them to fear and their
[1:08:46] fear is causing them to go and behave in
[1:08:50] irrational fashions now Satan my brother
[1:08:53] and sister is not just putting this but
[1:08:55] this bondage of fear on the people that
[1:08:58] they're going to go hoard up all the
[1:08:59] products out of the grocery store but
[1:09:01] this will then consume them and will
[1:09:04] become the distraction of their life
[1:09:07] because fear does not remain just simply
[1:09:10] a fear of a cat or a dog or a fear of
[1:09:13] something like that fear is
[1:09:15] all-consuming and it will come to a
[1:09:18] place that it moves into their life and
[1:09:20] then you will have people
[1:09:22] and I'm speaking in a spiritual sense
[1:09:24] this morning you will have people that
[1:09:27] will start to look through their life
[1:09:28] and where they should have confidence
[1:09:31] should have faith they will have fear
[1:09:33] they will start coming to a place that
[1:09:35] fear will consume them to the place
[1:09:38] coming through maybe a natural outlet
[1:09:40] will come to a place that they will get
[1:09:42] up every single day of their life and
[1:09:44] say I don't think I have the Holy Ghost
[1:09:46] and when Satan gets them to that point
[1:09:49] he won't actually convince them now
[1:09:51] we're not talking about just going out
[1:09:53] here and delving into sin or not caring
[1:09:57] but my brother and sister the blood of
[1:09:59] Jesus Christ was not a one-time antidote
[1:10:01] it covers you and I for every single
[1:10:04] moment of our life every failure every
[1:10:08] struggle every trial it's there the
[1:10:11] blood of Jesus Christ is to cover us but
[1:10:13] if Satan can inject this this bondage of
[1:10:17] fear this distraction upon him then the
[1:10:19] people will see that their life is not
[1:10:22] worthy it's not adequate and they will
[1:10:24] judge themselves much harsher than God's
[1:10:26] Word would judge them until they come to
[1:10:28] the place that they have no hope and
[1:10:30] they quit and that will be the ultimate
[1:10:33] thing that Satan would desire so he is
[1:10:35] he brings forth this spirit of fear it
[1:10:38] is coming into society into mankind now
[1:10:42] there is no doubt that they can use this
[1:10:45] to manipulate a society there's no doubt
[1:10:47] my brother and sister as it's been
[1:10:49] mentioned by many look how easy it was
[1:10:52] to close down the churches as far as the
[1:10:54] physical body of this it said so no
[1:10:57] doubt my brother and sister these things
[1:10:58] will come in that word but Satan's
[1:11:00] dealing in a spiritual place when he
[1:11:03] deals with the Bride of Christ he knows
[1:11:05] this bride is not caught up and she's
[1:11:08] not living in her a McMansion driving
[1:11:11] her fancy stuff reveling in that that's
[1:11:13] not the goal the desire or the focus of
[1:11:16] the Bride of Christ
[1:11:17] so Satan's not going to go out in that
[1:11:19] realm and try to deal with them we'll
[1:11:22] touch on that in just a minute
[1:11:23] amen so we have not received Amen I like
[1:11:28] verse 15 for ye have not received the
[1:11:32] spirit of bondage he's telling us it's
[1:11:35] not here it's not for you if you have
[1:11:38] been influenced by it don't receive it
[1:11:40] Amen give them back that box of snakes
[1:11:43] amen hallelujah
[1:11:45] you know sometimes we got our society
[1:11:48] reading a few blogs online and stuff and
[1:11:50] people are like oh our nation is
[1:11:52] suffering oh my brother and sister we
[1:11:55] don't know what suffering is we've
[1:11:58] become so soft as a nation so soft as a
[1:12:01] people and that the fact that we have
[1:12:04] some struggles here are and people are
[1:12:07] saying we're suffering but regardless of
[1:12:10] how you judge this verse eighteen still
[1:12:12] covers it for our reckon that the
[1:12:14] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:12:17] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[1:12:19] shall be revealed in us it wouldn't
[1:12:21] matter what suffering we have right now
[1:12:24] my brother and sister the reports still
[1:12:25] coming out of Venezuela people are still
[1:12:28] going in the forest pulling leaves off
[1:12:29] of trees trying to make food out of just
[1:12:32] random leaves and plants and whatever
[1:12:34] because there's nothing on the shelves
[1:12:36] of the store literally what's
[1:12:37] photographs are are sent out of that
[1:12:40] nation show grocery stores with nothing
[1:12:43] on the shelves so in America we're still
[1:12:46] not suffering amen but it's not that
[1:12:51] that we're looking to now the trumpet
[1:12:54] gives an uncertain sound brother branham
[1:12:56] said some very very interesting things
[1:12:58] here he said now Paul said in the
[1:13:01] scriptures like training a soldier a
[1:13:03] soldier to a sound now a soldier has got
[1:13:08] to learn the sound of his of the bugle
[1:13:10] or the trumpet he doesn't know if the go
[1:13:13] blows whether to charge or whether to
[1:13:16] retreat if he doesn't know the
[1:13:17] difference what kind of a mixed up army
[1:13:20] would you have you see this is one of
[1:13:23] the things when you bring this over in a
[1:13:25] spiritual realm my brother and sister
[1:13:27] there's a lot of mixed-up things out
[1:13:29] here there's a lot of that we got people
[1:13:31] that are saying the prophets got to come
[1:13:33] back
[1:13:34] amen there's people saying well we've
[1:13:37] got two natures and we're fighting
[1:13:38] against one nature so we must have two
[1:13:40] souls we've got all kinds of nonsense my
[1:13:43] brother and sister but you see the real
[1:13:46] truth of it is
[1:13:48] somebody didn't train them that's what
[1:13:52] it comes round to you say well well if
[1:13:54] they're the bride they should just know
[1:13:56] but you see my brother and sister God
[1:13:58] put this ministry in the scripture to
[1:14:01] come and and be one that would encourage
[1:14:04] and lead and also teach you say well we
[1:14:07] can get all that we've got it all well
[1:14:10] that's fine then why are they mixed up
[1:14:11] Oh a man did it to them really if a man
[1:14:16] did it to them and mixed them up then
[1:14:19] that mean God's got men who can give
[1:14:22] them the right things to get it correct
[1:14:26] praise the Lord
[1:14:31] the enemy would certainly triumph over a
[1:14:33] bunch of soldiers that were no better
[1:14:35] trained than that amen that's what's the
[1:14:38] matter with our churches today we're
[1:14:39] trained them on Creed's differencing one
[1:14:42] to the other we've got to be united we
[1:14:45] got to know a trumpet then which is the
[1:14:48] trumpet they say the gospel trumpet
[1:14:50] that's it the word of the Living God is
[1:14:52] the trumpet don't mix nothing with it o
[1:14:55] my brother and sister when I look around
[1:14:57] here is as I talk to different people
[1:14:59] and and just interact with different
[1:15:02] things people say well brother Paul I've
[1:15:04] been told you sure hit on this go back
[1:15:06] to the word go back to the word well my
[1:15:07] brother and sister I think it's
[1:15:09] important that we go back to the word
[1:15:10] because even right here through the
[1:15:12] message see I might I might you know be
[1:15:15] redundant here in the pulpit about the
[1:15:18] word the word the word just go study the
[1:15:20] whole message people and you will find
[1:15:23] the Prophet over and over and over from
[1:15:25] beginning to end as a common thread or
[1:15:29] theme through it all go back to the word
[1:15:31] not will never become old that's just a
[1:15:34] my part of this message is understanding
[1:15:36] acts 2:38 you got to stay with the word
[1:15:39] amen this gospel trumpet that's it the
[1:15:42] word of the Living God is a trumpet
[1:15:43] don't mix nothing with it and I would
[1:15:47] say this if they would be passed along
[1:15:50] or people doing this my brother and
[1:15:52] sister if you cannot produce a scripture
[1:15:54] you say the prophet of God said and you
[1:15:57] can't produce scripture to back it up
[1:15:59] then your interpretation of what
[1:16:02] the Prophet said is wrong it's a day and
[1:16:05] age we got to come to the time go back
[1:16:07] to the word don't mix nothing with it
[1:16:11] don't have somebody play a French harp
[1:16:14] and another one blow a bugle you know I
[1:16:17] did this one time even with the same
[1:16:20] same music one time ministering down in
[1:16:25] Arizona I got the sisters one of them on
[1:16:28] the piano and one on the organ and we
[1:16:32] started off and they were playing the
[1:16:35] same music and then the sisters they
[1:16:38] said actually was harder than you think
[1:16:40] because in music you're always blending
[1:16:42] yourself together you're working to
[1:16:44] bring it together but we started off and
[1:16:47] and we I forget now exactly the right
[1:16:50] terms to use but we started off and they
[1:16:52] were playing exactly the same music and
[1:16:54] then one of them started playing it oh
[1:16:56] it was in a different key and then in
[1:16:59] the end the other sister sped up and was
[1:17:02] actually out running as it were music
[1:17:04] wise and then you know I had the
[1:17:06] privilege asking the church I said which
[1:17:08] one of those could we understand you see
[1:17:13] my brother and sister we got for it to
[1:17:14] be understood we got to get onto the
[1:17:16] same page we got to get onto the same
[1:17:18] line we got to get onto it not your
[1:17:20] version not my version but the words
[1:17:22] version amen so if we're out here
[1:17:26] playing a French harp and another one's
[1:17:28] blowing a bugle nobody knows what to do
[1:17:31] it brings confusion as Paul was talking
[1:17:34] about training a man to a sound and just
[1:17:37] as that sound is he knows exactly what
[1:17:40] to do because the bugler has got orders
[1:17:43] and from the chief captain and when he
[1:17:45] sounds this trumpet the army knows just
[1:17:48] exactly the place to advance or where to
[1:17:50] the withdraw or whether to turn right or
[1:17:53] left
[1:17:53] what to do by the sounding of the
[1:17:56] trumpet and this gospel trumpet that has
[1:17:59] blown in this age my brother and sister
[1:18:00] was not an uncertain sound it was not
[1:18:04] something to leave a people in confusion
[1:18:07] of what doctrine or what place or a
[1:18:09] prophet coming back but this word left a
[1:18:12] clear
[1:18:13] your sound a clear command to the church
[1:18:17] and one I say this again in my
[1:18:20] redundancy forgive me but take it back
[1:18:23] to the word and if you can't find word
[1:18:26] to back up your idea your theology and
[1:18:30] when I say word not some cherry-picked
[1:18:32] Scripture but continuity through the
[1:18:35] Word of God then my brother and sister
[1:18:37] lay that thing aside find something
[1:18:39] that's got continuity hallelujah well we
[1:18:44] got all these ideas because we can
[1:18:46] cherry pick whatever we want well praise
[1:18:49] the Lord I'm going to stick with
[1:18:50] something that started in the scripture
[1:18:52] in Genesis and finished in Revelation
[1:18:54] and that's what we're going to stand
[1:18:56] upon hallelujah now look at this my
[1:18:59] brother and sister as he's talking about
[1:19:02] now this bunch of soldiers this training
[1:19:05] this this place that we would come to
[1:19:08] you know this is what happens when
[1:19:12] confusion and Satan's got in the
[1:19:14] distraction into the church I know of a
[1:19:17] certain situation and then there is is
[1:19:20] or I should maybe say was several
[1:19:24] different ministers in the church their
[1:19:25] pastor was gone away and no longer there
[1:19:30] left one brother preaching to the church
[1:19:34] this idea and another brother in the
[1:19:38] church preaching this idea and another
[1:19:41] brother preaching his idea all of them
[1:19:44] preaching their idea what happens the
[1:19:50] people start getting confused and
[1:19:54] they're trying to blend this all
[1:19:55] together and they're not finding
[1:19:56] continuity what it does is it becomes
[1:20:00] ideas of our own become distractions
[1:20:03] from the Word of God we're not here to
[1:20:05] present our own idea but we're here to
[1:20:09] come as the prophet of God said right
[1:20:11] here this gospel trumpet that's it the
[1:20:16] word of the Living God is the trumpet
[1:20:19] and so as we look at that we realize you
[1:20:22] know what the Word of God Jesus Christ
[1:20:26] the same yesterday too
[1:20:27] in forever amen and that word of god
[1:20:31] will give a certain sound now my brother
[1:20:34] and sister if we believe that we have
[1:20:39] now let me just touch on this for a
[1:20:42] second people say we have more
[1:20:45] revelation as it were right now been
[1:20:48] given more they hadn't any other time
[1:20:50] through the ages I would agree with that
[1:20:52] that's the truth but what we preach
[1:20:55] today needs to be able to be taken back
[1:20:58] in time and stand before men such as
[1:21:01] Paul and pass the word test because you
[1:21:07] see Satan's distraction is to actually
[1:21:09] get us off people now all this might
[1:21:11] stir somebody up if they're listening
[1:21:13] but my brother and sister we're not here
[1:21:15] you say well Satan's trying to get us
[1:21:17] off brother branham's ministry get us
[1:21:20] away from the word say only what the
[1:21:21] Prophet said well my brother and sister
[1:21:23] brother Branham took us back and said I
[1:21:25] preached what Paul preached and so we
[1:21:28] could take this back further say Satan
[1:21:31] is trying to get us off of what Paul
[1:21:34] preached so let's not just take what we
[1:21:37] believe back to what brother Branham
[1:21:39] said and support it by scripture in
[1:21:41] quotes let's take it back to what Paul
[1:21:44] preached and if we can't support what
[1:21:46] we're preaching would not pass Paul's
[1:21:48] scrutiny then maybe we should put that
[1:21:50] on the shelf and wait for something else
[1:21:52] but you look at this you see we have
[1:21:55] been given and I say this in fatica ly
[1:21:57] today we have been given something that
[1:22:00] is a certain sound something we can
[1:22:04] anchor ourself to we can sit here and
[1:22:07] say you know what I can place my life my
[1:22:10] family my wife my children onto that and
[1:22:14] anchor into that and not betray my
[1:22:17] family amen
[1:22:18] but we know the devil is a worthy
[1:22:20] adversary is he not and so Satan's
[1:22:23] distractions are tailor-made for you and
[1:22:27] I never in ages gone by my brother and
[1:22:32] sister has things been more convenient
[1:22:34] we can get anything at our fingertips I
[1:22:38] don't have my phone with me but
[1:22:40] literally our phone
[1:22:41] we'll get us anything we want a best
[1:22:44] restaurant near me
[1:22:46] hamburger near me tire shop near me gas
[1:22:49] station near me I do crazy things like
[1:22:56] sit down at the computer and say what is
[1:22:59] the best religion you might think I'm
[1:23:03] silly but the reason I do that is
[1:23:07] because somebody's programming that
[1:23:09] computer and those people have their own
[1:23:12] message their own distraction their own
[1:23:14] and you say as message believers you say
[1:23:16] well brother Paul that just shows that's
[1:23:18] ridiculous that you would type something
[1:23:20] like that in but I'm not trying to think
[1:23:22] like a message believer I'm trying to
[1:23:24] think like the person out here that
[1:23:26] knows there must be a God and they are
[1:23:28] searching for something and they are
[1:23:30] trained in this mentality that they
[1:23:33] would sit down at the computer and type
[1:23:35] in what is the best religion and when
[1:23:38] they get a result out of that it might
[1:23:40] impact their life forever I know for a
[1:23:43] fact we have witness to people and they
[1:23:46] have they have been excited they are
[1:23:49] just amazed at what we're telling them
[1:23:52] and tell they went home and they typed
[1:23:55] in the computer who is William Branham
[1:23:59] but you see my brother and sister what
[1:24:02] they missed out of the whole thing just
[1:24:03] like I was speaking to you earlier don't
[1:24:05] look about the disease the fact that the
[1:24:08] Holy Ghost will shield us from the
[1:24:10] disease so we're not looking to the
[1:24:12] disease we're looking to the Holy Ghost
[1:24:14] and these people what they miss my
[1:24:17] brother and sister to lay this in how
[1:24:19] Satan works in his distraction this
[1:24:21] message is not about William Branham
[1:24:23] this message is about Jesus Christ but
[1:24:26] if he can get the people to focus on
[1:24:28] William Branham then they look on there
[1:24:31] and go all here's some kind of man net
[1:24:33] in the terms of the world says this guy
[1:24:35] was off in left field they're not
[1:24:37] interested because they're and then I'm
[1:24:39] not getting caught up but yet they like
[1:24:41] you and they like what they heard but
[1:24:43] the distraction that Satan brings takes
[1:24:46] them to and the focus comes off of the
[1:24:48] gospel and goes to the man and that
[1:24:53] Satan's distraction
[1:24:55] and in many a church in the world today
[1:24:58] the people hold their pastors to such a
[1:25:01] high esteem that the focus has gone from
[1:25:04] the gospel and what the Bible says to
[1:25:07] the Apostle or the pastor what do you
[1:25:13] want to call it many of them raise them
[1:25:16] up so high they got to get them up to
[1:25:17] the top of the list because you see
[1:25:19] there's a starts apostle that's early in
[1:25:24] the alphabet and it's in front of the
[1:25:25] rest and so they got to get it up there
[1:25:32] certainly apostle comes before pastor so
[1:25:37] they think then an apostle can come and
[1:25:39] then dominate the church with their own
[1:25:41] idea my brother and sister so far out to
[1:25:45] lunch so far out there they've got an
[1:25:48] idea a perverted idea of what it's all
[1:25:51] about and they come and they want to
[1:25:53] plant the seed I'm the apostle I'm the
[1:25:55] apostle my brother and sister I don't
[1:25:57] care what they are
[1:25:58] if they're not on the word they don't
[1:26:00] mean much amen
[1:26:02] they want to have influence on the
[1:26:04] church be humble come in the church sit
[1:26:06] down integrate yourself dig into the
[1:26:09] word offer the word to the people not
[1:26:11] ideas amen hallelujah
[1:26:14] so you see what happens is is the round
[1:26:17] round church oftentimes we've got a
[1:26:19] French heart plane over here and a bugle
[1:26:21] playing over here and usually I'm sorry
[1:26:24] when I put this when it's not on the
[1:26:26] Word of God my brother and sister
[1:26:28] usually they're bugling their own horn
[1:26:30] it's not God's horn it's their own horn
[1:26:33] listen to me listen to me listen to me
[1:26:35] well sorry not gonna happen
[1:26:38] now James 1 verse 6 I think this is
[1:26:42] pretty good I like this I've always
[1:26:45] liked this scripture but let him ask in
[1:26:47] faith nothing wavering God's not looking
[1:26:51] for the guy that's like well Lord if
[1:26:52] maybe possibly this could be God wants
[1:26:56] you to have enough confidence enough
[1:26:58] focus that when you stand on the word
[1:27:00] and you say Lord this needs to happen
[1:27:02] for the benefit of my family for my
[1:27:04] church for whatever it is Lord I'm
[1:27:07] calling
[1:27:08] your name you need to be able to ask in
[1:27:10] faith not not hope faith nothing
[1:27:14] wavering it says for he that wave earth
[1:27:18] is like a wave of the sea driven with
[1:27:20] the wind and tossed for let not that man
[1:27:22] think that he shall receive anything of
[1:27:25] the Lord o my brother and sister God
[1:27:27] doesn't want a double-minded Christian
[1:27:28] he doesn't want the guy who wants to
[1:27:30] have you know a Monday business
[1:27:33] mentality and a Sunday gospel mentality
[1:27:36] he wants you to have a gospel mentality
[1:27:38] seven days a week he wants you to be
[1:27:40] anchored in the word because you see
[1:27:42] when you get to the place that you're
[1:27:44] not wavered in other words there's no
[1:27:45] distraction when you're not wavering my
[1:27:48] brother and sister you're not looking to
[1:27:49] the right or to the left you are focused
[1:27:52] on the Word of God for our day and you
[1:27:55] are looking at that not wavering you're
[1:27:58] sold-out in other words to Jesus Christ
[1:28:00] and if you are not sold out then
[1:28:02] there'll be something that blows you
[1:28:04] this way something that blows you this
[1:28:06] way there will be influence coming to a
[1:28:08] man's life and that he will be then
[1:28:10] moved by those influences and bring
[1:28:14] himself to a place that he would say
[1:28:16] well you know I feel like maybe this and
[1:28:18] then he'll come and preach something
[1:28:20] else and then he moves over and he's
[1:28:22] anchored into that somebody else will
[1:28:24] preach something he's anchored into
[1:28:26] something I tell you my brother and
[1:28:27] sister we've had right here in our
[1:28:29] congregation that there has been folks
[1:28:32] namely female come into the church press
[1:28:35] so horrible and they would their words
[1:28:38] would be that brother Paul preaches too
[1:28:41] hard my brother and sister obviously the
[1:28:44] gospel had not been preached hard enough
[1:28:46] to them to even cause them to dress
[1:28:48] correctly but yet they can go somewhere
[1:28:51] and be perfectly comfortable as a
[1:28:53] message believer my brother and sister
[1:28:56] the prophet of God made this statement
[1:28:58] and these are not the exact words but he
[1:29:01] said we ought to be to the place we
[1:29:03] preach sin out of the church
[1:29:05] now we're not speaking about the
[1:29:07] individual but when a woman who claimed
[1:29:10] to be a message believer would come with
[1:29:12] clothes so tight it would stretch the
[1:29:15] very buttons of their blouse and then
[1:29:19] they would say they're preaching too
[1:29:21] hard
[1:29:23] you understand what I'm doing I'm laying
[1:29:26] the foundation we're not wavering will
[1:29:30] preach that sin out of the church this
[1:29:33] church grace Tabernacle better off
[1:29:35] without that spirit because that spirit
[1:29:39] will just be a distraction
[1:29:40] it'll be teaching our young girls that
[1:29:44] this is this person's accepted and that
[1:29:46] that kind of clothes is okay now I'm not
[1:29:50] picking on sisters I'm talking about the
[1:29:52] spirit that would come that people could
[1:29:55] waiver and the men hat standing here
[1:29:57] that should be preaching strong enough
[1:29:59] to put that out of the church if they
[1:30:02] don't preach strong enough to put that
[1:30:04] out of the church that church will not
[1:30:06] be immune not Church will catch every
[1:30:10] virus and I'm speaking spiritually that
[1:30:14] church will catch every virus that there
[1:30:17] is in the world today
[1:30:19] oh lord help us no I don't you know I
[1:30:22] want to preach a positive gospel just as
[1:30:24] much as anyone but Saints there's only
[1:30:27] one way to preach that and that's not
[1:30:28] waiver off of the very word of God that
[1:30:31] we claim to believe let that matter not
[1:30:33] let not that man think he shall receive
[1:30:36] anything of the Lord
[1:30:38] that's pretty exclusive is it not so we
[1:30:42] can't be wavering on one thing over here
[1:30:45] and then think that we're going to come
[1:30:48] over here and God's gonna bless us sorry
[1:30:55] I preached so hard I'm sorry Saints if
[1:30:58] you're at home and that cut to the bone
[1:31:00] text or call and we'll bring bandages
[1:31:04] it's about time
[1:31:06] Saints we're seeing the signs of the
[1:31:09] time that's pointing to an end time
[1:31:12] plagues and curses and things coming
[1:31:15] talking my brother and sister the
[1:31:18] governments of what they're going to do
[1:31:20] and we're seeing the Muslims and the
[1:31:22] Catholics and we're seeing the the all
[1:31:25] these Lutheran's and piss Kop aliens and
[1:31:27] all this all some of them even to the
[1:31:30] point they're calling the Pope Papa oh
[1:31:32] my brother and sister we
[1:31:35] coming back to the time amen
[1:31:38] the scripture shows us very clearly how
[1:31:42] those times would draw all of them right
[1:31:45] back in and it's happening so it's not a
[1:31:48] time for us to be pussyfooting around
[1:31:50] trying to preach a gospel that just
[1:31:52] makes people happy we'd be better off to
[1:31:54] stick with the prophets words when he
[1:31:56] said preach sin out of the church a
[1:31:58] smaller church that's pure is better
[1:32:00] than a large church that's filthy
[1:32:02] amen amen the Devils are worthy
[1:32:06] adversary and I would agree with that
[1:32:09] Satan's distractions are tailor-made for
[1:32:12] us you know you can go in different
[1:32:18] places I think those brother Ivan that
[1:32:19] shared that with me you know over in
[1:32:22] countries like Ukraine and different
[1:32:26] countries over there in Europe you can
[1:32:29] go get a professionally handmade
[1:32:32] tailored suit way cheaper and you can
[1:32:36] buy a suit over here of the same quality
[1:32:38] so it's tailor-made for you and I bring
[1:32:42] that example up because when something
[1:32:44] is tailor-made for you it fits you
[1:32:47] perfectly
[1:32:49] if you know whatever your physical being
[1:32:52] would be proportionately that suit fits
[1:32:55] you perfectly
[1:32:57] and Satan has a worthy adversary he
[1:33:01] Taylor makes our distractions for us in
[1:33:06] other words what distracts one brother
[1:33:08] or sister or one family over here or
[1:33:11] church will not work for someone else or
[1:33:14] another family or another Church so
[1:33:16] Satan comes and his distraction being
[1:33:19] tailor-made for us amen he has looked at
[1:33:23] our personal makeup of who we are and
[1:33:26] how we think and what affects us he
[1:33:31] looks back into our upbringing our
[1:33:33] childhood he looks into the weaknesses
[1:33:36] of our character you might say he looks
[1:33:38] at our complexes and and you know people
[1:33:41] will say I have no complexes then you're
[1:33:44] not human you're computer of some kind
[1:33:47] of robot
[1:33:48] he looked at your family you look at
[1:33:51] your job you look at your finances he'll
[1:33:54] even look at the kind of friends you
[1:33:56] choose and I say that I want to
[1:33:59] emphasize on that almost more than some
[1:34:02] of these others my brother and sister
[1:34:05] you'll find that when people now this is
[1:34:08] not a one size fits all so don't think I
[1:34:10] do but my brother and sisters a lot can
[1:34:15] be analyzed or understood by the kinds
[1:34:22] of friends people choose now I believe
[1:34:28] life needs to have a balance and I
[1:34:30] believe there needs to be a time and a
[1:34:31] season we simply live life in other
[1:34:33] words you can sit down on somebody's
[1:34:35] couch and you can just laugh and and
[1:34:40] have a good time but there also needs to
[1:34:43] be a time that the Word of God is part
[1:34:46] of our fellowship and when we come
[1:34:49] together as believers to fellowship and
[1:34:51] it's all frivolous laugh and jokester
[1:34:54] and when I say that I'm not talking
[1:34:57] about one particular evening I'm talking
[1:34:59] about that's what it is
[1:35:00] all the time you can look maybe a new
[1:35:03] family would come into the church you
[1:35:05] can look at what people they're
[1:35:08] attracted to it's kind of funny I'll
[1:35:12] probably offend somebody by saying this
[1:35:14] but it's pretty funny have you ever
[1:35:17] noticed the optimist and the conspiracy
[1:35:20] theorists are never never in true
[1:35:24] fellowship the conspiracy theorist says
[1:35:29] the whole government the whole world is
[1:35:31] here to destroy me to rob for me the
[1:35:35] optimist is praise the Lord
[1:35:36] the government changed that the laws
[1:35:38] this way in that way I'm going to go out
[1:35:40] and find a way to put that to my
[1:35:41] advantage you'll find they never go
[1:35:44] together the guy who thinks he's not
[1:35:47] really saved he all gets up every
[1:35:48] morning and wonders if he's really saved
[1:35:50] is not going to hang out in a very tight
[1:35:53] fellowship with the guy that looks at it
[1:35:55] and says you know what the blood of
[1:35:57] Jesus Christ was spilt for me he sealed
[1:35:59] me before the foundation of the
[1:36:02] world I am in him and he is in me and
[1:36:05] I'm gonna fulfill the word and I'm gonna
[1:36:07] be victorious and the man who's over
[1:36:10] here I don't even know if I'm safe
[1:36:11] they're not gonna have good fellowship
[1:36:13] you can see by the kinds of friends or
[1:36:16] what is being drawn together my brothers
[1:36:18] and sisters so Satan looks and he even
[1:36:21] looks into friendships of how he can
[1:36:24] come and sometimes it's to throw a
[1:36:26] wrench in the fent friendship but
[1:36:28] oftentimes he just follows that and you
[1:36:31] know you'll find my brother and sister
[1:36:32] and you'll say well we're obviously
[1:36:33] other Paul but there's more to it than
[1:36:36] this we won't take time to dig into it
[1:36:38] but my brother and sister you'll see a
[1:36:39] family I'll have I have a family in my
[1:36:42] mind right now an example but obviously
[1:36:44] would not would not ever name that but
[1:36:46] they move somewhere they move there
[1:36:48] because they believe they needed to do
[1:36:50] that for the spiritual welfare of their
[1:36:52] church but over time they start hanging
[1:36:55] out with a certain group of people and
[1:36:57] my brother and sister when one of that
[1:37:00] group woke up one day and says the
[1:37:02] message is false they fell like dominoes
[1:37:05] one family to another family to another
[1:37:08] family to another family like a domino
[1:37:10] buh-buh-buh-buh-buh mo they were the
[1:37:13] ones that hung out together there was
[1:37:15] something there but when that same
[1:37:20] movement you might say that same
[1:37:22] influence come through right across the
[1:37:27] valley the same members of the same
[1:37:30] church men sitting under the same
[1:37:31] ministry they woke up and said oh my
[1:37:36] goodness look what's happening we need
[1:37:39] to invite brother so-and-so and his wife
[1:37:41] and family and brother so-and-so and his
[1:37:42] wife and family and brother so-and-so
[1:37:43] and wife and family and we need to have
[1:37:45] a prayer meeting you see my brother and
[1:37:48] sister because they were of a certain
[1:37:50] fellowship and this other was of a
[1:37:52] certain fellowship and the devil looked
[1:37:55] at that and said oh I know how to use
[1:37:59] that becomes his tactic his distraction
[1:38:06] you know he even looks at what we listen
[1:38:09] to and what we read you name it as a
[1:38:13] distraction it's tailor-made for you but
[1:38:17] my brother and sister what we need to
[1:38:18] remember is these are just distraction
[1:38:20] what's going on in the world today
[1:38:21] they're posting the numbers like
[1:38:23] somebody you know even asked on the
[1:38:25] Internet there there's like how come
[1:38:27] they're not talking about the amount of
[1:38:28] people that don't have that virus and
[1:38:31] the amount of people who have recovered
[1:38:33] from the virus all you hear is a
[1:38:35] thousand people have died a thousand
[1:38:37] people have died a thousand people have
[1:38:38] died wait the flu killed more than that
[1:38:41] but you see the spirit of fear is being
[1:38:44] injected they can shut down industries
[1:38:46] that shut down airports and travel and
[1:38:48] everything and say this what we must do
[1:38:50] so they're injecting the fear this is
[1:38:53] Satan's distraction but the bride wasn't
[1:38:55] called right remember Saints these
[1:38:58] things out here outside of the Word of
[1:39:00] God are distractions amen so it's not
[1:39:05] something for us to do so we look at
[1:39:07] this now I want to just come you know
[1:39:10] back and tie this together as we close
[1:39:17] we'll look at this and and the message
[1:39:20] my brother and sister is not a message
[1:39:22] God's gospel it's not a message of
[1:39:24] uncertainty and if what you've been
[1:39:27] feeding on Saints leaves you uncertain
[1:39:31] you need to get down on your knees and
[1:39:33] you need to ask God to bring certainty
[1:39:35] in your life because the Word of God the
[1:39:37] trumpet of truth the gospel trumpet does
[1:39:41] not bring uncertainty into our lives it
[1:39:44] brings certainty
[1:39:46] now the prophet of God shows us that he
[1:39:49] spoke at this with this way that
[1:39:51] Ephesians parallels Joshua so as we
[1:39:55] would look once again and draw out of
[1:39:56] Joshua 23 going kind of back to where we
[1:39:59] started you'll see right here that it
[1:40:02] says be therefore very courageous to
[1:40:04] keep and do all that is written in the
[1:40:06] book of the law of Moses now there's
[1:40:08] people around the message that are so
[1:40:10] nitpick contentious about what said that
[1:40:13] they would be going oh that was the law
[1:40:15] that was the law were not under the law
[1:40:17] well good the prophet of God said it
[1:40:19] Ephesians
[1:40:20] parallels Joshua so to those that want
[1:40:22] to carpet that you can carpet that but
[1:40:25] here it is that we can take this so be
[1:40:28] their very courageous to keep and do all
[1:40:32] that is written in the book of the law
[1:40:34] of the message and messenger to Laodicea
[1:40:38] I don't think I'm out of line to even
[1:40:41] put it that way sounds a little harsh
[1:40:43] doesn't it
[1:40:44] hallelujah well I don't mean it harsh
[1:40:46] but what we got is some people that want
[1:40:48] to just throw their darts wherever they
[1:40:50] throw their darts and just call it well
[1:40:52] that's just how it was no here's the
[1:40:55] word Ephesian age Ephesian gospel our
[1:41:00] day needs to be very courageous to keep
[1:41:03] and do all that is written in the book
[1:41:05] my brother and sister don't let Satan
[1:41:07] distract you into an ism I sometimes
[1:41:09] just marvel as I look at these people
[1:41:12] that think the rapture is over and we're
[1:41:13] in the Millennium my goodness by running
[1:41:16] a sister you can't go to a store but
[1:41:18] what you about have to look at the floor
[1:41:20] tiles or the ceiling tiles to walk
[1:41:22] through a store and you know what this
[1:41:24] is going to be kind of a this will
[1:41:26] probably get me in trouble but I I and I
[1:41:28] mean this kindly because we are what we
[1:41:30] are but my brother and sister it isn't
[1:41:33] even so much the agent we're looking but
[1:41:35] we have we have people men and women
[1:41:38] that ought to be doing something
[1:41:41] different and they go into the store in
[1:41:42] their t-shirt and spandex sometimes
[1:41:46] that's just as distracting I mean just
[1:41:49] because well anyway I'm gonna get myself
[1:41:51] in trouble it's as big a distraction if
[1:41:55] it was a pretty girl in spandex I mean
[1:41:57] they got they got their body flopped
[1:41:59] everywhere and they're walking along and
[1:42:01] they're this and we're living in a day
[1:42:03] they don't care no one cares there's no
[1:42:06] propriety there's no nothing no holiness
[1:42:08] left in them or whatever I am I am I
[1:42:10] just show it to the world my brother and
[1:42:13] sister we are coming to a time we need
[1:42:16] to be courageous it took as Joshua was
[1:42:19] speaking to those people he told them be
[1:42:21] courageous well we're living in a day
[1:42:24] it's going to take some people that are
[1:42:26] courageous that are going to look into
[1:42:29] the Word of God for our hour and say I
[1:42:31] don't care what anybody else says about
[1:42:33] this I'm going to
[1:42:34] keep this word to the letter no I'm not
[1:42:36] illegal Asst no no one's forcing me to
[1:42:38] do this I'm doing this because I believe
[1:42:41] it and I am NOT going to be distracted
[1:42:44] from anything else my brother and sister
[1:42:47] as I was going to say there I marvel at
[1:42:49] people that would say we're in the
[1:42:51] Millennium I don't think in the
[1:42:54] Millennium I'm gonna have to worry about
[1:42:56] viewing all of that out there scripture
[1:42:59] says we're going to walk out on the
[1:43:01] ashes of the wicked not follow behind
[1:43:05] them in where mark or Walmart or by Mart
[1:43:10] or Kmart let's don't get distracted
[1:43:15] let's go back to the work the word says
[1:43:18] be courageous live it do it stand on it
[1:43:23] and don't be afraid see one of the
[1:43:26] problems we have is oftentimes it's the
[1:43:28] way it's always been in the world you
[1:43:31] can repeat it often enough you can take
[1:43:34] an untruth and repeat it often enough
[1:43:37] and people will believe it let's have
[1:43:40] courage to stand up and say if it
[1:43:42] doesn't line up with the word I'm not
[1:43:44] going to call it a message myth a
[1:43:48] brother introduced me to that term
[1:43:50] sometime back here and and it's a it's a
[1:43:55] definitely a deal because you see we use
[1:44:00] that to cover things that people are
[1:44:04] preaching and teaching and living that
[1:44:07] don't line up with the word well they've
[1:44:09] just it's just you know a myth my
[1:44:12] brother and sister we don't need myths
[1:44:14] let's step beyond the myth that's
[1:44:16] nothing more than Satan's distraction to
[1:44:19] say well the brother didn't know so he
[1:44:21] could therefore promote it no my
[1:44:24] brother's sister if it doesn't line up
[1:44:26] with the word it's off the word prophet
[1:44:28] of God said it even stronger night in he
[1:44:30] said if it don't line up with the word
[1:44:31] it's an antichrist spirit Saints don't
[1:44:37] get distracted
[1:44:38] stick with the Word of God we can live
[1:44:42] we have this kind of courage that we can
[1:44:46] stand
[1:44:47] do every word hallelujah sister Emmy
