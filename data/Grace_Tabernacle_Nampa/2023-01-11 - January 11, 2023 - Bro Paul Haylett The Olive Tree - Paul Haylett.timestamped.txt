[34:01] you're like okay we've got to remember
[34:03] these prayer requests but the minute you
[34:05] get out here they seem to just come back
[34:07] to you and we want to remember brother
[34:11] Isaac's sister Kristen tonight
[34:13] um
[34:14] uh um
[34:15] Monumental day for them they actually
[34:19] signed the papers for their home today
[34:22] and uh so depending on how you look at
[34:24] that they've gained a home or they've
[34:26] gained a few hundred thousand dollars in
[34:28] debt but um we're just happy uh God has
[34:31] blessed them after all these years to be
[34:34] able to have a home to call their own
[34:36] and it is also their
[34:39] what anniversary 15. my own son-in-law
[34:43] and I can't remember how long he's been
[34:45] married
[34:45] yeah tomorrow 15 years so they just
[34:49] doing and then on top all that brother
[34:51] Isaac doesn't feel good so uh just
[34:55] remember them in prayer our brother Bob
[34:57] sister Joanne uh I think it's on our
[35:01] prayer list all the time brother
[35:02] personal and sister akonsha but I don't
[35:05] see brother Tim and sister Miriam
[35:07] tonight so I don't know I think they're
[35:09] still not feeling too good and just the
[35:12] all these things that we have almost
[35:14] empty church for travels and whatever
[35:16] but the Lord knows and you know just as
[35:20] I've often mentioned the little quote I
[35:23] have in the office you know
[35:24] no problem or two or three are gathered
[35:27] together and then so we are the Bride of
[35:30] Jesus Christ amen and he has given us
[35:33] assurance that we uh we can count on
[35:36] that he is here with us tonight so let's
[35:39] just stand thank you brother uh just a
[35:42] wonderful song service amen I sure
[35:45] appreciate shape that and sister Ruth
[35:48] amen
[35:50] I want to speak to you tonight this
[35:53] might seem a little different so I don't
[35:56] know how this will turn out
[35:59] um I want to speak to you tonight on the
[36:01] olive tree and it's a much bigger
[36:04] subject than we can deal with in one
[36:06] Wednesday night but as we were there in
[36:10] Israel there was just so many things
[36:11] spoke to us and uh we we were just
[36:16] mentioning that the other night just how
[36:18] special that was and and brother Trevor
[36:21] and I and you look at this and realize
[36:24] all of these things and God bless you
[36:27] brother for ceiling glad to see you here
[36:30] amen when we see all these things and
[36:32] the prophet of God says you know that
[36:34] when you go to Israel the Bible will
[36:36] become a brand new book to you and I can
[36:38] honestly say from my heart it has there
[36:41] are so many little things that you see
[36:43] that you never really truly grasped them
[36:46] before you know it was interesting now
[36:49] there's a lot of they say this is what
[36:51] it was
[36:52] but you know always in my mind all all
[36:56] my life I've fought now the manger that
[36:59] Christ was born in I can see you know
[37:01] one of those little mangers with the
[37:03] wooden legs crossed and so easy to build
[37:06] and whatever we get over there and then
[37:09] they present you with this fact that
[37:11] probably the manger that he laid in was
[37:14] out of stone
[37:16] and it just shocks your little
[37:18] preconceived notions that it's there and
[37:21] we saw several different places where
[37:24] somebody with Incredible skill carved a
[37:28] manger out of a rock and uh but we
[37:31] wanted to talk on the Olive Tree tonight
[37:33] let's turn in our Bibles uh to the Book
[37:36] of Romans we'll start with the first
[37:38] verse and I'm just going to read a small
[37:41] portion of this because I actually have
[37:43] 23 verses there that there's something I
[37:46] want to draw from all of that so if you
[37:48] don't mind tonight we'll read the first
[37:50] four and then we will preach as we go
[37:56] through this covering these other
[37:58] scriptures so amen Romans 11 1. I say
[38:04] then hath God Cast Away his people
[38:07] God forbid
[38:09] for I also am an Israelite of the Seed
[38:12] of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin God
[38:16] hath not Cast Away his people which he
[38:20] foreknew aren't you glad we can say Amen
[38:22] to that tonight amen he did not Cast
[38:25] Away those he foreknew and we are those
[38:28] he foreknew amen thank you Lord what ye
[38:33] not the scripture say if Elias how he
[38:36] maketh intercession to God against
[38:38] Israel saying Lord they have killed thy
[38:41] prophets and dig down thine altars and I
[38:43] am left alone and they seek my life but
[38:47] what saith the answer of God unto him I
[38:50] have reserved to myself seven thousand
[38:53] men who have not bowed the knee to the
[38:56] image of Baal Heavenly Father we just
[38:59] ask you Lord to just bless our time
[39:01] together this evening Lord we're
[39:03] thankful Lord have our brother vasili
[39:05] back off of the road with us tonight
[39:07] Lord we're thankful to have our brothers
[39:09] and sisters visiting with us just ask
[39:12] your father speak to our hearts tonight
[39:14] let the word of God God just come and
[39:17] invigorate US father to put the day the
[39:19] week behind us just to come into your
[39:22] presence Lord and we thank you Father
[39:24] for the opportunity that you granted us
[39:27] tonight to assemble together we ask for
[39:29] this blessing in the name of Jesus
[39:31] Christ amen you may be seated
[39:41] how that must have been
[39:43] just a little bit I think sometimes we
[39:46] feel this ourselves in the day that we
[39:48] live in we kind of feel like Lord where
[39:51] is this bride we we go to church with a
[39:53] group of Believers a body of Believers
[39:56] but yet sometimes we feel so alone we
[39:59] feel kind of you might say a little
[40:01] isolated and you know we look around and
[40:04] we have our little church and and you
[40:06] know you think well you know there's not
[40:08] too many Believers in this area hundreds
[40:11] several hundred thousand people where
[40:13] they aren't but my brother and sister
[40:15] God knows exactly where every one of his
[40:17] sons and daughters are there is not a
[40:19] single one that has been misplaced or
[40:21] set to the side that we need to get uh
[40:24] you know pardon me for using that phrase
[40:26] bent out of shape of how is this going
[40:28] to happen God's got it all in control
[40:31] can we say Amen tonight because if he
[40:33] doesn't have it in control we need to be
[40:36] anxious about everything but that's not
[40:39] what the word says this word does not
[40:41] say be anxious for everything saying the
[40:44] word says that we as Believers will come
[40:46] to a position of rest in Jesus Christ
[40:49] and it's there in that rest that we can
[40:51] look out this doesn't give us a license
[40:53] to be lackadaisical it doesn't give us a
[40:55] opportunity to just brush it off and say
[40:58] well whatever will be will be but we can
[41:01] stand every day and say Lord we want
[41:04] your perfect will in our lives and we
[41:07] trust you so much Lord to follow your
[41:10] leadership that's taking us into your
[41:13] perfect will and so you know this Human
[41:15] Side of us gets in the way sometimes
[41:18] like daily but uh you know we we are in
[41:22] a position that we can simply say Lord I
[41:25] Will Follow You amen and so as we look
[41:27] at this I want to go on with verse 5
[41:29] even so then at this present time also
[41:32] there is a Remnant according to the
[41:34] election of Grace and I just love how
[41:37] the prophet showed us that we can take
[41:40] this the scripture here speaking back to
[41:43] those in Israel at that time but it also
[41:47] is speaking directly to us in this day
[41:49] and I I love that that in this present
[41:52] time there is a Remnant according to the
[41:54] election of Grace and if by Grace then
[41:57] it is no more of Works otherwise Grace
[42:00] is no more Grace but if it be of works
[42:03] there is there is then is it no more
[42:07] grace otherwise work is no more work
[42:10] what then Israel hath not obtained that
[42:14] which he seeketh for and as we were
[42:17] speaking to the the other day so they
[42:19] are living in this small portion of
[42:21] about 17 percent of their land and they
[42:24] still have a desire this conflict that
[42:27] is going on a change of government and
[42:30] people say uh this now uh Netanyahu
[42:33] being elected now is a huge mistake and
[42:36] a conflict but my brother and sister you
[42:38] see this right here they are still
[42:41] seeking to obtain what God God promised
[42:44] them and so this will never stop it will
[42:47] never end there will be no time that
[42:49] they stop and say okay we will no longer
[42:52] move forward on this no more than the
[42:55] devil can offer the opportunity to you
[42:58] the bride of Christ to call a truce
[43:00] today to say I'll just settle down right
[43:03] where I'm at today God has sent a
[43:05] prophet we have an open book I'm just
[43:08] going to settle down here that's not the
[43:10] spirit that God has anointed the bride
[43:12] of Christ with she is moving into her
[43:15] promise and Satan cannot stop her she
[43:18] will be discouraged sometimes she will
[43:21] falter maybe wander a little bit but in
[43:24] the end the anointing word the anointed
[43:26] word will come upon her so strongly that
[43:30] she must seek the very face of God and
[43:33] the revealed word of the hour is the
[43:35] revealed face of God in our day and you
[43:38] can move right into that and lay claim
[43:40] to that amen so it's there I love how
[43:43] the scripture this is so obvious when
[43:45] you are there in Israel to see this and
[43:48] then Israel hath not obtained that which
[43:51] he seeketh for but the election hath
[43:54] obtained and the rest were blinded
[43:57] according as it is written God hath
[43:59] given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes
[44:02] that they should not see and ears they
[44:05] should not hear unto this day
[44:09] see this is not as it was when this was
[44:12] written
[44:13] spoken to the Romans it's this day
[44:17] and you go there and and as we were uh
[44:20] just recently on a tour in Israel and
[44:22] and it's there that you you look around
[44:25] and you see people uh they're they're
[44:28] performing all of their religious rights
[44:31] but it is as though they are performing
[44:34] there's not a great sincerity there's
[44:36] not a great uh burning desire there
[44:39] they're just performing this and it is
[44:41] by this this promise that we're reading
[44:44] right now that we realize that they do
[44:47] desire you get in a conversation uh with
[44:50] them and they desire the things of God
[44:53] but God has put this Spirit upon them
[44:56] and they are now in this Slumber in
[44:58] their eyes and their ears and as we'll
[45:00] go a little further we know these things
[45:02] as as message Believers but it just
[45:05] strikes you that it is there that it is
[45:07] such a
[45:09] beautiful sight
[45:11] now that might sound strange to say it's
[45:13] a beautiful sight but literally you get
[45:16] to see them
[45:17] in their slumber
[45:19] and we don't glory in the fact they're
[45:21] in a slumber but you see they do have a
[45:24] promise amen there is a promise to
[45:26] Israel but we're seeing this and the
[45:29] reason I would say that we could get a
[45:32] little excited is because clearly
[45:34] without them being in a slumber we would
[45:36] not be in our position we are in today
[45:39] and God in his grace and mercy said I'm
[45:42] going to make a way for you even if I
[45:44] have to take my own chosen people and
[45:47] put them in a condition and put them in
[45:49] a position and I will do that for you
[45:52] and I can only say thank you Lord
[45:54] because otherwise where would we be
[45:57] amen and so it is written God hath given
[46:00] them the Spirit of Slumber and eyes they
[46:02] should not see in ears they should not
[46:03] hear unto this day and David saith let
[46:07] their table be made a snare into
[46:09] and a stumbling block and a recompense
[46:12] unto them let their eyes be darkened
[46:15] that they may not see and bow down their
[46:19] back all way I say then have they
[46:22] stumbled that they should fall
[46:24] God forbid but rather through their fall
[46:28] salvation has come unto the Gentiles for
[46:31] to provoke them to jealousy now if the
[46:34] fall of them be the riches of the world
[46:37] and the diminishing of them The Riches
[46:40] of the Gentiles how much more their
[46:43] fullness oh look at the Glorious Day
[46:46] that is coming my brother and sister
[46:47] this bride of Christ this Gentile bride
[46:50] is going to be sealed and she's going to
[46:53] already have taken her position but look
[46:56] at the glory that God is going to pour
[46:58] out on the 144 thousand there is going
[47:01] to be such Revelation come down to them
[47:04] an outpouring of the holy spirit that
[47:06] their lives are going to be transformed
[47:09] it's going to be an incredible sight
[47:11] would almost make you want to be there
[47:13] to witness it but I thank you Lord we
[47:15] won't be here to witness it but the
[47:18] truth of it is we see the same kind of
[47:21] revealing or opening of the word the
[47:23] same moving of the holy spirit that
[47:25] moved upon us is going to move upon them
[47:28] we're going to see that same Awakening
[47:31] that same recognition and the same
[47:33] output pouring of Revelation that
[47:35] they're going to be able to look and say
[47:38] oh my and they are going to worship
[47:41] they're going to pour their hearts out
[47:42] they are going to ask God for
[47:44] forgiveness they're going to raise up
[47:46] with their fruit of their lips which is
[47:48] praising to the Lord and we're going to
[47:50] see a glorious time I just can't wait my
[47:53] brother and sister to to uh see the the
[47:56] finishing or the completion of the plan
[47:58] of God
[48:00] amen because he's riches my brother and
[48:03] sister that's how the word puts it as
[48:05] riches
[48:06] amen God diminished them to raise us up
[48:10] and all I can say tonight is thank you
[48:12] Lord
[48:13] thank you Lord because we would still be
[48:16] out here in denomination trying to do a
[48:18] good work we would be out here trying to
[48:20] live just right and do all kinds of
[48:23] sacraments and all kinds of tradition
[48:25] and to to do that trying to you know as
[48:29] it is coming maybe from Catholic
[48:31] background as our family is a ways back
[48:33] and you look at this and realize we
[48:36] would be just trying to do everything
[48:37] just right so God would be pleased
[48:41] but God says I'm rich in Mercy
[48:44] and I'm willing to take and dampen
[48:48] Israel
[48:49] and Shine the Light on you that you
[48:52] would be able to come and it stirs my
[48:54] heart amen now I'll get along to my
[48:56] thought about the The Olive Tree in just
[48:59] a moment here
[49:00] amen for I speak to you Gentiles and as
[49:04] much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles
[49:07] I magnify my office if by any means I
[49:11] may provoke you
[49:14] to imitate emulation
[49:20] provoke you
[49:21] to emulation them which are my flesh and
[49:25] might save some of them for if the
[49:27] casting away of them be reckoned the
[49:29] reconciling of the world what shall the
[49:32] receiving of them be but life from the
[49:35] dead for if the first fruit be holy the
[49:39] lump is also holy thank you Lord
[49:44] and if the root now let's remember verse
[49:47] 16 if the root be holy so are the
[49:51] branches
[49:52] and if some of the branches be broken
[49:55] off and thou being a wild Olive Tree
[49:58] were Graft in among them and with them
[50:02] partake us of the root and the fatness
[50:05] of the Olive Tree boast not against the
[50:09] branches but if thou boast thou bearest
[50:12] not the root but the root the
[50:16] my brother and sister we simply can look
[50:18] at how this ties in the scripture and as
[50:20] it is we do not have Christ Christ has
[50:24] us amen the minute we think we could
[50:27] actually live without him is the minute
[50:29] of our downfall amen so we look at this
[50:32] and realize if there be any good thing
[50:34] if there be any life if there be any
[50:37] fruit that would be born it is from the
[50:40] root amen it is not the branch amen so
[50:44] we look at this
[50:50] boasts not against the branches but if
[50:52] thou boast
[50:54] thou bearest not the root but the root
[50:56] thee
[50:58] thou will say then the branches are
[51:00] broken off that I might be Graft in well
[51:03] because of unbelief they were broken off
[51:05] and thou stand Us by faith can we say
[51:09] thank you Lord that we stand by faith
[51:10] tonight be not high-minded but fear for
[51:15] if God spared not the natural branches
[51:17] take heed lest he also spare not thee
[51:22] um amen Grace Grace and to disgrace
[51:25] certainly a spirit that's in the world
[51:27] today
[51:28] behold therefore the goodness and
[51:30] severity of God on them which fell
[51:33] severity but toward thee goodness
[51:37] if thou continue in his goodness
[51:39] otherwise thou also shall be cut off and
[51:43] they also if they abide not still in
[51:45] unbelief shall be Graft in for God is
[51:48] able to graft them in again
[51:52] amen thank you Lord for your word
[51:56] as we were there in in Israel we look at
[51:59] this and and uh as we traveled the
[52:01] country I become a little bit enthralled
[52:04] with the Olive Tree and you know they
[52:08] have a um the longest known living Olive
[52:11] Tree is more than 1500 years old and
[52:14] many olive trees lived to be 500 years
[52:17] old very common and so it is to me very
[52:20] beautiful how that the scripture ties
[52:23] The Olive Tree into our lives and so
[52:26] it's there that we can see uh this this
[52:29] uh nature that God put in the Olive Tree
[52:31] it's not just for a condiment at our
[52:34] meals but God just give a hole you might
[52:37] say a whole Ministry into the Olive Tree
[52:41] and so we see that the olive tree has
[52:44] been brought in it becomes a great
[52:46] example a great representation to us and
[52:50] Olive Tree is often considered a
[52:52] representative of Israel of the Jews and
[52:56] so it's there that we look at this and
[52:58] realize now that Mount of Olives at one
[53:01] time not now but at one time Mount of
[53:03] Olives was literally completely covered
[53:05] with olive trees and so as time goes on
[53:09] for various reasons they that there's
[53:11] not that many left there now but you'll
[53:14] see that how many times that Jesus was
[53:17] there and Mount of Olives is is a place
[53:20] there in the dialogue concerning uh the
[53:24] life and and what Jesus uh was speaking
[53:27] in that time and place uh became a place
[53:29] that he was comfortable with the place
[53:31] he liked to go to uh to find Solace and
[53:34] rest and you'll see my brother and
[53:36] sister now as it is in this time that
[53:40] this representation of Israel uh how
[53:43] that God chose to to bring out of a tree
[53:48] a nation
[53:51] and not only a nation a people
[53:54] and we'll see how the scripture often
[53:57] types it as trees and people as an
[53:59] interchangeable thing
[54:01] and we understand also that in the fig
[54:05] and olive tree brother Branham uses them
[54:08] kind of almost interchanged in several
[54:10] places but we understand when that buds
[54:13] again it is a timepiece of God and so
[54:17] we'll see my brother and sister that it
[54:19] has butted and we can see and not in to
[54:22] get into all the politics and all the
[54:23] things tonight but just tying back to
[54:26] what I said earlier we see the very
[54:28] nature of Israel the very nature of the
[54:31] people is they are still longing and
[54:34] pressing into or Desiring the promise
[54:37] that God gave them and so their very
[54:39] actions their very Life as a nation is
[54:42] focused around this position and even as
[54:45] more Israelis as a nation as a people
[54:48] are becoming uh less religious there is
[54:52] a still a position because you look at
[54:55] this and God doesn't say you know when
[54:57] they're in a certain religious position
[54:59] no no he says is when my timepiece when
[55:03] it comes to the time my hundred and
[55:06] forty four thousand will respond to the
[55:09] word and I say thank you Lord because
[55:11] it's not then man watching a clock as it
[55:14] were but it is by Revelation the word of
[55:17] God unfolding before us and to realize
[55:20] that we are also a part of the timepiece
[55:22] amen it is not a watch it's not just a a
[55:26] a a a a a little knob to adjust it in a
[55:30] couple hands but there's many intricate
[55:32] pieces that make up a timepiece and we
[55:35] are a part of that timepiece and I say
[55:37] Lord help us as the bride of Christ amen
[55:39] to to fulfill our portion of the
[55:43] timepiece amen we know God is patient
[55:47] but I want to be one who is ready
[55:51] I wouldn't want God just take this
[55:53] figuratively tonight I wouldn't want God
[55:55] to have to say I'm going to have to hold
[55:56] the second hand back because of Paul
[56:00] come on Paul
[56:02] get your act together I'm holding it
[56:04] back for you
[56:06] I want to be ready can we say amen I
[56:09] want to be on fire I want God to be
[56:11] looking down and saying my son is ready
[56:13] to go my son My bride is ready to go
[56:16] she's anxious she's anxious she's on
[56:20] fire
[56:21] amen and we look at this understanding
[56:24] the the timepiece of the day that we
[56:26] live in you'll see brother Branham
[56:28] refers to uh three minutes till midnight
[56:30] and how he makes that reference and how
[56:33] we must be so much closer today than it
[56:36] was at that time it was three minutes
[56:38] till midnight in our mind my brother and
[56:40] sister
[56:42] three seconds
[56:43] 90 seconds I'm getting myself confused
[56:46] here
[56:48] you see what it is my brother and sister
[56:49] what happens is is as we start looking
[56:52] for this to be fulfilled
[56:55] and we look to that to be fulfilled and
[56:57] we're watching the news saying how does
[56:58] this fit in and what does that fit in
[57:00] what God actually wanted us to do and
[57:02] the prophet called us just live
[57:04] just live the word just get up in the
[57:06] morning and live the word
[57:08] amen don't be running around trying to
[57:10] figure out timing of all of these things
[57:13] and how it is that is there my brother
[57:15] and sister what's happening today is the
[57:18] devil is trying to distract us as it is
[57:21] we've got CNN and whatever all those
[57:23] other things are that are trying to draw
[57:25] our attention away and make us nervous
[57:28] but God wants us to settle down his word
[57:30] was his word amen and we can count on
[57:34] his word coming to pass because he
[57:36] fulfills every single promise he ever
[57:38] gave to his children amen and so as we
[57:42] look at this we see as the prophet of
[57:44] God tells us now I'm paraphrasing and
[57:46] moving through some of this because
[57:47] otherwise we could be here forever but
[57:50] you see the scripture shows us clearly
[57:53] here and brother Branham speaks this
[57:55] that God would never completely forsake
[57:57] Israel not even as a nation Israel is a
[58:01] nation my brother and sister has all
[58:03] kinds of social problems and all kinds
[58:05] of social fads and whatever else but
[58:07] God's even got a promise to them simply
[58:10] as a nation not even just the 144 000
[58:14] but a nation God has a covenant or a
[58:17] promise to them and so we see that God
[58:19] will never forsake them as a nation here
[58:22] and we see that as we would bless Israel
[58:25] God would bless us and we see how now
[58:28] that Israel Moving Forward under this
[58:30] blessing of God my brother and sister
[58:32] they're still when you're over there and
[58:35] you read some of this historical stuff
[58:37] and you look at through this stuff there
[58:40] is still a shock in the world today from
[58:43] 1967 there's a shock how Israel won The
[58:47] Six Day War they they said they can't
[58:50] figure it out how can this be had we've
[58:53] got to see oh I do you remember it was
[58:55] uh 11 1200 tanks against 140 or
[58:59] something and they defeat them and no
[59:03] one understands why
[59:05] but God's hand is still upon Israel
[59:07] because that promise must be fulfilled
[59:10] now my brother and sister we look at
[59:12] that timepiece or that part of the
[59:15] promise and we look down now and God
[59:17] says I'm going to have a bride she's not
[59:19] going to have a spot not going to have a
[59:21] wrinkle she's going to be in love with
[59:23] me she's going to serve me with all of
[59:25] her heart the word is not going to be on
[59:27] a page or a chiseled into stone it's
[59:29] going to be on their heart it's going to
[59:32] be on the fleshly table and they are
[59:34] going to live this word because they
[59:36] love me
[59:37] now if God declared that in his word
[59:39] must that not to come to pass in the day
[59:42] we live in and I say I believe even
[59:44] tonight it's coming to path God is
[59:47] writing his word not just words my
[59:50] brother and sister but his word amen
[59:53] which is personalized what might be good
[59:55] and the word just for you for your
[59:57] condition of life and the things that
[59:59] would bother you God would write on your
[1:00:01] heart for that and he would write on my
[1:00:03] heart brother Trevor whoever's heart he
[1:00:05] would write these things down a
[1:00:07] prescription just for you
[1:00:10] amen because God does not waste his
[1:00:13] words
[1:00:15] every word of God has purpose and has
[1:00:17] meaning and has value
[1:00:19] and so as we see the olive oil is a
[1:00:22] representation of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:24] we'll see my brother and sister the only
[1:00:26] way that there is olive oil is the fruit
[1:00:29] of the Olive Tree must be crushed
[1:00:35] and we won't go into it tonight because
[1:00:37] I could completely Sidetrack our
[1:00:39] thoughts but I want you to think about
[1:00:42] it
[1:00:42] the fruit of the Olive Tree
[1:00:47] must be crushed
[1:00:50] not only is that a representation of our
[1:00:52] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:54] but is a representation of the events
[1:00:56] that take place in the world today
[1:00:58] then it must come to a place that the
[1:01:01] spirit of God becomes the only thing
[1:01:03] that Israel and of course we know the
[1:01:05] scripture says not all that is Israel is
[1:01:07] Israel so you look at that we must be
[1:01:10] crushed there must be a pressing in
[1:01:12] there must be a pressure that is brought
[1:01:15] to bear to bring forth the oil of the
[1:01:18] olive but my brother and sister I'm
[1:01:21] going to just throw this out to you real
[1:01:22] quick before I move on look what causes
[1:01:25] us to seek the Holy Ghost
[1:01:28] it is not lacks living it is not
[1:01:30] pleasure it is not ease
[1:01:34] it's in a season of crushing it's in a
[1:01:36] season of distress it's in a season of
[1:01:38] hard times that we get down and say Lord
[1:01:41] forgive us forgive us for our
[1:01:44] lackadaisical ways or forgive us a
[1:01:46] little besetting sins these things and
[1:01:48] we press into it it's in the time of
[1:01:50] trouble
[1:01:51] not in a time of ease and God says you
[1:01:54] know what I'm going to let my church
[1:01:55] she's going to come right to this face
[1:01:58] and we're going to type these things
[1:01:59] here in a minute if you don't mind and
[1:02:01] just to give a representation
[1:02:04] but the Holy Ghost has come to us my
[1:02:06] brother and sister we're no no longer
[1:02:08] looking in the message I I don't want to
[1:02:10] be negative but there are some people
[1:02:12] they're still looking out here this must
[1:02:14] be and that must be but the prophet of
[1:02:16] God said that this is just paraphrasing
[1:02:18] everything we need
[1:02:20] to make the raptures already in US
[1:02:22] this is not a matter of going and
[1:02:24] finding something this is a matter of
[1:02:26] releasing what's already in US
[1:02:29] and the Holy Ghost is what is coming and
[1:02:31] unlocking the doors of our life and
[1:02:34] releasing these things in our life it is
[1:02:36] not deep teaching as it were it is not
[1:02:39] through the sky Revelations that people
[1:02:41] would come but it is the moving of the
[1:02:44] Holy Spirit bringing us into a deeper
[1:02:46] consecration lighting the fire remember
[1:02:49] it was olive oil that was there and
[1:02:51] that's where the fire come from they
[1:02:53] didn't go to find a chunk of wood to
[1:02:55] stick there it was an oil amen that come
[1:02:58] down the holy spirit that fed that life
[1:03:01] and brought light to the believer amen
[1:03:04] and that's what's happening right here
[1:03:05] in the hour we are living in
[1:03:07] you see now in second Corinthians the
[1:03:10] fourth chapter the tenth verse
[1:03:12] it says here always bearing about in the
[1:03:15] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[1:03:19] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:03:21] manifest in our body now this is
[1:03:25] interesting because depending on what
[1:03:27] Bible they say they're King James but
[1:03:30] depending on what Bible bring that oh it
[1:03:32] is still okay so some Bibles my brother
[1:03:35] and sister actually say that the life
[1:03:37] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:03:40] our mortal flesh
[1:03:44] so catch that
[1:03:46] connection of mortality
[1:03:49] without him there is no eternal life
[1:03:53] and this flesh is going to
[1:03:55] this old mortal flesh it's a little
[1:03:57] different than saying our body
[1:04:00] God put a time stamp
[1:04:03] on our flesh and says here it is your
[1:04:06] flesh this mortal flesh has a season
[1:04:12] and in that season
[1:04:13] it will manifest our lord Jesus
[1:04:19] I was a little
[1:04:20] self when I read and I you know you have
[1:04:23] this
[1:04:25] um and I I actually it's like wow
[1:04:28] one says mortal flesh one says body
[1:04:31] and in that I was like which is right
[1:04:33] but really the reality of is exactly the
[1:04:35] same thing this body is just mortal
[1:04:40] amen not looking to make this flesh
[1:04:43] Supernatural God will use it for
[1:04:46] Supernatural things and he will manifest
[1:04:48] the supernatural in us but my brother
[1:04:50] and sister it's not this flesh that
[1:04:52] God's redeeming so you look at this now
[1:04:55] that we bear in our bodies the dying of
[1:04:58] our Lord Jesus amen that the life of
[1:05:01] Jesus might be made manifest in my flesh
[1:05:04] your flesh amen so what is it God's
[1:05:07] given you the capacity now my brother
[1:05:09] and sister it's so incredible to me when
[1:05:12] you look around in the world today and
[1:05:14] you'll see just in natural people or
[1:05:16] just in the realm of Believers you'll
[1:05:19] see such incredible talent that has been
[1:05:22] given uh to to uh people you'll look out
[1:05:26] here to take the athlete not in the
[1:05:28] perverted sense of the world today but
[1:05:30] just somebody that is so athletic to run
[1:05:33] and jump and do all of these things that
[1:05:36] you know they just have such abilities
[1:05:38] and so they have that ability as it were
[1:05:41] maybe their lungs or their heart is a
[1:05:43] little bit bigger and and these kind of
[1:05:45] things and some can just sing you know
[1:05:48] I'm amazed when we were in South Africa
[1:05:50] that there was just these little girls
[1:05:52] you know I'm always always just amazed
[1:05:54] when you have a little girl that's got
[1:05:57] lungs as big as this pulpit
[1:05:59] you know they can just sing out and I'm
[1:06:02] like I run out of air
[1:06:04] and they still just sing and that's a
[1:06:06] gift God has given them
[1:06:08] Picture Perfect they know the notes and
[1:06:11] the highs and the lows and the timing
[1:06:13] and I Marvel at that
[1:06:16] and God has given some a memory
[1:06:19] where literally they can just quote
[1:06:22] scripture or quotes they can just you
[1:06:25] know there's a brother back East that
[1:06:26] that when we were visiting with them a
[1:06:29] few years ago I was there you know this
[1:06:32] is Paul I'm sorry I don't want to speak
[1:06:34] ill I'm not going to claim anything of
[1:06:35] the devil but you know uh you know I
[1:06:38] might even have to ask Jerry what's our
[1:06:40] home phone number I did that yesterday
[1:06:44] and here's the brother I'm saying you
[1:06:46] know brother Branham said duh duh and he
[1:06:48] goes oh that is in the countdown page 19
[1:06:52] paragraph 46.
[1:06:55] and I'm like if you don't mind I'm gonna
[1:06:58] verify that
[1:07:00] and it's right
[1:07:02] that's a gift God's given him
[1:07:05] there's all these things that God has
[1:07:07] given us but I tell you my brother and
[1:07:10] sister there's one thing that God has
[1:07:12] given to the bride of Christ and that is
[1:07:14] a capacity to be anointed in this mortal
[1:07:17] flesh to do the supernatural to be able
[1:07:20] when we hear the word to know that it is
[1:07:23] the word and say Amen to the word and it
[1:07:25] is not something we have to conjure
[1:07:27] ourselves to but it is in us it's a word
[1:07:30] speaking and the word responding and
[1:07:33] that is a gift Supernatural that God has
[1:07:35] given to you and I I might not be the
[1:07:38] smartest I might not be able to run the
[1:07:39] fastest might not be able to remember
[1:07:41] the whatever but one thing God has given
[1:07:44] I'll say if you don't mind for a minute
[1:07:46] just to speak of myself God has given me
[1:07:48] ability to say Amen to the word of God
[1:07:51] and I don't need to be the smartest man
[1:07:53] on the block or the strongest man on the
[1:07:55] Block but to be able to say Amen to this
[1:07:58] word and to live this word is a
[1:08:01] supernatural gift that God has given
[1:08:03] amen that's a capacity the anointing on
[1:08:06] this old mortal flesh to do the
[1:08:08] Supernatural and we tie that right back
[1:08:10] Christ in you amen it is not Paul it is
[1:08:13] not Trevor it's not David it's not Alex
[1:08:16] or whoever it might be it's Christ in us
[1:08:19] that is speaking back to the word amen I
[1:08:24] tell you I thank God for that otherwise
[1:08:27] well I say this jokingly our visitors
[1:08:29] won't quite understand but I'm a high
[1:08:31] school dropout
[1:08:33] amen not proud of it but I'm not ashamed
[1:08:36] of it either
[1:08:37] but I'll tell you what
[1:08:39] when I was in school brother sister all
[1:08:41] I could do is sit there and look out the
[1:08:42] window and wonder why do they have us
[1:08:44] trapped inside of here
[1:08:46] all I wanted was out
[1:08:49] and I got out
[1:08:53] but one thing
[1:08:55] I know now
[1:08:57] whatever steps I have walked in my life
[1:09:00] God chose to bring me face to face with
[1:09:04] the word
[1:09:06] diploma won't matter
[1:09:08] a master is a PhD none of that will
[1:09:11] matter but the grace of God that he has
[1:09:15] poured into us hallelujah
[1:09:18] amen and you know what look at this life
[1:09:21] it cannot be made manifest without the
[1:09:23] Holy Ghost it's just that simple we can
[1:09:25] be religious we can go to church we can
[1:09:27] have a faithful faithful attendance
[1:09:28] record but without the Holy Ghost it
[1:09:31] will not be manifested to the degree
[1:09:33] that God desires and can we see what
[1:09:36] this means to us it means this old
[1:09:38] mortal flesh that we're looking and
[1:09:40] criticizing and we see as a failure has
[1:09:43] become a house of the greatest power
[1:09:45] that has ever come on the earth it is a
[1:09:47] home as it were to the Holy Spirit and
[1:09:50] moving forward to do the greatest thing
[1:09:53] that has taken place since our Lord
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ and it's taking the world
[1:09:58] that we live in and purging it and
[1:10:00] bringing forth the word in a
[1:10:02] manifestation in mortal flesh
[1:10:06] oh it would be something if God just
[1:10:08] brought down Supernatural men and women
[1:10:10] and they were just perfect and then God
[1:10:12] put the word in that but God said I'm
[1:10:14] not worried about that I have got the
[1:10:17] answer to the devil's question and I can
[1:10:20] take mortal flesh and anointed to
[1:10:22] believe the word to act on the word to
[1:10:24] manifest the word and you say oh brother
[1:10:26] Paul where are you going we'll be there
[1:10:28] in a minute
[1:10:29] amen I'm telling you my brother and
[1:10:31] sister that we just have to acknowledge
[1:10:33] this is incredible
[1:10:35] this is incredible what God has done
[1:10:37] he's taken just common old people all
[1:10:39] over the Earth common old people
[1:10:42] now I don't speak ill of this but I want
[1:10:44] you to understand this in South Africa I
[1:10:46] dealt with brothers that I kind of
[1:10:48] almost wondered if they probably could
[1:10:50] even write their name but I tell you
[1:10:52] what at the preaching of the word they
[1:10:53] had already recognized their name was
[1:10:55] written in heaven amen they might not
[1:10:57] have been so bright as it were in
[1:10:59] intellectual eyes or whatever on the
[1:11:01] Earth today but those men when they
[1:11:03] heard the word preached you were right
[1:11:05] there to see them yes yes yes yes that's
[1:11:09] me praise the Lord amen amen which would
[1:11:13] we want to be
[1:11:15] oh my tell me it's not Incredible God
[1:11:18] brought us right out put his word in US
[1:11:22] now let's look into the tree but let's
[1:11:24] not forget the spiritual side here for
[1:11:26] just a few minutes if you don't mind
[1:11:30] the Olive Tree
[1:11:32] a lot of this I
[1:11:35] garnered from our guide yair
[1:11:39] and he shared you know I asked him hey
[1:11:40] what about this what about that
[1:11:43] it was interesting
[1:11:45] remember in the biblical Garden
[1:11:49] the Olive Tree
[1:11:51] they weren't sure how old those trees
[1:11:52] were but they acknowledged they were
[1:11:54] quite old there
[1:11:55] and you know with age the Olive Tree
[1:11:58] does not get pretty it actually kind of
[1:12:00] gets a little bit ugly
[1:12:03] and around the base of the tree above
[1:12:05] the root Crown around the base of the
[1:12:07] tree it starts putting out all these
[1:12:09] almost seemed like maybe there was some
[1:12:11] kind of pathogen or mold and the tree
[1:12:13] was responding and it has all these
[1:12:16] nodules and all these bulges that was
[1:12:18] out there that are there's nothing
[1:12:20] pretty about them but when we were
[1:12:22] talking to him he says this is a mature
[1:12:24] tree and it puts those uh that growth
[1:12:27] out like that and it's actually a water
[1:12:30] tank
[1:12:31] what that tree has come into maturity in
[1:12:34] that tree now has put on this growth and
[1:12:37] when there's sufficient water it draws
[1:12:39] this water in and stores it
[1:12:42] then anybody find a scripture that God
[1:12:45] says he's going to have pretty
[1:12:46] Christians
[1:12:49] but he's going to have strong enduring
[1:12:51] Christians
[1:12:53] he's going to have sons and daughters of
[1:12:55] God that can survive
[1:12:57] in the good times and in the bad they
[1:12:59] can survive when the the spirit of God
[1:13:02] is moving in plenty then survive when
[1:13:05] things seem to be dry and we say but but
[1:13:08] you know I wonder about this family or
[1:13:10] that family or that church seems like
[1:13:12] there may be a little dry well my
[1:13:14] brother and sister God has placed in
[1:13:16] them the ability to wither uh whether
[1:13:19] the the drought hey man they're not
[1:13:22] gonna dry up and blow away God has given
[1:13:25] to them the ability and so you see that
[1:13:28] in this this tree has been made by God
[1:13:31] to be able to survive an extended
[1:13:34] drought and I hope you don't mind
[1:13:35] because this could be a little confusing
[1:13:37] the bride of Christ here in
[1:13:41] the world I'll just put it the world not
[1:13:43] even narrow it down or maybe I shouldn't
[1:13:45] be rude to all the rest of the world
[1:13:46] we'll just call it the United States did
[1:13:48] you realize bride we're in a drought
[1:13:51] um
[1:13:53] amen you just walk out here go down the
[1:13:55] streets go to the shopping mall the
[1:13:57] grocery store everywhere you'll see we
[1:13:59] are in a drought
[1:14:01] you see it's not just that the spirit of
[1:14:03] God is laying around everywhere but the
[1:14:05] bride of Christ right the prophet of God
[1:14:07] talked about storing it in a storehouse
[1:14:09] tying back to Joseph soaring in a sore
[1:14:11] house you realize that the very holy
[1:14:13] spirit that we long and cry for and we
[1:14:16] are blessed to have is being stored up
[1:14:18] as it were inside of you and I and it's
[1:14:21] not the world's idea of a Christian it's
[1:14:24] not some people's idea of what is a
[1:14:26] Christian but God said I will place in
[1:14:28] you everything you need to make the
[1:14:31] Rapture that doesn't come into a Time
[1:14:33] When sin and wickedness is on every
[1:14:35] corner you can't look up down sideways
[1:14:37] without seeing wickedness my brother and
[1:14:39] sister God's got a Reservoir in the
[1:14:41] bride of Christ that will carry her
[1:14:43] through
[1:14:44] all I can say is thank you Lord
[1:14:47] amen and did you know that you can burn
[1:14:52] an olive tree until it looks
[1:14:55] completely destroyed
[1:14:57] and if the rains come
[1:15:00] in the right season
[1:15:03] it will produce
[1:15:05] a sprig
[1:15:07] and will grow an entirely new tree
[1:15:10] on top of that one
[1:15:14] the devil tries to throw things that
[1:15:17] Scorch us
[1:15:18] that burns us and hurts us and seemingly
[1:15:22] is destroyed I'm telling you I've shared
[1:15:24] this with the church my brother and
[1:15:26] sister but we're seeing God move and
[1:15:28] people away from the message for 30 and
[1:15:30] 40 years are coming back and coming to
[1:15:33] the Altar and for asking forgiveness
[1:15:35] they have been burned by every spirit in
[1:15:37] every condition there is in laodicea
[1:15:40] from homosexuality to whatever else you
[1:15:43] might want to name they've been burned
[1:15:45] by that but God brings them in the water
[1:15:47] of the word touches their life and a new
[1:15:49] sprig comes out of that and God restores
[1:15:53] not a sprig or a limb but a whole new
[1:15:56] tree a whole new creature in Christ
[1:15:59] Jesus a whole new creation
[1:16:02] amen and so you can burn the Olive Tree
[1:16:06] but with a moisture
[1:16:10] it will still live
[1:16:12] I thought this was interesting when yair
[1:16:15] told us
[1:16:16] that you can tear a limb off of an olive
[1:16:19] tree
[1:16:20] you can throw it out in the road where
[1:16:22] there's not one drop of moisture one
[1:16:24] drop of soil and it will lay there for
[1:16:27] days and weeks until it looks like
[1:16:29] nothing but a dry stick but you take
[1:16:33] that dry stick and you plant it in
[1:16:36] fertile soil and give it some water and
[1:16:39] it comes back to life
[1:16:41] oh my brother and sister I tell you
[1:16:43] there's I think every one of us has went
[1:16:45] through times in our life amen our young
[1:16:47] people are just in an onslaught of this
[1:16:49] world right now where Satan's just
[1:16:51] trying to just bring them where they're
[1:16:53] just a dry stick laying on the side of
[1:16:55] the road and people look at it and say
[1:16:57] well I guess they weren't believers they
[1:16:59] look at themselves and say yes I wasn't
[1:17:01] a Believer but God comes and takes them
[1:17:04] and brings them over into the fertile
[1:17:06] soil of the word and plants them again
[1:17:08] and the water of the word comes and
[1:17:10] starts to touch their life and something
[1:17:12] down inside comes to life and they say I
[1:17:16] don't want to die I don't belong to
[1:17:18] laodicea I want to live and God Waters
[1:17:22] that and brings forth a whole tree
[1:17:25] Hallelujah
[1:17:27] I think that's so wonderful when you
[1:17:29] look at this these are things my brother
[1:17:31] and sister than a man who is not even a
[1:17:34] believer in the New Testament
[1:17:36] can share
[1:17:39] because
[1:17:40] it's truth
[1:17:42] it's reality
[1:17:48] in the harshness of times
[1:17:51] the Olive Tree
[1:17:53] will produce very little fruit
[1:18:02] foreign
[1:18:03] Good Times
[1:18:06] it will produce an abundance
[1:18:09] of fruit
[1:18:14] in the good time yes
[1:18:17] I'll praise your name
[1:18:21] in the bad times
[1:18:24] I'll do
[1:18:25] the same
[1:18:30] and God built that into the tree nobody
[1:18:33] had to go out there and say now you're
[1:18:34] an olive tree and we need you at least
[1:18:37] in the drought times to at least put on
[1:18:38] a couple olives
[1:18:41] and in the Good Times Union branches
[1:18:43] need to just hang so heavy
[1:18:47] so this is what we want you to do no
[1:18:48] this is in it
[1:18:51] this is the nature God put in the olive
[1:18:53] tree
[1:18:54] and the olive tree doesn't need someone
[1:18:56] to go out there and say you can do it
[1:18:58] you can do it it does it
[1:19:00] Hallelujah and when God placed that seed
[1:19:03] Gene in you and I before the foundation
[1:19:05] of the world he doesn't have to say well
[1:19:08] I hope that that will produce I hope
[1:19:10] that will do what I wanted to do he
[1:19:12] knows it will now we as humans sometimes
[1:19:15] we need some encouragement don't we we
[1:19:17] need somebody to Pat us on the back in
[1:19:18] the hard times and say brother sister
[1:19:20] you can do it we're praying for you my
[1:19:23] brother and sister but there has to be
[1:19:25] something down inside that man or that
[1:19:28] woman to say I can't give up I've got to
[1:19:31] serve God I've got to
[1:19:34] oh the Cyrene song the world is saying
[1:19:37] come come look how beautiful we are well
[1:19:40] I'll tell you my brother and sister this
[1:19:42] will sound harsh and forgive me but I'm
[1:19:44] telling you I wonder if all those
[1:19:46] beautiful women are so beautiful if they
[1:19:48] take all the remnant of laodicea off of
[1:19:51] them
[1:19:54] why because the prophet and the word
[1:19:56] shows us clearly that beauty is in
[1:19:59] character
[1:20:01] now look in the ages my brother and
[1:20:03] sister in all the ages character has
[1:20:06] been important but there's never been an
[1:20:08] emphasis in the word of God about
[1:20:11] character like there has been in this
[1:20:13] final Church age in this time God has
[1:20:16] placed such a significance on character
[1:20:20] why because we're living in a world that
[1:20:24] is bankrupt
[1:20:25] and God said one of the separations is
[1:20:28] going to be is in this time when it's
[1:20:30] about oh I can do this and I'm that and
[1:20:32] I'm pretty have you ever seen the time
[1:20:34] I'm let me just put it this way
[1:20:37] I'm not that old I'm still a young man
[1:20:43] don't you be laughing
[1:20:46] if when I was 18 you'd have saw somebody
[1:20:49] with one of them square box Kodak
[1:20:51] cameras
[1:20:52] holding that thing out
[1:20:58] we to hold them off and committed them
[1:21:02] but look at the world we live in now
[1:21:04] everywhere now if you do that I'm not
[1:21:06] judging you
[1:21:08] but everywhere we look in the world
[1:21:11] self
[1:21:13] and then it's funny about the Selfies oh
[1:21:16] let's do a selfie together
[1:21:18] click let me see it well I really don't
[1:21:21] want to show you let me see it
[1:21:22] I'm not in the picture
[1:21:26] they're standing right there with
[1:21:27] somebody and they just selfied themself
[1:21:31] what is the spirit of laodicea itself
[1:21:33] self self-indulgent self-pleasing
[1:21:36] self-fulfilling my brother and sister
[1:21:38] selfish
[1:21:41] and so we see how this Spirit of the age
[1:21:43] is having this impact or effect on
[1:21:46] people
[1:21:47] and it's there my brother and sister
[1:21:49] that this world we're living in right
[1:21:52] now God says you know what I've anointed
[1:21:54] you to produce fruit no matter where
[1:21:55] you're at
[1:21:56] I don't care whether you are rich or
[1:21:58] poor whether you live in a fluent
[1:22:00] country or a fluent city or a fluent
[1:22:02] neighborhood or whether you on the back
[1:22:04] streets my brother and sister I'm
[1:22:06] telling you this reminded us of Chile
[1:22:08] actually a lot and that we're there in
[1:22:10] South Africa and and it's amazing it
[1:22:13] really is truly amazing they have a law
[1:22:15] there that if somebody has a house
[1:22:16] regardless of what it is how they have
[1:22:18] to provide electricity to them and so
[1:22:20] right on the shoulders of the freeway
[1:22:22] for going forever and ever and ever they
[1:22:25] have built all these little Shanty
[1:22:27] houses and trust me I'm not being
[1:22:29] derogatory that's just what they are
[1:22:31] they're pallets and tin and they have
[1:22:33] all these power lines running everywhere
[1:22:35] and you know one of these days that
[1:22:37] thing's probably gonna all those things
[1:22:38] gonna burn down because just somebody
[1:22:39] shorts something out now you look at
[1:22:42] that my brother and sister there are
[1:22:44] believers in that condition
[1:22:47] talking naturally
[1:22:50] and we have two and three cars live in a
[1:22:53] nice home
[1:22:54] does that make any difference no sir
[1:22:56] because that anointed word that
[1:22:58] Supernatural that come down into their
[1:23:00] soul is the exact same Supernatural that
[1:23:03] has come down into our soul
[1:23:05] amen we think well God would surely drag
[1:23:07] him out of their poverty no somebody's
[1:23:09] got to live in that neighborhood to
[1:23:10] spread the gospel
[1:23:12] I wonder if maybe they don't have more
[1:23:14] character than we do
[1:23:18] that sounded judgmental didn't it
[1:23:23] you see there's a supernatural anointing
[1:23:25] that anoints the promise that God said
[1:23:27] I'll keep you
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:30] the work I began in you
[1:23:32] amen my brother and sister it's not as
[1:23:33] though God just spoke that across
[1:23:35] Humanity that promise has rooted right
[1:23:37] down in our heart and the Holy Spirit
[1:23:39] has come right into our heart to come
[1:23:43] and fulfill that I'll never leave you
[1:23:45] I'll never forsake you that's not
[1:23:47] something we should have to go to church
[1:23:48] to hear to believe
[1:23:51] that should resonate in the heart of
[1:23:53] Sons and Daughters of God that we would
[1:23:55] say this is God's word
[1:23:57] after all
[1:23:59] nobody has to tell the Olive Tree it's
[1:24:02] raining
[1:24:03] you should drink
[1:24:10] in question answered in Hebrews
[1:24:12] part two
[1:24:13] 1957.
[1:24:16] now brother Brian was referencing just
[1:24:18] so people won't say now you're confused
[1:24:21] on your trees because you'll see that
[1:24:22] brother Brown includes all other trees
[1:24:24] in there listen he said the Generation
[1:24:27] seed the Fig Tree putting forth its buds
[1:24:29] now watch he said the Fig Tree all the
[1:24:31] other trees now in other words they'd be
[1:24:33] a universal Revival at that time now
[1:24:36] watch this prophecy how it works in and
[1:24:38] just Blends in perfect now watch all
[1:24:41] other trees putting forth their buds
[1:24:43] Reviving now I want you if you if you
[1:24:46] care enough or you want to do to go read
[1:24:49] this because you'll find brother Brown
[1:24:50] making references to Billy Graham and
[1:24:53] other Ministries
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:56] in fact in fact brother Branham I
[1:24:59] believe it's in this quote
[1:25:00] says that uh
[1:25:02] brother Neville
[1:25:04] was a way better preacher
[1:25:06] than Billy Graham
[1:25:08] you talk about giving somebody a
[1:25:09] compliment
[1:25:11] my the world just revers Billy Graham is
[1:25:13] a great preacher and brother Brown's
[1:25:15] like brother Neville's better than he is
[1:25:17] hmm
[1:25:18] too bad sister April ain't here tonight
[1:25:24] there'd be a universal Revival at that
[1:25:26] time now watch this prophecy how it
[1:25:28] works in and just Blends in perfectly
[1:25:30] now watch all other trees putting forth
[1:25:32] their buds Reviving a tree when it's
[1:25:34] putting forth its buds is Reviving is
[1:25:36] that right now anyone knows a prophetic
[1:25:39] teacher that the fig tree has always
[1:25:41] been the Jew and we know that and it's
[1:25:44] the Jew now
[1:25:49] and look at Joel when he come took it
[1:25:52] over he said what the Palmer worm left
[1:25:54] the caterpillar eat and what the
[1:25:56] caterpillar laughed the locusts eat and
[1:25:59] what the locusts eat if you notice
[1:26:00] that's the very same insect in different
[1:26:02] stages the Palmer worm the caterpillar
[1:26:04] the locus all the same bug just
[1:26:06] different stages of its life now watch
[1:26:08] that same bug begin to eat on that
[1:26:11] Jewish tree back there and cut it down
[1:26:13] and it began to eat and eat and eat and
[1:26:16] to eat till it took it to a stump are
[1:26:19] you following this
[1:26:21] are you following this you see God had
[1:26:23] to bring it I'm gonna get ahead of
[1:26:24] myself but God had to bring it to the
[1:26:27] place of the season of the grafting
[1:26:32] you don't go out there with a tree
[1:26:33] that's got all its Limbs and all its
[1:26:35] foliage and and cut it and try and graft
[1:26:37] another limb into just be another limb
[1:26:39] of the deal my brother and sister God
[1:26:41] let all of these Spirits chew that down
[1:26:46] till it was a stump
[1:26:49] and then he said I will restore saith
[1:26:52] the Lord all the years that the
[1:26:54] caterpillar eat of I'll make my people a
[1:26:56] joy see now the tree has been eaten down
[1:26:59] the Gentiles was grafted into it that's
[1:27:03] true all right
[1:27:05] we must bring fruit
[1:27:08] why we just read this scripture where
[1:27:09] the life is in the root
[1:27:11] amen so it's not for us to say well I
[1:27:14] was expecting something different God
[1:27:16] grafted us into the life amen I'm so
[1:27:19] glad today he grafted us he took us out
[1:27:22] of Mormonism and Catholicism and Jehovah
[1:27:25] Witnesses and he took us out of all of
[1:27:27] these things of our life bar rooms and
[1:27:29] whatever it might have been he took us
[1:27:31] all of that and grafted us into life
[1:27:34] I'll tell you what it makes my heart
[1:27:37] amen I never was in all of those things
[1:27:39] but I tell you what I certainly
[1:27:41] qualified as a sinner
[1:27:43] and God said you know what I'm going to
[1:27:45] graft you Paul right into the life and
[1:27:47] that life is not going to go oh
[1:27:51] you're not a Jew
[1:27:54] you're not a Jew
[1:27:58] no sir it said here's something
[1:28:00] Desiring life
[1:28:03] and it's ordained to life
[1:28:06] because see I learned a lot of years ago
[1:28:07] with friends in the orchard business
[1:28:10] that
[1:28:12] there is actually a technique
[1:28:14] some men rafting trees just believe that
[1:28:18] you can cut in to the tree Slide the
[1:28:21] Graft in
[1:28:23] and it'll just be fine
[1:28:25] other men
[1:28:26] look at that same stump
[1:28:29] and say
[1:28:31] The graft needs to go
[1:28:33] here
[1:28:35] for one reason they do is if you have a
[1:28:39] stump that's got a primary limb coming
[1:28:42] out and you graft it in on the low side
[1:28:45] you're going to have a limb that's going
[1:28:47] to be weak
[1:28:49] won't be able to stand the load of its
[1:28:51] own fruit
[1:28:53] and ultimately will break out of the
[1:28:55] graft and collapse
[1:28:58] so you need to position the Graft in the
[1:29:00] right place
[1:29:04] and God said I know right where to graft
[1:29:06] you in
[1:29:08] I got a revealed word
[1:29:10] that's rooted deep in my word
[1:29:13] and I'm going to graft you into that
[1:29:15] revealed word where you can stand as
[1:29:18] Sons and Daughters of God not falling
[1:29:20] down not giving up not weak not bearing
[1:29:24] any fruit but grafted it's right into
[1:29:26] the right place that the word coming and
[1:29:28] the Life coming from the root and we
[1:29:30] could just turn and grow and look to the
[1:29:32] rising of the Sun and produce much fruit
[1:29:35] in the day that we live in
[1:29:37] oh I tell you what my brother and sister
[1:29:39] it just makes my heart amen Oh we must
[1:29:43] bring fruit
[1:29:45] now look I never wanted to cherry pick
[1:29:47] these things so certainly you can look
[1:29:49] and make these notes
[1:29:51] I was afraid I wouldn't have enough to
[1:29:52] preach tonight
[1:29:54] you know it's just terrible
[1:29:59] look at this Olive Tree completely
[1:30:01] shredded down to nothing
[1:30:04] seemingly completely finished
[1:30:08] put forth a shoot
[1:30:11] and grow a whole new tree on top of that
[1:30:16] remember when brother Branham was with
[1:30:18] the brothers down there in Arizona
[1:30:20] they're talking about grafting
[1:30:22] and brother Brown's like so now let me
[1:30:24] get this right
[1:30:25] if you grasped graph a a grapefruit into
[1:30:29] this tree when it next year it will
[1:30:34] produce an orange
[1:30:37] seems reasonable wouldn't it
[1:30:40] the life is coming from an orange tree
[1:30:46] but it gets a lesson
[1:30:48] that turns into you might say
[1:30:51] collaboration with the word
[1:30:54] coordinating and he comes
[1:30:56] and is able to tell us and show us
[1:30:59] the life
[1:31:00] that's in it
[1:31:02] will produce
[1:31:04] well the Olive Tree is representation of
[1:31:07] Jews of Israel
[1:31:10] but he grafted us into it
[1:31:13] and it's the life
[1:31:16] it's the life
[1:31:18] it's not who we are it's not who we
[1:31:20] think we are just as we'd say oh I've
[1:31:22] got the Lord no my brother and sister
[1:31:24] he's got us
[1:31:26] because the life is in the root amen and
[1:31:29] so God Has Come grafted you and I into
[1:31:31] this amen we the wild
[1:31:36] the wild
[1:31:38] come on some of us have to look back in
[1:31:40] our life and we the wild we really
[1:31:43] understand that I read that and I'm like
[1:31:45] Oh my how that hits home we the wild
[1:31:48] have been grafted into the team we of
[1:31:52] the nether nature were grafted into it
[1:31:54] and now we are not creatures of laodicea
[1:31:58] but we're creatures we're the
[1:31:59] manifestation of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:32:03] hallelujah
[1:32:04] I don't know I don't think iPads have
[1:32:06] pages so to speak or at least this
[1:32:08] document doesn't but I think I've got my
[1:32:10] point across sister Ruth will you come
[1:32:13] amen now you look at this now one more
[1:32:16] quote I pulled that one on you didn't I
[1:32:18] I didn't mean to but I just looked down
[1:32:20] and I saw this because now we see the
[1:32:23] prophet of God talking 1957
[1:32:27] there's 144 000 there's your servants so
[1:32:31] the children of the kingdom here dear
[1:32:33] person who asked the question who asked
[1:32:35] this notable question I think I might
[1:32:36] have left it back here in somewhere but
[1:32:38] when they shall be cast out doesn't mean
[1:32:42] that they will be cast out of God's mind
[1:32:44] they are cast out of the spiritual
[1:32:46] benefit for the season
[1:32:49] well I'll tell you what we saw that in
[1:32:50] Israel and I don't mean to be rude or
[1:32:52] crude I probably shared it with most of
[1:32:54] you but we sit right there and at the
[1:32:56] Dead Sea at the table and you'll see a
[1:32:59] couple there and the the lady putting
[1:33:01] her kids down and the man getting up and
[1:33:03] he's dressed correctly and he's reading
[1:33:05] the pages as he's doing everything
[1:33:07] correctly but my brother and sister you
[1:33:09] look over there and here's a man doing
[1:33:12] all these religious things but here's
[1:33:14] his wife dressed not no no lady should
[1:33:17] be in public dressed like this so here
[1:33:19] he is ultra religious right here but
[1:33:21] it's not being reflected and so God took
[1:33:24] these spiritual blessings from them for
[1:33:26] the season to understand who and what
[1:33:28] they should be in the word has been gone
[1:33:30] for a season but he's not to keep it
[1:33:32] from them
[1:33:33] see for just a little season because
[1:33:36] when the prophet saw Israel on the day
[1:33:38] that she was coming to he said well
[1:33:40] Israel will be when the Sabbath will be
[1:33:42] taken away and they shall sell on the
[1:33:44] Sabbath the same as any other day and
[1:33:46] that's right now
[1:33:47] in Israel
[1:33:50] they'll tell you right off you ask them
[1:33:52] a question now how does this work with
[1:33:55] the Sabbath
[1:33:57] uh well we're Jews
[1:34:00] we believe all this
[1:34:02] but it's the ultra-orthodox that are
[1:34:04] worried about all of that
[1:34:08] see they have an identity
[1:34:10] that we are Jews we believe just as much
[1:34:13] as they do
[1:34:15] but that's their thing
[1:34:20] 1957
[1:34:23] 2000 and
[1:34:25] while we were there in 22 but
[1:34:28] 2022 this has come to pass in Israel
[1:34:33] very little regard
[1:34:35] very very little regard
[1:34:38] I think if we dug through the message
[1:34:39] dug through the Bible dug through the
[1:34:41] message it would probably shock us
[1:34:43] at the amount of things that the prophet
[1:34:45] said it'll be like this one day and it's
[1:34:47] that way right now I believe it would
[1:34:50] just shock us
[1:34:51] and I would say that to put fear in
[1:34:53] anyone but I think it would shock us
[1:34:55] amen so it's there we see all these
[1:34:58] things he says well will Israel be
[1:35:00] completely forgotten and he said how
[1:35:03] high is it
[1:35:06] to the heaven how deep is the earth
[1:35:09] measure with that stick laying before
[1:35:10] you said I can't you see neither can I
[1:35:13] forget Israel certainly not Israel will
[1:35:16] never be forgotten so you see
[1:35:18] Everlasting and eternal is two different
[1:35:21] things Israel was cast out but not out
[1:35:24] of God's mind Paul speaks it over here
[1:35:27] if I had time to study I could quickly
[1:35:29] get to the scripture and refer them to
[1:35:31] you see what comes to my mind
[1:35:33] and uh we'll finish the quote right here
[1:35:36] Paul speaking over there said that for
[1:35:38] we Gentiles to take heed the way we
[1:35:41] walked and what we've done and we should
[1:35:43] as message Believers we need to still
[1:35:44] take heed
[1:35:46] it is not an absolute
[1:35:49] go Pasco collect 200 and actually God's
[1:35:52] called us to a higher consecration a
[1:35:55] higher dedication a higher Devotion to
[1:35:57] the word a higher standard
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:02] begin grafting in in Israel which was
[1:36:05] blinded for a season he said just for a
[1:36:06] season Israel was blinded that's right
[1:36:08] but the veil will be lifted from their
[1:36:11] eye and that is when the last Gentile is
[1:36:14] born in the kingdom of God then their
[1:36:16] veils lifted from Israel's eyes and
[1:36:18] they'll say this is the Messiah who we
[1:36:20] look to see that's right but the Gentile
[1:36:23] door is closed the ark is closed up
[1:36:25] there's no more no more grace left for
[1:36:27] the Gentile
[1:36:29] that's got to be close my brother and
[1:36:30] sister
[1:36:31] look people say you know when brother
[1:36:33] Branham said he believed the coming of
[1:36:34] the Lord was nigh could even be tomorrow
[1:36:36] I've heard people make statements like
[1:36:39] well that was just a figure of speech I
[1:36:42] don't believe so I believe the prophet
[1:36:44] of God living in the world as it were
[1:36:46] that he was seeing what God granted him
[1:36:48] to see believed it had to be right there
[1:36:50] and I tell you what I just uh the The
[1:36:53] church here our brothers and sisters
[1:36:54] we've just been talking about this and I
[1:36:57] just want to get more on fire for the
[1:36:59] Lord and I want my plea for I don't
[1:37:01] believe in resolutions but I want my
[1:37:03] plea for 2023 just a closer walk with
[1:37:06] the Lord because my brother and sister
[1:37:08] this is going to come to pass
[1:37:10] there's not a doubt it will come to pass
[1:37:13] and I say Lord I'm going to be ready I
[1:37:16] am going to be ready Hallelujah we love
[1:37:19] the Lord tonight
[1:37:21] Hallelujah I hope I didn't get to
[1:37:22] carried away
[1:37:24] I've still got a bunch of other little
[1:37:26] things to share here but I will keep
[1:37:29] moving along amen let's just stand and
[1:37:33] sing a couple songs before we dismiss
[1:37:38] amen
[1:37:42] I stand I stand In Awe
[1:37:46] and I do truly Saints as we were blessed
[1:37:49] so many different things in Israel that
[1:37:52] the Lord just opened our eyes to see
[1:37:56] oh my this is not at all like I thought
[1:37:59] it was
[1:38:01] right and God opened our eyes and then
[1:38:03] when my eyes is open to what the real
[1:38:04] reality of it is and then I go back and
