[25:06] sorry one second
[25:10] amen in the beginning was the
[25:14] word and the word was with god
[25:18] and the word was god
[25:22] the same was in the beginning the same
[25:24] was in the beginning with god
[25:26] all things were might made by him and
[25:28] without him was not
[25:29] anything made that was made in him was
[25:32] life
[25:33] and the life was the light of men and
[25:36] the light shineth in darkness and the
[25:38] darkness
[25:38] comprehended it not are you thankful
[25:41] that you comprehended the light
[25:44] amen there was a man sent from god whose
[25:47] name was john the same came for a
[25:49] witness to bear witness of the light
[25:51] that all men
[25:52] through him might believe he was not
[25:54] that light but was sent to bear a
[25:56] witness
[25:58] of that light you bear witness of the
[26:01] light
[26:02] that was the true light which lighteth
[26:04] every man that cometh
[26:06] into the world every man is given the
[26:08] opportunity
[26:10] to accept the life of christ he was in
[26:13] the world and the world was made by him
[26:14] and the world knew him not
[26:16] he came unto his own and his own
[26:18] received him not
[26:20] but as many as received him to them gave
[26:22] he power to become the sons of
[26:24] god you have the power
[26:27] what better person to give you power
[26:28] than jesus christ
[26:30] even to them that believe on his name
[26:34] which were born not of blood nor of the
[26:37] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[26:39] but of god may the lord add the blessing
[26:42] to the reading of his word
[26:43] and be seated tonight
[26:50] you know if you don't mind i'm actually
[26:51] going to put this back on
[26:53] it's kind of chilly up here
[26:56] i've been cold all day i don't know why
[26:58] okay praise the lord
[27:01] if i can't stay loose enough i'll have
[27:03] to take it off
[27:05] so tonight i'm going to speak on the
[27:07] book of acts part 3.
[27:10] um we did part 1 and part 2 some time
[27:12] back i don't expect you to remember
[27:14] that so i have to take my word for it
[27:17] but uh with part 1 we spoke about the
[27:19] ethiopian that
[27:20] philip ran after and we talked about how
[27:24] that um that is the way that god is is
[27:27] with
[27:27] us god goes after us um
[27:31] and uh then this part two we spoke of
[27:33] unmerited
[27:34] forgiveness now there's a lot of um
[27:38] archived sermons on the book of acts
[27:41] from different
[27:42] different churches um i
[27:45] my desire is that we look at the book of
[27:48] acts as more of a remembrance
[27:50] to show us and to to expound to us
[27:54] what god expects of us
[27:57] and the potential we have as sons and
[28:00] daughters of god
[28:02] put you in remembrance of those things
[28:04] as the scriptures say so our title
[28:06] tonight
[28:07] is damascus damascus road
[28:10] i knew i was going to have time have a
[28:11] hard time saying that but that was my
[28:13] title see look i'm already warmed up
[28:15] praise god
[28:16] so damascus road
[28:20] i read here in john that that jesus
[28:22] christ is the light
[28:24] and the light is the the light the light
[28:27] is the life
[28:29] of christ your bible should have it
[28:31] capitalize capital l because it's
[28:33] speaking of christ
[28:35] brother branham in this quote and this
[28:36] quote may seem a little bit um
[28:39] off with my title but we're going to lay
[28:41] a little bit of a groundwork and you
[28:42] just
[28:43] hang on for the ride and we'll trust god
[28:46] to
[28:46] pick up the rest praise the lord i have
[28:48] the beginning i don't know what the end
[28:49] is going to be
[28:50] but we're trusting in him 1965 god's
[28:53] chosen place of worship
[28:55] but the bible says he says notice all
[28:57] seven jewish
[28:58] feasts was kept in the same place they
[29:01] never kept
[29:02] one feast here for the methodist and one
[29:04] over here for the baptist
[29:06] one over there for the presbyterian one
[29:08] back here for the catholic
[29:09] and one for the protestant all seven
[29:12] feasts was kept in the same place
[29:16] it's a very beautiful type here we've
[29:18] just went through the seven church ages
[29:21] going to show that god keep all seven
[29:24] church ages
[29:24] and the youth group is going through the
[29:26] church age book right now
[29:28] we just read chapter one i also just
[29:30] want to thank the lord that they all got
[29:31] in
[29:32] to camp for those you didn't know the
[29:34] camp
[29:36] open registration opened at one o'clock
[29:38] and it was 16 people too many by 1 15.
[29:43] so we went really fast and brother ron
[29:46] there was 16 people too many in and so
[29:48] they had some people that had to refund
[29:50] but
[29:50] um brother on expected to take two days
[29:52] and it took 15 minutes
[29:54] to fill up so not to say that
[29:58] be selfish and say we want our kids over
[30:00] some other kids but
[30:01] we just want god's perfect will and that
[30:03] was his perfect will so be in prayer
[30:06] for that coming up in june anyways
[30:08] praise the lord back to
[30:10] this here this quote so he says
[30:15] it's a very beautiful type here we've
[30:16] just went through the seven church ages
[30:18] going to show that god keep all seven
[30:20] church ages in the word
[30:22] for each each church age produced a part
[30:25] of the word
[30:27] and whenever they produced it and and
[30:29] they saw the light
[30:30] so whenever they produced it that part
[30:32] of the word is because they saw that
[30:34] light
[30:35] shed on the gospel of christ he says
[30:37] just like the people who first
[30:38] discovered to baptize in jesus name
[30:41] what did they do they made a
[30:43] denomination out of it and it died right
[30:45] there
[30:46] so light came and shed truth to a
[30:49] portion of the scripture
[30:50] the sergeant god bless you this year uh
[30:53] brought a special a portion of truth to
[30:56] that aid
[30:57] they took that truth and they lived in
[31:00] the light of christ
[31:01] for a season but then they mixed their
[31:04] ideas with it and denominated and so god
[31:07] moved forward so he says they made a
[31:09] denomination out of it and it died right
[31:11] there
[31:11] then god moved right out into somebody
[31:13] else he will not stay in one of those
[31:16] creeds and dogmas
[31:17] he has nothing to do with it there is
[31:19] nothing perverted about god
[31:21] in other words denominations are
[31:23] perverted god's word is wholly
[31:25] unadulterated
[31:27] you can't have a denomination and not
[31:29] have adultery because adultery
[31:31] of the word of god is when you mix god's
[31:33] word partial
[31:34] truth with par with lies with ideas you
[31:38] came up with
[31:39] that sound good you mix that together
[31:41] you have committed adultery spiritually
[31:43] christ is god's center spot of worship
[31:46] i have that underlined and didn't get it
[31:48] transferred over god
[31:50] christ is god's center spot of worship
[31:53] he is god christ is the mystery of god
[31:55] revealed
[31:56] um and you are christ revealed
[31:59] to this generation all seven feasts must
[32:02] be kept in this one place
[32:04] you couldn't keep the feast in any other
[32:06] place it wouldn't work
[32:07] you can go do it if you want to but
[32:09] ain't gonna do nothing for you
[32:11] as a jew you couldn't go in and they
[32:13] couldn't go in and sacrifice them
[32:16] when the temple was set up in jerusalem
[32:17] they couldn't go sacrifice often
[32:19] somewhere else it had to be there at the
[32:21] temple that was where god
[32:22] said it that was where god's place was
[32:25] and it wouldn't work
[32:26] otherwise so they can do it they can
[32:29] make it look just like the real thing
[32:30] but they're not in the right spot
[32:31] they're not in in in those days it was a
[32:34] physical location
[32:35] in these days it's a it's it's a
[32:37] spiritual revelation of god's word
[32:39] and then you have to be right in line
[32:40] with christ to be in god's chosen place
[32:42] of worship
[32:43] so he says you couldn't keep the feast
[32:45] in the other place but
[32:47] them seven the seven feasts of the
[32:50] year must be kept in one place therefore
[32:52] the seven church ages had to come from
[32:54] the one single place
[32:56] that was christ speaking in all seven
[32:58] church ages
[32:59] that's where the message came from for
[33:01] each age it came from christ it didn't
[33:02] come from john wesley
[33:04] john wesley john wesley was a minister
[33:07] in the
[33:08] anglican church a dead church
[33:12] a dead idea man's idea denomination
[33:15] but god brought him god brought him the
[33:18] light
[33:19] we're gonna get to damascus road
[33:23] god brought him the light and moved him
[33:26] from what he
[33:27] thought was truth to what really was
[33:29] truth
[33:30] and that is god's provided place of
[33:32] worship
[33:34] he was in a place of worship but he
[33:37] wasn't
[33:38] in the one that god designated
[33:41] so okay okay praise the lord therefore
[33:44] the seven churches had to come from the
[33:46] one single place that was christ
[33:47] speaking in all seven church ages that's
[33:49] exactly right
[33:50] type of the seven church ages but they
[33:52] made denominations out of it
[33:53] this is a bit of a long quote but it
[33:55] lays a good foundation so bear with me
[33:57] now let's look at another type while
[34:00] we're along here
[34:01] that's the type of the passover
[34:02] foreshadowed jesus
[34:04] knee notice here the sacrifice of blood
[34:07] by death
[34:08] the sacrifice of blood was the place
[34:10] that foreshadowed christ
[34:11] can a denomination bleed could you think
[34:14] of a church bleeding a denominational
[34:16] bleeding
[34:17] certainly not it taken blood to bleed
[34:19] from a
[34:20] life i like how he says that you know
[34:23] because
[34:23] denomination can't bleed and we
[34:25] understand that but then he says it
[34:26] takes to bleed from a life in other
[34:28] words there ain't no life
[34:29] in the denomination and the life here
[34:32] jesus comes in view by the lamb the lamb
[34:34] was a type of christ
[34:35] and foreshadowed christ because he was
[34:37] the lamb of god
[34:38] that john introduced back to john here
[34:41] introducing christ the lamb of god the
[34:43] light the life
[34:44] of men for men um
[34:48] he says that takes away the sin of the
[34:49] world we find jesus coming into view
[34:51] here in exodus the 12th chapter speaking
[34:54] of the lamp
[34:55] the blood on the doorpost notice it was
[34:57] the only place
[34:58] death could not strike whoever had the
[35:01] blood on the doorposts
[35:05] it was the only place death could not
[35:06] strike when death was about to strike
[35:08] the land
[35:09] there had to be a certain place all from
[35:11] under this died
[35:12] only one place now it didn't mean it was
[35:15] one house
[35:16] they somebody could have said hey
[35:18] they've got blood on the doorposts
[35:20] and they could have went out and killed
[35:22] the cow and put blood on their door
[35:24] force
[35:24] posts but it would have done nothing to
[35:26] save them because that's not
[35:28] god's provided way it was the blood of a
[35:31] lamb
[35:32] because it had to type the blood of
[35:33] jesus christ so you see how
[35:35] they can do it and you maybe not even
[35:38] know i don't know can you tell the
[35:39] difference between blood's lamb
[35:40] lamb's blood and a cow's blood if it's
[35:43] on the wall no
[35:44] it looks the same but it's not it's
[35:47] totally different
[35:49] he says uh only one place now it didn't
[35:52] mean it was one house
[35:55] it's not one location it's not
[35:57] jeffersonville
[35:59] it's not kenai alaska
[36:02] it's it's underneath the blood of christ
[36:08] which you can't be under the blood of
[36:11] christ
[36:12] without a revelation of christ
[36:15] revelation
[36:15] goes hand in hand they had to have a
[36:18] revelation that killing that lamb would
[36:19] save them
[36:20] otherwise when that death angel come
[36:22] floating by
[36:24] they would have ran ran out and tried to
[36:26] run away from it
[36:27] but they had a revelation that that
[36:29] blood on the doorpost would protect them
[36:31] because they believed their message they
[36:33] had faith in revelation
[36:35] in god but there was one place that's
[36:38] where the lamb was killed
[36:39] where the lamb's blood was the death
[36:41] angel could not strike
[36:42] because it was the one place god had put
[36:45] his name
[36:46] and that lamb was named back there in
[36:48] the beginning a lamb notice it was the
[36:50] one place he could not strike
[36:52] he couldn't it's impossible now the same
[36:55] is today there is only one place that
[36:57] spiritual death cannot strike that's the
[36:59] word
[37:02] not the bible
[37:05] the bible is a book containing the words
[37:08] of god there's lots of people
[37:11] whose houses have the bible and that
[37:13] does nothing for them there's lots of
[37:15] churches who preach
[37:16] from the bible but there is no life but
[37:22] it takes
[37:23] revelation of christ in a revelation of
[37:27] the word um and that's where death
[37:30] cannot strike spiritual death cannot
[37:32] strike
[37:33] he says death can't strike the word
[37:35] because it's the living word
[37:36] of god because god's word
[37:40] alive is eternal meaning death can't
[37:43] touch it
[37:44] that's eternal cannot end
[37:48] never started cannot end
[37:51] death is an ending
[37:54] like a period at the end of a sentence
[37:56] that's what death is so death can't
[37:58] touch eternal
[37:59] the death can't touch anything
[38:01] associated with christ because it's
[38:03] eternal
[38:04] oh sure your flesh might pass away and
[38:06] will bury it
[38:08] but your spirit the one that god has
[38:11] had that lives on forever or eternity
[38:16] because your flesh had a beginning
[38:19] but when you put he says but when you
[38:20] put creeds with it the word moves out to
[38:23] itself
[38:24] it'll separate like water from oil you
[38:27] cannot mix it together
[38:28] therefore you see when the creed comes
[38:31] into a denomination
[38:32] they all go after the creed and the word
[38:34] dies out and goes on with somebody else
[38:37] and increases it more picks up the
[38:39] momentum as it goes
[38:41] go as it go from justification
[38:43] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[38:45] and on out into the grain so it picks up
[38:48] momentum
[38:49] why to a final crescendo and the age
[38:51] that we're living in it all comes
[38:52] together
[38:53] he says do you see the path god has trod
[38:55] bringing his name
[38:56] all the time right down the same way
[38:58] because he is the word
[39:01] notice it can't die the word of life
[39:04] can't
[39:04] die notice how perfect now the death
[39:07] angel was not forbidden to strike
[39:09] egypt's great intellectual people it
[39:14] wasn't forbidden to strike its sacred
[39:16] lands
[39:16] its great buildings its pharaohs on the
[39:19] priests of the land the angel was not
[39:21] forbidden to strike
[39:23] it could strike any building in any
[39:25] place anybody but it could not strike
[39:27] where the blam
[39:28] was it wasn't the type of building
[39:31] it wasn't necessarily
[39:35] who they were they had revelation
[39:37] because of who they were
[39:40] but they couldn't survive just because
[39:43] they were in israelite
[39:45] because i'm sure there were some that
[39:46] didn't put the blood on the doorposts
[39:47] and they died
[39:51] so he says um
[39:57] death cannot okay but it could not
[39:59] strike where the land was death cannot
[40:00] strike where this provided place of god
[40:01] is
[40:02] and that is in the lamb notice not even
[40:06] was the he forbidden to strike israel on
[40:09] its hebrew priests
[40:11] whoa coming in a little closer to home
[40:13] or any of their denominations
[40:15] all must be in god's chosen provided
[40:17] place or death struck
[40:19] i don't care how holy that hebrew priest
[40:20] was if his the let the blood wasn't on
[40:22] the doorpost
[40:23] it did nothing for him because there's
[40:26] no big eyes
[40:27] or little hues church
[40:30] wherever you are what you belong to
[40:32] makes me
[40:33] no different but there's one thing you
[40:36] must know you've got to be in christ or
[40:38] you're dead
[40:39] you can't live outside of him your
[40:40] church might be all right as a building
[40:42] your fellowship might be all right as
[40:44] man but when you deny the body of the
[40:46] blood the word of jesus christ you're
[40:48] dead the minute you do it
[40:50] it's god's chosen place of worship there
[40:52] is where his name is exactly
[40:54] there is where he chose to put his name
[40:56] not in the church but in the son jesus
[40:58] christ
[40:59] now i want to back back up here he says
[41:02] but when you deny
[41:03] the body the blood the word of jesus
[41:04] christ you're dead the minute
[41:06] you do it i know it sounds silly but
[41:08] there is no life in death
[41:12] churches that have stepped beyond
[41:15] the word of god and have chosen their
[41:17] own way to conduct things
[41:19] cannot reproduce the life of christ they
[41:22] might have people in their church that
[41:23] are good at
[41:24] acting but there's no changing power
[41:26] there's no
[41:28] sustaining power people that people
[41:31] it's it's it's human nature in in
[41:36] older folks to to be not happy with
[41:38] change
[41:40] so you see some churches some message
[41:41] churches there's no young people there
[41:43] people grow up and they leave
[41:45] nothing against the older folks in our
[41:49] church
[41:50] but what i'm trying to say is is you
[41:53] need the life of christ
[41:54] you need that sustaining power you need
[41:56] something to hold you
[41:58] and you can't get that when you mix your
[42:00] idea
[42:01] with god's word
[42:05] i feel like i i believe tonight you have
[42:08] your spiritual thinking cap on and
[42:10] you're catching what i'm saying without
[42:12] having to blatantly say it
[42:13] and i feel bad sometimes that it keeps
[42:15] coming back up but i thought tonight and
[42:17] perhaps it was the lord
[42:18] speaking to my heart but this is as a
[42:21] minister
[42:21] you you god lays things on your heart
[42:24] that deals with the time at hand
[42:26] you can go from church to church and and
[42:28] preachers that are called of god
[42:30] dedicated to god to the service of god
[42:32] are preaching the same thing
[42:34] because it's the season that the bride
[42:36] is in and i believe the season that we
[42:38] are in right now is the fruition of
[42:40] these fruits
[42:41] and the bible says it could deceive the
[42:42] very elect if it was possible
[42:45] so what do we do what does god do we
[42:46] don't come here and i don't try to say
[42:48] you know facts and i'll try to prove
[42:50] anything to you because that ain't going
[42:51] to do nothing
[42:52] for you what it is is god comes along
[42:54] and when the enemy raises up a flood
[42:57] raises up the flood god comes in and
[42:58] raises up the standard to meet that
[43:01] and god's word will defeat the devil
[43:03] every single time
[43:05] we're going to get to a quote here
[43:07] tonight where brother battle says that
[43:08] to accept
[43:09] god is against human nature
[43:12] it's against human nature to accept god
[43:14] so you didn't accept god
[43:16] god chose you so if you know somebody or
[43:19] you have family
[43:20] who are caught up in this movement that
[43:23] we see in the day and age that we live
[43:25] in
[43:25] don't be afraid pray for them because
[43:27] god will
[43:28] choose them god will pull them out you
[43:31] can't
[43:31] argue with them and win
[43:35] amen you can't you you get you you you
[43:38] started you read the
[43:39] you know maybe there's a message
[43:40] preached at the church here and you're
[43:42] like man i got it and you just you
[43:43] invite notes down
[43:44] and then you go to talk to them and they
[43:46] just run circles around you
[43:48] because that's not what it is you can't
[43:51] explain revelation you can't argue
[43:53] revelation
[43:54] all you know it's like the story you
[43:55] know you tell you expect people to laugh
[43:57] and they know he says how well i guess
[43:58] you had to be there
[44:00] you had to be there and you were
[44:03] you know brother man goes on this thing
[44:05] he says i was there when paul revere
[44:08] ran rode this horse across shouting the
[44:11] british are coming
[44:12] i was there when in in in when they
[44:15] raised the flag over
[44:16] iwo jima i was there he says when when
[44:19] when
[44:20] christ put his arms across upon the
[44:22] cross and i'm
[44:23] i'm going off my own now those are those
[44:25] exact words i we
[44:26] were there when he stepped out of the
[44:29] tomb when that stone
[44:30] when the earth shook and that stone
[44:32] moved without hands
[44:34] amen i was there excuse me
[44:39] why because i was in the mind of christ
[44:43] not from the beginning because eternity
[44:45] doesn't have a beginning i was
[44:47] i am in the mind of christ
[44:51] for all when he was on the cross
[44:55] i am in his mind when he came out of the
[44:58] grave
[44:59] i am what was on his mind
[45:02] anyways i am anyways i am on his mind at
[45:05] no point in time was
[45:07] was i was on his mind or going to be on
[45:11] his mind
[45:11] i was always present tense on his mind
[45:14] and that's
[45:15] who we serve we serve a present tense
[45:17] god god is not the god of yesterday
[45:19] though he is the god of yesterday he is
[45:22] the god of today it doesn't matter if
[45:24] you were
[45:24] if you're in yesterday or you're in
[45:26] tomorrow he's the god of today
[45:28] praise the lord amen so
[45:32] wow i don't even know where i am right
[45:33] now um praise the lord the light
[45:37] the true revelation of god's word pro
[45:40] puts you
[45:40] in the right place to accept the
[45:44] life of christ the life is the light
[45:47] my original title was the light of the
[45:49] gospel and then i began to see this and
[45:51] i began to
[45:52] god began to deal with me just before i
[45:53] came out that's why i had my pen and i
[45:55] was writing right here
[45:56] because it kind of brought it all
[45:57] together on this little these notes i
[45:59] have here
[45:59] but it's the masks damascus road
[46:03] right praise the lord because they're
[46:05] talking about the book of acts
[46:07] a remembrance of this is who you are
[46:08] this this this book of acts
[46:10] we could write today it is being written
[46:12] today not on an actual page what has
[46:15] been written
[46:15] in life in testimonies if you gathered
[46:18] all the testimonies of every
[46:20] and from every church around the globe
[46:22] amen you could write a book of acts
[46:24] because why it's it's why is it a book
[46:27] of acts
[46:28] you say it's just testimonies and stuff
[46:30] it's another book of acts because it's
[46:33] christ acting out through you
[46:37] the the your bible might say
[46:41] your bible here might say the acts of
[46:43] the apostles
[46:45] that's not true it's the acts of christ
[46:48] in the apostles
[46:49] there's no way they could do it
[46:53] there's no way they could do this stuff
[46:55] or fulfill the word of god in their life
[46:57] like that without a revelation of the
[46:58] light
[46:59] of christ now so the light brought the
[47:03] true revelation to the people of god in
[47:05] each age
[47:06] praise the lord acts chapter 22. we're
[47:09] gonna move into the book of acts you say
[47:11] i thought you were
[47:11] preaching about acts well we are we are
[47:14] here
[47:15] never fear acts chapter 22.
[47:28] verse 1
[47:33] men brethren and fathers hear ye my
[47:36] defense which i make now unto you
[47:38] and when they heard that he spake in the
[47:40] hebrew tongue to them they kept the more
[47:42] silence
[47:42] and he saith i am verily a man which am
[47:46] a jew born antarctis a city in
[47:48] cilicia yet brought up in this city at
[47:51] the feet of gamaliel
[47:53] and taught according to the perfect
[47:55] manner of the law of the fathers
[47:57] and was zealous towards god as ye all
[47:59] are
[48:00] this day and i persecuted this way
[48:03] unto the death you could capitalize the
[48:05] word way because what is he talking
[48:07] about
[48:07] the way of the christians
[48:11] delivering into prisons both men and
[48:13] women
[48:14] as also the high priest doth bear me
[48:16] witness and all the estate
[48:17] of the elders from who also i received
[48:20] letters unto the brethren and went to
[48:22] damascus
[48:23] to bring them which were there bound
[48:25] unto jerusalem
[48:26] for to be punished there that sets
[48:30] the stage for paul's story
[48:33] here we have paul now if we were to go
[48:35] back in the in
[48:36] acts chapter 5 and save your spot here
[48:39] in chapter 22 because we will come back
[48:41] acts chapter 5 verse 34
[48:44] you can turn if you would like to verse
[48:47] 34 says then there stood up
[48:49] one in the council a pharisee named
[48:51] gamalio so gamalio
[48:53] was paul's teacher paul's mentor in the
[48:56] gospel
[48:57] in in the message moses's message now
[49:00] there's a type
[49:01] i don't have to you you can go back and
[49:04] you can read
[49:04] the book of exodus and you can view or
[49:07] excuse me read the
[49:08] the journey of the children of israel
[49:10] out of egypt under the ministry of moses
[49:13] into the ministry of joshua crossing
[49:14] over jordan there's so
[49:16] many types through there and and so you
[49:19] have the ministry of moses and that is
[49:21] what
[49:21] paul was raised up in paul understood
[49:23] the message of moses
[49:25] paul read it the scrolls he he had a
[49:27] revelation of the scrolls if you will
[49:31] but what happened was just like the
[49:33] denominations did
[49:34] the light of the word that moses brought
[49:38] denominated in the pharisees and the
[49:40] sadducees
[49:41] so now you had a religion that had no
[49:43] life in it whatsoever
[49:45] but you have wise men still in the midst
[49:50] and when you when you read in the
[49:51] scriptures about men like gamaliel
[49:53] i like to think later on down the line
[49:55] they caught a revelation of
[49:56] of the truth either that or they died
[49:59] underneath that other
[50:00] previous anointing but he says and hey
[50:03] so gamaliel stands up and now
[50:05] they have peter and
[50:08] i think i don't know who else with him
[50:10] but as peter they arrested them for
[50:11] preaching and they're they're standing
[50:12] before the
[50:13] the um the council and uh they they're
[50:16] taking counsel to slay these disciples
[50:19] and um so gamaliel stands up and he says
[50:21] hang on everybody listen up
[50:23] everyone listens because in that culture
[50:25] a man of a certain age
[50:27] was considered wise and when he spoke
[50:29] people would would listen to what he was
[50:31] saying so here gamaliel is going to say
[50:32] that hey
[50:33] i was talking see what he has to say
[50:35] this guy is is
[50:36] has a lot of wisdom 35 and said unto
[50:40] them ye men of israel take heed to
[50:42] yourselves what she intend to do as
[50:44] touching these men
[50:45] for before these days rose up theodos
[50:48] boasting himself to be somebody to whom
[50:51] a hundred of
[50:52] hundred of men about 400
[50:55] excuse me to whom a number of men about
[50:58] 400 joined themselves
[51:02] who was slain and all as many as obeyed
[51:04] him were scattered and brought to naught
[51:07] after this man rose up judas of galilee
[51:09] in the days of the taxing and drew away
[51:11] much people after him
[51:13] he also perished and all even as many as
[51:16] obeyed him were dispersed
[51:17] now i say unto you refrain from these
[51:20] men and let them alone
[51:22] for if this council or this work be of
[51:24] men it will come to not
[51:26] but if it be of god you cannot overthrow
[51:28] it lest happily
[51:30] be found even to fight against god
[51:39] so this is the viewpoint this is the
[51:41] understanding that gamaliel has
[51:44] of these these jews who are preaching
[51:48] about jesus and him resurrected
[51:51] and um in in um i have written down acts
[51:55] chapter 8 verse 1
[51:57] and saul was consenting unto his death
[51:59] considering
[52:00] unto the death of stephen
[52:03] um and at that time there was a great
[52:05] persecution against the church which was
[52:07] at jerusalem
[52:08] and they were all scattered abroad
[52:10] throughout the regions of judea and
[52:12] samaria except the apostles
[52:14] and devout men carried stephen to his
[52:16] burial and made great
[52:17] lamentation over him as for saul he made
[52:20] havoc of the church entering into every
[52:22] house and hailing men and women
[52:24] committing women committed them to
[52:27] prison
[52:28] therefore they that were scattered
[52:30] abroad went everywhere preaching the
[52:32] word
[52:34] so that's what happens when the bride
[52:36] comes underneath the persecution
[52:38] they disperse but all it did was cause a
[52:40] greater spread of the gospel of christ
[52:42] so here we have uh we have gamalium he
[52:45] says look
[52:46] don't fight against these men in other
[52:47] words don't take them prisoner don't put
[52:48] them in prison don't hurt them
[52:50] don't harm them don't do anything to
[52:51] them because if they're of god
[52:53] you'll be found fighting against god if
[52:55] they're not of god don't worry about it
[52:57] it's going to fall apart
[52:58] because it's a man idea so he had an
[53:00] understanding that what is of
[53:02] god bears life but what is not of god
[53:05] has no life
[53:06] in it and will come to death so this is
[53:08] gamaliel who paul was raised up through
[53:11] up underneath from the time he was a
[53:13] young boy
[53:14] so there came at some point in time in
[53:17] between this
[53:18] that around this time where gamaliel
[53:20] stands up and and he got the apostles
[53:22] preaching in the streets and you have
[53:24] stephen and being stoned and now you see
[53:26] paul
[53:27] in the mix consenting to the death of
[53:29] stephen there had to be a confrontation
[53:31] between him and gamalio
[53:33] the words of wisdom from gamaliel saying
[53:35] hey listen paul
[53:36] listen you need it you need to leave
[53:38] these people alone
[53:40] excuse me don't mess with it paul this
[53:43] is a what do you know gamaliel i know
[53:45] the scripture's just good as you do i've
[53:47] read it
[53:47] you've raised me up you've taught it
[53:48] well guess what this is a new time
[53:51] this is a new age you're stuck in the
[53:52] old thing you're old you don't
[53:54] understand what's going on
[53:55] you you don't you don't get it uh we can
[53:58] we can't let these we can't stand by and
[54:00] get these
[54:00] for the passion of youth we can't stand
[54:02] by and let these people
[54:03] ruin the temple you want them to take
[54:05] the temple from you the temple is
[54:06] everything that we believe in
[54:08] paul paul no no you don't understand you
[54:10] got to leave this sloan it could be of
[54:12] god
[54:12] and paul said no i storms out i am not
[54:15] going to listen to any more you have to
[54:16] say slams the door
[54:19] here you have paul he perhaps
[54:23] within him is an expression of of anger
[54:26] right he he he's upset he's angry at
[54:30] these
[54:30] christians why because there was a
[54:32] spirit
[54:33] contrary to him to his and he was he had
[54:36] to fight against it he was trying to
[54:38] silence the voice
[54:40] within him there was a voice in him
[54:43] saying paul these people have something
[54:45] you don't have
[54:46] how do they how do they stand there and
[54:48] face you and you put
[54:50] chains on them and you sit in the prison
[54:54] and maybe they're killed how do they
[54:55] stand and face that paul
[54:57] yet yet yet you're you you know you oh
[54:59] and he's got to silence the voice
[55:02] that's what they're trying to do in the
[55:03] time that we live in they're trying to
[55:05] silence the voice
[55:05] because what they heard it and they
[55:08] can't get away from it
[55:10] so it angers him these people who who do
[55:12] they think they are
[55:13] he's upset he's he he he's um
[55:17] loud and he and he's and he's and he's
[55:19] just
[55:21] you know plotting and and to to make
[55:23] these people's life miserable
[55:27] all the while though thinking he's
[55:29] fighting on the right side
[55:31] you have to understand that he thought
[55:33] he was doing the right thing
[55:35] he was doing it all in the name of the
[55:37] message
[55:39] moses moses message he was doing it all
[55:41] and he had
[55:42] he had instructions from
[55:46] the preachers and the pastors the
[55:48] pharisees the priests
[55:50] he had instructions from the high priest
[55:53] right there was still
[55:54] um there was an organization of man one
[55:58] man
[55:58] is the top of the food chain he had
[56:01] instructions from him
[56:03] and he he he he's going out and he's
[56:07] taking
[56:07] what did these people do to him they
[56:09] didn't do anything to him
[56:11] they have done nothing to him they have
[56:12] never even said you know tried to
[56:15] try to to take and go and pillage the
[56:17] temple or anything
[56:19] they left him alone you say why can't
[56:22] they just
[56:22] leave us alone
[56:26] because it's the life of christ in you
[56:28] angers them
[56:30] it angers them so here's paul thinking
[56:32] he's doing the right
[56:33] thing fighting on the side
[56:36] of god or so he thinks
[56:42] and so he gets papers he's all right
[56:44] there
[56:45] they're going to run excuse me that's
[56:49] fine
[56:50] i'll get permission to run after them
[56:55] and i'm going to deal with them i'm
[56:57] going to stop this
[57:03] gamalio okay paul
[57:06] you're going to do this you know
[57:10] what can i do i pray that god
[57:14] helps you this isn't the way
[57:17] we're to handle situations like this
[57:19] paul
[57:20] saul excuse me
[57:24] perhaps there was a a scenario where
[57:26] where uh
[57:28] saul speaking to gamaliel
[57:31] hey i i'm i got these you know because
[57:34] he's still looking for his approval he's
[57:36] his mentor he wants to see that approval
[57:38] in gamaliel so
[57:39] he tells gamalia look i i i have
[57:42] i've got them i i i've put almost every
[57:44] single one in jerusalem in prison
[57:46] and now i'm going to damascus and
[57:49] gamaliel
[57:50] in wisdom and i believe maybe anointed
[57:52] of god looks at paul
[57:53] saul in the eyes and says then you'll be
[57:56] happy
[58:00] so here's here is saul and he's going to
[58:02] damascus
[58:04] and i'm going to take the liberty to
[58:06] paint this picture he's got these words
[58:09] going over in his head
[58:11] and he's thinking why am i not happy
[58:16] i'm doing the work of god i'm dealing
[58:18] with these men
[58:21] with these women and chill with these
[58:22] men and women why am i not happy
[58:24] oh i get to damascus i'll i'll get all
[58:27] of them there
[58:28] and then i'll be happy and the voice
[58:30] doesn't says in in his heart but they're
[58:32] gone other places and you know it amen
[58:35] how are you going to go
[58:37] to the next town in the next town
[58:40] in the next town where does revenge end
[58:43] paul
[58:46] where does it end i'll tell you where it
[58:49] ends it ends in death is what it does
[58:52] and here's paul in his turmoil see what
[58:55] god
[58:55] does now you you take you take stories
[58:58] and and and events from the scriptures
[58:59] that you read them
[59:01] and if we're not careful we forget to
[59:02] put heart into them
[59:04] it's just it's just it's just an event
[59:07] but you got to see
[59:08] god doesn't just god didn't just come
[59:10] out of the blue
[59:12] to paul paul had to be in the right
[59:14] frame of mind
[59:15] paul had to be in the right spirit the
[59:18] bible says god loveth a broken and a
[59:20] contrite spirit
[59:21] god doesn't come to somebody when
[59:23] they're high on life
[59:26] he breaks them down to a place where all
[59:29] they can do is
[59:29] look up he he he prepares the soil
[59:34] for the receiving of the seed if the
[59:36] ground is hard
[59:38] you're nothing you can do the plow has
[59:40] got to come through and break it up
[59:43] god came through at your life and your
[59:45] conversion and he broke up your life
[59:48] you got to a place where you you there
[59:50] was nothing you could do
[59:51] and you and right and god came down on
[59:55] the scene now here's paul now this is
[59:57] this is i it's reading between the lines
[1:00:01] paul was in a broken position in his
[1:00:04] heart
[1:00:05] now he was tough on the outside and he
[1:00:06] had his soldiers with him
[1:00:08] he was a man capturing innocent women
[1:00:13] funny what the world calls a man
[1:00:18] and here he is on the road thinking why
[1:00:20] am i not happy
[1:00:21] well what do these people have they
[1:00:24] believe in this
[1:00:24] this jesus
[1:00:28] supposed to raise from the dead
[1:00:33] how does that even make sense he was a
[1:00:35] bastard child
[1:00:37] that's what he's you know perhaps he's
[1:00:39] thinking this stuff on there you know
[1:00:41] you're on a long road
[1:00:42] your mind just he didn't have the cd
[1:00:44] player
[1:00:45] turn on some tunes you know horses
[1:00:48] didn't come with those back then
[1:00:50] and so and so he he he's riding along
[1:00:52] and he's thinking over his life and he's
[1:00:54] thinking over everything
[1:00:56] that he has gone through and and the
[1:00:58] words of gamaliel coming to his mind
[1:01:01] and the words because he knew
[1:01:04] i'm sorry excuse me he knew the scrolls
[1:01:11] he knew what isaiah said he knew this
[1:01:14] stuff
[1:01:14] and so he's perhaps he's thinking over
[1:01:17] these things
[1:01:18] on damascus road
[1:01:23] and perhaps when he was at his lowest
[1:01:28] verse six and it came to pass that as i
[1:01:30] made my journey
[1:01:31] and it was come nigh unto damascus about
[1:01:34] noon
[1:01:35] suddenly they're shown from heaven a
[1:01:37] great light round about me
[1:01:38] and i fell unto the ground and heard a
[1:01:40] voice saying unto me saul saul
[1:01:42] why persecutest thou me
[1:01:46] he say oh you can't be you can't say
[1:01:50] that that that
[1:01:51] that your your jesus christ to this
[1:01:54] world
[1:01:56] did he persecute jesus the
[1:01:59] the man that was no the men and women
[1:02:03] who believed on him
[1:02:04] and he's here here jesus says wiper to
[1:02:07] execute his thou
[1:02:08] me and i answered who art thou
[1:02:12] lord capital l he knew
[1:02:15] [Laughter]
[1:02:18] he knew in his heart lord
[1:02:22] jehovah god the great creator
[1:02:25] who art thou lord he probably could have
[1:02:28] answered it
[1:02:29] but he asks and i am
[1:02:33] and he said unto me i am jesus of
[1:02:36] nazareth
[1:02:37] whom now persecute us right there
[1:02:40] for the sake of paul's hurting soul
[1:02:43] hurting heart god says he says i
[1:02:46] identify
[1:02:47] paul saul identifies him as lord
[1:02:50] and then he says i am jesus and he tied
[1:02:53] the two together
[1:02:55] and now saul realizes that that jesus of
[1:02:58] nazareth
[1:02:59] is the same one he is professing
[1:03:03] to be serving and now he's been found
[1:03:06] fighting against god and the words of
[1:03:08] gamalia come back to his mind
[1:03:10] don't fight against unless you be
[1:03:12] finding yourself fighting against
[1:03:14] god and paul saul knew there that he had
[1:03:17] lost the battle
[1:03:19] and they that were with me saw indeed
[1:03:21] the light and were afraid but they heard
[1:03:23] not the voice of him that spake to me
[1:03:26] and i said what shall i do lord and the
[1:03:28] lord said unto me arise and go into
[1:03:30] damascus
[1:03:31] and there it shall be told thee of all
[1:03:33] things which are appointed
[1:03:34] for thee to do and when i could not see
[1:03:37] for the glory of the light being led by
[1:03:39] the hand of them that were with me
[1:03:40] i came into damascus and one ananias a
[1:03:44] devout man according to the law
[1:03:46] when you see the light it blinds you to
[1:03:50] everything else the world has to offer
[1:03:53] and then god gives you new eyes to see
[1:03:57] and i came into damascus and one ananias
[1:03:59] a devout man according to the law having
[1:04:01] a good
[1:04:01] report of all the jews which dwelt there
[1:04:04] came unto me and stood and said unto me
[1:04:06] brother saul
[1:04:07] received thy sight and the same hour i
[1:04:09] looked up upon him
[1:04:11] and he said the god of our fathers hath
[1:04:14] chosen thee that thou should know his
[1:04:16] will and see
[1:04:17] that just one here is
[1:04:20] paul now god has so many names he's the
[1:04:24] savior he's the healer
[1:04:25] healer he's jehovah he's the lord jesus
[1:04:28] christ
[1:04:30] he has all these names
[1:04:33] but what is the one that ananias
[1:04:35] underneath the anointing of the holy
[1:04:37] spirit
[1:04:37] chooses to use he calls him the just
[1:04:40] one why because paul is sitting there in
[1:04:43] his blindness
[1:04:44] waiting for ananias to come realizing he
[1:04:47] has been
[1:04:47] hurting and persecuting the very people
[1:04:50] of god
[1:04:52] you think that wouldn't affect you you
[1:04:55] remember
[1:04:56] you're remembering those those precious
[1:04:58] saintly women you slapped in the face
[1:05:02] you remember those those those godly men
[1:05:05] who stood there who were broadly enough
[1:05:07] to take you and
[1:05:08] choke you out and they stood there as
[1:05:09] you put the cuffs on them
[1:05:11] to drag them off to prison you're
[1:05:13] looking into the eyes of jesus christ in
[1:05:15] your mind
[1:05:16] realizing what you've done ananias comes
[1:05:19] the prophet
[1:05:20] and anoints him and he his eyes are
[1:05:24] open and he says he calls christ to
[1:05:27] paul the just one in other words
[1:05:30] god is a fair judge
[1:05:34] god is a judge yes but god has
[1:05:37] grace and he is just in his judgment
[1:05:43] stephen cried out as he was dying laying
[1:05:46] out this charge
[1:05:47] to their hands that was for paul
[1:05:50] that was for the sake of paul otherwise
[1:05:51] paul would have had stephen's blood on
[1:05:53] his hands
[1:05:57] he says and see that just one and should
[1:05:58] has hear the voice of his mouth
[1:06:01] for thou shalt be his witness unto all
[1:06:04] men of what thou has seen and heard
[1:06:06] and now why terrorists thou arise and be
[1:06:08] baptized and wash away thy sins
[1:06:11] calling on the name of the lord
[1:06:16] praise the lord
[1:06:21] amen saul converting to paul
[1:06:25] he saw the light on damascus
[1:06:28] road i'm sorry i should have picked a
[1:06:30] different word he saw the light on the
[1:06:32] road to the masses we're going to say
[1:06:33] that
[1:06:34] he saw the light and he heard the voice
[1:06:40] there's two scriptures in the bible and
[1:06:42] but brother brown has even asked the
[1:06:43] question you know why is it saying one
[1:06:45] place
[1:06:45] they saw the light and heard no voice in
[1:06:47] a place that says they heard a voice and
[1:06:48] saw no man
[1:06:49] and he said i don't know the answer to
[1:06:51] that question and i'm not going to try
[1:06:53] to explain it
[1:06:53] until god reveals it to me that was in
[1:06:56] 64. so
[1:06:59] either way you have to see the light
[1:07:03] and hear the voice you can't do one
[1:07:06] without the other because they saw
[1:07:08] they saw the the pharisees saw
[1:07:12] jesus who was the light
[1:07:15] they didn't catch anything they heard
[1:07:17] him speak
[1:07:18] but they didn't hear the voice
[1:07:22] you have these men with paul maybe some
[1:07:25] saw the light maybe some didn't
[1:07:27] some heard the voice some didn't
[1:07:30] but you don't hear about their
[1:07:32] conversion
[1:07:33] you have to see the light and hear
[1:07:36] the voice and you have to hear the voice
[1:07:40] and see the light you can hear the voice
[1:07:42] if if the voice of
[1:07:44] brother branham who is the voice for
[1:07:47] the voice capital v
[1:07:50] saved you there would be no reason for
[1:07:53] the bible or the holy spirit
[1:07:55] but that's not what it is it's the voice
[1:07:57] within the voice
[1:08:00] it's it's it's the truth it's the light
[1:08:04] the life of christ it's christ to us
[1:08:07] it and it's the same thing as it was
[1:08:10] then
[1:08:11] one um there was there was the the the
[1:08:14] jews
[1:08:15] fighting against the jews you had the
[1:08:17] jews of the pharisees and the sadducees
[1:08:19] and you had the christian jews
[1:08:21] at that point they're all jews they're
[1:08:23] all in the same
[1:08:25] church basically if you will yet you
[1:08:28] have saul
[1:08:29] of paul who was fighting against his own
[1:08:32] brethren
[1:08:33] same religion different revelation
[1:08:36] one was true one was false
[1:08:41] amen it's j it's the false vine versus
[1:08:44] the true vine it's the same thing it's a
[1:08:46] twins going on down it's all the way
[1:08:48] through
[1:08:48] but um we're talking about the light and
[1:08:51] the life that christ
[1:08:53] gives to you when you hear and have
[1:08:55] revelation
[1:08:56] and that causes you to see the light
[1:09:00] um saul knew he was right
[1:09:04] he had the quotes for it
[1:09:07] a service for them was the priest
[1:09:09] reading the scrolls of the words of
[1:09:10] moses
[1:09:11] it's the same spirit in every age
[1:09:15] praise the lord finding myself in my
[1:09:17] notes because i got ahead of it of them
[1:09:24] many are hearing the message but do not
[1:09:26] see the light
[1:09:28] you've got to hear the message and see
[1:09:30] the light of christ within it that's
[1:09:32] revelation
[1:09:33] john saw the light and heard the voice
[1:09:36] when he baptized jesus
[1:09:39] um in acts chapter 19
[1:09:42] verse one through six paul goes to
[1:09:46] ephesus
[1:09:48] and it says and he says the bible says
[1:09:49] here and it came to pass that while
[1:09:51] apollos was at corinth paul having
[1:09:52] passed through the upper coasts came to
[1:09:54] ephesus and finding certain disciples he
[1:09:57] said unto them
[1:09:59] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:10:01] you believed and they said unto him
[1:10:04] we have excuse me
[1:10:08] we have not so much as heard whether
[1:10:09] there be any holy ghost and he said unto
[1:10:11] them unto what then were ye baptized
[1:10:13] and they said unto john's baptism then
[1:10:16] said paul john barely baptized with the
[1:10:18] baptism of repentance
[1:10:19] saying unto the people that they should
[1:10:21] believe on him which should come after
[1:10:23] him
[1:10:24] that is on christ jesus when they heard
[1:10:26] this they were baptized in the name of
[1:10:28] the lord jesus and when paul had laid
[1:10:29] his hands
[1:10:30] upon them the holy ghost came on them
[1:10:32] and they spake with tongues
[1:10:33] and prophesied matthew 5 14 says ye are
[1:10:37] the light of the world a city that is
[1:10:39] set on a hill
[1:10:40] cannot be hid these ephesus believers
[1:10:42] were apostles of john's message
[1:10:45] they only had half of the ingredients
[1:10:48] john was the forerunner for christ these
[1:10:51] disciples at ephesus
[1:10:53] could have turned paul down i said no
[1:10:57] and wait this is what john said but then
[1:11:00] he says
[1:11:01] john came to bring you christ
[1:11:04] to forerun and call out your attention
[1:11:07] to christ
[1:11:08] to what the light paul had to go down
[1:11:11] the road
[1:11:12] to damascus for god to bring him to the
[1:11:15] light
[1:11:16] he knew the scrolls he knew what it was
[1:11:18] said but
[1:11:19] god had to bring him to the light you
[1:11:21] had to hear the light
[1:11:23] see the light and hear the voice and
[1:11:25] paul went to
[1:11:26] out in the arabian desert for three and
[1:11:28] a half years what was he doing he took
[1:11:29] the scrolls with him
[1:11:31] but now with the revelation he went back
[1:11:33] through them
[1:11:34] and he found christ in every last line
[1:11:38] the same is for you when you see christ
[1:11:40] in the message
[1:11:41] you've heard the voice but when you see
[1:11:43] the light
[1:11:45] you can't you can't turn back you're
[1:11:47] blinded to the rest of what the world
[1:11:49] has to offer
[1:11:50] now you just see christ you go back
[1:11:53] through it you go back through the voice
[1:11:55] through the message you read and
[1:11:56] all you see is christ all the way
[1:11:58] through and
[1:12:00] you can't contradict any scripture in
[1:12:02] the bible
[1:12:04] once you've seen the light and heard the
[1:12:06] voice once you've seen the light
[1:12:08] of truth now you are a light
[1:12:11] to this generation
[1:12:14] it takes the whole world to bring about
[1:12:17] christ in your life
[1:12:19] your damascus road brought you
[1:12:22] to christ god puts you in the right
[1:12:26] position
[1:12:26] he says you know what this is my child
[1:12:29] so i'm going to give them
[1:12:30] what they need to catch a revelation of
[1:12:33] the word
[1:12:34] but guess what sometimes amen this this
[1:12:36] could go for
[1:12:37] for for the young people raised in the
[1:12:39] message you heard the voice
[1:12:41] but you need to come into contact with
[1:12:43] the light
[1:12:45] you need to come into contact with the
[1:12:47] light jesus christ
[1:12:50] that's the whole point that's what the
[1:12:52] voice is pointing you to
[1:12:54] is to jesus christ it's not about
[1:12:57] the messenger it's about the message
[1:13:00] that come
[1:13:01] straight from christ
[1:13:04] praise the lord now it took a light
[1:13:08] bearer paul to bring them the whole
[1:13:11] truth
[1:13:12] these believers in ephesus then they
[1:13:15] received christ because they had the
[1:13:17] whole
[1:13:17] truth it's either all word or none at
[1:13:20] all
[1:13:22] when you mix it there's no word the
[1:13:24] pharisees
[1:13:25] praise the lord
[1:13:29] it takes seeing the light to hear the
[1:13:32] voice within the voice i think i said
[1:13:33] that already it takes hearing the voice
[1:13:35] to understand
[1:13:36] the light john 14 6 says jesus saith
[1:13:39] unto him i am the way the truth and the
[1:13:41] life
[1:13:42] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:13:46] here's that quote for the brand of 1956
[1:13:48] he says yes sir it's a work of god you
[1:13:51] never
[1:13:51] chose god and never did seek god god
[1:13:54] seeks
[1:13:55] you it's against human nature
[1:13:58] you weren't seeking the lord on your
[1:14:00] road to damascus
[1:14:02] paul wasn't seeking the lord on the road
[1:14:04] to damascus he was seeking other jews to
[1:14:06] take and capture
[1:14:08] this is the book of acts it was written
[1:14:10] again this is
[1:14:11] you have a testimony similar to paul's
[1:14:14] you came into contact with the light
[1:14:16] sometimes we have to be reminded of
[1:14:18] where we came from
[1:14:20] reminded of of of what we what we went
[1:14:23] through
[1:14:24] we get so bogged down with life
[1:14:26] sometimes and
[1:14:27] and and and and with the things of the
[1:14:29] world and we get so bogged down with
[1:14:31] what people have to say about what we
[1:14:33] believe
[1:14:34] that we forget about the light that's
[1:14:38] the whole
[1:14:39] thing that's the whole shebang as i say
[1:14:42] it's all all about christ and and
[1:14:46] the light that he brings to your life
[1:14:48] then you see clearly now
[1:14:51] what he who he is in the word which
[1:14:54] then tells you who you are
[1:14:59] praise the lord amen
[1:15:04] sister amy and sean you all want to come
[1:15:06] up here
[1:15:08] so
[1:15:14] following after jesus christ was
[1:15:16] contrary to
[1:15:17] everything paul knew and believed
[1:15:22] but when you come into contact with the
[1:15:24] light
[1:15:25] the light of the gospel you're able to
[1:15:29] go against your human nature
[1:15:31] which wants to turn down god because
[1:15:37] christ gives you a revelation
[1:15:40] of what is reality that's the big
[1:15:43] question these days what's reality
[1:15:45] we have virtual reality what is reality
[1:15:48] what is truth
[1:15:49] you know is this a good source of truth
[1:15:51] you know let's fact check this truth
[1:15:53] with the
[1:15:54] with this and that and the other and if
[1:15:56] you're not careful you get into this
[1:15:57] place where
[1:15:58] where um lord help me tie this up
[1:16:00] tonight and forgive me if
[1:16:02] if if i'm not making sense i i i
[1:16:04] apologize i
[1:16:06] pray that god will tie this down
[1:16:07] together
[1:16:10] if if you're not careful you get caught
[1:16:13] up
[1:16:14] in in in the words on the page
[1:16:18] and and you want to try to you want to
[1:16:20] try to defend
[1:16:22] it you want to try to use it to prove
[1:16:25] your point
[1:16:26] you want to try to use it to convince
[1:16:28] somebody of something
[1:16:32] but since you like paul
[1:16:36] met the light on the road to damascus
[1:16:39] you are a light bearer
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:43] our prayer should be lord don't help me
[1:16:46] learn the message
[1:16:50] help me to become the message
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:54] don't don't compile quotes together in a
[1:16:57] notebook
[1:16:59] to take and argue your point it won't
[1:17:02] work
[1:17:04] instead say god i have nothing
[1:17:07] to hold against this
[1:17:11] help me shed the light
[1:17:14] of christ i'm trusting that tonight that
[1:17:18] god knows your heart and god knows what
[1:17:21] you're dealing with
[1:17:22] i don't know what you're dealing with
[1:17:24] but god knows the very
[1:17:26] inner heart and i know that that i do
[1:17:28] know that this is a big thing right now
[1:17:31] and and and so i'm trusting
[1:17:34] sometimes as a preacher you don't know
[1:17:36] you think how can that how can that
[1:17:37] apply to the congregation because you
[1:17:39] think you know people but you don't
[1:17:42] but jesus christ knows your heart
[1:17:47] and tonight what he's telling you what
[1:17:49] he's telling me is stop getting
[1:17:51] caught up in the argument of whether
[1:17:54] this is right or that is right
[1:17:57] and focus on the light because
[1:18:00] that's what it's all about give out the
[1:18:03] light you have been given the greatest
[1:18:05] gift on this earth you have been
[1:18:08] given a revelation of christ now
[1:18:12] if you could see it in the spiritual
[1:18:13] world go ahead close your eyes for a
[1:18:15] second and try to imagine this with me
[1:18:17] you could look into the spiritual world
[1:18:20] all you see is
[1:18:21] is it's just it's darkness around us
[1:18:25] it's darkness now in this darkness
[1:18:27] there's pits there's trees
[1:18:28] there's there's trip falls there's traps
[1:18:32] everywhere you look when you turn
[1:18:35] there's light and you can see it because
[1:18:38] you're a light bearer
[1:18:40] now what makes people scared of you
[1:18:42] sometimes what makes people upset with
[1:18:44] you sometimes
[1:18:45] is when you shine that light on them
[1:18:48] they don't like it
[1:18:51] if it you can open your eyes if you want
[1:18:53] if if
[1:18:54] if you want if you want to do the best
[1:18:57] thing that you can do
[1:18:59] is shine your light into their
[1:19:02] dark world and pray to god
[1:19:06] that they comprehend it pray to god that
[1:19:09] that you can be a
[1:19:11] a moment of truth for them
[1:19:15] that doesn't mean you have to pull your
[1:19:16] bible out you don't have to pull out the
[1:19:18] quotes
[1:19:20] now there's there's praise the lord
[1:19:25] there's people who don't realize
[1:19:29] god is faithful and god has grace and
[1:19:31] they will come to that place
[1:19:33] where they catch revelation but there's
[1:19:34] people who are following a certain
[1:19:36] idea of the message who don't realize
[1:19:38] the error of their ways
[1:19:40] if you come at them with quotes you're
[1:19:42] no different than the people
[1:19:44] who are preaching to them in their
[1:19:46] church
[1:19:48] but if you come after him with the love
[1:19:50] of christ
[1:19:52] which is the light of christ true
[1:19:55] love not some perverted
[1:19:59] thing but the man said compassion with
[1:20:01] jesus braiding the whip
[1:20:02] and beating the money changers out of
[1:20:04] the temple don't break a whip and go
[1:20:06] beat them that's not what i'm saying
[1:20:09] stand in confidence they might call it
[1:20:11] arrogance
[1:20:12] but standing confidence on the truth and
[1:20:15] show them the life of christ i was in
[1:20:19] conversation with someone the other day
[1:20:20] we were talking about somebody
[1:20:22] who is very much against the message
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:25] and i said you know they they told me
[1:20:28] and my wife
[1:20:29] they appreciated that we show them love
[1:20:34] still
[1:20:35] they don't they don't now now
[1:20:39] i have to be careful how to say this
[1:20:41] because you don't want to
[1:20:45] you don't want it to be like oh we thank
[1:20:46] you for accepting us in that
[1:20:48] your life doesn't convict them you want
[1:20:50] that to always be the case
[1:20:52] [Music]
[1:20:55] they know i don't agree with them and
[1:20:57] we've had
[1:20:58] words kind words but
[1:21:01] i spoke straight i spoke the truth
[1:21:05] but yet they see in their the desire we
[1:21:08] have to just
[1:21:09] show them the love of christ now let me
[1:21:12] ask you a question
[1:21:13] in their time of need are they going to
[1:21:15] go to the person who's ours be
[1:21:16] always arguing with them or they're
[1:21:19] going to go to the person who's shown
[1:21:20] them
[1:21:21] christ there's going to come a day when
[1:21:25] people are going to start reaching out
[1:21:26] to you because they know
[1:21:28] you have the truth amen
[1:21:32] will you be the one to be their light
[1:21:35] bearer
[1:21:38] there's a song that says you know i may
[1:21:41] have conversation with you and talk with
[1:21:43] you but when we go away
[1:21:46] will you love jesus more or did i get in
[1:21:50] the way
[1:21:52] when you meet somebody you witness
[1:21:53] somebody you talk to somebody when you
[1:21:55] go
[1:21:56] away will they know jesus more were they
[1:21:59] where they have have have been
[1:22:01] introduced to christ or will they just
[1:22:03] see
[1:22:03] you amen we pray that that that god
[1:22:07] will use us to be the light bearers
[1:22:10] the masses road god came on your road to
[1:22:13] damascus
[1:22:15] and shone gave you the light and gave
[1:22:17] you revelation
[1:22:18] and then he sent you to ephesus to be a
[1:22:22] light bearer of the truth
[1:22:24] praise the lord let's bow our heads
[1:22:25] tonight lord jesus thank you for your
[1:22:28] word lord
[1:22:31] lord that's my heart's desire tonight is
[1:22:33] to be a light bearer
[1:22:38] before you can be a light bearer you've
[1:22:41] got to go down damascus road
[1:22:45] but lord once we go through that
[1:22:49] come out the other side then we can
[1:22:51] begin to spread the truth
[1:22:54] to the world around us and oh lord
[1:22:57] what a time truth is needed
[1:23:02] there's people who have come to come to
[1:23:04] the acceptance
[1:23:05] that there's just nothing true about
[1:23:07] anything it's everybody's opinion that's
[1:23:09] the
[1:23:10] mainstream thought everyone just has an
[1:23:12] opinion there's no truth
[1:23:16] the lord that's not the case and father
[1:23:19] we don't
[1:23:20] want to tote around our
[1:23:23] books and just try to argue a point
[1:23:28] at that point we'd be no different than
[1:23:32] jehovah's witness or mormons but father
[1:23:35] we
[1:23:35] want to spread the life of christ
[1:23:39] whether that be in a uh
[1:23:42] buying a meal or buying a cup of coffee
[1:23:46] or
[1:23:46] or just giving a word of encouragement
[1:23:48] to somebody we don't know or
[1:23:49] or when or when someone would come and
[1:23:51] they want to argue with us about the
[1:23:53] prophet
[1:23:54] we just have a
[1:23:58] we just have an attentiveness to the
[1:24:00] still small voice and instead of saying
[1:24:02] what we really want to say
[1:24:04] we conduct and say what you would want
[1:24:06] us to say father that's
[1:24:08] the direction we are going as the bride
[1:24:10] of christ because we
[1:24:12] are becoming more and more like you lord
[1:24:15] jesus
[1:24:16] i don't know lord i don't know people's
[1:24:18] hearts i don't know what people are
[1:24:19] going through father
[1:24:21] but i believe this is what you laid on
[1:24:23] my heart
[1:24:24] lord forgive me for the times i got in
[1:24:27] the way tonight
[1:24:29] i never ever want to mix my ideas or my
[1:24:31] opinions with your word
