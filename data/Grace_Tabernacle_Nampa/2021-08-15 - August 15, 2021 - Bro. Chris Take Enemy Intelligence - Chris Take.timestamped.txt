[18:17] our visitors too bless you
[18:20] amen
[18:22] why don't we turn to isaiah chapter 59.
[18:29] uh
[18:52] isaiah chapter 59 and we're going to
[18:55] read verse 19
[18:57] familiar portion of scripture
[19:01] but that does not take from its
[19:02] importance
[19:04] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[19:07] from the west and his glory from the
[19:09] rising of the sun
[19:11] when the enemy shall come in like a
[19:12] flood the spirit of the lord shall lift
[19:14] up a standard against him amen let's
[19:17] power heads
[19:20] gracious heavenly father lord jesus we
[19:22] have one desire this morning and that's
[19:24] that you would speak to our hearts lord
[19:25] jesus
[19:26] father we're so thankful lord to know
[19:28] you we're so thankful that your word has
[19:31] given us the power that we need lord
[19:33] jesus to stand upon
[19:35] father and to stand up and take the
[19:37] victory lord and father when the enemy
[19:39] would come in like a flood lord jesus
[19:40] you raise up a standard
[19:43] father we just thank you for that this
[19:45] morning we ask that you would speak to
[19:47] our hearts lord may i not get in the way
[19:49] father but may lord jesus just yield my
[19:52] vessel to your hand that you would speak
[19:54] to us this morning father we pray that
[19:56] you would touch the hearts of your
[19:58] people lord father that there would be a
[20:00] greater encouraging lord and inspiration
[20:02] in our hearts this morning we ask we
[20:05] love you lord and thank you in jesus
[20:06] name we pray
[20:07] amen you may be seated this morning
[20:12] so my title this morning is enemy
[20:14] intelligence
[20:18] and uh
[20:19] take the subject when the giant speaks
[20:21] and christ answers back
[20:25] so we just read here in uh isaiah 59 19
[20:29] that the giant spoke but christ answered
[20:32] back he raised up a standard and that
[20:34] standard was already set in place in
[20:36] preparation for
[20:38] the flood increasing amen that it wasn't
[20:41] the flood increasing and then our lord
[20:44] scrambling to get the standard prepared
[20:46] it was already up and waiting for that
[20:49] flood from the enemy
[20:51] and um
[20:52] you know when the military the military
[20:54] will go and they'll seek out
[20:56] intelligence uh on the enemy to give
[20:59] themselves the upper hand they have
[21:00] spies and a lot of different things that
[21:02] they do and there's many great stories
[21:05] you can read of of
[21:07] men and women men and
[21:09] soldiers in the army who have done great
[21:11] heroic things to receive that
[21:12] intelligence but it's that intelligence
[21:15] that they received of the enemy that
[21:17] gives them the upper hand and so this
[21:20] morning we're going to let the enemy
[21:21] testify for us today
[21:24] so
[21:24] joshua chapter two
[21:27] we'll turn over there if you will with
[21:29] me
[21:32] joshua chapter two
[21:40] verse one
[21:51] and joshua the son of nun sent out of
[21:53] shedding two men to spy secretly saying
[21:55] go view the land even jericho and they
[21:58] went and came into an harlot's house
[22:00] named rahab and lodged there and it was
[22:03] told the king of jericho saying behold
[22:05] there came men in hither tonight of the
[22:07] children of israel to search out the
[22:09] country and the king of jericho sent
[22:11] unto rahab saying bring forth the men
[22:14] that are come to thee which are entered
[22:16] into thine house for they become to
[22:18] search out all the country and the women
[22:21] took the two men and hid them and said
[22:23] thus there came men unto me but i wish
[22:26] not whence they were and it came to pass
[22:28] about the time of the shedding of the
[22:29] gate
[22:30] when it was dark that the men went out
[22:33] whether the men
[22:34] went i woke not perhap pursue after them
[22:38] quickly for ye shall overtake them but
[22:40] she had brought them up to the roof of
[22:42] the house and hid them with the stalks
[22:44] of flax which she had laid in order upon
[22:47] the roof and the men pursued after them
[22:49] the way to jordan unto the forge and as
[22:52] soon as they were they which pursued
[22:54] after them were gone out they shut the
[22:56] gate and before they were laid down she
[22:59] came up under them upon the roof and
[23:00] said under the men
[23:04] so they're about to receive some enemy
[23:06] intelligence she says unto the men i
[23:08] know that the lord hath given you the
[23:10] land and that your terror has fallen
[23:11] upon us and that all the inhabitants of
[23:13] the land faint because of you
[23:16] for we have heard how the lord dried up
[23:18] the water of the red sea for you when
[23:21] you came out of egypt see the enemy
[23:23] takes notes of your testimony
[23:25] as the bible says you
[23:27] we shall overcome him by the blood of
[23:29] the lamb and by the work of our
[23:30] testimony so it is your testimony of
[23:32] what god has done that sets all hell to
[23:35] trembling because they're hearing that
[23:37] god is working through you and so the
[23:41] rahab and those people of the jer of
[23:43] jericho and the armies of jericho had
[23:45] heard what god was doing they'd heard
[23:47] the testimonies of the power that god
[23:49] was working through the israelites the
[23:51] victory that god was working through
[23:54] them and if this this victory this
[23:56] testimony had traveled before them and i
[23:59] thank god this morning that our
[24:00] testimony of what god has done in our
[24:02] lives and what god has done for his
[24:04] children for the bride of christ down to
[24:06] the ages is traveling before us amen
[24:09] before you even come to the battle guess
[24:11] what you already have the victory before
[24:14] israel ever came to the river jordan
[24:16] they already had the victory over
[24:18] jericho yet they did not have that
[24:20] revelation 40 years prior to that when
[24:23] those first spies went the first spies
[24:26] went across to receive enemy enemy
[24:28] intelligence to understand the enemy to
[24:30] understand what the battle was set
[24:31] before them but instead of coming back
[24:34] with a revelation of the victory they
[24:37] came back in defeat saying there's no
[24:39] way we can overcome them the purpose of
[24:42] sending a spy is not to come back and
[24:44] tell us we can't fight it's not to come
[24:46] back and tell us you can't do it is to
[24:48] collect the information we need to fight
[24:51] amen and that's where they failed and so
[24:54] now we have the two spies going across
[24:56] the river jordan to to uh this 40 years
[24:59] later for for the battle this time
[25:01] around and they receive the good news of
[25:04] the testimony the enemy is testifying
[25:08] for their victory amen and i don't know
[25:10] about you but that makes me feel like
[25:12] doing some shouting this morning to hear
[25:13] the enemy testify of my victory but see
[25:16] what does the devil do what is he he is
[25:18] a liar so why are we listening to him
[25:21] right
[25:22] why do we care what he has to say about
[25:24] us
[25:25] he's a liar
[25:26] he does not speak truth if he spake
[25:28] truth he could not be the devil
[25:30] well he does speak truth i take that
[25:31] back
[25:32] he does speak truth when when he um
[25:36] sorry
[25:37] he he can't speak the truth but he
[25:40] twists it to his own purpose but the
[25:42] bible testifies of who we are do we want
[25:45] to accept what the devil testifies of
[25:47] what we should be or what he thinks we
[25:49] should be or what he says we are when
[25:50] it's not the truth where the word of god
[25:52] testifies of who we are and that's where
[25:54] we find our victory
[25:56] when you listen to the devil and then
[25:58] you you lose the victory the devil came
[26:01] to jesus in the wilderness when he was
[26:03] fasting and spoke truth he quoted the
[26:07] scriptures can you not speak to these
[26:09] stones and make bread out of them but he
[26:11] was twisting that truth to bring defeat
[26:15] in jesus because if jesus would have
[26:17] done that and accepted that and then we
[26:19] would not have that sacrifice upon the
[26:21] cross remember god turned that down amen
[26:25] just a little bit of truth eve had just
[26:27] a little bit of truth
[26:29] that she twisted and then there was the
[26:31] fall in the garden of eden so the
[26:33] devil's motives are always contrary to
[26:36] your victory amen and so here we have
[26:40] here we have the the enemy testifying of
[26:43] of the israelites victory before they
[26:46] ever fought about the battle
[26:48] before they were ever set about and
[26:50] began to to march around the walls like
[26:52] the word was given to them to do they
[26:54] already had the victory but see the
[26:56] devil knows you already have the victory
[26:59] but he wants to convince you otherwise
[27:02] he wants to convince you that he wants
[27:04] to tell you that you are not victorious
[27:06] that you will fall in battle and you
[27:08] know what when you listen to him what
[27:10] happens
[27:12] you fall in battle remember but christ
[27:14] has won the ultimate victory the war we
[27:17] fall down but we get back up sometimes
[27:20] sometimes we fall down but we always get
[27:22] back up by god's grace in our life and
[27:24] so
[27:26] here you have um um
[27:28] the the devil testifying to these two
[27:31] spies verse 10 for we have heard how the
[27:33] lord dried up the water of the red sea
[27:35] for you when you came out of egypt and
[27:38] what she did unto the two kings of the
[27:40] amorites that were on the other side of
[27:42] jordan saihan and og whom he utterly
[27:45] destroyed and as soon as we had heard
[27:47] these things our hearts did melt neither
[27:50] did there remain any more courage in any
[27:52] man because of you for the lord your god
[27:54] he is god in heaven above and in earth
[27:57] beneath now therefore i pray you
[28:01] swear unto me by the lord since i have
[28:03] showed you kindness that ye will also
[28:05] show kindness unto my father's house and
[28:08] give me a true token
[28:10] i guess i went a little on one verse too
[28:12] far there but the spies were sent in to
[28:14] take a look
[28:16] and what they received from the enemy
[28:18] was the testimony of their victory but
[28:21] yet still
[28:22] the men of jericho
[28:24] the soldiers jericho stood upon the
[28:26] walls mocking the israelites as they
[28:28] marched around they were doing what god
[28:30] called them to do to find the victory
[28:33] but um
[28:34] the devil was still trying to convince
[28:36] them
[28:37] that they were going to lose and so the
[28:39] same thing amen goes for us praise the
[28:41] lord
[28:42] another man in the bible
[28:44] by the name of gideon was called to
[28:46] fight the enemy
[28:48] now gideon if you go read the story
[28:55] was
[28:56] hiding
[28:58] from the enemy
[29:00] how many have you ever hid from the
[29:01] enemy
[29:03] no do we have some truth speakers here
[29:05] this morning
[29:07] okay i'll be honest for you
[29:10] i have and we all have at some point hid
[29:13] from the enemy
[29:15] but see
[29:17] that's only because gideon was listening
[29:19] to the enemy
[29:20] he was listening to the enemy's
[29:22] testimony of who he was
[29:26] but the angel came down to gideon and
[29:28] said and found gideon hiding behind the
[29:31] hey gideon
[29:32] hey buddy hey come here
[29:34] a mighty man of valor
[29:37] hiding behind the rock would you call a
[29:39] man hiding from the enemy a mighty man a
[29:41] dollar
[29:42] we wouldn't
[29:45] we would say that man needs to be needs
[29:47] to get some some courage in his in him
[29:49] but see
[29:50] god could see
[29:52] what the outward could not what god
[29:55] could see past the outside into the
[29:58] heart and he had called gideon and see
[30:01] the only thing that gideon was lacking
[30:03] was the revelation
[30:04] of who he was
[30:08] that's the only thing that separates you
[30:10] from victory in your life
[30:13] is the revelation of who you are in
[30:15] christ brother maryland said if the
[30:17] bride of christ could recognize
[30:20] the two spirits operating in the
[30:22] framework of the church she would be an
[30:23] invincible army in other words if she
[30:26] could discern between what the devil's
[30:28] testimony and christ's testimony because
[30:31] the bible says if if if it were possible
[30:34] they would be so close to the seated
[30:35] very elect but it's not possible so you
[30:38] need revelation to understand the word
[30:40] of god for your day
[30:42] and for your victory it's one of the
[30:45] same thing you cannot separate your life
[30:48] as a christian from victory amen it's
[30:50] the same thing because when we cross
[30:52] over jordan into the other side when we
[30:54] rapture out of here one day that is our
[30:57] final victory amen
[30:59] so gideon now he he has an understanding
[31:02] he thinks he has a revelation but it's a
[31:04] man made revelation
[31:07] that i'm a coward
[31:11] do you find victory in a man-made
[31:13] organization
[31:15] do you find victory in denominations you
[31:17] do not find victory anywhere christ is
[31:20] not
[31:22] and then christ is outside of the church
[31:24] knocking on the door to get in because
[31:26] they have rejected him in this age but
[31:29] the true believer of christ following
[31:31] the word of god and the message for the
[31:33] hour will will receive the revelation
[31:36] for victory because christ is in her
[31:39] midst
[31:40] amen so now gideon has come to a crucial
[31:43] point in his life and you will come to
[31:45] that point in your life and you will and
[31:47] you have and you will again where god
[31:50] comes around and says hey look he
[31:52] doesn't he didn't forsake gideon
[31:54] gideon was listening to the wrong voice
[31:57] but christ did not forsake him the giant
[32:00] was speaking to gideon but christ
[32:03] answered back so you never have to fear
[32:05] you never have to fear the devil or fear
[32:07] even when you feel in feel yourself in
[32:10] weakness you do not have to fear because
[32:12] god will answer back
[32:14] god will stand and testify for you and
[32:18] will give you the revelation you need
[32:19] will give you the
[32:21] enemy intelligence you need to find
[32:23] victory in your situation
[32:26] when the giant speaks christ answers
[32:29] back so gideon the angel finds him and
[32:31] get he begins to tell gideon you're a
[32:33] mighty man of hour
[32:35] i have called you to fight against the
[32:37] enemy god has called every single one of
[32:39] us to fight against the enemy and gideon
[32:42] says well you know let me do a fleece
[32:44] and and you know if it's wet and the
[32:45] ground is dry then we're good you know
[32:47] well hold on a second let's do it one
[32:49] more time if the ground is wet and the
[32:51] fleece is dry then i'll i'll accept it
[32:53] right and god was patient
[32:57] god was patient see sometimes i think we
[32:59] fail because we preach a god who is
[33:01] standing over us with the rod
[33:04] to beat us down when we make one little
[33:05] mistake but that's not the god i serve
[33:08] the god i serve is standing there saying
[33:10] you can make it you can do it i believe
[33:13] in you the rest of the world wants to
[33:15] tell you who you are or who you aren't
[33:19] and bring you down
[33:21] and tell you you're doing it wrong and
[33:23] make fun and do this but god is there
[33:26] standing by your side to guide you and
[33:29] lead you that's why even in the little
[33:30] things you know i was looking at a truck
[33:32] the other day with my father-in-law
[33:34] brother scott and uh you know i mean i'm
[33:36] not a mechanic i know little things i
[33:39] can look for i've bought a few cars but
[33:42] um
[33:43] i can't tell everything even a good
[33:44] mechanic can't find everything wrong
[33:46] with the car so i just prayed lord open
[33:48] my eyes to anything that would not be
[33:50] good to make this purchase see god can
[33:52] guide us why don't we worry about it you
[33:54] have an interview or you have a problem
[33:57] you're trying to to do at work you say
[33:59] lord show me
[34:00] give me the answer
[34:03] you know
[34:03] lead me through this and just have faith
[34:05] and god does it every single time
[34:08] he looks you you don't have to doubt or
[34:10] fear anything even the little things we
[34:12] say we talk about doubt and fear we
[34:14] think about going out and fighting
[34:15] goliath
[34:17] but it could be the little things like
[34:19] you know
[34:21] looking at a truck
[34:33] so gideon
[34:35] takes the word of the lord and he says
[34:37] all right i'll go get an army
[34:39] so he goes out and he gets an army gets
[34:40] all the fighting men of israel to come
[34:42] out and stand with him
[34:44] and now now he begins to get confidence
[34:46] because there's a lot of guys a lot of
[34:48] good fighting guys you know
[34:50] kind of when the church is full
[34:52] or not
[34:53] people have greater confidence or not
[34:57] and uh but see that's what man looks
[34:59] like looks at
[35:01] see we'll get down to david here shortly
[35:03] but you see
[35:05] samuel went to anoint the next king of
[35:07] israel and he looked to the biggest and
[35:08] strongest man of the son of jesse
[35:11] but god said look i don't look on that i
[35:13] look on the inside
[35:14] you know you can be the biggest
[35:16] strongest toughest
[35:17] i mean you can know you could be the
[35:19] highest ranking brazilian jiu jitsu
[35:21] warrior in the world you can pull pull
[35:24] 550 600 pounds off the floor you can
[35:26] press 300 pounds but one day your body
[35:29] will die and rot in the ground
[35:33] and that doesn't mean you're going to
[35:34] live forever you have strong men who die
[35:36] at 45 and they are fit and healthy
[35:40] there is nothing that can hold you or
[35:42] give you ultimate victory except for
[35:44] christ that one was free i don't know
[35:45] where that came from but um
[35:48] you still got to be healthy right
[35:49] anyways
[35:51] everything in balance
[35:53] don't go out and just eat mcdonald's
[35:54] every day because you're going to die
[35:55] anyways and you know praise the lord
[36:00] alrighty so
[36:03] now getting has a big army before him
[36:05] he's ready to go fight
[36:07] but see god's like now hang on a second
[36:10] tell everybody who's afraid to go home
[36:15] all right
[36:17] gideon probably kind of like okay i'll
[36:19] do that but you know
[36:20] maybe 10 people will go away
[36:23] all right anybody of you men
[36:25] right who who
[36:27] who who which man in here in this church
[36:30] today wants to admit to their brothers
[36:32] to their fellow
[36:33] men that they're afraid of something
[36:35] right now when there's a group of guys
[36:36] nobody's afraid of anything right
[36:40] but
[36:40] i've i'd have to look to the scripture
[36:42] to remember but a whole bunch of them
[36:43] left
[36:45] they walked away so wow he's
[36:47] kind of wondering okay you know but he's
[36:49] doing the math in his head right the man
[36:51] math in his head and he's like yeah with
[36:52] this many people you know this many many
[36:54] nights it can kind of balance this out
[36:56] maybe sort of um well i think we're
[36:58] going to be okay again he says hey and
[37:00] the lord says hang on a second get in
[37:01] there's still too many guys
[37:04] okay
[37:06] all right lord so take him down to the
[37:08] river and have him drink some some some
[37:10] get a drink from the water
[37:12] 300 men are left after all that
[37:16] they say
[37:17] you see some people they don't
[37:21] understand god in that and we don't
[37:23] understand god completely
[37:26] god does not do things the way we think
[37:29] they should be done sometimes
[37:34] to them you would think oh you know if
[37:36] if this is churches of god it'll grow
[37:39] it'll get big there'll be all kinds of
[37:41] people you know it'll be the size of
[37:42] joel osteen
[37:45] but that's not how god works
[37:48] he say oh if god's gonna fight an army
[37:50] you know he has the power to go pick
[37:52] every man and make them all come and
[37:54] fight
[37:55] but god doesn't do that
[38:00] because god knows the heart and he knows
[38:03] what needs to be done
[38:05] and you have to you still have a choice
[38:08] he can't he just forced us all
[38:11] to serve him what would be the point of
[38:12] grace
[38:15] so now gideon has 300 men and um
[38:20] he is going to go fight these midianites
[38:22] now you have to understand something
[38:23] about the midianites they were there
[38:27] taking israel's food every
[38:30] harvest
[38:31] because of israel's sin
[38:33] israel had turned their back on god
[38:37] but
[38:39] if there's one thing i know of my god
[38:41] he's gracious
[38:43] they begin to cry out and say lord we've
[38:46] done wrong
[38:47] we're in this position because of
[38:50] self-inflicted trouble
[38:52] but we
[38:53] cannot do it
[38:55] see god will bring trials and things
[38:57] into your life
[38:59] because
[39:00] get brought upon by self-inflicted
[39:03] trouble
[39:05] you you will have trouble in your life
[39:06] that is self-afflicted that's what i'm
[39:07] trying to say
[39:09] but when you realize
[39:11] that that's the reason
[39:14] you don't have to go fight the battle
[39:15] yourself
[39:16] you turn to god
[39:18] see the other day i was thinking upon
[39:20] these things and then some the
[39:21] difference between a believer and
[39:23] someone that's not serving god is a
[39:25] believer has accepted god's grace for
[39:28] their life
[39:31] some people think they're too bad to
[39:32] accept god or or or they want to do it
[39:35] themselves but the bible says the basis
[39:37] of sin is unbelief
[39:40] if you can accept god's grace you have
[39:42] unbelief that god's grace is powerful
[39:45] enough for you you have unbelief that
[39:47] god's grace cannot change you that god's
[39:50] grace is not for you
[39:52] but when you have faith in god's grace
[39:54] and accept it for your life that is what
[39:57] makes you a
[39:59] that's what brings you into fellowship
[40:01] and god testifies of that giving you the
[40:03] holy ghost
[40:06] but here's the catch here's the paradox
[40:08] of predestination you cannot accept
[40:11] god's grace excuse me god's grace
[40:14] you can't accept god's grace for your
[40:16] life unless god's grace is for your life
[40:23] that's the paradox of christ
[40:26] but they accepted god's grace for their
[40:28] life and god called gideon and gideon
[40:30] went in the darkness of night and he
[40:32] tore down the islands first thing you
[40:34] got to do when you realize that you're
[40:36] underneath self-inflicted trouble go
[40:38] tear those islands down
[40:40] go do your repenting go make things
[40:41] right go go do what you need to do to
[40:44] set it in order because guess what
[40:46] you're about to fight submittings
[40:49] but not on your own
[40:52] not on your own even though they were in
[40:54] that position because of their neglect
[40:56] their iniquity their sins god still
[40:59] fought their battle for them
[41:02] and god called a man to take it down and
[41:04] god has a there is a god called man
[41:07] there is jesus you are a god called man
[41:10] and he has called you to take down the
[41:12] millions in your family in your life but
[41:14] he's going to give you what you need to
[41:17] do it
[41:18] but the member says and if god be with
[41:20] us then where is all the miracles in
[41:22] 1961 and how
[41:24] that they had done the israelites the
[41:26] philistines the midianites the amorites
[41:28] and all the different ones had come in
[41:30] like locusts and just eat up what they
[41:31] had and take it out and go on but did
[41:33] you notice they could not do that until
[41:35] israel first fell away from god
[41:38] the devil can't set a foot on you to
[41:40] hurt you until first you get away from
[41:42] god
[41:44] excuse me you must first remember that
[41:47] check when anything happens see if you
[41:48] are in the faith or not
[41:50] see that if you're right up to the place
[41:52] with god then remember the devil can do
[41:54] you no harm you're in christ
[41:57] see you check first hand come to a trial
[41:59] you check your life by the way it says
[42:02] now that check just simply means is
[42:04] there anything you need to do
[42:07] if there's not
[42:08] guess what the outcome is still the same
[42:10] victory
[42:11] as long as you have faith and you trust
[42:13] in god to come on the scene and as a
[42:16] gideon was called he was in the will of
[42:18] god and he was chosen to fight
[42:21] but he was still afraid because remember
[42:24] our title is enemy intelligence
[42:26] the giant said to speak
[42:28] and christ is answering back gideon
[42:31] already had the victory
[42:33] did you know that
[42:35] before he didn't even even had his men
[42:37] picked out for the battle he already had
[42:38] the victory
[42:40] before the midianites even came
[42:43] that year gideon already had the victory
[42:45] when gideon was hiding behind the whale
[42:47] or the rock or whatever it was he
[42:48] already had the victory
[42:50] when you're hiding in defeat you already
[42:52] have the victory
[42:54] so let me tell you a little bit about
[42:56] we're going to go to the other side of
[42:57] the line and collect a little bit of
[42:59] intelligence to give you the faith you
[43:01] need to fight
[43:02] so god says take your servant judges
[43:05] seven verse nine you're gonna pull that
[43:06] up take your servant and go down to the
[43:08] camp of the midians
[43:11] and it came to pass that same night that
[43:12] the lord said unto him arise and get
[43:14] thee down unto the host for i have
[43:15] delivered it into thine hand
[43:18] see god never came along until getting
[43:19] what he was doing wrong
[43:21] he never came along and said kidding why
[43:23] are you hiding stop hiding come on man
[43:24] knock it off he came along and all he
[43:27] told gideon was you had the victory the
[43:29] victory is yours i've given them into
[43:31] your hand you already have he just kept
[43:33] testifying to gideon building him up
[43:36] preparing him for the victory so god
[43:39] sends him down he says take your servant
[43:41] fira
[43:42] verse 11 and thou shalt hear what they
[43:44] say and afterward shall thine hand be
[43:46] strengthened to go down unto the host
[43:48] then when he down with fury his servant
[43:50] unto the outside of the arm to men that
[43:52] were in the host and the midianites and
[43:54] the amalekites and all the children of
[43:56] the east lay along in the valley like
[43:57] grasshoppers for multitude and their
[44:00] camels were without number as the sand
[44:02] by the seaside for multitude
[44:06] it's a pretty big
[44:07] host of the enemy
[44:09] and when gideon was come behold there
[44:11] was a man that told a dream unto his
[44:13] fellow so gideon sneaks in right he's
[44:16] collecting some enemy intelligence he
[44:17] sneaks in alongside a tent
[44:19] god laid him for the right tent to begin
[44:21] with
[44:24] see
[44:25] god is taking gideon down to encourage
[44:27] him even though god already knows the
[44:29] battle is is gideon
[44:31] see god cares enough to come along and
[44:33] encourage you in the fight
[44:35] he sends gideon down and he says no not
[44:37] that ten gideon this one over here just
[44:39] okay now put your ear to the door and
[44:41] listen
[44:42] god could have just told him
[44:44] but god wanted to
[44:46] get in to hear the enemy testify of his
[44:49] victory
[44:50] so gideon puts his ear to the tent
[44:53] a man says hey i had a dream of a dream
[44:55] and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled
[44:57] into the host of midian and came unto a
[45:00] tent and smoted that it fell and
[45:02] overturned it that the tit lay along in
[45:04] other words flat in the tent
[45:08] and his fellow engineer said whoa man
[45:10] that's that's giddy
[45:12] that there's nothing else beside that's
[45:13] not that that that that says nothing
[45:16] else say the sword of gideon the son of
[45:17] joash
[45:19] a man of israel
[45:21] see the devil knows your name
[45:24] and he knows you have the victory
[45:28] a man of israel into his hand hath god
[45:31] deliver bidian
[45:32] and all the hosts
[45:36] so now
[45:37] hearing this boosted gideon's faith
[45:40] gideon stands up slips away from camp
[45:43] you see the battle was already won for
[45:46] christ was on gideon's side
[45:48] but he needed a revelation of that
[45:52] revelation is your weapon to fight the
[45:54] enemy
[45:55] revelation is the holding power against
[45:58] the devil revelation is the standard
[46:01] that christ has raised up for the flood
[46:04] we're the the church age that we are in
[46:07] is the stand the word of god given for
[46:09] your excuse me the word of god given for
[46:11] your hour is the standard to hold up
[46:14] against the flood of the enemy
[46:16] and the revelation of that is what gives
[46:18] you victory over the enemy
[46:21] judges 17 verse 15 i didn't give it to
[46:23] them but and it was so when gideon heard
[46:25] the telling of the dream and the
[46:26] interpretation thereof that he
[46:28] worshipped and returned into the host of
[46:30] israel and said arise for the lord had
[46:33] to delay it into your hand the host
[46:35] of midian
[46:38] now gideon goes back and gideon starts
[46:40] to speak the word of god
[46:43] see now nobody could come and tell him
[46:45] your army is too small
[46:47] nobody nobody can come and tell gideon
[46:49] you're not strong enough to fight the
[46:51] enemy nobody could come and tell gideon
[46:53] god didn't pick you god didn't choose
[46:56] you because now gideon had a revelation
[46:58] of his victory
[47:01] hasn't even fought the battle yet but
[47:03] gideon knew
[47:04] he's sometimes in a in a in a fight you
[47:07] know like a boxing match or a wrestling
[47:09] match
[47:10] if the other two the one that knows he's
[47:13] gonna win and the one that doubts it
[47:15] the one who knows usually wins
[47:18] it gives you the upper hand you can both
[47:20] be in the same for the
[47:22] physical condition but as science has
[47:24] proven
[47:25] and uh endurance sports have proven it's
[47:28] all in your head
[47:29] it's whatever you think you can do it
[47:32] you can do it
[47:34] the big difference
[47:35] i think between running three miles and
[47:37] five miles is your head
[47:40] the pain is kind of the same
[47:42] it's all in your head if
[47:44] you have to tell yourself you can do it
[47:48] you have to believe in your head and
[47:50] just keep on pushing forward now the
[47:51] same thing transfers into the spiritual
[47:53] god gives you revelation in your heart
[47:56] for the victory
[47:58] you will have the victory
[48:01] nothing can stop you nothing can turn
[48:03] you aside
[48:04] praise the lord so gideon went down with
[48:06] his men
[48:08] and they fought against the midians and
[48:09] scared the daylights out of the
[48:11] midianites
[48:12] and they all took tail and ram
[48:14] and god slew them
[48:18] but see gideon wasn't surprised
[48:20] he knew he had the victory already
[48:27] there was a problem by the name of
[48:28] elisha
[48:30] second kings six verse eight
[48:35] oh i'm sorry
[48:37] i gave them my notes a little bit too
[48:38] early
[48:40] second king chapter six if you want to
[48:41] turn there you can i'm gonna jump there
[48:43] real quick and just read that for sake
[48:45] of time second
[48:47] because you know
[48:48] our pastor and brother david has been
[48:50] borrowing my time for the last couple of
[48:51] weeks so i ain't got much left
[48:53] second kings chapter seven
[48:57] verse three
[48:59] and there were four left oh
[49:03] chapter six verse eight then the king of
[49:05] syria warned against israel and took
[49:07] counsel with his servants saying in such
[49:09] a such a place shall be my camp and the
[49:11] man of god sent unto the king of israel
[49:13] saying and beware that thou pass not
[49:15] such a place for that the syrians are
[49:17] come down
[49:20] they don't have intelligence that good
[49:21] even today
[49:23] our military
[49:25] and the king of israel sent to as soon
[49:26] as the king spoke it in his secret
[49:29] chambers
[49:31] elisha was already listening
[49:34] and the king of israel sent to the place
[49:36] which the man of god told him and warned
[49:38] him of and saved himself there not once
[49:41] or twice so it happened several times
[49:44] therefore the heart of the king of syria
[49:45] was sore troubled for this thing and he
[49:47] called this servants and said to them
[49:48] all right who's the spy
[49:51] who is the one that's betraying us to
[49:52] the israel and one of the servants
[49:54] speaks up says oh my king listen he's
[49:58] like elisha the prophet that is in
[49:59] israel telleth the king of israel the
[50:01] words that thou speakest in thy bed
[50:02] chamber
[50:04] so elisha was receiving
[50:07] uh
[50:09] i write the words of my head
[50:12] um
[50:14] instant i guess enemy intelligence live
[50:17] it was live
[50:19] he was tapped in he was receiving live
[50:21] intelligence of the enemy
[50:24] and the king of israel was using that
[50:26] intelligence to fight against the enemy
[50:28] he was using down intelligence to escape
[50:31] ambush
[50:32] what was that word that was the word
[50:34] from the lord to elisha to the king of
[50:36] israel see god gives you the word
[50:40] so that you won't step in
[50:43] the minds and the ambushes of the enemy
[50:45] so not only does god come along and
[50:47] fight for you when you put yourself in
[50:49] trouble
[50:50] but god comes along and prevents you
[50:53] from stepping in to that trouble we just
[50:55] heard it the other day you know
[50:57] you're gonna go somewhere and you you
[50:59] get held up by you know at the house or
[51:01] something and then there's an accident
[51:03] or or or maybe there was going to be one
[51:05] but you weren't there so there was no
[51:06] accident
[51:08] simple things that god does like like
[51:10] that and then spiritually god keeps you
[51:12] from you know
[51:14] hearing something you shouldn't or
[51:17] or um you know being in
[51:20] hearing something you shouldn't i'm
[51:21] going to leave it at that god keeps you
[51:23] from that stuff
[51:25] an ambush of the enemy
[51:28] because
[51:29] you have the upper hand
[51:32] you had the enemy intelligence you
[51:33] already know okay we can go into this
[51:36] you already know the end of the story
[51:37] right we have the victory
[51:42] praise the lord
[51:45] amen did y'all bring your
[51:47] brains with you this morning
[51:49] or your vocal cords nah just kidding i'm
[51:52] teasing
[51:56] so elisha
[52:00] knew what was going on
[52:01] and that king of syria
[52:04] didn't know what to do
[52:08] but it gave israel the upper hand
[52:12] and in second kings chapter seven
[52:14] we can read about a few uh there was a
[52:16] few lepers
[52:17] four lepers
[52:19] and uh
[52:21] so after this
[52:24] uh the king of syria comes and
[52:26] takes siege of israel
[52:31] and um
[52:32] they're
[52:34] they resorted to eating their own
[52:36] children things are really really bad
[52:39] and so there's these four leopards
[52:40] sitting out front of the gates
[52:44] and i started in uh verse three here
[52:47] and there were four lepers men at the
[52:49] entering in of the gate and they said
[52:51] one to another why sit we here until we
[52:53] die if we say we will enter into the
[52:55] city then the famine is in the city and
[52:57] we shall die there and if we sit still
[52:59] here we die also now therefore come and
[53:01] let us fall into the host of the syrians
[53:03] if they save us alive we shall live and
[53:05] if they kill us we shall but die
[53:08] now so you all want you to come to a
[53:09] place where you're just ready to
[53:10] surrender completely
[53:13] you know you realize you realize
[53:15] you can do nothing but just
[53:17] well you know if like the queen esther
[53:20] if i perish i perish
[53:22] you realize you know i you surrender to
[53:25] god and then god can bring you victory
[53:27] because when you're not surrendered to
[53:28] god you're just getting in the way
[53:31] so these are here are these lepers
[53:32] they're like we're going to die either
[53:33] way so let's go to the syrians
[53:36] and they rose up in the twilight to go
[53:38] into the camp of the syrians and when
[53:40] they were come to the uttermost part of
[53:41] the camp of syria behold there was no
[53:43] man there for the lord had made the host
[53:46] of the syrians to hear a noise of
[53:48] chariots and the noise of horses even
[53:49] the noise of a great host and they said
[53:52] one to another lo the king of israel
[53:53] hath hired against us the king of the
[53:55] hittites and the king of the egyptians
[53:57] to come upon us wherefore they arose and
[54:00] fled in the twilight and left their
[54:02] tents and their horses and their asses
[54:03] even the camp as it was and fled for
[54:05] their life and when these lepers came to
[54:07] the utmost part of the camp they went
[54:09] into one tent and did eat and drink
[54:12] and carry then silver and gold and
[54:14] raiment and went and hid it and came
[54:16] again and entered into another tent and
[54:18] carried then also and went and hid it
[54:20] then they said one to another we do not
[54:22] well this day so then they take tidings
[54:24] of of this
[54:26] the syrians being fled back to the city
[54:29] and everyone goes out and um
[54:31] but actually her in verse uh
[54:34] um 10. so they came and called into the
[54:37] port of the sea so they go back to the
[54:38] city
[54:39] and they told them saying we come to the
[54:40] camp of the syrians and behold there was
[54:42] no man there neither voice of men but
[54:44] horses tied and assessed and the tents
[54:46] as they were
[54:47] and he called the porters and they told
[54:49] it to the king's house within and the
[54:51] king arose in the night and said unto
[54:52] his servants i will now show you what
[54:55] the syrians have done to us they know
[54:57] that we be hungry and therefore are they
[54:58] gone out of the camp to hide themselves
[55:00] in the field saying when they come out
[55:02] of the city we shall catch them alive
[55:04] and get into the city so the king hears
[55:07] this and he says well you know it's just
[55:08] some lepers what do they know
[55:11] something god brings his word through
[55:14] the most unexpected sources
[55:16] amen there is a man by the name of
[55:19] balaam
[55:20] who got word from the lord from a donkey
[55:24] because god wants to test your faith
[55:26] and say oh you know what what does that
[55:28] person know or what do they know or
[55:31] so the king so
[55:33] the king won't accept it
[55:35] because he's too busy living in fear
[55:39] and
[55:39] all the while they're sitting there in
[55:42] their bondage underneath a siege
[55:45] it was a false siege there was no enemy
[55:51] sometimes we keep ourselves trapped even
[55:54] when there is no enemy because of our
[55:56] fear to step beyond
[55:59] in
[56:00] towards the enemy sometimes god says
[56:02] look you need to take a step of faith
[56:04] step forward into battle and as soon as
[56:07] you do the waters part before you
[56:10] but you have to take that state so that
[56:12] that step forward here are all these
[56:14] people in israel starving to death at
[56:16] this and at this point in time before
[56:18] the lepers go
[56:19] there's no enemy
[56:23] it was already defeated and re and run
[56:26] in fear
[56:31] all the while you were in your sin in
[56:33] the world you were free
[56:36] all the while you were in your sickness
[56:38] you were healed
[56:40] because god did it before the foundation
[56:43] of the world you just had to come to a
[56:45] place where you caught a revelation of
[56:48] that and we're able to accept it
[56:52] why do we doubt why do we worry about
[56:54] what we face in life and the situations
[56:56] we face if we can only realize that the
[56:59] victory
[57:01] was ours
[57:03] in other words it already happened
[57:07] it's not that battle i i have to go i'm
[57:09] gonna fight this battle no you the
[57:11] battle was already fought before you
[57:13] even came to face it
[57:16] that i'm bringing you this morning
[57:18] enemy intelligence guess what they're
[57:20] scared of you
[57:23] even when the weakest christian gets
[57:25] down on their knees all hell trembles
[57:30] so what do we fear
[57:32] when the giant speaks christ answers
[57:34] back and he uses you to do it
[57:40] praise the lord
[57:43] so they were already free
[57:45] and didn't know it until the king was
[57:47] willing to step past in faith and it
[57:48] wasn't even the king one of his servants
[57:50] said come on just let us take five of
[57:52] the horses that are left and go check
[57:55] and they go and check and
[57:56] everything's there all the food
[57:59] so not only did they have victory and
[58:00] they were no longer in bondage god
[58:02] provided what they needed
[58:05] to feed themselves
[58:07] and to bring their city back into
[58:09] working order
[58:10] now you know can you talk about giants
[58:13] without bringing up david and goliath
[58:16] david had no fear of this giant named
[58:18] goliath for he knew he could defeat him
[58:20] so now we're going to come up because
[58:24] and look at an example where a son of
[58:26] god knew
[58:27] he had the victory before
[58:29] he walks up and that's what god's
[58:31] calling us to be he wants us to stand in
[58:34] confidence that's not arrogance when you
[58:37] stand in confidence and you know god's
[58:39] going to do what he says he's going to
[58:40] do
[58:41] that is confidence in christ that is
[58:43] confidence in the seed that he has
[58:45] placed inside your heart to fight
[58:48] against the wiles of the devil
[58:50] david comes into the camp and he hears
[58:53] the philistine mocking the children of
[58:55] israel
[58:56] and saying you know come on send out
[58:58] your champion to fight against me
[59:00] and his
[59:01] knee-jerk response is who's going to
[59:03] fight him
[59:05] everyone else's knee-jerk response was
[59:06] run and hide
[59:08] but see david knew because david had
[59:10] already been through the battle of
[59:12] gideon
[59:13] when he slew the lion and the bear that
[59:15] tried to take his sheep
[59:17] he'd already been and see god brings us
[59:19] through those battles like gideon
[59:23] to prepare us for the next one
[59:26] and he's he's rooting for you that the
[59:28] lord is saying i know you can do it son
[59:30] and for the next time you come up to the
[59:32] battle things of god remember what you
[59:34] heard this morning and stand in
[59:36] confidence like david and says i'll go
[59:38] fight him
[59:43] the lord had already given him the
[59:46] enemy's intelligence
[59:48] david already had it
[59:50] he already had the little you know
[59:52] it's not telegrams anymore but the
[59:54] the cryptic message the encrypted
[59:57] message he already decoded it before he
[59:59] ever showed up at the camp of israel
[1:00:02] there's again
[1:00:03] anybody who defies the arms of the
[1:00:05] living god is doomed to defeat
[1:00:08] that was the word of god
[1:00:09] when david come david didn't know
[1:00:11] goliath was there
[1:00:13] david had no idea but when david came
[1:00:15] and he heard the goliath goliath
[1:00:17] speaking against god's word
[1:00:20] he said he's already lost
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:26] the giant goliath was
[1:00:28] okay
[1:00:29] so david already had the intelligence
[1:00:30] now here's the thing and and
[1:00:34] that was always going to be my subtitle
[1:00:36] but the giant goliath was not what he
[1:00:39] seemed
[1:00:42] the devil's a liar right so he comes at
[1:00:44] you with a giant in your life guess what
[1:00:46] that giant is not what he wants to tell
[1:00:48] you it is he wants to tell you that
[1:00:50] giant's too big for you to fight he
[1:00:51] wants to tell you you cannot defeat that
[1:00:53] giant he wants to tell you you've
[1:00:54] already lost but guess what that giant
[1:00:57] is not what it seems
[1:01:01] goliath stood there
[1:01:04] expecting david to come at him with
[1:01:05] sword and a shield because that was the
[1:01:07] custom that was the the tradition
[1:01:12] of the saints of god
[1:01:14] the denominational world religion of
[1:01:17] organized religion has a traditional way
[1:01:19] of fighting the enemy
[1:01:23] but whenever you say this is how god
[1:01:26] fights the enemy
[1:01:28] you miss it when god turns the corner
[1:01:30] that's the word
[1:01:31] but ram says
[1:01:33] down through the ages you know the
[1:01:35] luther and wesley and these those church
[1:01:37] ages they had the lutherans and the
[1:01:39] methodists they built a wall on their
[1:01:43] organization and on their doctrine and
[1:01:45] said this is it and god turned the
[1:01:47] corner into the age of wesley
[1:01:50] the methodists built their wall and then
[1:01:52] god turned the corner into the laodicean
[1:01:55] churches or the and then they had
[1:01:56] pentecost in the baptism of the holy
[1:01:58] ghost
[1:02:02] so
[1:02:04] this is how you fight the enemy
[1:02:07] you know the first church of saul
[1:02:09] this is how you fight the enemy so he
[1:02:11] tries to put this stuff on david but see
[1:02:13] david was a god-called man
[1:02:16] man's tradition and organizations don't
[1:02:18] fit on a god called man
[1:02:21] because you can't fight the present
[1:02:23] enemy
[1:02:24] using
[1:02:26] those things
[1:02:28] the enemy that david was facing could
[1:02:30] not be fought traditionally
[1:02:35] god was thinking outside the box
[1:02:39] so here is goliath
[1:02:41] i wonder did anybody in the camp of
[1:02:43] israel think they ought to try a sling
[1:02:47] no it's it's a goliath he has a shield
[1:02:50] and a spear and a sword
[1:02:52] so we got to fight him with a shield and
[1:02:54] a spear and a sword
[1:02:55] it's just it's just how you that's how
[1:02:58] you know that was the traditions of the
[1:02:59] day a champion comes out and says you
[1:03:01] know send your champion they fought in
[1:03:03] hand-to-hand combat but david steps out
[1:03:05] there
[1:03:06] with a sling
[1:03:09] and people probably like oh goodness
[1:03:12] what is in his what kind of ideas does
[1:03:15] he have here
[1:03:16] but see
[1:03:18] christ always goes against the
[1:03:20] traditions of men
[1:03:23] don't get stuck in tradition
[1:03:25] there's things that are tradition that
[1:03:27] are fine
[1:03:28] but don't get so steep in it when god
[1:03:29] moves dynamically you miss it
[1:03:33] amen praise the lord don't get so
[1:03:34] steeped and you know
[1:03:36] this is the song that we do this on that
[1:03:38] you miss when god's spirit moves to the
[1:03:40] congregation and he inspires you to
[1:03:42] worship but they're a little bit
[1:03:43] differently than what you're normal
[1:03:46] don't be so quick to judge someone who
[1:03:47] dances down the aisle
[1:03:49] because that's not the way it should be
[1:03:52] right
[1:03:52] that's oh that's pentecostalism
[1:03:55] god can move you to dance
[1:03:59] that's free i that's not in my notes
[1:04:01] god has moved me to dance
[1:04:03] and it wasn't on my own i don't feel
[1:04:05] that's embarrassing right but god moved
[1:04:07] upon me
[1:04:10] and sometimes that happens i'm gone and
[1:04:12] if we're too caught up in you know
[1:04:14] order
[1:04:15] or we're too caught up in every time the
[1:04:17] preacher says something we clap till we
[1:04:18] can't hear them
[1:04:20] right both sides of the equation god
[1:04:22] wants us to find a balance and be
[1:04:24] willing to be led of the spirit that's
[1:04:25] all i'm trying to say
[1:04:28] praise the lord so um
[1:04:30] here's a gl goliath was expecting david
[1:04:32] to come out with him you see
[1:04:34] the enemy doesn't know everything you
[1:04:35] know
[1:04:36] even the third full brother brother man
[1:04:38] talks about the third poll it's a secret
[1:04:39] thing the devil is trying to figure it
[1:04:41] out but he can't
[1:04:43] and it's a spoken word
[1:04:47] so saul tried to dress david out in
[1:04:49] armor and try to address david in a man
[1:04:52] in their man revelation but david
[1:04:54] shrugged that off
[1:04:59] for the giant
[1:05:01] he had he wanted he had to go fight the
[1:05:03] giant with christ's revelation and that
[1:05:05] was a sling and five stones
[1:05:08] and david brought that giant down
[1:05:11] see but david already knew before he
[1:05:14] even came to the camp of israel he
[1:05:16] already knew
[1:05:17] that victory was his he didn't know
[1:05:19] goliath was going to be there
[1:05:21] but you know hey if there's a bear or
[1:05:22] there's a lion or something else comes
[1:05:24] at my sheep i i'm going to be able to
[1:05:26] take care of it because god has given me
[1:05:28] the ability to do so see david wasn't
[1:05:29] trusting himself if david had trusted in
[1:05:33] himself
[1:05:34] he would have dressed in armor
[1:05:37] and this award and all that
[1:05:39] golf can give you victories but don't
[1:05:41] let those victories go to your head
[1:05:44] then you think oh then i got this
[1:05:45] because as soon as you think you can do
[1:05:47] it
[1:05:48] you're gonna fall flat on your face
[1:05:50] and get drugged through the mud
[1:05:53] so what's the point
[1:05:56] what's the point this morning what you
[1:05:57] know we share these stories and we've
[1:05:59] and we've talked about that it's just
[1:06:01] it's a simple fact that i've already
[1:06:02] stated that
[1:06:04] you already have the victory
[1:06:07] when the giant stands to speak christ
[1:06:10] answers back
[1:06:11] whatever you've got you're dealing with
[1:06:14] whatever you're going through whatever
[1:06:15] position you are in life it doesn't
[1:06:17] matter what it is
[1:06:19] you already have the victory
[1:06:21] and we sing that song before i
[1:06:23] before we started this morning he's got
[1:06:25] it all in control
[1:06:27] we've seen that let's believe that
[1:06:31] um
[1:06:32] amen the devil is afraid of you
[1:06:34] regardless of what he says he's a big
[1:06:36] old bluff
[1:06:37] he's a lying without teeth but the minor
[1:06:39] says in 1955 jesus christ is saying
[1:06:41] mistake today and forever well the
[1:06:43] scripture i believe someplace says that
[1:06:45] the devils tremble when the weakest of
[1:06:46] saints goes to their knees what a power
[1:06:49] and a privilege has been given to the
[1:06:50] church of the living god when you fall
[1:06:52] to your knees in prayer even the devils
[1:06:54] tremble to the weakest of them think of
[1:06:57] it
[1:06:58] see you can't go out and fight
[1:07:01] any old way
[1:07:02] you have to fight according to god's
[1:07:05] word gideon if gideon would have taken
[1:07:08] see gideon
[1:07:09] won the battle with 300 men so you think
[1:07:12] man would say oh if he had three times
[1:07:14] that he would have done the same thing
[1:07:16] the answer is no
[1:07:17] if gideon would have went to fight the
[1:07:19] midianites with the original 3000 or
[1:07:21] whatever it was he would have lost
[1:07:25] god's ways are not always saints of god
[1:07:27] that's what he calls us the faith you
[1:07:28] know you can't argue
[1:07:31] revelation you can argue faith
[1:07:33] someone has to accept it
[1:07:37] you can get all the scriptures together
[1:07:39] and things and you can prove your point
[1:07:41] perfectly to someone who has a
[1:07:42] revelation that has faith but someone
[1:07:44] who doesn't just won't accept it
[1:07:47] you can show them the scriptures in the
[1:07:48] bible you know where it says a woman
[1:07:50] shouldn't wear that which potatoes
[1:07:51] through a man or show them in the bible
[1:07:52] where it says do women shouldn't cut
[1:07:54] their hair and all these things and they
[1:07:56] can read that verbatim and not catch it
[1:08:00] because it takes revelation in your
[1:08:01] heart and that revelation is only given
[1:08:03] by christ
[1:08:06] praise the lord
[1:08:07] so the devil is afraid of you while
[1:08:09] you're standing there in doubt you've
[1:08:12] already won
[1:08:13] because of who you are
[1:08:15] you're a son and a daughter of god
[1:08:18] start testifying on such
[1:08:21] revelation says he overcame we they
[1:08:23] overcame him who's they you the blood of
[1:08:26] christ overcame who the beast the devil
[1:08:29] satan the enemy the midianites goliath
[1:08:31] whatever name you want to put to it
[1:08:34] overcame them by the blood of the lamb
[1:08:36] you can't do it without christ
[1:08:38] you cannot do without christ
[1:08:40] and the word of their testimony
[1:08:43] in other words whether you feel it
[1:08:45] inside what maybe you're gideon in the
[1:08:47] beginning on the inside
[1:08:50] let the outside testify of gideon
[1:08:53] at the end
[1:08:56] same man
[1:08:58] different revelation
[1:09:00] he was accepting the wrong
[1:09:03] doctrine
[1:09:04] he was accepting the wrong intelligence
[1:09:08] but god came along and said hey just so
[1:09:10] you know the enemy is telling you you're
[1:09:12] worthless and you're defeated but
[1:09:15] the enemy actually scared of you
[1:09:17] and that's what we're telling you this
[1:09:19] morning the devil is scared of you
[1:09:22] so yes like gideon the enemy is already
[1:09:24] afraid of you and knows you'll win like
[1:09:26] david stand upon the revelation of how
[1:09:28] christ wants you to fight the enemy
[1:09:31] like elisha with the syrians listen to
[1:09:33] the word of the lord just to stay out of
[1:09:36] ambushes to dodge ambushes like israel
[1:09:39] with jericho take the word
[1:09:41] the enemy trembles because of you the
[1:09:43] bible tells you that's why we read this
[1:09:46] every day this when you get up and you
[1:09:47] have devotions or
[1:09:49] or whatever part of the day you do
[1:09:51] devotions or you listen to a tape and
[1:09:52] you feed on the word and you come to
[1:09:54] church
[1:09:55] guess what you're doing
[1:09:57] you're putting your ear to the tent for
[1:09:58] the midianites
[1:10:00] and you're hearing the testimony of your
[1:10:01] victory
[1:10:03] before you ever go to battle
[1:10:06] god's telling you hey you have the
[1:10:08] victory
[1:10:09] so many times i think uh we live in
[1:10:12] defeat we we we stay in bondage to thing
[1:10:15] just like the israel when they were in
[1:10:17] bondage just the syrians who weren't
[1:10:19] there we keep ourselves in bonners
[1:10:20] because of our fear and we accept the
[1:10:22] lie the devil is whispering in our in
[1:10:24] our ear and say no you weren't actually
[1:10:26] delivered
[1:10:27] no god didn't actually deliver you of
[1:10:29] smoking and drinking and all these
[1:10:30] things because you you you just did it
[1:10:33] you know
[1:10:34] an early christian or whatever coming
[1:10:36] into christ or or say you know you know
[1:10:38] you're praying for more patience and you
[1:10:39] just lost your temper see see god didn't
[1:10:42] deliver you that temper you just lost it
[1:10:46] but god already did
[1:10:48] you just have to accept it in faith many
[1:10:50] times we keep ourselves in bondage
[1:10:52] because we're too afraid to accept god's
[1:10:53] victory for our life
[1:10:55] but god is testifying this morning to
[1:10:57] you stand in confidence and victory
[1:11:00] because it is already yours amen he's
[1:11:03] got it all in control
[1:11:05] amen it's already done sing that song
[1:11:09] praise the lord accept the word of the
[1:11:11] lord
[1:11:13] to fight the enemy not very long this
[1:11:15] morning
[1:11:16] but uh hey
[1:11:18] that's all right just since uh alex you
[1:11:20] want to come up here
[1:11:22] praise the lord
[1:11:23] so next time saints of god you're faced
[1:11:25] with an adversity you're faced with a
[1:11:27] giant
[1:11:28] maybe wait a moment let christ answer
[1:11:30] back for you don't step in the way and
[1:11:33] try to deal with it you know
[1:11:36] let god
[1:11:37] answer back for you there was a time
[1:11:39] when the um
[1:11:41] the king of israel his name escapes the
[1:11:44] great battle
[1:11:45] and the word came be still
[1:11:47] don't go out to fight it for i have
[1:11:50] i am going to fight it for you it's in
[1:11:52] second chronicles or first chronicles
[1:11:55] and they don't even go fight the battle
[1:11:58] god defeats them
[1:11:59] just like that just like the the syrians
[1:12:01] facing israel god defeated they didn't
[1:12:03] have to go fight sometimes god just
[1:12:05] simply wants you to step forward in
[1:12:06] faith
