in the name of Jesus Christ amen Amen Brother David are you going to be able to travel are you guys traveling yes okay let's remember Brother David sister Diane as they would be going to Monmouth Oregon to minister for Brother Rich Cobb and the Saints over there and um so we would also just want to remember um any others I think brother Alex said that um or sister Rachel I guess it was told me but same one voice uh they'll be traveling to go see family this weekend we want the Lord to just travel with them don't see sister Carrie here tonight well just ask the Lord to touch her always our brother Tim is is working and we'd like the Lord to just uh just touch him give him strength encouragement as there and uh uh Welcome Home Sister Sarah and uh brother Titus amen trust that you had a good time in Arizona and the Lord just bless you but we're happy that you're here with us uh once again amen I want to speak to you on the title or thought thank you so much musicians um Faith proving the word in you and um it's interesting my brother and sister how that we look at things and and uh this will not be nothing new to you we're not trying to preach some new thought like it was a mystery but just reminders right to stir up our Pure Minds in remembrance how important it is because it was important enough for it to be placed in scripture and and uh you know I say if God wanted it recorded in the word he wanted us to read it remember it and have it alive and active through the ministry in in the body of Christ that Ministry isn't always the preacher behind a Pulpit right often times it is there that we are speaking one to another words of encouragement sometimes I can even relate to a recent conversation where the individual I was talking to had no idea how much they were encouraging me by the words that they were sharing and and that's what God wants us to do he wants us to find Faith through the sharing of the word through the ministry and so uh we just want to turn in uh 1 Corinthians um the first chapter verses 1-8 this evening amen it's good we had a lovely time I bring greetings to you from brother Ron Peterson and and many Believers there that uh you would know in various ways at various times uh there and it was was kind of interesting I uh we we got there went to church on Sunday and um and it seemed like half of Canada had come to Arizona and so all these people were like oh God bless you brother Paul so good to see you again so soon and uh you know it's funny because it's sometimes about environment and uh so I'm kind of looking at this some of these brothers and sisters and I'm like who are they but then the minute your memory is stirred you're like oh yes and uh so it was just lovely a a lovely time amen 1 Corinthians 1 chapter verse 1-8 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and sasines our brother unto the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God always in your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ that in everything ye that ye are everything ye are enriched by Him in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed confirmed in you and I really want to emphasize that that the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you and the end that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ amen heavenly father bless the word I pray this evening Lord we thank you for the opportunity amen you may be seated Saints I look at this and I to me it is such a positive reinforcement of who we are and and you know this is not historical word speaking to us but it's a living word and I want to just bounce back through these scriptures here for a minute and uh you know he's declaring that he thanks God on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ and truly I am thankful today for the grace of God it is not as though that we ever intentionally go out and and come short of of the glory of God ever ever you know might say backslide as the prophet put it he said we backslide every day uh and that doesn't mean that we go and fall in the gutter of sin but sometimes little things happen and that keeps us and and certainly tonight we would say thank you Lord for your grace it is it is sustaining power to you and I and verse 5 says that in every everything ye are enriched by him and you know when you think about that enriched it is added to or supplemented or given greater power and so we are truly today been given greater power uh by our relationship with the Lord amen who we might be successful as business or successful in in friendships and all of these things but truly what it is we're looking for the day of our Lord Jesus Christ that is what we're looking to it's not about what we actually have in this life right now there are many a men many a man passed away today that would be considered wealthy but it won't change one thing for them to be enriched by the presence or the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ is making you and I the most powerful individuals on the face of the Earth today amen and that power will not be the kind to rule governments or or to rule uh industry or whatever it might be but that is a power that God has given and Unleashed my brother and sister in the bride of Christ now the prophet of God says we don't have power we have authority but you understand what the word is saying here when you have authority if you speak words and nothing happens you'll realize there's not much power behind the words that were spoken so God's wanting you and I to come to a place that that we rise up in faith that when we would speak and not a Miss but we would speak that we would see God come on the scene and you know it's interesting just uh interacting with different individuals in the last little bit and you know to have someone come back and tell you hey brother Paul I I just have a text on my phone right now a brother in Arizona said brother Paul a friend go we go way back and and he said brother Paul I I have this need and and he he's sharing with me and he says would you pray with me I need God to come on this scene in this situation and you know I just got a text tonight and he said God answers amen so you look at that my brother and sister it might not be one individual's prayer that does it but God looks down and says you know what I'm going to answer this and however God chooses to do that we can't judge and say it was my prayer their prayer that prayer whatever some state of desperation brought it on but however it is but we serve a prayer answering God Amen I say thank you Lord and so you look at this uh as a testimony of Christ was confirmed in you now this word confirm when you go into the older English dictionary some of the newer ones have have kind of different deals but this word confirm means to establish and so as you were there even as a testimony of Christ was verse 6 even as a testimony of Christ was established in you you see my brother and sister it's not like we need some great amount of evidence that's one of the spirits of the age we we need some evidence that God answers prayer we need some evidence that God cares we need evidence that God hears us but what about the evidence that comes down when God established himself in our life lifechanging experience where where we can sit back and I believe every one of us tonight would have a testimony to say I was there at this time and place and God come and made the difference amen CU he's established himself and so it's there that this uh testimony of Christ is confirmed in US established in US and I like this verse 7 because in this my brother and sister this is something this Satan is trying to do in in this day right now uh around the bride he's trying to do that and sometimes it's well-intentioned people that are promoting Satan's agenda and that is if you're not here you're falling behind the bride you're falling behind the word if you don't attend a certain Church you're not under certain Ministry and the devil will come and when people get in a battle one of the first things we do uh is we start to doubt ourself now we've preached this over this pulpit many many times been preached by many ministers that we are the word so see how subtle Satan is that when we start to doubt ourself Satan is working at undermining the word and he tries really hard to undermine the word he can't defeat the word he can't overcome it uh he he can use subterfuge he can kind of twist the words but he cannot overcome it so the next best thing is to get you to doubt self which we have confessed for years that we are the word we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and when you start to doubt that Satan has an inroad amen as they say my brother and sister if you truly want to keep uh the cat out of the chicken Coupe you just put a roof on it but if you want to keep the badger or the raccoon out you got to bury concrete down in the ground because they'll dig a hole 4 feet deep cuz they want to kill the chicken not necessarily even eat the chicken they just want to kill the chicken so Satan will do everything he can do to get into our lives to interfere with our lives over the top underneath through the gate if it's left unlocked amen so it's there we see that God's coming and we are not behind in any single gift we could preach my brother and sister and sometimes it's a verbiage so don't misunderstand but we can preach that the Rapture should have already taken place if God had time the Rapture to have already taken place it would have already taken place so this bride has not fallen out of Step Right In The Vision the prophet of God telling us get back in Step get back in line my brother and sister but he didn't say get back in line or I'm going to leave you amen he was there by the word to correct them and get them back into their proper position aren't you thankful for the Lord amen so he comes we're not going to be behind in no gift we hear uh I'm going to speak just straightforward tonight I hope you don't mind we hear people preaching if you're not speaking in tongues you've missed it if you're not dancing in the spirit you've missed it and then we got the other side where it's like well they're just behaving in the flesh and and it turns that whole battle well my brother and sister even the prophet of God I I kind of like this is a a little bit of an affirmation the prophet of God said now you go down in the South and those people I'm paraphrasing it they're real Lively and they get up and jump and shout and clap and holler and then you go north now this no justification because we're North that we just but my brother and sister see you can't take one blanket and throw it over the whole bride and say everybody ought to worship like this here's the church that is our template well I can assure you my brother and sister uh just I have no evidence but I I can assure you that in the upper room there were some that were just a little bit calmer than the others and some no doubt were maybe even walking on the walls who know but you see we don't want to try to conform ourself to someone else we're supposed to be conformed to Christ and so as we conform oursel to Christ we have right here by scripture amen that this testimony of Christ is confirmed or established in you can someone say say amen and so we're not going to fall behind in the gift as we wait for the coming of the Lord see that's one thing that's killing people is they thought the Rapture was going to take place already so they thought it was actually a Sprint and so we're going to hold it all together and we're going to rush to the Rapture and it's going to be over but God turned it into an endurance race and as an endurance race you have to pace yourself you run faster some sometimes sometimes you run a little slower sometimes you have to stop and take a drink amen sometimes you need to just stop and rest for a moment but you see as time goes on we we are seeing that God is is also in verse eight confirming or establishing you until the end that should give us great joy my brother and sister to know that God's got it in control all the way to the end amen amen and you know I don't know it's kind of a verbiage thing forgive me but the end is not even the Rapture that's right that's right some people are like I just got to make it to the Rapture no my Bible tells me that I'm going to be in the throne with him there's the position we're shooting for that's what we're longing for is to be in the throne with him and so it's there that I better move on we be here a long time so I say as I read this scripture it's such a positive uh reinforcement or influence I look at this and realize you know what I might not be on Pace with with Excuse me to use you for an example Brother David I might not be on Pace with Brother David but I won't be left behind that's right amen that's right or to make myself feel better is it okay if I make myself feel better brother David might not be on Pace with me does it really matter we're not racing each other right and so so that idea should just be pushed away right but we're not going to fall behind if we are the bride of Christ predestinated with that seed in us we're not going to show up a day late for the Rapture we're not going to show up a day late for our healing we're not going to show up a day late for our deliverance now don't take that as an excuse that we can l gag along this bride ought to be on fire she ought to be just ready to please her husband she ought to be just looking to that and Revelations 19 she's making herself ready she's not sitting back Waiting for God to do it she's already got the word now my brother and sister if our Lord Jesus Christ came tonight in our presence would there be anything more he could do for us we have it he's gave it to us the bride is hearing it the bride is believing it and the bride is applying that what was brother brother how did he put that Jerry um oh my I'm going to stumble all over that I shouldn't even have let it entered my mind oh those steps of grabbing it making it your ears oh forgive me uh we'll remember it was and we'll we'll bring that I thought it was very very good amen so when the testimony of Christ is established in you is that temporary the word is eternal the word is in you that means you are Eternal and the results of that word is also Eternal amen sometimes we don't like how the word comes Jesus was pretty blunt imagine they deserve the words he wouldn't have done it otherwise but imagine how they felt to be of you of your father the devil that had to have a sting in it yeah but it was true and just because it stings when you hear it doesn't take away truth that's right and so we have to be careful how we respond whether it's all mushy you know oh makes me just feel so warm and fuzzy if it's not truth it won't get you in a Rapture sometimes the word is warm and fuzzy amen sometimes it's just like pulling a nice blanket around you and just basing in the warmth of it when you realize what Jesus Christ has done for you and I now look at this in Galatians 2:20 and so as we'll see this now these are strong words that is being spoken here to the Galatians but it is so beautiful to me I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live what do you know what I I I think that's very powerful to be able to stand with confidence and say you know what I'm crucified with Christ could we lift a hand with that and say I am crucified with Christ but to turn around and give the proper this is where the establishing of the the word comes the proper deal yet not I but Christ in me in other words the only way that I can live is the fact that Christ is in me amen we can talk about faith we can talk about all kinds of things and apply it from many different ways but my brother and sister sometimes faith is just merely the expression of the word of God the Life of Christ in you and I and he put it there and it is I'm ahead of myself but it is a gift amen it's not something we could do of ourself he did it for us and he's producing the very life that we get to rejoice in he's producing it amen nevertheless so one that's crucified says nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh y you see sometimes we got to stop and realize that he never did away with our flesh our flesh is still here and if we're not careful we always talk about the flesh is negative and we got to kill it but what about this scripture right here that we get to live with Christ in us we get to live in this flesh what a glorious gift God has given you and I to be able to live a Godly life with a very word of God illuminated out of Us coming out of us it's visible to the world around us and we get to live this out in the flesh now how could we live as example to somebody if we were some kind of perfect statue of something you see sometimes it's a Humanity yeah it's just the humanity that testifies that you're different yeah you know not moving into the neighborhood and running around to every house in the neighborhood and telling them praise God I got the truth and you're going to hell now that's not going to do it but I'll tell you what you do when you send your 12-year-old boy over and he mows the elderly lady's lawn and she wants to pay him and he just tells her uh no thank you I just wanted to do this for you and God bless you pretty soon the little old lady said says those people are different pretty soon she's defending that family to the neighborhood pretty soon she wants to know why they're different and no one had to force the issue see sometimes God just wants it to live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me see Faith just slips in and becomes an integral part of Who We Are I would ask you today to just describe me this evening just describe to me what faith was to you today did we raise anybody from the dead did we do the whole list I don't want to go through all of it did that happen no but you lived in this flesh and lived testimony of Jesus Christ what a beautiful thing that God has given us it doesn't seem super natural but you just remove that gift of faith from us and we'll see just how Supernatural that is because it is truly Supernatural amen now my brother and sister this integral part of who we are we know we're Sons and Daughters of God there's no need to be boastful about it but there's no need to be uh you might say cowardly about it uh taken back of the fact of who we are that God called us to be that doesn't mean we're perfect but it means we have identification you know I was thinking about it as we were getting on an airplane and um uh on the way home a really nice lady there at the at the security and I was fumbling around with a backpack and my wallet in my hand and my driver's license and all this stuff and I finally kind of got it out and handed it to her and she said you know even upside down I could see it was you well of course there's a picture there's only so many ways you can dress up a mug but my brother and sister that's really how we are in this world upside down backwards things not necessarily perfectly in order and they still see it's you isn't this to me it's just wondrous I I I just how glorious it is cu I'm not I'm not promoting that we don't but my brother and sister we spend our whole life trying to work on presenting a certain kind of image to the world and God says I want you to live with me in you in the flesh in this world I'll do the rest we have to be willing we have to be ready just to live in the flesh and let Christ live in us and as he lives in us he uses example after example how that God would work and do the work and show his work and let his work be lived out now we've heard the quote and I almost included the whole quote here tonight but I I just chose to paraphrase it when the bride recognizes who she is brother Brown goes on to say she becomes an invincible Army so we're holding on to this time that we recognize who we are that we'll become this invincible Army me and I'm here to tell you you've already arrived amen I'm here to tell you that God's already doing that work because you'd say how how would you say that brother Paul we're still making mistakes he didn't say when you never make another mistake you become an invincible Army but what he's telling us is the moment that we not verbally not just with words saying I am the bride of Christ anyone can say I am the bride of Christ but it's when that life is established and when that life being established comes and we start to recognize this is something more than me just saying I'm the bride of Christ this is something that's living that is taking me through the really good times you might say in the natural and through the really hard times from The Valleys to the Mountaintop God's there with us and we might feel like quitting you know I I sometimes joke with Jerry it's it's more just humor but you know I teller I I think I'm done I think I'm going to quit I think I'm going to quit and then you know 30 minutes later I need to do this this this and I want to do this and I'm praying about this you see it's not in us it's not in us this is part of the establishment of the word in US is to face a reality this invincible Army just simply can't quit and that in itself is an incredible Revelation my brother and sister in a day that all these demons are trying to crush you and I there is this point that we come and think I can't go any further and God says you've just started get back in line get back in step and we start to realize yes I can do it I can do it because Christ is in me amen amen now as we look at that see this is not intellectual recognition no it is not we can look at the deal and say I see in the scripture Malachi 4 I I can see that I I can see that that God sent a prophet and the things that were prophesied now my brother and sister we're students of the message as you look in the message and you look carefully there is just one little I'm going to use the word tidbit and I don't say that to to take any value away from it but things the prophet said all these little tidbits they're falling in place absolutely they're coming together now remember the prophet talking about that man that you know had an accent and and is talking about nuts and bolts and whatever my brother and sister you know what all the tidbits are coming together for the word to be fulfilled amen and you and I are included in those tidbits that God is placing and we'll look at this that's happening do you understand things you know like like they just cut off the gas passing through Ukraine uh to the EU and and uh upset Russia very much so because it adds up to billions of dollars and so my brother and sister you'll say oh that was just politics but what we're seeing is every little tidbit put in its press right correct place and as these things are coming you say well okay that's just World politics no my brother and sister you know they actually tied directly to you yeah that's right because as that's being fulfilled that actually operates on the time piece of the Bride the bride's not operating on its time piece it's operating on our time piece and as the bride's coming ready Amen to going home I think sometimes I might just replace Rapture with going home home means it's someplace you've been before amen not just a change and we're going to have a change in fact tonight we're changing amen but we're going home we're going back where we belong it's a place that we have a right you might say we have ownership we have establishment and God's taking us there see so it it's not just the fact that we recognize who we are my brother and sister the recognition of who we are is the word manifesting in us that's right we can say I believe the message I believe the message but if the message is not in us and not evident then we have to wonder do they believe and yet I'm not going to say they don't believe but my brother and sister they are progressing and we need to pray for them that might include all of us we could look right and left and look behind us or we could just be bold and say pray for me pray for me there's still things in my life I don't like amen things that have been there from years ago and years ago didn't bother me at all but right now I start to be bothered by these things what is that God bringing you into the fullness establishing you confirming himself in us hallelujah but you know here again I want to bring this up just just have another note here amen part of this recognizing who she is and Satan not able to defeat her is because she recognizes that she can't become behind in any gift that's what the word said that's right you know there's two ways to look at that we can run with fear we can run with confidence that's right and yet the scripture tells us we should should be fearful lest we would be left behind but then the word says can't lose a one wow is this confusing no it isn't it's concrete anchored solid in the rock that God reminds you and I through the preaching of the word that there's a position God's called you to quit goofing off quit Dilly dallying get into your position and stand there with confidence of who you are in Jesus Christ and know that if you are standing in your place in the word that one you can't be left behind and two Satan cannot get you amen amen we're humans we're humans now in the quote faith is a substance and it's not there brother Alex it's actually um well in anyway it's not there I I'm I'm cherry-picking this little spot and uh faith is the substance 412 of 47 and uh I just pulled this out of the quote right there be easy to find if you need to Faith is a gift of itself you may have a portion of it but there is a gift of faith yes there is now that portion in the natural would be that we behave in such fashion that we will all tonight walk walk out take the key put it in the ignition of our car and we expect it to start when we turn the key we don't go out there well we shouldn't be driving a car that we go out there and it's like yeah I knew it no we have faith that is just in the human element that that we expect you know I always I always pray anyway trust me I always pray anyway but you know you're you have more risk of dying within 50 miles of your house in an automobile than you do flying in an airplane and when that airplane turns at the end of the runway just had this happens Monday night when the plane turns on the end of that Runway I'm like Lord please protect me and take me home safe amen it's just something about that you know you got a few hundred th000 pounds with a couple basically rockets on the wings and we're rolling down the runway and you're thinking man we not going very fast and next thing you know you're flying see so there's that Faith that's there and if we could simplify our faith in God as it comes down our faith in these things in the natural I think it would actually change our lives I think most people would actually find a greater Revelation in their life if they could just take and trust God like they trust an airplane I don't know if Sister Jerry heard that but up in front of us there was somebody saying this makes me nervous and some guy quoted that to him Well ma'am you're safer in this airplane then you will be driving home from the airport in boisee that probably made her more nervous you know but the truth of it is my brother and sister we're safer in the presence of almighty God than we will be in any other place in our life amen you might might be flying you might be driving on Ice you might be doing whatever it is you are still safer in the presence of God than you are in anything this world can offer I'd like to go here there's another quote that I didn't put in there sorry about that improving his word 8664 brother brandham says here this is a little longer quote now there is also an old proverb that says prove it and I'll believe it now they got one of our one of our states in the nation they have a slogan I'm from Missouri show me see in other words prove it to me I'm from Missouri well you know that would have to apply to just about everywhere Missouri maybe got a bad slap over that one but my brother and sister it was theirs amen but this doesn't work always because God had in every age fulfilled and prove the work that he has set out for that age he spoke it in his word can we say Amen to that we're not here surmising tonight we're we're not hoping that that this is all going to work out and this is the right message sister Jerry and I was just visiting just just chatting away and and you know she she made I'm not embarrassing her I I promise you I'm not because it's something that's relevant to all of us some little thing that the devil wants to anoint to bring it down and it's like if this message is absolutely the truth why is there so much trouble around it well all you have to do is stop and study you know patents are really the devil's idea you get something and you do everything you can to protect it I want to ask you tonight do you need to protect the word of God Amen but we try we try to protect our idea well this is how I see the message this is how I see the message this is how I see being a Christian this is what I think Holiness is this is what I my brother and sister that's not what God called us to do he called us to say look I if God is a holy God and he wants Holiness in his presence then Lord reveal Holiness to me I don't need it proved I don't need some big deal God will bring it and bring it alive he'll unfold it and we'll be able to take that and it will take then a place in our life and next thing you know you will have become Holiness or we could pound on everybody got to be holy got to be holy and that would be maybe like a trip to Mishiwaka as long as I look holy everything will be fine one was trying to look it one was living it one was trying to have it confirmed in their life the other one it was confirmed God help us my brother and sister this is not for us to argue over or to press or push or do whatever amen now look at this here let me hurry on uh and every time that God's word has been proven in the age the majority has turned it down so prove it and I'll believe it is not so you can only have faith as God gives you faith faith is a gift of God ever how religious you may be yet it must take it you must have faith and your faith can only rest this is a little bit of where the my my thought or title comes from and your faith can only rest if you're a Christian upon the proven word of God so it takes Faith to bring us to a place that the word is being proven in US amen and if you got a proven word and we are in the word my brother and sister what do we have to fear what do we have to fear each day as we go out to live our life what do we have to fear the prophet of God says that God is obligated to correct you if you're wrong now here's the catch we are obligated to receive the correction when God shows it to us cuz if we refuse to receive the correction God's no longer obligated amen but God help us that we can be tender and soft you know almost like hearing someone boast you know I've been a a Christian for so long I'm just hardened to everything that's nothing to boast about should be I've been a Christian for however many years and I'm just turning into a giant puddle of of putty so to speak and when God takes a hold of me puts me on the wheel and it starts to spin I'm not there saying no I'm there saying Lord thy will be done help us Lord now I just make this as reference Hebrews 11 veres 1 through3 and now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear jumping to verse 40 God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect now my brother and sister we could sit here and people will argue with you you're saying I was witnessing to a lady one day she got angry I mean I thought she was going to hit me because I was laying out the word and I said so we're here in this age with more Revelation more truth and everything then the previous age before us and she said you're saying that my parents didn't and boy she just went off like a Roman Candle my brother and sister I can't help what God has chose to do amen we don't want to go back you know there were saints that that that history shows us there were saints that went into the Coliseum and the Lions wouldn't eat them is that what we want to go do it's not what we were called to do we can't go back and live their day yeah so as it is God's provided something better for us that they should be made perfect now can we recognize I believe we are tonight we're we're we're well versed as message Believers recognize what the better is revelation has come down open the Mysteries yeah you see back in them days they did not understand things that we actually unfortunately take for granted yeah right isn't it terrible to take something for granted when it's truly actually a great mystery of God that's been revealed to us we should be holding on to that thank you Lord for this diamond of the word that you have given me amen we have the open word that's right I mean that that's become such a common phrase people just throw it out open word but I tell you what my brother and sister when the open word is present in the life of a Believer they recognize they've been given a great gift yes they recognize that it's not something we publish and say we've got more we've got more we've got more but I tell you what it is when it starts to live out it's the word proving itself in us right oh my right how beautiful now this will come out wrong and I'll just say it anyway but if you will do a comprehensive study of everything that's considered to be uh a a Holiness as far as religion in the world today there's a steady decline oh yeah in what is Holiness what they brand Holiness wouldn't pass the test of their forefathers yeah but as long as everybody's status quo then it doesn't have to pass the test of the forefathers but there is a test that it must pass and this is why the prophet of God puts so strongly to you and I that you've got to stay with the word because that's the only test it has to pass yeah right you talked to some Old-Timers and they'll tell you these are good Holy Ghost filled people not not not living in past age that what is represented as the bride of Christ is actually behaving acting dressing walking talking confessing more so the word right now than those that used to come to the Tabernacle some ways that sounds stunning what do you mean the prophet was there but that was a message in its infancy that's right this is a message in its maturity that's right and the word is now leading and guiding it's no longer men it's no longer a Creed or a Doctrine it is a relationship it's a life that's drawing people men and women uh young people drawing them into a closer position with the Lord amen I would say that God is proving his word today amen I believe it's alive yes yes sir amen there again it would be that we'd have to place a value on what it is to be a recipient of Revelation just because we attend a message Church gives us no guarantee of Revelation but when God is working it doesn't matter people this is also stuns me and I'll just voice it out when people are afraid for our young people that they're going to get drawn and sucked into the world and they're afraid of that my brother and sister they're expressing no confidence in the word being fulfilled God promised there would be a generation rising up in the day of the coming of the Lord amen does that mean we just quit and sit back no we do homework we do what God called us to do but my brother and sister fear of that is something that should not be in our hearts we should actually have confidence and back our confidence up with prayer amen and sharing of the word and testimony because this bride has the same seed whether they're six I'm just picking an age or 60 that seed the same seed it's not a it's not a New Generation seed amen and you might say it's as old as the heavens and God chose this day to place it and bring it and manifest it yes sir okay I want to just hurry up and close right here in the message the sermon it is the rising of the sun beautiful sermon and so it is today we don't try to be some big person you know I'll just tell you every time I thought I might just try to be some big person all it did is shine a light and show me just how little I really was you know you get an opportunity to preach somewhere and you're like wow this is like a sea of people out here that's and then some natural spiritual however you want to put it comes on you and you stutter and spit and sputter the whole service yeah so much for my abilities yeah so much for who I am and then God comes in spite of that and moves just reminder don't you like it when you get a reminder a friendly a friendly reminder that God is so kind to remind us without me you are nothing we don't care what people say about us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life is it's nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there is only one thing that we love to do is to see him glorified amen and how can it be when he's glorified in Us by his resurrection that's in us we see him represented again as he was that's right today amen yes wow God would love us so much going back to earlier in the service this flesh this flesh gets to be a Dwelling Place of the Lord God Almighty Elohim amen we could go down through all the Redemptive names all the glorified names and God said I'm going to let that dwell in you oh nothing to boast about but it's not nothing to be ashamed of Amen he's glorified in Us by his resurrection that's in we see him represented again as he was today did you get that see our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not to boost some church or make more in the Sunday school or try to bring in hog tie push in offer a picnic party or bring Stars buttons or something else like that oh man I tell you I'll just share a little something real quick to you I just ask a young lady here a couple days ago what their Church does on a Sunday evening for their young people they watched a movie and then they took line dance lessons H anybody interested no because that's not who we are that's right and I don't say that boastfully and I don't say that derogatory to them but that's not what we are our desire is to see him glorified glorified what not with self- pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us if I can get myself out of the way can we just stop there for a second please don't read ahead could we lift a hand tonight and say if I could just get myself out of the way I get myself out of the way and and this would just go so much better now I want to I'm not making no emphasis I think a guy could build a Doctrine off this quote though so when William brandham is not even thought of amen amen you follow me we could start a deal nope nothing about William brandom any longer but we'd be wrong but he's saying when William Brown's not even thought of and oh just ruined my theory oh and you not even thought of till we can see Jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire can we say Amen tonight that is our desire is to not see you not see someone else not see this great Minister not to see this the prophet of God didn't want it to be about him he even declared I never did this to draw people to me that's right Amen to be lifted up to draw people to me and my brother and sisters see this right here is corrective that's right this is not just a directive quote this is a corrective quote amen he's not saying get your eyes off of me and get them back on Christ he's also pointing into this to say here is what is going to make the difference for you that's right see him that's our desire that's the gives us the quickening power and it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the Bride of him and seeing his same Vindicated methods proving that's right can we say the next word in in that's not just a book my brother and sister that's not a tablet that's not a tape it's got to be in US amen eat the book amen eat the book seeing the same vindictive methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead right where's the proof of the resurrection right here tonight that's right amen sister Ruth will you come amen hallelujah I don't know Saints I hope that it came out that way but this just makes me happy makes me happy realize that that as we move forward God has says you know what some of these vessels to honor some to dishonor you might not even be able to really tell a lot of difference right so close to deceive the very elect yeah I mean some of these vessels are in humaniz perfect but which one does God choose to fill that's what matters it's not what you and I see of the vessel but it's whether God will fill it or not and God has come can someone lift a hand and say God has filled me amen I have evidence that God has filled me and will fill me again hallelujah hallelujah Amen brother Isaac my throat's got a little bit of oh I guess I have one more quote I almost missed that one I'll just jump ahead I'll skip the writing in between here amen his Word of Promise reflected him in her that's right it wasn't what I did wasn't what you did it was his Word of Promise that did the reflecting that's it they had to take notice to Peter and them they hadn't been to a seminary they know that they hadn't been to any Bible School some Theological Seminary they had no education CU they couldn't even write their own name the Bible said they were ignorant and unlearned but what happened they had to take note that they had been with Jesus amen oh Lord let that be let that be something that the world would see and take note that we've been with Jesus amen for there he was with them reflecting his promise Hallelujah glory to God that's what we need in this age his word reflected him and her the church she was alive by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God Amen let's just stand sing a couple songs here amen you know the prophet of God said that we should be able to say Amen to every word of God that amen shouldn't just be for someone to hear us but that amen should be something a praise a worship a love expressed from us that's right not to the world out here but our soul your soul my soul speaking out to Christ himself right in other words you might not hear out loud amen but the heart the soul is saying amen I believe that it's the truth hallelujah hallelujah amen I don't think I can sing this one song I had wrote down here 17 three brother Alex amen let's just take a moment Amen in everything give him thanks in every everything give him thanks oh in the Good Time Lord I'll praise your name in The Bad Times oh do the same in everything give the King of Kings all the thanks sing it again oh in everything give him thanks everything give him thanks in the good time praise His name in the the bad times do the same in everything give the King of Kings all the thanks amen amen I want to sing that song that you were playing there all I want to see is Jesus [Music] this your desire tonight amen just every day more of you Lord God more of you I was thinking so brother Paul was talking there you know sometimes sometimes we do things in life you say something to somebody whatever and it convicts you but you know God is so gracious you go back and you go try to make that right somebody that's maybe not a Believer and they say I don't know what you're talking about he erased it from their mind so wonderful when you think about that and how he he got her back amen hallelujah let's start with A Chorus here oh I want to see Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see Jesus shining through me I know the time is near where everything that I hold beer will lay before the holy consuming fire all my works and all my deeds and every prayer set on my knees will lay before the holy consuming fire all I want to see is Jesus

and hear him say Well done my preious one well done well done my faithful one now all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus shining through me amen amen couldn't help but think of one more song as we get ready to dismiss here but I feel like I sing this song too much but I just love this song but yet not I but Christ in me yes amen just love the love
