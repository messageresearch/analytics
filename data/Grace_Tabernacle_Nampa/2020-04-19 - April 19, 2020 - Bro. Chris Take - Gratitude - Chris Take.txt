Bibles you want to stand where you are we're gonna turn into uh Colossians chapter 2 I apologize I just realized I didn't send over my quotes this morning so I'm very with me if you don't believe me you can look it up on your phone and follow along Colossians 2 verse 6 as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up and fit in him and established in the faith as he had been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving amen then chapter 3 same book in verse 15 and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with the grace in their hearts to the Lord and so that whatsoever you do in word or deed to do all the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him Amen spire heads only father Lord Jesus we so grateful this morning father to common and hear from You Lord Jesus and father I ask that you would just meet each heart Lord father you know the needs and in the midst oh Jesus different I request this morning father you can let me speak life into those situations father father we ask that you just come Lord take these words father you've laid on my heart Lord Jesus and tie them up in me with your words or Jesus father there would not be my own Lord that I would move out of the way father the Lord we would go away this morning saying that we had the opportunity to hear from you Lord Jesus and follow you pray your blessings upon the word Lord and all these things we ask it in your perfect will on Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you can be seated amen you know as I was studying along I came across across this quote it doesn't go exactly with what we have but I thought I'd just kind of say this and then we can get into the sermon this morning but the Brenham says in here ye him 1956 he says our characters should have us up into a place where we can be in an office to meet the crisis of this hour that we're in what a shame we are but will God answer in a time of crisis he will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of crisis if the people are simple together in a matter of two or three whatever it is and pray there he said he would from heaven amen I believe this fits our situation were gathered together in in pieces and in small units but still were gathered together underneath his name all in one Accord and God can come down and speak to you man it's my first chance to minister since we've been quarantined and it can be hard to stay focused at home when you're streaming but God is gracious and if you ask him to help if you ask him to assist you aim and he can do it and he can give you the grace to have church in at home just you know the Lord has always come down no matter you know maybe the beginning you know then things get settled and God's always coming and spoken to us and so we've been thankful for that our pastor was preaching here a couple weeks ago and I I had they would do a little run around the living room to get it out and then it startled my wife and the kids and I said I'm sorry I just had to get it out of me so not here to boast of myself but to testify that doesn't matter where you are God can meet you there praise the Lord so this morning we're going to be speaking on gratitude and being thankful he meant so my title this morning is gratitude amen and the Bible says that and the scriptures that we read here I was gloss back over them it says in Colossians 2 7 it says again rooted and built up in him and established in faith as you have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving I mean I looked up the word rooted in the scripture it only appears a few times most of it in the context of rooting out the devil but there was a few places where it says we're rooted in Christ and the Paul says here that we want to be rooted and built up in Christ and established in the faith as you've been taught but doing all that and abounding in Thanksgiving and I think this morning we we want to say sometimes we become too much to a place where always say we ask and and and we request in me and me I mean we always say is I I need I need I need I need I need when we pray and we forget sometimes to just spend some time saying thank you Lord and a Harvard Medical School that their paper and they Reese on research of gratitude they took a few different researches and put them together and they said to psychologists this is a just a couple of paragraphs so bear with me - psychologist dr. Robert a Eamon's of the University of California Davis and dr. Michael e McCool Oh of the University of Miami have done much of the research on gratitude in one study they asked all participants to write a few sentences each week focusing on particular topics one group wrote about things they were grateful for that had occurred during the week a second group wrote about daily irritations or things that had displeased them and the third wrote about events that had affected them with no emphasis on them being positive or negative for 10 weeks those who wrote about gratitude were more optimistic and felt better about their lives surprisingly they also exercised more and had fewer visits to physicians than those who focused on sources of aggravation another leading researcher in this field dr. Martin EP Seligman a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania tested the impact of various positive psychology interventions on 411 people each compared with the control assignment of writing about early memories so they had to write about four and eleven people write about early memories when their week's assignments was to write and personally deliver a letter of gratitude to someone who never been properly thanked for his or her kindness participants immediately exhibited a huge increase in happiness scores this impact was greater than that from any other intervention with with benefits lasting for a month so that being said grads U has benefits on the natural side they could write those papers off in the planar English but I just wanted to bring that in that and it's been studies have shown that being thankful and having gratitude actually increases your overall health and in natural always types of spiritual and vice-versa and so we know that in our spiritual health amen we could be thankful we can show gratitude amen our spiritual health will begin to increase and we'll be in a better state of mind amen in Philippians of 4 verse 6 you can you can jump there if you want says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God amen so you have your quests and you have needs you you give up to God but when you do that you do it with Thanksgiving you do it with the thankful heart and praise the Lord amen and there was one part here in this in this paper I read that it's that one group you know hey write down what aggravates you and write down what what negative things you think of and sometimes when we go to prayer may go to speak to the Lord we go and we say you know this is bothering me and that's bothering me and I'm tired of this and can we change this and can this be fixing what we're doing is and we read here in the in Philippians 4:6 so there's a balance in making your request but what we can find ourselves doing sometimes it's just focusing on what's wrong focusing on what's aggravating us focus on what's wrong with the world and we lose our focus even in prayer we lose our focus or what it should be that is on that Christ is the waymaker and that Christ can move on these things and so we begin to chain we can begin to change the way we pray for something and so maybe we have a need in our lives and of healing in our body and instead of saying instead of praying over and over and over again Lord heal me Lord heal me start saying Lord thank you for healing me Lord by I hurt myself today thank you for healing me Lord I have this this job interview thank you for being with me thank you for giving me the right words to say because we have the ability to speak things into existence underneath underneath the anointing of Christ and so we say you know brother man said if you have a need of a healing in your body he says begin to testify and begin to confess that healing he said and imagine that body in front of you and stepped step into that perfect body but if all you do is say you know think about the sick body and not think about the healing body all you're gonna do is bring yourself down so we don't want to get caught up and when and I need this and I need that we want to pray with gratitude amen 1st Thessalonians 5 verse 16 says rejoice evermore pray without ceasing and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you you say Chris or the Chris what is the will of God for my life be thankful you always have something to be thankful and that's easier to say when everything is going well but it's the truth even in the darkest times you always have something to be thankful for you can always find gratitude around you and when you begin to pray in this way and there was a there was a great man of God and I can't remember his name right now it slips him but he had an orphanage in in England and he never once asked for donations he never once asked for food but God he always prayed they would sit down to a meal and he would say thank you Lord for the bread and the milk for breakfast there'd be a knock on the door and the milkman was there and he said hey my car broke down I have all this milk I can't do anything with do you want it sure we'll take it so they're going to sit down and a few minutes later there's another knock on the door and it's the bread man and he says I have all these extra loaves of bread and they're gonna go bad would you like them and so God provided an end up I wish I would have taken the time to pull down the statistics but um he said he would record every prayer he prayed on one side of the page he would write the what he prayed for on the other side the page he would write down when it was answered and he had over like a million recorded answered prayers or something like it was a big number and he said they asked him you know say well what what about how do you pray you know how's a what's your recommendations on how to pray better and he said or maybe he was just commenting about him how he prays but he said he takes this portion of Scripture and against the to pray about that say Lord I read here in your word that you in Philippians 34:13 assist I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and I know God that you are the creator of all things and you created me and you created the world around me and you knew before the foundation of the world he said you begin to express what God is capable of he says you'll find yourself on your knees for a lot longer he says you've because what happens and what what happens when you do that is you begin to express now worship we have a misunderstanding of prayer and that is that no prayer is to ask God for things but you can pray and never once asked God for things and you can just pray and worship and you say you began you do just as he said you know I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and as you worship God you're praying to God you're worshipping what are you doing you're expressing gratitude to your Creator and as you express that gratitude you get up and you don't have to pray for your depression you don't have to pray for your and anxiety you have to pray for a peace because in that moment Amen you found freedom from those things and you step up a happier person you step up with a victory over depression you've stacked up step up with peace in your heart over anxiety because why you express gratitude for Christ and when you express gratitude and you praise him my Paul and Silas did in the jail you begin to worship Him and when you begin to worship Him what happens in Christ comes near God comes near because you're worshiping and you're talking about him and he loves to come around you when you're talking about him and so then he comes near and what happens where the weather does the Bible says where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and so as you express your gratitude toward Christ as you worship him as you bee step into his presence and now guess what you have the ability to have freedom and it doesn't matter freedom they said the Bible says does not the Bible doesn't say you will have in the spirit where the Spirit of the Lord is there's Liberty from sickness no it says there is Liberty it doesn't matter what it is amen God can give you freedom from the simplest of things it could be it could be a stressful day and you just step aside except in the corner say and you begin to say instead of say God I'm stressed out help me not to be stressed you say God you're great and psalms it says it says they that I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil Lord you're always with us and Lord your word says that in the same in the same chapter you know I lay me down by her besides he really leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake and it talks about the being beside the still waters and and for me I've always been a big reader and there's been times where or in my imagination you can just really picture things it really helped when I was in construction I could just envision every step of the process and so with reading I just I just see everything that I read there's been times as that when I've been reading a book and I've been like tired I'm just gonna set this down and when I set the book down I expect what I'm seeing in my head to continue and then I realize now I have to keep reading to keep seeing seeing it what I'm visiting and so when I read Psalm 23 I just see this is the beautiful lush green meadow and the nice still moving water the water can't be moving too fast or sheeps are will scare away and they won't get any water so it has to be still and so you just see this this this picture of serenity this picture of peace and and you begin to express you know to God hey you know I your word says you give us you give us peace and Lord I know that you are peace and I live with lit live into your presence and and then you begin to just worship God and next thing you know you're not stressed anymore and you're happy about it and you're in your things are going along well again amen for his Lord and that scripture is in 2nd Corinthians 3:17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen and it pleases the Lord when we testify of his goodness because when you when you when you um witnessing to something to somebody brother Branham says you know tell them how your candle got lit and there's many different reasons for that but when when you're testifying to somebody and you're witnessing to somebody and you're just spewing doctrine or spilling your ideas you sound no different than anybody else but when you tell your testimony you're testifying of God's goodness gratitude worship what happens God's Spirit comes down and that anointing is what affects that individual that you're witnessing to so when you go up and use you can tell them about you know the seals and everything and you can blow their minds and and but when you testify you're testifying of Christ and God loves to be talked about so he comes near amen and his presence comes down and that's either gonna open that person you're witnessing to up or they're gonna say hey I'm good thanks I'll walk away and walk away and go about their day but if you don't have that anointing and then all you end up doing is debating with them but the Lord loves when we testify of his goodness and I think this this is just right on time for where we live right now because we can get so caught up with with reading the news and reading about the cove in 19 and reading about how the world is is falling apart and the economy this and and then Trump said that and but the the but Nancy Pelosi said this and and you know Facebook said this and and then you know this news article said this and CNN said no it's like this and Fox said no it's like this and you can just get caught in the middle and get so stressed out and then then all you thinking about that stuff and so it's important and this is proven that in in crisis you just so tore up but if you just begin to be grateful for anything you'll find yourself feeling better get out of theirs to get outside say you know I'm grateful for the sunshine I'm grateful you know thank you Lord for the trees and the leaves and and the green grass so I can say now because I live here I've been really enjoying the green grass excuse me hand uh and and you'll find you'll have victory over those negative thoughts because because what what happened believed us and this is this is true for it for everyone but the way you think your thought pattern can determine your attitude and your attitude can actually make you physically ill now if your thoughts are all about the world's coming to an end now and we want that to happen but in a negative way you're not you're not thinking the world's coming to in and a happy way you're thinking the world's ending in a bad way and the thoughts are on the chaos now your attitude that's what you're thinking about your attitude begins to express that you're you you're irritable you're easily frustrated I guess those are the same things you're paranoid right now what begins to develop in your spiritual ease anxiety you're anxious and you're nervous now those are proven to cause stomach ulcers those are proven to cause other sicknesses as well heart diseases and everything there brother Manuel Salazar he passes a church in New Mexico he preached his sermon about that one time and he brought out all the the research and it was it was probably phenomenal that stress is directly related to causing stomach ulcers which is kind of a well-known one but there's it could actually cause heart diseases and then what does that what does that do that causes you know now there's a division sure you're not smoking cigarettes you're not sinning but now there's a division because between you and God because now all you can do is worry about what's going on around you and now when you go to pray all you can you close your eyes in me you make everything still around you you find a nice quiet place to pray now all you can think of is is the crisis around you and it's causing division in your prayer which is causing division in your relationship with Christ but I'm here to tell you this morning that there's an easy way out of that just start to say thank you Lord listen I wrote this down if there's if there's nothing you can find around you to be thankful for which is really hard there's nothing you can find thankful around you you can be thankful you're saved no matter what you're going through there's always one thing you can be thankful for there's nothing else give me thankful that God has called you his own and just begin to think upon that the Bible says in that's in Philippians here actually I think praise the Lord I'm sitting in it some of you can quote it but so what so ever you know what think on these things that's Scripture somebody know where it is anyways but Paul says Paul says you know think about think about um all right here yeah chapter four verse Philippians 4 verse 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest I'm gonna tell you here this morning half 80% of the what the media tells you an even Fox is false so what sort of things are true think on these things whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things and I believe Paul here was speaking from experience you know maybe he had just wrote to the Philippians after you know being released from prison with Paul in sight with with Silas and he says hey this stuff works man it's I've tried it it does wonders but when you begin to think on these things your thoughts are so powerful your thoughts are so powerful because they set a pattern for your attitude and there's an old eight an age-old saying that says you cannot change the circumstances around you but you can't or you can't tailor-make your situations around you but you can tailor make your attitude toward those situations and brother Branham says the right attitude towards any promise of God brings that promise to pass and so you have something in your life that you need that you need met don't sit there and read the doctors reports instead begin to think upon the goodness of God begin to think upon what God can do and how God can heal you and those thoughts will begin to create a positive effect physically on your body amen if we can look out and we can see that the crazy view of this world expressing what's inside of them physically and you can sigit the believers around you that are expressing what's inside them physically through dressing pure and and speak speaking pure and acting pure amen you could have the same effect on your body if you could just begin to think about and focus on the promises of God for your life brother Branham tells a little story here in 1955 the water of separation it's kind of a lengthy quote but it's one of those ones you just can't cut it up or excuse me not cut it out split it apart we don't cut it up and patch our own in ok anyways he says it old not long ago doubt in the South before the proclamation was signed for the independence or the freedom of the slaves one lap there was a little old place where he was playing the organ and having a glorious time in the service where they met together to worship the Lord excuse me while he was in worship the Lord saved him hey there you go well he was in worship the Lord saved him and the next day back on the old plantation he was telling all the slaves that morning when they gathered out about Christ had set him free so what happened to be that the owner of these slaves come by after they come up from their cabin to get ready to go to work he said Sam what was that I heard you saying to those fellows when I come up that she was free he said yes sir boss he said the Lord Jesus has made me free said why don't you come over to my office after a while so he went over to the office and he said alright boss he said repeat that again he said well he said last night in a meeting the Lord Jesus made me free from the bondage of sin and and said he's cut me free and I'm free now I don't have to sin no more because the Lord Jesus forgive me and set me free he said Sam if you really mean that with all your hearts that I'll go down today and sign the proclamation that you were free from me to to go preach the gospel to your people so he said well boss I mean it with all my heart that he set me free from the bondage of sin he said well I set you free as a slave to preach the gospel to your brethren Amen God loves to hear you testify of him and here is this man testifying of what God had done for him and God went ahead and pricked the ear of his slave owner of the of the Mane's of the man's boss pricked his ear and he says hey what was that you were saying and if the man had never been testifying of his freedom spiritually God would have never give him him for this him that in that moment his freedom physically and when you begin to testify of God testify that your freedom spiritually amen that freedom that testifying garb against us says to set your physical party free free from sickness free from anxiety free from depression free from nervousness free from complexes free from from pride Amen and all these things God begins to do because why he says hey man I love hearing him testify I'm gonna go ahead and give him freedom on the outside and then I hope to what happens when God is an inward work in your life amen you start to testify about it your body obeys that confession next thing you know you've dropped the cigarettes excuse me you've dropped the cussing and you've dropped the hanging out with the bad people why because your body came under composition to your confession amen praise the Lord in Acts chapter 16 verse 25 excuse me I'm having a hard time with my throat chapter 16 verse 25 says and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sing praises unto God and the prisoners heard him as suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundation of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed so here's Paul and Silas there was this woman following them that was you know saying hey these are these are men of God these are men of God and they turned around and Paul said I rebuke you devil come out of her and that girl was set free from this demon and her owner who was making money off of her grabs Paul this Allison and says hey everybody you know and they get a riot going and throwed Paul Silas in prison and a parlous in Silas and then they've been beat up now they're chained to all have you ever been chained to a wall I can guarantee you can bet money on it you'll be chained to a wall and so here they're chained physically change to a wall some of you may have been beat up so I won't go there but here they are that you would say you say what in the world do Paul and Silas have to be thankful for you say brother Chris you're adding to the word the board doesn't say they were thankful you have to be thankful to start to praise God you can't be thankful and you can't there's no way you can you can sing a song but that is not praise praise is when you are thankful that God does it's done something for let's do you say well well pastor I sing every morning I've seen I sing every Sunday morning and Wednesday what more do you want from me we don't want you to sing we want you to praise we want you to worship God there's a big difference in the scriptures and so here's Paul and Silas and they're they're sitting there and I would love to see cuz you and let me tell you something right here I'm gonna speak some blasphemy these two guys were men just like you and me when they first were in there I'm gonna go and take a Liberty they were not happy have you ever been punched in the face and been happy about it I haven't I've been kicked in the face I've never been punched in the face but I wasn't happy about it I chipped a tooth but here's Paul and Silas they're sitting there and they're probably work you know they had like brother Jewell says there was he was he was said and they were like my goodness Paul Silas cuz Paul had selected Silas to come with him Sciences like Paul what have you got me into says no but I signed up for maybe they were complaining we don't know what we're gonna say they were and and something one of them they know maybe because you kind of rant for a little bit and the conversation kind of dies off right and just sit there and they were sitting there quietly Paul says you know what we could be then we maybe we couldn't no we could be sitting you're not annoying Christ we could actually be prisoners for a crime and said we're we're prisoners for Christ and that's involved is that yes a good message ship write that one down for later um cuz Paul preached about being a prisoner for cookies anyways and that's always say you know it so they started maybe they started with their salvation so yeah you know oh we were saved Wow praise God you know man remember when we were Jews and we didn't we got no idea what any of this was and and we had the the Torah and and you know we were we were looking for a messiah but but he had already come and gone and and Paul man you used to be you probably Paul you used to put people here and now you know how it feels and Paul and and what happens is when you be when you start in that you begin that you begin to recognize the grace of God and that's a powerful thing and then I believe that you have to come to a place as a Christian to catch a revelation of grace because you can you can you can like like John Newton that's what happened to him you wrote the song Amazing Grace he came to a revelation of the grace of God could save him could could could could bring him up from where he was into this position as a new person in Christ and so so they're beginning to realize that you know God is gracious and and maybe they begin to pray because the Bible says they prayed and and and praise the God and so they're gonna pray Lord forgive us for our attitude forgive us for looking at this wrong and we thank you Lord that we had the opportunity to set to to be used by you to set someone free today and lower in here because we confess your name and we're never ashamed of the gospel of Christ and and then you know I'm kind of and we thank you Lord and they finished their prayer and then you know I'm Silas begins to sing you ever hear deducing they can sing pretty anointed they get to going they get to singing some of their songs in Hebrews and my goodness you're just ready to rapture and so they begin to sing one of them good Hebrew songs and and they begin to shout and begin to praise it and they were just singing they were praising and I begin to praise God and maybe after they stopped singing they're just saying thank you Lord and hallelujah Lord and Lord we love you we praise you and and I challenge you any any of you to start saying praise the Lord and not smile it's next to impossible I because who are you on the inside you are a product you are a peace of God and if you begin to praise God the who you are a part of you begin to praise him he begins to get excited what you're gonna get excited to amen and so next thing they know the walls begin to shake and silent soon be hit it's Paul he says hey we've always talked about bringing the laws down he said we're doing it today him and everything came down and even their chamber broke loose and and we know the rest of the story so no matter what your circumstances is there's always a reason to praise God and this story keeps coming to my mind but our Andrew passes a church and she back Alaska and he was you saying he was out gathering driftwood cuz they don't think there's no trees so if they want fires they have to go down to the beach and gather driftwood and so he was down there and his back was killing them and he went you know he had to drag these big old logs of driftwood to his to his four-wheeler so he could cut him up and and haul him back and his back was really hurting him and for whatever reason he just stood up he looked around him if he ever been out there it's just gorgeous and he says while he began to praise God and begin to sing he said next thing I know a bag didn't hurt more it says it how it's good to go there's always something to thank God for amen praise the Lord there was a in Luke chapter 17 there's a story of some lepers and um go ahead and jump over there and read that I think it was ten lepers Luke chapter 17 17 verse 11 and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off and he lifted up their voices and said Jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priest and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back with a loud voice glorified God and fell down his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan amen and Jesus answering said unto them said excuse me Jesus answering said where were were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine they are not found that returned to give glory to God save this stranger because he was a Samaritan he wasn't a Jew and he said unto Him arise go thy way thy faith hath made the whole the rest of the lepers he sent to the Pharisees but this man looks down he realizes they were all healed at the same time it looks down he was healed and he goes back to glorify God and God says your faith made the whole go you have no need to go to the to the Pharisees anymore you're completely whole amen and we know that leprosy is a type of sin and as a believer of you always have the ability like I said to be grateful for God and he saved you from sin sometimes people they're like these nine lepers God heals them hey go go to the go to the - The ministers go to the pastor to get baptized the name of Jesus Christ and they get baptized and they begin to serve God excuse me and they're delivered from sin and they forget to take the time to thank God amen and that and and and when God does something for you don't forget to take the time just thank him to thank him for what he's done for you amen praise the Lord brother Branham says in 1962 it's a story and he says tells the story of John Ryan the man who was blind and so John Ryan comes into line and the brother says poor boy was a Catholic his whole life he comes in to get us into the line for his healing but the batter becomes brother Branham brother BAM sees a vision that he's healed and he says you know just say Lord you were healed well Paul Ryan walks off the platform and he's still blind so he comes back up there and he gets back in line and he gets back up there and brother Branham says you mean believe me to be God's servant do I know you or restrain Jers he says yes and then he has a vision he sees that he's healed I mean so here's the same guy that was here here a minute ago hey guys look you've had him he says well I'm not healed who could have been a second or third time then he went to the line I can't remember but the man says no son God's already healed you you have to go just go testifying of what God's done for you and so he goes about and he prevents this he would stand up in the middle of the service and say hey hush up everybody listen to me God's done healed me thank you Lord and he says the trustees were and DK's were going up there to quiet it down for the nurses no no no leave him alone let him do that and so he went around praising God for his healing and I don't think was in a small town but he was unless he sold newspapers in his bless the corner and he's you know extra extra read all about it the Lord's healed me and it was obvious that he was still blind and so he says here he says so there was another little news boy come along and they took him over to the barbershop to get him a shave he wanted to go over and a little boy let him across the street he laid down in the chair and the barber it was one of those little he says Alex Mart's mmm I think you've been smart alecks and so he lathered up his face and wetted his razor and started shaving half his face down he said say dad Ryan he said yes sir what is it son he said said I I heard you was up to hear that Holy Roller preacher when he was up here say yes I was up he said I heard you God healed me he said yes praise God for healing me and his eyes come open in the barber chair out of that chair he went down the street with the towel around his neck the barber behind him such a display you've never seen and that man is preaching the gospel to this day amen why he looked he took God at His Word and they began to confess that him and there was two to two sisters that had both got up for prayer or believers and when I said sisters I've been believers not related and they both were in the same neighborhood and brother brems says the age of the Lord was going out and touching the people that God had that God had healed and giving the manifesting their healing and so the angel comes by and the lady had a I think of Goya on her neck and it fell off and I don't had a tumor or something and they both come running out from their houses they at each other and I just got healed Vibram says cousin Gloria just passed by so God gives you your healing he says this done saved Lord he told Abraham thus saith the Lord you're going to have a son the 2627 years later God finally gave him his son and that but in that your body obeys your confessions so these women and Paul and John Ryan they're confessing they're testifying that God had healed him even though on the flesh the manifestation of the flesh was the direct opposite but they're gonna confess that God has healed them and God they're a body obey the confession and God healed him if they had stopped there's stories of someone that I was healed in a wheelchair and then was stood up and the the mom and the nurse put them back down and they lost their healing Amen God gives God says hey you look I'm gonna heal you you confess and you believe that don't try to go off and then fix it on your own amen confess and give God the chance to heal you I think it was I was studying and brother branham's talking about about you know the Lord said he'd do it I can't remember anyway so you're saying the Lord the Lord said he's gonna heal you or the Lord said he's gonna gonna do something for you oh he says thus saith the Lord doesn't mean it's going to happen right now but it's going to happen praise Lauren so thus saith the Lord you know you have the right as a believer to be free to not have to to be caught up and as the rest of the world is around us and if we can if we can begin to show gratitude and making to be begin to be thankful our view will change of the world around us our view of the circumstances will change and you say you know maybe you got a beat-up car in begin to thank God for the beat-up car because it gets you from point A to point B and it's saving you money you don't have to be in debt and begin to thank God for that car watch God go ahead your your thoughts change you say well I said sort of look at say man this this thing he never runs right in and or it runs but doesn't run smooth and and find just speak negative and negative and negative but then you say I'm thankful you be gonna say thankful for that this car gets me to my job which brings in the money so that I can afford to live then you begin to your thoughts change now you don't hate the car you love the car and sometimes sometimes it's not your job or it's not the lack of money or it's not or it's not on the house it's just your attitude amen you can have people that they have this this pastors mentoring mentioning you know everyone's concerned about their health and you know as you get on Facebook and you see ads for this new pillow that does this or or this a new cheap quick way to get six-pack and all this stuff and that's all about health and then well there's there's this this this disease that I think they're calling it a disease but it's a mental illness of people you see these guys they look like Arnold Schwarzenegger did when he was a young man and they still think that they're not any good they still feel like they didn't need to lose weight it need to get bigger they need to get skinnier because they're feeding into that that that that idea all that I can think about is I gotta get better I got it I gotta be better I'm not I'm not any good I'm not any good and it's just this negative thoughts and so even though even though that they even though you as a Christian you're walking with God and then and you're feeding on God you say well you know the devil just gets in your head says hey you're not a Christian you begin to think I'm not good enough I'm not good enough to be a Christian I'm not you know all this and then you begin to think this negative stuff next thing you know but you begin to manifest that negative stuff and you find yourself backsliding but if you can say Lord you know that thought society that's just the devil trying to come into my head trying to give me to thinking negative thoughts and trying to get me to confess negativity I'm trying to get me to confess that I'm not a Christian and I'm not saved ISM well maybe I'm not saved knowing these thoughts come in your head next thing you know begin to confess that all that's going to do is bring you down but if you can begin to say no matter what God healing you begin to look back at when God filled you with the Holy Ghost and that's your said and that God saved your soul you said you know before the foundation of the world God knew I was going to be a part of his kingdom God had hand-selected me that I would be saved and filled the Holy Ghost and and you begin to think about that guess what your desire for Christ begins to grow some people have a real hard time and I think you know how do I know I really love God do I really love him and the you know we're always preaching about how you gotta have the love for God and I struggle this with this when I was younger and so how do I know yeah I don't really do I feel it I don't know and I'm beginning to realize that your love for him amen you could you can start to think it's not there because maybe you don't feel it you don't feel this love but you begin to realize you know hey I can't reading in the Bible and something stirs within you what is that stirring that stirring is your love for cry because you're spending time with him in his scriptures and something inside of you begins to bubble up there's a deep call to the demon if you ever again if you ever begin to question um anything just go question whether or not you have the goods go to back to the scripture go back to the message and just listen for a while just read for a while and when that thing within you begins to bubble up and that thing was then you begins to respond and say amen you just got your confirmation I mean there's that sister brother branham tells her story if she was all worried and nervous you know but the venom do I know it might save the mother they saved and there's also a doctor friend of his had the same thing and he says well let's go back to to the Bible let's go back to the doctor Jesus and let's go ahead and diagnose this thing hey man and that's what we have to do and then we get to look at at our mistakes and look at our shortcomings and what happens is we our view begins to taint and we think well how good can we be how how can we how come God even call us his own woman when when I just kicked the dog or I yelled at my wife or I or I yelled at my kids or I spoke harshly over here and the devil uses those and begin to see he begins to turn your eyes what off of the end of the goal and looking to either side and that's what you're gonna fall off the board and then but if you keep your eyes you say yeah I know my my my humanity is never going to be perfect this flesh man is never going to be perfect I'm gonna you know do kick the dog or slept say things I shouldn't have said I mean we always want to get better at those things and you should probably stop kicking the dog but granite there's always these things will do right because we're flesh man when you begin to focus on on on Christ and say you know it is bad that made me lose my train of thought it is with him that you find that you you begin to focus on Christ and say you know what he called me he ordained me and that's why I'm here today I lost my train of thought I'm sorry we'll go with that amen and we just say thank you Lord for that and we show that gratitude that God has has blessed us and filled us with the Holy Ghost Amen sister Amy in the musicians if you guys want to come this morning that pretty much wraps it up this morning and I know all of us including myself we can say lord help us to be more thankful help us to show gratitude more often amen and now maybe we can just take the time
