thanks to you in rejoicing now as you've taught us to do so amen amen thank you brother david you may have your seeds hey man once again i want to greet you all this morning and brother chris has an announcement why you come with chris this time go ahead yeah good morning everyone man keep this brief it's that time time of year again we're getting ready for our second annual race camp out so brother steve and sister sir coffee have agreed to come out for us so but the c will be speaking for us saturday night and sunday morning this year i wanted to be a little bit more church focused so we found a facility that had a nice pavilion with power in it um so that we can do that comfortably so friday night saturday night sunday morning friday night will be more of a singing and testimony service no no actual preaching but then saturday night sunday morning will be the regular services instead of the shared meals this year because of the services every night we're going to do shared refreshments after church around the fire so there's a central location where we can all share that special time together and that time of fellowship after church is always a little bit more special than before there's just a better way to organize it this year some people wanted to invite others and that's awesome we're going to send out a google form we're going to send out a form for you to fill out for your family how many people are coming and we need that to us by may 31st um well the everything will be in there for you to fill out to be simple and if there's anybody you want to invite send them the link to that form so that we can keep track of who else coming because not good not saying we're going to fill up but if people come as we're discussing we're going to be full so that is that about the church camp so we'll send out a form and all this obviously you're going to hear from me several more times because it's repetition works best so also wednesday night we did this i just kind of laid it on my little laid on my heart to send over to through brother berry a little video of encouragement you can take the poster down guys a little video of encouragement to the believers in ukraine you know we i know for for me and for most of you we when we saw the pictures of the people that we were praying for um we there was a connection right there's real people going through real situations and so i was talking you know brother barry sends the updates or gain uncle paul and other ones get them um so i was talking to him you know he he said he wished he could do more and i and i felt very humbled when he said that but um you know i thought we were we're helping financially we're helping with prayer but you know god gave us hands and feet to do something with and um not that prayer isn't good enough that's the best thing we can do so i thought you know why don't we put together a little video where each of us here say hello we're praying for you god bless you something very simple like that's a wednesday night we got most of you today we're going to get the rest of you if you wish to reshoot you can do so so directly after service um once you know that those that that lingered have have moved out will come and uh get each of you in turn to come say hello so stick around um just a simple hello or bless you we'll i'll put it together but the sergey is going to help me interpret it and we'll send it to brother barry and hopefully and pray that god will use that as a blessing and an encouragement and if you speak the language you can give your greetings in the language that'll save us interpreting it so that's all we have god bless you well i had no idea that brother chris was going to mention the ukraine so i just want to share with you that a few weeks ago we sent an offering of twenty five hundred dollars uh to brother barry and um uh my time slips by maybe it was yesterday evening friday evening we sent another twenty five hundred dollars and here in um maybe another two weeks or something of that nature we hope to have put together another 2 500 and so while i'm not here to ask for your money i'm just asking you uh if the lord lays on your heart to to support that um you know we have you can only imagine my brothers and sisters having a good as it were peaceful life having it completely disrupted but as we look at this and when you hear the testimonies of the believers there that they're not running they're not crying they are just declaring god's will for their life and they're standing solid they're having prayer meetings they are holding fast to the faith um and uh just uh you know you can see in different uh deals as as brother chris said i know brother sergey myself i'm not sure who else brother chris we're getting these updates and you see these videos these are people just like us just people have families uh as it were loving life living life and so uh whatever the lord would lay upon your heart um we will at a frequency here do our very best we're small church we have you might say somewhat limited resources but um if i was in that situation i would be so thankful for one the words of encouragement to know that uh real people real faces are praying for you and um so we want to reciprocate that because the day might come that we will be in that situation desiring the support and the prayer so if you feel led to offer to this you might just slip an envelope write ukraine on it and we'll just proceed forward but brother berry already has has uh given some feedback to that uh of saints there that their hearts are rejoicing uh brothers that have gone into the store literally this is one that he shared gone into the store on one day after almost immediately after receiving funds go to the store buy all they could place in their vehicle and the next day go back to that very same store to try to procure more uh food and and things and the store is completely empty and on this deal i tried to send the pictures the other day and i i couldn't i'm not bright enough i got one of them sent and sister sue's like is that the price of bread [Laughter] yeah you can go on hickory bible tabernacle and and it's all on there amen there's a few extra things as it is brother berry's sharing personally but but mostly it's just encapsulated there on hickory bible tabernacle and uh so what we're seeing saints is the absolute hand of the lord coming uh we see the saints uh leaving some of these places and while the world says that this area is completely surrounded by the military god has given them direction leadership to just turn down the right roads and to be able to just to be able to leave so keep them in your prayers as i know you have and this is very personal to those of you who uh come from the ukraine and uh you know it's it's just something that we hold deep in our heart and and we have as it were the very personal connection with our families here and um so just lift that up and we just do our best to continue to support them i say god bless you saints amen hey man it's good to have brother jose and sister steffi the family with us but jose's gonna be coming and speaking the word to us as he comes let's sing that song so much to thank him for when i look around and see the good things he has done for me i know i'm unworthy of them all but his blessings he freely gives i owe my whole life to him i've got so much to thank him for and i've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see he's been so good to me when i think of what he's done and where he has brought me from i've got so much to thank him for sometimes well on life's way i knew and i stop and say thank you lord for all you've done for me and one day i'll reach heaven sure let me kneel once more i've got so much to thank for and i've got so much [Music] when i think of what he's done and where he's brought me from i've got so much to thank him for amen when i think when i think of the goodness of jesus when i think think of the good jesus and all he has done for me that my soul cries out hallelujah praise god for saving me the goodness of jesus and all he has done for me then my soul cries out hallelujah praise god for saving me oh when i think of the goodness of jesus and all he has done for me that my soul cries out hallelujah god for saving me amen amen can you give one to the lord jesus amen thank you lord he's worthy amen amen preach in the name of the lord jesus christ and uh i welcome you to the house of lord even though i'm the one coming i'm outside but uh hey uh i'm happy to be here again uh happy to uh you may be seated brother paul told me inside feel free so take it up to him later um it's always a pleasure for me and my family being here in this place uh i told them uh when i told my kids they were coming here i said yes so he's uh i was telling barry jason i'm starting to worry i don't know i might start liking it here and we're going to do today is a a privilege for me once again to have my beautiful wife with me and the kids it's a it's grace god's grace that i have what i have i tell my wife that with her i have much more that i ever dreamed sometimes life is hard but you know what god always pays back double because you're obedience he's always going to give you back double i mean i i know it's always i'm start blaming to the i'm getting old and how sensitive that i come here but i i i appreciate your your understanding but today i've been uh for the past two times i was here i've been i feel like i've been here enough but you just know me and know my family here but you don't know my background yeah and i i thought that today i was gonna share if i can uh something for my background and uh i uh my brother came asking me this morning what was the title honestly i didn't know the title so i just say hey all things were for good. and then i text brother isaac say you know what because i still didn't know exactly what so i just takes few minutes i go brother i say hey can you add to the title personal experiences so uh i uh if you go with me to the book of romans thank you mr sims thank you very jason romans 8 28. so reads like this and we know that all things work together for good for those who love god to those who are call according to his purpose we're going to stop there and then we're going to colossians 2 13. and you being dead in your trespasses i'm sorry i didn't we have it colossians 2 verse 13 says and you've been dead on your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh he has made your life together with him having forgiven you all trespasses having wiped out the handwriting and requirements that was against against us which was contrary to us and he has taken it away having neil nailed it to the cross let's let's pray heavenly father we thank you lord we know we can do a lot of things too much lord but pray is never too much lord we ask you this morning to come and help me lord as i can as i try to speak father i want you to help us lauren and be help to someone lord i ask you to come and be the guest of honor in this place lauren we thank you father for the blessings you've been giving us till today lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen i am you know there is a there was a story about a king this king had a lot of helpers there and then one of them was a christian and he always if something happened he always told the king don't worry king everything is going to be fine god is good and he knows the reasons behind that what's going on and and so the king was a little bit of i guess a little too much of god is good and why he's so much saying about god is good and he so one day he decided to go to to go to hunting in on the middle of the nowhere up in the mountains a bear came and attacked the king and the servant managed to kill the bear but he couldn't save the king by losing a finger so the king got really upset and the servant said don't worry my king i gradual life although i couldn't manage to save you to finger but god is good we're alive so he went they went home and when they were home he got really upset again because the servant came to him again and said god is good my king so he ordered to put him in prison and the next day the king decided to go hunting again and he got too deep on the woods and savage tribe caught him and they were looking for someone for sacrifices so they caught the king and taken to the sacrifice place and finally when they were about to sacrifice they found out that it was a finger was missing so it wasn't perfect for a sacrifice so he came back scared and afraid and happy at the same time so he ordered he came back to the kingdom and he ordered to bring his servant back and he said i start believing what you're saying but i don't understand one thing why if god is so good why he allowed me to put you in prison today and he told the story i always i was almost killed but because of my finger and he the servant says my king everything works for good because if you wouldn't put me in prison i was going to be the sacrifice and then the king finally got it so see sometimes we go through difficult difficulties in life and we don't understand and we're never gonna understand until it's in the past and that hardship that you went through is going to help someone on the road that's right because your tests they become testimonies yes and your trials they become triumphs and hands of the lord amen so today like i say you're gonna have to bear with me a few minutes i don't know uh it's 11 right 11 10. so uh i uh if i give you the whole background we're gonna have to come back this afternoon so i'm gonna i'm gonna chop it off a little bit so my and i kind of tell a tall brother paul uh last time was here we we went to his house and uh when we when we received the message the the william branham's message i was like seven eight years old we were we were living in a basically a jungle and we didn't have uh we didn't have any uh a way a way to transport other than donkeys and mules and horses if we're lucky so um being a kid just taking care of goats milking goats drinking milk and just living in nature so of course not video games no nothing like that no cell phones and i uh uh we grew up my brother is two years older than me i'm the i'm the youngest of nine i don't know my monk how she handled that much kids but is uh uh we uh we had a i don't want to say a rough life but i think we had a a life good life so we can learn the good from the bad and and and my mom uh she didn't know how to write or read she went to school maybe a couple years and then decide to have kids i guess and my dad he never learned how to write or lead or read but he knows how to count so when someone was paying him hey you're missing a bill here so but he learned that i think it was important right so uh so we we my mom was catholic 100 i think one of the if you want to call someone catholic i will say she was the original because what she what she believed it wasn't that that image because she had a a picture like this big and she made rosaries i will i don't want to lie but i i i'm almost positive was every night for 30 minutes on her knees and she was doing this rosary i never learned it but uh i uh so by i think by the age i think my sister the the fourth kid is a woman which is lives in colorado my sister margarita i think she was around 15 and she had a she went through a situation in life i don't know nobody knows what was it but i think was a calling from god i say i will call it because she's been raised catholic all these years and uh and then she had this encounter with with something and she ran a little deeper in the in the woods and and she was looking straight up and then my mom she didn't know anything else she was praying catholic rosary and and holy mary and this and that and uh my sister finally said stop mom you don't pray to her she can help us you pray to god my mom was hurt because it was what she knew and however she could she she started praying to to the lord and then she started coming it was kind of nervous situation for her i don't know what was my mom again being catholic took her to a priest catholic priest in the closest little bigger town and the catholic priest says i don't know what it is and she took it to the doctor and the doctor says i can't find anything wrong with her but the catholic priest give give my mom gave my mom a new testament that's how yeah my mom learned how to read forgive me is then my mom started reading the book the new testament and uh she uh she started having a lot of questions about it so the first source of answers was the catholic priest so my mom started reading the apocalypse revelation about who's the harlot who's this the the daughters of the heart what is all this because i mean when you're reading the book for the first time it's scary and the catholic priest told her oh you don't need to go that yet just go back to matthew read the gospels of course my mom did what the priest told her but and back in her head still what's going on here because if i'm reading here i gotta at some point i gotta go back here so she kept reading and around that i was still a kid and and a lot of things i don't remember very well but i'm which i'm not going to make up anything so i'm going to tell what i remember but some sometime after that she went to visit uh relatives in another state in mexico is called morelos and over there my brother my dad's brother became pentecostal and he gave my mom a cassette tape for those kids you know what cancer tape is is it like a cd these days but it's a different form you can google it later but uh so in this cassette tape it was a testimony of a brother was his name is paulino bernal he you know we were kids so one side was he said 30 minutes his testimony and the other 30 minutes on the other side was songs beautiful songs so we as kids being in the jungle that was the only distraction we had so we put that 24 7. we memorized the testimony and my brother memorized the testimony his testimony and we memorized the songs don't ask me today but that was when i was a kid so i uh i remember that my dad started getting upset i'm gonna take that i said i'm gonna throw her all the way up where you guys don't pick it up again so we played when he was in the home when he came back home we just stopped but somehow started uh we we we kind of like it my mom i fell in love with that testimony and she loved more reading the new testament so one day it was time for us to go to school and because we live in the jungle the the teacher that was supposed to be our teacher over there in the in the jungle someone kidnapped her and took her with him and so we had no teacher and then they decided to bring a guy and say maybe this guy is ugly nobody will like him so he is i think he stayed there for a year or two and he quit so we had to move to a little bigger town so there was school for us and but before that my mom somehow she figured out how she managed how to go to church and when we get to the top to the town i remember below the house where my my my brother rented there was a neighbor and this neighbor the sister and the daughters were she my mom saw them dressed different and my mom she couldn't stay quiet so she approached her and said hey are you catholic are you christian no no we're christians and then there's tall talking and they say well i have some questions that i've been dealing with all these years and i i haven't found anyone that can answer and she said well uh this sunday a missionary is coming so you can ask him anything so my mom managed i think she lied to my dad i don't know but she's she stayed that sunday to go to church and and she didn't waste time so she went and asked she went straight to him and asked him what is all this and the brother told her everything then my mom went back home grabbed that virgin mary a picture put it away a couple of friends that she had there got mad at her because what she was doing was wrong my mom wasn't disrespectful with them i said i think i found what i was looking for so since then my mom managed to manage a way to deal with my dad so my dad was upset he didn't want he didn't want to change religion but uh uh my mom every time you say uh isidro is my dad's name is this weekend i gotta go to buy groceries okay but you come saturday no i'm coming sunday afternoon so it's three hours on horseback riding from the jungle to the town and then we took another car to go to church to another town and sometimes my mom because my dad got upset that's what i want to think of because there was no reason why my mom will come along to to to town to buy groceries when she had a two daughters and two two sons with my dad doing nothing but sometimes my mom had to come along and come back like three o'clock in the morning in the middle of nowhere she was riding a mule by herself and she did it i don't know for how long i don't want to lie but she started praying i mean if if there is a woman of faith that's one of that i know yeah and she started praying about so a way that she can bring the kids that left at home to church so somehow i don't know what agreement they had but all of a sudden uh one weekend my mom was bringing a brother and sister with her then the next weekend the other two and we were like that for a few periods of time and and obviously we we as a kids been in the jungle i mean even if if we if we heard a more uh uh a motorcycle we will run and hide because we didn't know what was that that kind of situation we lived in and and uh i uh i remember that we went to church because i mean i wanted to go go out i just i was tired of milking cows in and goats and i didn't know anything about the city or nothing so but we started when we moved to the to the town my dad was really upset because he still wanted to continue on his field but even though we didn't see any money we didn't see much crops and he still wanted to be there finally a miracle happened and he sold all the properties that he had up there and he stayed in the town where there was transportation so like i say i'm gonna be chopping this because the time but so we started going to church more often and every sunday my mom like i said i don't want to lie but as far as i remember she never missed a service even in covet she say i don't want to miss one i don't know what you're going to do son but i want to be there if three people go there i want to be one of them so even if she was sick super sick she will never complain unless she was in bed in the hospital so we start going to church and and of course we start growing being in teenage age and to be honest i don't i don't remember struggling in my teenage years because i think i was busy working and when your mind is busy uh is less chances that you start planning things that you shouldn't be planning so i uh i i started working when i was 14 and of course uh 16 17 15 16 years that's when we start looking for someone right and i say well i'm 15 16. i got to find a girlfriend when i wa when i'll be 17 i'm gonna ask her hand because that's how like engage me here that's that's what it does we do in mexico or latin america so i want to ask for her hand and at the age 18 then 1920 i'm gonna get married yeah right but you know what we as a young people even though we don't know uh we ignore a lot of things how how to approach a woman because we we try i tried to date daughters from brothers and i don't know they didn't like me even the dads were like and you know what i always had this this um i don't know how you say trauma maybe because i was from a country i was a country boy i had no money i had no properties my dad sold them all and and uh besides those properties didn't worth much but uh so i had that trauma in in you and i and and and at one point i this i i said well i had nothing to offer to someone when i'm wasting time so i kind of let go and besides i tried to date the brothers christians daughters didn't work out so i'm gonna convert one i'm a good christian i i'm gonna but you know what i i uh i'm not gonna say i i was the best christian young boy christian boy but you know my mom when we were kids uh my mom gave us a new testament because she was all she afford a new testament and give us a notepad and she said every time we go to church you have to pay attention to the preacher write down the scriptures and when we come you're gonna read to the during the week go back and read again my mom wasn't a minister my dad wasn't a minister but you know what i think she was doing a great job because she told us the best she could she thought i was the best she could and so down in my heart even though i wanna uh sometimes i got this thought i wanna go hang out with this my friends and girlfriends and so i grew up in um like i said i started working in a hotel 14 years old and they fired me because i was too young because someone else that was young as well got got uh hurt the job and the some government company sued them and and so i they had to kick me out because i was underage to be working but i say uh hey uh how about i can uh oh because before that i start they call them bailments or bell boys the ones help you with the luggages and i say i started i just started practicing there you know at that age i i i wanted to speak english so when a tourist came to the hotel and i was washing dishes and and uh white guys came to eat in the fancy restaurant that i and i was like this and i said what nice is that language i want to learn it and then we start listening tapes from brother bernie bilingual bernie garcia so that kind of opened my interest in the english language a little even more so when i was working in the hotel uh i saw the my co-workers speaking with the client and i couldn't and i said one day i'm gonna be able to do that so i went and took some english class but didn't work out because it was a mexican teaching me english so i went to different school and there was another mexican teaching me english but that's the school that i could afford so finally in the hotel i um i think i found grayson the human resources guy and say okay we're going to let you come just to practice but you don't clock in or out nothing whatever you make and tips but on a high season i get to make like uh 1500 pesos which nowadays is like 15 20 a week which back then was for a kid 15 years old i think it was plenty money right so then i became uh older 18 years old okay they they hired me back the hotel but they didn't they didn't want me because i will i always i always been uh that kind of person that is is not satisfied with doing one thing only i want to learn okay i i learned this but what what else so then i moved to a different area i i learned how to flip eggs like this because i was tired of washing dishes only and and i said where else i'm gonna go from here so i started looking in the into the kitchen but the the the atmosphere in the kitchen i didn't like it because too many bad things happen there and if i tell you you you don't want to go eat in restaurants so i had a i had this opportunity to be in the in the front desk area even though i didn't speak english i uh i always wanted at least to listen whoever speak english so i was there and then when they hired me back the general manager hired me as uh they they titled me uh bus bus boy i think it was or i don't know what title they gave me but they gave me a little money that's all i remember very well the money wasn't enough because i lost the opportunity of being on the helping the customers with the luggage so i can make extra dollars there and so i uh i was his personal driver basically and and he's been his driver i had to be in different offices and different places important people but i i still knew that i was a christian i never forget that yeah even though i i kind of interact with different important people per se but i still knew that i was a christian and i still always my mom that's the other thing that she always remind us whatever you do any kind of work you do just don't forget that you need the sunday aft so you can go to church so we always had that in in our heart because if it was here it was gone next day and we so every time i could i had sunday stuff so i go to church and being in that position it was an office um shift so i was able to have saturday and sunday off but saturday i went back to help with the luggage again and i get an extra money and they didn't care i mean and but the enemy will never stop trying to bring you down so after working there a few years in the general manager's office the owner of the hotel requested me to be his driver so then i went back to the i went to his office now i was working with him taking the his kids that wasn't his but it was his wife's kids to the school and picked him up back and doing whatever he wanted me to do and some sometime and that that when i was there working the secretary his secretary told me okay this is going to be your duties every time you come here you get into the engineer's office empty the trash can and replace his pitch water okay so that was my routine and then one day one day i came to the office and i saw a magazine and the trash can with beautiful loveseats expensive ones a catalog and i thought say i think he threw this by mistake so i'm gonna take it out and put it on the secretary's desk if he if he asks for it he's there okay so that day the gentleman came in and i think he got up with the left foot or i don't know what happened but he fired me and he didn't fire me he told the general controller which i never had any touch with him to tell me that i was fired and i said why why what did i do he's he said i don't know well i want to know because as far as i know i've been honest and i've been doing a good job even though they don't pay me much but so i said i want to go talk to him i said no you can't oh yes i can so i called the secretary and say hey is the engineer there she said yes but he's really mad you don't want to be here oh no i'm on my way so i got there and i just barged into the office i didn't knock and i say i know i'm fired you can do anything else but i want to know why and i want an answer now and he said he said well you've been digging into my paperwork here i don't have business in your paperwork your paperwork's in english i don't speak english why you're saying that well what is my magazine your magazine isn't the enormous desk i put it there because you had it in the trash can i want to know why i'm fired but you don't want me here that's fine i'm on my way up i had my conscience clean but you know like like i was saying in the beginning sometimes you go through things that is hard for me it was really hard because i think i thought i was doing a good job but you know when god doesn't want you in one place he's going to allow things happen even though messes up your head a little bit but he's going to move you and a few i will say months before there was a an older woman but still young but it was after me and everybody everybody knew but i was still kind of innocent i didn't know and all of a sudden she started asking me if i can give her massages and you know what that's when i got to think i said god you know what you're doing i'm not gonna get upset i know what you're doing is perfect like i say i'm not claiming that i was the best christian or perfect but you know what one thing i knew was god put something a seed in my heart that it doesn't matter what you do if you don't listen for in a good way he's going to make you listen the hard way this is up to us really so then when i remember that i say okay lord thank you and everybody the the the people that i was in touch with and the front desk area the offices i was so trusted that they sent me to the bank with a hundred thousand dollars to deposit because back then there was no electronic to so i had and that didn't go anywhere and the the general controller many times she she called me hey can you come and help me to count this money because i want you to go that's why they were why why what did you do what happened and i only knew and god knew what happened and that's that's what i'm saying god's grace we we don't do nothing so he can give us the grace i mean how special more special was i at that time than the other people that i grew up in church but they're gone i didn't do anything else anything special it's just god's protecting his gift i uh moved to uh i started working in a carpentry shop and when i was there uh someone called me working in a travel agency see that the english thing was on my head and being in a carpenter shop i lost it i mean i forgot that i was interested in learning the language but then all of a sudden this lady called me say hey can you i heard you're looking for work i said no i wasn't she said well if you want to work we we i work in a travel agency we need someone to pick up guests in the airport and send to hotel and vice versa and uh carpenter job everybody were drug addicts smoking pot and sniffing the white stuff and there was me the guy who brought me there he said you don't have to do it but if you want i said no thank you and i i i think i was there for four months max and so when she called me i said okay i'm out of here and i say but on one condition she said what i need sundays off oh yep okay we'll see what we can do and they give me sundays off then down the road there was a charter from denmark and they were dropping off people on sundays afternoon so after church i went to the airport picked them up put on the taxi and bye bye so i worked there until 2000. year two thousand and you know and back in my mind still i was looking for my help me and i couldn't find her anywhere and when we grow older we become more picky because when you're when we're young oh she's beautiful and she when she smile has this dimples and and and we just go by the looks but when we start growing older and we know that we also eat we start looking for someone that if she doesn't know how to cook at least she's willing to learn so so i brought a couple candidates to my house and say mom here is so-and-so and if she didn't put any input to help my mom and i said okay so but i still knew that somehow god was gonna give me what i was looking for even though i didn't know what i was looking for because that's true we don't we don't know and i'm gonna prove you in a minute if you don't believe me so i um i always again it's god's grace i always had in my heart to find someone that god will approve i didn't know how i was going to find out that but i just knew that somehow god was gonna put the pieces in place so that happened so uh i came to the states in 2000 august 18. and the first thing is my dream since i was since i started listening brother bernie bernie's tapes since i was a kid so my dream was to be able to be in tavern a phoenix tabernacle one day and and and i met the brother in in mexico he went there but i just wanted to be in the place where he was preaching all these sermons and you know we we we go to church um i'm gonna back up a little bit when we're a kid when we're kids we go to church because our parents take us to church but coming to church with your parents doesn't make you a christian coming to church is something that you want to right that you can't wait till sunday morning the doors open to come and meet with god you're not you're not you're not coming here to see someone to have a meeting with some you you're here because you want to hear from the lord and you want to grow spiritually so you can be stronger and stronger every day because the moment we stop eating from the heavenly manner we get weaker and weaker and that's where where the enemy once wants us to do that's why he came up with all these devices so he can pull us this way and that way and then he's smart but we have to outsmart him by sticking with the world because before those devices in the beginning was the word right so we have to stick with the what was spoken in the beginning and and uh because everything here i mean you got a cell phone we got i got a cell phone but you know what after a year the cell phone start having problems it's a device made by men that has an expiration date but the son of god doesn't have an expiration date because the seed of god is in his children and that's what is eternal that's what brother burns says hell is not eternal because or people in hell there won't have eternal life there because that was created but god has no beginning has no end and we were created at his image amen then so when i made my decision by being a christian i was at the age of 15. i decided to baptize and i said from now on it's on me from now on my parents responsibility is over so i have to fight the fight but i'm just myself but i can i can feel my mom's prayers all the time even though i'm married i know she never sees praying for her nine nine children and now she has to pray for the grandchildren too and you know i had this uh perspective of oh i uh i'm gonna go to the phoenix tabernacle and i'm pretty sure i'm gonna find my help me there because it's a christian church what a surprise again i'm not saying i was a perfect christian but when i got there i went back to colorado you know listen i didn't have a car i like i said i got i i got here to the states of course you know that no money uh i had a friend in colorado that he had a 85 toyota tercel 4x4 i don't know if anyone knows those cars but uh that car he said you know what i use this car shoes for work back and forth but i never took any long trips you want to take it is there okay how much you wanna are you gonna run how much you want no just take it i was i i was living in close to aspen colorado so i drove no english no money in a borough card i was happy to go to phoenix tabernacle because that was my dream so i drove from colorado uh utah and arizona and there is a place called kayenta never forget that you know yeah you know why because and that kayenta town was a construction area and it was it was november it wasn't that hot but like i said i didn't speak any english and i was driving with a mexican driver's license so i was nervous every time i saw a patrol car i was like oh don't stop don't just don't stop just keep going keep going i was praying so then i i had to stop in this construction area and the temperature gauge started going [Music] while i was waiting and it went hot and i couldn't do an earth construction area is there is no way that i can turn i can get off the road all i all i did was lord you know the purpose of this trip i don't know what's going on with this car i just can't trust you when i open my eyes the two impact normal god's grace i uh made it made it to phoenix the first thing i did was go to a mechanic and see check the car they couldn't find anything wrong with it i drove in phoenix it's what i had to drive and went back no issues with the car but i realized that that my helmet wasn't there yeah what a deception right as a christian church but you know i went back this is 2000. 2001 came the meetings again i'm gonna give another chance um went back again on a different car i went back and i came back to work empty-handed so i just like i say i always remember god i don't know what's going on but you know that what i'm looking for so i you know what since i never had any luck with the dads of the daughters that i dated mexico they didn't like me i don't know why uh i said lord this is what i'm gonna do now i wanna because i i don't wanna hit and miss anymore i know you create me i'm sorry i know you create me and i know who you have for me so i'm gonna ask you for three signs number one said i'm your son maybe not the best looking guy but i'm still your son i say from now on i don't think the son of god has to beg for love and i might be wrong but that was my talk with god i say the first sign that i want to know is that when i approach someone again i wanna i wanna know that it's you in that person when when i ask so i don't want to finish my sentence when she say yes i say it's too much to ask well the second is the dad must like me this time so because i mean uh i wasn't doing nothing wrong was i and if i just i think that the the biggest problem that i had was because i didn't have no money i didn't have a house maybe but anyhow is is uh that's that's one of the reasons the young people make mistakes because sometimes at least i had that experience we as we as young people we look up to ministers and because this minister always is as an awesome minister behind the pulpit he jumps and shouts and dies but you know what i realized that you don't know someone behind the pulpit is good person when you don't know him outside that's right and that's what i thought i had to tell something a little bit of my background to people because i don't want you to have a form of me that oh i'm a servant of the lord because i come here and speak and brother paul calls me back again and no because i want you to know me a little bit more because choose myself i'm a big mess without the lord so then i i forgot to ask one thing to the lord not those conditions i didn't ask him to be close to me i miss it totally amazing so when i was in colorado at work i met a girl and feed some of the requirements that i asked the lord but she had she was she won she was with second marriage or divorce and all the time i always present lord whoever i was talking to i always present the lord and if they i say lord if they fall in love with you then that might be one of the chances that i can befall in love with her but if she doesn't want anything to do with you then i don't want anything to do with her i always had that in my heart and i it's not that i felt like i was more special than anyone it's just i feel like god i didn't ask to be here in this earth so you for some reason you you decide that i was gonna be here and for that reason i know i need a helmet but you know where it is i don't know so two more minutes uh so i uh i thought she was the winner so when i uh but i always uh call brother bernie at that time and uh and i called brother bernie and and and he said you're gonna hear a lot of vices but decision is yours you have to make a decision if you asking me for my advice is this don't go there don't go that way because you're gonna ruin your ministry i say what are you talking about i don't even know if i'm a minister but you know what i listen and uh oh the other sign that i asked i almost missed that one that i didn't want anybody that was jealous if she doesn't trust me that means so this girl that i met in colorado like i say seems like fit the requirements but she was possessive and jealous so when brother bernie told me not to before i was doubting but when i saw that she was possessive and jealous say no then i went back to god again and said lord what's going on i'm your child i know i'm your child and i know you have someone out there for me but what is it but but this time i'm 27 now and there my plans were to be married by 20 right i was like jacob i feel like jacob working seven years so then i uh we started working in the mission in greeley with brother ezekiel and then one day i i was traveling from aspen four hours winter and summer like for three years two years somewhere every every weekend to to help with that mission there and my co-workers say hey you have a girlfriend over there that's where you go every weekend over there yeah i have one they didn't understand anyway so yeah i have one so one of these trips uh i got into the bedroom that i had there for i said i saw an album photo album you kids you know what the photo album is nowadays so digital right so i started flipping peaches and then i saw a beautiful lady there and she looked like a girl i mean still still a girl but you know what something inside of me jump out that's what you're looking for and i had no doubt about it that when i walked out of the i i got out of that room and i went to brother execute say who is this girl here i want you to tell me about her she goes like you want to talk to her say yeah why not she's beautiful okay she's from peru what okay so there she uh he gave me her email address kermit if i'm wrong right so i sent her an a an email i don't remember what i told her but i remember when she said hi back i said oh she speak english so we start emailing back and forth and i asked her for her phone number like the second email that i sent her and he told me he was she was from the capital of lima so i said she must have a phone number so she gave it to me and then i called brother bernie brother bernie what do you think i found this girl and then i told her and uh oh that's good but before i found that picture many tears i had to share because i was going back with god pretty much every day what i'm doing wrong before that i want to back up again before i found the picture i was so i want to say desperate i was desperate and and kind of mad with god i said you know what lord i've been doing the best i can because because that's the human being right we we do good a little bit and we say oh we're doing great but in the measurement of god that's not good enough that's when grace kicks in to finish the work and then i have friends in aspen there is a tourist place that a lot of kids coming to graduate and finalize their school practicing with customer service and whatever so there were girls from brazil new zealand different parts of the world and they were inviting me to go to a bar friday nights oh it is two for one or whatever i don't know what it is and and they invite me every pretty much every week and i said nope i gotta go home i never went but you know i got to this point when i was really upset and i said you know lord i don't think you need me i don't think you you want anything with me so i'm done so next time i got invite i'm gonna go this is me talking like monday or tuesday well guess what thursday night i was working and i went i had my cell phone with me but it was off so at my dinner time supper i opened the phone and there was a voicemail area code 602. number that i wasn't registered to my phone and the call was proper party i'm sorry i can't help it but god's great again because the conversation i had with god i didn't answer the phone it was a voicemail yeah i opened the voicemail bro bernie says son i'm just calling to say that i love you i know what you're going through and it's hard but god god loves you too and he wants you to know that you're not alone i miss dinner that night i just went up cry am i who am i so he can have more mercy with me than some other people how many times you talk to people and they don't want at least they think you're you're given something of yours but we've got nothing to offer i mean the salvation comes from the lord it doesn't come from grace tabernacle or any minister to come speak here that's god's grace it's the same grace for you is the same grace for me so i hadn't i didn't do anything extra so he can be merciful with me but i i again i i always i will i don't know how about i always knew that god had a plan for me and i didn't want to mess up his plan so every time that i wanted to to do something wrong i the first thing i had in mind say i'm going to hurt my mom she's been praying for me hold this years and then what about god i don't know why his plan is with me but he has a plan for my life and i don't want to mess up that either so uh after i i i listened um voicemail guess what no one else invite me again yeah so that's when i found her on the photo album and we started dating over the phone and you want to call it dating emails phones phone calls i use a lot of phone cards back then but you know what after a year not even a year when i asked her she didn't let me finish i said laura thank you laura and then later i found out that even even her grandma loved me yeah i uh and i think i win her because i sent her mariachi to her window one time and and uh she said that her grandma said that anyone like jose that's the one i will have problems with anyone else here in lima but with him even though she's go i know she's gonna live far away i have no problems so god's grace again but we didn't see each other uh pictures only i called brother bernie says it's been a year what do you think hold on one more year that's right and after talking to him like the following week i was diagnosed with something going on in my intestine that i needed surgery and it wasn't 2006 so i went and did the scans and everything and went to work i was get started at work when i got a phone call said you need to come back you need we need to do surgery and uh i i went back and on my way back to the hospital i called the brother execute i want you to pray for me i don't want to get caught nothing i want to god handle this so they run three more exams the next next day came to me and said i'm so sorry we scare you and but we found something that was really risky i say don't worry i know what happened god's grace one more time yeah so uh then we kept exchanging information back and forth until uh we decided that we was gonna get married in 2007 and we didn't know each other face to face two weeks before the wedding now i'm not encouraging young kids to do the same okay don't do that i don't regret it but it's painful because you have to go through a lot of things in life that you might don't like it like i say when you are obedient to the lord he's gonna pay you double give you back double so don't think because you are 18 and 19 21 25 you're getting too old god's plans are perfect the bad thing i saw on the ministers back then is that many ministers were pushing young people oh you're 20 you're getting old why are you going to get married because they got married when they were 17 no i mean i i i have the best wife that i could ever found and i don't think i found her god put it there for me i mean when i was making plans in marriage she was like seven years old eight maybe who would knew imagine if i called her dad hey i made it in preparation for to marry your daughter if i was there he'd probably shoot me but you know what again it's god's grace i like i told you in the beginning i wasn't i wasn't going to bring you a a good teaching maybe but i want you to know a little bit more about us we're we're not perfect but you know what i'm just want to share this experience with with you and especially with the younger kids because i is is is now how fast you can make a decision to get married it's not about that it is how much you love the lord first seek first the kingdom of god and then he's going to add whatever we need you know i always give this example when a guy was having problems with his car in the middle of the road a well-dressed man showed up and said kid what's going on can i help you and he said wow what can you do you don't look like a mechanic maybe not but what what's going on well this car doesn't doesn't want to start okay pop the hood and he went in there and moved a screw or two try it again yeah and the car start it was the guy who designed the car god designed you he knows what you need so don't run don't rush that's right because that's the problem we rush things and then we come back paying the price like brother bernie told me there will be many advices but the decision is going to be yours and you're going to have to be prepared to live with the results of the decision you make you make a right decision you make the wrong decision you're gonna have to live with it there is no way you can skip that if i just because i was feeling too old and i decided to go with the one i thought was feeding the requirements i don't know what i would be today for sure i wouldn't be stunning this place i can guarantee you that you know what in 2002 i drove by here i went to washington to visit my brother and then we drove back here to went to murphy church up there and i didn't know there was a grace tabernacle here but you know what i like i say i don't recommend doing what i did i don't regret it because she's more than i could have asked for and on my way here i i asked i told her say hey when can we go to climb ohio to visit barchat just tell me when i'm ready so if you if you think that getting married with someone that because he's handsome or she's beautiful and i mean all that is going to go away you know i was just joking with my son the other day and i said bro uh joe what are you gonna who are you gonna look for uh brown white or mexican peruvian he said that whoever has a good heart i say praise the lord i mean we're we're not about colors we're about character right because all that matters is that what is in you can find connection what is in the other part and that that's when god is working when you love the lord she loves the lord we're going to have some bumps on the road tell me about it but you know what we have the help of the holy ghost to come and help us that's right you know the bible says that eve was taken out from adam's body and she's in the bible says that was part of her body and you know what and i i'm not very proud to say this but when i made her cry before i don't remember what was last time thank god because i'm watching up but when i made her cry i realized that i was hurting myself and i couldn't wait till next day to go say i'm sorry honey even though i felt i had i was right but you know what i said i'm sorry amen yeah please forgive me amen and and she's part of us and i can't imagine my life without her honestly and i'm not saying this because she's back there it is because uh lately i realized that if it wasn't for her i couldn't be where i'm at that's exactly right yeah that's the truth because that's when god i have no doubt zero doubt that that's the one god had for me because in my line of work i have to deal with the wives 99 of the time and she's not worried she's not jealous she's not checking me where are you what time are you coming that's a team teamwork she's home taking care of the kids god's grace we're homeschooling what did i do god's grace again i i i'm sorry if i let you down today because it wasn't a good i but i think i think i can be a help with someone maybe maybe not here but someone out in the internet is because we we have to make sure that whatever we're doing here we have to be doing for the lord because this young lady is here if lord teres they're gonna be the wife of someone and we as parents we would love to see them married to a servant of the lord but it is not a servant up here only because a true servant of the lord starts in the house and they're home because we you know many times and i'm gonna say this with a little bit of pride but the good pride i hope it doesn't don't misunderstand me but many times when i come out uh finished preaching either one of my kids say dad you preach very well today i enjoy what you preach today that is telling me that i'm not doing a bad job at home because i can be a monster at my house and i can be a saint here and that's what i'm trying to take care of or watch out not to do that because it's really easy to the the ego can pop up because one person comes and tell us oh how so it's just it's my prayer all the time lord don't let me be that kind of person and again it's god's grace that is brought us this far again i'm sorry if i took too much time but uh i just want you to to know that we have struggled the same as you but you know what we serve in the same lore and is the same god if you please stand brother jason if you just come let's pray heavenly father we thank you lord i have no words to express my gratitude to you lord and to express that the goodness of you lord [Music] that you decide to to leave the throne of glory in common [Music] and be one of us lord so we can be part of you one of you lord we thank you for that love lord we ask you to lord that you can [Music] you can grab a whole of those [Music] young children lord including my my boys lord even though they're still young father but lord these words that they heard today lord they don't they will never forget lord that we have to wait patiently in you lord [Music] and we have to make sure that what we're doing is your will father we thank you for the confidence and the trust brother paul here and his church father is amazing people here father every time i come here father i feel like i don't want to leave father this is your love that i can see here lord i pray lord at this words today lord help someone out there [Music] because only you know what is best for us and sometimes hurts but still we want to receive it lord with a joyful heart in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen thank you god bless you my brother thank you i enjoyed that amen in the brotherly way i just fell in love with jose all over again amen let's sing my jesus knows just what i need my jesus knows just one high name oh yes he knows just what i need he satisfies and every need he supply yes he knows just what i need my jesus knows just what i need [Music] oh yes he knows just what i need [Music] supplies yes he knows just what i need let's sing one more before we turn to brother paul we'll give all the glory to jesus tell of his love we'll give the glory to jesus and tell of his love his wonderful love will give the glory to jesus [Music] of his wonderful love [Music] o will give the glory to jesus and tell of his love his wonderful love will give the glory to jesus [Music] amen wasn't that beautiful this morning you know sometimes when we come and we think okay we're going to hear somebody's testimony but isn't amazing there's so much of his testimony that i'm like there was i lord oh here lord you did the same for me and thank you lord and it just amen brother jose i hope you don't mind i'm going to change the title of your sermon today [Music] i was thinking as he was speaking it god leads his dear children along and that is the story of every one of us our lives we can look back and say you know what i would have done this but the lord led me here i would have made a mistake that would have been life-changing but the lord put a red light in front of me and stopped me for long enough and phone would ring voicemail and suddenly you realize you know there's a little girl i don't know if you've heard it on youtube i can't think of her name i think it's haley cross saying this brother tim pruitt's church down there direct line to the throne room if you haven't listened to that song it's a very inspiring song to me you can find it online my brother and sister we have a direct line to the throne room we don't have to say well i hope somehow god hears me what we have to do is just get sincere and then have the confidence to know that god has hurt us amen now look i just have a couple little things i don't want to re-preach his sermon for him but you know i happen to know sister sefi and i happen to know most of that story from our friendship but is it beautiful and i i give you a rose today sister cephei and i give a rose to my dear sisters you see by god's grace the beauty we see in our sisters is the beauty that christ saw in his bride and that the beauty is on the inside amen it's not how we dress up the outside but the beauty is on the inside amen god bless you sister cephei if i can say this correctly i love you very much amen now look i want to just make this other comment right here you see to truly find what you're looking for [Music] you must turn down the things that are not for you see satan's going to offer as time goes on this bride of jesus christ the devil's offering her all kinds of things [Music]
