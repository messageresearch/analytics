this hour this is a treacherous the prophet called in a treacherous time God bless you God bless you called it a treacherous hour a treacherous time because we're living in the very end of the end of time we don't know exactly that day that moment that the resurrection will take place but we know we're in the hour we're in the time and so God bless you this evening and God bless those on the internet and and may those that are listening may they hear I want to continue with the white Throne judgment part three this is part 3B and because I didn't finish some things I wanted to get done so we'll try to just not go back and it'll be maybe a couple things we might touch back on but pretty much this is just going to carry right on amen and we're speaking of the names blotted out removed from the book of life and that's a that's a hard thing to preach on because people feel like you're speaking against them but we're not speaking against anyone we're bringing the truth to the people and whatever they want to do with it or you do with it that's between you and the lord it's not between me and you it's between the you and the Lord amen but I want to speak on the subject or make the subject of this tonight the dead hour and the borderline Believers the seat of discrepancy the borderline Believers are the seed of discrepancy now you can be a borderline you can be on the borderline but you don't have to remain a borderline believer but there is borderline Believers that will be borderline and then switch and go over and over disobey the word and become become and thereby that their name is removed why you say why would they do that because it's in them too why would it be uh you know you look at the tribulation Saints they remain virgins they re remain that way it's because it's in them to do so why is the bride the way she is because it's in her to be that you can't change that God placed it there he's Sovereign how he deals with with his with his creation he know before the foundation of the world foreknew everyone that he knew his bride he know those that would receive eternal life at the white Throne judgment after the second Resurrection he knew they would be in me those that would be Cast Away and the names were removed now all of that is happening now it won't happen then it's what we do with the word now in our time in our season our dispensation we have to we have to do make those decisions now and whatever we are here the judgment will will those in the Judgment are judged by their works and if they're found in the book of life if their works are there then their names remain if they're if the if the if the if by their Works they show that they their names have been removed then they're the ones on the left so let's stand together now the borderline to be borderline means you're uncertain if you're a borderline believer you're just uncertain you're unsettled you're unsure you're undecided and decided about what you're not certain the prophet said we have to be certain and if we're really certain about the truth we'll be concerned if we're certain that this is the absolute way to the Rapture we're going to we're going to do everything we can to believe it and honor it that's right amen so so to be in a borderline means you're not sure because you're border you're borderline see you just you don't know you're not certain you're unsettled but you don't need to remain unsettled there are going to be those that will be unsettled and will be and will turn and see we're seeing this happen in this day we're seeing Falling Away brother Branham said he saw a falling away before the seals were open they had he said there had to be a falling away there had to be the churches turn against the word they had to be bundled together and then and then bundled together and brought into a great big bundle which is the Council of churches which we can see that happening it's all brother Ram said they're already in it and don't know it foreign amen but the bride has the seals open and she having the understanding because of the word in her she will have a revelation to know who that Antichrist is and who it is that's that's later to be manifested but we know who it is and we're not uncertain about these things thank the Lord that we can be certain ly thank the Lord that we don't have to remain unsettled thank the Lord that we can not don't have to remain unsure and undecided we can know but it depends what's in your heart God had to put that he put that there see you're going to fit in one of those categories that we've been through in this little series amen it's either the real believer that has the revelation of the word the bride or you're going to be those that that are good to the people of God that's in your heart to do it you don't know when you're even doing it but you're you're you're you're considered a virgin but you can't come to the revelation of the word because you lack oil you remain you'll come to the white Throne judgment and you'll be judged according to your works the bride will not stand and be judged at the white Throne I think I've already made that clear I can't go back over all those things if you want it it's it's recorded so you can do what you want turn with numbers and I'm not speaking just to you I don't know who's online too so I'm just going to follow the lord if that's all right and preach like I was preaching to many in here tonight all right all right you just pull and God can speak to your heart amen but we're looking at this hour comes to a dead hour for these borderline Believers it comes to a dead hour and we know that we've received the last message to the Gentiles what we're looking for now the bride is looking for his Rapture the body change we have Rapture in US amen the rides the Rapture has begun in your soul because see everything we have we must have by faith before it's manifested or declared uh be fully manifest it's got to be in by faith first that's why we can say we're righteous and we're going to remain righteous why because it's Revelation to us he that's see so all these things all right now let's read numbers 13th chapter numbers the 13th chapter beginning with the 26th verse and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron this is now he sent over those spies and they went and came to Moses and Aaron and all let me just start with the 21st 25th and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days so it gives you where they were and they went and came to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness apparent to kadish and brought back word unto them and into all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land everyone that went over there saw that there was fruit just exactly what the scripture said they would they saw the fruit and they and they told this is their report they told him and said we came into the land whether thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it so nevertheless the people nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and more moreover we saw the children of anak there that's with the Giants the amalekites that's considered the flesh man always a always a thorn in the flesh to the people of God the amalekites flesh that's what it refers to the considered the flesh man dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and all these ites and amorites you know tormentors dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea in the coast by the coast of Jordan and Caleb just got fed up with it Caleb stilled the people before Moses said let us go up at well sometime later no at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it amen what is he basing that on the word of God he gave him the land all right but but the men that went up with him said now here's your borderline believers there's borderline Believers saw the milk they saw the honey they saw the fruit of it they taste they even tasted it they were partakers of it okay but when the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up remember they were right there with them they would be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we not some what a report and they brought back an evil report of the land see that what were they doing they were reasoning with their Spirit they they were looking at the outward appearance they didn't they weren't receiving the word the promise okay and we're not able to go up against the people they're stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land now what does the land stand for see that stands for our promise all right which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land which through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature either basing that all upon their senses their feelings their Spirit realm not their soul but what's in their soul is speaking out here all right and there and there we saw the Giants the son of anak which come which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight and it goes on they murmured against Moses let's make a captain and and let us return unto Egypt in fifth fourth verse 6th verse of chapter 14. and and Joshua the son of none and Caleb the son of Jeff jeffaniah which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and speak to the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we possess through to search it is an exceeding good land I'm on verse 7 of Chapter 14 verse 8 if the Lord Delight in us then we will then he will bring us into the land and give us a land which floweth with milk and honey only Rebel not against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us their defenses departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fear them not and then the congregation said let's Stone them you may be seated turn with me to Hebrews 6. I think you got the just this I want to just get it to a point there that they admitted they saw the land they saw it was good they saw it float with milk and honey they saw it's what God said it would be they had the fruit of it they tasted it they partook of it they went in the land and partook of the land all right then I want you to go with me to Hebrews chapter 6. and starting with verse 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and laying out of hands and resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit watch the fourth verse I want to come to this for it is impossible for those it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the son of God afresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh offed upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessings from God but that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected so now you have two seeds laying here amen but that which beareth Thorns the weeds and Briars is rejected and nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned amen Hebrews 10. first Hebrews 6 4 there speaking of those borderline Believers that we read about in numbers amen the same thing comes right over into this age right now Hebrews 10. and verse 26 for if we sin willfully after now watch this if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins I want you to notice here the knowledge of the truth doesn't mean they had revelation they had knowledge okay and we'll bring this out Prophet speaks this because that that's quite a thing to people they think well wow if I have a knowledge no now wait a minute brother Adam said they never they never had the revelation they had knowledge something you can read something you can those in numbers we they had a knowledge they had knowledge that it was a good land all right all right now but willfulness comes from the soul he this born of God does not commit sin you make mistakes and have failures but you're not willful in it you can't have God dwelling in you and say you sin because you were willful your willfulness has gone from me you are a new creature you have no willfulness no conscience no desire the prophet said to do anything contrary to the word so these people if they willfully fell they had no revelation of the word for the hour or time though they saw it was a good land they saw the promise but they never had the Holy Spirit dwelling in them okay now be he said but there's remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for a judgment and see look at there's no there is therefore no more sacrifice for sin if they willfully disobey it turn around and walk away from it reject it there's no more sacrifice but a certain fearful looking for a judgment and fiery indignation which shall Devour the adversaries so see that's their end time that's their judgment he that despised Moses law died without Mercy under two or three Witnesses of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified see he's been sanctified an Unholy thing but notice Sanctified he never went in to have the whole never went to the had the Holy Ghost he was on the border they they went over they partook of it they saw it they had a knowledge of it but they never could go over and possess it they willfully turned away you see well you understand all right now he said suppose ye that you thought worthy of who had trodden underfoot the Son of God encountered the blood of the Covenant where which they were Sanctified an Unholy thing and had despite and hath done despite unto the spirit of Grace then I want to jump down down to about verse 38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back I want to get this word drawback thy soul my soul no if any man draw back thy Soul shall have no pleasure in him my soul excuse me my soul shall have no more have no pleasure in him but we we are not of them who draw back under Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul amen amen the word discrepancy I've mentioned this about so I want to mention it again the word discrepancy is a deviation the action of departing from an established course or accepted standard okay our standard the believer's standard is the word God's absolute that's the seeds absolute is the word that's the bride's standard and a discrepancy is a variance or a variation a lack of compatibility compatibility with what the word so it so a discrepancy is a very a variance or a variation all right that's a discrepancy it's it's it's a it's a lack of compatibility or continuity it it you know it can't Unite it's not flowing freely it's not compatible it's a it's a Clash all right we'll come in that in a little bit in James 1 17 you can turn over there if you'd like and just read it again James 1 17. it says every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights you notice that it's not father of light it's Father of Lights little lights off of the father that is light so the bride is light it's the Father of Lights the Bible said we are children of the light okay so it's a Father of Lights with whom is no variableness with whom is no variableness remember this this a a discrepancy is variation okay so there's no variableness neither shadow of turning because the message is God is light and in him is no Darkness if you even drop a variance in there a discrepancy it's no longer it's no longer complete light there's a shadow amen if you if you mix anything with white which is the original color then it turns pale it no longer remains white it goes to death because you've mixed it amen it's a mixture all right so so is no variableness of turning all right so neither shadow of turning and and in the message seed of discrepancy go to paragraph 29 here if you want to write those down or a seed of discrepancy message this was this was preached back in January 18 1965. so ver now he said now this is Harvest Time he said at the beginning when God sowed his seed upon the Earth and gave it in the hearts of the children his family to keep that word that was their only defense keep that word here come the enemy in and broke the barrier by sowing the seed of discrepancy now that's exactly what Satan's been doing all along he sows the seed of discrepancy something contrary let me get back here to what the prophet said I forgot I meant to read that brother brownham said the sowing of the the discrepancy means sowing Discord or being contrary sowing a Discord something different or being contrary to what's already been sowed see being contrary what's already been otherwise the original and so there again we have variance opposition contentions and strife all right so remember in Proverbs 6 19 there's seven there's six things and seven is an Abomination to him and the seventh one was the sowing of Discord all those six and the seven of them make is an Abomination the last one was a sowing of Discord among brethren something different something not the original not the standard just a little variation okay getting back here to seed of discrepancy he said and so he by sowing the seed of discrepancy contrary to the word of God is what Satan did if that was discrepancy in the beginning it's still anything that'll add anything to the word of God is still the seed of discrepancy so we come back to Revelations 22 18 and 19 you can't add or take away when you do it's a seed of discrepancy all right I don't care where it comes from if it's from organization if it's from military sources if it's from political Powers anything that's contrary to the word of God is the seed of discrepancy all right that's that's what we must remember see the word is our absolute anything that adds to or takes from that our message Moses in in Deuteronomy I'll go over there real quick in Deuteronomy the fourth chapter Moses said now hearken o Israel unto the statutes and in the judgments which I teach you for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you you shall not add unto the word which I command you now that Prophet said You shall not add to it our Prophet said the same thing he was a Vindicated Prophet had the interpretation of the word for the season then we must not add to or take from that word we can't put our opinion to it and put our own thinking to it see if you do so it's the seed of discrepancy it's a discrepancy and I believe if God's in you and and that should begin to happen he's going to show you that he's a discerner he's going to show you that's discrepancy amen how many have that confidence in the word amen see that's that's the seed of discrepancy you're stepping into something that's not according to the word taking another man's opinion what they think the devil offered to Eve the discrepancy through her reasoning through her senses through her emotional Realm amen Satan could offer something to look beautiful more beautiful and more repealing reasoning than the word of God and got her to fall by one word it was discrepancy then it's discrepancy now amen all right so you shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall you diminish ought from it how many believe that's the message of it we have today was Son of God amen all right see he said you know you shall not diminish art from it that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal peor see for all the men that follow Bill pior the Lord thy God has destroyed them from among you their names are blotted out amen amen been removed see because they went and followed something that was discrepancy wasn't according to the word of God wasn't according to what Moses had taught them being a Vindicated Prophet they took the teaching of Balaam which was a false prophet and his teaching was discrepancy and it's very clear today we have the same Spirits Among Us they come right down and sit right in and spots in your Feast of Charity too they'll set right Among Us what is that oh yeah Amber Alerts okay okay yeah I know it yeah okay anyway we'll continue I'll tell you through this series you talk about the devil fighting you don't know what I've been through with this yeah he didn't want this out people don't like to be challenged that way because they it it stirs something inside of them it doesn't look appealing it's not reasoning no Beauty we desire him but it's the truth amen amen so we'll just preach at the three or four if we do not preach it you know I don't care the numbers don't mean anything God knew who would be here and you're sitting right where God knew you'd be and he brought you here you think you brought yourself you didn't bring yourself here amen all right but therefore keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nation see in the Nations there were other nations because Israel's a nation but to us it's denominations it's a spirit of discrepancy all right now but see but those those were destroyed from among you but ye that did cleave unto the Lord ye that did believe ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day you weren't separated oh my such straight words huh all right so so we see there's no you can't mix you just can't mix the word of God with anything it just doesn't mix God's word will never mix and when a man has been born again by the word of God predestinated to eternal life called the elected what will it be it'll be word of God on top of word word on word word on word not a denominational Creed and then a word and then a Creed and then a word you see what the devil's trying to do mixing it wanting to mix it bring in something else mix it with the word oh I believe God sent a prophet that's not enough what did he say and you've got to enter into that and let that word become alive in you and only the Holy Ghost can do that all right so so word on top of word word on top of word word that's the believer's walk see and it and and not denominational Creed then a word then a Creed then a word it won't work you can't have that leaven in it only one eternal life Jesus Christ the word and this is a record that he's given us eternal life and this life this life is in his son so there's only one record of eternal life that's in his son and he that hath the son is has the New Birth because the new birth is that revelation of the son and you amen so the you you you have that life he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son hath not a life amen see so if you have the son and have life they're no longer Twain now you're one with with the father with the word amen that's we could go into other scriptures but that's Saint John 15 7 Saint John 14 20. see all right now getting back here let's Okay so we can't have a shadow it's not a shadow to it see now I want to continue on paragraph 39 of seed of discrepancy I said yeah page paragraph 39 yes and a genuine Faith Of God will believe in God and God is the word it'll never add nothing to it the Bible tells us if we add one word or take one word away our part will be taken from The Book of Life revelation 22 18. and then paragraph and then uh it just I'll just read you know he said the first of the book in the beginning the first the book God told him not to break one word of that every word must be kept that word must slip they must live that word Jesus in the middle book came along and said and said in his that in his age man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God and the closing age of Revelation our our time in our day we're in foretold us that whosoever shall take one word out of the book or add one word to it his part will be taken from The Book of Life see can't you can't mix it therefore there can be nothing shadowy therefore there can be nothing shadowy just a genuine unadulterated word of God that's sons of God Daughters of God who's not born by the will of man or a shaking hand or some form of baptism but born but born in the spirit of God by the Holy Ghost and the word manifesting itself through them that's genuine seed of God amen all right we'll come back to more of that in in just a moment all right so you can't have nothing shadowy in first John 4. now the Bible said let me just say the I mean the prophet said excuse me the Bible the prophet that these these that have just a form of godliness that they don't have the true Revelation they are not able to receive the true revelation of the men referring to Second Timothy 3 8. they have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof see so you can't and then what are they denying the true revelation of the word for the season the time the hour you start bringing that that's what brings the separation see God's always been separating light from Darkness truth mayor amen he does it how by his word by his word the revelation of his word for the season is what he always separates with the true Revelation they don't have that true revelation of the message he brought not being born again you've got to be born again to understand or hear what the prophet's saying about the yeah what the prophet what the word of word or God is saying see he said not being born again they don't have the Revelation that those that have that form they just have a form and knowledge you can have knowledge and have the form it's like the truth like the real but it isn't the real you see that's what it is all right so you see and how can you have the real here again I'm saying without the Holy Ghost dwelling in you you can't have the real because the Holy Ghost in you is the real all right so now or have this you they don't have the seed of God and if they don't have the seed of God how can they be born again they've got to have the seed all right so the the Holy Ghost is sent to Quicken that seed he's the quickener of the word he brings the word to life and he brings that word predestinated word to life in its season that's the reason the the rain that fell on the just and the unjust was the Holy Ghost so both weed and wheat were both anointed but whatever the seed is is what you'll be because the seed brings forth of its kind amen so under the same anointing they're both anointed remember the weed and the seed are are weed and wheat God's seed and Satan's seed let's put it that way are both anointed by the Holy Spirit but what makes them faults amen is what's inside their soul not the anointing but if there's no seed there and there's a s and there's a seed of discrepancy in their soul than what they're going to bring forth is discrepancy because they don't have the Holy Ghost abiding in them that's not dwelling in them that's why they'll go out and do things that are a little shady and yet profess to be message Believers and yet Shady because they don't have discernment of the difference amen I'm not saying I know who is and who isn't but I Know Who I Am by the revelation of God given to me personally identified in me personally go back to Christ the mystery of God revealed and see he said he'll make himself known to an individual and vindicate himself in that individual that individual in no he will where he belongs and who he is but without that revelation amen of the word for the season then if that Revelation isn't there which is Jesus Christ in you then it's another then it's something else now I don't know who can come to life and who can who can be born again who can't I'm just saying they will that's the way it'll be amen all right but we preach the word trusting it every one of them can be delivered I don't desire anybody to be lost that's not my purpose of ministry I'm the purpose of my Ministries to bring the truth that will set you free you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free to reject truth is bondage to receive the truth until the light comes on and said oh I see it I see my way isn't right now it determines what's in your soul whether you can receive it or not understand how many understands what I just said all right when light comes on your pathway and you refuse to walk in the light you have a choice to make the seed of God will walk in the light they will hear my voice a stranger they won't follow amen all right now so we we see here now first in in first John 4 4 in first John 4 4 we go over there very familiar scripture you are of God see little children see first John 4 4 seemed like my hands are cold my fingers and I can't turn the pages like I want to all right ye are of God little children and have overcome them this is first John 4 4 overcome them who Antichrist seed of discrepancy you've overcome the seed of discrepancy because greater Is He And into a person that's in you than he that's in the world okay they are of the world he that's in the world they of the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world what are they speaking what's in their heart with the mouth see they they're speaking with the with the with the heart and with the mouth they speak what's in their heart all right see we are but they of the world and the world heareth them we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us thereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error now First Corinthians in over in First Corinthians chapter 1 we find a very similar thing here first Corinthians 1 verse 12. now we have received not the spirit of the world but we receive the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God so therefore we have the spirit of God we have discernment to know the spirit of air and the spirit of Truth we're knowing your position and who you are knowing that the word is in your mouth the word of faith those that can't hear that word because the final voice is it the bride is the final voice not another voice the voice of the word for the season the voice that came through the mouth the Prophet this Prophet will say the same the bride will say the same thing and if they can't hear that then we know the spirit of air amen huh what First Corinthians two twelve 212. I'm sorry I said 112 I'm sorry now we have received not the spirit of God they're seeing excuse me not the spirit of the world but we have but but the spirit which is of god that we might know that know the things that are freely given to us of God how are we going to know them by the spirit of God how are we going to know Heir by the spirit of God how are we going to know Truth by the spirit of God amen because that seed that's in you cannot and that's the quickener of that seed then if that seed's quickened what's in you it's Jesus Christ revealed it's the word revealed I'll build my church Upon This Rock and the gates of hell can't Prevail against that revelation all right so we see then in verse 13 which things also we speak isn't that just what first John 4 6 said which thing we are of God which things also we speak not in The Words which men's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teaches so it's the wisdom of the world it's not the wisdom of of seminaries it's not the wisdom of man it's the wisdom of God which we speak it's a Word of Faith it's revelation and what Cain hated Abel about was that Abel had revelation amen and God said that's my way that's how I deal with the people that's what I'll bring forth in every age I'll identify those and accept those and recognize those that have the revelation of my word because that's me in them all right now which things we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches that's the world's language see but but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things was spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are revealed spiritually discerned amen said he that knoweth God heareth us all right just wanted to drop that in all right now so with that in our hearts knowing that's there see then Jesus Jesus said I am my father one amen Saint John 10. see he my father's given them me amen all right then that means that shows that we are one when you get that Revelation that you and God are one you and your father are one nothing's going to shake that out nothing can shake it out you're not Twain You're one Prophet said they're no more Twain talking about the bride today after the opening of the seal they are no more Twain They Are One all right now uh I just let's go to Jude a minute just over here to Jude real quick in Jude of course the one chapter in Jude so I want to read I could read a lot out of this but I think I'll just read uh from verse 11. woven to them for they have gone in the way of Cain see discrepancy now ran greedily at the heir of Balaam his teaching we're all one no we're not all one see we can show you scripture on that where God said they're not amongst the Nations I've separated them from that they're not all one I don't care where that Spirit Rises up that discrepancy you're not one with it it's the spirit isn't people it's the spirit like we stead Sunday and some weren't here but Sunday we said well well brother they say well what's wrong with Fellowship we're supposed to fellowship with them aren't we no see no it's a seed of discrepancy there's no Fellowship between the seed of discrepancy and the word we could go back to First Corinthians right here and I'll just refer to it real quickly you don't have to turn but unsay I mean second Corinthians chapter six it said right there it said it said wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I'll receive you see see because the spirit of foreign spiritual fornication is idolatry that's simple you were there Sunday I think we we covered that and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God and God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people see and how can two be not unequally yoked together see with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with Darkness I'm not saying be nice to him and not talking about that I'm talking about a Divine Fellowship there's no Fellowship there there's no Oneness there we're not one because we happen to believe both with the group see and and want to come well what's wrong we all believe the same thing we believe the same Prophet we do this we're all we all related we all believe the same God will come together let's Feast no watch what Jude said he said these are he said the air greedily off the air of Balaam for reward and perished in the gain seeing of core what did Cora do he rose up the gun see authority of the prophet of his word of his message see while you make yourself only the only Holy One among us see all right you could go back into read more about that verse 12 these are spots in your Feast of charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without reverence no fear see clouds they are without water carried about with winds just moved over every little doctor and every little thing come along trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots what are these spots they're mixing the world with the with the message they're mixing psychology with the message come out of it and be separate they want to you know here's the thing God said you know just like this situation where you say well God God said there's a measure of suffering for the people of God how many know that's true yeah we have to go through trials and tests brother Branham even said what's better than comfort and peace is trials and tribulations that's what he said what's better he said because it brings out something out of you bringing and God knows how to do that but what about those ones that go out here not not considering what God's plan is and said why dear one you don't have to suffer like that you don't have to go through these kind of things and what are they dealing in the realm of the spirit Realm all of us just bring Comfort not knowing what they're doing they're working right against the will of God because Brother Brad said you better be careful who you pray for and how you'd cast that devil off of them like that he said because God may be allowed that to come upon them working with them to bring them to a position of recognition buy that and through that unless you know that for sure don't you do that see you're working right against the very plan of God God brought these things he said it's a struggle to live in this time in this hour sure we believe the word sure we believe that God will deliver but God uses these things and we'll be unto us we go back and try to remove what God's trying to do we better be careful what we're doing and a lot of these books so-called psychology books they got out today want to push that thing upon the people and and dwell in that Spirit realm that's exactly what the devil did he brought to to Eve something that looked reasonable something that looked like this you don't have to go through that why little one now let me hear let me explain to you what God meant be careful we're walking don't don't accept anything that works against the word of God the plan of God what God Said but they're not Consulting the prophet like David did he put the put the Ark on a new cart and never consulted the word that was in the midst of them Nathan the prophet until he woke up and said wait a minute something's wrong here this this arc on a new cart just killed two men it stumbled they tried to well we need to protect the word see how subtle Satan is he makes it look real reasoning and that's what that's what these a lot of these self-help books we we have a perfect word we have a perfect Deliverance through the word why don't we just stay with the word and go back and consult what God used to bring the interpretation of the word in our day and consult what that Prophet said about it instead we try to mix it you can't mix it all right I know that doesn't set with so it was some but anyway I don't mean here so much but I know that's anyway it doesn't matter doesn't matter to me because I'm not responsible how they re how they respond all right now let's get here okay so there's spots in your Feast while they feed with you Raging Waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom the reserve the Blackness and darkness forever now we've read the rest of this because Enoch comes with ten thousands of its Saints see they they already were with him through the millennium they come out here to execute judgment upon all and to convince convict convince means to convict all that are ungodly among them and all their ungodly Deeds among them and all their ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed and all their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him these are murmurs complainers walking after their own lust with their mouth speaking great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage oh my all right let's go on a little further let's turn to Matthew 25. remember keep unspotted from the world it takes the holy spirit in you to recognize questionable things you remember speaking about questionable things stay away from questionable things avoid it amen because those questionable things if they're questionable let them alone don't mix it amen no mixing Satan will try to look make it look reasonable try to make it look beautiful that seed of discrepancy very much to the human flesh person looks beautiful reasonable but the Holy Spirit In You Will will show you what's questionable and then leave it alone amen Matthew 25 I'm just hearing through this and and I just want to get done with it so Matthew 25 now we read portions of that in this series but we'll just we we just want to touch on this not in Matthew 25 and we'll go back to to this is the works that God's judging by scriptural works and he said and let's start with verse 41. now he's dealt with those on the right hand and and said how you fed me and how you you clothed me and how you did these things and they didn't even know about it they weren't even they didn't even realize when they did it and they said what we did this unto you when did we do this unto you when you did it to the least of my brethren you did it to me and his Brethren was his bride in this scripture the Brethren is bride all right then then we find in verse 41 he said then shall he say also to them on the left hand now that was not as sheep these were goats now this isn't the Sheep that's there because brother Brown said as a Shepherd he's separating sheep the Sheep the sheep that heard his voice and came out and the first resurrection was the bride she's sitting with him in the throne but these are not sheep but as sheep and as goats he's 71 on the right hand and one on the left but he says to them on the left depart from me you cursed into Everlasting fire this is the discrepancy see speaking to prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you called me not sick in prison you you visited me not see they had the same opportunity they met the word not even knowing it was Christ but they had it in their heart to not do nothing but these others had it in their heart to do it not even knowing what they were doing not even realizing what they're doing but they had it in their heart don't you miss this they had it in their heart to do that God predestinated and placed that in them to do it and because of that because of that their name was found on the Lamb's Book of Life or The Book of Life the same book and they received and they were given life at the white Throne judgment because they were good to the people of God helped them in the time of need fed them clothed them not even knowing that they were doing it to Christ but had it in their heart to help this person not even knowing why and I'm talking about people not even born again I'm talking about people not you going out and say well I'm going to do this I'll get life doing it no sir they didn't even know when they did it but they did it because it was in their heart to do it and this thing God put it in their heart to do that but they did it acted upon that and God's rewarding them for it see us all his achievements all is doing he he's Sovereign in what he does you've got to recognize God is sovereign in dealing with his people God dealing with his creation he's Sovereign what he does with him and he does nothing just by chance and by by a whim he does it by foreknowledge all right so we come back here you want to keep your like you said keep your garments unspotted stay away from questionable things keep them clean see but Matthew 25 41 and he said let's go to 42. 41 said depart for me you curse okay for I was hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and imprisoned and you visited me not then they shall also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them and say verily I say unto you in so much that you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous unto into life eternal so there's righteous in the Judgment other than bride that was already covered back on the 30th of November all right now I want to go some quotes here in the in the church AIDS book paragraph 128 to start with in this series on the Sardis Sardis Church age that's where I'm at paragraph 138 reading from here and I want that known because I know people listening online follow very close to this church age book so paragraph 138 I'm I'm sorry 128 excuse me 128. at the last part of that quote but it is even as most accurately set forth in Psalm 69 which you could read later that it is the wicked or unrighteous rejecters of Christ unrighteous rejectors of Christ and destroyers of his people whose names are removed all right okay now then we go to we'll jump ahead here to paragraph 144 a 141 excuse me paragraph 141 and it says here let me just read it the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death this is at the end of the Thousand Years when all the rest of the Dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death now we do not need to guess about those who in the second death are given life we are told it is given to them in the grounds that they have been kind and good unto the brethren if you want to know who the Brethren would go you can go back to paragraph 161 and find it out but since this is the word oh excuse me the Brethren those who are raised and cast into the Lake of Fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the brethren all right since this is the word of God we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of facts see where Faith lays so being unto me according to Thy word this this is what the prophet is saying amen amen all right now we go to paragraph 143. of that message same message and he says but upon the grounds but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal eternal life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride now he's speaking of those righteous I'm reading this to bring it out what I want to bring out in it he's talking about the righteous and the Judgment not bride those that are because but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren they are not his Brethren that would make them joint heirs with Jesus they are not Heirs of anything but life they share No throne with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed you see now because of their love for the people of God they are recognized and saved no doubt they served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and gabelia they stood for the children in time of trouble yeah I went I went and showed other things there in that Wednesday service so you just have to go back and pick all that up but here's what I want to get to it if this seems to be a smack to a restoration which watch carefully now for the wicked are not restored but turned into the Lake of Fire and those unrighteous the names of many of those destroyed were in The Book of Life such as Judas they were in the book of life such as different one we can name them in the Bible they were in there they had their name recorded but also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were the Living manifested Word and living Epistles for their day amen now you see you see is now okay then we go to paragraph 149. all these people had their names in The Book of Life and their names remain but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the Lake of Fire amen all right now that's not an easy thing that's not a happy thing to say but that's the truth so we must be careful we're down here in the opening of this word where the truth has been brought out unveiled to us amen amen to the bride this message has this book's been opened Revelation 10 is the third poll and you're that third pull you are that opened word amen you are that record Amen in that record that record the bride record that name because of course can never be removed that's the bride record that's right amen and that record is a section of that book that record is another record within that book amen and and it shows itself in Revelations 10 2. it's a little book whose names are in that book it's just the names of his bride and he takes the book and opens the book to claim what he had already redeemed here we are in the day see so no wonder the spirit of discrepancy raises up has spots in your the Feast of the of this charity see he's just feasting right among you okay I've got to get going because I want to bring out Judas which expresses a lot of this before you what's happening because he would had his name in the book and removed why was it removed brother Brown shows you here they weren't they they fought the children of God they were they never they well we just read it I want to go through it again all right now paragraph 153 so we have one we have the bride we have they're found in a section of the book then we have another class that get eternal life which is also righteous ones like the foolish virgins and those that were good to the people of God the foolish virgins which remain virgins and they help the people of God but they never themselves had the revelation of the word for the hour but yet there were good sanctified people they come right up in the message and believe it and help the bride right on through instead of fighting them they were a help to them now how what made the difference here's one Sanctified that were removed I breeded in in Hebrews 6 and 10. sanctified people but then lost their sanctification trampled and under feet the very blood that Sanctified him put Christ to an open shame the second time I indict this generation for the second crucifixion the prophet said see all right and they were Sanctified why didn't they retain it and why did the foolish virgin which was also Sanctified retained it because brother Branham said the foolish virgin retained the virginity they kept their garments clean even when they went out into tribulation though they had to go out to be purged and hunted like dogs and give their life they refused to be spotted they didn't give in to that hierarchy see all right all right now so paragraph 153 and brother Brown said okay so you see that second class of people which should not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system that died for their faith even though they are not the bride and having been and not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life okay are you with me thirdly he said then there are the borderline Christians such as we have saw in Israel coming out of Egypt they had their names in The Book of Life and their Works written in the books these having failed to obey God I want you to get that point right there these having failed to obey God and being void of the spirit though even signs the signs and wonders were amongst them will have their names removed from the book of life and amongst this group will be ones like Judas who though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have manifestation in their lives you see where the Deception comes in see because they're anointed by The Same Spirit you're anointed by but the word is not in their soul for that anointing to come to but it anoints a weed and the weed grows up and becomes what it is religious anointed to cast out Devils shout and speak in tongues and see these things but never able to come to the true revelation of the word for the season they can't receive it amen amen see see it's it's difficult because God is bringing this truth and what's it doing it's exposing the prophet said nobody wants to be exposed that's in our humanness nobody wants to to be exposed to something that's untruth and kind of hidden in the in their lives all along and now exposed but when it's exposed is for deliverance because there's only one deliverer and only one place of Deliverance that's in Christ and you can't you can't have a little discrepancy here and have it mix and have one thing and another mix together here and expect to make a rapture you won't make it and those that don't make the Rapture come up with the second Resurrection are found in the judgment they miss their millennium only only the bride will be in the rapture she's a part of it that's why you must be born again don't take a question don't don't come up and say you say well I don't know God doesn't want God wants to reveal that to you he just expecting you to lose sight of yourself say God I can't do anything about this it's either you feel me or I'm just gonna you'll find a pop of Bones here I pray God give us desperation make us desperate for you amen that's exactly right amen help us to learn to be dependent on you commit everything to you and wait on you that's the thing we get too impatient we got to wait on God so we see here so we see here amongst the group be like Judas who entirely void will have manifestation of their lives void of the Spirit dwelling in them though on the books were not elected in him such as Balaam will be in this group see all right now let's go back to paragraph 129. we'll find up here's something as Israel chosen people of God as Israel a chosen people of God in the majority forfeited their rights in the Book of Life by rejecting Jesus so the majority of the Gentile church will also come into condemnation with the resultant removal of their names in The Book of Life he's saying the majority the majority of the Gentile church will also come into condemnation remember a bride comes out of the church a church left Egypt a great majority didn't want to cross over but three two out of that that original two million were able to cross over into land because they believed what God spoke the rest of them had their names removed Jesus they said well we ate man in the wilderness and Jesus said in their everyone dead remember that eternally separated why because they refuse the Word of Promise and rejected it and took their reasoning and took their own ideas and and Mick tried to mix it and then later on said oh we made an heir we we need to go up no they were already removed and Moses said don't even try to go up and when they did what happened they they killed many of them and they wandered in the wilderness 40 years until that generation died off and another generation come up that did accept the promise of the word and went in amen all right a lot could be said on much of what I'm saying it's just making you statements hitting the high points you go back and study over what the prophet said he brings it out right perfectly all right so majority of the Gentile Church will also come to condemnation with the resultant removal of their names from The Book of Life by rejecting the word and thereby entering into the world echem economical movement which is the image erected unto the Beast now remember these people these people that came out of Egypt for Canaan land they all came out under the blood of the sacrificial lamb they all went through the waters of baptism in the Red Sea they all enjoyed the mighty Miracles all eight of the Manna all drank of The Rock and so far as obvious external blessings and manifestation were concerned they all partook in like an equal manner they partook of it they had knowledge of it they were enlightened they knew it was right as far as knowledge goes but what happened then they turned away and so made it and couldn't cross over they all they said partook and like manner but when they came to Moab those who joined in the feasts of Baal peor or accepted balaam's Doctrine committed what spiritual fornication they partook of another seed a discrepancy and they died their carcasses fell in the wilderness for it was there that they refused that they refused the word of God and turned from it and he said that is what Hebrews 6 1-9 speaks of which was brought out so carefully he said in the pergaman church age so you can go back to pergami and I don't have time I I got places marked in there all right so so let's go back here said what he said now we you know brother Bram said you know I am already over time you know we're living in the end time it is in this age that the churches are going to come together and as they are even now controlling World politics they will soon control the finances of the world he said now they're controlling World politics okay they will control the finances of the world I see where the pope is going to reinvent the Catholic church now why because those little the lens that they can't agree with on the Protestants have got to be done away with he's going to reinvent it so they can come together they've got to you see all this is happening very quickly right under and the bride's saying hallelujah I see it the others say don't know what's happening I'm talking about people in the message don't know what's happening see here it is right here now watch what he says then if they and then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches and I'm I'm afraid there's going to be some in this message that will that will come to judgment and will be and will be disappointed at judgment they've done a good life they've been good to people they've done all these things they believe God sent a prophet they go back and all these things and lift him up and and and worship him a discrepancy and be disappointed in judgment because they tied in with that organization watch this he said you will lose all you won't be able to buy or sell if you don't belong to the world organized organized they send up churches they're going to let you go ahead and believe a prophet if you want to but you're going to do what they tell you to do you got to join with them see and to join with them is the same thing they did at the Feast of bail peor we're all one why not join together that's exactly the Pope's words right now that's what he's doing that's what he's moving for all right and and there's going to be those that seem to be very good the majority well I won't go any further I could I could Point some things out but maybe not too good to say right here you those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church orders will be physically bereft now I know that that foolish virgin is going to go through that brother Branham said and I think it's his first seal paragraph 359 he said he will not allow his bride have her go through that time so if that's the case how close are we now amen boy we've got to know he said you've got to keep your garments those to keep their garments clean they will be presented there will be it presented to them a great temptation to give in Preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist be system they will give in to flatteries and blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow these false Shepherds right into the slaughter but in the Judgment they will be found naked they will not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in the spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here then expect to be with God amen you can't do it see oh my all right now let's look at a couple things here and then then we're gonna have to close on paragraph 111 of the church age book let me just bring these few quotes here real quickly out paragraph 111 concerning Judas what he said here and then in the seat of discrepancy now if now if language means anything at all we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus John 13 18. he was all right his name was put on The Book of Life yet he was not clean John 13 10-11 Judas was also given to Jesus by the Father John 17 12 Let It Be noted here that the choosing and giving is the exact parallel as the illustration of Moses and pharaoh Jacob and Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh were both foreknown they were not they were predestinated to wrath while the end of Moses and Jacob was glorification first Peter 2 8-9 shows both reprobates and elect even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto they also were appointed but you are a chosen generation speaking to the elect Judas was numbered with the twelve and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to Pentecost okay we know that's true the Bible says for he was numbered with us and obtained part of the ministry the part that Judas obtained amongst the twelve and then lost was not inferior to the ministries of other 11 nor was it a devilish foreign Ministry injected among the ministry of others amen Judas paragraph 113 Judas a devil lost god-given holy loss a god-given holy ghost Ministry and killed himself amen and went to his own place his name was even in the book of life but his name was blotted out okay paragraph 113. okay I just read that excuse me 121. paragraph 121. there are people who seem involved in the things of God almost 100 percent they are like Judas no one but Jesus no one but but Jesus knew exactly what kind of a person Judas was now notice Judas wasn't out here so we're not talking about people out here in the denomination we're talking about people right amongst the Believers of the message they were involved in the things of God all right so the day came that Judas did exactly what Israel did at bail peor he decided that he wanted to join with the false Vine forces enter into Financial political organization of anti-word antichrist religion and he did so he was fooled the other 11 were not they could not be for they were the very elect so when Judas left and betrayed the Lord his name was removed from The Book of Life revelation 22 19. okay so he was removed and I had Deuteronomy 4 which I've already read to you now I'm sure that you've noticed chapter verse or paragraph 122 now I'm sure that you've noticed that those whose names were in The Book of Life were a part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God and worship of him though they did not worship according to truth what is true worship is spirit and Truth together you cannot worship God unless you have Dynamics and the mechanics the word together there's only one way to truly worship God is when the spirit and the word come together that's true worship that's true worship when the spirit and the word come together they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth amen you say well I worship in spirits not good and then Slide by the word a little bit while I worship in the word I have the word but no Spirit still no good this bride will be both mechanics and Dynamics a true worshiper every day we worship God not just in church every day we worship Him in spirit and in truth all right now and they did not worship according to truth well like Judas they didn't go all the way how Judas was chosen of how see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth knowledge he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in Jesus name but when The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he couldn't Prophet said he could not he was devoid of the spirit he did not go to receive the Holy Spirit he couldn't he had nothing in him to be born again see only the bride can be reborn again because she has that spirit in her to be quickened I mean the seed in her to be quickened in non-elect there's nothing in them to be quickened so if you have a pull to God as we said then yield to that pull you wouldn't have a desire for more of God or have a desire for God unless God put that in you desire him he had to have a desire for you before you could have a desire for him and if you've got that desire for him then yield to that desire and you're only going to find one thing to satisfy that desire and that will be the word for its season the scriptures and the message you don't have to live under that privilege you have you have every right to be born Anew don't let the devil say well I can't make it that shows you you can or the devil wouldn't be telling you you couldn't that's right all right God won't tell you he can't you can't God's telling you who will not but he's not telling you you can't amen so press on go in I want more I want God then take him he's yours come according to the way he said to come start feeding on the source of life amen I'm making these comments I know time is running it's like the clock in the football game you know it don't stop or it does stop actually okay 122. okay I'm reading that make no mistake about it and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off of The Book of Life but if you're born again and are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you'll be in the word all the way that's the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost you won't leave the word you'll discern it all right now I can speak a lot about the real gift we spoke about that you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost and still be lost okay I can give you quotes on that if you want we read it Sunday all right now I think oh no one more thing here just just one more thing just give me about five minutes okay now Judas or seed of discrepancy had no real faith okay let's let's find out what real faith is so first of all we go to paragraph 38 of the seed of discrepancy well not only page 38 let's let's go back here um yeah 36. so it finally headed up in Judas Iscariot and Jesus Christ Jesus was the seed of God he's beginning of the creation of God he was nothing less than God and Judas Iscariot was born the Son of Perdition Come From Hell returned to Hell Jesus Christ was the Son of God the word of God made manifest Judas Iscariot in his discrepancy was the seed of the devil come to the world for deceit see come to the world for deceit just like he was the beginning like he was at the beginning Cain his former father Judas only played church this is paragraph 36 of seated discrepancy he said Judas only played Church there there wasn't really he wasn't really sincere he didn't actually have faith he had never betrayed Jesus but you see he sold the seed of discrepancy he thought that he could make friends with the world Mammon and have friendship with Jesus but it was too late for him to do anything about it when the dead hour came the dead hour remember the dead hour came when he did this evil thing he crossed the separating line between going forward and returning back and that's that comes to a lot of people amen so let's make our calling and election sure how by letting God do his work in you for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure then what what's to work out your own salvation submit yourself completely to God because your salvation is in him amen and if it's God which worketh in you then give yourself completely to him quit your murmuring and place the word before you holding forth the Word of Life see that you've not run in vain nor labored in vain hold forth That Word of Life Amen Let God do that work yield to him completely give over to him completely say here's my need Lord here it is I don't know what to do but I'm giving it over to you my children and everything I own in my house come in and take possession I'm applying the token I'm walking with you this is your will I give it to you show me what I should do put your finger on things that are not right and I will obey you the way you lead me work out your own salvation amen yes you certainly can't figure it out you certainly can't produce it you've got to allow him to do it because brother Branham said he's in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure and then he said then brother Brown said if you'll let him do it see so it's a submission it's a surrender amen he's not you trying to figure out your salvation and do some kind of works to work it out that's not what it's talking about because the next verse says for it is God which worketh in you that's your salvation amen all right now Judas played Church the dead hour came okay now I he and he thought he could make himself a piece of money would be popular among the people and if that doesn't cause so many people getting that discrepancy trying to find favor with man let's find favor with God not with man That's What Judas done when the discrepancies headed up in him amen that's what he done when the discrepancies headed up see he had that to do Judas you think Judas knew he thought he was doing the will of God he thought he was doing right yeah he thought he was doing a favor amen amen he had no Revelation no real faith because he said if he did he wouldn't have done what he did all right now and we know that Jesus was the word in the beginning was the word of God the word was with God the Word was God and the word is made flesh and dwelled among us then the word is a seed then the seed became flesh and dwelled among us if Judas was the seed of the enemy the discrepancy it also became flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of Judas Iscariot and it's also become flesh and dwelling among us today right amongst the message because there's three kinds of believers there's going to be that discrepancy but God's wanting you to see recognize it amen uncover it because that's what the seal did it uncovered the devil and showed you who you are and who he is all right you're his hidden Mystery see you are his hidden Mystery uncovered you're the open word the bride is all right now if Judas was the seed of the enemy discrepancy okay he had no he never had no real real Faith but I'm trying to emphasize something here this discrepancy he had what he thought was a faith there's such a thing as having faith and a make-believe Faith there is such a thing see and a genuine faith that God will believe in God and God is a word it'll never take nothing add nothing to it okay I've already read that therefore nothing shadowy amen Judas paragraph 44 Judas had no real Faith he had a make-believe faith faith that he thought was the son of God but he didn't know it was the son of God now let's go over here and find out real quick notice the great paragraph 61 notice the great thing okay Balaam did now it did when on and on finally end in the coming of Judas Iscariot and Jesus see it was Jacob and Esau we could bring It Right Down the Line all right Judas and Jesus is exactly a figure of Cain and Abel for Judas was was for as Judas was religious so was Cain religious Cain built an altar he made a sacrifice he weren't you know what an altar is he built the church okay he built a church he made a sacrifice he worshiped God he was just as sincere in it as Abel was but you see he didn't have the revelation of what the word was there's the difference There's real faith real Faith Judas had no revelation Abel by Revelation Cain thought it was Adam and Eve eat some apples or some fruit Able by Revelation note it was wrong it was blood that brought them out and he offered a lamb God testified his offering was right then he got jealous and tried to kill his brother and as as he killed his brother upon the same altar his sacrifice died on the lamb the lamb died on the altar so Judas Iscariot betrayed betrayed Jesus Christ upon the altar of God and killed him just as Cain killed Abel became was the seed of discrepancy amen so we find then that the seed of discrepancy is very religious but it does not have Revelation paragraph 26 of my message here says now we see this was the true with Cain and Abel when when Cain saw that Abel's sacrifice was received and I might stop here to say why did God receive his sacrifice why did God receive Abel's sacrifice because by Revelation he understood it was not apples see it was blood which it really was and Able by Revelation brother Brahm said Faith Abel by Revelation Faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testified by it he was righteous and the whole church is built upon divine revelation of the word of God till where is righteousness where's the bride's righteousness it's in the revelation of the word that's what he accepts he already showed it right there God doesn't change all right you're with me this message in in Hebrews he says the man who comes to a knowledge remember they never got it they were borderline Believers after we have received the knowledge of the word of God you get it from a knowledge from reading and seeing it and then reject it then it's impossible for you would ever be saved did you read that now have a have received a knowledge of Truth you understand it you never got it you just understand it what's he saying intellectually you understand it intellectually but you never got it and because you never got it and had the knowledge of it and he said you've tasted it you were enlightened brother Brown said the rain fell on you you were enlightened but you weren't the seed but it did fall on the seed amen all right so so I'm just bringing out to what enlightenment knowledge of the truth tasted but brother Brown said tasted but not filled with the Holy Ghost but you tasted it they tasted it they had the fruit they sought all these things see they had the knowledge that it was a good land every bit of that okay then Brother Brad said willfully was to come to that borderline and refuse to go over that was the willfulness refused to come completely believe in the soul just like them was in the time of Joshua all right now we find that every time I'm closing we find that every time that there's that that the two come together there's a Clash now watch this and we now now we find always that when these natural and spiritual spirits of churches and organizations meet with the spirit with the with the natural and spiritual when those two when the natural and spiritual spirits and spirits of churches not spiritual and spirits of churches and organizations meet there's always a Clash it's never failed to be so it's always clashes and if they cannot the other side get the spirit take it by a political power or they substitute something to upset the people's minds that's your emotional realm your mind your spirit That's what Satan did with Eve then then they substitute something to upset the people's mind to just draw disciples after themselves okay who are those you read if you read I'm not going to read it but second Timothy 3 you know heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth speakers false accusers incontinent despises of those that are good having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof these are they that lead silly women Laden with diverse lust amen never ever learning that never able to come to the true Revelation or knowledge of the truth who is it that does that this net Church natural amen they're rising up they raise up thinking they're doing the will of God but mixing the message with other things and then bringing it to the people influencing others leading those that are so caught up in in this society and that Society be careful that we're not so caught up that we fail to have time for the word it's Satan's business to do that amen don't be a silly woman men or women those that did turn down the word are coming over here and leading those that and and presenting everything else and taking and taking away from the word instead of bringing you to the word removing your time removing everything you're you've got so busyness and so busy and so busy as Satan's doing that you learn you'd lose focus of where you should be and there's a Clash the spiritual notice Abel by faith in God the carnal believer thought it was The Works see and so what happened it made a clash we find Abraham and lot had a clash we find Moses and Nathan and Cora had a clash same Clash he was Moses the leader of the hour Vindicated leader amen and Cora being carnal wanted to raise up an organization among them he wanted to make a group of man and God doesn't deal with people like that it shows right there the scripture type of our journey now that organization is not what God ordains in other words the whole congregation is Holy why you say you're the only holy man you have no right to do that do only do any such as that you try to make yourself somebody big we're all holy we're all children God's children see see what that discrepancy does God said separate yourself from him I've had enough of it and he swallowed him up in the earth and that's what's happening now people are being swallowed up in the Earth fleshly desires Etc of the earth they're swallowed the Earth is swallowing them up the bride is going on with God she can't get enough of this message all right see there was a clash when the carnal and the spiritual meets there's always a clash when Judas and Jesus met there was a clash one the Son of God the other the son of Satan like Cain and Abel there was a Clash they Clash Cain and Abel both brothers both of them from the same the same mother they realize they're Immortal they had been put on Life In The Garden of Life they both were trying to find a way back in if you notice both boys were very religious Kane was as religious as able was they built altars otherwise a church they made sacrifice they both prayed and they served God both of them one of them served him wrong you see you can never be so sincere and yet be wrong you can ever be so sincere and yet be wrong you can you can be wrong there's a way that seemeth right but the end thereof is the ways of death amen I heard through that I apologize for doing that let's stand God bless you I'm sorry to take so long again I but you won't probably hear from me for a while now so I just believe God's delivered it I've only hit the high points or so many things that could be taken you go back and read it look it over I was going to end up with what the prophet ended up with about the seed about the wheat plant how that every bit of the carrier the Life coming up through it which is the bride the carriers those that Come Through the Ages all of that's found in that wheat plant some is burned some are saved parts are saved it all Lays right there God bless you thank you for being patient with me I'm a long-winded preacher I can't be something I'm not [Music] I'm not embarrassed by it God's a judge of me now no one of you can judge me but God's judging me and I've got the answer for everything I've said I've got the other words I've got to stand there in judgment someday and I pray that you'll send with me I don't mean to be judged I'm talking about in judgment and we'll give answer to what everything has been said in my I will give answer to everyone that I've spoken to through the years of my life and testified to I'll have to give an answer for that then that answer giving an answer doesn't mean I'm being judged it means I'm answering back [Music] this was so in the courtroom there's a testimony here there's there's wit there's evidence where you hear it this time yes Lord who's that person here yes shown right there is that you yes it is is that you over here yes and watch what was said why did you think that thought why'd you do the opposite when you knew it was the truth [Music] don't let that be our don't let it be brother sister we're too late down the hour now to just play around with this we're not playing Church we're not playing with the message don't play with it get into it with all your heart ask God to reveal it ask him to fill you Lord I'm not satisfied until you meet this desire and longing in my heart to know you and to know you more if I stood up here and said I've got everything I need I'd be lying to you I don't but I know one thing he'll give it to me in due time amen he'll keep revealing his word and that revealed word is taking me to a body change [Music] what
