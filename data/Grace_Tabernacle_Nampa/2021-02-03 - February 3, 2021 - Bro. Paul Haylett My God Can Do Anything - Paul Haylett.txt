amen praise the lord well we want to be in prayer for this weekend brother george being here and also young peoples let's keep young peoples in prayer as well as they'll be gathering on friday i don't have the number here but there's a lighthouse i think i think it's just lighthouse is the title of the song let's sing that as we get ready to receive our pastor kfc there's a lighthouse on a hillside that overlooks life sees when i'm tossed it sends out light that i might see and the light that shines in darkness now will safely [Music] no more and i thank god for the lighthouse i owe my [Music] king jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin he has shown a lie all around me [Music] and i could clearly see if it wasn't for the lighthouse where would this everybody that lives around me they say tear that old light house down all the big ships [Music] when my mind goes back to that stormy night when just in time i saw the light the light from that old lighthouse that stands up there on a hill and i thank god for the lighthouse i owe my life to him king jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin he has shown his life all around me and i can literally see if it wasn't for the lighthouse tell me where would this ship be and i thank god [Music] [Music] is and from the rocks of sin he has shown his life all around me that i [Music] skippy [Music] hallelujah you know the prophet of god told us not to look back that the windshield was bigger the rear view mirror was small he said if you keep staring in that you'll run in a ditch but did you know to be a safe driver every once in a while you need to look in the rearview mirror and it does us as sons and daughters of god good to just glance up in the mirror every once in a while and realize you know the paradox as it is that we were in him from before the foundation of the world but yet we in this natural life have a beginning a time that we can say this is when i got saved this is when god turned my life around and thankful that we can look back and see that day amen that we can stand upon the word of god and know that we are secure amen i just want to remind everyone this saturday evening at 7. um also don't forget brother jay grace kids [Laughter] the young people i'm like you're forgetting us you're forgetting us uh at uh brother sergey sister yulia's house at seven o'clock amen i know brother chris is garnering kind of all the attention but we're we're gonna pull some of that back from him a little bit amen well i want to speak to you tonight uh once again the age-old proverbs are still blessing us today are they not and so we want to just go in my thought tonight my title tonight would be my god can do anything amen and and that's a beautiful thing when you think about all through the scripture all through the ages uh the incredible things that god has done if you're a believer i was just looking and studying a certain approach to a thought and as i was looking at that i saw a little blip on the computer screen and i thought oh what does uh i've just now forgot what it is that deal where people write the descriptions of things wikipedia so there was a little notation of wikipedia and so i just thought i'm going to see what somebody said on wikipedia about it and and it said you know that this was just a story just a an allegory an analogy uh if you could even believe it to that extent and i thought you know isn't this interesting it all comes down to we're either believers or we're not right amen and by god's grace we can look at the word of god today and we see ample evidence that when our god decides to turn heaven and earth that he does and so let's just stand and we'll go right into proverbs the second chapter and um we'll read the first to 11th verse amen my son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments with thee so that thou incline thy ear into wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding yea if thou criest after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures then shout thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the path of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment inequity yea every good path when wisdom entereth in to thine heart and knowledge is pleasant until thy soul discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee heavenly father we thank you lord for your word we look low back through the bible find so many things lord that that are encouraging and strengthening and giving guidance and wisdom to us today lord bringing peace to our hearts lord in these troubled times father there's a reassurance that comes from your word lord it's not just the words that give the reassurance but it's your holy spirit that accompanies these words and father we ask you to bless each one tonight those who are not here my brother sergey i believe still out on the road lord of those around us lord maybe that are sick whatever the situations might be the prayer requests lord that have been put forth we're just asking lord for you to touch and move in our midst we ask this in the precious name of jesus christ amen you may be seated i would like to go back and we will just look at this kind of what we did the last wednesday that i spoke and we'll look my brother and sister just real quickly through this uh tonight uh and we'll just start here in the first verse he says my son which would include each and every one of us if thou wilt receive my words and so he has given in that right there a a position to accept or reject if thou wilt receive my words and and he says and you hide my commandments with thee so that thine incline thine ear into wisdom so this is not just saying we have these commandments that we have heard these words but these words are actually bringing an action in our life it's actually causing us to stop and and turn our ear unto wisdom and apply that heart to understanding you know this reminds me of a conversation i had with an individual the other day and and we were talking about how it is interesting that that we as as young people you know are our parents they tried to share certain things with us and they would say you know now whatever you do don't don't go down this path don't don't get a spirit of rebellion uh whatever and they laid out these guidelines and and uh you know i praise god for those that follow those guidelines but uh many said you know what i'm going to find out for myself and so you see from generation to generation how that the lessons have to be learned over and over and over again and and you look at that and you think oh lord would there be a way that we could express to our children that that if they could just uh skip the rebellion and move into the the time of knowledge move into wisdom uh skip those times uh and just trust as it were your parents or your elders or whatever it might be grandparents and but you know it's in the human nature that that we have to have things proven i i think of my little grandson declan you know as we have the little wood stove uh running there in the family room and and how you you tell him no and he turns and looks at you and he shakes his head he takes about three steps away and then he turns right back and he's headed towards it with his hand down and you know my brother and sister i think that's very reflective of how that we are as humans but he's speaking to us here and saying if you'll receive my words and hide my commandments with thee i believe we could take this without changing the scripture and say hide my commandments within thee amen not just you know have them on a piece of paper or something but sow that down and climb thy ears so to be moved in such a fashion that we start to turn our ear to the wisdom of god and as we look down further in this scripture verse 6 he says the lord giveth wisdom so if we're inclining our ear unto wisdom now this is not to be mistaken for the knowledge or wisdom of this world but to be of the things of god and so if we're inclining our ear into wisdom that means we're listening to god we're listening to what god's got to say to us and and you know he's always right on time saints we're the ones that's out of time and he's right on time and so if we incline our ear we we turn our ear to him and he is speaking you'll know that what he's speaking is right for the season it's right for the hour that we're living in and we can trust that and you know we come to a place and and i i don't know i just i will offer myself up and say sometimes uh we're guilty i'm guilty that in times that we need knowledge we need to be able to make decisions it seems like we just become mute we become you know as it were deaf and dumb we can't speak we can't hear and we just labor over what should i do lord what should i do lord what should i do lord but yet we don't really approach it in the correct fashion it's like we become paralyzed oh if we can break through that incline our ear and say lord you have the answers and lord i'm waiting i'm listening and when you speak lord i will be here to hear amen now you think about how he wants us to approach this verse four he says if thou seeketh her as silver my my brother and sister they've turned the whole world practically upside down in the search for precious metals they they go to the far frozen frozen north and and grow i was just reading you know you don't think about it right we think of gnome and we think of all those places in alaska but i was reading where i forget now the the metal was a barium or something like that that you know they are in siberia and uh you know it is such a harsh environment that when the winter closes in they often times they park the equipment and try to winterize it but in the spring when they come back to it things have got so cold that steel beams have snapped off and that's what they do in search of precious metals and and if we could just take that if thou seek us her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures not my brother and sister is no small effort that is not a passing i think i'll try but that is a serious pressing pressing into desiring for amen amen then thou shalt see when we get to the place that we seek as though it this precious metal we search for as the hid treasure it's then thou shalt understand the fear of the lord not the superficial not just uh from the surface not just the momentary uh consideration is not going to uh reveal to us this understanding but it is those who are so sold out uh kind of tie into what we've been talking about on sunday someone so sold out that they're not going to quit until they find the treasure aren't you glad we found this hidden treasure in human vessels amen thus earth and vessels hallelujah that's where we're not here to glorify ourself we're not here to say oh look at us we're believers but to be able to look at this vessel and say look how profoundly god has changed me look how profoundly god has given wisdom and guidance to us how profoundly god has opened our eyes and ears to see the word for the day that we are living it's easy enough to look at luther my brother and sister the lutherans still are it's easy enough to look at wesley and the wesleyanist nazarene methodist holiness groups are all still looking back into that day but how by god's grace and now what i'm going to say here i hope is not profound to you i hope it is not something you say oh wow but i want you to understand this my brother and sister how blessed we are to see brother branham's ministry but i'm telling you you're even more blessed to see what the ministry was promised to bring forth you see it's one thing to look back and we have all the tapes and we have the testimony and see what brother branham was doing what god was doing through him but to see the opening of the word and how that this coming forth in this day right now is coming forth producing this bride oh thank you lord that we can see the move of god that's taking place right now hallelujah because you see all we have to do is have an ability to look into the historical side if we want to look backwards but you have to have as it were a prophetic vision to see what god is doing right now amen and you know in the world of technology uh brother isaac brother chris brother alex are working in this world of technology my brother and sister brother persona uh right there maybe even on the foremost you know as he told me once brother paul it's just the size of a grain of sand and he said and it's really about made up of the same stuff and my mind just goes because all the sand that i deal with just lays there and blows away if you're not careful it doesn't have memory it doesn't have ability but you see to be on the cutting edge of technology is an incredible thing and to be on the cutting edge of the revelation of jesus christ is a wonderful thing hallelujah you see my brother and sister it's good and it's great to be able to say we saw what god did but to see him moving right now is the very blessing of almighty god opening our hearts and our minds to receive even the unction of the moving of the holy ghost hallelujah not doing lightnings and thunders my brother and sister but as we know as a gentle dove just to feel the sweep of the wing just the stirring and know that it's our lord jesus christ in the form of the holy ghost and coming down here as brother branham teaches us he come down it is god the prophet of god said it is all god my brother and sister but in morphe he come down as the holy spirit moving in our midst we don't need thunder we don't need lightning we don't need the building to shake we just need to be conscious of the presence of almighty god and for us to be completely conscious of that it takes him himself to stir the heart and make that ability within us come out oh many people would say well i i think you're overstating that i feel the moving of god but my brother and sister the word of god shows us clearly that many people will recognize and feel the moving of the holy spirit but never receive what he has for them oh thank you lord that he's stirring our hearts and making us able with a great ability not a simple ability saints i i'm not i'm not here tonight just to roll you up and get you all excited but i'm here to tell you the ability to hear from god is not a simple ability amen while it's god in simplicity this is a very complicated thing because the prophet of god over and over and over again says if you believe if you believe takes the scripture all things are possible only believe if you can believe i want to know what keeps you believing in a world full of fear in a world full of doubts and a world fill all kinds of drama to to take your time what keeps bringing you back to the well of grace nothing but god himself hallelujah oh praise the lord that we would truly understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of a god our god he gives wisdom and out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding you know the scripture tells us not to worry about what you're going to say you know why he's took over your mouth he's took over your mind you don't have to say well now if they say this i'll say this because you know what'll happen is they won't say that and then they'll take you somewhere you never thought the conversation would go and you'll even find yourself going well now how can i do that and then the holy spirit comes on the scene and you start to speak later you walk away and said well why didn't i say this and why didn't i say that because god didn't want you to amen in some places you speak into the depth of the knowledge of god sometimes you just speak in the superficial because god knows exactly where they're at hallelujah oh my oh my oh my now look at this verse eight you see there's a path of judgment aren't you glad tonight we get to walk that path of judgment we're the one that can walk the path of judgment even tonight and whatever it might be as we before we come out actually brother jason prayed for the service tonight amen and he's saying lord whatever happened today don't let that be any hindrance now what happened today might be just frustration it might not be anything great but you see there's something in the heart of the believer that says lord anything that's in the path forgive me for it clear the path lord i'm asking you lord just clear the path because you see i want nothing between my soul and the savior no obstacles no things we need to stop stumble over you know like i told you before about how years and years ago we'd come to communion and everybody's scurrying all over the church you know telling everybody and you know and you said it to everybody because you wasn't sure who you offended and who you hadn't but you see the holy ghost deals with us differently now because we're recognizing this path of judgment but the word says he keeps that path it's not even us keeping it right it's not us in our ability and what we can do but it's him that keeps the path and he keeps the path by moving on you by the spirit to sweep the path but it's actually him keeping the path because you know i i know you know what i'm talking about and if it's not you it's some folks kind of very similar to you you know we can justify i did that and i shouldn't have but they had it coming and give yourself a few days not only did they have it coming you should have gave them more that's how we justify but what does the keeper of the path of judgment do he comes down we pick our bible up i should have chosen another scripture we go to church and the preacher comes out and you think he must be he meant that towards me and then we're driving home feeling bad because the preacher stomped all over us and we put on a tape and the prophet of god says and you know you should have never done that why because there's a keeper of the path of judgment and he keeps bringing us back to the place of repentance providing atmosphere for us to say lord i'm sorry and the path is then clear to the believer but imagine my brother and sister those that can't be moved by the holy spirit the the baggage the luggage that must be strewn in their path of judgment and it must be dealt with someday right it doesn't just go away you know i run into an old friend at brother joe's funeral and we we were talking and uh some of you would know him brother roddy sheffield and we were we were talking and i don't know where he goes remember the time that you and i did this and this and it actually served to drive home to me how that each one of us has different views of something taking place he remembers something and i said honestly roddy i i don't remember that at all and he's like really i'm like really you see how easy things can fall behind us and be forgotten but god says no problem i'm the keeper of the path and i'll i'll bring it up i'll remind you through the preaching of the word it wasn't something bad we did it was something stupid so but uh you know and the keeper of the passing by the preaching of the word will dredge up things you know what our reaction is they're preaching it's starting to dredge up something i didn't really deal with in my life in the past and you kind of just want to shut that off but do you realize it's the holy ghost saying i want you to get this out in the past i want you to just deal with it all you got to do is say forgive me lord and if it was just something as it were between you and the lord if something someone else then god opens the door for you to deal with those things because god won't bring it to your recall and give you no opportunity to set it correct amen amen then see if he brings it to our recall it's up to us to set it correct you see that's how the spirit of bitterness gets done is because when that was little one could have dealt with it but then it grows so big that it's hard to face that monster in your own personal mental closet praise the lord amen when wisdom entereth in thine heart knowledge is pleasant to thy soul discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee now i want to just go here into the sermon paradox brother brown says here the hebrew children how would you now how would you make science believe today that a man could go into a furnace oh i would be afraid to say how many fahrenheit's hot it was but could go into that furnace back there in the book of daniel and stay in that furnace until they thought that he they was all burnt down to ashes which even the man the great army of soldiers great husky men that moved out there to throw them in the furnace those men that went in there perished by the intense heat of the furnace against them and they fell into the furnace and was down there down in there for all this time and come out without this even the smell of fire upon them you know what saints if i could just take a moment kind of old home week here i understand how they don't believe this do you understand how they don't believe this defies every bit of logic defies every bit of science physics defies it all what they don't realize is the god we serve amen see that's the problem they're caught up with the idea that god is like us and there's just some things you can't do so they look in word of themself to reason this is not possible but the word gave the antidote didn't it yes sure enough i bear my shoulder i take the antidote that all things are possible and when that antidote takes place and gets a hols of our life we find ourself coming and approaching everything in life not just spiritual things my brother and sister everything in life you start to approach it why because it has like a vaccine if that would be an example it has permeated every pore of your body if it is a church experience you will only satisfy that at church it is a physical human element experience you will only satisfy that in the thrill and adrenaline rush and etc of this life but when it becomes an all-encompassing experience it takes a holds of you no matter what's going on in your life you realize i'm a believer that means god can come on the scene this moment right now i don't need to question how when where what it would be my god is able hallelujah and that is the the effect that the word of god has when it starts to move through the life of a real believer you say brother paul you said real believer that's right my brother and sister the make-believer the partial believer the nine-tenths believer will never have the same effect upon the word upon them that they have my brother that the real believer i'm just excited excuse me amen that nine tenths believer will never understand the fact that the word of god would bring because they've only received it in that portion and if you are in a falling number declining you know 8 10 7 10 6 5 4 3 2 1 no wonder my brother and sister that the church has become dead no wonder because people are approaching it from their accomplishment now i'm not faulting anyone we all have our place in life but my brother and sister you will see it in humanity some people they just dream at the level that they live in other words if they got a job at the dog food factory when they were 18 they'll retire in the dog food factory but there's others that look at the heavens and say you know what i can do all that i set my mind to and they go out and they pursue that and people say well they failed five times well number six might be a failure number seven might be the answer hallelujah and then everybody says well i wished i'd got rich quick like them yeah see these great men they died just throwing them into the fire and when the time is right let me put that right the word says there's a season for everything amen when they're down in there for all this time and they come out without even the smell of fire upon them i'm going to tell you right now that is physically impossible would you agree with me it's physically impossible but it's not impossible for my god hallelujah when the son or daughter of god anointed by the holy ghost in the service of almighty god my brother and sister the word promised we could walk through the fire amen and we could come out without the smell of smoke amen we can walk through those things or they say the diseases and this and that sister jerry shared with me that bill gates is already declaring the next pandemic is going to be 10 or 20 times worse what is he talking about maybe he's helped created the next pandemic after all the ultra rich would like less people on the earth and those people that are on the earth they actually want them there for their benefit that's called servitude well i'm not so scared about having to serve a man as it would be to be coerced to serving the devil amen because in the year of jubilee the man was set free and i'm telling you what we can stand tonight and say he who has been set free is free indeed hallelujah we didn't put our ear to the post we went out of there so fast all they saw was dust hallelujah amen god performing a miracle oh hey we serve a miracle working god that was a genuine paradox of the keeping power of god against do you read what i read it was just talking about them at the fiery furnace is what the prophet's saying here right come on i need to downplay this so nobody gets any great expectations are you with me saints the prophet of god if you think he's just saying words then that's good but he said this is a genuine paradox of the keeping power of god against any enemy and when a man is ready to admit god is true and god keeps his word and honors those who believe in him certainly i believe in a paradox hallelujah that's the god we serve amen a god that can do anything now as we look at this i want to go to first thessalonians 5 21-24 here and this is something that we as christians should not just roll over and play dead and act like we don't need to do this we should come and do our homework in the word of god we should take time to prove to ourself you say well brother paul wouldn't that be doubting absolutely not because god put it right here in the word prove all things that's the good the bad the ugly the total stranger or the people who are closest to you who might speak something that would affect your eternal destination amen so that might come right down here sorry preachers you make up about half the congregation tonight anything that comes right here right ought to be able to be put here you see not this i'ma just say it like i feel it is that all right not this garbage i was raised up with how dare you question the ministry no i say my brother and sister the scripture says prove all things hold fast to that which is good abstain from even something that appears to be wrong and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved amen i almost preached on just the thought of being preserved tonight but we'll save that for another time amen he said i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless in other words can find fault why can't they find fault because you allowed the master of the path control of your life he said i want to bring you down this path to judgment you are going to judge yourself now that you don't have to be judged later and you've said yes lord yes lord thank you lord it's painful it's embarrassing i'm ashamed of myself i'm this i'm that but it doesn't matter because you see now there's no luggage no baggage behind you amen oh isn't that beautiful you're preserved blameless into the coming of our lord jesus christ faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it oh isn't that beautiful amen when we wouldn't volunteer to walk down the path of judgment he comes and woos us and we step into the path and we say lord forgive me and some people would say well that's just living life what are you worried about i'm not worried i'm just obedient to the wooing of the holy spirit that comes and says what you said what you did what you thought how you acted it's not right oh my isn't that beautiful hallelujah see my god can do anything in laodicea the most wicked of the ages coming right back in the very semblance of it was of sodom but in a much more complex age why because we have seven ages worth of demons they've been released out of the river euphrates just poured out you can call it what you want some people might reference it as hollywood some might reference it uh you know something different whatever it is see it's all been turned out it's all been turned loose and you're standing here in the middle of this doing what the devil thought would be impossible and that was to stand solid on the word of god not compromised not mixing it not making it into a pale horse but standing there saying i want just the purity of the holy spirit hallelujah oh how beautiful that is now let's just keep going here so i can go now in the choosing of a bride what an incredible sermon i i just have to say it's an incredible sermon amen now i'm just pulling this out so remember go read more study it out we're not trying to cherry pick we just don't have uh uh you know enough time i guess you would say the other so obviously you'll see what he's talking to he's bringing reference now now he says the other is pregnanted by the word of god and we'll bring forth the body the finished oh don't you love that the finished not an immature as we were talking on sunday see you know while esther was coming into her maturity vasti already was in a position but she would have dis discounted or not been inclined to give much credit to someone like esther because hey she's a nothing but esther was on the way up and vashti was on the way down whoa the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet now this was in 65 my brother and sister but a rapture has not taken place so we are still looking at a body of believers being molded into this body called the bride amen and it's still taking place and i say thank you lord because people are saying well you know it might be the last one is in well you know when the last one comes to perfection we'll have a rapture and you know what i hate to say this but it could be one of us right still fighting with things of our life still fighting with struggle still working on surrendering but don't be ashamed of anything like that because this body is a perfect body right amen let's just say how does that phrase go to uh you know even if you don't start the game to make the first team is incredible you understand people are like well i made the team but somebody else is playing shortstop and i'm not just the fact you have a uniform on and you are standing there as it were this analogy of the stadium and you're right there at any moment for them to call upon you you see just because this bride hasn't made a rapture yet doesn't mean she's not glorious does not mean that she is some kind of crippled or inadequate amen god's just perfecting her and a man and woman christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body i read this to you just the other day so i have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes one body again like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she has no that she used no mind of her own i think that might be some of our problem we're still using our mind we're getting closer though aren't we hallelujah i'll tell you what we'll see it god's way whether we come willingly or he comes dragging us but you called as the bride of christ will come you are coming you are it hallelujah now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word amen amen amen i'm just going to throw this in if somebody comes along and says the lord told me to do this that doesn't fit right here we don't even need to argue about it it doesn't fit in here if it's contrary to one word the prophet of god said flee from it now flee i think is a faster pace than the shanter right flee from it that means i think probably meaning running full tilt but have you noticed saints what's happening in the world today and i'm not talking about some denomination out here i'm talking about in the in the world that we know people are saying well i was praying the other night and the lord told me and it's contrary right with the word of god but we're such an enlightened what do they call that now we're woke we're woke and i don't mean to embarrass sister jerry but she sometimes i wouldn't say she has more time than i do but while the dishwasher is running she you know so to speak or the clothes washers running she has these moments and she pointed out we were just discussing this the other day and and how people seem to be offended if the preaching gets sorry sister nadia if the preaching gets just too close people get offended it just wasn't right i don't say this is something you need to do but if you want to have time and you can just listen to the prophet he names names way more often than we would like to admit he doesn't beat around the bush either imagine you're the little lady that's been troubled by spirits and about out of your mind and finally you come to the prophet and you're there in an interview and he tells you when your husband was here you were here you were unfaithful to him and she's screaming no don't say that he'll leave me he'll leave me the prophet god says don't worry about it he has the same thing to confess and then i believe it's one or two services later prophet of god stands in the pulpit tells the whole world they were unfaithful they run into each other's arms and they repented and god restored both of them and anything less than a rocket scientist connects all the dots you think the prophet cared no jesus stood right there and spoke to them and says imagine pretty close company you are of your father the devil you imagine you're a priest you're important and there are people around here that you know are believing this this this beelzebub and and he just said you're of your father the devil and i had no way to refute that just mumble a few words in our defense our fathers yeah your fathers are the ones who put them in the tomb and then whited them i'm telling you god god gets downright and personal my brother and sister i'm telling you i think we're going to come the prophet of god actually said we'll come to a day when these things will be called out in the house of god and it won't be called out by an angry preacher getting a vindictive stab at somebody it will be god bringing a people into the path of judgment and bringing them to come to a place that they'll repent and and clear these things out of their lives i say god let us come into that path without you having to bring us oh hallelujah amen because you see we're the rest of that body do we believe that we are the rest of that body and the two together makes one body again amen and that's what his word declared and his word is his will so god is here tonight telling us saints my will for you is to get yourself to the place i can be brought back and molded right back you molded to me i mold it to you however you want to put it there coming into one body we don't need something else we don't need the world between us we don't need the world leaving a lump as it were we need to clean it all out and let best come that we can come right together and be that one in christ oh hallelujah lord help me to be that sold out that's my that's my heart's desire lord amen is to be sold out now look if god called you then he will provide for you and my brother and sister when i say he'll provide for you i'm not talking about a house closed food whatever if god called you then he's provided the prophet of god said everything you need to make the rapture is already in you god has provided for you already everything it takes to make a rapture oh god help us to tap into this not later but now amen i don't want to be out of season lord but we don't want this to slide behind us as some kind of historical thing when the promise is right here for us to possess it because he said i provided it for you will you come no lord i'm on a spiritual diet right now i felt like i was getting too spiritual for my church so i just went on a drought come on no the devil would like us to the devil would like to bring us to a point that we just feel like we're so spiritual we don't need any more of god i remember one of the most ridiculous statements that i ever heard i heard a person say we've heard enough of the message i think i'll tell you at the time i'm so stunned i never even responded but i'm telling you that's one of the most ridiculous statements i've ever heard an individual make that we've had enough of the message well i'll tell you what my brother and sister that might work for them but it ain't working very good for me hallelujah you know it's kind of like this city buffet that's over there by by winco or whatever my brother and sister if you walk out of there hungry you probably you probably deserve to be hungry the food's terrible but there's a lot of it yeah i didn't want this to sound like a ringing endorsement for the city of the city buffet the food's terrible but there's so much food in that place that if you walk out hungry it's still your fault amen if you find even just one egg roll that you like there'll be 500 of them there for you to eat hallelujah but look at this i want you to understand when god gets in the provision business gets into the providing business amen he will come and as he deals with sons and daughters of god now sometimes my brother and sister you have to understand we do things and we don't even realize why we do them only to find out later that was the moving of the holy spirit positionally placing you amen things i i know we're guilty of this and it works both ways they'll be the time that we'll say amen to things and end up saying amen to something that we realize whoa i i wish i hadn't said amen to that but the holy spirit will move on you to say amen to things of the word that you can't even explain but god wants you to be a partaker of this portion of the promise that he anoints you to sit there on the pew and say so be it lord and you don't even understand what you're saying amen to but god is counting it to you for righteousness and releasing that to you in your spirit and people say well why can't you explain this and why can't you explain that i don't know i don't know the finer details what i do know is it's real and i believe it amen and people then say well well you just can't believe that if you don't understand it can't explain it no mother brother sister you can amen i wasn't called to be an explainer i don't find anywhere in the world that it says amen that you you would uh uh attain to the promise because you explained it no i tell you what it does it shows you over and over and over again you attain to the promise because you believed it hallelujah amen amen because see she's not to have a mind of her own amen you know what god will do he'll even provide you an alibi did you know that every christian needs a good alibi when the devil says you're going to be over here this is what you are this is it you can stand on the word the holy spirit will say he never did it that's right never did it and the devil will say i've got proof and god would say bring it out you know i spoke of that inspiration come to me that one one service you know all satan's got us as xerox coffee he's got no other proof my brother and sister and god says well nope sorry i've got i hold the evidence off the evidence what would you call it room i hold the evidence room and there's not one bit of evidence in here he ever done it god says i give you a better alibi than that he's under the blood that's where he's at that's where he's at it's right here under the blood boy that must be frustrating for the devil amen as brother jason brought that out i i got quite a good chuckle out of that amen saying happy birthday to the devil so he was reminded he's got an end coming amen he might have a lot of birthdays under his belt right now but that just means his days are shortened yeah yeah he provides a scriptural foundation for you you realize that every one of us is just enough different that we come out of the scripture you might say the same only different that's right absolutely you catch that you understand that yes you come out the same only different and you realize god puts a spiritual foundation a scriptural foundation under every one of us one never has went out and done a thing wrong in their whole life another comes he looks like an absolute tornado of trouble god puts a foundation under him god puts a foundation under him some young lady might come from totally the wrong side of the city but the saving grace of almighty god comes and puts a spiritual foundation under her that she can look in the word of god and say well i didn't come the way they all came but praise the lord i can identify right here and put a scriptural spiritual foundation under them and a young lady can grow up in church and never spend a day or time of her life ever outside of the walls of the word of god and god comes says blessed blessed oh think about it saints my god can do anything oh hallelujah amen you know what what we have is a problem in the world we live in today god will provide for every need but in this confused world it's become a confused world even in the church of wants and needs amen what we really have need of is god and it really should become what our primary want as i come out of this scripture that we read there amen it should be our want amen we should presu pursue it as though it was silver we should pursue it as though it was hidden treasure hallelujah well i just i'll finish up on this last quote just happens to be about 10 pages long what time is it i was talking some time ago to a scientist that was that when joshua the great warrior who stood by the river of jordan that separated israel in the wilderness from the promised land the great stream that's always believed among the people that represents death that we cross the jordan to the promised land as jesus gave us in john 14. the just separation is the death line when joshua who had stood and heard moses teach and had heard moses the prophet and had saw the great signs of god of god work by his prophet one day while encamped a great military man had all israel gathered at the bank they had come out because god had given them a promise and he had performed many miracles now i want to stop has our god performed many miracles so so we are for sure talking about the same god right amen because sometimes you know i hear people talk especially the antis what what was the quote sunday i think brother brown called the rejecters get away from the rejecters you know to hear the rejecters talk sometimes god had done nothing ever in this message it's dead d.o.a god hasn't moved come on this is according to the rejecters but it's funny because i could just bore you to tears because you've probably heard most of things in my life before but while they say god's never done anything i stand here and tell you i serve a miracle miracle-working god hallelujah i've had like little things you know just to kind of give you a little glimpse of it i might have told you about my childhood how we spun a pickup out on the top of a ravine and it's sitting there virtually straight up and down like this and we're looking about 300 yards down at the bottom of a ravine thinking what it's going to feel like to die and yet able to climb out of that pickup and not only that be able to hook a cable on that pickup and pull it back up the bank to find out it was held in place on the side of the mountain by a rock that big wedged up against the tire in the winter time in mud i'm sure that rock way i don't know i can't inspect the rock because it fell in the canyon as soon as we pulled the pickup back up oh but i have a rock i have a rock saints i ever tell you about the time i was traveling through the middle of oregon in the middle of the winter in the middle of the night and it turned into freezing fog and i was so tired i should have been parked but on top the mountain there's nowhere to park and i looked in the mirror brother trevor really appreciate this brother vasily would really appreciate this i looked in the mirror and i thought that's really weird that looks like my load tarped and i'm driving down the mountain with my trailer sticking straight out beside me and all i could do i had lightning quick reaction you know that lightning quick god help me my feet never moved my hands never moved nothing else never moved my lightning reaction was god help me and i watched in the mirror as the trailer just drifted right behind me and never even gave the truck a tail bob and i went on down the mountain i don't know i guess that could have just happened oh did i tell you that as i was looking at it before its momentum was going further and further and further and pretty soon i would i'm sorry for the humor i might have thought i was mistaken i'm actually driving up this mountain yeah no no i'm sorry the rejecters what they got to say my brother and sister but you see the promise of the word was that moses a prophet let me put it that way would teach and we would hear the prophet and we saw the great signs that god did by his prophet and one day in camp the great military man had all israel gathered at the bank they'd come out because god had given them a promise good and he had performed many miracles they were down at the end of the road and had taken the hand of god and as i said this afternoon in the service how god loves to get oh no no no please lord that's right he loves to get his people just in that condition oh my you know that's like who wants to pray for patience you know the whole church sits on their hands don't worry he'll give you patience anyhow whether you pray for it or not right amen so whether we we volunteer and say lord yeah whatever you want thy will be done lord it don't matter my brother and sister god loves to get you in that condition and shows you he can just show them his power and his love but did you know the rejecters say if god lets that happen in your life that god doesn't love you but god says i do love you amen i heard a man speak the other day or wrote a book a famous man i would not call his name because he ridiculed me that's it won't face up to the ridicule well let's read a little line a little further there's no need of disgracing him he said he didn't believe me well that's all right i didn't ask him to believe me and i asked him to believe the lord and he said here's one reason said i have never seen william branham but i know he's false why there's a lot of them around aren't there well now that would be a pretty bad testimony the law would be produced something better from that they didn't judge a man until they heard him so yet he said i had a man come to me and say i want you to pray for me dr so-and-so i have a kidney trouble he said now how long have you been bothered by it said 30 years altogether but i was healed for two years and it come back on me again and the man said well what doctor did you go to said well in louisville kentucky a fellow by the name of brother branham was praying for the sick and the man never and the man never seen me in his life but he looked up in the balcony and told me who i was and told me i'd been suffering with this kidney trouble for many years but he said i was healed well the doctor of divinity said were you healed two years i never had one sign of it but it come back on me again now i want to interject this because i believe it was providence of god that sister jerry wanted to read something to me and she i might because i didn't actually read it myself she recounted it to me i might not get the words exactly right but brother branham talking about how anyone can get healed but if you want if you're an unbeliever and you get healed if you want to keep your healing you need to serve god now i want you to keep that in mind the prophet's words on that right god's just given you might say divine favor and gave healing to a person who doesn't even serve him but the prophet says if you want to keep that healing amen you need to serve him you need to give your life to him now take that thought in mind right here two years i never had one sign of it but it came back on me again he said therefore you see william branham is false i called him up long distance and i said sir i want to ask you something if a man had pneumonia tonight and the doctors uh come and could give him no hope give him some penicillin tomorrow he comes back and finds out he is well on his road to recovery in two or three days from now the man has passed a physical examination that says he's perfectly normal no symptoms all he goes out and works for two years again takes pneumonia and dies was the man healed at the first place the simple reality of it is that man went two years with a kidney problem that god healed him from but you see he didn't find complete deliverance because it's not just about healing are you with me it's not just about healing now let me hurry up and finish this he said you can't do that uh oh you you don't class divine healing where you get your mistake you try to put divine healing on the same basis as salvation you can't do that because when you're born again you're forever a new creature you become absolutely born again a new creature but when you're healed you're not a new body but the holy spirit living in here the old covenant providing divine healing and we have a better covenant and divine healing was included or provided in the atonement so i said of course lazarus was raised from the dead and died again but divine healing is one of the benefits that we enjoy by being christians amen now in the proverbs here the scripture says to enjoy all of god's benefits amen david said now forget not all his benefits who forgives all thine iniquity whose heals all thy diseases it's the benefits that we draw from god by being a believer amen and as joshua crossing over he heard the voice of god that told him to get everything ready in order and he would cross over jordan he was a witness he wasn't afraid he sanctified the people see as a pastor joshua was doing exactly what he was supposed to do he didn't say i don't want to offend anybody but he said about sanctifying israel that knowing without that sanctification then the promise would be void when it come to the crossing of jordan so he set about to do that because he knew that was right he wasn't afraid he sanctified the people and had them wash their clothes get ready and the priest stepped into the water got wet feet but before they got to the middle of the jordan it was all dried away they were witnesses that god would keep his word amen they stipped it stepped in with wet feet and walked 20 yards and had dry feet in the middle of the ocean or in the middle of the dead or red or jordan i'm glad to hear brother branham stumble like that because it makes me feel better about myself amen amen twice oh that's god god keeps his promise just be a witness step in don't be afraid joshua never heard of anything like that a scientist told me one day same man that there was proven in the solar system that a certain star passed over a certain star and it caused a great wind to blow back the river i love this brother bran i'm speaking now very strange two stars cross and a wind comes blows the river back but i believe it might be true if it can be scientifically proved but god moved the stars over i love how he brings that around right our mind would be like two stars crossing and a wind blow the water back that's nonsense but if god crossed the two stars amen how he does it that's up to him just so he does it how can he do it it's not my question to it's not my business it's not me to try or you to try to question it's except what he said you can't prove it you can't prove god but there's lots of things i can't prove i accept it anyhow because we see it working and he's a witness sister amy would you come hallelujah my god can do anything amen he might beat a cross in a couple stars causing a wind to blow it doesn't matter my brother and sister it would have took god to make that happen or else those two stars would have surely crossed again hallelujah but we have a promise and god's here and he can make it come to pass he is making it come to pass hallelujah hallelujah brother jay help me here i'm a little tongue-twisted tonight i want to sing that song wouldn't take nothing for my journey now [Music] hallelujah well i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now gotta make it to heaven somehow oh the devil tell me and he tries to turn me around [Music] now well i started out traveling for the lord many years ago i've had a lot of heartache had a lot of grief and whoa for my journey now well i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now gotta make it to hell somehow oh the devil tapped me tries to turn me around he's offered everything that's gone and name all the wealth i want worldly fame if i could still i wouldn't take nothing on the journey now there's nothing in the world that will ever take the place of god's love silver and gold could never buy his love from above that way my soul is healing and i begin to feeling his power i can say thank you lord i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now well i wouldn't take nothing he's offered everything that's gonna name on all the wealth i've won worldly fame if i could still i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now can we say amen to that tonight hallelujah this is a tough journey joshua my brother and sister had to be fully prepared because while he had a promise that god would send them into the promised land he also knew that the fulfilling of that promise meant a battle a battle a battle a battle a battle a battle a battle a battle a battle a battle a battle of battle that the promise to israel they still have a battle oh my i thought when i got saved i just said started on easy street no when you got saved god said they'll pray for courage and i'll give it to them they'll pray for victory and i'll give it to they'll pray for everything and i'll give it to them because it's my wife it's my bride and i know that i can give her half of the kingdom and she's going to say thank you lord but never actually try to possess it in a carnal fashion she'll always possess it in the spiritual oh isn't that beautiful isn't that beautiful you realize saints god honors those promises so strongly that's why the world out here christendom out here are driving nice cars living in big houses and then they say god gave this to me but you see the bride has another promise same promise same words but another promise and she's saying lord increase my courage give me the holy ghost fill me up lord i want to stand faithful i want to stand at your side this is what i desire it's not of this earth lord it's you it's you lord it's you lord hallelujah i keep coming back amen just strikes my heart as i was studying this i just keep coming back to the well of grace amen there's something about that just like we get come

well and jesus made a well-known [Music] i keep coming back to the well hallelujah let's just stand and just give a little praise to the lord as we dismiss amen isn't good to serve him we serve such an awesome god we serve a god that's here for us he'll shake heaven and earth for you and i we just stand on that promise of god don't falter from it don't back up from it look my brother and sister if the bride is on the earth and the next pandemic is 20 times worse catch this please if we're still on the earth and the next pandemic comes and it's 20 times worse the power of god will be anointed on you 20 times more hallelujah we will not as it were fall behind we don't have to become a victim of satan's little debauchery but the power of god will just come and when satan comes in like a flood oh hallelujah the standard just keeps raising up whoa i'll tell you what i think i could just have a little run around jericho's walls right now amen i got nothing to be afraid of i got nothing to worry about next pandemic well you know what somebody said the other day but there's believers that have passed away from this well my brother and sister i i stand so strongly on this uh lord forgive me if i'm wrong but um god was thumbing through his calendar god didn't say oh there's a pandemic i guess they're going to go god said there they are this was the time i pointed for them to go home and he called them and they'll be like a brother testified his father dying and he said his dad's like son son son i'm ready to go no don son i'm ready to go don't be calling me back here i'm ready to go oh is that beautiful so satan have your pandemic and your little missionaries you know he's got some apostles of his own hallelujah but it's apostle of false doctrine it's apostle of
