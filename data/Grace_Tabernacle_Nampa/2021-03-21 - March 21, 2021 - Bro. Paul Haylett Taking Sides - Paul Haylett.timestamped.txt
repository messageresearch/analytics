[40:59] the lord wanted me to speak
[41:01] this morning the others were kind of
[41:03] harsh and judgmental
[41:05] kind of called us to the carpet softened

[41:09] and uh brought it to a place that we can
[41:11] all walk out without feeling too bad
[41:13] about ourselves today
[41:15] amen so you know i just want to a few
[41:18] things that we
[41:19] sometimes you know are in the back ready
[41:21] to do that sharing prayer requests and
[41:23] we kind of
[41:25] just go blank um just been on my heart i
[41:28] haven't texted him the last little bit
[41:30] and i should but
[41:31] my dear brother manasseh off to school
[41:34] we need to remember him in prayer
[41:36] amen we want him to come back now when i
[41:39] say this i don't mean it to be
[41:41] intellectual but we want him to come
[41:42] back with a wonderful education
[41:45] a great experience he's got some good
[41:47] christian
[41:48] friends in school and
[41:51] some encouragement so let's just make
[41:53] sure we remember our brother manasseh
[41:55] and then you know brother jason i don't
[41:58] know exactly what happened i've kind of
[42:00] heard some stories but i text him this
[42:03] morning
[42:04] you know he texts me and said i won't be
[42:06] there i've hurt my knee
[42:08] and i tried to get him to see if what i
[42:11] was told was true but he wouldn't tell
[42:13] me
[42:14] all he said was what happened was i was
[42:18] acting like i was 17 and i forgot i was
[42:20] 47.

[43:14] known
[43:15] when i was young what i know now but
[43:18] you see this is the journey
[43:22] and you can take that in the natural
[43:24] certainly
[43:26] you know i say this jokingly but i i
[43:27] hope you understand the merit of that if
[43:29] we had that kind of wisdom we'd all just
[43:32] bought up
[43:32] all the real estate we could have bought
[43:35] up
[43:37] but you see we don't and we can't go
[43:41] back
[43:43] nor the truth be known do we want to go
[43:45] back
[43:46] because we're one day closer to our lord
[43:48] jesus christ
[43:50] one day closer to walking the streets as
[43:54] it is
[43:54] of gold and we wouldn't want to go back
[43:59] now you know
[44:02] sometimes i i shouldn't but i can't help
[44:06] myself
[44:08] for the annik and sister sharon
[44:12] would you please come
[44:15] don't look at me so shocked
[44:22] you know there's beautiful times in our
[44:26] life
[44:27] and uh we we
[44:31] experience right up here don't be
[44:34] bashful
[44:36] right up front and center
[44:39] you know i have and i hope you
[44:41] understand when i say this
[44:44] that it's in a godly fashion but i have
[44:46] a great fondness for my sister sharon
[44:53] i've you also have got to witness this
[44:56] journey
[44:57] that we all must come on and must come
[44:59] to the place in our own life where we're
[45:01] convinced
[45:03] of who we are and what we were called
[45:05] for
[45:07] and you know sister sharon has
[45:10] shared this story about this wonderful
[45:12] man
[45:14] that she loved this wonderful man but he
[45:17] was all the way off
[45:18] in morocco and
[45:21] you know at points in time it would have
[45:23] seemed almost like
[45:24] an impossibility government saying no
[45:27] more people coming government say this
[45:29] government say that
[45:31] all that matters is what god says
[45:34] and when god says i've ordained this
[45:38] then he will shake heaven and earth to
[45:41] bring it to pass
[45:42] and i am very pleased today to
[45:46] be able to announce their upcoming
[45:48] wedding
[45:50] on the 15th of may and
[45:54] i just would ask you church rally around
[45:57] our brother and sister and let's make
[45:59] this
[45:59] a beautiful glorious day for them
[46:02] amen you know it's it's a
[46:06] just a lovely lovely thing
[46:10] i believe with all of my heart
[46:13] i remember a time embarrassed my dear
[46:15] sister sharon but
[46:16] i remember a time as she was going
[46:19] through transition in her life
[46:21] she made a statement she might not even
[46:24] remember but she says
[46:25] i want to be the kind of wife
[46:30] that my fiance wants me to be
[46:33] i want to be a godly wife
[46:40] amen the word of god says
[46:43] he hears our hearts christ amen that's
[46:46] right
[46:48] all i can say is god bless both of you
[46:50] and we look forward to that day
[46:53] lean on the church can we say amen
[46:55] church lean on the church we make this a
[46:57] lovely day
[46:58] and so praise the lord we give just a
[47:01] little hand clap to thank you lord
[47:03] [Applause]
[47:08] amen
[47:11] mr sharon god bless you i hope i didn't
[47:12] embarrass you guys
[47:14] man amen praise the lord just
[47:17] love that just a lovely time
[47:20] you know part of it is i i hate to admit
[47:23] this but i am
[47:24] down inside just a little bit of a
[47:26] sentimental
[47:28] character and uh you know
[47:35] i look at some pictures as we've moved
[47:37] that have been kind of
[47:39] pulled back out of obscurity and one of
[47:42] them is a
[47:42] picture of my lovely bride
[47:46] when she was probably about 11 or 12 or
[47:49] 13 or something like that
[47:50] and then one a year or so later and then
[47:53] a picture i have of who she was when i
[47:57] started to court her
[47:59] and then the final picture that's there
[48:01] in that pile is
[48:02] her as an old married lady with three
[48:04] children
[48:06] [Music]
[48:08] and she just keeps getting prettier and
[48:10] prettier
[48:14] want to type that now this bride of
[48:18] jesus christ
[48:20] is getting more precious in his sight
[48:24] each and every day
[48:27] that's the kind of relationship we have
[48:29] with our lord and savior our bridegroom
[48:33] and that's the kind of relationship we
[48:35] should be having here
[48:37] in the natural and so let's just look at
[48:41] one another and remember who we are
[48:45] god ordained us to be together be a body
[48:48] of believers
[48:50] amen let's not look
[48:54] as the scripture shows so aptly the
[48:56] story of
[48:58] ham shem jabeth
[49:03] ham looked on the backside or nakedness
[49:07] of his father
[49:08] unashamedly
[49:12] wasn't the right attitude god judged him
[49:14] for that
[49:15] let's not look on the back side let's
[49:18] look at one another's strengths
[49:20] love one another pray for one another
[49:23] amen i want to speak to you this morning
[49:25] on
[49:25] redemptions manifestation amen once
[49:28] again
[49:29] for this must must come forth
[49:32] amen that's what my knee feels like this
[49:34] morning right there
[49:36] amen this i want to take a title this
[49:39] morning of taking sides
[49:42] so i forgot to mention sister emmy i
[49:44] think she must be caring for
[49:46] brother jason let's remember her also in
[49:49] prayer today
[49:50] amen taking sides is just a very simple
[49:54] thought but i believe it will become
[49:56] evident to you in a few minutes
[49:58] let's go in our bibles to second
[49:59] corinthians the fourth
[50:01] chapter there is several verses here
[50:05] and we will just
[50:08] take that as we're going to read the
[50:10] whole chapter we'll take a portion of
[50:13] that
[50:13] let you be seated amen second
[50:16] corinthians the fourth chapter
[50:22] aren't you glad that you have a ministry
[50:24] amen
[50:25] amen every one of us has a ministry
[50:29] you know a mother a housewife may never
[50:32] set foot on the street corner she may
[50:34] never
[50:35] uh do that but she has one of the
[50:37] greatest ministries that was ever
[50:39] given and we see that each one of us as
[50:42] we live our life
[50:43] in the world around us that we have a
[50:46] ministry
[50:47] you know it's pretty funny um you know
[50:50] just to see how things and it can come
[50:52] so
[50:52] openly come to your face and there's a
[50:56] mechanic that works on
[50:57] a certain piece of equipment that we own
[51:00] that brand and
[51:01] we were having trouble are still having
[51:04] trouble
[51:06] removing a part that someone else in the
[51:08] past has
[51:09] halted on way too tight and the man says
[51:12] i will give you the secret
[51:15] uh how to remove that for a bottle of
[51:17] whiskey
[51:21] so we're over there at the company's
[51:23] shop and
[51:25] there's another farmer there that owns
[51:27] several choppers and
[51:28] he goes you know we were just talking
[51:31] about this and i was like what's that
[51:33] and he goes
[51:34] whether your religion would allow you to
[51:36] buy a man a bottle of whiskey
[51:41] and we come to the conclusion that was a
[51:43] no
[51:45] you've got the right conclusion you see
[51:48] my brother and sister
[51:50] i've never even talked
[51:54] about christ to them i don't want to
[51:57] sound boastful but i've tried to live it
[51:59] in front of them and they recognize
[52:02] this guy is not like everyone else not
[52:05] like all the rest of our customers all
[52:07] the rest of these people
[52:09] and that's what we want to live we want
[52:11] to live a life that even if you don't
[52:13] talk to them in that fashion they
[52:14] recognize
[52:15] you're different and i know that you do
[52:18] that i know that your life is that way
[52:20] and we all have our circumstance that we
[52:23] live in our little realm that we live in
[52:25] and
[52:26] you know it used to be at a time i might
[52:28] have been embarrassed
[52:30] uh of of something like that but you
[52:32] know i just look at him and
[52:34] brother david and i was joking a little
[52:36] bit more about that older and bolder and
[52:38] uh you know and it's basically instead
[52:40] of being embarrassed it's more like and
[52:42] don't you forget it
[52:46] you see i'm i'm not ashamed of who i am
[52:48] i'm not ashamed of what god called me to
[52:51] be
[52:51] and we as a group of believers are not
[52:54] ashamed
[52:55] of this glorious gift of this gospel
[52:57] that has been given to
[52:59] us and say thank you lord for that
[53:02] amen therefore seeing we have
[53:05] this ministry
[53:09] amen we have a ministry
[53:12] as we have received mercy we faint not
[53:15] but have renounced the hidden things of
[53:18] dishonesty
[53:20] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[53:23] the word of god
[53:24] deceitfully but by manifestation
[53:28] of the truth commending ourselves to
[53:30] every man's conscience
[53:32] in the sight of god but if our gospel be
[53:36] hid it is hid to them that are lost
[53:41] in whom the god of this world
[53:44] hath blinded the minds of them which
[53:47] believe
[53:47] not lest the light of the glorious
[53:50] gospel of christ
[53:52] who is the image of god should shine
[53:54] unto them
[53:56] for we preach not ourselves but christ
[53:59] jesus the lord and
[54:00] ourselves your servants for jesus
[54:03] sake amen for god who commanded the
[54:06] light to shine
[54:08] out of darkness has shined in our
[54:11] hearts to give the light
[54:14] of the knowledge of the glory of god in
[54:17] the face
[54:19] of jesus christ but we have this
[54:22] treasure
[54:24] in earth and vessels that the excellency
[54:26] of the power may be of god
[54:28] and not of us we are troubled on every
[54:32] side
[54:33] yet not distressed we are perplexed
[54:36] but not in despair persecuted
[54:40] but not forsaken cast down
[54:43] but not destroyed heavenly father we
[54:47] just asked lord your blessings upon this
[54:50] thought today lord upon the reading of
[54:52] your word ask you to lead us
[54:54] guide us be with each one father the
[54:56] desires of their hearts
[54:58] we ask this in the name of jesus christ
[55:01] amen
[55:02] you may be seated
[55:09] i'll back up a little bit we're troubled
[55:14] on every side yet not distressed
[55:20] every side they'll not be one aspect of
[55:23] your life
[55:25] that will go on trouble
[55:28] and in taking that in context
[55:32] your natural life
[55:36] will have troubles your spiritual life
[55:40] will be beset with troubles
[55:44] you see the scripture tells us that
[55:48] we'll have the same issues as the
[55:52] unbeliever
[55:54] hard to believe isn't it we think
[55:55] somehow as believers we have an
[55:57] exemption card
[55:59] but the only exemption card that we have
[56:02] is jesus christ himself amen so there
[56:06] there's
[56:06] the thing that that uh puts a stop to
[56:09] the devil's plan
[56:11] his his program is detoured halted
[56:16] taken apart as a word dismantled
[56:19] only because of the relationship we have
[56:23] which is not just a shoulder rubbing or
[56:26] elbow-rubbing relationship
[56:28] reminds me of a story once a man who is
[56:30] being arrested
[56:32] and uh he makes a declaration he says uh
[56:35] you can't do this to me i'm a friend of
[56:37] the governor
[56:38] and the policeman as he's putting the
[56:40] cuffs on him says
[56:42] but is he your friend
[56:45] so you know just by words we can make
[56:48] claims but my brother and sister we want
[56:50] that to be
[56:51] more than just a claim we want it to be
[56:54] a reality
[56:56] amen persecuted but not forsaken cast
[57:00] down but not destroyed
[57:02] always bearing about in the body of the
[57:04] dying of the lord jesus that the life
[57:06] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[57:09] our body
[57:11] for which live are always delivered
[57:16] live i mean live life
[57:21] live for we which
[57:24] live are always delivered unto death for
[57:27] jesus sake
[57:28] that the life also of jesus might be
[57:30] made manifest
[57:31] in our mortal flesh so then death
[57:33] worketh
[57:34] in us but life in you
[57:37] we having the same spirit of faith
[57:41] according as it is written i believed
[57:44] therefore have i spoken we also believe
[57:48] and therefore speak knowing that he
[57:51] which
[57:51] raised up the lord jesus shall raise
[57:55] up also us also by jesus
[57:58] and shall present us with you for all
[58:01] things are for your sakes that the
[58:03] abundant grace might
[58:05] through the thanksgiving of many redound
[58:07] to the glory of
[58:09] god for which cause we faint not
[58:12] but through our outward man perish yet
[58:15] the inward man
[58:16] is renewed day by day for our light
[58:19] affliction which is but for a moment
[58:21] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[58:23] eternal weight of glory while we look
[58:26] not
[58:26] at the things which are seen but at the
[58:29] things which are not seen
[58:30] for the things which are seen are
[58:32] temporal but the things which are not
[58:34] seen
[58:35] are eternal we ask once again god's
[58:38] blessings upon the word
[58:40] amen i don't know if you guys ever just
[58:44] have a nervous moment but i just
[58:45] experienced one there or just
[58:47] almost couldn't even read well praise
[58:50] the lord the lord's in control we'll
[58:51] just
[58:52] press forward anyhow i think it might
[58:55] have started when my mic
[58:57] receiver just fell off and
[59:01] anyway praise the lord hallelujah
[59:05] no you know look at this i want to just
[59:07] go down through these scriptures
[59:08] this morning as we were studying this
[59:10] the scripture struck me
[59:12] uh how it is kind of going back as we
[59:15] were into the three kinds of believers
[59:17] and the little
[59:18] chart that comes down we'll look at this
[59:20] my brother and sister and realize how
[59:22] interconnected all of this is we'll see
[59:25] how
[59:25] you know by god's grace kind of getting
[59:27] back on that track again
[59:29] we'll see how it is so interconnected
[59:32] that uh wherever the word of god is
[59:35] preached it will attract
[59:37] and it doesn't always attract um
[59:40] just the believer uh you know sometimes
[59:43] it attracts
[59:44] others it'll track the critic amen
[59:46] someone who has a great need or desire
[59:48] to
[59:49] criticize something if he didn't have
[59:51] the gospel to criticize he'd have to
[59:53] move on to
[59:54] something else but the gospel is very
[59:56] attractive there's a feeling
[59:58] that goes with that a sense of
[59:59] gratification
[1:00:01] uh and so you know it's it's uh just
[1:00:03] something that has to be recognized and
[1:00:05] lived with you might say so we have this
[1:00:08] ministry and
[1:00:09] by god's grace we faint not it would be
[1:00:12] satan's desire to cause us
[1:00:14] in the hour we live in to become weary
[1:00:17] and well doing and
[1:00:18] just the cares of life you have some of
[1:00:20] those don't you i would just slowly wear
[1:00:22] you down and to the point that you would
[1:00:24] just give
[1:00:24] up and say you know god does not hear my
[1:00:26] prayer god doesn't really care about
[1:00:29] us this is just a labor with no reward
[1:00:32] as it were
[1:00:33] nothing fruitful but you see my brother
[1:00:35] and sister
[1:00:36] we've been commissioned by the word here
[1:00:38] as paul is speaking to the corinthians
[1:00:41] he says as we receive mercy we think not
[1:00:43] and i believe every one of us today
[1:00:44] would say we've received mercy amen
[1:00:47] but we've renounced the hidden things of
[1:00:49] dishonesty not walking in craftiness
[1:00:52] now if we just applied this to the
[1:00:54] ministry only it would be a perfect
[1:00:56] fit my brother and sister because
[1:00:58] certainly in the day that we live in the
[1:00:59] prophet of god said
[1:01:01] that one of his indictments would be to
[1:01:03] the
[1:01:04] the preachers that uh would hold to the
[1:01:06] meal ticket of their denomination
[1:01:09] instead of preaching the truth to the
[1:01:11] people while they might see that what
[1:01:13] they are connected to or
[1:01:15] associated with is not entirely
[1:01:17] straightforward or honest as it is in
[1:01:19] its approach to the scripture
[1:01:21] they still view their 401k and their
[1:01:24] benefits and etc
[1:01:25] above that and you know as even some
[1:01:28] spoke to the prophet what where would we
[1:01:30] go
[1:01:31] what would we do well you know brother
[1:01:33] branham said he would rather eat soda
[1:01:35] crackers and drink branch water
[1:01:36] and preach the truth than to have some
[1:01:39] kind of retirement or some kind of
[1:01:41] security
[1:01:42] in a earthly thing amen so we don't walk
[1:01:46] in craftiness
[1:01:47] not handling the word of god deceitfully
[1:01:49] but by manifestation of the truth
[1:01:51] commending
[1:01:52] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[1:01:54] the sight of god and
[1:01:56] so you know it's there that really the
[1:01:58] only only benefit that we have
[1:02:00] sons and daughters of god my brothers
[1:02:02] and sisters my friends
[1:02:04] only benefit we have is to be honest
[1:02:06] with ourself
[1:02:07] and to be honest with those around us
[1:02:10] amen and when we are honest
[1:02:12] with ourself then we will be honest with
[1:02:15] god because we will literally
[1:02:17] judge ourselves and we will find what is
[1:02:20] lacking
[1:02:20] and we will resolve by the grace of god
[1:02:23] to fix
[1:02:24] that and so as we move forward in that
[1:02:27] uh
[1:02:27] we we see the the effect that the word
[1:02:30] would have upon us
[1:02:32] now in verse 3 it said if our gospel be
[1:02:35] hid
[1:02:36] it is hid to them that are lost
[1:02:39] so my brother and sister this is kind of
[1:02:42] a stark reality of the word of god
[1:02:45] that and that is the simple fact of the
[1:02:47] three kinds of believers
[1:02:49] uh there is the unbeliever and uh
[1:02:53] so we'll look at that and see his
[1:02:55] position clearly identified
[1:02:57] it gets a little fuzzy or a little
[1:02:59] cloudy when we start to talk about the
[1:03:01] unbeliever and uh then as we look it
[1:03:04] into the realm of the believer it still
[1:03:08] can be a little fuzzy and a little
[1:03:09] cloudy because
[1:03:10] satan would come and make such a
[1:03:13] commotion such a distraction of
[1:03:17] the human element and you know what i'm
[1:03:19] talking about that
[1:03:20] that part of yourself that you don't
[1:03:22] like that part of you you struggle with
[1:03:24] that thing that always raises its ugly
[1:03:26] head and
[1:03:27] you have to deal with it day by day amen
[1:03:31] so there's a few humans here i'll just
[1:03:33] say amen for the rest of you
[1:03:35] amen but if the gospel be hid it's hid
[1:03:38] to them
[1:03:38] that are lost and so here we are living
[1:03:41] in this day and age
[1:03:42] that the gospel my brother and sister if
[1:03:45] it's hidden it leaves a paradox that's
[1:03:49] in place
[1:03:49] now you know we don't go around saying
[1:03:52] now if you don't see this like i see
[1:03:54] this
[1:03:54] you're lost we have no right to take
[1:03:57] that position
[1:03:58] but you'll find fundamentally that over
[1:04:01] time
[1:04:01] if god does not open their eyes does not
[1:04:04] anoint their
[1:04:05] ears uh does not touch the heart that
[1:04:08] man
[1:04:08] can go on all of his life very sincere
[1:04:12] brother branham says in fact they will
[1:04:13] be more sincere than the true believer
[1:04:16] so there'll be a great work that is
[1:04:17] there but they believe it's right but
[1:04:20] it's not
[1:04:21] according to the plan of god and they
[1:04:23] will not see the scripture you know you
[1:04:25] can have a
[1:04:26] i i would not really like to use the
[1:04:28] word debate but you can have a
[1:04:30] strong conversation with someone and
[1:04:32] pretty much according to the things of
[1:04:34] this world that say well if you don't
[1:04:35] believe the trinity
[1:04:37] oh i do believe the trinity well then
[1:04:39] why don't you baptize in that because
[1:04:41] that's not what the bible said
[1:04:42] but that's what the church teaches so
[1:04:45] you
[1:04:45] are off you are wrong if you don't teach
[1:04:49] what all of this the majority cannot be
[1:04:51] wrong well that's not scriptural in
[1:04:53] itself
[1:04:54] amen the scripture shows us clearly it's
[1:04:56] a small group of people
[1:04:58] amen so we look at that but saints we
[1:05:01] cannot come along and say we're right
[1:05:03] because we're a small group of people
[1:05:05] amen we're right because it lines up
[1:05:07] with the word
[1:05:09] and even then we can have the word and
[1:05:11] have the wrong
[1:05:13] spirit and attitude and be wrong
[1:05:17] so have almost the whole ingredient
[1:05:20] i'll tell on sister jerry and i probably
[1:05:22] will get this wrong but
[1:05:23] i always mess up between baking soda and
[1:05:26] baking powder but i remember one time
[1:05:28] sister jerry made some cookies
[1:05:30] and uh you know they looked so delicious
[1:05:32] but they were kind of flat looking and
[1:05:34] and uh so i grabbed one and i thought
[1:05:36] man what is wrong with this and
[1:05:38] sister jerry come along what was it
[1:05:39] honey which one did you substituted
[1:05:42] you don't remember
[1:05:46] okay well anyway she just you know
[1:05:49] looking up saw the baking and just
[1:05:51] put it in the cookies and wrong result
[1:05:55] see so just because we have made
[1:05:57] something that looks good
[1:05:59] uh it isn't you know we have to have all
[1:06:01] the right ingredients we can have the
[1:06:03] flour
[1:06:04] the eggs all the rest of this but if we
[1:06:06] add one ingredient that's not right we
[1:06:08] have skewered the whole thing
[1:06:10] but i'll tell you how terrible my sweet
[1:06:12] tooth is sometimes i ate the cookies
[1:06:14] anyhow
[1:06:15] amen but you look at this see so brother
[1:06:18] branham clearly shows us
[1:06:19] the three kinds of believers and we look
[1:06:22] at this and realize this
[1:06:23] unbeliever as we'll just touch on him
[1:06:26] for a moment today
[1:06:27] you know i was thinking in the early
[1:06:28] hours of today you know
[1:06:30] in a way there's really not a lot to
[1:06:32] preach about on the unbeliever
[1:06:34] there's really you can go in the
[1:06:35] scripture you can show
[1:06:37] uh how that this is you know the seed or
[1:06:40] the fruit of the sun or perdition
[1:06:42] we can show how that where that spirit
[1:06:44] started and how it's moved down through
[1:06:46] the ages
[1:06:47] come right over in the ark how all of
[1:06:49] this took place we can do that
[1:06:51] but really ultimately there's just not a
[1:06:53] lot to preach about them because
[1:06:55] my brother and sister it's very simple
[1:06:57] cut and dried they're an unbeliever
[1:06:59] amen so as he speaks of the unbeliever
[1:07:02] you realize that this is the one who
[1:07:05] won't
[1:07:06] be disappointed in the life that he's
[1:07:08] lived
[1:07:10] in fact if he ever has a disappointment
[1:07:12] in that context it will be when
[1:07:14] he finds out that god is really real
[1:07:16] there's where his disappointment will
[1:07:18] come but
[1:07:18] you see he never thought there was
[1:07:20] anything in it it didn't mean nothing to
[1:07:23] him
[1:07:23] never moved him never felt stirred never
[1:07:26] had an attraction
[1:07:27] and so in that he's not disappointed and
[1:07:30] ultimately when he comes he'll stand
[1:07:32] before god and say yep this is kind of
[1:07:34] what i expected
[1:07:35] uh kind of had a deal so he's not really
[1:07:38] that disappointed uh the unbeliever my
[1:07:41] brother and sister
[1:07:42] it's a little bit different story
[1:07:44] because the unbeliever has
[1:07:46] confidence in his belief
[1:07:51] the unbeliever has confidence in his
[1:07:53] belief
[1:07:55] the make believer has confidence
[1:07:59] in his belief but let's get down to what
[1:08:02] really matters today and that is
[1:08:05] the believer has confidence in what he
[1:08:08] believes
[1:08:10] you see we should not be tossed around
[1:08:12] driven by every wind of doctrine and
[1:08:15] and tossed around by everything
[1:08:16] happening around us
[1:08:18] in the world we live in today i i think
[1:08:20] it's quite interesting i'll just bring
[1:08:22] just a tad bit of a note of politics as
[1:08:24] it were because i believe it is relevant
[1:08:27] this stage is set we have taken now i'm
[1:08:29] going to take a little context maybe
[1:08:31] i'll pull it a little bit far
[1:08:33] but i believe this is the crux of all
[1:08:35] political
[1:08:36] uh maneuvering in in history
[1:08:40] and the prophet of god said uh you know
[1:08:42] concerning say a pastor
[1:08:43] if you can't respect the man at least
[1:08:45] respect the office right
[1:08:47] and so we bring this into the realm of
[1:08:49] politics and
[1:08:50] and the president of the united states
[1:08:52] uh called the president or or whatever
[1:08:55] you call it ruler of russia
[1:08:57] called him a killer and so an absolute
[1:09:01] disrespect that is there
[1:09:04] now you see my brother and sister
[1:09:07] the man who knows he's in a strong
[1:09:09] position has no need to call names
[1:09:13] to anyone around him he knows who he is
[1:09:15] he knows where he stands
[1:09:19] so right there the president of the
[1:09:23] united states has declared
[1:09:25] i i have a complex i feel weak
[1:09:29] and the only way i ever learned to play
[1:09:31] on the playground was to call names
[1:09:34] the problem is he's calling names to
[1:09:36] someone who learned
[1:09:37] to play on the playground by giving
[1:09:39] bloody noses
[1:09:42] now i don't know if you follow this i
[1:09:43] hope you see where i'm going
[1:09:45] they now set down in alaska to discuss
[1:09:48] between the united states and china
[1:09:51] and the us's ambassador goes through all
[1:09:53] this very very soft-soaked deal about
[1:09:57] human rights and trade issues and and
[1:09:59] trade secrets and all of this
[1:10:02] and then the trade representative or the
[1:10:04] ambassador from
[1:10:05] china says um it's you guys that have
[1:10:09] the problem you've got
[1:10:10] no ground to stand and negotiate with
[1:10:14] us you know in
[1:10:17] playground that would be walk over
[1:10:23] and the man smiles and takes it and
[1:10:25] comes back
[1:10:26] well we know we have problems
[1:10:32] i just bring that up because i want you
[1:10:34] to understand
[1:10:35] that we're living in a world that the
[1:10:39] natural
[1:10:40] types the spiritual
[1:10:45] the church no longer has a position of
[1:10:47] authority
[1:10:50] the church talking overall is now come
[1:10:54] to a place that whatever the devil says
[1:10:57] the devil does
[1:10:59] with no recourse prophet of god said
[1:11:03] whenever we back
[1:11:04] up on the word of god we doubt the word
[1:11:06] we move away from the true context of
[1:11:08] the word
[1:11:09] that we have grounded the word and we
[1:11:11] make it powerless
[1:11:13] and so it won't matter how much we quote
[1:11:15] a prophet it won't matter how many songs
[1:11:17] we sing and how loud we clap our hands
[1:11:20] if we have grounded the word of god it
[1:11:23] will become powerless to us
[1:11:25] as a body of believers so we have to
[1:11:28] come
[1:11:29] in a position of authority standing on
[1:11:32] our god-given rights and i'm not talking
[1:11:35] about as citizens of a country
[1:11:37] because a prophet showed us you give up
[1:11:39] that right and give it to christ so that
[1:11:42] you can follow him amen so
[1:11:44] we don't take our rights as it were
[1:11:47] and so you look at this you see the
[1:11:49] unbeliever is totally confident in his
[1:11:51] belief a make-believer is confident in
[1:11:53] his belief
[1:11:54] and the real believer also must have
[1:11:57] confidence
[1:11:58] in what he believes because i didn't put
[1:12:01] the quote in here i had to just shorten
[1:12:03] it there's just
[1:12:03] always so much stuff that is relevant
[1:12:06] but the prophet of god says now if
[1:12:07] you're going to have faith for your
[1:12:09] healing
[1:12:10] you cannot uh take that claim your
[1:12:12] healing
[1:12:13] and lay it down and come back at another
[1:12:16] time
[1:12:17] and pick it back up and expect to get
[1:12:20] the results
[1:12:20] you have to claim your healing you have
[1:12:23] to hold
[1:12:24] on to that and whether you see something
[1:12:27] change or you see the effect at that
[1:12:29] moment
[1:12:30] you have to stand and say i am healed in
[1:12:33] the name of jesus christ
[1:12:35] because when you lay it down you have
[1:12:37] rendered it powerless
[1:12:38] you can't lay it down and pick it up at
[1:12:40] random and the believer
[1:12:42] wanting to have faith in the word of god
[1:12:45] in the plan of god
[1:12:46] cannot alternate between monday tuesday
[1:12:49] wednesday thursday friday saturday back
[1:12:51] to sunday
[1:12:52] and lay it down and pick it up and lay
[1:12:54] it down and pick it up
[1:12:55] we either are sons and daughters of god
[1:12:58] or we're not
[1:13:00] amen we cannot say well on this day i am
[1:13:03] and this day i
[1:13:04] ain't this day i did this and i i feel
[1:13:07] sorry so i must not be a real christian
[1:13:09] no my brother and sister you take a hold
[1:13:12] of that word
[1:13:13] with a bulldog faith and you don't let
[1:13:16] go of it and i don't care how many
[1:13:18] mistakes you made
[1:13:19] what kind of circumstance you face you
[1:13:21] hold on to that and say you know what
[1:13:23] god said he'd never lose a one and i
[1:13:26] belong to him
[1:13:27] hallelujah see satan's trying to get us
[1:13:30] to become and this is where i was really
[1:13:32] heading in that whole thing sorry i'm
[1:13:34] long-winded
[1:13:34] satan does not want us to be as the term
[1:13:37] we use in the world a waffler
[1:13:40] we are oh we're strong we're christians
[1:13:43] we have promises
[1:13:44] devil please don't hit me again no we
[1:13:47] can't do that my brother and sister you
[1:13:49] have to stand strong on the word of god
[1:13:51] prophet of god said you satan's god is
[1:13:53] lit coming to you
[1:13:54] but you just go ahead and take that lick
[1:13:56] and get right back up and say it doesn't
[1:13:58] matter how hard
[1:13:59] and you knock me down yeah i got a
[1:14:01] little mud on my face i'm still a son of
[1:14:03] god no matter what you did
[1:14:05] because i can assure you if we could
[1:14:06] talk to job right now he would tell you
[1:14:09] i
[1:14:09] did not feel like an overcomer that
[1:14:12] enjoyed god's pleasure
[1:14:14] i felt like a man that had come a
[1:14:16] complete
[1:14:17] failure and god comes along and says hey
[1:14:20] job
[1:14:21] what's going on where were you when this
[1:14:23] happened where were you when i did this
[1:14:25] where were you job and job realized i am
[1:14:28] such a small fraction
[1:14:29] of this whole picture and i want you to
[1:14:32] understand this morning without taking
[1:14:33] it negatively
[1:14:34] you yourself personal can someone say
[1:14:37] it's me
[1:14:38] amen are such a small factor in this
[1:14:42] plan of god
[1:14:43] but god wants us to fully participate
[1:14:47] in our small portion and that is brother
[1:14:50] david brought that up i thought that's
[1:14:51] interesting amen we'll just claim on
[1:14:53] that
[1:14:54] you know it's we got to come our job my
[1:14:57] brother and sister is to stand up and
[1:14:59] say lord here i am
[1:15:00] and all that i am and all that i will
[1:15:03] ever be
[1:15:04] lord i wanted to give it to you i don't
[1:15:07] want to hold on to any portion
[1:15:10] in that amazing house such a hard job
[1:15:16] amen our job we don't have to make the
[1:15:20] promises of god
[1:15:21] we don't have to make this come to pass
[1:15:26] what we got to do is give ourselves to
[1:15:28] god that he can have
[1:15:30] liberty to bring that to pass
[1:15:33] amen and yet
[1:15:37] you would think we ourselves with one
[1:15:39] hammer and chisel made mount rushmore
[1:15:44] i have had to do so much to serve god
[1:15:48] i have labored so hard through the years
[1:15:52] i have fought great battles you haven't
[1:15:54] done nothing
[1:15:58] if you were victorious it's because you
[1:16:00] said lord
[1:16:01] i'm casting lord i i read your word i
[1:16:04] heard your word i'm
[1:16:05] casting all my cares on you
[1:16:11] but you know we've heard it many times
[1:16:13] and it gets kind of old but
[1:16:14] one more time certainly won't kill us we
[1:16:17] haul our cares up and we lay them on the
[1:16:19] altar
[1:16:20] and then when the service is over we
[1:16:23] pick them up
[1:16:25] we pack them out of church with us
[1:16:27] that's it
[1:16:31] and of course i fixed it
[1:16:36] no no it didn't change a single thing
[1:16:41] because that's not really trust that's
[1:16:44] not really confidence
[1:16:45] i let the lord carry my burdens for an
[1:16:47] all of 10 minutes or 20 or 30 or 40 or
[1:16:50] however long brother paul preached
[1:16:52] but i took it home with me because i
[1:16:53] don't want to misplace that burden
[1:16:56] you see each one is manifesting their
[1:17:00] belief
[1:17:02] you know it's kind of interesting
[1:17:06] i don't know if it was a teaching or
[1:17:07] just a certain atmosphere but
[1:17:10] you run into people that don't really
[1:17:12] like to hear the preacher
[1:17:14] preaching on manifesting
[1:17:17] now my brother and sister this word has
[1:17:19] to be manifested
[1:17:21] we have to get it from the page as it
[1:17:24] were because
[1:17:25] we will read on this i believe i
[1:17:27] included that quote
[1:17:28] that that is the written word of god
[1:17:30] that is god himself
[1:17:32] we've got to get it from that and it's
[1:17:33] got to come to life
[1:17:35] and so the germ of life is in the word
[1:17:38] so if we're going to manifest the word
[1:17:40] of god
[1:17:41] that means that word is going to be in
[1:17:43] us and we can say we have the word in us
[1:17:45] but if there's no manifesting we have to
[1:17:47] doubt whether it really is in there
[1:17:50] my brother and sister you can have a
[1:17:52] planter unit plug up on a planter
[1:17:55] and you will you will go and if you
[1:17:57] don't have a monitor let's just say you
[1:17:59] don't have a monitor you don't have any
[1:18:00] computer control on that planter
[1:18:02] the only way you will find out that
[1:18:04] there was a problem is when the seed
[1:18:06] comes up
[1:18:07] and there is nothing growing there
[1:18:12] so we can make all the claims we want
[1:18:14] sorry for speaking farmer language
[1:18:17] but we can make all the claims we want
[1:18:19] i've got the seed i've got the seed i've
[1:18:21] got the seed
[1:18:22] if we've got the seed and i say we i
[1:18:24] include myself in there
[1:18:26] if we've got the seed it will show
[1:18:28] itself
[1:18:30] it will come to life it will be
[1:18:33] manifested it will come out of the soil
[1:18:35] as it were
[1:18:36] in the light of the sun and it will grow
[1:18:39] and it will prove
[1:18:40] that it's a true seed and not something
[1:18:43] else amen
[1:18:44] the cockle burn no matter how much it
[1:18:46] says i am corn i am corn i am corn
[1:18:48] the kuckleberg can never be corn
[1:18:52] and ultimately the cockle burn no matter
[1:18:54] how well it fit into the field
[1:18:57] how green it looked like everything else
[1:18:59] will produce
[1:19:00] cuckleber and it always amazes me when
[1:19:04] people say i don't like it i don't
[1:19:06] you know when when the preacher starts
[1:19:08] to preach on manifesting
[1:19:09] i don't like to hear that well my
[1:19:12] brother and sister
[1:19:12] something's wrong because i asked the
[1:19:16] lord
[1:19:16] continually let me manifest
[1:19:19] your life let me manifest your nature
[1:19:23] let it not be paul with the world seas
[1:19:26] but it let it be jesus christ that they
[1:19:28] see
[1:19:32] and if god didn't mean it he sure
[1:19:33] wouldn't included it in the word and
[1:19:35] we'll get to that in a minute
[1:19:36] amen he goes on in verse 5 says we
[1:19:40] preach not ourselves
[1:19:43] but christ jesus the lord and ourselves
[1:19:45] your servants for jesus saith
[1:19:47] for god who commanded the light to shine
[1:19:50] out of darkness
[1:19:51] has shined in our hearts to give the
[1:19:53] light of the knowledge
[1:19:55] of the glory of god in the face of jesus
[1:19:58] christ
[1:19:59] now i want you to look at this this is
[1:20:01] an incredible
[1:20:03] powerful brother and sister past tense
[1:20:06] statement yes sir
[1:20:10] this is not future tense
[1:20:16] are you with me
[1:20:22] for god who commanded
[1:20:25] that's not a future he commanded the
[1:20:28] light to shine out of darkness hath
[1:20:30] shined in our hearts
[1:20:34] half shine my brother and sister a
[1:20:36] searchlight let me use that for an
[1:20:38] example a searchlight
[1:20:40] only shines where it is pointed
[1:20:44] now where did god shine this he said he
[1:20:46] didn't say this life
[1:20:47] that i have shined in your intellect in
[1:20:50] your brain
[1:20:51] he didn't say i uh put it into your
[1:20:53] reasoning i put it into your
[1:20:55] job i put it into your education he said
[1:20:59] this
[1:20:59] light that has shined into your
[1:21:02] heart now i want you to catch this i
[1:21:05] hope that you do
[1:21:06] here look at this he shined it
[1:21:10] into our hearts because that's
[1:21:14] where the knowledge of the glory of god
[1:21:16] was at
[1:21:18] he couldn't shine it anywhere else but
[1:21:21] when he shined it into our hearts
[1:21:24] there's where the knowledge was it was
[1:21:26] reserved down
[1:21:27] in the heart of man and the word now
[1:21:30] shining on that light come to pass now
[1:21:33] we obviously have to use our intellect
[1:21:35] we think about it we read it we hear it
[1:21:37] we do these things
[1:21:38] but understanding of the word the
[1:21:40] manifestation of the word
[1:21:42] doesn't start in the mind it has to
[1:21:44] start in the heart
[1:21:46] and so there in the heart the light is
[1:21:48] shining this great beam of light
[1:21:51] is shining down into the heart and
[1:21:53] something inside that heart says you
[1:21:55] know what there's got to be more to god
[1:21:57] there's got to be more than what i have
[1:21:58] there's got to be more to this life that
[1:22:00] i'm living
[1:22:01] there's got to be more why am i yearning
[1:22:03] why am i hungry
[1:22:04] there must be more and the light is
[1:22:06] shining and the knowledge is coming to
[1:22:09] light
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:16] let me give you another farmer example
[1:22:18] if i can saints
[1:22:20] sometimes we carry seed from year to
[1:22:22] year and many times i will take seed out
[1:22:25] of those previous year's seed and
[1:22:27] i'll take an egg carton and i'll put
[1:22:29] cotton balls in it
[1:22:30] kids have you done that maybe we could
[1:22:33] do a little
[1:22:35] church experiment something for you for
[1:22:36] young peoples or something here
[1:22:40] but you take a cotton ball you put it in
[1:22:42] egg carton
[1:22:43] can't be one of them cardboard ones that
[1:22:44] won't work you'll just end up with a big
[1:22:46] soggy mess got to be a
[1:22:47] styrofoam one plastic one
[1:22:50] and you take a corn seed and you poke a
[1:22:53] hole in the cotton ball and you get it
[1:22:55] down in that bottom put that corn seed
[1:22:57] in there
[1:22:57] and get it wet don't fill it full of
[1:22:59] water just get it wet
[1:23:00] make sure it stays wet and that that
[1:23:03] right there not even
[1:23:04] in the earth
[1:23:08] will sprout and start to grow
[1:23:12] but you see you will never produce
[1:23:16] an era corn from an egg carton
[1:23:21] totally incapable
[1:23:24] neither will you germinate a seed and
[1:23:26] when it breaks through the soil
[1:23:29] put it into complete darkness and expect
[1:23:31] it to grow
[1:23:33] these are natural laws of nature that
[1:23:36] come right over into the spiritual world
[1:23:39] so you can be ignited an unbeliever
[1:23:42] can at some point in his life find a tad
[1:23:45] bit of inspiration
[1:23:46] but when it's put back into the darkness
[1:23:49] it will not grow
[1:23:50] make believer can sprout start to look
[1:23:53] like a corn plant
[1:23:54] but with no good soil the cares of life
[1:23:58] the scripture says
[1:23:59] choke it out and the thistle and all of
[1:24:02] that
[1:24:02] and it dies out my brother and sister
[1:24:05] how blessed we are can someone say thank
[1:24:07] you lord
[1:24:08] how blessed we are that not only was
[1:24:10] that seed of life placed in you and i
[1:24:13] god said i'm gonna plant it in good soil
[1:24:16] i'm not going to plant you in some
[1:24:18] styrofoam environment
[1:24:20] i'm not going to just give you a little
[1:24:22] drop of moisture
[1:24:23] here and there to kind of fool you into
[1:24:26] thinking but he said i'll plant you into
[1:24:29] the good soil
[1:24:30] of this gospel and i will bring you to
[1:24:33] life
[1:24:33] and i will produce a seed in you i will
[1:24:36] manifest
[1:24:37] the very life that is in me in you and
[1:24:40] you will come to fruition
[1:24:42] hallelujah it's just that simple but the
[1:24:45] devil makes it a whole complex thing
[1:24:47] about this person
[1:24:48] said and that person did and i disagree
[1:24:51] on doctrine here so i'm just leaving
[1:24:54] you know go look what the prophet of god
[1:24:56] talks about the queen of sheba
[1:24:57] he's there talking about her and he says
[1:24:59] you know she didn't come and say well
[1:25:01] now i'm going to go up there and pitch
[1:25:03] my tent and i'm going to go listen to
[1:25:05] him preach i'm going to listen to
[1:25:07] solomon
[1:25:07] and when he says one thing i don't like
[1:25:10] i'm packing my stuff
[1:25:11] up and i'm leaving no what did she do
[1:25:15] she said i'm here to prove whether this
[1:25:18] is the truth
[1:25:19] or not and if it's the truth i can't be
[1:25:22] driven from it
[1:25:26] amen got your enunciation wrong
[1:25:30] got your punctuation wrong william
[1:25:33] branham couldn't have been a prophet he
[1:25:34] was
[1:25:34] ignorant and unlearned
[1:25:41] praise the lord praise the lord
[1:25:45] yeah but did you know
[1:25:49] i have this on good authority one having
[1:25:52] been there in brother branham's library
[1:25:54] and
[1:25:56] through friendship with brother george
[1:26:00] brother branham had
[1:26:03] dictionaries and lexicons and
[1:26:09] theosauruses and dinosaurs and
[1:26:14] he didn't just ignorantly plow into
[1:26:16] these things
[1:26:19] without revelation without the
[1:26:23] searchlight
[1:26:24] zeroing in on the scene
[1:26:28] so i was looking up some words i won't
[1:26:29] go into the whole thing today i was
[1:26:31] looking up some words early this morning
[1:26:32] different things just kind of curious
[1:26:34] what the
[1:26:34] how the word broke down and it was
[1:26:36] amazing because these are all you know
[1:26:38] christian websites christian deals and
[1:26:41] and
[1:26:41] you know they want to take it all over
[1:26:43] the board have taken to greek you have
[1:26:44] to take it to this have to take it to
[1:26:46] that
[1:26:46] and ultimately my brother and sister it
[1:26:48] all comes back and every one of their
[1:26:49] definitions of that
[1:26:51] lacked any real spiritual spark
[1:26:54] they had rendered it down to just simply
[1:26:56] the use of a word
[1:26:58] well i'm telling you my brother and
[1:26:59] sister the use of the word is fine
[1:27:03] but it's gotta have life in it
[1:27:08] so see it shined in our hearts to give
[1:27:10] light to the knowledge of the glory of
[1:27:12] god in the heart
[1:27:14] amen fits right to the word right that
[1:27:16] line shine
[1:27:18] out of darkness shined in our hearts to
[1:27:20] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:27:22] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[1:27:25] i say thank you lord the light has
[1:27:27] shined amen the world's still running
[1:27:30] around in circles just talking to an
[1:27:31] individual
[1:27:32] the other day you know and you just kind
[1:27:34] of it breaks your heart
[1:27:36] to to hear people sincere people say i
[1:27:39] just want to be in the will of god
[1:27:45] stirs my heart sister jerry knows who
[1:27:47] i'm talking about
[1:27:48] i want to be in the will of god and i'm
[1:27:51] not being judgmental
[1:27:53] jerry and i are not done with this lady
[1:27:55] yet
[1:27:56] we'll just keep talking to her a little
[1:27:58] here a little there we have our
[1:28:00] opportunities
[1:28:02] but you see my brother and sister the
[1:28:04] light has shown in you
[1:28:06] that we recognize god's will
[1:28:09] is his word so we can't counter dick
[1:28:14] the word and then say
[1:28:17] i want god's will i want god's will all
[1:28:20] the time
[1:28:20] contradicting his word it will be by
[1:28:24] revelation it'll be by the shining of
[1:28:26] that light
[1:28:26] that an individual will realize while i
[1:28:28] was wanting god's will
[1:28:30] as it were a voice to tell me what to do
[1:28:32] i
[1:28:33] didn't realize it was already here it's
[1:28:36] already given to me
[1:28:40] see how blessed we are we are absolutely
[1:28:44] blessed beyond measure and i'm afraid
[1:28:45] saints sometimes we just don't realize
[1:28:47] how blessed we are
[1:28:49] amen troubled on every side yet not
[1:28:52] distressed why because we
[1:28:54] are anchored in jesus we trust him we
[1:28:57] can be perplexed but not in despair and
[1:28:59] i'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:29:00] you can be perplexed this age that we
[1:29:04] live in
[1:29:04] is more than enough to perplex a person
[1:29:08] amen hallelujah
[1:29:11] here again don't mean to go into the
[1:29:13] politics but just so you'll all feel
[1:29:14] good about this
[1:29:16] you're going to get a stimulus check
[1:29:17] some of you already got a stimulus check
[1:29:19] you got a how many dollar stimulus
[1:29:21] checked
[1:29:23] fourteen hundred dollars direct
[1:29:26] cost almost six thousand long-term cost
[1:29:30] almost sixteen thousand
[1:29:34] there's no money in the united states
[1:29:36] budget to back it up
[1:29:37] they just printed it right exactly and
[1:29:39] they'll throw you in prison for just
[1:29:41] printing money
[1:29:44] so what we recognize is just printing
[1:29:46] money is a criminal thing
[1:29:49] so we have nothing more saints i hope
[1:29:50] you get this we got
[1:29:52] nothing more than a bunch of criminals
[1:29:54] running our nation
[1:29:57] and we expect a godly result
[1:30:01] remember out of out of proverbs the
[1:30:03] other night
[1:30:04] amen a king that rules in
[1:30:07] unrighteousness
[1:30:12] god judged them see where we're headed
[1:30:16] did the prophet of god not tell us this
[1:30:18] is where we're headed this is a sign of
[1:30:21] our time now don't get all shook up get
[1:30:22] nervous and start building a concrete
[1:30:24] bunker underground somewhere
[1:30:26] my brother and sister it's time the
[1:30:28] scripture says when you see this
[1:30:30] happening
[1:30:31] look up look up the redemption of our
[1:30:34] lord is near
[1:30:35] hallelujah now don't get all caught up
[1:30:38] in that because that
[1:30:39] might be i can show you the quote where
[1:30:42] brother brown says that
[1:30:43] might be 40 50 60 or a hundred
[1:30:48] years 2065's a long ways off
[1:30:56] if we lived that long would we still
[1:30:58] believe
[1:31:01] there's the answer it's not a fight
[1:31:04] about
[1:31:06] what we believe here and what they
[1:31:07] believe there and what this is
[1:31:09] will you amen will you and i still
[1:31:12] believe no matter what we face
[1:31:16] there's the real battle some have
[1:31:18] already given up
[1:31:19] yes some have selected the alternative
[1:31:24] some have watered it down
[1:31:27] some will stand
[1:31:32] verse 11 said for we which live are
[1:31:34] always delivered
[1:31:36] unto death for jesus sake that the life
[1:31:38] also of jesus might be made
[1:31:40] my goodness even the scripture is going
[1:31:44] to force us to face up to this manifest
[1:31:46] thing
[1:31:48] amen might be made manifest in our
[1:31:51] mortal flesh
[1:31:53] now a simple definition of manifest
[1:31:56] is on display so it won't do any good my
[1:32:00] brother and sister to say i believe this
[1:32:02] message
[1:32:03] and i'm speaking that in a broad very
[1:32:04] broad context okay
[1:32:06] it won't do you a bit of good to say i
[1:32:08] believe this message
[1:32:09] and it never come on display
[1:32:13] if we believe this it will it
[1:32:16] must absolute must come
[1:32:19] on display so we can we can fool
[1:32:23] ourselves
[1:32:24] right i'm quite fond of that phrase you
[1:32:27] know it says call no man a fool
[1:32:29] but i i'm quite fond to repeat to you
[1:32:31] that the man who's the biggest fool is
[1:32:33] the fool who fools himself
[1:32:36] you don't have to worry about some of
[1:32:37] these preachers going out here
[1:32:39] and deceiving people they've already
[1:32:41] settled into their rut and you couldn't
[1:32:42] move them if you had dynamite a
[1:32:44] bulldozer
[1:32:46] this is how i see it well that's good
[1:32:49] but what does the word say and how did
[1:32:51] god see it
[1:32:52] amen that's good my brother and sister
[1:32:54] but we have to do it we have to have it
[1:32:56] on display now display is not secret
[1:33:00] hidden as it were
[1:33:01] in the safe at home or under the rug or
[1:33:04] in the back room or a closet or whatever
[1:33:06] but that's out where someone can
[1:33:08] actually recognize
[1:33:10] that this person here and that's the
[1:33:12] only reason i shared that deal about
[1:33:14] what those men are saying
[1:33:15] and that's my heart's desire not to be
[1:33:18] ashamed of what i believe
[1:33:20] but to stand solid that they recognize
[1:33:23] this guy wouldn't buy us a bottle of
[1:33:25] whiskey no matter what we did
[1:33:30] but they just view it as religion see
[1:33:32] they don't come along his
[1:33:33] relationship with jesus christ would not
[1:33:35] let him do this
[1:33:37] it's religion well i'm sorry religions
[1:33:41] are covering
[1:33:43] oh and if you have a problem with that
[1:33:44] just go into your message and
[1:33:47] listen how many times brother branham
[1:33:48] says oh i feel so religious right now
[1:33:53] you know what he's saying i've stepped
[1:33:56] into my theological robe
[1:34:00] and i've got intellectual understanding
[1:34:02] on this side and i've got knowledge on
[1:34:04] this side
[1:34:05] no sir he's saying i feel so religious
[1:34:09] because my covering right now is the
[1:34:12] holy ghost
[1:34:14] it's god right here in our midst right
[1:34:17] here in these
[1:34:18] four walls it's god right here in church
[1:34:20] with us
[1:34:22] and i'm covered i'm surrounded i'm
[1:34:24] wrapped up
[1:34:25] hallelujah he's not talking about how it
[1:34:28] just feels so religious
[1:34:31] come on come on my brother and sister
[1:34:36] well one we'd know that'd be totally out
[1:34:38] of context
[1:34:40] with elijah calling that's right
[1:34:44] we'll talk about continuity here in just
[1:34:46] a few minutes okay
[1:34:48] amen now let's
[1:34:51] let's move right along here in the
[1:34:54] message absolute
[1:34:57] see god separating himself
[1:35:01] god first in a great pillar of fire god
[1:35:03] manifested in a human body
[1:35:06] now god's separating himself among his
[1:35:08] people
[1:35:11] you follow that yes sir that's right
[1:35:14] come on
[1:35:14] yes sir it's right there those three
[1:35:17] lines right there
[1:35:19] contain a whole revelation that a lot of
[1:35:21] people can't get
[1:35:25] god come down then he separated himself
[1:35:28] among his people
[1:35:32] now i hope i'm not speaking to anybody
[1:35:34] in this church or anybody that might
[1:35:35] listen to this
[1:35:36] but if you don't think god's not amongst
[1:35:38] his people
[1:35:40] then you believe contrary to this quote
[1:35:44] because the prophet of god says god
[1:35:46] separated himself
[1:35:48] that means individual portion
[1:35:53] upon his people oh no we just go to
[1:35:57] church and we praise god but
[1:35:59] you know the holy spirit yeah well
[1:36:03] the prophet of god said it's all the
[1:36:05] same thing
[1:36:08] come on let's not just pick our little
[1:36:10] part of the message we want to quote
[1:36:12] say only what the prophet of god said
[1:36:16] come on i'm not picking on nobody i want
[1:36:18] you to catch this you've got to say it
[1:36:19] you've got to take the whole picture
[1:36:21] that's what happened to the bible as
[1:36:23] they started cherry picking the bible
[1:36:26] amen to take what portion satisfied them
[1:36:29] and fit their world and my brother and
[1:36:31] sister that spirit come right over in
[1:36:33] the message
[1:36:34] a prophet of god preached these things
[1:36:36] that god laid upon his heart
[1:36:37] and that spirit that was in denomination
[1:36:39] that caused so many different
[1:36:40] denominations
[1:36:41] come right over in the message and they
[1:36:44] started cherry picking the message
[1:36:46] and it was there and then they hold up
[1:36:49] their portion
[1:36:50] and say say only what the prophet said
[1:36:53] well hello i've got 1200 sermons
[1:36:56] i can tap into and i want to find
[1:36:59] continuity
[1:37:00] from the beginning to the end i want to
[1:37:03] find the mind of god through the whole
[1:37:05] message
[1:37:11] if i can just share another little
[1:37:12] analogy sorry i'm so full of them this
[1:37:14] morning
[1:37:15] but years ago i had a load on
[1:37:18] i was headed to a place in california
[1:37:21] and these guys were just cursing like
[1:37:24] all get out on the
[1:37:25] on the cb at each other and whatever
[1:37:27] else and finally i just chimed in and i
[1:37:29] said you know what
[1:37:30] uh it's just or it's just terrible
[1:37:33] listening to you guys
[1:37:34] sound like a bunch of children and um
[1:37:38] you know i i saw a sign
[1:37:42] it said susanville going to susanville
[1:37:45] california
[1:37:47] susanville i flipped the blinker off and
[1:37:50] i thought i'm done with listening to
[1:37:52] these guys you know and
[1:37:53] that could have just shut the cb off and
[1:37:56] this guy chimed on and he says hey there
[1:37:58] taylor truck
[1:37:59] you don't want to take that route and i
[1:38:02] said
[1:38:03] it gets to susanville it's good enough
[1:38:05] for me
[1:38:09] i remember this spiritually saints
[1:38:12] i got that exit started driving off
[1:38:15] through the forest
[1:38:16] beautiful beautiful country nine percent
[1:38:19] great ahead
[1:38:22] lousy
[1:38:28] then a sign said nine percent grade
[1:38:31] ahead

[1:38:39] nevadas you know you have all these
[1:38:40] little finger mountains coming off and
[1:38:43] i climbed up and went down every
[1:38:46] single one of them i made it to
[1:38:49] susanville
[1:38:52] praise the lord i'm going to make a
[1:38:55] rapture but brother david and i was just
[1:38:56] talking about this in the back room

[1:39:01] come to the lord as a child
[1:39:04] that's it and not drove up them and down
[1:39:06] them and around them
[1:39:08] and through them that i had just
[1:39:10] received the holy ghost
[1:39:12] as a child and said lord i'm going to
[1:39:13] trust you i'm going to walk with you
[1:39:15] but you see i ended up here and i
[1:39:18] believe with all of my heart i'm going
[1:39:19] to end up in a rapture
[1:39:21] hallelujah the road's been a little
[1:39:23] rough and rocky and a little steep and a
[1:39:25] little twisty and a little windy
[1:39:28] later on when i had loaded right in that
[1:39:30] same area a little farther
[1:39:32] down the mountain in the flatlands there
[1:39:34] and i was headed back to idaho i
[1:39:36] took the other road
[1:39:39] do you know the other road just as flat
[1:39:41] as this floor and goes over and you get
[1:39:42] on the freeway
[1:39:45] what took me six hours over here took me
[1:39:48] an hour
[1:39:49] and 30 minutes over here
[1:39:53] come on i hope you catch the spiritual
[1:39:55] and natural of this
[1:39:59] i'm going to make it all right but what
[1:40:00] price do i pay
[1:40:02] i can tell you you know in the trucking
[1:40:04] business brother trevor know this
[1:40:05] brother vasily would know this fuel is a
[1:40:08] huge issue
[1:40:10] i remember i burnt about that much fuel
[1:40:13] getting on the freeway and
[1:40:15] getting from the freeway to susanville i
[1:40:17] burned a half a tank
[1:40:19] one decision cost me hundreds of dollars
[1:40:23] in the natural
[1:40:25] and it costs us in the spiritual
[1:40:28] when we don't listen to the lord
[1:40:32] i'm gonna do it my way i don't care
[1:40:36] what you think i'm going to go there
[1:40:40] children wipe that from your memory
[1:40:45] the pillar of fire breaking up and
[1:40:46] sitting upon each of them like
[1:40:48] forked licks of blazes cloven tongues
[1:40:52] set upon them forks of fire clothing
[1:40:54] tongues
[1:40:54] like fire set upon each of them and they
[1:40:57] were all
[1:40:58] filled with that and began to speak with
[1:41:00] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:41:02] utterance
[1:41:03] now you see we are not a divided people
[1:41:07] now i want to throw this out can we can
[1:41:09] go and search it right now if you would
[1:41:11] want
[1:41:11] but the prophet of god said there's only
[1:41:13] one unity and that's in the word
[1:41:15] of god this might sound a little blunt i
[1:41:18] don't mean it to be
[1:41:19] but nowhere does he say it's unity and
[1:41:21] music it's unity in this it's unity in
[1:41:24] that
[1:41:24] he said it's unity comes by the word of
[1:41:28] god
[1:41:29] now we're not speaking down to nobody
[1:41:31] but i want to just drive that home to
[1:41:32] your church
[1:41:33] that it no matter how much singing we do
[1:41:36] it will not bring a unity
[1:41:38] because a prophet god said that unity
[1:41:40] comes through the word
[1:41:41] amen hallelujah
[1:41:45] amen now you see we're not a divided
[1:41:47] people
[1:41:48] we've got to be in unity because because
[1:41:51] each one of us is holding a part of god
[1:41:56] come on this is not just a holy ghost
[1:41:58] swept through the building and left us
[1:42:00] all high and dry
[1:42:02] i hold you hold a part of god
[1:42:06] he lives in us and then to hear somebody
[1:42:09] say well i you know i don't know
[1:42:11] that god is present
[1:42:16] they're telling you more than they
[1:42:17] realize
[1:42:19] learn one not studying the message not
[1:42:22] reading their bible
[1:42:24] because you can't hold the part of god
[1:42:27] and then declare he's not here
[1:42:30] it's that simple you can't have the
[1:42:33] spirit of god the holy ghost
[1:42:35] and then say he's not here
[1:42:43] and we must come together and then the
[1:42:45] pillar of fire is manifest in the
[1:42:46] wholeness in the fullness of it
[1:42:48] when his church sets together in
[1:42:51] heavenly places
[1:42:53] then the fullness of the power of god is
[1:42:55] in his church each one of us holding
[1:42:57] spiritual gift in spiritual offices
[1:43:00] coming together brings that pillar of
[1:43:02] fire back again
[1:43:04] every little portion young people you
[1:43:06] are not excluded
[1:43:08] every single one of us our portion we
[1:43:11] have to come into unity
[1:43:13] to bring this pillar of fire the
[1:43:15] presence of almighty god
[1:43:16] people say well what's happening around
[1:43:19] our church what's happening around the
[1:43:21] world
[1:43:21] around the united states whatever it
[1:43:22] might be we don't seem to have god
[1:43:25] moving well i'll tell you what my
[1:43:26] brother and sister the basic uni
[1:43:28] unity of the body of christ it starts
[1:43:31] not i'm not talking in the family level
[1:43:34] okay we've moved up
[1:43:35] it starts right in the local church
[1:43:38] and we have no unity in the local church
[1:43:41] god's not going to come in and force his
[1:43:45] way
[1:43:47] he wants to walk into an atmosphere amen
[1:43:51] reminds me of a story about a couple
[1:43:54] quite a few years ago church back east
[1:43:58] a shame around the message people talk
[1:44:00] about divorce and talk about i'm gonna
[1:44:02] leave you and talk about all this kind
[1:44:03] of nonsense
[1:44:04] made a vow before god you made a pledge
[1:44:07] you do that and then you back on it
[1:44:08] you'll back away from any pledge in life
[1:44:11] this couple got to where they couldn't
[1:44:13] even hardly stand each other
[1:44:16] finally the man got over his pride and
[1:44:17] he went to his pastor
[1:44:19] and he said pastor i don't mean to shock
[1:44:23] you or anything but
[1:44:24] me and the wife are just right on the
[1:44:26] verge of divorce
[1:44:29] pastor was like i noticed
[1:44:35] come on saints scripture says whatever
[1:44:39] is done in secret
[1:44:40] will be made open

[1:44:47] we're proud people
[1:44:49] i can't tell you how many times i've
[1:44:50] heard that spoke to me we're a proud
[1:44:52] people
[1:44:52] we'll get over your pride amen it's on
[1:44:55] the stock market it's got like zero
[1:44:57] value
[1:45:00] get a truckload of pride go try and sell
[1:45:02] somebody
[1:45:05] pastor was like yeah so what's the story

[1:49:40] he looked her in the face tears in his
[1:49:42] eyes and said i'm trying to tell you i
[1:49:44] love you
[1:49:48] she broke down and ran in the bedroom
[1:49:50] and locked herself in the bathroom
[1:49:52] and he thought man that was a miserable

[1:51:02] believers amen hallelujah
[1:51:05] amen hallelujah now i'm going to have to
[1:51:08] just skip over a few things here
[1:51:10] amen but i want you to look at this that
[1:51:13] we having verse 13
[1:51:15] we having the same spirit of faith

[1:51:24] quite a few notes on this but
[1:51:26] i'll cut it real short amen every kind
[1:51:29] of believer
[1:51:31] will ultimately end up speaking what
[1:51:33] they believe
[1:51:35] they can't help it the unbeliever cannot
[1:51:40] continue to speak that maybe there's a
[1:51:43] god he will come to a place
[1:51:45] there is no god and if there is i don't
[1:51:47] believe in him anyhow
[1:51:48] the make believer will come to the place
[1:51:50] that what's down in that heart
[1:51:52] will have to speak come on i don't care
[1:51:56] what title they bear
[1:51:58] amen well i don't care what name they
[1:52:00] claim
[1:52:01] ultimately what's in the heart will have
[1:52:03] to speak but i can tell you right now
[1:52:06] very predictive they call it predictive
[1:52:07] language or predictive response
[1:52:09] i can tell you right now what this
[1:52:11] believer's gonna say she's gonna be
[1:52:13] looking back in the word that she's been
[1:52:15] feeding on and she's going to look at
[1:52:16] that and she's going to say i identify
[1:52:18] with that
[1:52:19] that's nothing but the truth amen and as
[1:52:22] she's eating that
[1:52:23] she has to live it right sweet in her
[1:52:25] mouth bitter in her belly she has to
[1:52:27] live it
[1:52:27] but she says it's worth it because
[1:52:29] that's who i am that's what i want to be
[1:52:31] that's my desire i don't want to be
[1:52:33] anything else
[1:52:34] i don't want to be a flirt i don't want
[1:52:36] to be some worldly little whatever
[1:52:38] i want to be the bride of jesus christ
[1:52:41] and i'm going to do it and he doesn't
[1:52:42] have to force me
[1:52:44] but by his grace he's given me time to
[1:52:46] clean my house
[1:52:47] and i've got my house cleaned and i'm
[1:52:49] going to serve him now
[1:52:51] hallelujah that's what this little
[1:52:53] bride's going to do
[1:52:54] because she can't help it amen she's got
[1:52:56] to speak what she believes
[1:52:58] hallelujah oh my i got so many things
[1:53:02] highlighted here
[1:53:03] let me just kind of skip on here just
[1:53:05] wrap this up
[1:53:06] amen and christ is revealed in his own
[1:53:09] word
[1:53:11] incredible sermon if you haven't
[1:53:12] listened to it lately listen to it
[1:53:15] it's just one thing after another is
[1:53:17] just just
[1:53:18] incredible
[1:53:21] i have to admit last night i we're
[1:53:23] getting ready to go to bed and i just
[1:53:25] started reading and i'm like whoa
[1:53:27] jerry's like are you all right man yeah
[1:53:29] i'm all right come read it
[1:53:33] yeah so the bible
[1:53:38] is a complete revelation of jesus christ
[1:53:43] i'll get distracted here if i ain't
[1:53:44] careful
[1:53:46] amen brother branham says
[1:53:50] and i don't have my notes right here i
[1:53:52] can't i don't have one of them
[1:53:55] picture perfect memories pray for god to
[1:53:58] help my memory
[1:54:02] brother brown said
[1:54:06] the seventh seal
[1:54:10] was the new testament
[1:54:14] you want the new testament to be alive
[1:54:15] to you
[1:54:19] nope that seventh seal is closed new
[1:54:21] testament is closed to you
[1:54:26] no it's not seventh seal is open
[1:54:32] because the bible
[1:54:35] is the complete revelation
[1:54:39] of jesus christ and it was wrote by
[1:54:42] prophets hebrews 1
[1:54:43] 1 and god who in sundry times spake to
[1:54:46] the fathers by the prophets
[1:54:48] and this last day speaks to us through
[1:54:50] his son jesus christ
[1:54:52] which was the prophets all of them put
[1:54:54] together
[1:54:55] now look at this i don't know if you're
[1:54:56] familiar with this whether you've
[1:54:58] listened to this for a while
[1:55:00] but look at this which was the prophets
[1:55:02] all of them put together
[1:55:03] jesus was malachi
[1:55:07] so when malachi spoke what was he
[1:55:10] speaking
[1:55:11] jesus was jeremiah isaiah
[1:55:15] elijah all that they were
[1:55:18] were in him so when you go criticize
[1:55:23] those men you're criticizing jesus
[1:55:26] christ
[1:55:28] all that you are all i am is in him
[1:55:31] words witnesses
[1:55:32] of the words so it is not a book of
[1:55:34] systems
[1:55:36] a code of moral ethics neither is it a
[1:55:39] history book or a book of theology
[1:55:42] it is not but it's a revelation
[1:55:46] of jesus christ god himself revealed
[1:55:50] from word to flesh that's what it is
[1:55:53] the bible is the word and god is the
[1:55:56] flesh
[1:55:57] god in god is the word rather jesus
[1:56:00] being the flesh
[1:56:01] it's the revelation how god the word was
[1:56:04] manifested in human flesh and revealed
[1:56:08] to us hallelujah don't you love that
[1:56:12] i just got plum excited studying that
[1:56:15] amen
[1:56:16] hallelujah and that's why he becomes a
[1:56:19] son of god he is a part of god
[1:56:21] you understand now he is not the body is
[1:56:23] part of god so much that it's a son
[1:56:26] a son as a catholic puts it eternal son
[1:56:29] and all the rest of the churches the
[1:56:30] word doesn't even make sense
[1:56:33] see there cannot be eternal and then be
[1:56:36] a son
[1:56:36] because a son is something that's
[1:56:38] begotten from the word eternal
[1:56:40] he cannot be an eternal he can be a son
[1:56:43] but he cannot be an eternal son
[1:56:45] no sir it cannot be an eternal son right
[1:56:49] all right now see you've got to wrap
[1:56:50] your head around this
[1:56:52] otherwise you get confused and say what
[1:56:54] is he saying you see my brother and
[1:56:56] sister this is why the prophet of god
[1:56:58] showed us
[1:56:59] that it wasn't the trinity and it wasn't
[1:57:03] the oneness
[1:57:07] because this was god creating flesh
[1:57:12] and stepping into it
[1:57:19] oh hallelujah that's it amen and all
[1:57:23] that was in christ
[1:57:25] he poured amen
[1:57:28] into the church so he has once again
[1:57:34] flesh and he has
[1:57:38] stepped into it amen
[1:57:42] well hallelujah i can get plum
[1:57:45] excited about that oh my
[1:57:50] amen now he's a son so much the old word
[1:57:52] that was in jeremiah and moses and all
[1:57:54] those words like he said
[1:57:56] they speak of me why because it was him
[1:57:59] in them
[1:58:00] all that true divine revelation of the
[1:58:02] word was wound up in one human body and
[1:58:05] god put
[1:58:06] flesh around it that's the reason he was
[1:58:08] called son reason it refers father
[1:58:10] why it's just as simple if you just let
[1:58:12] god pour it down into your mind
[1:58:14] hallelujah praise the lord yeah see god
[1:58:18] revealed in a body of flesh notice
[1:58:20] revealed from flesh or from word
[1:58:23] unto flesh that's saint john 1 14 and
[1:58:26] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:58:28] us
[1:58:29] now notice this bible some of them said
[1:58:31] oh well it's done this it's done that
[1:58:33] but let me tell you something let's just
[1:58:35] go into the history of the bible just a
[1:58:37] minute
[1:58:38] see where it come from it was written by
[1:58:40] 40
[1:58:41] different writers 40 men wrote the bible
[1:58:44] or the space of 1600 years apart
[1:58:47] and at different times predicting the
[1:58:49] most important events that ever happened
[1:58:51] in the world's history
[1:58:52] and many times hundreds of years before
[1:58:55] it happened
[1:58:56] there's not one error in that entire 66
[1:58:59] books
[1:59:00] oh my no author but god himself could be
[1:59:03] so accurate
[1:59:04] not one word contradicts the other
[1:59:07] remember
[1:59:08] sixteen hundred years apart the bible
[1:59:11] was wrote
[1:59:12] from moses to the death of john at the
[1:59:14] isle or the owl patmos
[1:59:16] sixteen hundred years and was wrote by
[1:59:18] forty different authors
[1:59:20] one didn't even know the other and they
[1:59:22] never had it as
[1:59:24] the word oh see the advantage we've
[1:59:26] gotten this day
[1:59:27] we have the word but they didn't have it
[1:59:30] as the word
[1:59:31] some of them never even seen the word
[1:59:33] but when they wrote it
[1:59:35] and was understood to be prophets then
[1:59:37] when they put their prophecies together
[1:59:39] each one of them
[1:59:40] dovetailed one to the other
[1:59:43] amen now there's a few carpenters a few
[1:59:45] people that understand
[1:59:46] but you see a dovetail my brother and
[1:59:48] sister is actually not something that
[1:59:50] just intermeshes like this
[1:59:51] but a dovetail is actually cut in a
[1:59:54] fashion
[1:59:54] where it's larger on the edge and
[1:59:56] smaller and when they're cut
[1:59:58] perfectly it goes together and it
[2:00:01] can't be pulled apart
[2:00:05] i don't care how many critics
[2:00:09] i don't care how many wise men
[2:00:12] there are you can't pull it
[2:00:16] apart amen
[2:00:20] hallelujah
[2:00:25] reminds me of a statement this guy is on
[2:00:27] youtube he he does construction work
[2:00:30] and he made a comment he says i'll tell
[2:00:32] you what there's nothing like
[2:00:34] an amish built barn
[2:00:37] they're the most incredible barns on the
[2:00:39] face of the earth
[2:00:40] and he said i would build barns like
[2:00:42] that if i could do it in seven days
[2:00:51] that's it come on
[2:00:55] the denominations would build it
[2:00:59] according to the word of god
[2:01:02] if but there's always a qualifier just
[2:01:05] like but
[2:01:09] we would do that if
[2:01:16] if all of our people wouldn't leave
[2:01:22] because they have no desire for holiness
[2:01:25] we would preach holiness if they would
[2:01:27] accept holiness but they won't accept
[2:01:29] holiness so we won't preach holiness
[2:01:32] that's a barn destined to fall down
[2:01:36] that's a house destined to be divided
[2:01:40] amen hallelujah
[2:01:43] now where am i
[2:01:48] i got lost
[2:01:53] john isle dovetail there we are each one
[2:01:56] of them dovetailed one to the other
[2:01:58] look at peter who announced on the day
[2:02:01] of pentecost repent every one of you
[2:02:03] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[2:02:04] for the remission of your sins
[2:02:07] paul are we okay i know this is a long
[2:02:11] read
[2:02:12] it's a long read but i just couldn't
[2:02:13] just stop i just had to
[2:02:16] paul had never heard nothing about it he
[2:02:18] went down to arabia for three years to
[2:02:19] study the old testament
[2:02:21] to see who this pillar of fire was that
[2:02:23] spoke to him on the road saying saul
[2:02:25] why persecute us thou me how could he
[2:02:28] be wrong he never even consulted the
[2:02:31] church at all
[2:02:32] 14 years later when he met peter they
[2:02:34] were preaching
[2:02:36] the same thing
[2:02:40] why that fire
[2:02:44] broke apart settled on each one
[2:02:48] that's why my brother and sister you can
[2:02:50] go to the heart of argentina
[2:02:52] i'll speak of what i'm familiar with
[2:02:55] believers gathered in little ramshackle
[2:02:58] places
[2:03:00] have three or four books is all they
[2:03:03] have access to
[2:03:06] fortunately for them i would say it's
[2:03:07] fortunate to have a church age book
[2:03:09] spanish you can go to the isles
[2:03:13] which is the iceland they call it of
[2:03:15] chile which is the far
[2:03:17] far south i guess is what we would call
[2:03:19] it but it's their equivalent you know
[2:03:20] starts to turn into snow and glaciers
[2:03:22] and whatever
[2:03:23] and you got a few little churches strong
[2:03:26] hardly any fellowship
[2:03:28] it takes a lot of effort to get there
[2:03:31] you can go into the mountains of the
[2:03:32] andes
[2:03:33] you can go into the forests of paraguay
[2:03:37] you can go all these places and you can
[2:03:40] preach
[2:03:42] to the depth and something in your heart
[2:03:43] says i hope these
[2:03:45] people get this
[2:03:48] and they are there with tears running
[2:03:50] down they're just saying thank you lord
[2:03:54] why because of our intellect has
[2:03:58] traveled before us
[2:04:00] no because that little lick of fire
[2:04:04] has went and settled upon them
[2:04:08] and the word can only take you to the
[2:04:11] word
[2:04:13] hallelujah thank you lord that's why we
[2:04:16] don't need some great big organization
[2:04:18] to tell us what tape to listen to or
[2:04:20] what we got to do because we got the
[2:04:22] holy ghost we got the power of almighty
[2:04:25] god coming down
[2:04:26] these licks of fire settling upon the
[2:04:29] people now my brother and sister when it
[2:04:31] went out from that room that day upon
[2:04:33] those people and they were speaking in
[2:04:34] tongues and acting like they were drunk
[2:04:36] it didn't fade the farther they got from
[2:04:40] the upper room
[2:04:42] this is a life that sustains itself and
[2:04:46] sustains everyone who receives it
[2:04:48] so there's no well i got away from here
[2:04:51] i got to it no my brother and sister
[2:04:53] that's why the muslims they got to go
[2:04:54] back to mecca
[2:04:55] because pushing that and doing that is a
[2:04:57] recharge for them well i'm telling you
[2:04:59] this bride of jesus christ will get
[2:05:01] recharged wherever she's
[2:05:03] at on the face of the earth the power of
[2:05:06] god is a sustaining power
[2:05:09] amen it's not a one time experience it's
[2:05:11] a ever
[2:05:12] recharging refilling experience
[2:05:15] hallelujah hallelujah boy sorry i'm
[2:05:17] getting all carried away
[2:05:19] uh 14 years later when he met peter he's
[2:05:21] preaching the same thing
[2:05:22] word by word that's our bible let other
[2:05:25] man's words fail
[2:05:26] this no man can add to it you don't add
[2:05:29] no more to the bible no sir
[2:05:30] this is a complete revelation you think
[2:05:33] brother brown meant that
[2:05:35] here in just a few paragraphs this is
[2:05:37] like the third or fourth time
[2:05:39] complete revelation it's all
[2:05:42] like the seven seals the seven seals
[2:05:44] someone kept saying to me
[2:05:45] now you the lord will speak to you
[2:05:48] brother branham
[2:05:49] when these seals are revealed and will
[2:05:50] tell us how to get closer to god
[2:05:53] and how to do it
[2:05:59] there's somebody it's called an
[2:06:02] intellectual
[2:06:05] amen i won't even say that word it's a
[2:06:07] little bit harsh
[2:06:11] my brother and sister we've all been
[2:06:14] taught
[2:06:16] the preaching of the word teaches us
[2:06:19] but when we have to start getting
[2:06:20] seminars
[2:06:23] and we start having to do line by line
[2:06:25] and
[2:06:26] do this to explain this message so that
[2:06:30] people can receive it
[2:06:32] we've missed it that's right amen we
[2:06:34] will miss it entirely
[2:06:37] because no one went around there and
[2:06:40] said what language will we speak here in
[2:06:42] the upper room
[2:06:45] hallelujah it's like a brother in chile
[2:06:47] once he goes you know brother paul you
[2:06:48] need to learn spanish and you need to
[2:06:50] learn it quick
[2:06:51] and i was like well brother i i can
[2:06:54] barely master english
[2:06:56] he said well i just want to let you know
[2:06:58] spanish is the language that spoke in
[2:07:00] heaven
[2:07:09] he's a nice brother he was just pulling
[2:07:11] my leg
[2:07:13] so thank you lord for something that
[2:07:16] dropped right in my mind
[2:07:17] and i patted him on the back put my arm
[2:07:19] around him and looked him in the face
[2:07:21] and said of course brother you have a
[2:07:22] quote for that
[2:07:27] my brother and sister the holy ghost
[2:07:31] fell africa
[2:07:34] europe asia south america north american
[2:07:38] wherever in between i might have missed
[2:07:40] this same holy ghost it didn't just
[2:07:43] settle in one spot like a muslim would
[2:07:47] be
[2:07:47] you got to come to mecca come to mecca
[2:07:50] and get it
[2:07:51] no no no no no no
[2:07:55] when the seals are revealed and will
[2:07:57] tell us how to get closer to god and
[2:07:59] how to do it am i stepping on anybody
[2:08:00] toes i hope not
[2:08:02] i just believe my brother and sister
[2:08:04] that as a pastor we have to deal with
[2:08:06] spirits where people are like saying
[2:08:07] this is where you got to get it that's
[2:08:09] where you got to get it i'm sorry
[2:08:10] it's not what the prophet of god taught
[2:08:15] i said no sir it can't be because the
[2:08:17] bible the seven seals on it
[2:08:19] had the seven mysteries hid it was
[2:08:21] already wrote
[2:08:22] but they didn't understand
[2:08:26] so it's already there it now takes
[2:08:28] revelation
[2:08:29] to understand it what do we need
[2:08:32] that little lick of fire to settle down
[2:08:36] we don't have to have a upper room
[2:08:37] experience where we all decide what
[2:08:39] language it would be
[2:08:42] because you see now let me not be rude
[2:08:46] but i'm going to vote for english some
[2:08:49] of you are going to vote for french
[2:08:52] some of you are going to vote for
[2:08:54] russian
[2:08:56] or might even be a contest there because
[2:08:59] russian ukrainian it's close but it's a
[2:09:02] word off
[2:09:10] no the prophet of god said our unity
[2:09:14] is in the word when we get in the word
[2:09:20] we will hear god's voice
[2:09:25] amen
[2:09:29] come on i don't want to be offensive
[2:09:30] saints but i just have to follow what
[2:09:32] the lord laid in my heart
[2:09:34] it was already wrote but they didn't
[2:09:36] understand what it was
[2:09:37] see no wonder my brother and sister that
[2:09:39] people struggle with that
[2:09:41] they say i don't see what you see you
[2:09:42] read this scripture and you think it
[2:09:44] means this
[2:09:44] and you say this and you say that and
[2:09:46] the prophet said this and you think is
[2:09:48] it
[2:09:48] and and you're reading between the lines
[2:09:51] i'm doing what my prophet told me to do
[2:09:54] i prayed for revelation
[2:09:56] i looked at that i caught the thought
[2:09:58] that was there
[2:10:00] and god by his mercy come and his holy
[2:10:02] spirit fell on him and said
[2:10:04] this is what it is it's not about just a
[2:10:07] proclamation
[2:10:08] but it's about a life manifested
[2:10:14] come on just go back and read about you
[2:10:16] know the spirit of dillinger and
[2:10:18] beethoven and all of these things
[2:10:19] prophet of god lays it all out there
[2:10:21] just quite beautifully
[2:10:25] see now watch they plowed along with
[2:10:27] that being baptized in jesus name
[2:10:29] see that wasn't it the name of the lord
[2:10:33] jesus christ
[2:10:34] see all those things how it was because
[2:10:35] there's many jesuses or in spanish it'd
[2:10:38] be jesus
[2:10:39] i got several friends here on earth
[2:10:41] named jesus
[2:10:43] minister friends it is in fact it's our
[2:10:46] lord jesus christ
[2:10:47] no author but god could be so correct
[2:10:50] now let's just see how this bible was
[2:10:52] written
[2:10:53] now say for instance am i are we all
[2:10:55] right few more minutes
[2:10:56] amen now say for instance from what if
[2:10:59] we went now and took 66 medical books
[2:11:02] i love this quote took 66 medical books
[2:11:06] that deals with the body wrote by 40
[2:11:08] different medical schools
[2:11:09] and 116 or 16 hundred years apart
[2:11:13] wonder what kind of continuity we'd come
[2:11:16] up with
[2:11:19] uh yeah most of us don't even trust a
[2:11:22] doctor today
[2:11:24] imagine when george washington our
[2:11:26] president about 200 years ago for
[2:11:28] pneumonia they pulled his toenail out
[2:11:29] and bled him apart
[2:11:33] you know we do we wouldn't even stop to
[2:11:36] put our shoe back on
[2:11:37] we'd be out of that doctor's office
[2:11:41] we would be gone
[2:11:46] hallelujah i might have to come back the
[2:11:48] next day and return the door to him
[2:11:50] but we'd be gone let's go a little
[2:11:53] further on some things we're so
[2:11:54] attracted to today
[2:11:55] that's science what if we took 40
[2:11:58] different science from 1600 years apart
[2:12:00] and see what we'd come up with a french
[2:12:02] scientist 300 years ago
[2:12:04] proved by science hmm if it's science it
[2:12:08] can't be wrong
[2:12:10] prove by science by rolling a ball that
[2:12:12] if any terrific speed was a pain
[2:12:14] obtained over 30 miles an hour the
[2:12:16] object would leave the earth and fall
[2:12:18] off
[2:12:20] do you think science would ever refer
[2:12:22] back to that
[2:12:25] is any continuity with that now
[2:12:28] when you drive down the street on the
[2:12:30] road here 150 miles an hour
[2:12:33] i hope you're not
[2:12:37] see but he scientifically proved that by
[2:12:40] the pressure of the ball rolling across
[2:12:42] the ground
[2:12:42] that at 30 miles an hour that any object
[2:12:44] would lift up off the earth and go away
[2:12:46] and fall into space
[2:12:48] fall off into space no there's no
[2:12:50] continuity to that
[2:12:51] but not one word in the bible
[2:12:54] contradicts the other
[2:12:55] not one prophet ever contradicted the
[2:12:58] other
[2:12:59] they was everyone perfect and when one
[2:13:02] come in and did prophesy and that real
[2:13:04] prophet raised up and called him down
[2:13:06] then it was made manifest see so the
[2:13:09] bible
[2:13:11] sister ruth if you'd come
[2:13:15] see so the bible is the word of god
[2:13:19] amen to some believers
[2:13:26] to all
[2:13:32] come on saints the bible
[2:13:35] is the word of god to all
[2:13:38] true
[2:13:43] that's believers you see we get to
[2:13:46] choose
[2:13:49] the prophet of god preach the sermon
[2:13:50] taking sides
[2:14:01] i'm taking sides this morning and just
[2:14:04] as the prophet preached it
[2:14:06] i'm not taking sides with this group i'm
[2:14:08] taking sides with that group i'm not
[2:14:09] taking sides with that group
[2:14:11] or that group over there i'm taking
[2:14:13] sides with jesus
[2:14:15] hallelujah look stand fast in the faith
[2:14:19] young people learn at a young age to
[2:14:22] trust god
[2:14:23] let god prove to you his word is true
[2:14:27] it's not just an old wore out people's
[2:14:30] thing
[2:14:31] you know i just kind of give you a
[2:14:32] little example sometimes how
[2:14:34] speaking direct but have a little love
[2:14:37] in it come this morning and there's this
[2:14:39] pickup parked in the parking lot over
[2:14:41] here
[2:14:42] an old fender changed out of a different
[2:14:44] color and
[2:14:46] i don't know why people would treat
[2:14:47] their vehicles like that but
[2:14:50] i walked over knocked on the door young
[2:14:51] man opens the door and i says is that
[2:14:53] your
[2:14:54] pickup over there and he goes well it's
[2:14:55] one of the people that lives here
[2:14:57] and i said um look i keep asking you
[2:15:00] guys
[2:15:02] i have your vehicles on sunday
[2:15:05] well i i can't control everybody who
[2:15:07] lives in this house
[2:15:11] and me getting older
[2:15:15] and bolder said yes you can
[2:15:20] and you will tell them because you see i
[2:15:23] can put a sign in that parking lot
[2:15:25] and i can tow your vehicles away yeah
[2:15:28] that's right
[2:15:29] but i don't want to i want to be your
[2:15:32] neighbor
[2:15:34] i want to be as it were your friend
[2:15:38] i don't want to be this the part just
[2:15:40] come out of my mouth
[2:15:42] a cranky old man across the street
[2:15:47] i want to be nice to you so you can be
[2:15:51] nice
[2:15:51] to me do you understand
[2:15:57] i understand will it work
[2:16:00] i don't know see god treated us
[2:16:04] like a gentleman all the time
[2:16:07] but sometimes we just ignore him because
[2:16:09] we got a better plan
[2:16:12] pray for our neighbors across the street
[2:16:13] i want to be friends with them
[2:16:15] i want them if anybody asks to say no
[2:16:17] those people over there
[2:16:18] they're nice they let us park
[2:16:21] in their parking lot when they're not
[2:16:23] there
[2:16:25] they don't call the police or the tow
[2:16:27] truck on us
[2:16:29] and compared to the people who used to
[2:16:31] own that church they actually
[2:16:33] show up constantly
[2:16:38] you see our testimony does matter amen
[2:16:43] you look in the mirror are you listening
[2:16:46] to your testimony
[2:16:50] maybe it's time to listen to your own
[2:16:53] testimony
[2:16:55] what am i saying whose side
[2:16:59] am i on amen the prophet of god said
[2:17:03] don't you talk the devil's language
[2:17:05] that's right
[2:17:06] listen to your testimony if it doesn't
[2:17:09] sound
[2:17:10] like a son or daughter of god change
[2:17:13] your testimony

[2:17:16] changed and you can look in that mirror
[2:17:18] and say i
[2:17:19] am a son of god i am a daughter of god
[2:17:22] then start listening to that testimony

[2:18:48] the one that dictated what you got out
[2:18:50] of church today had nothing to do with

[2:19:00] a person in this building today right
[2:19:02] now
[2:19:03] that i didn't pray for last night and i

[2:19:07] middle of the night
[2:19:08] 2 30 2 45 3 45 4 45

[2:19:30] liked what you said there brother david
[2:19:31] i felt it was ordained of god see
[2:19:35] we believe he dwells in here but this is
[2:19:38] his house
[2:19:40] hallelujah i stand

[2:22:37] oh glory glory
[2:22:41] christ is
[2:22:54] [Music]
[2:22:56] hallelujah you know part of what i left
[2:22:58] out this morning just felt to prune that
[2:23:00] back
[2:23:00] my brother and sister the word says that
[2:23:02] we have all these things but we have not
[2:23:04] charity
[2:23:06] you know what charity is you look in the
[2:23:08] dictionary and it'll lay it right in
[2:23:10] there with love almost interchangeable
[2:23:12] but i'll tell you what charity is it's
[2:23:14] love and action
[2:23:16] amen you can say i love you gabrielle is
[2:23:19] like a granddaughter to me she's heard
[2:23:21] me say i love you gabriella many many
[2:23:23] times since she's just a little girl
[2:23:24] hope that'll make some of you nervous
[2:23:26] because she truly and my heart is just
[2:23:28] as though she's my own flesh and blood
[2:23:32] but if i'm not kind to her
[2:23:35] i never say an encouraging word i can
[2:23:38] say i love you
[2:23:39] it becomes meaningless after a while she
[2:23:41] herself would say
[2:23:43] that's just a word he uses but when love
[2:23:46] is projected
[2:23:47] and love has an action come on
[2:23:51] the dictionary will tell you that love
[2:23:52] is when you're hurting and i do
[2:23:54] something for you
[2:23:55] how about we do something when they're
[2:23:57] not hurting
[2:23:59] how about we let them know without it
[2:24:01] being
[2:24:02] just words i'm praying for you
[2:24:05] i care about you i'm lifting you and
[2:24:08] your family up i pray god's blessings
[2:24:10] upon you
[2:24:11] i don't have money to give all of you
[2:24:13] imagine i wouldn't mind maybe being rich
[2:24:14] enough to hand you all some money
[2:24:16] but you know what happened we'd end up
[2:24:18] with just a spoiled church
[2:24:21] just like it is when you hand your
[2:24:22] children money hallelujah
[2:24:24] children you'll forgive me someday but
[2:24:27] if your parents are just handing you
[2:24:29] money i'm asking them
[2:24:31] don't do that any longer make them
[2:24:34] earn it
[2:24:37] [Music]
[2:24:39] is that right caleb he gives me a
[2:24:43] heads up i hope i hope i hope he has to
[2:24:46] earn it
[2:24:47] why because if we get it for free
[2:24:50] we come to expect it and then
[2:24:53] god's just got to do this for me i don't
[2:24:56] have to be obedient to the word
[2:24:58] i don't have to pray i don't have to
[2:24:59] read my bible i have to do nothing god
[2:25:00] should just do this for me
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:03] let's project love
[2:25:06] charity saints love in action love one
[2:25:10] another
[2:25:11] [Music]

[2:29:57] people that reject the word of god
[2:29:59] reject the holy ghost
[2:30:00] reject that walk away eternally lost
[2:30:04] [Music]
[2:30:09] there's one that just broke me down
[2:30:13] prophet of god's talking about our sin
[2:30:17] like that ink and he says you sisters
[2:30:21] know
[2:30:22] that clorox bleach drop our sin
[2:30:27] into that bleach which is the blood of
[2:30:30] jesus christ

[2:30:36] lost oh hallelujah
[2:30:41] thank you lord there's something about
[2:30:44] the eternal loss that i can grab ahold
[2:30:47] of and say
