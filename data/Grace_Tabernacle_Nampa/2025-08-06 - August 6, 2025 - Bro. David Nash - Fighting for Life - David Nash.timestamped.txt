[20:01] just happy in Christ.
[20:05] Happy. Just think of how happy we are.

[20:27] you to stand with me as we go to prayer.
[20:31] Have a couple requests here.
[20:34] I want you to please remember Sister
[20:37] Dorothy Giron. That was my mother's
[20:39] sister. I know many of you, I think,
[20:41] know her or have met her. And she is
[20:45] expected not to live past the weekend.
[20:48] So she is u she's not responsive now and
[20:53] and so we just ask you to pray for the
[20:56] family
[20:58] for the peace that she'll go just in
[21:00] peace and she I know she's ready.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; She loves the Lord and I
[21:07] &gt;&gt; that's the main thing. Amen. Also,
[21:09] brother David like us to remember sister
[21:11] Debbie's wife needs a touch from the
[21:14] Lord tonight. Amen.
[21:17] And then also, brother David requested
[21:19] prayer. Just pray for him. He's had
[21:21] requests to come overseas and he just
[21:23] doesn't know exactly what to do or what
[21:26] to take. And these are trying times. We
[21:29] just wait on the Lord. Isn't it
[21:30] beautiful to wait on the Lord?
[21:33] &gt;&gt; He's always perfect. He's on time.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; To draw nigh to him. He said, "I'll draw
[21:37] nigh to you." Just wait on him. Ask him
[21:40] to reveal himself. Amen. That's what
[21:42] we're expecting tonight. We're expecting
[21:44] God to speak. Also, I would like to say
[21:47] that you know
[21:49] there's a praise report from a little
[21:51] brother here,
[21:53] brother Sammy. He said, "I love Jesus."
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; How many would say, "Amen."
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; I love Jesus, too.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; You know, in the mouth of babes, the
[22:05] scripture said, "God has perfected
[22:07] praise."
[22:09] &gt;&gt; It's simplicity.
[22:10] God hides in simplicity. I want you to
[22:13] know I love Jesus. Just that statement
[22:17] moves my soul.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's not in vain. We smile at
[22:22] that. I believe that come from his
[22:25] heart.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Sammy. Amen. Amen.
[22:30] Let's remember these. Let's bow our
[22:32] heads. Our heavenly father, our precious
[22:36] Lord, our redeemer,
[22:38] our salvation, who's now stepped forth
[22:41] and taken the book.
[22:44] And Lord, without you taking the book,
[22:46] we'd all be lost. You purchased the
[22:48] book, but now you've come to claim your
[22:50] rights in that book. We're thankful that
[22:53] it's an open book, and we can feed on
[22:55] it, Lord. We can eat it. We can take it,
[22:58] Lord, and grow in your stature. That's
[23:00] what we're growing, Lord. We're we're
[23:02] we're growing under the washing of the
[23:05] water by the word.
[23:07] Growing into the stature of Christ. Oh,
[23:10] God. What a blessed What a beautiful
[23:12] message. What a walk with God. What a
[23:15] way for us to to come here, Lord, to
[23:18] meet you. You know our need. We don't we
[23:20] can't hide anything. You know, we need
[23:22] more of you. And we're expecting you to
[23:25] inspire our brother David and speak
[23:26] through him have need of individually
[23:29] and personally and to walk out of here
[23:31] raised to a higher plane. Now Lord, you
[23:34] hear the request that has been made. I
[23:36] pray that you would be with our sister
[23:39] Dorothy's family, her children, as they
[23:42] make decisions as they are seeing and
[23:45] and and and our sister Sue. Lord, also
[23:50] Dorothy's sister, Lord, I pray we pray
[23:52] for them. We pray for comfort. We pray
[23:54] for strength. We pray for understanding.

[23:59] decisions that would please and honor
[24:01] you for her, Lord, and for her body and
[24:04] different things, Lord. We we say,
[24:06] "Well, can you expect her to go?" Yes,
[24:08] Lord, because she wants to go, her
[24:10] desires to go. And how can we go against
[24:13] her will, Lord? We just pray that you
[24:15] would take her. We know it'll be right
[24:16] on time, right on the moment. And we
[24:20] expect that. I pray for Sister Debbie
[24:22] now, our brother David's wife. We send
[24:24] your spirit of healing. You said we'd
[24:27] spend it, send it through a word. We now
[24:29] send it forth. In the name of Jesus
[24:31] Christ, may that power of the enemy has
[24:34] come to attack her, leave her body just
[24:37] now. We as your bride speak these things
[24:39] in your name, having the promise that
[24:42] what we say in your name and ask in your
[24:44] name, we believe we receive it now.
[24:47] Lord, we expect to hear her delivered.
[24:49] And Lord, may David go and find her much
[24:52] comforted and much well. We expect her
[24:54] to hear him say, hear her say, "I feel
[24:59] so much better." Lord, may you grant it.
[25:01] We just believe that now meet brother
[25:04] David's Lord request for prayer. We ask
[25:08] you to direct him. He knows that. He

[25:16] position you've called him to fulfill in
[25:18] the body. Grant, Lord, you have a time
[25:21] and a season, and you're never late. And
[25:23] you've made our way perfect. Now, Lord,

[25:29] every need, Lord, that even beneath the
[25:32] the hand or beneath the heart of these
[25:34] here, you know everything. Lord, we just
[25:38] expect you now to minister to us. Open
[25:42] our hearts to receive it. In thy name,
[25:44] bless your word. In Jesus Christ's name

[36:01] marching as to war
[36:05] with the cross of Jesus
[36:09] going on before. as I have brother David
[36:14] come if he'll come now. Let's sing it
[36:16] again. Uh let's sing the last verse.
[36:20] Onward ye people
[36:24] join our happy throng.
[36:28] Blend with our voices
[36:33] in the triumph song.
[36:37] Glory
[36:39] and honor
[36:41] unto Christ the King.
[36:46] This through countless anges.
[36:50] Then an angel sing
[36:55] with Christian solders
[36:59] marching.
[37:08] You're going on before.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be here tonight?
[37:17] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be here.
[37:19] But I have to confess, I was talking
[37:21] with brother David there before service
[37:23] and I enjoyed the song service and I
[37:25] love that song, Onward Christian
[37:28] Soldiers. I'm surprised how many places
[37:30] I've gone and I want to close with that
[37:33] song and they don't even know it. And
[37:35] yet I'm going, but that's the one that
[37:38] when the bride is walking off the earth,
[37:42] that's supposed to what I'm supposed to
[37:44] be singing. So, God bless you, brother.
[37:47] Thank you. I don't Whoa.
[37:49] But uh yeah, I have to confess I was
[37:53] sitting back there going thinking about
[37:54] two or three different uh messages here
[37:58] and
[38:00] right before he said it, I thought I was
[38:03] looking through some different things
[38:05] and I thought, you know, I need to we
[38:08] need to hear this one about fighting for
[38:10] life.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; And then he says, let's sing this song.
[38:14] It's a battle.
[38:16] So, praise the Lord. It's uh nice to be
[38:20] in one heart and one accord. So, let's
[38:23] just stand. Thank Yes.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; You're hiding. Okay.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; You can't hide your mic.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Where's it got to be?
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; I think I know.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Is that better?
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Does that work? Sounds like it.
[38:39] Thank you. Sure. Go ahead and stand.
[38:40] Thank you, sister. That was I really
[38:43] enjoyed the song service tonight.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; As we uh approach this,
[38:52] I just want to thank the Lord for all
[38:54] the things that he does for us. There
[38:56] are so so much so abundant sometimes. I
[39:00] don't know where to start or end with uh
[39:04] to say say to thank him and to praise
[39:07] him enough for all the problems and
[39:11] things you know this seems to arrive in
[39:13] this world and
[39:16] do you ever get that you know we call it
[39:18] the deer in the headlights look or like
[39:20] what just happened here and uh yet time
[39:25] after time the Lord just brings us
[39:27] through it and so here we are again
[39:29] tonight and thank brother Paul for uh
[39:33] inviting us to speak again this evening.
[39:35] Let's turn to Hebrews the 5th chapter
[39:58] and
[40:00] You know, it seems like some messages
[40:02] that a guy preaches, especially when
[40:04] you're traveling country to country or
[40:06] village to village, you'll wind up
[40:09] uh preaching like on a theme and maybe
[40:12] not the same message time after time.
[40:15] But I remember one trip to Madagascar
[40:17] that we took,
[40:20] every single service was different.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Every single service. And when I got
[40:26] home, I just thought, "Lord, what was
[40:28] that all about?"
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Just didn't even uh I just was preaching
[40:34] what the Lord had us to preach. And uh
[40:38] it wasn't until a short time after that,
[40:40] we were riding in the car and uh put the
[40:43] token tape on. And as we were listening
[40:47] to that tape, it was like each message I
[40:52] didn't realize I had preached the token
[40:54] in its entirety over about 15 messages.
[40:59] And I thought, Lord,
[41:01] &gt;&gt; only
[41:02] God could do that. But he had for those
[41:05] particular people who were new as far as
[41:08] uh thinking about the fullness of the
[41:11] word, for them it would have been
[41:12] perfect because they got it in pieces.
[41:16] So it was broken down. And sometimes I
[41:19] think about people in this day and age
[41:22] and when we uh talk to people
[41:25] or when I talk to people, we're not in
[41:29] an age where you can just dump
[41:30] everything on them.
[41:33] When you think about Ashwitz or Trebinka
[41:36] or those different concentration camps,
[41:38] they were so starved
[41:41] that when the soldiers found them and
[41:43] tried to feed him, they actually killed
[41:45] him.
[41:47] And so they had to close the place back
[41:49] down and bring him back just a little
[41:52] bit at a time. So sometimes when I'm
[41:56] dealing with people,
[41:59] if you can just say, "Praise the Lord."
[42:02] They'll go, "What?"
[42:04] Because nobody said that. I said, you
[42:06] know, in Texas they they all say, "Y'all
[42:09] have a blessed day." Well, I said that
[42:11] to somebody here and their mouth dropped
[42:13] open. They said, "I never heard that in
[42:15] Idaho before."
[42:18] So, be aware of that. And when you meet
[42:21] people on the street, Bible says we're
[42:23] in a famine.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; For hearing the word of God. And there's
[42:28] people out there sometimes just drop in.
[42:30] Well, I'll be praying for you. Or
[42:33] sometimes I mentioned before in a
[42:35] grocery store, I'll say, "Lady, man,
[42:36] that hair, your hair is beautiful. The
[42:38] Bible calls it your glory."
[42:40] &gt;&gt; And I that just that I've seen women go,
[42:44] "Wow, really?"
[42:46] Because that's the gospel being
[42:49] preached. That's the life. And it just
[42:52] it just comes out of me. I can't even
[42:53] help it. Sometimes I'm like, "Why did I
[42:56] say that?" And then I walk away and then
[42:59] you hear like well it's in every
[43:01] Christian that you don't want anybody to
[43:03] go down. So let me read this and then
[43:05] I'll one other thing that's five and
[43:07] we'll start at verse six in Hebrews. as
[43:11] he saith also in another place, thou art
[43:13] a priest forever after the order of
[43:15] Melzdc, who in the days of his flesh,
[43:17] when he had offered up prayers and
[43:19] supplications, with strong crying and
[43:21] tears unto him, that was able to save
[43:24] him from death, and was heard in that he
[43:28] feared. Though he were a son, yet
[43:30] learned he obedience by the things he
[43:33] which he suffered. And being made
[43:36] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[43:38] salvation unto all them that obey him,
[43:41] called of God and high priest after the
[43:44] order of Melzdc.
[43:47] Lord Jesus, um
[43:50] here Lord, as it we would say in
[43:52] yourstead,
[43:54] take this man, take this heart. May
[43:57] everything Lord of the day, of the
[43:59] weeks, whatever, Father, may everything
[44:01] be clean in every heart here tonight as
[44:04] we ask you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[44:08] Please be seated.
[44:10] I this morning we were
[44:14] the these crazy cell phone things that
[44:16] we seem to own. They put some new app or
[44:21] &gt;&gt; update on there. Well, now I get these
[44:23] things I never did before. News flash.
[44:26] News flash. News flash. Well,
[44:31] must be important, right?
[44:33] Right. Well, so this morning, I didn't
[44:37] realize it and I'd spent two hours
[44:40] just reading like, you know, used to be
[44:42] the big newspaper.
[44:45] And I thought it was so strange because
[44:47] even science has now began to say, and
[44:49] they had a map drawn of actually how
[44:51] much of the West Coast they think is
[44:53] going to drop off.
[44:55] And it looked, you know, depending on
[44:56] how you measure, 15,800 square miles
[45:00] roughly. And they've all the science has
[45:03] already drawn the map.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; And you're going, "Huh, isn't that
[45:08] amazing that a prophet told us that in
[45:11] 1962, 63, what whatever year it was when
[45:15] he
[45:15] &gt;&gt; first mentioned that?" 65. I mean, he
[45:18] mentioned it more than once. And so
[45:20] you're going, "Okay."
[45:23] And then I got to thinking back about as
[45:26] with that last earthquake there and just
[45:29] some other scientific facts that kind of
[45:32] amaze me that are gospel related how
[45:35] that that you know they just had the 8.8
[45:37] 8 earthquake in Kamchitka, I believe is
[45:41] how you say it, Russia there or off the
[45:43] coast. And uh I got to thinking back
[45:47] again, the last three big ones they had,
[45:50] one was Japan, one was Chile, and I
[45:53] think one was Alaska,
[45:55] they said actually changed the Earth's
[45:59] axis three degrees.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; And they wonder why there's weather
[46:03] change.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? Exactly right.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; The atmosphere didn't move anywhere. The
[46:08] Earth did.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; And so, of course, there's going to be
[46:12] weather change because when you talk 3
[46:14] degrees on a planet this size, you're
[46:17] talking about a thousand mile movement
[46:19] underneath that air.
[46:22] And so, I'm going, okay, what about this
[46:24] one? How far did it? And we go back
[46:27] again to a message of the hour. He said,
[46:29] for the millennium, that access has to
[46:33] go straight
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; up. Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; H Well, did we move another point or
[46:40] two? He never said it was going to
[46:42] happen all at once,
[46:44] just that it had to become straight.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And I thought then again, as I was
[46:51] reading, because they're talking about,
[46:53] you know, these eruptions and they're
[46:54] worried that Yellowstone's going to blow
[46:56] up.
[46:58] And
[47:00] uh I just kind of off the main subject
[47:03] here. I asked our Jewish guide one time,
[47:06] what would happen if the United States
[47:08] ever turned its back on Israel? And he
[47:11] said, "Oh, we thought already thought of
[47:13] this years ago. We'll just bomb
[47:14] Yellowstone and you'll be covered in
[47:17] ash."
[47:20] I thought, "Oh, okay."
[47:23] But uh with all these other eruptions
[47:26] and this stuff going on, I got to
[47:27] thinking it goes back to, you know, it
[47:29] says in the Bible, as it was in the days
[47:32] of Noah,
[47:33] &gt;&gt; so will it be in the days of the coming
[47:35] of the son of man. We are in the days of
[47:38] the coming of the son of man. In fact,
[47:40] you are part of the son of man.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Son of man is not just a man speaking
[47:46] about the son of man. You know, it's a
[47:50] son of man speaking about the the son of
[47:52] man, but it's also those that receive
[47:54] that word. We are part of that ministry.
[47:58] We are part of the son of man ministry.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Absolutely right.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; They call it the bride of Jesus Christ.
[48:06] We are. And and again, the brother said,
[48:08] I believe it was last or Yeah. about
[48:11] that. It's we're the final voice of the
[48:13] final age. Yes, sir.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; That's part of the son of man ministry.
[48:17] Yes, sir.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; And he said, "As it was in the days of
[48:20] Noah, so would it be in this day that
[48:23] we're living in."
[48:24] &gt;&gt; And we know that it's winding down.
[48:26] We're coming to what we would, I
[48:28] suppose, say the end of the end. But
[48:31] when you think about it and you think
[48:33] about the days of Noah. And so many
[48:36] people I've I've heard them say, "Well,
[48:37] they don't even believe there was a
[48:38] flood." And I took a pilot one time. We
[48:42] were going called on a fire. We were in
[48:44] Arizona and we were talking about it and
[48:47] he said, "Well, I I believe there was a
[48:48] flood and we were kind of talking and I
[48:50] said, "Prove to me there's not." And I I
[48:53] said, "When we start flying from here in
[48:56] Arizona
[48:58] all the way to Washington, the the way
[49:01] that the flood zone or where the it's
[49:04] all the same. It's all the same line all
[49:06] the way. It's absolutely under what we
[49:09] think of as weather conditions
[49:11] impossible unless there was a flood all
[49:15] at the same time.
[49:18] And as we flew and flew because it's
[49:20] about a 4-hour flight in a little
[49:22] airplane, he's going, "You're right.
[49:24] It's the same
[49:26] &gt;&gt; everywhere."
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. And so just to kind of
[49:31] finish this off before we get into the
[49:33] actual message, it says that in the days
[49:36] of Noah, it says the fountains of the
[49:39] deep were opened up.
[49:41] And a lot of people, you know, even
[49:43] brother Brandham said, well, there's
[49:44] there was no rain up there, so they
[49:46] didn't understand it. But what happened
[49:48] was the earth is like we are. We're a
[49:51] three-part person. We have a soul and a
[49:54] spirit in a body.
[49:56] And the spirit is what makes it move.
[49:59] Well, the earth has a core
[50:01] &gt;&gt; and then it had, you know, and then it
[50:03] had as it were the water because the do
[50:07] there was no rain. The earth was watered
[50:10] by the dew of the field because the
[50:13] whole earth's crust sat on a a water
[50:18] core or would have been and what's water
[50:21] represent the spirit. The earth is made
[50:23] the same way that we are.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? Whatever they
[50:27] did, God never destroyed them. They did
[50:31] something that broke that crust and the
[50:34] waters of the deep came went up and came
[50:38] down. And what's happening right here on
[50:40] earth as it was in the days of Noah.
[50:43] They're talking about this crack can
[50:45] open up and that crack can crack can
[50:48] open up and that volcano and this
[50:50] volcano. It's cr that crust is beginning
[50:54] to crumble. Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; And they you and I we've always heard
[50:58] it, you know, said it it'll not be water
[51:00] again cuz God promised that. He said
[51:02] it'll be fire next time.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's what's in the core.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; And it represents what? Well, water
[51:12] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and
[51:15] then receiving the Holy Ghost. And this
[51:18] holy this world has to receive its fiery
[51:22] baptism just like we have to receive the
[51:25] fire. Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Of the Holy Ghost. I thought,
[51:29] &gt;&gt; wow. All this on a little handheld
[51:33] device.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; But you see that scripture over and over
[51:38] and over
[51:41] is coming forth. And if we're attentive
[51:44] to it, you don't have to fear.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; No. because
[51:49] &gt;&gt; we're part of him.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; And he gave us promises. You shall not
[51:53] all die. You shall be changed. You know,
[51:56] and you will, you are transformed from
[51:59] this. And you can go on and on. And I
[52:01] love some of the things Brother David
[52:03] said before and brother Paul about, you
[52:06] know, this is Christ in us is the hope
[52:10] of glory. And so, as I approached this
[52:12] subject tonight, I I just named it
[52:15] fighting for life.
[52:17] Because a lot of times we think of, you
[52:19] know, Jesus our our blessed redeemer and
[52:22] uh all the things that he did at at
[52:25] Calvary, but I think for me a lot of
[52:28] times I never really thought about how
[52:31] hard he had to fight for that.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; How many people here like pain?
[52:38] I know Paul just went with the teeth and
[52:41] I'm getting ready to do one. I don't
[52:44] like pain. It's just not something I
[52:46] was, you know,
[52:49] just not really born to like it, I
[52:51] guess. And and most people don't. But
[52:54] you think about what he went through on
[52:55] that road to Calvary, and not just
[52:58] Calvary, if you've read that book, uh,
[53:00] Prince of the House of David, and it
[53:02] talks about, uh, Jesus sitting on a rock
[53:05] and groaning of a headache.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; And, you know, they said that was an
[53:10] inspired
[53:11] work, an inspired book. And, and I've
[53:14] read it. It's it is it's an inspired
[53:16] book and you think about all the things
[53:18] he went through and so but what was he
[53:22] doing and what was he accomplishing and
[53:25] we just read there that said though he
[53:28] were son yet learned he obedience by the
[53:30] things which he suffered
[53:34] &gt;&gt; friends if you're suffering what are you
[53:37] going through
[53:39] &gt;&gt; in in Colossians I'll read that real
[53:41] quick just since it's just a few pages
[53:43] back
[53:45] as a reminder to people
[53:50] in the second chapter
[53:56] in the first verse. For I would that ye
[53:59] knew what a great conflict I have for
[54:02] you. Now he's sp speaking to Colasso
[54:06] and for them at Leodysia, Lady Osia, and
[54:10] for as many as have not seen my face in
[54:12] the flesh.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; So where's he telling you the conflict
[54:16] is?
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; You're sitting right in the middle of
[54:20] it, friends. That's right.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't fall under the
[54:24] category of being in Leodysia,
[54:27] you sure fall under the category of I
[54:30] never saw the face of Paul.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; And so we are in a conflict and our
[54:37] conflict are it was paid for at Calvary
[54:41] with Jesus Christ because when he said
[54:44] it, it is finished. And you look at the
[54:46] life of Christ and even in the
[54:48] crucifixion, the things that happened to
[54:52] him, he had to fight for those things
[54:56] because it said here that he prayed,
[54:59] you know, that who in the days of his
[55:02] flesh, he offered up prayers and so with
[55:04] strong crying tears to them that was
[55:06] able to save him from death.
[55:09] He knows he is the son of God as we
[55:14] would say. He says it I think in one
[55:16] place in the scripture and but usually
[55:18] he calls himself the son of man. But he
[55:21] knows that God I and the father are one.
[55:24] All the things that he said about that
[55:26] and he knows that God is his father. And
[55:31] if he was of he was the scriptures
[55:35] and very familiar with the scriptures
[55:37] because he used them time after time. He
[55:40] would use the scriptures and he he would
[55:43] make bold statements that some people
[55:45] would just uh kind of throw up their
[55:48] arms and say, "I don't know." When he
[55:50] when he said, you know, except you drink
[55:51] my blood and eat my flesh, and they're
[55:53] going, "Oh, the guy's a cannibal." And
[55:56] all these things that he talked about
[55:59] and what was he doing? He was he was the
[56:04] son of prophecy. Son of man is is a
[56:06] prophet. And so as a prophet, he was
[56:09] prophesying
[56:11] of the battle that he was going through
[56:14] as God in a man.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Because he was half man and half God.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; That's why when when he went to Calvary
[56:24] and when they lifted him up, he died as
[56:27] a man because it said that the spirit of
[56:29] God had left him.
[56:32] And as a man he had to of he was
[56:36] suffering and that suffering what was he
[56:39] depending on? He was depending on the
[56:43] word of God that he had prophesied.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Tear this temple down. In three days
[56:50] I'll raise it up.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:55] Right.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Where do Well, there's nowhere that I've
[56:58] found in the Old Testament where it says
[57:00] that exactly like that.
[57:03] But what was he doing?
[57:05] He was prophesying
[57:08] of what the scripture said about him
[57:12] before it came to pass.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before
[57:17] it comes to pass, we as church of the
[57:21] living God, bride of Christ,
[57:24] find ourselves doing the same thing.
[57:29] We are to speak our own
[57:32] salvation in a way. He He is the author
[57:36] of eternal, we just read it there,
[57:38] eternal salvation to them that obey him.
[57:41] Well, obedience is not always, you know,
[57:45] we've been working on Isaac's porch
[57:47] there, and he's told the little ones,
[57:50] you know, don't bother Grandpa David
[57:53] because, you know, he doesn't want paint
[57:56] all over their clothes. And they're not
[57:59] always, you know, obedience isn't okay.
[58:02] It's no, it's when they actually, okay,
[58:04] scamper now because I don't want you
[58:07] cover. and
[58:09] but it's actually doing
[58:12] the will of the father.
[58:14] But there's a place where they ask Jesus
[58:17] about the will of God or the will of the
[58:19] father and he said it's believing on him
[58:22] whom God has sent
[58:26] believing on him and when we believe on
[58:28] him then we start have to go back and
[58:30] look again at scriptures and he said ask
[58:33] what you will and you can have it.
[58:38] He didn't say ask,
[58:41] you know, in one place he does say ask
[58:43] anything according to my word and you
[58:46] can have it.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; But the asking
[58:50] is on us.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to make it out of
[58:54] this place by the skin of our teeth. You
[58:58] know, I've seen people and they'll, you
[58:59] know, they're at the altar and they're
[59:00] like beating the ground and stuff and
[59:02] I'm going, "Dude, it's already paid for.
[59:05] Just receive it."
[59:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. There was a a girl and I
[59:08] mean we were in a it was in Romania a
[59:11] few years ago and she was just all tore
[59:13] up godly looking sister and and just
[59:17] somehow somebody had put it in her head
[59:19] that she didn't have the Holy Ghost. And
[59:21] I said sister
[59:25] I said if this if I if you were thirsty
[59:29] I said would you ask for this? And she
[59:31] goes yeah and I said well here. And I
[59:33] handed her the she said I said ask. And
[59:36] she said, "Can I have the water?" It was
[59:38] a fresh bottle.
[59:40] And she and she goes, "Oh, wow." And I
[59:43] said, "So what would you what would you
[59:45] say now?" And she goes, "Thank you."
[59:49] Huh?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; How simple is this, friends? If you ask,
[59:56] then what's the next thing you do?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. And when you start
[1:00:02] thanking him, he gets happy because in
[1:00:06] Jonah, it says that the thanksgiving was
[1:00:09] a sacrifice.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Jonah's sacrifice to God was in
[1:00:14] thanksgiving. And when he started thank,
[1:00:16] he was still in terrible condition.
[1:00:18] Weeds around his head in the dark.
[1:00:20] Probably smelled really good right there
[1:00:22] in whale vomit. And
[1:00:25] it's just being honest.
[1:00:27] But when he started thanking God, even
[1:00:30] in that condition, even the whale
[1:00:32] couldn't even deal with it. Get out of
[1:00:34] here.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. I'm not making it up.
[1:00:40] You can go read it. But you see, and so
[1:00:45] with the voice of thanksgiving and in
[1:00:47] other places it says, "Give thanks to
[1:00:48] God in all things." And that's part of
[1:00:52] our battle.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's part of having the right
[1:00:56] attitude towards God. When we begin to
[1:01:00] realize and we can accept the fact I am
[1:01:04] a son of God.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; I might be that that one where Jesus
[1:01:10] says what you did to the least. That
[1:01:12] might be me
[1:01:14] but I know I'm a son of God.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; And
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] And with that in mind, then I have a
[1:01:23] responsibility.
[1:01:25] Jesus ministered to people. I'm not
[1:01:29] talking about just being up here behind
[1:01:31] the pulpit. He ministered, as we would
[1:01:34] say, 24/7.
[1:01:36] It didn't matter where he was or when it
[1:01:40] was or what he was. He was always
[1:01:43] pouring his life out for someone else.
[1:01:46] And in so doing, what was he doing? He
[1:01:49] was fighting to see the life of God
[1:01:54] come forth on earth again. We spoke not
[1:01:57] too long back a couple times on uh might
[1:02:00] have even done it here on where have you
[1:02:03] laid him and talking about Lazarus and
[1:02:05] how Lazarus means the you know the
[1:02:08] mighty one the the the mighty God of
[1:02:11] Israel and has these other things
[1:02:12] attached to his name. And so what was
[1:02:15] Jesus doing when he called Lazarus
[1:02:18] forth?
[1:02:20] Was it just the man? Well, the man was
[1:02:22] there. It was his friend. Isn't it
[1:02:25] interesting? He was friends with the
[1:02:27] mighty power of God.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; But when he calls him forth, what was he
[1:02:33] doing? Well, you say, "Well, there was a
[1:02:35] resurrection."
[1:02:37] Of course, there was a resurrection.
[1:02:39] But what was it? He was fighting to see
[1:02:43] the mighty God of Israel
[1:02:46] brought forth again upon that planet and
[1:02:50] to the on this planet and to those
[1:02:52] people. He was fighting to see the life
[1:02:56] of God manifest to those people and to
[1:03:00] those that were ordained to see it. It
[1:03:02] was a tremendous miracle.
[1:03:05] But it was right after that the scribes
[1:03:06] and Pharisees said, "We got to get rid
[1:03:08] of this guy."
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Because they didn't have that ability to
[1:03:14] receive. That's right.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; They were filling their part of the
[1:03:18] scripture that says your eyes have eyes
[1:03:20] to see, you don't see.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Ears to hear, you don't hear.
[1:03:25] They were fulfilling their part because
[1:03:28] they had to fulfill the part that when
[1:03:30] he gets ready ready to go to Calvary.
[1:03:34] And here it is. It says that he prayed
[1:03:38] to be delivered from death.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; And yet when he gets to the end of that
[1:03:43] prayer,
[1:03:44] he says, "Father, thy will be done."
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. But you go back to
[1:03:52] John, I think it's the 17th chapter.
[1:03:53] Let's read that really quick cuz it's
[1:03:55] got such power to it.
[1:04:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:06] In 17 and verse 24, well, I'll start at
[1:04:10] 23. In I in them, thou in me, that they
[1:04:14] may be perfect in one.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; A lot of people say, "Well, I'm not
[1:04:18] perfect." Well,
[1:04:22] sorry.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Sorry that you're not.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Because God just said I am.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's this whole purp. But his
[1:04:31] whole purpose is so that we can receive
[1:04:33] perfection, which is completion.
[1:04:36] And and he said, "And that the world may
[1:04:40] know." So it's a two-part thing that you
[1:04:42] sent me.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So the world is going to know
[1:04:47] that
[1:04:50] God sent him
[1:04:52] by our receiving perfection.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Is that what it says?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; That they may be made perfect in one
[1:05:03] which is oneship with him or with
[1:05:05] Christ. And the world may know that thou
[1:05:08] has sent me and hast loved them.
[1:05:12] They will understand as we come into
[1:05:16] perfection
[1:05:18] that God was sent into the world
[1:05:23] because he loved us.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; And
[1:05:28] thou loved me.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; So God so loved the world, he gave his
[1:05:35] only begotten son. You've heard that is
[1:05:38] even at the football games
[1:05:41] that whosoever believeth him should have
[1:05:43] eternal life. And so here it is
[1:05:48] that as we receive the word of God, as
[1:05:53] we fight our fights and our battles,
[1:05:57] as he fought his fights and his battles,
[1:06:00] because he's getting ready to go through
[1:06:01] the biggest battle of his life just
[1:06:04] right after this
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; because the next chapter, if you if you
[1:06:08] read to the end of this chapter, which
[1:06:10] is only a few more verses, it says
[1:06:11] betrayal in the garden.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Right? So this is right before the
[1:06:17] crucifixion.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; And he's saying when they receive their
[1:06:22] perfection, the world is going to know
[1:06:24] that you sent the knew. God sent me
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; because you loved them.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; He was sent because he loved you and I.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; It was his love that constrained him to
[1:06:39] go through those next couple of chapters
[1:06:41] as we would think of it. Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; It was the love of God.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; And it was because God loved me, he
[1:06:49] says, or him as we would think of it.
[1:06:53] Well,
[1:06:55] of course, God loved him. It was his
[1:06:57] son. But let's read the next verse.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Father, I will
[1:07:05] I will that they also whom thou hast
[1:07:08] given me be with me where I am.
[1:07:13] And there's those two dots time frame.
[1:07:16] He said, "I will
[1:07:20] that they that's us
[1:07:23] be with him that where he is
[1:07:29] thou but be with where I am that we'll
[1:07:33] be with him." That is the will of God.
[1:07:38] That was love divine
[1:07:42] sent from God because we had no way
[1:07:46] back.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is about to give his life for
[1:07:52] our lives. And he said, "I will." And
[1:07:55] there's a whole list of in that word
[1:07:57] will
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; of definitions
[1:08:02] that it's the extreme desire, passion,
[1:08:06] love. I mean there's all these things
[1:08:08] are combined into that word. And when he
[1:08:11] said I will.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; This is a man speaking
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; half man and half God. Because this part
[1:08:21] is the man speaking to as he says the
[1:08:23] father
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; and he's saying I will.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; He is willing. It's his will.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Perhaps you remember, I think it's
[1:08:35] in Galatians 3 where it talks about the
[1:08:37] a covenant and he said, "Though it be a
[1:08:40] man's covenant."
[1:08:45] He said, "Who?" You can't disallow it
[1:08:49] because God gave mankind the same
[1:08:53] ability that he had.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's big words.
[1:09:00] But we have received through speech,
[1:09:05] we would call it the third pole,
[1:09:08] the ability to create.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; That we might as he did. All right, I
[1:09:16] better get going.
[1:09:18] So what was he fighting about?
[1:09:21] He told him three days, you know, lay
[1:09:23] this body down. Three days, I'll raise
[1:09:24] it up. Well, then you think that was
[1:09:28] going through his mind when when they're
[1:09:31] hitting him with a whip and and he goes
[1:09:34] before Pilate and Pilot said, "I have
[1:09:36] the power to let you go." And he says,
[1:09:37] "You got no power at all."
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Because he had he had the power of God
[1:09:43] in him. And we sing that song, you know,
[1:09:46] he could have called 10,000 angels.
[1:09:48] Well, not really
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; because he was constrained by will
[1:09:53] because it was his will
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; that we
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; be redeemed
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; that we could show his life and his
[1:10:03] coming
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; by our perfection. And how do we gain
[1:10:08] perfection is by the gospel of Jesus
[1:10:11] Christ.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; I will. And the reason was he wants us
[1:10:18] to be with him.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; And I run into people, do you think I
[1:10:22] can make the rapture or you know,
[1:10:24] they're all shook up about it. Friends,
[1:10:28] why did he do this? And he said, because
[1:10:30] I love
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Because God loved me. I love you,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; and I'm coming after you. So that where
[1:10:37] I am, talk about a
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; A bride situation.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:44] It's I want her that church of the
[1:10:47] living God. I want her with me.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Wherever I am, I want her there.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; My help me, my everything. And so he
[1:10:58] goes through these things.
[1:11:01] And just a couple of the things he he
[1:11:03] had to fight for. He knows they're
[1:11:06] killing him. He when they they put him
[1:11:09] on Calvary, they condemn him to death.
[1:11:11] All those things. and how he had to
[1:11:14] fight for when he was on Calvary. He had
[1:11:18] to fight for
[1:11:20] thou wilt not leave my soul in hell nor
[1:11:24] suffer my holy one to see corruption. He
[1:11:27] was in terrible shape.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; But he had to take a hold of that
[1:11:32] scripture because he knew he was dying.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he was taking hold of a
[1:11:39] promise before the promise was manifest.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; That's the one that we
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; obey. That's we obey as he did. He was
[1:11:54] also fighting for these first three are
[1:11:57] out of Psalms 16:10 49:15.
[1:12:00] Redeem thou shalt redeem me from the
[1:12:03] power of the grave. what
[1:12:07] he was fighting for that he was a man
[1:12:11] and he was going through those things
[1:12:16] beating and the crown of thorns and the
[1:12:19] you know the nails and all the things
[1:12:21] that he was going through and here he is
[1:12:25] standing there believing
[1:12:29] he'd even prophesied it three days I'm
[1:12:31] coming up and he so he prophesied it
[1:12:34] because he believed, "Thou wilt redeem
[1:12:37] me from the power of the grave." Yet,
[1:12:39] he's going into the grave.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:12:44] Think about that.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; So, what was he looking towards? Well,
[1:12:52] I will be delivered from the lowest
[1:12:54] hell. Psalms 86:13.
[1:12:57] He's not only going into the grave, he
[1:13:01] is going to go to hell and be delivered
[1:13:05] from hell. And what's the only thing
[1:13:07] he's hanging on to
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; was these are the prophecies that
[1:13:11] concerned him.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; This is he is the word
[1:13:17] and he is fulfilling his part of the raw
[1:13:20] the
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; amen the word.
[1:13:25] It repeats in the book of Acts, I will
[1:13:27] not leave my soul in hell. And uh
[1:13:32] we could go on and on. In second Peter,
[1:13:34] it says, let me read that one. U
[1:13:46] Okay, I think I know what it is.
[1:13:51] Second Peter 1 and 19.
[1:13:57] We all we have also a more sure word of
[1:14:00] prophecy where unto ye do well that ye
[1:14:04] take heed as unto a light that shineth
[1:14:06] in a dark place until the day dawn and
[1:14:08] the day star arise in your hearts.
[1:14:11] It's a word of prophecy.
[1:14:14] This thing we call salvation is a
[1:14:17] prophecy according to the will of God.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And we have to fight for it
[1:14:25] when the enemy comes and he dumps things
[1:14:28] on us. And there's another one there in
[1:14:32] Peter 2 Peter 1:10 to drop back up.
[1:14:36] We say, "Oh, how can I get in? How do I
[1:14:38] know I'm going to make the rapture?
[1:14:40] Wherefore the rather, brethren, give
[1:14:42] diligence to make your calling and
[1:14:44] election sure. If you do these things,
[1:14:46] you That's the wrong scripture because
[1:14:48] the one I'm thinking about, it says
[1:14:49] there was an entrance. Oh, it's the next
[1:14:51] one. For so an entrance shall be
[1:14:53] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:14:57] everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus
[1:14:59] Christ. How do you get there? How do
[1:15:03] what's our entrance point? It comes
[1:15:06] through a ministering
[1:15:08] to us.
[1:15:11] a ministry. Our entrance is through his
[1:15:14] ministered to us
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; into the everlasting kingdom of God.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why are you preaching tonight,
[1:15:21] David? This is kind of different." Yeah,
[1:15:24] it's different. All right. And some
[1:15:27] people,
[1:15:29] we have expectations.
[1:15:32] And if it's certain a sermon or
[1:15:34] whatever, a brother doesn't preach a
[1:15:36] certain way, then we think, well, what
[1:15:38] what went wrong? You know, what happened
[1:15:40] here and why didn't I? And you know, we
[1:15:43] go through those things. But you have to
[1:15:45] remember if he's anointed of the Holy
[1:15:48] Ghost, the same power of creation
[1:15:52] is in the same word if I say praise the
[1:15:55] Lord as it in is if I said I'm going to
[1:15:58] preach the hide off your back.
[1:16:01] It all has the power of creation in it.
[1:16:05] And as Jesus Christ prophesied
[1:16:08] those things, I'll not leave my soul in
[1:16:11] hell in the different, you know, three
[1:16:14] days I'll raise up and all those things
[1:16:16] that he prophesied of. He was creating
[1:16:20] the atmosphere
[1:16:22] to become it.
[1:16:28] He took on death so that he could take
[1:16:31] on the atmosphere
[1:16:34] of being redeemed from the power of the
[1:16:37] grave.
[1:16:39] He went to hell and preached to the
[1:16:41] souls in prison so that he could prove
[1:16:44] that he was delivered from the lowest
[1:16:47] hell. He had to fight for these things.
[1:16:50] As he was dying, he had to believe he
[1:16:54] was coming up in three days cuz you'll
[1:16:56] not leave my soul in hell nor suffer my
[1:16:58] holy one to see corruption.
[1:17:00] He was fighting for life
[1:17:05] and he was creating as he would speak
[1:17:08] certain things and as he would do
[1:17:10] certain things, he's creating the
[1:17:13] atmosphere.
[1:17:16] Now,
[1:17:18] where are we supposed to meet our Lord?
[1:17:23] No takers.
[1:17:26] Bible says in the air.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Did not we hear a message of the hour
[1:17:32] that said throw the television away,
[1:17:34] throw this away, the dirty books, all
[1:17:36] that kind of stuff
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; because you will create an atmosphere
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; to live in.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:17:45] Didn't he say pray without ceasing?
[1:17:47] Bible tells us that. Didn't he say
[1:17:50] testify?
[1:17:52] And all the things that he spoke
[1:17:54] concerning us because we have a
[1:17:57] ministry. We have a per perfect ministry
[1:18:02] to show people he did come.
[1:18:06] He not only came, he came because he
[1:18:08] loved me. We sing that song. I love him
[1:18:11] because he first loved me.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] And as we do these things,
[1:18:18] we begin to create the atmosphere.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; The air. I I've challenged people. I
[1:18:25] even, you know, a few years years back,
[1:18:28] I remember Shayer, show me some air,
[1:18:30] man.
[1:18:32] Can you show me some? This is where
[1:18:34] you're going to meet him.
[1:18:39] Think about what the scripture said.
[1:18:42] What good is a planet? You know, we
[1:18:43] we've heard the quote a Holy Ghost
[1:18:46] Christian could has enough power in to
[1:18:48] go speak a world into existence and go
[1:18:50] live there. How you going to live there
[1:18:52] without an atmosphere?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And as we speak and as we relay back to
[1:19:02] him, we are speaking I would say I just
[1:19:05] have this written down a parallel life.
[1:19:09] This is an earthly life that we're
[1:19:12] living in an earthly kingdom. And as it
[1:19:16] was in the days of Noah, and this thing
[1:19:19] is about to blow up and crack apart, and
[1:19:22] what was underneath is going to come up
[1:19:25] and back down
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; so that it bathes this world in fire
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; and renovates it.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:19:36] exactly.
[1:19:37] We are creating the atmosphere in which
[1:19:41] God says I like sir
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; we are creating the atmosphere of Jesus
[1:19:48] Christ living and speaking through his
[1:19:51] bride
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; that's our battle friends
[1:19:58] getting ready to close I think about and
[1:20:01] I know you've probably most of all of
[1:20:03] you here have heard of it about sister
[1:20:05] Hattie Wright
[1:20:07] and how that I had a brother call
[1:20:09] recently and he was all concerned about
[1:20:12] it because uh
[1:20:16] when brother Brandham told her the story
[1:20:18] about the spoken word with the squirrels
[1:20:20] and the different things and the woman
[1:20:23] uh brother Kenny Caps I don't suppose
[1:20:26] too many of you know him but he knows
[1:20:28] the woman personally and knows where she
[1:20:31] lives he's been to her house and all
[1:20:32] that and uh he said it's a humble house.
[1:20:37] I mean, it's just just a little old
[1:20:39] house. And here was a prophet of God
[1:20:42] speaking to her. And all she said
[1:20:46] was, "That's exactly right."
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; But when she said that,
[1:20:54] the Holy Spirit said, "Tell her
[1:20:58] whatever she asks for, she can have it."
[1:21:04] He didn't say you speak it, prophet.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Tell her what she says."
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; And she when he tells her this, she
[1:21:16] goes, "What should I ask for?" And he
[1:21:17] said, "Well, your sister's sick. Prayed
[1:21:19] for her a lot of times. You could have a
[1:21:21] million dollars." But she spoke from her
[1:21:24] heart and we read that in Hebrews that
[1:21:26] he becomes the author of eternal
[1:21:28] salvation. And she turns and said, "I
[1:21:31] want the salvation of my boys."
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And he had just told her, "Whatever you
[1:21:37] ask for, it can fall in your lap." And
[1:21:40] they fell in her lap and surrendered
[1:21:42] their lives to Christ.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; But who asked?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; She did. Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; So as we think of other things from what
[1:21:54] we call the message of the hour, how
[1:21:57] that the representation there was the
[1:21:59] Holy Ghost speaking through a man and
[1:22:02] the woman always represents what?
[1:22:06] The church,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; right? In the Bible, most places where
[1:22:11] you find it talking about woman, if you
[1:22:13] dig, you'll find out it's speaking about
[1:22:16] a church, whether it's the bad church in
[1:22:19] in the book of Revelation some places or
[1:22:21] the good church, the the the
[1:22:24] church world, or it can be the bride of
[1:22:27] Jesus Christ. So, what happened when God
[1:22:30] said, "Tell her to say it." The
[1:22:33] anointing moved
[1:22:37] from
[1:22:39] a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:22:42] into a son of man revealing
[1:22:46] who she was
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; because she spoke under the power of
[1:22:51] creation and received what she asked
[1:22:54] for.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Fighting for life. Friends, we are
[1:23:00] fighting for life. We are fighting this
[1:23:04] battle to no matter how much the enemy
[1:23:08] or a enemy I don't even like to talk
[1:23:10] about him. He's not worth talking about.
[1:23:14] But no matter what trials or what
[1:23:16] struggles come, it doesn't matter. God
[1:23:20] said, "Let us make man in our image."
[1:23:22] And you look at it, it was male and
[1:23:23] female created he them. So what's the
[1:23:26] image of God? That's it.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; It's God
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; and you and I.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; That's God's image.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; We are the fulfillment or the
[1:23:40] perfection.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Of God.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; In mankind.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; The completion.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. How many people have you
[1:23:52] talked to and you know they said, "Wow,
[1:23:55] I was never complete until I got my
[1:23:57] wife." I've talked to brothers, they
[1:23:58] said, "I feel so complete."
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; What about Christ?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's right.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; That is what we are becoming.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Is the perfection
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; and the completion of Jesus Christ
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; in bride form.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And how do we do that? by creating an
[1:24:22] atmosphere.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; By creating an atmosphere in which he's
[1:24:28] comfortable.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He's not comfortable with all the rock
[1:24:33] and roll and all the stuff and all the
[1:24:35] crazies and the nakedness and we could
[1:24:37] go, you know, into that that direction,
[1:24:40] but that he's not comfortable there. He
[1:24:43] goes there seeking the lost. He said,
[1:24:45] "Reach into the fire and yank them out."
[1:24:48] But that's not where he's comfortable.
[1:24:52] A man is comfortable when he's in his
[1:24:54] own house.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's right.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; And when they And when the atmosphere is
[1:25:01] such that he can relax and go, "H,
[1:25:05] wow."
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Where are we supposed to meet him?
[1:25:12] Everybody's looking for a rapture. I I
[1:25:15] believe Jonathan, my son, called about a
[1:25:17] year ago and we were talking about it.
[1:25:19] He said, "Actually, that word we know
[1:25:21] it's not in the Bible, but the
[1:25:24] definition of it means extreme joy."
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; You mean if we could create an
[1:25:33] atmosphere of extreme joy,
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; we might could just leave this place?
[1:25:44] kind of looks like it to me.
[1:25:48] So, what are we trying to do? This
[1:25:51] battle that we are fighting
[1:25:54] is for life.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Who's life?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And the life.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I'm the light of men. And we could go on
[1:26:04] and on. You know, all those
[1:26:06] identifications. And as we become,
[1:26:10] she is him.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; That's him. Always get your ABCs. Always
[1:26:15] believe Christ.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And as we take whatever comes our way
[1:26:23] and we deal with it like he did through
[1:26:26] prophecy. I don't care what it looks
[1:26:28] like.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; It's not looking too good today. You
[1:26:32] know that this broke down or that
[1:26:34] happened or whatever it might be. It
[1:26:36] doesn't look good. But you know what?
[1:26:38] Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Somehow
[1:26:42] some way
[1:26:44] this is going to make me a better
[1:26:45] person.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Or the other thing you you know we were
[1:26:50] coming home uh we were going back to
[1:26:53] Louisiana there and I'd been in Central
[1:26:55] America I believe it was and you know it
[1:26:59] was a long flight coming out of Panama
[1:27:02] into I believe it was Denver and then
[1:27:04] Denver to shriveep and whatever. Well
[1:27:06] somewhere along the way there's a storm.
[1:27:10] I think we were stuck in Dallas. I
[1:27:11] believe it was.
[1:27:14] I just wanted to get home.
[1:27:17] I just said, "Come on, man. What do you
[1:27:19] mean there's going to be an hour delay?"
[1:27:20] And then it was a 2hour delay and then
[1:27:22] it was a three-hour delay and but I'm
[1:27:26] sitting there and all these people are
[1:27:28] grumbling and complaining about how
[1:27:30] terrible it is and they're going to miss
[1:27:31] their appointments.
[1:27:33] Finally, somebody said something. He
[1:27:34] says, you know, I don't I don't mean to
[1:27:37] uh break your bubble, but do you think
[1:27:39] that pilot wanted to make 125 people
[1:27:42] unhappy?
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; He is doing that for our safety.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And then as I was telling them, actually
[1:27:51] rebuking them because there's kind of a
[1:27:52] crowd of people. I said, "People, he did
[1:27:55] that because he cares about your lives."
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And they were like, "Whoa, never thought
[1:28:02] of that.
[1:28:04] You want to take you want to take off in
[1:28:06] a broken airplane?
[1:28:08] I don't. Just me.
[1:28:12] And but then while we were sitting
[1:28:15] there, this one girl came in and sat
[1:28:17] down next to me. You know how they are
[1:28:19] in the airports. And I said, "Hi, how
[1:28:22] are you doing?" And you know, we start
[1:28:24] talking. Wound up testifying to her for
[1:28:26] almost an hour. She was a backsliden
[1:28:29] Christian
[1:28:30] and the tears are coming down her cheeks
[1:28:33] and by the time they they're they're
[1:28:35] getting ready to call us to go on board
[1:28:36] and she's saying, "I needed this." She
[1:28:40] goes, "I am so glad."
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; That you're here tonight.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; And she goes, "I know what this delay
[1:28:47] was all about."
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Well, then I go over and so we start to
[1:28:50] get on the airplane. They said, "No,
[1:28:52] it's not ready." So then you had to go
[1:28:53] back out and this time a girl from Korea
[1:28:57] sat down a Christian girl and she
[1:29:00] started ask oh she said you know I don't
[1:29:03] remember how the conversation started I
[1:29:05] started telling her about Christ and and
[1:29:07] in her particular case I she asked a
[1:29:10] question I said well it's like King
[1:29:11] David I said he was God showing through
[1:29:15] David himself as king and she goes what
[1:29:19] I never heard anything like that
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; where did I get that out of the book?
[1:29:24] Out of the message. And so for 30
[1:29:28] minutes or better
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; and she goes, "Wow, now I know why this
[1:29:33] had to happen."
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the truth.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; So whatever your trial or your struggle
[1:29:40] is,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; you know, by with the time it was done,
[1:29:43] the three of us were thanking God.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. We had a little sermon
[1:29:47] here in the in the airport. Y'all,
[1:29:49] anybody else want you,
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; But because it's for our benefit
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; or if it's not for our benefit, it's for
[1:29:58] the benefit of the bride of Christ.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And the same power of creation that came
[1:30:04] through Jesus Christ has been now laid
[1:30:06] upon us. And you can pray for somebody
[1:30:09] and they could receive eternal life
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; because he's the author. We're the ones
[1:30:15] reading the book.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. and relating what's in the book
[1:30:18] back to the audience. Let's stand.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; We'll have to try part two a different
[1:30:30] time.
[1:30:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:37] What a friend we have in Jesus. Do you
[1:30:39] know that? I'm sure you do, right?
[1:30:47] You don't know that one. Oh, let me
[1:30:49] think.
[1:30:53] What a friend we have in Jesus.
[1:30:59] All our sins and griefs to bear.
[1:31:06] What a privilege to carry.
[1:31:13] everything
[1:31:14] to God in prayer.
[1:31:19] Oh, what peace we often forfeit.
[1:31:26] Oh, what needless pain we bear.
[1:31:33] All because we do not carrying
[1:31:40] everything to God in prayer.
[1:31:46] Have we trials and temptations?
[1:31:53] Is there trouble anywhere?
[1:32:00] We should never be discouraged.
[1:32:06] Take it to the Lord in prayer. What is
[1:32:10] this about, Lord? Hallelujah.
[1:32:13] Can we find a friend so faithful?
[1:32:20] Who will all our sorrows share?
[1:32:27] Jesus
[1:32:29] knows our every weakness.
[1:32:34] Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[1:32:41] Are we weak and heavy ladened?
[1:32:48] Come
[1:32:50] with a load of care.
[1:32:55] Preious
[1:32:56] Savior still our reuge.
[1:33:02] Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[1:33:09] To thy friends despise, forsake
[1:33:13] thee.
[1:33:15] Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[1:33:22] In his arms he'll take and shield
[1:33:27] thee.
[1:33:29] Thou wil find a soulless there.
[1:33:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you. Thank you for
[1:33:39] coming out tonight. As our brother said,
[1:33:44] wherever two or three are gathered,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; he's here.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. You
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; say, "Well, I don't really feel
[1:33:49] anything." You don't have to.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Because the creative power of God is
[1:33:55] here. And
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; uh there's one other scripture uh I
[1:34:01] think it's in this
[1:34:05] that I've been looking at a lot. It says
[1:34:07] a divine sentence
[1:34:09] is in the lips of a king out of
[1:34:11] Proverbs. A divine sentence.
[1:34:15] When we think about a sentence, you
[1:34:16] know, usually think about somebody going
[1:34:18] to prison or paying a ticket. But you
[1:34:20] know, there's also the sentence that
[1:34:22] says, "You never did it in the first
[1:34:24] place."
[1:34:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And you're free to leave the courtroom.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Free to leave the courtroom. Get out of
[1:34:35] there. Don't stick around because I did
[1:34:37] once and it cost me $200.
[1:34:41] So, God bless you.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Create that atmosphere.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; That's where we live and that's where we
[1:34:49] meet him.
[1:34:50] And the rapture as we call it rapture is
[1:34:53] a revelation.
[1:34:57] And he said it's the same as divine
[1:34:58] healing. What about divine healing? You
[1:35:01] say, "Well, I'm sick." Get prayed for.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Believers lay hands on the sick. And
[1:35:06] then what are you supposed to do?
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; And walk out of there thanking God,
[1:35:13] saying, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. He said, "If you're
[1:35:17] still sick, doesn't matter.
[1:35:20] Because the creative power, if it took
[1:35:23] however many thousands, millions,
[1:35:25] whatever you want to believe as far as
[1:35:26] the creation to bring this earth forth,
[1:35:30] don't you think God takes a couple
[1:35:32] weeks, it's going to be a big deal?
[1:35:35] Amen.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's sing that first
[1:35:38] verse once more. And brother Paul or
[1:35:40] brother David, whoever's coming up,
[1:35:43] what a friend we have. Thank you. God
[1:35:46] bless you, Jesus.
[1:35:49] All our sins and griefs to bear.
[1:35:58] To carry
[1:36:02] everything
[1:36:04] to God in prayer.
[1:36:08] Oh, what peace we often for.
[1:36:15] Oh, what needless pain we bear.
[1:36:22] All because we do not care
[1:36:29] everything
[1:36:31] to God in prayer.
[1:36:34] What did he say to do? He said to take
[1:36:36] it to him in prayer. He said C and said
[1:36:40] with thanksgiving.
[1:36:42] Is
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; that right?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] Thank him for what? His promise.
[1:36:49] You know, we create an atmosphere by the
[1:36:51] things we say, the things we do, and the
[1:36:54] things we think.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we ought to be, you know,
[1:36:59] we have that. We have that power to
[1:37:01] create.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; We ought to we can create it every day.
[1:37:05] No matter where you are.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep your thoughts. Keep your
[1:37:11] mind. Lord,
[1:37:14] he said, he said,
[1:37:18] I'm thinking of this, but the words I
[1:37:20] say and the the meditate. Oh, let it
[1:37:23] please you. The words I speak and the
[1:37:24] meditation of my heart, let it please
[1:37:27] you.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Great an atmosphere. Amen. Amen. I I I'm
[1:37:33] not going to preach. Anyway,
[1:37:36] I'd like to sing this song.
[1:37:42] I believe God knew just what we needed
[1:37:44] tonight. Do you?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart.
[1:37:48] It's a life behind the name. Talk about
[1:37:50] an atmosphere.
[1:37:52] It's the life behind the name. Do you
[1:37:54] know that one? All right.
[1:37:57] It's a life behind the name
[1:38:02] that makes the demon. It's a fight for
[1:38:05] life. It's a life behind the name
[1:38:10] that makes the proud heart humble.
[1:38:14] It was God who devised the plan
[1:38:18] that in all things like a man
[1:38:22] he would live so he could give to us the
[1:38:27] life behind the name. Well, it's the
[1:38:32] eternal life
[1:38:35] that makes the demons tremble.
[1:38:39] It's alive.
[1:38:41] What an atmosphere
[1:38:43] that makes a proud heart humble. It was
[1:38:48] God who devised the plan
[1:38:51] that in all like a man
[1:38:56] he would live so he could give
[1:39:00] us high the name.
[1:39:04] Amen. Is that it? Who's the greatest
[1:39:07] enemy you've got? That's it.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; You.
[1:39:13] You meet him every day. That's the enemy
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; trying to talk. But who are you anyway?
[1:39:20] You are who you are in the soul.
[1:39:23] Amen. You're the word living.
[1:39:27] Amen. So why not create an atmosphere?
[1:39:30] Bring it forward. The just shall live by
[1:39:33] faith.
[1:39:35] Whose his? You have it. The just shall
[1:39:39] live by faith. Where does his faith take
[1:39:41] his an anchoring place? It takes it in
[1:39:43] the word of God. Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; So fight the good fight of faith.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Not a bad fight. It's the good fight
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; because you have the word to stand on.
[1:39:55] The word is eternal.
[1:39:58] God's word is eternal. It can't it had
[1:40:00] no beginning and no end and it cannot
[1:40:01] fail. So what does he ask us to do? Just
[1:40:04] simply believe what he said. Take it.
[1:40:07] Accept it. Act upon it. What kind of
[1:40:09] atmosphere would you create? Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] Amen.
[1:40:15] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:20] Amen.
[1:40:22] Let's just have a word of prayer. Our
[1:40:24] heavenly father, we thank you for this
[1:40:26] time we've had to be able to receive
[1:40:30] your word. Lord, these times are
[1:40:32] precious. We know, Lord, that one day
[1:40:36] these doors could be closed right here.
[1:40:38] But does that take away you from us? No.
[1:40:40] He said, "I will never leave you nor
[1:40:43] forsake you." Oh God, let us continue in
[1:40:47] fellowship. Lord, continue on
[1:40:51] fellowshipping. You desired fellowship.
[1:40:53] You wanted fellowship. You long for
[1:40:55] fellowship. With whom?
[1:40:58] Yourself, your seed, your bride. Lord,
[1:41:02] we just commit this service thanking you
[1:41:04] for your precious word. We haven't been
[1:41:07] here in vain. We're taking what we've
[1:41:09] heard and acting Lord upon it because we
[1:41:13] believe it in Jesus' name. Amen. God
[1:41:17] bless you. See you Sunday. Amen.
