[39:18] formality
[39:21] praise the lord amen the song surface uh
[39:25] the emphasis on the bride

[39:32] just vindication that god truly did lay
[39:35] this on my heart
[39:37] tonight amen
[39:40] just right in line with what we're going

[39:48] you just have to uh jot it down and go
[39:51] make sure i said it right
[39:54] amen praise the lord tonight we're going
[39:55] to speak on this is who you are
[40:00] and the subtitle is are you going to
[40:01] accept it
[40:03] amen genesis chapter 24
[40:12] as a believer as a son of god it's a
[40:15] great
[40:16] burden on my heart
[40:19] for myself and for the believers around
[40:22] me to realize
[40:24] who we are we live in a day in an age
[40:28] that is stricken with uh
[40:30] low self-confidence low self-esteem
[40:33] people taking their life out of
[40:36] desperation
[40:39] but the direct opposite of that is if
[40:41] you could just believe
[40:42] who you are believe what the word says
[40:45] about you i heard it said one time where
[40:46] are you going to take what the devil
[40:48] says about you
[40:49] or are you going to take what god says
[40:50] about you amen genesis chapter 24 verse
[40:53] 10
[40:58] eliezer was sent by abraham to get a
[41:00] bride for isaac
[41:01] and the servant took ten camels of the
[41:04] camels of his master and departed for
[41:05] all the goods
[41:06] of his master were in his hand and he
[41:08] arose and went to mesopotamia
[41:11] under the city of nehor and he made his
[41:13] camels to kneel down without the city by
[41:15] a well of water
[41:16] at the time of the evening even the time
[41:18] that women go out to draw
[41:20] water and he said oh lord god of my
[41:22] master abraham i pray thee
[41:24] send me good speed this day and show
[41:27] kindness unto my master abraham
[41:29] behold i stand here by the well of water
[41:32] and the daughters of the men of the city
[41:35] come out to draw water
[41:36] let it come to pass that the damsel to
[41:38] whom i shall say
[41:40] let down thy picture i pray thee that i
[41:42] may drink and
[41:43] she shall say drink and i will give thy
[41:46] camel's drink also
[41:48] let the same be she that thou has
[41:50] appointed for thy servant isaac
[41:52] and thereby shall i know that thou has
[41:54] showed kindness unto my master
[41:56] and it came to pass before he had done
[41:58] speaking that behold rebecca came out
[42:01] who was born to bethul son of mccall the
[42:04] wife of nahor abraham's brother with her
[42:06] picture upon her shoulder
[42:08] and the damsel was very fair to look
[42:09] upon a virgin neither had any man known
[42:12] her
[42:12] and she went down to the well and filled
[42:15] her picture and
[42:16] came up and the servant ran to meet her
[42:18] and said let me i pray thee
[42:20] drink a little water of thy picture and
[42:23] she said drink my lord and she hastened
[42:25] hasted
[42:26] and let down her picture upon her hand
[42:27] and gave him drink and when she had done
[42:29] giving him drinks she said i will draw
[42:31] water for thy camels also
[42:33] until they have done drinking and she
[42:35] hasted and emptied her picture into the
[42:37] trough
[42:37] and ran again unto the well to draw
[42:39] water and drew for all his camels
[42:42] and so god honored the prayer of of
[42:44] eliezer
[42:45] and the request of abraham and
[42:49] sent the bride for isaac second timothy
[42:52] chapter one
[43:10] hmm
[43:12] verse six
[43:16] wherefore i put thing in remembrance
[43:18] that does throw up the gift of god which
[43:19] is in thee by the putting on of my hands
[43:22] for god hath not given us the spirit of
[43:24] fear but of power and of love
[43:26] and of a sound mind
[43:29] isaiah 55 verse 11 i did i just put it
[43:33] down here

[43:35] just going to read it isaiah 55 11 says
[43:37] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[43:40] of my mouth
[43:41] it shall not return unto me void but it
[43:44] shall accomplish that which i please
[43:46] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[43:48] to i sent it

[44:05] jesus
[44:06] lord may you speak to our hearts tonight
[44:07] we didn't come here to hear an eloquent
[44:10] speech and then we didn't come here to
[44:11] hear somebody who speak like they have
[44:14] it all together
[44:15] because we don't father it's it's all
[44:17] you lord

[44:47] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[44:49] may be seated tonight
[45:00] praise the lord this is who you are
[45:04] are you going to accept it so we read
[45:06] here about
[45:07] rebecca and isaac and eleazar was sent
[45:10] to
[45:11] get a bride for isaac and um
[45:19] he went out and
[45:22] he asked god
[45:25] the damsel that comes that gives the
[45:28] water to my camels then i'll know that
[45:30] this is the one that you have picked
[45:33] and we know that rebecca isaac is a type
[45:36] of christ
[45:37] and rebecca is a type of the bride
[45:40] and
[45:43] we'll come back to rebecca but i wanted
[45:45] to to just
[45:47] the focus i think tonight and
[45:51] what god was speaking to the lord
[45:52] speaking to my heart is that
[45:54] is about fear and um it actually came to
[45:58] me the other day i was uh
[46:00] i am i was out running and i'm i
[46:03] it's i'm just gonna be honest i have a
[46:06] fear of dogs
[46:08] and you would be surprised if you run
[46:10] through a neighborhood
[46:11] how many people's dogs
[46:14] are all over the place and i deal with
[46:18] it constantly and i'm
[46:19] learning to face my fear but i saw this
[46:22] this dog a
[46:23] little innocent old bulldog at the in
[46:24] the driveway of someone's house and
[46:27] i was like oh that if that dog wanted to
[46:29] chase me it could
[46:30] and as i ran past it i kept looking
[46:33] behind me to make sure it wasn't chasing
[46:35] me
[46:36] even though i knew there's no way that
[46:38] dog is not going to chase me it's a nice
[46:39] looking dog
[46:40] i have given it no reason to chase after
[46:42] me and
[46:43] i kept looking back and i had to
[46:45] actually say chris
[46:47] it's not and i had to force myself to
[46:50] look forward
[46:51] and the lord spoke to my heart
[46:54] and i realized what the mama says you'd
[46:57] rip down the rear of your mirror don't
[46:58] look behind you you look behind you you
[47:00] crack up
[47:01] what causes you to look back is fear
[47:05] many times god has come down and and
[47:07] that and and he's given you the the
[47:09] deliverance you've asked for
[47:11] but your fear of going back to that
[47:14] causes you to look back
[47:16] to fall right back into it and and i
[47:19] realize you know
[47:20] begin to think that if the bride of
[47:22] christ if we
[47:23] as the bride of christ if we had
[47:26] no fear of what was behind us
[47:30] that we if we would realize let me say
[47:33] it like this if we would realize
[47:34] who we are there would be no fear of
[47:37] what was behind us
[47:40] you know the the saying goes the armor
[47:42] of god doesn't address the back
[47:45] there's two two ways because you always
[47:47] fight forward
[47:48] but also christ has your back the lord
[47:51] the lord is protecting you
[47:53] but it goes further than that that you
[47:54] have you don't have to fear what
[47:56] what might come from your pastor or what
[47:59] happened
[47:59] in your past once you settled that then
[48:02] that's that's gone that's all behind you
[48:04] and you don't have to the bottom line is
[48:07] you don't have to fear and fear causes
[48:09] you to
[48:10] to what doubt the word of god and uh
[48:13] paul tells timothy says
[48:15] i put thee in remembrance and um
[48:18] remember so remember who you
[48:20] are timothy you know in this in this
[48:23] instance paul is telling timothy we laid
[48:25] upon
[48:26] the the uh in remembrance that thou
[48:29] stirred up the gift of god which is in
[48:31] thee by the putting on
[48:32] of my hands but he's he's reminding
[48:35] timothy
[48:36] who he is he says timothy remember who
[48:38] you
[48:39] are and so tonight remember who you
[48:43] are when the devil comes and says you
[48:44] know and whispers behind you
[48:46] and want you to get to look back just
[48:48] like a lot's wife did she looked back
[48:51] right because she heard the screaming of
[48:52] her loved ones and everything and the
[48:54] angel of the lord
[48:55] the angel said don't look behind you and
[48:57] she looked back and she turned into a
[48:58] pillar of salt
[48:59] a type that we're not called to to look
[49:02] behind
[49:03] us we're called to look forward
[49:06] because this isn't who you are but the
[49:09] devil see the devil can defeat you every
[49:11] single time if he can get you to doubt
[49:13] who you are
[49:14] there's a lot of people in this world
[49:16] today who don't know who they are
[49:18] they're born a female but they think
[49:19] they're a man they're bored
[49:21] a male but they think they're a woman
[49:23] there's many many people
[49:25] looking for their identity it's the
[49:27] thing right go on a road trip and
[49:29] discover who you
[49:30] are the only way to do it is in a vw van
[49:34] a prius won't work right
[49:37] so everyone's trying to find out who
[49:39] they are where they came from
[49:41] you got the the dna test i have one and
[49:45] it's been sitting on my shelf for a year
[49:46] and a half
[49:47] i need to take that everyone's looking
[49:50] to
[49:50] to to discover who they are what's in
[49:52] their background
[49:54] and it's just natural brother branham
[49:57] says natural always types of spiritual
[50:00] and it's a it's a spiritual type the
[50:02] bride of christ is coming to a maturity
[50:04] we're not talking
[50:05] about um we're not talking about god's
[50:08] sin a prophet anymore
[50:10] we're we're talking about who the bride
[50:12] of christ is
[50:13] what was the message that was brought to
[50:15] us it was to show us
[50:17] who we are and it's there and we've been
[50:20] told and
[50:21] and and we know and i think once we
[50:23] catch a revelation of that well brother
[50:25] brown said
[50:26] when the bride catches the revelation of
[50:28] who she are she'll be an invincible army
[50:31] how what makes someone invincible no
[50:34] fear
[50:36] that's like the marines right or the
[50:38] army they train them
[50:40] so they think they're never going to die
[50:43] they don't have fear that no no
[50:44] you know he might die but i'll never die
[50:46] and they just go headlong into
[50:48] into flying bullets because there's no
[50:49] fear
[50:51] and so you as the bride of christ will
[50:53] go headlong into victory
[50:55] but as soon as you fear you stumble you
[50:57] trip
[51:00] fear causes you to look back fear keeps
[51:03] you from accepting what the word says
[51:05] about
[51:06] you you want to know who you are don't
[51:09] go back and read your family history
[51:12] go back and read the real family history
[51:17] don't try to don't try to don't accept
[51:19] what someone
[51:20] said you are that's like they say you
[51:22] know never tell a kid they're stupid
[51:26] or they grow up grow up believing it you
[51:29] tell somebody a lie
[51:31] enough you get them to believe it
[51:34] people want to what happens is the devil
[51:36] puts people in your life and
[51:38] and and and and you you
[51:41] you begin to think you are this person
[51:46] because they keep telling you you're
[51:47] that person
[51:49] that's what the devil wants to do he
[51:51] wants to because here's the thing
[51:53] the the the sieging of god in your heart
[51:56] the holy ghost
[51:57] is who you really are but you fight the
[52:00] flesh
[52:00] every day so if the devil can get you to
[52:03] believe
[52:04] him you're a house divided
[52:08] because the holy spirit brings the flesh
[52:09] under subjection but as soon as you
[52:11] start to believe
[52:12] the devil's report about you just like
[52:15] the children of israel did with the with
[52:16] the spies that went across to jordan
[52:18] they believed the evil report fear was
[52:22] put in
[52:22] into their hearts and they weren't able
[52:24] to accept their promise
[52:26] i mean they weren't able to accept their
[52:28] promise remember that drop that down
[52:30] fear keeps you looking back at what you
[52:32] were
[52:33] instead of forward at who you are
[52:37] that can be anything genesis chapter 15.
[52:47] i've been uh going to the book of
[52:48] genesis
[52:50] um
[52:54] it's good to go back and read read the
[52:57] familiar stories because
[52:58] you'll find there's a lot of little
[53:00] things you missed along the way
[53:02] that and the word of god just keeps
[53:03] unfolding
[53:05] amen genesis 15 verse 1 and after these
[53:09] things the word of the lord came unto
[53:11] abram in a vision
[53:12] saying fear not abram i am thy shield
[53:16] and thy exceeding great reward
[53:18] and abram said lord god what wilt thou
[53:20] give me seeing i go childless and the
[53:22] steward of my house is this eliezer of
[53:24] damascus
[53:25] and abram said behold to me thou hast
[53:28] given no seed and lo one born in my
[53:31] house is mine heir
[53:32] and behold the word of the lord came
[53:33] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[53:35] air
[53:36] but he that shall come forth out of
[53:37] thine own bowels shall be thine heir
[53:40] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[53:42] look now toward heaven and tell the
[53:43] stars
[53:44] if thou be able to number them and he
[53:46] said unto him so shall thy seed be
[53:48] and he believed in the lord and he
[53:50] counted to him for righteousness
[53:54] and he said unto him i am the lord that
[53:56] brought thee out of ur of the chaldeas
[53:58] to give thee this land to inherit it
[54:00] so here we have abram
[54:04] i didn't jot it down so i'm checking
[54:06] back here
[54:07] this is uh ishmael has not come yet
[54:11] so here we have abram and and when the
[54:13] lord called abraham
[54:14] out of
[54:18] heron or of the chaldees
[54:21] he says he said this is in chapter 12
[54:24] verse 1
[54:25] it says get thee out of thy country and
[54:26] from thy kindred and from thy father's
[54:28] house unto a land that i will show thee
[54:29] and i will make of thee a great nation
[54:32] anybody who's anybody knows that means
[54:34] abraham's going to have children
[54:37] and so here is abram and the lord comes
[54:39] to him and after
[54:41] after abraham goes out and he fights and
[54:43] he delivers lot from the
[54:44] those four kings and um the lord returns
[54:48] to him and he says
[54:49] he says look fear not i've i've i've
[54:53] promised it
[54:55] and i'm going to keep that promise i'm
[54:58] the one that brought the out of the ear
[54:59] of the earth the child is
[55:01] to give thee this land to inherit you
[55:03] have an inheritance
[55:06] fear not i will give you a son i will
[55:08] give you this land to inherit
[55:10] and the same promises given to you
[55:12] though time passes and those
[55:14] though though it seems you know to the
[55:16] world
[55:17] over that it's been thousands and
[55:19] thousands of years since christ left the
[55:21] earth and gave a promise he would return
[55:24] to take us home and and people would say
[55:26] well you know
[55:29] we're just going to go on and there's
[55:31] nothing after death and you just you
[55:32] just
[55:33] cease to to exist
[55:37] and the message of the hour that we've
[55:39] been given that word that we've been
[55:41] given people have started to fall away
[55:43] people have started to to to disbelieve
[55:45] this and and
[55:46] and you would think you know well what
[55:49] happened you know like the the 1977 how
[55:52] many people
[55:53] turned and left you know because it
[55:54] wasn't the end of it and and time goes
[55:56] on and what time has a
[55:58] has a has a habit of doing if i could
[56:00] say that
[56:01] is it has a habit of dulling what what
[56:04] you heard
[56:05] originally so when abraham comes out of
[56:08] the land and he goes to follow
[56:10] follow the lord everything was new and
[56:13] everything was exciting and everything
[56:14] was an adventure but after
[56:16] wandering for so long abraham began to
[56:19] get weary
[56:20] and so god comes along and says to him
[56:22] look fear not
[56:25] i am that abraham just went and took out
[56:28] four kings do you think abraham had a
[56:29] lot of fear
[56:31] but god says abram fear not
[56:35] doubt not don't disbelieve
[56:39] though time should pass that's why i
[56:42] have i
[56:43] i've mentioned this before but it comes
[56:45] to me again
[56:46] now you know friends that that said well
[56:48] i asked
[56:49] for the holy ghost and god never gave it
[56:51] to me so i'm going to go out into the
[56:53] world
[56:55] sometimes you have to and when you say
[56:58] terry i don't mean lay at the altar
[57:01] i mean keep on keeping on
[57:04] keep on going to church keep on reading
[57:07] your bible maybe god hasn't healed you
[57:09] yet
[57:09] keep on keeping on keep on reading your
[57:13] bible keep on going to church why
[57:15] because
[57:16] abraham went um what 25
[57:19] how many years 25 years before he
[57:22] received the promised son
[57:25] 25 years i'm only 28.
[57:28] i'm only three years over that abraham
[57:30] was 75.
[57:33] see all that guy's been in the world for
[57:35] 40 years we heard
[57:36] there's no hope for him abraham wasn't
[57:40] called of god till he was 75
[57:44] 75 but the lord says you know it's easy
[57:48] for us because we can read the story and
[57:50] in two verses it's a hundred years
[57:52] give or take sometimes that's 20 years
[57:55] oh wow yes
[57:56] amen god keeps his promises yet you're
[57:59] standing there
[58:00] and that's what you want to believe i'm
[58:02] not saying that but but sometimes you're
[58:03] standing there in the desert and you're
[58:04] wandering the plains of memory so to
[58:06] speak spiritually and you're going what
[58:08] in the world
[58:10] where am i what am i doing
[58:16] and so the lord has come tonight to say
[58:18] fear not
[58:20] it takes time
[58:24] hey you know what at least you only live
[58:25] to be
[58:27] well 80 90 height
[58:30] 100 if you're really lucky abraham lived
[58:33] till he was 185.
[58:36] 175 actually i think it was 85
[58:40] right so god's got to keep his promise
[58:43] to you in a shorter amount of time
[58:47] if you catch what i'm saying here
[58:49] tonight sometimes that promise
[58:51] if the lord so sees it is your reward on
[58:53] the other side
[58:55] sometimes that's that that's your
[58:56] healing amen praise the lord but a but
[58:59] god says to abraham he says fear not i
[59:01] am thy shield and thy exceeding
[59:03] great reward what do we have
[59:07] need of that god can't supply for us
[59:11] tonight look this is who you are
[59:15] keep running that through your head this
[59:17] is who you are i'm reading about
[59:19] abraham but guess what you said you say
[59:21] to yourself when when i i said i am up
[59:23] here reading it but god says to abraham
[59:25] fear not
[59:26] this is who you are you are the seed of
[59:29] abraham
[59:31] isaac genesis 26 23-24
[59:35] says and he went up from dance to bear
[59:38] sheba
[59:39] and the lord appeared unto him the same
[59:40] night and said i am the god of abraham
[59:43] in this chapter chapter 26 i i'm all
[59:47] over the place tonight i i'm skipping
[59:48] back and forth and
[59:50] hither and john i just kind of threw it
[59:51] all on the pages threw it all down
[59:54] trust the lord to bring it together but
[59:56] genesis 26 we see isaac and
[59:58] and he goes into the valley of guerrero
[1:00:02] and um in the philistines where his his
[1:00:05] father abraham had digged wells and the
[1:00:06] philistines wouldn't stop them up
[1:00:08] and he ain't that the devil right god
[1:00:11] does something in your life and he come
[1:00:12] the devil comes behind you and tries to
[1:00:14] stop that up
[1:00:15] well it's time some i get tonight it's
[1:00:18] time for some of us to go back and
[1:00:20] re-dig those wells
[1:00:22] amen praise the lord that one was free
[1:00:24] and isaac
[1:00:25] so so now isaac goes and he digs in the
[1:00:27] valley and
[1:00:28] and he finds a spring of water and then
[1:00:30] the the herdman of
[1:00:31] guerrero did strive with isaac turman so
[1:00:33] there's conflict
[1:00:35] and then so they wouldn't dig another
[1:00:37] well and
[1:00:38] and um and then he left there and then
[1:00:41] they strolled for it again so another
[1:00:42] conflict over this well there was
[1:00:44] fighting so
[1:00:44] isaac's like fine i'll just move on so
[1:00:46] he moves on to another spot he digs
[1:00:48] another well
[1:00:50] and he says oh i will call this rehoboth
[1:00:52] re-hope
[1:00:53] rehoboth for now the lord hath made room
[1:00:55] for us and we shall be fruitful in the
[1:00:57] land
[1:00:58] and he went from thence to bear sheba
[1:01:02] bear sheep was an interesting thing i
[1:01:05] had to go look it up
[1:01:06] so so here is isaac experiencing
[1:01:09] conflict and
[1:01:10] conflict and then he he finds a well and
[1:01:12] he finally digs one then he goes
[1:01:14] and then he after he goes off to
[1:01:16] beersheba
[1:01:18] and beersheba means it is
[1:01:22] a well of the oath because abraham
[1:01:25] made a a an oath with abimelech
[1:01:28] because they i can't remember you have
[1:01:31] to go back and read it but there were
[1:01:32] some kind of
[1:01:32] this uh a bim likes to get out of my
[1:01:34] land until abraham left and then the
[1:01:36] abimelech came back and it's like look
[1:01:37] look look let's be friends let's make
[1:01:39] sure everything's okay so they made a
[1:01:40] pact and made an oath
[1:01:42] at and and um abraham built an altar and
[1:01:45] called
[1:01:45] this place beersheba beersheba was also
[1:01:48] the place that hagar
[1:01:50] that the lord came to hagar and ishmael
[1:01:52] and made water come out of the rock
[1:01:55] and so isaac experiences this conflict
[1:01:58] and this and
[1:01:58] and is striving and he goes to beersheba
[1:02:02] he goes back to the well of the oath
[1:02:04] back to the promise
[1:02:06] because what is an oath an oath there's
[1:02:08] a promise what back to the promise back
[1:02:11] to
[1:02:11] remembrance goes back to the place where
[1:02:15] look this is the place of remembrance
[1:02:17] this is the place of well of the oath
[1:02:19] the promise that god gave to my father
[1:02:21] abraham as isaac and rebecca were still
[1:02:24] had without child at this point
[1:02:28] nope he worked sorry they had jacob
[1:02:31] and esau already but isaac is striving
[1:02:34] and coming through conflict and
[1:02:35] sometimes as a christian you go through
[1:02:37] conflict
[1:02:38] and it's time you you go back to
[1:02:40] beersheba
[1:02:41] or you go to beersheba back to the well
[1:02:44] of the promise
[1:02:45] guess what the word of god is a well of
[1:02:48] promise
[1:02:49] there are promises upon promises upon
[1:02:52] promises
[1:02:52] that god has made to you
[1:02:56] that god has said it's yours alex it's
[1:02:59] yours brother tim
[1:03:01] it's yours sister miriam they're your
[1:03:04] promises
[1:03:05] you read about it in its history
[1:03:07] sometimes you know isaac going to
[1:03:09] beersheba
[1:03:10] this is who you are now all you have to
[1:03:14] do is accept it right
[1:03:16] you have to say yes that's me
[1:03:19] yes that's me you have to accept it for
[1:03:21] yourself
[1:03:23] israel jacob genesis 46 1-4
[1:03:27] and israel took his journey with all
[1:03:29] that he had and came to beersheba so
[1:03:32] israel is heading to egypt
[1:03:38] he's gone for years missing his son
[1:03:41] joseph years of conflict and striving
[1:03:45] and here he is going back to meet joseph
[1:03:48] finally and what does he do
[1:03:49] this isn't coincidence saints of god he
[1:03:51] stops at beersheba
[1:03:54] the well of promise
[1:03:58] and israel took his journey with all
[1:03:59] that he had and came to beersheba
[1:04:01] and offered sacrifices i think i'm going
[1:04:03] to have to do a part two because i think
[1:04:04] this needs a lot more
[1:04:06] going into praise the lord if the lord
[1:04:08] so wills it offered sacrifices unto the
[1:04:11] god of his father
[1:04:12] isaac and god spoke unto israel in the
[1:04:15] visions of the night
[1:04:16] notice now i just have to break off for
[1:04:18] this right real
[1:04:19] real quick here abraham god gives
[1:04:21] abraham a promise
[1:04:22] but see how that promise rolls then to
[1:04:24] isaac
[1:04:26] now now god says i will be with you i
[1:04:29] will keep my promise because of your
[1:04:30] father isaac
[1:04:32] but for excuse me because of my servant
[1:04:35] abraham's sake
[1:04:37] but then you go on and
[1:04:40] and now it's it's it's it's jacob and he
[1:04:43] says i'm going to keep my promise
[1:04:44] because of
[1:04:45] isaac my promise to isaac and so that

[1:08:32] verse one and ahab told jezebel we're
[1:08:35] jumping forward here a few hundred years
[1:08:36] in history
[1:08:41] same god same promise and ahab told
[1:08:44] jezebel all that elijah had done
[1:08:46] and with all how he had slain all the
[1:08:47] prophets with the sword
[1:08:49] then jezebel sent a messenger unto
[1:08:51] elijah saying so let the gods do to me
[1:08:53] and more also if i make not thy life
[1:08:55] as the life of one of them by tomorrow
[1:08:57] about this time
[1:08:58] notice jezebel threatened to kill elijah
[1:09:01] god reversed that
[1:09:02] that that judgment and she was killed
[1:09:06] and when and that's what god's going to
[1:09:08] do he's going to take what they say
[1:09:09] against you kind of like those
[1:09:10] those people that came in the meeting
[1:09:12] that had those prayer cards
[1:09:14] with all those sicknesses and they came
[1:09:15] up to brother branham and they
[1:09:18] he might have called them out of the
[1:09:19] audience i have to look that one up
[1:09:21] but they he says everything you know you
[1:09:23] came to tonight to to
[1:09:25] try to get prayer for stuff you don't
[1:09:26] even have to then say well i wasn't
[1:09:28] healed
[1:09:29] he said not everything on those prayer
[1:09:30] cards you have
[1:09:33] god turn that that that attack
[1:09:37] god turn that attack on
[1:09:41] his on his son back onto them
[1:09:46] praise the lord and when he's uh verse
[1:09:47] three and when he saw that he arose and
[1:09:49] went for his life and came to beersheba
[1:09:51] so you think elijah oh what a great man
[1:09:55] he's a man jezebel threatens him
[1:09:58] you know under the anointing right you
[1:10:00] say oh i could stand before a gun
[1:10:02] and then you're not at the anointing on
[1:10:04] monday morning and then that's when they
[1:10:06] pull the gun
[1:10:08] god gives you what you need when you
[1:10:09] need it praise the lord
[1:10:11] and when he saw that he arose and went
[1:10:13] for his life and came to bear sheba
[1:10:15] here we have elijah in fear and he runs
[1:10:18] to where beersheba
[1:10:20] which belonged to judah and left his
[1:10:22] servant there but he himself went a
[1:10:23] day's journey into the wilderness so the
[1:10:25] wilderness of beersheba
[1:10:26] and came and sat down under a juniper
[1:10:29] tree
[1:10:31] you ever been under a juniper tree in
[1:10:34] beersheba
[1:10:37] and he requested for himself that he
[1:10:38] might die
[1:10:45] and say that i would say he was pretty
[1:10:47] low
[1:10:50] and said it is enough now oh lord take
[1:10:53] away my life for i am not better
[1:10:55] than my father's and as he lay and slept
[1:10:59] under a juniper tree behold then an
[1:11:01] angel
[1:11:01] touched him and said unto him a rise and
[1:11:03] eat
[1:11:04] and he looked and behold there was a
[1:11:06] cake bacon on the coals
[1:11:10] and a cruise of water at his head and he
[1:11:11] did eat and drink and lay down
[1:11:13] him down again excuse me and the angel
[1:11:15] of the lord came again the second time
[1:11:17] and touched him and said arise and eat
[1:11:18] because the journey is too great for
[1:11:20] thee and he arose and did eat and drink
[1:11:22] and went in the strength of that meat 40
[1:11:24] days
[1:11:25] and 40 nights unto horeb the mount of
[1:11:27] god
[1:11:28] so in a time of trouble elijah goes to
[1:11:32] beersheba
[1:11:34] and there at the well of promise
[1:11:38] receives strength and meat
[1:11:41] to go 40 days and 40 nights now i'm not
[1:11:44] telling you to go eat a page out of your
[1:11:46] bible and not eat for 40 days and 40
[1:11:48] nights
[1:11:48] it's a very different thing it's
[1:11:50] spiritually in your life
[1:11:53] god you go back to the well of promise
[1:11:55] and you say you know
[1:11:56] oh you know sometimes
[1:11:59] i did this a while back i was tired and
[1:12:02] i was wore
[1:12:02] out and and and instead of instead of
[1:12:05] trying to think of how i can drink more
[1:12:06] coffee or injected
[1:12:08] straight into my veins or or how i can
[1:12:10] you know
[1:12:11] do this or maybe maybe take this vitamin
[1:12:13] i said lord i need
[1:12:14] strength i need you to give me more
[1:12:18] energy i need you to give me more
[1:12:20] strength
[1:12:22] excuse me and spiritually it's the same
[1:12:26] way they that wait upon the lord shall
[1:12:28] renew their strength
[1:12:29] yes because i know saints of god
[1:12:32] we're real tonight i know tomorrow
[1:12:36] you ain't gonna be feeling so much about
[1:12:37] do not fear
[1:12:39] you're gonna be feeling the fear
[1:12:42] i know tomorrow life's gonna get real
[1:12:46] and or the next day after that you don't
[1:12:49] know what you're facing i i i preached a
[1:12:51] message
[1:12:52] um and back in phoenix and i um
[1:12:55] i was talking about the storm and i
[1:12:57] can't remember what i what exactly i
[1:12:58] preached about but there was a sister
[1:13:00] sitting in the
[1:13:00] congregation who was thinking yes lord
[1:13:02] wow it's so good i'm finally out of the
[1:13:04] storms two days later her husband died
[1:13:06] of a heart attack
[1:13:10] you never know what your future holds
[1:13:13] and she said that
[1:13:14] service not to lift myself up absolutely
[1:13:16] not that service was preparing her
[1:13:19] for what was to come here she thought it
[1:13:21] was a reminder of where she'd come from
[1:13:23] and it was but it was preparing her for
[1:13:25] what she was about to face
[1:13:30] we were good friends with them we we
[1:13:31] went directly to the to the hospital and
[1:13:34] and um so so it was very
[1:13:37] very real to me as a per as an
[1:13:40] individual
[1:13:41] how it's crazy what what happens and how
[1:13:44] quickly our situation can change how
[1:13:47] quick we don't know what comes tomorrow
[1:13:51] but what's the first thing you want to
[1:13:52] do when you hear a story like that fear
[1:13:55] what's that what's the what's the
[1:13:56] reaction of the flesh man it's fear
[1:13:59] but god has not given us a spirit of
[1:14:01] fear but of power
[1:14:03] and of love and of a sound mind
[1:14:06] and she stands today testifying of the
[1:14:08] power of god
[1:14:10] bringing her through the trial are there
[1:14:12] bad days yes
[1:14:15] but god is ever faithful
[1:14:18] i have a good friend recently who
[1:14:19] committed suicide
[1:14:21] leaving his family in shambles and now
[1:14:24] his daughter is questioning
[1:14:28] what does she need she needs to she she
[1:14:30] need well she needs prayer
[1:14:32] but god is faithful she didn't know that
[1:14:36] was in her future
[1:14:39] her mother didn't know that was in her
[1:14:40] future but god
[1:14:42] is faithful and god knows what you're
[1:14:45] going to go through
[1:14:46] and he's not calling you to fear your
[1:14:48] future
[1:14:50] but he's calling you to say this is who
[1:14:52] i am
[1:14:53] and today i accept it
[1:14:57] abraham came to a place where he
[1:14:59] accepted it
[1:15:00] and that's when god gave him
[1:15:01] circumcision
[1:15:03] a covenant of the faith that god
[1:15:05] recognized in abraham
[1:15:08] praise god
[1:15:12] it's time to go back to beersheba back
[1:15:15] to the well of promise
[1:15:16] the well of the oath the well the greek
[1:15:19] uh the concordance strong second corner
[1:15:21] says
[1:15:21] the well of the sevenfold oath i think

[1:15:29] praise god i'm telling you it just keeps
[1:15:31] getting better and better
[1:15:32] the more you go into the word the more
[1:15:34] you the more you read and the more you
[1:15:36] take the time to really take in what
[1:15:38] you're reading
[1:15:38] amen god just brings all of this out and
[1:15:42] what it what is it tonight i have it i
[1:15:44] have a little piece of paper here i
[1:15:45] wrote some notes on
[1:15:46] big bold letters this is who you are yes
[1:15:49] awesome you ever wish you could just
[1:15:51] really get somebody to get it
[1:15:54] i believe i believe by god grace tonight
[1:15:57] that that's not you but that's how i
[1:15:59] feel for myself i've been thinking about
[1:16:01] this myself i said oh it's easy for me
[1:16:03] to get up behind the pulpit and tell you
[1:16:05] this is who you are but what about me
[1:16:08] lord help
[1:16:08] me believe it help me accept it
[1:16:12] you think about all the things you go
[1:16:14] through and the struggles and the little
[1:16:15] the little things you get upset about or
[1:16:17] the things you get offended about
[1:16:19] on a daily basis if you just stop and
[1:16:21] say that's not who i am
[1:16:23] this is who i am you are the bride of
[1:16:26] christ
[1:16:27] oh how dare you confess that i'm sorry
[1:16:33] i'm sorry i'm going to confess it to the
[1:16:36] grave
[1:16:37] that i'm the bride of christ you say oh
[1:16:39] well you're arrogant
[1:16:41] no i'm not i've got humble confidence
[1:16:44] that god gave a promise and god's going
[1:16:47] to keep it
[1:16:49] what is that revelation that's what that
[1:16:52] is that's revelation
[1:16:54] and you know why people get so offended
[1:16:55] by it because they're not revelated
[1:16:59] well it's because the devil hates
[1:17:00] revelation you start to talk about how
[1:17:03] it's christ in you
[1:17:05] living it out and how christ you unzips
[1:17:08] and steps into your body
[1:17:09] and you start talking about how i am the
[1:17:12] bride of christ and you start talking
[1:17:13] about how god has revealed himself to
[1:17:15] you
[1:17:16] and the opening of the word and people
[1:17:17] get offended because there's a
[1:17:19] spirit behind that that hates revelation
[1:17:23] why does it hate revelations because it
[1:17:25] says this is who you
[1:17:26] are that's revelation revelation
[1:17:30] came for you to receive water baptism
[1:17:32] revelation came for you to receive the
[1:17:34] holy ghost
[1:17:35] revelation came for you to see the open
[1:17:37] word revelation came for you to
[1:17:39] recognize
[1:17:40] christ through genesis through
[1:17:43] revelation
[1:17:44] revelation is going to come for you to
[1:17:46] really say i'm the bride of christ
[1:17:49] revelation is going to come for you to
[1:17:51] go in the rapture
[1:17:52] okay brother brown says the verb the
[1:17:54] revelation of the rapture
[1:17:57] lays in the word you know what that is
[1:18:00] do you remember i don't know i don't
[1:18:02] know about if it's the same for
[1:18:03] everybody
[1:18:04] but but in my person in my person in in
[1:18:07] when the lord opened the word to me the
[1:18:09] opening of the word i always say that
[1:18:11] because it was a monumental point in my
[1:18:13] life and i was literally just like
[1:18:16] whoa my mind was blown and i i started
[1:18:18] going back to scriptures i had read
[1:18:20] before and i was like wow now i get it
[1:18:22] now it makes sense
[1:18:23] right god and so for me it was a very
[1:18:25] definitive point
[1:18:26] in my life and so that's how i always i
[1:18:30] reference it but but i really believe
[1:18:32] that's how it's going to be with the
[1:18:33] rapture
[1:18:35] you're going to be sitting here sitting
[1:18:38] here
[1:18:38] or at home listening to a tape or at
[1:18:40] home reading your bible
[1:18:41] or at home just sitting there if you
[1:18:43] ever do that just sit and think about
[1:18:44] the word of god
[1:18:46] you don't have to always get on your
[1:18:48] knees and shout and shake your hands and
[1:18:50] pray and
[1:18:51] sometimes you just meditate on the word
[1:18:52] of god and god just keeps speaking to
[1:18:55] you
[1:18:55] wow wow right maybe it's gonna blow down
[1:18:59] all of a sudden you're gonna go
[1:19:00] the rapture is
[1:19:05] because what happened when you caught
[1:19:07] revelation of the open word you couldn't
[1:19:08] see any other way
[1:19:10] if you get your revelation of the
[1:19:12] rapture you can't do anything but leave
[1:19:17] praise the lord in the moment in the
[1:19:19] twinkling of an eye
[1:19:20] but you know what's you know what's
[1:19:23] amazing about that
[1:19:24] we're all going to catch it at the same
[1:19:26] time
[1:19:29] praise the lord amen so beersheba the
[1:19:32] place of the promise
[1:19:36] so the same in the same chapter in first
[1:19:38] kings elisha goes into the wilderness of
[1:19:40] beersheba
[1:19:41] excuse me elijah and um
[1:19:44] he goes up into the rocks verse 11 and
[1:19:47] he said go forth and stand upon the
[1:19:48] mount before the lord
[1:19:50] and behold the lord passed by in a great
[1:19:52] and strong wind
[1:19:53] first kings 19 11. and the great
[1:19:57] and the great and strong wind rent the
[1:19:59] mountains and break in pieces the rocks
[1:20:01] before the lord but the lord was not in
[1:20:02] the wind
[1:20:03] and after the wind and earthquake but
[1:20:05] the lord was not in the earthquake
[1:20:08] you know what what if elijah would have
[1:20:09] been like some of us and when the wind
[1:20:10] passed by they ran off down the mountain
[1:20:12] shouting about the
[1:20:13] glory of god but then monday came and
[1:20:19] or what if they they heard the wind and
[1:20:21] they felt the earthquake and they
[1:20:22] running off the down the mountain
[1:20:23] shouting about the glories of god but
[1:20:24] then
[1:20:24] monday came again
[1:20:28] or what if after the earthquake they saw
[1:20:30] the fire and they were running off
[1:20:32] down the mountain talking about the fire
[1:20:34] yeah but then monday came
[1:20:36] yeah but elijah stayed
[1:20:40] and lord was not in the fire and after
[1:20:42] the fire a still small voice
[1:20:45] and it was so when elijah heard it that
[1:20:47] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[1:20:49] went out and stood in the entering in of
[1:20:50] the cave and behold there came a voice
[1:20:52] unto him and said
[1:20:53] what doest thou hear elijah the still
[1:20:57] small
[1:20:57] voice moved elijah
[1:21:00] out to speak with god
[1:21:04] elijah is in a turmoil he strives he
[1:21:07] goes to bear sheba god gives him the
[1:21:08] strength
[1:21:09] to then go to the mountain to speak with
[1:21:12] god but then
[1:21:13] but then god sends of great wind then he
[1:21:15] sends an earthquake and he sends a fire
[1:21:18] but the the but elijah waits for the
[1:21:22] word from the lord
[1:21:24] how often it is is it that we that we
[1:21:26] that we we
[1:21:27] we go to beersheba we're reminded of the
[1:21:30] promise we're in remembrance we get our
[1:21:32] strength and then we go out
[1:21:34] and we don't stop to listen
[1:21:37] long enough for god to
[1:21:40] give you the still small voice to then
[1:21:42] step out and say lord what
[1:21:44] is it you have to say to me what are you
[1:21:47] doing what what do you want me to see
[1:21:48] what you want me to catch
[1:21:51] see it's it's funny because in in the in
[1:21:54] the
[1:21:54] in the software industry there's well in
[1:21:57] any industry really
[1:21:58] okay but it's prevalent in in in my
[1:22:01] recent history in my career
[1:22:03] is that people get an idea for a
[1:22:06] a website and then they they we you know
[1:22:08] all right come on
[1:22:09] run run run run run run code code code
[1:22:11] code code code code
[1:22:12] and then it doesn't work because nobody
[1:22:14] to stop to figure out what exactly
[1:22:17] the user is expecting because the client
[1:22:20] says what they want
[1:22:21] but what they say isn't really what they
[1:22:23] want
[1:22:25] so you have to take the time you have to
[1:22:27] stop listen
[1:22:29] write notes ask questions write some
[1:22:32] more notes
[1:22:33] three weeks later you might write some
[1:22:35] code
[1:22:37] same with the word of god suddenly god
[1:22:38] calls you to a place god is in run run
[1:22:40] run run run run
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:44] wait in the mulberry bush david
[1:22:50] you ever been sitting in a bush saying i
[1:22:52] really wish i wasn't sitting in this
[1:22:54] bush
[1:22:55] but uh flies and mosquitoes
[1:22:59] scratchy right
[1:23:05] is the wind gonna blow again
[1:23:08] right it's not always easy to sit and
[1:23:10] wait
[1:23:12] especially for some of us not you people
[1:23:14] like you
[1:23:16] i'm allowed to use that now i live here
[1:23:19] right stop rushing around
[1:23:24] wait for the still small voice why do
[1:23:27] you think
[1:23:28] the entertainment of the world is so
[1:23:29] loud
[1:23:32] and so fast you know it's not good
[1:23:34] enough for just a steady drum beat
[1:23:36] it's gonna be right
[1:23:40] break the drum heads off the drums get
[1:23:43] all crazy you gotta
[1:23:44] shake their heads around other gut
[1:23:46] whiplash
[1:23:48] it's not good enough to drive down the
[1:23:49] highway with your volume at
[1:23:51] 33. the beats going it's got to be
[1:23:54] 100 and then that's not good enough so
[1:23:57] they got to put subwoofers in the back
[1:23:58] of their car
[1:23:59] now there's no one for no one no space
[1:24:01] for anyone to sit
[1:24:04] it's loud because god
[1:24:08] they're they're literally drowning out
[1:24:10] the voice i i saw
[1:24:13] i read this this um there's a guy by the
[1:24:15] name of james clear
[1:24:17] he's an author and he wrote a book
[1:24:18] called atomic habits and he's got it's
[1:24:20] pretty it's pretty interesting
[1:24:22] um but i have a newsletter and he sends
[1:24:25] out these little things and
[1:24:26] and he sent out this study that that
[1:24:28] they took a bunch of a bunch of men and
[1:24:30] a bunch of women and it was like
[1:24:32] you could either you had to sit for 15
[1:24:34] minutes
[1:24:36] that's all it was with no sound no noise
[1:24:39] no outside stimulation unless
[1:24:43] you wanted to shock yourself you could
[1:24:45] shock yourself
[1:24:46] not 12. that's nothing dangerous not 12.
[1:24:50] um and like 60 of men
[1:24:54] and like or 80 of men and 60 percent of
[1:24:57] women
[1:24:58] chose to shock themselves rather than
[1:24:59] sit there for 15 minutes with their own
[1:25:01] thoughts
[1:25:05] have you ever been shocked by like 110
[1:25:11] hello i don't think they were using 110
[1:25:14] but it had to be painful enough
[1:25:16] rather sit there and afflict bodily harm
[1:25:19] and be
[1:25:19] caught with their thoughts that's what
[1:25:22] god wants you to do he wants you to
[1:25:23] stop turn off the noise
[1:25:27] and listen
[1:25:30] stop and listen why is this here in the
[1:25:34] bible we could have just skipped right
[1:25:35] on down to the still small voice
[1:25:37] no god's trying to show you he's not
[1:25:39] always in the noise
[1:25:44] i adventure to say he very rarely is and
[1:25:47] the noise
[1:25:50] praise the lord so still the still
[1:25:54] small voice inside your heart so even
[1:25:57] within you
[1:25:58] and it's funny that the lord knows you
[1:26:00] know he puts things in the sermon but
[1:26:01] what what i what spoke to my heart was
[1:26:05] this was that
[1:26:06] does that you know this is who you are
[1:26:08] that even from within you
[1:26:11] the word speaks out amen
[1:26:14] that still small voice speaks
[1:26:18] out from within you amen praise the lord
[1:26:24] now we read about rebecca and like i
[1:26:26] said it's chopped up so perhaps i put
[1:26:28] that scripture too early if you're real
[1:26:30] we're all sensitive to an organized
[1:26:33] sermon
[1:26:34] there's a baptist church down in the
[1:26:35] corner
[1:26:38] rebecca had to get up that morning
[1:26:40] here's the thing and
[1:26:41] and and i don't know if this is a
[1:26:43] problem anymore today right
[1:26:44] i don't know if this is a problem with
[1:26:46] you all and and by god's grace
[1:26:48] um it's not always a problem i'm not
[1:26:50] even going to say that
[1:26:51] amen praise the lord but many times
[1:26:55] people
[1:26:55] think that they that that that you know
[1:26:57] god's promised it all right
[1:26:59] god has promised it all amen okay so can
[1:27:02] i just go like this
[1:27:03] and wait for the promise
[1:27:06] to come rolling to my feet
[1:27:09] stand up climb into my hands move my
[1:27:12] hand into my mouth
[1:27:16] doesn't work that way so people sit down
[1:27:19] oh praise god he's giving me a promise
[1:27:23] and they sit down and they get up and
[1:27:27] they go so god doesn't keep his promises
[1:27:30] i've been in this message for 30 years
[1:27:33] and i'm leaving
[1:27:34] because god doesn't keep his promises
[1:27:38] or you still serve god you're still
[1:27:40] living and
[1:27:41] you've been going for 10 years in the
[1:27:43] desert and you're sitting there going
[1:27:45] god doesn't keep his promises
[1:27:46] you're sitting under your juniper tree
[1:27:49] even the food that
[1:27:50] the angel brought to elijah elijah said
[1:27:52] i'd put in his mouth
[1:27:54] you think you say well that's silly
[1:27:55] that's so simple yes it is but
[1:27:57] how often do we fail to do that
[1:28:01] so rebecca had to get up that morning
[1:28:03] and go down to the well
[1:28:05] i'm going to take
[1:28:08] a political license i'm going to take
[1:28:11] my liberty to fill in the the gaps in
[1:28:15] this story
[1:28:16] rebecca woke up and she was really
[1:28:19] really really
[1:28:19] really tired the night before she had
[1:28:22] been out with her friends
[1:28:24] a little later than she should have been
[1:28:26] wasn't doing anything wrong
[1:28:27] just having a lot of fun playing a game
[1:28:29] of risk
[1:28:32] and the last morning she woke up and and
[1:28:35] and
[1:28:36] she laid there in bed and she hit snooze
[1:28:41] and she was like there's some mornings
[1:28:44] when you're tired and there's some
[1:28:45] mornings when you're
[1:28:46] really tired and this is that morning
[1:28:49] you start to think of all the excuses
[1:28:52] for not going down to the well well i
[1:28:56] get it later i don't have to have a cup
[1:28:58] of water for a couple of hours
[1:29:01] the horses they'll be fine they're not
[1:29:03] going to die the camels will be fine
[1:29:05] they're not going to die
[1:29:07] maybe laban will get it i was just
[1:29:10] laying but
[1:29:10] maybe i'll just text laban can you get
[1:29:13] the water
[1:29:18] maybe i'll just get on social media and
[1:29:20] talk about how you know
[1:29:21] women shouldn't have to get the water
[1:29:28] no i'm not going to get the water i'm
[1:29:29] just going to read my bible
[1:29:34] no i'm not going to get the water i i
[1:29:36] can't i i'm not gonna go to church i'll
[1:29:38] just stay and play a tape
[1:29:42] wow i went flat
[1:29:47] you see you can you can use
[1:29:50] you can twist the good you can twist the
[1:29:53] good
[1:29:55] but she said but see here's there's
[1:29:57] always the end of the story right
[1:29:58] because we've been there
[1:30:00] but you're here tonight so there was
[1:30:03] that day where you got up anyways
[1:30:06] believe that tonight don't we don't
[1:30:07] wanna we don't leave you hanging on the
[1:30:09] negative
[1:30:10] we believe hanging on the positive
[1:30:13] because you're here
[1:30:14] and you are an overcomer don't look back
[1:30:17] behind you those days you stayed in bed
[1:30:20] go back and remember the day you got up
[1:30:22] and you went down to the well
[1:30:24] so rebecca gets up and
[1:30:28] the pot the only one that was there
[1:30:33] laban must have used the other the light
[1:30:35] one
[1:30:37] late man that guy he beat me to it right
[1:30:40] because there was two pots one layman
[1:30:42] had something he had to do so
[1:30:43] he there was always two pots there was a
[1:30:45] lighter one and there was a bigger one
[1:30:47] well that morning laban felt like he'd
[1:30:49] take the lighter one
[1:30:50] and we know layman he's a cheat right go
[1:30:52] a little farther down in the story and
[1:30:54] you figure that out
[1:30:58] now i think i have my bible wrong
[1:30:59] anyways forgive me if i've messed
[1:31:01] history up
[1:31:02] and uh so rebecca gets the uh
[1:31:08] oh that's right laban was rebecca's
[1:31:09] brother okay so rebecca gets the the has
[1:31:12] to carry the heavier pot
[1:31:14] ever seen pictures of them pots they're
[1:31:17] about
[1:31:17] you know from the lady's hips to her
[1:31:19] head and it's on top of her head
[1:31:21] you ever tried to do that don't
[1:31:24] recommend it
[1:31:26] so she takes it down to the well
[1:31:30] and as she's walking she was thinking
[1:31:33] about her life
[1:31:34] wondering when it was going to go
[1:31:36] somewhere
[1:31:38] wondering when it was going to happen
[1:31:40] she had heard about this god that her
[1:31:42] her uncle had
[1:31:45] followed and left where she was and she
[1:31:48] wondered you know how how was he doing
[1:31:50] out there where was he what was he doing
[1:31:53] and for some reason today she was
[1:31:54] thinking a lot about
[1:31:55] abraham as she's walking down to the
[1:31:58] well and
[1:31:59] and um she began to
[1:32:02] feel something in her heart like man i
[1:32:04] wish i could could have been old enough
[1:32:06] to go with abraham
[1:32:08] i wish i could have could have gone and
[1:32:11] and i wish i would have been alive when
[1:32:12] abraham left and
[1:32:13] and then and and and gone with him
[1:32:18] hey doesn't he have a son
[1:32:22] named isaac it's because it was her
[1:32:25] cousin
[1:32:26] wow i wonder i wonder what he's up to
[1:32:31] you think about the lord he comes near
[1:32:32] right
[1:32:35] yep that's the bible that's the message
[1:32:37] so i rebecca gets down to the well and
[1:32:39] there's this
[1:32:41] guy standing there with some camels
[1:32:45] and she goes and she noticed it
[1:32:48] there was other people there with their
[1:32:49] camels but she noticed this one guy with
[1:32:52] his camels and something
[1:32:54] you know a little connection there she
[1:32:56] gets the water and she's walking back he
[1:32:57] says hey
[1:32:58] he says can i have a drink she's tired
[1:33:01] it's a heavy pot
[1:33:03] to give him a drink she has to take the
[1:33:04] pot off her head give him a drink then
[1:33:06] put it back
[1:33:07] on her head i'm gonna guess it was at
[1:33:10] least
[1:33:11] five gallons of water and that's not
[1:33:12] light
[1:33:14] and uh well it is if you're as buff as
[1:33:17] sean
[1:33:18] um sorry buddy
[1:33:21] so she she puts the the the water down
[1:33:25] and gives him a drink
[1:33:27] and now she she's remember she's tired
[1:33:30] she doesn't want to be getting water and
[1:33:32] she looks at those camels
[1:33:35] and they look really thirsty and that's
[1:33:38] a lot
[1:33:39] of jugs of water somebody broke it down
[1:33:40] one time some preacher broke it down one
[1:33:42] time
[1:33:42] it was a lot of water then things drink
[1:33:44] in one slurp
[1:33:46] like 30 gallons of water something crazy
[1:33:48] like that
[1:33:50] go look it up it's a lot of water and
[1:33:52] she she she gave them water tell the
[1:33:54] camels were satisfied
[1:33:56] so now instead of her morning routine
[1:33:57] going down to getting water being
[1:33:59] half an hour to 45 minutes it stretched
[1:34:01] out into like two
[1:34:02] to three hours of hauling water working
[1:34:06] hard
[1:34:07] and then eliezer gives her the gold
[1:34:10] bracelets tells her about isaac
[1:34:15] and the rest and the rest of me know the
[1:34:16] rest of the story but the but the the
[1:34:18] the thing it is here is that rebecca had
[1:34:20] to go
[1:34:21] meet eliezer she had to get up did she
[1:34:24] know she was meeting ellie easier did
[1:34:26] she know that i was going to be the same
[1:34:27] morning eliza showed up no
[1:34:29] did you know you were going down to meet
[1:34:31] god at the well when you got up
[1:34:33] no but god knew before the foundation of
[1:34:37] the world
[1:34:38] and god laid the way and you met eliezer
[1:34:41] and excuse me eliezer took you on a
[1:34:43] camel to isaac
[1:34:45] and now you are mrs jesus christ
[1:34:48] eliezer once he gets rebecca he goes
[1:34:51] into immediate action and he's like look
[1:34:53] we need to you you know they're like hey
[1:34:55] stay around for a few days
[1:34:58] and he said no way we need to get out of
[1:35:00] here i've got the girl let's go back to
[1:35:02] my master at once
[1:35:03] and so they look at rebecca or we're
[1:35:05] back look same day i believe it is same
[1:35:07] day maybe the next day
[1:35:09] and he's ready to leave no time for her
[1:35:11] to say goodbye to anybody no time for
[1:35:14] her to go and
[1:35:15] what did what is what did jesus say let
[1:35:17] the dead bury the dead
[1:35:19] he said well i'd follow you but i i let
[1:35:21] me first go back and
[1:35:24] rebecca was given the option do you want
[1:35:25] to first go back and she says no i'm
[1:35:27] ready to go
[1:35:29] because when you catch a revelation of
[1:35:31] christ
[1:35:32] you're ready to go you're not you're
[1:35:36] what is that a type of you're not you're
[1:35:37] not looking around saying well wow
[1:35:39] i'm this is fun and i and i want to
[1:35:42] still do this and i want to still hang
[1:35:43] on to this no she was ready to drop
[1:35:45] everything put on the garments he had
[1:35:47] given her the jewelry that she'd given
[1:35:49] he'd given her
[1:35:50] and leave her home behind
[1:35:53] and that's what god called you to do the
[1:35:55] same thing and now
[1:35:57] this is who you are you did the same
[1:36:00] thing rebecca did
[1:36:04] genesis 24 i won't read it for the sake
[1:36:07] of time tonight genesis 24 61-67 you can
[1:36:10] go
[1:36:12] and uh and and look it up i'm just going
[1:36:14] to flip to it so i
[1:36:15] make sure i have my information straight
[1:36:24] right so we're so so eliezer brings
[1:36:26] rebecca and
[1:36:27] and and isaac goes to walk in the field
[1:36:29] in the evening time
[1:36:32] and he sees the camel's far off and
[1:36:35] rebecca sees him and she drops off the
[1:36:37] camel and runs to him because she
[1:36:38] asked asked eliezer who is that guy and
[1:36:41] he said that is isaac
[1:36:44] just like eliezer said this is christ
[1:36:48] and here's the thing that really spoke
[1:36:50] to my heart brother branham says it
[1:36:52] beautifully here he said in
[1:36:54] 1953 earnestly contending for the faith
[1:36:57] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:36:58] he says look it was in the cool of the
[1:37:00] evening when isaac walked out
[1:37:02] and some people say what if you see him
[1:37:04] and he is real dark jew if he is this i
[1:37:06] don't care what he looks like he's my
[1:37:08] savior
[1:37:09] and when the bride sees him it'll be
[1:37:11] love at the first sight
[1:37:14] love at first sight when rebecca seen
[1:37:16] isaac she jumped off the camel and run
[1:37:18] to meet him
[1:37:19] it was love at the first sight i tell
[1:37:22] you when we see
[1:37:23] him it will be love at the first sight
[1:37:25] off we'll go and a way will go into his
[1:37:27] arms certainly how beautiful
[1:37:29] the bride the evening lights coming the
[1:37:31] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:37:33] saints beginning to restore back to the
[1:37:34] church the fig tree
[1:37:36] is putting forth its buds i rebecca sees
[1:37:38] isaac and
[1:37:39] his love at first sight
[1:37:43] you see you saw christ and there was
[1:37:47] love at first sight it was revelation
[1:37:50] that that is christ
[1:37:53] and so and so now you and and and
[1:37:57] you have people that don't that don't
[1:37:59] understand it
[1:38:01] and then and and and they're playing
[1:38:03] tapes and and i don't need to go into
[1:38:05] all of that
[1:38:06] but what why wasn't it love at first
[1:38:08] sight
[1:38:11] maybe they weren't looking maybe they
[1:38:13] were looking at eliezer instead
[1:38:17] maybe they weren't even on the camel we
[1:38:18] don't know but brother brown says it was
[1:38:21] love at first sight
[1:38:24] you saw christ and you said that's
[1:38:27] what i've been looking for that's
[1:38:30] it now i understand
[1:38:33] the bride has met christ amen in the
[1:38:36] evening time it's the evening time that
[1:38:38] we live in today
[1:38:40] and and when she met christ she was
[1:38:42] clothed in the raiment from
[1:38:44] eleazar eliza gave her garments and gave
[1:38:46] her
[1:38:48] jewelry praise the lord
[1:38:54] she was clothed in the word you we were
[1:38:57] clothed in the word we will be clothed
[1:38:59] in the word when we when we
[1:39:00] meet christ praise the lord well we've
[1:39:04] already met christ and we receded seed
[1:39:06] here on here in this crazy world that we
[1:39:09] live in
[1:39:10] but the brown also says in redeemer
[1:39:13] redemption 1955
[1:39:15] he says and now they had a kinsmen there
[1:39:17] by the name of boaz
[1:39:19] and he was a rich man and naomi sent
[1:39:21] ruth out into the fields to glean in
[1:39:23] boaz's field
[1:39:24] which was the custom in the d that day
[1:39:27] and still today right in that same field
[1:39:29] made glean
[1:39:29] behind the reapers so what was she
[1:39:32] gleaning for she was leaning for food
[1:39:34] and that's what the gentile church did
[1:39:36] come in behind the orthodox church
[1:39:37] picking up all they had which was the
[1:39:39] old
[1:39:40] testament gleaning what god give to the
[1:39:41] prophets the gentile church the young
[1:39:44] church the holy spirit church of the
[1:39:45] firstborn
[1:39:46] gleaning when boaz came out to see her
[1:39:49] to see how everything was going on a
[1:39:51] righteous man a type of christ
[1:39:53] boaz was a type of christ when he come
[1:39:54] out to look upon his harvest field
[1:39:56] he was the lord of the harvest christ is
[1:39:58] the lord of the harvest and he came out
[1:40:00] to look upon the field
[1:40:02] and notice as soon as his eyes fell upon
[1:40:04] the beautiful ruth
[1:40:05] it was love at the first sight
[1:40:08] said who is this young maid out here who
[1:40:10] is gleaning in my field
[1:40:15] christ loves you more than you love him
[1:40:22] sometimes we go around and we think you
[1:40:24] know we we
[1:40:25] we beat ourselves down
[1:40:29] because we're looking behind us
[1:40:32] and the lord is standing there going
[1:40:35] that's not what i see
[1:40:37] that's not what i think that's not who
[1:40:40] you are
[1:40:45] the lord and what does that come from
[1:40:48] low self-esteem but i'm here i tonight
[1:40:51] we're here to say that this is who you
[1:40:53] are
[1:40:54] you are this beautiful ruth you are the
[1:40:57] the beautiful rebecca and it was love at
[1:41:00] first sight for you and it was
[1:41:02] love at first sight for christ he says
[1:41:04] that's exactly what i'm looking for
[1:41:07] when he saw you you
[1:41:10] say me believe it
[1:41:14] accept it it's you it's not it's easy to
[1:41:17] say it's for somebody else it's easy for
[1:41:19] me to stand here and say
[1:41:20] it's for you but it's for me
[1:41:24] it's for me that this is who you are
[1:41:28] and you can only catch that by
[1:41:30] revelation from christ
[1:41:32] but love at first sight is revelation of
[1:41:34] jesus christ
[1:41:36] amen i'm closing here musicians want to
[1:41:39] come up
[1:41:41] this is who you are don't
[1:41:44] doubt what god says about you
[1:41:47] accept it and believe it
[1:41:51] doubt is unbelief or the inability to
[1:41:54] accept it for yourself
[1:41:59] brother brown says in in the working of
[1:42:00] the holy spirit he says one day abraham
[1:42:02] sitting in that condition
[1:42:04] talking about love at first sight he
[1:42:06] raised up his eyes and looked one hot
[1:42:08] day and he seen three men coming
[1:42:10] walking had dust all over their clothes
[1:42:12] and abraham was spiritual
[1:42:13] he recognized immediately who that was
[1:42:16] immediately and he ran run out and fell
[1:42:20] down by the side of the man's feet and
[1:42:22] said my lord
[1:42:23] stop by a little while and sit under the
[1:42:26] tree and let me bring a morsel of meal
[1:42:28] and refresh yourself and then you may go
[1:42:30] on for this purpose
[1:42:31] have you come to your servant what they
[1:42:33] looked like men
[1:42:35] but you know who it was see but it says
[1:42:37] it doesn't matter if he's a dark jew or
[1:42:38] what he looks like i'll know him when i
[1:42:40] see him
[1:42:41] his bride will know him when he sees him
[1:42:43] someone called
[1:42:44] my hand on that one time he says and
[1:42:46] said brother preacher do you mean to
[1:42:48] tell me you believe that was god
[1:42:50] i said almighty god set down there as a
[1:42:52] human being and abraham went and killed
[1:42:53] the calf and god eat the meat
[1:42:55] of the calf drunk the milk from the cow
[1:42:56] and eat butter and cornbread
[1:42:58] the bible said god almighty did that and
[1:43:00] angels with him
[1:43:02] you try here's why i pulled this quote
[1:43:04] in i pulled this quote
[1:43:05] because abraham saw at first sight
[1:43:08] abraham knew who he was when he saw him
[1:43:12] sometimes people are introduced to
[1:43:13] christ and they miss it
[1:43:16] but you were introduced to christ and
[1:43:18] you recognized it
[1:43:20] he says you tried to limit god you try
[1:43:23] to limit god to
[1:43:24] your theology you try to let a god to
[1:43:27] your
[1:43:28] way of thinking why he will never do it
[1:43:31] well my god is so great how did he do it
[1:43:33] why it was easy when you see this
[1:43:35] picture here you'll never
[1:43:36] doubt the resurrection you'll never
[1:43:40] doubt
[1:43:40] the resurrection
[1:43:44] when you saw christ you accepted it
[1:43:49] don't limit god this is who you are
[1:43:54] don't accept what the devil says you are
[1:43:56] or what your parents said you
[1:43:58] are or what your friend said you are or
[1:44:00] what some pastor told you you are
[1:44:02] accept what god says you are and god
[1:44:04] tonight is telling you you
[1:44:06] are the bride of christ you are a jewel
[1:44:09] in his crown you are everything he ever
[1:44:13] dreamed of
[1:44:14] because he dreamed you before the
[1:44:16] foundation of the world you are you look
[1:44:20] exactly like he wanted you to because
[1:44:23] you're clothed in his word
[1:44:26] he took you from the field in the
[1:44:28] evening time
[1:44:29] into the tent into the secret place
[1:44:32] because
[1:44:33] you are exactly who he saw
[1:44:37] at the beginning before there ever was a
[1:44:40] an earth hanging in space before there
[1:44:42] was a sun hanging in space before there
[1:44:44] was any planets

[1:50:28] god's promise stands true day after day
[1:50:31] rebecca was not was rebecca was

[1:51:00] god told abraham i will make of your
[1:51:04] seed
[1:51:04] a nation
[1:51:08] and then for 20 years rebecca stood
[1:51:10] barren
[1:51:12] they doubted but god promised i
[1:51:16] will raise up a seed after abraham that
[1:51:19] had to come through isaac and rebecca
[1:51:22] the same promise lays for you
[1:51:25] in the word of god if he did it for
[1:51:28] rebecca
[1:51:29] he can do it for you because that
[1:51:31] promise kept on rolling forward
[1:51:34] and it rolled forward and if rebecca had
[1:51:36] daughters and the daughters had the same

[1:51:40] and then on the next generation that
[1:51:41] promise roll on forward

[1:52:06] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:52:08] return unto me
[1:52:09] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:52:11] i please and it shall prosper
[1:52:13] it shall accomplish that which i please
[1:52:15] what does he please
[1:52:16] for his promise to come to pass in your
[1:52:18] life praise the lord

[1:52:47] righteousness

[1:52:52] because the lamb could look good on the
[1:52:54] outside but it could have a blemish on
[1:52:56] the inside
[1:52:57] so they kept the lamb for four days to
[1:52:59] make sure it was healthy
[1:53:01] just like they kept christ in jerusalem
[1:53:02] for four days
[1:53:06] praise the lord but you've god has given
