sing that little chorus I was born to be a Dwelling Place amen 268. [Music] before I was born to be a dress [Music] let my life now be separated unto thee and I might be but I was born to be [Music] for I was born to be oh Dwayne Dwelling Place a home for the presence of the Lord let my life now be separated unto thee and I might be I was born to be more time for I was born to be [Music] long for the presence of the Lord [Music] that I might be when I was born to be now let's just stand and just enter into the holiest of holies As we sing this again I just I really love that special it just fit with a very conversation we had in the back office before service Amen to know that God has granted to you and I an Open Door amen an open door that he's called us come up a little higher walk through this and my brother and sister were here today it's within our ability to just step right in to the holiest of holies today for I was born to be oh yes [Music] for the presence of the Lord oh lord it's my prayer Lord [Music] separated onto thee that I might be what I was born to be oh let my light now be separated onto be that I might be what I was born to be one more time oh let my life [Music] unto thee and I might be what I was born [Music] Hallelujah is it good to be in the house of the Lord today amen it's good to be here with you back in Grace Tabernacle in the church Camp was wonderful that's all I can just say Camp was wonderful and to those who were not able to make it we missed you so much it would just be our heart's desire that every one of you would have been there Amen to enjoy nature amen pine trees the wind whistling through you know through the trees you could just kind of hear it speak to you and there by the lake just a wonderful not Ambiance but what blessed my heart was that God just happened word just prepared for us our our brother Stephen just brought it and it really blessed my heart and so um I don't want to rub anything in but we sure missed you all and certainly hope and pray that in the future God opens those doors amen I I know that was already spoken but I just definitely a special greeting to brother Terry's sister Shelly and the boys and just um I don't know my kindred spirit I guess sometimes you know the world uses that phrase a brother by another mother and uh you know sat special to you when your heart you just Rejoice my sister Alice I don't know there's not enough age separating us for to be like a mother to me so I guess I have to claim her as a big sister and uh just have a very special fondness in my heart for sister Alice please remember Sister Andrea she's in Liberia and she's on a medical Mission and they're doing cataract surgeries and uh certain countries I guess certain conditions I don't know a lot of factors in there uh she shared a little testimony that was shared with us that it's almost like she's done as many exams in just a few days that she's done over a vast expanse of time there's so much need there so you know our sister Andrea has a testimony isn't it good God's put Witnesses in our midst amen someone wants to talk about healing we've got a sister that we call our sister who can stand up and say God not only has healed me once he's healed me multiple times and he's on the scene and that is a testimony God gave her and who knows who she'll be able to share that with there on this medical Mission and so that brings me also our sister April we know her heart she would long to be in the house of God today so just keep remembering her in prayer amen I just want to share with you something very lovely before we go into the word that um our brother John Andes which many of you have known brother John for many many years and God has has called him and he had to step out in faith and he started a little church on the United States the U.S side there Whatcom County or whereabouts I don't know where the counties start and stop there but to start a church a little over a year ago when they've been meeting in a community center and we've been there before Saints those that have been part of the church going way back where you walk in on a Sunday morning and there's empty beer cans and things spilled on the floor and the atmosphere is just terrible and they've dealt with that God has has just anointed them to deal with that and then someone sees someone share someone and all of a sudden hears a building and they don't sit back and say you know what uh we're gonna just hope that maybe God would do something but I like this and I want this to be a little life lesson to you when God has anointed you to pray whatever the circumstance might be and you pray and you pray with an honest and Open Heart Lord thy will be done and when the door opens in front of you don't decide you need to pray about it for a month amen if it fits the will of God and your motive is right and your objective is right is this not what the prophet taught us then you step into that and they contacted them and said can we look at the building and initially the owner of the building said the last church I rented this building to it's actually a church building and the last church I rented it to didn't pay the rent they tore the building up and we're thinking more like renting it to a daycare or something else and and God was on the scene they rented it to them and today is their first day in their new church and I share all of that because I the new transparent me I never was transparent too much in the past right you just know all my problems and you know my thoughts but anyway um you give an offering to help facilitate that I say this jokingly because we give them Liberty to spend it that way but um you bought approximately 40 chairs for them and uh you know just a little blessing a little love gift that we could just reach out and and give to them of this Grand Endeavor there's a lot of things that you know as the church here that if you're just renting in a building somewhere you don't need those but as they were praying and brother John shared these lovely testimonies to me Lord we got our own building now we need a baptismal oh Craigslist we use baptismal we need to pull look here's a Pulpit and it fits the Decor on Craigslist oh here's this oh here's that and God has just blessed them and if I I should have had the foresight to have done this and just put the picture of the sanctuary up but you would think they've been having Church there for a while they've got everything they need now a building that's been dedicated and I say this for us also Grace Tabernacle a building that's been dedicated to God and is filled with holy ghost-filled people what more do we need amen we have turned it into the house of God and so just remember them they'll be starting probably um about now and just lift a little word of prayer that that their first service they've already got two baptismals to take place today God is moving amen is it good to be in the house of God today hallelujah amen I want to just speak to you this morning as we turn in things that are to be you know I've just become enthralled by this elect lady have you ever met her amen I I just she is the she is the most wonderful lady that you could ever meet in your life they used to say about the Queen of England that she was just this Grand Regal lady well I'm here to tell you she pales in the presence of the elect lady amen and so we stand here today and I want to speak to you on the topic the elect Lady it's more than just a name amen let's turn into Isaiah the third chapter and we will take our original text here from the third chapter verses one through five and then the 12th verse also amen and what we're going to talk about today in essence is lay a foundation of the signs of our time and and we want to look at this because my brother and sister we don't want to focus just on the negative as the negative signs of our time right because we can look out here and say look what's happening oh look at this oh look at this look at that but my brother and sister for every negative sign that we might see there is more than enough positive signs showing that before that can happen this must happen so before the bride can go home amen the prophecies must be fulfilled we don't want to would you today say well Lord just skip over some of those prophecies so we can get out of here no because some of those prophecies concern us we're connected we're interlaced into these prophecies so we want them to come to pass we want that to happen because that's the word being manifested to you and I amen for behold the Lord the Lord of hosts the take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water the Mighty Man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and The Prudent and the ancient the captain of 50 and The Honorable man and the counselor and the cunning artificer however you say that and the eloquent orator and I will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them and the people shall be oppressed Everyone by another and Everyone by his neighbor the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base Against The Honorable Heavenly Father we ask you to bless the word today come father speak to our hearts with a lovely time to be in the house of God lord just to receive from you and rejoice father for the promise has been given and we receive it in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now here in Isaiah 3 I'm actually just going to draw the basic thought from it and we'll go on into Isaiah 4. but we're looking that the Lord of hosts is going to take away from Jerusalem and Judah the stay and the staff and the bread and the water Mighty Man see all of these things being removed from society in the man of war and the man that's a good judge and a prophet and The Prudent and the agent the captains of 50 and Honorable Men and counselors and the cunning and the eloquent and what he's going to do is this prophecy is replace them with children now my brother and sister it's there elevating and you say but did they really give children actual children to be the princess well my brother and sister we're going to look at it in a spiritual context today but if the word said that that was done then it was done we don't have to try and find history to prove uh what it is but you look and what I want to focus and take on a verse 4 today is what it was my brother and sister is it was showing that all honor would be gone and you look in our day in our country you don't have to look anywhere else you'll find that in the leadership and in the high places the prophet of God said you could put a George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in every everywhere and and it wouldn't make any difference because you see it was prophesied that honor would be taken away it would be removed from it and we look at those who rule our nation now and they have no honor they rise to the highest offices and yet it is founded that they have these dark secrets that they have hidden and they have done that and so their honor is marred but you look my brother and sister and see how this comes as honor is removed it is the children the princes and the babes what this is pointing to is immature leadership it is not a leadership with wisdom and I don't want to go into politics today but I believe every one of us plays even a reasonable amount of attention would look and say how could they do what they're doing how could they take our nation and just keep continually driving it into a financial deficit wasting money giving it away like it was free and you look at that and realize that prophecy must come to pass and there is an immature leadership Spirit upon them and you say immature grown men seasoned great but my brother and sister are not one one drop of maturity in the things of God one drop of maturity that would cause them to seek the counsel of God they're anointed by the spirit of the day when the prophet of God said that our nation amen I you know it is what it is we just have to claim it but our nation would be completely bankrupt and it's there we're looking my brother and sister now the great fuss of whether we go ahead and drive the nation from these billions in deficit to these billions in deficit no solution they're not saying you know what we've got to turn the course and go back and correct this problem they're just looking at how do we keep it from getting uh less worse that's not English is it much worse from going you see what happens my brother and sister is it comes to this place that the leadership doesn't know how to fix it and God has anointed them to come to that position can someone say thank you Lord amen because prophecy will be fulfilled it will come to the place that it has to happen and we're here and while they are going their Direction praise God we're going our Direction amen we're not required to walk with them amen we dwell on the same Earth for a season but we're not required to walk with him but it says here the people shall verse 5 shall be oppressed Everyone by another Everyone by his neighbor and the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base Against The Honorable amen and so we look at that and realize now pardon me for using this phrase it's a kind of just a crass almost phrase of the age but my brother and sister have you ever seen so many care friends Papa yeah everywhere you go there is someone there that is there to express their opinion of what you can and cannot do you cannot live your own life in your own backyard because we might hear you you cannot do this or you can't hang uh you know a Christian flag you can't do all of this because uh you're offending me my brother and sister it's there that the oppressors are coming out of the woodwork and you say but why would that be well it's scriptural but my brother and sister this evil spirit laodicea and spirit is breaking through the surface of the Earth it's breaking through the atmosphere and it's becoming more and more manifested and the ultimate of that spirit is total oppression when the mark of the beast when all of that is in control it will be all mankind that is oppressed not just Believers not just Christians amen and so you see this manifesting or breaking out amen well that's while that's breaking out the holy spirit is moving amongst the midst of the bride of Christ and the Holy Ghost is breaking out in people's lives and they're saying I'm tired of this I'm tired of not having Victory I'm not having Liberty I'm going to claim my Liberty I'm going to claim my victory and it's breaking out and Satan they're the great imitator is looking and saying you know what if God can do that for his people I can do that to these people you see he never claimed him as his people because ultimately he'll just destroy him anyhow so you don't want to claim something to destroy you don't talk with pride of some possession only to go out and destroy it so to Satan it's only a matter of manipulation of who he can make to do what he wants because he sees himself as the ultimate where our Lord Jesus Christ sees you and I as a literal part of him amen and no man the scripture says hateth his own flesh amen but that anointing of laodicea sure makes it look as though man hates man amen so you look at this and verse 12 we jump forward as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them oh my people they which lead thee calls thee to Air and destroy the way of thy Pals and so we see this is a perfect prophecy perfect word for the day that we live in and we're seeing how that this is coming to pass and it's here that we see my brother and sister the very world that we live in I could recount to you some that I know personally have taken place some that you hear about but we live in a day and age or a child this took place in the country of Chile and it had a beautiful wonderful ending but we were going to to what was a camp we held way down in the uh in the mountains when we went up there to no not Picone it was anyway it doesn't matter um and as we're going to this Camp there was a brother and sister come and said our child's out of control completely out of control and the child's responses is if you say one thing or do one thing to me I will call the authorities and it will be you not me that's in trouble that's a powerful Spirit when a child threatens the parent and you know they'll support me not you and the parents said brother Paul is there something you can do and I thought about it and I just remember all my child rearing days and the children that God gave us and how that even by the third one is brother Stephen shared at Camp It's a grand experiment and so I had no answer for their experiment and you know all we could do is pray and we went to prayer about that and every time I would see that child there in the camp I would just stop for a moment and say Lord touch that child and when the camp was coming to a close here's a child with a very rebellious Spirit now I know none of us have ever been rebellious so we can't relate to what rebellious Spirits are like but here's a child with a rebellious Spirit but this is why we never give give up hope as parents as Ministry because in a moment of time in one service the Holy Spirit came down and changed that boy's life Amen in one moment and when we we saw that family later because we were going back to their home Church to hold some Services before we come home and when we saw the child the parents just almost weeping of this is like our child God gave us our child back amen the spirit was broken and my brother and sister you get to see how that God is coming and he's here with his people and he said I'm not forsaking you and I will not leave you I'll be with you and we'll touch on that in a minute in a quote here but you look at what God is doing because there's a spirit of Oppression the world is worried today and I'm sorry to touch on this because God some of us we suffer from different things and and whatnot but my brother and sister the world we're living in is getting increasingly neurotic increasingly and you know sometimes you know maybe we have an anxiety uh that's bothering us my brother and sister we've been given the answer maybe we get a little depressed we've been given the answer and maybe we get you know all of the attributes of the mind that we get we've been given the answer we know where to go to get the answer and God is gracious to his people amen and so it's here that we should not identify with verse 5 and say I am oppressed but we should stand on the word and say I know that God spoken I believe it it will come to pass I am an overcomer I am victorious I am of a sound mind amen and somebody might say well brother Paul you don't understand but let me tell you I do understand I have been to the precipice I have stood and looked in the dark hole and I know God's got an answer that brings us back from the precipice God's got the word my brother and sister and he's given it to you and I amen so we look at the age that we're living in and we see the children rising up and we see how it is in influenced in such a fashion let me just throw this in it's not actual children but depending on what your age is if you're 25 a 20 year old doesn't seem like a child to you but the older you get 25 or 20 seems like children amen I can assure you it's how it feels and so you look and and cities like Portland where they just sit back and and a video clip of young men uh with young women rooting them on young men running through a car lot busting the windows out of every car how does that change the world my brother and sister are that's nothing but a demonic Spirit expressing itself bringing an oppression as the scripture calls it on the ancients on the older people are looking and saying what is happening here but these anointings that have come upon them my brother and sister I watched a video also about Portland and this young man is there and when they finally are able to subdue him and you talk about demonic power when it takes three or four big men to hold down one scrawny teenager you know there's something more than natural strength involved and he's snarling and foaming at the mouth and this is the anointing of laodicea of that dark Spirit coming up to the surface of what they've got to look forward to but I'm telling you my brother and sister God said I've got a whole nother plan for you I've got a whole nother vision for you and I want you to see this vision and I want you to live this Vision you know here's some time back we were singing a song and I just uh encountered a little chorus there and I just started you know it's the song I'm in that number and if you remember member I started singing it I'm in that Vision I'm in that Vision Hallelujah there was a vision a prophet said I saw that bride of Christ and she didn't go down over outer sight she went up I'll tell you what I'm in that Vision amen I'm part of that that come to pass in that can you say Amen to that amen so you look at this and see now for the sake of time I could expound a little more here but for the sake of time let's go to Isaiah 4 verses 1 and 2 because we want to stay on on focused today because we are looking my brother and sister about the name and where does the name fit in and how is this and so we come Isaiah 4 verses 1 and 2 and in that day see this is just following it's talking about the spirits it's talking about what is taking place it's talking about the removal of wisdom and Providence and all of these things from society and leaving these that would oppress and it says and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we'll eat our own bread we'll wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away or reproach and now we take another shift and in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious in the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel and you look at this in the very time my brother and sister that seven women seven Church age Spirits are coming saying all we want is your name so this didn't just come in laodicea and suddenly Blossom this has been happening through all of the church ages that they said I'm willing to just take the identity by the name hmm now we believe in the name we not and we want to be under that name we want to claim that name but you've got to understand the counter of that the spirit that is there a name is a covering because we know in the natural that a woman can take a man's name and not be his wife that's right so you look at that in the very time that these women are declaring we only want your name to take away our reproach God's declaring that the branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious in the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly to them that are escaped hey aren't you glad today you've escaped aren't you glad the word had come down and has pulled you out of the spirit of laodicea and taken you into another realm amen the prophet of God talks about the bride age and talking about that glorious time moving forward some tried to make it a Doctrine and say we're not doing there but what God's trying to do is get you and I to see that this world is not our home and he's taking us into a home that we'll be happy we'll be glorified in and we'll be blessed to be in that place amen so you look at that now of those two scriptures that Isaiah prophesies which one do you want to blame you want to disclaim a name or you want to be the branch of the Lord that's beautiful and glorified in this day amen there's two Spirits right in the framework of the church and one wants the name and one wants the uh oh how do you say it not just benefits we're not here just for benefits but you know we're here because this is what God has called us and promised and there's something inside of us a deep calling to that deep aren't you glad that deep is there amen so these prophetic words have come to pass and you look and let me back up a little bit we're seeing Nations run by very immature people greedy people they're just Desiring what the nation can do for them the lifestyle and The Prestige and we're seeing the churches of our modern day run by very immature people what are they led by the spirit of the day the spirit of this evil age as brother Branham preached that's what they're led by I watched a video here recently taken out of a live service and the minister ask for the offering count and they brought up a piece of paper and they put it there and he said it's not enough money past the offering plate again foreign you know what it shows why they're there my god is perfect if God said the offering is going to be ten dollars today and you would have had more money you were going to give you'd have forgot your wallet that's how much my God's in control so it shows they're not about the word they're about the money they're about the prosperity they're about something besides that because if they showed up to church with their Bible they should have been able to have Revival with nothing else hindering them but being able to press into the word amen but you see their spirits and they're led by these immature Spirits these immature men led by Spirits you see logic is gone amen now logic my brother and sister is just another word for reasoning and you know the scripture people say well we don't go by reasoning but the scripture does tell us let us reason together so we don't become ignorant and and just without any kind of understanding but we don't let our reasoning of the flesh control how we approach God we let the word control how we approach God and so it's there that uh they are uh uh uh losing their logic you can see uh just not sound judgmental just facts today amen driving to church you see people getting out of their cars in front of a church and walking in and I'm quite certain they're going to the lake this afternoon because they're in shorts tank tops and flip-flops going to the house of God I want to ask you a question are you not happy that the prophet of God laid a foundation we ought to wear our best church amen we don't need to come to church looking like a bunch of Beach Bums we ought to come to church as we are approaching God in the holiest of holies we are coming face to face with almighty God and awesome God a loving God but also the word says a jealous God Amen and I want to come and present myself appropriately to my God to come and tell him I respect you amen I want to show that I respect you no different than if you were invited to go to some place of high Authority they wouldn't go to the White House in their flip-flops shorts and tank top but they'll go to the house of God now that shows you where their opinion of higher authority is at amen so it's there oh but look what's happened we live in a day and I'm clipped a lot out of this because it's just too big a talk and I I didn't want to start and stop it but my brother and sister it's there that the spirit of church today is that they are assuming it's enough to have the name but the prophet of God said there's many people named Jesus or if you pronounce it in Spanish Jesus many people named Jesus so you have to find the right Avenue when you're talking about the name and the name is over the door the name is on the sign the name is in posters it's in the Creed it's in all of this but it actually is nothing more than a name amen because that name is such a glorious name that name is all-powerful but my brother and sister when used in a fashion and you say well brother Paul what do you mean well look my brother and sister I want to tell you that this I'm going to get ahead of myself here but I hear people in a regular basis use the name of Jesus Christ but it's more often used as a slang or a slander or a vain word than it is used as a holy word and so just to use the name or to speak the name from human lips does not give Authority or power to the name it is how the name is used and who is using it and brother Branham lays that out as he's talking about there's only one lady in the church here that uh her name is Mrs Branham she's the only one that goes home with me amen now there could be any woman walk up to you or I brothers and say husband but it would not apply unless it was our wife amen and when it's the wife speaking the name becomes a beautiful name and the name becomes powerful the name releases the word of God it releases a moving of the spirit but it's got to be spoke by someone who's in the right relationship and so it's not just the fact that we use the name or have the name can speak the name but it must have relationship amen so we look I'll tell you if you do a little studying you'll find this amen even the denominations are starting people starting to lament that the denominations are more like a social club then church and they say oh I would that we would have a church that would just preach the truth do you think they can handle the truth we're Believers and sometimes the truth hurts let me see a hand of those that sometimes the truth hurts yeah yeah sometimes the truth hurts and we're believers and they are well I don't want to judge them anyway God knows but they're there saying we want truth we want truth but when they come face to face with truth they say they're legalistic they're harsh they're this they're that my brother and sister I want you to understand how special that anointing God has placed in you is that you can come face to face and before you run from the word you stop and say Lord is that me that they're speaking about is that me the word is addressing and when the holy spirit moves upon you and says yes it is we say forgive me Lord I need to come back to the truth because you see truth has become subjective everybody's got a different truth and I got that quote from a woman preacher hmm everybody's version of Truth is a little different amen look at vashti history scripture shows us history says vastly was beautiful it's considered one of the most beautiful women of that era of that time she had his name but she wasn't a wife so in her position she could have claimed anything she couldn't have done but you see what God did anointed that to me because he had a plan so it left that spirit that anointing title left a varsity and went to one who desired the relationship more than she cared about the title more than she cared about the name amen we have a brief Glimpse in scripture but you don't see vashti going out saying make this happen because I am Esther I mean not not bashti Esther didn't go out and say make this happen because I am Esther Esther said I want to please my husband when I have a banquet I don't want 5 000 I don't want to entertain all the other women in the Kingdom like vashti wanted to she said I want to entertain my husband and so she prepared her banquet for the presence of her husband and you say but she had motive don't we all come on don't we all have motive amen every one of us has a reason I want to be that the reason I'm in the house of God today the reason that you're in the house of God today is because I couldn't keep myself from being here then I was attracted I wanted to be here I wanted to fulfill the word and be filled with the word amen not that I had to check off some attendance card but there was something in me that wanted to do and I want to be like Esther and I want to just have the Holy Spirit Come to Me come to you move us because we desire it amen not because we claim it we can say I've got the Holy Ghost I'm telling you uh you know I'll just keep this real vague but I have in just the last few years come across people that just emphatically had the Holy Ghost and I would have been I'd rather jumped in a cage with a wild cat then deal with them and they'll tell you I have the Holy Ghost hmm wow now second John 1. I think maybe you would have had to bend there to really been impressed by that thought John 1 1 sec II John 1 1. second John 1 1 the Elder and to the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but also all they that have known the truth for truth's sake which dwelleth in us shall be with us forever so you see John what he's expressing here he is not expressing that you uh fulfill this or you're in this position uh about having a name John didn't say you know to all of you that have the name John said to those of you that have the truth amen so the identity was not in the name I hope you follow me because we are not putting the name of Jesus Christ on a shelf somewhere but we are recognizing the day that we have is a vast majority of people believed by being identified with the name that they actually have him you can have the name without having him I will just drive this home many years ago there was a very well-off man married a wife but she refused to actually be a wife and after a year he said I'm done with this I didn't marry someone just to have in the house to be a show peace to do this and when it went to court in the divorce she wanted all this money she wanted all these assets she wanted all this stuff but ultimately it come down to it the judge says even though you took the name and you lived in his house you never consummated or had the relationship so therefore you were never really his wife that's in the flesh that's in the natural not in this world right here they recognize there had to be an intimacy there had to be a relationship took place it wasn't a matter of just acquiring the name but there had to be something that proved that the wife was really a wife and the husband was really a husband and I say God help us that we're not going to settle for just having a name but we want the relationship we want to have the intimacy with our Lord Jesus Christ to come into the place that we can stand with confidence amen and say I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I am his wife and there's no one to stand there even the devil wouldn't be able to refute it because he would look at your life and say they live like his wife they act like his wife they serve him like a wife how can you deny they're the wife amen and that's what I want to be today I want to be so thoroughly Vindicated it as the Bride of Jesus Christ that the world would say they're different we were in Kem for those of you weren't there we were in Camp and the hosts at the camp over and over and over again said we have a lot of Christians come to this camp but you guys are different oh I want to be different I want to just be another religious person I want God to look down and say that's my wife that's my bride I want the world to look and say they're kind of crazy but they definitely live what they believe oh Hallelujah that's one of the signs my brother and sister of a wife we're not talking about subservience here but one of the signs of a wife who wants to fulfill her position as a wife if she is in harmony with her husband she is there you know I'll just tell on us this morning you know I told Jerry I want a waffle I want a waffle for breakfast but she don't let me eat real waffles because they're not healthy and so you know I was like well she says you really want a waffle and I said I really want a waffle amen so what did she do she fixes up me a waffle I don't know she might have hid it from me I thought I tasted broccoli in there and maybe some spinach I don't know but I got my Waffle she did her best my point is she did her best to please me this morning that I I was looking for something that resembled a waffle and you know why waffles have all those little holes in them like that up and down the little pockets you're supposed to fill them full of butter the waffle is a carrier for butter but because she loves me I'm just trying to make a point because she loves me she went out of her way to make me a waffle and I was happy I was suspicious what's all these little spots in this waffle I was pretty sure that it looked like it was broccoli or cauliflower or something I don't know what but you see my point being is a real wife wants to please her husband and the prophet taught us these lessons a real wife my brother and sister you can put her name on the checkbook and you can put it there and hand her the checkbook and give her the pin amen and it's there as the prophet's telling us God's give us the checkbook he made the deposit he's given us the pin sign it make a claim on the promise of God that's been given to us why because he's not afraid of what he is brought going to do he knows his bride's heart and her heart is to please him amen it's not just to have a coddled life I have an ease of life to have all these things we want to please him can you say Amen this morning Hallelujah and John says you know what it's not going to be this elect lady and she had the name but he identifies her he Praises her he lifts her up why because this elect lady has truth oh I'll tell you isn't that beautiful she's got truth oh hallelujah amen and I want to say today God help us as Grace Tabernacle to be a church that is always identified in truth people I hear lovely testimonies I've got one right on my phone that is praising you as a church amen it's lifting you up as a church of wonderful people that you are wonderful Believers amen that's wonderful but what is it if we're wonderful and don't have truth oh God help us we can be wonderful we can be Godly we can be kind we can be all of these things and have the truth no compromise amen we can be the word walking in shoe leather and be kind loving caring good people oh my god oh well the word said the truth will set us free who wants to be free today Amen in the name of Truth do you know what the name of truth is good Ness did you know truth has a name amen I'm not trying to trick you so be brave the name of Truth is Jesus Christ Our Lord Jesus Christ when you have Jesus Christ you have truth amen but you can have the name of and not have truth you've got to possess him you've got to get your arms around him and not only your arms around him you've got to stop living life long enough for him to put his arms around you right you know husbands Brothers have you ever been there you want to just give your wife a hug but she's maybe doing laundry or cooking supper you're there kind of hinting I go down the hall you kind of put your arm out and they just kind of and they're in the kitchen you kind of go over there there at the stove and you kind of go over there and try and put your arms around them and they just happen to be reaching for the bullion you know and if we're not careful we'll get this idea I don't think she loves me today but it's all in its appropriate time and place say why do you say that brother Paul I'll tell you that it's one thing to walk around in public oh I love Jesus I love Jesus I love Jesus I love Jesus oh did I tell you how much I love Jesus we love Jesus around here in our house we love Jesus what about the evening time you know it's not really Netflix it's the next flick because that's what the devil does I loved how Stephen those of you who want to count brother Stephen was telling us I have addictive behavior I almost jumped out of my Pew me too brother Stephen you know why they put ice cream in half gallon containers because that's how much was meant to be eaten at that time they wanted you to eat less they would have put it in a smaller container come on one thing to be in public what did the scripture show us that was the religious people stood in the gate or the door to the temple smote their breasts oh God I'm so glad I've got more of you than they do I'm so glad that you've blessed me but when the sun sets and no one's watching pardon me I don't mean to be crass but that's the season we make love that's the season we stop and say oh Lord I love you so much who's your Witness who's your witness we often like I want to witness in the workplace well you've got a witness in the private Before You Can Be an Effective witness in the public you've got to come to the place that our relationship is more than the name amen amen and when we get to the place that the relationship is more than the name when we speak the name I'm going to put it this way when we speak the name in public there's power behind it because our husband is saying that's my bride and she speaks it I hear and act upon it amen though it's not just words it's not just words we're not just speaking words we're not just proclaiming this my brother and sister I hope I got the point I'm going to move on Amen now the scripture tells us uh that these wonderful things and I just reworded that when I said the name of Truth is Jesus Christ amen but the scripture also tells us that we're the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty Liberty to what the world out here has said it's liberty because we're under grace to do whatever we want but I tell you what it is Liberty to this bride is to do whatever she wants wait did I just say the same thing no I didn't no I didn't because you see this bride's a different kind of girl and her whole desire when she has Liberty to do whatever she wants her whole desire is how can I please my husband how can I please him what could I do that would bless him and lift him up not what I can get away with it what can I do for him isn't that beautiful I love it amen now I wanted to give you a counter of our day in first Samuel 4 and 21 I I you don't have to post it I don't think I even wrote it on the deal there if you wanted to look in your Bibles you could but what we're looking at in first Samuel is a story about how that the ark is taken uh Eli is now dead son is dead and a child is born and Mom is in such distress she names the child Ichabod now I'm telling you any mother that would name her child Ichabod would had to have been under great distress to have stepped into a position to give that name but there is several different translations depending on language Etc but Ichabod is very similar in all of its translations and centering around the definition of the glory of God is departed now my brother and sister we're knowing in the day that we are living in that Ichabod has been written over the door of organized religion amen so what is it that God has departed there it isn't very hard if you just observe a little bit I tend to be who I am and like to study in the way that I like to study I like to look at things and find a reference to the world I'm out in the world you might find a reference here find a reference there but my brother and sister it's quite apparent that if you took modern religion and its leadership and that's why sisters I thought it was so special your song take modern leadership into the holiest of holies you better be prepared to start tugging on the Rope are you with me they couldn't walk in there be bought and walk out modern religion would walk in there and I'm sorry I'm going to throw a little morbid human humor in there you imagine the pile of preachers would be on the outside of the Tabernacle where they'd say our religion we've got it amen God's blessing us look at all this we've got millions of dollars in real estate brother Brown hit it right on the head right I got investment counts we owned car dealerships we own this we own that and they'd have been pulling them out with the Rope because it wouldn't have passed God's real test hmm Lord help me I don't want to be pulled out I want to walk out I want to walk out and say I met the Lord in there but the vision I'm not trying to make something out of the vision but when brother Branham shares the vision of that little room my brother and sister that was godly people that God was dealing with needs in their lives and expressing given the Holy Ghost and as they walked in there they walked out the other door blessed and I tell you when I come in the presence almighty God I want to walk into the holiest of holies and I want to walk out and be able to tell you as my brothers and sisters I met God in there and he blessed me did he correct me yes he burns a little dross out of me but praise God I met him in there and I'm a better man for that hey man don't want to walk out saying ah well you know God is just a kind God I met Grandpa I met grandpa in the holiest of holies no we don't meet Grandpa in the holiest of holies we meet Grandpa at the dinner table we meet God in the holiest of Holiness amen we've got to get away from this watered-down Grandpa kind of religion amen so look at this we see Ned Ichabod written over the door and it's declaring the glory of God is departing it is departed amen now look my brother and sister this is Paul's spin on it are you guys okay take Paul's spin on it the prophet of God would be close said it would be close it would be right on the cusp when denomination started searching for the oil now look where denominations at they're raising their voice saying we have become a club we have become a social function we have become and they have different terms for this religious men men with all of the ll's and the P's and the Double D's and whatever else attached to the name are stopping and saying what have you done we have fallen off the course now the reason I say it's my opinion I want you to take it like whoa that's it that's it but I believe that's part of it I believe when they come and realize we have missed we've missed it we've focused on the wrong thing we we need to get God back in our churches imagine you're a pastor of a mega church that has like 10 000 people every Sunday morning in your church and you'll stand in the pulpit and make a statement like I believe we've missed the will of God I'll tell you what if I was sitting in that church I'd have to stop and start looking around saying whoa we missed it does that mean we're falling off the Trestle in the river what is it how do we backtrack I want to just throw this out to you my mind your poor attention span California many years ago there was a great train wreck and the engineer realized that they were traveling too fast and he started trying to break the train slow it down but because of the mixture of cars that were in the train what it was made up of they had more weight than had brake capacity and long before the train missed the corner and smashed the whole city and pretty much obliterated it the engineer knew he was done and he turned to the man who lived through the wreck and he told them I guess this is the end my brother and sister God didn't call us to recognize our end as an impending wreck that's right he called us to recognize our end in the glory of Glory in the presence of the king Before the Throne at the marriage supper of the Lamb the Millennium to be able to rejoice and let me back this up here with a quote in just a just a minute let me hurry along here my oh my amen now look at this we speak of a new birth amen we hear it preached in this church quite a bit a new birth and just bear with me but what is being birthed we can talk of a new birth my brother and sister but what is being birthed Amen brother Brown talks about the spirit of denomination are we birthing that amen talking about nicolaitanism are we birthing that we need to have a clear Focus what it is we want birth in our lives do I want to be birthed into a rich man or I want to be birthed into this or birthed into that I'll tell you I want to make it public to the world Amen especially devil listen up I want to be a birthed in the kingdom of God I want to be burst in the word and I want it to come alive in me hallelujah amen there is now I hope you don't mind Mama put this out Marta it is a religious polling group and they they do all kinds of things a lot of it to do with religion and one of their latest polls is that evangelicals are falling away in a just incredible slipping Falling Away now when you go into the message you'll actually find that brother Branham has very little encouraging words to speak of the evangelicals we think wait they were kind of fundamentalists they were kind of there but you see my brother and sister they took the spirit of denomination over the word and when you take the spirit of denomination over the word it can never produce anything I've got a quote for it I'll read it to you here amen so what's happening in this Falling Away Turning Away of the evangelicals my brother and sister amen Church attendance is plummeting they literally will tell you they don't believe going to heaven has any connection to sin [Music] they believe that belief is sufficient I had a brother tell me once he said you know belief is an interesting thing I believe I should own this he said but you better have enough money in your wallet before you walk out of the store with it don't care what you believe hey man I was back before shoplifting was legal you just wait it'll be very soon that shoplifting will be cons an attribute of Christians that's how far it's sliding you can be a Christian and pack out the stereo take the test drive on the car and just park it in your garage and say no while I was driving this and God said this is yours mine no my brother and sister nonsense nonsense so no connection to sin believe that belief is sufficient but I want to ask you what is belief hmm what is belief belief has to have an action does it not it says in their poll they're falling away from the belief but yet in the very connecting statement they said their beliefs have been wavering for decades so they're falling away from what the man interviewing him says so how would you describe this and he says oh they have no Direction it's been slipping they have no Direction come on Saints I hope you catch where I'm at this morning we've got to stay focused on the goal the goal has to be before us and we have to be focused on that goal or else we'll be evangelicals before very long and pretty soon we'll say well I believe God sent a prophet that's all I need oh ouch that I should have kept that to myself shouldn't I hmm look it don't put us any different than them if we come to the place that we just believe God sent a prophet malkai 4 yes got to come to pass it did Hallelujah I believe it came to pass what's that got to do with you hmm you've got a name but you've got no Authority you've got no power I cut this whole section out because I knew I'd be too long but I don't want to be one of the seven sons of Siva I don't want to walk into the devil and say in the name in the name I'm gonna say hey Paul I know you know huh no my brother and sister the name didn't mean anything to those demons there was no relationship to unfold the power of the name there was no relationship that gave them Authority and I'll tell you right now if I can sound almost selfish I want Authority I want Authority God's a power I don't need the power I need the authority that I can turn and say father I need you to come on the scene and he'll say that's my son amen that's my daughter my bride she's speaking she's asking I'm standing amen sorry for getting excited I don't want to have this I don't need titles I want the authority that comes from the relationship oh and they said that it was already there but covered deepened the rift but not their faith you know what my Bible says my Bible says run and hide from fiery traps [Laughter] no that was perfect Brother David I'm glad that you spoke that out because that's that's that that's the human reaction I retrial I'm out of here but that's not what the word says fiery trials are for the molding of our character fiery trials covet come my brother and sister as hard as covet was especially for those in other countries and states and whatever as hard as covet was it was for the benefit and blessing of the bride of Christ it caused us to stop and say what is important what do I need to do is my prayer life locking up my reading of the word oh and that's another one of the things of their poll among evangelicals the reading of the Bible is plummeting come on don't let the devil don't let the devil stop you I don't care if you have to read it from your phone I don't care if you have to whatever amen you do that sister Jerry help me get it you know phone charger I didn't know my I didn't even know the app on the phone would do that but now sitting in a tractor for hours on end I just put it on whatever book in the Bible and I want to listen to and I push the little button and it's actually quite interesting you know isn't it amazing how a real storyteller and God said the Lord help me and God replied and I'm like this is so cool this is so cool this is like almost as real as it gets amen but because it puts something in there that catches your attention I want the word to catch my attention amen I don't want to you know sit there oh I'm listening to the Bible who I don't care if it's covered I don't care what it is don't let it take your faith let it deepen your faith now just as reference we'll move real fast first Peter 4 12-19 beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is his trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but oftentimes we react like it was a strange thing Lord why is this happening to me Lord got the wrong address just write a little story the other day please middle of the night go down the street don't you want to be that police officer is responsible for this they go down the street they got a warrant man's armed and dangerous they bust in the front door they bust in the back door they bust in the porch door they knock windows out they shoot tear gas in there they break furniture on the way in wrong house now wrong house come on my brother and sister God's got the right house he's got the right individual he's got the right people he's got a bride that's here to say I'm here to serve you I'm here to serve you you want me to sing a special song you want me to praise God you want me to stand up in the middle of a service raise my hand shout hallelujah I'm here I'm here Lord whatever you want me to do amen you know in all the years in all the years I've been married it's only a handful of times now I've had to ask my wife to do my laundry only a handful of times life gets busy the hampers clear full of greasy dirty Dusty clothes I get up in the morning honey I got nothing to wear well those pants and shirt was good enough seven hours ago go ahead put them back on when you get home today I'll have it all done for you I've never oh I I want to put this in a more direct fashion never had to beat her to get my laundry done never and you know the more respect that I ask with the greater the response Lord you got to do this Lord you got to do that Lord you got to do this you've got to give me a better job you got to do this that's our subscription more respect Lord I love you I love you and I thank you Lord what you've given to me I proudly bear your name amen I proudly bear identify the scripture tells us that if we would be tried with him amen test it with him [Music] Hallelujah you know why the elect lady lives the word because she is the worst she believes the word she doesn't have to come to a question do I do this or not she realizes God called a people and I am the people amen and I'm ready to be identified by your name amen oh boy I've got so much here I've got to hurry somebody help me hurry somebody say hurry amen I figured sister Jerry would huh spoken word is the Original Seed amen bring that up and we'll just touch on that now part of it look Church Pentecostal nothing why it's hybrid seed it can't come to the word now there you are the body that gives birth to Christ's body again must come from a virgin womb the word that's why listen to this that's why she produced a million more in 44. that was about to slogan and that's why the Pentecostal denominations that could not give spiritual birth to bring forth a manifestation and the Christ because it was only a sowing rain and she's brought forth a denominational Church she Consolidated with the great evangelicals and she's gone the way of Cora she's gone with denomination so you'll see how it was my brother and sister that in that realm right there influenced they believed that it was God in the numbers while their Bible has told them if they had anointed to read it that they was a small elect group not a great group but a small elect group that met in his name not a name his name how can you have his name I'm sorry I'll just kind of put this blunt amen as I said earlier not one sister in here can come up and call me husband except for my wife she's the one that's got the name amen and so there is the bride of Christ in this hour the only one that can come and say my husband amen or even honestly in all truth Abba Father Can Only claim the position of Abba Father because they are of his seed if they're not of his seed they can claim fathership amen and can't claim that without having the proof of the spiritual DNA um let me hurry here now they speak the name I spoke on this earlier about some say it in vain they use it vulgarity some speak it with passion but not revelation my brother and sister it's not how passionate I witnessed this in my lifetime where they were praying for someone that had a need and they would grab halt of them and they would shake them like a dull Rag and because they're going to cast the spirit out but what is it my brother and sister even the denomination back in the day marveled there's men whose testimonies are recorded for Time and Eternity that they Marvel T.L Osborne's one of them marveled that he comes to this person lays hands on them and says Satan in the name of Jesus Christ leave T.L Osborne you can find this testimony he said and we were used to shouting and shaken them and throwing them around and the louder we yell the more certain we were that that demon was leaving and William Branham comes and meets in the Colosseum there and he just lays his hand in the name of Jesus Christ why because there's power in that name but there's relationship that releases the power and oh God I want more of that relationship I want that relationship to flow in me flow out over me I want it to be real Hallelujah not just a form of godliness amen but I want it to be real oh look at this elect lady I need to close this up this select lady what is it she has a relationship that comes with the name she's not running around saying how do I form a relationship it has been revealed to her so the elect lady has relationship she has Revelation that come with a name she has the life that came with the name we don't get the Baptist Holy Ghost and then have to start reading books about how to be a kind good person loving and caring how to be a Christian when you have the Holy Ghost it is revealed in you amen it is exposed as it were in your life and it becomes Who You Are oh I'm trying to be a better Christian forget the trying be a bitter Christian and that means let go and let God have his way not what we can do are we okay for another minute or two Hallelujah amen why you know I love how brother Brandon brought that out I had the spirit of Dillinger whenever I have a gun in my hands out of shooting range I I understand what he's talking about Spirit tin can take this Target take this Spirit comes on you if I had the spirit of Dillinger I'd act like Dillinger and if I had the spirit Picasso or Rembrandt or whoever I would ain't like that and if I got the spirit come on if I've got the spirit I don't have to walk around did you know I'm a Christian I'm a Christian have you I've never met you before I'm a Christian better life that's right her life will speak so loud they'll say I don't know what it is with these people a camp a little sister I don't know how many of you was there when she was sharing this little sister was in a store and this woman walks up to her and says you know you don't have to dress like that and live like that to be a Christian how are we going to respond to that I loved how the sister responded she just turned to this lady and said and how did you know I was a Christian [Music] atmosphere a life speaking the devil recognized it and said I'm gonna discourage her and she was there saying no you're not devil you're not going to discourage me thank you Lord and I'll tell you how easy that is to do sister Jerry and I was taking some college classes once and there was this lady named Carrie sometimes I see sister Kerry I think about Carrie but anyway this lady named Carrie we would go eat lunch with her and the break from classes and so one day we're sitting there eating and I said oh Carrie what church do you go to sandwich halfway to her mouth I'm a hippie oh you know why I made that mistake I looked long hair uncut looked at long dress and I just thought in our world that's a sign of a believer it also apparently is a sign of a certain sect of hippies and sometimes we make the mistake of thinking that bat makes us a believer but even hippies can be kind and polite and not use any bad language and you're with me amen what is it something in US but back to that sister she said I I didn't know how to answer and just come out how do you know I was a Christian could be she belonged to that certain sect of hippies that she didn't the devil knew that yeah amen you see God deals with us as individuals aren't you glad amen because actually it wouldn't be fair if God didn't deal with us as individuals because some of you would be punished more harshly for people like myself amen so God would have to say well I've got to deal with this whole thing imagine now when Aiken did what he did his sin caused punishment to fall on innocent people but God come now and he says I deal with you as individuals but he identifies us now look at this we're moving I'm moving really fast I know it don't look like it he deals with us as individuals but he identifies us collectively so I have to have a new birth of Jesus Christ I have to have the Holy Ghost but he looks at us and says you are my bride and he wraps his arms around every one of us and draws Us in and says you're my bride and I'm so happy to be identified with you and with him amen so what is it the word birthed people are the bride amen it's not a title we bestow because we believe the message amen there are many denominational people identify as bride it's in the scripture and they identify that but their life my brother and sister judgmental or not take it how you please their life does not identify them as a wife that is willing to please they have taken his name but they don't want anything else we'll take our own apparel you know why because he would not approve of their apparel and so they said we'll provide our own apparel so you don't judge us for our apparel and we'll provide everything else if you'll just give us a name we can deal with everything else so then they got the name they put the name over the door and then a prophet comes and lays the word out and says Whoa stop God wrote Ichabod over that door the spirit of God is departed and you say that's judgmental but I want you to understand where he was coming from he was coming from the position that if that church woman is not willing to please her husband to serve him and here again this is not subservient this is not doormat theology this is Sons and Daughters of God with balance in their life with Revelation in their life and the husband just like a pastor is called the preacher in the scripture is as it says the head of all things but he's also the servant so what does that do he's head he's servant it comes down to an even balance and we serve the man is the head he's also the servant amen it comes down to a balance and we as the bride of Christ have been granted the greatest gift that has ever been given to Mankind and we stand here and we can stick our head up in the heavenlies but over here is a flesh man that still plagues us and it brings us into balance that we know that the word has given us Liberty the word has given us life the word has given us Authority but we have a balance that God brings in our life and if you don't think so just get hitty and high-minded believer get heady and high-minded and God will knock you off your little pedestal and cause you to have to cry out and beg him for forgiveness and desire for a balance in your life excuse me I'm getting excited it's a shame I'm almost done preaching I'm excited oh now look at this here now not only the word whatever they want to say about it that's one thing or another but we know we have the scriptures right for we have the Holy Ghost as a witness Can someone say Amen the word is our Witness I I've met men I've been privileged to meet men that were with the prophet and to hear their stories firsthand to have them share that they're sitting around a campfire and they're thinking of thought and they're thinking oh how will this work out and brother Branham just speak up from looking over a cup of coffee and say brother not not a circumstance it'll work out just fine just trust God now that's either the greatest level of psychology that ever hit the land or God is present amen and I have sat here in this church while other brothers have ministered and I have stressed over things in my life and they come and what's really scary is not when the preacher preaches you're sitting over here and the preacher's like now God's going to come on the scene and but when the preacher's preaching he knows nothing I haven't even confessed it to my wife I haven't even shared it with my wife and the preachers up here preaching and he's like and you're just like wow the greatest psychological moment of my life no sir God speaking to his wife God says honey the dinner table how many times have we done it Brothers honey remember we got to pay this bill in the morning right to check and put it in the mail oh and this honey and that it's God sitting right here at our dinner table and he's speaking to us and saying you know what let go let me take care of it I'll put the money in the bank you write the check Hallelujah Lou I'm getting carried away amen God looking down through the optical eye as it was and look down through the magnifying glass and seeing the end from the beginning aren't you glad he knew these Skeptics would rise and try and twist the word in and out like that he knew every one of you has got someone in your family that is just twisted up in this my brother and sister believe but don't think God was surprised we're the one that's like oh what are we going to do God's out there saying don't worry about it I got it all in control I got it all in control you just trust me amen try and twist the word in and out like that he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I'll pray the father and he'll send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost he will abide with you until 1950. 2020 2023 December 31st midnight expired wake up in 2024 and God's nowhere present with us come on my brother and sister for one who was called from the foundation of the world one who God shed his very blood amen through our Lord Jesus Christ shed his blood for us to redeem us you think you're going to wake up some morning and it's just done it's finished it's over it's expired it's canceled not a chance my brother and sister he said I'll be with you even in you and then we're going to come to the place that we recognize he's in me Can someone say he's in me amen hallelujah amen 1954 ever amen that's right forever all right and he would declare and testify of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so we have a wonderful witness of that tonight don't we that's right so what kind of people should we be then amen let's quit looking my brother and sister I'm closing what kind of people should we be now what I'm fixing to say could be so easily misconstrued but I'm going to be bold and say it anyway I don't have to look to the message to know what kind of life I should live is that confusing I don't want to be confusing so I'll clarify I don't have to go find a book oh look what's written right here sister Diane I guess I I'll live it's hard not being cynical as a preacher sometimes when you speak to somebody and you tell them and they look you in the face and say I don't agree well just a second here let me pull this book let me turn to this page right here what brother Brown said oh amen I'm probably just gonna need you more you see the reason I don't have to go to the message to see what I need to live is God rich in Mercy has made me the message I am the word made manifest I have a quote for that in case you need it so before you go I don't agree with that you see my brother and sister that's what's happening we are the word of God the life of God revelation of Jesus Christ being manifested I don't believe it because it's on a page or a tape I believe it because it's in me it's who I am the word says actually that's who I was from the foundation of the world that now I see by God's grace and mercy by the Revelation the revealing of Jesus Christ I see I always want the odd little duck in the chicken yard I always was the strange little kid in the grade school the really strange boy in the high school the really strange person on the workplace I didn't have to go the reason I'm strange is I was just strange and when we figure out why we're strange we rejoice in our strangeness hmm some of you looking at me like no I don't want to be strange well next time they sing this world is not my home please just sit down and don't sing it if you don't believe it because this world is not my own it's not where I belong it's not who I am do I have the name I'm going to sound bold or Brave boastful I have the name amen I have the name the name didn't save me in an intellectual sense it saved me in reality of who I am in Jesus Christ Can someone say amen sister Sarah would you come amen I'm afraid to look at the clock Hallelujah wow especially when I think about brother Terry sister Shelly sister Alice getting home at three in the morning now instead of two amen Lord help us you see my brother and sister we have received the life behind the name a lot of people got the name seven women packing the same name they don't have the life God said you know what if I have to go find a little spiritually orphaned girl she's not here to impress anyone else she's here to do what she needs to do and when he said I'm coming back for you she made herself ready oh God help us let's just stand God help us that we would take that of the Meat Packer's son and realize it's not just a little story but God's speaking to us to make ourselves ready to believe she had no tangible evidence let me bring it up to Modern days he didn't leave his credit card to buy her off he didn't start sending her expensive gifts as the Prosperity Gospel is trying to say God's going to do he gave her his word and said I'm coming back for you and she was there because she was of him from the foundation of the world she was there I believe it set there as it were by the candlelight and sowed that garment and she didn't have to send him an email and say now if I'm going to be your wife how should I dress myself she could already see the different Saints her cousins her cousins he didn't [Music] can I elaborate the prophet's vision those girls were actually quite a bit prettier than her but brother random talked about glow and glare she glowed they glared I want to just glow with the gospel I want to grow glow with the presence of God hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah what is that song Sister Sarah I can't think that if you don't mind Sister Sarah let's sing something that Paul can sing the name of the Lord amen
