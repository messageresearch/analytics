[1:58] [Music]
[2:32] God bless you this Morning. Amen. Good
[2:35] to be gathered together again.
[2:37] Another opportunity to lift our voices,
[2:40] our hands, and our hearts in praise and
[2:42] worship. Amen.
[2:44] Hallelujah.
[2:46] Amen. I'd like to start with number 472.
[2:49] This world is not my home.
[2:53] [Music]
[2:56] Four. Yeah, there you go. Sorry. Amen.
[2:58] Can you agree with me there?
[3:01] It's getting uncomfortable down here,
[3:02] isn't it?
[3:06] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[3:10] passing through. My treasures are laid
[3:14] off somewhere beyond the blue. The
[3:19] angels beckon me from heaven's open
[3:24] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[3:29] world anymore.
[3:32] Look, you know I have no friend like
[3:36] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[3:42] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[3:47] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[3:52] feel at home in this world anymore.
[3:57] They're all expecting me. And that's one
[4:01] thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus
[4:07] many years ago.
[4:10] I know he'll see me through. Though I am
[4:14] weak and poor and I can't feel at home
[4:19] in this world anymore.
[4:23] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[4:28] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[4:33] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[4:39] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[4:44] feel at home in this world anymore.
[4:49] Just over in glory land.
[4:53] We'll live eternally.
[4:56] The saints on every hand
[4:59] are shouting victory.
[5:02] The songs of sweetest praise drift back
[5:06] from heaven shore and I can't feel at
[5:11] home in this world anymore.
[5:15] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[5:21] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[5:26] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[5:32] from heaven's open door and I can't feel
[5:37] at home in this world anymore.
[5:43] Amen.
[5:45] Amen. Number 158. Bless the Lord, oh my
[5:48] soul.
[5:54] [Music]
[5:58] Bless the Lord,
[6:01] oh my soul,
[6:04] and all that is within
[6:09] me. His holy
[6:15] name.
[6:19] That's the Lord.
[6:22] Oh my soul
[6:25] and all that is within
[6:30] me, bless his holy
[6:36] name,
[6:38] for he has done great things.

[7:16] me. Bless his holy
[7:20] [Music]
[7:22] name.
[7:26] Bless the Lord,
[7:29] oh my soul,
[7:32] and all
[7:34] that is within
[7:37] me is his holy
[7:42] name.
[7:45] For he has done great things.
[7:52] He has done great things.
[7:59] He has done great things.
[8:04] Bless his holy
[8:09] name.
[8:13] Amen.
[8:15] Amen.
[8:17] He is doing great things. Amen. We need
[8:21] to recognize that in our situation.
[8:23] Hallelujah. It's not what he has done or
[8:26] what he's going what he word says he's
[8:28] going to because he's doing it now.
[8:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's just
[8:33] stand. I'd like to sing that chorus. Uh
[8:35] Lord, you are so precious or you're more
[8:38] precious than silver. I wrote the wrong
[8:40] one down.

[9:52] more preious
[9:56] than silver.

[10:26] and nothing

[10:36] Hallelujah. Let's just tell him,

[10:43] you are
[10:45] [Music]
[10:46] more preious
[10:50] than silver.

[11:03] than gold.

[22:34] preeminence. Amen. Just hold him up in

[23:45] morning.
[23:46] I wonder if you will allow the great
[23:48] diamond to shape his diamonds this
[23:52] morning. It takes another diamond to cut
[23:54] a diamond.
[23:57] I'm thankful we have a diamond to cut
[23:58] us, mold us
[24:01] to manifest him in this hour. The word

[24:19] how we love you with all of our hearts.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; We can't speak those words seemingly
[24:25] they just Lord through human vessels is
[24:28] inadequate.
[24:30] But you know our heart, oh God,
[24:33] we have come to meet you.
[24:36] We have not come Lord to hear from a
[24:38] man. We've come to hear you speak
[24:40] through a manes
[24:42] &gt;&gt; that the word would do its work in each
[24:44] of our lives personally as it is. It's
[24:47] been said it's doing it. It's being
[24:50] performed.
[24:53] Lord, let us raise up daily.
[24:56] Deny our enemy
[24:58] of self
[25:00] and take up our cross and follow you.
[25:03] Lord Jesus, we present these needs to
[25:06] you in the name of Jesus Christ. They've
[25:08] been brought before
[25:10] your bride.
[25:12] And now you're looking to what your
[25:14] bride will say and what she will speak.
[25:18] For you said, "If you abide in me and my
[25:20] word in you, it shall say what you will
[25:24] and it shall be done."
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; We know that's not human vessels. That's
[25:28] the word veiled behind skin speaking.
[25:33] Lord Jesus,
[25:35] we are expecting here to leave raised to
[25:37] a higher plane
[25:39] &gt;&gt; because of your mercy to give us your
[25:41] word.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, let us not add to and take from
[25:45] that. But let us take you at your word
[25:49] and only believe. Father, we ask for the
[25:52] healing of our little brother, the word,
[25:54] the prayers have gone up for little
[25:55] Isaac. We say in the name of Jesus
[25:58] Christ, that little boy is healed.
[26:01] We proclaim it and we expect to hear the
[26:03] response and knowing that he's well and
[26:05] be for your glory and your honor. We
[26:08] pray give Aona and brother Pashant
[26:12] peaceord Jesus
[26:14] &gt;&gt; strength in this time not looking to
[26:16] what they see but looking to a divine
[26:19] promise.
[26:21] We have faith for that little brother
[26:22] Lord. We have faith for him and declare
[26:24] him well and for your service and
[26:28] purpose. Now Lord be with our sister
[26:30] Julie as she goes back with her mother
[26:32] having surgery. We ask for that lump to
[26:35] disappear.
[26:37] We just ask Lord that if she must go
[26:40] through that surgery then Lord let it be
[26:42] absolutely perfect
[26:45] and ordered according to your desire. Be
[26:47] with her on the road. Be with our sister
[26:49] Lord and the family.
[26:51] And Lord Jesus we just pray for the
[26:54] sister's cousin Lord that you have that
[26:57] she's gone through much struggle. We
[26:58] know that these struggles aren't by
[27:00] chance for your believing pe children.
[27:03] Nothing can happen by chance for
[27:05] believing children, your seed. It's all
[27:08] ordered of God. We ask that through this
[27:11] all that she would be closer drawn to
[27:13] you and may the word of God be
[27:16] fulfilled.
[27:18] And Lord Jesus, there's other needs, I'm
[27:20] sure, that I may not remember, but Lord,
[27:23] you remember every one of them.
[27:24] Therefore, we ask for thy divine purpose
[27:27] and desire to be done, even the hands
[27:29] that been raised. May you fulfill every
[27:32] purpose according to your perfect will.
[27:34] And let it be done right now that it's
[27:36] settled in the heart. The heart is
[27:38] fixed, Lord, that your word is perfect
[27:41] and flawless.
[27:43] It cannot pass away as we receive it.
[27:45] It's in action.
[27:47] We give you praise now. We give you
[27:49] thanks expecting you to be magnified and
[27:53] glorified as you have been already in
[27:55] our worship. We're not here to worship
[27:57] other. We're not here to be seen of
[27:59] others. We're here to meet you. And this
[28:01] we have done and will do more and more
[28:03] as your word is unfolded. But Father, we
[28:06] know that the path of the just is a
[28:08] shining light that groweth more and more
[28:11] to that perfect moment of our body
[28:14] change. We thank you now and give you
[28:16] praise which you're worthy of it in
[28:19] Jesus Christ's name. And we'll give you
[28:22] glory and praise by saying amen to the
[28:26] word. Amen.

[32:43] There's no way to measure what your word
[32:54] crucified,
[33:00] laid behind a stone.
[33:06] You live
[33:08] to die.
[33:12] rejected
[33:13] and alone
[33:16] like a road
[33:21] trampled on the ground.
[33:28] He took the fall
[33:34] and thought of me
[33:40] above all.
[33:43] [Music]
[33:47] Hallelujah.
[33:49] Amen. As we ask our brother Paul to
[33:51] come,
[33:54] let's just stand.
[33:58] that the words of that last song, for
[34:01] whatever reason, they inspired me to
[34:04] sing this song.
[34:06] But so thankful
[34:09] that we have a God that is above all
[34:11] powers, above all kings. He's above all
[34:13] the ways of man. Hallelujah.
[34:17] And because
[34:19] we have a God that is above all these
[34:21] things, and because we have a God that
[34:24] dwells within us, I can sing, "It is
[34:27] well with my soul." Amen.
[34:31] Amen.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:35] Amen. Just sing it out to him this
[34:36] morning. Hallelujah.
[34:40] When peace
[34:42] like a river
[34:45] [Music]
[34:47] attendeth
[34:48] [Music]
[34:50] my way.
[34:53] When sorrows
[34:56] like sea
[34:59] below
[35:00] roll.
[35:06] Whatever
[35:09] my Lord,
[35:11] thou has taught
[35:15] me to know.
[35:18] It is well.
[35:22] It is well
[35:24] with my soul.
[35:31] It is well
[35:38] with my soul.
[35:45] It is well.
[35:48] It is well
[35:51] with my soul.
[35:56] [Music]
[35:59] Oh, Satan
[36:02] should buff
[36:04] it. Though trial
[36:09] should come,
[36:12] let this
[36:14] bless
[36:18] control.
[36:20] Hallelujah.
[36:24] that Christ
[36:27] hath regarded
[36:31] my helpless
[36:35] stay
[36:37] and hath shed
[36:40] his own blood
[36:43] for my soul.
[36:50] It is well
[36:56] with my soul.
[37:02] [Music]
[37:03] It is well.
[37:07] It is well
[37:10] with
[37:12] my soul.
[37:18] I sing hallelujah the bliss
[37:24] of this glorious
[37:28] thought.
[37:31] I sing
[37:34] not in part
[37:37] but the whole
[37:44] is nailed
[37:46] to the cross
[37:50] and I bear
[37:53] it no more.
[37:56] Praise the Lord.
[37:59] Praise the Lord,
[38:03] oh my soul.
[38:10] It is well
[38:16] with my soul.
[38:24] It is well.
[38:27] It is well
[38:30] with
[38:32] my soul.
[38:38] And Lord,
[38:41] haste the day when my face
[38:47] shall be sight.
[38:52] The clouds
[38:54] be rolled back
[38:57] as a scroll.
[39:05] The trump
[39:07] shall resound
[39:11] and the Lord
[39:14] shall descend.
[39:18] Even so.
[39:21] It is well
[39:24] with my soul.
[39:31] It is well
[39:37] with my soul.
[39:42] Oh,
[39:45] it is well.
[39:48] It is well
[39:52] with
[39:53] my soul.
[40:00] What Lord
[40:02] is for thee.
[40:05] For thy coming
[40:10] we wait.
[40:13] The sky
[40:16] not the gray
[40:19] is our goal.
[40:27] Oh shout
[40:29] of the angel.
[40:34] Voice
[40:35] of the Lord.
[40:39] Blessed
[40:40] home.
[40:42] Blessed
[40:44] rest
[40:45] of my soul.
[40:52] It is well
[40:59] with my soul.
[41:06] It is well.
[41:09] It is well
[41:12] with
[41:14] my soul.
[41:16] [Music]
[41:20] It is well
[41:26] with my soul.
[41:34] It is well.
[41:38] It is well
[41:41] with
[41:43] my soul.
[41:49] God bless you.
[41:52] I would like to give Lisa the church age
[41:54] book. Could you see that that would
[41:56] happen today?
[42:00] Let's just sing that chorus again.
[42:02] [Music]
[42:04] It is well
[42:08] [Music]
[42:12] &gt;&gt; with my soul.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; with my soul.
[42:19] It is well.
[42:23] It is well
[42:27] with
[42:29] my soul.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Could we just lift our hands today and
[42:34] just say, Lord, thank you.
[42:37] Thank you, Lord, that we have a rock
[42:39] that we are anchored to. That we can say
[42:42] today, it is well. We're not here with
[42:45] doubts and fears, but with a certainty.
[42:49] Oh Lord, we just lift our hands in our
[42:51] hearts to say thank you for a word
[42:53] that's come, a lifechanging word,
[42:57] Father, that has come and anchored us,
[43:00] Lord, today. We're not blown by every
[43:03] wind, every storm, every idea of man,
[43:07] every circumstance of the world, but
[43:10] Father, we're anchored in you today. And
[43:12] we can say thank you. Thank you for the
[43:15] confidence Lord that you place in our
[43:17] hearts. Oh, we still face trials. We
[43:20] still face struggles Lord. We still have
[43:23] our days Lord. But Father, we are
[43:26] overcoming this flesh. And Father, in
[43:29] the overcoming of this flesh, we are
[43:31] gaining in a spiritual man, gaining our
[43:34] rightful position, Father, that you
[43:36] called us to. Lord, just bless our time
[43:39] today. we ask Lord in your name. Amen.
[43:43] Amen.
[43:45] Amen. We just like to ask you I I I
[43:49] [Music]
[43:51] kind of told Brother Isaac, it's like I
[43:53] got something I can't remember, but my
[43:55] granddaughter Aaliyah, if you would just
[43:58] lift her up in prayer. uh she has I
[44:02] don't know that I would call it a blood
[44:04] issue but a blood imbalance that has
[44:06] left her um very weak uh with no
[44:11] strength and um we're just desiring for
[44:14] the Lord to just touch her. So please
[44:17] remember uh Jolyn and Aaliyah today as
[44:20] they are home and just ask the Lord to
[44:23] come and and touch them and any other
[44:26] needs that we might have here today.
[44:28] Just uh take a moment and just to just
[44:33] remind yourself God knows your need, but
[44:35] he wants to hear it from you. He wants
[44:37] to hear you say, "Lord, I have this need
[44:41] and you can touch my need." Amen. Is it
[44:45] good to be here today? Amen. I would
[44:49] like to speak to you this morning. God
[44:51] bless you, brother Cody. Oh, Sister
[44:53] Sammy, Sister Lois, God bless you. Good
[44:56] to see you guys. Um, I want to speak to
[44:59] you on our part of redemption. Now, we
[45:02] can look at this plan and say, you know,
[45:04] it's it's God that redeemed us and
[45:06] everything else is taken care of. But,
[45:09] you see, we actually have a part. God
[45:11] bless you musicians. I appreciate the
[45:14] song service was beautiful and the
[45:15] music. Amen. God has given you and I a
[45:19] part in the plan of redemption. Now the
[45:22] prophet of God puts it out in this
[45:24] fashion. He says you have to receive the
[45:28] promise.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; And so if we have a promise and it's
[45:32] never received, remember the story of
[45:33] the man who would not receive his
[45:35] pardon. It was given to him. Abraham
[45:38] Lincoln had signed that pardon, but he
[45:41] thought they were just mocking him. And
[45:43] he did not receive it. And it went to
[45:45] the courts. And the court says, "A
[45:47] pardon is not a pardon unless it is
[45:49] received as a pardon." And I say today,
[45:53] a blessing of God is not a blessing of
[45:55] God unless you will receive it as a
[45:58] blessing. And some people on the earth
[46:01] today, what you as a believer, as a
[46:03] Christian, would say, "God is blessing
[46:05] me." Now, you might see this a little
[46:08] different light than I do. You say, "God
[46:10] is blessing me." And other people say,
[46:12] "It sure looks like God doesn't love
[46:13] you." Because the scripture says that
[46:16] you're going to go through fiery trials.
[46:18] Amen. And we don't think fiery trials
[46:21] are blessings, but fiery trials are
[46:23] blessings. Amen. So, may the Lord just
[46:27] bless you. I pray today. Turn in your
[46:29] Bibles if you would uh as we speak on
[46:32] this our part of redemption. and um
[46:35] Matthew 19
[46:37] 16- 22 very very familiar uh uh piece of
[46:42] scripture uh maybe I'm using it in a
[46:45] slightly different context today but uh
[46:49] you will find it a very familiar
[46:51] scripture
[46:53] Matthew 19 vers 16 through 22 pardon me
[46:59] for a moment
[47:06] And behold, one came and said unto him,
[47:10] Good Master, what good thing shall I do
[47:13] that I may have eternal life? And he
[47:17] said unto him, Why callst thou me good?
[47:20] There is none good but one, that is God.
[47:26] But if thou wil enter into life, keep
[47:28] the commandments. And he saith unto him,
[47:31] which and Jesus said, "Thou shalt do no
[47:33] murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[47:36] Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not
[47:38] bear false witness. Honor thy father and
[47:41] thy mother, and thou shalt love thy
[47:43] neighbor as thyself." And the young man
[47:45] said unto him, "All these things have I
[47:48] kept from my youth up. What lack I yet?"
[47:52] And Jesus said unto him, "If thou wilt
[47:54] be perfect, go and sell that thou hast
[47:57] and give to the poor, and thou shalt
[48:00] have treasure in heaven, come and follow
[48:03] me."
[48:04] &gt;&gt; When a young man heard these sayings, he
[48:06] went away sorrowful, for he had great
[48:10] possessions. Heavenly Father, we just
[48:12] ask you to come, Lord. Just speak to
[48:15] each and every heart today, Lord. We
[48:17] didn't come to be seen. We didn't come
[48:19] to be heard. Lord, we come even as a
[48:21] man, I come with my own burdens today,
[48:24] Lord. Just asking you, Father, Lord, to
[48:26] move on every life, every heart, every
[48:29] circumstance, Lord, to speak to us the
[48:32] words of life that we need for another
[48:35] day. Father, we know that your word has
[48:38] said that you desire to bless us. May we
[48:40] receive that blessing today. Let us not
[48:43] put limitations of I'm not worthy or I
[48:46] have circumstance, but receive the
[48:48] blessing, Lord. That's what you want us
[48:50] to do. And we come today to receive
[48:52] that. If that blessing looks like
[48:54] correction from the word, Lord, we
[48:57] receive it. If it comes to answer a
[48:59] question, Lord, we receive it. If it
[49:01] comes, Lord, just to fill us a little
[49:03] fuller in our spirit, Lord, we receive
[49:05] it today. Whatever you would desire,
[49:08] Father, we want to receive it. And we
[49:11] receive it now in the name of Jesus
[49:13] Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Amen.
[49:19] this young man
[49:21] having seemingly done everything
[49:24] that was necessary. We'll look at that,
[49:27] my brother and sister, and um I I think
[49:31] now don't take this in the wrong
[49:33] context, but I think if he was sitting
[49:35] in our midst, we would have thought that
[49:37] he was a stellar Christian. We would
[49:38] have thought that here's a young man
[49:40] that just does everything just according
[49:43] to the word of God so perfectly. But you
[49:46] see, it is there that there was
[49:48] something uh that was missing. And God
[49:52] discerned that. Amen. He believed the
[49:54] message. If I could put it to you this
[49:56] way, he believed the message, but there
[49:58] was a great big butt behind that. He he
[50:01] had a little something there. And and of
[50:04] course, we can see by the scripture that
[50:06] it was by his possessions, the lands,
[50:09] and the prosperity that he'd been
[50:11] granted. And as I have said, this is
[50:13] just a personal outlook. You've heard it
[50:15] many times here in the church. I believe
[50:17] if he had given $5,000, God would have
[50:20] blessed him with 10. Amen. Because what
[50:22] God was wanting him to do was surrender
[50:25] himself. It wasn't about his money. It
[50:27] wasn't about his lands. It wasn't about
[50:30] his prestige. God wanted him. Amen. And
[50:33] if we'll ever surrender ourselves to
[50:35] him, then God can truly bless us in the
[50:38] fashion that he desires to bless us.
[50:40] It's it's not about, let's face it,
[50:42] saints, if we're real Christians, real
[50:44] believers. It's not about our bank
[50:47] account, our houses, our lands. It's not
[50:49] about any of that. It's about us
[50:51] yielding to Jesus Christ. It's about
[50:53] what we give back to him. Because, as
[50:56] the scripture says, he has the cattle on
[50:58] a thousand hills. And you know,
[51:00] especially if you go to the grocery
[51:02] store lately, you'll realize those
[51:03] cattle on a thousand hills are worth a
[51:05] lot of money. Amen. So, he doesn't need
[51:08] our money. Amen. It's not about our
[51:10] money. People get all caught up. The
[51:12] preacher just wants our money. If you
[51:14] have surrendered to the Lord, you don't
[51:16] care because your money is his money and
[51:19] he gives you his money when he sees you
[51:21] need it. Amen. So, we look at that and
[51:23] realize what God is doing. So, he
[51:26] believed the message,
[51:28] &gt;&gt; but that's right.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; There was a little something. Now,
[51:31] Hebrews 4:12, it says here, "For the
[51:34] word of God is quick and powerful and
[51:37] sharper than any two-edged sword,
[51:39] piercing even to dividing a sunder of
[51:41] soul and spirit, and of the joints and
[51:43] marrow, and is a discerner of the
[51:45] thoughts and intents of the heart." And
[51:48] here the rich young ruler is standing
[51:51] before Jesus. And uh Jesus doesn't say,
[51:54] "Uh, I remember a time when you didn't
[51:57] hold this commandment.
[51:59] I remember a time when you come short
[52:02] here. Jesus discerned right to the
[52:05] intent of his heart and said, "You know
[52:07] what? I see what it is that's hindering
[52:10] you." That's right.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; See, if he had come with a different
[52:12] approach, if he had had a different uh
[52:15] outlook upon what Jesus was saying, he
[52:17] would have said, "Oh, so Jesus, you're
[52:20] saying the issue in my life is actually
[52:23] my possessions. I give them to you,
[52:25] Lord. Here they are. What do I do with
[52:28] them?" And and I share this just as a an
[52:30] opinion if you might call it that if
[52:32] he'd have started in that approach and
[52:34] said, "Lord, I just give it all to you
[52:36] today. I have nothing." You see, God
[52:39] gives gifts. Some of you are good
[52:41] farmers, brother Cody. Some of you are
[52:44] good barbers. Some of you good this that
[52:46] and the other. I don't know, you know,
[52:48] to go through every occupation. But God
[52:51] gives you gifts, right? His gift was the
[52:53] ability to make money. His ability as a
[52:56] businessman. And he had that ability. It
[52:58] was something in him that he understood.
[53:01] And I I'm completely convinced if he
[53:04] would not have put the butt up there,
[53:06] right, which negates whatever's in front
[53:08] of it, if he'd have just said, "Lord, I
[53:09] give it to you today. I surrender it to
[53:12] you today," then God would have used
[53:14] him. There wouldn't have been a Lazarus
[53:16] laying on the street corner in rags and
[53:19] in sickness. There wouldn't have been
[53:20] many issues like that. But you see, it
[53:23] really come down. And and although
[53:25] there's no absolute connection between
[53:28] this scripture and uh the man laying uh
[53:31] there and begging for them to have
[53:34] Lazarus dip his finger and bring it over
[53:37] to him to quench his thirst. But you'll
[53:40] see as it is in the time that his barns
[53:42] were full. His prosperity had reached
[53:44] its maximum capacity that God said,
[53:47] "It's time. I call on your soul." And
[53:49] and none of that did him any good. He
[53:51] might have gave his offerings and paid
[53:53] his tithes, but God wanted him.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was what it really come down
[53:58] to. And and so, you know, uh, every one
[54:02] of us, if if this is a little
[54:04] straightforward today, then I just have
[54:05] to say, so be it. But every one of us
[54:08] has an issue that hinders us, that holds
[54:10] us back. Every one of us has something
[54:13] that we battle with. Every one of us has
[54:15] something that Satan wants to use to
[54:19] keep you from going forward. He wants to
[54:21] keep you from reaching your full
[54:23] potential in Jesus Christ. And he can
[54:26] just use that and anoint that. It might
[54:29] be a complex. It might be a little
[54:30] bitterness. It might be a hurt that
[54:32] you've had. And I'm not delegitimizing
[54:35] the fact that when we get hurt, we can
[54:37] be hurt, my brother and sister. But if
[54:39] you're holding on to that, Satan is
[54:42] using whatever happened in your life.
[54:44] You say, "But brother Paul, you don't
[54:45] understand how seriously that affected
[54:48] me." No, but I understand how thorough
[54:50] the blood of Jesus Christ is. And when
[54:53] we would come with that approach and
[54:55] say, you know what, that happened in the
[54:57] past, but the blood of Jesus Christ is
[55:00] covering me and I do not have to be
[55:02] controlled by last year, last decade,
[55:05] last century, whatever it might be. I
[55:08] don't have to be controlled. It doesn't
[55:09] have to be my previous pastor, previous
[55:12] friend, previous whatever. that God is
[55:14] in control. I'm going to let go of that
[55:17] and I'm just going to freely give myself
[55:19] to God, not going to hold myself back.
[55:22] Amen. Because you see, my brother and
[55:24] sister, if we allow Satan to use
[55:27] whatever little something happened in
[55:29] our life, Amen. If we allow him to use
[55:32] that, we'll go no further than it is
[55:35] theoretically, if you would say, or
[55:37] figuratively is what I mean to say. The
[55:39] dog on the leash, on the chain, only
[55:42] goes as far as the master gave him
[55:44] length of the chain to go. And this is
[55:47] going to hurt. Amen. If you've got a
[55:49] hurt, a bitterness, a complex, something
[55:52] holding you back, you are not in
[55:54] control. And God is not in control. Oh,
[55:56] my God is in control. Right? That leash
[55:59] that Satan put on you with a complex is
[56:02] actually what's in control of you.
[56:04] You're going to go as far as he does.
[56:06] And when he tugs on that, Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Remember Johnny Crow?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He still had wings. He still had
[56:13] strength. He could still fly. But he had
[56:15] been tied up for so long. He didn't
[56:18] think he could fly. He just hopped
[56:20] around in the same circle he lived in.
[56:23] And if you like that circle, help,
[56:25] forgive me for being blunt. If you like
[56:27] the circle that you have been living in,
[56:30] then don't don't push out. Don't don't
[56:32] stretch out. Don't reach for more. Don't
[56:35] ask for more. Don't look for
[56:36] deliverance. Just keep hopping around in
[56:38] your circle. But if you're a son or
[56:40] daughter of God today, you're not
[56:42] earthbound. You're not called to be
[56:44] constrained by the spirit of this world,
[56:46] the politics of this world, the
[56:48] economics of this world. You are called
[56:50] of God to live in a heavenly kingdom and
[56:53] to rise up into heavenly places. That's
[56:55] where God called you to be. It's time,
[56:58] little church. It's time for us to
[57:00] spread our wings and say, "God has given
[57:02] me liberty through the word of God. I am
[57:06] not going to be bound by the principles
[57:08] of this world. I'm going to fly in
[57:10] heavenly places. The word is set me free
[57:13] and I will be free. Amen. Because what
[57:16] the word has done, my brother and
[57:18] sister, has broken every feder and has
[57:21] broken every circumstance, chain of
[57:24] circumstance that Satan wanted to use to
[57:27] keep you bound. It's time for us
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; to accept it.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah,
[57:32] &gt;&gt; it's time for us to say, "This is my day
[57:34] of deliverance. This is my day of moving
[57:37] forward. This is my day, you might say,
[57:39] of letting bygones be bygones." That
[57:41] things in the past that that uh bring
[57:44] such emotion and hinder me. Amen. We'll
[57:47] see marriages. We see relationships. We
[57:49] see friendships. We see all of these
[57:51] things and relationship with the Lord
[57:53] all bound by chains of circumstance. My
[57:56] brother and sister, the chain is broken
[57:58] today. God has given us liberty in Jesus
[58:02] Christ. Amen. So you see this young man
[58:05] had been given at that time. Now I'm not
[58:08] trying to imply that because someone
[58:10] does not react at a certain time or
[58:12] place that the window or the door is
[58:14] closed on them. I'm not implying that.
[58:16] But this young man had been given an
[58:19] aotted time to lay hold on eternal life.
[58:22] Now I want to emphasize this point. You
[58:25] can be laying hold on eternal life today
[58:28] or you can lay hold on your
[58:30] circumstance. You can lay hold on the
[58:33] problems you have of of uh things of the
[58:36] past, current things. You can lay hold
[58:38] of that, but have you ever watched I
[58:40] actually thought about bringing a prop
[58:42] today, but I didn't want to come across
[58:43] as some kind of a a show as it were, but
[58:46] I'm telling you my brother and sister,
[58:48] if you've got both hands full, you can't
[58:51] pick up or hold on to anything else.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. And over here, I've got a
[58:55] complex. And over here, I have a
[58:57] bitterness. I have something I I either
[58:59] I I know I should ask for forgiveness or
[59:02] I should give forgiveness. And my hands
[59:04] are full. And God's saying, "Lay hold on
[59:06] eternal life." What What are you going
[59:08] to do?
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants you to let go of this.
[59:11] He wants you to let go of this. And he
[59:14] says, "Lay hold on eternal life. You got
[59:17] to let go of this, to take this, to
[59:20] accept this." And Satan says, "No, I'm
[59:23] going to give you something to hold on
[59:24] to because if your hands and your heart
[59:27] and mind are full, you will not be able
[59:30] to lay hold on eternal life."
[59:32] &gt;&gt; That's why people go through life with
[59:34] all kinds of things in their life. They
[59:37] look back and tell you the time, the
[59:39] place, the second, even the very words
[59:41] that were spoken with accuracy. My
[59:43] brother and sister, what they don't
[59:44] realize is Satan has fooled them to
[59:47] holding on to something that has no
[59:50] eternal value. Nothing going to replace
[59:54] letting go of that. Nothing's going to
[59:56] to come by holding on. It's going to be
[1:00:00] well, do I accept this and lay hold on
[1:00:03] eternal life or do I keep a hold of what
[1:00:04] do I got?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; You know, my brother and sister, this
[1:00:08] been when I was a kid, but you know,
[1:00:11] they used to have that show. I don't
[1:00:13] even remember its name. I want to say it
[1:00:15] was Price of Right. They had Price is
[1:00:17] Right. They had doors and people would
[1:00:20] be there and they would say, "Here's
[1:00:21] $10,000."
[1:00:23] Now, if I was on that show and they
[1:00:25] said, "Here's $10,000." I'd say, "Thank
[1:00:27] you." And they'd hear a door slam.
[1:00:31] But they'd say, "Would you like to trade
[1:00:33] your $10,000 for what's behind door
[1:00:36] number one?"
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Door number two,
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; door number three.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of silly analogy is
[1:00:49] this?"
[1:00:51] Well, I want to tell you, God's already
[1:00:53] given you eternal life. Satan's trying
[1:00:56] to get you to trade it for something
[1:00:58] that's behind an unknown door. We as the
[1:01:02] bride of Jesus Christ have a promise of
[1:01:04] the word. What he has promised us, it is
[1:01:07] in our hand. It's been given to us. It's
[1:01:10] time for us to lay hold on that and say,
[1:01:13] "I'm not going to trade it for some
[1:01:15] promise that Satan's got going to make
[1:01:17] me a millionaire, going to make me a
[1:01:19] this, going to make me a that." No, I'm
[1:01:20] sorry, Satan. I'm not trading my promise
[1:01:22] in the word of God for something unknown
[1:01:25] result.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have something. I got eternal
[1:01:29] life. And God's telling us today, don't
[1:01:31] let it pass you by. Lay hold on that.
[1:01:33] Keep a hold of that.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; He had a moment that was allotted to him
[1:01:45] to receive.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; All it took was a few words, saints. It
[1:01:49] wasn't about words.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; No, that's right.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; It was about something in the heart.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; And he actually while he had followed uh
[1:01:57] you don't don't lift your hand,
[1:02:00] but how many of you have followed every
[1:02:02] commandment every day of your life?
[1:02:08] And I put it that way to drive home the
[1:02:11] point. This was an extraordinary
[1:02:14] young man. He declares to Jesus, I've
[1:02:17] lived this
[1:02:19] From my youth up, I have lived this. And
[1:02:22] I'm not driving home to condemn anyone,
[1:02:24] but to drive home the point here was an
[1:02:26] extraordinary young man. But
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; you see, what he should have done is let
[1:02:33] go of that and laid hold of eternal
[1:02:36] life.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; But,
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; and I want to ask you today, a little
[1:02:45] straightforward.
[1:02:47] Do you have a butt in your life?
[1:02:51] Is there something that you need to let
[1:02:54] go of? I want to break the ice for you.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I'll lift my hand first.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Got things need to let go of.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because as long as I'm holding on
[1:03:06] to these things,
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; I can't lay hold on eternal life in the
[1:03:11] fashion that God wants. You might hold
[1:03:13] on with one hand.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, reminds me of a
[1:03:16] story. I hope you don't mind me sharing
[1:03:18] this. It's a little morbid, but there
[1:03:19] was a a young man who was this
[1:03:21] extraordinary uh uh ability, agility,
[1:03:24] strength. And even as just a child, he
[1:03:27] he got into rock climbing and and there
[1:03:30] was pictures of him at some spot where
[1:03:32] the the the path up the rocks goes. And
[1:03:35] it's literally an overhang and it had
[1:03:38] little shelves in it. And you had to
[1:03:40] hold on with your fingers, not hands,
[1:03:42] fingers, and go out and then go around
[1:03:45] the corner of the rock to climb up. And
[1:03:47] this young man, my brother and sister,
[1:03:49] had such an ability that he would climb
[1:03:52] up there. And he would do chin-ups with
[1:03:54] his fingertips in the cracks of these
[1:03:56] rocks and do chin-ups. But you see,
[1:03:59] those who followed, who didn't have the
[1:04:01] same ability and tried to do such
[1:04:04] things, fell hundreds of feet in the
[1:04:06] rocks below and died a tragic death.
[1:04:09] Now, my brother and sister, if you don't
[1:04:10] mind me putting it this way, you are an
[1:04:13] extraordinary people. You've been called
[1:04:15] from before the foundation of the world.
[1:04:18] You've been given an ability to live in
[1:04:20] Leodysia. Not just live, but to thrive
[1:04:23] in Leoa. not to just exist as
[1:04:26] Christians, but to do this super and
[1:04:28] exceeding and above measure that God has
[1:04:31] called you to. And my brother and
[1:04:33] sister, don't look down on those who
[1:04:35] can't live this. And don't look down on
[1:04:37] yourself when you have a butt moment.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; But God's still talking to you. He's
[1:04:44] still calling you. He's still telling
[1:04:46] you, "Come up a little higher. Come up a
[1:04:49] little higher, my brother and sister."
[1:04:51] You know, I I I I'll share the sermon
[1:04:53] here one of these days. I almost
[1:04:55] preached it today, but a little lack of
[1:04:57] preparation. But there's a there's a
[1:04:59] mountain. It's not really a mountain.
[1:05:01] It's a great rock spire. And and many
[1:05:04] people have tried to climb it. And these
[1:05:06] guys said, you know, somebody someday is
[1:05:09] going to climb that. And we're going to
[1:05:11] be the ones. Amen. My brother and
[1:05:13] sister. And that's as far as I'm going
[1:05:14] to go to ruin that sermon. But look at
[1:05:17] that, my brother and sister. See, they
[1:05:18] didn't look at that a rock spire. Many
[1:05:21] people have tried to live the word in
[1:05:23] Leodosa, but I guess it can't be done.
[1:05:26] No, there is something in the bride of
[1:05:29] Jesus Christ that says somebody's going
[1:05:31] to live this word. Somebody's going to
[1:05:33] take a rapture. Somebody's going to
[1:05:35] fulfill this scripture. It might as well
[1:05:38] be me.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to be me. I'm going to be the
[1:05:42] one that does it. And so I let go and I
[1:05:45] let go. And my childhood, maybe it
[1:05:47] wasn't the greatest. I let go of that. A
[1:05:49] relationship maybe not the greatest. I
[1:05:51] let go of that circumstance in church
[1:05:54] and days gone by. I let go of that. My
[1:05:57] own complex, I let go of that. My fear,
[1:06:00] I let go of that because I'm going to
[1:06:02] climb into heavenly places.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be one that's going to live
[1:06:06] the life. I'm going to live this gospel.
[1:06:09] I'm going to live the word. I'm going to
[1:06:11] stand there before them and they're
[1:06:13] going to say, "How did you live in
[1:06:15] Leodosia?" And you're not going to say,
[1:06:17] "Well, I did this and I did that."
[1:06:19] You're going to have to say, "I really
[1:06:21] honestly don't know other than my Lord
[1:06:23] Jesus was with me. He walked with me and
[1:06:26] he talked with me. And when I was weak,
[1:06:28] he was my strength. And when I had no
[1:06:31] understanding, he was my knowledge. And
[1:06:33] when I had no love, huh,
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; that's the one none of us admit
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; that we can lose our love."
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. We get to the place we
[1:06:44] look at people, family, friends,
[1:06:46] relationships
[1:06:48] more like a tolerance.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; I said vows to them, but now I just
[1:06:54] tolerate.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's it.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, my brother and sister. That's
[1:06:57] not what the word called us to.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Let go of it.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Let go of it. We're not here to
[1:07:03] tolerate.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; I go to church with some believers.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you like them?
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; I tolerate them.
[1:07:13] No, that's not what the word's talking
[1:07:15] about.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; You got to come to the place you can let
[1:07:19] go.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Let go.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Let go.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Let go.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; He had his moment to lay hold on eternal
[1:07:31] life and we are living ours right now.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; This is our moment, saints. Don't Don't
[1:07:37] let it be history to you. Don't let it
[1:07:39] be a day gone by that you would say,
[1:07:41] "Oh, I had." No,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; don't have had.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Have
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; possess,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; lay hold on eternal life right now. You
[1:07:52] see, this is our part of redemption.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Hope you don't mind a little dehydrated
[1:07:56] this week.
[1:08:02] You see, as I said already, Satan will
[1:08:06] do anything he can to keep you from
[1:08:10] completely letting go.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope you don't mind. This is here
[1:08:14] again something maybe some people would
[1:08:16] find a little morbid, but you want to go
[1:08:19] trap a raccoon.
[1:08:22] You don't need an elaborate trap. You
[1:08:24] don't need all kinds of scents. You
[1:08:25] don't need all kinds of things. You need
[1:08:26] a drill bit. That's right. and you bore
[1:08:29] a hole in the log. Then you drive a nail
[1:08:31] at an angle. And then you put the lid
[1:08:34] out of a can in the bottom and it's nice
[1:08:37] and shiny. And the raccoon puts his hand
[1:08:40] in there, his little paw in there to get
[1:08:42] a hold of the shiny lid of the can. And
[1:08:45] because he's too stubborn to let go, and
[1:08:47] he can't pull it out past the nail, he
[1:08:50] has trapped. Did you trap him?
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; He trapped himself. Yeah.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; See what Satan's trying to do, saints?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; He puts these things out here. We take a
[1:09:02] hold of this. Oh, I I I had to
[1:09:04] apologize. As I've shared with the
[1:09:06] church, I used to think I had a bunch of
[1:09:08] German blood in me, but it's so small. I
[1:09:10] can't use it as an excuse no more. But I
[1:09:12] used to say I'm stubborn because I'm
[1:09:14] German.
[1:09:17] And then I found out I wasn't German.
[1:09:19] So, I have to recognize I'm just
[1:09:21] stubborn.
[1:09:24] Yeah.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And as long as I had German as an
[1:09:26] excuse, I could hold on to that
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; and say, "I can't help it. I am what I
[1:09:31] am. I was born this way." Well, it was.
[1:09:34] I was born in sin and shaped in
[1:09:36] iniquity. I came into this world
[1:09:37] speaking life. But I have been promised
[1:09:40] and you have been promised a
[1:09:42] deliverance.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let go of that shiny lid.
[1:09:47] Let go of those things because they say,
[1:09:49] "Well, the devil did it." No, you're
[1:09:52] doing it under an anointing from the
[1:09:53] devil. But as long as you won't let go
[1:09:56] of it, you're trapped.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; It's time to let go.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Let go and let God.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, 1 Timothy the 6th chapter 11-
[1:10:06] 21. Lengthy reading here.
[1:10:10] But thou, oh man of God, flee these
[1:10:12] things and follow after righteousness,
[1:10:14] godliness, faith, love, patience,
[1:10:16] meekness. fight the good fight of faith.
[1:10:20] Now,
[1:10:23] if you've ever been around
[1:10:27] period of my life as a young man, I I
[1:10:30] wasn't serving God and I hung out in
[1:10:33] mall parking lots and theaters and stuff
[1:10:36] like that. Some things we won't go into
[1:10:38] details. Um,
[1:10:41] but I can just remember one time some
[1:10:43] high school kids from two different
[1:10:44] schools.
[1:10:46] And uh,
[1:10:49] the one boy had a pretty girlfriend and
[1:10:51] the other boy is basically trying to
[1:10:54] convince her that ditch him. I'm better
[1:10:57] looking and I got more money. I drive a
[1:10:59] better car. Ditch him. This other young
[1:11:02] man got so mad he goes out after this
[1:11:04] young man and all he hits is air.
[1:11:11] and the other kid and it's over. You
[1:11:15] see, you don't fight the good fight
[1:11:17] going out screaming, "Devil, I bind you.
[1:11:20] I'm a Christian. I'm a believer of the
[1:11:22] message. I'm a No, that's
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And then the devil will come and
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; and it's over. Then you go to church and
[1:11:31] say, "Pastor, I don't know what went
[1:11:32] wrong."
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you, you weren't
[1:11:34] fighting the good fight of faith.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. The good fight of faith is
[1:11:38] what? Standing inside the word.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; We get inside the word. We don't have to
[1:11:44] take and start throwing all kinds of
[1:11:46] things at the devil. We can just stand
[1:11:49] there and say,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; "But the word says
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; the word says. The word says. The word
[1:11:56] says,
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; not my pastor says."
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Now, this might hurt some of you, but
[1:12:04] not even the prophet said. That's right.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; You've got to come to the relationship.
[1:12:08] Your position is where the pastor I mean
[1:12:11] the prophet said, "I want to introduce
[1:12:14] you to Jesus Christ." What is that? A
[1:12:16] transfer.
[1:12:18] I've done a few weddings.
[1:12:20] I have yet to go home with the new bride
[1:12:23] and groom.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:30] Yeah. Rebecca said, "Eleaser,
[1:12:33] I've got my Isaac. Come live with us."
[1:12:38] No, she was content that Eleazar brought
[1:12:41] her
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; to her Isaac.
[1:12:44] Amen. Did she have an appreciation? Did
[1:12:46] they have an appreciation for Eleazar?
[1:12:48] Of course. But you see, that wasn't
[1:12:51] Eleazar wasn't saying, "When you build
[1:12:53] the new house, build my suite. I'd like
[1:12:56] a nice master walk-in closet, my own
[1:12:58] kitchenet.
[1:13:00] No, no. Once the introduction is
[1:13:04] completed and I would say that the word
[1:13:06] has come in this hour and has completed
[1:13:08] the introduction and we stand here today
[1:13:11] with a relationship as it is with our
[1:13:13] Isaac.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. With our Lord Jesus Christ. Fight
[1:13:17] the good fight of faith. Lay hold on
[1:13:20] eternal life. Now, I'll tell you this.
[1:13:22] Uh when this thought caught a hold to me
[1:13:25] in my notes, I had that very boldly
[1:13:27] underlined. lay hold on eternal life
[1:13:30] wherein to thou art also called. So this
[1:13:33] is not a whim. This is not just I felt
[1:13:35] like. This is a calling. This is
[1:13:37] something God said, you know, I've
[1:13:38] called you into eternal life. I want you
[1:13:41] to lay hold on to what I've called you.
[1:13:43] I want you to receive it. I want you to
[1:13:45] believe it enough that you're going to
[1:13:47] go out and take a hold of this thing.
[1:13:49] And I'm not going to let go of it. Now,
[1:13:50] this is when the nature of the raccoon
[1:13:53] moves from being stubborn to determined.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] Right? He wouldn't be a raccoon if he
[1:14:01] just said, "Oh, cute." And walked off.
[1:14:04] It's got to have that nature
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; that says, "I got a hold of this thing.
[1:14:08] I'm not letting go."
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; So remember the fine line, the page. One
[1:14:13] side stubborn spirit,
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; the other side determined.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; That's how close these two go.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Together.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; A stubborn spirit will bring you
[1:14:22] trouble. A determined spirit says, "I'm
[1:14:25] not quitting until I make it in the
[1:14:28] rapture." Well, and then you're not
[1:14:30] quitting. It's a fulfillment.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; So, look at this. Lay hold on eternal
[1:14:34] life, where to thou are also called and
[1:14:36] has listened to the preacher say that
[1:14:39] you were called from before the
[1:14:41] foundation of the world. That's right.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; No. No. You professed it.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; You professed it. You stood up on your
[1:14:47] own and said, "You know what? I was in
[1:14:49] him from before the foundation of the
[1:14:51] world. That's who I am. You want to know
[1:14:53] when I became a Christian? Well, it's a
[1:14:55] little farther back than the
[1:14:56] anthropologists can even quite reach.
[1:14:58] You know, it's a few million years. It
[1:15:01] might be. I don't know what it is that
[1:15:03] it's there. There's no way to measure.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; So, you have a good profession, in other
[1:15:11] words, a positive profession before
[1:15:15] many witnesses.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; In other words, not ashamed of the
[1:15:18] gospel.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:20] I give you charge in the sight of God
[1:15:22] who quickenth all things and before
[1:15:24] Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate
[1:15:27] witnessed a good confession. Now
[1:15:29] remember Jesus just had to recent and
[1:15:31] they would have gave him life.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; All he had to have done is said there's
[1:15:36] been a grand mistake.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; He could have defended himself.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; He could have followed Satan's
[1:15:43] suggestion
[1:15:45] and called 10,000 angels.
[1:15:48] And the reason Satan wanted him to call
[1:15:51] those angels
[1:15:52] is because then it would prove that
[1:15:54] Jesus Christ himself and the word in him
[1:15:58] was insufficient.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; In the beginning
[1:16:07] was the word
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; and the word was with God.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And the word was God. Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; He would have had to deny those
[1:16:17] scripture
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; if he was not capable.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And Satan would forever say, "I don't
[1:16:24] care, brother Trevor, if you've got the
[1:16:26] word. I have defeated the word before.
[1:16:30] You've got no security."
[1:16:33] But that's not how it works.
[1:16:36] The word bound Satan.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Satan did not bind the word. They say
[1:16:42] there was a failure on Jesus' part that
[1:16:44] he was crucified.
[1:16:45] I say today it was the absolute
[1:16:48] fulfillment of the perfect word.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where would we be today if he had
[1:16:53] chose to walk free?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'd be here today just like our
[1:16:58] government. You notice the government
[1:16:59] never says the government's debt is
[1:17:01] trillions. The government breaks it down
[1:17:03] and says, "You as citizens of the United
[1:17:05] States now owe $39,64210
[1:17:11] a piece." I'm sorry I didn't sign for
[1:17:14] that and I have no obligation to pay
[1:17:17] that. And so you see how Satan's
[1:17:20] constantly trying to put that issue back
[1:17:23] on the individual.
[1:17:25] But Jesus said, "Nope, I will pay the
[1:17:28] price." Do you realize I'm going to go
[1:17:30] off track for just a moment, okay? But
[1:17:32] do you realize there's actually
[1:17:34] something invading the nominal Christian
[1:17:36] church now? That men stand in the pulpit
[1:17:39] in their churches and make statements
[1:17:42] like the blood is no longer sufficient.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to know what is.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; If the blood is not sufficient, what is
[1:17:52] going to cover?
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; There's nothing out there. That's right.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Not knowledge,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; not ideas of man.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; If it's not the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; we're doomed.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; So, let me put it this way, and it
[1:18:09] sounds blunt. The man who's making that
[1:18:12] statement's got an evil spirit on him.
[1:18:14] That's not a Holy Ghost-filled minister
[1:18:17] of the gospel. That's a demon
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; preaching a demon's gospel.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That the blood is no longer sufficient.
[1:18:24] So people will trust in the church. Now
[1:18:27] if you want to know where I why I say
[1:18:29] that, I'll put it to you this way.
[1:18:31] Because the word in this day has to be
[1:18:34] fulfilled
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; and they have to make the word of God to
[1:18:38] none effect. It has to happen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; So they're in church believing they're
[1:18:44] worshiping God, but the blood's no
[1:18:45] longer sufficient. But our church is
[1:18:47] good. We'll believe in the church.
[1:18:51] They have to make the word of God to
[1:18:53] none effect.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Scriptural prophecy.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me stay on track.
[1:19:03] that that thou keep this commandment
[1:19:05] without spot, unrebukeable until the
[1:19:07] appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:19:09] which in his times he shall show, who is
[1:19:11] the blessed and only potentate, the King
[1:19:14] of Kings and Lord of Lords, who only
[1:19:18] hath immortality, dwelleth in the light,
[1:19:20] which no man can approach into, whom no
[1:19:23] man hath seen, nor can see, to whom be
[1:19:26] honor and power ever and everlasting.
[1:19:29] Amen. charge them that are rich in this
[1:19:31] world that they be not high-minded nor
[1:19:35] trust in uncertain riches. So, taking
[1:19:37] this back to our opening scripture, you
[1:19:39] can't trust in your bank account.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go on the internet. I did this
[1:19:44] morning just as a reference. You've got
[1:19:46] a reference over here saying if your
[1:19:48] money is in your sock drawer, inflation
[1:19:50] is eroding it. It's going down. Go take
[1:19:53] it to the bank and earn interest on it
[1:19:55] so you can gain. And then over here on
[1:19:58] the other side is a man saying, "You
[1:20:00] can't trust the bank. We can have
[1:20:02] another great depression and your money
[1:20:04] in the bank will be seized, locked up,
[1:20:07] and you'll never see it again."
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm assuming you all have just
[1:20:11] substantial savings accounts.
[1:20:15] Sock drawer, bank, sock drawer, bank.
[1:20:25] Oh, neither.
[1:20:29] Wow.
[1:20:31] Come on. 1977.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Many a preacher.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Said, "You're not going to take it with
[1:20:40] you. Give it to me."
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Can I interest you guys in a brother
[1:20:49] deal?
[1:20:50] No. You see what the deceiving spirit
[1:20:52] is?
[1:20:54] Why did they care about the money? Why
[1:20:56] did the preacher care about the money?
[1:20:59] Why did the people care about the money?
[1:21:02] It's not about the money.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be lay hold on eternal
[1:21:07] life, saints. We're here today to lay
[1:21:09] hold on eternal life. All the rest of
[1:21:12] this is going to burn up. Going to go
[1:21:14] back into the elements. Amen. And look
[1:21:16] at this here. It says that we're going
[1:21:18] to walk out on the ashes of the wicked.
[1:21:20] And people have this idea. They're going
[1:21:22] to be walking up to our ankles or our
[1:21:24] knees through all of these ashes and ash
[1:21:26] stains everything. My brother and
[1:21:28] sister, do you understand? The fire
[1:21:30] burns everything and releases it back
[1:21:32] into its original element. When you're
[1:21:36] going to walk out on the ashes, it's not
[1:21:37] going to be this ugly ashes and piles
[1:21:40] and stumps everywhere. Everything going
[1:21:43] back to its original element and you're
[1:21:46] going to walk upon it. Amen. See, let's
[1:21:49] not get all caught up in little details
[1:21:51] about how this works. God, let God be in
[1:21:54] control. Let's take hold on eternal
[1:21:56] life. That's our one singular issue we
[1:21:59] need to worry about today. Amen. Is to
[1:22:02] take a hold of that. Amen.
[1:22:05] Trust in uncertain riches, but in the
[1:22:07] living God who giveth us richly all
[1:22:10] things to enjoy, that they do good, that
[1:22:12] they may rich be rich in good works.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm a rich man. Well, I want to be
[1:22:20] anyway.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; I want to live a life of good works.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; So, I want to be a rich man. Anybody
[1:22:26] want to be a rich person today?
[1:22:27] Hallelujah. To be able to have good
[1:22:30] works, be able to fulfill the word of
[1:22:32] God, to to do these things and have the
[1:22:34] word declare you're rich.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Or you could have a million dollars in
[1:22:39] the bank and have the same fate as a
[1:22:41] rich young ruler.
[1:22:44] We get to decide, don't we?
[1:22:47] ready to distribute,
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; my help somebody out,
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; get a better job, work harder, work
[1:22:54] longer,
[1:22:56] eat less.
[1:22:58] No, my brother and sister, sometimes the
[1:23:00] body
[1:23:02] is called to nourish
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; the body.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this sounds morbid. Forgive
[1:23:09] me.
[1:23:10] I don't accept the diabetes diagnosis. I
[1:23:13] believe I'm healed in the name of Jesus
[1:23:15] Christ. That's what the word of God
[1:23:16] says.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; But you know, one of the things that
[1:23:21] really kind of gets you, you know, is
[1:23:23] your body's so connected
[1:23:26] and when you have diabetes and your
[1:23:28] blood sugar is out of control, very
[1:23:30] rarely does a doctor come and say, you
[1:23:32] know what, we're going to cut your ears
[1:23:34] off because you have diabetes.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; But there's a part of your body that
[1:23:38] needs nourish that gets ignored. It's at
[1:23:40] the bottom of the food chain and they
[1:23:43] just cut your feet off and then they cut
[1:23:45] your legs off.
[1:23:47] You see, I want I know this is morbid,
[1:23:49] but I want to drive the point home. I
[1:23:51] want every portion of this body to be
[1:23:53] nourished.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just a select portion of it.
[1:23:57] I'm fine. They cut my legs off. I still
[1:23:59] have hands. No, my brother and sister,
[1:24:02] by the grace of God, we nourish every
[1:24:05] portion of the body of Christ and
[1:24:08] bringing it all into full subjection to
[1:24:10] the word that it's all healthy.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank the Lord for that. We can be
[1:24:16] completely healthy. Amen. Laying us up
[1:24:19] in store for themselves a good
[1:24:21] foundation against the time to come that
[1:24:23] they may lay hold on eternal life. Now,
[1:24:26] unless I'm reading this incorrect,
[1:24:28] everything above this is connected to
[1:24:30] laying hold on eternal life. I've got
[1:24:32] the message. I believe the message. I
[1:24:34] believe every word of the message. I'm
[1:24:36] not going to help them get a better job,
[1:24:38] live on less, turn your thermometer
[1:24:40] down, you know, blah blah blah. I can't
[1:24:42] help it. They have no education. I
[1:24:43] can't. No, my brother and sister. You
[1:24:46] want to lay hold on eternal life. You're
[1:24:48] going to nourish the body.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not talking a welfare state. No,
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; you're not going to buy a brand new car
[1:24:55] and call brother Paul to make the
[1:24:56] payments.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Understand? Let's get that clear so
[1:25:00] nobody misunderstands me. But if you're
[1:25:03] in a situation, we're here. We're part
[1:25:06] of the body. If nothing else, as one
[1:25:09] brother told me one time, people come to
[1:25:10] me, "Brother, I have a need." Almost
[1:25:12] said his name. I have a need. And he's
[1:25:15] like, "I'll pray for your need." They
[1:25:19] were looking
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; for this And he says, "But the prophet
[1:25:24] of God says, the greatest thing I can do
[1:25:25] for you is to pray for you."
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, puts it all in a balance while the
[1:25:31] same brother then went and made their
[1:25:32] house payment.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, let me get back on track. They
[1:25:39] may lay hold on eternal life. Timothy,
[1:25:42] keep that which is committed to thy
[1:25:44] trust, avoiding profane and vain
[1:25:46] babblings and oppositions of science.
[1:25:49] Even in those days there was some
[1:25:51] scientific evidence of things not
[1:25:55] happening or what it would be.
[1:25:58] Amen. So you look at that so-called
[1:26:00] which some professing have aired
[1:26:02] concerning the faith. Grace be with
[1:26:04] thee. Amen. First of Timothy was written
[1:26:07] from Leodysia which is the chiefest city
[1:26:09] of some of those words I can't
[1:26:11] pronounce. So as you look at this my
[1:26:13] brother and sister, we see the
[1:26:15] encouragement that is given that we must
[1:26:18] lay hold on eternal life. Amen. So let's
[1:26:23] not be high-minded. Let's not trust in
[1:26:27] something uncertain. I trust in my own
[1:26:30] knowledge
[1:26:32] in certain things.
[1:26:35] I'll tell you a knowledge I trust in. If
[1:26:39] I lay my thumb on this counter and I hit
[1:26:41] it with a hammer, I can tell you it's
[1:26:45] going to hurt.
[1:26:48] You don't trust me? Come here.
[1:26:52] Yeah. See, we all can understand that
[1:26:54] level right there. But what would it be
[1:26:57] to you if in the service of the Lord
[1:27:02] your hand would be crushed and you felt
[1:27:05] no pain?
[1:27:07] Could you believe that
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; that God would care so much?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Could you believe as it is in the fox's
[1:27:15] book that one could be burnt at the
[1:27:17] stake and praise God as the flames
[1:27:19] consume them?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; See, we serve a supernatural God.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; It's time to lay hold on eternal life
[1:27:26] that we could be fireproof
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; in an age. Amen. Now, look at this. I
[1:27:33] need to hurry.
[1:27:35] Now, maybe I'm making this a little too
[1:27:36] fine of a line today, saints, but I see
[1:27:40] a difference myself between accepting
[1:27:44] and laying hold on.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; You can say here today and say, "I
[1:27:48] believe the message. I believe the
[1:27:51] scripture. I believe
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; accepting."
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:28:00] Such a fine line right there because you
[1:28:03] can say, "No, I I've accepted." But to
[1:28:05] accept it means you fully receive it.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; You don't halfway accept.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; You know, thank you.
[1:28:15] Thank you for the fine gift, but I only
[1:28:18] want half of it. Do you have a saw?
[1:28:21] What kind of nonsense would that be?
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:27] The Lord's going to bless me, but I I'm
[1:28:28] not worthy of a full blessing, so I'm
[1:28:30] just going to accept a half of a
[1:28:31] blessing.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Sounds ludicrous, doesn't it?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; But we do it all the time.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; We do it all the time, saints. I'm not
[1:28:45] being judgmental this morning. I want to
[1:28:46] stir up your pure minds in remembrance.
[1:28:48] We do it all the time. God promises
[1:28:50] great things
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; going to raise us up in heavenly places.
[1:28:53] And we're satisfied just to overcome the
[1:28:55] last issue of our life.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; We're satisfied to overcome our struggle
[1:29:00] at work, our struggle in the family, our
[1:29:02] struggle with children, struggle with
[1:29:04] economics. We're we're satisfied if the
[1:29:06] Lord will just come give me a 25 cent an
[1:29:09] hour. I figured it out. If he gives me a
[1:29:11] 25 cent an hour raise, you know, I I can
[1:29:14] I can make this all work. Or you could
[1:29:16] fully accept the promise of God and
[1:29:19] commit yourself
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; to that promise and then watch God bless
[1:29:23] you. That's
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; I could share story after story of
[1:29:27] people that have shared with me through
[1:29:28] the ages, through the years of how that
[1:29:31] they come to a moment in their life, and
[1:29:33] this is not a prosperity thing I'm
[1:29:35] talking about. It was a commitment
[1:29:37] thing. And they come to a place in their
[1:29:39] life and they're in desperation and they
[1:29:42] finally just was like, "Lord, I got to
[1:29:44] give this to you." and they give their
[1:29:45] whole circumstance to the Lord and in a
[1:29:48] matter of weeks it's completely reversed
[1:29:50] itself and they know they didn't fix it.
[1:29:54] God fixed it.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; But God was waiting. And you'll see here
[1:29:58] in a minute if Paul ever gets going.
[1:30:00] Amen. I'm glad I've got you warmed up
[1:30:02] for the service now.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Now you see, look at this. If we have an
[1:30:07] intellectual understanding versus a real
[1:30:09] solid faith in the word.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can understand in our mind that
[1:30:14] we're healed. But there's quite another
[1:30:17] when we come to the place that we accept
[1:30:20] absolute I'm healed in the name of Jesus
[1:30:23] Christ. This here is lying vanity.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; This here, my brother and sister, is
[1:30:29] nothing more than a lying vanity. The
[1:30:32] word says. And when you can fully accept
[1:30:35] that the word is what is correct and not
[1:30:37] the lying vanity, then you're moving
[1:30:40] forward from just acknowledging the word
[1:30:42] says he's your healer. Amen. So there's
[1:30:45] a difference. Intellectual understanding
[1:30:48] versus real solid faith. Something makes
[1:30:50] sense versus
[1:30:54] all senses are surrendered to.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that makes sense. How about you
[1:31:01] just surrender it all
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; to that and let God fulfill that?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; A difference between acknowledgement and
[1:31:09] action.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, years ago, sorry, I
[1:31:13] don't mean to take so long, but years
[1:31:15] ago, we we had uh some guys uh come out
[1:31:18] to the farm and they were we were
[1:31:20] growing a specialty seedbean and the
[1:31:23] company wanted every last weed out of
[1:31:25] the field.
[1:31:26] So, we had a tractor with a a rack on
[1:31:28] the back and one of the one of the guys
[1:31:31] says, "Hey, I'll drive the tractor." And
[1:31:33] we're like, "You know how to drive a
[1:31:34] tractor?" "Yeah, I know how to drive a
[1:31:36] tractor. Anybody can drive a tractor."
[1:31:39] He goes, gets on the tractor. He started
[1:31:41] it. Does not push in the clutch.
[1:31:48] What's wrong with this tractor?
[1:31:51] You see, my brother and sister, just
[1:31:52] because you say you understand,
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; doesn't mean you can put it into action.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And it's no good to you until you can
[1:32:02] put it into action.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lay hold on eternal life. Yes.
[1:32:07] Yes. That's what I'm do. I believe the
[1:32:09] message.
[1:32:10] There's a lot of difference between
[1:32:12] believing the message and laying hold on
[1:32:14] eternal life.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Are we okay?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Genesis 32:es 21-31.
[1:32:22] Uh, so we look at that. Um,
[1:32:27] we're now talking about Jacob to drive
[1:32:29] home a few points and and just pray the
[1:32:31] Lord will help me be very concise here.
[1:32:34] Um,
[1:32:35] so Jacob's there and and uh he's he's
[1:32:39] coming he's going home as it were. Amen.
[1:32:42] Just like we're going home. He's coming
[1:32:44] home. and uh he knows that he's done
[1:32:47] some things. His surppler nature has got
[1:32:51] him in a little bit of trouble. His own
[1:32:54] father-in-law,
[1:32:55] you know, threw the stick in the water,
[1:32:59] swindles him out of a a a bunch of
[1:33:01] cattle, uh the whole issue. But he had
[1:33:04] justification.
[1:33:06] Anybody votes for Jacob? Yeah.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; After all, he got deceived out of the
[1:33:11] girl he loved
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; and had to marry her very pretty sister.
[1:33:16] But he didn't love that sister as much
[1:33:18] as he loved his wife.
[1:33:22] And so
[1:33:24] I'm justified
[1:33:26] to taking a sharp stick to my
[1:33:28] father-in-law
[1:33:30] because he deceived me. So I'm going to
[1:33:32] deceive him.
[1:33:36] They offended me so I can offend them.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; They did this to me so I can do this to
[1:33:43] them.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Sound like a human thing.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let go of it.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Let go of it.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; So now he's moving. I want to just kind
[1:33:56] of preach this scripture out. Be on the
[1:33:57] screen there if you would, uh, Brother
[1:33:59] Isaac, and just scroll it forward. Now
[1:34:01] look at that. He comes and he's afraid
[1:34:03] that when he sees his brother
[1:34:06] that it's going to be trouble. He's
[1:34:09] already in his mind thinking he's going
[1:34:10] to, you know, take the women, young
[1:34:13] daughters, the animals. He's going to
[1:34:15] kill the young men. He's going to just
[1:34:17] do all this trouble. He He's going to
[1:34:20] get vengeance on me for what I did years
[1:34:22] ago. And what I'm going to do is I'm
[1:34:24] going to split my flock up here in these
[1:34:25] pieces and I'm going to start sending
[1:34:27] peace offerings to him. I'm going to I'm
[1:34:30] going to, you know, cuz after all, money
[1:34:32] fixes everything
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; except relationships and friendships and
[1:34:38] spiritual relationships.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Money won't work on those.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; And so, he's doing all this stuff and no
[1:34:46] peace comes.
[1:34:48] He's concerned. So, he's got his wife,
[1:34:50] he's got all of his his family, he's got
[1:34:52] all this stuff. And finally he's like,
[1:34:55] "Huh, he's coming closer and closer and
[1:34:57] closer. What am I going to do?"
[1:35:01] So he realizes, you know what? It's not
[1:35:03] my wife, not my children, not my
[1:35:06] handmmaids that he doesn't have any axe
[1:35:08] to grind with them. I'm going to
[1:35:11] separate them off. See how God works?
[1:35:17] He is doing the separating
[1:35:21] by a carnal reasoning.
[1:35:25] Understand?
[1:35:27] Vengeance. I'll separate myself and if
[1:35:29] he chooses to exert vengeance, it'll
[1:35:32] just be on me. Not upon my wife, not
[1:35:34] upon my children.
[1:35:37] God had another plan. Anybody had your
[1:35:39] plan and then God had his plan.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love it that God's got a
[1:35:44] plan that's not absolutely connected to
[1:35:47] our plan? Our plan's got all this. Now,
[1:35:49] if I say this, they'll say this. If I do
[1:35:51] this, they'll do that. And then I'll do
[1:35:52] this, and I'll do that. And if they get
[1:35:54] rowdy, I if I get them in a headlock
[1:35:56] first.
[1:35:58] Yeah.
[1:36:00] And then they'll be like, I just wanted
[1:36:01] to come talk to you. Oh. Oh, you wanted
[1:36:06] to have a Bible study with me and just,
[1:36:09] "Yeah, I realized I was wrong.
[1:36:14] You thought you were wrong.
[1:36:17] I knew I was wrong, but you think you're
[1:36:19] wrong. No. Don't let the devil get in
[1:36:22] your head. Okay?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; There shouldn't be four or five rooms in
[1:36:25] your head. Amen. Should be just one
[1:36:28] space. Your brain God so possesses that.
[1:36:31] So it comes, they all go. Jacob's alone.
[1:36:37] Do you see it?
[1:36:39] God wants us
[1:36:42] alone.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Doesn't want a crowd.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Doesn't need you and the pastor.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Doesn't need you and the husband or wife
[1:36:52] or best friend. Doesn't need you and the
[1:36:54] theologian or the smartest person you
[1:36:57] ever went to school with. Doesn't need
[1:36:58] you with anybody. He wants you alone.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; And so here he is. Poor old Jacob, man.
[1:37:07] He's going in this throws he's just oh
[1:37:09] what am I going to do and here is an
[1:37:11] individual comes there
[1:37:14] and however it comes about they get in a
[1:37:16] wrestling match and something we would
[1:37:21] call it revelation starts to come and so
[1:37:24] he sends them verse 23 over the brook
[1:37:26] and they go he's left alone and there at
[1:37:30] that place he wrestles with a man until
[1:37:32] the breaking of the day now this is
[1:37:34] quite a wrestling match it's like why is
[1:37:37] he anointed to wrestle with this. My
[1:37:40] brother and sister, we should all have
[1:37:41] spiritual discernment to understand why
[1:37:43] the wrestling match took place.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it wasn't collective. He had
[1:37:47] no Amen. Now, Jacob would have had his
[1:37:51] own group of strong young men that were
[1:37:53] willing to fight, but he had sent them
[1:37:55] away with the peace offering.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; He had all these people that would have
[1:37:59] stood up for Jacob. He's justified.
[1:38:01] Don't you get your hands off it. They
[1:38:03] were all sent away. There was no sorry
[1:38:06] sisters, no wives to say, "Leave my
[1:38:08] husband alone
[1:38:14] by himself."
[1:38:16] And here comes an angel of the Lord
[1:38:18] comes down and he starts to wrestle with
[1:38:21] him.
[1:38:24] Well, I pray every day. I try to at
[1:38:27] least give the Lord a couple minutes.
[1:38:30] Break in a pie chart.
[1:38:33] be a little line.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; And that will be your day. No, my
[1:38:38] brother and sister, you see, he wrestles
[1:38:42] all night long.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; This was a real travail, a real struggle
[1:38:49] that he was in. He wrestles all night
[1:38:52] long. So much so, the angel says, "Hey,
[1:38:55] uh the breaking of the day and and when
[1:38:58] he sees, you know, that he uh uh is not
[1:39:01] going to prevail." Now, pardon me.
[1:39:04] There's different uh different uh
[1:39:06] opinions on exactly what it was, but the
[1:39:09] angel touches him here in the hip or
[1:39:12] groin region and he is immediately
[1:39:15] crippled.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; So, when he touches him, he immediately
[1:39:21] is now at a handicap and it should be
[1:39:23] time to say uncle and and be done. But
[1:39:27] Jacob is now, you see what's happening,
[1:39:30] my brother and sister? He's moving from
[1:39:32] the suppler
[1:39:34] to the one who has met God.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And when he got determined to meet God,
[1:39:40] he was no longer the give up easy kind
[1:39:44] of person.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; I tried serving God. I prayed that the
[1:39:47] Lord would do this and the Lord would do
[1:39:49] that and he didn't do it. So, I just
[1:39:51] quit. I don't even know if there is a
[1:39:52] God. I couldn't tell you. I've got a
[1:39:55] list of people who have told me such
[1:39:57] that I tried to serve God, but he never
[1:39:59] answered my prayer. He never answered it
[1:40:01] like you wanted it answered. He never
[1:40:04] answered it in the timing that you
[1:40:06] wanted it be like. Lord, let it be
[1:40:08] yesterday. Amen. And let it be just like
[1:40:11] this, this, and this. But look at Jacob
[1:40:13] now. Still Jacob at this moment. His
[1:40:16] name is Serpliner, but he's losing that.
[1:40:20] It's falling away from him. the
[1:40:23] challenge and the care of life and the
[1:40:26] struggle is falling away from him and
[1:40:28] he's coming to a place I want God to
[1:40:31] bless me.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen this morning? I
[1:40:35] want God to bless me
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to keep holding on. I'm
[1:40:40] going to keep wrestling until he blesses
[1:40:42] me. And the angel of the Lord touches
[1:40:45] him there and his thigh is growing and
[1:40:48] he's now crippled. That is something he
[1:40:50] carried the rest of his life. the rest
[1:40:52] of his life in a physical element. He
[1:40:55] had a He walked with this limp, my
[1:40:58] brother and sister. And when that took
[1:41:01] place and he did not give up, the angel
[1:41:04] come. Amen. And he said unto him, "What
[1:41:07] is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And
[1:41:10] he said, "Thy name shall be called no
[1:41:12] more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince
[1:41:16] hath power with God and with men, and
[1:41:19] hast prevailed." Amen. And what did God
[1:41:21] do? He come and he gave him a new name.
[1:41:24] Now, I'm not making a doctrine, so
[1:41:26] nobody misunderstand me here, but the
[1:41:28] scripture in Revelation says that we'll
[1:41:30] be given a new name. And I'm telling
[1:41:32] you, if you make a connection through
[1:41:35] scripture, it's only going to be those
[1:41:37] that wrestled with the angel all night
[1:41:40] long that are going to get a new name.
[1:41:42] It's not going to be the guy. I believe
[1:41:44] I believe I believe my brother and
[1:41:47] sister, you're going to have to get a
[1:41:48] hold of the angel of the Lord, the word.
[1:41:51] And you're going to have to wrestle all
[1:41:52] the way through. And when you prevail,
[1:41:55] not when you say, "I tried." Not when
[1:41:58] you say, "It's too hard. Not when you
[1:42:00] say, "I don't understand." Pray for
[1:42:02] revelation. Amen. You pray for
[1:42:04] revelation. God will give you
[1:42:06] revelation. But he prays. Amen. He's
[1:42:08] holding on to this angel wrestling.
[1:42:11] Amen. Probably trying to remember now.
[1:42:13] He's got a hold of me this way. If I can
[1:42:15] get my hand slipped around like this, I
[1:42:17] can get him into this and I can do that.
[1:42:20] And it just go went on and on and on and
[1:42:22] on and on and it's there, my brother and
[1:42:25] sister. Or was it the kind of wrestling
[1:42:28] we think?
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; We have it. An angel and a grown man
[1:42:34] wallowing in the dirt.
[1:42:42] Well, praise God. I known a few men in
[1:42:45] the past
[1:42:49] stood me right in the foyer of a church
[1:42:54] and said, "I should break your knee."
[1:42:59] And why would you do that? Cuz you don't
[1:43:01] agree with our pastor.
[1:43:07] At least till I can get out the door,
[1:43:08] I'm going to agree. Okay.
[1:43:11] No. Is that the right spirit?
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Wrong motive, wrong objective, wrong
[1:43:16] presentation. Now, you wonder why I
[1:43:19] bring that up. I want to tie this
[1:43:20] around. You're going to take that 25,
[1:43:23] 30, 40 years ago.
[1:43:25] Deacon representing the pastor
[1:43:28] said, "I'm going to break your leg for
[1:43:30] you, your knee for you. It's why I don't
[1:43:32] go to church anymore.
[1:43:41] Really? You're going to let one knad?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Keep you from laying hold on eternal
[1:43:48] life.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; One absolutely
[1:43:52] anointed of the devil individual was all
[1:43:56] Satan had to insert.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Into your life.
[1:44:02] And you're done.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; If there's a counterfeit out there,
[1:44:08] there's true. That's right.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. If someone with the wrong spirit
[1:44:12] approaches you and they are rude and
[1:44:14] they are mean and they are all these
[1:44:16] things that we just
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; forget that. Let go.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Go start searching. Lord,
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; if there's a counterfeit here, where's
[1:44:24] the real, Lord?
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a real here. Show me
[1:44:28] the real. There's a real word out here.
[1:44:30] If there's a false word out here,
[1:44:32] there's a real word out here, Lord. And
[1:44:34] I'm going to lay hands lay holds on
[1:44:36] eternal life. Point me to the real. Give
[1:44:39] me an angel. Give me a representation.
[1:44:42] You see what that angel was? He wasn't
[1:44:44] there of his own accord. He was a scent
[1:44:47] emissary of God himself. So you
[1:44:50] understand this when it says that Jacob
[1:44:52] met God face to face and live. You see
[1:44:54] that angel was an absolute living
[1:44:57] representation just the same as this
[1:45:00] Bible is a living representation of
[1:45:03] Jesus Christ today. Amen. When you get
[1:45:06] in this word and you pray for revelation
[1:45:08] and God speaks to you, you can actually
[1:45:11] make the statement, I've met God face to
[1:45:14] face. I met him right here in his word.
[1:45:17] And this is him in his word. It's not an
[1:45:21] interpretation. It's not an abstract
[1:45:24] something that was presented. It is him
[1:45:26] himself. Which means if you believe
[1:45:28] this, you believe him. And when you
[1:45:30] speak to the word, Amen. the word speaks
[1:45:32] back to you. Can someone say amen? And
[1:45:35] we know that that is God speaking to us.
[1:45:38] It's not a preacher. It's not this man
[1:45:40] or not that man. It's God speaking to
[1:45:43] you.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; If you look only as far as a man, you
[1:45:47] will see men.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the problem. You look
[1:45:50] just as far and it goes right down into
[1:45:52] our relationships, marriages, and
[1:45:54] friendships and everything. If all you
[1:45:57] see is what's wrong, that's all you will
[1:45:59] see. that if you'll look beyond that and
[1:46:01] let go and say, "Lord, come and fix my
[1:46:05] situation." And then look what followed.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Jacob now goes and meets Esau. And he
[1:46:12] comes to him a humbled man. That's
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; No longer walking like the bandy
[1:46:17] rooster,
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; but he comes.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Something changed in Esau.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; He had compassion.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; He had understanding.
[1:46:30] Because you see, God dealt with Esau
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; while he was dealing with Jacob.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; I knew a brother. He said, "I I got to
[1:46:39] the point I hated to go to work." He
[1:46:42] said, "I was like a little kid having a
[1:46:43] nervous breakdown on a day for testing
[1:46:45] at school."
[1:46:48] And he said, "Lord, there's no other
[1:46:50] jobs. I mean, like, there's zero jobs
[1:46:52] around here. If I leave this job, I'm
[1:46:54] unemployed.
[1:46:56] Lord, what do I do?
[1:46:59] No praise to the pastor, but a pastor's
[1:47:01] there on a Sunday and drives home. You
[1:47:04] need to change your situation.
[1:47:06] Tell me about it, but expect God to
[1:47:08] answer your prayer.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; That's okay, right? Sympathetic ear
[1:47:13] here,
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; but the only thing that's going to
[1:47:14] change your circumstance is God.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. That's right.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; He gets to praying about it.
[1:47:20] And then one day, the same man who's
[1:47:22] persecuting him
[1:47:25] comes and says, "Remember that time you
[1:47:27] tried to give me that book of your
[1:47:29] religion,
[1:47:30] he's on the defense."
[1:47:33] Yeah. Well, what about it?
[1:47:36] I finally read it.
[1:47:40] Can I get more?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I read the other books you gave me. Can
[1:47:47] I come to your church?
[1:47:52] I come to your church a few times. You
[1:47:54] think somebody like me that your pastor
[1:47:56] would baptize them?
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Do you think someone like me could
[1:48:01] actually receive the Holy Ghost?
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister
[1:48:08] or we can fight fire with fire
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; and we can declare that the guy is just
[1:48:15] a devil.
[1:48:20] How come you guys are so quiet?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; You don't look sleepy.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; What are we doing?
[1:48:30] Do you realize that when you lay hold on
[1:48:33] eternal life?
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Of all the people in this room that
[1:48:36] should know, Brother Luke would know cuz
[1:48:38] he works with high voltage. Brother
[1:48:40] Luke, what happens if I come down here
[1:48:43] and you are 440 and I grab you?
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Can I Can I?
[1:48:50] And the only smoke coming out of my ears
[1:48:52] is my brain cooking and I can't let go.
[1:48:57] Do you realize what God's doing?
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; When you get a hold of eternal life
[1:49:05] and then God leads you to reach out and
[1:49:07] get a hold of someone,
[1:49:10] what do you do? You become a conduit.
[1:49:15] It's not you.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; You get a hold of eternal life. God
[1:49:19] might be using you. You'll receive your
[1:49:21] reward. Let's forget about this pay me
[1:49:23] in advance thing.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; You know, Lord, do you do you do Vimo or
[1:49:27] whatever that is? No. But I want to be a
[1:49:30] conduit. I'll tell you right now, my
[1:49:31] brother and sister, I'm speaking from my
[1:49:33] heart. I don't want to stand here. I
[1:49:34] don't need recognition. I don't need
[1:49:36] accolades. I don't need nothing. But I
[1:49:38] want to be a conduit. I want to be a
[1:49:40] conduit to each one of you, especially
[1:49:42] young people. my heart. I want to be a
[1:49:44] conduit, but I can't be a conduit if I
[1:49:48] don't have a halt of anything.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; But if I ever get a hold of Jesus
[1:49:52] Christ, I can be a conduit. He can work
[1:49:56] through me.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; And then I have nothing to boast
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; other than to say, "Thank you, Lord,
[1:50:03] that
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; you saw fit to use me."
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; And to be able to help someone else see.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. You see my brother and
[1:50:11] sister. I want to close right here.
[1:50:13] Sister Vika, would you come? Otherwise,
[1:50:15] I got equivalent about two or three more
[1:50:17] pages here.
[1:50:19] And uh so you be no more called Jacob,
[1:50:23] but Israel.
[1:50:24] Amen.
[1:50:27] I want to know someday it'll be revealed
[1:50:31] what our new name is. We can speculate
[1:50:33] here. We can say it's going to be Jesus
[1:50:36] Christ, Mrs. Jesus Christ. We can put
[1:50:37] all kinds of different things. But I
[1:50:39] tell you what I want to do. I want to
[1:50:41] hear him say
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; my new name.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to hear him declare to me
[1:50:48] what my new name is. So to do that, I've
[1:50:51] got to lay hold on eternal life to make
[1:50:54] it there to be that one to do. And you
[1:50:57] know, sometimes we'll find out that we
[1:51:00] had more impact on someone than we ever
[1:51:05] dreamed we would. Another little story
[1:51:08] I'll share with you. Back east, there
[1:51:11] was a minister, small church,
[1:51:14] I think I have it tough sometimes
[1:51:16] working, but this pastor worked the
[1:51:19] graveyard shift in a sighting vinyl
[1:51:22] sighting factory.
[1:51:24] He worked he chose the graveyard shift
[1:51:26] because that allowed him to preach
[1:51:27] Sundays and Wednesdays and he went in at
[1:51:31] I don't know it was like 11:00 at night.
[1:51:33] So, he didn't certainly have any long
[1:51:34] Wednesday night services, but you know
[1:51:36] what I mean? He he just, you know, but
[1:51:38] he'd preach and then he'd just go home
[1:51:40] and go to work. And he worked with this
[1:51:43] man.
[1:51:45] And uh they're working at this station
[1:51:49] making sure the machine didn't clog up,
[1:51:51] just spitting out sheets of vinyl
[1:51:53] siding. It's pretty much your job. You
[1:51:56] stood there like that all night long and
[1:51:58] washed the siding.
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:02] And this man,
[1:52:05] he asked this guy working with him, "Are
[1:52:08] you a Christian?"
[1:52:10] And the guy told him, "If I want to talk
[1:52:11] religion, I would talk religion. I don't
[1:52:14] want to hear it."
[1:52:16] That ain't what I ask you. I ask you if
[1:52:18] you were a Christian.
[1:52:20] No, I'm not a Christian. Well, I'm not
[1:52:23] going to tell you what you should do,
[1:52:24] but you should be.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Don't you just love how God gives a
[1:52:27] boldness to him?
[1:52:29] Six months of that. Now I get to hear
[1:52:33] the other side. Huh? So it gives away
[1:52:35] the story. The other brother has hands
[1:52:38] like dinner plates. And he said, "I
[1:52:41] can't tell you how many times about 2:00
[1:52:44] in the morning, I wanted to reach over
[1:52:46] and grab that guy by the neck and just
[1:52:50] throttle him." But there was something
[1:52:54] that wouldn't let me. And there was
[1:52:56] something told me this is true. Amen.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And what it was, he just
[1:53:02] wore me down.
[1:53:05] He wore me down until I was like, "Okay,
[1:53:07] if you got something special, then tell
[1:53:09] me why it's special." And he starts
[1:53:12] preaching to him. And he said, "And now
[1:53:15] the minister brother says, "Oh, you'd be
[1:53:17] surprised how quick an 8 hour shift can
[1:53:19] go when you're preaching.
[1:53:24] You guys are like, "That was a two-hour
[1:53:26] service." And the preacher's like,
[1:53:27] "Where did that 10 minutes go?"
[1:53:31] Ultimately, he gives his heart to the
[1:53:32] Lord. Now, my brother and sister, there
[1:53:36] is the conduit. One has laid hold on
[1:53:39] eternal life, and he's looking for
[1:53:41] someone else that he can pass it
[1:53:44] through. Pass it to. Now, I want to know
[1:53:48] Jacob becoming Israel.
[1:53:51] God blessed, right? That's what the word
[1:53:53] says. I'm closing.
[1:53:56] and he walked with a
[1:54:00] the rest
[1:54:02] of his life.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Who wants that kind of blessing?
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; That's what it took
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; for Jacob to receive the blessing he was
[1:54:16] looking for.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; When God touched him, it left him marked
[1:54:22] forever.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, just bless my bank account.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Just bless my deal. Bless this. Bless
[1:54:31] that. No, I don't want to have to give
[1:54:33] up what I've got. Just bless me.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; But God would like something in
[1:54:38] exchange. Now, don't misunderstand what
[1:54:39] I'm saying.
[1:54:42] He just wants you.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; There's your sacrifice. He just wants
[1:54:49] you.
[1:54:51] Amen. I want I want that kind of
[1:54:56] blessing. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:55:00] Let me beat you to the punch. Oh, I
[1:55:02] didn't. Okay, man. I've got so much more
[1:55:04] here, saints. I tell you, I would just
[1:55:08] love to share it this morning. But
[1:55:10] someday I'll actually I'll actually be
[1:55:13] able to stay in high gear and not get
[1:55:16] distracted. Let's stand. Worship the
[1:55:18] Lord. Amen.
[1:55:20] Hallelujah. You love the Lord today.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Just like to hear it out of your voice.
[1:55:24] Yes, we do. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:55:30] [Music]
[1:55:33] When Jacob met the Lord
[1:55:36] upon that lonely night
[1:55:39] and wrestled there alone
[1:55:43] until the morning light, he won a
[1:55:47] princely title to gird him for the
[1:55:51] right.
[1:55:53] I want that kind of blessing.
[1:55:59] Oh, I want I want that kind of blessing
[1:56:06] that saves and keeps. Oh, satisfies the
[1:56:12] soul. I want I want
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; salvation
[1:56:20] to
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; of heaven war.
[1:56:27] Israel at last came into Canaan's land.
[1:56:33] The Lord his riches gave so full on
[1:56:38] every hand. He drove their foes before
[1:56:42] them and dwelt a happy band. I want that
[1:56:48] kind of blessing.
[1:56:53] I want I want that kind of blessing
[1:57:00] that saves and keeps and satisfies my
[1:57:05] soul.
[1:57:06] I want I want that full salvation
[1:57:13] till
[1:57:15] of heaven or me roll.
[1:57:20] This is the day of grace. The comforter
[1:57:24] is here. We are a chosen race. Our God
[1:57:30] is drawing near. He's waiting to be
[1:57:35] gracious. The prayer of faith to hear
[1:57:39] and then he'll send the blessing.
[1:57:45] Oh, I want I want that kind of blessing
[1:57:53] that saves and keeps. Oh, satisfies the
[1:57:58] soul. I want I want
[1:58:03] of salvation
[1:58:06] till the lose of heaven or me.
[1:58:12] Hallelujah. Now I'd like to put
[1:58:13] something out to you. You got a loved
[1:58:15] one, husband, a wife, a child, a parent
[1:58:18] that's not serving God. Got something in
[1:58:20] their life. Got addictions. We got
[1:58:22] witness right here in this assembly of
[1:58:25] God taking addictions away in a
[1:58:27] heartbeat. Amen. We've got right here in
[1:58:30] this assembly the witness of God coming
[1:58:32] and delivering from spirits and things
[1:58:35] that are taking place. And now my
[1:58:37] brother and sister, you got a loved one,
[1:58:39] you want to see them saved.
[1:58:42] Don't let go.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Don't let go.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray for them occasionally.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; I pray for them a little bit. My brother
[1:58:53] and sister, Jacob could have stopped and
[1:58:55] said, "U, let's take a break here. I'm
[1:58:57] tired.
[1:58:58] I've heard so many, now this might bite
[1:59:00] some of you, but I've heard so many
[1:59:01] people say, "I can't do this and this
[1:59:04] for the Lord because I just don't have
[1:59:06] the strength." I want to ask you, have
[1:59:08] you prayed for strength?
[1:59:11] God will answer your prayer when you
[1:59:14] will pray for strength. Amen. You need
[1:59:17] healing. Don't just say, "Well, my
[1:59:19] symptoms are worse today than they were
[1:59:21] yesterday." My brother and sister, do
[1:59:23] not let go. God said, "I've healed you.
[1:59:27] You believe it. Amen. You claim it. You
[1:59:31] stand on that." And I tell you, my
[1:59:33] brother and sister, these many things
[1:59:35] that Satan has used to bind us will fall
[1:59:39] away if we will come in real faith.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. This is the day of
[1:59:46] grace.
[1:59:54] We earth is going near.
[1:59:58] He's wanting to be gracious. The prayer
[2:00:02] of faith to hear
[2:00:05] and then he'll send the blessing. Let's
[2:00:09] sing that whole verse. Go back. This is
[2:00:12] the day of grace. The comforter is here.
[2:00:18] We are a chosen race. Our God is drawing
[2:00:24] near.
[2:00:25] He's waiting to be gracious to hear the
[2:00:33] he'll send a blessing.
[2:00:38] I
[2:00:40] want my kind of blessing that seeks and
[2:00:47] keeps or satisfies my soul. I want I
[2:00:53] want at full salvation
[2:00:58] tillers
[2:01:00] of heaven all the earth.
[2:01:04] Can we just give a little praise
[2:01:05] offering to the Lord? Hallelujah.
[2:01:09] Lord, help us.
[2:01:12] Hallelujah. Help us, Lord, to just let
[2:01:14] go. Get everything out of our hands. Be
[2:01:17] able to lay hold on eternal life.
[2:01:20] Hallelujah. 8:35 if you would, Brother
[2:01:23] Isaac. Hallelujah.
[2:01:26] Amen.
[2:01:30] F.
[2:01:34] Holy words,
[2:01:37] long prisoner
[2:01:39] [Music]

[2:01:50] with God's own heart.
[2:01:54] Oh, let the word of God impart.
[2:02:01] Words of life,
[2:02:05] words of hope.
[2:02:08] Oh, give us strength.

[2:02:56] Holy words

[2:03:16] The faithful words of Christ.

[2:03:33] in this world.
[2:03:36] They resound

[2:03:43] Let the word of God impart.
[2:03:50] Word of God.
[2:03:52] Oh, believe it saints.

[2:03:59] He's changing you.
[2:04:04] We have come
[2:04:06] with
[2:04:08] hearts.
[2:04:10] Let the word of God impart.
[2:04:17] Word of God
[2:04:21] ever true
[2:04:24] changing me.
[2:04:27] He's changing you.
[2:04:30] Oh, we have come
[2:04:34] with open hearts.
[2:04:37] Oh, let the word of God above all.
[2:04:44] Amen. Verse one.
[2:04:48] Holy words
[2:04:51] long preserved
[2:04:55] for our walk
[2:04:58] in this world.
[2:05:02] laying sound
[2:05:05] with God's own heart.
[2:05:08] Oh, let the word of God
[2:05:12] in part. Look at this. Words of life,
[2:05:19] words of hope.
[2:05:22] Give us strength.
[2:05:25] Oh Lord, help us go home.
[2:05:29] In this world
[2:05:33] where we're wrong,
[2:05:36] a word of God will guide us home.
[2:05:43] All words of life,
[2:05:47] words of hope,
[2:05:50] changing me,
[2:05:54] changing you
[2:05:57] will
[2:06:01] arise.
[2:06:03] Oh, let the word of God.
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:10] That's all right. Hallelujah.
[2:06:12] Amen. They didn't read my mind.
[2:06:15] Hallelujah.
[2:06:17] Saints, I pray today maybe something
[2:06:20] just touched your heart.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time for us to let go of
[2:06:26] every little petty thing Satan's placed
[2:06:29] in our way.
[2:06:31] We're human. Don't think that I'm
[2:06:34] judging you. We're human.
[2:06:37] But let's not be the little raccoon
[2:06:41] that just won't let go of it. Let it go.
[2:06:45] You see, I don't mean to go on
[2:06:47] preaching, but you see what Satan's
[2:06:50] doing.
[2:06:51] When we take a halt of these things and
[2:06:54] we can't let go of them, our spiritual
[2:06:57] growth stops
[2:07:00] right there. Cuz that little will
[2:07:04] starve to death
[2:07:06] over that shiny little lid.
[2:07:10] His growth stopped right there.
[2:07:13] Let go and let God have his way in your
[2:07:17] life.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand? I just study and
[2:07:21] brother Brandham speaks about this. some
[2:07:24] spots direct, some spots in reference.
[2:07:28] But that's what Satan's job is to stop
[2:07:31] you from feeding on the word of God,
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; to stop you from growing spiritually.
[2:07:39] He'll do anything he can do
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; to get you to stop,
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; to come to a standill.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; That's it. If I could plead with you,
[2:07:52] if that's too strong a words, if I could
[2:07:54] ask you
[2:07:56] emphatically,
[2:07:58] let go.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; And take hold.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; On eternal life.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:12] Lord, help us to conquer this human
[2:08:14] side,
[2:08:16] to let go of everything that keeps us
[2:08:20] from laying hold on eternal life.
[2:08:25] Lord, come. So many things. We are so
[2:08:28] complex Lord.
[2:08:30] But you being the one who created us,
[2:08:33] you know how to take those complexes,
[2:08:37] the complexity of the human nature
[2:08:41] and to take those things from bad
[2:08:44] and turn it to good.
[2:08:46] To take those things that would hinder
[2:08:49] and bring it to us for a great spurt of
[2:08:54] spiritual growth. Lord, I lift my own
[2:08:57] hands. Father, help me. Lord, let go of
[2:09:01] myself and cling only to you. Lord,
[2:09:06] deal kindly, Father, just as you discern
[2:09:09] the heart of the rich young ruler.
[2:09:12] Lord, may you come and discern our
[2:09:14] hearts and speak to us the words of
[2:09:17] life,
[2:09:19] words of encouragement, words of hope.
[2:09:22] for your word has long been preserved
[2:09:25] and restored back to its original
[2:09:29] condition for us in this day.
[2:09:32] We ask this
[2:09:34] from the deepest of our heart.
[2:09:38] Lord, grant to us, Father,
[2:09:41] the Saints of Grace tabernacle,
[2:09:44] a time,
[2:09:46] not a a limited time, but a time of
[2:09:50] spiritual growth. Father, as we lay hold
[2:09:54] on his eternal life and we let go of
[2:09:58] this world, bless the saints and their
[2:10:00] patience today. Lord, I pray be with
[2:10:03] them, lead them, guide them. Father,
[2:10:07] I would be so bold to say, Father,
[2:10:09] please Lord,
[2:10:12] directly lay upon their hearts those
[2:10:14] things that need let go of and bring
[2:10:18] healing and restoration
[2:10:20] in every one of our lives in the name of
[2:10:23] Jesus Christ.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
[2:10:28] Oh, thank
[2:10:30] you Lord
[2:10:32] for saving
[2:10:35] my soul.
[2:10:39] Thank
[2:10:40] you Lord
[2:10:43] all for making
[2:10:46] me whole.
[2:10:50] Thank
[2:10:52] you Lord
[2:10:54] for giving
[2:10:57] to me.

[2:11:04] salvation

[2:11:09] and free.
