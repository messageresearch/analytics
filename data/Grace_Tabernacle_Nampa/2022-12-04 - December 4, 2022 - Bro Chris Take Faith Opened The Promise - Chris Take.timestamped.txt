[38:22] heart and Brother David asked what
[38:24] requests they were but I didn't say it
[38:25] and it came back on my heart again so
[38:28] um when we pray over the word this
[38:30] morning I just want to remember brother
[38:31] Adrian Stefan and Kalispell Montana
[38:35] um their work that they're trying to do
[38:36] up there that God would just lead them
[38:38] and guide them and give them the
[38:40] inspiration and the wisdom that they
[38:41] need to to do that amen thank you
[38:43] musicians it was beautiful today I
[38:45] enjoyed that song sir very much
[38:48] um
[38:49] it's uh the opener to the sermon
[38:54] and um I'll I'll uh I'll tell on myself
[38:57] for a minute here for the class this
[38:59] morning
[39:01] um I had no no notes
[39:03] I had nothing and so I asked the class
[39:07] and they didn't know that I said give me
[39:09] a subject
[39:10] and sister Alice I asked what we did
[39:13] last week and then I said give me a
[39:15] subject and she said faith and I just
[39:17] just talked about faith and and all that
[39:19] and we just unpacked that and the whole
[39:21] time I was like now what was I preaching
[39:22] this morning I couldn't remember my
[39:23] sermon this morning and so we talked
[39:25] about faith and we went over faith and
[39:27] how it's the key and never learned
[39:28] Revelation and then I sat down in the
[39:29] office and I opened my iPad and I was
[39:32] like oh yeah my title this morning is
[39:34] Faith open to the promise and I promise
[39:37] you when we taught class I did not
[39:39] remember that so even even myself as the
[39:42] minister can teach class and not
[39:44] understanding because the class almost
[39:47] every Sunday we have class the preacher
[39:49] preaches well we talked about in class
[39:51] so God did it again even though I'm one
[39:54] of the same so praise the Lord also glad
[39:57] most of you made it here safely
[40:00] um
[40:01] so why don't we stand this morning and
[40:03] we'll just uh
[40:04] open our Bibles up to Genesis chapter
[40:07] 16. and I have the whole chapter to read
[40:11] I don't know if we'll read the whole
[40:12] thing while we stand but um
[40:15] because we also have another another
[40:17] chapter
[40:18] in Genesis but Genesis chapter 16.
[40:26] really enjoyed Wednesday night
[40:28] the good teaching around white Throne
[40:31] judgment really enjoyed that
[40:34] amen
[40:38] why don't we why don't we just pray now
[40:40] while we're standing Heavenly Father
[40:41] Lord Jesus
[40:43] Lord you know it's been a bit chaos this
[40:45] morning and father even for myself and
[40:48] my family almost all week long
[40:51] God but from the very beginning within
[40:54] my heart I knew there was a purpose this
[40:56] morning Lord
[40:58] the devil only gets riled up when he
[41:00] knows he's about to get whooped down
[41:02] Lord but father God we know that even
[41:05] even in that
[41:07] it's only because you allow the chaos
[41:11] father so this morning we pray we would
[41:13] just fall right into your perfect hand
[41:14] of Grace Lord
[41:16] fall into your hand of Mercy Lord Jesus
[41:18] that you would use this father you love
[41:20] a broken and a contrite spirit you love
[41:22] a soft heart and sometimes you use the
[41:24] things of this world to bring us to a
[41:27] position where we're just ready to sit
[41:29] and have peace and ready to sit and
[41:31] listen and God may you just thank you
[41:34] for preparing the ground this morning I
[41:36] pray you'd minister to our hearts Lord
[41:37] Jesus father as we begin to look Lord
[41:40] into the scriptures this morning into
[41:42] the message I pray God that's something
[41:44] special within us we begin to open up
[41:46] Lord a part of us we never saw before
[41:49] Lord would be recognized and identified
[41:52] in your word Lord Jesus we love you Lord
[41:54] we thank you we just want to remember
[41:55] brother Adrian Stefan and his family up
[41:58] there in Kalispell Montana Lord continue
[42:00] to be their portion their inspiration
[42:02] their Direction this morning and
[42:04] throughout the days Lord we love you
[42:06] father we thank you for all you've done
[42:07] may you bless your word now in Jesus
[42:09] name we pray amen
[42:12] amen Genesis chapter 16 and we're going
[42:14] to start in verse 1.
[42:16] now Sarah Abraham Abram's wife bear him
[42:19] no children and she had and handmade an
[42:22] Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarah
[42:24] I said unto Abram behold now the Lord
[42:26] hath restrained me from bearing I pray
[42:29] thee go in unto my maid it may be that I
[42:31] may obtain children by her and Abram
[42:33] hearkens to the voice of Sarah
[42:36] and Sarah we may read it later on but
[42:39] the previous chapter is when God begins
[42:41] to work on Abram and give him his his
[42:43] his uh inspiration and his promise of a
[42:47] son
[42:48] God called Abram out and um
[42:52] when God called Abram out of
[42:55] jail he didn't say hey come out
[42:58] and I'm going to give you a son he just
[43:00] said come out that's right and Abram had
[43:03] faith
[43:04] and he walked out then God gave him this
[43:07] promise but directly after God gives him
[43:09] the promise what happens the Devil comes
[43:12] down to try to deter him from that
[43:15] promise so verse 3 and Sarah Abram's
[43:19] wife took Hagar who made the Egyptian
[43:21] after Abram had dwelled ten years in the
[43:23] land of Canaan so it's been 10 years
[43:25] since he departed and gave her to her
[43:27] husband Abram to be his wife and he went
[43:30] in on sahagar and she conceived and when
[43:32] she saw that she had conceived her Mitch
[43:35] mistress was despised in her eyes so it
[43:38] was both sides of the fence here were
[43:41] causing this this dissension this this
[43:43] uh separation between this argument this
[43:46] tension between Hagar and Sarah it
[43:49] wasn't just Sarah I was both
[43:51] but why was this why was this tension
[43:54] caused why was this problem caused
[43:56] through unbelief amen that's why
[43:59] unbelief is sin exactly because the
[44:02] reason you have problems reason you have
[44:03] conflict in your life is because you
[44:06] allowed something
[44:07] to come in
[44:09] to break that Faith to cause that fear
[44:11] of the promise that God's given you in
[44:13] it whenever that comes in there
[44:16] this is what it causes
[44:19] but a righteous man steps or ordered of
[44:21] the Lord so you watch and you see how
[44:23] how how uh well let me read so you can
[44:26] be seated and Sarah I said unto Abraham
[44:27] by wrong be upon thee I have given my
[44:29] mate into thy bosom and when she saw
[44:31] that she had conceived I was despised In
[44:33] Her Eyes the Lord judged between me and
[44:36] thee but Abrams Abram said unto Sarah I
[44:38] Behold thy mate is in thy hand to do to
[44:40] her as it pleases thee and when Sarah
[44:42] dealt hardly with her she fled from her
[44:45] face let's pray or we already prayed may
[44:48] the Lord add the blessing to the reading
[44:49] of his word he'd be seated this morning
[44:51] we'll pick back up an inch verse seven
[44:53] here but what I was saying a minute ago
[44:55] is that
[44:56] what happened was uh
[44:59] unbelief came in and unbelief caused a
[45:01] problem and that but a righteous man's
[45:03] steps or ordered of the Lord so you'll
[45:06] watch and and if you go and you read the
[45:08] story of Ishmael you'll see that God
[45:10] actually protects Ishmael from
[45:12] Annihilation there was two times where
[45:15] an Ishmael should have passed away the
[45:16] first time in the womb the second time
[45:18] as a young boy but neither of them
[45:20] happened God protected because God was
[45:22] going to use Ishmael God is using
[45:24] Ishmael to form in Isaac to form an
[45:28] Abraham a stronghold of faith we would
[45:31] not be we would not have character
[45:33] unless we had conflict conflict and and
[45:36] these things bring us into a position
[45:39] where then now we have Victory there is
[45:42] no victory until there is conflict you
[45:45] cannot say oh I won the war unless first
[45:47] there was war right so the same thing
[45:50] happens so my title this morning is
[45:52] Faith open to the promise and my
[45:54] subtitle is not born a Slave
[45:57] you know I began to think about that
[45:59] that song and and uh you know I love
[46:02] that song no we are no longer slaves to
[46:04] fear and and we in our in our in in this
[46:07] world you know we were at one point
[46:09] slaves to sin and we no longer are
[46:11] slaves but if you really look deep
[46:13] within you you never were a Slave
[46:15] you were not born a Slave
[46:18] though the world said you were though
[46:20] the world though you were a slave to the
[46:21] desires of sin for a season you were not
[46:24] born a Slave
[46:27] so Genesis 16 here
[46:31] so verse 7 and the angel of the Lord
[46:33] found her so he finds Hagar by a
[46:35] fountain of water in the wilderness by
[46:37] the fountain in the way of sure you know
[46:39] God likes to do a lot of things by a
[46:42] well
[46:43] all through the scriptures there's been
[46:45] pivotal moments where God has done
[46:47] something by a well
[46:49] and that's just uh there's many things
[46:51] I'm sure we could take from that but God
[46:54] is our Everlasting well
[46:56] he ours Eternal well and from him
[46:58] Springs forward life so um he finds
[47:01] Hagar by the Fountain of water in the
[47:03] wilderness by the fountain in the way of
[47:05] sure and he said Hagar Sarah Sarah is
[47:09] made whence cometh came as thou and
[47:11] wither wilt thou go and she said I flee
[47:13] from the face of my mistress Sarai and
[47:16] the angel of the Lord said unto her
[47:17] return to thy mistress and submit
[47:19] thyself under her hands and the angels
[47:22] of the Lord said unto her I will
[47:24] multiply thy seed exceedingly that it
[47:26] shall be numbered for multitude
[47:29] so he's giving her the same promise
[47:32] that he gave Abraham
[47:35] I will multiply that seed
[47:38] see the the the people can say oh you
[47:41] know
[47:42] well I'm gonna I people can say that
[47:44] that oh the blessings of God are on our
[47:46] church and we're just you know we're 400
[47:48] 500 800 strong not necessarily message
[47:51] churches but just churches in general
[47:53] well God just gave the same promise to
[47:56] the serpent seed that's right
[47:59] and the angel of the Lord said unto her
[48:01] behold thou art with child but do you
[48:03] know why he has that promise she gave
[48:05] him that promise because that's part of
[48:07] that seed came from Abraham that's right
[48:09] though he was not ishmael's was not the
[48:12] elect seed the seed still came from
[48:15] Abraham there were certain promises in
[48:17] God's word I want you to think about
[48:18] this and chew on this as we as we go
[48:20] this morning there's promises given in
[48:23] God words that God's word that even
[48:24] unelect can tap into and reap the
[48:27] blessings from
[48:28] there there I've heard stories uh this
[48:31] particular one was from Brother Jewel I
[48:32] think it was of of a bar owner who
[48:34] understood giving and tithing would
[48:37] bless his business and so he died then
[48:39] he gave of his offering
[48:42] and and uh or he or maybe he wasn't a
[48:44] borrow owner but he was he was an
[48:45] unbelievable unbelieving Heathen but he
[48:48] understood those two things and he gave
[48:49] and his business was blessed so
[48:53] just because I had a I had a
[48:54] conversation with a young man some time
[48:56] ago and and he he kind of asked the same
[48:59] thing well you know they the
[49:00] denomination uh they have these these
[49:03] Miracles and these things and these
[49:04] blessings
[49:05] well right here this that's where it is
[49:07] you can they can tap into that but
[49:09] that's where Today We Live that the we
[49:12] want to see what's the life being
[49:13] brought forth not what are the blessings
[49:15] not what are the Miracles but what's the
[49:18] life being brought forth
[49:21] amen so um verse 9 and uh Angel of the
[49:24] Lord said unto her return to thy
[49:26] mistress and submit thyself under her
[49:28] hands and the okay excuse me I'm in
[49:30] verse 11 and the answer the Lord said be
[49:32] unto her behold thou art with child and
[49:34] shalt bear a son and shall call his name
[49:35] Ishmael because the Lord hath heard thy
[49:38] affliction
[49:40] and he will be a wild man his hand will
[49:42] be against every man and every man's
[49:43] hand against him and he shall dwell in
[49:45] the presence of all his brethren
[49:48] and she called the name of the Lord that
[49:50] speak unto her thou God the thou God
[49:53] seized me for she said have I have I
[49:56] also here looked after him that seeth me
[49:58] wherefore the well was called
[50:02] behold it is between kadish and Beret
[50:04] and Hagar bear Abram a son and Abram
[50:06] called his son's name which Hagar bear
[50:08] Ishmael and Abram was 86 years old when
[50:12] Hagar bear Ishmael to Abram
[50:15] Genesis chapter 21.
[50:18] verse 1.
[50:23] and the Lord visited Sarah notice the
[50:26] name change as he had said and the Lord
[50:28] said did unto Sarah as he had spoken for
[50:32] Sarah conceived and bear Abraham no
[50:35] longer Abram a son in his own age at the
[50:38] set time of which God had spoken to him
[50:41] and Abraham called the name of his son
[50:43] that was born unto him whom Sarah said
[50:46] to excuse me was born unto him whom
[50:48] Sarah bear to him Isaac and Abraham
[50:51] circumcised his son Isaac being eight
[50:53] days old as God had commanded him and
[50:56] Abraham wasn't 100 years old when his
[50:58] son Isaac was born unto him
[51:01] and Sarah said God hath made me to laugh
[51:03] so that all that here will laugh with me
[51:05] and she said who would have said unto
[51:07] Abraham that Sarah should have given
[51:09] children suck for I have borne him a son
[51:12] in his old age and the child grew and
[51:14] was wean and Abraham made a great feast
[51:16] the same day that Isaac was weaned
[51:19] and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
[51:21] Egyptian now okay so here comes the
[51:23] promised son is is brought forth
[51:26] and we begin to see now the conflict
[51:30] conflict between Sarai and Hagar was
[51:32] resolved
[51:34] and now now we begin to see the conflict
[51:37] arise from those two seeds
[51:41] and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
[51:44] Egyptian whom she had borne unto Abraham
[51:46] mocking
[51:48] mocking at him
[51:50] making fun of him
[51:53] oh we all go to church come on just come
[51:56] with come do this with me what's the big
[51:58] deal no I don't we can go to the same
[52:00] church we both go to Grace Tabernacle
[52:02] but I don't do those kind of things oh
[52:04] what are you
[52:06] come on I've had that happen message
[52:08] people laughing at me because I'm
[52:10] following and I don't say that in any
[52:12] kind of way like look at me but there's
[52:14] something in your life you just you
[52:15] can't deny it I wanted to I wanted to
[52:17] just go off with something always held
[52:19] me back and so it's the same thing so
[52:21] here we have Israel and uh Isaac and
[52:23] Ishmael wherefore she said unto Abraham
[52:25] cast out this bondsman and her son for
[52:27] the son of this Bond woman
[52:30] shall not be Heir with my son even with
[52:32] Isaac
[52:35] and the thing was very Grievous in
[52:37] Abraham's sight because of his son
[52:39] Abraham loved Ishmael he was his son
[52:45] we love the flesh
[52:47] you all prettied it up this morning
[52:50] you brought it to church
[52:53] but we are called every day to cast it
[52:56] out we are called every day to separate
[52:58] it to push it aside look this is Sarah
[53:01] the bride saying get rid of this this
[53:04] bonds woman get rid of this situation
[53:07] and God said unto Abraham let not be
[53:09] Grievous in thy sights now God comes and
[53:11] said Abraham what she's saying is is
[53:13] true let it not be Grievous in that side
[53:15] because of the land and because of thy
[53:17] Bond woman and all that Sarah hath said
[53:18] unto thee hearken unto her voice for in
[53:20] Isaac shall thy seed be called and also
[53:23] of the son of the Bond woman will I make
[53:25] a nation because he is thy seed
[53:28] see right there and Abraham rose up
[53:32] early in the morning so God kept his
[53:34] promise
[53:35] even though Ishmael was not his elected
[53:36] seed what is our title this morning
[53:38] Faith opened the promise amen and
[53:41] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[53:43] took bread in a bottle of water and gave
[53:44] it unto Hagar putting it on her shoulder
[53:46] and the child and sent her away and she
[53:49] departed and wandered in the wilderness
[53:50] of Beersheba
[53:52] and the water was spent in the bottle
[53:54] and she cast the child under one of the
[53:56] shrubs and she went and sat her her down
[53:58] over against him a good way off as it
[54:01] were a bow shot for she said let me not
[54:03] see the death of the child and she sat
[54:05] over against him and lift up her voice
[54:07] and wept so 50 yards or so away with her
[54:10] back turned to him and God heard the
[54:12] voice of the lad and the angel of God
[54:13] Called to Hagar out of heaven and said
[54:16] unto her what alith thee Hagar fear not
[54:18] for God hath heard the voice of the lad
[54:21] where he is our eyes lift up the lad and
[54:23] hold him in thine hand for I will make
[54:25] him a great nation and God opened her
[54:28] eyes and she saw a well of water another
[54:30] well and she went and filled the bottle
[54:33] with water and gave the lad drink the
[54:35] latter rain right they all drink of the
[54:37] same water they all drink of the same
[54:39] rain but and they have the same thing
[54:41] Ishmael grew to be a stronger man Isaac
[54:44] grew to be a strong young man Isaac
[54:46] brought fourth seed Ishmael brought
[54:47] forth seed but what is the difference
[54:49] it's the life within them amen one was
[54:52] born of a bonds woman and one was born
[54:54] of a free woman
[54:56] and God opened her eyes and she saw a
[54:58] well of water okay and God was with the
[55:00] lad and he grew and dwelt in the
[55:01] wilderness and became an Archer and he
[55:03] dwelt in the wilderness of Quran and his
[55:06] mother took him a wife out of the land
[55:08] of Egypt now bear with me I just we just
[55:11] hit something in that verse and I want
[55:13] to check us something real quick here
[55:17] I guess Revelations
[55:28] yeah so the first seal there's a white
[55:31] horse rider that goes out and he has the
[55:33] bow so Ishmael here has a boat he's an
[55:36] Archer
[55:38] so people say oh that white horse rider
[55:40] with the bow you know that was Christ
[55:42] that was the Antichrist it was the
[55:44] impersonation so even Ishmael now an
[55:46] impersonation of the truth
[55:48] but there's something down inside
[55:50] Ishmael that doesn't identify with the
[55:52] word of God because he is a son of the
[55:55] bondsman who is your father you could
[55:59] have titled it that this we could have
[56:00] tiled this this morning that who is your
[56:02] father I don't care I don't care what
[56:04] you look like I don't care what you can
[56:06] do I Don't Care What miracles you can do
[56:08] I don't care what scriptures you can
[56:10] speak of who is your father I want to
[56:12] know who your father is that's why the
[56:14] Jews had such a stronghold on
[56:16] genealogies and who their father was why
[56:19] is it there why do you read there's some
[56:21] some scriptures in the chapter where
[56:22] it's it's 52 verses of genealogy
[56:26] God's testifying it matters who your
[56:29] father is the mothers were rarely ever
[56:31] mentioned in what they were there was a
[56:33] purpose you know with with uh the
[56:35] harlots in there in the genealogies
[56:36] there's a purpose for that but it was
[56:38] always the father why because that's
[56:40] what matters that's what matters that's
[56:42] the true seed of God so in this in the
[56:45] case of Abraham they both had the same
[56:47] father
[56:48] but where was that seed placed where was
[56:51] that seed put so with with it in the
[56:54] when you had Ishmael brought forth you
[56:56] had Abram
[56:58] and hagorn before the name change before
[57:00] the body changed before the Holy Spirit
[57:02] it was the right seed in the wrong womb
[57:05] in the wrong time
[57:08] so God bringing forth God God is
[57:10] bringing forth a bride out of the church
[57:14] so now then you had Sarah and Abraham so
[57:17] it was the right seed in the right room
[57:19] brought forth the promised son that's
[57:22] why the Bible says you know a seed was
[57:24] planted but it grew fast and it died and
[57:26] I thought I used to think well it was
[57:28] the seed what what's the problem well
[57:30] it's this right seed in the wrong right
[57:32] so the seed can be planted the seed was
[57:35] planted the seed from Abraham he was the
[57:37] father the correct father but it was
[57:39] planted in the wrong womb so the word of
[57:41] God has come forth the word of God Is
[57:43] Spoken but that's the Paradox of a
[57:45] Christian is that it doesn't matter and
[57:47] I was talking to the class this morning
[57:49] it's hard to to it's not hard to well
[57:53] it's hard to say in the human element
[57:54] and many people can get upset but guess
[57:57] what there is word for the elect amen
[57:59] not everybody is going to catch it I'm
[58:01] going to preach like everybody is seed
[58:04] I'm going to live my life like everybody
[58:06] I interact with is seed or potential to
[58:09] be to to come to church and begin to
[58:12] serve God as a seed that's how I'm going
[58:14] to live my life
[58:15] but the word says amen the word is for
[58:19] the elect of God why because that's how
[58:22] God decided it God is eternal and that's
[58:24] how he decided to do things so now the
[58:27] this morning we're talking about faith
[58:29] opened the promise and we have a quote
[58:31] here from the way of the way to have
[58:33] Fellowship but remember says there's
[58:35] only two faculties that govern a human
[58:37] and one of them is Faith which brings
[58:39] results
[58:41] and the other is fear which has no value
[58:43] in it at all faith is of god fear is of
[58:46] the devil fear Makes You Weary fear
[58:49] makes you wonder and if I was going to
[58:52] die in the morning what good would it do
[58:54] me to get all stewed up about it what if
[58:56] I was going to be electrocuted in the
[58:57] morning and my life had to end tomorrow
[58:59] morning what good would that do me to
[59:02] worry about it
[59:07] next quote here
[59:08] show us the father God doesn't have no
[59:11] use for a coward now brother Brown
[59:13] preaches they're pretty straight
[59:17] and taken out of context
[59:21] you can think well every time I had a
[59:23] little bit of fear or every time I was
[59:25] feeling like a coward well I must not be
[59:28] part of God
[59:29] that's not a context because what was
[59:32] Gideon doing behind
[59:34] he was hiding
[59:35] and the angel of the Lord said
[59:37] hello Mighty Man of Valor that's right
[59:40] see God sees your heart God sees your
[59:43] heart God doesn't have no use for a
[59:45] coward if you're afraid to trust him
[59:46] don't even make an effort
[59:48] until you're satisfied that he keeps his
[59:51] word and he keeps his promise
[59:54] I wonder how many
[59:55] would be upset if they thought those
[59:57] were my words
[59:59] until you're satisfied that he keeps his
[1:00:01] word and he keeps his promise then
[1:00:03] there's nothing going to stop you that's
[1:00:05] right but be sure you know where you're
[1:00:08] standing because you'll only make
[1:00:09] yourself worse
[1:00:11] then I noticed him I thought aren't you
[1:00:13] afraid of me there's he's talking about
[1:00:15] the eagle in the tree and he's out
[1:00:16] hunting I had my rifles sitting against
[1:00:18] the tree I said I can grab my rifle and
[1:00:20] shoot you or excuse me I think the
[1:00:24] the bird was on the ground I can't
[1:00:25] remember the story but he was close and
[1:00:27] and he just sat there and I noticed
[1:00:30] why uh so why is he not afraid and I
[1:00:33] noticed that he had his wings so he was
[1:00:36] saying that song Winds of Faith he kept
[1:00:39] feeling them seeing it the feathers was
[1:00:41] all in running order
[1:00:43] say it's yesterday morning did you feel
[1:00:46] to see if your wings are in working
[1:00:48] order
[1:00:49] did you make sure today to groom them
[1:00:51] you know a bird will groom his wings
[1:00:53] did you make sure to make sure your your
[1:00:55] wings and make sure that you make sure
[1:00:57] that you make sure your wings were set
[1:00:59] ready for flight or are they are they
[1:01:02] are they missing feathers because you
[1:01:04] haven't been taking care of them
[1:01:06] is your faith in faith weaked is the is
[1:01:09] your are your wings weak because you
[1:01:11] haven't taken proper care
[1:01:14] but though Eagle knew he began to feel
[1:01:16] his feathers and feel his wings he knew
[1:01:19] they were set they were ready
[1:01:21] you see we have a part to play we have
[1:01:24] the Winds of Faith As we sing the song
[1:01:26] the winds come God brings the wind but
[1:01:29] we've got to put the wings out we've got
[1:01:32] to spread our wings when God comes you
[1:01:34] say oh I need God to come I'm praying
[1:01:36] God to come on the scene you have you
[1:01:39] there's a promise in the word and I'm
[1:01:41] praying and I'm praying but have you set
[1:01:43] your wings are you ready for Faith to
[1:01:46] come open the promise to you are you
[1:01:49] ready for God to come until you are
[1:01:52] nothing will happen that's it but you
[1:01:54] need God you need God to get yourself
[1:01:56] into a position where you're ready to be
[1:01:59] lifted up to be lifted up away from the
[1:02:01] from this situation
[1:02:04] he feeling them see if the feathers were
[1:02:07] all in running order I thought that's it
[1:02:09] God has given him two Wings he's got
[1:02:12] confidence in him he knows that he could
[1:02:14] be in that Timber before I get my hand
[1:02:16] on that gun he's got perfect confidence
[1:02:19] in his god-given way of escape and if a
[1:02:22] eagle in God's Universe can have enough
[1:02:25] confidence in a god-given gift of his
[1:02:27] wings how much more ought we the
[1:02:31] children of God to have confidence in
[1:02:33] the Holy Spirit even though the doctor
[1:02:34] says you're going to die with cancer
[1:02:36] just as long as you can feel that power
[1:02:38] of God there let everything be a lie and
[1:02:43] God's word be truth
[1:02:47] say to God
[1:02:50] faith is the key that's it to open the
[1:02:52] promise
[1:02:54] open the promise open up Christ who is
[1:02:57] the promise it's Christ he's the
[1:02:59] promised son
[1:03:01] what happened Abraham had a name change
[1:03:04] why did Abraham have a name change
[1:03:05] because God identified his faith
[1:03:09] and when God identifies your faith he
[1:03:12] gives you a name change he get he he
[1:03:15] identifies you with who you really are
[1:03:18] Abram is not mentioned
[1:03:22] in the scripture in the in the New
[1:03:23] Testament Abram is not mentioned
[1:03:25] post-resurrection Abraham is mentioned
[1:03:30] Abram's sin of Ishmael is not mentioned
[1:03:32] necessarily
[1:03:34] post-resurrection
[1:03:37] Paul talks about the son of the Bond
[1:03:39] woman and those things but when it's
[1:03:40] when we talk about Abraham it says
[1:03:43] Abraham had faith in Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:03:46] Abraham had faith if you read Hebrews 11
[1:03:49] and you read about all those people you
[1:03:50] say I can go in the Old Testament and I
[1:03:53] can show you their mistakes
[1:03:56] but what is the difference between
[1:03:57] Hebrews 11 and the Old Testament
[1:04:00] Resurrection happened in between Christ
[1:04:03] came
[1:04:04] Christ came and now those things that
[1:04:07] were once written are no more
[1:04:10] those things that God once remembered
[1:04:12] are no more because they were sins that
[1:04:15] had been washed away for good
[1:04:18] you see God has the same book written of
[1:04:20] you
[1:04:22] not their mistakes not your sins once
[1:04:25] forgiven once repented of your book is
[1:04:28] clean and your book reads as Hebrews 11
[1:04:31] reads amen
[1:04:34] so
[1:04:36] in James chapter 2 verse 23 and the
[1:04:40] scripture was fulfilled with saith
[1:04:42] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:04:44] unto him for righteousness and he was
[1:04:47] called the friend of God
[1:04:49] if you if you go back and you excuse me
[1:04:52] I'm getting ahead of myself here
[1:04:57] praise the Lord so what happened with
[1:05:00] Abraham what happened with with Abram
[1:05:02] excuse me
[1:05:03] with the birth of Ishmael why why did
[1:05:07] this why was this brought forth why was
[1:05:09] this
[1:05:10] what caused all of this this this this
[1:05:12] these issues
[1:05:14] why did you know Abram was just given
[1:05:17] this promise in chapter 15 here
[1:05:20] we'll just read we'll read 1 through 6
[1:05:22] 15 1-6 and I apologize to the sound guys
[1:05:25] and our interpreter I didn't this came
[1:05:28] this scripture came to me right before I
[1:05:30] came up here
[1:05:31] and after these things the word of the
[1:05:33] Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying
[1:05:36] fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[1:05:38] exceeding great reward Genesis 15 1.
[1:05:43] and Abram said Lord God what will thou
[1:05:46] give me seeing I go childless and
[1:05:48] assured of my house is This Ellie Eater
[1:05:50] of Damascus and Abram said behold to me
[1:05:52] thou Hast given no seed and lo one born
[1:05:56] in my house is mine Heir and behold the
[1:05:58] word of the Lord came unto him saying
[1:05:59] this shall not be thine hair but he that
[1:06:02] shall come forth out of thine own bow
[1:06:04] shall be thine air you see
[1:06:06] it wasn't really easy
[1:06:09] God identifies right here Eli Israel was
[1:06:11] not our promised son amen but the
[1:06:13] Brandon was not our promised son
[1:06:16] the message he brought forth
[1:06:19] is our promised son
[1:06:22] behold the word of the Lord came unto
[1:06:24] him saying this shall not be thine Air
[1:06:25] verse 5 and he brought him forth abroad
[1:06:28] and said look now toward heaven and tell
[1:06:31] the Stars if thou be able to number them
[1:06:33] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[1:06:35] be and he believed in the Lord and he
[1:06:38] counted it to him for righteousness this
[1:06:41] is Genesis 15. Genesis 16 is when Hagar
[1:06:45] excuse me Abram takes Hagar and brings
[1:06:48] forth Ishmael
[1:06:50] so what happened
[1:06:53] Abram knew had a promise already we
[1:06:55] already have a promise
[1:06:57] we have a promise that we are called to
[1:06:59] be Overcomers see what happened the
[1:07:01] other day when you fell what happened
[1:07:04] what happened the other day when you
[1:07:05] made a mistake you have the promise why
[1:07:08] are we not perfect we have the promise
[1:07:14] what happened was
[1:07:17] fear came in amen
[1:07:20] fear blocked the promise
[1:07:22] that's why the devil's his tool is fear
[1:07:26] fear will block the promise
[1:07:33] I want you to hold that there as a
[1:07:35] hopeless situation
[1:07:37] fear has blocked the promise
[1:07:42] but
[1:07:48] brother Brandon was in a position one
[1:07:50] time
[1:07:52] and I apologize again I didn't I got
[1:07:55] this quote because Brother David sang
[1:07:56] behind the veil
[1:07:58] this quote came to me
[1:08:01] brother random was laying in bed one day
[1:08:02] and he was he was feeling hopeless
[1:08:05] now the situation maybe is different
[1:08:07] than Abraham the situation is different
[1:08:09] than situations we have been in but
[1:08:12] the key is he was feeling a bit hopeless
[1:08:16] God promised
[1:08:19] God gave the promise it's there for you
[1:08:22] so what's getting in the way
[1:08:24] why are you not fear has blocked the
[1:08:27] promise
[1:08:28] there was a fear that brother had that
[1:08:31] he would pass be pass away and he would
[1:08:33] just be a cloud floating and he would be
[1:08:35] able to identify this other Cloud as
[1:08:36] being brother
[1:08:38] um Neville
[1:08:40] this fear
[1:08:42] so God comes along and and and
[1:08:44] this is in the rejected King and I
[1:08:47] raised up on my pillow and
[1:08:49] and as many of you have people have done
[1:08:51] it put my head upon the headboard of the
[1:08:53] bed and I don't usually like to read
[1:08:54] really long quotes but I want to read
[1:08:56] this story this morning the headboard of
[1:08:58] the bed and put my hands behind me and I
[1:09:00] was laying like there like this I
[1:09:02] haven't even have done that
[1:09:04] I've done that Lord I what's going on
[1:09:07] hopeless a moment of hopelessness and I
[1:09:10] said well I just wonder what it will be
[1:09:12] the other side I'm already 50 and I
[1:09:14] haven't done nothing yet if I could only
[1:09:16] do something to help the Lord
[1:09:19] nor would that leave us
[1:09:21] for I know I won't be mortal half of my
[1:09:23] time is gone at least or more than half
[1:09:25] if I live to be as old as my people
[1:09:28] still half my time is gone and I looked
[1:09:30] around and I was lying there fixing to
[1:09:32] get up it was about seven o'clock I said
[1:09:35] I I believe I'll go down to church this
[1:09:37] morning if I'm hoarse I'd like to hear
[1:09:38] but the Neville preach so I said are you
[1:09:40] awake honey and she was sleeping very
[1:09:42] soundly his wife
[1:09:45] now watch what he says
[1:09:47] I don't want you to miss this
[1:09:50] that's us
[1:09:52] I don't want you to miss this it has
[1:09:54] changed me amen
[1:09:56] amen I can't be the same brother Branham
[1:09:58] I was
[1:10:01] that's how important this is right here
[1:10:03] we're about to read
[1:10:05] and I looked and I heard something kept
[1:10:07] saying you're just starting press the
[1:10:09] battle just keep pressing
[1:10:12] I shook my head a minute and I thought
[1:10:13] well I probably just thinking like this
[1:10:16] you know my persons can get some
[1:10:18] imaginations and I said I just probably
[1:10:19] imagined it and it said press the battle
[1:10:23] keep going keep going
[1:10:25] I said maybe I said it I put my lips
[1:10:28] within my teeth
[1:10:29] he bit his lips
[1:10:31] and put my hand over my mouth
[1:10:33] and there it come again just keep
[1:10:35] pressing if you only knew what was at
[1:10:38] the end of the road
[1:10:40] and it seemed like I could hear Graham
[1:10:42] Snelling or somebody that sang that song
[1:10:44] like this they sing sit here anime all
[1:10:47] of you all I'm homesick and blue I want
[1:10:49] to see Jesus I would like to hear those
[1:10:51] sweet Harbor bells chime
[1:10:53] I would it would brighten my path it
[1:10:56] would vanish all fears Lord let me look
[1:10:57] past the curtain of time you've heard it
[1:10:59] saying here at the church and heard
[1:11:01] something say would you like to see just
[1:11:03] beyond the curtain
[1:11:05] and I said it would help me so much
[1:11:08] and I looked in just a moment one breath
[1:11:11] I had come into a little place that
[1:11:13] slanted I I looked back and there I was
[1:11:15] laying on the bed and I said this is a
[1:11:17] strange thing now I would not want you
[1:11:20] to repeat this this is before my church
[1:11:23] or my sheep that I'm pastoring whether
[1:11:25] it was I was in this body or out whether
[1:11:27] it was a translation it wasn't like any
[1:11:30] Vision I ever had
[1:11:31] I could talk I could look there and I
[1:11:34] could look here so you could see both
[1:11:36] places normally in a vision he was he
[1:11:38] was gone from the where his body was he
[1:11:40] was somewhere else but now he could see
[1:11:41] both places
[1:11:45] and when I hit that little place I'd
[1:11:47] never seen so many people come running
[1:11:49] screaming oh our precious brother and I
[1:11:51] looked and a young woman maybe in their
[1:11:53] early 20s 18 to 20 they were throwing
[1:11:56] their arms around me and screaming or
[1:11:58] our precious brother here come young men
[1:12:01] in the Brilliance of Young Manhood and
[1:12:03] their eyes glistening looking like stars
[1:12:05] on a darker night their teeth as white
[1:12:07] as Pearl and they were screaming and
[1:12:08] grabbing me and screaming oh our
[1:12:10] precious brother and I stopped and I
[1:12:12] looked and and I was young I looked back
[1:12:14] at my old body laying there with my
[1:12:16] hands behind my head and I said I don't
[1:12:17] understand this
[1:12:19] and these young women women throwing
[1:12:21] their arms around me now I do realize
[1:12:23] this is a mixed audience and I say this
[1:12:24] with the sweetness and with the
[1:12:26] mellowness of the spirit men cannot put
[1:12:28] your arm around women without a human
[1:12:30] sensation
[1:12:31] but it wasn't there there was no
[1:12:33] yesterday no tomorrow they didn't get
[1:12:34] tired I never seen such pretty women in
[1:12:37] all my life they had hair down to their
[1:12:39] waistline long skirts to their feet and
[1:12:41] they were just hugging me I wasn't it
[1:12:43] wasn't a hug like even my own sister
[1:12:44] sitting here there would hug me they
[1:12:47] were not kissing me and I was not
[1:12:49] kissing them it was something I have not
[1:12:51] got the vocabulary I haven't got the
[1:12:53] words to say perfection wouldn't touch
[1:12:56] it
[1:12:57] superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it
[1:13:00] was something that I never you just have
[1:13:03] to be there
[1:13:07] you know there's a story there's stories
[1:13:09] sometimes you go oh well you just had to
[1:13:11] be there
[1:13:15] we'll never understand it we've just got
[1:13:17] to be there
[1:13:19] and it looked this way and that way and
[1:13:21] they were coming by the thousands and I
[1:13:22] said I don't understand this
[1:13:24] and here come hope that was my first
[1:13:26] wife she rung and never said my husband
[1:13:28] she said my precious brother when she
[1:13:29] hugged me there was another woman
[1:13:31] standing there that had hugged me and
[1:13:33] then hoped hug this woman and each one
[1:13:34] and I thought oh this has to be
[1:13:35] something different
[1:13:37] can't be there's something I thought oh
[1:13:39] would I ever want to go back to that old
[1:13:42] carcass again
[1:13:43] I looked around and I thought what is
[1:13:45] this and I looked real good and I said I
[1:13:46] can't understand this but hope seemed to
[1:13:48] be like a guest of honor she was no
[1:13:50] different but just like a guest of honor
[1:13:52] and I heard her voice and that spoke to
[1:13:55] me that was in the room and said this is
[1:13:56] what you preached was the Holy Ghost
[1:13:58] this is perfect love
[1:14:00] and nothing can inter here without it
[1:14:05] what is perfect love
[1:14:07] Christ
[1:14:08] nothing can enter that place without
[1:14:11] Christ
[1:14:15] I am more determined than ever in my
[1:14:18] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:14:20] there
[1:14:22] was no jealousy there was no tiredness
[1:14:24] there was no death sickness could never
[1:14:26] end there amen mortality could never
[1:14:29] make you old they could not cry it was
[1:14:32] just one Joy oh my precious brother and
[1:14:34] they took me up and set me up on a great
[1:14:36] big high place and I thought I am not
[1:14:38] dreaming
[1:14:39] I'm looking back at my body laying down
[1:14:42] there on the bed he could still see his
[1:14:44] body he says I'm not dreaming in other
[1:14:45] words he's gone somewhere
[1:14:48] he stepped beyond the curtain of time
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:54] and they set me up there and I said oh I
[1:14:57] shouldn't sit up here
[1:14:58] and here come women men and from both
[1:15:00] sides just in their Bloom of you
[1:15:02] screaming and one woman was standing
[1:15:04] there and she screamed oh my precious
[1:15:05] brother oh we are so happy to see you
[1:15:07] here I said I don't understand this and
[1:15:09] that voice that was speaking from above
[1:15:11] me said you know it is written in the
[1:15:13] Bible that the prophets were gathered
[1:15:14] with their people
[1:15:17] and I said I remember that in the
[1:15:19] scriptures
[1:15:21] said well this is when you will gather
[1:15:23] your people I said
[1:15:25] then they'll be real and I can feel them
[1:15:27] oh yes I said but there's Millions
[1:15:29] there's not that many branhams
[1:15:32] and the voice said they're not brenhams
[1:15:35] our name given to us is not for him
[1:15:39] our name given to us is Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:15:44] them is your converts that's the ones
[1:15:46] that you've led to the Lord and said
[1:15:48] some of them women there that you think
[1:15:50] is so beautiful were better than 90
[1:15:52] years old when you led them to the Lord
[1:15:54] no wonder they're screaming our precious
[1:15:56] brother and they screamed all at once
[1:15:58] said if you hadn't have went we wouldn't
[1:16:01] be here
[1:16:02] and I looked around I thought well I
[1:16:04] don't get it I said oh here where is
[1:16:06] Jesus I want to see him so bad and they
[1:16:08] said now he is just a little higher
[1:16:10] right up that way he said someday he
[1:16:13] will come to you you were sent for a
[1:16:15] leader and God will come when he does
[1:16:17] he'll judge you according to what you
[1:16:19] taught them first whether they go in or
[1:16:21] not will go in according to your
[1:16:22] teaching and he's and I said oh I'm so
[1:16:24] glad did Paul does he have to stand like
[1:16:28] this does Peter have to stand like this
[1:16:29] yes I said then I preached every word
[1:16:31] that they preached I never divvied from
[1:16:33] it one side to the other were they
[1:16:35] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:16:37] did too were they taught the baptism of
[1:16:38] the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they
[1:16:40] taught I did too and then people
[1:16:42] screamed and said we know that
[1:16:45] saints of God these are people this is
[1:16:47] not a dream this is not a vision brother
[1:16:49] Birmingham had he stood there those
[1:16:51] people saw him and he saw those people
[1:16:53] this is a place more real than what is
[1:16:55] we're looking at today
[1:16:57] and they said they testified that what
[1:17:01] he preached was what Paul preached that
[1:17:04] leaves no argument whatsoever about what
[1:17:07] the message taught
[1:17:09] because these people could not lie
[1:17:13] they could not lie they're in a place
[1:17:15] they could not lie and they testified
[1:17:16] they said we know that and we know that
[1:17:19] we're going with you someday back to
[1:17:21] Earth
[1:17:24] said Jesus will come and you'll be
[1:17:26] judged according to that word that you
[1:17:27] preached us and then if you are accepted
[1:17:29] at that time which you will be and said
[1:17:31] then you will be present present then
[1:17:34] you will present us to him as your
[1:17:36] trophies of your ministry said you will
[1:17:38] guide us to him and all together we'll
[1:17:40] go back to the Earth to live forever I
[1:17:42] said do I have to return back now
[1:17:48] the voice said yes but keep pressing on
[1:17:51] sometimes it feels that way Saints
[1:17:53] we have a good service we sit in the
[1:17:55] presence of God which is just the
[1:17:56] blessings
[1:17:57] everything do I have to walk out
[1:17:59] do I have to go back out there do I have
[1:18:02] to go face the sin and the Darkness of
[1:18:05] the world around us but God said just
[1:18:08] keep pressing on
[1:18:10] God took Abram out
[1:18:13] and he said Abram look to the Stars
[1:18:16] Abram had been journeying for 10 years
[1:18:18] without a word from the Lord and God
[1:18:21] comes and says Abram look to the Stars
[1:18:24] look to Heaven God this morning is
[1:18:28] giving you a chance saying look to
[1:18:30] heaven and keep pressing on keep
[1:18:34] pressing on how can you identify
[1:18:36] yourself with the promise through faith
[1:18:40] what casts out all unbelief faith
[1:18:45] faith can open the promise for you this
[1:18:48] morning faith can give you victory over
[1:18:50] fear Faith blocked the promise but
[1:18:54] amen Faith prevailed
[1:18:58] fear excuse me blocked the promise but
[1:19:00] Faith prevailed
[1:19:02] there is this is not the end of the
[1:19:04] story if you go and you read about
[1:19:06] kadish barnea
[1:19:07] that was not the end of the story the
[1:19:10] Israelites did eventually walk over
[1:19:13] Jordan because Faith prevailed in the
[1:19:16] scripture you'll read David Fell in
[1:19:19] adultery David Fell
[1:19:21] but Faith prevailed Abram fell and had
[1:19:25] Ishmael but Hebrews 11 says by faith
[1:19:28] Abraham
[1:19:33] Gideon was in weakness Gideon was in
[1:19:35] defeat but Hebrews 11 says faith
[1:19:39] prevailed
[1:19:41] your story is written a certain way and
[1:19:44] you remember it and you remember what
[1:19:46] you did and what you did wrong what
[1:19:48] you're doing wrong but faith has and
[1:19:51] will prevail
[1:19:53] faith has opened the promise
[1:19:57] and you were not born a Slave
[1:20:02] I looked and I could see the people just
[1:20:04] as far as I could see still coming
[1:20:06] wanting to hug me screaming our precious
[1:20:08] brother just in a voice said all that
[1:20:10] you ever loved and all that ever loved
[1:20:12] you God has given you here and I looked
[1:20:13] and here come my old dog come walking up
[1:20:16] here come my horse and laid his head
[1:20:17] upon my shoulder and nickered said all
[1:20:20] that you ever loved and all that ever
[1:20:21] loved you God has given them into your
[1:20:23] hand through your ministry
[1:20:25] not through your friendship
[1:20:28] he's passed away I was born years after
[1:20:31] he passed away but I am hearing his
[1:20:34] ministry amen which is the word that God
[1:20:37] sent to us and I felt myself move from
[1:20:39] that beautiful place and I looked around
[1:20:41] I said are you awake honey she was still
[1:20:43] asleep and I thought oh god oh help me
[1:20:45] God never let me compromise
[1:20:48] with one word let me say you write
[1:20:51] straight on that word and preach it I
[1:20:53] don't care what comes or goes or what
[1:20:54] anybody does how many Sauls sons of Kish
[1:20:57] rise how many this that or the other let
[1:20:59] me Lord press to that place
[1:21:03] so I say this with my Bible before me
[1:21:05] this morning
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:10] so God took Abram out and he showed him
[1:21:13] the star and he said this is your
[1:21:15] promise
[1:21:16] a fear came in and fear blocked the
[1:21:18] promise but what brought the total
[1:21:20] Victory God recognized Abram's faith and
[1:21:23] gave him a name change
[1:21:26] he brought him out he gave him
[1:21:27] circumcision and he said
[1:21:30] um
[1:21:31] so directly after Ishmael
[1:21:34] chapter 17 and Abram was 90 years old
[1:21:37] and nine 99 years old and the Lord
[1:21:39] appeared to Abram said unto him I am the
[1:21:42] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[1:21:46] perfect amen God has given us the same
[1:21:48] voice God has given us the same word
[1:21:51] excuse me
[1:21:52] the same word be thou perfect
[1:21:56] what's impossible
[1:21:59] it's impossible
[1:22:04] but what God says to do
[1:22:06] right that's a commandment
[1:22:10] so we have to be perfect well it's
[1:22:12] impossible there's no hope Abram
[1:22:15] probably thought it's impossible Lord I
[1:22:17] just failed
[1:22:19] or about Ishmael and now I got problems
[1:22:21] I got conflict
[1:22:24] perfect
[1:22:25] how am I going to be perfect
[1:22:28] see here
[1:22:29] how are we going to be perfect
[1:22:31] I know you know I know you know we'll
[1:22:33] just wait how are we going to be perfect
[1:22:37] there's fear in our lives that we
[1:22:40] I can't be perfect
[1:22:45] but God wasn't done talking
[1:22:48] you know sometimes God says something
[1:22:49] and we jump in and we interrupt
[1:22:52] if we would just be quiet
[1:22:57] and let him speak
[1:22:59] be perfect Abraham
[1:23:01] Abram excuse me and I will make my
[1:23:04] Covenant between me and thee and will
[1:23:06] multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell
[1:23:08] on his face and God talked with him
[1:23:10] Abraham fell on his face why does it
[1:23:13] mention that because now Abram is a more
[1:23:16] humble man
[1:23:18] God will bring things into your life
[1:23:20] bring Ishmael and hagars into your life
[1:23:23] to bring you down to bring you humbled
[1:23:27] down
[1:23:29] to bring you on your face and so that
[1:23:31] when he speaks you fall on your face
[1:23:34] in in reverence in sincerity in
[1:23:38] humbleness and in full surrender
[1:23:41] and God lord goes on to say as for me
[1:23:43] behold my Covenant is with thee this is
[1:23:46] God's covenant
[1:23:48] nothing can break God's covenant
[1:23:50] nothing can break God's covenant he's
[1:23:52] given it to us
[1:23:54] Thou shalt be a father of many nations
[1:23:56] neither shall thy name any more be
[1:23:59] called Abram but thy name shall be
[1:24:02] Abraham for a father of many nations
[1:24:05] have I made thee
[1:24:08] that's how Abraham could be perfect
[1:24:12] Abram can never be perfect
[1:24:16] Sarah I can never be perfect
[1:24:19] but Abraham and Sarah can
[1:24:24] you can never be perfect living under
[1:24:27] the conditions of a bonds woman amen God
[1:24:31] has given you the Commandment be thou
[1:24:33] perfect God has given you the
[1:24:35] Commandment forgive and it shall be
[1:24:37] forgiven you how can we do these things
[1:24:39] how can the world the world looks on it
[1:24:42] says how can you do this how can you say
[1:24:45] we must be perfect how can you have
[1:24:47] overcoming power how can you are get all
[1:24:50] this stuff the word is commanding you to
[1:24:52] do how can we do that
[1:24:55] faith and open the promise and God has
[1:24:58] given you this faith
[1:25:01] God recognizes the faith that he has
[1:25:03] given you
[1:25:05] you didn't come by that faith alone God
[1:25:09] gave Abraham that Faith because Abraham
[1:25:11] was God's elected scene that's right so
[1:25:15] God's given you the faith he gives you
[1:25:17] the very key you need to unlock
[1:25:19] everything he has for you
[1:25:22] amen that's right if you lock something
[1:25:24] up
[1:25:26] as a person
[1:25:28] you're in a deuce I don't know I can't
[1:25:31] think of an example but just it just
[1:25:33] blows my mind God gave you the thing you
[1:25:36] need
[1:25:37] to access him
[1:25:39] you didn't have to go get it no sir God
[1:25:42] gave it to you
[1:25:43] do you see how much he wants you to
[1:25:45] succeed do you see how much he how how
[1:25:49] excited he is to see you conquer this
[1:25:52] world
[1:25:53] you know why
[1:25:55] because he sees the end of the story
[1:25:57] right those Millions there
[1:26:02] amen he sees the end of the story
[1:26:06] Faith opened the promise fear blocked it
[1:26:09] but Faith opened it amen faith has
[1:26:12] opened the word to you faith is the key
[1:26:17] fear is not the end of the story
[1:26:21] praise the Lord
[1:26:26] I mentioned Cadence barnia in Numbers
[1:26:28] Chapter 13.
[1:26:36] service
[1:26:40] 30
[1:26:42] . and Caleb Still the people before
[1:26:44] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[1:26:47] possess it for we are well able to
[1:26:49] overcome it
[1:26:52] but the men that went up with him said
[1:26:54] we be not able to go up against the
[1:26:57] people for they are stronger than we
[1:26:59] Ishmael versus Isaac
[1:27:03] and they brought up an evil report of
[1:27:05] the land which they had searched under
[1:27:06] the children of Israel saying the land
[1:27:07] through which we have gone to search it
[1:27:09] is a land that eatest up the inhabitants
[1:27:11] thereof and all the people that we saw
[1:27:12] in it are men of great stature it's
[1:27:14] impossible to serve God today
[1:27:17] the world will eat you up and spit you
[1:27:19] out it's impossible
[1:27:20] perfect you cannot be perfect it's
[1:27:22] impossible
[1:27:23] come as you are stay like you want yeah
[1:27:27] that's what they say
[1:27:31] but that's the voice of Ishmael
[1:27:34] that's the voice of Ishmael
[1:27:36] the voice of Isaac
[1:27:38] testifies with Caleb
[1:27:40] we are able
[1:27:42] to over comment
[1:27:45] and I said oh we saw giants
[1:27:48] the sons of anak which came of the
[1:27:50] Giants and we were in our own side as
[1:27:52] grass our own sight as grasshoppers
[1:27:56] okay for a minute here can I have the
[1:27:58] Liberty to take the Viewpoint of the
[1:27:59] Giant
[1:28:02] they just said in their own sights they
[1:28:04] were as grasshoppers they didn't ask the
[1:28:06] Giants what the Giants saw
[1:28:08] can I tell you something
[1:28:10] the Giants in your life the Giants in
[1:28:12] the world whatever you put you put the
[1:28:14] name on the Giant Goliath whatever the
[1:28:16] giant may be
[1:28:18] you say in your eyesight you're as a
[1:28:20] grasshopper do you know what the giant
[1:28:22] sees
[1:28:23] a bigger giant
[1:28:26] but he's not going to tell you that he
[1:28:28] doesn't want you to know that you're a
[1:28:30] bigger giant than he is but that's his
[1:28:33] Viewpoint the sons of anak looked upon
[1:28:36] the children of Israel
[1:28:37] they saw some grasshoppers
[1:28:40] but then they saw these two men Caleb
[1:28:43] and Joshua
[1:28:44] and they wondered why they were so much
[1:28:46] taller than the rest of them
[1:28:50] the devil looks on from his
[1:28:54] strongholds
[1:28:56] and he sees
[1:28:58] you
[1:29:01] not you
[1:29:04] but in who you are inside
[1:29:08] if the devil can identify us why can't
[1:29:10] we identify ourselves
[1:29:13] if the devil can look on and say I see a
[1:29:15] mighty man of Valor but I'm not going to
[1:29:16] tell him that I'm going to tell him he's
[1:29:18] not
[1:29:22] I'm gonna tell him he's defeated
[1:29:25] even because he's not you see the devil
[1:29:28] likes to preach
[1:29:29] the opposite
[1:29:31] whatever God's trying to tell you
[1:29:34] God's trying to tell you you are more
[1:29:35] than able to take the land God has given
[1:29:37] you a promise but the Devil comes with
[1:29:39] fear and says no no no you understand
[1:29:40] the Giants are taller and they're more
[1:29:43] sophisticated
[1:29:44] these sons of anak they have technology
[1:29:46] they can see they can understand all
[1:29:48] these things they they can break through
[1:29:50] they're they're smarter they've gone to
[1:29:52] you know they have all this stuff they
[1:29:54] figured it out
[1:29:55] um it's impossible for you to take the
[1:29:57] land so why don't you just go back in
[1:29:59] the desert
[1:30:01] because you can't do it
[1:30:06] you know what the Lord likes an Underdog
[1:30:08] Story
[1:30:10] so he sent that children of Israel back
[1:30:12] into the desert and those Devils thought
[1:30:14] we had the victory
[1:30:16] He sent Jesus into the ground and the
[1:30:18] devil says Ah we have the victory
[1:30:21] Victory but God loves to catch the Devil
[1:30:23] by surprise
[1:30:25] God loves to catch the Devil by surprise
[1:30:27] what is the best way to defeat your
[1:30:30] enemy catch him by surprise you catch
[1:30:33] him off guard
[1:30:35] you catch him by surprise so Senators
[1:30:38] will win the desert and walked but God
[1:30:39] was forming an army you know there's a
[1:30:41] scripture in the Bible where God says
[1:30:42] we're describes that God when the enemy
[1:30:44] comes in like a flood God raises up a
[1:30:47] standard do you know what the word
[1:30:48] standard in that context in that
[1:30:50] scripture means
[1:30:52] raises up an army
[1:30:55] go look it up
[1:30:57] standard means raises up an army
[1:31:01] so the enemy comes in like a flood what
[1:31:03] does God do
[1:31:05] he says Brother David
[1:31:08] here's a better sword
[1:31:10] here's the better Shield
[1:31:11] Sean go sharpen your sword your shoes
[1:31:14] are untied brother Tim take a moment
[1:31:17] your Shield's got a dent go I got an
[1:31:18] Armory we can get that fixed up for you
[1:31:21] go you're Titus your helmet it's got a
[1:31:24] crack from the last battle take it over
[1:31:25] to the army with brother Tim and get it
[1:31:27] fixed up
[1:31:28] God raises up an army you are that army
[1:31:32] that God has raised now the Devil comes
[1:31:34] in like a flood he says it's impossible
[1:31:36] for you to take the land but God says I
[1:31:38] will raise a standard you are that
[1:31:41] standard say to God this morning you are
[1:31:44] the standard you're the flag waving
[1:31:47] above the army that says we can make it
[1:31:49] you're the flag set on Bunker Hill that
[1:31:51] says we have the victory you this
[1:31:53] morning have the power of Christ in you
[1:31:56] to slay every giant of a neck every
[1:31:58] Giant in your life and you you can do it
[1:32:02] not your dad not your mom not me you
[1:32:06] amen right not all Christ is gonna fix
[1:32:09] it for me no God said I'm raising you up
[1:32:12] as a standard you will stand and you
[1:32:14] will testify it doesn't matter how dark
[1:32:16] the world is I have a people that can
[1:32:19] stand and fight
[1:32:22] the devil says well let me have my way
[1:32:23] with job
[1:32:25] God says go ahead
[1:32:27] what happened in job's life the enemy
[1:32:29] came in like a flood
[1:32:31] but God raised job up God didn't come
[1:32:34] and fix job's situation for him God
[1:32:37] raised job up right
[1:32:40] job was weak
[1:32:42] job was down his friends had tried to
[1:32:45] friends had tried to encourage and tell
[1:32:48] him he was a secret sinner and they
[1:32:50] speak and job argues and they go back
[1:32:52] and forth and there's this whole
[1:32:54] situation and then it says the joke the
[1:32:57] words of job were ended
[1:32:59] and Ellie who rose up to speak
[1:33:02] Ellie who in some context is Jehovah or
[1:33:05] something along those lines
[1:33:08] Ellie who speaks and he speaks in
[1:33:09] frustration and anger he says I was I am
[1:33:13] younger than you so I held my peace to
[1:33:16] make sure you all had a chance to speak
[1:33:19] he says but now let me speak on behalf
[1:33:23] of my God
[1:33:26] who are you job
[1:33:28] and who is God
[1:33:30] and he begins to speak and it begins to
[1:33:32] testify of the power of God job in a
[1:33:36] time of trouble Joe in a time of serious
[1:33:39] situation everything around him has
[1:33:42] fallen down
[1:33:44] and he's sitting on an ash sheep
[1:33:46] in serious trouble
[1:33:50] the enemy has come in like a flood God
[1:33:53] comes along and he says job what is it
[1:33:57] what are the words he used stand up
[1:34:01] God came along when the enemy was in a
[1:34:03] flood and he said to you the Samaria
[1:34:06] stand up he said to you stand up the
[1:34:09] situation that you are in God has given
[1:34:12] the word and says job good yourself like
[1:34:14] a man and stand up for I have something
[1:34:16] to say to you amen I don't know if he
[1:34:19] uses the word stand directly but in the
[1:34:21] context stand up
[1:34:23] what did he what did God just do
[1:34:26] God came and gave job the faith to fight
[1:34:29] against the flood of the enemy
[1:34:31] you see God gives you what you need to
[1:34:34] fight the battle that God knows you can
[1:34:36] overcome
[1:34:41] I've mentioned it through the sermon but
[1:34:48] we read the story of Abraham and Sarah
[1:34:49] and I and I mentioned Hebrews 11 but I
[1:34:52] want to read it Hebrews 11 8 by faith
[1:34:55] Abraham when he was called to go out
[1:34:57] into a place which he should after
[1:34:58] receive for an inheritance obeyed and
[1:35:01] went out not knowing whether he went by
[1:35:04] faith he sojourned in the land of
[1:35:06] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[1:35:08] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:35:11] Heirs with him of the same promise for
[1:35:13] he looked for a city which hath
[1:35:16] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:35:18] gone
[1:35:19] through faith also Sarah herself
[1:35:22] receives strength to conceive seed and
[1:35:24] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:35:26] past Aid because she judged him faithful
[1:35:29] who had promised
[1:35:33] therefore spraying there even of one of
[1:35:35] him as good as dead
[1:35:37] so many as the stars of the sky and
[1:35:39] multitude and as a sand which is by the
[1:35:41] seashore innumerable these all died in
[1:35:44] faith not having received the promise
[1:35:47] but having seen them afar off were
[1:35:50] persuaded of them and embrace them and
[1:35:53] confess that they were strangers and
[1:35:55] pilgrims on the Earth
[1:35:57] for they they that said such things
[1:35:59] declare plainly that they seek a country
[1:36:02] and truly if they had been mindful of
[1:36:04] that country from whence they came out
[1:36:06] they might have had opportunity to have
[1:36:08] returned
[1:36:10] but now they desire a better country
[1:36:11] that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not
[1:36:14] ashamed to be called their God God is
[1:36:16] not ashamed to be identified with you
[1:36:19] right
[1:36:21] for he has prepared for you a city
[1:36:24] by faith Abraham when he was tried
[1:36:26] offered up Isaac that he had received
[1:36:29] the promises offered up his only
[1:36:30] begotten son of whom it was said then
[1:36:34] that in Isaac thy seed shall be called
[1:36:39] failed
[1:36:40] the second test
[1:36:42] Abraham
[1:36:43] conquered
[1:36:45] God puts Abraham through the same test
[1:36:48] again
[1:36:49] sacrifice your son
[1:36:51] but there's a difference between Abram
[1:36:54] and Abraham
[1:36:56] now watch what Abraham does
[1:36:59] he speaks the word
[1:37:01] Abram didn't speak the word to Sarah
[1:37:02] Abram didn't speak the word to Sarah he
[1:37:05] said sure I'll take Hagar
[1:37:08] Abraham
[1:37:10] said
[1:37:11] the boy and I shall go
[1:37:13] and we shall return
[1:37:17] Abraham said something God will provide
[1:37:20] a sacrifice
[1:37:23] Abraham
[1:37:26] had every intentions in his heart to
[1:37:29] strike Isaac through
[1:37:32] he he wasn't faking it you know you can
[1:37:35] fake it on the outside you can convince
[1:37:36] me
[1:37:37] but you can't fake it
[1:37:40] and convince God
[1:37:41] he sees your heart
[1:37:43] God knew Abraham's heart that's why God
[1:37:46] came and said Abraham don't kill Isaac
[1:37:50] because Abraham had every intentions of
[1:37:54] keeping God's word
[1:37:57] amen you're in a situation Isaac is on
[1:38:00] the altar before you
[1:38:06] God wants to see you keep his word
[1:38:10] jephthah mentioned in Hebrews 11.
[1:38:13] sacrificed his own daughter
[1:38:16] to keep the word what does that mean go
[1:38:18] sacrifice your kids no
[1:38:20] do not do that I will call the police on
[1:38:23] you
[1:38:25] but
[1:38:27] it means regardless of the situation
[1:38:30] keep God's word regardless of how hard
[1:38:35] it is keep God's word because when you
[1:38:39] do and when it drops into your heart
[1:38:42] when it drops into your heart and in
[1:38:45] your heart you have every intention and
[1:38:47] desire to keep God's word that's when
[1:38:50] God comes and gives you a lamb that's
[1:38:53] when God comes and gives you the victory
[1:38:55] because he wants to test your faith he
[1:38:58] loves to test your faith
[1:39:00] to identify why is he testing your faith
[1:39:02] because he said there's only one kind of
[1:39:04] people that can have this kind of faith
[1:39:08] and it's people who have me
[1:39:11] people who are identified what is the
[1:39:14] trying the trying of your faith and your
[1:39:17] Victory equals Christ in you amen
[1:39:21] Christ identified in you
[1:39:29] in closing John chapter 4.
[1:39:46] oh I guess I gave them the whole chapter
[1:39:48] but we won't need the whole chapter
[1:39:58] well you know what you go home and read
[1:39:59] John chapter 4.
[1:40:02] but in John chapter 4 we get
[1:40:08] the story of the woman at the well
[1:40:16] she was blocked by fear
[1:40:19] she had fear in her life
[1:40:23] fear was holding her bondage
[1:40:26] maybe there was a situation we don't
[1:40:29] know the back story
[1:40:32] because the backstory isn't always that
[1:40:33] important
[1:40:37] sometimes you don't need to know
[1:40:40] there is testimony but sometimes you
[1:40:42] don't need to know
[1:40:44] because God doesn't even remember it
[1:40:49] so she comes to the well at the time
[1:40:51] appointed for people like her
[1:40:53] and there's a man sitting there
[1:40:56] she thought okay another customer
[1:41:01] but this man was different
[1:41:07] God is Faith right
[1:41:12] so faith was sitting at the well
[1:41:18] if you haven't already you're going to
[1:41:19] go come to a place
[1:41:21] you're going to come to your well
[1:41:23] and Faith's going to be sitting there
[1:41:24] waiting for you
[1:41:28] see it's not up to you that's it it's
[1:41:31] not up to me
[1:41:32] God you didn't choose God God chose you
[1:41:37] it doesn't matter how dark situation
[1:41:39] doesn't matter anything
[1:41:42] you can she comes to the well and faith
[1:41:44] is sitting there waiting for her
[1:41:47] she begins to talk to Faith
[1:41:50] and Faith begins to what speak the word
[1:41:54] and faith says I have water
[1:41:57] where you'll never thirst again
[1:41:59] now watch her response
[1:42:03] man I'd love to have that
[1:42:06] I'd love to have that water
[1:42:09] how come she had the ability to do that
[1:42:13] with the Tim
[1:42:16] there was something inside of her
[1:42:20] there was something inside of her
[1:42:24] the day before if you saw her what would
[1:42:26] you think
[1:42:30] if you saw her how how would you view
[1:42:33] her would you call her a child of God
[1:42:35] would you call her sister
[1:42:39] if you had the ability to see inside of
[1:42:41] her you would that's right but we don't
[1:42:44] that person you saw yesterday
[1:42:48] maybe they're at their well today
[1:42:51] that person sitting in church this
[1:42:53] morning
[1:42:54] could be sitting at their well
[1:42:58] doesn't matter how pretty you look on
[1:43:00] the outside or how much you what you are
[1:43:03] on the outside
[1:43:04] inside your heart
[1:43:07] so she meets Faith at the well
[1:43:09] and Faith begins to tell her well you
[1:43:11] know what
[1:43:13] was what is faith
[1:43:15] revelation
[1:43:17] he begins to reveal to her who she is
[1:43:21] but he first has to address her sin
[1:43:25] there's no Victory till sin has been
[1:43:27] taken care of
[1:43:29] him first thing brother Bannon would do
[1:43:30] with the sinner well do you will you
[1:43:32] accept Christ
[1:43:33] then you would pray for them and God
[1:43:35] would heal them
[1:43:36] sin has to be taken care of so he
[1:43:38] identifies her sin
[1:43:40] he says no
[1:43:41] you've had five husbands and then what
[1:43:44] you're living with now is not your
[1:43:45] husband
[1:43:46] and she says this is true she admits
[1:43:50] fault
[1:43:53] she doesn't
[1:43:54] she admits fault and then God begins to
[1:43:56] say
[1:43:59] it begins to testify
[1:44:02] and she says
[1:44:04] you speak
[1:44:06] you speak
[1:44:08] you sound
[1:44:10] like the word amen
[1:44:13] Faith was speaking to see there was a
[1:44:16] deep
[1:44:17] calling to the Deep
[1:44:21] and there was a deep to respond
[1:44:23] faith begin to respond
[1:44:27] something in her heart was crying out do
[1:44:29] you know that was her worst day yet
[1:44:34] see how do you know that because that's
[1:44:36] how God works amen
[1:44:38] that was her worst day
[1:44:40] maybe that was the day she decided you
[1:44:42] know what I'm gonna go get my water
[1:44:44] I'm gonna go home
[1:44:46] and then I'm gonna go find somewhere to
[1:44:47] die
[1:44:49] that could have been that could have
[1:44:50] been her
[1:44:51] she could have been on her way to the
[1:44:52] well saying I'm gonna take my life today
[1:44:56] she could be on her way to the well
[1:44:57] saying you know what I give up
[1:44:59] this is it this is my life I guess I
[1:45:02] guess I'll just
[1:45:04] go on
[1:45:06] I guess I'll just live like this she
[1:45:08] gave up
[1:45:10] I have I have a sermon in my my archives
[1:45:13] titled give up the battle
[1:45:16] secret fighting
[1:45:18] she could try she quit trying to make
[1:45:19] herself better
[1:45:20] right and she just walked to the well
[1:45:24] do you realize her with her water pot
[1:45:28] walking through the streets at that time
[1:45:30] of day identified her as a prostitute
[1:45:34] everybody could see it
[1:45:37] everybody knew
[1:45:39] she walks to the well
[1:45:42] and because of who she is
[1:45:46] not who she's acting like
[1:45:49] not who you're acting like today but
[1:45:51] because of who you are
[1:45:56] Jesus of Nazareth they said but he was
[1:46:00] born in Bethlehem
[1:46:02] where were you born
[1:46:04] I'll tell you where you were born you
[1:46:05] were born in eternity
[1:46:07] actually you were all you always were
[1:46:12] and that seed inside of you is
[1:46:15] identifying this morning with faith at
[1:46:17] the well
[1:46:19] God says I will give you Everlasting
[1:46:22] water what opened the promise her faith
[1:46:25] opened the promise why because she was
[1:46:29] not born a slave that's right amen she
[1:46:32] was a child of Abraham
[1:46:35] she was a child of the free woman
[1:46:40] I don't know why I didn't think to write
[1:46:42] down that scripture where Paul talks
[1:46:44] about that but I didn't so you can find
[1:46:45] it later and read it that we are
[1:46:47] children of the free woman if the
[1:46:49] musicians want to come this morning
[1:46:52] and God has given us the ability why did
[1:46:55] I read that long quote God has given us
[1:46:57] the ability to do the same thing to look
[1:47:00] Beyond the Veil God brought him brother
[1:47:03] Branham here anointed him gave him that
[1:47:05] experience to testify to us
[1:47:08] that there is a place waiting for us
[1:47:11] a place that
[1:47:15] Place steadily
[1:47:18] replicate that P Ace but you can have
[1:47:20] that peace here
[1:47:23] today the world won't be like that but
[1:47:25] that peace can reside inside of you that
[1:47:28] perseverance can reside inside of you to
[1:47:32] keep pressing on
[1:47:35] will you play Winds of faith I don't
[1:47:36] sing that
[1:47:38] God has given you the faith to open the
[1:47:40] promise of his word
[1:47:43] you you see he brings the wind
[1:47:46] but how will you respond
[1:47:48] this morning he has brought the wind he
[1:47:51] said brother Chris you take much too
[1:47:53] much Liberty upon yourself I'm sorry I
[1:47:56] read the word
[1:47:58] the word was spoken I pray none of my
[1:48:01] opinion was opinion was mixed with it
[1:48:03] but when I read the word God said I'm
[1:48:06] gonna anoint a five-fold Ministry to
[1:48:09] speak
[1:48:11] so standing here with the word speaking
[1:48:14] God has spoke this morning
[1:48:16] and he's telling you faith is waiting at
[1:48:19] the well
[1:48:20] do you realize what that means Faith
[1:48:23] cometh by hearing the word of God
[1:48:27] she went to the well and she received
[1:48:30] her faith because she Drew from the word
[1:48:34] but God was waiting for her
[1:48:37] you say where is God
[1:48:39] where is God in my life my family
[1:48:41] situation is horrible Where's God in my
[1:48:43] life

[1:48:47] you what what am I supposed to do where
[1:48:49] are you you're looking for God in all
[1:48:51] the wrong places he's right here
[1:48:55] even in the long chapters of genealogies
[1:48:59] even in the scriptures the Leviticus
[1:49:01] going over the law that we don't fully
[1:49:03] understand sometimes God is here
[1:49:07] I challenge you
[1:49:09] to take your word your your Bible
[1:49:12] I challenge you tomorrow today
[1:49:16] go to prayer and I'm serious go to
[1:49:18] prayer say God this is my situation amen

[1:49:23] give me something to stand on
[1:49:29] and I guarantee you the saith the Lord
[1:49:32] you will find something
[1:49:36] you will open and you will find
[1:49:38] something but you have to take this hand
[1:49:41] this cursed flesh is good for something
[1:49:45] and open this Bible
[1:49:49] and begin to read
[1:49:52] both times just now I opened it to
[1:49:54] Isaiah did you know Isaiah is the entire
[1:49:57] book of the Bible in one entire Bible in
[1:49:59] one book
[1:50:02] God is waiting at the well
[1:50:06] praise the Lord Heavenly Father Lord
[1:50:09] Jesus we thank you for the word this
[1:50:11] morning Lord God if we could just
[1:50:14] realize
[1:50:15] and Lord we do
[1:50:18] a little bit here a little bit there
[1:50:20] we realize
[1:50:22] Who We Are
[1:50:24] but father the the statue of a perfect
[1:50:26] man we have to have faith in order to
[1:50:29] have virtue
[1:50:31] we'll have to have virtue in order to
[1:50:33] have knowledge and so on
[1:50:36] to get to you
[1:50:38] but God you're the one who starts it off
[1:50:40] because faith is revelation
[1:50:43] you are Faith
[1:50:45] Lord I pray you'd come this morning
[1:50:49] father you have identified
[1:50:52] your people this morning you've
[1:50:53] identified to them their situation some
[1:50:57] are Brokenhearted some are struggling
[1:51:00] but God you have identified their
[1:51:03] situation
[1:51:04] you've spoken I pray in their hearts
[1:51:08] they admitted
[1:51:10] they need help they admitted they've
[1:51:12] done wrong but God the story of the
[1:51:14] woman at the world does not end there
[1:51:16] it ends with her running and rejoicing
[1:51:19] Lord having been on both sides of the
[1:51:22] situation as I know many have this
[1:51:24] morning we can testify there's joy on
[1:51:27] the other side of this suffering
[1:51:29] there's joy on the other side of this
[1:51:31] situation if we can just do what we're
[1:51:33] called to do make that thing right God
[1:51:36] there is Joy waiting on the other side
[1:51:39] a joy that is unspeakable because we
[1:51:42] can't explain it
[1:51:44] we can't explain why there's joy in the
[1:51:46] face of adversity we can't explain why
[1:51:49] in David's heart there is joy and fear
[1:51:51] at the same time as he faced Goliath
[1:51:53] fear because he was a human and a man
[1:51:55] Joy because
[1:51:57] he was God's son
[1:52:00] God we are facing Giants we would have
[1:52:03] to put our head in the sand this morning
[1:52:04] to say we're not everybody's facing a
[1:52:08] Giants no matter how spiritually
[1:52:10] Advanced they are no matter how what
[1:52:13] their age is no matter how young they
[1:52:15] are they're facing Giants
[1:52:18] because the devil doesn't
[1:52:20] he's the devil's always going about
[1:52:23] seeking whom he may devour
[1:52:27] but God we will not be devoured
[1:52:30] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:52:33] but anything that may have been spoken
[1:52:35] that was my opinion I pray you'd remove
[1:52:37] that Lord I have no desire to preach
[1:52:40] what I think
