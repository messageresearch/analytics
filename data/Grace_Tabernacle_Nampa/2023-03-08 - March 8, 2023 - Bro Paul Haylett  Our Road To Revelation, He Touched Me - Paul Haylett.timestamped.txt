[32:27] so that way we'll we'll know and be able
[32:30] to plan uh a little quicker I haven't
[32:34] been very diligent kind of springing
[32:36] that on the people I want to get to
[32:38] where it's it's known out in advance and
[32:41] uh obviously we have things in life and
[32:45] circumstances so you know we never look
[32:47] down on those who can't make it but it
[32:49] is definitely my heart that everyone
[32:53] would be there and uh you know every
[32:55] time you go to write down prayer
[32:57] requests you know it's like you have a
[32:59] mental block
[33:00] and uh just uh sister Sue would like to
[33:04] be remembered Amen brother Dan is is
[33:07] doing better uh and uh I will boldly
[33:10] Proclaim that we call him brother we're
[33:12] claiming amen we never want to come his
[33:15] life the Lord just deals with us in
[33:17] certain ways and and I just uh I just
[33:21] you know the prophet of God said just
[33:23] make that Circle bigger anyway sister
[33:25] Sue desires to be remembered and give
[33:28] her strength I know brother Tim Sister
[33:30] Miriam have had quite a trip and of
[33:33] course uh
[33:35] um all the travel and stuff so let's
[33:37] remember our brother Tim Sister Miriam
[33:38] this evening I want to just take a
[33:41] moment if I may I see brother Titus
[33:44] sitting here on the front row and I pray
[33:46] that there'll be many many services that
[33:49] we see him there and our sister Donna I
[33:52] just uh you know sometimes jokingly but
[33:55] you don't want to be misunderstood it's
[33:57] like you're in the wrong seat move up
[33:59] move up
[34:01] and I was just thinking tonight our dear
[34:03] sister vika here she is playing so
[34:06] beautifully a gift that God's given her
[34:08] and I'm thankful and to sum that off I
[34:12] would like to just say I am very pleased
[34:14] to see our sister
[34:16] back at the piano
[34:18] she give many years to this little body
[34:23] of Believers and and I have I don't want
[34:27] people to be shocked people always
[34:29] misunderstood sometimes it seems like
[34:31] they want to be but I just love Sister
[34:33] Sarah she's always just
[34:35] Captain even Keel I don't know how she
[34:38] is at home
[34:39] but
[34:43] but she's always just been so willing
[34:46] and I I just want to say thank you now
[34:48] and thank you for the future amen
[34:51] because when we had
[34:54] very limited resources Our Sister Sarah
[34:57] stepped up and God's blessed us I mean
[34:59] look at what's happened we have three
[35:01] four five brothers that can lead songs
[35:03] and we have uh uh I'd have stopped to do
[35:07] the math so we'll just say uh many
[35:09] gifted musicians in the church already
[35:12] and rising up and I don't know maybe I'm
[35:15] feeling sentimental tonight but I just
[35:17] say thank you Lord
[35:19] for the blessings that you're raining
[35:21] down upon us and so let's just turn to
[35:24] the word tonight thank you so much our
[35:26] musicians and I just have to say to
[35:28] brother Chris as maybe a more willing I
[35:31] don't get sidetracked and we express
[35:32] this but uh just some things that just
[35:35] really touched my heart in the song
[35:37] service tonight let's just stand go into
[35:39] the word of God and to Mark the eighth
[35:42] chapter but I want to speak to you on
[35:45] our journey because this is what we're
[35:46] in my brother and sister this is not a
[35:48] Sprint
[35:49] amen and this is not a relay we don't
[35:52] get a hand it off to someone else as it
[35:54] were and we stop running but this is a
[35:57] journey that we're on and I want to take
[35:59] this out of Mark the eighth chapter
[36:01] tonight our road to revelation
[36:04] he touched me and uh along the way I
[36:08] just pray uh this will this will
[36:11] um
[36:12] all tied together amen
[36:17] Mark 8 and 22
[36:19] now I want you to catch this right above
[36:23] this Marcus
[36:25] giving us the account
[36:28] of the fishes and the loaves
[36:30] of the crowds
[36:32] and the disciples are
[36:36] Jesus is interacting with them and and
[36:38] he can tell they they don't get it
[36:41] and uh if you just go back there and
[36:43] you'll read you'll see that Jesus is
[36:46] speaking pretty straight to them
[36:48] basically saying you know what you're
[36:51] not figuring this out you're not seeing
[36:54] the big picture and then there's a
[36:56] little shift right here moving from the
[36:59] 21st verse to the 22nd and it says and
[37:02] he cometh to Bethesda and they bring a
[37:05] blind man unto him
[37:07] and besought him to touch him
[37:10] and he took the blind man by the hand
[37:13] and led him out of the town and when he
[37:16] had spit on his eyes and put his hands
[37:19] upon him he asked him if he saw ought
[37:24] and he looked up and said I see men as
[37:27] trees walking
[37:30] after that he put his hands again upon
[37:33] his eyes and made him look up
[37:35] and he was restored and saw every man
[37:39] clearly
[37:40] and he sent him away to his house saying
[37:43] neither go into the town nor tell it to
[37:47] any in the town
[37:49] and then we see in verse 27 that Jesus
[37:54] then moves on and goes to caesarea
[37:57] Philippe and it's there that he's
[37:59] talking to the disciples
[38:01] and he asked them
[38:03] who do men say that I am Heavenly Father
[38:05] we thank you Lord today your grace and
[38:08] mercy Lord just to be able to rise up
[38:12] by Revelation Lord and press into the
[38:16] mark of the High Calling to Lord be able
[38:19] to press through the the darkness and
[38:22] the oppression of this day and
[38:24] father just as we saw this afternoon a
[38:28] storm rolled through and it got very
[38:30] dark and very windy and very cloudy Lord
[38:34] over us
[38:36] and uh
[38:38] on the drive to church Lord here we are
[38:40] trying to take a picture
[38:42] of such a beautiful sunset
[38:45] because your word said it would be light
[38:49] in the evening time
[38:51] father let the darkness the storms of
[38:54] life fall behind us as we look at the
[38:56] promise
[38:57] that we come into the evening time and
[39:00] to the bride of Christ your wife
[39:04] it will be light in the evening time
[39:07] we thank you for that Lord thank you for
[39:10] speaking to our hearts we thank you for
[39:13] your word a life-changing word guide us
[39:16] tonight we pray bless each one in your
[39:19] name amen you may be seated
[39:28] as we look at this we'll see tonight a
[39:31] blind man being brought to our lord
[39:33] Jesus
[39:35] now when you think about that uh a blind
[39:37] man what a need my brother and sister
[39:40] you know it is such that that we have
[39:43] become so uh familiar as it were from
[39:47] birth to be able to see and here here is
[39:50] one who does not see cannot see and uh
[39:54] you know it is something that's just
[39:57] hard to imagine but you know if you have
[40:00] like myself and I I just use it for you
[40:03] might say example or analogy uh when you
[40:06] have one that has a poor natural
[40:09] eyesight you know uh uh I I thought
[40:12] everybody struggled to read the
[40:14] chalkboard in school and I've been
[40:16] wearing glasses since I was 13 years old
[40:18] and and I know that's not too younger
[40:21] there's intermitts that face a similar
[40:24] thing but you you tend to kind of morph
[40:28] into a position where you you know your
[40:30] eyesight is something that's important
[40:32] to you and here is a man being brought
[40:35] wrong no doubt my brother and sister are
[40:37] these who brought him or were concerned
[40:39] to bring him to Jesus cared for him it
[40:43] doesn't say in the scripture that they
[40:45] were critics looking for some kind of a
[40:47] miracle to or lack of or whatever to
[40:50] criticize but I just take this as
[40:53] someone who loved this man and wanted
[40:55] them him to come to Jesus and ask him to
[41:00] touch him besought him that's a fervent
[41:03] request and and uh to to just touch this
[41:06] man they weren't needing of some great
[41:09] example of some kind of testimony some
[41:12] kind of recital of the great things they
[41:15] already were convinced and they're
[41:17] bringing this and asking and my brother
[41:20] and sister it is uh just a touch and
[41:24] we'll think about this for just a moment
[41:26] if I may just a touch is all they were
[41:29] asking there was maybe other infirmities
[41:32] maybe not but we'll look at this this
[41:35] and realize that all they were searching
[41:37] for was just a touch from our lord Jesus
[41:41] and I would say tonight if in this midst
[41:44] of this building tonight we have any
[41:46] kind of a need we should be saying Lord
[41:48] I just need a touch tonight just touch
[41:52] me tonight Lord I I have this need
[41:55] and the prophet of God in studying for
[41:57] this thought you know he's talking about
[41:59] that it's not just about the physical
[42:02] need it's not just that maybe one needs
[42:05] a touch in their body or touching their
[42:07] eyesight but God come and touch us in
[42:10] our spirit touch us right down to the
[42:12] depths of our souls that we can respond
[42:15] to the word and find life being restored
[42:18] and I just felt very moved as I studied
[42:22] this now my brother and sister we see
[42:25] that all through the Bible all through
[42:28] the message that we see the example of
[42:31] God bringing us to a place of Separation
[42:33] we'll look at Abraham for just a moment
[42:36] my brother and sister he was commanded
[42:39] of God it was not a request it was not a
[42:42] suggestion he was commanded of God to
[42:44] separate himself from his family but yet
[42:47] we'll see how that lot was there when it
[42:51] All Shook out that no doubt they thought
[42:54] you know who's going to take care who's
[42:56] going to care for for him and they took
[42:59] him along and my brother and sister
[43:01] sometimes we have little things like
[43:04] that that we take along with us when God
[43:06] has asked us for a separation and you
[43:09] know it's difficult sometimes because
[43:11] they can be emotional ties they can be
[43:14] as it were physical ties but we look at
[43:17] this and sometimes you might say I've
[43:19] seen this in in in my time that people
[43:22] actually have spiritual ties back to a
[43:25] certain time and place in their life and
[43:27] that's good but if the foundation or the
[43:30] tie there is not beneficial for their
[43:32] spiritual walk today it's not a tie it's
[43:35] an anchor
[43:36] and God doesn't want us to be anchored
[43:39] so he calls us my brother and sister
[43:40] while we are called to be a part of a
[43:43] body of Believers right Grace Tabernacle
[43:45] God is calling us into a separation in
[43:49] other words our relationship with him
[43:51] should not be dependent on this person
[43:54] or that person but we are called into a
[43:57] separate relationship with our Lord
[43:59] Jesus Christ and we walk in that
[44:01] relationship and then in our time of
[44:04] need we don't run to the pastor we run
[44:07] to this manner to that one we run to the
[44:09] Lord amen and that's what God is trying
[44:12] or wanting to train us to do is that he
[44:16] becomes our first place of Refuge or
[44:19] first place of counsel amen and so God
[44:24] comes down and in moving here Jesus he
[44:27] he doesn't he could have just laid hands
[44:29] on him right there at that place
[44:30] declared him healed and he would have
[44:33] been healed right I that's the power of
[44:36] our Lord Jesus Christ but it was there
[44:38] that God is now laying an example and he
[44:41] takes this man and takes him by the hand
[44:44] amen which in that there's a sign or
[44:47] example of guidance and it's there that
[44:51] he now is becoming this Man's Guide
[44:55] he's not just there to speak words over
[44:57] him but he's imparting something much
[45:00] deeper than natural eyesight he is
[45:03] imparting guidance to this man and so he
[45:07] takes him not there into the city park
[45:09] and not into the the uh um oh what do
[45:13] you call it in the middle of the town
[45:14] the plaza he's not taking him into that
[45:16] area he takes him out of town my brother
[45:19] and sister he's bringing this man into a
[45:23] place of total separation
[45:27] um not dependent on his friends rallying
[45:30] yes believe believe
[45:33] but he takes him entirely out to a total
[45:36] separation and this man doesn't say what
[45:39] are you doing and why aren't you just
[45:41] praying for me he is in a place in total
[45:45] separation of total submission
[45:49] wherever Jesus led him he was following
[45:52] oh I say Lord help us help us Lord that
[45:56] we can come to a place of total
[45:58] submission to follow him
[46:01] and you know he takes him out of the
[46:03] Town into this place of separation and
[46:07] you know no doubt there would have been
[46:09] negative Spirits there no doubt there
[46:11] would have been Spectators there maybe
[46:13] what you would call the religious
[46:15] sightseers the ones that you know were
[46:18] if I could see a sign I could believe
[46:20] well my brother and sister it's very
[46:22] clear that if people would see the Lord
[46:26] Jesus Christ today if they don't believe
[46:28] his word they wouldn't believe if he was
[46:31] standing here in their midst they would
[46:34] still find fault or find a reason to not
[46:38] follow a reason to not submit to the
[46:41] word
[46:44] so he leads him away from the negative
[46:46] from the religious as it were the sight
[46:49] seers
[46:50] you see
[46:52] not to take too long tonight I I just
[46:55] kept trying to prune this back but you
[46:57] see the Lord Works in unconventional
[46:59] ways when I say unconventional they're
[47:02] actually the normal they're the real
[47:06] they're the absolute they're the
[47:08] supernatural but man has got his idea
[47:11] into religion and he has now molded
[47:14] religion to where when God works it's
[47:16] unconventional
[47:18] and you tie these words together and
[47:20] you'll find that even the word uh
[47:23] heretical
[47:25] is that did I pronounce heretical
[47:29] man's way is now declaring God's way
[47:32] heretical
[47:35] now think about that
[47:37] it should be what God you are declaring
[47:40] your way but man has come in such a
[47:42] concept that they now declare the work
[47:45] of God the supernatural to be strange
[47:48] it's it's out of the ordinary out of the
[47:51] it's not normal
[47:52] I want to know what is normal
[47:55] my brother and sister I don't mean to
[47:57] mock but I want to tell you more and
[47:59] more we see people with tattoos we're
[48:01] talking about extensive tattoos and and
[48:05] people are complimenting on their body
[48:07] art
[48:10] my brother and sister that is defiling
[48:13] the Temple of the Holy Ghost that is
[48:16] against the word of God and yet it's now
[48:19] becoming considered a form of art to
[48:22] deface this body
[48:24] my how clever Satan is
[48:28] so God working in the unconventional
[48:32] how unconventional will God be
[48:36] he will lead a blind man
[48:41] from the town
[48:44] to a place there's a very limited
[48:47] and these Witnesses would be considered
[48:51] not very dependable
[48:58] come on look out the church look how the
[49:00] Temple look how the priests looked at
[49:02] the disciples
[49:04] their testimony is not dependable
[49:08] yet our Lord Jesus Christ leads them
[49:11] from any other witness that they would
[49:15] be and he brings them out here outside
[49:17] of the town and I'm telling you this is
[49:20] getting really unconventional because he
[49:22] spits in his eyes
[49:26] come on brothers and sisters I I don't
[49:28] mean to try and make humor out of this
[49:30] but if you come up here and said I have
[49:33] this need and the preacher starts
[49:35] spitting on you you're going to be going
[49:37] what is going on here
[49:39] and there is something that is there's
[49:41] nothing through the Scrolls imagine if
[49:44] there had been Witnesses they'd have
[49:45] been rolling the Torah out they would
[49:47] have been trying and do we have any
[49:49] history at all of this there's nothing
[49:53] but God didn't care because he was the
[49:55] one who wanted the witnesses to be his
[49:57] Witnesses not Witnesses of the church
[50:00] not Witnesses of religion of a sect or a
[50:03] certain group or of the critic he wanted
[50:06] the witnesses to be true Witnesses and
[50:09] it's there that he takes this man
[50:10] outside of this city and he is there and
[50:13] spits in his eyes and I'm telling you my
[50:15] brother and sister that's so unorthodox
[50:17] that even we right now tonight look at
[50:20] that and go oh my
[50:22] but that was God's approach that was
[50:25] God's answer of this time right now my
[50:28] brother and sister to deal with a blind
[50:30] man and he spits on his eyes and he
[50:33] spits there into his eyes as a word and
[50:36] you know what he he is there it's like
[50:39] look
[50:40] who would ever think that that would be
[50:42] an Avenue or a route to healing but my
[50:45] brother and sister I'm telling you here
[50:47] was a man that had come to a place I
[50:49] don't believe he was just looking for
[50:51] healing I believe he was looking not in
[50:54] in the flesh but he was looking for
[50:56] another kind of healing he was looking
[50:58] for a restoration that something down in
[51:00] the soul was saying there's got to be an
[51:03] answer to the questions I have well why
[51:06] am I here why do I exist what is God's
[51:08] plan for my life and here it is
[51:11] unfolding
[51:13] and it's so unorthodox one would say
[51:15] there's no way that could be healing
[51:18] brother Branham says in the message
[51:23] yes please
[51:26] perseverant
[51:29] God is Supernatural can we say Amen
[51:32] you don't scientifically prove God you
[51:35] believe God you believe it if you don't
[51:37] believe it then a man that says
[51:39] everything that's not scientifically is
[51:41] unorthodox it's not right
[51:44] come on I hope you're catching this
[51:46] connection right here they're coming
[51:48] down the church says we have an Avenue
[51:51] and when the Messiah comes these things
[51:54] will take place but this is not the
[51:57] Messiah so they cut him out of the
[51:59] equation and there they're looking now
[52:01] for some kind of Avenue that fits their
[52:04] plan and God says you know what you're
[52:07] not going to be able to prove this by
[52:09] any plan I'm going to spit in this man's
[52:11] Vine I'm going to wipe that saliva
[52:13] around his eye and you won't be able
[52:16] scientifically to prove how thou will
[52:18] bring healing but here is a man so
[52:21] submitted oh God let us come to this so
[52:24] submitted that Lord however you want to
[52:26] bring Deliverance in my life whether it
[52:29] can be in my own prayer time
[52:33] I'm looking for a great preacher to come
[52:36] and I'm sorry I haven't been inviting
[52:38] very many
[52:41] and if that's the time my faith would
[52:43] rise up I'm going to ask you do you not
[52:46] have faith in the prayers that you were
[52:47] praying to our god to our Lord Jesus
[52:50] Christ we should have that kind of faith
[52:53] in the very words that come from our
[52:55] lips Lord you know my needs you know my
[52:57] heart you know my family you know my
[52:59] health you know my circumstance Lord I
[53:01] Believe You're My Healer you're my
[53:03] provider you're my deliverer I believe
[53:05] it
[53:07] sorry I'm getting strident
[53:10] but it's just my hearts it's just
[53:11] leaping
[53:14] everything that's not scientifically is
[53:17] unorthodox it's not right then that man
[53:20] can never be a Christian
[53:24] pretty straightforward isn't it if we
[53:26] got to come to the place we need some
[53:28] other thing
[53:30] remember the man that stood before
[53:32] brother Phantom I believe that was in in
[53:33] Houston or Dallas Texas
[53:37] and says you know we can cut the baby
[53:39] you heal it
[53:41] prophet of God said that man ain't even
[53:43] a Christian
[53:45] needs something that's so
[53:48] you know prove it to me
[53:51] now I don't want to deviate off into
[53:53] that but I've had people look me in the
[53:55] face and say that's what you believe in
[53:57] the message prove it to me
[53:59] and you know I I would go home sister
[54:02] Jerry which you don't like me saying
[54:04] you're my witness but she was the
[54:05] witness there go home and I'm like I
[54:07] don't even know how I couldn't even
[54:09] speak
[54:11] and you realize God was binding you
[54:13] because if we have to come and we have
[54:17] to prove
[54:19] we have to prove what faith is how can
[54:22] you do that
[54:23] how can you prove what Revelation is you
[54:27] can't do that those are gifts from God
[54:31] we cannot come and scientifically prove
[54:34] a gift from God
[54:37] he has to believe by faith we believe
[54:40] God not by education not by theology but
[54:43] by faith ye are saved
[54:45] notice
[54:47] Faith finds a source that others don't
[54:49] see
[54:51] now hope you kind of catch really why I
[54:54] kind of chose this quote
[54:57] because we can have perfect natural
[54:59] eyesight and not see
[55:03] we can be blind as a bat outside of the
[55:07] Physical Realm spiritual realm blind is
[55:09] a bat
[55:15] faith
[55:17] finds
[55:19] the source
[55:24] his word is a sword Hebrews 4 12 said
[55:27] not the word of God is sharper than
[55:29] two-edged sword even discerns the
[55:31] thoughts it's intents that's in the
[55:33] heart that's the word of God and the
[55:35] only thing that can hold that sword is
[55:38] the hand of faith
[55:40] look at how this comes together so much
[55:42] you know a weak Christian they don't
[55:45] tend to act on the word they'll believe
[55:47] it but they don't tend to act on the
[55:48] word because they haven't built up to
[55:51] that yet you know they're they're
[55:52] getting strengthened by the by the
[55:54] preaching of the word by the eating of
[55:57] the book they're getting strengthened
[55:59] until the day or the season comes just
[56:02] like we would not take in the days of
[56:04] old a child and give them a giant spear
[56:08] or a giant sword and send them into
[56:10] battle because they're not seasoned in
[56:12] the art of warfare and that's why even
[56:15] when the scripture talks about pastors
[56:17] Ministry that you don't want novice
[56:19] right now we all have to start somewhere
[56:21] so we don't want to get critical in the
[56:23] age factor and say Well they're not old
[56:25] enough not enough experience but that to
[56:27] put that in a leadership role you know
[56:30] God says don't let a novice do that
[56:32] because when it comes to Warfare my
[56:34] brother and sister right as many would
[56:36] have faced Samson
[56:40] turns out they were all novices in their
[56:42] Warfare
[56:45] Samson didn't need a giant sword and a
[56:48] giant Shield
[56:50] he just needed
[56:52] to believe
[56:55] and when he picked up that
[56:57] Jawbone of that donkey
[56:59] he didn't Stomp and scientifically say
[57:01] this jawbone's bleached white it's got
[57:04] the strength
[57:05] maybe I should just grab this weed over
[57:07] here it'll be strong as this Jawbone
[57:11] he didn't prove that that way
[57:13] he just took what was provided
[57:16] started slaying the enemy
[57:19] but a less experienced man would have
[57:21] said I don't have the tools to fight the
[57:23] enemy right now
[57:25] I need to just run
[57:26] I'll run away from this battle I'll run
[57:28] away from this experience I'll run away
[57:30] from this circumstance but God says no I
[57:32] don't want you to run I want you to
[57:34] believe and I want you to stand
[57:36] and as we look at this my brother and
[57:38] sister
[57:39] sharper Discerning thoughts intents of
[57:42] the heart that's the word of God and the
[57:44] only thing that can hold that sword is
[57:46] the hand of faith and nothing else can
[57:48] do it nothing else you have to see
[57:50] something otherwise scientific you
[57:53] scientifically educationally you cannot
[57:56] hold that sword and we'll look at this
[57:59] and realize what it is you can't do it
[58:01] by education it's too Twisted too
[58:04] complicated you'll make it it'll make it
[58:06] it'll try to deny itself in everything
[58:09] and you know I I would just was reading
[58:11] a little literature and it's one thing I
[58:14] do believe that we need to make sure our
[58:16] young people understand well maybe
[58:18] everyone understands but you look at
[58:20] this and I was reading a a little deal
[58:23] and the man's you know here is a grown
[58:25] educated man saying we really can't
[58:28] explain the Trinity but we just believe
[58:31] it is so
[58:34] um
[58:35] and the question that was lobbied back
[58:37] to him where is that in the Bible
[58:39] Matthew 28 19 I don't care how you turn
[58:43] that upside down you don't find Trinity
[58:45] there
[58:46] and you don't find anyone with a
[58:49] testimony that they acted on that
[58:54] but Satan planted the seed men anointed
[58:58] to water it
[59:00] even so much today that there's various
[59:02] things on the face of the Earth that if
[59:04] you don't believe the Trinity you can't
[59:06] even be a part of this
[59:08] some of the health care programs that
[59:10] they promote you know the the Christian
[59:12] Health Care Ministries Etc good programs
[59:15] right but they put it as a requirement
[59:17] to belong to that that you would hold to
[59:21] the Trinity my what's health care and a
[59:24] false Doctrine got to do together well
[59:26] it comes down to a Time
[59:28] of inclusion or exclusion
[59:31] it really is that simple
[59:33] and so it's way too complicated you make
[59:36] it it make it it tried to deny itself
[59:38] and everything you cannot do it Jesus
[59:41] said it's hid from you so forget about
[59:43] it you cannot know it it's hid and when
[59:46] God hides anything it's really hidden
[59:50] wow I'm telling you tonight Saints the
[59:53] reason I bring this out in this fashion
[59:54] I want you to realize as we are sitting
[59:58] here tonight amen this blind man being
[1:00:01] led God came and he has led you and I to
[1:00:05] the place that he has applied now South
[1:00:08] will call it to our eyes that we're able
[1:00:11] to see and without him oh let's just go
[1:00:13] back and name it like it is without him
[1:00:15] spitting and wiping that in our eyes we
[1:00:19] would never see we might have perfect
[1:00:22] eyesight in the natural but our soul
[1:00:25] would be blind to the word of God
[1:00:27] tonight has come my brother and sister
[1:00:29] and it is here that we stand in the
[1:00:32] presence of almighty God he has led us
[1:00:34] by the hand Can someone say Amen he's
[1:00:37] led us out of Darkness he's led us out
[1:00:40] of deception he's led us out of all
[1:00:42] these isms and schisms and led us out to
[1:00:45] a place and said you know what I'm going
[1:00:47] to open your eyes for you I'm going to
[1:00:49] touch you I'm going to affect your life
[1:00:52] in such a fashion that when you have
[1:00:55] your eyes open my brother and sister it
[1:00:57] is just a startling thing you know that
[1:01:00] when your eyes have been opened
[1:01:03] I'm talking about real Christians no
[1:01:06] matter how hard Satan tries he cannot
[1:01:08] close them
[1:01:09] he cannot bring you back to darkness no
[1:01:12] matter how hard he tries he cannot take
[1:01:15] you back and we are eternally grateful
[1:01:18] that our Lord has come let us out of the
[1:01:21] multitude of the town of city of the
[1:01:23] critics of all the false witness and let
[1:01:26] us out into a small might say group or
[1:01:29] small what to come and let us
[1:01:32] see
[1:01:35] the prophet of God once again speaking
[1:01:38] it's not just about natural my brother
[1:01:40] and sister
[1:01:41] but even speaks to them
[1:01:44] of let it take place now in the
[1:01:48] spiritual
[1:01:49] we have needs
[1:01:51] but our greatest need that we have
[1:01:54] is in the spiritual
[1:01:57] it is not to solve this problem or solve
[1:02:00] that problem if we took that problem to
[1:02:02] our grave or took that problem to the
[1:02:04] Rapture I say thank you Lord but let the
[1:02:07] eyesight let the ears let the
[1:02:09] understanding be set forth by our Lord
[1:02:12] Jesus Christ amen not to be walking
[1:02:15] through this life perfectly healthy and
[1:02:17] blind to the word of God if it be vice
[1:02:20] versa I say let it be so that we would
[1:02:23] see him as he is
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:26] so we see how that this is coming to
[1:02:28] pass and it's
[1:02:31] blind man is being led
[1:02:33] but do you realize as you read this
[1:02:35] scripture that Jesus was also leading
[1:02:37] the disciples
[1:02:39] because behind this he takes them
[1:02:43] and he asks them
[1:02:45] who do men say that I am
[1:02:48] now it's pretty easy my brother and
[1:02:50] sister to stand here and say well the
[1:02:52] prophet said
[1:02:55] come on I'm not trying to make any you
[1:02:57] know big political type point but it's
[1:03:00] real easy to say the prophet said but
[1:03:02] Jesus Narrows this down in other words
[1:03:04] he said everything else aside he looked
[1:03:07] you and I in the face as he looked the
[1:03:09] disciples in the face who do you say I
[1:03:12] am and my brother and sister
[1:03:14] unfortunately this is the hour we're
[1:03:16] living in many people can look to this
[1:03:18] and say well the prophet said but it's
[1:03:21] hard for them to come and face who they
[1:03:24] themselves say
[1:03:26] where do I stand can we just put it that
[1:03:29] blood where do I stand in the message
[1:03:33] because this message my brother and
[1:03:34] sister you know I've just gave up trying
[1:03:37] to make the point this message is Jesus
[1:03:39] Christ you know understand please
[1:03:41] understand the message we believe is
[1:03:43] Jesus Christ I'm here to say tonight
[1:03:45] this message is Jesus Christ period not
[1:03:49] another alternative to be to to be uh
[1:03:53] explained or dissected or or woven in my
[1:03:56] brother and sister if we don't see that
[1:03:59] this message is the word of God our Lord
[1:04:02] Jesus Christ tonight we got to go back
[1:04:04] to square one right we're teaching
[1:04:06] algebra to people that can't even figure
[1:04:09] anything out amen it won't work it won't
[1:04:13] work and as the last of this quote is
[1:04:15] you can't do it by education
[1:04:17] too Twisted too complicated
[1:04:21] how do you reconcile Acts 2 38 and
[1:04:24] Matthew 28 19 if you believe in the
[1:04:26] trinity
[1:04:31] but our understanding
[1:04:34] of the godhead should be solid enough
[1:04:37] but we can look in the word
[1:04:39] now we hear all of these well you know
[1:04:41] it's a father son yes all of that fits
[1:04:45] together that's lovely
[1:04:47] but if they're blind
[1:04:50] that goes right by them
[1:04:53] all of that is just like no no you're
[1:04:55] not getting it you're not getting it
[1:04:56] just goes right by
[1:04:59] when the eyes have been opened
[1:05:04] I don't care what you have on your hand
[1:05:06] Lord
[1:05:06] just touch me
[1:05:11] spiritual revelation
[1:05:13] maybe it comes with correction first
[1:05:16] maybe it comes with a time of
[1:05:18] consecration maybe it comes with a time
[1:05:20] of restoration maybe it comes with
[1:05:22] whatever God chooses for it to come with
[1:05:24] but Lord what I'm looking for is your
[1:05:27] hand to touch me and open my eyes and
[1:05:30] open my ears because I want to see you
[1:05:34] and I don't want you to see you what I
[1:05:36] think you are I want to see you as you
[1:05:37] are
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:40] but look at this disciples a blind man
[1:05:42] being led disciples being led
[1:05:45] and it wasn't just this Blind Man's eyes
[1:05:48] my brother and sister that we're being
[1:05:50] open to the supernatural
[1:05:52] God was educating if you want to call it
[1:05:54] we just talked about not being education
[1:05:56] so I just use that as a phrase God is
[1:05:59] educating the disciples he's he's
[1:06:01] instructing he's showing them how the
[1:06:04] power of the word can come and be
[1:06:06] absolute life-changing
[1:06:11] imagine you just saw fishes and Loaves
[1:06:16] and you walked away and said wow that's
[1:06:18] that was incredible and that's all you
[1:06:20] got out of it
[1:06:23] come on my brother and sister
[1:06:25] we understand by the word of God that
[1:06:27] many people went away from there that
[1:06:30] day and all they were there for was the
[1:06:32] fishes and the loaves they they were
[1:06:34] there to be blessed
[1:06:37] and walked away
[1:06:39] with no revelation
[1:06:41] but here's a man if I could imply it
[1:06:43] this way here's a man who is blind and
[1:06:46] he willingly follows Jesus out of the
[1:06:49] town and when Jesus spits and wipes a
[1:06:52] spittle in his eyes and his eyes then
[1:06:56] are affected but I want you to catch
[1:06:59] this I hope you catch this whole
[1:07:00] spiritual picture his eyes are affected
[1:07:03] and when Jesus asked him if he can see
[1:07:05] he says yes I can I can see Acts 2 38.
[1:07:11] I I conceive yes I can see this I can
[1:07:15] see this
[1:07:16] but when he is asked if he can see it
[1:07:19] clearly he says no I see men as though
[1:07:22] they were trees walking
[1:07:26] very very indistinct understanding
[1:07:31] but look where it is my brother and
[1:07:32] sister let's not ever mock that because
[1:07:34] that's an improvement from where it was
[1:07:37] and the man had the honesty I hope you
[1:07:39] follow me the man had the honesty to say
[1:07:42] I'm not seeing it I'm not seeing it
[1:07:44] clearly I can't see what you're talking
[1:07:47] about but then in that expression Jesus
[1:07:51] doesn't say well that's all the
[1:07:53] Revelation I'm going to give you for
[1:07:55] this day for this age for your spiritual
[1:07:58] walk know what I'm going to do is I'm
[1:08:00] going to touch you again I'm going to
[1:08:02] touch you again and when I touch you I'm
[1:08:05] asking you now what do you see and he's
[1:08:08] there in the natural saying I see it
[1:08:11] clearly
[1:08:12] but look at this in the spiritual realm
[1:08:14] God coming I want to say tonight Lord I
[1:08:18] Thank you tonight I lift my hand and I
[1:08:20] thank you tonight that Lord you didn't
[1:08:22] just touch me once or twice you've been
[1:08:25] touching me over and over and over and
[1:08:27] over Through The Years in my time of
[1:08:30] Despair in my time of need in my time of
[1:08:33] desperation you're there touching me
[1:08:37] and all I can see now I cannot see the
[1:08:40] help of this world I cannot see the
[1:08:42] wealth of this world I cannot see the
[1:08:45] influence of this world I don't care
[1:08:47] about all their influencer and their
[1:08:49] scheme all I can see is Jesus Christ
[1:08:52] because he's been touching me
[1:08:55] every day after day after day
[1:08:58] oh life changing
[1:09:01] oh I'll tell you what it
[1:09:03] it causes me off thinking about this as
[1:09:05] I study and I was thinking about this
[1:09:07] the song when he reached down his hand
[1:09:09] for me
[1:09:11] he didn't come and say Hey you over
[1:09:13] there just come the direction of my
[1:09:15] voice
[1:09:16] no sir he come as it were literally
[1:09:21] and took him by the hand
[1:09:24] you know it's so interesting
[1:09:28] as a child I used to have nightmares
[1:09:32] actually
[1:09:34] partner every night
[1:09:37] and it was the same nightmare
[1:09:40] for years
[1:09:42] and if you want to be creeped out I'll
[1:09:44] tell you about it
[1:09:48] because up until the time I was probably
[1:09:50] 15 years old it was the same
[1:09:53] nightmare
[1:09:54] it wasn't a swamp monster
[1:10:00] it wasn't of this or of that
[1:10:03] it was something that brought absolute
[1:10:06] tip
[1:10:07] to my heart
[1:10:09] and I'd wake up in the middle of the
[1:10:11] night scream
[1:10:13] and my mama
[1:10:15] would walk in the room
[1:10:18] sit down on the bed and take me by the
[1:10:21] hand
[1:10:24] that's the last thing I remember
[1:10:28] because I
[1:10:30] was in a place of peace and comfort
[1:10:33] I was in a place that my mom was here
[1:10:37] and I did have my mama tell me some
[1:10:39] years later
[1:10:41] I was just getting sick and tired of you
[1:10:43] doing that
[1:10:45] I was ready for you to grow up
[1:10:48] but you see I couldn't help
[1:10:51] I couldn't help that I didn't go to bed
[1:10:53] at night thinking I'm going to have this
[1:10:55] just horrible nightmare and I'm going to
[1:10:57] scream to the top of my lungs until my
[1:11:00] mama comes
[1:11:02] no
[1:11:03] but it was something that came
[1:11:07] but when he touched me
[1:11:12] the nightmare of who I was
[1:11:14] and why I was here
[1:11:16] and where my life was going
[1:11:19] faded away
[1:11:22] because there was peace and comfort
[1:11:26] I believe this all being lumped together
[1:11:28] by Mark all this the bread the fish in
[1:11:32] the loaves
[1:11:33] this blind man
[1:11:35] going to caesarea Felipe and and doing
[1:11:38] this all being lumped together right
[1:11:40] there one right after the other my
[1:11:42] brother and sister I believe that our
[1:11:44] lord Jesus was actually preparing while
[1:11:47] he blessed this man with his natural
[1:11:49] sight and I believe a spiritual touch
[1:11:51] also he's preparing the disciples to
[1:11:54] come to a showdown that they themselves
[1:11:57] need to see they themselves have to come
[1:12:00] to a place they see it for themselves no
[1:12:03] longer just Jesus speaking to them and
[1:12:06] then we still see the lapse
[1:12:09] after
[1:12:10] his crucifixion
[1:12:13] the lapse of
[1:12:15] how did this happen why did this happen
[1:12:17] what is going on but yet he had preached
[1:12:20] it to them saints
[1:12:23] could it be that we might come to a Time
[1:12:26] in this world
[1:12:28] where people are going to say what
[1:12:31] happened
[1:12:32] and why did this happen
[1:12:35] and it's been preached
[1:12:38] what's he doing
[1:12:40] not just trying to prove to us he opened
[1:12:42] our eyes or our ears
[1:12:44] he's trying to show us
[1:12:47] this
[1:12:48] is things that are to be
[1:12:51] this is what's coming
[1:12:54] he preaches the Rapture my brother and
[1:12:56] sister some people hear the Rapture
[1:12:58] sermon and think yep we're getting out
[1:13:00] of here but hidden inside of that
[1:13:03] message is a real key of our faith to
[1:13:07] rise up and know that not just is there
[1:13:10] a catching away but I will be an
[1:13:12] overcomer when I get to the Rapture amen
[1:13:16] it's not going to be some miracle that
[1:13:18] suddenly in the last second of time on
[1:13:20] Earth turns us into this perfect image
[1:13:22] of Sons and Daughters of God but he's
[1:13:25] trying to show us open our eyes open our
[1:13:27] ears to see that we already have Victory
[1:13:31] we already are Overcomers we are already
[1:13:34] in that place and yet we will find that
[1:13:36] in the message my brother and sister
[1:13:38] there is a spirit of defeatism that's
[1:13:41] out there because the Satan is bringing
[1:13:44] us to a place that we don't think we
[1:13:46] measured up well what are we going to
[1:13:47] measure ourselves to
[1:13:49] what are we going to measure ourselves
[1:13:51] to because I can tell you right now that
[1:13:53] Paul heylett started a failure and In
[1:13:56] the Flesh he would end a failure if it
[1:13:58] was not for Jesus Christ amen so let's
[1:14:01] not stop and look at this and have a
[1:14:03] defeatist attitude but let's stop and
[1:14:05] say Lord you are showing me something
[1:14:07] and I want to see it and I want to hear
[1:14:10] it and Lord what I need and what did the
[1:14:13] prophet I'm just going to bring this I'm
[1:14:15] a little out of order here but I'm going
[1:14:17] to bring this what did the prophet of
[1:14:18] God tell us to pray for
[1:14:21] Revelation he didn't say you know don't
[1:14:23] come down pray for you have authority
[1:14:25] over this or this and the other he said
[1:14:28] pray for Revelation because when our
[1:14:30] eyes are open and our ears are open we
[1:14:33] will see what is happening around us
[1:14:34] because you can't have Revelation and be
[1:14:37] null and void
[1:14:40] you can't be empty you can't be desolate
[1:14:42] you can't be
[1:14:45] oh
[1:14:46] excuse me I'm just wound up tonight
[1:14:48] ain't I
[1:14:50] well Hallelujah
[1:14:55] yeah
[1:14:57] you see
[1:14:59] he saw this I see Menace trees walking
[1:15:05] I wrote a little footnote here
[1:15:09] he had a vision
[1:15:10] of the open Word
[1:15:13] but not a clear one
[1:15:17] he knew God had come
[1:15:19] we refer to it even though we're now in
[1:15:21] the 21st century
[1:15:24] but he sent us a 20th century prophet
[1:15:27] and it brought great
[1:15:29] clarity
[1:15:32] or did it
[1:15:37] oh boy brother Paul I can hear the ACT
[1:15:40] ice cracking
[1:15:48] what the prophet of God say he says when
[1:15:50] this bride
[1:15:52] sees
[1:15:53] who she is
[1:15:59] now trust me I'm not being negative
[1:16:01] tonight and I don't want you to take
[1:16:02] this as negative
[1:16:03] some people believe if you just see the
[1:16:05] message that's all there is to see but
[1:16:07] my brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:16:09] said when this bride sees who she is so
[1:16:11] she's got to have spiritual eyes it's
[1:16:14] not just to be able to go to Malachi 4
[1:16:16] in Revelation 10 7 and lay these things
[1:16:18] out she needs some spiritual eyes to see
[1:16:21] who she is
[1:16:25] well there's a great spiritual movement
[1:16:27] on the Earth today the gospel has went
[1:16:29] around the earth you know the world
[1:16:31] seven times when the prophet was there
[1:16:32] and we say oh that's good but can you
[1:16:35] see
[1:16:36] can we see who we are that we've been
[1:16:38] given this great Authority because he
[1:16:41] has touched our eyes my brother and
[1:16:43] sister he's anointed Us in the spirit
[1:16:45] our ears are open to hear the word of
[1:16:48] God and our spirit has been softened
[1:16:52] um
[1:16:53] well I tell you
[1:16:55] there was a vision there
[1:16:58] but it didn't have Clarity it wasn't a
[1:17:01] full revelation
[1:17:03] so what does he do
[1:17:04] he puts his hands on his eyes again
[1:17:09] oh
[1:17:11] and told them look up
[1:17:15] come on are you with me Saints
[1:17:18] one more touch from the Lord
[1:17:21] and then he didn't tell him now go look
[1:17:23] see if you can see a footprint in the
[1:17:24] dirt see if you can see this see that
[1:17:26] can you see Ministries no he said look
[1:17:28] up
[1:17:30] I've touched your eyes I've opened your
[1:17:32] eyes of understanding it I've touched
[1:17:34] your life and now it's time for you to
[1:17:36] look up because your Redemption is
[1:17:38] drawing nigh and in this movement my
[1:17:41] brother and sister this stirring of the
[1:17:43] holy spirit is moving us to quit looking
[1:17:46] down and look up amen that's what God's
[1:17:50] wanting us to do quit looking at the
[1:17:52] problems quit looking at all of this we
[1:17:54] can't save anybody we can't give anybody
[1:17:56] revelation we need to look up and pray
[1:18:00] for them and let our faith be what moves
[1:18:03] and stirs and comes as a prophet of God
[1:18:06] talks about the water and the pool of
[1:18:08] Bethesda when the spirit or the angel of
[1:18:10] the Lord left the water it was just
[1:18:13] water there's not a thing you're going
[1:18:15] to do not a thing we're going to change
[1:18:17] not an influence as it were directly
[1:18:19] that we can bring but I tell you by
[1:18:22] prayer and supplication before the Lord
[1:18:24] living that word and moving of the
[1:18:27] spirit my brother and sister we can
[1:18:29] change things amen but we confront and
[1:18:33] we can cry
[1:18:34] I go back and I'm sorry to go back I've
[1:18:37] told it many times but as we were just
[1:18:39] in South Africa got to see it with my
[1:18:41] eyes I got to see a young man that a
[1:18:44] mother was so concerned about her lost
[1:18:46] son and God speaking out don't worry
[1:18:49] about it now how my brother and sister
[1:18:51] will the words of a stranger impact the
[1:18:54] heart of a mother concerning a
[1:18:55] backslidden son but that mother had
[1:18:58] enough faith that she said okay if God
[1:19:01] said it I will believe that and her son
[1:19:04] is serving God today married to a lovely
[1:19:07] ex-catholic girl and you know that she
[1:19:10] was used to be just shook up about but
[1:19:12] God come on this scene it wasn't a man
[1:19:14] it wasn't a mother's tears as it were
[1:19:16] just to Cry tears but it was a heart to
[1:19:19] believe and had a revelation that God
[1:19:22] said I could claim my family with the
[1:19:25] token and I'm going to apply the token
[1:19:27] so that I can stand and be there without
[1:19:30] one hindrance
[1:19:33] one thing we have and I'm sorry to go
[1:19:35] this route but I just feel led to we
[1:19:37] want to apply the token but we don't
[1:19:39] even have the token over our own life
[1:19:42] we need the token over our house before
[1:19:44] we try to get everyone else in under the
[1:19:46] token
[1:19:47] we can't be outside the token and just
[1:19:50] say I'm applying the token it doesn't
[1:19:52] work that way my brother and sister what
[1:19:54] God's wanting us to do is come to a
[1:19:56] place that our eyes are open we see the
[1:19:58] word we say I'm going to believe it I'm
[1:20:00] going to live it I'm going to do this
[1:20:02] and then God would come and he lays his
[1:20:05] hand
[1:20:05] and I want to ask you tonight can't we
[1:20:07] just lift a hand and say he's laid his
[1:20:09] hand on my life
[1:20:10] he has laid his hand on my life the
[1:20:14] evidence brother Chris made a comment
[1:20:16] about that he's laid his hand on my life
[1:20:18] so many times I could not deny him I
[1:20:23] struggle I have times I want to give up
[1:20:26] but I look at this and in the end it all
[1:20:28] comes down to how can I quit him after
[1:20:31] he is done for me what he has done for
[1:20:34] me
[1:20:36] to see the hand of God
[1:20:38] and see what God's doing it's not just
[1:20:41] he died on Calvary this is a personal
[1:20:44] relationship this blind man had a
[1:20:48] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:20:51] it was in theory it wasn't just taught
[1:20:53] in the temple but it was a personal
[1:20:55] relationship
[1:20:57] oh my
[1:21:00] look at this
[1:21:03] the prophet of God again you can look
[1:21:06] these things up if you need to ties
[1:21:09] these things of natural just a few times
[1:21:10] it's not a tremendous amount of times
[1:21:12] but he ties the natural eyes and the
[1:21:15] spiritual eyes together
[1:21:17] and how he does that oh my brother and
[1:21:19] sister just stirred my heart
[1:21:22] yeah
[1:21:24] oh I'll tell you what
[1:21:28] each time
[1:21:30] we've been touched by the word
[1:21:35] our vision
[1:21:36] has got clear
[1:21:40] now I'm telling you how clear our vision
[1:21:42] ought to be
[1:21:43] I can only speak for myself
[1:21:47] but over and over and over and over and
[1:21:51] I couldn't even say that enough times to
[1:21:53] cover it the word has come and touched
[1:21:56] my life
[1:21:58] clear our vision ought to be
[1:22:01] how clear our vision should be my
[1:22:04] brother and sister
[1:22:05] let's not let those things that so
[1:22:07] easily beset us
[1:22:09] fogger Vision again
[1:22:12] we've been touched by the word and and I
[1:22:15] don't want to force anybody's reaction
[1:22:16] but once again all I can do is lift a
[1:22:18] hand and say God is constantly I pick up
[1:22:21] my Bible and I've been struggling a
[1:22:23] little bit and I'm upset about something
[1:22:24] I pick up my Bible and I'm like oh Lord
[1:22:26] forgive me
[1:22:28] Lord forgive me it's not my brother and
[1:22:31] sister it's not oh I'm reading my Bible
[1:22:33] not Trevor guy
[1:22:36] it don't work that way
[1:22:38] pick up my Bible and I'm looking and I'm
[1:22:40] like Lord forgive me
[1:22:43] Lord help me
[1:22:48] and then
[1:22:50] you feel that touch
[1:22:54] where there was turmoil
[1:22:57] struggle
[1:22:59] now to replace there's peace
[1:23:02] oh my oh my
[1:23:09] he touched me
[1:23:13] Hallelujah he touched me
[1:23:16] no one else my brother and sister says
[1:23:18] it really record in that town
[1:23:22] a direct
[1:23:24] touch
[1:23:25] from Jesus Christ
[1:23:29] but here's a man who had a testimony
[1:23:32] I find it remarkable that Jesus tells
[1:23:34] him don't go back to the town
[1:23:39] and don't tell it in the town
[1:23:43] I have to tell you I have a lot of
[1:23:45] things I surmise
[1:23:49] but I don't have a real answer for
[1:23:51] exactly why but if you don't mind I'll
[1:23:53] just share just a little glimpse of one
[1:23:55] of the reasons
[1:24:00] the prophet of God said you can actually
[1:24:02] be talked out of your healing
[1:24:08] imagine him walking back into town
[1:24:11] here he is no crowd with him
[1:24:16] no lamb to guide him no dog to guide him
[1:24:18] and no friend
[1:24:20] that has his hand to guide him
[1:24:23] and he comes back in town and
[1:24:25] everybody's like ah
[1:24:28] happened to you we're not going to
[1:24:30] believe this
[1:24:32] Jesus took me by the hand
[1:24:35] led me out of the town
[1:24:38] spit
[1:24:40] in my eyes
[1:24:45] and I could see
[1:24:47] but not clearly
[1:24:49] and he laid hands on me touched me again
[1:24:53] and now I can see perfectly
[1:24:58] Judah that's a cult
[1:25:00] that's spiritualism
[1:25:03] this is not real
[1:25:05] if it was real you would have received
[1:25:07] your healing your eyesight in the temple
[1:25:10] it would have been the high priest it
[1:25:13] would have been this way it would have
[1:25:14] been that way you needed to have been
[1:25:16] Anointed with oil not spit
[1:25:22] that is what it says isn't it
[1:25:27] maybe this Jesus guy is not real
[1:25:36] and this would have been his friends
[1:25:40] who had good intentions because we don't
[1:25:42] want you to get caught up
[1:25:45] in something that keeps you from the sin
[1:25:47] of laodicea
[1:25:49] we don't want you to get caught up in
[1:25:51] something that was started by a man and
[1:25:54] it's going to lead you off in a
[1:25:55] wilderness
[1:25:58] why don't you just settle down be normal
[1:26:00] like us
[1:26:02] drunk on Friday night and fighting with
[1:26:04] a family and you know out of here and go
[1:26:07] to church three times a year
[1:26:10] this three as one Minister once said the
[1:26:13] three sacred days
[1:26:15] and he included Chris
[1:26:18] was that sacred to man
[1:26:20] not to God
[1:26:23] says no what I want you to do is I just
[1:26:25] want you to end up back at your own
[1:26:27] house
[1:26:28] and if I could just in just closing
[1:26:30] bring this out to you
[1:26:32] I want you to walk up to the door of
[1:26:34] your own house
[1:26:37] and maybe a little girl just like Nessa
[1:26:42] wanted him to walk in that door
[1:26:44] in front of his baby girl
[1:26:48] and for her to see with her own eyes
[1:26:52] no opinion of the neighborhood or the
[1:26:56] church
[1:26:57] or the religious
[1:26:59] to say Daddy
[1:27:02] you're not blind anymore
[1:27:05] and the impact that would be on a little
[1:27:08] girl
[1:27:10] to have her Daddy get down and say honey
[1:27:13] the Lord Jesus touched me
[1:27:17] that little girl would have something
[1:27:19] embedded in the depths of her soul
[1:27:23] that Jesus Christ
[1:27:25] is the Healer
[1:27:27] he is the deliverer
[1:27:30] not to hear someone's version
[1:27:33] of how maybe hit his head and it moved
[1:27:35] some optic nerve and he can see now
[1:27:40] wasn't you eating some herbs
[1:27:43] didn't you have something over here
[1:27:47] no
[1:27:48] maybe his own family
[1:27:51] speaking of token
[1:27:53] needed to see that power of Jesus Christ
[1:27:57] on display
[1:27:59] not hear about it
[1:28:01] not to become a story
[1:28:03] because I'm telling you once those that
[1:28:06] were close to him Saul
[1:28:09] he wasn't just
[1:28:11] he hadn't just been given his eyesight
[1:28:14] for a day
[1:28:15] or two he was delivered
[1:28:19] oh I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:28:21] sister I want to be delivered from any
[1:28:23] Spirit any hindrance that keeps me from
[1:28:26] seeing my Lord Jesus as he is to keep me
[1:28:30] from seeing him in clarity
[1:28:33] hallelujah amen Philippians
[1:28:36] 1 6.
[1:28:38] being confident of this very thing that
[1:28:41] he which hath begun a good work in you
[1:28:44] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:28:48] Christ amen this Revelation that has
[1:28:51] been given and been open to us my
[1:28:54] brother and sister it's not a passing
[1:28:56] Revelation it is the Revelation it is
[1:29:00] Christ himself amen I'll tell you what
[1:29:03] just kind of redundant here but I can
[1:29:05] just see the people's response he spit
[1:29:08] on you
[1:29:09] what kind of thing are you into what are
[1:29:11] you doing there is sacred oil that
[1:29:14] should have been anointed on you and you
[1:29:16] have went to some crazy cult but what he
[1:29:19] knew is he had given himself to Jesus
[1:29:22] Christ and Christ led him
[1:29:25] to a life full of Revelation not a life
[1:29:29] of Destruction or a life of mediocrity
[1:29:31] but a life of Revelation
[1:29:35] revelation after revelation after
[1:29:38] Revelation and you say how do you say it
[1:29:40] so because I want to tell you as a blind
[1:29:42] man we don't know that he ever had sight
[1:29:45] but as a blind man to walk out
[1:29:48] the door
[1:29:49] see a sunrise
[1:29:52] brother Trevor called me this evening
[1:29:54] because they was just storming like I'll
[1:29:56] get out over their Direction it's like
[1:29:58] is everything okay we are having church
[1:30:00] and see this I make this point and and I
[1:30:03] believe Brothers Trevor sister Kerry
[1:30:05] will be able to follow me and and won't
[1:30:07] feel like I'm pinching on them but
[1:30:09] they're in a storm my brother and sister
[1:30:10] and I'm watching one of the most
[1:30:12] beautiful sunsets I've ever seen in my
[1:30:15] life
[1:30:20] and all of that town
[1:30:22] could have been in a storm
[1:30:25] and all this man saw
[1:30:27] was the power
[1:30:29] of Jesus Christ
[1:30:31] it was the most beautiful thing to him
[1:30:35] and yet the scoffer and the critic and
[1:30:37] all of these would have been in the city
[1:30:39] Square
[1:30:40] saying it ain't so it ain't so
[1:30:43] but by revelation
[1:30:45] he touched me
[1:30:47] he touched me
[1:30:49] by revelation
[1:30:51] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:55] sister vika would you come
[1:30:57] amen now in the sermon God hiding
[1:31:00] himself in Simplicity then revealing
[1:31:02] himself in the same
[1:31:07] brother Brown says it this way and I I
[1:31:09] just really touched me it
[1:31:11] just think they can break atoms and do
[1:31:13] everything else
[1:31:15] but when it comes to touching life
[1:31:17] they can't even tell where it come from
[1:31:20] a simple blade of grass and God is hid
[1:31:23] in it they can fire a rocket to the moon
[1:31:25] and shoot a radar over there or whatever
[1:31:28] more and yet can't explain the life in
[1:31:31] the blade of grass that's right see it's
[1:31:34] because it can't be explained it's so
[1:31:37] simple
[1:31:38] they Overlook it
[1:31:43] he touched me I can't explain it
[1:31:47] like the little room my brother and
[1:31:48] sister in the tent vision
[1:31:51] now I I'm not I don't say this
[1:31:53] critically but right people are people
[1:31:55] are just living any old kind of lives
[1:31:57] [Music]
[1:31:59] I had a brother share with me he says
[1:32:00] well this brother and and he just told
[1:32:02] me who it was this brother says he has
[1:32:05] so much money you won't believe how much
[1:32:07] money he has in a bank account that when
[1:32:10] brother Branham comes back he is going
[1:32:12] to give all this money hundreds of
[1:32:15] thousands of dollars gonna give it to
[1:32:16] brother Brown
[1:32:19] that's where he's caught up
[1:32:21] that's what he sees
[1:32:24] I'm not going to mark that I'm not going
[1:32:26] to speak down on that but that's not the
[1:32:29] revelation of this word
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:33] man needs a touch
[1:32:35] and I want to say where would we be
[1:32:37] tonight
[1:32:38] except for the touch that he touched us
[1:32:42] with
[1:32:42] our eyes and our ears our understanding
[1:32:45] of the word of God
[1:32:48] would be just along everything else
[1:32:51] but he touched me
[1:32:54] touched us now you look at this my
[1:32:57] brother and sister
[1:32:58] God called us
[1:33:02] I'm so thankful
[1:33:04] I can't see what the world sees
[1:33:09] reminds me a little story and I pardon
[1:33:11] me for even expressing it this way but
[1:33:13] it's just the way the world thinks of
[1:33:14] the insanity two young men after the
[1:33:18] weekend meet at work on Monday morning
[1:33:21] they'd went to a party on Saturday
[1:33:24] and the one young man says to the other
[1:33:28] he said
[1:33:30] so drunk I passed out
[1:33:33] the other guy is like I was close the
[1:33:35] one young man looks at him goes we had
[1:33:37] fun didn't we
[1:33:42] you see they're so focused in a
[1:33:45] self-destructive nature
[1:33:47] and Satan anoints them to say this was
[1:33:49] good wasn't it wasn't this good
[1:33:52] we damaged our liver made fools out of
[1:33:55] ourselves
[1:33:57] it was good right
[1:33:59] but I tell you what's good is when the
[1:34:01] Holy Spirit comes down moves in our
[1:34:03] midst moves in the kitchen moves in the
[1:34:05] bedroom moves in the car moves wherever
[1:34:07] we are
[1:34:09] Jesus

[1:34:12] that's good hallelujah hallelujah
[1:34:17] yes a little room in the tent
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:21] prophet of God recounts it to us what
[1:34:23] were the people doing they were coming
[1:34:24] out and people were asking
[1:34:27] what happened in there
[1:34:30] they're wanting an explanation of the
[1:34:32] move of God but look what the prophet of
[1:34:35] God says their response was I don't know
[1:34:40] but I'm changed
[1:34:42] unchanged what was it his touch
[1:34:46] not the touch of the preacher his touch
[1:34:50] that's what happened oh may we have a a
[1:34:53] little room experience every day of our
[1:34:55] life Hallelujah
