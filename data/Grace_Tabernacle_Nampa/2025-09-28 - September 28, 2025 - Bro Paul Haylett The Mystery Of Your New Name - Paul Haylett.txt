I heard about his groaning of his precious blood atoning. Then I repented of my sin and won the victory. Oh victory in Jesus my savior forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood. He loved me and I knew him. And all my love is to him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood. I heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing how he made the lame to walk again. And he caused the blind to see. And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit." And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory. Oh victory in Jesus my savior forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood. He loved me as I knew him. And all my love is to him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood. I heard about a mansion he has built for me in glory. And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea and about the angels singing and the old redemption story. And some sweet day I'll sing up there a song of victory. Oh, victory in Jesus [Music] &gt;&gt; forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood. He loved me and I knew him and all my love is to him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood. One more time. Oh, victory in Jesus, my savior forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood.

Doesn't matter when you say I reject that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The child of this world was getting closer. But I felt was more than I could bear. And I was on the verge of giving over.

I would just like us just to ponder these words cuz this verse is almost like a sermon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The days you cannot see. &gt;&gt; We don't know the finish of today much less tomorrow. and the things that are yet to come. [Music] &gt;&gt; The trials we must face. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Could we lift our hands today and say, "Thank you, Lord, for the trials we're going to face." &gt;&gt; You see, we've already been given the word of God that says we're overcomers. &gt;&gt; These trials are not going to defeat us. It's time for us to just give God praise for no matter what tomorrow may be, no matter what we're facing today. What challenge it is, we belong to him. Amen. He's already spoken the word over us. It's time for us, including myself, I say for us to stop complaining about our circumstance and start declaring victory is already come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. For days we cannot see. &gt;&gt; For all that is to be the trials we may have to face. We'll be leaning on your grace. It will be your strength. that saves us. Your love makes us strong. And through it all, we'll sing this song. Here we are worshiping the saints uh lifting our hands to you. Oh, here we are giving you thanks for all you do. as we praise and worship your holy name. You are here dwelling within our praise. [Music] Hallelujah. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. We appreciate your prayers. Uh Sister Jerry and I had a very long laborious week, but by God's grace. Uh all is well. Good to be here in the house of God today. Felt very much as I wanted to finish the second part uh you might say of of last Sunday. And uh so I just want to speak to you this morning on the mystery of your new name. And I just I enjoyed the song service. Did you? I I just felt like it was good. God bless you musicians. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles to Genesis the 32nd chapter verses 23-30. And uh as we'll look at this, we would uh just take a little bit out of uh uh what we had spoke as the opening of last week and uh lay a little foundation before we uh move forward here. Amen. Genesis 32:23-30. And he took them and sent them over the brook. This talking of Jacob, over the brook, and sent them uh over that he had, and Jacob was left alone, and there was wrestled, and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched him in the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. Now, my brother and sister, I want you to catch this. I'm sure you did last week, and I don't mean to be redundant, but even in this moment of personal affliction, do you know what that is? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not a, oh, I felt sad. That is a personal, deep, grievious, hurting, painful. &gt;&gt; Do do we know what that means? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Affliction. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He didn't let go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My my brother and sister, we sometimes think it's all the devil that allows those things to happen. But God will allow sometimes deep grievous affliction to come upon us to see whether you will let go or &gt;&gt; you'll hold on. &gt;&gt; And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. And he said, "Let me go, for the day breakth." And he said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me." And he said unto him, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince, thou hast power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of the place, for he had seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. Heavenly Father, we just come today, Lord. We come in your presence, asking you, Father, just to speak to hearts. Encourage us, strengthen us, give us something, Lord, to hold on to in this coming week, Father. For Lord, we know that the hour that we're living as the prophet of God laid out a foundation before us. And we see in the candlestick of the ages, Father, it is going into gross darkness once again. We talk of the dark ages. We talk of times when the revelation of the word was almost lost. But father, according to the word, we're coming back into a season. And Lord, I think today we should just give praise for it's in our worship that you dwell to give praise that the light is shining upon us today that we are not walking in gross darkness, but we have the light of the gospel revealed in this hour. Lord, it's not about religion. It's not about churches. It's not about other names. Father, there's only one name that matters. And Father, we come today just by your grace and mercy. We will express this. And we just ask, Father, that you would help us in the name of Jesus Christ. Uh bless each life in your name. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Now, we'll see that the principle of giving a new name is established in scripture. And uh it it goes much deeper than just this example. But we take this here that God placed upon that and chased Jacob from being a surliner or a deceiver and gave him the name of Israel and how that in that God brought it this moment of his life. Now, this was not a moment as it would be that that Jacob had thought would be coming, but yet there was something in him that was yearning for this. And he was there in a time of great distress uh meeting his brother Esau again coming together uh wondering exactly what is uh upon Esau's heart. Esau, the the news came that Esau was coming with 400 of his men. And that sure sounds like war. and and Jacob was in distress. He had a wife. He had a family. Had possession. And and it looked like he was going to lose all of that. And he got serious with God. And I think God will allow you and I to come into positions in our lives that we have to get serious with God. It might not happen today. It might not have been yesterday. It might have already passed. But Lord will come. The Lord will come and put you in a position you will seek him. Amen. This is not about maybe you will, but if you're a son or daughter of God, you will. It's just that simple. So, it is there the Lord establishing this new name in the word for Jacob where he is now called Israel. Now, as we'll look in a minute uh here, but Isaiah speaks and prophesies. You love the book of Isaiah. So many good nuggets hiding in the book of Isaiah. And so he is here in Isaiah 62. He's uh prophesying or speaking over Jerusalem and over Israel and over you and I. And so this is not just a scripture that uh pertains to days gone by, but it is there that he says, "For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace." Amen. Please change that, Brother Alex. And for Zion's sake will I not hold my peace. And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation there as a lamp that burneth. And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings the glory. And thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name. So it's not a new name that man gives to it. My brother and sister. We see all through this scripture. We'll touch on it a little bit. Uh but the new Jerusalem, amen, we have ideas. There's been artist depictions of a new city coming down from the heavens to the earth. But my brother and sister, I'm telling you that we have to see the whole picture to catch what the picture really is. Amen. A partial picture is not sufficient. We can preach Jesus Christ today. We can preach baptism today. We can preach a lot of things today. But God's not wanting you to just see one portion of the picture. He wants you to see the whole picture. He's bringing out right that the fullness of the mystery in this day of the Godhead bodily, the fullness of the mystery of Christ needed to be expressed. And I believe that it is expressed in this day because without the whole picture, you won't make it. You can acknowledge Jesus died on Calvary. You can acknowledge baptism. You can acknowledge all these things. But God is wanting to put every piece of the picture together. Brother Brandham uses that analogy. Otherwise, we end up with a cow in the top of the tree. Amen. And that's not going to work. So, every picture or part of the picture in its correct position. And this is why by the preaching of the word, it is setting things in order. They would be those that would say, "Well, these are not new truths. These are not uh new revelations. These are not new." No, that's right. It's a time of setting it in order. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what God's des doing today, desiring to do today. Amen. So, here it is as it is in Isaiah 62, a new name. But the word clearly says it will be the mouth of the Lord that names this name. Now, if we'll turn in our Bibles uh today or look on the screen, Revelation 21:17, very familiar scripture for us. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Now, this has been really speaking to me lately because, my brother and sister, we can quote, we can we can quote the prophet. We can quote ministries, good men of God. We can quote uh uh those in our midst and those abroad. We can do a lot of quoting. But here it is giving a very clear picture. But what we need to hear is what the spirit is saying. We can have the word and the word will be good. It will be sufficient. Will be inspiring. But without the spirit speaking to us, my brother and sister, it's just words. It will be something that we try to uh uh analyze, categorize. we we want to put it in a place but we'll then have a certain amount of our own understanding own intellect own revelation being put in there but when the spirit speaks to you when it's God speaking to you personal then it is not subject to interpretation of this man or that man. Amen. I was going to pull a quote over and I didn't do it. But the prophet of God says the problem that we have is that um uh we hear something and instead of going to God for the answer, we go to the preacher, the pastor, we go to this man, we go to that person to to understand or try to see what is being said. And brother Brandham is implying there that what we really need to do is go back to the spirit, ask the Lord, you know, what is this, the right and the wrong of it. Now my brother and sister, let me just put that in a little bit of context. There'll come a time or may come a time, let me put it that way, that they'll shut the doors of this church and they would come and take your Bibles away and they would for uh forbid you to assemble together. You come into a season as it was the dark ages of little or no fellowship amongst the saints. Now, when you hear these things being spoken, when you see these things a and that uh uh that uh deceiving spirit would come in the land and you can't go back and make a quick phone call. What does this mean? What does that mean? You're going to need to hear the spirit. &gt;&gt; You're going to need to hear what God is speaking to you or you will be deceived. Now, we put that in proper context that the bride of Christ cannot be deceived, right? It would do its very best to deceive you, but you can't be deceived. But you shouldn't take that as, well, praise God, I don't need to do anything. I can't be deceived. No, my brother and sister, if you're the bride of Jesus Christ, you're going to make your calling and election sure. You're going to nail that down yourself. You're not going to say, "I'll just rely on what brother Paul preaches. uh I'll just rely on this or on that or what I can get off the internet. My brother and sister, God wants you today to make your calling, your election sure. That's where you hear the spirit speaking to you. Amen. So, he that hath an ear, hear what the spirit saith unto the churches, to him that overcomemeth. So, not the w man who gives up, not the man who who says, I I've went as far as I can go. I'm done. No. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of a hidden mana, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. Now, I I don't want to go too far off on this uh little rabbit trail, but through the ages, through the years, there's been men that come and said, "It's been revealed to me the new name." Well, my brother and sister, the thing is there we would be no new name or no understanding of the new name except to the one that receive it. So man comes and says, "I've got a revelation of the new name." That's good. You don't have to push back against that. But that's not the new name to you because you have to be the one who received it to know what the new name is. So this is not some universal doctrine to be preached or to be brought out and say I have the answer come to me for the answer but it will be the spirit speaking to you will re reveal the new name to you. Amen. And God is doing that right now. He's coming through the word to reveal himself to you. Now let's just look for a moment. White is a color of purity. So, you're going to be given a white stone, something that's going to be pure. It's not a tarnished stone. It's not It's not something that's been laying in the dirt. Now, I'm not preaching this as doctrine. I want to stir up your pure minds today. Okay? So, white is purity. Now, a stone is used through scripture as a memorial. Many times there's been memorials that were placed and God anointed Ben to put up piles of rocks which other generations uh don't really look at, maybe don't fully understand. It didn't matter. God said, "You know what? When they crossed over Jordan, he sent them back into the river. They picked up stones out of the crossing, out of the water. not just a convenient stone on the bank, but he caused them to go back into the depths of the riverbed and pick up stones and bring them out and stack them up in a memorial. And it'd be like, why is why is this? And it was so that future generations, you could come and bring your children. This is what the scripture says. Bring their children back to that place right there and say God did a mighty work and delivered us out of the influence of Egypt and we came into the promised land which is the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ. Amen. And this is a memorial. So children, this is a reminder of what God has done for us. But God didn't say now just come back and worship this pile of stones. Amen. It was a memorial. A memorial is there as a remembrance. Right? And so a stone is also used as a foundation. And it is there that we see see through the scripture. Amen. We see the scripture laying out that um uh the foundation. Now it was upon Peter the rock. But brother Brandham so clearly shows us that it was not Peter himself as many theologians would say. Oh, Peter was the foundation of the church. No, my brother and sister, Peter being interpreted as little rock was nothing more than a representation of revelation. So, it's upon revelation that God is building his church. And a white stone, a memorial is also a foundation. And so, we see that revelation is the foundation of the true church or believer. Amen. This is not a matter of academic study that we come and we put scriptures together and convince you because I can tell you right now that every religion there is has scripture that they have put together to prove where they stand. But if the spirit is not speaking it, it's a man work. And if man does the work, it will fail as the work of man always does. Just think about how great Rome was as a society. And what did they fall from? The same spirit of Sodom that is present today. Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. having a form of godliness. They worship their idols. Now, I heard a lovely statement made the other day about uh idol worship and and um these deceiving spirits. And idol worship, my brother and sister, would not be now focus okay if you would. Idol worship would not be that brother Paul would come and have introduced to the church today something here and saying God showed me this is this is something important and we should worship this. You'd say but that is idol worship. I'm talking about real believers. Idol worship is worshiping the true God falsely. It's not introducing another god. Idol worship that you and I need to be concerned about. Right? We don't have Buddha in our house. We don't have Confucious. We don't have any of that kind of stuff in our house. But we can have the truth and worship the truth falsely. That's right. &gt;&gt; So you have to be careful, my brother and sister. We're living in that age that it will deceive if it can. But now look, this white stone, this foundation is there. And as I already said, revelation is the foundation of the true church or the true believer. Revelation is that foundation. Now, my brother and sister, when we're talking about stones, we're not talking about the believer having a hard heart. We're talking about a fleshly table of the heart. The scripture says that is tender and moldable. It can be written upon. God didn't introduce a holy chisel to write on your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. He brought the word and the word come and started to write on your heart because your heart is moldable. Your heart is such that that God can lay principles and put them and it's not as it were a surface religion. This is a problem we have in the 21st century. is so much of religion is a surface religion. It is something that we do as it were uh because our families always went to church. Uh I I share this with a little bit of humor. I won't name the religion but I have a good friend uh and um uh he he I was talking to him. He actually called me about a little business matter and he he and his wife were taking a little trip and we were chatting back and forth. This is a man that uh I have talked uh sometimes in hours long conversation as he would be traveling and uh not he's not ashamed to talk about these things in front of his family and he'd be on speaker phone in his car and and we'd be talking and we'd get done. Now this is not lifting up Paul but this is the truth when it's unfolded and we'd get done and he'd say, "Man, I've been so blessed by this conversation. I've never heard these things before." And so it's there, but we're in a conversation on the phone. Sister Jerry was there, could overhear this conversation. He said, "My wife and I are taking a trip and we're going to go. We're not actually doing the work. We're not going to be out there proceliting people, but others will be." Now, my brother and sister, we're not here to procelite anybody. If the Holy Spirit doesn't stir your heart, nothing will stir your heart. We can give you all kinds of studies and literature and all kinds of knowledge and we can graph it all out and put it all together. How many of you have seen that that timeline calendar they have uh of the scripture and the ages of when who was born and what happened? You know what I'm talking about? It's a just a huge the paper version of it just would cover this wall and it comes together and you look at all these things and how incredible that is. You could have that memorized. It wouldn't do one thing for your salvation. Amen. To know exactly when it happened, my brother and sister. Do you realize how close things can be that Enoch and Adam walked on the earth at the same time? Amen. I I love this cuz Enoch, Amen, was walking into the promise and Adam had walked out of the promise, but they were on the earth at the same time. Now, that's not to say that Adam had not found reconciliation with God. But I'm telling you that the anointing that was there brought Adam out of the garden and it took and anointed Enoch so much that Enoch was searching for a way back into the presence of God. Amen. And that's what God's doing with you and I, my brother and sister. We're not here, this is why I made my opening statements. We're not here to say, "Well, we're living under the curse." I tell you, I'm living under the blessing and I'm moving back into the presence of God. I'm coming back into the promise that was there originally. We're not standing here to say the curse, the curse, the curse. Oh, this is curse. That's cursed. Let me tell you how personal this is with me. I don't know how many of you's occupation is named that the very way that you live and work and labor is cursed. But I am living under that as a farmer. The very soil is cursed. You leave a field alone for a little season, it will grow every kind of weed. But you'll never find a field of corn. Volunteer itself to grow. &gt;&gt; But the weeds will show up just all you got to do is ignore it. They'll show up. My brother and sister, that's the curse. But I'm not living under a curse. I'm living under a blessing that came out of the word of God. I was called out of that to live and participate and actually fulfill or manifest that blessing of promise. Amen. So this foundations there God riding on the tender moldable hearts of sons and daughters of God. Now let me sum this up in simplicity. Pure revelation of who you really are. That's really one of the things I don't want to I don't want to misguide and say that some of these things don't matter the understanding and and to see but I'm telling you my brother and sister none of this means anything if you don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; If you go year after year studying your Bible and praying and come to conclusion that I just hope I make it. I just uh you don't know who you are because when you study out the word, the word will reveal to you who you are and where you stand in the word of God. That's what the revelation or opening of the word was for. Not just to have something we conform. You know, men short hair, sisters long dresses, long hair, blah blah blah. No, we're not talking about conforming. God was informing us of who we really were. Amen. He didn't come and say, "I'm going to make you conform." He come through the word to inform you. And when you are informed, there's something inside of you says, "Praise God, that's who I am right there." And nobody has to browbeat you at church. Nobody has to preach at you. Nobody has to, as it were, throw stones to get you to see. It is a revelation that's already down in your heart. And when the word comes to it, oh my, you can't tell me that you won't know when God starts to ride on your heart. Amen. When God starts to ride on your heart, you see &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; who you are &gt;&gt; oh my &gt;&gt; the pure revelation &gt;&gt; of who you are not teaching. &gt;&gt; Teaching helps reveal but it is not the revelation of &gt;&gt; do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. So preaching and teaching and all of these things are good, but we'll never make you what you aren't. Amen. We can bring a skunk to church and we can never never, no matter how much we call him kitty, will never turn him into a cat. And you'll never, my brother and sister, take an unbeliever and bring him to church. He could be in church service every day of his life with the Holy Spirit moving and signs and wonders and manifestation. And it will not just for his attending church make him a believer. Amen. But if there is a seed down there and that writing upon the heart is revealed by the preaching of the word and you say, "But we've heard this before. We've heard this before." Well, let me put it this way. Don't don't be offended. But some people just have so much trash piled on top of their heart. God's got to slowly dig his way through it. And he digs his way through it. And when it gets down, he writes that on the heart. And it's there that they say, "Oh, praise God, my brother and sister." You know, we have friends in the message. We have brothers uh that that have uh you know, they might not share it with you. You might have met some of these brothers, but they won't share it with you uh just because they don't want to uh as the brother says, blow you away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when God come and started dealing with them, &gt;&gt; they started out thinking, "Oh, they're trying to make me guilty." And then he just realized God was just bringing up the list that was already listed against him. It was not that he was condemning him of it. He was just giving him the opportunity to say, "Forgive me for that, Lord. Forgive me for that. Forgive me for that. Forgive me for that." And it's there when he got down. You know, if you've ever ignored your emails, I did this sometime back here. I just thought, "Ha, I'm just ignore this junk." But you know what happens? You end up with 1198 of them things in your phone. And then your phone starts getting weird cuz it's got no more memory. And so you say, "You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go through here. I'm going to delete this." Well, you know, it's way smarter. Now, this is not a computer thing cuz that's not me. But it's just like way smarter to stay on track. &gt;&gt; Delete. &gt;&gt; Delete. &gt;&gt; Delete. You'll never make the rapture. Delete. &gt;&gt; You're not good enough. Delete. You did this. Delete. &gt;&gt; You thought that. Delete. &gt;&gt; Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't delete it, Satan will just pile it up and pile it up. &gt;&gt; But as long as you can come back to the word and say, "The word says delete." &gt;&gt; Not deleting the word. You're taking the word to delete what Satan is saying. Oh, delete. Delete. Delete. Delete. And the word's saying that's not you. Delete. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't hold that against you. Delete. Amen. That'll never be brought up. Delete. &gt;&gt; You see, my brothers and sister, what God's doing is he's bringing us to a place that we have a pure revelation of who we really are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not not a intellectual uh revelation. Not not just, you know, something that that uh you know, hey, my family my family, you know, I was born in the message. You hear this a lot when you get around young people. I was born in the message. Okay. After you were born, did you just stay a baby? &gt;&gt; No. You started to grow. &gt;&gt; And as you started to grow, you started to face different challenges. Now, those different challenges, my brother and sister, might be a little bit different. And I'll just use this simple analogy if you don't mind. The 11th hour worker makes some of us that have been around the message our whole lives look as though we've done nothing for years. &gt;&gt; But you see what God's done is he's bringing them up to speed in the word &gt;&gt; while we were so so slow. &gt;&gt; Now my brother and sister, another simple analogy if you don't mind. We farm some ground and there's great big trees on one side of the field. It's about noon or 1:00 every day before the sun actually strikes this part of the field. And then when you harvest a field, you kind of forget. And it's like, why is the rest of the field mature? And this part is green. &gt;&gt; Because it has to bask in the sun. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. The 11th hour worker is about the time the sun starts to reach its height and the light starts to shine down. Some of us been living in the shadows of the message for far too long. You've said, "I'm a message believer. I go to church. I love brother so and so's preaching. I love this. I've been to this revival. I've been to this camp. I've been to these special meetings." But are you actually basking in the sun? There's the key that comes down. Now, let me move on. Revelations 3:12 says, "He that overcomemeth will I make a pillar in the temple of my God." &gt;&gt; Now, where is the temple of God? &gt;&gt; It's not down the road somewhere. It's not on Mount whatever somewhere you are the temple. So God's going to make you a temple in the very creation that he has made of you. &gt;&gt; Now some people say that that's just too weird. What are you saying? What I'm saying is is God's raising you up under a pure revelation of who you really are. That I am the temple of almighty God of my Lord Jesus Christ. And now he's making me a pillar. You don't take you can let me stop. You can take something else. An artifact or in the temple can be removed but you don't remove the pillar. So in other words, God's telling you, I'm going to make you an absolute unmovable, immovable portion of the creation of my dwelling place. In other words, you are going to stand here as a memorial of time. And what did they build those out of? They didn't build that temple. They didn't build that pillar out of cardboard. They didn't build it out of out of some cheap whatever recycled pallets or something of that nature. But they built it out of the very solid stone. The revelation of Jesus Christ standing in you being there that you can stand every test of time. We have visited Israel. We have visited the places that different things armies destroyed it. The Roman army destroyed a lot of these things and and uh you know you remember what's what's the mount we rode the cable car up on top &gt;&gt; Mada you can just look it up on the internet you go to Msada uh those those pillars some of them still standing after all this time many of them knocked down I hope you see the analogy some of those were able to stand the test of time and are still standing, but there was hundreds around them that have fallen. Amen. That's not a pillar that's standing in the house of God. Those are pillars that were once there, but have fallen. Amen. And God saying, "I made you a pillar, and you're going to still stand. You're going to be standing in my house." Amen. I remember when we were standing there on top of the uh uh Msada that day. Amen. And we're looking there at that mountain. You're looking at all of those different things. And brother George and I were were having a little conversation. And it was actually Brother George that says, "It's amazing how it would be that some would stand and some would fall." And even when the Romans come and assaulted it, uh why did they choose to knock this over, but they left this? Maybe it wasn't their decision. Why did Satan in this hour, he come to knock this over and he tried to knock you over, but you're anchored. Amen. You're set in the solid rock of Jesus Christ. Amen. The firm foundation. This is a stone that was a foundational stone. And that's where you stand today. That's who you are today. Amen. And we look at that and realize by the scripture. No new revelation here, but you are the new new Jerusalem. Amen. You are that place that God is speaking about that's coming down. when he says it's coming down out of heaven a as as a a city, a beautiful thing coming down as a bride adorned for her husband. It's right there in scripture. Isn't it amazing how God would hide that? So, people are thinking there's going to be this big city going to come right out of the heavens and float right down. But the truth of it is that New Jerusalem, you, the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. His wife that has been adorned, is right here, right now. And God is blessing her right now, raising her up in heavenly places right now. It's not something he's got to do some supernatural unheard of thing and bring a city out of the heavens. He's not bringing a city down. He's raising a city up. &gt;&gt; Amen. This bride, it doesn't have to have some supernatural event at the end to bring it down. My brother and sister, he is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the seventh seal was open, it declared he is here. Amen. And so we are here now under the influence of that word being raised up. Hallelujah. So God's not going to do some supernatural event like the sci-fi movies have some kind of new creation floating down from heaven. Amen. We are new creation in Jesus Christ right now. Amen. Being lifted up into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So as we look at this now, what does God what does the word of God tells us that uh the prophet's words, but it's the word speaking it? He just put it out in these words that uh the bride of Jesus Christ will be the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about that for a moment. It's not going to be another prophet. It's not going to be another great man. It's going to be you rising up. &gt;&gt; It's going to be the word in you rising up. &gt;&gt; Is going to be that final voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love how the word is because, you know, instead of preaching me a sermon, just live it for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the bride's message is going to be. We are not going to take a sandwich sign and have to stand. There are some who believe that still, but we are not called of God to take a sandwich sign and stand on the corner and and say, you know, Jesus is coming. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, the world's heard it so much they could care less about it. And those that even pay attention to it won't live it. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's right in front of them and they say, "I want to do what I want to do, the way I want to do it, when I want to do it, how I want to do it, where I want to do it." So, it's all about them. It's not actually about what does my bridegroom, what does the Lord Jesus Christ want. It's about what I want. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seen a child the other day sitting on the floor sobbing and the mom says, "You're not getting it." And the little kid was sitting there kicking its feet out and hitting its hands on the concrete. Made my hands hurt as the little guy's like, what was the little kid's voice? Not mama, you promised. I want. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want. Give it to me. I want. Well, imagine if we seek the Holy Ghost like that child was seeking that candy. God would give it to you. &gt;&gt; But the world is today saying, "I want &gt;&gt; I want give it to me." &gt;&gt; A sign of prosperity is the new sign of the Holy Ghost. Oh, that's not us saying that. That's ministers out there saying that. men that were called to be a voice. Amen. A minister that's been known around the world on the internet just passed away a few days ago from some kind of a health event. Um I I don't even know how you say his name. Vodum &gt;&gt; Bachman. &gt;&gt; Vod Bachmann. Amen. The man spoke truth. If you ever listen to much of what he said, the man spoke truth. &gt;&gt; The world won't be able to say we didn't hear truth. They don't have to hear it from you. You you realize that he was anointed and called. We're not preaching on those modes, but Charlie Kirk, there's a man who spoke in a public forum many, many, many words of absolute truth. He didn't say you got to come to church to get it, but he spoke it in a forum that God chose for him to speak it. And the message of the hour, the preaching of the word says, "Come to the house of God. Come that I can let this ministry perfect you." It's not the ministry. Come on, folks. There's people that say, "Oh, the preachers have failed us." What they're saying is God failed us. &gt;&gt; Come on. I know that's straight, but that's what they're really saying because the word said that that ministry of Ephesians would come for the perfecting of the saints. And they say, "We don't want them to perfect us. this won't do it. We don't believe in it. And then they say, "See, we're not perfected, so that proves it." Well, they never believed that they were going to be perfected. &gt;&gt; But when the word comes and you believe that the word's going to have that impact on you, it will. &gt;&gt; What the prophet of God say, Amen. You go to a church that preaches Jesus is divine. He didn't say that preaches everything just perfect. And then you glean. Some of you might be this morning just gleaning. Boy, that was quiet. I take that as an amen. You're just you're just gleaning. &gt;&gt; But you see what portion you believe, God will bless you with. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That portion that you believe that you held on to. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, he's long-winded. He's this. He's that. Sometimes he doesn't make sense. Am I your savior? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Am I your healer? &gt;&gt; Am I your deliverer? &gt;&gt; No, sir. But the one who is, if you will believe on him, he will fulfill those things in your life. &gt;&gt; But we have a human problem and that's looking at human. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we don't think the human's doing it right, then we reject all of it. Why don't you just say, you know what, that was his opinion or that was his way. Maybe just poor vocabulary. Maybe it was just poor words that he used. Why don't you look on it and say, "Is that in the word or not?" And when you find it in the word, say, "I believe it, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. That sure take a lot of naysayers uh uh doing their naysaying. Because if they would actually take time to take it back to the word, they would realize that in fact uh no matter how uh the the preacher failed to articulate it, well, if it's in the word, you believe the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not that, as the Apostle Paul said, I don't come with you with this perfect speech and these words of wisdom to convince you to do this, but I come in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. And if we would look at the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and forget about how the man may not quite phrase the words correct. So, yeah, I don't know about that. I I think he's off the word. Hard question. Sorry, I don't mean to be brutal this morning. Anytime you believe someone's off the word, my only question to you will be, did you actually go to the word &gt;&gt; and see? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've asked a few before. Well, they're off here. &gt;&gt; Show me. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; They've got nothing. &gt;&gt; They're off my opinion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're off my emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can I run around? pat everybody on the back so you don't leave today feeling bad. But you see, my brother and sister, this is all part of God's plan that we got to come to the place. And you say, "Well, what's this got to do with the mystery of our new name?" Well, the prophet of God said that uh God gives the Holy Ghost to the true anointing of the Holy Ghost. He gives that to those who are obedient to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I will put this in my words so you can reject it if you want. You will not receive a new name. Unless you have obedience. That's right. &gt;&gt; To the word. &gt;&gt; He don't just hand it out like candy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Revelations 22:17 says, "And the spirit in the bride say, "Come." So, this bride of this day, this last days, uh, is going to be anointed to be able to say, "Come." And let him that heareth say, "Come." And let him that is a thirst come. and whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely. Now, this bride in her ministry, see, she's got nothing to boast about, &gt;&gt; my brother and sister, but let's not be ashamed of it either. Sometimes we hear people say, "Well, I'm not worthy, but you know, like this is what God did for me, and I kind of like And what are we doing? We're downplaying, downplaying, downplaying, downplaying, downplaying, cuz you're looking at your flesh. Right? &gt;&gt; You're looking at you. &gt;&gt; And the word says the spirit and the bride say come. He didn't come and say the bridal say come when she's perfect. &gt;&gt; She's being perfected by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by man's thinking. Not by man's ideas, man's ability, man's intellect, but she's coming under the anointing of the word of the spirit of the age. And so I know what your answer will be, but I'll say it anyway. Amen. How many of you are perfect this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, some of you would say, "No, I make these mist." No. No. See, there's the flesh rising itself up right there to keep you from stepping into your rightful position because the word of God says, "You are righteous because I'm righteous. You're holy because I'm holy. You're perfect because I'm perfect." It wasn't about you in the first place. We'll never reach a status of hearing a new name if we keep looking at our flesh because our flesh is our own stumbling block. &gt;&gt; But God says, "If you'll just look to me and what I said about you and how I feel about you and what my word is capable of, then you will reach heights you never would reach on your own." &gt;&gt; And God wants you to reach those heights. So maybe it's about time for us to remind ourselves to get that out. In fact, the prophet of God says it this way. He says, 'When you say, "I'm not a very good Christian and I'm weak and I'm this and that." He says, "You're speaking the devil's language." &gt;&gt; Amen. What do we do? Let's stand up and say, "Look, I it's been revealed to me." Anybody got a revelation this morning? It's been revealed to me. I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. Amen. The blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient for every mistake I made. And I like how one man put it. He said, "When God called you to serve him, he factored in your stupidity." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He already factored it in. It's already part of the plan. He's already got that settled. He's going to do this, &gt;&gt; but I've covered it. &gt;&gt; It's going to say this, but I've covered it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. This bride in her ministry, nothing to boast but the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac had several songs that had different verses today that just really spoke to my heart. Amen. Nothing. Grace is sufficient. Can somebody say that with me? &gt;&gt; Grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not grace and you. It's not grace and the message. Amen. It's grace. God's grace. Period. And you. Amen. You are the unlikely, unworthy portion. But imagine how amazing grace is. &gt;&gt; So, as you look at this, she's got nothing but a personal experience. This bride is coming forth. She's being molded. Now, anybody have a personal experience this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you believe me if I told you this morning that your personal experience was nothing? That was just like something you read in a book. It was just something that just happened and that has not No, no, it's personal. You know, it happened. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You know where God brought you from. You know what God's done for you. You know my brother and sister and there should be no demon on earth that could talk you out of what you have experienced and know personally. Amen. When you are so to speak living on the edge of the abyss and Satan's there trying to coax you to step off and God called you back and something inside of you pulled you right back away from the abyss and you do that and somebody say, "Oh, that was a figment of your imagination." Amen. My brother and sister, that's not a figment of your imagination. That was the Holy Ghost that's in you. Amen. That's calling you back into the word, bringing you from those positions. It would have been for, you might say, eternal destruction is what Satan wants. Eternal separation. But God says, "No, come my daughter. Come my son." Amen, my sister. I don't want to embarrass my sister Lisa, but my brother and sister, when you've been in certain places in your life, addictions and different things that are there and you come and God has straightened up your life and you are standing here today as a daughter of God, my brother and sister, nobody's going to tell you that had no impact on your life. Nobody's going to tell you just kept on like that. It would have been just fine. But I'll tell you what, you stand upon the word yourself and are able to say, "God did that. God called me from that lie. God saved me from myself. God saved me from this world. And he's brought me into his presence of God. I don't care how many demons walk on the earth today and say, "That's nonsense." My brother and sister, you know better. You know what God has done. Amen. And you say, "But I was raised in the church. I've never done that. Never even took a sip of liquor, smoked a cigarette, or done any of those things." It's still God's amazing grace that has kept you. Satan will desire to destroy you. He wants to let the wolf loose in your house to bite and to tear and to destroy, my brother and sister. So what does God do? He gives us personal experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So what do you have here? Now when the spirit and the bride say come, Amen. She's not going to talk about, don't misunderstand me, she's not going to come when the spirit anoints the bride and she starts to speak. She's not going to quote the preacher. She might not even be quoting the prophet. There might be some influence that she would speak about. It's got to come down on that personal level. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I was lost, &gt;&gt; but now I'm found. &gt;&gt; Amen. I had scars upon me, but the scars are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I had these things here. Maybe it was that my mind had come to a place under pressure that it was weak. But he said that I would have a sound mind. And I stand here today with a sound mind. That was not a doctor. That was not a pill. That was not some kind of analysis. That was the Holy Ghost that come and said, "You're going to have a sound mind." And I believe it and God did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's the difference, my brother and sister. Not talking about what somebody else said, somebody else did, somebody else thought, but what God did for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's coming down God doing this. Amen. &gt;&gt; What happens here? This bride, she's going to talk about how Christ the word is her experience. Amen. It's not going to be I went over and joined this church or joined that church. Amen. Uh not to say there's not good things that happen in those places. Don't misunderstand me. Very good things happen in those places. And in many times, God uses churches that are not even on the word of God to start a journey that leads you to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember as a kid, I won't name the church, but my aunt and uncle, faithful attendants there. And while they were having church upstairs, these were these were of the old fact. Well, I'll just say it. They're Nazarene. Amen. And they were old Nazarene. I mean, they just really got into serving God, worshiping God while the kids were playing bingo in pingpong in the basement. My brother and sister, no way to lead your family in the presence of God. Amen. You're worshiping here and the devil's got your kids in the basement. No, my brother and sister, when the word says that the spirit and the bride say come, the bride is going to present the opportunity, the atmosphere that will draw the children, too. We don't need to sit here today and say, "Well, when our kids get to be 18 or 20, maybe God will deal with them." I want God to come while they're still little toddlers. I want God to come while they're still not even comprehending totally what they're hearing. And I want God to anoint their little hearts to say, "You know what? I see by the word of God there's going to be a bride out of every nation, every kindred and tongue. And I'm not meaning to add to the word, but out of every age group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether it be remember prophets there in that vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't recognize her. I don't forget the age. Forgive me for not remembering. 90 years old. She comes to the Lord at 90 years old. Her life is close to over. Everything she's got promised in this earth is actually passed &gt;&gt; and God saves her. Why would he leave her? If she's a daughter of God, why would he leave her till that point? Because God's going to prove &gt;&gt; it's going to prove sovereign grace, sovereign word &gt;&gt; is going to work. Amen. &gt;&gt; My grace is sufficient. Remember the story of the soldier, World War I, I believe it was, maybe World War II, the man is dying and the chaplain or whatever comes to him. &gt;&gt; And he goes, "I I don't I'm I'm afraid to die." And he says, "Well, go back to where you left him." &gt;&gt; See, what happened? Here's a young man in war and he's laying there dying and he starts searching his life and suddenly he says as I lay me down to sleep. You see that atmosphere &gt;&gt; was such that he left. If you've ever watched I I I actually watched this, pardon me for using terrible analogy. I was in the semi one time just north of Baker City, Oregon, and I'm passing another semi and I look over and the driver has an elbow on the window seal and an elbow on the steering wheel. and he looked over enough and I waved at him and he kind of went on by him, went to move back in the other lane and I watched what became a very slow drift. Went from the center line. That was one of the reasons I was concerned. He's driving down the center line and a very slow drift. I start hollering on the CB. Hey, hey, hey. Drives right off the freeway and truck just crashed and destroyed itself. Fortunately, the man didn't die. That's many people's spiritual walk. They become so doled by Leodysia, they start a drift. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Everything's okay. My family's still in church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to know you yourself put it in there. Your family being in church, does that make them hot? Come on, let's be honest with ourselves. Does that make you hot cuz you're in church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Does it make you even lukewarm? &gt;&gt; Could, but if you're still drifting, come on. Let's not use such thoughts. That's right. &gt;&gt; My family's in church. Let's be hot. &gt;&gt; Let's find a purpose for what God's got us here. Okay, let me move on. So, we're talking now uh uh this experience will be things that they cannot even put. The bride of Christ won't even be able to put this into words. What happened? Remember the prophet's vision uh of the little room and they come out and they said, "What happened in there?" I don't know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And people thought, "Well, nothing must have happened if they don't know what happened." But I'm telling you, when God comes in your life and starts to deal with your life, things will change. And you won't know how they change. You'll just know something happened. Amen. We don't need to explain this gospel. We need to live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to accept it. Now, look in in Second John 1 1-8. We won't preach the whole thing, but I want to make this point. Um my somebody stole the time this morning. Must be we'll get a new pulpit and maybe it'll be better. Second John 1 1 uh 1 1-8. The elder and to the random lady and her children. No, my brother and sister, this lady is not random. She's elected &gt;&gt; whom I love in the truth. And not I only, but also all they that have known the truth. So you look up the definition of election. It is a choice by vote. And so a vote, one vote, amen, God's vote, God's vote for you. And God is an unchangeable God. Same yesterday, today, and forever. So when God voted for you, Amen. He didn't go back a week later and say, "I guess I cast the wrong vote." Now we as that if you vote for a politician or something like that you know um you know maybe you'd want to go back in 6 months and say I I would like to change my vote but it's impossible to do. Amen. So you look at this says for truth's sake which dwelleth in us shall be with us forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Truth is not fading away. It's not being degraded. Grace be with you. mercy and peace from God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, and truth in love. I rejoice greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. Now I beseech thee, Lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we shall love one another. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. So people say, "I love the Lord," and live any way they want. They have a carnal understanding of love. &gt;&gt; They they don't have a a real spiritual understanding because they would be obedient to the word if they really loved him. Amen. That's not too hard to comprehend, is it? And so take this commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it. For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. Now this might throw you if you don't have any understanding. Look to yourselves. &gt;&gt; What does a comma do? &gt;&gt; It denotes a gap, a stop, a space, &gt;&gt; pause. Look to yourselves. Now, if we just preached a sermon, look to yourself, then people would be like, what's wrong with this guy? But you see, it's already Christ in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want you to look, if it was up to your flesh, the carnal person, you would have quit so long ago. It ain't funny. You wouldn't even be able to remember when you quit. You would have quit so long ago. So, you look to yourself and let's just stop and let's just recount in our own life what God has done for you, what he has come and and answered prayers and and changed circumstances and all of this is. So, look to yourself. You don't need to look to the preacher. You don't need to look to someone else. Look to yourself. What's God done for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can't find a single thing that God's done for you, then I I don't even know what to say. I don't know what to share with you if you can't find a single thing that God's done for you. But look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought. &gt;&gt; See what's happened. My brother and sister, I'll just be blunt with you this morning. Many a person and I know these people personally I would not divulge their name but they are sitting here today not serving God because they looked to what someone else said what someone else thought when someone else's opinion someone else why didn't they stop and look and say what has God done for me &gt;&gt; I was a druggie I was an alcoholic I was a liar a cheating a thief an adulterer and God cleaned me up and took me in and called me his own if they would have just went back and look to themsself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not of their own ability, but to see Christ in them, right? That's the word. Christ in you, the hope of glory. Stop and just look to yourself. What has God done for me? And they would put the naysayer and all of those. They would just ignore them and put them off to the side. But somebody's like, "Well, the preacher said, the preacher did, the preacher this, the preacher that." What's the preacher got to do with it? He can't get you in and he can't kick you out. Amen. All he can do is bring the word to you and he's either bringing truth and you can stand on that and if he's not bringing truth then find another church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you don't want to find another church, get rid of the preacher and get one that will preach the truth to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Boy, but church splits are just horrible things. I never want to live through another one. Well, I'll tell you what, being lulled to sleep and fed to the wolves is not such a sweet experience either. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, they hold on eternal life. &gt;&gt; What does it do? It puts you in a position to receive. My brother and sister, we were there. Brother Luke, you know, he works with high voltage electricity last Sunday. It was there, you know, I went down there. Those of you here, you know what happens? Brother Luke is 440 and I grab a hold of brother Luke. Amen. There's been many a case and it's a proven principle of electricity that there's been people that tried to jerk the person away from the electricity and the guy with the hold electricity doesn't get shocked as bad as the guy that was on the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, while he's trying to rescue him, see how Satan works? &gt;&gt; He follows the same principle God's got. Amen. I'm here. I want to be a conduit. I spoke this last Sunday. I want to be a conduit to you. But my brother and sister, I want that conduit to be filled with the Holy Ghost. I want it to not be fleshly things, carnal things, brother deals, you know, uh multi-level marketing things, and and just, you know, conduit down through this. No, I want it to be Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever flowing right down. And may it be as it were, that the one that you're holding on to out here, uh, receives also. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not in this just for oursel. We're in for the word to come down to it. And it's there that God's looking for those that are faithful. Because when people are faithful, God can bless them and know what kind of result he'll get. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look, &gt;&gt; can I have a couple more minutes? &gt;&gt; Couple in farmer talk is anywhere from 10 minutes to two hours. &gt;&gt; Okay, we're all still good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Jerry knows. She told me one time I come home. I told her I'll be home in a few minutes. I come home a couple hours later and I said, "Hey honey, where's supper?" She says, "Well, I've got a revelation. This might not be the exact words." And I said, "What's that?" You like cold food. I put it in the fridge. So, you know, I don't mean it to be funny, but look, let's just move on here. So, correct position in essence is everything. I want you to think about this for a second. This word misapplied. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Circa church in the 70s. I'm going to give you the word test. If you don't get 100% on it, you're serpent seed. Misapplied. Horribly misapplied. When it should have been applied, eat this book, &gt;&gt; right? And if you'll eat this book and keep eating this book, it will save your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what happened was it was a 100% as it would be in or you're 100% out. Well, I would have been 100% out. I have to tell you the truth. It took years for God dealing with me. Years of struggle and and trying and failing and wanting to but not achieving. Anybody know what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; And so you look at this. See, we come in a time. We come in a place that God sometimes works quite slow. I don't know. I couldn't tell you. I could figure it out, but I couldn't tell you right now how old Jacob was. But Jacob was born a suppler. And until he reached that age that he wrestled with the angel, he was a suppler all the way to that moment. Must have been serpent seed up to that day. Must have been of the devil up to that day right there. No sir, the word would show you he always was a son of God. &gt;&gt; God just changed his desire and brought it to a place that focused on him. Now correct positioning. Let me get focused. It's essence of everything. Now look, Brother Brandham, if you guys remember a vision brother Brandham had that he goes and it's at a it's at a house and uh there's this baby that's sick and there's all these individuals and a neighbor and a mother-in-law or a mother, grandmother, whatever. Sorry, I'm should have this. My brain just went foggy. So, Brother Brown sees all this and he's going to go pray for the baby and he realizes this lady's missing. But here she comes, sees out the window. She's come coming down the path. She comes in the house and then he's I'm going to pray. But God shows him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not everything in its correct position. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, if you'll let me to turn this a little bit. You got your Bible. You read your Bible. You believe your Bible. But what's in the Bible's got to be in its correct position. &gt;&gt; If it's not in the correct position, you can read it. You can claim it. You can tell the devil to leave you alone until you got no breath in your body and then say, "This doesn't work." Because my brother and sister, God wants you to put it in position. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not some random I I went out and I partied all night and now I'm having nightmares. Devil leave me alone. My brother and sister, you can't go flirt with the devil and not expect him to go home with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to have something in peace in your home, then you bring peace into your home. It doesn't just show up. That's right. I hope that didn't offend anybody, but I'm telling you, if you don't have peace in your home, you have to create the atmosphere that puts peace in your home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brown praying for the child and everything's done. And then he looks over there and by God's grace, he recognizes, you know, that hat's not in its right position. And and uh she's here, grandmother, whatever is here, but it's not in the right position. and and the Lord just calms him and he steps back from that. And then pretty soon the hat gets picked up and gets put on top of the stove, the furnace over here. And that person shifted around and went and sat in the right sea. And then the prophet of God knew that that vision that God had showed him of that baby being healed was perfectly in the picture. Perfectly, as brother David just said, in time. It was just what it was supposed to be. Now I want to say my brother and sister hopefully I don't cut you too hard this morning. Take this right here. This is your vision for a Leo to see an age. This is your vision. It must be put in its correct position if you expect God to honor your prayer and to answer you. Now you say, "But I've got some things out of order in my life and God's still doing that." That's right. He's showing you he hears your voice. He's showing you that he cares for you. But it's time get it in its right position. &gt;&gt; Let it be the preeminent thing in our home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the washing of the water of the word is preparing the bride to receive more word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? We know John 1, he is the word. Now I'm sure glad I expressed that couple minutes. Revelations 19. And I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude and a voice of many waters and as a voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigns. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready. See this is the process we're in right now. His wife not girlfriend. &gt;&gt; See there's already been a vow taken. There's already been a betrothel taken. Amen. And this is what's happening my brother and sister. It's not, oh, uh, the marriage ceremony, the minute you make the commitment, you're considered. So, see what God's doing? God is bringing you and I to this place right now where we are here and we're saying, Lord, I'm going to serve you. You say, "But we haven't met at the marriage supper of the lamb that comes after." The supper comes after. Supper doesn't come before. Supper comes after. Amen. And so it's there that his wife, Amen, he's making a claim to her and to her was granted that she should be araided in fine linen, clean and white, tying that back to the white stone. Amen. These things all come together. There's a purity there. So she is coming by the blood of the lamb. Amen. She is in fine linen, pure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb. And he saith unto me, these are the true sayings of God. What is it? Let me just sum this and move quickly. Perfect, pure revelation. Not one single word added, not single word taken away. Perfect revelation. And so the lamb's wife, where does she receive her new name? Not from the church. might offend some of you. She doesn't even receive it from a prophet. &gt;&gt; She receives it from her husband. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's where she receives her new name. &gt;&gt; No new name's going to come just because you went to a message church. &gt;&gt; No new name come because you're a a follower of brother so and so's ministry. Amen. Now, if you understand what I would say here, there's not going to be a hyphenated bride in heaven. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. My name is Mrs. Le oysia bride. Nope. Nope. I'm sorry. No hyphenations. You're either the bride of Jesus Christ or you're of Leodysia. &gt;&gt; One of the two. That plane. Amen. And we will receive and take on the name he's given us. Now, let me read this and then we'll be then we'll be almost done. It's not funny, but I just find myself. Let me just move on. I'll just move on to the very next one. Amen. Go to that. Go to the next one out of the church age. So the next one also little too much here. Now then there is also the thought of the future partaking of the hidden mana. Right? They're in revelation. Those are partaking of the hidden mana. I think it will be eternal partaking of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the eternal ages to come. How else could we begin to know the uncarchable riches of his own being? All that we have longed to know. Now look at this. I've had people ask me this question. Will we will we anything change? Will we know more in heaven? Right? Here's the answer. All that we begin to know the uncarchable riches of his own being. All that we have longed to know, all our unanswered questions, all that will be revealed. It will be from Christ who is our life that we receive it. Oh, sometimes we think we get to know a little of him and his word down here and is so good and it makes us rejoice. But one day when our flesh changes that word and he will become what we had never dreamed possible. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What we never dreamed possible will be an understanding to see how it was. My brother and sister I want you to think about this. Before the foundation of the world, God was there. He writes your name on the lamb's book of life. And we think, "Okay, okay, that's that's cool. I'm not sure how that works." But did you realize he didn't wait an eon of time? I'll put it that way because I have no idea how much time that was. He doesn't wait and then pull you off the page and send you out. When he wrote your name, when he spoke your name, we've preached it here in the church, but just let me give a little refresher. as a Jewish mother would give birth or any mother uh that'd be and as they're in the process of giving birth, "Thank you, Lord, I'm a man." Um, but they would cry out a name. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that was a name given to that child. &gt;&gt; The scripture types this in that same context that God spoke. Put your name in here. I don't mean to be selfish, but I'll put my own name so I don't offend anybody. spoke Paul Halelet. It was a birth pain. Listen to the sermon birth pains. It was a birth pain. &gt;&gt; It didn't just like Paul Hale. &gt;&gt; It was a birth pain. &gt;&gt; Imagine the birth pains our Lord Jesus Christ went through. That's Paul Hale. &gt;&gt; And then he writes that name down in the book in his own precious blood. You realize that put you out here? Oh, you mean we just floated around out here in the heavens somewhere and just appeared on earth? No. God had This is such amazing about how what God is and what he does. God run a genealogy. We look at anybody who ever run your genealogy. Amen. I kind of did kind of half-hearted, you know, enough to get disappointed. Um, but look, he says, "This is going to be my daughter. She's going to receive the word. She's going to say amen to the word. She's going to stand for the word. She's going to live the word. She's going to be the word. And this is her parents and this is their parents and this is grandparents and this is this. And he goes back and if you've looked at a genealogy chart, it just goes, you don't think that's amazing that God would call your name and write you on the Lamb's book of life and put every circumstance and every life and everything together to come down and bring the word. And then a mother has a baby and she holds it in her arms and said, "I'll call him Paul." Come on, tell me you don't serve an awesome God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A God that the word is so incredible. He cares so much for you. He put all that together to bring you to this place. And you tell me he can't bring you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; through your circumstance. He can't bring you through those things, those things that Satan wants to stumble you over. You're saying you don't think God can bring you through that. &gt;&gt; Come on. You're so underestimating your God. In fact, that is so radical it might be just considered unbelief. &gt;&gt; Hopefully that didn't offend you either. Amen. So, let me find myself. Move on to that next piece if you would, brother Alex. Oh, go back. He gave me the look like what are you where you going? So, it says he's going to give the overcomer a white stone in not on whit stone a new name which the owner alone knows. Now, the idea of a new name is a familiar one. Abra was changed to Abraham. Sarahi to Sarah, Jacob to Israel, Simon to Peter, Saul to Paul, these names either brought about a change or were given because of a change. Look, when you get there and he gives to you a new name, it's not going to be you, the old man that is there, but it's going to be the new creation that is going to receive the new name because there has been a change. Now, look at how brother Brandham puts this. They brought about a change or were given because of change. &gt;&gt; That's right. H I know I'm long here, so I just I'll hold these thoughts. It was only after Abraham and Sarah had their names changed by the Lord that they were made ready to receive the coming son. So there it was a change brought the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look at this. In Jacob's case, he had to overcome and then he was called. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. A prince. In the case of Simon and Saul, when they had received the Lord, their change came. And today each one of us true believers has had a change in name. Now look at this. We are Christians. So we could settle for that and say, "Oh, our new name is we are Christians." But that's just a glimpse of what God is bringing about to name a new name. We give you a new name. It's a name common to all of us. But we already have in the word. Amen. A name that will only be known by the one who receives it. So it can't be a common name. It can't be common. But one day we will have another change. We will of a certainty receive a new name. It could well be that name that was our true and original name written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world. Imagine this. So your mama, your daddy names you whatever. I'm going to use there's no Agnes's here today, are there? We'll use Agnes. Mama names you Agnes. Amen. And and you know, you grow up and you don't like the name Agnes, but you know, you just live with it because that's what they named you. And then you'll find one day that God had an entirely different name for you. &gt;&gt; So the name you disliked your whole life &gt;&gt; turned out not to be your real name. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Those of you that don't like your name, that should give you hope. should give you peace that you're not going to have to go through eternity named Agnes. But God has a name for you. Now, I don't make light of that because I knew a lady was like a grandmother to me named Agnes. And if everyone was like her, it wouldn't matter what you named her. She was a saint. &gt;&gt; Have another change. A true original name written in the lamb's book of life. He knows the name but we do not. &gt;&gt; One day at his good pleasure we will know also. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us be aware &gt;&gt; that you right now as sons of daughters of God are possessing a new name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you receive it, praise God. We don't need to get in a hurry. We don't need to try and come up with a revelation that we've got the new name. Just let God reveal it to you in its season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're an overcomer, you will receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A new name. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm apologizing but not for being a little long. &gt;&gt; But look at this, saints. How beautiful it is that God would come and be so mindful of us. All that matters to me whether my name was meant to be Paul on the lamb's book of life or it's another name just as long as my name is in the lamb's book of life that's what matters &gt;&gt; amen and that is a gift of God to you &gt;&gt; if he put your name there and I don't say if as a question mark when he put your name there amen he made it possible for you to achieve accomplish all of the synonyms that go with that &gt;&gt; to be there and finish that work. Amen. Can someone say thank you, Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Ruth, would you come? Hallelujah. I say, my brother and sister, I hope that maybe the Lord blessed you a little bit today. This has just been something on my heart. Something just looking at that, it's like, wow, we can turn this into a doctrine or we can turn it into reality. I think I'll just settle for the reality that God has got a new name for me and when I stand before him as an overcomer one day. Amen. And we stand there before the throne of God and he reveals what we were. Imagine how big this picture is. Now remember my brother and sister this genealogy. I want you to realize just as a promises to Abram becoming Abraham, the sands on the seashore. Imagine if God come and started stirring the sands and laid out your whole life story from the beginning to the end. It would be so incredible there'd be no way for you to even comprehend. Say, "But but how could this be? How could No. The same God who wrote you in the Lamb's Book of Life and made it possible for you to fulfill that word is the same God who's hanging the earth in orbit." Brother Isaac shared a little deal with me. They're thinking they're going to have to uh change the atomic clock because time is speeding up. It was something on the order of some 10,000th part of a nancond. How can they even measure that? I don't know if that's a fulfillment of scripture that he would shorten the time. I don't care. Time's in his hand and I'm in his hand. So whatever it is, he's going to fulfill it in you. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. Let's just stand if you would please. Hallelujah. 712. Brother Alex. Amen. And then we'll just ask our brother Isaac to come and lead us in a song. Amen. be it unto me. &gt;&gt; Whatever the word is, just receive it. &gt;&gt; Don't put up a offense. I disagree. I don't feel. I don't understand. Just say, Lord, whatever the word is, let it be in me. Be unto me, oh according to your word. According to your promises I can stand secure. of upon my heart all the truth that sets me free according to your word. Oh Lord, be it unto me. Oh be unto me. Oh, according to your word, according to your promises, I will stand secure. Oh, you carved upon my heart. Oh, the truth that set me free. and according to your word, O Lord, be it unto me. Be it unto me according to your word, according to your promises I can stand secure. Carve upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word, O Lord, be it unto me. You're playing first there. I have a man. I have a maker. [Music] He formed my heart. And before even time began, life was in his hand. [Music] He knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call. [Music] I have a father. He calls me his own. And he'll never leave me. No matter where I go, he knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call. I have a father. He calls me his own. And he'll never leave me. No matter where I go, he knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call. Amen. Amen. You know, I took a psychology class years ago and one of the two things they say, you know, every human needs is place and purpose. I have a father. He calls me his own. I have place and he's given me purpose. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. A song that uh who I am, Lord, who I am. Amen. Oh, glorious victory. Amen. Oh, glorious victory. That day he set me free. And he made my heart his very throne. My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine. And now I live to praise his name. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see now who I am. Part of my Savior, [Music] part of his words. It's a revelation. [Music] of who I am. On Calvary, he died to redeem his lost bride, the King of Kings, became my savior. This is God's great mystery of love expressed to me that Christ and I might be made one. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see now who I am. A part of my Savior, part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. Amen. Turn around, shake hands with one another. Let's just sing this chorus one more time as we're dismissed. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see now who I am. Part of my savior, part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. God bless you. [Music]
