[40:34] this is my intention amen sister sophie
[40:37] i
[40:37] sent you a birthday greeting i don't
[40:39] think you got it because my phone says
[40:41] you
[40:41] have the wrong number so i don't know
[40:44] you've changed numbers
[40:46] okay that's my smartphone
[40:49] and uh so anyway happy birthday
[40:52] amen i usually try to just do those on a
[40:55] personal basis but
[40:56] um anyway god bless you happy birthday
[40:59] today
[41:00] and uh you know i just want to before we
[41:03] go on
[41:03] share a little card here a thank you
[41:06] card
[41:07] a beautiful little card from our young
[41:10] people
[41:10] um just thanking the church for sending
[41:14] them or helping them go to camp
[41:16] and uh i believe it was a real blessing
[41:19] to each one of them as we have
[41:21] heard their testimonies and uh just as
[41:24] they share
[41:24] what uh god has done for them and um
[41:28] so i tell you i there some of you
[41:31] weren't able to go to camp
[41:32] this year i don't know exactly school
[41:36] stretched out but young people i just
[41:39] encourage you even
[41:42] you know brother manasseh you're still
[41:43] young people and um
[41:46] just if you want to go to camp
[41:49] uh i know they do have some age
[41:51] guidelines and things like that
[41:53] but don't put it on a shelf as though it
[41:55] probably can't happen okay i want you to
[41:58] pray about it and i want you to claim it
[42:01] and
[42:02] i believe it's a good experience if
[42:04] there's nothing else you get to go
[42:06] see that there are other young people on
[42:09] the face of this earth
[42:10] who love the lord and want to serve the
[42:12] lord and i i believe it's encouraging so
[42:15] we'll hang this up on the bulletin board
[42:18] just to thank you uh from our campers
[42:21] amen and uh so i i
[42:24] can i share just something a bit of
[42:26] humor just before we start in the
[42:28] service today
[42:29] so i thought it was interesting that
[42:30] brother jason brings up about singing
[42:32] specials because jerry and i
[42:34] are standing in front of the vanity
[42:36] getting ready for church
[42:37] just this morning and i i told jerry i
[42:40] said
[42:41] it's a shame that we're going to have to
[42:43] do like they're trying to do for the
[42:45] covet vaccinations and
[42:47] we have to make an announcement now to
[42:49] those of you who sing a special we have
[42:52] like a free pizza for you
[42:54] um we have you know something good for
[42:57] you
[42:58] hear a gift card uh um
[43:01] i told sister jerry i said maybe we can
[43:02] offer them uh
[43:04] dinner with the pastor and then we
[43:06] stopped and thought about that and
[43:07] thought
[43:07] now that probably not a good idea
[43:09] because that would just
[43:10] dampen it but anyway it's just funny
[43:12] that that was
[43:13] on our heart this morning too amen so
[43:16] i just asked you as brother jason has
[43:19] asked you
[43:20] pray about it do it from the heart
[43:22] because i'd sure hate we have to resort
[43:24] to giving out pizzas
[43:26] so anyway god bless you this morning
[43:30] amen um and uh truly i mean that to each
[43:33] and every one of you
[43:34] just a lovely day um you know
[43:38] well i won't go into all those details
[43:40] but uh god is good
[43:41] i'll just i'll just sum it up god is
[43:44] good amen let's just stand
[43:46] i want to go into um uh
[43:49] finding the mercy seat and uh this will
[43:53] be kind of a
[43:54] a series a little bit of a series here
[43:57] you know a few services this has been
[43:59] the mercy seat's been on my heart for
[44:00] quite a while
[44:01] and maybe i am too transparent
[44:06] but the reason this has been on my heart
[44:08] was some comments that was made to me by
[44:10] an individual
[44:12] uh that um they didn't believe that
[44:15] i had it correct when i was
[44:18] speaking or sharing
[44:23] that christ is present with us
[44:26] and their understanding of the message
[44:28] if he is present with us he had to
[44:30] leave the mercy seat so to them
[44:33] they don't believe he is here in our
[44:36] midst
[44:37] because if he's left the mercy seat it's
[44:39] all finished
[44:41] but you see sometimes saints and i don't
[44:43] point this as a dagger towards this
[44:45] individual
[44:46] but sometimes people are taught in such
[44:48] a fashion
[44:50] that it's placed before them and they've
[44:52] heard it preached that way for so long
[44:55] that they can't see it any other way now
[44:58] we're not going to get into
[44:59] who has revelation and who doesn't know
[45:01] who is the bride
[45:02] who isn't we're we're not there this is
[45:04] not what it's about right it's not for
[45:06] us to
[45:07] to determine that that's between them
[45:09] and the lord but
[45:11] i just felt this burden on my heart for
[45:13] quite a while since this conversation
[45:15] that i had
[45:16] for us to just look at what the
[45:18] scripture shows us clearly
[45:20] and what the prophet of god says about
[45:22] it that we would not have any
[45:24] misconceptions
[45:26] about the mercy amen and so um this will
[45:29] be a part of a series and i
[45:31] i put this little disclaimer on this
[45:33] today that probably where i end up today
[45:35] you might look at that and say now
[45:37] brother paul missed it but you see this
[45:39] is a series and
[45:40] we series always has to come to a
[45:42] conclusion
[45:43] okay so we move from uh point a to
[45:47] to point uh x y
[45:50] z whatever we end up at
[45:53] there will be our final conclusion as to
[45:55] what uh
[45:57] we're looking at so i just want to say
[45:59] that so that you would understand today
[46:01] let's go to the book of exodus the 25th
[46:04] chapter
[46:05] now this is quite a lengthy scripture so
[46:08] we'll
[46:09] read a portion of it and let you be
[46:12] seated and
[46:12] and then we'll go on because right here
[46:15] in exodus um in
[46:18] god dealing with moses uh laying out
[46:22] the foundation of the mercy seat
[46:26] and now saints we have to understand
[46:29] that the mercy seat didn't just start
[46:31] in the wilderness for a tabernacle the
[46:34] mercy seat has
[46:35] always existed and god has chose by
[46:39] revelation
[46:40] to through the ages bring the mercy seat
[46:44] into our revision so it's not
[46:48] that it's just was for prophets it's not
[46:51] that it was just
[46:52] old testament but it is and now we see
[46:55] and and i'll just go ahead and preach
[46:57] this instead of explaining myself and
[46:58] re-preaching it
[47:00] exodus the 25th chapter starting with
[47:02] verse 1.
[47:03] and the lord spake unto moses so this is
[47:05] not moses idea
[47:07] speak unto the children of israel that's
[47:09] the whole congregation is anyone here
[47:11] this morning
[47:12] amen then they bring me
[47:15] an offering of every man that giveth it
[47:17] willingly
[47:18] with his heart ye shall take my offering
[47:21] and this is the offering which he shall
[47:23] take of them gold and silver and brass
[47:26] and blue and purple and scarlet and fine
[47:28] linen and goat's hair
[47:30] and rams skins dyed red and badger skins
[47:33] amen i get to go there
[47:35] amen and and wood and oil for the
[47:37] light and spices for the anointing oil
[47:40] and for sweet incense once stones
[47:43] and stones to be set in the ephod and in
[47:46] the breastplate
[47:47] and let them make me a sanctuary
[47:50] that i may dwell among them that is one
[47:54] of our hearts desires that we would
[47:56] be a sanctuary that he would dwell
[48:00] amongst us heavenly father we just ask
[48:03] you lord this morning
[48:04] father just take our thoughts our words
[48:06] lord commit them to your thoughts and
[48:08] your words father
[48:10] ask you lord that this would be a
[48:11] blessing to someone encourage someone
[48:14] father give us wisdom give us revelation
[48:17] we ask in the name of jesus christ
[48:19] amen you may be seated
[48:30] so as we go on here verse 9 he says
[48:33] according to all
[48:35] that i show thee so it's not something
[48:39] my brother and sister that
[48:40] someone set down as it were by a
[48:42] committee or uh
[48:44] by a a a a you know some other plan
[48:48] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[48:50] the pattern of all the instruments
[48:52] thereof
[48:52] even so shall he make it and
[48:56] they shall make an ark of and wood
[48:58] and two cubits
[48:59] and a half shall be the length thereof
[49:01] and a cubit and a half
[49:03] breath thereof and a cubit and a half
[49:06] the height
[49:06] thereof and thou shalt overlay it with
[49:09] pure gold and within and without shall
[49:11] thou
[49:12] overlay it and shall make upon it a
[49:14] crown of gold
[49:15] round about and thou shall cast four
[49:18] rings of gold for it
[49:20] and put them in the four corners thereof
[49:23] and two rings shall be in the one side
[49:25] of it
[49:26] and two rings on the other side of it
[49:28] and thou shall make staves of him
[49:30] wood
[49:31] and overlay them with gold and thou
[49:34] shall put the staves into
[49:36] the rings by the sides of the ark that
[49:38] the ark may be
[49:39] born of them now my brother and sister
[49:42] you will find that this carries on
[49:44] just to make a note for you you'll find
[49:46] that this carries on
[49:47] that back when david desired to
[49:50] move the ark and it was not god's will
[49:54] that those men sincere men else they
[49:57] stumbled and the ox and the cart
[49:59] shook a man reached out and touched the
[50:02] ark
[50:03] and he died you see the ark was not
[50:07] to be manhandled this is why
[50:10] these two staves of wood were put
[50:13] through the two rings
[50:15] and it was not to be just carried in any
[50:17] haphazard way but it was to be carried
[50:20] over the left shoulder which was over
[50:23] the heart and so we see
[50:26] lots of types and shadows in the word of
[50:29] god that shows us that
[50:30] the word of god even in the day that we
[50:32] live in is not to be carried as it were
[50:34] in any haphazard
[50:36] manner but it must be carried there in
[50:39] relationship
[50:40] to the heart and if it's carried in any
[50:42] other fashion it will
[50:44] not result in a good result
[50:47] in fact it would cost one his life
[50:51] amen this dave shall be
[50:55] in the rings of the ark
[50:59] they shall not be taken from it
[51:02] thou shalt put into the ark the
[51:05] testimony which i shall give thee
[51:07] do we have a testimony this morning amen
[51:10] where do we carry that testimony
[51:12] i pray it's a testimony that's carried
[51:14] in the heart not just
[51:16] of a mental conception not just of i
[51:19] joined a church or
[51:20] i i started to study this and i
[51:23] understand it now
[51:24] those things won't work my brother and
[51:26] sister pure intellectual
[51:27] will be able to put the abcs of the
[51:30] gospel together
[51:31] but it will never make it real and alive
[51:33] in the heart of the people
[51:35] amen
[51:40] and thou shalt make a mercy seat
[51:44] of pure gold two cubits and a half shall
[51:47] be the length thereof and a cubit and a
[51:48] half
[51:49] the breath thereof thou shall make two
[51:51] cherubims of gold
[51:53] of beaten work shall thou make them in
[51:55] the two ends of the mercy seat
[51:58] now my brother and sister these two
[51:59] cherubims were not just something that
[52:02] was set down
[52:03] upon the mercy seat they were an
[52:06] integral
[52:06] part of the mercy seat so
[52:10] you have a mercy seat but the mercy seat
[52:13] is not complete
[52:14] without these two cherubims
[52:19] and make one cherub on the one end and
[52:21] the other chair
[52:22] on the other end even of the mercy seat
[52:25] shall ye
[52:25] make the chairman's on the two ends
[52:28] thereof
[52:29] and the cherub themselves stretch forth
[52:31] their wings on high
[52:33] covering the mercy seat with their wings
[52:35] their faces
[52:36] shall look one to another toward the
[52:39] mercy seat shall the faces of the
[52:41] cherubians be
[52:42] and now shall put the mercy seat
[52:46] above upon the ark and the ark
[52:49] thou shall put the testimony that i
[52:52] shall give thee
[52:53] and there i will meet thee now remember
[52:56] brother branham
[52:59] has preached to us laid out a message to
[53:03] us
[53:03] and showed us that god has a provided
[53:06] way of worship
[53:08] we we don't just come haphazardly we
[53:10] don't come
[53:11] now don't judge somebody or be harsh on
[53:14] them because they might use
[53:15] the human words and say i feel right
[53:18] that's just sometimes just vocabulary
[53:21] if we're talking about how that we are
[53:23] going to
[53:24] act upon the word of god and we start
[53:27] saying i feel
[53:28] we need to be careful my brother and
[53:30] sister we are
[53:31] uh uh emotional beings right uh even
[53:35] uh a person who doesn't display much
[53:37] emotion has emotion
[53:38] because there is something stirring on
[53:40] the inside and
[53:42] and so you see that it's there as we'll
[53:44] look at this
[53:45] uh we're putting the mercy seat uh
[53:48] upon the ark and the ark shall be put
[53:51] the testimony that i shall give thee and
[53:53] my brother and sister i'm telling you if
[53:56] your testimony doesn't move you
[53:59] how do you expect it to move anyone else
[54:02] we might as well be mute
[54:08] people are like yeah it was on this day
[54:11] god dealt with me and i repented
[54:13] i got baptized and yeah i was pretty
[54:16] sure it was in this meeting over here
[54:17] with this brother i got the holy ghost
[54:19] and
[54:19] i've been trying to serve god ever since
[54:27] i have a farm
[54:32] well they're about unequal
[54:37] neither one will get us in a rapture a
[54:40] cold formal relationship with god
[54:42] or a farm neither one will get us in a
[54:46] rapture
[54:47] there should be something in the depths
[54:49] of our heart
[54:51] that when we think about what god has
[54:53] done for us come on can we do that this
[54:55] morning
[54:56] when we think about what god has done
[54:58] for us there should be something in the
[55:00] depths of our heart that stirs us
[55:02] something that we can stop and say thank
[55:05] you lord
[55:06] thank you for what you've done for me
[55:08] lord i i know about predestination and i
[55:10] know about the book of life
[55:12] the lamb's book of life before the
[55:13] foundation i know all of that
[55:15] but lord as a human you made me with
[55:18] emotion
[55:18] and something stirring inside of me that
[55:21] i say
[55:21] thank you lord otherwise we
[55:25] come under the traditions of men and we
[55:27] become cold and we become formal and
[55:30] we just put our name as it were on a
[55:32] book but we have no book to put it on so
[55:34] we even have less and nothing stirs us
[55:38] holy spirit can come down and move
[55:40] through the church
[55:41] and we just fiddle around we write notes
[55:44] and
[55:45] we do all kinds of nonsense in the house
[55:47] of god because
[55:48] nothing is stirring us
[55:52] i pray to god that each and every one of
[55:54] you that hears my voice this morning
[55:56] would be able to stop and say lord let
[55:58] there be something in my life
[56:00] that you stir something that changes me
[56:03] something that's moving me
[56:05] and i'm not talking about just walking
[56:06] out oh i just felt it
[56:08] no my brother and sister i'm talking
[56:10] about something deep down in the soul
[56:12] that's stirring you hallelujah and when
[56:15] we
[56:16] can come to that place then we know for
[56:18] sure that god is moving in our midst
[56:23] and there see it's when the mercy seat
[56:26] is now above the ark
[56:30] he says and there i will meet thee
[56:34] and i will commune with thee you see
[56:36] this is not just
[56:37] i came to church on whatever today is
[56:40] the 25th
[56:42] check mark he says it's when you
[56:45] have the mercy seat over the ark
[56:50] there's where i come in and i commune
[56:53] with you
[56:54] who wants to commune with god this
[56:55] morning i say from the depths of my
[56:57] heart lord
[56:58] speak to me speak to me lord and i want
[57:01] to be faithful and i want to be quick to
[57:03] speak back to you lord
[57:08] and i will commune with you from above
[57:10] the mercy seat
[57:12] from between the cherubims where it's
[57:14] upon the ark of the testimony
[57:16] of all things which i will give thee in
[57:18] commandment unto the children
[57:20] of israel you know as i read that
[57:23] scripture it strikes me
[57:25] here's the very foundation or this is
[57:28] where we would find the
[57:29] starting as it were of scripture
[57:32] concerning
[57:33] the mercy seat now in those verses right
[57:37] there we saw that god was giving to
[57:39] moses the pattern
[57:40] of the physical tabernacle talking about
[57:43] how
[57:44] i want this i want there to be an outer
[57:45] court an inner court and the most
[57:47] holiest of holies
[57:49] talking about these avenues or these
[57:51] places of sanctification
[57:52] justification sanctification and
[57:56] the infilling or receiving of the holy
[57:58] ghost which would be the holiest of
[57:59] holies and
[58:00] how we see these patterns my brother and
[58:02] sister and they
[58:04] are the pattern for the physical
[58:05] tabernacle
[58:07] now we look here and and one of these
[58:09] quotes i added i don't remember
[58:11] uh it must be this one uh that i didn't
[58:14] give to brother alex i was just going to
[58:16] paraphrase it but i will read it to you
[58:18] amen in events made clear by prophecy
[58:21] brother branham says here paragraph 134
[58:24] in the solomoness of this hour let us
[58:27] say this god our father
[58:31] our flesh is a poor tabernacle
[58:34] for you is this not true
[58:39] but lord let your sanctifying grace your
[58:42] holy spirit come now
[58:44] cleanse us from every doubt and every
[58:46] frustration
[58:47] every suspicion and every line of
[58:49] skepticism
[58:50] that would be in us that we might be
[58:53] free without one doubt come out
[58:55] confess boldly like peter thou art the
[58:58] christ
[58:59] the same yesterday today and forever and
[59:01] i believe as we live in a world we live
[59:04] in today and you know almost every day i
[59:07] i go on the internet and i i click on
[59:09] the deal and look at what the current
[59:10] events taking place
[59:12] and my brothers and sisters i i think
[59:14] that
[59:15] we are seeing the very evidence of the
[59:18] scripture
[59:19] you can say well does this apply to this
[59:21] well you could argue yes you could argue
[59:23] no
[59:24] uh whatever but you know my brother and
[59:26] sister what is it now
[59:27] i don't know if you guys are afraid yet
[59:30] but the delta variant of the kovid
[59:32] is out and it's going to make the
[59:34] original covid look like
[59:36] nothing and the world is quaking
[59:40] governments are quaking and the bride is
[59:43] rejoicing
[59:44] because my bible says that there will be
[59:46] pestilences and diseases
[59:48] and all kinds of troubles falling on the
[59:51] earth but this bride is not cowering
[59:53] this bride is saying thank you lord
[59:56] there's another
[59:56] sign that we're at the end time now look
[1:00:00] you know we wash our hands and we cook
[1:00:02] our food and all these things because
[1:00:03] that is you might say the common sense
[1:00:05] thing to do
[1:00:06] but my brother and sister nowhere in the
[1:00:08] word does it tell us
[1:00:09] that we should be afraid of the world we
[1:00:12] live in today
[1:00:14] in fact we've already by the word of god
[1:00:16] overcome this world
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:22] you see god deals in patterns
[1:00:25] he's referenced it there in the
[1:00:27] scriptures in exodus 25
[1:00:29] of patterns and when god lays out a
[1:00:32] pattern my brother and sister he doesn't
[1:00:34] come along
[1:00:34] and it's a new generation i need a new
[1:00:36] pattern see this is a problem that i
[1:00:39] would claim
[1:00:40] you know i we only have this revelation
[1:00:42] because of the message but
[1:00:43] you know just looking at it from the
[1:00:45] outside of the message
[1:00:46] looking at the world the problem the
[1:00:48] world has today the world of religion
[1:00:50] has today
[1:00:51] is that they're trying to change i just
[1:00:53] watched an interview
[1:00:54] of a pastor that has a quite large
[1:00:57] church and they were concerned about
[1:00:58] losing their children
[1:01:00] so in one of the annexes of the church
[1:01:03] they have installed video games and ping
[1:01:05] pong tables and pool tables and
[1:01:07] all of this and this pastor with spiky
[1:01:09] hair ripped jeans an untucked shirt you
[1:01:12] know and
[1:01:12] four or five necklaces and two or three
[1:01:14] bracelets and he's saying you know we've
[1:01:16] got to use
[1:01:17] what we have the resources we've got to
[1:01:20] catch these children and we have to
[1:01:23] adjust to the culture
[1:01:27] you know what's going to happen they're
[1:01:30] still going to lose the children
[1:01:32] but they're going to be inside church
[1:01:34] lost
[1:01:37] they're going to be inside the four
[1:01:38] walls of the church lost
[1:01:48] god deals in patterns now we read the
[1:01:52] scripture and it says that god is
[1:01:54] immutable
[1:01:55] is that correct scriptural amen not a
[1:01:58] message term
[1:02:00] scriptural immutable is unchangeable
[1:02:05] so god is unchangeable my brother and
[1:02:07] sister and when he said i'm
[1:02:08] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:02:11] meant that serious
[1:02:12] so if god ever healed someone he's going
[1:02:15] to heal you
[1:02:16] amen if god ever saved someone right we
[1:02:18] go right down the whole list
[1:02:20] god's doing that now my brother and
[1:02:21] sister we look at this sometimes and
[1:02:23] this just came up in a little
[1:02:24] conversation the other day
[1:02:26] and uh someone that you know but we've
[1:02:28] been we even prayed for him here in the
[1:02:30] church
[1:02:30] and you know they pass away and people
[1:02:33] say well god didn't
[1:02:34] heal them well my brother and sister we
[1:02:36] don't know what god's plan was for them
[1:02:37] just like we don't know what god's plan
[1:02:39] is for us
[1:02:40] but i tell you what we stand on the
[1:02:42] unfailing promise of god
[1:02:44] that whatever god's plan for us is will
[1:02:47] come to pass
[1:02:48] amen and the minute that brother closed
[1:02:51] his eyes and he quit breathing
[1:02:53] he was healed step to the other side
[1:02:58] he was no longer bound by a body
[1:03:01] that have been ravaged by life in years
[1:03:04] and etc
[1:03:05] so god deals in patterns his ways
[1:03:07] immutable
[1:03:09] amen he does not change with the culture
[1:03:12] or the seasons
[1:03:15] now this is pretty funny sister jerry
[1:03:17] many years ago bought me a light
[1:03:19] and it's supposed to supposed to help
[1:03:21] combat sads
[1:03:25] sads you know some of us are just such
[1:03:30] people of the outdoors and of the sun
[1:03:32] when winter comes and it's ugly outside
[1:03:34] we just kind of feel
[1:03:38] i don't know if any of you feel that way
[1:03:41] yeah
[1:03:42] thank you i needed an ally
[1:03:45] you know she bought me a light and you
[1:03:48] know what's strange about that
[1:03:50] is i in my mind think it's just a
[1:03:52] reading light
[1:03:55] but in the winter time i read a lot and
[1:03:58] i'm sitting there under that light and
[1:04:00] i don't feel now why would god allow
[1:04:03] that to happen in my life
[1:04:06] why didn't god just make me happy
[1:04:09] all four seasons
[1:04:14] but god's still god in the middle
[1:04:17] of the storm god is still god
[1:04:21] in the middle of the winter amen
[1:04:25] we as humans have certain ways we cope
[1:04:28] you might say
[1:04:30] some of us well okay i'll just say it
[1:04:34] sometimes when i feel a little
[1:04:37] i eat everything in sight
[1:04:40] now i know i'm not alone
[1:04:44] i don't feel so happy today
[1:04:47] fridge comes open that looks good that
[1:04:50] looks good that looks good cabinet
[1:04:52] twinkies eat a box
[1:04:56] honey make me some ice cream make me a
[1:04:59] cake make me a pie make me cookies
[1:05:01] and she's like all at once
[1:05:04] yes that's our way of coping
[1:05:08] but what did god give us my brother and
[1:05:10] sister the real
[1:05:12] coping mechanism of a son or daughter of
[1:05:15] god
[1:05:15] is not what we stuff in the face of this
[1:05:18] flesh
[1:05:19] but it's what we put into the soul is
[1:05:22] how we are going to cope
[1:05:23] amen we cannot find one thing that will
[1:05:26] satisfy this flesh
[1:05:28] that will fix our problem but when we
[1:05:31] can
[1:05:31] find the remedy amen when we can come
[1:05:34] into that place
[1:05:36] that we are in communion with god
[1:05:39] amen we find that suddenly the things
[1:05:42] around us
[1:05:43] are not my brother and sister nearly as
[1:05:45] bad as we
[1:05:46] thought they were satan's over there
[1:05:48] whispering this is the worst
[1:05:50] now brother jason would know we had i
[1:05:54] i don't know it might even have been
[1:05:55] brother jason that started this but we
[1:05:57] still have this culture around the farm
[1:05:59] and
[1:05:59] things go wrong and things are whatever
[1:06:02] and and you know there's a certain voice
[1:06:03] you have to say it in you can't just say
[1:06:05] it it loses its whole deal
[1:06:07] but we'll do it just happened yesterday
[1:06:08] and and you're talking about well this
[1:06:10] was this and i i
[1:06:11] oh this piece that fell off this piece
[1:06:13] of equipment i found it out in the field
[1:06:15] and
[1:06:15] smashed in the dirt and and it's there
[1:06:18] and jesus is like oh this is the worst
[1:06:23] and you stop saints and realize no it's
[1:06:26] not the worst this is nothing
[1:06:31] but in our mind oh this is the worst now
[1:06:33] come on be honest with me
[1:06:35] somewhere in this last week you could
[1:06:36] have if you were familiar with that
[1:06:38] stopped and said oh this
[1:06:39] is the worst no the worst
[1:06:44] is god being absent from our life the
[1:06:47] worst
[1:06:47] my brother and sister is not being in
[1:06:49] communion the worst
[1:06:51] is missing the plan of god
[1:06:56] that's the worst now i'm sorry i hope i
[1:07:00] don't offend no one by putting a tad bit
[1:07:01] of humor without
[1:07:02] but you know i'm telling you when we
[1:07:04] come and we'll hit this in a minute but
[1:07:06] i'm a little ahead of myself
[1:07:07] my brother and sister they'll come a day
[1:07:09] when they're standing in the judgment
[1:07:11] and god will do this and
[1:07:12] i hope you don't feel like i'm slighting
[1:07:14] this but i just want to make this point
[1:07:16] that manner that woman that boy or girl
[1:07:18] that's standing in the presence of
[1:07:19] almighty god
[1:07:20] in the judgment seat and he says depart
[1:07:23] from me
[1:07:25] that'll be a time you can stop and say
[1:07:26] this is the worst
[1:07:30] but till we reach that point my brother
[1:07:32] and sister
[1:07:34] we don't know what the worst is now
[1:07:37] let me interject this i feel bad for
[1:07:39] those people
[1:07:41] that are going to church faithfully
[1:07:44] believe they're being faithfully taught
[1:07:46] and their pastors tell them no matter
[1:07:47] how good you live here
[1:07:49] you're going through the tribulation
[1:07:52] well if you're going through the
[1:07:53] tribulation now this isn't christian
[1:07:55] thinking but i'm just throwing it out
[1:07:56] there
[1:07:57] if you're going through the tribulation
[1:07:59] anyhow
[1:08:00] then why would you really need to live
[1:08:03] good
[1:08:04] right now because when full-blown
[1:08:07] tribulation comes the only option there
[1:08:09] is is to give your life for the gospel
[1:08:11] and so you know you could just live easy
[1:08:13] squeezy and just go on and then
[1:08:15] give your life for the gospel and it's
[1:08:17] all solved you see it doesn't fit the
[1:08:19] word of god it doesn't fit the plan of
[1:08:21] god
[1:08:21] it doesn't fit the whole manifestation
[1:08:24] of the word coming forth
[1:08:25] and coming alive in a people and
[1:08:27] glorifying oh do you feel glorified this
[1:08:30] morning
[1:08:31] the word coming down glorifying a people
[1:08:33] and you say glorifying him
[1:08:35] yes that's right the king of kings the
[1:08:37] lord of lords
[1:08:38] the king of all glory has come down and
[1:08:41] taken abode
[1:08:42] in the life of sons and daughters of god
[1:08:45] and god don't deal in no trash god don't
[1:08:47] deal in no back alley as it were
[1:08:49] god deals in holiness amen
[1:08:52] and when we are called to that holiness
[1:08:54] and we respond to that and we come into
[1:08:56] communion with him
[1:08:57] amen it will not let you live life easy
[1:09:00] squeezy it will not let you live
[1:09:02] haphazardly
[1:09:04] it will continually refine you as the
[1:09:07] refiner's fire
[1:09:08] purifying and purifying and purifying
[1:09:12] until we would be worthy oh i hope you
[1:09:14] understand me
[1:09:15] we'd be worthy to be wrapped around the
[1:09:18] ark
[1:09:19] wrapped around the mercy seat becoming a
[1:09:22] part of the great plan of god
[1:09:25] am i making sense this morning amen now
[1:09:29] look at this
[1:09:30] old testament brother brown says this i
[1:09:32] i didn't feel the need to even
[1:09:34] bring quotes concerning this it's
[1:09:35] scriptural old testament god was
[1:09:37] expressed through the law
[1:09:39] so there was man trying to live it man
[1:09:41] making an effort
[1:09:42] but yet if you realize my brother and
[1:09:44] sister
[1:09:46] this is why saints now if this is it
[1:09:48] comes a little sharp to you forgive me
[1:09:50] but i love you and i feel the need to
[1:09:52] see
[1:09:53] this is why taking communion once in a
[1:09:55] blue moon
[1:09:56] is not sufficient because the believer
[1:09:59] in those days come and offered a lamb
[1:10:02] once a year for his sin walked out
[1:10:05] sinned again
[1:10:08] but communion comes with an
[1:10:09] accountability
[1:10:12] it comes with the need to examine
[1:10:15] ourself you say well
[1:10:19] i i know this is teachings even within
[1:10:21] the message well we we don't need to
[1:10:23] take communion
[1:10:24] well my brother and sister that's not
[1:10:26] what the scripture says
[1:10:29] i don't care what brother so and so from
[1:10:31] so and so says
[1:10:33] the scripture says
[1:10:37] old testament god was expressed through
[1:10:39] the law nothing wrong with the law you
[1:10:41] know that saints
[1:10:42] nothing at all wrong with the law people
[1:10:45] get this idea especially in the world
[1:10:46] that's being preached today no no we're
[1:10:48] not under the law no more we're under
[1:10:49] grace we're under grace
[1:10:50] but jesus come along and put clarity to
[1:10:53] that
[1:10:53] and he said you know what here we are uh
[1:10:56] uh er er
[1:10:57] well let me not get ahead of myself okay
[1:11:00] please paul
[1:11:01] new testament now god is expressed
[1:11:04] through grace
[1:11:05] and we can put a quotation mark there
[1:11:07] and put mercy behind that
[1:11:09] because grace is mercy when god bestows
[1:11:13] his grace upon you and i
[1:11:14] he is giving us a dispensation of mercy
[1:11:18] that he is laying out upon us otherwise
[1:11:21] we would be accountable
[1:11:23] and have to pay the price for whatever
[1:11:25] it is that we have transgressed of the
[1:11:27] law
[1:11:28] and so we look at this now and we come
[1:11:30] here now let's just look at matthew 5
[1:11:33] starting with first verse and seeing the
[1:11:35] multitudes he went up into a mountain
[1:11:37] and when he was said his disciples came
[1:11:39] unto him and he opened his mouth and
[1:11:41] taught them
[1:11:43] saying blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:11:46] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:11:48] blessed are they that mourn for they
[1:11:50] shall be comforted
[1:11:52] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:11:53] inherit the earth
[1:11:55] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:11:57] thirst after righteousness
[1:12:01] for they shall be filled
[1:12:04] saints don't sit around hungry
[1:12:07] don't sit around spiritually famished
[1:12:11] spiritually anorexic
[1:12:16] he said if you will seek after it
[1:12:19] you will be filled
[1:12:25] so if anybody's sitting here this
[1:12:26] morning not filled
[1:12:28] don't blame god don't blame your church
[1:12:31] don't blame your pastor
[1:12:33] you yourself have to hunger and thirst
[1:12:40] well i said are they merciful for they
[1:12:43] shall
[1:12:43] obtain mercy now i want to just
[1:12:47] speak for just a moment upon that just
[1:12:49] to make a point
[1:12:50] my brother and sister when we uh fall
[1:12:53] under a judgmental spirit
[1:12:55] when we fall under a spirit or we look
[1:12:57] around and i see what's wrong with you
[1:12:59] and you and you and you and you and you
[1:13:01] and you and you but i don't
[1:13:03] see what's wrong with me you see that is
[1:13:07] a contrary stubborn spirit
[1:13:11] it also is a selfish spirit
[1:13:14] it is also now pardon me you won't find
[1:13:16] this listed this way
[1:13:18] in the bible but i'm just going to speak
[1:13:19] plain this morning it's also
[1:13:21] an ignorant spirit because somehow or
[1:13:25] another
[1:13:25] you feel qualified to judge when the
[1:13:28] scripture
[1:13:29] says judge yourself lest you would be
[1:13:31] judged and so we
[1:13:32] feel like we're qualified to judge
[1:13:34] everyone around us
[1:13:36] but we are not interested in judging
[1:13:39] ourselves
[1:13:40] you see that's a very detrimental
[1:13:42] position to be
[1:13:43] in and i pray to god that we would just
[1:13:45] kick that spirit out
[1:13:46] never let it take root in our our lives
[1:13:49] and never raise our children up in that
[1:13:51] kind of atmosphere
[1:13:52] because you see blessed are the merciful
[1:13:56] for they shall obtain mercy and i can
[1:13:59] see this morning every one of us
[1:14:01] needs mercy not one of us is going to
[1:14:04] live such a perfect
[1:14:06] righteous life but what we will come to
[1:14:08] the day
[1:14:09] we need god's mercy and the prophet of
[1:14:12] god said if i can just put it in this
[1:14:13] context and tie it together
[1:14:15] you backslide every day
[1:14:20] so that means every day i need mercy
[1:14:24] can you agree with me every day we need
[1:14:28] mercy
[1:14:30] so let's be merciful
[1:14:37] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:14:39] shall see god and blessed are the
[1:14:40] peacemakers for they shall
[1:14:42] be called the children of god blessed
[1:14:45] are they
[1:14:46] which are persecuted for righteousness
[1:14:48] sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:14:51] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:14:53] and persecute you
[1:14:55] and shall say all manner of evil against
[1:14:58] against you falsely
[1:14:59] for my sake rejoice and be exceeding
[1:15:02] glad
[1:15:04] see how the sudden transition here
[1:15:08] no one likes that somebody speaks down
[1:15:10] about you somebody speaks hard words
[1:15:11] about you
[1:15:12] i'm telling you those words can be
[1:15:14] crushing
[1:15:18] but he comes right along and says
[1:15:19] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[1:15:21] is your reward in heaven
[1:15:22] for so persecuted they the prophets
[1:15:24] which were before you
[1:15:26] ye are the salt of the earth is there
[1:15:28] any salt here this morning
[1:15:29] but if the salt has lost his testimony
[1:15:37] amen
[1:15:38] are you with me i'm not trying to change
[1:15:40] the scripture
[1:15:41] but if the salt has lost its testimony
[1:15:45] where people wonder are they backslid
[1:15:48] what's happening in their life you see
[1:15:50] my brother and sister if the salt
[1:15:51] has lost his savor wherewith shall it be
[1:15:55] salted
[1:15:56] it is thenceforth good for nothing but
[1:15:58] to be cast out
[1:15:59] and be trodden under foot of men you are
[1:16:02] the light of the world i love how this
[1:16:03] just comes
[1:16:04] with a little chastisement and then an
[1:16:06] encouragement chastisement and an
[1:16:08] encouragement over and over again it
[1:16:10] wants you to be aware so you can judge
[1:16:12] yourself
[1:16:13] but he's coming right there to encourage
[1:16:15] you to not get too
[1:16:17] too down and out about your position
[1:16:19] amen you are the light of the world
[1:16:21] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[1:16:24] hid that's you
[1:16:25] you wonder why you walk through the
[1:16:28] stores you walk through whatever you're
[1:16:30] at work or whatever
[1:16:31] and you seem to be the uh kind of the
[1:16:33] oddball that's there
[1:16:35] because you are the light you are the
[1:16:37] city that's been set on a hill
[1:16:38] and god's not gonna let you be hid
[1:16:41] neither do men light a candle
[1:16:43] and put it under a bushel but on a
[1:16:45] candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[1:16:47] that are in the house
[1:16:48] let your light so shine before men that
[1:16:51] they may see
[1:16:52] your good works and glorify your father
[1:16:55] which is in heaven
[1:16:56] now my brother and sister i i think it's
[1:16:58] really i i've decided it's a complex and
[1:17:01] that's just an opinion so don't don't
[1:17:03] get too upset but when we
[1:17:04] go around all the time quantifying and
[1:17:07] we speak
[1:17:08] well you know what i was there and i
[1:17:10] felt led to lay hands maybe a momma
[1:17:12] might feel this way
[1:17:13] laying hands on her baby that doesn't
[1:17:15] feel good or something
[1:17:16] and you know it'd be like saying well i
[1:17:18] was there and and you know this happened
[1:17:20] and i laid hands on my child and i
[1:17:22] prayed
[1:17:23] and god came on the scene and then right
[1:17:25] behind that will be like
[1:17:26] well you know i i'm not this and i'm not
[1:17:29] that and i'm not
[1:17:30] my brother and sister you don't need to
[1:17:32] back up on that
[1:17:34] it was almighty god who come down and
[1:17:36] channeled himself
[1:17:38] through you and you are then god's
[1:17:41] chosen receptacle
[1:17:43] for the word don't back up i'm not
[1:17:46] worthy and i wasn't this and i wasn't
[1:17:48] you don't need to do that
[1:17:49] god would not have performed that work
[1:17:51] through you if he did not judge you
[1:17:53] worthy
[1:17:54] so we don't need to sit here and in our
[1:17:56] flesh start backing it up like well
[1:17:58] i wasn't nothing it just this it was
[1:18:00] that no my brother and sister stand
[1:18:02] on who you are i am a son of god i'm a
[1:18:05] daughter of god
[1:18:06] i am set as a light on a lamb stand i am
[1:18:10] set as a city on the hill
[1:18:12] with the light shining that's who i am
[1:18:16] i am not looked at by my god as some
[1:18:19] worthless no good but i guess i got no
[1:18:22] one else i'll
[1:18:23] use them kind of a person we are god's
[1:18:27] chosen we are god's elected and we don't
[1:18:30] boast of who we are
[1:18:32] we boast of jesus christ in us
[1:18:36] that's what we boast of but we're not
[1:18:38] going to oh my brother and sister we
[1:18:39] don't need to boast
[1:18:40] oh oh oh oh look over here brother so
[1:18:43] and so
[1:18:44] such a great man of god if i could be
[1:18:46] like him then be
[1:18:47] like him get in the word
[1:18:53] get a life be like him
[1:18:57] now lest any of you think i'm a
[1:18:59] hypocrite i'm subject to the very words
[1:19:01] i'm preaching
[1:19:06] old testament expressed through the law
[1:19:10] new testament expressed through grace
[1:19:14] now look at this let your light so shine
[1:19:17] before men
[1:19:18] that they may see your good works
[1:19:21] you know what you can be identified with
[1:19:23] your good works
[1:19:24] you don't have to like do this and then
[1:19:27] disclaim it well
[1:19:28] you know because let me put it this way
[1:19:32] to you
[1:19:34] everybody around you knows
[1:19:37] it was god in you because everyone
[1:19:40] around you
[1:19:41] is human just like you are
[1:19:46] we don't need to say well you know i
[1:19:48] down myself down myself i don't want to
[1:19:50] sound boastful down myself
[1:19:53] no sir every one of us that's serving
[1:19:55] god knows
[1:19:57] we are who we are by the grace
[1:20:00] of god because every one of us as humans
[1:20:05] recognize
[1:20:05] i can't do this i can't do this in my
[1:20:08] flesh
[1:20:12] now this is really the scripture out of
[1:20:14] all of those right there that i wanted
[1:20:16] to
[1:20:16] tie together think not that i am come to
[1:20:19] destroy the law
[1:20:21] in other words do away or abolish
[1:20:25] set aside or negate right
[1:20:28] don't think i come to do that
[1:20:33] see the spirit of the world we live in
[1:20:34] is we're not under law we're not under
[1:20:36] the law we're under grace wonder of
[1:20:37] grace we're under grace
[1:20:38] you know what grace is
[1:20:42] it's the revelation of the law
[1:20:46] because by revelation of the law we
[1:20:48] recognize no man is able
[1:20:51] but we have one who is able
[1:20:55] and for generations they brought their
[1:20:56] turtle dove their
[1:20:58] lamb they're bullock and they offered
[1:21:01] them
[1:21:02] because they desired forgiveness for
[1:21:04] their sin
[1:21:05] but it never changed the inner man but
[1:21:08] under the dispensation of the new
[1:21:10] testament
[1:21:11] the word is now written on the heart
[1:21:15] of sons and daughters of god it's no
[1:21:17] longer requiring
[1:21:18] a tablet aren't you glad in an age where
[1:21:22] tablets are everything
[1:21:24] we don't need a tablet any longer it's
[1:21:27] been written
[1:21:28] on our hearts amen i'm not come to
[1:21:30] destroy but to fulfill
[1:21:33] for verily i said unto you till heaven
[1:21:34] and earth pass one jot
[1:21:36] or one tittle shall in no wise pass from
[1:21:39] the law
[1:21:40] till all be fulfilled so all these
[1:21:42] people that are preaching were no longer
[1:21:43] in the law no under the law
[1:21:45] don't believe this scripture right here
[1:21:47] they had to take a marker and block
[1:21:49] it out of their bible or else they're
[1:21:52] just
[1:21:53] preaching contrary
[1:21:57] are we doing okay now
[1:22:00] my brother and sister i would say of
[1:22:02] this scripture right here
[1:22:04] lord i i don't want to do away with the
[1:22:05] parts i struggle with come on
[1:22:11] lord don't don't just do away with the
[1:22:14] parts of the bible that i struggle with
[1:22:16] right lust of the flesh pride of life
[1:22:19] there's a whole list of things that
[1:22:20] humanity struggles with
[1:22:22] lord don't take that away don't black it
[1:22:25] out
[1:22:26] lord let me
[1:22:31] fulfill all of the word
[1:22:36] there's just as simple as lord take that
[1:22:38] away
[1:22:39] you can say lord let me fulfill all of
[1:22:41] the word
[1:22:42] that's for your bride you see i don't
[1:22:45] want all the word there's some people in
[1:22:47] there that are going in the pit
[1:22:49] i don't have anything to do with you and
[1:22:50] i right so here it is
[1:22:52] it's just as easy my brother and sister
[1:22:55] amen it's just oh
[1:22:57] hallelujah it's just as easy for us to
[1:23:00] stop and say lord forgive me
[1:23:02] and help me do better as it is to say
[1:23:05] that doesn't
[1:23:06] apply to me just as easy my brother and
[1:23:10] sister but they yield
[1:23:11] such entirely different results
[1:23:14] amen so i i say this this is my heart
[1:23:18] as i was putting this down writing all
[1:23:20] this out uh
[1:23:21] lord let me fulfill all that pertains
[1:23:24] not just according to scripture
[1:23:25] see that that's a good position to claim
[1:23:27] but lord i want to claim
[1:23:29] and fulfill all that pertains to your
[1:23:31] wife
[1:23:33] amen not just some character in the
[1:23:35] bible or some character on the earth now
[1:23:38] i want to fulfill what pertains to your
[1:23:40] wife
[1:23:41] the bride of jesus christ i want to be
[1:23:44] specifically
[1:23:45] identified amen you know if you've ever
[1:23:48] been to the doctor's office or you've
[1:23:50] ever been somewhere
[1:23:51] you know they don't just walk out and
[1:23:53] say next
[1:23:55] because no one knows who's next they
[1:23:58] identify you
[1:24:00] mr paul halett this is paul haylett or
[1:24:03] mrs jerry haylett or however be
[1:24:05] identified
[1:24:05] see a very specific identification is
[1:24:09] placed with that
[1:24:09] now my brother and sister you know i say
[1:24:12] this with a little bit tongue-in-cheek
[1:24:13] the prophet of god said you know you
[1:24:14] should read your bible and identify with
[1:24:16] someone
[1:24:17] in the bible and unfortunately i i just
[1:24:19] love to identify with the apostle paul
[1:24:22] good things bad things whatever but i
[1:24:24] i've got a name right there i can
[1:24:26] identify with
[1:24:27] but you see the word of god is such by
[1:24:29] revelation as you hear the word coming
[1:24:32] forth
[1:24:32] it is speaking to you in such an
[1:24:34] intimate
[1:24:35] fashion that you actually hear god
[1:24:38] calling your name
[1:24:39] it is no longer oh there's going to be
[1:24:41] someone that's going to fulfill this
[1:24:42] there's going to be someone who's going
[1:24:44] to be saved there's going to be someone
[1:24:45] fill
[1:24:46] the holy ghost there's going to be
[1:24:47] someone that no my brother and sister
[1:24:49] you're hearing that
[1:24:50] oh i hope you can identify with that
[1:24:52] this morning and you
[1:24:54] actually hear god speaking your name
[1:24:57] and you know he was speaking to me
[1:25:00] hallelujah not just on some random
[1:25:02] character but speaking to me
[1:25:05] now i want to jump over here and look in
[1:25:07] leviticus
[1:25:11] leviticus 16 and he shall take a censer
[1:25:14] 1612 and he shall take a sensor full of
[1:25:17] bullet
[1:25:18] burning coals of fire from off the altar
[1:25:21] before god before the lord and his hands
[1:25:25] full of sweet incense beaten small in
[1:25:27] other words not some great big sticks
[1:25:32] beaten
[1:25:35] and bring it within the veil
[1:25:40] and he shall put the incense upon the
[1:25:42] fire before the lord
[1:25:44] that the cloud of the incense may cover
[1:25:46] the mercy seat
[1:25:47] that is upon the testimony that he die
[1:25:50] not
[1:25:52] you see if one walked in there then
[1:25:54] without that incense
[1:25:56] to burn before
[1:26:00] the mercy seat of pandey alter
[1:26:04] the ark containing the testimony that
[1:26:06] man died
[1:26:08] in other words coming into the holiest
[1:26:10] of holies was such a sacred thing
[1:26:14] that if god says you have to have a sash
[1:26:17] with a purple thread and
[1:26:18] you have to have a pomegranate and you
[1:26:20] have to wash yourself before you put
[1:26:22] these garments on and you have to pour
[1:26:24] oil anointing upon your head
[1:26:27] if you didn't do those they pulled you
[1:26:29] back out
[1:26:30] with a rope now saints i i say this a
[1:26:33] little tongue-in-cheek okay i hope you
[1:26:35] don't mind
[1:26:36] i'm in good humor this morning
[1:26:40] church would be a whole lot different
[1:26:44] church would be a whole lot different if
[1:26:46] we looked out here to the center island
[1:26:48] there was a bunch of ropes going
[1:26:50] out the back door
[1:26:54] and people come in here angry and mad
[1:26:57] and
[1:26:58] disrespectful and we'd need a deacon the
[1:27:02] size of brother ivan because
[1:27:06] it might be hard to pull some of us out
[1:27:07] through the feet and around the deal and
[1:27:09] down the aisle come on church it'd be a
[1:27:12] whole different atmosphere
[1:27:14] saints but it is the same today
[1:27:19] god just didn't put physical death
[1:27:22] upon them he put spiritual death
[1:27:26] apart
[1:27:30] and he shall put incense upon the fire
[1:27:32] before the lord that the cloud of the
[1:27:33] incense
[1:27:34] may cover the mercy seat that is upon
[1:27:36] the testimony
[1:27:38] that he die not and he shall take the
[1:27:40] blood of the bullock
[1:27:41] and sprinkle it with his finger upon the
[1:27:43] mercy seat eastward
[1:27:45] and before the mercy seat shall he
[1:27:46] sprinkle the blood with his fingers
[1:27:48] seven
[1:27:49] times now we look at this my brother and
[1:27:51] sister and
[1:27:52] these words right here are actually
[1:27:55] words that were directed
[1:27:56] to aaron and you see if you go back and
[1:27:59] study your
[1:28:00] your bible you'll see that aaron had two
[1:28:02] sons that were dis
[1:28:03] disrespectful to the word of god and it
[1:28:06] cost them their life
[1:28:07] amen it didn't matter that they were
[1:28:09] prophet sons and they were disrespectful
[1:28:12] to the word of god
[1:28:13] and people say now can god get angry now
[1:28:16] my brother and sister
[1:28:17] just type in the word wrath in your
[1:28:19] bible app app and just see how many
[1:28:21] times the word wrath
[1:28:22] shows up god is a god that does not
[1:28:26] put up with nonsense
[1:28:32] come on we can come to church all we
[1:28:36] want we can have all the nonsense we
[1:28:38] want we can just play like it's a big
[1:28:39] game
[1:28:40] but my brother and sister when god
[1:28:42] reaches the end of his patience to a man
[1:28:45] you will find that all through scripture
[1:28:48] god took their life
[1:28:51] because said i'm done with you you
[1:28:53] refuse
[1:28:54] to line up to the word you refuse to
[1:28:56] honor me you refuse to give worship and
[1:28:58] praise you refuse these things i'm done
[1:29:01] with you
[1:29:01] and you will find that god has a way of
[1:29:04] letting the people know
[1:29:05] time after time year after year decade
[1:29:08] after decade
[1:29:09] and you say oh oh and now i'm all
[1:29:11] depressed brother paul
[1:29:12] no my brother and sister god rich in
[1:29:14] mercy
[1:29:15] god rich in mercy we're not talking
[1:29:17] about the son or daughter of god that
[1:29:18] the devil's trying to keep them
[1:29:20] and drag them back out of the house of
[1:29:22] god we're talking about the person who
[1:29:24] has
[1:29:24] absolute disrespect to the word and
[1:29:26] presence of god
[1:29:28] so don't get all concerned about a son
[1:29:30] or daughter or husband or wife whatever
[1:29:31] it might be
[1:29:32] don't get all shook up that they might
[1:29:34] have no my brother and sister
[1:29:35] god rich in mercy but i'll tell you what
[1:29:39] we've dealt with people
[1:29:40] unfortunately my poor wife was a witness
[1:29:42] to some of these things dealt with
[1:29:44] people that
[1:29:44] mockingly speak even this message right
[1:29:47] back in your face
[1:29:48] well if amen okay i'm sorry
[1:29:52] but i i'm going to move back a little
[1:29:53] distance i don't know how big
[1:29:55] the bolt of lightning or the fire might
[1:29:57] be i'm just going to go ahead and move
[1:29:59] back a little away from you
[1:30:00] and people are like well shouldn't you
[1:30:01] show love and grace to them well i'll
[1:30:03] tell you what my brother and sister i'll
[1:30:05] show love and grace to him but i'll do
[1:30:06] it at a distance while i pray for him
[1:30:11] come on
[1:30:15] am i making sense hallelujah i hope i am
[1:30:19] i pray i am i seriously pray i am you
[1:30:22] see sometimes all these things
[1:30:25] just come in such a fashion to you that
[1:30:27] it's like lord
[1:30:28] help i know they go together i know it's
[1:30:30] connected but lord i need your help to
[1:30:32] to bind and tie all this together that
[1:30:35] don't lose you on the trail so to speak
[1:30:38] you see now incense
[1:30:41] come even there in the tabernacle
[1:30:44] we have the ark amen
[1:30:48] contains the testimony we have the mercy
[1:30:51] seat
[1:30:52] and we have the incense being burnt
[1:30:55] there
[1:30:56] this is not my brother and sister a
[1:30:58] sprig
[1:31:00] is that the right word a twig
[1:31:03] sprayed we don't just bring a little
[1:31:06] sprig of
[1:31:07] incense in put it on the altar
[1:31:10] it required enough incense
[1:31:13] that it covered all of the mercy seat
[1:31:17] and all of the ark and filled the room
[1:31:22] or have you noticed brothers the rope
[1:31:25] hasn't moved for a while
[1:31:28] we don't hear the tinkling of the bell
[1:31:32] oh my
[1:31:37] we tug the rope and it doesn't tug back
[1:31:41] oh my do you think they reveled or
[1:31:45] rejoiced in that
[1:31:46] no no no no more than we should revel or
[1:31:49] rejoice in this day
[1:31:51] no matter how contrary somebody in the
[1:31:53] flesh has been to you
[1:31:54] we should never rejoice or revel in
[1:31:58] in their calamity and their misfortune
[1:32:00] in what's happening in their life
[1:32:03] or families or whatever you should never
[1:32:04] there's something wrong if we do
[1:32:06] amen we're lacking the holy ghost our
[1:32:08] own self amen
[1:32:10] so it's there you see that he had to
[1:32:12] come and do this
[1:32:13] so the cloud of the incense
[1:32:17] may cover the mercy seat that is upon
[1:32:19] the testimony that he die not
[1:32:21] now i hope that you'll look at this my
[1:32:24] brother and sister and recognized now
[1:32:26] chapter 16 all these connecting uh
[1:32:28] scriptures
[1:32:29] uh were all in that day in a physical
[1:32:32] sense right
[1:32:32] they did this you must do this you must
[1:32:34] do that now you
[1:32:35] need to by revelation by god dealing
[1:32:38] with you opening up to you you need to
[1:32:40] recognize every one of those is now
[1:32:42] manifested in the spiritual realm
[1:32:44] today amen we are no longer
[1:32:47] carrying a bundle of incense putting it
[1:32:49] on fire we're no longer doing
[1:32:51] all of these things we don't have to
[1:32:52] have the thread of the pomegranate we
[1:32:55] don't have to
[1:32:55] pour the oil physically on our head so
[1:32:58] that it run down our beard and down our
[1:32:59] garment and dripped on the floor
[1:33:01] there's all those things that we're
[1:33:02] pertaining to going into the holiest
[1:33:04] holidays we don't do that in a physical
[1:33:06] realm any longer but we must be doing it
[1:33:09] in a spiritual realm we must be coming
[1:33:12] my brother and sister
[1:33:13] not haphazardly entering in and exiting
[1:33:16] out not haphazardly performing the
[1:33:18] duties
[1:33:19] as a priest of our home a son or
[1:33:21] daughter of god
[1:33:22] we shouldn't be haphazardly doing that
[1:33:24] because it will yield the same results
[1:33:27] only one now is no longer physical
[1:33:29] it's all in the spiritual element and so
[1:33:31] we must make this connection to our day
[1:33:34] and as i said let me remind you this is
[1:33:37] just
[1:33:38] a portion of several maybe lord willing
[1:33:41] future uh thoughts or opening up of this
[1:33:46] now we're gonna jump to revelations the
[1:33:47] fifth chapter
[1:33:49] and he says i saw in the right hand of
[1:33:52] him that said on the throne a book
[1:33:53] written within
[1:33:54] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:33:56] seals
[1:33:58] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:34:00] with a loud voice
[1:34:01] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:34:04] loose the seals thereof
[1:34:05] so this loud voice my brother and sister
[1:34:07] thundered through heaven and earth
[1:34:10] it was not a whisper it was not just an
[1:34:12] echo
[1:34:13] but it was a voice that encompassed
[1:34:15] heavens
[1:34:16] and earth and no man in heaven nor on
[1:34:19] earth see the reason i say that
[1:34:21] is it had to be heard in earth too or
[1:34:23] else this wouldn't be accurate
[1:34:26] no man in heaven nor in earth neither
[1:34:28] under the earth was able to open the
[1:34:30] book
[1:34:30] neither neither to look thereon and i
[1:34:33] wept much because no man was found
[1:34:35] worthy to open
[1:34:36] and to read the book and neither to look
[1:34:38] thereon
[1:34:39] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[1:34:42] not
[1:34:43] i'll tell you what i can go back to a
[1:34:45] stage in my life and i hope you
[1:34:47] understand this connection i can go back
[1:34:49] to a stage in my life
[1:34:52] where a man i'm sure anointed of god
[1:34:58] looked at me and in the very essence of
[1:35:01] this right here
[1:35:03] spoke these words to me now they sounded
[1:35:07] entirely different
[1:35:08] but what touched in my heart was the
[1:35:11] same effort right here
[1:35:15] because reality when a son or daughter
[1:35:17] of god is backslid
[1:35:19] whether you see it on the outside or not
[1:35:22] they do a lot of weeping
[1:35:25] they find no joy in the world around
[1:35:27] them
[1:35:28] come on any of you ever been backslidden
[1:35:31] you realize there's no joy in nothing
[1:35:34] you can buy a new this and a new that
[1:35:36] and go here and go
[1:35:37] there and nothing satisfies nothing
[1:35:38] makes you happy and people are like i
[1:35:40] don't know what's wrong with him there's
[1:35:42] something wrong with her
[1:35:43] i i we don't know i i tell you once
[1:35:45] you've been there you can recognize the
[1:35:46] symptoms
[1:35:47] what they need is a serious inoculation
[1:35:49] of the holy ghost
[1:35:51] amen and that'll satisfy those things
[1:35:53] down in the soul
[1:35:54] people are like well you know why'd you
[1:35:56] start drinking or doing this or doing
[1:35:58] that
[1:35:58] well i just wasn't happy and i just kind
[1:36:00] of helped me drown it well let me
[1:36:02] introduce you to a better way to drown
[1:36:03] that
[1:36:08] no man was found worthy weep not

[1:36:48] horns and seven eyes
[1:36:50] which are the seven spirits of god sent
[1:36:52] forth into all the earth

[1:37:08] redemption
[1:37:11] see this wasn't just any old book this
[1:37:14] is not a history book this is not a
[1:37:16] novel this is not a mystery
[1:37:18] this is a book of redemption
[1:37:22] out of the right hand of him that set
[1:37:24] upon the throne and when he had taken
[1:37:26] the book the four beasts
[1:37:28] and four and twenty elders fell down
[1:37:29] before the lamb having every one of them
[1:37:32] harps and golden vials full of odors
[1:37:35] which are the prayers of the saints
[1:37:40] oh hallelujah and they
[1:37:43] sang a new song thou art worthy
[1:37:47] to take the book and to open the seals
[1:37:50] thereof
[1:37:51] for thou was slain and hast redeemed us

[1:38:14] himself
[1:38:14] he poured the very life that was in that
[1:38:17] book of redemption
[1:38:18] poured it right into you and made it
[1:38:21] alive
[1:38:22] and has made us to our god kings and
[1:38:25] priests
[1:38:25] and we shall reign can somebody say i'm
[1:38:28] going to reign
[1:38:30] hallelujah we often look oh oh when we
[1:38:33] have a rapture we go in the millennium
[1:38:35] when we go to heaven
[1:38:36] we're right here and the word says that
[1:38:38] we are going to reign on this earth
[1:38:40] hallelujah you don't need to look much
[1:38:42] further no this is not prosperity gospel
[1:38:45] this is not dominion gospel my brother
[1:38:47] and sister this is the word
[1:38:49] made real to you and i to know that
[1:38:51] overcoming power
[1:38:53] in this book of redemption has empowered
[1:38:55] you and i to stand here today
[1:38:57] and claim every promise stand on that
[1:38:59] promise and watch it be manifesting
[1:39:02] oh hallelujah i'll tell you is he worthy
[1:39:06] oh could we this morning i i just humor
[1:39:09] me please
[1:39:10] can we say together thou art worthy
[1:39:13] hallelujah lord thou art
[1:39:16] worthy oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:21] thank you lord now look at this
[1:39:26] what do we see now coming forth
[1:39:30] golden vials full of voters
[1:39:37] no longer saints an incense
[1:39:42] that we pack in
[1:39:45] and put on the altar
[1:39:53] the odor that pleased
[1:39:56] god in the holiest of holies
[1:40:00] is now in type and shadow
[1:40:04] been replaced with an odor
[1:40:08] that come from where
[1:40:13] our prayers no longer something we
[1:40:17] collected
[1:40:18] at the market and took
[1:40:22] and offered to god to bring a sweet odor
[1:40:26] before him now what's happened
[1:40:30] it's you and i it's our prayers
[1:40:34] it's coming up and blanketing
[1:40:37] the throne of god no longer my brother
[1:40:41] and sister
[1:40:42] is the fire and opened fire as it were
[1:40:46] consuming combustible
[1:40:50] but it's a fire of the holy ghost that's
[1:40:53] burning the dross burning the life
[1:40:55] and bringing that to come to life you
[1:40:58] see because when the fire is on the
[1:40:59] inside
[1:41:02] the odor will be coming from you
[1:41:09] if you have a prayer life
[1:41:12] you will have a sweet odor
[1:41:15] before the lord if you have the holy
[1:41:19] ghost
[1:41:20] god will know
[1:41:28] it's funny this should come to mind i
[1:41:30] read a brief deal
[1:41:32] we are so individual saints
[1:41:36] that now science i don't know why people
[1:41:38] do research like this but
[1:41:40] now science has decided that even your
[1:41:42] body odor
[1:41:44] is unique to you
[1:41:51] imagine that how'd he do is right
[1:41:56] now i want you the reason i go ahead and
[1:41:57] bring that up is because i want you to
[1:41:58] realize if
[1:41:59] even scientifically our dna right
[1:42:03] can be identified even our body odor is
[1:42:06] a reflection of
[1:42:08] what we are and what we eat and all
[1:42:09] these things
[1:42:12] how beautiful our prayer states
[1:42:15] your prayer is rising up before the
[1:42:18] throne of god
[1:42:19] it's not some just great big odor there
[1:42:21] he's sitting there saying oh
[1:42:22] my daughter she's praying again oh look
[1:42:25] over here yes oh this brother oh look at
[1:42:28] this one look at oh
[1:42:29] look at this my brother and sister
[1:42:32] identified
[1:42:34] identified coming forth
[1:42:39] blanketing once again the throne of
[1:42:42] almighty god
[1:42:44] now look in the message the ark
[1:42:47] the law was a judge the law judged but
[1:42:49] the atonement
[1:42:50] stood between the confessed believer and
[1:42:54] the judgment
[1:42:55] now when the prophet of god says this
[1:42:58] between the confessed believer he is not
[1:43:01] talking about us standing here saying
[1:43:02] i'm a believer
[1:43:03] i'm a believer he's talking about the
[1:43:06] person or individual
[1:43:08] that has confessed everything to god
[1:43:10] he's clean he's been washed by the water
[1:43:13] of the word
[1:43:13] he's poured it all out and he said lord
[1:43:15] forgive me
[1:43:17] that's the kind of confessed believer
[1:43:19] he's talking about
[1:43:20] so the atonement stood between the
[1:43:22] confessed believer in the judgment
[1:43:24] there laid the judgment in the ark ready
[1:43:26] to come forth
[1:43:27] but when it did it couldn't for there
[1:43:30] was an atonement standing between
[1:43:32] it and the believer and the believer
[1:43:35] come and accepted christ in the shadow
[1:43:37] and type shed bread sprinkled upon the
[1:43:40] mercy seat
[1:43:41] then he had mercy and could walk away
[1:43:44] rejoicing
[1:43:45] because he was free from judgment now i
[1:43:47] want you to catch this my brother sister
[1:43:49] because
[1:43:49] everything has to come in its order and
[1:43:52] it's there now
[1:43:53] as it comes and the incense is being
[1:43:56] burnt and the cloud
[1:43:57] of incense is coming around the ark
[1:44:00] around the mercy seat
[1:44:01] and then they come and sprinkle the
[1:44:03] blood so my brother and sister it's so
[1:44:05] interesting because the word shows us
[1:44:07] that without the holy ghost we can't
[1:44:09] even honestly truly declare
[1:44:12] jesus is the christ and without coming
[1:44:14] into that presence of god you say
[1:44:16] but what if it's a sinner he's doing
[1:44:18] there remember it's the sinner's prayer
[1:44:20] his confession
[1:44:21] is what breaks it my brother and sister
[1:44:23] it's not about how many years he was in
[1:44:25] church
[1:44:25] an office he held or what he could
[1:44:27] recite is his confession of lord forgive
[1:44:30] me
[1:44:31] for i am a sinner and is in that
[1:44:33] confession right there my brother and
[1:44:35] sister
[1:44:35] that very first prayer brings a cloud of
[1:44:39] incense before the throne
[1:44:40] and then the sprinkled blood is the
[1:44:43] redemption
[1:44:45] but you can't get redemption without
[1:44:48] the prayer
[1:44:51] because if we believe we can get
[1:44:53] redemption without the prayer
[1:44:56] then we would make a good denominational
[1:45:00] christian
[1:45:04] so the sweet odor starts coming
[1:45:08] and the shed blood is then sprinkled
[1:45:09] upon the mercy sea
[1:45:11] then he had mercy and could walk away
[1:45:14] rejoicing because he was
[1:45:16] free from judgment you know some people
[1:45:18] say you know god's no longer judging us
[1:45:20] but you know that's not correct
[1:45:22] he is judging each and every day
[1:45:25] but you look at my brother and sister
[1:45:27] you look at this
[1:45:28] and when we fail have anybody failed
[1:45:30] lately oh hallelujah i thank you some of
[1:45:33] you are courage enough to lift your
[1:45:34] hands
[1:45:35] amen i'll pray the rest of you come to a
[1:45:37] point you lift your hands
[1:45:39] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:45:41] when we fail when we have things we
[1:45:43] think something we have an attitude and
[1:45:44] emotion
[1:45:45] we we actually do something and we are
[1:45:48] there now look at how god works my
[1:45:50] brother and sister
[1:45:51] he comes and judgment would then come
[1:45:58] judgment can't come upon you
[1:46:01] because there's an atonement so the
[1:46:04] judgment's still present
[1:46:06] the judgment's still active but it can't
[1:46:09] come upon you
[1:46:14] because he can walk away now
[1:46:19] because the atonement stands between him
[1:46:24] and the judgment which would be your sin
[1:46:29] do you see how beautiful that is it says
[1:46:31] blessed is the man who god will not
[1:46:33] impute sin
[1:46:34] why can't he impute it the sin was still
[1:46:36] there and say how can they do that lord
[1:46:38] i just don't understand this can't be
[1:46:40] right but my brother and sister the sin
[1:46:42] comes back to you in the form of
[1:46:43] judgment and comes to the atonement
[1:46:45] and cannot come upon you oh hallelujah
[1:46:50] thank you amen there is therefore now
[1:46:55] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:46:57] christ jesus that walk not after the
[1:46:59] flesh but the spirit
[1:47:00] when a man knows that he's died to the
[1:47:02] things of the world and those that get
[1:47:04] in christ jesus
[1:47:05] walking according to the holy spirit not
[1:47:07] the ways of this sinful world
[1:47:08] there is no condemnation to him he can
[1:47:11] look in the face of hell
[1:47:13] and judgment and rejoice because there's
[1:47:16] the blood of christ
[1:47:17] making atonement standing between him
[1:47:20] and judgment
[1:47:21] hallelujah yeah thank you lord
[1:47:25] amen we stand here today god didn't say
[1:47:28] now you're
[1:47:28] you're going to make a rapture i'm going
[1:47:30] to claim you if you never have a thought
[1:47:32] never have a deed never have nothing
[1:47:34] no he said look i have come and the
[1:47:36] revelation of who you
[1:47:38] are that you will come and your prayer
[1:47:41] lord forgive me for what i thought
[1:47:43] forgive me what i did comes up as a
[1:47:45] sweet odor to the throne
[1:47:47] and it surrounds the mercy seat and god
[1:47:50] says that's all right
[1:47:51] i've covered you with the atonement and
[1:47:53] you are
[1:47:54] free from that hallelujah
[1:47:58] i love this my brother and sister
[1:48:01] i love this amen
[1:48:06] there's because there's the blood of
[1:48:07] christ making atonement
[1:48:09] standing between him amen
[1:48:13] and judgment
[1:48:18] praise the lord our prayers my brother
[1:48:21] and sister
[1:48:24] the incense upon the altar the sweet
[1:48:26] odor before the lord
[1:48:27] you see why satan desires to hinder your
[1:48:29] prayer life
[1:48:32] you see for aaron if he went in there
[1:48:36] without sufficient
[1:48:37] incense that the cloud
[1:48:40] would completely cover that room
[1:48:47] completely hide the mercy seat and the
[1:48:50] ark
[1:48:50] and the testimony he come in there
[1:48:53] without sufficient
[1:48:55] it was death to him you see why satan
[1:48:58] hates this today
[1:48:59] your prayer is coming as a sweet odor
[1:49:02] before god
[1:49:02] and satan recognizes if i can keep them
[1:49:05] from praying
[1:49:06] then there will be nothing in that room
[1:49:08] to cover the mercy seat
[1:49:10] nothing to cover the ark nothing to
[1:49:12] cover the testimony
[1:49:14] and they will slowly spiritually die
[1:49:17] amen oh i just the prophet of god said
[1:49:19] pray every day
[1:49:20] it can be hard come on can we be men and
[1:49:22] women enough to say
[1:49:23] it can be hard amen you find yourself
[1:49:26] just beaten from the
[1:49:28] day all the struggles of whatever it is
[1:49:30] and you realize oh lord i i
[1:49:33] i should have never allowed myself to be
[1:49:35] in that bigger hurry this morning i
[1:49:36] didn't read my bible
[1:49:37] and now i'm ah
[1:49:45] god help us satan don't care whether you
[1:49:48] pray
[1:49:49] what he cares about is the effect of
[1:49:52] your prayers
[1:49:55] and let's not be mechanical i don't know
[1:49:57] how many of you come out of a catholic
[1:49:59] background
[1:50:00] but if you come out of a catholic
[1:50:01] background you're mechanical
[1:50:04] you read your bible mechanically you
[1:50:06] pray mechanically
[1:50:09] don't be a message catholic
[1:50:12] even if all you can muster is two
[1:50:15] minutes get down and say lord forgive me
[1:50:18] for not making priority of you today
[1:50:20] lord forgive me for everything i did
[1:50:22] wrong today lord i love you
[1:50:25] oh lord help me
[1:50:28] amen roll over go to sleep if that's all
[1:50:30] you can get but don't do one of these
[1:50:32] lord i'm so terrible i'm unworthy
[1:50:34] i'm no good lord i don't know why you
[1:50:36] chose me now lord oh maybe i'm not even
[1:50:38] one i feel so beaten i
[1:50:40] i just uh lord i failed you 59 different
[1:50:42] ways today
[1:50:43] that's just the ones you saw
[1:50:47] don't pray that way be sincere
[1:50:52] lord i am sorry
[1:50:59] that's why satan desires to hinder your
[1:51:00] prayer life
[1:51:04] the lord telling moses aaron now look at
[1:51:07] this i don't i
[1:51:08] won't go back into all the aaron
[1:51:12] must have
[1:51:16] incense enough
[1:51:20] to fill the room
[1:51:24] lest he die
[1:51:27] can i be like a dictator pastor this
[1:51:30] morning
[1:51:31] can i come across as just like a bully
[1:51:34] to you this morning
[1:51:38] pray like your life
[1:51:42] depended on it amen
[1:51:46] forget this prayers of convenience paul
[1:51:51] forget this i'll give the lord just
[1:51:54] enough
[1:51:56] until my head hits the pedal
[1:51:59] pray like your life depended on it
[1:52:07] i actually tempered those harsh words i
[1:52:09] was going to say to you
[1:52:12] i realized they applied to me more than
[1:52:14] anybody else and i'm just can't bear
[1:52:15] that judgment this morning
[1:52:22] lord aaron must have sufficient incense
[1:52:27] upon the mercy see verse 13 as we go
[1:52:30] back to that he shall put the incense
[1:52:32] upon the fire before the lord that the
[1:52:35] cloud of the incense may cover the mercy
[1:52:36] seat that is upon the testimony
[1:52:38] that he die not connection my brother
[1:52:42] and sister
[1:52:42] of the overcoming life in jesus christ
[1:52:46] cannot be had without a prayer life
[1:52:49] that's right
[1:52:49] i believe the message i'm sorry do you
[1:52:51] have a prayer life do you have incense
[1:52:53] before the throne of god
[1:52:54] do you have incense before the mercy sea
[1:52:58] but i believe the message brother paul
[1:52:59] god sent a prophet i believe that
[1:53:01] that's well and good if you believe it
[1:53:03] then you'll do what he told us to do
[1:53:05] that's it come on it's been on my heart
[1:53:08] i might preach that and then you guys
[1:53:09] might just vote me out and pitch me on
[1:53:11] the street
[1:53:12] but my brother and sister we hear people
[1:53:14] say say only what the prophet said i'm
[1:53:16] tired of hearing
[1:53:17] that say only what the prophet said i
[1:53:18] want us to listen and do all the prophet
[1:53:21] said
[1:53:22] amen not just the portion that makes us
[1:53:24] happy is
[1:53:25] comfortable the part that everybody can
[1:53:27] jump up and
[1:53:28] and shout hallelujah over but all of
[1:53:31] that
[1:53:32] amen so you can't have an overcoming
[1:53:34] life i'm going to just make that
[1:53:36] connection to you and i hope it don't
[1:53:37] offend you this morning but you
[1:53:39] cannot have an overcoming life unless
[1:53:41] you have a prayer life
[1:53:43] amen now i want to just hurry up close
[1:53:46] here i was so afraid i wouldn't have
[1:53:47] enough to preach on
[1:53:49] amen because the man or the woman that's
[1:53:52] ever been in that
[1:53:53] back desert alone like moses was and the
[1:53:56] revelation of god be made manifest to
[1:53:58] him through the holy ghost
[1:53:59] there's nothing can shake him
[1:54:02] he's just as sound as solid as he can be
[1:54:05] these last lines right here is what
[1:54:09] excited me
[1:54:13] he's just as sound and solid as he can
[1:54:15] be satan
[1:54:16] hates revelation he don't like it at all
[1:54:20] upsets his plans well hallelujah
[1:54:24] i like it when god's a spoiler and the
[1:54:26] devil's like i've got a trap for them
[1:54:28] i've got this i'm going to make this
[1:54:29] happen this is going on that's going on
[1:54:31] there's trouble in their family and this
[1:54:32] is over here
[1:54:32] and someone says this somebody says that
[1:54:34] and god comes right in and delivers you
[1:54:36] from that complex
[1:54:37] and you go out of there praising god and
[1:54:39] you might have a brother
[1:54:40] sister mother father son or daughter or
[1:54:43] whatever it is
[1:54:44] that's just around to you and you walk
[1:54:46] out and they're like well
[1:54:47] that mom ain't even ain't even uh i
[1:54:49] didn't pay attention to me
[1:54:51] why because god come and spoil the
[1:54:54] devil's plans
[1:54:55] because he was there trying to snuff us
[1:54:57] down and get us down to where nobody
[1:54:59] loves me
[1:55:00] how does that go nobody loves me i think
[1:55:03] i'll just eat worms or something like
[1:55:04] that
[1:55:05] some little kid story yeah
[1:55:09] well come on come on now
[1:55:13] y'all don't frown at me but some of you
[1:55:16] come into church with dirt on your face
[1:55:18] so i know you've been eating worms
[1:55:22] come on the devil's a liar
[1:55:26] amen and he hates revelation
[1:55:30] because revelations what sets us free
[1:55:32] from all of our little complexes
[1:55:34] teenagers this world's full of all kinds
[1:55:36] of voices that are going to tell you
[1:55:38] if you want to have fun if you want to
[1:55:40] be something in this life you need to go
[1:55:41] over here and do this sounds good
[1:55:45] until you're the one with needle tracks
[1:55:46] in your arm
[1:55:48] until you're the one that's slouched
[1:55:50] down in an alley somewhere or
[1:55:52] been used by humanity and cast to the
[1:55:54] side then suddenly the devil's no longer
[1:55:57] around
[1:55:58] you're no longer his chosen
[1:56:01] but if you ever was chosen of god you're
[1:56:03] still is chosen
[1:56:05] hallelujah
[1:56:09] now look at this it says right here in
[1:56:13] this quote
[1:56:14] that there's nothing can shake him amen
[1:56:17] who wants to be identified as
[1:56:18] unshakeable amen i want to be identified
[1:56:22] as unshakeable
[1:56:24] oh my so much for my great thing that i
[1:56:27] was going to be done preaching by noon
[1:56:29] can i borrow 20 minutes from whoever
[1:56:32] preaches next
[1:56:33] sermon i think i was going to ask
[1:56:36] brother david to preach this wednesday
[1:56:38] is that okay brother david
[1:56:41] now the mercy seat now the mercy seats
[1:56:45] where in the heart
[1:56:53] so to get to the mercy seat
[1:56:57] you have to have a prayer life
[1:57:00] you have to to recognize it be filled
[1:57:03] with the holy ghost
[1:57:04] amen no wonder god will be off the mercy
[1:57:08] seat
[1:57:09] to so many see so many are thinking oh
[1:57:13] god's leaving the mercy seat there's no
[1:57:15] more mercy for them no more mercy for
[1:57:17] them
[1:57:17] god's left the mercy seat but you see my
[1:57:20] brother and sister
[1:57:21] if he's in the heart of a son or
[1:57:23] daughter of god he never can leave that
[1:57:25] mercy seat
[1:57:27] and so you'll have a whole world that he
[1:57:29] is off the mercy seat
[1:57:30] because he's no longer in their hearts
[1:57:33] he's no longer center of their life so
[1:57:36] therefore he's off
[1:57:37] their mercy seat and while there might
[1:57:39] be judgment upon them
[1:57:41] there is still mercy to the bride of
[1:57:43] jesus christ do you follow me
[1:57:45] hallelujah amen now the mercy seats in
[1:57:49] the heart see where the shining forth
[1:57:51] his glory
[1:57:52] in all of his children the shekinah
[1:57:54] glory in the human heart
[1:57:56] here is a human heart is that right is
[1:57:58] that the mercy seat how do you come
[1:58:00] through
[1:58:01] into that through these different
[1:58:02] systems
[1:58:04] through self-will no you can't come
[1:58:07] through a system
[1:58:08] you can't come through self-will comes
[1:58:11] into here
[1:58:12] and through there comes out what
[1:58:14] shekinah glory
[1:58:16] almighty god coming into you and i can
[1:58:18] somebody say thank you lord
[1:58:20] coming into you and i coming right down
[1:58:23] and then
[1:58:23] manifesting him and turning us into a
[1:58:26] city on a hill
[1:58:27] turning us into a light on a lampstand
[1:58:30] turning us
[1:58:31] into sons and daughters of god
[1:58:33] hallelujah
[1:58:34] chicano glory what is this chicano glory
[1:58:42] amen so if god's not present with us
[1:58:48] we have no second glory
[1:58:51] we have no one in the throne room
[1:58:58] doesn't fit the word my brother and
[1:59:00] sister
[1:59:02] god's presence is right here
[1:59:05] come on sorry to be so demanding this
[1:59:07] morning but can somebody say praise the
[1:59:09] lord
[1:59:10] god's presence in my life god's present
[1:59:13] my life amen he's not waiting for the
[1:59:15] day of the rapture to come
[1:59:17] and be present in my life he is present
[1:59:19] here he is present now
[1:59:21] he is the very second glory the glory
[1:59:23] that falls down in the midst of god's
[1:59:25] people
[1:59:26] is god himself people say well no no
[1:59:28] that's the holy ghost we're
[1:59:30] trying to identify jesus christ and lord
[1:59:32] and god and whatever the prophet of god
[1:59:34] said it's all
[1:59:35] the same it's god
[1:59:39] so we start to dice it up and we say
[1:59:42] this can't be that because i
[1:59:43] i think this is that and that can't be
[1:59:45] there when
[1:59:46] all we're doing is chopping up god
[1:59:49] trying to divide him to fit our
[1:59:51] mental approach to the word
[1:59:57] they don't go into the gambling dead oh
[1:59:59] let me go back up
[2:00:00] what is this kind of glory it's god's
[2:00:02] presence and when a man's walking or a
[2:00:03] woman he's reflecting
[2:00:05] the chicano glory how can you reflect
[2:00:07] something that's not in you
[2:00:10] how could you reflect a life that's not
[2:00:12] in you
[2:00:16] thank you for being here lord thank you
[2:00:19] for being in us today lord
[2:00:21] thank you for your life for your spirit
[2:00:23] for your presence
[2:00:25] hallelujah thank you lord
[2:00:28] he don't go into gambling dens and carry
[2:00:31] on
[2:00:31] and go out here and deny the word
[2:00:35] now look here my brother and sister now
[2:00:37] this could just be me
[2:00:38] i'm closing sister amy musicians would
[2:00:41] you come
[2:00:44] you see when i read this and maybe it's
[2:00:47] just
[2:00:48] the fault of the way i read things
[2:00:54] he don't go into gambling dens
[2:00:58] proper english would put a comma right
[2:01:00] there wouldn't it
[2:01:02] i don't know that's the way i read it
[2:01:04] would be don't go into gambling down
[2:01:06] pawn paws i mean we're not going to try
[2:01:10] and
[2:01:11] tie it all together pause don't go into
[2:01:12] gambling against
[2:01:17] and it doesn't
[2:01:20] carry on i'll let you define what carry
[2:01:23] on means to you
[2:01:25] because you see if i'm legalist
[2:01:30] i'm going to be holding the hatchet over
[2:01:31] your head all the time because you're
[2:01:33] doing whatever you do i might deem that
[2:01:35] as carrying on
[2:01:40] and go out here and deny the word
[2:01:45] now let's let's break this down now
[2:01:49] gambling dan's carrying on
[2:01:53] is actually entirely separate from
[2:01:55] denying the word
[2:01:57] it's broke away from that by pauses by
[2:02:00] spaces
[2:02:01] continuance of thought
[2:02:05] with time to think about it
[2:02:10] and how many people in our day my
[2:02:12] brother sister the prophet preached
[2:02:13] about it over and ago
[2:02:14] talking about a divine healing
[2:02:17] and so many people oh god supernatural
[2:02:19] god god's a great god
[2:02:20] but god's not a healer what were they
[2:02:24] doing
[2:02:25] come on look at the commas look at the
[2:02:27] spaces think about it
[2:02:29] they were denying the word
[2:02:32] now this is going to be a little abrupt
[2:02:34] and i hope you don't offend no one
[2:02:35] we got a lot of people coming
[2:02:39] to life around this message today
[2:02:45] they believe god sent a prophet they
[2:02:47] believe all these things but they'll
[2:02:49] come to something
[2:02:51] in the word of god
[2:02:54] and they'll say that can't be so oh
[2:02:57] listen to the unveiling of god
[2:03:00] you'll see where brother brown is
[2:03:01] talking about it's not the first person
[2:03:02] not the second person not the third
[2:03:04] person
[2:03:05] it's god himself
[2:03:09] and then that will step right down
[2:03:11] pardon me my memory sometimes don't
[2:03:13] really grab this but
[2:03:15] it's within a few paragraphs right there
[2:03:18] and brother brown says and they'll come
[2:03:20] out and say
[2:03:22] that's not so
[2:03:29] now look i i don't mean to put this in
[2:03:31] the way but i'm just going to say it
[2:03:33] i have witnessed those
[2:03:36] very words
[2:03:41] i'm not judging the person in fact i
[2:03:42] prayed for him this morning
[2:03:45] so don't think that i'm i'm just
[2:03:47] brow-beating and throwing hatchets
[2:03:50] but it scared me saints when you quote
[2:03:54] something from the message
[2:03:56] and people say that isn't what he meant
[2:03:59] that's
[2:03:59] not so it's very self-fulfilling
[2:04:04] right there coming to pass
[2:04:08] remember the quote that i read wednesday
[2:04:09] night
[2:04:11] brother brown says i'm not the one to
[2:04:13] answer the question ask the questions
[2:04:14] you're not the one to ask the questions
[2:04:17] we're here just to believe the word
[2:04:22] don't come to a place that the devil
[2:04:23] anoints you with a spirit
[2:04:26] that you would say that's not so
[2:04:30] it's not what the prophet taught us he
[2:04:31] told us you put it on the shelf you ask
[2:04:33] god for revelation you pray about that
[2:04:35] god will answer that for you you see
[2:04:39] you go out there and deny the word
[2:04:43] pretty easy now brother donnie reagan
[2:04:46] i'm sorry brother don't need to throw
[2:04:47] you under the bus here
[2:04:49] but brother donny years and years ago
[2:04:51] made this statement stuck with me i
[2:04:52] can't shake it
[2:04:53] he said the problem we have is we have
[2:04:55] message methodist
[2:04:57] message baptists and message lutherans
[2:04:59] and message
[2:05:00] catholics it's not lit or past
[2:05:06] and control our future
[2:05:09] don't let past understandings
[2:05:13] be your current revelation
[2:05:16] open up and say lord i want to know
[2:05:20] i want to be able to come with complete
[2:05:22] confidence
[2:05:23] to the mercy seat and walk away without
[2:05:26] one bit of condemnation
[2:05:27] not one bit of hindrance in my life and
[2:05:29] when it comes time i use little
[2:05:31] vanessa's example the other night
[2:05:32] terrified her she looked at me all
[2:05:34] bug-eyed like brother paul what are you
[2:05:35] doing
[2:05:36] but we want to be where we as a mama or
[2:05:39] a daddy
[2:05:39] or whatever it is someone else's child
[2:05:42] or uncle whatever it might be
[2:05:43] we want to come to that place when the
[2:05:45] need arises
[2:05:47] we're not stopping they're saying oh god
[2:05:48] could this be could that be how do i do
[2:05:50] this what do i do
[2:05:51] we want to be so anointed by the word
[2:05:53] for our hour that when we need to lay
[2:05:55] hands on a baby
[2:05:56] we just walk over there and say i am
[2:05:58] your son
[2:05:59] i am your daughter and the word says
[2:06:02] it's not me it's you lord but it's you
[2:06:06] in me and i therefore have the authority
[2:06:10] and not let one doubt not let one fear
[2:06:13] not
[2:06:13] one question mark enter into our
[2:06:16] thinking not one oh i'm not a minister
[2:06:19] oh my brother and sister we're sons and
[2:06:21] daughters of god
[2:06:22] and we are filled and anointed with the
[2:06:24] second glory of god
[2:06:27] hallelujah and this will be a future
[2:06:29] sermon but remember the prophet of god
[2:06:31] showed us so clearly
[2:06:32] that it is in the day this day that we
[2:06:36] live
[2:06:36] where once it was death to walk behind
[2:06:39] the veil
[2:06:40] and now it's death not to walk behind
[2:06:43] the veil is
[2:06:44] death now if we don't walk into the
[2:06:46] presence of almighty god
[2:06:48] god help us to stand up amen
[2:06:52] no matter what the people says
[2:06:55] he's got his heart set on one thing
[2:06:59] god oh can we say amen to that this
[2:07:02] morning
