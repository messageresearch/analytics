something home today something they learned something that would make them go deeper into your word thank you now for health and life we pray that it should help us now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated and um we're going to continue the study that we had probably two years ago and we had to um you know couldn't come here for a while but we did finish the chapter 18 we're going to review the chapter 18 of the book of Acts and I just want you to follow along we're going to not go over every verse we may jump over your favorite verse as possible but it's designed for you to go and read your Bible every day when you feel like it not just when grandma called to remind you but every day and so at this point of our study in book of Acts chapter 18 Paul and Silas which is his trusted associate they were in the midst of their second missionary journey and the date is about 49 A.D a long time ago and Paul at this point had already written his letters to the Galatians and uh the letter had also been written to the 12 tribes which we know as the general Epistle of James and of course that's in a chronological Bible ours is set up a little different but those letters are written first so verse 1 of chapter 18 after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth I see a lot of times we just read through that well where are these places well um am I doing something wrong brother Paul no we're going to um have a little translation for some of the Believers that will be benefited are you going to translate so Corinth is about 20 miles west of Athens and Corinth was a city that was well known for idolatry and very bad reputation of the citizens but on the edge of the edge of the city they had a great great Temple now big is not always better sometimes small is better so had this Great temple to the Goddess Diana complete with women priests and every kind of perversion you can imagine I've been there but of course the temple is not there anymore and that's one of the reasons that Paul seemed to be so heavy-handed against women and some were completely out of their place and doing every ungodly thing to speak Spanish we're in Idaho it's okay okay so this great Temple of Diana and Paul seemed to be heavy-handed because there was a lot of women out of control and um uh but uh Paul was very sure of his Revelation um because he preached by Revelation that he'd received from God that's why that I carry this level with me well but Paul we need to make some adjustments here that's so that you can see that we must stay level okay then we'll start I'll say balance not just in you know the way we eat but the way we meet the animals the way we dress and so he um in the church age book in chapter one paragraph 98. brother Brown says we need to call for revelation we need to call on God for Revelation anything else I was young one time I can hear it so he says here we need to call on God for Revelations we have accepted the Bible but still it's not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not okay in the city but if it's not revealed brother said that the job of the ministry was to make Christ real to the peace but we want to make it real to you so uh he says this the word has not been quickened Paul was very sure of his Revelation and so he wrote over to the Galatians back at that point or even if an angel comes down any other gospel see other than that which I have already okay okay it goes straight to the hot place in the corner oh you got an opportunity you know Fables Paul had to deal with the generation of women out of control and William Brandon faced similarly two women um in case you don't know what that means it means balanced in every way okay so there is a continuity Spirit working in the seven Messengers especially similarity between the first messenger and the seventh matches they didn't go away with the prophet has been part of the word of God and it'll be seen in the true followers of the word of God not following personalities we've had too much of that nonsense okay that's right okay because it says over in Genesis 1 every seed after its kind and we assume that if you come to what we call a message church that you're listening to the message you're just growing in the message Baptists are making more Baptist Catholics making more Catholics in the open book you see okay so brother Brown says in Melchizedek the great Prince and King a few nights ago in a prayer meeting a man said to me the Holy Ghost was given only to the twelve on the day of Pentecost well that man didn't know his Bible I said well then what about the 120th that was there at the same time that received it as the twelve how about down at the house of Cornelius when the Gentiles received it 33 years later when Paul asked the Baptist if they'd received the Holy Ghost since they believed he laid his hands on them and then received the Holy Ghost setting the church in order in Corinth and he says um he also said in the church Apostles prophets teachers evangelists Gifts of healing all those marvelous gifts years and years after Pentecost even now you see yeah he goes on says well then uh it is today to every believer going to all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world how many all the people every creature either believeth in his baptized shall be saved and these signs shall follow them my name shall they cast out devils and heal the sickness there you are it's God's promise that he swore he would do it no matter how much Rises up to try to counterfeit or impersonate or how many things rise up to try to contradict it or take it now who in the right mind would want to take down something that said in the word of God they are out there I travel a lot I've seen them they'll look you right in the face and think they're right doesn't matter how many things rise up or try to contradict it or take it down it will go on and on and on for God has swore by himself and he would keep it you see so remember back in Galatians the weeds or even an angel and so I want to just look at that for a minute because he says here in Galatians 1 8. says um but though we or an angel from heaven now if an angel from heaven comes down here and tells Paul now you said I'm going to preach and he says something different I'm sure you guys would be smart enough throw him out right from Heaven preach any other gospel to use that which we have let him be occurred and then being a good teacher he repeats it because some of them weren't paying attention as we said before so I repeat now if any man preach any other gospel that's not just those guys standing around there that's even today so let's go on right now um in chapter 18 and verse two and he found a certain Jew named Aquila that was the man born of um in in pontus and lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Jerome and so he came to them so Paul meets these two people and because he was of the same craft in other words they they had something they did he Abode with them and they worked for by their occupation they were tent makers yeah they made tents they knew how to sew you know and so um they they made what we call affordable mobile buildings for working living traveling like economical RVs today you know and so we find these couple later in another study but uh Paul went to church when the doors were open I see we have brother Brown telling us that if God is living in your heart you can't wait for those doors to open see that sounds good and it's true there's got to be something inside here to attract you that's the word of God it's not personalities okay so they went to church they spoke only to the Jews and some Greeks and um so finally his helpers arrived in verse five from up North but the opposition was very great people were against what he was teaching says Paul was pressed in the spirit you know overcome one translation said he was not free to speak because the Jews opposed him and blasphemed as he testified that Jesus is the Christ I see some people have more patience than others but if somebody's going to say blaspheme what you're saying what you're preaching well we don't have no patience for that time's running out you know so this is a real turning point for Paul he worked hard he endured opposition beatings in prison but now he's facing open blasphemy it's bad you see so what do you do he didn't call Jerusalem he shook the dust off his feet and moved on look at that in verse 6 of 18 and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his reignent and said to them your blood be upon your own heads I am clean from thenceforth I will go to the Gentiles he'd had it with these these Jews that were constantly speaking against the blood of Jesus Christ you know and so sometimes you just got to push delete and go forward some things can't be fixed you know so it does get very emotional sometimes and you see we would like for everybody we'd like for all of our neighbors and our you know relatives to enjoy the truth and live in peace with God but some are just not wired to receive the truth we have what's called predestination some are not wired for truth others are wired for the bars and whatever we don't need a church full of people we just need Believers and so these people you know if you share with them too much they will eventually blaspheme and so you've got to move on and you can only help those that ask for help as soon as the minister understands that the better he can sleep at night because you try to help people and they just blast every time well forget it we got better things to do okay let's look at verse seven and he departed thence and entered into a certain man's house named justice okay and this man worshiped God and his house joined hard to the synagogue that means they shared a wall he lived right there next door to the church okay and uh Christmas the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians heard and believed and were baptized okay it's looking good so far then speak the Lord to Paul in the Night by Vision be not afraid but speak and hold not your peace for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city and to continue there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them so here's Paul in Corinth 18 months setting the church in order and he was there by permission of a vision of the Lord so 12-17 once again we have the fanatical religious Jews they took Paul into court this guy is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law now these weren't you know agnostics these were Prophet believing Jews and they couldn't see past the Old Testament they had that ingrained in them and they couldn't see that the light moved on they were stuck back here with some truth but they were contrary to what kapal was teaching you know and he was only showing Christ from the word you know that they said they knew see he had a Ministry similar to William Branham the Bible says I'm here to tell you this day these scriptures are fulfilled that was basically his message see and so they said they knew it they knew it by see they didn't have Bibles very few people could read and so the priest would read the Bible they would believe and that's what they were stuck with you know well anyway they knew what they what they read but they had no Revelation so they realized when the judge realized this wasn't a civil case but a religious issue he dismissed them all okay out of here you know these people broke no law leave so the Greek citizens were really upset and so they beat up one of the chief rulers of the synagogue the law did nothing just looked the other way sounds like currently police you know same Spirits they haven't died so in verse 18 Paul goes off to Syria but he stopped off in Ephesus so he left equivalent Priscilla in Ephesus and they were very instrumental informing the church in Rome and Corinth and noun Ephesus the great husband and wife team and if you haven't seen the film Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ it is available online you can go buy it very very scriptural film that Hollywood made a few years ago and I even drugged the pastor and his wife into the theater we watched the movie yeah it won't hurt you it's not advised for small kids but it's a very very scriptural movie okay so now Paul's on his third missionary trip strengthening the disciples bringing words of encouragement okay look at verse 24. and a certain Jew named Apollos born in Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only up to the baptism of John okay so meanwhile here's Priscilla and Aquila and this Jewish Man shows up apparently a very gifted teacher he knew his Bible he'd been taught but he lacked Revelation okay and so he was still back there with the baptism of John which was true just wasn't you know current and um it was marvelous in its day but the light had moved on so here's Apollos he's from Alexandria Egypt this was a very important city back then they had a vast Library which burned later but Alexandria is still a chief City in Egypt and that's where the the uh more readable and user-friendly Greek translation was made of the Old Testament commonly called the Septuagint that's where that was done that was finished about 200 years before Christ so Greek was a trade language commonly known amongst that part of the world and that would have been the Bible that Peter quoted from Jerusalem used by all the others uh Apollos and Paul and even today it's the Bible used by the Greek Orthodox Church in Istanbul Turkey there's just a lot of facts we're not going to repeat them so pay attention and so um this church in Turkey is the Eastern Catholic Church Rome is the Roman Catholic Church Headquarters Roman Catholic church and so at one time they were just it was one Church you see until they couldn't agree on Doctrine and they divided in the year 1054. but in February 2016 the two heads got together because it's going to be one church at the end we're going to be the odd man out we don't fit any of their patterns you know but we are the original Catholics we're in line with Peter okay verse 26. and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them so they invited him to lunch and expounded him the way of God more perfectly so more precisely the revelation of the word of God for the day in which they live see not the glare from another day that's right now Billy Graham did his job right each one did their job right but we're living here we take all the scripture we don't cut part of it out we believe it all you see and so they shared with whom what God was doing currently and um uh but there's a there's a certain scriptures allotted for each part of History yes we're living in the seventh age you see so we got all of that to be responsible for and our age so we love the word it feeds our soul but we're looking for the exit of laodicea we want to leave so the message continued to be the same and Apollos was speaking exactly as Paul was teaching showing publicly by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ they had to prove it they never had a resurrection before and so um later you know the other doctrines would be revealed to him so getting into verse 19 chapter 19. so Apollos is holding meetings in Corinth and Paul's traveling and he came in contact with some Believers in Ephesus it was an important city back then of about 350 000 people and um Priscilla and Quilla were there and so he's made some new Believers he says verse two he said to them have you received the Holy Ghost sin she believed and they said we have not so much has even heard of such a thing you know and he said well how were you baptized we're baptized according to John's baptism then he said John truly baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they believe this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came to them on them and they speak with the tongues and prophesied and verse 7 says and all the men were about 12. great Apostle Paul stopped off and ministered to these people that says 12 men so we can assume there might have been some women so there could have been 20 people we don't know but it says 12 men that's a pretty pretty small group you know it's like two benches of people and it's part of part of our our scriptures they spend a lot of time you know putting down the details for our admonition that we could learn we could know how this thing started because we are the same family okay so um this was the same it was done in all through the scriptures the same baptism as they spread the gospel up until the Catholic Church changed it and went to the trinitarian baptism in the year 325 for those of you that aren't aware of that so the baptism remained pure and simple in the name of Jesus Christ for just over 300 years and for these asked you know for these 1700 years the prevailing teaching has been precisely the red letter words of Jesus in the name of the Father and Son Holy Ghost but it's one name What's that name but they just smooth it over and we got this mess we have today but God rich and mercy sent a prophet to our age and showed it focused on the truth you see so Paul stayed there over two years he was Pastor in verse 10 so that all heard and uh I would suggest that as soon as you can go back to your church age book we have an English and Spanish and read chapter three carefully very carefully the Church of Ephesus so brother Brandon speaking about that he says here their persecutions back then and trials and patients were over the Blessed name of Jesus it wasn't you know when we when we Face the Lord we're not going to get a gold star because we had a broken fingernail nothing like that their whole problem was over the name of Jesus he says you know that is not at all strange for it is the word and the name that brings the enemy pouring after us like a flood that Mighty word which was manifested in healing signs and wonders and other demonstrations caused the Pharisees to um scream out for the death of the True Believers and now that name hated and despised by the Jews is mocked by the culture who are the cultured people that's the important the arrogant people see as they laugh to think that anyone could be so foolish as to believe in a man that died and rose again and now in heaven so here were the religious persecutors the Jews cursing this Jesus and whom to them was a false Messiah and here was others laughing with delight and mocking sarcastically at the name of a new God who to them wasn't a god at all now here's something else that started in that agent will continue right down Through the Ages even today getting deeper and darker that is people were repudiating that name that means refuse to recognize to reject it was not the true Ephesian church that was doing it no sir it was the false Apostles we got false Apostles amongst us carrying spoken word books saying great things but they're false so you gotta have discernment to know what's going on you see so the Ephesians knew that name and they loved it okay so in another place brother Brandon says uh this great servant Moses now as Moses went with the Judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is Jesus Christ if those Egyptians could have ever got that little simple stick out of Moses hands they would have had him whipped and when the devil can ever get the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ he's got the church with yeah and they're doing it in churches today you see there's strong forces here in the 21st century anointed doing their best to remove the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ and put it over here in this man and this man whatever and there's no power that's right there's failure you see so um they're following personalities and not the god of the Bible so it's still tonight about the name of Jesus Christ and that's of course a sermon for another day but um verse one I'll say verse 11 of chapter 19. we have here it says and God brought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so he was very Anointed God was with him you know verse 12 so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs and aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them now I've been to Rome many times first time we went you know we're just tourists looking around and they took us to where Paul's grave was and it's the stone isn't a nice you know pretty soon it's broken and so I asked him how come it's broken which I should have known better but you know I was young like you used to be and um it says on there Apostle Paul martyr and so the lady explained well you see said for years people have come here and they have a string and a piece of cloth and a rock and they tie it together and they'd when it hits they take it out and go and pray over people so right here the you know the Hankins were taken from his body well they were still doing that years later and in the year 2000 the pope said we're going to lift this sarcophagus out of the ground we're going to put it up everybody can see it so you can go now to the church there and see it right up close but anyway um in 13-20 we have What's called the Vagabond Jews these are freelance they were just doing things their way they're not Orthodox and there was a man named Siva and he was a chief priest among the Jews and he knew his prophet's words very well well he could quote it you know and so he had seven sons and they were into exercising evil spirits you know removing Spirits casting out demons and they heard about the success of Paul in verse 11 of you know we just read special miracles and they thought hey we should try that so they found a man with um with the evil spirit actually he was insane and in verse 13 we adjure you in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches wait a minute they were not Witnesses like Paul they were what we call English wannabes they wish they could be like Paul you know so look at verse 15. it says here and uh and the evil spirit answered out of this whole this guy Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you guys where'd you come from and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on these guys and overcame all seven of them and prevailed against them so that they had to run out of the house naked and wounded evil spirits had nothing to mess with if you don't know where you're standing leave it alone but in all that confusion verse 17 this was known called the Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus and fear fell on them in the name of Jesus was magnified and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds so this this little encounter here with this crazy man and how what it did to these seven sons of the priest hey they all took notice and they said hey we better come clean too it might happen to us tomorrow so they brought all their their evil stuff which was you know like their black magic and their their all their stuff that wasn't of God they've brought it together and um many of them also used curious Arts that's what we call from the Dark Side of the occult and brought their books together and burned them right there in the street and they counted the price of them 50 000 pieces of silver okay now this is this is important that these details are here you see such was the conviction that Christ is real you know in his word and so The Magicians brought their stuff and they had a book burning and it's the only way to get rid of evil spirits you can't put it in the corner you can't sell it at the yard sale you got to burn it it's the way it happens you see and so they had a great Revival they were serious about following uh the way of Christ it's not optional uh it's not popular but they were convicted because the Holy Ghost preacher preached the truth let's see and so the value of the books equivalent to 50 000 days wages for one man or about the equivalent of 10 men's wages for 14 years that's a lot of stuff but once they thought was valuable in a way of life was now trashing the fire that sound like the tape uh what is it um the token get all the trash out and burn it yeah and um anything contrary to Jesus Christ went in the fire they were serious they applied the token so Satan was on the scene but look at verse 20. so publicly so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed so with all this Burning verse 23 and the time at the same time there Rose no small stir about that way Well yeah if you if you burn all this stuff somebody's going to be upset mainly Satan you know and so um they call themselves of the way from I'm the way the truth and the life and that that word kind of stuck with them so then as usual you know there was the twin every meeting has three kinds of Believers and it's powerful as things were the twin was always there contradicting you see and so there was a Revival and the people you know they turned from idol worship and turned away from their favorite personalities or being baptized they were following the way but the ones making the idols the ones writing those books and all that they got upset we're going to starve you know and so Demetrius was a silversmith in Ephesus and craft the elaborate shrines for the Temple of Diana that's the Roman name our Artemis was the Greek name so they had a union meeting of the the guys that worked in this business verse 25 says here whom uh he called together the Workman of the like occupation and um said now sirs you know that by this craft we have our wealth moreover you see and hear that not alone in nephesus but all over Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away people saying that there be no Gods which are made with hands which is nothing but the truth you know so that not only is our craft in danger and to become you know worthless but also that the Temple of the Great Goddess Diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all Asia and the world worshiped so they were convinced that everybody was worshiped by Diana and here's one preacher preaching against it and the whole thing's going to come to zero so they're worried you know so they had a meeting and they all got you can read it all for yourself they got all excited and started screaming and hollering but the blessings of God were with the Saints you know and uh so in verse 32 it says here um and some therefore cried one thing and another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherever they were even come together sounds like America the riots we had recently then you know why they're there they paid him twenty dollars in a bus ticket they go down there and make a scene so they had the same thing going on back there you know so in verse 30 and 31 Paul wanted to go in and help he wanted to set things straight but his friends and companions stopped him no it's too dangerous now so it was a well-calculated Ruckus what it was and It produced organized confusion but their attention was focused on Alexander in verse 34 when they knew that he was a Jew all with one voice in the space of two hours cried out great as Diana of the Ephesians they were screaming and hollering you know so it's not so different from from what's going on you know in our world so we have a religious riot in emphasis because of the way and what it produced what's that It produced God fearing Christians they weren't doing the burning they were trying to live right they're willing to take a stand for the truth no matter what the relatives thought or what they believed and these were our brothers and sisters this isn't something you know the same line right till tonight you see and they were the present-day fulfillment of Hebrews 13 8. so back in 1950 brother Brandon said Behold the Lamb of God get ready wake up lift up your heads Redemption is drawing nigh get ready signs and wonders appearing critics infidels waxing worse and worse so that was a long time ago in 1950 they were already showing up it didn't just happen this last five years you see he says we've got to put up with them but we're not looking to them we're looking to God you've got to focus on the word John 8 32 you shall know the truth how are you going to know the truth because you have a Bible on the on the on the nightstand no you got to get into it you know Sister Jerry makes pretty good pies pretty much almost five star a lot of times but she had to read she had to learn that whatever you do you had to learn it and so you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free what's the alternative stay in prison stay ignorant you know you've got to get into the word and and learn what it says so the believer is secure and they're fortified by the word of God and he knows what first John 4 4 says greater is he that's in you that's right than he that's in the world we don't fear what's going on in the world we know where we stand and Jesus prayed for you and I yeah look over John 17. Jesus is praying and this is before he ever went to the cross and it says here in verse 20 of 17. it says here neither pray I for these alone these guys right here but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word amen that they all may be one as thou father art in me I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me so that's what we're studying the testimony of these guys that were there it's scripture it's real and that's why we believe okay so you were in the thoughts of Jesus Christ long before he went to the cross and he loves you so much that he died for you you were on his mind see so this crisis that they had there it came to came to nothing the mayor of the city said hey going home so we get into verse 20 of verse 1 of chapter 20 and we're not going to be long is it still light outside or free parking so it's okay brother Paul said I could go to a midnight wanted but you're probably alone so verse 1 of chapter 20 and after the Uproar was deceased so they had a big big Riot about all this stuff the big fire and everything after that was done Paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for it to go to Macedonia okay so after the riot he has a meeting they prayed so the text goes on to mention several of his faithful traveling companions seven helpers of significance verse six they sailed for five days to cover 200 miles now we can't quite comprehend that you know how far is it to Seattle 600 miles yeah I flew the other night 57 minutes from here we can't understand this five days but they were in a boat and the boat had to be the wind had to blow and so forth so sometimes they could even row it but they were patient people they didn't have another choice we live in a world of many choices you know when you bring it up on your phone you can walk you take the bus you can take you know whatever and um so we have many choice of restaurants and everything and but even today down in Brazil from from the city of manaus out to the ocean it's um it's 1200 miles and in a diesel barge this takes six days just don't go that far so not everybody lives like we do you know so anyway they're with the Believers in troas for seven days troaz is in Turkey it was a Roman Seaport and the working people gathered together to um to spend the evening with Paul and learn more about the faith they were following the pattern established in the beginning coming together around the apostles teaching for Fellowship for daily breaking of bread chapter two and brother random said that they partook of communion on each occasion because the scripture says do this in remembrance of me as often as you do this remember my death there's nothing in your Bible about remember my birth and all these presence and all this stuff no remember my death you see so verse 7 of chapter 20 it says and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the next day and continued his speech until midnight yeah they had long church he had a lot to say they were listening you know and so we knew we noticed throughout our study that Paul and his associates always made a point of going to church with the Jews on the Sabbath in their synagogues and these were the early missionaries that took the gospel whenever and wherever there was somebody to listen even down at the river in chapter 16 and Lydia and so forth and here for the first time is mentioned that they came to break bread on the first day of the week we just take all this for granted let's see here we're in chapter 20 the first time they even mentioned that so two points the early church were specifically worn against submitting themselves to the bondage of any legalistic observant of Sabbath days you see so these early churches voluntarily chose the first day of the week as an appropriate time for Fellowship of worship and remembrance of the day that our Lord arose okay and it's a you know in the four Gospels so new day new people new creation and the observance of the first day of the week also many of the early writings even to irenius and the second Church age so here's Paul having a communion service with the Saints in troas and he's leaving the next day okay so he's preaching very very long and he had a lot to tell them still preaching at midnight verse 8 has some details and there are many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together now why is that important because they didn't have lights like these they had fire burning many many torches they're in upstairs heat goes up so it's you know how it is when see that's why we have air conditioning then used to have air conditioning right brother Paul yeah years ago just open the windows we can't open these windows and so we have air conditioning so nobody go to sleep but if somebody gets tired I have a magic way of keeping you awake so don't even think about it so they're in their separate chamber it's warm and the next verse says and they were sat in the window a certain young man named euticus and he fell asleep and as Paul was long preaching he sang down with sleep and he fell out of the third window and they thought he was dead sounds bad but that's what happened you know and so um he's having this this service in verse 10 and Paul went down fell on him embraced him trouble not yourselves hey he's alive and when he therefore was come up again to the for the meeting they broke bread ate talked a long while even until the break of Dave and he Departed so all night church I had communion he left all these little details are in your Bible you know I'm just so thankful that we have brother Luke back there writing all this stuff's not downhill so now he's on his way to Jerusalem he's headed to Jerusalem for the Feast of Pentecost which is 50 days after the resurrection chapter 2 of Acts and um it seems like they were in a hurry from everything we can read here so they stopped at a place called militas um and he sent a messenger because see they're they're in the they're in the water they're in the Mediterranean and they come to the little Port so he sent some Messengers up to miletus to call the Elders of the Church of emphasis they came down to the port to see him and verse 18. let's see what we have here 18. and when they were come to him he said to them you know from the first day that I came unto Asia after what Manner I have been with you at all seasons serving the Lord with all humility of mine with many tears and temptations which befill Me by lying in weight by the of the Jews and now I kept dot back anything from you everything profitable I told you and so he preaches to him a while and um it's a basically a farewell speech to the church leaders he felt compelled to go to Jerusalem and the Saints at every stop said don't go they're going to hurt you but look at verse uh look at verse 25 for example and now behold I know that you all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more that's a sad announcement this is their father in The Gospel this is the man of the hour you're not going to see me no more I'm going you know look at 27 for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God everything God told me I've told you 28. take heed therefore unto yourselves and to the flock so he's he's talking to the ministers there at that place take heed uh all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing Grievous hungry wolves are going to come in and spare nobody also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw disciples after themselves that's called control I want it my way care what you think that was going on clear back there therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn every man night and day with tears and um he goes on speaking to him down in verse 38 Sorrowing most of all says here and they they all wept and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him souring most of all like his words that he spoke that they should see his face no more and they accompany him onto the ship so they helped him onto the ship and he went on their their father in The Gospel he's leaving you know it's sad day and so he was the messenger from God and they actually never saw him again they received a last letter written from the prisoner in Rome the epistle to the Ephesians so that's the end of chapter 20. and um uh we're gonna be here again tomorrow we're going to finish the book yeah because you got plenty to chew on for tonight some of you is paying attention others were so may God bless you it's been a pleasure being with you and we'll continue what time tomorrow 10 30. yeah don't be late we pray that brother Jose can make it so come on brother Paul thank you for your attention [Applause] all things work together our brother George and um you know it just even lovely to set and have Conversation Over the book amen just to to be able to just talk and see and and you know the word has been revealed amen we're not going out to try and find it again it's been given to us it's here but sometimes we need to have our understanding stimulated to be able to look and realize and when you think about this I I want to you know brother George said a couple words that really struck me a price a precise record was recorded and my brother and sister there's been a precise record recorded in this day and I want you to just think about the record that is being written about this bride of Christ in this hour right now everything that God has said the word says He will do and I'm telling you I can look in my Bible and I can look in my life and I'm seeing it happen amen it's not me doing it it's not you doing it it's Christ in you doing it the word is alive amen and we are sitting here today and if we are paying attention we can literally see it unfold in front of us it is happening now the critic I want you to just think about this I'm not not trying to preach here but just a little excited for a moment I want you to think about this in the world today what do they do our government is doing what it wants to do what it's anointed to do and they always have a distraction but this just struck me brother George is saying now you guys Focus come on let's focus so what happens is Satan has a distraction but God has his own way of catching our attention he's drawing us to the word and the world is being drawn to wars and rumors of wars and economic crisis and pandemics and moral decays and and the bride is caught to the word she's being called to the word all she hears is a voice saying come up higher come to the word amen I thank God that the word is what has caught our attention amen not personality amen not size not how great the building is but the word has become everything to you and I amen what is it the word says that we are the final voice amen my brother and sister if we're the final voice what are we saying what are we saying if our voice literally became the absolute final voice Lord what is our voice saying I want my voice to say my God is an awesome God I want my voice to be lifted up to say the word is coming to pass in me I want the my voice to be able to say I believe every word of my Bible and I believe that the word said that I would rise above the laodicea and I will be a conqueror and I will walk with him and I have been called to be a representation of my husband oh my brother and sister I know many years ago in Chile when when I went down there the first times and and uh preaching and traveling and then the next year we just felt led of God to take sister Jerry with us and and we remember this with humor in our house and and uh brothers and sisters come and they said Oh Brother Paul we've met sister Jerry yes my lovely wife hmm now we know who you are come on we are the Bride of Jesus Christ let the world know who our Lord and savior is let them look at the bride and be able to say now we know who he is amen hallelujah hallelujah I had to cheat I think brother George called me out there when he caught my attention because I was looking up a quote and uh anyway maybe I was the one not paying attention and I want you all to know that when when he got took me to the theater I have repented from that but it is good you get to see really very clearly Paul did not live an easy life he led a life that a still Small Voice directed him and he obeyed amen amen I really want to preach that's a problem with preachers but the prophet of God says several times in various ways and I won't go ahead and quote them but he's talking about if God's put out another branch in this day it will be another book of Acts and my brother and sister the branch has come forth it is producing amen there is a Bride come out of this word we know the prophet's message is true because it's producing exactly what it said it would produce amen we don't have to change it to another idea we don't have to modify it for the culture for the age for the time but we can stand on the word of God and realize the book is not just being eaten the book is producing I say thank you Lord let's give the Lord a little hand clap of praise Hallelujah Hallelujah the word is producing that book of Acts again amen let's just stand amen enlisting the song Here Sister Sarah if you'd come please musicians when I think of the goodness of Jesus I had all kinds of little notes here you know part of that precise record that's recorded is a record that showed your name on a Lamb's Book amen and then we come forward in time and it shows where Satan tried to derail us distract us turn our attention away and we ended up in dancehalls and bar rooms and we ended up caught up in money and we got caught up in this and we were caught up in ourself and the record shows that at the calling of the word [Music] something said wait I know that voice [Music] I know that voice
