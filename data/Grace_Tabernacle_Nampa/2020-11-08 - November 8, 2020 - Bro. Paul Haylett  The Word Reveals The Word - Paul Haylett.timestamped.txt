[23:22] bride amen brother chris if you'd come
[23:24] [Music]
[23:29] amen asking you shall receive all things
[23:32] are possible
[23:33] let's buy our heads
[23:37] heavenly father lord we're so thankful
[23:39] father that
[23:40] we have you to come to the lord
[23:43] father yet the great paradox is that
[23:46] you first drew us to you lord
[23:50] father before we even knew we needed a
[23:52] god lord you had hand selected each one
[23:54] of us
[23:54] father and had picked out where we would
[23:57] live
[23:58] what age we would live in lord jesus so
[24:01] lord we come to you knowing that you
[24:03] were
[24:03] the all-knowing god and our father
[24:06] our friend our bridegroom
[24:10] lord and we asking you to come down and
[24:13] meet these needs and these requests this
[24:15] morning
[24:16] lord the list is long and i'm not going
[24:19] to try to remember
[24:20] a father but you know lord jesus father
[24:23] the different needs those that were that
[24:25] were voiced
[24:26] this morning before we even voiced them
[24:28] father you knew what they were
[24:30] yet because you're our father you love
[24:32] to hear us ask
[24:33] so lord we ask for these things lord
[24:36] my brother and manasseh and and lord
[24:39] sister
[24:41] sue's co-worker with the coveted lord
[24:44] and
[24:45] and father the different ones lord jesus
[24:48] father we ask that you just come down
[24:50] and touch them
[24:51] touch the needs lord jesus your divine
[24:53] will be done in each and every situation
[24:55] we ask lord
[24:56] we pray for the service this morning
[24:58] that you would speak to our hearts that
[24:59] you'd move
[25:00] a passer aside lord father bless the
[25:03] remainder of the song service as well
[25:05] lord the tithes and the offerings may
[25:06] you bless the giver
[25:08] bless the receiver we pray may all
[25:09] things be done to the glory of god
[25:12] we love you lord and thank you in jesus
[25:13] christ then we pray
[25:15] amen have your seeds
[25:23] just an announcement concerning the
[25:26] youth
[25:28] on here
[25:37] we're so happy to be here with you all
[25:41] and uh
[25:42] thankful that the lord has given us the
[25:45] opportunity to work with the youth here
[25:48] and um always praying always seeking the
[25:51] lord's will when it comes to the young
[25:53] people so just have this enough the
[25:56] scripture in galatians 6
[25:58] 9-10 says let us not be weary in
[26:01] well-doing for in due season
[26:03] we shall reap if we faint not as we have
[26:06] therefore
[26:06] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[26:09] especially unto them who are of the
[26:11] household of faith
[26:13] so everything that we do we do to the
[26:16] glory of god
[26:18] and this is the harvest of our youth
[26:22] it is a pivotal time in their lives and
[26:25] our calling as youth leaders and parents
[26:27] is to prepare the ground for what god
[26:30] is going to do and um
[26:34] and that he's already doing and if that
[26:37] is the case we want to cultivate a place
[26:39] that is the best atmosphere that we can
[26:41] possibly do
[26:43] we do our very best and we leave the
[26:46] rest up to god
[26:48] um he requires that we do our part too
[26:52] and so sometimes uh loving someone
[26:56] means having to make hard decisions with
[26:59] your children
[27:00] boundaries have to be drawn which may
[27:02] hurt them
[27:03] but ultimately it's the best thing for
[27:05] them
[27:06] makes them feel secure and creates the
[27:09] right atmosphere
[27:10] so believing in our hearts that god has
[27:12] called us to be youth leaders
[27:15] even as a young man i knew that that was
[27:17] a calling that god placed in my life
[27:19] as a teenager i started the bible
[27:21] studies for the youth and the church i
[27:22] grew up in
[27:23] and that's always been on my heart
[27:25] something that god has raised me to do
[27:27] and i
[27:28] believe that and i believe it's okay to
[27:29] have confidence in that
[27:31] not to lift myself up at all but um
[27:35] because of that and having put our
[27:36] prayer into this group here
[27:38] we have made the decision to put an age
[27:40] restriction
[27:41] on the youth group i've spoken to our
[27:43] pastors i believe he is the
[27:45] head of the church and he is in
[27:47] agreement with
[27:48] me this morning we've seen the benefits
[27:51] of such
[27:52] and know that it is the right thing to
[27:54] do and so
[27:55] i know this will be difficult for some
[27:56] of you and we we understand that
[27:59] um we wish we could include everyone
[28:02] every single time
[28:04] we pray that you'll understand why this
[28:06] is the best decision for our youth as
[28:07] well
[28:08] the age restriction will be 10 years up
[28:11] to
[28:11] 30 for now so 10 years old and up are
[28:15] welcome to come
[28:16] to youth meeting attendance is allowed
[28:18] by anyone
[28:19] in that age gap who has never been
[28:21] married
[28:23] it goes without saying but sometimes you
[28:25] still have to voice that
[28:26] so we would also graciously ask that
[28:29] parents continue to drop your kid off
[28:30] and return to pick them up
[28:32] at the conclusion of the youth meeting
[28:34] so just the youth leaders there
[28:37] thank you all for understanding you have
[28:40] been a pleasure to
[28:41] to work with the parents of our youth
[28:44] and please continue to pray for a
[28:46] bountiful harvest
[28:47] from the youth of grace tabernacle we're
[28:50] doing everything that we can in our
[28:51] ability and
[28:52] in prayer seeking the lord's will that
[28:54] he would touch these
[28:55] young men and women and raise them up to
[28:58] take over
[29:00] the positions that will come available
[29:02] if the lord should tarry
[29:04] so with that youth meeting is this
[29:06] friday november 13th
[29:09] bring one question you have any question
[29:11] no question is
[29:12] too small no question is too great um
[29:15] and with with that we're our goal is to
[29:18] have
[29:18] youth being the first friday of every
[29:20] month and we've kind of said that to a
[29:22] few of you but
[29:23] that is the official um program
[29:27] we missed the last two and i would like
[29:30] to apologize
[29:31] to the youth for that we had a baby and
[29:33] then we had covid
[29:35] and so i take youth meeting very serious
[29:39] i think that is very very important and
[29:41] so
[29:42] when we miss one that means i failed you
[29:45] so i take that
[29:46] very seriously and so we will don't
[29:48] worry about it we'll continue to keep
[29:50] things moving along
[29:51] and um we'll have youth meeting this
[29:53] friday
[29:55] the 13th and therefore after that the
[29:58] first friday of every month unless
[29:59] meteorite strikes the earth but i
[30:03] i do love each one of you very much and
[30:06] the youth and the parents and um we
[30:09] wouldn't be here without you guys
[30:11] and so we thank you very much lord bless
[30:13] you amen
[30:16] thank you brother chris we do we always
[30:19] want to
[30:20] keep our young people in prayer amen and
[30:22] we
[30:23] have an opportunity to to speak to them
[30:27] one-on-one
[30:28] amen sometimes it's uh it's easier that
[30:31] way
[30:32] sometimes when our parents are sticking
[30:33] around kids don't get a chance to open
[30:35] up
[30:36] really what's deep in their heart and
[30:37] what the lord has been dealing with them
[30:38] with
[30:39] so this is this is an avenue for them
[30:41] and we we thank the lord for that thank
[30:43] you lord for chris
[30:44] and taking taking the helm and i know
[30:47] brother ivan and i we tried our best
[30:50] i was like i'm not a speaker i'm an
[30:52] organizer
[30:53] but we thank the lord that chris has
[30:55] taken this
[30:56] upon his shoulder and we'll continue to
[30:58] pray for you brother chris
[30:59] as you would teach and lead our young
[31:02] people
[31:02] outside of the home amen as we get ready
[31:05] to

[34:14] morning lord my heart is open to you
[34:18] i just want to receive from you lord
[34:20] speak to me today lord
[34:22] be our hearts desire amen hallelujah
[34:27] we just want to remember tonight
[34:29] communion foot washing at 5 pm
[34:32] amen uh also we didn't put it on the
[34:35] prayer request i intended to brother
[34:37] isaac
[34:39] probably would be embarrassed for me to
[34:41] bring this out but brother isaac
[34:43] had changed jobs some time back and uh
[34:46] just uh
[34:48] the company went to work for had just
[34:49] unrealistic expectations
[34:51] i believe it was an answer to prayer
[34:53] that god had
[34:55] um his old job made an offer to him
[34:58] of employment again they they really
[35:00] loved him there and so
[35:02] uh they are taking a few days off they
[35:05] went camping of all the weekends to pick
[35:07] to go camping
[35:10] but um anyway we want to remember them
[35:12] that
[35:13] you know the roads won't be too slick
[35:14] too muddy to whatever
[35:16] and god would just grant brother isaac i
[35:19] i think he's done well to hide it but he
[35:21] has been
[35:22] incredibly stressed out and so we just
[35:25] want to remember them
[35:27] this is just my own little personal

[40:08] well if we would just stand and we'll go
[40:10] to the word today i would just like to
[40:12] once again saints you know sometimes you
[40:15] just never know
[40:16] kind of where it leads but we're still
[40:18] on track
[40:20] of our little graph that we laid out
[40:23] but you know the lord just laid upon my
[40:26] heart
[40:27] back several weeks ago to mostly focus
[40:30] on the sold out
[40:32] uh we look at this and then we look at
[40:34] this what the prophet of god said he
[40:35] said there'd be that three kinds of
[40:37] believers
[40:38] and and you look at that and there's no
[40:40] real need to focus
[40:42] tremendous time as it were on the make
[40:45] believer
[40:46] there's no need to focus a lot of time
[40:49] on the unbeliever
[40:50] because we are a gathering house if you
[40:53] would put it that way
[40:55] of believers amen we have come here
[40:58] because
[40:58] the word of god is what stirs our heart
[41:02] you might use the word controls us but
[41:05] some people you know
[41:07] they have a little trouble with what you
[41:08] say and what they hear and
[41:10] you know i just want you to say my
[41:11] brother and sister i just want to say to
[41:13] you
[41:13] the the holy ghost doesn't control you
[41:20] it isn't as a dictator
[41:23] it does not control you god granted to
[41:27] us free moral agency just to decide do i
[41:29] go right or left or straight or whatever
[41:31] and
[41:32] what the holy ghost does is anoints
[41:34] those sons and daughters of god
[41:36] that they say lord thy will be done
[41:40] if you want me to stop lord i will stop
[41:42] you want me to speak i'll speak you want
[41:44] me to go right or left i'll just
[41:46] i want to just do what you want lord
[41:48] there is the difference my brother and
[41:50] sister many believe and
[41:51] and uh and i don't mean to go in that
[41:54] direction but i've got friends that
[41:56] felt uh you know one of them used the
[41:58] words said i was so oppressed when i
[42:00] was in the message it's interesting
[42:04] because you see i feel liberated
[42:07] i do not feel oppressed and so we want
[42:11] to
[42:11] look at this and as we move forward i i
[42:15] just felt real
[42:16] led just we'll get to those other topics
[42:18] and touch on them but we're not going to
[42:20] spend a lot of time
[42:21] uh because i believe really what it is
[42:24] my brother and sister
[42:25] uh while we are feeding on the body word
[42:28] of jesus christ amen we don't want to
[42:31] look over
[42:32] and spend any time at all judging those
[42:35] that are eating
[42:36] on some old dead rotten carcass that's
[42:38] not our job our job is to eat the word
[42:41] and then to let the word come through us
[42:43] and manifest the very life of the word
[42:46] and so you know i have spoken some very
[42:49] direct things in the last uh
[42:51] month or two uh in my studies
[42:54] these last few days i come across a
[42:56] quote that i had not read before
[42:58] and i thought i'm going to share that
[43:00] and then something spoke to me and said
[43:01] it's time to move on
[43:03] it's time to move on we're not here to
[43:05] beat the horse
[43:06] we're not here to do that we're here by
[43:09] god's grace to lay the word out and
[43:12] for us to take and partake of that word
[43:15] and build
[43:16] strength to move on for another day amen
[43:19] so i want to speak to you this morning
[43:22] on
[43:22] the word reveals the word
[43:26] amen hallelujah let's go to john 1
[43:29] and we'll just start in on our scripture
[43:32] our thought for the day
[43:34] amen by god's grace we can move forward
[43:36] on that
[43:38] in the beginning was the word
[43:42] so if man ever could go back far enough
[43:48] if his carbon dating in his historical
[43:51] understanding
[43:53] scientific research could take him back
[43:56] far enough
[43:58] what would he run into the word
[44:04] you know we can have a brontosaurus
[44:06] tooth and a dinosaurus this
[44:08] and a dinosaurus that and the
[44:09] saber-toothed tiger and
[44:11] the ancient whatever man they found in a
[44:13] block of ice with a wound in him
[44:16] and all they can go back to all these
[44:17] things and say there had to be prior
[44:18] civilization well the word doesn't say
[44:20] there wasn't
[44:24] but the word says that in the very
[44:26] beginning of all of this
[44:29] was the word and the word was with god
[44:32] and
[44:32] the word was god the same was in the
[44:35] beginning with
[44:36] god and all things were made by him and
[44:38] without him was not anything made that
[44:40] was made
[44:41] in him was life now and you know i want
[44:44] to interject this right here
[44:46] without him was not anything made that
[44:48] was made did you know that
[44:50] all of this incredible stuff we have
[44:52] that we call technology
[44:56] i hope you see the humor of this god was
[44:58] the original programmer
[45:00] amen the ipad air pad
[45:05] apple whatever 10 12 40 whatever they
[45:08] might be on right now
[45:09] that was god god knew all of that
[45:12] amen because you see i just happen to
[45:16] believe the prophet when he said all
[45:18] they did is break into god's laboratory
[45:21] well hallelujah we got all these
[45:23] geniuses and they've become
[45:25] billionaires on these great ideas but
[45:28] literally what they were
[45:29] now don't misunderstand me i believe
[45:31] everything and the time of the season
[45:32] but what it was is they were just
[45:34] anointed the door to the laboratory was
[45:36] open they got in
[45:38] they were the one that grasped
[45:42] they brought it out and they presented
[45:43] it to mankind and it made them rich
[45:46] and i'll move off that topic because
[45:50] if we're not careful we'll all be
[45:52] wearing earrings
[45:54] and whatever else because they'll want
[45:55] to put every kind of device they can in
[45:58] you and
[45:58] on you to track you to keep track of you
[46:01] and you won't be able to speak or think
[46:02] without them understanding that see
[46:04] that's what the devil wants
[46:06] because the devil unless you voice it
[46:08] doesn't know
[46:09] what's in your heart and the devil still
[46:13] trying to figure out what's in the mind
[46:15] of
[46:16] people amen now this will sound a little
[46:20] political and forgive me
[46:21] but you see our government and the
[46:23] governments of the world is still trying
[46:25] to figure out and working on it making
[46:27] progress
[46:28] of who will submit to them
[46:31] and who won't now because the devil's
[46:34] behind this you'll understand the devil
[46:36] we'll just cut it right down to the thin
[46:38] here the devil still trying to figure
[46:41] out who's going
[46:42] to submit to him and who won't
[46:45] well praise the lord i want to be like
[46:47] that blind man that set in church and
[46:48] every once in a while he just shout
[46:50] hallelujah
[46:52] and one day somebody said why do you do
[46:55] that
[46:56] he said well there's god and the devil
[46:59] and i just want them to know whose side
[47:01] i'm on
[47:03] yeah hallelujah
[47:06] in him was life and the life was the
[47:09] light of men
[47:10] and light shineth in darkness and
[47:11] darkness comprehended it not
[47:14] now i want you to understand what that
[47:16] is my brother and sister in him was life
[47:18] and his life was the light of men
[47:20] so there is predestination right here in
[47:23] this scripture
[47:24] because the light is shining and some
[47:28] look at the light and say oh my lord
[47:31] help me forgive me and they start to
[47:34] walk in that light
[47:35] but others complete darkness the light
[47:37] can shine all at once
[47:39] they can't comprehend it there was a man
[47:41] sent from god whose name was john and
[47:43] the same came for a witness to bear
[47:44] witness of the light
[47:46] that all men through him might believe
[47:48] he was not that light
[47:49] but was sent to bear witness of that
[47:52] light
[47:53] that was the true light which lighteth
[47:57] every man that cometh into the world
[48:02] every man amen the absolute murdering
[48:06] pillaging there is no god the light was
[48:10] there
[48:13] he was in the world when the world was
[48:14] made by him and the world knew him not
[48:16] he came into his own and his own
[48:18] received him not
[48:19] but as many as received him to them gave
[48:23] he power to become
[48:24] the sons of god even to them that
[48:27] believe on his name
[48:28] which were born not of blood nor of the
[48:30] will of the flesh
[48:32] nor the will of man but of god
[48:36] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[48:39] among us
[48:40] and we beheld his glory in the glory as
[48:42] of the only begotten of the father full
[48:44] of grace
[48:45] and truth heavenly father we thank you
[48:48] today for this opportunity to come and
[48:50] worship
[48:51] i ask lord that you just come and stir
[48:53] each and every heart father for the
[48:54] needs that they have
[48:56] lord you know that we try not to look so
[48:58] closely father to try and figure out
[49:00] the ups and downs and the ins and outs
[49:02] of every believer
[49:04] but father we would ask you to come lord
[49:06] for it's your holy spirit that searches
[49:08] the reigns of the heart of man and
[49:11] lord we ask you to come and search
[49:12] through us all today father
[49:14] lord that we might just be able to
[49:16] submit to yield lord and receive from
[49:19] you
[49:19] in the precious name of jesus christ we
[49:21] pray amen
[49:23] you may be seated
[49:33] as we would look at this thought my
[49:35] brother and sister
[49:36] it is actually quite an extensive
[49:38] thought and
[49:39] i have to admit that i struggled just a
[49:42] little bit
[49:43] because when you have such a wealth of
[49:46] information to draw from
[49:48] sometimes it's very easy to try to pull
[49:51] it all in
[49:52] but we know that in the human element
[49:54] that there is just a certain limitation
[49:56] by which we can uh
[49:58] uh remember or affect in our life
[50:02] and so sometimes we go on information
[50:05] overload and
[50:06] somewhere along the line those of us
[50:07] that maybe have more of a limited time
[50:09] memory uh or our approach to memory
[50:13] is a little different um we would we
[50:16] would just have to start you know
[50:17] shedding things because we cannot
[50:19] handle it but we look at this and
[50:21] realize as the word of god has come in
[50:23] our hour
[50:24] how the some of these passages of
[50:26] scripture that we have read for so long
[50:29] uh as time goes on they take on a
[50:32] greater meaning i wouldn't say a new
[50:34] meaning right we're not looking for a
[50:35] new message
[50:36] but did they take on a greater meaning
[50:39] and
[50:40] as we'll look at this and realize how
[50:42] that
[50:43] in the beginning was the word and the
[50:44] word was with god and the word was god
[50:47] and it says the word was made flesh and
[50:49] dwelt among us
[50:50] now my brother and sister when we look
[50:52] at that we realize that
[50:54] god was empowered in jesus christ he
[50:57] he come right down and he he filled him
[51:00] up
[51:00] with all it wasn't any one stroke of
[51:03] man or of theology but it was all god
[51:07] and
[51:07] his response to the word was always that
[51:10] the word
[51:11] uh was what was in charge as it were
[51:13] because that is god
[51:15] and so you know when jesus himself as a
[51:17] flesh man
[51:18] he faced many challenges and even to the
[51:21] degree my brother and sister i want you
[51:23] to understand this relationship that
[51:25] there
[51:25] is even to the degree that he come and
[51:28] said my god
[51:29] my god why hast thou forsaken me
[51:33] that was the flesh speaking and so if we
[51:36] look and get a clear vision of what
[51:39] uh god uh did when he created us and uh
[51:42] brought jesus christ in the very image
[51:44] of man
[51:45] that we would come to a place that if we
[51:48] can come
[51:49] or i wouldn't say if we can that would
[51:51] be a dividing line
[51:53] but when we become i'm talking to
[51:55] believers this morning when we become
[51:57] completely filled with the word amen
[52:01] we're not looking for a partial filling
[52:02] or a partial anointing
[52:04] we're looking to be completely filled
[52:06] with the word
[52:08] now i don't know about you let's be
[52:09] honest with one another there's times
[52:11] that we feel like we've really made
[52:12] progress
[52:13] and then something of this flesh rises
[52:16] up and realizes god's still working on
[52:18] me
[52:18] amen but the grace of god comes and
[52:21] shows us clearly
[52:22] that we were as it were that chip or
[52:25] that slice off of him
[52:27] and so every bit of our being is just as
[52:30] much
[52:31] jesus christ this is a prophet amen just
[52:34] as much of jesus christ just as much
[52:36] as um that piece of rock was off of the
[52:39] statue of moses
[52:41] and so in that we know that even in our
[52:43] time of fault our time of struggle
[52:45] that uh god is looking at us and um
[52:48] looking at us in such a way i should
[52:50] have i don't believe i did
[52:52] include it and i wish i would have maybe
[52:54] now uh but brother branham talking about
[52:57] how god was up there on the mountain
[52:59] he wasn't looking down to see our faults
[53:02] amen he was looking down to see
[53:05] us through his own eyes oh my
[53:09] very simple thought but incredible amen
[53:12] amen now if we could look through god's
[53:15] eyes we'd realize that
[53:16] we're flawless yes sir amen
[53:21] now you can go ahead and let your flesh
[53:22] speak this morning how many feel
[53:24] flawless
[53:27] no see we can't look through our eyes
[53:29] we've got to look through his eyes
[53:31] and when we look through his eyes we see
[53:33] who we really are
[53:35] amen and so in that my brother and
[53:38] sister we
[53:38] realize that the light that lighteth
[53:40] every man that cometh into the world
[53:42] as he was in the world the world was
[53:44] made by him the world knew him not
[53:46] but he came into his own now this is
[53:48] speaking unto the jews
[53:50] right not speaking to the bride of
[53:52] christ
[53:53] and as many as received him look we've
[53:57] been given the power my brother and
[53:58] sister
[53:59] now when we have opportunity
[54:02] i would liken this maybe into the realm
[54:05] of building something
[54:07] if i could just give this little example
[54:09] or analogy
[54:11] but as many as received him to them gave
[54:15] he power to become sons of god
[54:17] even to them that believe on his name
[54:19] now you can take my brother and sister
[54:21] in a natural world
[54:22] i would guess my brother adam and those
[54:24] that work around construction or
[54:26] anything like that
[54:27] you can have uh the whole pile of lumber
[54:30] you can have everything there
[54:32] and give the exact same project to a
[54:36] multitude of people
[54:37] and the level of quality uh will be
[54:40] revealed
[54:41] that was in the master that was building
[54:43] the house
[54:44] the framer that built a house he can
[54:46] build it it can be so crooked you can't
[54:48] hardly work with it
[54:49] or it can be so perfect that you would
[54:51] experience the perfection
[54:53] and so that will always be reflected my
[54:56] brother and sister in that house i
[54:58] remember years ago as a young man
[55:00] me and several other young men banded
[55:02] together and
[55:03] we were working for some contractors
[55:05] hanging drywall
[55:07] and we worked for a guy unfortunately he
[55:09] was the one that paid the quickest
[55:11] and um produced the most houses
[55:14] but i can remember little things like
[55:16] going into a bathroom
[55:17] and the back wall uh being you know 96
[55:21] inches at the top
[55:22] and 94 at the bottom now my brother and
[55:25] sister the man building
[55:27] house after house after house you would
[55:28] think someone in their
[55:30] uh group would own a level you would
[55:33] think someone would
[55:34] understand how to read the level but you
[55:36] see they had all of that
[55:38] but they didn't care
[55:42] they didn't care to take what was
[55:44] provided to
[55:45] them and make the best of it
[55:48] to them it was the faster i do this
[55:52] the more i get the more money i make
[55:55] and so that was their that was their um
[55:59] their approach amen you know what's
[56:02] funny
[56:03] uh when brother bob sister joanne moved
[56:05] where they did
[56:06] there's actually houses on that street
[56:08] and the street to the south of them
[56:11] that uh we hung the drywall in them and
[56:14] some of those houses
[56:15] uh i would take them if they would give
[56:17] them to me but i sure
[56:18] wouldn't take them on the expectation of
[56:20] the quality they reflected
[56:23] amen if you understand what i'm saying
[56:25] and so every time we would drive by or
[56:27] go to brother bob's or
[56:29] even drive down the highway there it
[56:30] takes me back to a time
[56:32] uh my brother and sister when something
[56:34] could have been
[56:36] to the utmost of perfection or quality
[56:39] it uh was not and so he's here now
[56:42] and as many as has received him he's
[56:44] gave he the power to become the sons of
[56:47] god what are you going to do with that
[56:48] power
[56:49] what are you going are you going to let
[56:51] that power let you be a mediocre
[56:53] christian
[56:54] are you going to take that power and
[56:55] have just enough to claim the name of
[56:57] christ
[56:58] or are you going to take that and become
[57:02] the very sons and daughters of god
[57:05] amen it's time as i spoke the other day
[57:08] it's time to quit giving lip service
[57:10] to the message of the hour quit giving
[57:13] lip service
[57:14] and time for us to say you know what i'm
[57:16] going to make a full commitment
[57:17] i don't want to get sidetracked in my
[57:19] stuff but i i pulled a message book
[57:21] out of the bookcase and was just looking
[57:24] and once again god spoke
[57:26] to me and brother branham says it is
[57:29] the time or the season if you're ever
[57:32] going to do
[57:33] something for god do it now
[57:37] boy i tell you what something to stir
[57:39] you if there ever was a time
[57:41] ever was a season to do something for
[57:43] god
[57:44] do it now i say that's just as effective
[57:47] as it was when it was preached in 1963.
[57:50] amen it's just as reflected right there
[57:52] my brother and sister
[57:53] it's more valid actually i would say
[57:55] today than it was
[57:56] then amen hallelujah
[58:00] well you know as we look and we
[58:01] recognize now what god is doing has he
[58:04] come
[58:04] he is the word amen and the word was
[58:06] made flesh
[58:07] we see the results of the ministry of
[58:09] our lord jesus christ
[58:11] now as we'll look at that and we see
[58:13] what that is doing
[58:14] to the people will understand my brother
[58:17] and sister that without a revelation
[58:19] from god now i'm not going to go into
[58:20] all what sermons it was i cut all that
[58:23] back
[58:23] but brother branham said god is the
[58:25] interpreter of his own word
[58:27] amen so while we would be here and some
[58:30] people say you're not allowed then to
[58:32] say
[58:32] i believe it meant this that's not
[58:34] really what he's saying my brother and
[58:36] sister we can look through the word
[58:38] and as revelation comes to you and i the
[58:40] scripture comes alive does it not
[58:42] amen the bible means more to us today
[58:45] than it ever has in our life
[58:47] and the prophet of god said that when we
[58:49] see
[58:50] amen i'm just paraphrasing when we see
[58:53] this book it will become a brand
[58:57] new book it will not be just the same
[59:00] old bible with the same old results
[59:02] but as the bible is revealed or opened
[59:05] to us
[59:06] now this revelation my brother and
[59:07] sister it's not a new revelation it can
[59:09] only be what is already
[59:11] in the word amen remember when brother
[59:13] branham was there about the seals and
[59:15] somebody said oh brother branham the
[59:17] things that you could write
[59:19] and he says no it was a new revelation i
[59:22] can't it was there
[59:24] i can't add to it
[59:28] amen so we're not looking for a new
[59:30] revelation we're looking for what is
[59:32] there to be revealed there's where the
[59:34] revelation comes
[59:35] and let it be revealed in us
[59:39] because otherwise people go off on
[59:41] tangents amen
[59:42] and all kinds of nonsense that takes
[59:45] place
[59:46] and and you know it's it's a remarkable
[59:49] thing my brother and sister how
[59:50] confusing
[59:51] the message can become when man himself
[59:54] not the holy spirit
[59:55] but man himself tries to interpret
[59:58] that's it becomes very confusing
[1:00:05] in john the 10th chapter
[1:00:09] the scripture says then the jews came
[1:00:12] round about him and said unto him
[1:00:14] how long dost thou make us to doubt
[1:00:17] now i bring this out because you see my
[1:00:19] brother and sister brother branham
[1:00:22] here again i i didn't bring all the
[1:00:23] quotes because i just don't want to
[1:00:24] confuse the time today
[1:00:26] but brother branham says that the
[1:00:28] preaching
[1:00:29] of the word either brings revelation
[1:00:32] or it blinds their eyes
[1:00:36] the very same word opens one's eyes and
[1:00:40] blinds another
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:47] see what they said right here how long
[1:00:50] does thou make us to doubt why didn't
[1:00:53] jesus words
[1:00:54] cause them to believe you see the
[1:00:57] anointing that was on them
[1:00:58] they heard his words and it caused them
[1:01:01] to doubt
[1:01:03] if thou be the christ tell us plainly
[1:01:06] jesus answered them i told you
[1:01:11] he doesn't try to explain it out again
[1:01:14] he tells him i already told you now
[1:01:16] look this is i'm drawing this down maybe
[1:01:18] in a little personal realm here
[1:01:20] but you see he's the light had already
[1:01:22] revealed revelation
[1:01:24] and there was those right there in that
[1:01:26] midst whose eyes were open
[1:01:28] and they were like oh my this is the
[1:01:30] messiah
[1:01:31] and there's others standing right there
[1:01:33] saying why are you causing us to doubt
[1:01:35] why don't you show us
[1:01:37] and he says i already did i already did
[1:01:40] what the word was intended to do it's
[1:01:42] already doing
[1:01:43] some are seeing some are not oh my
[1:01:47] i told you and you believe not the works
[1:01:50] that i do in my father's name they bear
[1:01:52] witness
[1:01:52] of me but ye believe not because ye are
[1:01:56] not of my sheep
[1:01:58] as i said unto you well you know what my
[1:02:01] brother and sister
[1:02:03] that'd be enough to make some of us
[1:02:06] angry
[1:02:08] he just told me i was born in the church
[1:02:12] i was raised in the church i've always
[1:02:14] been faithful in the church
[1:02:17] and he just told me i'm not one of his
[1:02:18] sheep
[1:02:20] then they will catch a revelation of
[1:02:22] course
[1:02:23] we're not beelzebub sheep that's it
[1:02:30] that's right we're not of that we're of
[1:02:32] the church
[1:02:35] but see they've missed this revelation
[1:02:37] of who they were dealing with
[1:02:40] they missed the opening of the word amen
[1:02:43] and in that by missing the opening of
[1:02:45] the word it caused them to come up with
[1:02:47] a whole different
[1:02:48] conclusion of what the word was meaning
[1:02:50] amen
[1:02:52] you're not of my sheep as i said unto
[1:02:54] you my sheep
[1:02:56] hear my voice my and i know them
[1:03:00] and they follow me and i give unto them
[1:03:03] eternal life
[1:03:05] now my brother and sister i hope i can
[1:03:07] just get all these thoughts that's went
[1:03:08] through my mind these last few days and
[1:03:10] i can get them
[1:03:10] reflected out to you by god's grace amen
[1:03:14] i ask him don't let me say a word that
[1:03:15] he doesn't want me to say
[1:03:17] amen but you see my brother and sister
[1:03:19] here is eternal life
[1:03:22] was in christ
[1:03:26] the word so the only life there is
[1:03:30] is back in the word but it will be the
[1:03:32] word that recognizes the word
[1:03:34] that jesus christ preached which is the
[1:03:37] recognized word
[1:03:38] that was in the beginning amen
[1:03:42] see how god brings continuity right down
[1:03:44] through everything
[1:03:45] there's no deviation there's no jogs
[1:03:48] that's right
[1:03:49] amen and i give unto them eternal life
[1:03:53] and they shall never perish
[1:03:55] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:03:56] my hand now remember saints
[1:04:00] i was telling you the other day don't
[1:04:01] even remember what service it was don't
[1:04:03] worry about being deceived
[1:04:05] somebody might come with false doctrine
[1:04:07] they'll come with something that's been
[1:04:08] tainted
[1:04:09] and they'll lay it on the table in front
[1:04:11] of you
[1:04:12] and there you would say oh lord help us
[1:04:14] we don't want to be deceived
[1:04:16] my brother and sister it's a holy ghost
[1:04:18] that will either
[1:04:19] cause you to partake or cause you to
[1:04:22] reject that
[1:04:25] it won't be any man it won't be a man
[1:04:27] standing here in this pulpit that keeps
[1:04:29] you from being deceived
[1:04:30] and believe it or not see people argue
[1:04:32] with this it won't be a man
[1:04:34] in a pulpit that will deceive you
[1:04:36] because if the holy ghost is in you
[1:04:39] it's a holy ghost that says i seal you
[1:04:42] until the day of your redemption amen so
[1:04:45] it won't be because we said under so and
[1:04:47] so ministry
[1:04:48] and we don't have to worry about being
[1:04:49] deceived no it's the holy ghost sealing
[1:04:52] you
[1:04:52] until the day of your redemption is what
[1:04:54] brings you to the place of confidence
[1:04:56] that you don't have to worry about being
[1:04:58] deceived
[1:04:59] hallelujah but i want to give you the
[1:05:00] flip side of that then we're not talking
[1:05:03] about men all right hey man i got quotes
[1:05:05] here where brother branham says oh it
[1:05:06] wasn't me when this happened it wasn't
[1:05:08] me when this was said it wasn't me it
[1:05:10] was him
[1:05:11] amen so this is throw the man equation
[1:05:13] right out of here
[1:05:14] so the word will come my brother and
[1:05:17] sister and because the sheep
[1:05:19] know his voice this word will come
[1:05:22] and be laid down in front of you and i
[1:05:25] and we are there to eat it and there'll
[1:05:27] be something inside of us that says
[1:05:30] that's what i was looking for
[1:05:32] that's what my heart hungers for that's
[1:05:34] the word that brings me
[1:05:37] the words of eternal life amen
[1:05:41] hallelujah you see that has to come my
[1:05:44] brother and sister the word
[1:05:46] has to bring that light because
[1:05:50] only in the word is eternal life
[1:05:54] no other place it's not an inform it's
[1:05:56] not in function it's not in a building
[1:05:58] it's not
[1:05:58] in a man as it were but it has to be the
[1:06:02] word
[1:06:02] because the words are the words of
[1:06:04] eternal life amen aren't you glad today
[1:06:06] we can stand with the confidence
[1:06:08] we don't have to tiptoe around just
[1:06:10] afraid that
[1:06:12] somebody says something you know look
[1:06:14] maybe sister sue might remember this so
[1:06:16] my family might remember this but
[1:06:18] years ago when we were uptown we had a
[1:06:20] visiting minister he's highly
[1:06:21] recommended to us oh great guy come
[1:06:24] he come on wednesday night and he was
[1:06:26] preaching a lovely service and then he
[1:06:27] deviated off into a
[1:06:29] into a a thought
[1:06:32] and what it come down to i tried to do
[1:06:34] my homework saints to figure this out
[1:06:37] and what it come down to is he took the
[1:06:39] last half of a quote out of the
[1:06:41] revelation of jesus christ
[1:06:43] and he took a first half of a quote out
[1:06:45] of
[1:06:46] the church age book and he married them
[1:06:49] together
[1:06:50] and he speaks this out and something
[1:06:52] struck me at the moment and i was like
[1:06:54] that's not right and i was i'm sorry to
[1:06:57] admit this i pray god would give me
[1:06:59] courage today just
[1:07:00] to stand up and say you're done
[1:07:04] song leader come might be a short
[1:07:06] service today but
[1:07:08] we're done but i was sitting there going
[1:07:12] oh my goodness this is wrong lord what
[1:07:13] do i do i
[1:07:14] uh and my heart rate went up my blood
[1:07:18] pressure went up
[1:07:19] i got almost mentally dizzy lord what do
[1:07:21] i do what do i do
[1:07:24] but don't ever forget it's the holy
[1:07:27] ghost
[1:07:28] that's going to keep you it's not going
[1:07:31] to be the pastor that jumps up
[1:07:33] bold it's going to be the holy ghost and
[1:07:35] that man as he spoke those words all of
[1:07:37] a sudden he stops
[1:07:39] and he goes oh you guys
[1:07:43] don't like that
[1:07:47] did he catch my spirit no
[1:07:51] it was the holy spirit pushing back
[1:07:54] on those words it was not one of us like
[1:07:58] oh that's terrible
[1:08:01] it was holy ghost and the holy ghost
[1:08:04] said i'm not going to allow that to
[1:08:05] happen
[1:08:06] well what started off as a beautiful
[1:08:08] service went
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:13] we got out of church and i said why
[1:08:16] as a visitor did you say that in our
[1:08:19] churches i took him back to the motel
[1:08:20] that night why
[1:08:22] he said i i don't know i just felt
[1:08:24] anointed to do that
[1:08:27] six months later he quit the message
[1:08:31] my brother and sister i just wanted i
[1:08:33] want to just lay this out to you
[1:08:35] don't look i don't believe you do
[1:08:39] but don't look here look in here
[1:08:44] it's the holy ghost that's sealing you
[1:08:46] to the day of your redemption
[1:08:48] hallelujah and so the word see comes to
[1:08:51] speak the word
[1:08:52] and when the word speaks my brother and
[1:08:54] sister the sheep here
[1:08:56] amen they can they cannot they cannot
[1:09:00] not hear
[1:09:00] amen hallelujah so they're saying how
[1:09:04] long you make us to doubt
[1:09:10] it was not jesus that made them doubt
[1:09:13] the word came
[1:09:14] forward it was a spirit in them
[1:09:18] because you see that works both ways
[1:09:21] that satanic or antichrist spirit
[1:09:25] always pushes back against the word
[1:09:28] just as the holy ghost would push back
[1:09:30] against the anti-word
[1:09:32] amen the anti-word pushes back against
[1:09:34] the holy ghost
[1:09:35] hallelujah
[1:09:38] well praise the lord
[1:09:42] amen and i give unto them eternal life
[1:09:44] and they shall never perish neither
[1:09:46] shall any man pluck them
[1:09:48] out of my hand don't worry about it
[1:09:51] you stay in the word you stay prayed up
[1:09:55] you stay in that personal uptight
[1:09:58] relationship with your bridegroom
[1:10:01] right he said ask anything in my name
[1:10:03] and i'll give it to you
[1:10:04] why because he knows what kind of wife
[1:10:06] he's marrying
[1:10:08] he's not marrying what do they call him
[1:10:09] in the world today gold diggers
[1:10:11] he's not marrying a gold digger he knows
[1:10:14] what kind of wife he's marrying
[1:10:16] and so much so he says ask anything in
[1:10:19] my name and i'll give it to you
[1:10:21] because he knows we're not going to be
[1:10:22] out here looking for a gold-plated
[1:10:24] bentley
[1:10:27] amen hallelujah and i shall give unto
[1:10:31] them eternal life and they shall never
[1:10:32] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[1:10:34] out of my hand my father which give
[1:10:38] them me is greater than all hallelujah
[1:10:41] whenever i read that it just reminds me
[1:10:43] of
[1:10:43] some of the little clips that have been
[1:10:45] made through the years you know the boy
[1:10:47] beating the other boy up on the steps of
[1:10:48] the school
[1:10:49] and the little boy every time that guy
[1:10:51] thump on him he'd tell him he says you
[1:10:52] shouldn't do this
[1:10:54] and the guy is like who's going to stop
[1:10:56] me and one day he says
[1:10:59] my father and the bully turns around
[1:11:04] and here's this great big guy and he
[1:11:07] reaches out and he grabs the holds of
[1:11:08] his caller
[1:11:09] and he says why are you doing this to my
[1:11:11] son
[1:11:14] and he says because your son is smarter
[1:11:17] than me
[1:11:18] has more friends than me everything laid
[1:11:21] out a whole list
[1:11:23] and the man says i have the ability
[1:11:27] to hurt you but i'm not going to
[1:11:31] because my son actually wants you for a
[1:11:34] friend
[1:11:35] there you are hmm
[1:11:39] amen not judgment
[1:11:42] not judgment i don't say this for the
[1:11:46] preacher's sake okay
[1:11:48] but it's on my mind spurgeon says if you
[1:11:50] come to church and you judge the
[1:11:51] preacher you are wrong
[1:11:53] because the preacher was called to judge
[1:11:55] you that's it
[1:11:58] that'd be a good one and i can take you
[1:12:00] to another quote where brother branham
[1:12:02] said that spurgeon was a man of god used
[1:12:04] to write the word in his day
[1:12:07] how's that for clench in the nail
[1:12:10] hallelujah
[1:12:11] but you see my brother and sister no
[1:12:13] minister true minister of the gospel
[1:12:15] will judge the people without the word
[1:12:17] judging him
[1:12:18] amen he's not exclusive hallelujah
[1:12:23] amen my father which gave them me is
[1:12:26] greater than all and no man is able to
[1:12:28] pluck them out of my father's hand
[1:12:29] i and my father are one now look my
[1:12:32] brother and sister his voice
[1:12:34] is what is moving the sheep the word
[1:12:38] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:12:39] was made flesh it's
[1:12:41] that voice the word that is moving the
[1:12:44] sheep
[1:12:44] and because we see clearly in the word
[1:12:47] of god how that we
[1:12:48] being of him from the very beginning the
[1:12:51] foundation of the world
[1:12:52] so he's the word we are the word
[1:12:55] amen you cannot separate this bride from
[1:12:58] the word
[1:12:59] and say that she is of a lesser value
[1:13:02] when she is the word in the beginning
[1:13:06] amen and so the word in the beginning
[1:13:08] comes down
[1:13:09] and as jesus is on the earth and all
[1:13:11] that was in christ he poured into the
[1:13:13] church right
[1:13:14] and then poured into you and i so as he
[1:13:17] is there and by the preaching of the
[1:13:19] word
[1:13:20] that people oh hallelujah that people of
[1:13:23] the book
[1:13:24] amen who were of the word right they
[1:13:26] were begotten of the father
[1:13:28] before the foundation of the world so it
[1:13:31] is the preaching
[1:13:32] of the word that liberates the word
[1:13:35] that has been deposited in laodicea are
[1:13:38] you with me
[1:13:39] amen so it is a preaching of that word
[1:13:42] that liberates this or we can put it in
[1:13:44] a lesser value if you please it
[1:13:46] liberates these people
[1:13:47] that were saved by grace but wait they
[1:13:49] were saved by grace win
[1:13:54] and it's the preaching of the word that
[1:13:56] liberates them here in this day
[1:13:58] and as it's there as the word comes
[1:14:00] we'll touch on this after a bit
[1:14:01] it's a washing it's a washing my brother
[1:14:04] and sister
[1:14:05] god is looking for gems you know i just
[1:14:08] read some stuff that this family this
[1:14:10] has been probably a decade ago or so
[1:14:13] this family is at a a tagged price yard
[1:14:16] sale rummage sale
[1:14:17] and they saw this cute little vase and
[1:14:20] so they're there and they were like that
[1:14:21] is unique we've never seen a vase like
[1:14:23] that before
[1:14:24] they buy that vase for three dollars
[1:14:26] they take it home they wash it
[1:14:28] all up i hope you're following me they
[1:14:30] wash it all up and they put it on the
[1:14:33] mantel in their house
[1:14:34] but one day something stirs them it was
[1:14:37] on their mantle for something like seven
[1:14:39] or eight years
[1:14:40] but one day something stirs them and
[1:14:43] they took it down off of the mantle
[1:14:45] and they took it to a to an appraiser or
[1:14:49] whatever
[1:14:49] and said you know we're intrigued by
[1:14:51] this face we've never
[1:14:53] seen one like this before and and so
[1:14:56] and the man looks at the thing and he
[1:14:58] says um this vase is worth
[1:15:00] probably anywhere from two to three
[1:15:02] hundred thousand dollars
[1:15:05] wow what is it of the northern dynasty
[1:15:09] of ling or something in china
[1:15:11] going way way back and the appraiser
[1:15:14] knowing what he
[1:15:15] is looking at says there's only one
[1:15:18] other vase
[1:15:18] in known uh knowledge
[1:15:22] and it's in a museum in england
[1:15:25] and the family says um we could really
[1:15:27] use a few hundred thousand dollars
[1:15:30] they commissioned it to be put out to
[1:15:31] auction and it brought like something
[1:15:33] like 2.25 million
[1:15:41] hallelujah i hope you're with me today
[1:15:46] i got plucked out of a rummage sale
[1:15:49] what i was was not determined
[1:15:52] on that day it had already been
[1:15:56] determined
[1:15:57] way way way way way back here
[1:16:01] but there come a time we'll call it a
[1:16:03] prophet of god
[1:16:04] that said i appraise these people that
[1:16:07] are sitting
[1:16:08] in these churches and i look at them
[1:16:11] and their value is much greater
[1:16:14] than anyone recognizes
[1:16:18] hallelujah now i hope you don't mind me
[1:16:21] using that story that way
[1:16:23] but i'll tell you what i if i had a
[1:16:24] little dish on my mantel
[1:16:27] and it turned out bringing 2.25 million
[1:16:29] i would no longer have a dish on my
[1:16:30] mantle
[1:16:32] hallelujah that thing would be gone
[1:16:34] hallelujah
[1:16:35] but i'll tell you what the price was
[1:16:37] paid in our lord jesus christ looked
[1:16:38] down through history and said i know
[1:16:40] where you came from and i know where
[1:16:41] you're going to
[1:16:43] and i alone get this saints i
[1:16:46] alone know the value of my people
[1:16:51] the scripture posted as ten thousand
[1:16:53] worlds but we have no way to actually
[1:16:55] accumulate the value of ten thousand
[1:16:57] worlds
[1:16:59] many years ago i took a a a scientific
[1:17:02] calculator it had like 10
[1:17:04] places or 12 or something like that
[1:17:07] and you might think this is silly i gone
[1:17:09] on the internet
[1:17:10] and i looked up the gdp
[1:17:14] or whatever they call a gross national
[1:17:16] product
[1:17:17] uh of and
[1:17:20] so i took calculator
[1:17:23] start in alphabetical order
[1:17:29] i look over the calculator has exceeded
[1:17:32] all values
[1:17:34] well i barely got started
[1:17:38] 10 000 worlds
[1:17:44] jesus christ alone knew the value what
[1:17:46] was it the word come
[1:17:47] and revealed the value of the word that
[1:17:50] was here on the earth unrecognized
[1:17:53] it was only him that could reveal the
[1:17:55] value of the unrecognized
[1:17:58] amen we did not see ourselves as sons
[1:18:00] and daughters of god we did not see
[1:18:02] ourselves
[1:18:03] as a part of the word of god we did not
[1:18:05] see ourself
[1:18:06] as eternal value but he did and he says
[1:18:10] i've paid a price that is equal to all
[1:18:12] of that
[1:18:13] my goodness my brother and sister i
[1:18:14] don't know how many people are here this
[1:18:16] morning
[1:18:16] but we've got i'm just going to call it
[1:18:17] 50 people we've got uh
[1:18:19] uh 10 000 worlds times 50 this morning
[1:18:23] right here in this little body of
[1:18:24] believers
[1:18:26] oh look at the price that jesus blood
[1:18:28] was worth
[1:18:29] amen that lamb slain before the
[1:18:31] foundation of the world
[1:18:32] look at the price of that blood oh
[1:18:35] hallelujah
[1:18:36] i'll tell you what and you know what
[1:18:39] it's his
[1:18:40] voice and his voice alone that removes
[1:18:43] the true
[1:18:43] sheep of god amen they the word
[1:18:47] says it don't hear any other voice
[1:18:49] that's right now i want to tie this
[1:18:50] right back together you know why you
[1:18:52] won't be deceived
[1:18:53] because you won't be able
[1:18:57] to hear any other voice
[1:19:00] it's not like well i gotta be careful he
[1:19:02] said something i've never heard before
[1:19:04] i'm gonna block that out
[1:19:05] no what you ought to do is say lord if
[1:19:07] that's truth
[1:19:08] reveal it and if it's not the truth
[1:19:12] bind it there's a solution to the
[1:19:15] preaching of the word that you don't
[1:19:16] understand
[1:19:17] if it's truth reveal it to me if it's
[1:19:19] not truth lord bind it
[1:19:21] what did the word say amen whatever you
[1:19:23] bind on earth
[1:19:25] will be bound whatever you loose will be
[1:19:27] loosed do we have confidence in the word
[1:19:28] of god
[1:19:30] or are we just giving lip service
[1:19:35] come on time to get over the lip service
[1:19:37] thing it's time to believe the word
[1:19:41] now brother brown says here
[1:19:45] i'll go ahead and move on brothers
[1:19:50] presuming amen brother brown says here i
[1:19:54] just love to read the word
[1:19:55] because i know that that's true the word
[1:19:58] is what we stay by
[1:19:59] it must always be the word of god or or
[1:20:02] we'll go on the wrong road
[1:20:04] it's written over in saint john 1 i
[1:20:06] think about the 15th chapter if you
[1:20:07] abide in me
[1:20:09] and my word in you see the word
[1:20:12] abides now you can go look in different
[1:20:14] dictionaries have breakdowns of
[1:20:15] different fashion on the word abide
[1:20:17] but it's to reside there live there stay
[1:20:20] there
[1:20:20] occupy amen
[1:20:24] so the word abides in you see then ask
[1:20:27] what you will
[1:20:29] and it'll be done come on do we have
[1:20:32] this kind of confidence things
[1:20:34] we need to have this kind of confidence
[1:20:37] we don't want to just walk around saying
[1:20:39] i believe the message god sent a prophet
[1:20:40] i believe the message
[1:20:41] we need to get to the place that that
[1:20:43] message that was revealed to us
[1:20:45] takes on life and comes into us and
[1:20:48] makes us
[1:20:49] as it were that formidable army that the
[1:20:51] prophet of god talks about
[1:20:53] when the bride recognizes who she is
[1:20:56] she'll be whipped all the time
[1:20:58] no sir he said that she will be the
[1:21:02] overcomer
[1:21:03] she will be victorious well it doesn't
[1:21:06] change my life brother paul have the
[1:21:07] same problems
[1:21:09] well maybe you're not approaching it
[1:21:11] correct i don't know because i'll tell
[1:21:13] you what it makes a huge difference in
[1:21:14] my life
[1:21:16] amen no it doesn't make me perfect i
[1:21:18] still get upset
[1:21:20] when i look out and somebody has stolen
[1:21:22] some of my property
[1:21:23] i'm out there like lord if they were
[1:21:25] right here right now what would i do
[1:21:27] first thought is i got a nine millimeter
[1:21:31] second thought is i pray for their soul
[1:21:35] so i have to choose which one of those
[1:21:36] i'm going to respond to
[1:21:39] but the word which is in us oh wait we
[1:21:42] are part of the word
[1:21:44] brings life the word doesn't bring death
[1:21:47] my brother and sister
[1:21:48] any man or woman who goes opposed to the
[1:21:51] word of god
[1:21:52] and walks away from that the scripture
[1:21:54] the bible jesus christ
[1:21:56] the message however you want to put it
[1:21:57] is not what condemns them to hell
[1:22:00] they made that decision
[1:22:09] reminds me of a story placed many years
[1:22:11] ago in the far north
[1:22:14] two men were mining for gold and they
[1:22:16] were successful and
[1:22:18] the one guy was always joking one of
[1:22:21] these days we're gonna have so much gold
[1:22:23] i'm have to kill
[1:22:24] you and take it all myself the other guy
[1:22:26] just laughs he goes yeah we're finding a
[1:22:28] lot of gold
[1:22:30] you see so plain
[1:22:35] it got laughed off thought his friend
[1:22:38] was
[1:22:38] friend thought his friend was joking
[1:22:44] until the day he started having belly
[1:22:46] aches
[1:22:48] and he died
[1:22:52] you see my brother and sister the devil
[1:22:55] is so sly that he puts his very desire
[1:23:00] to destroy you
[1:23:02] right out in the open
[1:23:09] and we laugh
[1:23:16] until we get a bellyache and we're like
[1:23:19] i'm just tired of religion i'm tired of
[1:23:21] church i'm tired of god i'm tired of
[1:23:23] everything because it just nothing
[1:23:25] changes i just hear the same old
[1:23:26] preaching all the time
[1:23:28] well spurgeon says that if we were all
[1:23:31] saved
[1:23:33] a short sermon would be sufficient
[1:23:42] go look it up if we were all saved a
[1:23:46] short sermon
[1:23:47] would be sufficient
[1:23:51] hallelujah
[1:23:57] now where was i ask what you will it
[1:24:00] will be done because it's not you
[1:24:03] it's the word that's in you
[1:24:06] when we get to the place we fully have
[1:24:09] comprehension
[1:24:10] that we are nothing and christ is
[1:24:14] everything then we can just march right
[1:24:17] on taking the promises of god
[1:24:19] and declaring them with full expectation
[1:24:23] they will come to pass because it's not
[1:24:25] me
[1:24:26] it's not you it's the word in you
[1:24:30] and the word is god see see god in you
[1:24:33] god is the word
[1:24:34] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:24:35] word was with god and the word was god
[1:24:37] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:24:39] us
[1:24:39] now in the return of the holy spirit
[1:24:41] bringing the word in us
[1:24:43] it's abiding in there then it's not you
[1:24:47] that speaks it's the word itself coming
[1:24:50] out
[1:24:51] so it the word will perform the work
[1:24:54] amen this is why my brother and sister
[1:24:56] it takes the word
[1:24:58] to reveal the word because you see we
[1:25:01] are identified by our words are we not
[1:25:04] amen all mankind is identified by their
[1:25:08] words
[1:25:08] you'll hear people it'll say and i knew
[1:25:10] these guys but people that knew them a
[1:25:12] lot longer
[1:25:13] they had nicknamed this father and son
[1:25:16] doom and gloom
[1:25:18] and in the farming circle they were
[1:25:19] known people would be referring they
[1:25:21] never said oh it's john and philip they
[1:25:23] said it's doom and gloom
[1:25:26] why because everything that come out of
[1:25:27] their mouth it would be you know january
[1:25:29] it's going to be another bad year of
[1:25:31] farming
[1:25:33] the weather the price of crops
[1:25:35] everything
[1:25:36] we're going to just lose money this year
[1:25:39] remember sitting there listening to them
[1:25:41] i hope you don't mind me putting this
[1:25:42] context i sat there and listened to them
[1:25:44] and i i it actually had effect on me
[1:25:46] because i just finished my budget and i
[1:25:47] had just turned it into my banker asking
[1:25:49] for a few hundred thousand dollars and
[1:25:51] my budget showed me making money
[1:25:52] and here's doom and gloom sitting around
[1:25:54] the table telling everybody the
[1:25:56] government the weather
[1:25:57] the crop prices everything we're all
[1:25:59] going to lose money
[1:26:00] now i had to make a decision hope you
[1:26:02] follow me i had to make a decision do i
[1:26:04] believe
[1:26:04] what i researched do i do i believe
[1:26:08] what i labor to come and answer to or do
[1:26:11] i believe these are anointed by a spirit
[1:26:13] of doom and gloom
[1:26:14] oh i'm going to put this and twist this
[1:26:16] around you got people around this
[1:26:17] message that are all like
[1:26:18] we got to be so careful we need to just
[1:26:20] i hope this don't offend anybody but it
[1:26:22] fits if it's called for cog
[1:26:24] we gotta only listen to the prophet or
[1:26:26] we're gonna be deceived you
[1:26:28] find the prophet's words that will back
[1:26:29] that up
[1:26:32] the prophet of god don't back that up
[1:26:33] what is that that's a spirit of doom
[1:26:36] and gloom because i study my bible i
[1:26:39] look what the prophet of god said
[1:26:41] my brother and sister i would encourage
[1:26:43] you to do this too i like to read more
[1:26:45] than listen
[1:26:45] i read brother branham says this and
[1:26:47] this and refers to a scripture
[1:26:49] i take my bible i open it up i read it
[1:26:51] for myself
[1:26:52] do i not trust the prophet no that's not
[1:26:54] what it's about
[1:26:55] i need to understand the revelation of
[1:26:58] what he's talking about
[1:27:00] and so i go back to that original the
[1:27:02] urem from thumb
[1:27:03] and the urim thumb oh see people get so
[1:27:05] confused we're not judging the prophet
[1:27:07] oh come on saint we're not judging the
[1:27:09] prophet by the urim thummim
[1:27:11] we're judging ourself all these people
[1:27:14] like
[1:27:15] well you're judging brother bradham no
[1:27:16] you missed the point entirely
[1:27:18] we are not here judging a prophet god
[1:27:20] judges the prophet
[1:27:22] amen but we'll take the word and we take
[1:27:24] it back to the bible the urem thumb
[1:27:26] and we judge ourselves
[1:27:30] lord am i i want to read the context of
[1:27:32] this lord
[1:27:33] oh oh help me lord exactly oh help me
[1:27:36] lord
[1:27:38] amen the earth thumb on people god
[1:27:41] you're in someone we're going to judge
[1:27:42] everybody oh you're judging the prophet
[1:27:43] we're judging you by the urine from them
[1:27:45] why don't you judge yourself why don't
[1:27:48] you stop long enough
[1:27:49] to take the urim thumb and judge
[1:27:51] yourself that's right
[1:27:53] that's right amen
[1:27:58] hallelujah i'm trying to stay away from
[1:28:02] the negative my brother and sister
[1:28:04] but if i didn't believe the prophet you
[1:28:06] know i had somebody accuse me well you
[1:28:07] don't even believe the prophet
[1:28:08] you wouldn't say what you said if you
[1:28:10] believe the prophet i wouldn't be here
[1:28:12] preaching to you if i didn't believe the
[1:28:13] prophet
[1:28:15] hallelujah come on
[1:28:18] i'd be somewhere else i've told you this
[1:28:20] before i say it facetiously but there is
[1:28:22] a certain degree of truth to this
[1:28:23] i'd probably go over to my ancestry and
[1:28:25] become a mormon because they got all
[1:28:26] kinds of benefits
[1:28:28] i'm talking about all kinds of benefits
[1:28:30] you want to buy a bigger farm you can go
[1:28:32] right to the church
[1:28:33] and ask them to buy that farm and then
[1:28:36] you just make they're like the bank then
[1:28:39] if you have troubles
[1:28:40] they don't mind because you're part of
[1:28:42] them and
[1:28:43] they get it so if i didn't believe this
[1:28:47] message see i'd go
[1:28:48] find a church that had some
[1:28:50] materialistic
[1:28:54] benefits
[1:28:56] you know what i got for a materialistic
[1:28:57] benefit right here you know this message
[1:28:59] has a materialistic benefit
[1:29:01] it's called eternal life hallelujah i
[1:29:04] don't have to look at this old
[1:29:05] look at this poor face of mine this
[1:29:08] thing has developed more wrinkles in the
[1:29:09] last couple years than i can
[1:29:11] stand i look in the mirror and even
[1:29:14] sister jerry's like
[1:29:15] we need to get you some kind of lotions
[1:29:17] and some collagen
[1:29:19] and some stuff
[1:29:26] don't worry about this face don't worry
[1:29:29] about this face there'll be a day they
[1:29:30] might throw dirt on this face
[1:29:32] but i tell you what i've got i've got
[1:29:34] something and one of the reason i use
[1:29:35] the word materialistic is because it is
[1:29:37] tangible
[1:29:38] it is real it's not a theory it's not
[1:29:41] some kind of vapor
[1:29:43] i've got eternal life as my tangible
[1:29:46] benefit
[1:29:47] hallelujah amen see the word was made
[1:29:51] flesh
[1:29:52] see it's bringing the word in us look at
[1:29:54] this saints not to us
[1:29:57] get this i believe the prophet's words
[1:29:59] are are clear i think they were anointed
[1:30:01] it brings the word in
[1:30:05] amen this is not external it's abiding
[1:30:09] in there then it's not you
[1:30:12] what that's it amen when i feel like
[1:30:16] everything has fallen apart
[1:30:18] hallelujah i won't go into the topic my
[1:30:21] poor nephew brother chris was
[1:30:23] listening to our conversation the other
[1:30:25] day and i feel really bad brother chris
[1:30:26] that you listen to that
[1:30:27] because it sounds really negative
[1:30:29] because we're talking about certain
[1:30:31] things and we're talking about the
[1:30:32] problems and
[1:30:33] we're talking about uh and don't worry
[1:30:35] about this i'm not focused on this but i
[1:30:37] just want to make an example
[1:30:38] we're sitting there talking about how
[1:30:39] much money we lost
[1:30:41] in this certain avenue and trust me
[1:30:45] it'll be as much as most of you make and
[1:30:48] it just vaporized
[1:30:49] out of our midst this year
[1:30:52] but you know what that's
[1:30:55] nothing that's nothing compared to this
[1:31:00] that is nothing saints it has
[1:31:03] no measure to even be compared
[1:31:07] because the word is speaking to the word
[1:31:11] and the word is saying not building on
[1:31:13] this earth
[1:31:14] not taking or possessing of this earth
[1:31:17] not trying to have
[1:31:18] gold in houses and lands on this earth
[1:31:21] when i
[1:31:21] come and place you on this earth is so
[1:31:24] that you could manifest
[1:31:25] oh not that i'm such woe unto me and god
[1:31:28] help me
[1:31:28] but the word manifests a bride that
[1:31:32] declares the glory
[1:31:34] of god not what is wrong not
[1:31:37] is what my flesh not his what my mind
[1:31:40] not the troubles of life
[1:31:41] it is here that a bride is to declare
[1:31:44] the glory
[1:31:46] of almighty god hallelujah i'm sorry i
[1:31:49] even use that analogy to do that i i
[1:31:51] feel checked
[1:31:52] but i just want you to understand my
[1:31:53] brother and sister there's more
[1:31:55] than a checking account there's more
[1:31:57] than that house
[1:31:58] there's more than those things we can
[1:32:00] lay our tangible hands upon
[1:32:02] and all of that can come and go and i
[1:32:05] was reading i was reading some reading
[1:32:07] of this guy and
[1:32:08] i i finally had to just quit because he
[1:32:10] had me just all shook up
[1:32:12] and he said this is the season talking
[1:32:14] now biden harris
[1:32:16] a nation that chose abortion
[1:32:19] and perverted rights over decency
[1:32:23] he said now is the season
[1:32:27] that the attributes of sodom will be
[1:32:29] manifested in our nation
[1:32:33] and your churches will become store
[1:32:36] houses
[1:32:37] right i think i'll put that to the side
[1:32:40] praise the lord why well i'm flash it
[1:32:44] makes me nervous thinking about this
[1:32:46] they're going to have a hard time
[1:32:47] getting a heister in here
[1:32:49] amen but looks
[1:32:54] the prophet of god says you're not even
[1:32:57] going to
[1:32:58] be here
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:02] hallelujah when tribulation falls on
[1:33:04] this earth the bride
[1:33:06] is not even here i think i'm going to go
[1:33:08] prepare myself for the tribulation
[1:33:11] no i'm going to prepare myself for a
[1:33:13] rapture
[1:33:14] hallelujah i'm going to get my ticket
[1:33:16] purchased
[1:33:18] you guys remember the day you could walk
[1:33:19] into the airport lay cash on the counter
[1:33:21] and get a plane ticket
[1:33:23] amen those days are gone now
[1:33:26] to take a flight you have to have
[1:33:29] preparation
[1:33:31] oh hallelujah amen revelation brings
[1:33:34] implementation i want to take a flight
[1:33:36] you sit down either call the travel
[1:33:38] agent or sit down on a computer and you
[1:33:40] got to do it
[1:33:41] you can't walk in there i don't care how
[1:33:42] much cash you've got in your pocket you
[1:33:44] won't buy a ticket at an airport
[1:33:46] amen hallelujah you see how it all fits
[1:33:49] together
[1:33:50] amen it's abiding in there that it's not
[1:33:53] you that speaks
[1:33:55] come on saints if you find yourself
[1:33:56] speaking something that is other than
[1:33:58] the word
[1:33:59] ask god forgive you and back up on that
[1:34:01] amen
[1:34:02] it's the word itself coming out so if
[1:34:04] the word will perform the work
[1:34:06] hallelujah amen now i've got quite a few
[1:34:09] quotes here and lord help me just to
[1:34:11] plow right through here my word is time
[1:34:13] go you know there's a scripture in the
[1:34:15] bible in first thessalonians 5 21 it's
[1:34:17] written prove all
[1:34:18] things hold faster that which is good
[1:34:21] when anything is proven it will either
[1:34:22] be proven right or wrong
[1:34:24] and when there's anything in question it
[1:34:27] should be proven until you find out what
[1:34:29] is right
[1:34:32] hallelujah well i believe the prophet of
[1:34:34] god meant this and this
[1:34:36] amen i don't believe that
[1:34:41] well why don't you go
[1:34:45] right should be proven there's anything
[1:34:47] in question should be proven till you
[1:34:48] find out
[1:34:49] whether it's right or wrong amen not
[1:34:53] a reaction of you preach that you're a
[1:34:55] deceiver
[1:34:57] now that was pointed hallelujah you want
[1:35:00] some more spurgeon quotes
[1:35:03] spurgeon says if the preaching of the
[1:35:05] work does not make you nervous
[1:35:07] the preacher has failed in his job amen
[1:35:10] hallelujah amen
[1:35:14] well praise the lord if you don't like
[1:35:16] it and just take it up with spurgeon
[1:35:18] and then you can take up with the quote
[1:35:19] where brother branham said that spurgeon
[1:35:21] was a man of god used to write even the
[1:35:22] word of god
[1:35:24] anyway on with that i don't mean to be
[1:35:27] jokey but my brother and sister it's
[1:35:29] about time that we'll stop and look at
[1:35:30] the word of god and say lord
[1:35:32] uh prove it to me lord it's okay to ask
[1:35:35] the lord right
[1:35:36] you see my brother and sister here's the
[1:35:38] basis
[1:35:41] it's never okay to question god
[1:35:46] are you with me never okay to question
[1:35:48] god
[1:35:50] but you're within your rights to ask god
[1:35:53] a question amen huge difference
[1:35:57] huge difference amen
[1:36:00] when there's anything in question it
[1:36:01] should be proven until you find out what
[1:36:03] is right
[1:36:04] and then as you find out what is right
[1:36:05] it said hold fast
[1:36:07] in other words grip it don't turn it
[1:36:10] loose
[1:36:10] hold it fast in other words hold it
[1:36:14] tight
[1:36:14] so that it will not slip hold fast to
[1:36:17] that which is good
[1:36:18] after it's been proven amen
[1:36:23] well praise the lord
[1:36:26] i took the first three lines of this
[1:36:28] quote in the middle of that one and this
[1:36:30] parrot here and that
[1:36:31] and i tied it all together
[1:36:35] and someone says to the prophet say that
[1:36:37] yes he did
[1:36:40] but where's the continuity where's the
[1:36:42] continuity
[1:36:43] brother brown uses the word see the
[1:36:45] devil come in and try and twist that
[1:36:47] try and take the word and twist that
[1:36:49] word
[1:36:50] hallelujah we don't need a dot dot dot
[1:36:53] kind of a message
[1:36:55] anything that's proven not right then
[1:36:57] turn it loose as quick as you can
[1:36:59] get away from it never don't uh never
[1:37:02] hold on to the wrong thing
[1:37:04] amen i think that's just a a really nice
[1:37:07] thought right there you know what i mean
[1:37:08] you look at that hallelujah now look
[1:37:11] here
[1:37:12] and uh
[1:37:16] where am i at hallelujah
[1:37:22] i'm just wound up right now i'm sorry
[1:37:25] some things
[1:37:25] my flesh wants to say and the lord is
[1:37:28] saying no
[1:37:30] okay ding
[1:37:34] thank you what do you do
[1:37:38] my brother and sister if you're going to
[1:37:39] prove something you have to do
[1:37:42] your due diligence
[1:37:47] i had this throw back in my face and i
[1:37:50] don't
[1:37:50] that what what happened about that being
[1:37:52] throwed my face doesn't not an issue
[1:37:55] but you see my brother and sister people
[1:37:57] will respond
[1:37:59] whatever whatever response it is they'll
[1:38:01] throw it back in your face
[1:38:04] and we have a tendency to try to explain
[1:38:06] to justify
[1:38:08] to defend that's right now some people
[1:38:11] wouldn't agree with it well you're the
[1:38:12] pastor you should be
[1:38:13] no i'm it's sorry holy ghost it's in
[1:38:16] control
[1:38:20] you see brother branham says now forgive
[1:38:22] me i'm paraphrasing this
[1:38:23] brother branham says now if the holy
[1:38:26] ghost
[1:38:27] can't change someone's mind
[1:38:30] why do you think you will
[1:38:35] this is not the truth come on why why
[1:38:38] argue over the word of god why why are
[1:38:40] you i mean i've had folks and i say this
[1:38:43] in generality i've had folks
[1:38:45] argue with what you said and you say
[1:38:46] it's right here the brother branham said
[1:38:48] it
[1:38:48] that's not what he meant well i don't
[1:38:51] know what he meant then if that's not
[1:38:53] what he meant
[1:38:54] but there is literally in this case 111
[1:38:57] quotes that say the same thing
[1:38:58] so the prophet of god missed the mark a
[1:39:01] hundred and eleven
[1:39:02] times yes
[1:39:08] now i'm not speaking proud of paul don't
[1:39:10] misunderstand
[1:39:12] i just said okay
[1:39:17] because if we've got all this evidence
[1:39:19] of scripture and quotes from the prophet
[1:39:21] and that won't change their mind why why
[1:39:23] would i argue
[1:39:25] why i would argue amen amen
[1:39:29] hold fast so it won't slip these things
[1:39:31] that are good hold fast to it
[1:39:33] after it's been proven right and
[1:39:35] anything that's proven not right turn it
[1:39:36] loose as quick as you can
[1:39:38] get away from it never hold on to the
[1:39:40] wrong thing that's it hallelujah that's
[1:39:42] it
[1:39:43] you see we have to do our diligence
[1:39:45] that's the homework
[1:39:46] who has to prove your calling an
[1:39:49] election
[1:39:52] not me if i'm preaching the truth to you
[1:39:56] and you should know whether i am or not
[1:39:58] if i'm preaching truth to you
[1:40:00] it's now on your court to prove your
[1:40:03] calling in your election
[1:40:04] amen well lord the preacher did this and
[1:40:07] i just couldn't believe any longer
[1:40:09] no no that's i'm sorry that won't work
[1:40:11] not a valid excuse
[1:40:13] amen you see what it is you know what
[1:40:16] doing your due diligence you know what
[1:40:18] your homework is saints
[1:40:22] some people disagree with me i'm sorry i
[1:40:24] hope that there isn't any here today but
[1:40:28] some people think their due diligence is
[1:40:29] to check the message
[1:40:31] and the bible against me
[1:40:39] you know what the prophet of god now
[1:40:40] this is kind of drawn out so you're not
[1:40:42] going to go just punch it and find some
[1:40:43] quote to it
[1:40:44] prophet of god shows that you doing your
[1:40:46] homework doing your due diligence
[1:40:48] is you checking yourself against this
[1:40:52] there's your due diligence not whether
[1:40:54] the preacher is right because i'll tell
[1:40:55] you right if you check yourself against
[1:40:57] this and the preacher is not right god
[1:41:00] will reveal to you that this is not
[1:41:01] right
[1:41:02] and god will deal with this man remove
[1:41:04] him off the scene
[1:41:05] or correct him or whatever but it won't
[1:41:08] matter if you got him corrected
[1:41:10] if yourself is not corrected
[1:41:14] it won't do hallelujah one bit of
[1:41:19] am i building a framework for the
[1:41:21] preacher no i'm not
[1:41:23] god hold him subject to the word every
[1:41:25] preacher that ever stands in this church
[1:41:27] god hold him subject to the word
[1:41:29] amen no no uh no ruling class no royalty
[1:41:33] no
[1:41:34] you know exemptions hold every one of us
[1:41:37] right to the word
[1:41:38] hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:41:42] oh hallelujah now look
[1:41:46] i i wasn't going to preach long today
[1:41:47] and i'm sorry i really am i'm not
[1:41:48] apologizing but i just
[1:41:50] really look the court of law natural
[1:41:54] will not accept anything
[1:41:58] but a first-hand account
[1:42:02] aren't you glad
[1:42:06] i won't mention the song but those of
[1:42:07] you that were caught up in those things
[1:42:09] you'll know what it is
[1:42:12] you see you can't go into a natural
[1:42:14] court of law
[1:42:16] that i heard it from a friend
[1:42:19] who heard it from a friend
[1:42:25] did you see it yourself no
[1:42:29] witness dismissed holds no weight in the
[1:42:32] court of law
[1:42:35] now my brother and sister as the bride
[1:42:37] of christ
[1:42:38] god's not looking for us to show up
[1:42:43] with a second hand
[1:42:46] understanding a second hand revelation
[1:42:50] oh even a second hand forgiveness
[1:42:55] amen amen you got to get it firsthand
[1:43:01] you know i want to just say this and i
[1:43:02] say it with love maybe it's time
[1:43:04] we start proving the word ourself that's
[1:43:06] right well
[1:43:07] we believe our pastor is a holy
[1:43:08] ghost-filled man and he wouldn't preach
[1:43:10] anything false to us that's good
[1:43:11] i i would hope you feel that way but
[1:43:14] how about it's the season now for you to
[1:43:16] prove the word
[1:43:17] yourself how about it's time for you to
[1:43:21] dig into the word
[1:43:22] and be able to stand on your own feet
[1:43:24] and i'm not saying you're not
[1:43:26] okay i'm just preaching you might say
[1:43:28] well i don't want to call it a
[1:43:29] generality
[1:43:30] i hope it's pointed to those of you that
[1:43:31] don't
[1:43:33] but you need to be able to stand and say
[1:43:35] you know what the preacher might have
[1:43:37] slipped he might have just got confused
[1:43:38] there what he said
[1:43:39] but that don't line up and then i'm just
[1:43:43] going to paint a scenario you'd come to
[1:43:44] the pastor
[1:43:45] preacher minister whoever and say you
[1:43:47] said this
[1:43:48] and it doesn't line up now we're going
[1:43:50] to assume that this is a
[1:43:52] a godly man who cares and he's going to
[1:43:54] go oh my no no i knew that
[1:43:56] what did i say you said this and this oh
[1:43:59] you know what he'll do we'll come right
[1:44:00] up here and he'll say i'm sorry
[1:44:03] i didn't mean it that way i got i got
[1:44:04] two thoughts tied together and they've
[1:44:06] come out jumbled
[1:44:07] but you see if there's a contrary spirit
[1:44:10] what they're going to do is lean on you
[1:44:11] then
[1:44:12] you don't understand this is a
[1:44:14] revelation
[1:44:16] no i already got a revelation i've
[1:44:18] already been there i proved it myself
[1:44:19] i've got a revelation
[1:44:21] that i have a urem from them that i am
[1:44:23] allowed by god to take it right back
[1:44:24] and put it before the urum thumb and it
[1:44:26] didn't pass the test
[1:44:30] just saying just saying church
[1:44:34] hallelujah you see it's time for us to
[1:44:36] prove the word ourself
[1:44:37] to bring the testimony of a first hand
[1:44:39] experience
[1:44:41] amen why why brother paul you were
[1:44:42] talking about the word revealing the
[1:44:44] word
[1:44:44] that's right my brother and sister
[1:44:46] because the prophet of god said that
[1:44:48] as i said earlier the the preaching of
[1:44:50] the word will either open
[1:44:52] eyes or it will blind them
[1:44:55] amen now i i don't think i'll make it
[1:44:59] there so i'll just throw this in just as
[1:45:01] a deal
[1:45:02] let's deal with the story of naaman
[1:45:06] and we'll jump over all the time
[1:45:11] that gehazei walked with elisha
[1:45:16] years of faithful service
[1:45:22] but some garments and some gold
[1:45:27] busted that thing wide open
[1:45:30] now look where that story starts i'm
[1:45:32] going to ruin a future sermon here
[1:45:34] look where that story starts a little
[1:45:37] girl
[1:45:38] with a first-hand experience that says
[1:45:42] i would that my lord meaning her master
[1:45:44] naaman
[1:45:45] i would that my lord would know the god
[1:45:48] of israel
[1:45:51] starts with a little girl what a
[1:45:53] first-hand testimony
[1:45:54] she didn't sit in church dreaming about
[1:45:56] dolls she knew that god was real she
[1:45:58] maybe was a captive and you think god's
[1:46:01] forsaken her did he
[1:46:02] no it was god wanting to move in
[1:46:04] naaman's life sets it all up that a
[1:46:06] little girl was taken
[1:46:07] drunk full of sorrow and tears and fears
[1:46:10] and drug and now as a serpent
[1:46:12] in the house of name and and she had
[1:46:14] enough courage and enough backbone and
[1:46:16] enough revelation to say
[1:46:17] i would that my master brother chris we
[1:46:20] were we were talking
[1:46:21] and i like how he brought that he says
[1:46:23] there's something about the character of
[1:46:25] naaman that little girl didn't cringe in
[1:46:29] fear
[1:46:30] to mention the god of israel but the
[1:46:33] story goes on and here david goes
[1:46:35] following a little girl a servant a
[1:46:38] little girl's testimony
[1:46:40] and following that and he goes and he
[1:46:42] goes to elisha
[1:46:43] and he's there he's got all kinds of
[1:46:45] gifts it's not i don't think he had
[1:46:46] bribery in mind i think he was thinking
[1:46:48] reward right i mean
[1:46:49] as in thank you and but he goes and and
[1:46:52] elisha
[1:46:54] just tells him yeah go dip seven times
[1:46:55] in the river
[1:46:58] and he's rough
[1:47:01] oh but look how god sets the stage
[1:47:04] saints
[1:47:05] look how god's so in control and
[1:47:07] something
[1:47:08] has revealed the word amen the word
[1:47:11] revealing the
[1:47:13] word and so here he's roth
[1:47:16] isn't the waters of damascus isn't our
[1:47:18] waters of syria aren't they all superior
[1:47:20] and his master says but o master
[1:47:24] once again speaking of the character of
[1:47:25] naaman because he didn't
[1:47:27] cut his head off he said
[1:47:30] if he had asked you to do something
[1:47:33] great
[1:47:34] would you have not done it
[1:47:38] go read your bible naaman doesn't go
[1:47:41] and sit down and have to ponder this he
[1:47:43] hears these words and it pricks
[1:47:44] something in him
[1:47:45] and he said that's the truth if he'd
[1:47:48] asked me to do some great thing
[1:47:50] i would have marched right off to do it
[1:47:52] and his
[1:47:53] servant used as god's servant
[1:47:57] had faith the servant had faith get this
[1:48:00] saints
[1:48:00] it's not even written in the scripture
[1:48:02] the servant had faith
[1:48:04] in what elisha had told his master amen
[1:48:08] more faith than the master did himself
[1:48:12] lord master if he asked you to do
[1:48:14] something
[1:48:15] hard wouldn't you have done it
[1:48:20] amen hallelujah
[1:48:23] praise the lord why do we struggle so
[1:48:27] much with the little things saints
[1:48:31] why are we struggling you know so much
[1:48:34] with the little things
[1:48:37] god help us amen god help us the word's
[1:48:41] been revealed
[1:48:42] it's been revealed in us oh my god
[1:48:46] hallelujah now look at this
[1:48:54] i debated on whether to put this up
[1:48:56] because i feel like
[1:48:57] maybe i've been a little misunderstood
[1:48:59] in circumstances that have happened
[1:49:00] around this church lately
[1:49:03] but you see
[1:49:07] i was accused of calling people a wolf
[1:49:09] when i never mentioned their name
[1:49:12] i was speaking to a spirit people didn't
[1:49:14] accept that
[1:49:15] i could give you a quote right now where
[1:49:18] brother branham speaks on that
[1:49:21] not speaking to their names not speaking
[1:49:22] to their church their denominational
[1:49:24] names i try not to do that i'm speaking
[1:49:26] to the spirits that's exactly right now
[1:49:29] look at this
[1:49:32] it's possible now it is possible that
[1:49:35] staunch christians find people
[1:49:37] hold sometimes to the wrong thing
[1:49:39] thinking it's right
[1:49:40] that's right
[1:49:44] not exempt but then these things should
[1:49:46] be proven
[1:49:48] whether they are right or wrong
[1:49:51] now this might come across a little
[1:49:53] pointed i'm sorry if people would think
[1:49:54] it's pointed
[1:49:57] but when you come to someone and they
[1:49:59] are telling you the prophet said this
[1:50:01] the prophet said this prophet said
[1:50:03] and the day comes when all the evidence
[1:50:05] is laid in front of them that the
[1:50:06] prophet
[1:50:07] never ever said anything close to what
[1:50:09] they're saying
[1:50:11] and they'll look at you and say oh
[1:50:15] that was just a message myth
[1:50:24] what does this tell you
[1:50:28] see the writer is wrong i'm not going to
[1:50:32] abide
[1:50:32] you guys vote me out if you want no i'm
[1:50:34] not i don't misunderstand me
[1:50:35] vote me out if you want but as long as
[1:50:37] god and you allow me to stand here
[1:50:40] we're not going to run our church on a
[1:50:42] myth that's
[1:50:43] exactly right we're going to stand on
[1:50:45] this word right here
[1:50:46] it's either going to be right or wrong
[1:50:48] we're not looking at the human element
[1:50:49] well they said this and left an effort
[1:50:51] the
[1:50:52] but no i'm talking about the hardcore of
[1:50:54] the doctrine of this gospel
[1:50:55] amen we're not going to come but then
[1:50:58] these things should be proven whether
[1:50:59] they're right or wrong and it's the duty
[1:51:00] of oh look where it's headed here
[1:51:02] ouch ouch ouch ouch
[1:51:06] and it's the duty of all of us as we're
[1:51:08] expecting to go to heaven when jesus
[1:51:10] come
[1:51:11] and it's the minister's duty when any
[1:51:13] question is brought up
[1:51:14] that he solves this out and proves it
[1:51:16] before the people
[1:51:19] amen well hallelujah amen i won't say i
[1:51:22] do everything perfect
[1:51:23] right now i'll tell you right now what's
[1:51:25] happened in this church in the last year
[1:51:26] if i could do things different i would
[1:51:30] i'd have drawn the sword a lot sooner
[1:51:32] amen
[1:51:33] and i'd have done it a lot more private
[1:51:35] that's it
[1:51:37] if i had if i had the opportunity to go
[1:51:38] back i would have done that i would draw
[1:51:40] the sword a lot sooner and i'd have done
[1:51:41] it way more in private
[1:51:43] it would have never took place in our
[1:51:44] basement in our foyer in the back of our
[1:51:46] sanctuary when it never happened
[1:51:49] amen amen
[1:51:53] it's the duty of all of us can we say
[1:51:56] amen to that line
[1:51:58] as we're expecting go to heaven when
[1:51:59] jesus come and it's a minister's duty
[1:52:01] brother chris brother david brother paul
[1:52:03] can you say amen amen
[1:52:05] when any question is brought up he
[1:52:06] solves this out and then proves it
[1:52:08] before the people
[1:52:09] see some of this stuff you can't just
[1:52:11] brush it over and ignore it and
[1:52:13] let it go on it's got to be proved out
[1:52:16] before the people
[1:52:18] hallelujah that they might understand
[1:52:22] because no one wants to be found wrong
[1:52:24] holding the wrong thing
[1:52:25] so we have a scripture jesus said all
[1:52:26] scriptures must be fulfilled that we
[1:52:28] should prove all things
[1:52:29] and then hold fast or hold tight get a
[1:52:31] death grip on it and don't turn it loose
[1:52:33] hold
[1:52:33] fast to that which is good hallelujah
[1:52:37] sometimes we look at these things my
[1:52:38] brother and sister and jump right in
[1:52:39] here and
[1:52:40] and uh we look at things and if we're
[1:52:43] we're not careful
[1:52:44] we kind of just breeze over them
[1:52:47] amen brother adam has a boat
[1:52:52] i bought one this last year you got to
[1:52:54] use it a little bit
[1:52:56] i'm telling you something you don't
[1:52:57] breeze over
[1:53:00] putting the drain plug in
[1:53:04] you can breeze over a lot of things i
[1:53:05] like an evinrude i like a mercury i want
[1:53:07] a yamaha i want this i want that i want
[1:53:10] a prop boat i want a jet boat i want to
[1:53:11] whatever
[1:53:12] but you better possess is a drain plug
[1:53:17] because no matter what else you've got
[1:53:19] and how you think how pretty your boat
[1:53:20] is and how many
[1:53:21] money you spent on it or whatever it is
[1:53:23] if you don't put that drain plug in
[1:53:24] there you don't have a boat
[1:53:26] that's right hallelujah
[1:53:29] amen so there comes a time my brother
[1:53:31] and sister that we not the preacher amen
[1:53:33] although the words talking about he
[1:53:34] needs to explain this but it's going to
[1:53:36] come to a time it's going to come right
[1:53:38] back to you
[1:53:39] that you have to prove all things is the
[1:53:41] message real or not
[1:53:42] yes sir i'm not going to speak ill of
[1:53:44] you if you decide it's not real
[1:53:46] i'll pray for you but you see you have
[1:53:49] to
[1:53:50] i have to prove it to ourself
[1:53:55] this is what i'm going to stake my whole
[1:53:56] life on amen
[1:54:00] now we come to a conclusion such a
[1:54:02] conclusion as we've already found in the
[1:54:04] word
[1:54:04] okay so brother brown is not taking us
[1:54:06] on a brother branham conclusion
[1:54:08] it's a conclusion found in the word as
[1:54:10] much as we believe in trying to find the
[1:54:12] oldest i read this
[1:54:13] quote to you just the other day if you
[1:54:14] got best manuscripts to get the best
[1:54:16] record of the word possible we will
[1:54:18] never get the true meaning of it by
[1:54:19] study or comparison of scriptures
[1:54:21] sincere as we may be it will take a
[1:54:23] revelation from god to bring it out
[1:54:26] that's exactly what paul said which
[1:54:27] things we also speak not in words which
[1:54:29] man's wisdom teaches
[1:54:31] but which the holy ghost teaches first
[1:54:33] corinthians 2 13
[1:54:35] the true revelation is god interpreting
[1:54:38] his own word
[1:54:39] by vindicating what is promised now
[1:54:41] don't let anybody be misled by what i
[1:54:43] have said and think that i do not
[1:54:44] believe in the accuracy of the word as
[1:54:46] we have it now have it
[1:54:48] i believe this bible is accurate
[1:54:51] jesus completely authenticated the old
[1:54:53] testament when here on earth
[1:54:55] and it was compiled exactly as was our
[1:54:57] new testament make no mistake about it
[1:54:59] we have the infallible
[1:55:01] word of god today and no man dares
[1:55:05] take it take from it or add to it but we
[1:55:08] need the same spirit that gave it
[1:55:12] what is this this is the word revealing
[1:55:16] the word
[1:55:17] amen not not another spirit trying to
[1:55:21] interpret the bible not another
[1:55:23] ideology interpreting the bible but the
[1:55:25] same
[1:55:26] spirit amen
[1:55:30] that gave it to teach it to us and how
[1:55:32] we need revelation by the spirit
[1:55:34] we don't need a new bible we don't need
[1:55:36] a new translation though some are very
[1:55:37] good and i'm not against it
[1:55:39] but we need the revelation of the spirit
[1:55:43] and thank god hallelujah can we thank
[1:55:45] god hallelujah thank god we can have
[1:55:48] what we need
[1:55:49] for god wants to reveal his word to us
[1:55:52] by the spirit it is not us getting down
[1:55:56] and begging and sobbing
[1:55:58] till god feels sorry for us it is god
[1:56:02] wanting to reveal himself to you and i
[1:56:05] he's here
[1:56:06] please ask please ask no cry out for it
[1:56:10] i'm here
[1:56:11] here's the word here's the spirit amen
[1:56:15] oh hallelujah i believe this with every
[1:56:17] fiber within my body
[1:56:19] so i'm either really crazy or really
[1:56:22] revelated
[1:56:23] you pick amen amen
[1:56:27] may god begin by his spirit to give us
[1:56:31] see i labored on this the other day so
[1:56:32] i'll try not to labor so long
[1:56:35] not some spotty thing it did not saints
[1:56:37] stop in 1965.
[1:56:41] god is revealing himself to his bride
[1:56:45] this very bride that was chosen and
[1:56:48] their names wrote in the lamb's book of
[1:56:50] life
[1:56:50] before the foundation of the world god's
[1:56:53] word is
[1:56:54] revelating them with life-giving and
[1:56:57] prevailing
[1:56:58] revelation and if the church could only
[1:57:00] get fresh revelation
[1:57:04] amen you know what that is
[1:57:07] some of you don't like this you go study
[1:57:10] that out
[1:57:11] the antonym fresh or stale
[1:57:18] oh that makes some people a plain upset
[1:57:20] like yo you are just
[1:57:21] almost but look
[1:57:25] god don't want you to live on
[1:57:26] yesterday's manna
[1:57:28] hallelujah fresh manna every single day
[1:57:33] and become by it the living word
[1:57:35] manifested oh look at this saints come
[1:57:37] on
[1:57:38] what is this the word revealing the word
[1:57:41] and so by it the living word so if we
[1:57:44] have him
[1:57:46] we can never become stale we cannot
[1:57:49] we cannot wither away we cannot come to
[1:57:51] the place that the revelation has
[1:57:53] drifted into nothing
[1:57:56] amen hallelujah i'll tell you what the
[1:57:59] difference is between this bride of
[1:58:00] christ and the prophet of god said this
[1:58:02] bride will
[1:58:03] never ever become a denomination you
[1:58:05] know what the difference is
[1:58:06] we look at it like well okay this says
[1:58:08] no what it is my brother and sister
[1:58:10] there's a difference in the nature of
[1:58:12] the people
[1:58:14] some are willing to take
[1:58:17] this oh pardon me for saying it this way
[1:58:20] i don't know another word
[1:58:23] ah lord check me i'm not going to put it
[1:58:25] out there that way
[1:58:26] they're going to take this here but
[1:58:28] there's some over here
[1:58:30] says i need it fresh lord your word says
[1:58:34] your mercies are new every morning your
[1:58:36] mercies are new every morning lord i
[1:58:38] need it fresh this morning
[1:58:40] you see i'm not able to live on last two
[1:58:42] weeks last month's last year
[1:58:44] last decade last decades that's right
[1:58:48] lord i need it fresh i don't know saints
[1:58:51] am i misreading this
[1:58:54] if i am forgive me i would never do it
[1:58:57] intentionally but you see god didn't
[1:58:58] intend for us to look backwards
[1:59:00] no the prophet of god's own words you
[1:59:02] know this is something pardon me time is
[1:59:03] fleeting but
[1:59:04] pardon me saints look at this the
[1:59:06] prophet of god himself instills us
[1:59:08] writing the message
[1:59:10] he tells us don't look in that rearview
[1:59:11] mirror if you look in the rearview
[1:59:14] mirror you
[1:59:14] are sure to crash
[1:59:18] but that was something different was it
[1:59:21] no no i think it applies right here
[1:59:23] saints amen
[1:59:25] do we deny history you know i don't know
[1:59:28] who wrote it there's a quote says you
[1:59:30] know for those who
[1:59:31] refuse to acknowledge history or
[1:59:32] something they're doomed to repeat it
[1:59:36] i acknowledge it in the same fashion
[1:59:40] that i acknowledge i was a sinner saved
[1:59:41] by grace but wait my name was in the
[1:59:43] lamb's book of life
[1:59:45] what was it i skipped over that and we
[1:59:47] will skip over that today
[1:59:49] the prophet of god says that revealing
[1:59:51] of the word
[1:59:52] is the washing that's it it's a washing
[1:59:55] of the water of the word
[1:59:57] and i'm telling you
[2:00:00] you're never going to find a bowl of the
[2:00:03] northern
[2:00:04] province of the ling dynasty
[2:00:08] and see what it is if you don't wash it
[2:00:12] and this bride of christ will never be
[2:00:13] revealed in this
[2:00:15] 21st century for who she is
[2:00:18] until she comes under that washing of
[2:00:20] the word
[2:00:22] and the more that the word brother brown
[2:00:23] says that washing of the word is hearing
[2:00:26] the word preached amen
[2:00:29] the preaching of the word amen amen
[2:00:32] wow what is it washing
[2:00:35] amen it's washing you and i now look at
[2:00:38] this we're already i'm closing sister
[2:00:40] emmy will you come
[2:00:41] amen oh you see my brother and sister
[2:00:45] it's that washing of the word some
[2:00:47] people say well okay praise the lord
[2:00:48] i've been washed for the word and now
[2:00:50] god sees me
[2:00:51] no no no no god knew what you were in
[2:00:53] the beginning
[2:00:54] right all the way back to the lamb's
[2:00:56] book of life god knew what you was this
[2:00:58] washing of the water
[2:00:59] is revealing who you are to you
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:04] it's revealing to you who you are
[2:01:07] now take this over here to the prophet
[2:01:09] of god's words
[2:01:10] and he says when the bride sees who she
[2:01:13] is
[2:01:14] she will become an invincible army
[2:01:18] not how many books and tapes she's
[2:01:20] listened to not how many books she
[2:01:22] possesses
[2:01:23] but it's when she sees who she is
[2:01:26] oh hallelujah are you with me today the
[2:01:29] water
[2:01:30] of the word washing us what is it
[2:01:33] the word revealing the word
[2:01:37] hallelujah and in that we start to see
[2:01:40] who we
[2:01:41] are and we no longer are tossed by every
[2:01:43] temptus we're not
[2:01:44] tossed to and fro every wind of doctrine
[2:01:48] amen hallelujah oh hallelujah
[2:01:52] oh my god i i just got to stop i just
[2:01:56] got way too much stuff left
[2:01:58] hallelujah aren't you glad the words
[2:02:00] being revealed
[2:02:01] amen aren't you glad that the holy ghost
[2:02:04] the word coming down
[2:02:05] is taking all the little isms and
[2:02:07] schisms and all these little
[2:02:09] concepts and just washing them away
[2:02:12] hallelujah

[2:02:25] i've had people tell me well it's just a
[2:02:26] cesspool
[2:02:28] well i'm here to tell you there's plenty
[2:02:30] of places there that you can get off and
[2:02:32] jerry and i've walked a beach before for
[2:02:35] i felt like miles i don't know how long
[2:02:37] it was
[2:02:38] run into two or three people and they
[2:02:39] were people our age
[2:02:41] dressed decent just out enjoying it
[2:02:46] go there's sure enough cesspool's there
[2:02:49] but you know what i noticed i've never
[2:02:50] really voiced this before i don't even
[2:02:52] know if i voiced its
[2:02:53] sister jerry a little revelation the
[2:02:55] lord struck on my heart one day
[2:02:56] i'm walking down the beach
[2:03:01] there's just all kinds of stuff washed
[2:03:03] up on the beach
[2:03:05] trash

[2:03:10] places there's nothing
[2:03:12] you start paying attention you see my
[2:03:16] brother and sister
[2:03:18] this part it's washing it away
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:25] but there are those that all of life
[2:03:29] just brings the trash to them
[2:03:32] and there's those that it washes it away
[2:03:34] from them
[2:03:36] now that sounds simple enough i'm not
[2:03:38] trying to make a big deal it's just
[2:03:39] something that struck my heart i thought
[2:03:40] look at this every day be out there
[2:03:43] snorkeling
[2:03:44] swimming with the turtles and you just
[2:03:46] recognize
[2:03:48] this big chunk of rock that's out there
[2:03:50] the waves splashing over
[2:03:52] on the south side of that is all the
[2:03:54] trash
[2:03:56] on this side it's clean
[2:04:00] you see we're gonna choose which side
[2:04:02] the rock we swim on
[2:04:04] we're gonna choose which place we want
[2:04:06] to dwell
[2:04:07] but you see the word of god to the bride
[2:04:10] of christ
[2:04:11] is washing her he's washing it away
[2:04:15] he's revealing who she is and i believe
[2:04:18] with all my heart that's what the
[2:04:19] prophet was meaning when he said
[2:04:21] when the bride sees who she is you see
[2:04:25] i wasn't called to have a lot of trash
[2:04:26] washed into my life i was called to have
[2:04:28] it washed away
[2:04:30] and that's what i want to look to and
[2:04:33] when i go to prove the word some people
[2:04:35] will say well prove you're in the bride
[2:04:36] i'm sorry i can't i have no
[2:04:40] literal tangible evidence to lay on a
