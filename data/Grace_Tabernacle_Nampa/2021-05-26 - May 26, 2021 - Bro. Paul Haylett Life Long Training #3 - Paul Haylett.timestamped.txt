[33:48] so tonight i hope you kind of brought a
[33:50] sense of humor with you
[33:53] just a little bit of the scripture
[33:55] tonight struck me
[33:57] in a humorous fashion and i hope you
[34:00] don't find it offensive as i express
[34:02] that
[34:03] amen we'll be taking our our thought
[34:06] tonight
[34:07] um once again lifelong training we'll be
[34:09] taking that from
[34:11] uh proverbs the 23rd chapter verses
[34:14] one through five and uh just to uh
[34:17] look at the wisdom god bless you thank
[34:20] you so much this evening
[34:22] the wisdom that has contained has been
[34:25] contained
[34:26] through the generations in the scripture
[34:28] that we could
[34:30] take in this day to use for
[34:34] our benefit amen uh don't you like it
[34:36] when you can garner something of wisdom
[34:39] that
[34:39] that is directly beneficial to your life
[34:42] and
[34:42] uh that's always a beautiful thing amen
[34:45] so for those that are not with us
[34:47] tonight i know our
[34:48] brother tim uh always has to get up in
[34:52] the
[34:52] wee hours is how i view it of the
[34:55] morning
[34:55] to go to work brother david's sister and
[34:58] i and sister ruth
[34:59] are i believe in ohio or somewhere in
[35:03] that vicinity
[35:04] um i think brother sergey is and sister
[35:07] yulia and the family are
[35:09] visiting family uh so we just want to
[35:12] each one to list everyone but to
[35:15] each one remember them in prayer amen
[35:19] you know our
[35:23] sister kerry is helping mason as you
[35:26] would
[35:28] fulfill his desire to be a lacrosse
[35:31] player and
[35:32] to do well with that and and uh
[35:35] these are some of the things we get to
[35:36] enjoy in life so we
[35:38] just want to uh remember each and every
[35:41] one
[35:42] let's stand as we go to proverbs the
[35:44] 23rd chapter
[35:46] and uh we'll just look at these verses
[35:48] right here
[35:49] uh and uh we'll draw a little thought
[35:52] tonight
[35:53] uh from the first five verses
[35:56] of the 23rd chapter when thou
[36:00] sittest to eat with a ruler
[36:03] consider diligently what is before thee
[36:08] and put a knife to thy throat if thou be
[36:11] a man given
[36:12] to appetite be not
[36:15] desirous of his dainties for they are
[36:18] deceitful meat
[36:20] labor not to be rich cease from thine
[36:24] own wisdom well thou set on eyes upon
[36:27] that which is not
[36:29] for riches certainly make themselves
[36:32] wings
[36:32] they fly away as an eagle toward
[36:36] heaven heavenly father we just ask you
[36:38] to be with us tonight
[36:40] as we just take these thoughts from the
[36:43] book of proverbs these
[36:44] gems of wisdom and lord just look at
[36:47] them tonight and
[36:49] use them father to help us as we press
[36:52] forward in this life lord to know that
[36:55] every
[36:56] thing that would be placed before us in
[36:59] the natural
[37:00] father in the spiritual lord you have
[37:03] ordained for sons and daughters of god
[37:05] to use these for their benefit
[37:08] and father you have certainly sealed us
[37:11] according to the word
[37:13] uh lord you have sealed us father uh to
[37:16] the day of our redemption
[37:18] lord so knowing that whatever factors
[37:20] whatever things take place
[37:22] in the world around us father you have
[37:25] already
[37:25] made the way through it for us and we
[37:28] say thank you tonight
[37:30] lord just ask for your blessings upon
[37:32] the word upon the saints in your
[37:33] precious name we pray
[37:35] amen you may be seated saints on
[37:39] i think you probably kind of saw what i
[37:41] was talking about just a little bit of
[37:43] humor there but
[37:44] you know you would think about this i
[37:46] think in a way it would apply to
[37:48] any house that we might go to but
[37:52] we consider diligently what is before
[37:55] us before thee you know and i think it
[37:58] would apply to every house but
[38:00] here it says in the scripture when thou
[38:01] sittest with a ruler
[38:03] someone important uh you know consider
[38:06] diligently what is before thee and uh
[38:09] you know there's a phrase that says if
[38:11] it's too good to be true it probably is
[38:14] and
[38:14] sometimes we have seen through history
[38:16] we've seen the times
[38:18] we see in the first and second church
[38:21] ages how
[38:22] that they directly courted the
[38:24] christians to pull them
[38:26] into an alliance with them because
[38:29] they're trying to unite their kingdoms
[38:30] and
[38:31] so they had feasts and they had all
[38:33] kinds of things and
[38:34] we see men like constantine realize if i
[38:37] can
[38:38] pull the christians in and get their uh
[38:41] their allegiance and make them feel
[38:44] welcome then it will make my job much
[38:47] easier and yet the christians as brother
[38:49] branham says in the church age book
[38:51] they went and they had no business being
[38:54] there
[38:55] and so it was that they were in the
[38:57] midst of the kings and
[38:59] and rulers and it was there and you know
[39:01] they should have considered what was
[39:03] before them and you know the scripture
[39:06] here
[39:06] kind of gives us the idea that it's you
[39:09] sitting there with the ruler of what
[39:12] kind of food or whatever is given before
[39:14] you
[39:14] but i believe we can with uh with good
[39:17] diligence stretch this
[39:19] to what is the purpose why are we
[39:22] here at this table why are we here
[39:25] in this atmosphere and the scripture
[39:28] tells us that uh what fellowship does
[39:30] light have with darkness and we know
[39:32] that satan often times would
[39:35] try to woo in a certain fashion now my
[39:38] brother and sister
[39:39] we know also as the prophet gives uh a a
[39:43] little emphasis to that uh to bring us
[39:45] to the place to understand
[39:47] that sin will always take us further
[39:50] than we
[39:51] intended to go and so we'll see how that
[39:55] that uh time comes brother brown
[39:57] speaking there
[39:58] uh how that you would go and and because
[40:01] you're trying to
[40:02] please the host that uh maybe you would
[40:05] agree or
[40:06] do things that you would not have
[40:07] normally done and
[40:09] so i think when you sit down to eat with
[40:12] the ruler
[40:13] yeah sit down to do that that we should
[40:16] diligently look at what is before us
[40:19] not just simply in the realm as it were
[40:21] of the food but
[40:22] why are we here and what is the motive
[40:25] and
[40:26] and why did i accept this and you know
[40:28] sometimes my brother and sister once
[40:30] again
[40:31] taking some other thoughts from the
[40:33] message
[40:34] sometimes we go into something believing
[40:37] that we are the influencer
[40:39] only to find out when it's finished that
[40:42] we are the one
[40:43] that has been influenced and so we have
[40:46] to be really careful to understand
[40:48] why we are there and why people maybe
[40:51] want to be
[40:52] your friend so so to such a degree
[40:55] amen so you look at this and now i want
[40:58] to just kind of step into what i
[41:00] consider a
[41:01] little humorous part of this and
[41:04] i don't know maybe my humor is warped if
[41:06] it is forgive me but
[41:08] you know uh and put a knife to thy
[41:11] throat if thou be a man given to
[41:13] appetite and
[41:14] brother jason and i were joking in the
[41:16] back room just a little bit the guy that
[41:18] sits down at the king's table the
[41:20] ruler's table
[41:21] and he's just shoveling it in could i
[41:22] have some more send some more
[41:24] scraping the platters clean you know not
[41:27] a very good image
[41:28] amen to do that so you know it's telling
[41:32] here
[41:32] hold the knife uh put the knife to thy
[41:35] throat not someone else
[41:37] doing it but you literally causing your
[41:39] own self
[41:41] to have some form of decorum you know
[41:44] and uh you know oftentimes uh
[41:46] uh it is that it's hard somebody
[41:50] i mean let's face it i don't want to
[41:53] embarrass anybody but
[41:54] you know somebody makes a good apple pie
[41:57] and oftentimes there are fellowships
[41:58] there's two different sisters make two
[42:00] apple pies and
[42:01] and uh they're they're different from
[42:03] each other but they're both
[42:04] good and so i feel obligated to make
[42:07] sure that neither one of them is
[42:08] offended
[42:09] uh that there would be any of their pie
[42:11] left and so
[42:12] you know you have to be careful because
[42:14] then people are like uh you're eating
[42:16] another piece and
[42:17] it gives an image that you're kind of
[42:19] welcome can i use the terms that brother
[42:21] jason and i was using
[42:22] it gives the the idea or the image that
[42:25] you're a pig
[42:28] you know and and that's not a good image
[42:30] that's not something we want so
[42:32] you know it's kind of uh showing us here
[42:35] that
[42:35] you know if you're a man of appetite
[42:37] that's fine you know
[42:39] maybe stop as it were just forgive me
[42:41] this is a different age but
[42:43] stop it you know at burger king or
[42:46] wendy's or mcdonald's on your way home
[42:48] if you're still hungry but don't make a
[42:50] pig out of yourself don't
[42:52] don't you know leave that image and it
[42:55] says be not desirous
[42:56] of his dainties for they are deceitful
[43:00] meat and you know there's there's many
[43:03] times my brother and sister i won't go
[43:05] into it tonight
[43:06] but i have been in a situation i guess
[43:08] maybe why this resonates with me i've
[43:10] been in a situation before
[43:12] where someone was if you'd use the term
[43:15] that is
[43:15] common in the world someone was intent
[43:18] on whining
[43:19] and dining me and the real truth behind
[43:22] it was
[43:23] they wanted something from me
[43:26] and they wanted me to to come to a place
[43:30] and it's funny that sometimes what they
[43:34] want from you
[43:35] is not an object it is not money
[43:39] but they want to hear their point of
[43:42] view
[43:43] coming from your mouth
[43:48] think about it and they're willing to go
[43:51] to a great effort
[43:52] to whine and dine to get you to come as
[43:55] it were to their
[43:57] point of view so
[44:00] we look now and and this is kind of a
[44:02] little bit more where the
[44:03] direction of our fought tonight will be
[44:06] going
[44:07] labor not to be rich cease from thine
[44:10] own wisdom
[44:12] will thou set on eyes upon that which is
[44:15] not
[44:15] for riches certainly make themselves
[44:18] wings and they fly away
[44:19] as an eagle toward heaven
[44:22] and you know we live in a world that
[44:25] everything's focused the markets
[44:27] up real estate values are up uh all
[44:30] these kind of things
[44:31] promoting promoting promoting it's all
[44:33] about uh the money it's all about
[44:36] what uh it is there and i have a friend
[44:39] his in-laws
[44:42] on a very strategic piece of property
[44:46] and not very long ago people come and
[44:48] said we're gonna offer you just a
[44:49] ridiculous amount of money a 1.85
[44:52] million
[44:53] and they said nope this is our home has
[44:55] been for 40 some years
[44:57] we're not moving and the same real
[44:59] estate lady come back four or five days
[45:01] later and said
[45:02] uh my principals have said they'll offer
[45:05] you 2.2
[45:06] for it someone else a whole different
[45:09] person comes and says we'll give you 3.1
[45:12] the last news is it's 5 million but yet
[45:16] the man is looking at where his family
[45:19] has been
[45:19] all these years and he has a degree of
[45:23] security i guess in his retirement
[45:25] and these people are flabbergasted that
[45:27] he is turning down
[45:28] five million dollars for 21 acres of
[45:31] land
[45:32] and so you know there they can't
[45:34] comprehend because to them
[45:35] there's no way you can resist something
[45:38] like that
[45:39] but you see the money didn't mean
[45:41] anything to him and
[45:42] brother branham says in the message
[45:44] believe us thou this
[45:46] he said i never desired to be rich
[45:49] i've i believe solomon i believe had the
[45:51] most level prayer to god that i ever
[45:54] heard
[45:54] he prayed that god wouldn't make him so
[45:56] rich that he would forget
[45:58] god and yet not to make him so poor that
[46:01] he would have to steal
[46:03] so just the comforts of life is what we
[46:06] desire
[46:07] is that right that's about where the
[46:09] most of us stand i guess and very
[46:12] fortunate
[46:13] and thankful to have that and now this
[46:16] is a prophet's word so when people
[46:17] sometimes get all nervous you
[46:19] you know message believers we don't talk
[46:21] about money we don't talk about
[46:22] successes we don't do this because
[46:24] somehow it sounds carnal
[46:26] but here's the prophet of god kind of
[46:28] dealing directly with that
[46:30] and laying this down you know what we
[46:32] don't want to be rich enough
[46:33] that we somehow start to forget that god
[46:36] is our provider
[46:37] and we don't want to come down into a
[46:39] wretched state where we would be tempted
[46:41] to
[46:42] to take something that was not ours and
[46:44] you know i remember as a young man
[46:46] uh that i used to change sprinkler pipe
[46:49] on a farm next door to an orchard
[46:51] and now as a young man i did not give it
[46:53] uh one
[46:54] thought to to walk out into the orchard
[46:57] in the season
[46:58] and pick an apple and eat it but one day
[47:01] we were there changing sprinkler pipe
[47:03] and here's these apples and
[47:05] i picked an apple and i'm munching on it
[47:07] when the manager of the orchard drives
[47:09] up and he gets out and he's angry
[47:12] and he says you know paul haylett
[47:15] because he knew my family paul haylet do
[47:17] you know you are a thief
[47:20] and it was then that the light turned on
[47:22] up to that point i never thought that i
[47:23] was stealing from them
[47:25] but see from his perspective i was
[47:28] stealing something of value
[47:30] from them and so we look at this
[47:33] sometimes and we just want to find the
[47:35] balance of perspective
[47:37] and i like this as brother branham says
[47:39] you know uh that he
[47:41] felt like this was the most level prayer
[47:43] to god that he ever heard
[47:46] how he's balancing this out lord i'd
[47:48] just like to have
[47:49] a little comfort in my life
[47:52] just a little security to enjoy some
[47:55] good things in our life and
[47:56] i believe we can say amen tonight can we
[47:59] not that
[48:00] we we don't we don't need to be
[48:01] fabulously rich we don't need to be
[48:03] caught up in all of these things
[48:05] but to be able to how now most of the
[48:08] time my brother and sister
[48:10] when we talk about the comforts of life
[48:12] cares of life
[48:13] it's often preached in kind of a
[48:15] negative connotation right
[48:17] the cares of life the comforts of life
[48:19] are going to distract you from serving
[48:21] god
[48:22] but yet i would like to just present a
[48:25] balanced
[48:25] thought to you tonight that uh god's
[48:28] okay i believe god's
[48:30] just fine with you finding a comfortable
[48:33] level in life but we just hold that old
[48:35] motto
[48:36] seek ye first the kingdom of god this
[48:38] scripture let it resonate with us
[48:40] seek ye first the kingdom if the good
[48:44] things of life come and life gets
[48:45] comfortable
[48:46] don't become so comfortable that the
[48:49] spirit of laodicea
[48:50] overtakes you amen hallelujah
[48:54] it's possible saints people can get so
[48:57] caught up in that
[48:58] amen now as we look at this we'll find
[49:02] now
[49:02] in first timothy 6 5 we'll find now i'm
[49:06] going to just kind of take the first
[49:08] scripture
[49:08] and we're going to jump out of it into a
[49:12] quote
[49:12] and we'll come back perverse disputings
[49:16] of men
[49:16] of corrupt minds and destitute of truth
[49:19] in other words
[49:20] absolutely absent of truth supposing
[49:24] that gain is godliness from such
[49:27] withdraw thyself so when people start to
[49:31] look at this and believe that a natural
[49:33] success denotes some kind of a upper
[49:36] spiritual position a elevated spiritual
[49:40] position
[49:40] the prophet of god says right here in
[49:43] the message
[49:44] presuming he said in kingston jamaica
[49:47] at the racetrack last year where the
[49:49] lord was blessing
[49:51] they had a pentecostal minister there
[49:53] and i was with the christian businessman
[49:56] and i said we had from cuba from haiti
[49:59] from the islands around
[50:00] business and been sitting there last
[50:03] night
[50:04] and what did you fellows i said i'm
[50:06] ashamed of you
[50:08] now you've got to catch this because i'm
[50:10] i'm not going to go into the whole
[50:12] discourse
[50:12] but brother branham's talking about that
[50:14] there was a pentecostal minister
[50:17] there with him at the moment that he's
[50:19] talking about this
[50:21] and he's he's he's speaking to him as it
[50:24] were
[50:24] speaking to that man i'm ashamed of you
[50:27] what did you talk about
[50:29] a fleet of cadillacs i was a little
[50:32] bitty fellow in business down in the
[50:34] glory glory to god this is what he's
[50:36] recounting how their story would be
[50:38] i was a little bitty fellow in business
[50:40] down on the corner glory to god
[50:41] hallelujah
[50:42] the lord gave me this and the lord
[50:44] blessed this and the lord blessed that
[50:46] i said them men sat and looked at one
[50:48] another and i said i've been with you
[50:49] long enough
[50:50] till you know i knew their hearts the
[50:53] lord let me know it i seen what they was
[50:55] thinking about
[50:56] what are you telling them they belong to
[50:59] these big
[51:00] formal morgues
[51:04] we know he's talking about churches
[51:08] and they're prosperous they're
[51:10] billionaires
[51:12] i said how different you are
[51:16] always bragging about what you got and
[51:19] how much you accumulated
[51:21] in this much time how different it is
[51:24] from the original pentecost they sold
[51:26] everything they had and give to the poor
[51:29] i said you vice versa it
[51:32] them people knows all about what it
[51:34] means to be rich
[51:36] they want to find something that
[51:38] satisfies
[51:39] and got some life in it now if you go
[51:42] into the message presuming and go on
[51:45] this pentecostal uh preacher is telling
[51:48] brother branham that he was wrong
[51:50] that selling all that had and giving to
[51:52] the poor
[51:53] was a mistake because he says you know
[51:56] then when there come a little contention
[51:58] talking about whether it's of the holy
[51:59] ghost or not
[52:00] come a little contention he says they
[52:02] didn't even have a house to go back to
[52:04] and that was a mistake and brother
[52:06] braham says no that's what god wanted he
[52:08] wanted them to then go
[52:10] and disperse and preach the gospel to
[52:12] the world
[52:13] not go back home and shelter themselves
[52:15] in that house
[52:17] and then the talk about the fussing and
[52:19] the fightings
[52:20] but to go and i i encourage you to go
[52:22] read that
[52:23] now when you look at that my brother and
[52:25] sister the prophet of god
[52:27] is upset because they have come to this
[52:30] place
[52:31] that really instead of talking about the
[52:34] word of god
[52:35] they were there talking about their
[52:37] accomplishment talking about how big
[52:39] their church was
[52:40] how many people what they have and we
[52:42] can certainly look
[52:44] in the world today and you can see how
[52:47] that this prosperity gospel has come
[52:50] what they're doing the scripture says
[52:52] they're tickling
[52:53] the ears of the people they're not
[52:56] telling them the truth they're telling
[52:58] the people
[52:58] what the people want to hear but the
[53:01] underlying motive
[53:02] is they want to build up something that
[53:05] would then
[53:06] support or do what they would want in
[53:08] their style
[53:10] so we'll see how it is supposing that
[53:13] gain is godliness
[53:15] right here the scripture says from such
[53:19] withdraw thyself
[53:23] when people promote the size of the
[53:24] church the economics of the church
[53:27] the wealth of the church when they start
[53:29] to promote those things the scripture
[53:31] is telling us withdrawal from that pull
[53:34] back from
[53:35] those things because that is not how we
[53:38] measure
[53:38] godliness amen so we look at this now
[53:42] we'll go back to
[53:43] the scriptures verse six amen
[53:47] and it says but godliness with
[53:50] contentment
[53:52] is great gain it doesn't say contentment
[53:56] with a little bit of godliness
[53:57] but it's telling us godliness being the
[54:00] emphasis
[54:01] of this uh this uh uh sentence
[54:05] that uh we would come that if we are
[54:08] godly
[54:08] and we're content in our situation
[54:12] serving god there is what we would call
[54:14] great gain
[54:16] for we brought nothing into this world
[54:18] and it is certain
[54:19] we can carry nothing out you know
[54:22] there's always the humorous jokes about
[54:23] you i've never seen an armored car
[54:26] pulling a hearse it's just not how it
[54:29] works
[54:29] we don't get to take it in fact i
[54:32] remember a man that i know
[54:33] quite well and
[54:36] he he kind of condemned me a little bit
[54:40] or no not condemned convicted me a
[54:42] little bit
[54:44] he made a statement like this he says
[54:46] paul why do you work so hard and i said
[54:48] i don't know i guess i enjoy it
[54:50] and he goes you realize you're just
[54:52] going to die and leave that to your
[54:54] children
[54:56] and i thought yeah what am i doing
[55:00] my children oh i have a daughter here
[55:04] tonight
[55:06] children don't deserve it and he said
[55:08] that's right
[55:10] let them work for their own
[55:13] but i'm sorry i i do like to work i like
[55:16] to build i like to
[55:19] create things you know as it were put
[55:22] things together it's not really creating
[55:23] but
[55:24] put things together but we can see the
[55:27] point because
[55:29] we brought nothing into this world and
[55:30] it is certain we can carry nothing out
[55:33] and having food and raiment let us be
[55:36] there with content isn't it interesting
[55:40] in the day that we live in
[55:42] i get invitations on a very regular
[55:44] basis to go to
[55:46] motel up in boise to hear a speech
[55:50] on how that i could uh do this
[55:53] this and this they don't really reveal
[55:55] what that is but we have you know a
[55:57] five-step plan a 10-step plan
[55:59] that will make you fabulously wealthy a
[56:02] millionaire
[56:03] in six months now i wonder how many
[56:06] people go
[56:07] and buy all the books and buy all the
[56:09] literature and buy all of this stuff
[56:12] and the man who is doing this
[56:15] probably every six months gains another
[56:17] million
[56:19] because he's not really in the promotion
[56:22] business
[56:23] he's in the book business and that's
[56:26] what he's selling to people and
[56:28] they get caught up in the idea because
[56:30] you see there's something that grasps
[56:33] some people the idea
[56:36] of getting rich with no effort
[56:39] anti-scripture
[56:41] right going to sweat amen
[56:45] you're gonna live by the sweat of your
[56:47] brow you're gonna do this god
[56:48] never god never created the ponzi scheme
[56:51] god
[56:52] never put together all the get rich
[56:54] quick things
[56:55] god says you know what it's fine you
[56:57] guys just go and sweat
[56:58] and save and become stewards and and do
[57:01] all of this thing and and you will be
[57:03] all right you will find
[57:04] some comfort you will find this
[57:06] comfortable life
[57:08] so you look at this ma and there's kind
[57:10] of a reason right saints because you
[57:12] read the scripture
[57:13] amen but they that will be rich fall
[57:16] into temptation and to snare scripture
[57:20] tells us there'll be very few rich
[57:21] people make her to heaven
[57:23] but they that will be rich fall into
[57:25] temptation and a snare
[57:27] and into many foolish and hurtful lust
[57:30] which drown men in destruction and
[57:33] perdition
[57:34] so this isn't really much of a promotion
[57:36] for getting rich is it
[57:38] especially as a christian we're going to
[57:40] get rich we're going to fall go into
[57:41] perdition
[57:42] no sorry that's not what god called us
[57:44] to do amen
[57:46] for the love of money now it doesn't say
[57:48] that money is the root of all evil but
[57:50] the love of money is the root of all
[57:52] evil
[57:52] which while some coveted after they have
[57:55] erred from the faith so these
[57:57] weren't heathens that he's talking or
[57:59] referencing
[58:00] they have aired from the faith and
[58:02] pierced themselves through
[58:04] with many sorrows so it was inflicted
[58:08] by themselves or they brought themselves
[58:10] to that place to
[58:11] be inflicted with many sorrows
[58:14] now my brother and sister the word of
[58:16] god does not say
[58:17] that a rich man will not make it to
[58:19] heaven
[58:20] it just says it will be very difficult
[58:23] and very few
[58:24] will do it so if god blesses you
[58:28] you know if you're the guy who invents
[58:31] the widget
[58:32] and 10 million people buy a widget and
[58:34] you now have money
[58:36] just make sure that you put god first
[58:38] now you might say what's a widget
[58:39] brother paul
[58:40] it's whatever you want it to be amen
[58:43] but you know make sure we put god first
[58:46] you get a pay raise that changes your
[58:48] whole world
[58:49] you get something goes good you inherit
[58:52] money whatever it might be
[58:54] don't look at those things as hey this
[58:56] is a game changer for me
[58:58] just continue to serve god and hold on
[59:01] to the very principles that god laid
[59:03] in your life and the beginning and you
[59:06] will be blessed
[59:07] amen but now o man of god flee
[59:15] the word of god kind of putting a little
[59:18] roadblock to our process
[59:23] of pursuing wealth
[59:26] of getting rich of looking for an easy
[59:30] life
[59:32] hey don't look at me that way this is
[59:34] the scripture
[59:36] amen flee these things
[59:40] and follow after righteousness and
[59:42] godliness and faith and love and
[59:44] patience and meekness
[59:47] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[59:51] on eternal life whereunto thou are also
[59:54] called and has professed a good
[59:57] profession
[59:59] before many witnesses isn't that really
[1:00:01] our first and foremost that we are
[1:00:03] that we profess we are sons and
[1:00:05] daughters of god called before the
[1:00:06] foundation of the world
[1:00:08] let that be no matter what blessings
[1:00:10] come in your life
[1:00:11] in the natural let that be a spiritual
[1:00:14] blessing
[1:00:14] that we come that we fight that good
[1:00:16] fight of faith in other words always
[1:00:18] pressing in
[1:00:19] always seeking as it were the advantage
[1:00:21] of of the growing in our faith you know
[1:00:24] the apostle paul said
[1:00:25] i'm happy to see you growing in
[1:00:28] faith so we want to pursue that and lay
[1:00:31] hold on that
[1:00:32] and eternal life my brother and sister
[1:00:34] you know i was just reading some stuff
[1:00:36] and they're doing some research amongst
[1:00:38] christians and the numbers are falling
[1:00:42] amongst the people professing to be
[1:00:44] christians that actually believe there
[1:00:46] really
[1:00:47] is a heaven and really is a hell and so
[1:00:50] in that realm what it is is people are
[1:00:53] viewing as
[1:00:54] an encouragement these things are
[1:00:56] speaking as
[1:00:57] encouragements to living a good life
[1:01:00] and so my brother and sister as it is
[1:01:03] the devil
[1:01:03] is watering down all of the gospel to a
[1:01:07] place that people
[1:01:08] are not really seeing that their
[1:01:10] behavior has
[1:01:11] a dire consequence but i believe as sons
[1:01:14] and daughters of god we should look at
[1:01:16] this and say you know what
[1:01:17] i believe that we have a great reward
[1:01:20] eternal life and there is as it were
[1:01:23] dire consequence for
[1:01:25] not living the word of god and so we see
[1:01:28] how
[1:01:28] satan continues to water this down and
[1:01:31] uh the wealthier people are
[1:01:37] the less inclined they are to believe
[1:01:41] that they have to be obedient to the
[1:01:44] bible
[1:01:48] i think that might be why saints you
[1:01:49] know maybe
[1:01:51] by god's grace we could take some of you
[1:01:53] to places like south america
[1:01:57] where they don't have a lot of
[1:01:59] prosperity
[1:02:01] most of us would say wow
[1:02:04] believers really live like this this is
[1:02:07] really the
[1:02:07] circumstances they live in but you will
[1:02:10] see great faith
[1:02:12] i remember one time in paraguay a sister
[1:02:15] crying
[1:02:17] because she's embarrassed that sister
[1:02:19] jerry would come
[1:02:21] and surely sister jerry lived in a nice
[1:02:23] home and she would come into
[1:02:25] her home because her house was this just
[1:02:28] a little
[1:02:29] concrete deal with just wires run on the
[1:02:31] wall and
[1:02:32] nothing furniture very basic and the
[1:02:34] sister was a little embarrassed
[1:02:36] but you see my brother and sister by
[1:02:38] god's grace we don't view that that way
[1:02:40] we don't
[1:02:41] look at it and say oh these would be the
[1:02:43] ones we fellowship with because they
[1:02:45] have nice things
[1:02:46] and and these here don't have anything
[1:02:48] nice that so we we ignore them
[1:02:50] because as sons and daughters of god
[1:02:53] real believers of this message
[1:02:55] we are not looking at the possession
[1:02:57] we're not looking
[1:02:58] at the color or a texture or what of the
[1:03:01] cloth we're not looking at the fashion
[1:03:03] we're looking at the heart and the soul
[1:03:05] and the character of that individual
[1:03:07] and therefore we can worship with and we
[1:03:10] can
[1:03:10] and call friendship with and embrace
[1:03:13] those regardless of
[1:03:15] the place in life that they are because
[1:03:17] you see
[1:03:18] this message brings liberty and liberty
[1:03:21] isn't just something that is to the rich
[1:03:24] it is also
[1:03:25] to the poor because my brother and
[1:03:27] sister you can look in the world we live
[1:03:28] in today
[1:03:29] the prophet of god prophesied it and the
[1:03:31] things that are happening in the world
[1:03:33] today
[1:03:33] are proving it that we are becoming an
[1:03:36] increasingly
[1:03:37] neurotic people
[1:03:41] and there's a direct correlation people
[1:03:44] taking pills to get up
[1:03:45] the prophet of god spoke these things
[1:03:47] and pills to go to sleep
[1:03:49] a pill for this they have problems oh
[1:03:52] what is happening here
[1:03:53] this woman flirted with my husband at
[1:03:55] this party and this and that
[1:03:57] and our world and this is not perfect
[1:03:59] and i don't like that
[1:04:00] you see my brother and sister they live
[1:04:02] in another world that has a false
[1:04:04] reality
[1:04:04] but you take a son or daughter of god
[1:04:06] that does not have two nickels to rub
[1:04:08] together
[1:04:09] that is filled with the holy ghost and
[1:04:11] the word of god and the prophet bull
[1:04:13] declare him a rich man oh hallelujah
[1:04:18] and that is what we need to look for
[1:04:20] amen fight the good fight of faith lay
[1:04:22] hold
[1:04:23] on eternal life my brother and sister
[1:04:25] there's nothing i hate worse than
[1:04:27] shaking hands with a man
[1:04:28] that's got a limp wrist
[1:04:31] it just bothers me to no wind i i don't
[1:04:34] want to be rude but i i just like
[1:04:36] somebody
[1:04:37] just shake your hand they don't have to
[1:04:39] crush your hand
[1:04:40] and i don't want to crush theirs i'm the
[1:04:42] guy with the little hands i'm the one
[1:04:44] that usually gets my fingers pretzeled
[1:04:46] but my brother and sister you know
[1:04:48] there's just something but you know if
[1:04:50] you can't
[1:04:51] lay hold on eternal life
[1:04:55] not not some just patty cake i i
[1:04:58] i believe god sent a prophet i believe
[1:05:00] this and this is okay
[1:05:02] patty cake patty cake i want somebody
[1:05:04] that's going to stand up i want to see
[1:05:06] sons and daughters of god believers of
[1:05:09] the message of the hour
[1:05:10] stand up and say i am laying hold on
[1:05:13] eternal life
[1:05:14] you devil will not pry it out of my
[1:05:16] hands
[1:05:17] the cares of life won't pry it out of my
[1:05:19] hands no amount of money pride out of my
[1:05:21] hands
[1:05:21] no nothing's going to pride out of my
[1:05:23] hand i have laid
[1:05:25] hold on eternal life hallelujah
[1:05:30] and has professed a good profession
[1:05:32] before many witnesses
[1:05:33] now i don't want to get distracted but
[1:05:36] in my
[1:05:37] bible by my chair there i just been
[1:05:39] reading some very interesting scripture
[1:05:41] and in that you know some of those
[1:05:43] scriptures are talking about how we've
[1:05:45] been delivered
[1:05:46] from a bondage that satan would take us
[1:05:50] at his will aren't you glad that god can
[1:05:54] work in your life that the devil can't
[1:05:55] just decide to walk into your house
[1:05:57] tonight
[1:05:58] and say i'm going to disrupt disrupt
[1:06:00] their world i'm going to tear it apart
[1:06:02] i'm going to do this
[1:06:03] no he's been bound and he can no longer
[1:06:06] come
[1:06:06] at his will to take
[1:06:12] my saints come on somebody ought to be
[1:06:14] shouting hallelujah
[1:06:16] because you know that's just no
[1:06:17] different than the devil just coming in
[1:06:19] and you going and pulling your key ring
[1:06:21] out and say hey don't bother picking the
[1:06:23] lock don't bother kicking the door down
[1:06:25] i'll just give you the key we've not
[1:06:27] only took the key from him
[1:06:29] we have put the seal on the door of the
[1:06:32] holy ghost
[1:06:33] and he can't kick the door down he can't
[1:06:36] pick the lock
[1:06:37] he cannot do anything to get into this
[1:06:40] house
[1:06:41] hallelujah somebody ought to be saying
[1:06:44] thank you lord for that
[1:06:45] because i'm telling you my brother and
[1:06:47] sister what a game changer
[1:06:49] that is in our lives when satan then
[1:06:52] finds himself that he might still
[1:06:55] torment right job wasn't exempt
[1:06:57] but he will do this in such a fashion
[1:07:00] that in the end god will be glorified
[1:07:02] and that's what we're living for is to
[1:07:04] glorify the lord
[1:07:05] amen so you look at this and and we
[1:07:08] understand now
[1:07:09] my brother and sister this is something
[1:07:11] right here
[1:07:12] that i hope you follow me tonight are we
[1:07:15] doing okay
[1:07:16] amen i hope you follow me tonight
[1:07:18] because as these thoughts are unfolding
[1:07:20] to me
[1:07:20] i i just it struck me and and i thought
[1:07:23] you know praise the lord
[1:07:25] uh there's just something about us we're
[1:07:27] we're now
[1:07:28] let me just put it this way so we have
[1:07:30] clarity i've moved from
[1:07:32] whether you have riches or you're poor
[1:07:34] and and uh don't let riches deceive you
[1:07:36] i move from that from something worth
[1:07:38] fighting for
[1:07:39] amen now look at this quote here in the
[1:07:41] mighty conqueror
[1:07:42] brother branham says they said arnold
[1:07:45] von
[1:07:46] winkering what will you do
[1:07:50] now i want you to read this quote in a
[1:07:52] different context than just reading a
[1:07:54] quote
[1:07:54] can you put your name in there let me
[1:07:57] just put it this way
[1:07:58] they said paul daniel haylett
[1:08:02] what will you do
[1:08:08] and he turned towards the oncoming army
[1:08:11] he looked it all over he found where the
[1:08:13] darkest in the midst of the spears
[1:08:15] was right he wasn't out here saying now
[1:08:18] guys
[1:08:18] i'm going to go over here where there's
[1:08:20] a lone man over here and i'll fight with
[1:08:22] him while you guys go down here this man
[1:08:24] knew that was a difference had to be
[1:08:26] made maybe it was a difference
[1:08:28] in his family a difference in his church
[1:08:33] a difference in his nation
[1:08:36] he had a stick in his hand and he threw
[1:08:38] it down he said follow me
[1:08:40] and fight with all you've got could we
[1:08:43] personalize this tonight
[1:08:44] amen fight with all you've got with what
[1:08:47] you have to fight with
[1:08:49] and he threw away his stick through his
[1:08:51] hands in the air and screamed
[1:08:52] make way for liberty make way for
[1:08:56] liberty
[1:08:56] and as he rushed towards that great
[1:08:58] bunch of spears
[1:09:00] a hundred shining spears reaching out to
[1:09:02] pick him up
[1:09:03] and as he plunged into them he grabbed
[1:09:05] his arms out a whole arm full of them
[1:09:07] and threw them into his chest and
[1:09:09] screamed make way for liberty
[1:09:12] and such a display of heroism
[1:09:15] it rallied the army and those men
[1:09:23] those men behind followed with their
[1:09:25] sticks and clubs
[1:09:27] and they beat that army out of their
[1:09:29] land and they've never had a war since
[1:09:31] what was it
[1:09:32] because one man had the zeal and heroism
[1:09:36] about him to be a conqueror
[1:09:40] do we have anyone who wants to be a
[1:09:42] conqueror tonight amen our lord jesus
[1:09:45] you know brother branham goes on and
[1:09:47] talks about how our lord jesus come
[1:09:49] and he took everything my brother and
[1:09:51] sister not just something to make us
[1:09:53] feel good
[1:09:54] but he took everything into himself
[1:09:57] and found it in death and left it deaf
[1:10:00] hell in the grave
[1:10:02] left it uh powerless before you and i
[1:10:05] today
[1:10:05] and so there we are standing upon the
[1:10:08] word of god
[1:10:09] we have something worth fighting for
[1:10:11] would you agree with me tonight
[1:10:13] we don't have just some little washed
[1:10:14] out thing and we've just become message
[1:10:16] believers going to a message church
[1:10:18] quoting message quotes we have something
[1:10:22] worth fighting for and i'm going to lift
[1:10:23] a hand tonight and say lord give me the
[1:10:26] courage
[1:10:27] to be able to go and to declare
[1:10:30] and to shout to them make way for
[1:10:32] liberty
[1:10:33] grace tabernacle it's time for us to
[1:10:36] press in
[1:10:37] and face the enemy and make way for
[1:10:40] liberty
[1:10:41] in our household he is there brother
[1:10:43] branham in other quotes says you know
[1:10:45] he was their lovely little wife and them
[1:10:47] lovely little children
[1:10:49] and knowing that if they lost the war
[1:10:52] that that
[1:10:52] army would ravish their wives and take
[1:10:55] their children to be
[1:10:56] slaves and use them and he said he could
[1:10:59] not
[1:11:00] stand that he knew he had to make a
[1:11:03] difference
[1:11:06] brother paul just out on the limb
[1:11:08] tonight
[1:11:10] come on saints it's time for us to stand
[1:11:13] up and say you know what
[1:11:15] devil we're making room for liberty and
[1:11:17] grace tabernacle
[1:11:19] we're gonna not let this be uh and uh
[1:11:22] we're not looking as it were our wives
[1:11:24] being ravished but it would be the
[1:11:26] spirits of the age my brother and sister
[1:11:28] and to see that some people who profess
[1:11:31] to believe the same thing as you
[1:11:33] are no longer in the flesh their
[1:11:35] clothing their habits
[1:11:37] identifiable with the same standard you
[1:11:39] profess
[1:11:42] i'm not criticizing them but i'm telling
[1:11:44] you someone's going to stand up
[1:11:46] and make way for liberty someone's going
[1:11:48] to take and say you know what
[1:11:50] i can face the devil i can pray for that
[1:11:53] individual i can pray for this situation
[1:11:55] i can claim the victory i can profess
[1:11:58] this i can make the claim
[1:12:00] and have courage enough to stand up and
[1:12:02] say i am more than a conqueror
[1:12:05] amen this is not just a bunch of phony
[1:12:07] stuff my brother and sister
[1:12:09] we have this are are we real tonight i
[1:12:11] want you to pinch yourself
[1:12:13] everybody reach out pinch yourself are
[1:12:16] we real tonight
[1:12:17] i say we are real we have real problems
[1:12:20] in marriages and
[1:12:22] families and this and that and finances
[1:12:24] and whatever
[1:12:25] but none of that has anything to do
[1:12:27] whether the promise of god
[1:12:30] is true or not and it has nothing to do
[1:12:32] with whether you can have the courage to
[1:12:34] stand up and say i
[1:12:36] am more than a conqueror and i will
[1:12:38] pursue the enemy
[1:12:40] and i will make a way for a liberty
[1:12:43] in my life the lives of my family the
[1:12:45] lives of those in the church
[1:12:49] or he had a choice
[1:12:55] he could have just figured out what it
[1:12:56] would like be like
[1:12:59] to live in bondage
[1:13:06] we have that decision don't we
[1:13:10] i wouldn't make it for you
[1:13:13] you can decide bondage
[1:13:17] or liberty what do we want tonight
[1:13:20] saints
[1:13:22] hallelujah even was it patrick henry
[1:13:26] give me liberty or give me death
[1:13:29] lord either make us a victorious army or
[1:13:31] take us home
[1:13:33] i don't want to be around here a church
[1:13:35] that's whipped a church that's always
[1:13:36] like oh i'm not saying we are saints
[1:13:39] but i don't want us to be a church it's
[1:13:41] like oh whoa quote quote
[1:13:43] but nothing ever happening nothing ever
[1:13:46] powerful enough to shift the dynamics of
[1:13:49] the lives of the people in this church
[1:13:51] i say tonight that we make a vow to
[1:13:53] ourself i promote this to you tonight
[1:13:55] make a vow to yourself that you're going
[1:13:57] to be one that stands up and says
[1:13:59] make way for liberty make way for the
[1:14:02] holy ghost to move in the midst of our
[1:14:04] church
[1:14:04] make way for the power of god to answer
[1:14:06] prayers make way that our young people
[1:14:09] won't be just living on mom and dad's
[1:14:11] testimony but they will know
[1:14:13] god is real i say this so much so that i
[1:14:16] believe
[1:14:17] god take our young people to camp and
[1:14:19] make way for liberty that when they come
[1:14:21] home
[1:14:22] we'll look at them and say something
[1:14:23] happened to you
[1:14:25] not just all our team won the volleyball
[1:14:30] that can't be something more than our
[1:14:32] team did this and
[1:14:34] our team did that let it be a time that
[1:14:36] our young people would come home
[1:14:38] and say i got the holy ghost i know i
[1:14:41] got the holy ghost
[1:14:42] god move powerfully in our midst
[1:14:46] and then let them have a voice that
[1:14:48] comes and declares make way for liberty
[1:14:51] if another young person did not receive
[1:14:53] that we don't just sit back and say okay
[1:14:55] whatever
[1:14:56] we're going to take that and we are
[1:14:58] going to fight for that
[1:15:00] hallelujah amen
[1:15:06] colossians the first chapter
[1:15:12] and you that were sometimes alienated
[1:15:14] and enemies in your mind
[1:15:15] by wicked works yet now happy
[1:15:19] reconcile you know what that means
[1:15:22] there's a defeated enemy behind this an
[1:15:26] enemy that wanted to make you captive to
[1:15:28] bind you
[1:15:29] to keep you in as it were his service
[1:15:33] but it means he's conquered because
[1:15:35] you've been reconciled
[1:15:37] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:15:39] to present you holy
[1:15:40] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:15:43] sight
[1:15:46] if you continue in the faith grounded
[1:15:48] and settled and be not moved away from
[1:15:50] the hope of the gospel
[1:15:52] which ye have heard which was preached
[1:15:55] to every creature which is under
[1:15:57] heaven wherefore i paul have made a
[1:16:00] minister
[1:16:01] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[1:16:04] and philip that which is behind of the
[1:16:07] afflictions of christ
[1:16:09] in my flesh for his body's sake
[1:16:12] which is the church so paul is declaring
[1:16:16] i'm going through this great battle and
[1:16:18] i have sacrificed and given myself
[1:16:21] to this to be a benefit to the body
[1:16:24] believers
[1:16:25] i've done this not to be recognized as a
[1:16:28] great man
[1:16:28] but to lift up the body which is the
[1:16:31] church that's
[1:16:32] what he's doing he's telling us do your
[1:16:34] part
[1:16:37] arnold what are you going to do paul
[1:16:41] what are you going to do
[1:16:42] place your name in there what are you
[1:16:44] going to do we can choose to be another
[1:16:47] church in another
[1:16:48] city or we can choose to be the
[1:16:50] victorious church
[1:16:52] of jesus christ proclaiming victory
[1:16:56] to those who believe defeat is all
[1:16:58] they'll ever experience
[1:17:04] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:17:06] ages and from generation
[1:17:09] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:17:13] you know there's nothing more real about
[1:17:15] this scripture my brother and sister
[1:17:17] than to realize
[1:17:18] according to what the prophet of god
[1:17:20] preached in the seals and the breach and
[1:17:22] and we catch this down through the
[1:17:24] church age book that
[1:17:25] look at this this that has been hid from
[1:17:28] ages and from generations a prophet of
[1:17:30] god talking about
[1:17:31] messengers of every age how there was
[1:17:33] just a certain portion that was lotted
[1:17:35] to them and being revealed
[1:17:37] and it come and that was all they could
[1:17:39] express
[1:17:40] luther could not preach this message
[1:17:42] wesley could not preach
[1:17:44] this message wigglesworth and smith and
[1:17:46] all their mothers could not preach this
[1:17:48] message
[1:17:48] but it comes down that a prophet of god
[1:17:50] in his own words comes and says
[1:17:52] i didn't come with a new revelation i
[1:17:54] didn't come with new things
[1:17:55] i come to take all the loose ends
[1:17:58] and i come to bring them together and
[1:18:00] tie it all together for you
[1:18:02] what the mystery now being revealed had
[1:18:05] to have a loose end and loose in a loose
[1:18:07] end
[1:18:08] pulled together and expressed now in one
[1:18:11] great
[1:18:12] mystery but my brother and sister the
[1:18:14] mystery that remains is still a mystery
[1:18:16] but the word of god said that the
[1:18:17] mystery has been revealed
[1:18:19] amen hallelujah and this is not doctrine
[1:18:22] this is scripture
[1:18:23] amen amen to fulfill
[1:18:26] the word of god is what he says in verse
[1:18:28] 25 that's what it was all given
[1:18:31] to me for you to fulfill the word of god
[1:18:34] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:18:36] ages from generation
[1:18:38] now made manifest to his saints to whom
[1:18:40] god would make known
[1:18:43] what is the riches
[1:18:48] you know i'm a wealthy man amen
[1:18:52] i am so incredibly
[1:18:56] wealthy beyond
[1:18:59] even what this world can measure
[1:19:04] now if you want to think about this i
[1:19:07] know this might be a far-fetched but i
[1:19:08] just want to stir your minds
[1:19:10] the prophet of god talked about all
[1:19:13] those people elvis presley
[1:19:15] oh my all those other names you guys
[1:19:17] would remember the quotes
[1:19:19] and he said he s they sold
[1:19:23] their gift
[1:19:27] now look my brother and sister the world
[1:19:30] placed a value
[1:19:31] on the gift that god had given them
[1:19:35] the world didn't give him the gift
[1:19:39] do you know that the millions that elvis
[1:19:41] presley made
[1:19:43] was already would have been allotted to
[1:19:46] him if he had given it to christ
[1:19:48] he had the wealth but you see he
[1:19:52] couldn't stand to have his treasure laid
[1:19:54] up as the scripture says in heaven
[1:19:56] he wanted it laid up here
[1:20:01] so because he didn't keep his heart
[1:20:03] right didn't keep his heart
[1:20:04] washed and cleaned and committed soon
[1:20:07] the values of this natural life started
[1:20:10] to increase in his mind and
[1:20:12] he became willing to trade the gift of
[1:20:15] god
[1:20:16] for the revenue of the world
[1:20:20] and in the end my brother and sister we
[1:20:22] understand the story of elvis presley
[1:20:24] no doubt most of us have seen enough
[1:20:26] about that story to understand
[1:20:29] he died a man most miserable he died
[1:20:32] literally with no one he could say
[1:20:36] loved him and as far as many would know
[1:20:41] due to the circumstances of his last
[1:20:43] hours
[1:20:45] he might not even been able to say that
[1:20:47] god loved him
[1:20:49] my what it would be to trade all the
[1:20:51] things of this world
[1:20:54] all of this to measure the riches to be
[1:20:57] able to say
[1:20:58] god loves me i love him and
[1:21:02] he loves me and there's no other place
[1:21:05] that i would long to be but in his arms
[1:21:10] you see there's a great richness in the
[1:21:12] glory of this mystery
[1:21:14] among the gentiles which is christ and
[1:21:16] you
[1:21:17] the hope of glory there is so much more
[1:21:21] than silver or gold right there saints
[1:21:23] to know we stand upon the word of god
[1:21:25] and god is not only with us he is in us
[1:21:29] amen it is now i want you to think about
[1:21:32] that
[1:21:32] it is now revealed to us every day of
[1:21:36] our lives that goes by there's something
[1:21:38] more we see of this mystery
[1:21:40] unveiled to us but yet you know what we
[1:21:42] can put this in past tense can we not
[1:21:45] and say
[1:21:45] it has been revealed to us we are not
[1:21:48] coming to something that is just new
[1:21:50] and never seen before but god's been
[1:21:53] maturing
[1:21:54] as the apostle paul said i i'm thrilled
[1:21:56] this is a
[1:21:57] like a different version of it but i
[1:21:59] like it it says i am thrilled to see
[1:22:02] you growing quickly in faith
[1:22:08] not languishing not wondering is god
[1:22:10] real will god answer my
[1:22:12] prayers but growing quickly grasping
[1:22:15] hold and if you want a basis in
[1:22:17] scripture for that just go look at the
[1:22:18] parable of the 11th hour worker
[1:22:20] my brother and sister it didn't take him
[1:22:22] 40 years
[1:22:24] to have a faith that would rapture him
[1:22:26] god
[1:22:27] grew that faith in him quickly oh god
[1:22:29] help us
[1:22:30] god help us just to press forward amen
[1:22:34] hallelujah has been revealed to us the
[1:22:36] riches of the glory
[1:22:38] of this mystery sister emmy would you
