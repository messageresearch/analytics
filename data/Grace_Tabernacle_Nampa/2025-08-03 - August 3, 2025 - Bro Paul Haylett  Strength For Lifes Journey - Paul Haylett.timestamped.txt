[30:02] and hear the message. I don't mean you
[30:04] personally, I mean anyone else, but but
[30:07] um and maybe you did. I don't know. But
[30:10] um
[30:12] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[30:13] prayer. Glad to be here. Amen. Lord
[30:16] Jesus, we just release ourselves now to
[30:20] you, these few here. Lord, we just ask
[30:23] your blessing upon your word.
[30:26] Lord, as we've said before, for us to
[30:28] live as Christ, we haven't come here to
[30:30] meet anyone but you. And we will meet
[30:33] you, Lord. That's our expectation.
[30:36] We're expecting you to speak through
[30:37] mortal clay, the vocal cords of a man. I
[30:42] can't do that, Lord. I'm asking you to
[30:44] speak what David knows nothing about.
[30:48] But Lord, the revelation of this hour,
[30:50] the word for the season, I'm asking you
[30:52] to minister that word to our hearts
[30:54] tonight. As we're assembled here,
[30:57] gathered in your name, we know that you
[30:59] are here. That's all that matters. You
[31:01] are here. May our thoughts now lay be
[31:05] laid aside of today, the thoughts of
[31:07] tomorrow. And may you open our hearts to
[31:09] receive your engrafted word. your
[31:13] embodied word in your body, your bride.
[31:16] We pray for thy name and by thy name and
[31:19] for your glory and honor that we leave
[31:21] here raised to a higher plane in you. In
[31:25] Jesus Christ's name we pray and we give
[31:28] you praise because we believe that we
[31:30] receive what we ask for. Amen.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; If we believe we receive what we ask
[31:36] for, it'll be manifested. Amen. I'd like
[31:39] you to turn me to the book of Solomon,
[31:41] Song of Solomon. I'm going to this is my
[31:44] title tonight is the voice of our
[31:45] beloved or voice of my beloved mine
[31:48] meaning yours too personal the voice of
[31:52] my beloved and I wanted this is a part
[31:56] two I'm not going to try to say what we
[31:58] said Sunday if like I said I can't go
[32:01] back and preach that sermon again and
[32:02] then add to it so I just want to finish
[32:06] up what what has been written here I
[32:09] mean what has been spoken already and
[32:11] the Lord dropped back to this. So in
[32:14] verse chapter 2 of the Song of Solomon
[32:18] and we'll starting with verse 10,
[32:21] my beloved spake. We can take verse
[32:23] eight. The voice of my beloved, behold
[32:25] he cometh, leaping upon the mountain,
[32:28] skipping upon the hills. Verse 10, my
[32:30] beloved spake.
[32:32] Now we're talking about the voice. Now
[32:35] the Now the beloved is speaking his
[32:37] thought in a word. my beloved spake
[32:43] and said unto me, "Rise up." Who did he
[32:46] speak to? Is there any me here?
[32:48] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to you tonight.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to me tonight. Even though
[32:53] I I'm you I'm letting I'm I'm giving
[32:55] myself to him to use this vessel. He
[32:57] still speaks to me.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; I could say something right now. How I
[33:02] was caught up in that in my office way
[33:03] back many years ago. I'd read the
[33:05] message. First thing I' I was an
[33:06] insurance agent and I would read I would
[33:09] be in there to take the morning and
[33:10] reading the word and I was having a time
[33:12] of my life and I would read one one one
[33:15] part of it and and uh I mean the message
[33:18] book and and I would just oh my the
[33:20] revelation just strike me and I'd get up
[33:22] and I would preach to myself and I had a
[33:25] man come running in I had big windows
[33:27] you know farmers insurance group you
[33:28] know and come in he says he said are you
[33:30] okay is everything all right I said yes
[33:33] I'm having the time of my life.
[33:36] He said, "Well, well," he says, "Amen."
[33:40] He was my insured.
[33:44] So, yes, we can. God speaks right out of
[33:47] the fountain and the the artisian comes
[33:50] out, Brother David, and comes right back
[33:51] in again.
[33:53] That Amen. That's right. So, we just
[33:56] drink. It just keeps pressing out,
[33:58] doesn't it? Amen. So anyway, verse 10
[34:01] again, my beloved spake and said unto
[34:03] me, rise up. He's speaking to you
[34:05] tonight. Rise up, my love, my fair one,
[34:09] and come away.
[34:12] For lo, and I want you to notice now
[34:14] we're going to read. For lo, the winter
[34:15] is passed. Now watch how he's speaking
[34:18] here. Lo, the winter is passed. The rain
[34:22] is over and gone.
[34:24] There's a time period has passed by.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. We've been through seven
[34:30] ages and we come to the end of the
[34:31] seventh age and the and there's a
[34:33] message that turned the corner
[34:36] out of that
[34:39] into the things that were secret and
[34:41] held in the word, sealed in the word.
[34:43] Amen. So he said the the winter has
[34:46] passed, the rain is over and gone. The
[34:48] flowers appear. See another season.
[34:51] There's a turning of the corner here.
[34:53] The flowers appear on the earth. The
[34:55] time of the singing of birds has come.
[34:58] And the voice of the turtle, that's a
[35:00] turtle dove. The voice of the dove is
[35:03] heard in our land.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. The fig tree puteth
[35:10] forth her green figs. The vines with
[35:12] tender grapes give a good smell. Other
[35:15] words, the gra the vines got grapes. The
[35:18] birds are singing. They're building
[35:20] their nests. The spring has come. It's
[35:22] resurrection.
[35:26] But he but he's speaking. What is he
[35:28] speaking? The voice of the resurrection.
[35:31] Amen. He He speaks this. Rise up, my
[35:34] love. Rise. Isaiah 60. Rise. Shine for
[35:38] thy light is come and the glory of the
[35:41] Lord is risen upon thee. This message
[35:43] isn't some idea of a thought of a man.
[35:46] This is eternal life. This is the voice
[35:48] of your beloved.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; It's not just a some some idea some man
[35:57] presented to us. It's not a man's
[35:58] thought. The word of the Lord comes to
[36:01] his prophets. I the Lord will do nothing
[36:03] until I reveal my secrets to my
[36:05] servants, the prophets. So the prophet
[36:07] had the interpretation of the word for
[36:09] their day and hour. Amen. Is that right?
[36:12] It wasn't the prophet's mind. It was God
[36:14] speaking through that prophet. And if he
[36:16] speaks through that prophet, those that
[36:18] didn't hear the prophets in the past
[36:20] were not were lost.
[36:22] Amen. Is that right? Moses said, "God
[36:24] will raise up a prophet like unto me."
[36:26] And he that won't hear that prophet is
[36:28] rejected.
[36:30] So, it's nothing to take it lightly when
[36:32] the voice of God is spoken in our day
[36:34] for the going home of the bride. I don't
[36:37] know who she is, but it's our going home
[36:39] message. We're at the end. We've
[36:41] arrived.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; We see it in the earth. We see it in
[36:44] politics. We see it in Israel.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everywhere we turn, we see it. We
[36:49] see American pope now governing the
[36:51] government, moving the government,
[36:53] moving President Trump. He doesn't know
[36:56] what's influencing him. Amen. But he but
[36:59] it's happening. We're seeing it happen.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; And our time of departure is any day,
[37:04] any moment. Amen. All right. So the
[37:07] let's say it again now. So we our grapes
[37:11] are on the vine. The fig tree put forth
[37:13] her green figs. Other words, Israel's in
[37:15] her homeland. And she begins to bear
[37:18] fruit. The vines are on the tender
[37:20] grape. Gives a good smell. Arise, my
[37:21] love, my fair one, and come away. Why?
[37:25] Thy light is come. It's an awakening.
[37:29] Amen. The message of the hour is the
[37:31] awakening of the bride because in her is
[37:34] a mystery to be unveiled.
[37:38] Amen. You may be seated. I want you to
[37:40] turn with me to Revelations chapter 10.
[37:45] Now, we're going to speak. This is the
[37:47] voice of our beloved. This is the
[37:48] message. Revelations 10 is the message
[37:51] of the seventh angel.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[37:55] &gt;&gt; It is the message. We ought to listen to
[37:56] it then. Don't you think?
[37:58] &gt;&gt; His message was opened word. His message
[38:01] was our beloved speaking to us to rise.
[38:04] The time has come. I The mystery is
[38:06] being unveiled. And you Okay, I won't go
[38:09] that far because I'm going ahead of
[38:10] myself. Let's just back up here. All
[38:12] right. Now, so Revelations 10
[38:16] and verse 7, I'll get to it here. Okay.
[38:23] Now, we know that verse I'm just going
[38:26] to read verse 10, but I or seven, but I
[38:29] took a lot of this all the way down to
[38:31] verse four. We know that this message
[38:33] comes when there's time no longer time
[38:36] no longer delayed. This is the end. And
[38:38] the message that se the seal being
[38:40] opened is a is a sign that we've arrived
[38:43] at the end.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. How much longer this time? But
[38:48] there's not going to be another message.
[38:49] There not going to be another time. The
[38:51] bride is going home. She's got the
[38:53] message to be changed.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Rapture has been preached to her.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? Rapture has been
[39:02] preached to her. Amen. So what is the
[39:04] revelation of the rapture to you
[39:06] personally? is the substance of that
[39:07] body change.
[39:10] Brother Bam said the bride will be
[39:11] looking for the revelation of the
[39:13] rapture.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in the message.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; All right. So So we see here then and it
[39:20] comes in the end of the time. It comes
[39:22] in the end and and John the voice was
[39:25] uttered. The seven thunders uttered
[39:27] their voices.
[39:29] Seven mysteries uttered one mystery.
[39:32] Amen. Those are words of the prophet.
[39:34] I'll read in a minute. But seven
[39:36] mysteries uttered one mystery.
[39:40] Amen. So, so we see right here, John was
[39:43] about to write. He heard it at being a
[39:45] type of a bride, but he was commanded to
[39:47] seal up what he what he heard. Seal it
[39:50] up.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; But showing that the bride will receive
[39:53] it. It's coming down now in verse 107.
[39:56] But in the days of the voice of the
[39:57] seventh angel, this mystery,
[40:01] this mystery, when he shall begin to
[40:03] sound, the mystery of God. So what
[40:05] mystery is it? It's the mystery of God.
[40:08] The mystery of God should be finished.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Completed. Finished.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be completed.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; All right. To whom? Who the message is
[40:21] going to?
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. It should be completed
[40:27] as he hath declared to his servants the
[40:29] prophets. So the message sounded
[40:32] and he sounded the revelation.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; All can hear that sounding.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to that in a minute.
[40:42] But not everybody can receive or hear
[40:44] the sounding.
[40:47] Now that sounds like a contradiction,
[40:48] doesn't it? They hear it, but they don't
[40:50] hear it. You can hear it and still not
[40:52] receive the logos underneath what you
[40:55] hear,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; which is the word. We've covered that
[40:58] Sunday. I can't go back and cover that
[41:00] again. All right? Because and you know,
[41:03] and I can tell you right here what the
[41:05] logos is. Let me just read it to you
[41:07] real quick. We read it Sunday. But
[41:09] here's here's the definition, the
[41:11] prophet's definition
[41:13] of logos.
[41:19] He said he said the word logos which
[41:23] means the thought or concept has the
[41:27] double meaning of thought and speech.
[41:31] So what is the what is the what is the
[41:34] word the translation of the word in the
[41:35] beginning verse John 1:1 in the
[41:38] beginning was the logos
[41:41] &gt;&gt; God spoke his words the original seed
[41:43] was the word the thought spoken into
[41:45] word God's thought spoken is that right
[41:48] he created by his word
[41:51] &gt;&gt; amen because it was his thoughts
[41:53] expressed now where were you when the
[41:55] sons of God shouted for joy and and
[41:58] where were you you were we covered all
[42:00] that in the church age we you were in
[42:02] God's thought to begin with.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; See, you don't realize that you were in
[42:07] the thought of God. The thought of God
[42:08] being revealed in this hour.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Now, what is opened up under that is the
[42:13] mystery.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's only a certain people
[42:17] that can hear the voice
[42:19] &gt;&gt; under the voice.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Other words, there's only a certain
[42:22] people could they can read it. We all
[42:24] must read it. We all hear it. Yes.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; But there's only a certain ones that can
[42:28] receive it, understand it.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to show you scripturally
[42:33] where that is in just a moment.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; All right. So, the logos double meaning
[42:38] of thought and speech. Now, a thought
[42:40] expressed is a word or words. So, he
[42:43] expressed his thought in a word. The
[42:46] word was in the beginning was the word
[42:48] and the word was with God. How was it
[42:51] with God?
[42:53] Okay. So the word was with God and the
[42:55] word was God and the same was with God.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. So now that gives
[43:04] you I can't like I say I can't go on
[43:06] that because we covered that pretty
[43:08] thoroughly on Sunday.
[43:11] And so this thought of God, the concept
[43:13] of God was expressed in Jesus. He was
[43:16] the concept of God expressed. Where was
[43:19] it expressed? The Godhead bodily was
[43:22] expressed in one man. Amen.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; That man was virgin born. He didn't come
[43:26] by sex. He came by a spoken word.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; So his blood was pure and and the blood
[43:30] is sent for you and I to loose us.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; And so when it looses us and your faith
[43:36] rests in that finished work, then what
[43:38] is it? The loosing is complete and
[43:40] perfect. Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; But there's still some part of
[43:42] redemption still to happen. And that's
[43:44] when he comes forth as he and we'll find
[43:46] out in this day and claims what he had
[43:50] paid the price for. Amen. There you are.
[43:53] So, you're in that thought. You're in
[43:56] this word.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; You're written here, but it's a hidden
[43:58] mystery.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, if you if you're
[44:02] listening, you caught something right
[44:03] there. All right. So,
[44:07] we go back here and and to where we were
[44:11] here. And my subtitle to this tonight is
[44:13] this. Christ in you, the mystery of God
[44:16] revealed.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] Christ in you is the mystery of God.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Revealed,
[44:25] &gt;&gt; unveiled.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; And that's the secret.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the secret. What' the
[44:33] prophet say? The secret was the word,
[44:35] the logos, the word, the thought
[44:37] revealed is in the bride.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; She was to be the word living and in
[44:42] action.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. living and in action. Not just
[44:47] faith without works. Works and faith are
[44:49] husband and wife. They're together. She
[44:51] was the word living and in action.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; She's the word living and operative.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That for all the words back,
[45:02] brother David, for me to live is Christ
[45:03] and die is gain. So our ministry, our
[45:06] ministry that we hold is this
[45:08] revelation, this mystery unveiled.
[45:11] That's the bride's ministry. Will she
[45:13] have a ministry? a great ministry.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? She'll have a
[45:18] ministry. She see the voice this this
[45:21] revelation is now in the bride. Not
[45:24] another voice. The same voice. The
[45:25] spirit and the bride say come.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; So what the prophet said, the spirit
[45:31] said, the prophet said, what the spirit
[45:33] through the prophet said is what we say.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; We can't be someone different. We are
[45:40] him. And his glory he shared with us. He
[45:43] wouldn't share it with another, but he
[45:44] shared it with us because we're not
[45:46] another.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay. So, so we we go here
[45:51] now and and so we turn here and we turn
[45:54] to and we could go on 8 through nine and
[45:58] and the voice was take he bride the
[46:00] bride said give me the book.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[46:02] &gt;&gt; The voice was in the book. Give me the
[46:04] book. It's been unveiled. Give me the
[46:06] book. And it said take it. Eat it up.
[46:08] Okay. And then it said in verse 11, "And
[46:10] he said unto me, thou
[46:13] must prophesy again." Other words, I'll
[46:17] ride it this trail again. You must
[46:18] prophesy again.
[46:23] Prophesy again before many peoples,
[46:26] nations, and tongues, and kings. I don't
[46:29] know if it swept the world completely
[46:30] yet or not. I don't think so because
[46:32] Japan's still struggling over there,
[46:37] you see. So, uh, there's still seed to
[46:40] come in. Amen. We don't know when that
[46:42] last one comes in,
[46:44] &gt;&gt; but the last trump is sounded.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The last trump
[46:48] sounds." At the time of the angels
[46:49] giving, the last message. The last trump
[46:52] sounds.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; So, when is it going to end? When the
[46:56] last one recognizes her position in
[46:58] Christ.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; He doesn't take an immature bride. He
[47:02] takes a matured one.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So let's continue on here.
[47:09] And so we read Revelation 10:7. Let's go
[47:12] to Revelations 8:1. And so here's the
[47:15] message of the seventh angel. Here's the
[47:18] message that he brings. Prophet said
[47:20] feast the trumpets. The message of the
[47:22] seventh angel. Revelations 10 is the
[47:24] seventh seal.
[47:26] Amen. So we know that the seventh seal
[47:29] was revealed through those seals. It was
[47:31] the mystery.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Right? All right. So we come down here
[47:37] and we see here in verse 8 verse one and
[47:40] when he he who
[47:43] the lamb
[47:47] the lamb all right the lamb but what is
[47:49] he now what does he how's he coming now
[47:52] it's still the same person but now the
[47:55] lion
[47:55] &gt;&gt; that's right
[47:56] &gt;&gt; are you with me all right now the lion
[47:58] is voicing why because he voices at the
[48:01] end the lion the king and the king was
[48:03] sword was placed in the hand of his
[48:05] prophet. Brother Brandham said it like
[48:07] this and he said these mysteries are
[48:09] laying there and he said he put it he he
[48:11] sends it down puts it in the hands of
[48:13] the seventh angel and he said there it
[48:16] is to reveal it to the people
[48:20] because God will do nothing but he
[48:21] reveals himself. So here's the lion
[48:23] coming, the lamb. Now the end here and
[48:27] turn, John turned to see the lion. He
[48:29] saw a lamb, bloody, wounded, paid the
[48:32] price, paid a great price for yours and
[48:34] mine's redemption.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; But the redemption goes on until and
[48:37] it's not finished until he takes this
[48:39] book. Now he's got to reveal what he did
[48:42] pay for. Now he's got to reveal. He's
[48:45] got to make known to those that are
[48:47] hearing can hear the word calling them
[48:50] because they're the mystery in the book.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; You see what the prophet See what this
[48:59] message is bringing us to our position.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; The opening of the seals, the voice of
[49:04] God is positionally placing his bride.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness, brother David. I about
[49:11] like to come off unglued on that. That's
[49:13] the truth.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; It's positionally placing the bride.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what's this voice still doing?
[49:21] Saying, "Come.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Come."
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; What's she The spirit of the bride say,
[49:28] "Come."
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to go quickly this. I
[49:32] look can look up a lot of these
[49:33] scriptures, but second Corinthians, we
[49:36] read it. We have not come here to
[49:38] minister the letter. Amen. He's not. He
[49:42] see how the message said. Let me let me
[49:44] just turn over there just a minute now.
[49:46] You don't have to turn over there. Just
[49:48] let me get the words right on it. Second
[49:50] Corinthians chapter 4 or chapter 3,
[49:53] excuse me, verse or six. Who also we're
[49:58] not sufficient of ourselves. Verse 5.
[50:00] No, we're not. We're the living word
[50:01] made manifest, but we're not sufficient.
[50:03] David's not sufficient in himself.
[50:06] You're not sufficient in yourself.
[50:09] There's no sufficiency in us
[50:11] &gt;&gt; to think anything of as of ourselves,
[50:13] but our sufficiency is of God.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Verse six, who also hath made us. Now,
[50:19] there it is. Who also hath made us. We
[50:22] didn't make ourselves. Who also hath
[50:24] made us. Other words, there's an ability
[50:27] given to his bride to hear his voice.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. Many hear the voice, but not many
[50:35] understand the voice.
[50:37] Many hear the voice. Many can read the
[50:40] scriptures. Many see the scripture,
[50:42] &gt;&gt; but they can't understand what's hid in
[50:44] that scripture
[50:45] &gt;&gt; because he's hid it from the wise and
[50:47] prudent would reveal it to babe. Seed of
[50:49] God
[50:51] &gt;&gt; that here can hear the word.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're not ministers of
[50:56] the letter because the letter kaleth.
[50:58] We're ministers of the New Testament.
[51:00] Yes. The new covenant, the blood
[51:01] covenant, but not of the letter. That's
[51:04] remma. Not of the letter. See, God hid
[51:06] himself in a letter. God hid himself in
[51:09] word in letter form.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; But underneath that letter is logos.
[51:18] That's hid. Only ones that can receive
[51:20] that are those that are born again. You
[51:23] cannot know this message without being
[51:25] born again. You cannot see it. No man
[51:27] can see the kingdom of God except he's
[51:30] born again.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; You cannot understand the kingdom of God
[51:33] unless you're born again.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:36] Amen. And so it's you can't there's no
[51:38] way to receive it. But to those that are
[51:41] born and only the bride can be truly
[51:43] born again,
[51:46] &gt;&gt; that's who's going in the rapture. Who
[51:48] they are, I don't know. I preach the
[51:50] truth. God reveals the truth. What's
[51:52] pulling on your heart? Why are you
[51:54] sitting here tonight? What's drawing
[51:56] you?
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:58] There's something beyond yourself.
[52:00] Something that sounds right in your
[52:02] soul. Even though everything around you
[52:04] is speaking contrary to it. Even your
[52:06] own thinking,
[52:08] &gt;&gt; even your own feelings are speaking. But
[52:10] there's something drawing me. Something
[52:12] inside of me. Something is there that I
[52:16] didn't put there.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; You see? See, there's something in me. I
[52:24] was looking. I had that quote here, but
[52:27] something is drawing me. Something Oh,
[52:30] yeah. Here it is. See, he that heareth
[52:32] my words. It just isn't set and listen
[52:35] to it. He's talking about John 5:24. He
[52:38] that heareth my words and believeth on
[52:39] him that sent me has eternal life. And
[52:42] he goes to the to to the the the the
[52:45] prostitute and say, "Do you hear the
[52:46] word?" Yeah, we heard the word. They all
[52:49] heard the word.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; But who could receive it?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that heareth my word and
[52:54] believeth? Who can believe it?
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Who's going to believe the report? Who's
[52:59] going to believe this report? Who's
[53:01] going to who's going to who's going to
[53:02] believe the voice of the beloved here?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those that were in him to begin
[53:09] with, those that were his children. He
[53:12] said, "I'll reveal it to babes. I'll
[53:14] hide myself in simplicity and reveal
[53:16] myself through simplicity." It isn't how
[53:19] much educated you have. You can't figure
[53:20] out what he's saying. It takes the Holy
[53:22] Ghost birthing you to hear this word.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; That's why the new birth, you must you
[53:28] must be born again. Not just have a a
[53:30] feeling. Oh, I I felt feelings. I sh sh
[53:33] sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
[53:33] sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
[53:33] sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
[53:33] shivered. I I was I I I repented. I was
[53:36] baptized his name. Then why'd you stop?
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Why did you not go on?
[53:43] Did not he promise you would receive the
[53:45] Holy Ghost, the gift of the Holy Spirit,
[53:48] if you truly have repented and took and
[53:51] by faith accepted what he said and
[53:52] outwardly proved it by a baptism in his
[53:55] name as an outward expression of your
[53:57] faith in the finished work of God.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Then why' you slow why' you stop?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Go on.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Receive it. Receive him.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; He promised it.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Brother Bram said they were they
[54:12] aimed at that's what Ephesians did. They
[54:14] were aiming but then they relaxed.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; They didn't go on. Many of them go on
[54:22] think, "Well, I'm okay now. I was
[54:23] baptized in his name." And you find
[54:25] yourself out here in the world. You
[54:26] said, "Why am I doing this? I thought I
[54:28] was saved."
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Satan coming to you and say, "I thought
[54:31] you said you were a believer."
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Who is the believer?
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Is David the man the believer? Am I the
[54:39] man? The person is not what comes
[54:41] predestinated. Eternal life from God.
[54:43] It's the seed
[54:45] &gt;&gt; that comes predestinated. Jacob I loved.
[54:47] Esau I hated. Well, that sounds cruel,
[54:49] doesn't it? But God knew Jacob
[54:51] &gt;&gt; and he was a shyer. He was a deceiver.
[54:54] But yet God said, "I've chosen him."
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Because the seed of God was in Jacob. So
[55:00] it's not And before either boy was born,
[55:03] before they did either good or bad
[55:04] works, God already chose them.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not what you do. It's not
[55:09] how you produce it. It's not your works.
[55:11] God put Satan turning you around a pole.
[55:14] Round a pole. Look at the mistakes you
[55:15] made. Look at this. You can't receive
[55:17] this. You can't have this. No. I beg
[55:19] your pardon. It's for you. Because in
[55:21] your heart, that eagle believed the
[55:23] voice of that eagle. I don't care if he
[55:25] was in a barnyard.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; It's not what you do. It's what God
[55:28] already did for you already.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; He already chose you in himself. Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; You've already been chosen in him. Why
[55:37] would he be pulling you? Why would you
[55:39] have a pull in your heart if you weren't
[55:41] him? Is there a deep calling? Then
[55:43] there's a deep right here tonight to
[55:44] respond to that call.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Watch that deep. Just respond to it.
[55:51] That's all God said. Do you believe me
[55:52] or don't you believe me? He didn't ask
[55:54] you to figure it out. He didn't say, "Do
[55:56] do he said he didn't say do this work,
[55:59] do that." He said, "Believe what I'm
[56:01] saying. Just believe it. Accept it."
[56:04] Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; That's what Satan doesn't want you to
[56:09] do,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Is accept the truth,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Because he can't fight the truth. He can
[56:16] only come on the battlefield of your
[56:18] ground of your mind and say, "Oh, well,
[56:20] you thought." That's what he told Eve.
[56:23] Let me explain it to you. You thought
[56:26] if you ate of this tree, you would die.
[56:28] Oh, now you know that's God's too good a
[56:30] God to do that. Why? Why, you pretty
[56:33] little thing. You know, you were made
[56:34] for this purpose and and why God
[56:36] wouldn't kill you.
[56:38] Well, he wouldn't. Did he say he would?
[56:41] Did he say you would die?
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. Then why did he pay the price for
[56:45] you? If you weren't valued enough, why
[56:48] would he pay the price for your
[56:49] redemption and your salvation? And then
[56:51] here tonight telling you, I bought you.
[56:54] I paid the price of you. And now I'm
[56:56] calling you.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; All you need to do is surrender your
[57:00] life to me.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Accept it.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't try to figure it out.
[57:04] There's not enough works you can do. I
[57:06] don't care how radical you were. I don't
[57:08] care how dirty you were. I don't care
[57:10] anything about that.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Paul was a murderer. Paul was a
[57:13] deceiver. Paul b took Christians and
[57:15] beat them and everything else. And yet
[57:18] God said, "I've chose him. He's going to
[57:19] be a messenger to my and and did God
[57:21] look at that?" No. The blood covered
[57:23] that. I said, "I'm I love him. I first
[57:26] loved him when he was unlovable."
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:29] So, it's not anything you can do or ever
[57:32] will do.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; It's grace of God to you through the
[57:35] revelation of himself living in you.
[57:38] He's drawing you.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Because you're his own. You always were
[57:43] his own.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; He can't come to him unless he calls
[57:48] you. And if he's calling you, you can
[57:50] come to him.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Okay, I've got off the little about off
[57:53] the track here. Let's go back.
[57:57] All right. Now, so Christ in you is the
[58:00] mystery, the secret revealed, the secret
[58:02] revelation
[58:04] that she is him.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Now, so we we go
[58:10] back over here. I Okay. So, we see that
[58:13] when this when the seventh seal Oh,
[58:14] okay. Now, I Yeah, we're not ministers
[58:17] of the letter, but we're ministers of
[58:18] the spirit of the letter. For the for
[58:21] the letter kleth, but the spirit
[58:24] giveth life.
[58:27] Amen. Are you with me?
[58:29] &gt;&gt; There's your voice.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; There's what we're preaching. That's our
[58:33] ministry.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right.
[58:37] Okay. So, we're ministering the thought,
[58:40] the faith. Now, as I said, who is this
[58:43] believer in you? It's not David. You put
[58:46] your name in. It isn't David. The
[58:49] believer is Christ revealed in me.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; That's the believer. The believer is the
[58:56] faith of God. His own faith revealed in
[58:59] you,
[59:01] &gt;&gt; revealed to you. God is my rock. So what
[59:04] is the believer? The believer is the
[59:05] faith of God moving in you.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. So, we're
[59:11] ministers of the spirit.
[59:14] Now, Matthew 13.
[59:22] Matthew 13 verse 9, who hath ears to
[59:27] hear, let him hear. He just got done
[59:29] speaking of the ser and some fell on
[59:32] this ground wayside, some in stony
[59:34] places, etc., etc. And then in verse 9,
[59:36] he said, "Who hath ears? Who hath?
[59:41] Who hath ears?" When were you given ears
[59:44] to hear?
[59:46] &gt;&gt; You didn't learn it through theology.
[59:48] You didn't learn it yourself. You can't
[59:49] know it anyway. In fact, his his
[59:51] thoughts are higher than your thoughts.
[59:53] His ways are higher than your ways. But
[59:56] as I said, something inside of me, see,
[59:59] it isn't just sitting listening to the
[1:00:00] word. That's receiving it. See,
[1:00:04] receiving it. You believe it. Something
[1:00:06] inside of you tells you it's right.
[1:00:09] You've accepted it. You believe it. It's
[1:00:11] yours.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; How do you hear the word? You hear it
[1:00:15] with your heart.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:00:18] That's right. You may hear the rema
[1:00:20] coming through here, but what's your
[1:00:22] heart saying? What's your heart
[1:00:23] receiving?
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; So, you hear the voice with your heart?
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So,
[1:00:32] so we see in Matthew 13, he said that
[1:00:34] and then verse and then the disciples
[1:00:36] asked him said, "Why?" He said unto him,
[1:00:39] "Why speakest thou unto them
[1:00:43] in parables?"
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; We've heard you speak. You're speaking
[1:00:47] in parables. Yeah.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And he gave the reason why. He answered
[1:00:51] and said unto them, "Because it is given
[1:00:53] unto you." They heard the parable, but
[1:00:55] he said, "Because it's given unto you."
[1:00:59] Other words, I know you're going to hear
[1:01:02] beyond
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; the rema.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; You're going to be able to hear what I'm
[1:01:07] saying
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost will open it to
[1:01:10] you. When the Holy Ghost has come, he
[1:01:12] will lead you. The spirit of truth will
[1:01:13] lead you into all truth. You don't have
[1:01:16] to worry about how you're going to
[1:01:17] receive it. You don't have to worry. All
[1:01:18] you need to do is feed on the opened
[1:01:21] word.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; The message was sent for your
[1:01:24] deliverance. The message was sent for
[1:01:26] your going home. The message was sent
[1:01:28] for you to be changed.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; And when the message is revealed in you,
[1:01:32] it's your evidence. It's your
[1:01:34] identification.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Because the evidence is hearing this
[1:01:37] word.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; The evidence is hearing the voice.
[1:01:40] That's the evidence of the true Holy
[1:01:42] Spirit in you. So when you hear that and
[1:01:44] can receive that, that's the evidence
[1:01:46] that you're already in the resurrection,
[1:01:49] you're already headed toward a rapture.
[1:01:51] That's the evidence. It's not your
[1:01:53] works. It's not whether you failed today
[1:01:56] or tomorrow. The Bible even said the
[1:01:58] steps of a good man are ordered of the
[1:01:59] Lord. Though he fall, wait a minute. I
[1:02:03] thought you said the order of the Lord
[1:02:04] ordered my steps. And now he's saying
[1:02:07] though he fall
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; he shall not be utterly cast down
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; because who's he falling into God's
[1:02:15] hand.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; He'll fall into my hand and not going to
[1:02:19] be utterly cast down. My grace will pick
[1:02:22] him back up because I was the one that
[1:02:24] led him to fall. I was the one that knew
[1:02:26] he would fall. I was the one that did it
[1:02:29] for a purpose that I might fulfill my
[1:02:31] purpose through them.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Through him. through the individual. So,
[1:02:36] so mistakes and failures has nothing to
[1:02:39] do with it. When you come under the
[1:02:40] blood and identified to be under that
[1:02:42] blood, Satan cannot break through that
[1:02:44] blood and get to you
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; because the real you is what's been
[1:02:48] alive and brought to life on the inside.
[1:02:50] You were his seed or you would never
[1:02:52] hear his call. God's trying to show you,
[1:02:55] I'm calling you.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, that's right.
[1:03:00] And because that eagle was in the
[1:03:01] barnyard and amongst the chickens, I
[1:03:04] heard the voice of God when I was 12
[1:03:06] years old sitting in a barnyard of
[1:03:08] chickens.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; But I heard the word and it spoke to me
[1:03:12] and it reverberated inside of me. The
[1:03:15] eagle did because he was an eagle to
[1:03:17] begin with. Do you realize you were his
[1:03:19] to begin with? You were chosen to begin
[1:03:21] with
[1:03:23] and you can't do enough works right now
[1:03:25] to merit him. No way, no way, no shape,
[1:03:28] no form. For by grace are you saved
[1:03:30] through faith. That's his faith. For by
[1:03:33] grace are you saved through faith. And
[1:03:34] that is the gift of God. It wasn't what
[1:03:37] you got. He gave it to you.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so you see here to know
[1:03:45] him is life. See, it's something inside
[1:03:48] of you that tells you it's some he said
[1:03:50] my I know my sheep and I am known of
[1:03:54] them. Yeah.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; When did he know me? And when did I know
[1:03:58] him?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I'm known of him. Amen. So he that
[1:04:03] believeth and heareth my word and
[1:04:05] believeth on him sent me has passed from
[1:04:06] death unto life and shall not come into
[1:04:08] the judgment but has passed judgment
[1:04:10] because God on Calvary, our Lord on
[1:04:13] Calvary took all of your judgment. So
[1:04:15] when you receive that, receive him.
[1:04:18] There is no judgment. Satan cannot bring
[1:04:21] judgment. Your judgment is dismissed.
[1:04:24] the the that your judges said case is
[1:04:26] dismissed. I can't find one thing
[1:04:28] against you.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; And who he sets free is free indeed.
[1:04:36] Therefore, there's can't be no
[1:04:37] condemnation. No more judgment. You
[1:04:40] stood your judgment in Christ. That's
[1:04:41] it. That's it. The end of the story.
[1:04:43] That's it. When he comes in, he seals
[1:04:46] you with his spirit. You're sealed to
[1:04:48] the day of your body change.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're going to grow up into
[1:04:53] his very image. You're going to grow up
[1:04:55] into his stature. Amen. And what is
[1:04:57] that? The capstone is the female of
[1:05:00] himself. Other words, that capstone, he
[1:05:03] caps it with himself revealed in bride
[1:05:06] form.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Brother David, that's it.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, so something inside
[1:05:19] of you says it's right. You've accepted
[1:05:20] it. You believe it. It's yours.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; How can he give you a gift and you
[1:05:27] receive it and not be yours?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; How can he give you invite you to come
[1:05:31] to him and then and then give you his
[1:05:33] life and then and and say, "Here, it's
[1:05:35] yours." What do you have to do to get
[1:05:37] it?
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Just take it.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; It's yours. Take it.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to figure it out. Quit
[1:05:46] trying to listen to the devil to tell
[1:05:48] you you can't do it. That's that only
[1:05:50] proves to me that you can
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; because God's put it in you to do it, to
[1:05:55] receive him.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; The devil is a liar and he's a father of
[1:06:01] lies. There's only one thing that's
[1:06:02] truth and that's God's word. And he said
[1:06:07] he said you're free. He said you have no
[1:06:11] there's no sin against you. He that's
[1:06:12] born of God cannot commit sin for the
[1:06:14] seed of God remains in him.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:18] Look at that. Yes, you were born in sin.
[1:06:20] Yes, you were shaped in iniquity. But
[1:06:22] when God calls you, he's received you.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; You just have to accept it.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I've already chosen you. Will you
[1:06:29] receive what I'm telling you? Yes, Lord.
[1:06:32] I've got There's only two powers at work
[1:06:33] here. There's the power of Satan and the
[1:06:35] power of the word. The power of the
[1:06:37] word, the power of God is his word. And
[1:06:39] the power of Satan is deception and
[1:06:41] unbelief. Satan cannot create. Amen. He
[1:06:44] cannot. He's can only pervert and add to
[1:06:46] or take away what God has already said
[1:06:49] in his word. His word is eternal life.
[1:06:51] God's word, God's logos, God's voice is
[1:06:55] eternal.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; The rema, the letter will pass away.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Hello. But not that logos.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word before it
[1:07:06] was ever written.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? God expressed the
[1:07:11] thoughts of himself and you were in
[1:07:13] those thoughts. Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Then you're a part of the word. You
[1:07:16] always were a part of the word from the
[1:07:18] very foundation of the world. You're a
[1:07:19] part of the word. And you're here in
[1:07:21] this hour, your day, in your decreed
[1:07:23] day. And God said, I'm going to come
[1:07:24] down and I'm going to call you and make
[1:07:26] it known that you're mine.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; You know what? I believe that with all
[1:07:32] my heart.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; He's already gave me the proper
[1:07:34] identification to say that I am. Now,
[1:07:36] who's going to break that seal? That's
[1:07:38] right.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; He said the package, the thing is
[1:07:45] packed, right?
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to birth you. I'm
[1:07:48] going to give a new birth. I'm going to
[1:07:49] fill you with the Holy Ghost. Amen. By
[1:07:52] one spirit are we birthed into one body.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; How are you born? From above. I don't
[1:07:59] care what your past is.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; What about the woman at the well?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; What about Paul?
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; What about all these? What was their
[1:08:06] past? That's right.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; They didn't do anything to merit God's
[1:08:10] word, God's grace.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; If it's grace, you don't merit grace.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Not by works, lest any man should boast.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; And he loved you. The Bible said he
[1:08:21] loved you when you were unlovable.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; He loved you. All right. Go back to I I
[1:08:27] Colossians. I keep coming back to this.
[1:08:29] Go back to Ephesians 2 and read it.
[1:08:32] You are his workmanship created in
[1:08:34] Christ Jesus unto good works which he
[1:08:37] has already for ordained you would walk
[1:08:39] in them.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Whose works is it his
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; working through you.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. All right. Now, let's
[1:08:52] try to get back on track here.
[1:08:58] So, he Matthew, we're in Matthew. Okay.
[1:09:01] 11 because it is given unto you to know
[1:09:03] the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
[1:09:07] but to them it is not given. Why do you
[1:09:09] speak in parables? Because to you it's
[1:09:12] given to know
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; to them it's not given.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; You're going to hear my voice.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; I'm hiding it. Other words, I'm hiding
[1:09:25] I'm hiding this truth. I'm hiding this
[1:09:27] voice behind a parable.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you the word. I've come
[1:09:32] here fulfilling the scripture. I'm
[1:09:34] hiding this behind there. You're going
[1:09:35] to hear it because the spirit of truth,
[1:09:39] he's going to lead you into all truth.
[1:09:41] He's going to reveal it. What do I have
[1:09:43] to do to be saved? Nothing. Sir, what
[1:09:46] must we do? Repent. Be baptized in the
[1:09:48] name of Jesus Christ. Remission of sins.
[1:09:50] You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:09:52] Ghost. That was his answer. Right.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Well, what else we have to do? Nothing
[1:09:58] else. Believe.
[1:10:01] Continue to feed. Continue to eat upon
[1:10:04] the open word.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; And let God open the word to you.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; It's up to him to do that. He made the
[1:10:11] promise.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; All right. I may not get through this
[1:10:16] tonight. All right. Now, that's all
[1:10:18] right. I'll follow what he says. Do
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; For who? Verse 12. For whosoever hath,
[1:10:24] to him shall be given, and he shall have
[1:10:27] more abundance. And whosoever hath not,
[1:10:29] from him shall be taken away even what
[1:10:31] he hath.
[1:10:33] Therefore speak I them in parables,
[1:10:35] because they seeing see not, and hearing
[1:10:37] they hear not, neither do they
[1:10:39] understand, and in them is fulfilled the
[1:10:42] prophecy of Isaiah said, "By hearing you
[1:10:44] shall hear
[1:10:45] and shall not understand." In other
[1:10:47] words, they're hearing the rema. They're
[1:10:48] hearing the word. They're hearing the
[1:10:50] voice spoken, but they can't receive
[1:10:54] that voice.
[1:10:56] Oh, they're hearing it. They're I mean,
[1:10:57] they're naturally hearing it.
[1:11:00] All right. But they don't understand.
[1:11:02] And seeing you shall see and shall not
[1:11:05] perceive. And seeing see now. And the
[1:11:08] people's hearts wax gross. Their ears
[1:11:10] are dull of hearing. And their eyes have
[1:11:12] they closed. At le any time I they
[1:11:16] should see with their eyes, hear with
[1:11:17] their ears, and should be and their
[1:11:19] understanding and should understand with
[1:11:22] their heart. Notice understand with
[1:11:24] their heart and should be converted.
[1:11:27] What's a conversion?
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; You receive it in your heart. You're
[1:11:30] hearing this in your heart.
[1:11:33] And that eagle heard the eagle's voice
[1:11:34] because he was an eagle to begin with.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; That's the only one that can hear the
[1:11:39] voice of God is those that were his to
[1:11:41] begin with. All right.
[1:11:44] Now in the message in the r the rising
[1:11:49] of the sun I just want to read something
[1:11:50] real quick and there he spoke to me this
[1:11:53] paragraph 12 page two the seven seals
[1:11:56] will be opened.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Now watch what he said they were the
[1:12:00] seven mysteries
[1:12:02] sevenfold mysteries plural sevenfold
[1:12:06] mystery. So, seven mysteries unfolded
[1:12:09] one mystery.
[1:12:11] What he's saying here, he said the seven
[1:12:13] mysteries mysteries
[1:12:17] a sevenfold mystery singular because in
[1:12:20] Revelation 10:7 it said the mystery
[1:12:22] singular, not mysteries.
[1:12:24] All right?
[1:12:26] The Bible that's been closed up since
[1:12:28] the foundation of the world will be
[1:12:31] revealed. Other words, it's going to be
[1:12:32] revealed in its fullness,
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; completed. opened. All right? Because
[1:12:39] it's been revealed little by little.
[1:12:40] He's he's revealed it, but he's never
[1:12:43] let the mystery out. Okay? Now, so and
[1:12:46] yet we yet a humble little group
[1:12:48] compared to the world. We've enjoyed
[1:12:50] these blessings hearing these mysteries
[1:12:53] and all these different questions has
[1:12:55] been completely revealed to us not by
[1:12:57] man, but by God himself. Lion
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; sword was in his hand.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:13:06] Whose hand? God's hand.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; And it just fit his hand. All right. So,
[1:13:14] who was who was what was that sword? It
[1:13:16] was the king's sword. Not a king.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; The king.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; So, who's opening these mysteries? The
[1:13:23] king,
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; not William Brandham. The king.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Through that prophet
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; to what? Heart of bride.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Because we're not ministers of the
[1:13:33] letter. We're ministers of the spirit.
[1:13:35] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:13:37] the spirit saith.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. So now,
[1:13:43] not by God, by God himself that opened
[1:13:45] those seven mysteries. Now watch what
[1:13:48] the seven mysteries being opened is one
[1:13:51] mystery. Now watch what the one mystery
[1:13:53] is. He's making it known right here.
[1:13:56] Don't let it pass you by. The one
[1:13:58] mystery, sevenfold mysteries, opening
[1:14:01] one mystery.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brandham called it
[1:14:04] a sevenfold mystery too. See? All right.
[1:14:08] So the of and what is it of what the
[1:14:10] church was?
[1:14:15] Now who's it going to speak to? Somebody
[1:14:16] right here tonight is speaking to.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Of what the church was.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; How it was in Christ at the beginning.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; And how it would be revealed in the last
[1:14:30] day.
[1:14:33] Oh my goodness. Look at this. So, what's
[1:14:36] the secret?
[1:14:38] What's the seven seal secret?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; You
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; which is what?
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; What did he say? You were him.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; What else did he say? You were Christ.
[1:14:58] What else did he say? See
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Christ the bride taken out of the way.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; What is What are you? You're the bride
[1:15:11] coming of Christ.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:15:15] First phase. First one of it. First
[1:15:17] coming. All that all that all that
[1:15:19] Christ was, he poured into his body, the
[1:15:22] bride. Second coming.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; What happens after that? to rapture,
[1:15:28] meeting in the air, wedding supper.
[1:15:32] What is that? Third coming right back to
[1:15:34] the millennium.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Eden,
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; three, three things.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Three comingings. How you know? You know
[1:15:41] that? Do you realize he Christ comes
[1:15:44] three times?
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once to redeem, pay the price for
[1:15:51] redemption goes on through the ages.
[1:15:53] Comes down here. It opens the seals. Do
[1:15:55] you realize what the seals did? He laid
[1:15:58] claim on what he redeemed. Where was
[1:16:00] those redeemed? In that section of the
[1:16:03] book called the book, bride book.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the bride book.
[1:16:10] That's that little book in the hand of
[1:16:12] the mighty angel, which is Christ.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; That had his picture taken.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. If you want to go
[1:16:23] on where I just read to you out of spo
[1:16:25] rising of the sun, go on and read from
[1:16:27] paragraph 12 or through paragraph 17 and
[1:16:30] he'll tell you what he had to go in me.
[1:16:32] I had to go west caught up into that
[1:16:35] constellation to fulfill seven. Amen.
[1:16:38] And what to receive the message of that
[1:16:41] seventh seal.
[1:16:45] And I come back here
[1:16:48] and it's been revealed. Have we caught
[1:16:50] that? He said in this this last few days
[1:16:53] meeting me. He said he would meet me in
[1:16:55] a little room.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Every one of them. And he
[1:17:01] also but you have to go you have to go
[1:17:03] behind the veil yourself.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not to that room,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; but into the room of your soul
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; and become unveiled by him and come out
[1:17:15] and you can't explain it.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; You don't know what took place. I don't
[1:17:18] know. But I'm changed. Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; And I can see it in the word here, but I
[1:17:24] can't give it to you.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; You have to go in there.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; And they that were ready went into the
[1:17:30] marriage.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And last one, door shut.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says then, then I
[1:17:39] mean in Revelation, well, we'll get to
[1:17:40] it in a minute, but I'll say it right
[1:17:42] now. Then in Revelations, the marriage
[1:17:44] is come. Verse nine, blessed is he
[1:17:47] that's called to the wedding supper of
[1:17:49] the lamb.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; the marriage supper. Called to it. But
[1:17:53] the marriage has come, but the going to
[1:17:55] the wedding supper, brother Bram said,
[1:17:56] is the rapture.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Takes you there. The rapture is what
[1:18:01] takes you to the wedding supper.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm I don't want to go out
[1:18:07] too far. That's another message, but I
[1:18:09] want to hit the high points of this.
[1:18:11] Okay? So, we'll lay that aside.
[1:18:14] I want you to know that was the
[1:18:16] revelation contained in the seventh
[1:18:18] seal. So when he opened the seventh
[1:18:20] seal, let's go to Revelation. Did I read
[1:18:22] all of that or not? I don't know.
[1:18:24] Revelations 8:1. Let's go back here. And
[1:18:27] when he had opened the seventh seal,
[1:18:28] there was silence. There's what I got to
[1:18:30] hit right there. There was silence in
[1:18:33] heaven about the space of a half hour.
[1:18:35] Now, in paragraph 105 through 109 of
[1:18:38] Christ, the mystery of God revealed, let
[1:18:40] me just read this portion. I don't have
[1:18:42] time. I'm losing out of time here, but
[1:18:45] in in the Christ, the mystery of God
[1:18:47] revealed in paragraph 105. And God had a
[1:18:50] purpose and a hidden mystery. And that's
[1:18:52] what I want to speak on to the church
[1:18:55] this morning.
[1:18:57] The hidden mystery of God that he had in
[1:19:00] his mind. Are you hearing this
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; thought?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; That he had in his mind before the
[1:19:07] before the world ever began. And wasn't
[1:19:10] it the heart? It's I read it to you
[1:19:13] Sunday, but I'll say it again. The heart
[1:19:15] purpose of God, the heart purpose was to
[1:19:17] choose a bride of his own choosing.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; She was for ordained a part a part of
[1:19:22] him from the foundation of the world.
[1:19:24] That was his heart purpose.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; His heart purpose was on the bride.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can read it page page 163
[1:19:33] of the church age book, paragraph 163.
[1:19:36] All right. So
[1:19:38] he said that he had in his mind before
[1:19:40] the world ever began and how that it's
[1:19:42] unfolded itself. Watch what he said.
[1:19:44] Seeing how that it's unfolded itself
[1:19:47] right down to this present hour that
[1:19:50] we're living.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Then you will understand clearly then I
[1:19:54] believe what is being done.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; All right. God's great mystery.
[1:20:01] Paragraph 106. God's great mystery. It's
[1:20:05] a secret. of how how what it's a secret
[1:20:09] of how how what
[1:20:13] you find out later on he's talking about
[1:20:15] his coming of how he would come all
[1:20:18] right it's a secret he he brother said
[1:20:22] he kept it a secret we know he did seven
[1:20:24] ages he kept it a secret
[1:20:27] nobody know nothing about it no they
[1:20:30] didn't angels didn't even understand it
[1:20:32] wasn't revealed to them because it was
[1:20:35] sealed led up.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Even the son didn't
[1:20:41] know it.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; When he would come, the angels didn't
[1:20:46] understand it.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; They didn't know this mystery of how it
[1:20:50] would be. They didn't know it. But
[1:20:52] brother Brandham said later on after he
[1:20:54] come and and was ascended up and come
[1:20:56] back in the book of Revelations, now the
[1:20:58] full revelation of him is made known.
[1:21:00] And now he's revealing the mystery of
[1:21:03] how.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] Amen. It's still a mystery of that day
[1:21:07] and that moment, but we know we're here
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; and we know how he comes in bride form.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; The revealing of himself, the son of man
[1:21:17] is being revealed.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; She has one ministry, the revealing of
[1:21:22] the son of man.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; That's her ministry.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] She's not out to to to build up a
[1:21:34] church, build up an organization. She
[1:21:36] has one thing to do.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; That's her ministry is reveal the son of
[1:21:40] man.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; And it was revealed through a son of
[1:21:43] man. The prophet said, "You're not
[1:21:44] feeding on a man. You're feeding on the
[1:21:46] body word of the son of man." The word
[1:21:49] for the season, the carcass, the fresh
[1:21:51] meat, the mana.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And what's it revealing? The mystery.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Your name is in that book.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; The book held it. The bel book held the
[1:22:01] secret of who you are, where you come
[1:22:03] from. That book held that. It contained
[1:22:06] names and the book was sealed up until
[1:22:09] the end.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; He said if it wasn't if it was revealed,
[1:22:12] Satan would have got a hold of it and
[1:22:14] done great damage.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; But he can't know this.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Because it's beyond him. It's the third
[1:22:20] pull. And he can't receive it.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; He can't hear it. He can't understand
[1:22:25] it.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; See that? Okay. Then he comes down here
[1:22:31] and he says, he said, "So the angel
[1:22:34] didn't understand it. He didn't reveal
[1:22:36] it to him." That's the reason under our
[1:22:38] seventh mystery when the seventh seal
[1:22:40] was opened, there was silence. Why?
[1:22:42] Because it's a secret
[1:22:45] and everything hushed up. They didn't
[1:22:48] know anything about it. They were awed
[1:22:50] by it. That's right.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Here it is. They knew God had promised a
[1:22:54] revealing. We They knew something was
[1:22:56] sealed up.
[1:22:58] And here it is opened.
[1:23:02] The silence is the secret.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it's been opened.
[1:23:10] He noticed seven seals were opened. Not
[1:23:13] six only. Seven.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; It opened. He said it's open. And he
[1:23:18] said it's already opened. It's opened.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; And he's telling you he's telling you
[1:23:23] right here. Let me just I got I've got
[1:23:24] to read this. If I don't get anything
[1:23:26] else, it's going to be this is it. He
[1:23:28] said, now watch. He said, so it was
[1:23:31] silence. Jesus, when he was earth, they
[1:23:32] wanted to know when he would come. He
[1:23:34] said, not even the son himself know when
[1:23:36] it's going to happen. That was silent to
[1:23:38] him.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; All right. See, the son himself, he
[1:23:43] could only know as God revealed it to
[1:23:44] him. He said, "The son of himself can do
[1:23:47] nothing but what God shows me." Isn't
[1:23:49] that right?
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; So, neither can we. We have the same We
[1:23:57] are under the same the same um uh uh how
[1:24:02] do he word that?
[1:24:05] The son, he could do nothing until God
[1:24:07] revealed it to him and said, "Neither
[1:24:09] can the bride." But we don't see it by
[1:24:10] vision.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; But it's a revelation to you. And you
[1:24:14] can't do it until it's revealed to you
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; because it's done by faith, not by hope.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation.
[1:24:22] And you can't do it either. That same
[1:24:24] harmony, that's what he said. The same
[1:24:26] harmony is to exist that existed between
[1:24:28] the son and his father is existing now
[1:24:31] between the bridegroom and the bride.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; She can't move. She can't do it until
[1:24:36] it's revealed to her.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; There's where so many get in trouble.
[1:24:43] They they feel inspired and they go out
[1:24:45] no revelation and try to speak something
[1:24:47] and it doesn't happen. Why? It wasn't a
[1:24:49] revelation to them. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; We're not how to speak our own thoughts.
[1:24:54] We're here to speak his thought.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. My father, Jesus said,
[1:25:00] "My father workketh hither to." That
[1:25:03] means he's working at that moment and I
[1:25:06] work and I can do nothing until he does
[1:25:08] work.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; And neither can you.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:13] So let God have his way on his time and
[1:25:16] in his time
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; because he makes all things beautiful in
[1:25:19] his time.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; He's not he's he's perfect in his works.
[1:25:25] He said that in Psalms 18. He's perfect
[1:25:28] in his work. Well, what he does is
[1:25:30] perfect. And he said now it turns right
[1:25:32] around and said then he's made your way
[1:25:34] perfect.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; The same chapter, same verse, two verses
[1:25:39] down. And he's made your way perfect.
[1:25:42] So, who's leading you?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Will it not be perfect?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:51] All right. So, we keep going here.
[1:25:54] Even the son doesn't know. Okay. God has
[1:25:57] all of this to himself. It is a It's a
[1:26:00] secret. That's the reason there was
[1:26:02] silence. That's the reason it's a
[1:26:05] secret. That's the reason there was
[1:26:07] silence.
[1:26:10] Okay. in heaven for the space of a half
[1:26:12] hour. Seven thunders uttered their
[1:26:15] voices.
[1:26:17] Brother Brandham saw the seventh seal
[1:26:19] open. He looked for the interpretation
[1:26:20] and he went to those seven thunders. He
[1:26:22] said, "So, see, it's connected
[1:26:26] together. What is it?" He said, "It's
[1:26:28] the coming of the Lord."
[1:26:31] You see, the coming is a mystery because
[1:26:33] it's a secret catching away.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; It's not a public show, Brother David.
[1:26:38] Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; It's not publicly known. It's not even
[1:26:41] revealed to the public.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; She has this secret. She alone knows
[1:26:46] this.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; That's what makes her an object to
[1:26:49] others.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Because they're not motivated by
[1:26:53] feelings. They're not motivated by
[1:26:54] senses. They're motivated and directed
[1:26:57] by him. Revelation.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. All right. They're
[1:27:03] led by the spirit.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; We're ministers of the spirit. were led
[1:27:08] by the spirit.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Did not he say he would lead you into
[1:27:13] all truth? Then what are you fretting
[1:27:14] about?
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; What are we worried about? He said when
[1:27:18] he comes, spirit of truth, he'll lead
[1:27:20] you into all truth.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Then if he said it, will he not do it?
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you the one that's Are you
[1:27:31] the one that that is receiving what he
[1:27:33] promised?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. He said, "I'll never
[1:27:38] leave you nor forsake you." Are we not
[1:27:41] believing that promise?
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "Nothing can happen to a
[1:27:45] believer by chance. It is all ordained."
[1:27:47] Do we believe what he said?
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; You see, see what Satan's against? He
[1:27:56] doesn't. He hates it when you take your
[1:27:57] stand upon the word and quit trying to
[1:28:00] figure it out and just take him at his
[1:28:01] word and only only underline only
[1:28:04] believe. Don't add to it. Don't take
[1:28:06] away from it. Only believe it.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Accept it and act upon it. Confess it.
[1:28:11] God said so and that's I'm not talking
[1:28:13] with you, Satan. I'm not even going to
[1:28:14] discuss this with you. He said I'm
[1:28:16] healed. That settles it. He said I'm
[1:28:18] saved and that settles it.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; He said he saved me at Calvary. I
[1:28:22] believe it.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And I my works are proving it. I believe
[1:28:27] it.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Amen.
[1:28:34] Now,
[1:28:35] okay.
[1:28:37] And John and they seven thunders under
[1:28:40] their voices. Seven mysteries. Seven
[1:28:42] thunders. Seven folds of God. One
[1:28:45] mystery. And John was forbidden to write
[1:28:47] it. See the coming of the Lord.
[1:28:52] That's one thing he hasn't revealed yet.
[1:28:54] You say, "Well, see, he hasn't revealed
[1:28:55] it yet." Wait a minute. Up to that time,
[1:28:59] it wasn't revealed.
[1:29:01] Up to this time, it wasn't. It's been
[1:29:04] opened.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; It's already been revealed.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; People looking, looking, looking. Oh my
[1:29:11] glorious. When he comes, he's already
[1:29:13] come
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; and coming.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Where's he coming?
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; In you.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; You're his promised word unveiled,
[1:29:25] revealing itself. There it is.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; That's it. What are we looking for?
[1:29:31] We're looking for the capturing. We're
[1:29:33] looking for the meeting in the air, his
[1:29:34] third coming.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; What's that opened up to? Wedding
[1:29:37] supper, millennium.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; See how he comes in such simplicity,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; That's what he promised. It was the
[1:29:46] bride. He called it the bride coming of
[1:29:48] Christ.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Just exactly. Go back to the Genesis and
[1:29:54] find out
[1:29:56] what was Eve before she was Eve. Mrs.
[1:30:00] Mrs. Adam. What was she? She was she was
[1:30:03] the secret of Mr. Adam
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; revealed
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; unveiled.
[1:30:10] What was that hidden secret? The seal
[1:30:12] had to be broke.
[1:30:15] Adam had to unveil himself.
[1:30:19] Who was she?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Him.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Revealed in another form.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she was the capstone
[1:30:30] revelation of the creation.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Do you realize this is a capstone
[1:30:39] message? Do you realize that Christ in
[1:30:43] you makes you the complete revelation of
[1:30:46] the whole thing?
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go to Romans. I gota
[1:30:53] Let's go to Romans. Kid with a couple
[1:30:54] scriptures and then I a couple quotes
[1:30:56] and I've got to quit. So I may go about
[1:30:59] 10 minutes over. So you just bear with
[1:31:01] me.
[1:31:04] He has showed it. Now watch what he's
[1:31:05] saying. He he's revealing of how he will
[1:31:08] come and when he will come and but and
[1:31:11] when we know he's come. We know when but
[1:31:13] we don't know that moment that change
[1:31:16] will be.
[1:31:18] Brother Brham said that was the part
[1:31:20] that was the thing that was in an
[1:31:22] unknown tongue.
[1:31:25] Amen. Are you with me?
[1:31:27] Okay. Now, he said he has showed it. He
[1:31:32] showed and he just said it's not been
[1:31:34] revealed yet, but now he's showing it.
[1:31:36] He's revealing it in every type that's
[1:31:38] in the Bible. Therefore, the entire
[1:31:40] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[1:31:43] in Christ.
[1:31:48] Brother B said, what's he titled this?
[1:31:51] The mystery of God revealed. Christ is
[1:31:52] that mystery. Christ in you would be
[1:31:54] that mystery revealed. All right. The
[1:31:57] secret
[1:31:59] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:32:01] goal that God had one purpose. He wanted
[1:32:04] to achieve in the entire Bible. And all
[1:32:07] the acts of the believers in the Bible
[1:32:09] has been in type and expressing what
[1:32:11] God's great goal is. And now and now in
[1:32:15] this last day, he has revealed it and
[1:32:19] shows it.
[1:32:22] See how people want to pick up on those
[1:32:24] other quotes, not knowing what they're
[1:32:25] talking about, and say, "Well, see, he
[1:32:27] hadn't revealed it yet." That's not what
[1:32:29] he's telling you. He just said he has.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; All right. So the entire Bible. So he
[1:32:38] has revealed it and shows it and God's
[1:32:41] help will by God's help
[1:32:46] you. He said by God's help
[1:32:50] you will see you will see it right here
[1:32:55] this morning.
[1:32:57] And the Lord has had one has had it what
[1:33:00] the excuse me what the Lord has had in
[1:33:03] his mind all along. He has expressed it.
[1:33:09] All right. Therefore, you can see the
[1:33:13] great meaning of what it's been to know
[1:33:15] this.
[1:33:18] What's he what's he talking about? The
[1:33:20] seven sealed
[1:33:22] mystery is open. And when it's opened in
[1:33:25] you, it's the secret of the seventh
[1:33:28] seal.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:31] When the seventh seal is opened, it was
[1:33:34] a secret. No longer was it a mystery.
[1:33:37] Now it's a secret.
[1:33:39] Hallelujah. All right. The secret is
[1:33:43] opened. The mystery is open.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said, the prophet
[1:33:50] said the bride would hear that secret.
[1:33:52] And that's the only one it's revealed to
[1:33:57] is the bride.
[1:33:59] Think of this, brother David. That just
[1:34:01] shaking it, didn't it? And if he hadn't
[1:34:03] have opened this book, not a person of
[1:34:05] one of us would have been would have
[1:34:06] been lost because he had to come and
[1:34:09] redeem what he bought and purchased. It
[1:34:12] come to the time when the book had to be
[1:34:15] opened. The book, the marriage
[1:34:16] certificate, the book of those names.
[1:34:19] And how did he call your name? By
[1:34:21] revealing the mystery.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; That's what called your name in the
[1:34:26] book. That's what identifies you as
[1:34:28] being a part of him. That's what
[1:34:30] identifies you in as the mystery of
[1:34:34] himself.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; This is what he's trying to achieve.
[1:34:37] This is his goal. That was his heart
[1:34:39] purpose. God's heart purpose was to have
[1:34:43] a bride.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? And she's she's
[1:34:48] she's called. She's chosen.
[1:34:52] and and by her own choosing.
[1:34:57] So, she's called and chosen. That's what
[1:34:59] the prophet said. She's called and she's
[1:35:02] chosen.
[1:35:03] Amen. All right.
[1:35:07] So,
[1:35:09] let's see. I've got to find a place here
[1:35:10] I can just close this off. Romans
[1:35:13] chapter 10. Let's go over there real
[1:35:15] quick.
[1:35:17] So he he said what a great meaning is to
[1:35:19] know to know this then to try to bring
[1:35:21] it to the people. See I haven't went
[1:35:24] into details
[1:35:27] to try to explain it as God has revealed
[1:35:29] it to me. He's talking about the seventh
[1:35:32] seal. All right. Now to bypass some
[1:35:36] things there
[1:35:39] in Romans chapter 10
[1:35:41] and then we'll just move through it
[1:35:43] pretty quick here. Romans chapter 10.
[1:35:49] And verse
[1:35:50] 16,
[1:35:54] he's talking about how how shall they
[1:35:57] preach except to be sent. It is written,
[1:35:59] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:36:01] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:36:02] glad tidings of good. Okay. But verse
[1:36:06] 16, but have but they have not all
[1:36:09] obeyed the gospel.
[1:36:12] For Isaiah saith, or Isaiah Isaiah
[1:36:16] saith, "Oh Lord, who hath believed our
[1:36:20] report?" Now, right there,
[1:36:23] they all heard it, but who hath believed
[1:36:26] it?
[1:36:29] So then faith cometh by hearing,
[1:36:35] and hearing
[1:36:37] by the word of God.
[1:36:41] So faith cometh by hearing. Hearing
[1:36:43] what?
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; You have to read it. Everybody is
[1:36:47] hearing it.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody can hear it.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody has a word. They have the
[1:36:52] rema. It's right here.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; But they can't understand the thought
[1:36:57] underneath it.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; So you So you faith cometh by hearing
[1:37:02] and hearing receiving
[1:37:06] cometh by the word. Are you with me? All
[1:37:10] right. Now,
[1:37:16] but I I say verse 18,
[1:37:20] I say, see now watch, there's a hearing
[1:37:23] by the there's a hearing of the logos
[1:37:26] and there's a hearing of Reema in verse
[1:37:28] 17. But I say have or what's real faith
[1:37:32] come by? See, through the word. But I
[1:37:34] say, have they not or have they not
[1:37:37] heard? I just what I just said now. Have
[1:37:39] they not heard?
[1:37:42] Yes. Verily their sound, that sound is
[1:37:45] his thought declared in word
[1:37:49] or speech.
[1:37:51] That's sound. So have they not all
[1:37:55] heard? Yes. Verily their sound went into
[1:37:58] all the earth, and their words unto the
[1:38:01] end of the world. But I say, did not
[1:38:04] Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
[1:38:06] provoke you to jealousy. By them who are
[1:38:08] no people and a foolish nation, I will
[1:38:10] anger you.
[1:38:12] There you are. I was found by a people
[1:38:14] that I was I very bold and said, I was
[1:38:17] found of them that sought me not. I was
[1:38:20] made manifest of them that ask not after
[1:38:23] me.
[1:38:26] verse chap Hebrews chapter 4 or chapter
[1:38:30] 3
[1:38:32] his voice has gone out today the Bible
[1:38:35] said today verse 7 3:7 Hebrews today
[1:38:39] that's this day as the Holy Ghost saith
[1:38:41] today if you will hear his voice logos
[1:38:46] harden not your hearts in the
[1:38:47] provocation in the day of the temptation
[1:38:49] of the wilderness when your fathers
[1:38:51] tempted me and proved me and saw my
[1:38:53] works 40 years Wherefore I was wherefore
[1:38:56] I was grieved with that generation and
[1:38:58] said they do heir in their hearts in
[1:39:01] their heart and they have not known my
[1:39:03] ways. So I swear in my wrath they shall
[1:39:05] not enter into my rest. Then it goes
[1:39:07] down again while it is said today. Verse
[1:39:10] 15 and you can read the rest of it.
[1:39:12] Verse chapter 4 verse one. Let us
[1:39:16] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[1:39:18] us of entering into his rest any of you
[1:39:21] should seem to come short of it. Verse
[1:39:23] two, for unto us was the gospel preached
[1:39:26] as well as unto them the sound. They all
[1:39:29] heard it,
[1:39:33] but not every one of them that heard it
[1:39:35] could receive it. Not everyone that
[1:39:38] heard it could receive the voice,
[1:39:41] understand it. Are you with me? All
[1:39:44] right. Now, he said, "For as well as
[1:39:47] unto them the sound went out, the gospel
[1:39:48] is preached as to us as well as them.
[1:39:50] But the word preached, the logos
[1:39:52] preached did not the word preached did
[1:39:55] not profit them not being mixed with
[1:39:58] what revelation faith in them that heard
[1:40:02] it.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; So they didn't have the the t the
[1:40:06] hearing post. They didn't have the
[1:40:08] ability to hear.
[1:40:11] So brother Brandham said concerning the
[1:40:13] mystery of Matthew 13, he said the
[1:40:16] mysteries here and this is Scoffield. He
[1:40:18] referred to Scoffield's understanding of
[1:40:20] this and he said it the mystery the
[1:40:23] mysteries here the mystery singular a
[1:40:26] mystery in scripture is a previously
[1:40:30] hidden truth I just read that
[1:40:33] in Christ the mystery God revealed
[1:40:35] paragraph 105 and so on is a previously
[1:40:39] hidden truth now divinely revealed but
[1:40:44] in which
[1:40:46] divinely revealed
[1:40:48] The message has gone out. Everybody's
[1:40:51] reading it. Everybody hears it. But not
[1:40:53] everyone can hear it, can hear, can
[1:40:57] receive it, can understand it.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; All right. Can't receive the voice.
[1:41:04] Is that true?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying who is and who. I just
[1:41:08] said that's what it is. All right. Then
[1:41:10] he said
[1:41:12] he said it's divinely revealed. But in
[1:41:16] which is a supernatural element still
[1:41:20] remains despite the revelation.
[1:41:24] So here's the revelation going out but
[1:41:27] there's a supernatural element.
[1:41:31] And what's that supernatural element?
[1:41:33] God given ability to hear the
[1:41:37] revelation.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; That's the element. That's the
[1:41:41] supernatural element.
[1:41:43] So for you for personal for for you
[1:41:47] personally
[1:41:49] it to be revealed to
[1:41:52] God personalizing
[1:41:54] himself to you by revealing that mystery
[1:41:57] to you personally. That's that
[1:41:59] supernatural element is the ability to
[1:42:02] hear what he's saying to to understand
[1:42:04] it.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Not everybody can but they all heard it
[1:42:07] revealed.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Now,
[1:42:13] so brother Brandham said in the seventh
[1:42:15] seal,
[1:42:16] when the supernatural comes in, that's
[1:42:19] the mind of Christ.
[1:42:24] Don't ask me to explain it because he
[1:42:26] said, "I can't. You'll from now on just
[1:42:28] either be able to hear it or not hear
[1:42:30] it." See, I'm not going to explain it.
[1:42:34] And 1 Corinthians 2:16 said, "They that
[1:42:37] are spiritual have the mind of God."
[1:42:40] have the mind of Christ.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; So there you are. All right.
[1:42:48] Okay. I'm going to bypass. I'm going to
[1:42:50] close off now. Just listen carefully.
[1:42:55] I'll just make mention of this. In
[1:42:56] Revelation 5:13, John was having a a
[1:42:59] real jolly time. He said, "Everything
[1:43:01] heard me praise him and give glory to
[1:43:03] him." You know the scripture because
[1:43:05] brother Brandham said he happened to see
[1:43:07] his name written in the book.
[1:43:10] Are you with me? And he said also, he
[1:43:13] said he must have looked past the
[1:43:14] curtain of time.
[1:43:18] What's written? He looked past the
[1:43:20] curtain of time and said, "There's John.
[1:43:25] There he is." Now, that's He didn't say
[1:43:27] that just to be
[1:43:29] He said that for a reason because that's
[1:43:31] what the bride's doing.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; That's what she sees. My name was there.
[1:43:35] My name's in that revelation. My name's
[1:43:37] written right there. Because the mystery
[1:43:40] I'm having, I have the ability. I'm
[1:43:42] hearing the mystery and that's called
[1:43:44] me.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're a part of it to
[1:43:46] begin with.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; You're the mystery of God revealed.
[1:43:50] Okay. So So he's claiming what he
[1:43:52] purchased. Amen. I'm just going to keep
[1:43:54] moving down here.
[1:44:02] And we know in Daniel, we know in
[1:44:04] Daniel. Now just listen to this a minute
[1:44:06] real quick. Can I just have about five
[1:44:09] minutes?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:44:15] All right. Because only one is the is
[1:44:18] the is one here is the majority that
[1:44:22] answers.
[1:44:26] You say, "Well, I answered my mind." You
[1:44:28] need to say it. All right. Now, now I'm
[1:44:32] just I'm just relaxing a minute. Now,
[1:44:34] watch this. He's the great spiritual
[1:44:37] king over the spirit that's in us
[1:44:38] because we were in him at the beginning.
[1:44:40] You see, God in the beginning when he
[1:44:43] thought of you and thought of others
[1:44:44] like that thought of himself being
[1:44:47] tangible. That was his thoughts and he
[1:44:51] expressed his thoughts
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; by word.
[1:44:55] There it is. That's why you can hear the
[1:44:58] message
[1:45:00] because you were in his thoughts. All
[1:45:02] right. The eternal God had eternal
[1:45:04] thoughts and that's why he decreed Jacob
[1:45:06] I loved and Esau I hated. Those were his
[1:45:08] eternal Jacob had was his eternal
[1:45:10] thoughts. All right, I'm going to move
[1:45:12] on.
[1:45:18] Okay, now so he says here,
[1:45:22] where am I? Here I've got to go back.
[1:45:24] Okay, there we are. All right.
[1:45:32] Now, Revelation 19:11 said, "Heaven
[1:45:35] opened
[1:45:37] and heavens consist of the word." Do you
[1:45:40] believe that?
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:45:44] Amen. So, he starts his ride and watch
[1:45:47] what the prophet says. And the body must
[1:45:50] follow the head.
[1:45:53] Verse 14. And they that followed him
[1:45:56] were stimulated with wine and oil,
[1:45:58] riding right along.
[1:46:00] What are they coming down? They know
[1:46:01] those seven thunders, the secret
[1:46:03] revealed, will issue the thing forth
[1:46:05] pretty soon.
[1:46:08] Amen. Issue what forth? Body change.
[1:46:11] What else will it issue? What was the
[1:46:13] seventh seal to do when it exploded
[1:46:15] here? It put out five stars. Remember
[1:46:18] the seventh seal is the end of time of
[1:46:20] all things. It ends the time. Remember,
[1:46:23] it couldn't be made known until the end
[1:46:25] of time. When the seventh seal was
[1:46:27] revealed, it identified to you and I
[1:46:30] were at the end.
[1:46:33] In fact, that's the exact words of the
[1:46:34] prophet. Don't you realize that seal
[1:46:36] being open signifies to us we've
[1:46:39] arrived. We're at the end because it
[1:46:42] could only be made known then. You see
[1:46:44] the importance of the message. You see
[1:46:46] where we're at?
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; There's no more message coming. This is
[1:46:50] it.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; We're heading the the earth is heading
[1:46:53] for a for a baptism. Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; These men that are puffing themselves up
[1:46:59] against the word are going to be
[1:47:01] destroyed. That's all. And and when he
[1:47:03] rides forth by the spirit of his word,
[1:47:06] by the by the by the sword of his own
[1:47:08] spoken word
[1:47:10] puts him destroys him. When he's done
[1:47:13] said, it's said. He's got to fulfill
[1:47:16] what he said. Is that right? So, we know
[1:47:18] that there's going to be a a real
[1:47:20] Armageddon.
[1:47:21] Amen. We're fighting a spiritual
[1:47:23] Armageddon right now, but there's a real
[1:47:25] Armageddon that's going to other words,
[1:47:28] just like our body change. It's going to
[1:47:30] come to full realization. So, will that
[1:47:32] come to full realization? But the
[1:47:34] starting of the ride, we're riding
[1:47:35] following him right on
[1:47:38] this is opened.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; It opens from there into the body
[1:47:43] change. It opens from there. It goes to
[1:47:46] the wedding supper. It blows out five
[1:47:48] more stars. Goes into millennium. goes
[1:47:51] from there into new heavens and new
[1:47:52] earth. Isn't that what he said? It ends
[1:47:54] a time for this. It ends a time for that
[1:47:59] and right off into he said and it goes
[1:48:01] right off into eternity. Now, what are
[1:48:03] you following? You're following his
[1:48:05] life. You're following the revelation.
[1:48:07] You're following him because he's your
[1:48:09] head and your head has come. It's
[1:48:12] appeared.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is right there. All
[1:48:16] right. So now
[1:48:20] he said the body must follow the head.
[1:48:22] The wife follows a husband.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Being that Adam was not deceived, he
[1:48:27] walked out with Eve. Eve was deceived.
[1:48:29] She was in the transgression or the or
[1:48:31] the entire resurrection of the whole
[1:48:34] body would have come forth in the day of
[1:48:36] the Lord Jesus when he came from the
[1:48:37] grave. Other words, he's saying he had
[1:48:39] to redeem her. She was lost. If she
[1:48:42] wasn't lost, then the whole body would
[1:48:43] have come up then.
[1:48:46] Okay. So, he had to pay the price of
[1:48:48] redemption and he had to rise again
[1:48:50] showing that it's that that her con her
[1:48:54] sin, her iniquity is put on the head of
[1:48:56] the devil. He's raised victorious over
[1:48:58] it and you raised with him.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so here we are. He said now he
[1:49:05] said but he had to redeem her which is
[1:49:09] his body. Is there anybody that's his
[1:49:11] body here? He had to redeem her, which
[1:49:14] is his body. See, it was the price of
[1:49:16] his blood. Claimed what he he claimed.
[1:49:20] He claims, excuse me, he claims what
[1:49:21] he's paid for. He comes to claim what he
[1:49:24] purchased. See, that's his ministry
[1:49:27] today. She had to be redeemed in order
[1:49:30] to come to him. Do you see it? She had
[1:49:32] See, she had she had to be claimed. She
[1:49:35] had to be claimed as his possession. He
[1:49:38] purchased it. That's at the cross. But
[1:49:41] now he had to come to finish redemption.
[1:49:45] And what held the mystery of that
[1:49:47] seventh seal.
[1:49:50] Amen. So here he comes right here and
[1:49:53] he's and he comes forth from the grave.
[1:49:56] He to redeemer which is his body. She
[1:49:59] has to be redeemed in order to come to
[1:50:01] him. Do you see it? See it. It couldn't
[1:50:05] have happened then. The redemption goes
[1:50:07] on. Now you see the seals when he was in
[1:50:10] his mediatorial work back there
[1:50:12] redeeming. But someday and it's not and
[1:50:14] we and he but he's saying that so you
[1:50:16] catch the vision. Someday he comes forth
[1:50:19] to get this book. John 14 2-3. He comes
[1:50:23] forth to receive us. He comes forth to
[1:50:25] get this book that he's redeemed and all
[1:50:29] that's in this book would be him. For
[1:50:32] the for that's the believer. That's the
[1:50:34] believer. The words in the book.
[1:50:37] So what is the seal opening? The words
[1:50:40] in the book. What is the third pull? The
[1:50:42] opening of the word.
[1:50:45] Is that right? The words were closed.
[1:50:48] And brother Brandham said, "And you," he
[1:50:50] just says it right here. "And you are
[1:50:52] the words in the book." And the word is
[1:50:55] him. All that and all that is in that
[1:50:59] it's him. And you're those words in the
[1:51:01] book.
[1:51:03] Daniel verse 9 12:9 was told to shut up
[1:51:06] the book until the time of the end the
[1:51:09] words would be closed
[1:51:12] that right John were forbidden to write
[1:51:14] it but now you the word are opened
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; the message opens the word you're that
[1:51:23] word
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; all right so the words is him
[1:51:29] that's the third pull he's opened the
[1:51:32] word he's opened the sealed mystery of
[1:51:34] the book. The book is now open. The
[1:51:36] mystery is now opened. He come forth for
[1:51:39] this book of redemption whose names are
[1:51:42] written in the book. He comes forth for
[1:51:44] this book of redemption. How about you
[1:51:46] say amen? He comes forth. Have we seen
[1:51:48] it? For the book of re for this book of
[1:51:51] redemption whose names are written in
[1:51:53] the book and I say, do we see it? And
[1:51:56] will we see it? Absolutely.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. whose names are written in the
[1:52:03] book before the foundation of the world
[1:52:05] when he was slain as a lamb. And here he
[1:52:08] is today in his word manifesting the
[1:52:12] same thing he did there. She can't
[1:52:15] recognize another headship. No sir.
[1:52:17] There's no bishop or nothing. She
[1:52:19] recognizes one headship. That's Christ.
[1:52:22] And Christ is the word. Oh my. I love
[1:52:26] that.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; She expressed she's his thought
[1:52:30] expressed. see
[1:52:32] in her as it was in Adam. We've just
[1:52:34] been through that. We are not come
[1:52:36] together to talk about the message. We
[1:52:38] are come together to get in the message.
[1:52:41] And the message is Christ. He is the
[1:52:44] word. That's right. We're to get into
[1:52:46] it. Get beneath it. Yes, sir. That's
[1:52:49] what we're supposed to do. We have to
[1:52:51] get beneath the token.
[1:52:56] Amen. All right.
[1:53:00] Can't you see where we're standing? Life
[1:53:02] is in the grain again.
[1:53:05] What is it? Just exactly the same grain
[1:53:07] that went in the ground. The same Jesus
[1:53:10] in the bride form.
[1:53:13] Uhoh. Well,
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; that's what he said, didn't he? Same
[1:53:18] power, same church, same thing. The same
[1:53:21] word. The same word sucked up through
[1:53:23] these other words through these carriers
[1:53:27] come out here coming through the wheat
[1:53:29] plant. Come up out come out of the
[1:53:32] shuck. Came through the shuck and out of
[1:53:33] the shuck and come to a head here. It
[1:53:37] come to a head here.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; What is our ministry? The head.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; What is the bride's ministry today? The
[1:53:46] head.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Where was that head? Where was the
[1:53:49] secret in the pyramid? When he opened it
[1:53:53] up, what did he open? White stone.
[1:53:57] And in it, nothing written on it. So I
[1:54:00] had to go west to get the revelation of
[1:54:02] that unwritten word. And you're a rock
[1:54:05] in that rock. For brother Brandham said,
[1:54:08] there's a rock in the rock. And the
[1:54:11] Peter, first Peter 2 expla testifies of
[1:54:14] that. It's the elect.
[1:54:18] Amen. You're that stone, a living stone.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, I don't have time
[1:54:26] to go into those. That's a whole message
[1:54:28] in itself. See,
[1:54:30] I'm just hitting this. The same Jesus in
[1:54:34] the bride form. Same words, same word
[1:54:36] sucked up these, come out here and come
[1:54:38] to a head. All that life that come up
[1:54:40] there picked up its people. Now it's
[1:54:42] forming. Now watch. It picked up its
[1:54:44] people.
[1:54:46] Tossle or or or
[1:54:49] stalk tossle.
[1:54:53] Amen. Shuck. Are you with me?
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Out of the shuck come what? The same
[1:54:59] grain. Back to the same word. All right.
[1:55:03] Picked up its people. Life coming
[1:55:05] through there. Picked up his people. And
[1:55:07] now it's forming into a head
[1:55:11] for the rapture.
[1:55:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Who are you a part of that head?
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; It's forming into the head. Who's
[1:55:20] forming into the head?
[1:55:24] All right. For the rapture, the germ,
[1:55:27] the germ that was in you at the
[1:55:29] beginning,
[1:55:31] the beginning was the word. So the germ
[1:55:33] that was in you at the beginning, you
[1:55:37] were in him. The germ that was in you at
[1:55:40] the beginning found you.
[1:55:43] right here in your decreed season. It
[1:55:46] found you.
[1:55:48] For the word that was in you at the
[1:55:50] beginning found you. St. John 1 1-2. God
[1:55:54] forces upward the spirit of God which is
[1:55:56] what we minister which is the word of
[1:55:58] God. My word is spirit. We are ministers
[1:56:02] of his spirit. My word is spirit and
[1:56:04] life will put the bride in her place. So
[1:56:08] when the spirit of the bride say come c
[1:56:11] o m e. What's it saying? Come to your
[1:56:13] position. Come to your place. The word
[1:56:16] puts her in her position. It
[1:56:18] positionally, the revelation of this
[1:56:20] message positionally places you, bride.
[1:56:23] It positionally places you
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It positionally is placing you in
[1:56:32] Christ.
[1:56:35] So they she says come and let him that
[1:56:38] heareth
[1:56:41] say come.
[1:56:45] So where's the where under her
[1:56:46] messenger? She's the final voice to the
[1:56:49] final age. See it's sounding. It's
[1:56:52] sounding.
[1:56:54] The voice is sounding. Who's going to
[1:56:57] hear it? Those that are ordained to hear
[1:56:59] it. Receive it. Amen.
[1:57:02] See the voice calling the bride to her
[1:57:05] position. Come to her position. She is
[1:57:08] positionally placed in Christ. It that's
[1:57:10] what makes you the complete revelation
[1:57:13] of the whole thing. You see your place.
[1:57:17] Amen. The capstone revelation and she
[1:57:19] forms into that capstone.
[1:57:24] What is it? Formed into himself.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; My my my to his very image. So the head
[1:57:32] the corner that was rejected
[1:57:35] Jesus said the revel this upon this rock
[1:57:38] this cornerstone the revelation of who I
[1:57:40] am upon this revelation of who I am I'll
[1:57:44] build my church.
[1:57:47] Amen. So it started at the foundation
[1:57:48] correctly starts building coming right
[1:57:52] up to a fine razor edge of difference.
[1:57:56] Amen. What's the difference? One's able
[1:57:58] to receive the word the other can't.
[1:58:00] oath anointed.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is. One hears the word,
[1:58:07] the other can't. Both anointed, both
[1:58:09] shout, both have miracles, both have
[1:58:11] signs, but one can receive the word, the
[1:58:14] other can't
[1:58:16] for their season. Now, do you see where
[1:58:20] we're at? So, Christ in you makes you
[1:58:23] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:58:24] thing. And the prophet said right after
[1:58:26] that, he said, "Can't you see where
[1:58:28] we're at?" So what? See what God's
[1:58:31] doing. He said,
[1:58:33] "Amen." Let's stand together.
[1:58:38] What a revelation. What a what a
[1:58:43] what a resurrection.
[1:58:45] See?
[1:58:47] See? My word of spirit and life will put
[1:58:49] the bride in her place because she'll
[1:58:50] recognize her position in the word.
[1:58:55] Then she's in Christ. That's what'll put
[1:58:57] her in her place.
[1:59:01] No national force will do it. National
[1:59:05] force is putting Israel there. National
[1:59:08] force of putting the church in the world
[1:59:09] council.
[1:59:11] Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; But the word,
[1:59:15] the logos
[1:59:17] is putting the bride in the rapture.
[1:59:23] In her place, her position. What a
[1:59:25] resurrection this is.
[1:59:29] What a resurrection that was. But what a
[1:59:31] resurrection this is in this brideging
[1:59:34] of Christ out of dark denominationalism,
[1:59:37] darkness, dead creeds, graves.
[1:59:42] Arise, shine, for thy light has come.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message is the love letter to
[1:59:49] his bride. This message is the his
[1:59:53] voice, the logos, the thought expressed
[1:59:56] of his bride. She and she alone is able
[2:00:00] by grace to read between the lines.
[2:00:05] There it is. She can receive and hears,
[2:00:09] understands what is opened.
[2:00:13] Isn't that wonderful? See where that
[2:00:15] positions you? See where that identifies
[2:00:18] you, brother, sister? Then let's let off
[2:00:21] the pressure.
[2:00:23] Let's take a hold what we're called to
[2:00:25] take a hold of that word and walk with
[2:00:28] it. Enoch walked with God and was not.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; That's the simplicity of the rapture.
[2:00:36] You walk with God and God's obligated to
[2:00:40] take you out of here.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's sing a song
[2:00:46] or two. Here
[2:00:48] we read between the lines which is his
[2:00:51] thought expressed in the word. The word
[2:00:54] promised for today. We're able to read
[2:00:58] his love letter. Amen. Why? Because
[2:01:00] we're part of him to begin with.
[2:01:03] Married.
[2:01:05] Amen. Let's sing a song. Come and dine.
[2:01:07] How many's willing to dine on the open
[2:01:09] word? Do you see the importance of it?
[2:01:12] This message, my brother, sister,
[2:01:14] listen.
[2:01:15] [Music]
[2:01:17] You realize the importance of this word
[2:01:19] in all the chaos and all the confusion
[2:01:22] and all of it. We have a place of rest.
[2:01:25] Letting off the pressure. We have one
[2:01:28] thing to follow. That's his word. I
[2:01:30] don't care how strange and unusual it is
[2:01:33] to your thinking. You take God at his
[2:01:35] word and God will take care of the rest
[2:01:38] of it.
[2:01:40] He'll work through you despite what you
[2:01:42] think about it. He'll do it. He'll if
[2:01:45] you'll just let go and give your veil on
[2:01:48] him. Put it on his shoulders.
[2:01:52] And when you put the veil on his
[2:01:53] shoulders,
[2:01:56] your true husband will accept the
[2:01:57] obligation.
[2:02:01] And he is responsible
[2:02:04] for you and I. He is responsible for us.
[2:02:08] How may willing to lay your veil on his
[2:02:10] shoulders
[2:02:12] and follow him and just let him have his
[2:02:15] way. Let him take responsibility. He's
[2:02:17] got to answer for it.
[2:02:23] Well, Jesus has a table spread where the
[2:02:28] saints of are you going to feed? Invites
[2:02:32] his chosen people. Come and die
[2:02:37] with his mana he does feed and supplies

[2:02:56] You may feast at Jesus table all the
[2:02:59] time.
[2:03:02] Oh, he that fed the multitude
[2:03:05] turned the water into wine to the
[2:03:09] hungry. Are you hungry? Come and dine.
[2:03:13] There's no mana for the feast.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; There's no famine for the bride. Amen.
[2:03:22] Passer called to him. Come and

[2:04:13] hosts of heaven will assemble.
[2:04:18] Oh, it will be a glorious sight. All the
[2:04:22] saints in spotless white and with Jesus
[2:04:26] they will feast eternally.

[2:04:34] feed you will come and eat.
