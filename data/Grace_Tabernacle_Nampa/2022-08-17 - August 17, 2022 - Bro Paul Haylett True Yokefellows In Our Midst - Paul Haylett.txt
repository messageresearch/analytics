to be here tonight amen got a few folks that are I don't know brother Tim Miriam Oh Sister Mary you're right there I'm sorry I was looking over here but uh we want to remember each and every once not here tonight sister Carrie I think we'll just come pray for you amen come on brothers we're going to pray for our sister the devil he just doesn't get this privilege you know we posted the no trespassing sign but I guess he can't read so what we're going to do is just take the old-fashioned way and he wouldn't leave on his own so we're going to throw him out amen because he's just got no right to even be here he's got no right to come and squat on God's Property amen so we're going to just we're going to just send the devil away tonight amen Hallelujah Heavenly Father Lord we come before you tonight and father we come with a confidence not born of men but Lord born of your Holy Spirit within us that we as sons of God lord can come and father with confidence claim every promise Lord that's been given and Lord you already have given father healing to my sister and Lord we come and we're just here to declare to the devil you have no right and you have no authority over our sister and Lord we are asking now for a healing touch may your Holy Spirit flow through our sister's body and take this pain away from her back lord just give a relief to that and Lord may it become a testimony father of the healing power your grace and mercy and the hour we live in Satan you have no part with our sister we ask you kindly we don't want to be rude but just leave devil just leave you're not welcome here we claim this healing we Proclaim it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] well brother Keith I don't know that you could hide I I know we're not the most memorable people on Earth ourselves but I actually met you a couple times met you and Happy Valley many years ago and um met you at and there in Hickory uh when we were had the privilege to visit you and your wife uh sang a special you guys are definitely blessed and then you got some friends there in Hickory that send texts that say brother Keith headed your way and and they even added kind of I think there might have been a smiley face or something he's a good man so so you know brother Keith I think you're just loved amen so you know Saints I have an unspoken request if I name the family uh most of you or if not all of you would know them uh but it needs to remain as an unspoken request that um brother and sister is being taken to the courts by their own family now their family is not Believers and they are taking them to the courts and uh just uh ask that you would lift this unspoken request up before the Lord uh concerning some some issues there and I believe my brother and sister are correct I believe their family has got just a slight Spirit of vindictiveness about it so if you could just lift up this unspoken request I would appreciate that I would like to go to the font we've been on Wednesday nights here for a bit to thank you sister Emmy brother J Sean uh just always good and certainly appreciate our brother Keith those are beautiful songs I appreciate them um you know our present circumstances Saints you know we just look at this and realize from day to day you might say well this is my present circumstance you know some people live with afflictions In the Flesh and the Apostle Paul talked about these these Thorns that were in his flesh so we realize that as we go through life and these present circumstances that we face that God has already provided amen he is our provider it's already been provided oftentimes we get down and we say Lord I need you to do this but the word of God says the answer is already on the way and so we just want to you know just look at our present circumstance and realize that God's got it all in control and uh so we just want tonight to just take out of this scripture as we've been talking on the Yoke uh just love how the scripture brings this out and true yoke fellows in our midst and kind of an interesting thought isn't it but it's right in the scripture amen it's placed right there in the scripture and so let's just stand and we'll turn into Philippians 4 and uh tonight I think as we go along here uh you will recognize this scripture but I think sometimes we focus on certain portions we don't always focus on the whole and so tonight I just want to kind of bring this to you Philippians the fourth chapter verses 1 through 13. therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and Crown so Stand Fast in the Lord my dearly beloved these are these are terms of endearment Saints I beseech Judas and I beseech senses that they be of the same mind in the Lord and I entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the Book of Life now that is the kind of company we want to keep we want to be in the company The Fellowship of those whose names are in the book of life amen more specifically the Lamb's Book of Life amen we'll just uh let you be seated heavenly father I ask you to come tonight just open this make it real father must admit as I studied this seemed like I had a couple things that seemed to just hold me back but I asked for Liberty tonight Lord just to speak into the word of God father to be able to let the word just come alive in us Lord that we could walk out tonight and say was it not a truly wonderful to be in the house of God tonight Lord bless the Saints I pray each and every need amen you may be seated now yolk fellow here before we go on in this scripture I want to just lay this out yoke fellow has quite an interesting uh definition as you pair the two words and it's a a result it is an associate a companion a friend a buddy appear a helper so I entreat you also my associates oh my companions my friends my buddies my peers my helpers so we look at this quite a broad thought in the sense of of how it is describing these people that he is uh talking to and once again want to make this uh emphasis uh these are as as he's sharing this he's declaring these are people whose names are in the book of life amen that actually gets me very excited because you see I get to duplicate exactly what he was in that position tonight because I am here with those whose names are in the book of life amen we are not here as it were worshiping amongst the Heathen we are not worshiping some false god somewhere but we are worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ amen El Shaddai amen all of the definitive description descriptive names uh of uh our God Amen and here we are worshiping together amen excuse me I got kind of a dry tongue here tonight for some reason amen rejoice in the Lord alway again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand and I find it interesting my brother and sister that there is a lot of things that are lawful but they are not expedient there's a lot of things that that are not bad for us as long as we are in moderation you know as the prophet of God showed us we can do a lot of things too much but we can never pray too much so don't let the devil try to keep your prayer life in moderation amen but you look at this and be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God Amen I want to read that again because that really truly is a powerful verse right there be careful for nothing amen but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God on now my brother and sister there's a lot of things that we can ask for it's not what we're asking for but it's how we're asking and so we are not Beggars God did not call us to be Beggars you don't need to come to the throne as a beggar but you can come boldly to the throne and as we come with the right motive and the right objective the word of God says that he would answer our prayer he would speak to our hearts he would give us what we have need of so be careful for nothing now you know my brother and sister as we'll do I just want to deviate into this you see in the world we live in today people take these scriptures not just this one in particular but they take these scriptures and they pray for wealth and they pray for all kinds of things and actually find those things coming into their life but my brother and sister the reason that God can give to you the desires of your heart is because he knows your desires are not locked up here in a carnal layer to seeing World your desires are to come in the Kingdom in his presence that's what you desire as a True Believer amen so it's there that we we just know that we ourselves are the limiting factor of our prayers and stuff being answered be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding amen we can't comprehend my brother and sister what we need to do is just claim it just believe it just say Lord I need some peace in my life I need some peace in my family or whatever the circumstance might be don't try to figure out how God's going to bring that peace to you just claim that peace amen and wherever the holy spirit is there's peace my brother and sister and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus now my brother and sister I have this in bold letters verse 8 I would actually like you to read it with me because I think this as being a very commonly quoted scripture is actually a very very powerful scripture because you see my brother and sister the devil would like to come in now we have a a a a chalkboard in our garage and I need to read it more often because sometimes you know I don't take what I read there to heart and you know the prophet of God told told us don't let any negative thing come from your lips don't speak those negative things and you know uh uh sister Jerry just the other day she kind of comes up there you know in the deal and she's and I'm like what are you trying to say look brother and sister the devil sometimes he slips in so cleverly it just anoints us to just kind of speak negative things would you read this with me finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things now I want to ask you Saints not in a judgmental fashion but can we can we fulfill this scripture can we find enough things in our life amen to to fulfill that to uh is there true things in our life is there honest things is there just is there pure is there things that are lovely things of good report if there be virtue if there be praise we should not have to delegate or or go back into things that are of the negative nature and so we recognize the spirit of laodicea is there very common to influence us very present in the world we live in my brother and sister God did not take us out of this world in fact I love how he dealt with the uh the apostles that he brought them out he saves them he cleans them up and then turns right around and sends them right back out into the very world he drew them out of because you see that's how we're effective we're not effective hidden our hiding places in Christ it's not in some cave here on the Earth today but we are here to go back out into the world Amen and to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen verse 9 says those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and my powerful here seen in me now common denote uh comma denotes that space of time so he's giving a pause there and now he's telling us do those things don't just talk about it don't let it be something we hear about in the house of God but let these things be active let something be happening and the God of Peace shall be with you but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein you were also careful but you lacked opportunity may God add His blessings to the word I I believe this is a very positive verses that's why tonight I'm tying this into our thought uh very positive encouragement to the believer to bring us to a place to stand together now my brother and sister this body of Believers is separated by you might say time space and distance but this body of Believers is one body and there is a Unity that is brought forth in the day that we live in there is a Unity that is coming forth now I'm not I'm not told my just forget those things Paul amen so you see my brother and sister we're not looking for a man-made Unity there is uh opportunity people say we're we're trying to bring Unity into the message that brother and sister the real true Unity is not in this group we call the message but it is in the word of God it is the Holy Ghost himself that is now anointing Believers True Believers around the world right now anointed by the same Holy Spirit drawing us together one body of Believers amen and so it is a mini-membered body but still in spirit it is one body and so we stand together as as Believers around the world today the same Holy Spirit doesn't have a different gospel on the other side of the Earth but it is the same gospel and you know I shared with you here recently of of situations from my uh childhood and how that words that were preached to the young people and I don't know it might have caught some of you off guard I ask you you know these young people that heard this but they they ended up going and leaving and going away and I asked you what were they and I think some of you might have been surprised when I told you to see these people are backslid today not serving God and you might have been surprised when I said they were believers but you see they actually believed what was taught to them what was preached to them what was projected to them they actually believed that now imagine if it would have been that the gospel the true Gospel of Jesus Christ would have been preached to them in encouragement amen a standard raised up that they would be caught in the moment now we know that all things are according to the will of God but my brother and sister we don't know what the future is we're seeing around the world today people who have been away from the message for for periods of time I'll just leave it at that I know one up to 40 years and they're coming back and their their uh testimony is that they've been 40 years unhappy but God finally broke through the bitterness and and the wall the callous it was there and they've got to a point it's like what am I going to do and they just come and the Holy Spirit dealing with them and their thought is why don't I try Christ again you see it wasn't in a lot of cases it wasn't that our Lord Jesus Christ disappointed them it was how he was presented to them that was the false sight of that so we look at this and realize that we do not want to as a church as a Ministry we don't want to present Jesus Christ in a fashion that is discouraging but we want to present him in a fashion that is encouraging amen so when our young people or whoever it might be when they hear the word preach let them be Believers of the word that is preached to them let it be a word that is something they can take a holds of and know that God loves them not just loves them in word only but my brother and sister or God wants to pour His blessings pour His Spirit into them and it's up up to us you and I to create this atmosphere amen so there is these as we read this scripture there were these that were uh uh a true yolk fellow they were laborers that were were laboring amongst that and in this case he's speaking of of these sisters amen so as we bring forth a positive message which brings forth forth a positive life can we say Amen to that if we're hearing a positive message it will influence us to a positive life if it's presented that you may or may not make the Rapture then what you will dwell is in that cloud as our brother sang this song There Lord let me be Sanctified in what I say and do that you know some of us that are just uh uh a little more outspoken maybe or whatever you know that's something we need to hear to be encouraged that we can remain Sanctified and live this life and face every challenge that is in our daily life in our present circumstance but if we are told that we have failed and we hear that long enough you've all read about the monkeys and how that they put one in there and they wouldn't let it get the banana and then it went on until the monkeys themselves wouldn't let the new monkey even try to get to the banana so it is a behavior I'm not calling you monkeys but it's a behavior that's learned when you go into churches that worship my brother and sister and converts or people move into that church my brother and sister that one individual doesn't take worship away from that church the worship then becomes something that the new believer is pulled into because there's an influence there's a realm there and if you have that's not that same group but a similar group that doesn't worship at all you can have someone who's a worshiper come into that assembly and they will not be comfortable not worshiping but if they're not careful over time they will not lift their voice they will not lift their hands you will not hear the gospel as it were proclaimed from them as Worship in the service so it's there that we come and we bring forth an influence amen and I say we want to be true yolk fellow not woke fellow yoke fellow we don't want to be so sensitive about everything that if I'm worshiping God I think I better not because the people on the other side of the church might not want me to worship you imagine the message the devil's going to give to you every day of your life don't worship now the chickens might not like it but you see my brother and sister as fellow yoke fellows our job is to be helpers amen now to be a true yoke fellow one must be in or under the same burden remember the prophet of God's in Mexico and he's praying for that elderly man and he he uh you know some people say well anybody can kind of say that but my brother and sister when you get to the place that your spirit is groaning in your desire to help someone else your desire to make an impact in their life brother Brown saying my suit coat's too small my my shoes aren't big enough what can I do for this man but what I can do is I can pray for him I can enter into this spirit and groan in my spirit in true uh desire to see God move in that and sometimes it is in life my brother and sister we don't have enough money Tim packed or pull everybody out of their financial situation but we have enough prayers to we have more than enough prayers to make a difference but you see to be a fellow yoke fellow you have to be pulling in the same direction now if you've ever been around horses in your life that have been in tandem if you have one Desiring to go One Direction and one to go a different direction you find chaos you find a great struggle there so when he is speaking of this in this context my brother and sister he is actually has uh you might say an underspeak of there is unity in this body of Believers there is Unity that these Believers can pull together they can join together and go in the same direction with the same purpose that's true Unity that's not a Unity we can get by going and singing together it's not a Unity that we get by all slapping each other on the back after we have a breakfast that's not the kind of unity my brother and sister this is people who are be willing to be if I could just bring it in this fashion they're willing to be tied so close to another brother or a sister to sister to be able to say that whatever God leads we not I but we will follow amen that's where a body of believer starts to make an impact in the world around them is not when I believe God's leading me this way and another in the church says God's leading me this way so I guess we have two separate programs God's got one program amen God doesn't have multiple programs as it were if you follow me now you look at this so they must be pulling in the same direction now look at this my brother and sister I tried to this is a Wednesday night I'm trying to control myself from Old Habits but full adoption I believe you you'll catch this full adoption gives us the ability to be yoked to Christ and to one another without full adoption we cannot we will constantly have a struggle of the direction you'll see sometimes within a church there's a struggle part of the church wants to go this way part wants to go this way but there has to be something that binds that group of Believers together and that is when we in full adoption have the ability to stop and let God put the Yoke on not man's joke not the devil's joke God joke you can go study this maybe we'll speak again next Wednesday or so I don't know but look at this my brother and sister God's got a yoke he wants you to wear it's not like I've been delivered from the Yoke of the devil and now I'm free no God wants you to be yoked to him he wants you to go in parallel with him that means the direction he's going you're going what his desire is is your desire it's not Lord thy will be done and my will will be done but lord it's my will is your will and your will is my will that we can walk in tandem or parallel with our Lord Jesus Christ and not fight him not hide him you know years ago I hope this makes sense to you in in my thought years ago he's passed on now but there was a man had had a very large Ranch at that time it got broke up by inheritance but he had a very large Ranch and you know sometimes they could not uh uh it spanned from out here in the Hawaii's all the way to the Bruno Canyon we're talking about land that was so to speak his it's government ground but he he wrenched on that it went for a hundred miles south in the Hawaii's and they would sometimes take two three four years to go back and do a Roundup but he was the kind of man that when he did a Roundup every animal was going to go and he had this big old ox and he would catch these big old three and four-year-old steers that would not do it and they would tie them to that ox and so is that Ox Who Loved home they fed him grain at home they would tie this big old steer to that ox and then all he did is turn him loose and sometimes you know his children which I was friends with one of them he'd say Dad what do you think and he says well son don't worry about it it was a long ways out there and then one morning they would come and there at the water trough and the Corral at the ranch would be this ox well this big feisty believer I mean steer at that point whatever Direction the ox wanted to go this tear said I'm good with that amen sometimes God ties us to things because he knows what it's going to take to bring us to the place that we'll say Lord thy will be done not my will oh look even our lord Jesus learned by the things that he suffered oh how much more so my brother and sister that we of this human nature have got to come to a place that we can freely from our spirit say Lord thy will be done and we don't want to balk against the Yoke we don't want to fight against it it don't want to be a constant bottle of rebellion but God's looking for us to come to the place that we recognize I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I was meant to go this way and God's not going to lose me he's not going to take me halfway through the Wilderness and say well if you're going to keep kicking I'll just turn you loose but he said I purchased you and I will deliver you amen we ought to thank the Lord for that Hallelujah because some of us still every once in a while fight the yoke so we have to be pulling in the same direction you see the real believer and the make-believer will never be good yoke fellows together right the scripture says for us not to be unequally yoked you see because there's no way that we can be yoked to the unbeliever and look I'm talking in a spiritual context tonight there's no way we can be tied to the unbeliever and end up going in the same direction they'll either lead you away from the cross or you'll be leading them to the cross and my brother and sister if they're an unbeliever you know sometimes you read and we get this feeling like well Lord just you know kind of feel like you're just going to save everybody or kind of save all this no prophet of God comes along and says you know a mother ask a question will will my children be saved Stark reality Saints the prophet on one hand tells us apply the token claim them in the name of Jesus Christ and then a mother asks a question will my children be saved go study it out the prophet of God says they'll be saved if that's seed is in them a stark reality be hard for a mother to believe she bursts someone that didn't have the seed of God but a stark reality my brother and sister so you know no matter how good you know how many times you know the message had kind of a rash I hope it's went away but kind of a rash there you know that was going to have you know like a marriage conversion I'll marry this really cute boy that's not saved but you know over time I'm pretty sure that he wants to serve God he loves me you know and I love the Lord so surely they'll my brother and sister you you can't do that amen you can't because you're from the very get-go being yoked to something that wants to go a different direction vice versa young men young women so you look at this what God wants us to do if we're going to be yoked we got to be yoked to him first amen and then we become yoked as it is in marriage and business and all the rest of these things and fellowship in the body of Believers but we have to be yoked to Christ first and he's not going to lead you to be yoked to unbelief the prophet of God said he will never lead you away from his word amen so you see here it's not impossible for the wise we just heard this last week in some Ministry on the wise and the foolish it's not too impossible for the wise and the foolish to be truly yoked together I didn't say unbeliever Saints I said foolish you see their desire that they have as foolish virgin is not the same intensity it's not the same level of commitment it's not the same desire to search out the Deep things of God yes they've heard the message oh let me put this out there too some people believe the foolish virgin is the denomination out there but my brother and sister that is not close enough to make the scripture work the foolish virgins right in there amongst the message claiming they have a god-sent prophet come on I know that's a little straight but people say well no no that's someone else that's the devil lying to you because then you can lay down on the job amen you know uh go back to the ruble family you know they had a big old steer one time that uh just when that big old Ox started back towards the ranch that big old steer said huh you know what I'll just lay down and my friend Jerry says Dad how are we going to get that back they just laid down he said don't worry about his son it's not our problem we've turned it over and they had a name for the ox blue I think it was we've turned it over to Blue it's Blue's job two weeks later blue comes in the yard with this big old steer that's got the hide War off of him on every side you can imagine because he laid on his left he got drug on his left he laid on the right he got drugged on the right he put his knees down he got his knees skin amen he was skinned from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail and all blue was thinking there's grain ahead of me there's grain ahead of me I'm going home I'm going home amen I hope you catch the spiritual context amen otherwise you know it's there and if the foolish virgin as it were I'm not judging them we just want to keep the fire lit Saints we don't want to sit around and say well if God wants me to this pick up the word this is God speaking pick up the word Lord what do you want me to do he already told us Saints a Prophet come and set it all in order but it's right here for us to read after it was said in order it's still in front of us he didn't take it away he left it here and if we are supposed to be on fire don't let somebody else tell you it's okay to let the fire burn out once in a while no sir we're called to keep the fire lit all the time Hallelujah so it's nine to impossible for wise and foolish to be truly yoked together oh we share a common message but look at the world they share a common Bible and look at the disparity that's there does the wise and the foolish share a common commitment they want to serve God they want to be right in the eyes of God but the final step the final step the final effort it takes a Holy Ghost and Fire to bring this old flesh into commitment for the final step amen oh it's not something we can do Saints amen God's done great things in our midst I think every one of us could talk of the things that God has done but my brother and sister to realize that God is the one that is moving us forward God is the one that says not to stop here this is not your final resting place but you must keep pressing on and it's the Holy Ghost because when you quit last time yeah when you quit last time it wasn't a man that got you up it wasn't a woman that got you up it wasn't some great preacher that got you up it was a holy ghost amen and said you know what I'm yoke to you and I'm going back home amen I'm going back to my place and you are gonna go with me amen and I'm sorry to use such a simple country analogy but if you are skinned from head to toe you're still going God's not going to let you just sit on the side and languish away saying well I tried to help him he says that's my son that's my daughter that's my seed and I've never lost a seed I've never misplaced a seed I've never had a seed die on me and so you better get right up and I'm gonna put some life in you and we are going on Hallelujah I thank the Lord for that amen because I tell you some of us are a little more temperamental than others and when the temperamental type when they're High boy watch out get out of their way but when they're low you better watch out because they'll be shrapnel when they crash and God says but I don't care that's my still my seed whether you were high yesterday and you're low today or vice versa it doesn't matter you're my seed and I will make the way before you and I'll bring you to that place amen because I'm going to make you a yoke fellow who wants to be a yoke fellow Hallelujah he's going to make us be yoke fellows not by force my brother and sister but by that deposit of his own nature his own life his own desire that deposit down in US comes and it breaks through all of the the hard shell as it were that Satan's tried to put on you to keep you from breaking out and being who you're called to do and God just keeps pecking away and taking that amen and breaks it away until boom there we are and we say boy I wished I could have been this way years ago God's perfect in his time God's perfect in his time Saints amen now the foolish and the wise we can say on this that they share a common commitment but yet they don't because you see one was not committed to have oil until they realize the very key that would put them in the marriage supper is at the moment Saints let's not let's not lay around let's not just party as it were with the world until we hear the words the bridegroom coming see that's not what God wanted God wanted you and I to be on fire and when we saw that our oil was getting a little bit low oh you know some of us I I don't mean to inject myself into this but I'll just tell you the nature of how some of us are I run out of gas one time as a teenager and it's interesting because I wasn't really out of Gauss it's just the hill I was driving up it was so steep that the gas wasn't there to be sucked into the carburetor and so my dad looked me in the face after he'd come and rescued me and uh it's an interesting story you know uh actually the house I walked to went and knocked on the door a very fancy house knocked on the door the door opened as a girl I went to high school with I I wouldn't say that we were friends but we weren't enemies but she opens the door and she looks at me and goes what are you doing at my house yeah I'm wondering what am I doing my dad come and he put this and this is the point I really want to make my dad set me down and he said Son it costs just as much money to drive on the bottom of the fuel tank as it does the top of the fuel tank have you noticed you never see someone pulling the gas station and put two dollars worth of gas in a car that's got 7 8 of a tank of gasoline it is the human nature that when the needle has has quit bouncing at the bottom those of you that drive like that need to repent and I've got scripture to back it up keep it full keep it full Saints don't be in this desperation all the time oh Lord help me I O Lord Oh Lord oh no my brother and sister keep it full it doesn't cost you any more to keep it full than it does if you're bouncing it off the bottom keep it full but it's the nature of humanity that we drive and we drive I should stop now the fact that I had any of you remember Twinkies yes you know they're this thing that they say Will Survive a nuclear Holocaust they say you should store Twinkies because they will last a hundred years I'm sorry to admit with shame I used to be a Twinkie addict and my excuse to buy Twinkies was I got to stop put gas in my car regular fill it up almost every day I was maybe the guy two two bucks gotta top the tank off gotta have a reason to park right here and the Twinkies are only 10 steps away through that door then they actually put a little drive up service window there and when I was getting gas the older couple that owned it would open the window how many Twinkies do you want Paul hmm yeah pray that we would come into the house of God as such a spirit about us such a nature about us that the Holy Spirit would say my son my daughter is here for a refilling tonight we're going to have a good time in the house of God tonight because my sons and my daughters I know them I know their hearts desire I know their life and they are here tonight not just to go to church but they're here tonight regardless of how much is gone out of the cruise they are here tonight to refill it I want to be that kind of Christian that kind of believer that the Lord would know my heart and when I would come that the word of God he would anoint the preacher he would anoint a song leader he would anoint somebody singing a special song that it would anoint and we would say yes Lord yes I need a refilling tonight and some of the world the foolish would say what are you talking about there's barely any room yes Lord top it off fill it up Lord you see my point I'm trying to make there is we do but we don't share a common commitment because the foolish virgin went so far Saints as to the day they heard the voice behold the bridegroom cometh the scripture says that their lamp their vessel Cruise however you want to put this was empty it wouldn't sustain Flame so are you with me same commitment but not because one has this desire I must keep this full I must keep this lamp trimmed and clear so we look at this and I'm not trying to be harsh tonight you know that but will they share the same reward no no one got to get up and go with the bridegroom and the door is closed and one is searching for oil but can't find it because that is then in the season that when they were going to go buy oil it was not available amen how can we plagiarize the gospel though now in the message return in Jubilee brother Brown says a servant now I'll make a little shift here I hope you can shift with me a servant now remember a servant gets his reward or his wages but he was never to be free in the Jubilee I want you to catch this now there are people here and God's healing them God's answering prayers is that our reward we could get really technical couldn't we but it's truly not our reward that's not what we're living for right now we're not living to be healed we're not living to be blessed those are attributes that God pours out and manifests to us to show us that he is present and with us and fulfilling his promise amen God Is Bigger my brother and sister than his promise I heard the prophet say that the other day God is bigger than his promise in other words he doesn't have to labor to fulfill that promise he's bigger than the promise amen so this servant will never be free in the Jubilee no sir a servant was not free in the Jubilee that was not born in Israelite now look my brother and sister you'll catch this and I know you will but I just feel a need to elaborate just a little bit we did not become Sons and Daughters of God we always were right so we didn't get converted into this we were born into this amen so not freeing the Jubilee that was not born a Believer I mean an Israelite he had to be born in order to be free in the Jubilee He got His wages so as a servant gets his wages and many people get their rewards Jesus said about the Hypocrites said they have their rewards but you're different yes that's what Jesus was saying in John 8 about the Jews they said we are free and he said the servant does not abide in the house but when he gave them birth there was no longer they were no longer servants they were sons and joined heirs with him in the Kingdom that's the way the church is it's joint heirs with Christ in the Kingdom Heirs of all things to God through him amen and now we find that the church moved off the same direction that its forefathers moved in and the first organizations of the churches of churches it had been that way down Through the Ages but they were never never the servants will not be free come on I want that to soak in the servants will not be free they will not hear the word they will not believe the word the servants they heard the trumpets sound that priest riding through the land sounding this trumpet that every man was free sounded out throughout Liberty all out the lands and every man that was born to Jew knowed he could go back to his inheritance I don't care how far he was sold what happened he could go back because he was born in that house he was in his father's house born but the servant didn't know what he was doing see what's happening in the day my brother and sister we hear a lot of people I'm a Christian I'm a Christian I'm a Christian but you see without hearing the Jubilee which can be typed as the word for our hour that's what set us free was not the church my brother and sister it's the word of the hour is what set us free so we have heard the Jubilee call and because we are not servants we are Sons and Daughters we can respond and I say God help us to respond don't don't wait don't linger don't don't sit back to see what will happen this is God's promise to you and I amen they will not be free they'll never hear the word they will not believe the word the servants they heard the trumpet sound that priest riding through the lamb through the land my brother and sister we've heard it it's went through the land sounding this trumpet that every man was free sounded out throughout Liberty all out the lands and every man was born to do note he could go back to his inheritance oh I'm reading this again Saints this is not by accident I'm reading this on purpose to you I want you to catch this I don't care how far he was sold in that one of the devil's favorite tactics you've gone too far for God to forgive you or save you no that's a lie of the devil we can't go too far when we're Sons and Daughters of God might have been sold and resold and resold and resold and resold but when the Jubilee sounded and the Word was brought forward we are free amen amen we can take that word of God and stand on it ah Hallelujah because he was born in the house he was in his father's house but the servant didn't know what he was doing oh my now look at this there had to be there had to be something that caused these people to respond I was born in the message pretty common phrase to hear in the day and age we live in we've got a young people here tonight born in the message won't get you any further down the road than anyone else but Born Into The Kingdom the road might be Rocky but you know what God will do he'll send some of those fellow servants as they were also referred to and they'll somehow just come up beside you you say oh I credit brother so and so sister so and so for helping me in on my hard times do you know that was actually Christ just walking in flesh it's amazing to me in the world we live in and the time and how much of the word's been revealed that people still would balk at the idea that God has come down and stepped into flesh and is here and it's my brothers my sister I call him brother Trevor I call him whoever but it's Christ it's Christ no man can get us through this no sister can get us through this but Christ is there what is this my brother and sister these are as it is some of this that we are speaking of here these are yoke fellows amen they're your brothers your sisters your companion your friend buddy peer helper but they are there because God in them is leading them to do this God is leading and guiding inspiring to do this it's not they themselves you say these are good people they help everyone my brother and sister we need more than a free lunch both of them were working for the same Master sold under sin many of Pentecostal tonight has sold the same way O Brother return go back to your original inheritance all of your yours turn and go back it's time to go back he that now the Heathen slave could not do that he didn't know nothing about it after all a heathen means an unbeliever an unbeliever in the word many of them will take dogmas and rituals and Creeds of the church instead of listening to the real word and when the real word sounds itself out right because this Living Word is the person of Jesus Christ amen and so when this sounds out they don't know what you're talking about I'm sure that you've experienced that when you go to witness of the Lord Jesus Christ and people say I don't have a clue I don't even I really don't even want to know they don't know what you're talking about they want to call you a Holy Roller they want to call you like they did the forefathers 50 years ago in Louisiana crazy like it was back in the days of Paul in the way of heresy that's the way I worship the god of my forefathers now sorry this is a lengthy quote but I'm not sorry because I I thought it was very good see the Heathen don't know nothing about it I want to ask you tonight do you know something amen we're not heathens we know something why is it because the Holy Ghost has come down and revealed amen this word to us and when Christ is revealed to us my brother and sister we can never be the same the prophet of God said the Bible becomes a brand new book oh it's not for us to read between lines to boast of but we read between the lines because we are seeing not just a God but our God Amen the Lord Jesus Christ is there in the word reaching out to us and by God's grace we can see that amen unbeliever makes him a heathen it was only for the elected God's chosen that's the way it is today come on God's chosen we're not talking history here tonight Saints we're talking about our day amen Our lives our children our families our marriages we're talking about all of this that pertains to us right now amen not him that runeth or him that willeth it's God that has Mercy it's God that does it God by his grace Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him that's what's been happening the whole time isn't that amazing oh you know like I said the last time you quit yeah you might have been laying prostate I can't prostrate uh you can't take a pill for this you might have been just laying flat out give up give out whatever God's there he's just keeps Paulie drawing us and along the way we say I don't know oh how did you get delivered from from those cigarettes or from that alcohol or whatever it is well God's got a 42-step plan and I followed it to the letter no sir go to church just read a lovely testimony man went to church not a church going man the night before he'd been in a bar drunk goes to church tried to quit smoking but instead of quitting it got worse he went from smoking a few cigarettes today to smoking three to four packs a day goes to church gets up the next morning and he starts looking around grabs a cigarette packs shakes a cigarette out holding it in his fingers and he said I'm disgusted never picked it up again well we can explain that his iron level and the sulfur and the blah blah blah in his blood caused the smell of the tobacco to you know yeah for sure yeah no man can come to me except my father draws him all the father has given me will come to me it's God's grace that he chose the church before the foundation of the world that church will hear the word of God now I hope tonight I'm talking to that church I'm quite positive I am they'll turn every Creed down they'll turn every organization every denomination that's contrary down and they'll serve God by the power of the Holy Ghost amen they certainly know the trumpet sound my sheep hear my voice what are you talking about the word you say that's god's voice I say that's god's voice amen and that voice has been speaking to us my brother and sister and there has been a bride that is responding amen but look this yoke fellows are hearing the same voice it wasn't just the preacher the prophet of God talked about that we don't need just an anointing clergy we need an anointed body to receive the word not just people sitting there under that inspiration of anointed clergy oh they're so great they're so great they have such Spirit the body of Believers the fellow yoke fellows are anointed and hearing that same voice and then we come under that anointing and we start lifting up those around us we start becoming of a service to the body in other words we could go and we could go home and we could say what is the things in my life amen it might not hurt you to do this what is the things in my life that I want God to do write them out on a page and then put that page over there and say Lord anoint the body of Believers to pray for those needs and then take another page and write the needs of the body of Believers down and you pray for these and God will anoint the Believers to pray for the needs of your own life it will Works my brother and sister but you know the human nature we write the list of our needs down and we pray over our needs when we should be praying for the body we are not yoke fellows when we're praying for ourself where yoke fellows when we're praying for one another to lift up the body of Believers because you see God knows your need and then God anoints those in the body to recognize your need also have you ever notice some Believers will just never they just never never will bring up their struggle you won't hear a single word about their struggle well I'm too spiritual I don't want to no you're not really a yoke fellow is what you you're holding if you don't mind me saying it your card's so close to your chest but I tell you when the scripture said confess your faults one to another they're not talking about the chip in the paint and the hood of your pickup not talking about the fact that you made a five cent error in balancing your checkbook it's time for the body of Believers to say I go to church Lord with servants I go to church with yoke fellows I go to church where those people that their whole heart's desire is to lift the body of Christ up it's not there to cut it down it's not well if I confess what's happening in my life people won't respect me any longer not if you go to church with real Believers amen I want to go to church with real Believers amen I want the Holy Ghost as it were now this I'll sound bad and I I don't know how to say it any other way I if the if the unbeliever is coming to church with us and he's negative and he's going to look at your faults and make a deal out of it I pray somehow they get offended and leave now some of you say brother Paul that's just horrible but remember the prophet of God preached on those contrary spirits moving he speaks of it this little lady with cancer now brother Ron Spencer had put it this way that old dumb devil but look what happened the prophet of God's praying for that lady he's got cancer and that Spirit starts crying out to another spirit all it did was expose that there was another lady over here needed deliverance from this same thing if that devil had had any sense he'd abduct under the pew and and put his hands over his head and just tried to wait it out but you see his buddy because the devil's got his own yoke fella he's got his own little group brother Brown says he's got his own little church in all the officers for that church they'll turn every organization every denomination contract down turn it down done why because his sheep hear his voice amen what is God doing he's telling his joke fellow pray for this now I'm getting fixed in the clothes here sister would you just come amen you see my brother and sister there's there's something as we look at this we recognize it's a lot of voices in the messages they're not which one you're going to listen to so and so so-and-so or so and so or so and so or so and so or the word I think we ought to all get back to giving the preachers the word test oh no that's not confronting them at the back door and tell them you think you mispronounced that sister's name that the scripture that you started the service with you know I tried to look that up and there's even a deal on the computer pronounce that name and my computer froze when I typed that name in there to see if I could figure out how to pronounce it and the computer froze and just went into the pinwheel and I was like even the computer can't pronounce that name but God knows who I'm talking about you see what do we do we give the word test to the preacher like I said that's not meeting him at the back door and telling everything you didn't like that's where oh this might seem like I'm tricking you and I'll be honest out front it kind of Almost Is I'm going to give tonight the preacher the word test I'm gonna take everything he said when I get home tonight back to the word of God we'll see if he's telling the truth or not [Music] well you know what happens when people do that they come out of there invigorated and motivated and delivered and revelated and how many more words I can do the whole time they're given the preacher the word test the word is working mightily in them and you know if you've got a good Holy Ghost filled preacher you'll not find air as it were oh no let's not get to the point that pronunciation do you catch that brother Daniel he mispronounced several words the other day I just almost shut down on him I was almost like if he can't pronounce these words in the Bible correctly I'm not listening to him said no real believer ever foreign so we have this degree of tolerance as it were for the humanity but everything else has to match the word and as we dig in the word to prove it proves in us the very Life of Christ because we respond to what we study to what we read what we feed on Amen as I said before remember the old deal you know parents used to give this to us all the time you are what you eat well I'll tell you what spiritually brother and sister we are what we oh let's crave let's get a diet let's consume the word amen let's take the word you know I'm still not over brother Stevens deal let's be daringly foolish to pursue the leadership of the Holy Ghost daringly foolish to step out of our own security and accept the word of God you know Galatians 6 9 says let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity and you'll find that God affords you a lot of opportunities let us do good into all men now my brother and sister that wasn't if they're related to me or they go to my church or they go to my church and I like them it was all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith oh my brother and sister how we should be lifting up supporting [Music] if not indeed in prayer those in our own assembly and those of the body of Believers around the world we should be lifting them up strengthening them not having to be reminded that there's a need somewhere not having to have it be as it were on a screen or a special deal but when we hear it I like there's some amongst us they have their prayer list it's good for us that are over a certain prescribed age to have lists if you can remember where you put them but you know I think it'd be good maybe we start our prayer list to make sure that sometimes these little needs are sister Souls our sisters in Norway that we're in that tragic wreck God by his grace and mercy uh just preserve them sometimes little things that happen just kind of slide off of our thinking Lord help us to be those fellow that are there Dependable standing lifting up praying for [Music] do you know that Galatians 6 is a unrecognized Ministry I want you to think about it Saints it's not just scripture it's a Ministry irregardless of age or gender or office this is a Ministry for all of us this is a Ministry by which we can each one Excel Hallelujah okay I have one more I'm going to skip over that right there I've got one more I just want to share with you Satan's eating this is not in my thought I just was reading have been reading Satan's Eden and I just like this thought it was a good quote I wanted to speak to you something to bring something to Enlighten you the promise of God for this age see something not something that somebody else was in some other day but something and when when them things are all right we all refer to those things but I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I got written here that would Enlighten you to know and make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now what field you're fighting in [Music] it's the one you're in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you see that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can I just encourage you Saints just take this I kind of pluck this out of Satan's Eden but you see we have the answer to the Satan's question we have an answer to his desire we have the answer to all these things [Music] just take the word defend yourself with the word that will cause you to become a yoke fellow because you will read in the word I respond to that and God doesn't give this to us just to give it to us he gives these things to us for purpose so take the word you get the inspiration you have someone come on your heart don't say oh that's good I'm thinking about brother or sister so and so God didn't do that for you just to let it slide away stop pray you wake up in the middle of the night I don't say this boastfully Saints but I woke up it actually led to a very very bad day on Tuesday for me I was just extremely tired I woke up at 2 15 in the morning I could not go back to sleep I hope you all don't mind that I prayed for you over and over and over again I hope that's not offensive to anyone that if I couldn't sleep I was at least going to beat the devil up while I was laying there in bed you see we have the answer but I don't believe God lets us stay awake just so we get up in the morning and say I had a bad night and I actually don't want to apologize and I said I had a bad night I actually had a really good night because I prayed from that into the valley to that end of the valley I prayed from that direction to that direction and I did my very best to cover everything in the middle because I realized if I can't sleep if I just lay here and let my mind wander I'm just wasting my life so I'm going to just make a difference let's make a difference let's be fellow yoke fellas let's join together every group of Believers now we don't want this we have a visitor tonight he won't

time of our trouble Lord you should move amongst your bride stirring her heart making her hungry Lord making her thirsty putting in her a desire to refill the oil [Music] a desire to go back to the

another God bless you pray for one another Saints we're living in an hour that Satan would desire to do anything he could throw just a little bit of sand throw a little something a little circumstance break the unity in the harmony but I tell you as we as fellow Servants of almighty God will come Unity of the word full adoption to Christ the devil won't find it comfortable to be in church with us he'll find himself with no place to hide he'll find himself a no person to hide in you know he's just talking about this the other day a little subject the prophet of God says you know if you could just look around those theaters I trust none of us have been hanging out in those kind of places the prophet of God you read that quote and you think about it you won't want to hang out there he says because those demons are hanging in the rafters and hanging along those walls those demons in there just wait to get on someone well you know what brother Paul that's a bad note to leave us leaving church now I got a good note for you the angels are here with us angels are all about us the word says they surround us wherever we go they're with us hallelujah I think I'd rather walk with the angels and walk with the Devils amen so let's just make a commitment to pray for one another walk as it were with the angels call on the Lord for the needs of this body God bless you brother Keith
