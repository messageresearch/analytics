[33:11] know she was part of the layoffs uh
[33:14] she's been with the company I'm with now
[33:16] for over a decade and she was just
[33:19] another number on a chart somewhere so
[33:21] she has a a family and she's also not a
[33:25] citizen so she goes back once once a
[33:27] year to India so I don't know how this
[33:28] is going to affect them and visas and
[33:30] everything so you know I told her we I'd
[33:33] keep her in her prayers and it's
[33:35] interesting company I work for is very
[33:37] liberal we stream so I won't say who but
[33:41] and uh it's funny no matter who you tell
[33:43] I'm praying for you they always receive
[33:45] it with
[33:48] gladness everybody knows at the end of
[33:50] the day amen if you have your Bibles
[33:52] tonight
[33:54] musicians thank you brother Paul
[33:57] let's turn to Revelations chapter
[34:01] 19 I wanted
[34:05] uh to continue on this thought of the
[34:08] battle of the
[34:12] Twins and um Sunday as I was sitting
[34:16] there in the
[34:17] back the thought came on to my heart
[34:21] and very strongly it's been
[34:25] it's how it how it how a thought
[34:29] comes to me
[34:31] anyways um it's always there it's always
[34:34] God but it was almost like God said in
[34:36] an audible voice so I have expectations
[34:39] tonight that the Lord's going to
[34:41] minister to to us and you know the
[34:43] devil's fought tooth and nail
[34:46] but I find when the devil is most
[34:49] nervous God speaks the most direct to us
[34:53] so Revelations Chapter 19 Verse 6
[34:57] and I heard as it were the voice of a
[34:59] great multitude and as the voice of many
[35:01] Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[35:04] thunderings saying Allelujah for the
[35:06] Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad
[35:10] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[35:13] the marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[35:15] wife hath made herself ready thank you

[35:20] be a raid in fine linen clean and white
[35:23] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[35:26] of saints
[35:28] Genesis chapter
[35:35] 4 from Genesis
[35:37] Revelations hopefully we won't be long
[35:40] tonight Genesis
[35:46] 4:3 and in the process process of time
[35:50] it came to pass that Cain brought of the
[35:52] fruit of the ground and offering unto
[35:55] the Lord and Abel also brought of the
[35:58] fruit of the ground and offering unto
[36:00] the Lord excuse me and Abel he also
[36:04] brought of the first things of his flock
[36:06] and of the fat thereof and the Lord had
[36:08] respect unto Abel and to his offering
[36:11] but unto Cain and and to his offering he
[36:13] had no respect and Cain was very wroth
[36:18] and his countenance
[36:20] fell the Amplified says he was very
[36:23] annoyed had a look of annoyance on his
[36:25] face amen let's pray Heavenly Father
[36:29] Lord we ask that you just come and speak
[36:31] to our hearts tonight
[36:33] Lord these words on the page mean
[36:36] nothing unless your life is behind them
[36:38] so Lord I I don't want my opinions
[36:40] behind them my own personal thoughts I
[36:43] want
[36:44] your presence your anointing your
[36:49] inspiration to be everything that backs
[36:50] up the words to be said tonight Lord we
[36:54] it's not me here Lord you have something
[36:57] to say every every time we come to
[36:59] church you have something specific to
[37:00] say to us Lord and we want to be
[37:03] attentive to that Lord we want to pay
[37:05] attention to that Lord Jesus for your
[37:07] words are live and if we can hang on to
[37:09] those words we can find ourselves
[37:11] growing in the life of Growing With The
[37:14] Life of Christ so I pray you just
[37:16] minister to our hearts tonight bless
[37:17] those that couldn't be here with us
[37:19] tonight may be with him we ask we love
[37:21] you Lord and thank you in Jesus name we
[37:23] pray amen you may have your seats
[37:25] tonight
[37:28] so my thought like I said I wanted to
[37:31] continue on the battle of the Twins and
[37:34] um I wanted to take the thought of the
[37:36] two altars now when when I begin to
[37:41] uh think about this um I think more
[37:46] along the lines of the altars you know
[37:48] Cain and Abel had the altars
[37:51] but I I I I realize that there's there's
[37:55] uh there's the an altar holds more
[37:58] layers than just the
[38:01] sacrifice of an animal or sacrifice in
[38:04] our hearts the altar is the place you
[38:07] get
[38:09] married and uh so I'd like to take kind
[38:11] of that angle tonight but the Lord help
[38:14] us as we kind of lay out a foundation
[38:16] here so in Hebrews 11:4 we read that by
[38:19] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[38:20] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[38:24] he obtained witness that he was
[38:25] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[38:28] and by it he being dead yet
[38:33] speaketh so Abel had something Cain
[38:36] didn't have they both had the the altar
[38:39] they both had a sacrifice but
[38:42] Abel had the right sacrifice because
[38:45] Abel had something Cain didn't have and
[38:48] Cain couldn't get though he was given
[38:51] the opportunity he couldn't get it so
[38:54] same altar different sacrifice
[38:57] uh and this is from the Amplified
[38:59] version 1 John 3:12 and not be like Cain
[39:02] who was of the evil one and murdered his
[39:04] brother Abel and why did he murder him
[39:07] because Cain's Deeds were evil and his
[39:09] brothers were righteous
[39:11] so last time we spoke we talked about we
[39:15] kept with the same thought the battle of
[39:16] the Twins and we talked about how we
[39:19] need opposition and and the flesh is the
[39:23] evil twin right and the righteousness of
[39:26] the Holy spirit is able within us or set
[39:29] because we don't want it dying right
[39:32] and we need it we need that opposition
[39:36] for us to grow in character of Christ
[39:39] because without it without a sickness
[39:41] there's no healer without there's no
[39:43] need of a Healer without a loss there's
[39:45] no need of Saving right so we need this
[39:47] opposition it's what gives us the
[39:48] strength so the flesh is actually our
[39:50] Ally in a way because it's it's the
[39:53] battle with that is what increases our
[39:56] faith
[39:57] and so here we have we have the Canan
[40:00] Abel controversy the can and
[40:03] Abel you know hit the front news Cain's
[40:07] murdered his brother Abel right this
[40:10] this moment in time boils down to two
[40:13] things Cain's Deeds were evil and Abel's
[40:17] were righteous so at the Bare Bones it's
[40:21] Evil versus righteousness and this idea
[40:24] this subject carried through the
[40:26] scripture there's many many examples of
[40:30] this battle of the Twins and this quote
[40:33] here in questions and answers on Hebrews
[40:35] part three he says now watch Cain's
[40:38] children were always and before the anti
[40:41] the lovian destruction they were the
[40:44] smart people footnote I I edit the
[40:46] quotes so they're readable so if you
[40:48] can't find them because I edited it you
[40:51] just come to me and we'll set it
[40:53] straight they were the smart people the
[40:55] scientists the educ Educators and very
[40:57] religious but was The Condemned bunch I
[41:00] I don't change the quote
[41:02] though take out the stutters and very
[41:06] religious but was The Condemned Bunch
[41:08] see now watch they were just like their
[41:10] father Cain Cain he was a religious
[41:13] man he built a beautiful Altar and made
[41:16] a beautiful church and tried to make it
[41:18] look prettier than that little mission
[41:20] that Seth had down there did you know
[41:23] that he decorated the altar with flowers
[41:25] and fixed it beautiful and made it
[41:27] pretty and made a great big swell church
[41:29] because he thought that he could find
[41:31] favor with God by doing so so he he had
[41:33] the right
[41:35] desires he had the right desires but he
[41:37] executed it incorrectly and Abel went
[41:40] over same same message went over and got
[41:42] a little lamb and started pulling it
[41:44] over to the Altar and laid it on a rock
[41:47] and killed it and now if God being just
[41:50] if all he required was worship Cain
[41:52] worshiped god with just as much
[41:54] sincerity as Abel did right both of them
[41:57] were sincere both of them was trying to
[42:00] find Grace With God they were neither
[42:02] one of them infidels they were both
[42:05] absolutely Believers in
[42:07] Jehovah now there that gives us
[42:10] something to think of so right down to
[42:14] the end of it TW we have these
[42:18] twins even from birth they were SE and
[42:21] and Cain had
[42:24] everything that Abel had but the secret
[42:28] ingredient right and so if we could
[42:30] break down what happened there um there
[42:34] at when Cain had his Cain enable we have
[42:37] this showdown here uh first of all they
[42:39] both built an
[42:41] altar okay the altar wasn't the
[42:45] problem the sacrifice was the problem so
[42:48] they both had an altar they both had a
[42:50] sacrifice they both went through the the
[42:51] same general motions right Cain didn't
[42:54] murder a watermelon um but he still went
[42:57] through the same motions of gathering
[42:58] the fruits and the vegetables or however
[43:00] that he did it and he laid that out
[43:02] there and and he was giving the fruits
[43:03] of his labor and Abel was giving the
[43:05] fruits of his labor because Abel was a
[43:08] Shepherd so there was a sacrifice given
[43:10] one was accepted one was rejected oh I
[43:13] am sorry that is terribly small um one
[43:15] was accepted one was rejected and and
[43:17] then and then there was this dialogue
[43:19] with God
[43:20] now we we we we only read of the
[43:23] dialogue that Cain had but Abel had
[43:25] dialogue with God
[43:26] Abel had a relationship with God he had
[43:29] communion with God so there was this
[43:31] ongoing uh communication between him and
[43:34] God because he knew what God expected in
[43:36] the sacrifice then we have Evil versus
[43:39] righteousness so we have the two right
[43:41] now we have we see the manifestation in
[43:43] Cain up to that point we don't know if
[43:45] Cain ever manifested evil in that way he
[43:48] could have been act in the same way as
[43:51] Abel but then it came down to this point
[43:53] and and uh how many how many times did
[43:56] they sacrifice if you read scriptures as
[43:59] it is it seems like this is the first
[44:01] time so who knows the history here but
[44:03] we still have this this this moment
[44:05] where evil is vers versus righteousness
[44:08] because Cain's Deeds were evil and
[44:11] Abel's were righteous right we read that
[44:12] in the scriptures and then judgment was
[44:14] delivered
[44:15] Cain in this story Cain murders Abel and
[44:21] um then there was judgment passed to him
[44:23] from God and and Cain said says this
[44:26] judgment is is too much for me to handle
[44:29] so God puts a mark upon him a mark is
[44:32] given to him but then Cain goes off and
[44:36] and now we have down through history we
[44:38] have the war and then Cain mixed right
[44:41] with uh the the the sons of God saw the
[44:43] daughters of men but in that moment God
[44:47] God righteousness was
[44:50] resurrected so Abel dies and his blood
[44:52] cries from the ground Cain is judged
[44:54] he's marked at cuz he says hey it's too
[44:57] much for me to bear and God says I'll
[44:58] mark you anybody who kills Cain will be
[45:01] cursed and so but then the story doesn't
[45:05] stop there Seth Seth is righteousness
[45:09] resurrected he is the next son right
[45:12] Seth is born and from then then we have
[45:15] you know the lineages on down and if you
[45:17] read it backwards which was the son of
[45:19] Seth which was the son of Adam which was
[45:21] the son God so righteousness was
[45:23] resurrected so if you break this this
[45:26] this this battle here that down and and
[45:29] this is what you get a nice bullet
[45:31] pointed list and we all love bullet
[45:32] points right and um this same pattern uh
[45:37] manifests itself in our own lives
[45:39] manifests itself in the battle that we
[45:41] face in in the in the the battles
[45:44] between evil and righteousness the
[45:46] battles between the Twins down through
[45:48] through history and so you know you have
[45:51] to have the right sacrifice so now let's
[45:54] let's step from there there we've laid
[45:56] out the the situation between the two
[45:58] altars because that's what we're talking
[46:00] about and and and now we've abstracted
[46:03] this this pattern of of laid out here
[46:07] and so let's take that and now let's
[46:09] step into that if we can tonight so you
[46:11] must have the right sacrifice and in the
[46:13] marriage of the Lamb brother bam says
[46:15] Jesus's bride is not a dirty bride he
[46:17] wouldn't have a dirty bride a woman come
[46:19] up to get married she looked like she
[46:21] come out of the pig pin out there a man
[46:23] that's got any dignity about him
[46:25] wouldn't marry her he'd make her clean
[46:27] herself up and when the Church of Christ
[46:30] comes up to get married thinks she's
[46:32] going in the bride with all the world
[46:34] tagging on to her Christ's bride won't
[46:36] be like that no
[46:38] sir neither is the Church of Christ of
[46:41] the Lord Jesus Christ that church is not
[46:44] a ragged church either which with worn
[46:47] out Rags of denominations she don't have
[46:50] to be a member of some great
[46:52] denomination she has to be Blood Washed
[46:54] Blood Bought not saying we belong to the
[46:58] biggest church the biggest organization
[47:00] or this that or without spot or wrinkle
[47:03] by the blood of her Savior Jesus Christ
[47:06] so now how does this quote fit in okay
[47:08] so so Cain and and Abel both had altars
[47:11] they both built altars but it was it was
[47:13] Abel's sacrifice so now in in in in in
[47:16] the Christian walk we come to an altar
[47:20] we must lay our lives down we must
[47:21] submit our our will we must we must
[47:23] surrender to Christ who is there
[47:26] asking will you come will you come and
[47:28] be one with me and there's a process up
[47:31] to that point but when it comes time for
[47:34] for the ceremony to take place and you
[47:37] are sacrificing your own will to Christ
[47:42] you must be the proper
[47:44] sacrifice so if you come straight out of
[47:48] the world and you keep the world on you
[47:50] you keep the dirtiness of the world on
[47:52] you you come to the altar God will not
[47:54] accept your sacrif sacrifice he won't
[47:57] accept people say I've tried and and God
[48:00] just won't do anything but there the
[48:03] sacrifice they're presenting is not the
[48:06] right sacrifice it'll be the same flesh
[48:09] you'll see the same person the same
[48:10] color eyes the same color hair but the
[48:13] time when God receives them they are in
[48:16] a position and they are ready to be
[48:18] sacrificed you know the the if you look
[48:21] at at the at the pattern of the
[48:23] Tabernacle in the wilderness and uh the
[48:25] temple worship ship the sacrifice had to
[48:27] be clean and had to be certain you know
[48:29] with the the right lamb and everything
[48:31] and and even Christ himself had to be
[48:33] prepared and be the right sacrifice on
[48:35] the cross so when it comes down to the
[48:37] point where God is is here to accept you
[48:40] as part of himself so that the two
[48:42] become one you must be the right
[48:44] sacrifice that is why you must be
[48:46] justified and
[48:47] Sanctified so that you're in the Bri
[48:50] position you know that young lady that
[48:52] the the the the rich man from the from
[48:54] the East comes out West and he finds her
[48:57] why did why a whole year she had to have
[48:59] time to prepare herself go he chose her
[49:02] he saw the potential that she had as a
[49:05] wife God saw the potential while we were
[49:08] yet sinners Christ died for us so while
[49:10] you were filthy while you were dirty God
[49:12] saw in you a bride but you still had to
[49:16] be washed he looked at Cain he said Cain
[49:19] I'll accept your sacrifice if you do
[49:20] what able did if you come the right way
[49:24] I will accept your sacrifice why is that
[49:26] in the scriptures God knew Cain wouldn't
[49:28] accept it we know Cain wouldn't accept
[49:30] it so why did God put that there because
[49:33] that is the point you have the choice
[49:36] you have the potential but you must come
[49:38] to that position where you surrender
[49:40] where you are a proper sacrifice for the
[49:43] ceremony of being married to to Christ
[49:47] so there's a lot of time there's a lot
[49:49] of things that have to be done and many
[49:51] times we we meet people who are in this
[49:54] point in this journey and we can
[49:55] understand why they're acting the way
[49:57] they're acting and it's simply because
[49:59] they're in that they're in that stage
[50:02] they're
[50:03] transitioning from
[50:06] sanctification to receiving Christ as
[50:08] their
[50:09] husband they're they're they're in the
[50:11] church they're Christians they're I
[50:13] don't know why we're going this
[50:14] direction they're Believers they're
[50:15] serving God they have the potential to
[50:18] be accepted as Christ's
[50:21] beloved before the foundation of the
[50:23] world he saw them as his beloved but in
[50:25] that position they're not a they're not
[50:27] a pure sacrifice just
[50:31] yet right in Matthew 22:8 turn there
[50:36] with me if you
[50:44] will Matthew 22 so this is the
[50:49] parable of the wedding
[50:54] feast
[50:57] made a marriage for his son
[51:00] now can we all agree
[51:03] that we on this side of
[51:07] Glory must receive the seed of
[51:11] Christ therefore we are married to
[51:13] Christ so the marriage of the Lamb has
[51:17] happened right y amen where does that
[51:22] put this Parable
[51:24] then this Parable doesn't happen in
[51:26] glory no nobody is going to appear in
[51:29] glory without the right garment on right
[51:32] this is happening right now the Kingdom
[51:35] of
[51:36] Heaven let's go back up to verse two the
[51:39] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain
[51:40] King which made a marriage for his
[51:43] son and sent forth his servants to call
[51:46] them that were bidden to the wedding and
[51:48] they would not come again he sent forth
[51:50] other servants telling tell them which
[51:53] are bidden behold I have prepared my
[51:55] dinner my oxen and my fatlings are
[51:56] killed and all things are ready right
[51:59] first pull second pull come into and all
[52:03] things are already come unto the
[52:04] marriage but they made light of it and
[52:06] went their ways one to his farm another
[52:09] to his merchandise and the remnant took
[52:11] his servants and intreated them
[52:12] spitefully and slew them when the king
[52:14] heard thereof he was wroth and he sent
[52:16] forth his armies and destroyed those
[52:18] murderers and burned up their City then
[52:20] saith he to his servants the wedding is
[52:22] ready but they which were bidden were
[52:24] not worthy go you therefore into the
[52:26] highways and as many as you shall find
[52:29] bid to the marriage so these are the the
[52:32] the people who are not so clean these
[52:36] are the people who are spending their
[52:37] times in the pig pins so in order for
[52:39] them to come to this marriage something
[52:41] has to happen and when the king came in
[52:43] to see the guest he saw there a man
[52:46] which had not on a wedding garbage so
[52:48] this man at at the the altar if you will
[52:52] but his sacrifice is wrong his sacrifice
[52:54] is dirty dirty his sacrifice isn't clean
[52:57] he's not in the right position and he
[53:00] says unto him friend how camest thou in
[53:02] thither not having a wedding garment and
[53:04] he was speechless then said the king to
[53:06] the servants bind him hand and foot and
[53:08] take him away and cast him into outer
[53:10] Darkness there shall be weeping and
[53:11] nashing of teeth for many are called but
[53:14] few are chosen so I can't begin to say I
[53:18] understand everything about this Parable
[53:20] but let's let's just pull out an
[53:22] important piece here in the wedding
[53:24] supper but said says and the King's son
[53:26] the bridegroom stood at the door to
[53:27] receive the invitations and each one
[53:30] that come with an invitation the
[53:31] bridegroom received the invitation and
[53:34] the father had given the invitation no
[53:37] man can come to me except right come to
[53:39] the father said come by me he came and
[53:42] handed it to the bridegroom the
[53:43] bridegroom in return put a robe on
[53:45] everyone that come in as
[53:47] identification as a proper sacrifice oh
[53:50] my put a robe on everyone that's good or
[53:52] bad rich or poor all looked alike now
[53:55] this this robe is none other than the
[53:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the
[53:59] robe he says in a type the robe that
[54:02] Elijah which was the old Prophet a type
[54:04] of Christ Elisha that followed him
[54:06] succeeded him was the type of the church
[54:09] for Elijah done four I believe out might
[54:12] have been eight or eight four or eight I
[54:15] don't know for sure now outstanding
[54:17] Miracles and Elisha the church asked for
[54:20] a double portion of his Spirit a double
[54:22] portion and he said keep your eyes
[54:24] towards heaven then and if you see me
[54:27] when I go up you will have it and as
[54:29] Elijah was caught up in a whirlwind a
[54:31] cloud of fire and was received out of
[54:34] the sight of Elisha Elijah threw back
[54:37] his robe and Elisha put it on and walked
[54:40] down to the Jordan and struck it said
[54:43] where is the god of Elijah and done
[54:46] twice as many miracles as Elijah did
[54:48] Jesus told the church these things that
[54:50] I do shall you also and More Than This a
[54:54] double portion of this and they went out
[54:56] to the day of Pentecost scared powerless
[54:59] helpless and waited after the Ascension
[55:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ and he threw
[55:04] back sent down from heaven the very same
[55:07] power the very same robe that he wore
[55:11] come back and fell on the church the
[55:13] Holy Ghost the robe now we read it we
[55:16] read a scripture in Revelations that
[55:18] said that that and to her was granted
[55:21] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[55:23] clean and white for the fine linen is
[55:25] the righteousness of saints you know our
[55:28] righteousness is but filthy rags but is
[55:32] through him and the resurrection right
[55:34] the resurrection of what the the flesh
[55:36] has tried to the the the the curse of
[55:39] the serpent has tried to ruin God has
[55:41] resurrected that within us through the
[55:44] faith in him right amen so
[55:48] now so you you can't you can't you
[55:51] Justified he Sanctified and maybe I
[55:54] might contradicted myself but we're
[55:56] going to patch that up right here in
[55:59] order to even be there to be in that
[56:01] ceremony you must have the Rob on so
[56:04] sanctification is not enough you must
[56:06] come and be the right and the only way
[56:08] you can be the proper sacrifice for the
[56:10] ceremony is to be filled with the holy
[56:13] spirit because now you are a righteous
[56:15] you are a clean vessel that God can can
[56:18] can can bring into him you see it's it
[56:20] it's you must go further in with God you
[56:23] you you can't just stop you the Holy
[56:25] Ghost and all of that that's the bottom
[56:27] of the pyramid we've got to step further
[56:30] into Christ so now God has provided an
[56:34] altar right God's chosen place of
[56:36] worship he says there we have it then
[56:39] this is it alone I need to slow
[56:42] down it is for him alone God's chosen
[56:45] place of worship so God God chose to
[56:48] meet man was not in a church not in a
[56:51] denomination not in a Creed but in
[56:53] Christ right right so so Cain you know
[56:56] he had the Altar and he had the
[56:58] sacrifice but he he missed Christ so you
[57:01] say say well it's in the church well
[57:04] that's not good enough God's not in if
[57:07] you will right he's not in a church in a
[57:09] building God is with his people yeah
[57:12] that's right and and and when you know I
[57:16] was telling my wife
[57:18] this the short time that I've been alive
[57:21] I started to learn not to to uh stress
[57:24] too much about people's current position
[57:28] right because I like to say God works in
[57:31] years you know many many examples where
[57:34] God worked in years in the scriptures
[57:36] not days he does do that
[57:38] but the
[57:40] average and you see people and and and
[57:44] it's it's us it's our flesh we get upset
[57:48] because we see the potential that they
[57:49] have and we look at their lives and we
[57:51] say they are
[57:53] ruining the they're ruining
[57:56] it but
[57:59] God you know I I said I was talking to
[58:02] her my wife and I said you know this
[58:03] certain person you maybe they maybe they
[58:05] get together with this guy and uh they
[58:09] start going to a Baptist Church and
[58:11] their lives
[58:13] changed I by God's grace I would
[58:16] encourage that because they're that's
[58:20] the place they're going to
[58:22] start and when more truth is revealed to
[58:26] them they'll step further forward and
[58:29] when more truth is revealed to them
[58:31] they'll step further forward till they
[58:32] step out of that place into God's
[58:36] provided place of
[58:40] worship so
[58:43] truth it's like you know you it's like
[58:46] you leave a little crumb right you I
[58:47] don't know what do you what what are you
[58:49] trying to get to follow you maybe a dog
[58:50] maybe it you know you don't want a bear
[58:53] to follow you but you leave food scraps
[58:55] along the trail you will have a bear
[58:57] following you but God God drops these
[59:00] nuggets of Truth and so what I'm what
[59:03] I'm trying to get across is is there's
[59:05] we it's a journey and and and there's so
[59:08] many different places along that path
[59:11] even for myself even for each of you and
[59:14] and and if and if we're not careful we
[59:16] we we look and you know we've heard our
[59:18] pastor say we're all looking at the same
[59:20] horse and we look and we say well
[59:22] there's no way they're they're way off
[59:25] they they they they've missed it but but
[59:28] they're holding
[59:30] truth they're holding on to truth and
[59:32] there's there's a progression there's a
[59:34] journey to the
[59:36] Altar and and then when you get to the
[59:39] altar I mean there's a lot of married
[59:41] folks in here it is not all cherry
[59:44] blossoms and
[59:46] chocolates when you're married
[59:48] because I'm getting ahead of myself but
[59:51] you submit your will to Christ and he
[59:54] you become married to Christ you submit
[59:55] yourself guess what you have to do every
[59:57] single day submit your will to Christ so
[1:00:00] you you you become in this position of
[1:00:04] where you're a sacrifice
[1:00:06] ready and then and then God takes you
[1:00:10] and he accepts you he accepts your
[1:00:13] sacrifice now there's communion now
[1:00:16] there's dialogue with
[1:00:19] God but then every day what what is
[1:00:21] happening to the bride here on Earth
[1:00:24] right now when you come to church when
[1:00:26] you read your Bible when you listen to
[1:00:27] the sermons you are being judged by the
[1:00:30] word judgment just like judgment was
[1:00:32] delivered to Cain in a negative fashion
[1:00:35] he missed it you didn't miss it but God
[1:00:37] is judging you every day he say you know
[1:00:39] what you shouldn't have done that you
[1:00:41] should have do this you know to do this
[1:00:43] you need to start doing it the word of
[1:00:46] God is is judging you and it it's this
[1:00:49] it's this relationship that
[1:00:53] that you're married to
[1:00:56] Christ but you don't always act like
[1:01:00] it you know you married to your husband
[1:01:02] but you don't always do what pleases
[1:01:05] him vice versa but
[1:01:09] see because when you have you have this
[1:01:11] battle between evil and righteousness
[1:01:14] because the marriage is consummated
[1:01:16] you're part of Christ and and and and um
[1:01:20] but the flesh still Wars against that
[1:01:23] Union
[1:01:25] the the the the evil of the flesh the
[1:01:27] Fallen nature of man Wars against the
[1:01:30] righteousness it's it's Cain attacking
[1:01:35] Abel but through Christ through the very
[1:01:39] relationship that the evil is fighting
[1:01:41] against this this twin this battle of
[1:01:44] the
[1:01:45] twins right there as you lay the flesh
[1:01:47] down by surrendering to your
[1:01:50] husband your relationship with him Str
[1:01:55] strengthens you get stronger and
[1:02:01] stronger sorry I I dreamed this years
[1:02:04] ago just hit me you you you have this
[1:02:07] relationship with God and and and and I
[1:02:11] just feel like I can't get it out every
[1:02:13] time I preach on this it you you you
[1:02:17] married to God you have a relationship
[1:02:19] and it's the thing that fights that
[1:02:21] relationship that strengthens that
[1:02:23] relationship
[1:02:24] when you overcome it and how do you
[1:02:27] overcome it by getting strength from him
[1:02:30] so the very thing that's it's like you
[1:02:32] know I was talking to my wife about a
[1:02:34] situation and I thought I said you know
[1:02:36] what as an example a very dark example
[1:02:39] if someone's hooked on drugs what's the
[1:02:41] one thing they're going to fight the
[1:02:42] hardest for the drugs but it's the
[1:02:45] number one thing that's ruining their
[1:02:47] life so if you take the drugs you don't
[1:02:49] like them you don't love them you hate
[1:02:52] them so many times God is trying to take
[1:02:54] the thing and we're grabbing on to it
[1:02:57] and we're saying no don't take this from
[1:02:58] me I have to have this and it's that war
[1:03:01] and then we give it up finally by God's
[1:03:04] grace we give it up and by by giving
[1:03:07] that up and surrendering that all of a
[1:03:09] sudden again we look to Christ and we
[1:03:12] say wow you always know what's best for
[1:03:15] me wow you were right and every time
[1:03:19] maybe I say this a bit tongue and cheek
[1:03:21] every time husband is right the wife has
[1:03:23] a new look of respect on her face this
[1:03:26] man really knows what he's talking about
[1:03:28] the husband says yes and as soon as he
[1:03:31] says yes he steps in a a
[1:03:35] mess but you see but God doesn't step in
[1:03:39] the mess because he's perfect so we look
[1:03:41] to him and we say wow now the next time
[1:03:44] we face that again we are stronger in
[1:03:48] that position and the only reason we're
[1:03:51] stronger is because there is an
[1:03:55] opposition not to respe last time
[1:03:59] but in God's that's why God's provided
[1:04:02] place of worship is in Christ you see
[1:04:06] that's the only place that God will meet
[1:04:07] a man he can worship God is in Christ
[1:04:10] that's the only place no matter if
[1:04:12] you're Methodist Baptist Catholic Pro
[1:04:14] Protestant whatever you might be there's
[1:04:16] only one place that you can correctly
[1:04:18] worship God that's in Christ Romans 8:1
[1:04:21] said there is there therefore now no
[1:04:23] cond Nation to them that are in Christ
[1:04:26] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:04:28] after the spirit he says that's the
[1:04:30] gospel amen that's the gospel you see it
[1:04:34] it's praise the
[1:04:37] Lord so righteousness
[1:04:41] resurrected you know before I go into
[1:04:44] this we there was the example of of of
[1:04:47] Cain right judgment delivered and and I
[1:04:49] said God judges Us by his word every
[1:04:52] single day well well there was another
[1:04:55] step in there and that was the mark
[1:04:56] given to Cain but we also received the
[1:05:01] mark it may seem a little bit weird to
[1:05:04] take such a dark example and Shine the
[1:05:06] Light of the positive but you see it's
[1:05:07] this twin it's this battle between evil
[1:05:10] and righteousness these twins where as
[1:05:12] long as you step into Christ it looks
[1:05:15] similar but it's hits the mark perfectly
[1:05:18] because it's what God wants because the
[1:05:20] devil cannot create he can only pervert
[1:05:24] so you are marked I'm
[1:05:27] marked we're marked by the ring the
[1:05:31] promise of holy wedlock with Christ
[1:05:33] we're marked there's a difference about
[1:05:35] you people notice that difference
[1:05:37] because the spiritual realm is a lot
[1:05:38] more real than people give credit to so
[1:05:41] people know you're marked by what
[1:05:43] because you've been with God you've been
[1:05:46] with Christ you are married to him and
[1:05:48] you're
[1:05:51] marked and through this Union
[1:05:54] there is a right the righteousness
[1:05:56] through this Union with Christ
[1:05:58] righteousness is resurrected just how
[1:06:00] Seth was the righteousness resurrected
[1:06:02] there's a righteousness resurrected in
[1:06:05] each one of
[1:06:08] us Isaiah
[1:06:10] 64:6 but we are all as an unclean thing
[1:06:13] and all our righteousness are as filthy
[1:06:20] rags we all do Fade as a leaf and our
[1:06:23] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[1:06:26] away out of
[1:06:28] control
[1:06:31] chaos
[1:06:33] drifting
[1:06:38] but you
[1:06:40] know there's only two masters God or
[1:06:44] evil or righteousness so you're not
[1:06:46] actually just drifting you're being
[1:06:49] pulled you're being
[1:06:53] influenced and all that that brings is
[1:06:55] the end of that is is death right
[1:06:57] separation from from Christ forever hell
[1:07:01] is not Eternal but you're eternally
[1:07:02] separated from
[1:07:04] Christ and our righteousness you know we
[1:07:06] we have
[1:07:08] nothing we we we we must you know we we
[1:07:12] we must put on the robe that he has
[1:07:14] given to us if we would just stop trying
[1:07:17] to fix ourselves right and just start
[1:07:20] putting the word on what a difference
[1:07:23] that would
[1:07:26] make you know I I we talked some time
[1:07:29] ago about about Sin and how how uh sin
[1:07:33] is I can't remember exactly how it was
[1:07:35] put but basically to fight against sin
[1:07:37] is is is to fight a losing
[1:07:40] battle did you know that to fight
[1:07:44] against the Devil is a losing
[1:07:46] battle if you look at it that way where
[1:07:48] you're going to go and you're going to
[1:07:50] fight the devil right how do you fight
[1:07:52] the devil you turned to
[1:07:57] Christ you see I've been there saints of
[1:07:59] God I've been there we we we are there
[1:08:02] constantly right we say well I'm going
[1:08:04] to defeat this problem when all we need
[1:08:06] to do is go to Christ go to prayer
[1:08:11] commit it to his hands and then spend
[1:08:14] more time with him you don't even have
[1:08:17] to be thinking about your problem you
[1:08:19] don't even have to be reading about your
[1:08:21] problem but as you go to him as you
[1:08:25] spend time with him as you have
[1:08:26] communion with him because he is your
[1:08:29] husband he should be the center of your
[1:08:32] life all of a sudden it becomes easier
[1:08:35] to say no it becomes easier to turn from
[1:08:39] your habits the things that are are are
[1:08:42] coming against you because as the as the
[1:08:44] Life of Christ is is is how does how do
[1:08:48] you how do we say this a as you see more
[1:08:50] of the word you realize oh I don't need
[1:08:52] to hold on to this anymore anymore this
[1:08:54] is a lot better it can only hold one at
[1:08:57] a time he can only hold one at a time
[1:08:59] you know it's like the monkey reaches
[1:09:01] into the the Trap and he and he grabs a
[1:09:04] hold of the treat and he can't get his
[1:09:07] hand out unless he lets go of it so the
[1:09:10] very thing we we are trapping ourselves
[1:09:12] because we're refusing to let refusing
[1:09:14] to let go of something say say wellow
[1:09:16] you know this person or this problem no
[1:09:19] you need to just let go of that
[1:09:21] problem you know that the day and age we
[1:09:23] live in everybody's complaining about
[1:09:25] their parents and what their parents did
[1:09:26] to them and how they abused them and and
[1:09:28] and all of this stuff and there is valid
[1:09:30] cases of abuse I'm not discrediting that
[1:09:33] but most of this stuff you hear it's
[1:09:34] like no your parents need to just whoop
[1:09:36] you more or or or make you listen to the
[1:09:38] rules or make you do the dishes that's
[1:09:40] your problem but it's you know brother
[1:09:43] brother Ben mcaffrey he's the one who
[1:09:45] told me this and kind of Set Me Free a
[1:09:47] little bit he said he said no matter how
[1:09:48] well you do Chris your kids are going to
[1:09:50] need counseling because of you when they
[1:09:52] get older it's just a fact of
[1:09:56] life okay that makes you feel a little
[1:09:59] better
[1:10:02] but
[1:10:06] so people are complaining about that
[1:10:09] it's and you know maybe there's some
[1:10:10] there are some valid situations where
[1:10:13] things didn't go super great we've all
[1:10:16] been there but for me for each one of us
[1:10:21] if there is problems it it with your
[1:10:23] parents
[1:10:24] this is very specific we're going to
[1:10:26] we're going to ride the wave as brother
[1:10:27] Ron Peterson said but he said Chris ride
[1:10:29] the
[1:10:31] wave it is you are no you are not
[1:10:34] responsible for what they're doing now
[1:10:38] right but you are responsible if you
[1:10:42] refuse to let
[1:10:44] go you have to forgive them I mean they
[1:10:48] can still be a mess I know of situations
[1:10:51] where the this the the child you know by
[1:10:54] God's grace has let go has just love
[1:10:57] overflowing but his parent is is still a
[1:11:03] mess but that you can't be responsible
[1:11:06] for that and if you hold on to that you
[1:11:10] you are just as
[1:11:12] bad and that's where the rubber meets
[1:11:14] the road and it gets hot where the
[1:11:17] rubber meets the road it burns a little
[1:11:22] bit and if we can just let go we we by
[1:11:26] letting go you will not change them by
[1:11:29] letting go you will not spark an apology
[1:11:31] from them by letting go you will allow
[1:11:34] God to then begin to use you you will
[1:11:37] find yourself in a new position in
[1:11:39] Christ you will find yourself with
[1:11:41] freedom you know this is this is
[1:11:44] actually science if there's a offense in
[1:11:46] someone's life say they're four years
[1:11:47] old and now they're a grown man and they
[1:11:50] have issues this is science if they can
[1:11:53] go back and visit that moment in their
[1:11:56] life and make restitutions with
[1:11:59] themselves with God
[1:12:02] preferably that will be buried and they
[1:12:05] will begin to change now I believe that
[1:12:07] it's God always pychology whatever
[1:12:10] science whatever it's God always so you
[1:12:13] go you go back to that offense whatever
[1:12:15] it is and you say God I'm putting this
[1:12:17] into your hands because it's it's
[1:12:20] inhibiting me from being the father from
[1:12:23] being the mother from being for being
[1:12:25] the daughter from being the son that I
[1:12:27] could be because I won't let go and so
[1:12:30] I'm trapped and bitterness will drive
[1:12:33] the Holy Spirit right out of your
[1:12:39] life but you know what whenever you see
[1:12:41] something prevalent in the world popular
[1:12:44] in the secular
[1:12:51] world there's a there's there's a
[1:12:54] there's a type in the in the
[1:12:57] spiritually spiritually with the with
[1:13:00] the bride of Christ as a whole with
[1:13:02] individuals as a
[1:13:03] whole and the answer that they have is
[1:13:06] not necessarily the right answer and
[1:13:09] many times I think that's where people
[1:13:10] fall into the Trap you know we've talked
[1:13:12] about social media before and we can
[1:13:14] talk about pornography and all that kind
[1:13:16] of stuff but I believe a greater trap is
[1:13:18] when when when parents are feeding on
[1:13:21] social media and the idea
[1:13:24] of child raising that come from the
[1:13:26] world come from the descendants of
[1:13:29] hippies who haven't been saved by
[1:13:31] God right my aunt is and Jerry sits here
[1:13:36] descendant of hippies but by the grace
[1:13:38] of
[1:13:40] God
[1:13:43] so that's where I think people fall into
[1:13:45] a trap as they read in there's a cute
[1:13:47] little picture of a little boy with PB&J
[1:13:49] all over his face and and the caption is
[1:13:51] let him be free and live life to the the
[1:13:53] fullest no get a napkin and wipe their
[1:13:55] face off that's not how adults run
[1:13:58] around so don't let your kid run around
[1:14:00] like that we're training kids to be good
[1:14:05] adults so if you won't allow yourself to
[1:14:08] do it or your spouse to do it right okay
[1:14:10] there's age appropriate things but I
[1:14:13] think we fall into the Trap of consuming
[1:14:15] too much of the world right so then now
[1:14:17] we can take that example from there and
[1:14:19] bring that back into where we are
[1:14:21] talking about tonight where if we spend
[1:14:22] to much time not with our lover with our
[1:14:26] husband you know if the husband and wife
[1:14:28] get really busy and they drift apart and
[1:14:31] they pass like two ships in the night
[1:14:33] the devil begins to
[1:14:35] work little things come up but then
[1:14:38] there's no communion so those little
[1:14:40] things turn into big things and suddenly
[1:14:44] divorce is the only
[1:14:46] answer no no no no it started all the
[1:14:51] way back there
[1:14:54] when you decided to stop talking to each
[1:14:56] other give or take by circumstance see
[1:15:00] the devil isn't the devil isn't ready
[1:15:02] hiding behind the corner to jump out and
[1:15:03] say Boo
[1:15:05] gotcha no he shows up and he slips a no
[1:15:08] under your
[1:15:09] door or he or he he or he you know drops
[1:15:13] a a bag of goodies on the porch That's
[1:15:17] How The Devil Works he's sneaky he he he
[1:15:20] put a little bit of crumb there and
[1:15:21] he'll take the crumb and he'll drop
[1:15:22] another little crumb there and you'll
[1:15:24] take that crumb and next thing you know
[1:15:26] you're you know step into my parlor said
[1:15:29] the spider to the fly right next thing
[1:15:31] you know you're all tangled up in the
[1:15:35] web the web of
[1:15:38] Temptation second Corinthians 5:21 for
[1:15:41] he hath made him to be sin for us who
[1:15:44] knew no sin that we might be made the
[1:15:46] righteousness of God in
[1:15:49] him Abel was killed which was a type of
[1:15:52] death burial and resurrection of Christ
[1:15:55] Seth took his place so
[1:15:58] righteousness
[1:16:02] resurrected in this quote here marriage
[1:16:04] of the land and I'm winding down I know
[1:16:06] it hasn't been long but but you see
[1:16:09] first decision decisions made next
[1:16:12] engagement then promise and then the
[1:16:14] ceremony interesting about this quote I
[1:16:17] I uh the search engine I was using I
[1:16:21] would search different things and no
[1:16:22] matter what search this quote would pop
[1:16:25] up so it wasn't until before service I
[1:16:28] was like oh I need this quote so the
[1:16:30] Lord was like hint hint hint so that's
[1:16:34] what so pay
[1:16:35] attention and that's when the bride
[1:16:37] takes the bridegroom's name she is no
[1:16:39] more than of her own name she takes the
[1:16:41] bridegroom's name you see how important
[1:16:43] it is you take the H the name of your
[1:16:45] husband and the the reason the world
[1:16:47] says no I'll keep my name it's in direct
[1:16:50] opposition of the will of God she is is
[1:16:53] no more than of her own name she takes
[1:16:55] the bridegroom's name and then when the
[1:16:57] church has the ceremony you know you you
[1:16:59] can you can not have anything in the
[1:17:01] world but no matter what the world takes
[1:17:03] from you you always have your
[1:17:05] name yeah you can lose your face you can
[1:17:08] lose your arms your legs but you always
[1:17:10] have your
[1:17:12] name that's the one thing God asks for
[1:17:16] he says give me your
[1:17:17] name he asks you for the one thing that
[1:17:20] that no one has to surrender it can
[1:17:22] never be taken from you and he asks you
[1:17:24] will you give it to me right that's good
[1:17:27] you're sacrificing your name and you
[1:17:30] know what your name is it is your
[1:17:32] identity that's why it's so important
[1:17:34] what you name your children but it's
[1:17:35] your identity your name is your identity
[1:17:38] so you you have this name and you come
[1:17:40] to the altar you come to the Altar and
[1:17:43] and and you and there's Christ and
[1:17:46] there's the marriage
[1:17:48] certificate and he says look you've done
[1:17:51] everything you you sacrificed to be here
[1:17:53] you you you've cleaned yourself up you
[1:17:55] you followed my word now I'm going to
[1:17:57] ask for the
[1:18:00] ultimate will you surrender the very
[1:18:03] last thing you have a hold of and take
[1:18:07] my name instead that's good and it's
[1:18:11] that's the hardest part and I really
[1:18:14] believe this saints of God I really
[1:18:15] believe this whichever Church wherever
[1:18:17] you go wherever Church you go to there
[1:18:19] are people who are standing right there
[1:18:22] they got the robe on they're standing
[1:18:23] right there and God's saying just give
[1:18:25] me your name and they just can't bring
[1:18:28] themselves to do it
[1:18:29] yet so they do things that just don't
[1:18:32] make sense and we want to just cast them
[1:18:34] off into the outer Darkness but they're
[1:18:36] standing there all Jesus is Christ is
[1:18:38] saying is just hand me your name he will
[1:18:41] not take it you must pass it you must
[1:18:47] give it up and that's where I think
[1:18:49] because PE SS of God we have you got to
[1:18:52] give up every last bit I've seen
[1:18:54] individuals who have come and done so
[1:18:56] much to be at that point and then they
[1:18:58] say it just won't work and I say this
[1:19:01] because I struggled with that for years
[1:19:03] because I saw the effort they put in I
[1:19:06] saw the dedication they put in and then
[1:19:09] they turned away and now they're worse
[1:19:12] off than they ever were they say it just
[1:19:15] wouldn't work it's because they wouldn't
[1:19:16] I'm not saying they had the Holy Spirit
[1:19:18] but they wouldn't surrender that last
[1:19:22] thing and guess what I don't know what
[1:19:23] that last thing is each one of us we
[1:19:26] don't know what that last thing is
[1:19:27] because it's that deep dark thing inside
[1:19:30] of us nobody knows about and God's
[1:19:33] saying please just give it up just let
[1:19:38] go of that one last little thing because
[1:19:42] it has to be what does brother B say
[1:19:44] constantly all the
[1:19:47] word all the word but by God's grace he
[1:19:50] gives us the strength to do so
[1:19:53] she is no more than of her own name she
[1:19:55] takes the bridegroom's name and then
[1:19:57] when the church has the ceremony makes
[1:19:58] their promises then she takes the
[1:20:00] bridegroom's name then she's no longer a
[1:20:03] church of the world she's the Church of
[1:20:05] the Lord Jesus Christ amen I don't mean
[1:20:09] that by name I mean that by birth by
[1:20:12] Nature by the power of God you see to
[1:20:15] receive his name is the completion of
[1:20:19] the New
[1:20:20] Birth by the power of God by the
[1:20:23] revealed truth of God in the heart she
[1:20:25] becomes a Christian Church the great
[1:20:27] Universal Apostolic Christian Church she
[1:20:30] becomes a part of Christ when she does
[1:20:33] that Christ injects into her his own
[1:20:35] Spirit his own life and the Bible said
[1:20:38] to Adam and Eve there you're no longer
[1:20:40] Twain but one do you see why a person in
[1:20:44] this position cannot be
[1:20:47] shaken they no longer have an identity
[1:20:49] to go back to SS of God I no longer have
[1:20:53] an identity to go back to that name
[1:20:56] doesn't
[1:20:57] exist if you want to go back to your own
[1:21:00] old name you got to go get an right it
[1:21:02] doesn't even exist it's
[1:21:05] gone there's nothing to go that's why oh
[1:21:09] God help me that's why it's so hard
[1:21:13] because you're burning the last Bridge
[1:21:15] there is no turning back there's always
[1:21:18] a way out girlfriend boyfriend there's
[1:21:21] always a way out
[1:21:23] until you take his name then that's
[1:21:27] it there's no way
[1:21:29] out they are one Christ and when the
[1:21:33] woman Church okay they are no longer two
[1:21:35] they are one Christ in you amen that's
[1:21:37] it his life has been brought into you
[1:21:40] then you become the
[1:21:43] bride or Mrs Jesus
[1:21:47] Christ you
[1:21:51] see
[1:21:54] I was praying as I was studying this
[1:21:56] because I feel too often I think it's
[1:21:59] just a I think it's just the the lot of
[1:22:03] a
[1:22:04] preacher that I don't bring it out good
[1:22:09] enough God has invited you to something
[1:22:13] we can't even put into
[1:22:15] words God has extended to us an
[1:22:18] invitation God has allowed us maybe
[1:22:20] maybe we already done it we've already
[1:22:22] signed away the
[1:22:23] name the position we hold as his
[1:22:28] wife what an
[1:22:32] honor what a
[1:22:35] privilege and we let life trickle in and
[1:22:37] we become
[1:22:39] apathetic God is God Is Standing There
[1:22:41] the creator of the heavens and the Earth
[1:22:44] and breathe Stars forgive me for getting
[1:22:47] poetic but and he's standing there and
[1:22:50] he's your one and only
[1:22:53] only we just had Valentine's Day right
[1:22:56] empty promises from people who can't
[1:22:58] keep it because they don't have God in
[1:22:59] their life but God's Eternal promises
[1:23:01] never fade away and when he says will
[1:23:03] you be mine I'll be yours that is for
[1:23:08] eternity and he's standing there and and
[1:23:11] every day we have the opportunity to to
[1:23:13] lean ourselves into his bosom as he
[1:23:15] wraps his arms around us and he reminds
[1:23:19] us this is what it's all about
[1:23:23] Lord help us to take it a little bit
[1:23:25] more serious help us to not to become
[1:23:30] legalistic but just come to a place
[1:23:31] where we realize we realize what who we
[1:23:35] are we are Mrs Jesus Christ say it in
[1:23:39] your head say it to yourself quietly I
[1:23:41] am Mr Jesus Christ whether you are there
[1:23:44] now or you have the potential to be
[1:23:46] there you have the
[1:23:48] choice all you have to do is give it up
[1:23:51] the last
[1:23:53] and that fight to the very end doesn't
[1:23:56] go
[1:23:58] away you will
[1:24:00] fight after the ceremony after the
[1:24:03] wedding and the guests have gone home
[1:24:05] and you go back to work
[1:24:09] and you're still married but now the
[1:24:12] devil begins to attack even harder
[1:24:15] because he says ha I'll break this Union
[1:24:18] but there's something special about
[1:24:19] being married to Christ yeah
[1:24:23] I don't even have to say it let's bow
[1:24:25] our heads Heavenly Father Lord
[1:24:30] Jesus I Feel It In My Heart Lord I feel
[1:24:34] it deep in my being Lord Jesus this idea
[1:24:39] this this this relationship and and the
[1:24:43] Perfection the Perfection of this
[1:24:47] position is made more perfect by the
[1:24:53] opposition by the battle between our
[1:24:57] flesh and the righteousness of
[1:25:01] Christ and as we as we surrender to
[1:25:05] you we just fall more in love with you a
[1:25:08] as we as we give up more of our pride
[1:25:13] and our indifferences and and our
[1:25:16] attitudes and our own desires and we
[1:25:19] surrender them to you no matter how hard
[1:25:21] they be we we surrender them to you and
[1:25:24] and we look and we see oh wow God you
[1:25:28] had such a much better plan than I could
[1:25:32] have ever
[1:25:36] imagined father it brings me right back
[1:25:38] in my mind to that moment in the Garden
[1:25:40] of Gethsemane when you said
[1:25:42] but not my will but thy will be done why
[1:25:47] because you
[1:25:49] saw the joy that was set before you you
[1:25:52] you saw what would happen you would be
[1:25:55] able to stand at the altar and
[1:25:58] receive
[1:26:01] us so that you took the
[1:26:04] pain and that is the Crux of our
[1:26:08] relationship with you if we can just
[1:26:11] surrender what we think is so important
[1:26:13] to hold on to God if we can just let
[1:26:16] that
[1:26:17] go you have an abundance waiting for us
