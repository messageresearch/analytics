[37:30] Holy [music] Spirit,
[37:33] fill our hearts and have your way.
[37:42] As we [music] wait,
[37:45] we wait on you. And [music] as we pray,
[37:54] speak [music] your word into [singing]
[37:58] our hearts and have your way.
[38:05] [music]
[38:07] Have your way.
[38:13] Have your way.
[38:19] Holy [music] Spirit,
[38:23] fill our hearts and have your way.
[38:31] And as we wait
[38:37] and as [music] we pray,
[38:44] speak [music] your word into [singing]
[38:48] our hearts and have your way.
[38:56] Have your way.
[39:02] Have [singing]
[39:03] your way.
[39:09] Holy [music] Spirit, [singing]
[39:11] fill our hearts and have your way. One
[39:17] more time.
[39:21] Have your way. [music]
[39:27] Have your way.
[39:33] Holy [singing]
[39:34] Spirit,
[39:36] fill our hearts and have your way.
[39:43] God bless you, Isaac. God bless you.
[39:47] Let's sing [music] that again. How many
[39:48] want the Lord to have his way? That's
[39:51] what we've come here for, isn't it?
[39:54] That's what we desire is the Lord to
[39:55] have his way. Amen.
[39:59] If he doesn't have his way, your way
[40:01] won't [music]
[40:02] get you anywhere.
[40:04] So, let's lay down our way and take his
[40:06] way. Amen. Let's [music] have his way.
[40:09] Amen. Oh, have your way. [music]
[40:15] Amen.
[40:18] Have your way.
[40:25] Holy
[40:26] Spirit,
[40:28] fill our heart and have your [singing]
[40:33] way.
[40:36] Amen. Amen. If you'll stand [music] with
[40:38] me this morning. It's good to be in the
[40:41] house of the Lord.
[40:43] I was glad when they said unto me, "Let
[40:46] us go into the house of the Lord."
[40:49] Because we know that there's only one
[40:51] provided place to meet the Lord. And
[40:54] that's not in grace tabernacle. That's
[40:56] in the house of the Lord. And the house
[40:58] of the Lord is present. The house of the
[41:01] Lord. He dwells in his body, his bride.
[41:04] In his the house of the Lord is the Lord
[41:07] Jesus. Amen. And so we've come to
[41:10] worship him in his house.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; And so we we're expecting when we come
[41:15] into his house, we expect to meet him.
[41:18] and we believe he's present with us.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; And so, God bless you this morning. God
[41:22] bless those online, those that are not
[41:25] assembled with us. I know I know brother
[41:28] Trevor called something come up. And so,
[41:30] as we pray, let's just remember him in
[41:32] prayer also. And that whatever it is
[41:35] that God would would have his way with
[41:38] all of us. That's our desire. That's
[41:40] what we want. We certainly don't want
[41:43] our own way. As I said, we want God's
[41:45] way.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And let's bow our heads.
[41:48] Father, we thank you that we can call
[41:51] you our Father. Our Father, who art in
[41:55] heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[41:58] Lord, thy kingdom come, thy will be
[42:00] done. May thy name be glorified here in
[42:03] the hearts of your children, in the
[42:06] hearts of your elect seed. May they have
[42:08] ears to hear and realize, Lord, that
[42:11] it's not what they do, but it's what
[42:13] you've already given to them. Help them
[42:16] to receive it. Help them to hear it.
[42:18] Lord, I pray that you would give
[42:20] revelation upon your word and by your
[42:22] word. For you said faith cometh by
[42:24] hearing the word. And so that's our
[42:28] desire. That's our prayer is that you
[42:31] would fill us and for we with your
[42:33] faith. For we know the believer is the
[42:35] faith of God, the revelation of the word
[42:39] in us. So we give you praise now. Bless
[42:42] your word, we pray, and have your way.
[42:45] That's what we've sang. That's what we'd
[42:47] want. That's what we desire. As we yield
[42:49] ourselves now to your word, to your
[42:52] presence. In Jesus Christ's name, I
[42:55] pray. Amen. Amen. Turn with me to St.
[42:59] John 3.
[43:01] Amen. There's some missing. And I know
[43:04] that uh we wish everybody could be here,
[43:07] but the Lord knows all things. And so,
[43:10] we just pray God's blessing on those
[43:12] that can't be and those that want to be
[43:14] and can't be. Amen. And you know, it's
[43:18] always what we desire, what's in our
[43:20] hearts, what God sees. And so, we can't
[43:24] hide that from him because his he the
[43:26] word is present and he the word discerns
[43:29] the hearts and thoughts and the minds of
[43:31] the people. So, we can hide nothing from
[43:33] him. We've come into his presence and
[43:35] the presence of light is here. So, in
[43:38] St. John 3 verse three, Jesus speaking
[43:42] to Nicodemus.
[43:44] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[43:46] "Verily, verily I say unto thee, except
[43:50] a man be born again, he cannot see," and
[43:53] that word see is understand or visualize
[43:57] or or perceive the kingdom of God. And
[44:01] then in verse 16,
[44:04] we'll take verse 15 first. That
[44:07] whosoever believeth in him
[44:10] should not perish
[44:13] but have everlasting life.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world.
[44:19] Now that world there is mankind. Now
[44:22] that's not the cosmos because God didn't
[44:24] love the cosmos. The cosmos in itself is
[44:28] not of God. It's of the enemy. But the
[44:32] mankind, his creation
[44:36] &gt;&gt; is brought here and God has provided a
[44:39] way out. But it depends whether you want
[44:41] to accept that or not.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not what we try to do to
[44:46] please God. It's what he's already done
[44:48] that we receive.
[44:50] And so we know that by this verse here
[44:53] that whosoever believeth in him didn't
[44:56] say believe on him. It said believe in
[44:58] him. And we know that the only way you
[45:00] could really be a believer in him is
[45:03] that you were in him to begin with
[45:06] &gt;&gt; because God's got children. He's
[45:08] speaking to those seed, his children.
[45:11] And so he said, "Whosoever believeth in
[45:13] him should not perish but have eternal
[45:16] life. And there's only one form of
[45:18] eternal life, and that's God himself."
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And so for God that eternal life so
[45:24] loved the world that he gave, what did
[45:26] he give? He gave himself. He gave his
[45:29] only begotten son. And when the son when
[45:32] the word became flesh, that was the
[45:33] divine spoken word creation of God. And
[45:36] it and it formed itself in the womb of a
[45:40] predestinated seed. Now, I want you not
[45:43] to pass that by right that statement. It
[45:46] formed itself in that in that womb of
[45:48] that predestinated seed. And she brought
[45:51] forth not of herself, not of Joseph, but
[45:54] a predestinated word that God himself
[45:58] brought himself, created himself, and
[46:00] God became son among us, unveiled
[46:04] himself as the word made flesh. And he's
[46:07] still the same today.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Not the same stature, but the same word
[46:12] made flesh. And so, for God so loved the
[46:16] world that and his love projected, what
[46:19] did he do? He gave his only begotten son
[46:22] &gt;&gt; that whosoever believeth in him now
[46:24] that's speaking to you is speaking to me
[46:28] that whosoever believeth in him should
[46:31] not perish but have
[46:35] eternal life or everlasting life.
[46:38] For God sent his son not into the world
[46:40] to condemn the world.
[46:43] God sent not his son, excuse me, into
[46:45] the world to condemn the world, but that
[46:46] the world through him, and he's here
[46:49] today. And that's our commission that
[46:51] the world through him, his body,
[46:54] &gt;&gt; life proceeding from the body.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that whosoever believeth in
[47:01] him
[47:03] should be saved. He that believeth on
[47:05] him is not condemned. That condemned is
[47:07] judged. For he took our judgment at
[47:10] Calvary. He took all our judgment. So he
[47:14] that believeth on him is not condemned.
[47:16] But he that believeth not is condemned
[47:18] already because he hath not believed in
[47:21] the name. That name is not an I was.
[47:24] That name is I am
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ who believeth on his
[47:29] believe in his name of the only begotten
[47:32] son of God.
[47:33] And this is condemnation or judgment
[47:36] that light has come into the world and
[47:37] men love darkness rather than light
[47:40] because the light exposed their deeds.
[47:43] In other words, the Bible said because
[47:44] their deeds were evil. For everyone that
[47:47] doeth evil hateth the light, neither
[47:48] cometh to the light that his deeds
[47:51] should be reproved or corrected.
[47:55] But he that doeth truth, notice, doeth
[47:58] truth, cometh to the light, that his
[48:00] deeds may be manifest, that they are
[48:02] wrought or brought about or brought
[48:05] forth from God. Amen. I'd like you to go
[48:08] with me now to St. John 5,
[48:12] just a few another page or two over. St.
[48:15] John 5 and verse 24.
[48:20] Verily, verily or surely, surely, I say
[48:23] unto you, he that heareth my word. Now,
[48:27] that's that there's a difference in
[48:29] hearing here and hearing from your
[48:32] heart.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is speaking about hearing it
[48:35] from the heart.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; First, it has to come through here, but
[48:38] then it depends on what's in the heart,
[48:41] whether it's received or not. And so,
[48:43] that's the true hearing is able to
[48:45] receive. And so verily I say unto you,
[48:48] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[48:50] him that sent me hath past tense. That
[48:53] word hath is past tense. Hath
[48:57] everlasting life. And shall not come
[49:00] into condemnation. Here it is again,
[49:02] judgment. But is passed from death. That
[49:05] word death there is an eternal
[49:07] separation. Has passed from death unto
[49:11] life.
[49:13] And then I want you to go with me to
[49:15] First Peter. And I'll let you be seated
[49:17] here. 1 Peter
[49:23] chapter 1 verse 23.
[49:28] Being born again.
[49:31] Verse 23. 1 Peter 1:23. Being born
[49:34] again. And that's spiritual birth.
[49:37] That's not a born again in the physical.
[49:39] That's a spiritual birth that happens in
[49:42] the soul.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Because before you were ever spirit or
[49:46] became a man flesh, you were soul.
[49:50] Amen. So being born again, not of
[49:54] corruptible seed, but of incorruptible
[49:56] by the word of God, which liveth and
[49:59] abideth forever. How? By the word of
[50:01] God. You may be seated.
[50:04] Amen.
[50:07] You see there there's something
[50:09] happened. We weren't we weren't meant to
[50:12] come this way because life was there but
[50:15] they were given a command of the word
[50:16] which they did not keep and by that
[50:19] brought death to the human race. Every
[50:21] ambulance, every dead child, everything
[50:23] that happened was because of one person
[50:26] disbelieving the word.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just one little sentence of the
[50:30] word. So see God's word is perfect. You
[50:32] can't add to that. You can't take from
[50:34] it. It's perfect.
[50:36] And so, and so we see here then death
[50:39] entered the human race. You weren't
[50:40] meant to come this way, but you came
[50:42] anyway. Then God had to provide a way
[50:44] out of that trap. And he did. He gave
[50:47] himself.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; God did.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Because no man was worthy to die for
[50:52] another. Everybody's born of sin through
[50:54] sexual birth. And there's no ability
[50:56] that we have to to pick another up and
[51:00] bring him out of sin. So, it took one
[51:02] that was perfect. It took one that was
[51:04] sinless. So it took a perfect blood. And
[51:07] because it was shown from the beginning,
[51:09] Abel offered a sacrifice that God
[51:11] received and that was shed blood. And so
[51:14] by the shed blood, and God's never
[51:16] changed his mind, God can't change his
[51:18] mind. So through the shedding of blood,
[51:20] a perfect blood, it looses those that
[51:23] were believing in him, that were his
[51:25] seed, his children. And so they they
[51:28] were loosed. And you're loosed this
[51:29] morning if you can receive it by perfect
[51:31] blood.
[51:33] Amen. has loosed us, has set us free.
[51:37] Therefore, there's no condemnation to
[51:39] them that are that walk that there's no
[51:42] condemnation to them that are that that
[51:44] are in Christ who walketh not after the
[51:48] flesh, but after the spirit. Amen. And
[51:51] so, here we are. So, I want to speak on
[51:53] the title and I and I'll just go as far
[51:56] as the Lord will allow me to here this
[51:58] morning. And I may have to pick it up. I
[52:00] don't know. But I just let the Holy
[52:02] Spirit have his way. We said we want we
[52:04] sang. I believe that with all my heart.
[52:06] That song was inspired of God to be sung
[52:09] here this morning. Do we want him to
[52:11] have his way or don't we?
[52:14] &gt;&gt; You're either going to have your way or
[52:16] his way.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Now, we want to be sensitive to the Holy
[52:19] Spirit. We want him to have his way.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; It's too late down the season to have
[52:23] your own way. We might as well, as I
[52:26] spoke on Wednesday, let's let's crucify
[52:28] and deny the idol of ourself.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Let's accept what God has done. Lay down
[52:36] our past. Your past has nothing to do
[52:38] with where you're at right now. You've
[52:41] already done past that past.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; So, quit thinking that you're not able
[52:46] to do or to keep the word of God. That's
[52:49] a lie of the devil. Because if something
[52:51] pulling in you to surrender your life,
[52:54] it shows when there's a deep calling to
[52:55] the deep, there's somehow God has to
[52:57] provide something to satisfy that call
[53:00] or you wouldn't be calling for it.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; If there's a thirst in your heart,
[53:04] there's something you're thirsting for
[53:06] or you wouldn't have a thirst. There's
[53:08] got to be something out there to satisfy
[53:10] that thirst.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; So I ask you this morning, why are you
[53:14] here? Did you come here to be seen? Did
[53:17] you come here as a lodge? Is it just
[53:19] it's something to do or did you come
[53:21] here with a burden and and call in your
[53:24] heart to meet God?
[53:25] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. Amen. Amen. So, so
[53:30] my title is the real gift unveiled.
[53:34] The real gift unveiled. Something
[53:38] someone is going to make it home.
[53:41] There's got to be a bride.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; This message didn't go out for just to
[53:46] be going out. This message went out to
[53:49] take a bride that was elected and that
[53:52] election had nothing to do with you and
[53:54] I. God forneew and by fornowledge could
[53:57] elect
[53:59] &gt;&gt; because he knew what you would do. He
[54:01] knew who you were.
[54:04] Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And by that he could elect a bride
[54:07] because it was his heart purpose. Now I
[54:08] want you to hold that word purpose
[54:10] because we're coming into the scripture
[54:11] here. It was his purpose to have a
[54:14] bride.
[54:16] Can you understand that? That God, an
[54:18] eternal God, the creator of heavens and
[54:19] earth, had a had a part of him, a an
[54:24] attribute that had to be expressed to be
[54:27] a husband,
[54:30] &gt;&gt; to be a son, to be a savior,
[54:33] &gt;&gt; to be a healer, to be a peacegiver, to
[54:36] be a a deliverer, to to and on and on we
[54:40] could go about his attributes.
[54:42] And we think things are all out of
[54:43] cater. Well, why would he allow the
[54:45] devil to come down and deceive Eve?
[54:46] Well, because those attributes had to be
[54:49] expressed, but he couldn't make them
[54:50] fall, but he gave them a choice.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; But God knowing that there would be
[54:56] people sitting right here this morning
[54:59] that by God has been given an ear to
[55:01] hear the word for their season. Just
[55:03] like every season, there's been a word
[55:05] for every season.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll come into that as we go
[55:09] on. But my title is the real gift
[55:11] unveiled. Unveiled means it's been it's
[55:14] opened up. It's revealed.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; And so and my subject is the
[55:20] personalized secret. So there's a secret
[55:24] somebody
[55:26] somewhere individual
[55:29] and it's an individual affair truly
[55:32] &gt;&gt; that has this secret and holding this
[55:34] secrets that's been unveiled. They're
[55:37] different because Jesus too was that
[55:39] seed revealed. Right?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And he was the fullness of the godhead
[55:44] bodily. And because of that, I say, if
[55:47] you are his son or child, where were you
[55:50] when he came to the earth? Where were
[55:53] you when he went to Calvary? Where were
[55:55] you? You were in him.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were in him. You took the
[56:00] judgment of God that you should have
[56:02] received in him.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; He bore it for you and I.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so you see, it's the work. The
[56:10] work is finished.
[56:12] When he said it's finished, healing's
[56:14] finished. Salvation's finished, he now
[56:18] has to go forth and manifest what he's
[56:20] declared is finished. He said, "I'll
[56:22] have a bride. I'll have a wife and she
[56:25] is a part of me and I poured my life out
[56:27] to her that my life would come in her
[56:29] and she would recognize
[56:32] where she stands."
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And that's what the message of this
[56:35] hour. We say message come by because God
[56:38] promised it. That's why the message has
[56:41] come
[56:42] &gt;&gt; because he said that the what's been
[56:44] sealed in the book that God had as a
[56:46] secret in his mind
[56:49] has now been unveiled has now been
[56:51] revealed and someone it didn't go out
[56:53] just to be going out. Someone has the
[56:56] ability of God by grace his grace and
[56:59] through his faith to accept it and
[57:01] believe it and it becomes flesh again in
[57:04] the form of his bride. He does.
[57:08] And so we see it's a personalized
[57:11] secret. Christ in you.
[57:14] Now that scripture we'll we can we can
[57:17] read it. We'll read it I if we have time
[57:19] here this morning. The personalized
[57:21] secret Christ in you. I other words
[57:24] identifying you and him. Christ in you.
[57:27] His word has become personalized which
[57:30] is Christ in you. Identifying you. You
[57:34] know the whole thing today is you got to
[57:35] have identification. You can't even
[57:38] cross the border without identification.
[57:39] You can't get in an airline without
[57:41] identification. You can't do certain
[57:43] certain things uh dealing with banking
[57:45] without identification. Who are you?
[57:47] Where'd you come from? Who are you?
[57:49] What's your name? Well, when the bride
[57:52] realizes where she come from.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; She'll begin to realize who she is.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; And when she re and because of knowing
[58:00] who she is, then she knows where she's
[58:02] going. She knows what's at the end of
[58:04] the road. If this earthly tabernacle be
[58:07] dissolved, we have one waiting. Eternal,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; not natural, but eternal
[58:13] &gt;&gt; in the heavens. We should have entered
[58:15] that to begin with, but we had to bypass
[58:18] that. But it was never taken away. We
[58:20] still have a body waiting for us, a
[58:22] young body.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; We have loved ones that have crossed
[58:26] over, real believers. My mother and
[58:27] father, they're in young bodies. They
[58:29] never will be old again.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; They can't be old again.
[58:34] They've already they've already fought
[58:36] the good fight of faith. They've stood
[58:38] with the word. They've stood on the
[58:39] word. And there they are in eternal
[58:41] bodies that we had a prophet go over and
[58:43] see and come back and told us what that
[58:45] mystery was.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; That would fulfill the scripture.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And you say, "How do you know it's
[58:51] right?" Because none of us been wrong.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; There's never been anything that he saw
[58:56] and would vision and told us about that
[58:57] ever was wrong.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; So, how could be anything be perfect?
[59:00] How could a man be that perfect? It
[59:02] can't be. It's God. using that man and
[59:05] the word coming through a prophet as he
[59:07] said he would do.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; So we have no question of who it is
[59:11] among us.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. It's not taking the
[59:16] man. It's not following. Paul said,
[59:17] "Follow me as I follow Christ." We refer
[59:20] to Paul. We refer to all those men. So
[59:22] we're referring to a word, the word of
[59:24] God that came to a prophet in this day
[59:26] that vindicate God vindicated to be his
[59:29] own word and the interpretation of the
[59:31] word for this day. Then why not follow
[59:33] it? It's vindicated to be God's word.
[59:36] God himself working through a human
[59:38] vessel. God never changed his way. If he
[59:41] worked through man yesterday, he's got
[59:42] to work through men today.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; That's why we have a five-fold ministry.
[59:47] That's why we have apostles, prophets,
[59:48] teachers, pastors, evangelists. It's not
[59:51] them. It's God working through them.
[59:52] That's his channel.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; We're not asking you to receive man nor
[59:56] lift up a man, but lift up the word.
[59:58] It's the word that God comes and brings
[1:00:01] to you.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're talking about the
[1:00:05] real gift unveiled.
[1:00:08] And this this message even this morning
[1:00:10] is for the bride. Now, I don't know
[1:00:12] whose bride and who isn't. I don't need
[1:00:14] to know, but I need to know myself. Am I
[1:00:18] one of them?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Has God brought such an identification
[1:00:23] that you individually can know who you
[1:00:25] are and where you're standing?
[1:00:27] Are you standing on his word? Are you in
[1:00:29] the word? Are you a believer that
[1:00:31] believes the word? Were you a believer
[1:00:33] to begin with?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; If you weren't a believer in Christ and
[1:00:37] his thinking, existing in his thoughts
[1:00:38] as a believer then a part of him, how
[1:00:40] will you be a believer today?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; See, not everybody that says Lord, Lord,
[1:00:47] is going to enter in. But he that doeth
[1:00:50] the will, the will is his word, doeth
[1:00:52] the will of the father. What is the
[1:00:54] will?
[1:00:56] To obey his command. If you love me,
[1:00:59] you'll keep my word. That's what they
[1:01:01] failed in the beginning. They didn't
[1:01:02] keep the word.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; But it's going to come down the end when
[1:01:06] God's going to have a people that will
[1:01:07] believe this word
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; because he's already provided the way
[1:01:10] and put his life and spirit in you that
[1:01:13] you may do and be a doer of that word
[1:01:15] and believe it and can't deny it.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Because that which is in you, Christ
[1:01:20] cannot disbelieve nor deny the word. You
[1:01:23] may have all kinds of feelings out here.
[1:01:25] You may fail out here. But that word
[1:01:27] can't fail.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; And when you pass from death into life,
[1:01:30] you are held completely by that word.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. All right. So, we see
[1:01:40] here. Now, let's go. So, this this
[1:01:42] message morning is for the bride,
[1:01:44] showing her who or what she is. This we
[1:01:47] get through here. If it takes two
[1:01:49] Sundays, it'll take two Sundays, but
[1:01:50] we'll get through it to realize who you
[1:01:53] are and what she is.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And that ought to that ought to bring
[1:01:57] that little bride right up to right up
[1:02:00] to right up to going here. It it will it
[1:02:03] will just absolutely
[1:02:06] excite you, revelate you, and stimulate
[1:02:08] you
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; because this is this is this is where
[1:02:12] our position is. This is how he has
[1:02:15] positionally placed his little bride in
[1:02:18] him before the world began. And now we
[1:02:22] see it being manifest. It's one thing
[1:02:24] that he promised it. We see we see great
[1:02:27] events that made clear by prophecy. Even
[1:02:30] had a prophet preach that message.
[1:02:32] Modern events made clear by prophecy.
[1:02:34] But now it's gone beyond the prophecy to
[1:02:37] seeing the prophecy manifested.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; We're seeing the the events that were
[1:02:42] made clear by prophecy. now seeing the
[1:02:44] prophecy manifested. Brother, sister,
[1:02:46] we're not living back here in 1963 and
[1:02:48] 65. We're 60 62 years down the road
[1:02:52] here. Where are you standing now?
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; This message has been developing and
[1:02:56] growing in the formation of a bride.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why does that have to be? Because
[1:03:05] there has to be a finish to that climax
[1:03:08] of that creation. Adam had a bride. The
[1:03:11] bride was a part of him and come from
[1:03:13] him. And Jesus Christ had a bride that
[1:03:15] went to him with Calvary. His side was
[1:03:17] opened and a bride has come out of him
[1:03:20] to fulfill the scripture to bring it
[1:03:22] back to an Eden again. And this is where
[1:03:24] we're at because we're at the end time
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; and we're about ready to step off into
[1:03:29] Eden. I don't know where that last one
[1:03:31] is. I pray this morning that if there's
[1:03:33] a last one here that hasn't come to that
[1:03:35] realization of their position, may they
[1:03:37] see it. May they rejoice in it. May all
[1:03:40] may that light just come on and that
[1:03:42] mystery that's in you be unveiled. That
[1:03:45] word, that stone of revelation of
[1:03:47] himself become you. And you realize I am
[1:03:51] that living stone.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about first Peter 2, that
[1:03:57] living stone. He said it would be in us
[1:03:59] a living stone.
[1:04:01] Elect, precious.
[1:04:03] Amen. Yeah. That would be a stumbling to
[1:04:06] some people, but they don't realize
[1:04:07] where they're at because they don't
[1:04:08] realize this is the day the Lord has
[1:04:10] made
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; and we'll be glad in it. Rejoice in it.
[1:04:15] So, it ought to rejoice your heart. If
[1:04:17] you're predestinated to see this
[1:04:18] message, I don't say that's not because
[1:04:20] I I'm talking about the message of the
[1:04:21] hour. It will rejoice your soul and you
[1:04:25] won't have any more question because
[1:04:27] you'll see, oh, that's where I'm at.
[1:04:29] That's what I am. That's the
[1:04:31] identification. So, we're talking about
[1:04:33] a real gift.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; There is a real gift. There's all kinds
[1:04:37] of gifts, but there is a real gift.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Unveiled.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're talking about him being
[1:04:46] personalized to you individually.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to turn with me to Ephesians
[1:04:52] chapter 1. Now, I want to while you're
[1:04:55] turning there, I want to take what the
[1:04:57] meaning of personalize means.
[1:05:01] first line being designated or prod or
[1:05:04] or produced to meet someone's individual
[1:05:07] requirements.
[1:05:10] [clears throat] So something that's
[1:05:12] personalized is given to designate or or
[1:05:15] produce to meet and that someone is you
[1:05:18] your need and requirement. Who could
[1:05:21] provide that? We couldn't. We couldn't
[1:05:24] provide it. He provided it. He provides
[1:05:28] our salvation. He does it. It's all his
[1:05:31] achieving.
[1:05:34] He know He knows you're helpless. There
[1:05:35] isn't a man born on earth that's good.
[1:05:37] There is none good. The Bible said there
[1:05:39] is none good. There's none that do good.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Don't look to a man. Don't look to your
[1:05:44] your own self because it's none good
[1:05:47] because you're nothing to begin with.
[1:05:48] You were born into this earth earthly
[1:05:50] defeated
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; and you had to have a savior.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; And so who matters and what matters is
[1:05:57] the word becoming alive in your soul.
[1:05:59] being born again of his spirit, you've
[1:06:01] passed from death unto life. That
[1:06:03] becomes your absolute. The word becomes
[1:06:05] your absolute. And it's not off here
[1:06:07] somewhere in some church or some lodge.
[1:06:09] It's dwelling in you.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. All right. So, so we see
[1:06:17] here Ephesians 1:3 it says, "Blessed be
[1:06:21] the God and father." Who is your God and
[1:06:23] father? Our Lord Jesus Christ. who hath
[1:06:26] blessed us hath already blessed us with
[1:06:30] all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:06:33] places in Christ.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; All right. So according as he hath
[1:06:39] already past tense chosen us. He already
[1:06:43] hath already before the world began
[1:06:45] chose us in himself.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; See you've already done made it.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; You just have to realize it. And the
[1:06:54] reason how you realize it is the word of
[1:06:56] faith is being preached to you and
[1:06:58] that's how you realize it. The word for
[1:07:01] the season. You didn't come in another
[1:07:03] season. You're here today.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; And so in your season now, when you hear
[1:07:08] the word preach, there's got to be
[1:07:10] something inside of your soul that
[1:07:11] either can accept it or it rejects it.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; It's not the man's word. It's not my
[1:07:16] thoughts. It's not even brother
[1:07:18] Brandon's thoughts. It's God's thoughts
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; that he hid in the word here for the
[1:07:23] season being unveiled
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; because there was a secret. There were
[1:07:27] secrets unveiled that could not be
[1:07:29] loosed until this hour by the Revelation
[1:07:32] 10 message of the seventh angel. He had
[1:07:35] he held that it was the sword was in his
[1:07:38] hand to loose or unloose what's been
[1:07:41] sealed up in God's mind and would be
[1:07:44] unveiled to the bride for her to go
[1:07:47] home. Now, there's nobody but nobody
[1:07:50] except you be born again. And the only
[1:07:52] ones that can be truly born again is the
[1:07:55] bride of Christ because the seed is in
[1:07:57] her.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; And so, she's the only one that can be
[1:08:01] born again. And when she and they that
[1:08:04] are born again are holders of this
[1:08:06] secret.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; All right. So we see here then according
[1:08:13] as he had hath chosen us in him before
[1:08:15] when before not when you did good works
[1:08:17] not by your thinking you didn't come
[1:08:19] here you came here didn't know how to
[1:08:22] find him you weren't seeking for him you
[1:08:24] weren't looking for him he comes and
[1:08:25] finds you and he's I trust he's finding
[1:08:28] you this morning he's the one that found
[1:08:30] you never found him you weren't looking
[1:08:32] for him you didn't have the desire to
[1:08:34] look for him but there's inside of you a
[1:08:37] seed planted
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; that's The thing that found you,
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; he found it. He finds you.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he chose you. St. John
[1:08:49] 15:16. He You haven't chosen me, but I
[1:08:52] chose you.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Now, just stop and think about that. He
[1:08:56] chose you.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; He chose you. You don't have to look to
[1:09:03] man and say, "Well, I'm identified this
[1:09:04] way. I wish I could be that way." He
[1:09:06] made you just the way you are to be and
[1:09:08] to manifest him in just the pattern,
[1:09:11] just the way, just the portion he gave
[1:09:13] to you to fill that portion of his body.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; If you're a little cell, you're no
[1:09:19] you're no less than the eye or the ear
[1:09:21] or the mind or the tongue. You're no
[1:09:24] less than the heart that beats. You are
[1:09:26] a part of the body. And without that,
[1:09:28] he's not complete.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so you we go here and see we
[1:09:37] see in verse in verse he chose us before
[1:09:41] the foundation of the world that we
[1:09:43] should be holy and without blame before
[1:09:44] him in love. Who is love? He is love.
[1:09:49] God is love. The eternal is love. God in
[1:09:52] you is eternal. God manifested in you
[1:09:54] showed you were in him in the eternal
[1:09:56] before the world began. And that's how
[1:09:59] you have love because he first loved
[1:10:01] you. you. It's not you producing it.
[1:10:04] He's already said, "I love you." before
[1:10:06] the world began. And therefore, that's
[1:10:08] the only way you could truly love him.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Because God is love. That eternal spirit
[1:10:16] is love.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, so verse five,
[1:10:21] having predestinated us. That word's a
[1:10:23] big word, but it simply means he
[1:10:25] predestined you to be here. Knew you
[1:10:28] would be here. Ordained the word to meet
[1:10:30] you. You didn't you didn't know. Here
[1:10:32] you are just walking along and and all
[1:10:35] of a sudden you meet the word and the
[1:10:36] word does something in your heart just
[1:10:38] because you were that to begin with.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Just like the e little eagle put under a
[1:10:43] chicken when he was hatched because of
[1:10:45] the atmosphere. The egg was hatched but
[1:10:47] he couldn't understand the clucking of
[1:10:48] the of the chicken. I brought this
[1:10:50] Wednesday so I won't dwell on that. But
[1:10:52] why did he not understand the chicken?
[1:10:54] Because he wasn't a chicken.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Why did he understand the eagle that
[1:10:58] came flying over? because he was that to
[1:11:00] begin with.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; You can't make yourself something the
[1:11:04] different than what you are.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; You're that to begin with. You're the
[1:11:08] word to begin with. And God can only
[1:11:11] bring forth of its kind. Whatever seed
[1:11:13] it is that's been planted in the ground
[1:11:15] and the farmers know right well if you
[1:11:17] put that corn seed in the ground, you
[1:11:18] expect to receive corn because it's
[1:11:20] going to bring forth of its kind because
[1:11:23] that's the life in it. Well, if the seed
[1:11:24] of God's in you, what are you going to
[1:11:26] bring forth? You'll bring forth the word
[1:11:28] every time. the word for the season.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Then God's obligated to search for that
[1:11:33] word
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; because he chose you in himself. He
[1:11:38] can't lose you. If he loses you, he
[1:11:41] loses a part of himself and he can't
[1:11:43] lose that part of himself because it's
[1:11:45] eternal.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] Now
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; having predestinated us unto the
[1:11:54] adoption, that word adoption means the
[1:11:56] placing of children. That's what we're
[1:11:59] speaking about. By Jesus Christ to what?
[1:12:02] Himself. Not to a church, not to a
[1:12:04] church entity, not to a group, but to
[1:12:06] himself.
[1:12:08] Amen. To himself.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; By Jesus Christ. By Jesus Christ, which
[1:12:13] is himself made flesh. To himself
[1:12:16] according to the good pleasure. Good
[1:12:18] pleasure of whose will? yours. No. To
[1:12:20] the pleasure of his will.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Not your will. It's his will. [snorts]
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; To the praise of the glory of his grace.
[1:12:32] That grace is given to you by divine
[1:12:34] enabling enabling you to receive his
[1:12:38] will.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; He you didn't produce it. You never He
[1:12:42] by grace gave it freely. He by grace did
[1:12:46] it for you already because you needed
[1:12:49] it. He could do it. So he provided it.
[1:12:52] That's grace.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So
[1:12:58] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:13:00] wherein he hath made us already he
[1:13:04] already hath past tense made us accepted
[1:13:08] in the beloved which is Jesus Christ
[1:13:11] himself our Lord.
[1:13:13] All right.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; In whom? There again. In whom. In him we
[1:13:19] have redemption through his blood.
[1:13:21] What's redemption? Calling back. Buying
[1:13:23] back
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; by purchase what he owned.
[1:13:29] Amen. What he had already had. See, he
[1:13:32] had you already. You think, well, I I I
[1:13:35] He already got you. He's already had
[1:13:37] you.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:39] He's calling you
[1:13:41] for what? Let go and let me have my way.
[1:13:48] Now his way is perfect. Your way is not
[1:13:50] perfect. Your way, human way, carnal way
[1:13:54] is the way of death.
[1:13:57] His way is eternal life.
[1:14:01] Amen. So let him have his way. He's
[1:14:03] perfect in all his ways. He can't be
[1:14:05] imperfect. If he's imperfect, he fails.
[1:14:10] His word can't fail. Heavens and earth
[1:14:11] will pass away, but my words will never
[1:14:13] pass away.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And because you were in him to begin
[1:14:17] with, you're a part of himself, the
[1:14:19] word. Then how are you going to pass
[1:14:21] away? You're ordained. I don't care if
[1:14:23] you have to take you and strangle you to
[1:14:25] get you to it. He'll do it
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; to bring you to himself
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; because he's not going to miss what he's
[1:14:32] ordained.
[1:14:35] I can't. The Bible said I can't lose
[1:14:37] them. All the father has given me will
[1:14:40] come and I cannot lose them.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the father which gave them
[1:14:47] them me he said is is overall and how
[1:14:52] can I lose them because I and my father
[1:14:54] are one.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; See there's not a trinity involved here.
[1:14:57] It's God himself.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. I've got to press
[1:15:04] on.
[1:15:05] to the praise of the glory of his grace,
[1:15:07] wherein he hath made accepted in the
[1:15:08] beloved, in whom we have redemption
[1:15:10] through the blood, the forgiveness of
[1:15:12] sins, according to the riches of his
[1:15:13] grace, wherein he hath abounded toward
[1:15:16] us in all wisdom and prudence, having
[1:15:18] made known, isn't this beautiful? Where
[1:15:21] do you see yourself doing anything in
[1:15:22] works here?
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "Wherein," see,
[1:15:27] having made, now watch this scripture
[1:15:29] very closely, "Having made known unto us
[1:15:31] the secret
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; of his will, the mystery of his will,
[1:15:36] according to his good," whose pleasure?
[1:15:39] His good pleasure
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; which he hath purposed. Now, I want you
[1:15:43] to hold that purpose because God has a
[1:15:46] heart purpose that he wanted to achieve.
[1:15:48] And he hath purposed. This is this is
[1:15:52] what he hath purposed in himself that in
[1:15:55] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:15:57] times which we are now in. He might
[1:16:00] gather together in one, not in two, not
[1:16:04] the father and the son, two different
[1:16:06] individual. No, in one that he might
[1:16:08] gather together in one all things in
[1:16:12] Christ, both which are in heaven and
[1:16:15] which are on earth, even in him.
[1:16:20] Praise the Lord. [snorts]
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; So you see this being personalized is a
[1:16:25] it's it's identifiable as belonging to a
[1:16:28] particular person especially by being
[1:16:31] marked with their name. And so our name
[1:16:34] been changed. Abraham's name had to be
[1:16:37] changed. Our name is being changed.
[1:16:39] Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Because we have now united. And when
[1:16:44] we're birth, our name is changed.
[1:16:47] When Jacob held on and wouldn't let go
[1:16:49] of that one that he wrestled with until
[1:16:51] he his until he had victory over that
[1:16:54] and his name was changed.
[1:16:58] Then a then a then you have conquered.
[1:17:01] Amen. A victory has been had. Now you're
[1:17:05] not going forth to fight and try to get
[1:17:07] victory. Why? Because you already have
[1:17:10] victory, bride. You are victory. You are
[1:17:12] the victory. You are that victory in
[1:17:15] him. You are his victory because you are
[1:17:17] his word made manifest.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts]
[1:17:23] To personify and we'll come to that
[1:17:25] quote after a while. Maybe not today,
[1:17:28] but we will come back to that. Personify
[1:17:30] is something
[1:17:32] especially a deity or spirit. Other
[1:17:35] words, he personifying by personalizing
[1:17:37] himself in you. He is personifying
[1:17:40] himself.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:43] in the bride form. Now, just hold that
[1:17:46] because you say, "I don't understand
[1:17:48] that." Well, it's all right. Just hold
[1:17:49] to it. Romans 6:23.
[1:17:54] [snorts] Amen. The book of Romans,
[1:17:56] chapter 6, verse 23. Very simple verse.
[1:18:00] You probably learned it from a a child.
[1:18:02] Amen. Just like John 3:16. But it holds
[1:18:05] a mystery.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; For the wages of sin is death. Now, if
[1:18:11] you want to get right down what it is,
[1:18:12] sin is unbelief. Unbelief of the word of
[1:18:15] God. You know, to do good and don't do
[1:18:18] it, that is iniquity. And sin is
[1:18:20] unbelief.
[1:18:23] Unbelief of the word. The reason you do
[1:18:26] things out here and the world does
[1:18:28] things, smoking, drinking, prostitution,
[1:18:30] all these other things going on, all
[1:18:33] these evil things is because they don't
[1:18:35] believe the word. Now when they come
[1:18:37] face to face with the word, if they
[1:18:39] reject the word, then that seals it off,
[1:18:43] if they reject it,
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; but if they can receive it. Amen. Then
[1:18:50] that is wiped away. You never were a
[1:18:52] sinner to begin with. But sin is
[1:18:54] unbelief.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And and you say, "How do you say you
[1:18:57] weren't a sinner?" Because he that's
[1:18:59] born of God, and we're coming into that,
[1:19:02] does not commit sin. because the seed of
[1:19:05] God remainth in him and he cannot sin.
[1:19:08] Now, I'm talking about the birth born of
[1:19:10] God. The reason you can be born of God,
[1:19:13] this is what we're trying to get across
[1:19:14] here this morning or these services is
[1:19:17] that to be born of God, something's got
[1:19:19] to be in you already.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; It's just not everybody can be born of
[1:19:24] God.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Because we're talking about a real gift
[1:19:30] here.
[1:19:33] All right. Now,
[1:19:36] so the wages of sin is death.
[1:19:39] That death is not death in the flesh.
[1:19:41] That's an eternal separation from God.
[1:19:45] The wages of sin, that's wages. You're
[1:19:48] working every day as hard as you can. If
[1:19:50] you won't accept the word of God, you're
[1:19:52] working the hardest you can to die.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; You're going one way or the other. Are
[1:19:59] you either going upward or you're going
[1:20:01] downward?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; You see how the word does a separating?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that does separating. The
[1:20:12] word of God will always separate.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; It separates truth from air,
[1:20:19] truth from a lie, death to life, it
[1:20:22] separates it. Light and darkness, it
[1:20:24] separates it.
[1:20:27] Let there be light. spoken word manifest
[1:20:29] right there. Spoken word, original seed.
[1:20:31] And there was light.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; So it separated light from darkness.
[1:20:37] Amen. All right. And so you're sitting
[1:20:39] here receiving and hearing a word that
[1:20:41] will separate light from darkness.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; It's speaking beyond your physical
[1:20:47] being, your mental. It's speaking down
[1:20:49] in your soul. That's what this message
[1:20:51] will do. The message of the hour will
[1:20:53] do. The message this morning will do. It
[1:20:55] will separate you. Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; To life,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; dark light.
[1:21:02] The Bible said in Isaiah 60:1, "Arise,
[1:21:05] shine." Speaking to you and I, "For thy
[1:21:07] light is come." I just read it here. Men
[1:21:10] love darkness rather than light because
[1:21:12] the light exposed their deeds.
[1:21:15] It manifests what's in their heart. But
[1:21:18] if what if light comes on your scene and
[1:21:20] it manifests something, then right then
[1:21:22] the love of God is shown to you. Because
[1:21:24] when light doth make manifest the air,
[1:21:27] you have a choice to make. You can
[1:21:29] either accept right, accept the truth,
[1:21:32] accept the God who exposed it, or stay
[1:21:35] where you're at
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; and deny it. Now, that's exactly where
[1:21:39] every one of us, including myself, I'm
[1:21:41] just a preacher. I'm preaching it. I'm
[1:21:43] not responsible for how you react or
[1:21:45] whether you can get it or not. I'm
[1:21:47] responsible for bringing it. I have to
[1:21:49] It's given to me. I've got to do the
[1:21:51] same as you. Yes.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I've got to make my calling in election
[1:21:55] sure.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; A preacher doesn't mean he's anything.
[1:21:59] He's a servant to serve his people
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; and feed them the word for the season,
[1:22:05] not another season. If I was up here
[1:22:07] preaching and speak and preaching the
[1:22:09] word of Pentecost, which is another
[1:22:10] season, I would be out of order. But
[1:22:13] when I come preaching what's here 62
[1:22:15] years later after a prophecy of the word
[1:22:18] turning from the prophet to his prophecy
[1:22:20] and see the prophecy manifest if I don't
[1:22:23] preach that to you I'm not preaching the
[1:22:25] word for the season.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:33] All right. So St. John 14. So we see
[1:22:38] then it's death but the gift of God.
[1:22:40] Watch this verse in here on 23rd verse.
[1:22:43] For the gift of God is eternal life.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that steady. The gift
[1:22:50] singular gift. The gift of God is
[1:22:53] eternal life.
[1:22:55] Other words, it's God.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; The gift of God is God himself.
[1:23:01] If you've thoroughly repented and
[1:23:03] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:23:05] taking that name publicly, showing that
[1:23:07] you believe what he did for you, the
[1:23:09] Bible said you shall receive the gift of
[1:23:12] God.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God knows your heart. He
[1:23:18] knows what you came up there for. He
[1:23:20] knows whether you were sincere in doing
[1:23:22] it. He knows whether you realize you're
[1:23:23] a sinner and turned around and made a
[1:23:26] 180°ree turn and repented.
[1:23:28] And when you're willing to accept that
[1:23:30] and say, "I believe him and I'm willing
[1:23:32] to live for him." And you take that
[1:23:34] baptism, which is just a a natural act.
[1:23:37] Water does not save you. You believe in
[1:23:39] the blood. And reason you take that
[1:23:41] baptism because you're taking it in the
[1:23:43] very life which he is in his name.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; And you shall receive the gift. Say,
[1:23:51] "How do you know, brother David? I've
[1:23:52] got it.
[1:23:58] It works.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; It's positive. That's the truth.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; But there going to be a lot of them go
[1:24:04] down wet ones and come up go down dry
[1:24:07] ones in baptism. Come up wet ones
[1:24:09] because they haven't really repented.
[1:24:11] Haven't really got the got the
[1:24:13] revelation that Jesus Christ took their
[1:24:15] iniquity and all their sin and took it
[1:24:17] to on the head and put it on the head of
[1:24:19] the devil. And through his blood and his
[1:24:21] blood only were you delivered. You've
[1:24:24] come to the blood. If you've come to the
[1:24:26] blood, what do you expect to receive?
[1:24:27] The life of it. Because on the other
[1:24:30] side of that is that shakina glory is
[1:24:33] that power of God himself down in there
[1:24:36] in your soul.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, St. John 14.
[1:24:44] [snorts]
[1:24:46] St. John 14.
[1:24:49] [clears throat]
[1:24:52] And we'll read verse
[1:24:55] 20.
[1:24:56] At that day, now isn't that a strange
[1:24:59] statement that Jesus speaking of another
[1:25:01] day.
[1:25:04] Where was he speaking down to? If you
[1:25:06] flow follow through the scriptures, he
[1:25:08] was speaking of our day
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; at that day. Think Jesus knew you. Isn't
[1:25:15] it lovely to know? You can even go to
[1:25:17] St. John 17 and realize Jesus prayed for
[1:25:20] you. Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; You can find it right in the scripture.
[1:25:23] Every one of you can go back in the
[1:25:25] scripture and see where Jesus prayed for
[1:25:26] you.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; You think his prayer will be answered?
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; You see? See, so we find then that in
[1:25:39] this day, another day, at that day, you
[1:25:42] he's speaking of ye and ye is you. Are
[1:25:44] there any Yees here? Certainly.
[1:25:48] That's you, an individual.
[1:25:51] Ye shall know. You shall not imagine.
[1:25:55] You're not going to hope. So, it's
[1:25:57] something that will be revealed to you
[1:25:59] by grace.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; You shall know that I am in my father.
[1:26:08] So, where was his identification?
[1:26:11] His father in his father. And where was
[1:26:14] his father?
[1:26:18] I'm in my father, ye in me, and I'm in
[1:26:22] you.
[1:26:24] Then if he's identified by the father,
[1:26:26] where was the father? It was in him.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I'm in my father, my father in me, I in
[1:26:32] you.
[1:26:35] Who is that I then speaking? It's the
[1:26:38] same person, the same God. I in you and
[1:26:42] you in me.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to be unveiled. The mystery,
[1:26:46] the secret will be unveiled. You always
[1:26:48] were in me.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. Now, [snorts] you
[1:26:56] have not chosen me, but I've chosen you.
[1:26:58] Now, according to the word of God, the
[1:27:00] bride was chosen before the foundation
[1:27:02] of the world. And the choosing of the
[1:27:04] bride, watch, was purposed in himself.
[1:27:08] Ephesians 1:9. So, the purposing wasn't
[1:27:12] your purpose. It was already purposed in
[1:27:14] him. I'm going to have a bride of my
[1:27:17] choosing.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; If he said he was going to have a bride,
[1:27:21] do you think that word's going to be
[1:27:22] fulfilled? It's got to be fulfilled.
[1:27:24] Every word's got to be fulfilled. And
[1:27:26] here am I and here in you, born of his
[1:27:28] spirit, fulfilling that scripture.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yes. All right. Now, so in Romans
[1:27:38] 9:11,
[1:27:40] it says that the purpose of God
[1:27:42] according to election might stand.
[1:27:46] It's not the person that it's not David
[1:27:48] out here, David that come predestinated
[1:27:50] eternally from God. Though he knew it
[1:27:52] before the foundation world, what color
[1:27:54] hair have, what I'd look like, my
[1:27:55] stature, and all about it. But that's
[1:27:57] not what comes predestinated eternally.
[1:28:00] That's not what was in God to begin with
[1:28:02] eternally. It's the thought that he had
[1:28:05] and the seed that he expressed that
[1:28:08] thought into word that was the seed
[1:28:10] that's what comes from God eternally.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Now he said in in Romans nine, Jacob I
[1:28:17] loved and Esau hated. How come he could
[1:28:19] say one he loved and the other he hated
[1:28:22] when neither boy was born? Neither had
[1:28:25] done good works or evil works. How could
[1:28:27] he say Jacob I love? knowing Jacob would
[1:28:31] be there, how he would be born through
[1:28:33] through appearance, through a sexual
[1:28:35] birth. But there's something in Jacob's
[1:28:37] soul that he already knew was there. And
[1:28:40] that was his seed. He planted it there.
[1:28:42] Other words, he predestinated eternally
[1:28:44] that seed to be in Jacob.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; And Jacob came with that seed. And Esau,
[1:28:51] he said, I hated because Esau did not
[1:28:53] believe the word. Sold his birthright,
[1:28:56] would not accept the word. And so we
[1:28:59] have many Esau today. They won't accept
[1:29:01] it either. Neither have they in any age.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; There's always been unbelievers. There's
[1:29:06] always been real true believers. And
[1:29:08] there's some that just make believe.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; They aren't sold out to Christ. They're
[1:29:13] just make believers. Well, we'll accept
[1:29:15] the message. We'll make it a religion.
[1:29:16] We have it as a religion, as something
[1:29:18] we can do. We can come to church. We can
[1:29:20] do that. I've done my service. No. That
[1:29:23] will not save you.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; You might as well just right now know
[1:29:26] that cannot save you. never will save
[1:29:28] you. Never did save anybody. But I
[1:29:31] believe in going to church. If you
[1:29:32] really love the Lord, you want to be
[1:29:34] where the word is.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; But that in itself will not save.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's only one place at
[1:29:44] salvation and that's in Jesus Christ,
[1:29:46] the revealed word for your day and time.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You either can respond positively to
[1:29:53] that or negative. You've come right.
[1:29:55] You've come in contact with it. Now,
[1:29:57] what will you do with this Jesus called
[1:29:59] Christ that was, that is, now, and will
[1:30:03] be?
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with him?
[1:30:10] You leave out of this tabernacle, he's
[1:30:11] on your hands.
[1:30:13] He's on my hands. He's on every one of
[1:30:15] our hands. What are you going to do with
[1:30:17] him?
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Today, the traditions of man have
[1:30:24] crucified him. Aresh right from the very
[1:30:27] pulpits of denominationalism which was
[1:30:29] not of God.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Never was, never will be.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; God never formed a denomination, never
[1:30:38] had one.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; All right. I got off a little track
[1:30:44] here. Let's pick it up again.
[1:30:47] So, the purpose of God is being manifest
[1:30:51] according to election.
[1:30:53] You can't read it any other way. The
[1:30:56] heart purpose of the eternal or the
[1:30:58] eternal purpose of God was to take a
[1:31:01] bride of his own choosing. And that
[1:31:02] purpose was in himself. And being
[1:31:04] eternal was decreed before the
[1:31:06] foundation of the world.
[1:31:09] Before there was ever a speck of
[1:31:11] stardust, before God was even God. You
[1:31:13] say, "How can that be?" He's eternal
[1:31:15] spirit. God, the word God is an object
[1:31:18] of worship. You can worship anything. As
[1:31:20] I said Wednesday, you can worship
[1:31:22] yourself.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; So God is an object of worship, but he
[1:31:26] had nothing to worship him. For the
[1:31:28] first thing he created were angels and
[1:31:30] they worshiped him.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Then he became God.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; But before God, he's still that eternal
[1:31:37] spirit had no beginning and no end. Now
[1:31:39] you in your own carnal finite mind, in
[1:31:42] your little pea brain, my pa brain, we
[1:31:44] cannot comprehend what eternal is. We
[1:31:48] never will until we're step into that
[1:31:50] body.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; But it never had a beginning and never
[1:31:54] has an end.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you just love to be tested by
[1:31:58] the word?
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what happens, what it
[1:32:04] if you put whatever your case is in
[1:32:06] God's hands and stand by that word, God
[1:32:08] is going to fulfill it and manifest it
[1:32:10] in his time and his season.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care what struggles you're going
[1:32:16] through. I don't care how much pressure
[1:32:17] is on you. Put it in God's hands. Just
[1:32:19] put it in his hand. That's what Job had
[1:32:21] to do. He put it in God's hands. You
[1:32:23] know, God has two hands.
[1:32:26] He has a right hand and a left hand. Job
[1:32:28] said, "I see him on the left hand doing
[1:32:30] his work. And the right hand, I can't
[1:32:32] find him. But the right hand is what
[1:32:34] holds you. The left hand is working
[1:32:35] daily, bringing you to right where you
[1:32:37] should be by revelation."
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're in his hands, brother,
[1:32:42] sister. You're you're either in his
[1:32:44] hands or you're not in his hands. And if
[1:32:46] you're in his hands, you were in his
[1:32:47] hands to begin with. You can't produce
[1:32:49] enough works to get in his hands. You
[1:32:51] either already were or you're not. And
[1:32:53] it depends on your attitude right here
[1:32:55] this morning about the word that's being
[1:32:57] preached to you can determine to you
[1:32:59] your eternal destiny.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; I don't have to know your thoughts. God
[1:33:05] does.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "That's straightforward. You
[1:33:10] might as well preach it straight." Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Why jump around the bend with it?
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's true. That's right.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Am I afraid of somebody disagreeing with
[1:33:19] it? No, I'm not afraid of somebody
[1:33:21] disagreeing with it. Is the word going
[1:33:22] to offend going to not offend anybody?
[1:33:24] Nonsense. The word the word brought
[1:33:26] forth in this season will offend
[1:33:27] someone.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; It always has.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't offend the believer.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; I don't have an I don't have an an a
[1:33:38] something in my heart to offend you.
[1:33:39] I'll just be a smart and I'll offend
[1:33:41] you. No, that's not If that was in my
[1:33:42] heart, I need an altar.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; I have nothing but love in my heart to
[1:33:46] tell you the truth.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I can't preach it like brother Paul.
[1:33:50] Paul can't preach it like me. I can't
[1:33:52] preach it like the next man over here.
[1:33:54] They each one have their position in
[1:33:55] place. And his ministry will differ
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; in how they produce and how they bring
[1:34:00] forth the word. But they serve one
[1:34:02] person.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Every member of that body serves one
[1:34:05] person, one individual, one headship.
[1:34:08] Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And they can't bring it something that's
[1:34:10] contrary to the word for the hour and
[1:34:12] the season.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; If you're true seed of God, you will
[1:34:17] recognize and hear the word for your
[1:34:19] season 62 years down the line.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Where are we at now? What is the season?
[1:34:25] What's happening?
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Are we just floating around? I believe
[1:34:29] God sent a prophet. Brother, sister,
[1:34:31] that's that's unpassed. You might as
[1:34:33] well just recognize something right now.
[1:34:35] That prophet had a message. And the
[1:34:37] message is right here, right now,
[1:34:39] manifesting what he said he would do.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; And besides that, the Bible said that
[1:34:47] the bride is the final voice to the
[1:34:49] final age.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; What voice? The same voice.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; She recognizes her season and declares
[1:34:56] it and preaches it and lives it.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And she's counted an oddball. She's
[1:35:01] counted a radical. She's counted
[1:35:03] everything in the book. What difference
[1:35:05] does that make? God loves me
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; and I love him.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; If I loved him, I'm gonna keep his word
[1:35:13] because that's dominant. That's
[1:35:15] absolute.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:35:22] [snorts]
[1:35:22] so before there was a a speck of
[1:35:25] stardust,
[1:35:27] he chose his own bride was purposed in
[1:35:29] himself and being eternal was decreed
[1:35:31] before the foundation of the world and
[1:35:33] before a speck of stardust. Before God
[1:35:35] was God, he was known only as an eternal
[1:35:38] spirit. The bride, that's you and I this
[1:35:41] morning, right here, the bride was
[1:35:42] already in his mind.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; She was existing. In other words, she
[1:35:48] was substance in him, not just an
[1:35:50] imagination. It was faith in him.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; And being eternal was decreed before the
[1:35:59] foundation of the world. And she was
[1:36:02] existing in his mind. And what about
[1:36:04] those thoughts of God that you are? They
[1:36:06] are eternal. Are they not? Down through
[1:36:08] the centuries we go. We find a Moses. We
[1:36:11] find a Jeremiah, a John, a Baptist, John
[1:36:13] the Baptist. Each one of those were
[1:36:15] God's eternal thoughts expressed in his
[1:36:17] season. Then we come to Jesus the logos.
[1:36:20] Now don't be stumbled by that word. What
[1:36:23] you have here is a written word called
[1:36:25] remma. But in behind this letter is a
[1:36:28] thought.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; That's hidden behind this letter. And
[1:36:32] that is logos.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; That was before this was even in print.
[1:36:36] God spoke the word. Amen. And the word
[1:36:39] was manifested.
[1:36:42] Job didn't have the Bible we have, but
[1:36:44] he had the
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; logos.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; He knew the word. He knew who he was and
[1:36:50] he worshiped. And all that he did know,
[1:36:52] God revealed it to him. God Job had the
[1:36:55] mind of God for his season and his time
[1:36:58] and he expressed it and he lived it
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; and he struggled with it and he suffered
[1:37:03] through it and he suffered with it. But
[1:37:05] in the end,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; what happened?
[1:37:10] Same thing is going to happen to you if
[1:37:12] you hold to this promise.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So,
[1:37:18] so you see here that the logos. Then we
[1:37:21] come to Jesus.
[1:37:23] He uh St. John 1:1 in the beginning was
[1:37:26] the word and the word was with God and
[1:37:28] the word was God. We've come to Jesus
[1:37:31] which was the perfect and complete
[1:37:34] thought of God expressed and he became
[1:37:37] known as the word. In other words, Jesus
[1:37:39] was the the complete Godhead bodily. The
[1:37:42] fullness of God bodily. Everything God
[1:37:45] had in his heart, everything he had in
[1:37:47] his mind, his bride, everything was
[1:37:49] expressed in Jesus Christ. So therefore,
[1:37:53] you being his seed was in him. Then
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; then the sin question is finished. The
[1:37:59] sick question is finished. It's all
[1:38:01] finished.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Who's able to take the word and say it's
[1:38:04] finished? Who's able to say, "I put it
[1:38:06] in your hands because I believe what you
[1:38:08] said."
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, we find him then
[1:38:17] the complete expression and he became
[1:38:19] known as the word. That's what he is. He
[1:38:22] is not was that's what he was, but
[1:38:24] that's what he is.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And forever will be. He's the I
[1:38:32] was and is and shall come. Revelations 1
[1:38:37] speaks of that same person in his full
[1:38:39] revelation of himself. He which was
[1:38:43] which is and shall come.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; There were where were you? You was you
[1:38:49] is and you are going to be
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; to come the same.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; All right. Who's spiritual enough that
[1:39:01] can say amen to that? Whether you
[1:39:03] understand it or not, it's still the
[1:39:04] truth.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? It's the truth.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; That which is and forever will be. Now
[1:39:18] it says he hath chosen us in him. Jesus,
[1:39:21] he's chosen us in him.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; How you going to lose?
[1:39:26] Do you think God's going to choose you
[1:39:28] in him then throw you out?
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; He's not an Indian giver.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; He chose you. He's going to keep you.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And it's up to him to do it.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; It's only up to you to believe.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; And that determines what's in you.
[1:39:48] Because if you're a part of him, you
[1:39:50] will believe. You can't deny it. I don't
[1:39:52] care how many things you have to go
[1:39:54] through. I don't care how much the
[1:39:55] outside thinks differently. You You're a
[1:39:58] dual person. You have two natures.
[1:40:00] You've got one nature inside of you.
[1:40:01] You're born again. Is the nature of the
[1:40:03] word himself. It's himself. You have an
[1:40:06] outside man that's carnal, sticky. It's
[1:40:08] going to bother you because we're born
[1:40:10] of sin.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; They come in the world in sin, shaped in
[1:40:13] iniquity, speaking lies.
[1:40:16] It's not this that's born again. It's
[1:40:19] that soul where I came from. God saw
[1:40:21] that and produced that birth. And that
[1:40:23] birth will take me to the change of this
[1:40:26] body. That's the power. That's the
[1:40:29] revelation. That's the rapture that's
[1:40:31] going on right now that's going to take
[1:40:32] me to that body change
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; because that word is growing in the
[1:40:36] formation. It's growing in a bride to a
[1:40:38] full stature of himself. The bride is
[1:40:41] not going to grow up and be perfect
[1:40:43] someday in the flesh. No,
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; it's perfect in him. It grows up in him,
[1:40:48] becomes him. And what's happening today
[1:40:50] is the revelation I am him.
[1:40:54] I'm not another person. The bride's not
[1:40:56] another person. She is him.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; She's bone of his bone, flesh of his
[1:41:01] flesh. Just as Eve was bone of Adam,
[1:41:03] bone, flesh of his flesh. She was him.
[1:41:05] So is the bride today. Him, Christ, the
[1:41:08] word in you.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; And Paul said, I live by that word,
[1:41:14] operate by that word, which workketh in
[1:41:17] me mightily.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. [snorts] Now,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; now it says that he hath chosen us in
[1:41:27] him, Jesus. That means you were right
[1:41:30] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[1:41:32] of God, God's thoughts, God's eternal
[1:41:34] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:41:36] world. That gives an eternal quality to
[1:41:38] you, the elect.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. Acts 21:17.
[1:41:44] Let's go over there. I'm going to I'm
[1:41:46] going to have to close now pretty quick
[1:41:47] here. And I'm I'm not even hardly
[1:41:49] started, but I'm going to close.
[1:41:53] I know you're scared to death. I'm going
[1:41:55] to go too long. The enemy tried to wear
[1:41:57] that down me at all day. I said, "I'm
[1:42:00] not going to hear you, Satan. I'm not
[1:42:01] going to hear you, but Lord, I'll hear
[1:42:02] you."
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I couldn't you if you want me to
[1:42:07] take another two hours,
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; but you're not.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and I understand that. But let
[1:42:16] me find a closing place. Okay, give me
[1:42:18] that much grace. Let me find a closing
[1:42:20] spot here. Acts 21:17.
[1:42:24] And I may just have to close on this
[1:42:25] scripture real close here. Acts 2:17.
[1:42:30] Now Sundays we have a little better
[1:42:32] opportunity. Wednesdays is hard. You
[1:42:35] work, you're here, you're live, you're
[1:42:37] in the morning. Yeah, brother David.
[1:42:40] Preach. Don't go past my lunchtime.
[1:42:45] Okay. You say, "Well, I I'm not, brother
[1:42:47] David. That's just facitious." No. Let's
[1:42:49] go real deep.
[1:42:52] Where's the motive? I'm not judging you.
[1:42:54] I just know how the devil works. What's
[1:42:57] the motive and objective?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Not of your outer man. Oh, I can I don't
[1:43:02] believe that, brother. Okay. What's down
[1:43:04] inside? Are you listening to your heart
[1:43:06] or are you listening to your thinking?
[1:43:10] All right. Now, you say, "Boy, that was
[1:43:12] tough." Yeah, it's tough for me, too. It
[1:43:14] speaks to me. I'm not the only one.
[1:43:16] What's coming out of my mouth speaks to
[1:43:18] me.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; I may have one finger out here, but I've
[1:43:22] got one, two, three, four, five, six,
[1:43:24] seven pointed back.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; All right. So, Acts 21:17 where the day
[1:43:35] of Pentecost and he said verse 15, for
[1:43:38] these are not drunken as you suppose,
[1:43:40] seeing as but the third hour of the day
[1:43:41] they come busting out of that room. They
[1:43:44] were filled with the Holy Ghost and the
[1:43:45] and the promise of Joel was being
[1:43:48] fulfilled and Peter speaks of it right
[1:43:50] here. This is prophecy being fulfilled
[1:43:53] in their season.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand that. What's your
[1:43:58] season?
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; All right. But this is that which was
[1:44:04] spoken. Other words, this is that which
[1:44:06] prophet which God spoke through Joel.
[1:44:09] This is that which spoken by the prophet
[1:44:11] Joel. This is what he said. And it shall
[1:44:13] come to pass what God said. It shall
[1:44:14] come to pass in the last days, sayaith
[1:44:17] God, I will pour out my spirit upon all,
[1:44:22] say it,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; flesh.
[1:44:26] I'm going to pour out my spirit upon all
[1:44:28] the ground.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that because the
[1:44:35] spirit that was poured out was the Holy
[1:44:37] Spirit here. was poured out upon all
[1:44:40] flesh. And your sons and daughters shall
[1:44:42] prophesy, and your young men shall see
[1:44:44] visions, and your old men shall dream
[1:44:46] dreams, [snorts]
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and upon my servants, and on my
[1:44:50] handmaids, I'll pour out of those days
[1:44:52] of my spirit. Then they shall prophesy.
[1:44:55] That's a gift. And they will show
[1:44:57] wonders. They can do that by the spirit.
[1:44:59] And at heaven above, and signs in the
[1:45:01] earth beneath, blood, fire, and vapor
[1:45:03] smoke. The sun shall be turned into
[1:45:05] darkness, the moon into blood before the
[1:45:07] great and notable day of the Lord. We
[1:45:09] know that's happening.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Not only did it, but it does. These are
[1:45:14] signs. And it shall come to pass that
[1:45:15] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[1:45:18] Lord shall be saved.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Here there's signs going out. There's
[1:45:25] wonders. All done by the power of the
[1:45:28] Holy Spirit.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Anybody disagree with that? Every gift,
[1:45:34] everything was ordained and ordered of
[1:45:36] God.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? And this spirit
[1:45:40] fell upon all flesh and and there would
[1:45:42] be people do that and do those things
[1:45:44] and never know the word for the season.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; And you say, "How can that be?" It's the
[1:45:52] Holy Spirit being poured out. Is that
[1:45:53] right? That's the mystery
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; and that's what I want to get into and I
[1:46:00] don't have time to do it, but I'm laying
[1:46:01] a foundation. And if that's all I can
[1:46:03] lay here this morning, then I lay the
[1:46:05] foundation.
[1:46:07] So we go to to Matthew 5:45. This is
[1:46:10] where it's poured out. Now, let's go
[1:46:11] back to Matthew a minute and go to
[1:46:14] Matthew the 5th chapter
[1:46:17] and the 45th verse.
[1:46:22] That you may be the children of your
[1:46:24] father which is in heaven.
[1:46:30] For he maketh his son.
[1:46:34] His son.
[1:46:35] Who's his son? You say, "Well, that's
[1:46:38] natural son." He's saying the natural
[1:46:40] typing the spiritual here. For he maketh
[1:46:43] his son to rise on the evil. Oh, now
[1:46:46] wait a minute. His son to rise on the
[1:46:49] evil and the good. And he sendeth rain.
[1:46:53] Son was him and rain was his spirit.
[1:46:58] Both are him. and he maketh his son and
[1:47:02] and he on the good and sendeth rain on
[1:47:06] the just. Now you say, "Well, that's
[1:47:08] natural." But the word just and unjust
[1:47:10] is not a natural thing.
[1:47:13] Now Jesus turned it around and said,
[1:47:14] "This is a spiritual thing I'm pouring
[1:47:16] out." What is he pouring out upon it?
[1:47:20] The same rain that fell upon all flesh.
[1:47:24] Amen. Now, now this is the mystery.
[1:47:29] So the mystery, if it's a mystery in
[1:47:31] this hour, had to be made known.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; It had to be unveiled. It had to be
[1:47:36] revealed.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; That mystery. Is that right?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. So we see then he poured out his
[1:47:43] rain. He poured out his spirit upon all
[1:47:45] flesh. Nothing wrong with the spirit.
[1:47:48] The spirit is genuine.
[1:47:52] I'm going to come into some pretty
[1:47:53] potent things. as the prophet said and
[1:47:57] you just God bear with me and I trust
[1:47:59] you come back.
[1:48:03] You want to hear the rest of the story
[1:48:06] as we go on here. I'm going to find a
[1:48:08] place to quit
[1:48:10] and on the and and it falls upon the
[1:48:12] just. The rain and the sun both fall are
[1:48:15] come upon the just and the unjust.
[1:48:18] What's just mean? Justified.
[1:48:21] God's declared you're righteous because
[1:48:23] you were a part of him and knew him and
[1:48:25] he knew you before the foundation of the
[1:48:27] world. And therefore, you're justified
[1:48:29] as though you never sinned in the first
[1:48:31] place.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; You never sinned before the beginning.
[1:48:34] He saw you perfect because you were in
[1:48:36] him.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; All right? So, the sun shining, those
[1:48:41] things are brought to mature the seed.
[1:48:44] So whatever the seed was in the ground,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; whether it's just or unjust, that same
[1:48:52] Holy Ghost, will bring forth both.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're seeing happen
[1:49:00] today because maturity is upon us.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; We've laid in the presence 62 years down
[1:49:06] here. What's happening? that spirit, the
[1:49:09] Holy Spirit himself, a genuine baptism
[1:49:11] of the Holy Spirit can fall. I'm going
[1:49:13] to go a little jump ahead a little bit,
[1:49:15] but it's going to fall upon the just and
[1:49:16] the unjust. It's going to baptize the
[1:49:19] unjust.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And it's going to baptize the just,
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; but each seed is going to bring forth of
[1:49:27] its kind through the period of time.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Even though they declare they have, see,
[1:49:33] they declare I believe this message, but
[1:49:36] they can't live it.
[1:49:38] By their fruits they're known and the
[1:49:41] fruit is the fruit for the season where
[1:49:43] you're at today.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Are you recognizing the day? Do you
[1:49:49] recognize? Are you just going back 60
[1:49:53] years ago and saying, "Well, wasn't that
[1:49:54] a wonderful message? We'll lift up that
[1:49:56] and we'll lift up that and propagate
[1:49:58] that." That's not saving you at all.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; That's not seed of God at all. The seed
[1:50:04] of God is in the promise of the word for
[1:50:07] now
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; today. What did that message do?
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; What did it start? It started a growth.
[1:50:14] And not only that, he looked up to
[1:50:16] heaven and pointed us to the astronomic
[1:50:18] of heaven and said, "There's a bride.
[1:50:20] There's an infant bride coming forth
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; and the latter rain's going to fall out,
[1:50:25] which would be the rapturing faith
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; upon that bride. Going to bring
[1:50:29] something that she has in her. And we're
[1:50:30] going to start a rapture cycle. And it's
[1:50:32] going to go on until that rapture leaves
[1:50:34] and goes
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; because the bride has come to the
[1:50:38] realization what she is.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Now there's a lot of words left right in
[1:50:44] there. And I'm showing you the pouring
[1:50:46] out of that. Notice here the life was it
[1:50:49] was in the husk. So you had you had a
[1:50:54] wheat plant coming up. It went into the
[1:50:55] ground. It died under denominationalism.
[1:50:58] It started coming forth in Luther. Wes
[1:51:01] Luther justification made way for
[1:51:03] Wesley's message of sanctification.
[1:51:06] Wesley's message of sanctification made
[1:51:08] way for the Pentecostal baptism and
[1:51:10] restoration of the gifts.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; But what did that bring forth?
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; There was many baptized. Many thought
[1:51:18] they were born again and are not.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Because they cannot receive the except
[1:51:23] the perfect word. the Holy Ghost himself
[1:51:26] is not made manifest and real in their
[1:51:28] soul.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; They can go as far as sanctification and
[1:51:32] it's all right. I'm not saying they're
[1:51:34] lost, but they'll never make the
[1:51:35] rapture.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that at the judgment
[1:51:39] sometime they stand before them and
[1:51:41] because they are saved people, virgins
[1:51:42] like the foolish virgin, they will
[1:51:44] receive and get eternal life at that
[1:51:46] time. But the bride doesn't stand before
[1:51:50] the white throne judgment.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; She stands in the throne judging. Amen.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Because she's judged right now by an
[1:51:56] open book.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; She's judged right now by the revelation
[1:52:00] of that book being open. And there's
[1:52:02] only a certain number of people. I'm
[1:52:03] talking You say, "What book?" I'm
[1:52:05] talking about the marriage certificate.
[1:52:06] The book, the lamb's book, the book of
[1:52:08] life.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Both foolish and wise had the word, but
[1:52:14] only the wise had the oil.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; They both had the rema. They both knew
[1:52:18] God sent a prophet. They both knew that
[1:52:20] he had a message, but only one could
[1:52:23] hear it. and receive it and enter into
[1:52:25] marriage.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; They that were ready went into the
[1:52:29] marriage with him.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right? With him.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; And that's the mystery. And that's the
[1:52:36] secret right now is that union, that
[1:52:38] invisible union is a secret to everyone
[1:52:42] but the bride. She holds that mystery
[1:52:45] opened.
[1:52:55] The life that was in the stock went out
[1:52:57] to make the other. Justification made
[1:53:00] way for sanctification. Sanctification
[1:53:02] made way for the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:03] Spirit. And the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:06] Spirit made way for the Holy Spirit or
[1:53:09] Holy Ghost itself, same person to come
[1:53:12] right down in perfection.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Back to the word again. Not and both of
[1:53:22] them. Both of them. Both both the just
[1:53:25] and the unjust. Both the both the seed
[1:53:28] and the tear. Satan planted the tear.
[1:53:32] God planted the wheat. Satan came behind
[1:53:34] him because he's a perverter and planted
[1:53:36] in the same ground
[1:53:39] his seed.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; That's what's happened through these
[1:53:43] years.
[1:53:44] Amen. He came right behind him. Then
[1:53:46] what's taking place? A genuine baptism
[1:53:49] of the Holy Ghost baptizes them both.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the
[1:53:54] anointing. They'll both do signs.
[1:53:56] They'll both do wonders. They'll both
[1:53:58] scream. They'll both shout. And I'm not
[1:54:00] a thing against it. I believe in
[1:54:01] shouting. I believe in signs. I believe
[1:54:03] in wonders. I believe in gifts of the
[1:54:05] spirit. But you can have every one of
[1:54:07] them and not have the word himself
[1:54:09] dwelling in your soul.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; That's pretty quiet around here. But
[1:54:18] that's the truth
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; and that's the mystery. In fact, the
[1:54:21] prophet said we need to teach it
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; and talk about it.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; I can bring you right to where he said
[1:54:28] that. He said, talking about that right
[1:54:30] there, that mystery,
[1:54:33] they're both, and I'm going to come to
[1:54:35] that. I'm going to close. They both come
[1:54:37] to that genuine baptism. There's not a
[1:54:39] wrong, there's nothing wrong with that
[1:54:41] Holy Spirit.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; They are both anointed, but one is
[1:54:45] anointed in the soul because the
[1:54:47] anointing was sent for his seed.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Whatever your soul is, that's who you
[1:54:53] are.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; That's who you are.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; We just begun.
[1:55:07] This might be a three-part service.
[1:55:11] All right, I'm going to make a mark
[1:55:12] here. This is where we ended right here
[1:55:21] because [snorts] we know the swer of the
[1:55:22] good seed was the son of man.
[1:55:26] Look who goes first and look who goes
[1:55:29] follows. Whatever goes first is
[1:55:31] original. Whatever follows is a
[1:55:34] perversion of it.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Satan is a perverter. He's not a
[1:55:38] creator.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; The only thing he can do is add to the
[1:55:41] word or take from it.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; When it leaves that promised original
[1:55:45] seed, be careful. That's not God.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; You say, why did it bring death? Because
[1:55:52] there was a there was a subtle
[1:55:53] instrument called the serpent in the
[1:55:55] beginning
[1:55:57] that fed to Eve reasoning about what God
[1:55:59] said and she accepted it because she
[1:56:02] first had to receive it in her mind
[1:56:04] before the act was fulfilled. She had to
[1:56:07] receive it in her thought first.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:13] [music]
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; And so receiving that, what did it
[1:56:15] bring? You tell me. We all know what it
[1:56:17] brought. It brought death.
[1:56:21] You say, "Well, then why did Adam have
[1:56:22] to do that?" He turned around. She
[1:56:24] turned around and gave to her husband of
[1:56:27] that tree. Said it's pleasant. Adam knew
[1:56:29] exactly. The Bible said Adam was not
[1:56:31] deceived.
[1:56:33] He came straight from God. Eve was a
[1:56:35] byproduct of that man. She wasn't in the
[1:56:38] original creation, but she had the same
[1:56:40] spirit. Took the spirit, the feminine,
[1:56:42] out of Adam, became in a form. But you
[1:56:46] know what God said today? I will restore
[1:56:48] that form back to myself. And that's
[1:56:51] your mystery. We were going to come to
[1:56:52] it. I'll just jump way ahead. That's the
[1:56:54] mystery of who you are.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; But what did Adam do? He said, why did
[1:57:00] he have to partake of it if he knew it?
[1:57:02] He knew when he parttook of that that
[1:57:04] God said, "Don't do." He knew that all
[1:57:07] creation would fall beneath him.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Absolutely, every bit of it.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; But God said, "I will restore, sayeth
[1:57:14] the Lord." And he provided a way through
[1:57:16] the blood to bring life that would
[1:57:18] restore us back to our original
[1:57:20] condition. So where are we facing now?
[1:57:22] We're facing back to Eden.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Husband and wife, bride and bridegroom.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Word coming to word.
[1:57:34] Amen.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Then you say, why did Adam do it?
[1:57:37] Because he was he was absolutely
[1:57:40] portraying what Jesus Christ would
[1:57:42] accomplish at the cross.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Why did Jesus Christ come through a
[1:57:46] woman? Why did Jesus Christ have to bear
[1:57:49] our sin? Because it came, the fall came
[1:57:52] through a woman, but he couldn't come.
[1:57:53] He had to come the way it should have
[1:57:55] come originally through a spoken word.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's how it came
[1:58:02] originally. That's what God came to
[1:58:04] restore.
[1:58:05] So, he came not born of a woman
[1:58:08] sexually. Had nothing to do with Joseph.
[1:58:10] Had nothing to do with Mary. It was he
[1:58:12] was a spoken word creation. That's why
[1:58:15] his blood can redeem us and has. [music]
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; So what did Adam do in the prefigure? He
[1:58:23] stood. He took [music] her place.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me?
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; He knew what would happen, but he was
[1:58:31] showing redemption.
[1:58:33] He was showing it. Maybe not even
[1:58:34] knowing what he's doing. But what did he
[1:58:36] do? He took Eve's sin
[1:58:39] because if she if he didn't, God would
[1:58:42] have destroyed her and he stood and took
[1:58:45] her place.
[1:58:47] Think of [music] that. And just think
[1:58:49] what Jesus Christ did for you. He had to
[1:58:52] come through, not sexually, but he had
[1:58:54] to come through a woman. Ah, you know, I
[1:58:57] don't believe that ser. The Bible said
[1:58:59] the serpent had a seed.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; But where is he today? He's on his
[1:59:04] belly.
[1:59:06] Every bone in his body doesn't there's
[1:59:08] nothing it even resembles. Science
[1:59:10] cannot find that missing link.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; They would like to but they can't find
[1:59:13] it because he was able to cohabitate
[1:59:17] with the woman. His seed would mix but
[1:59:19] he wasn't human. He was a beast.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; And he was beautiful and he could talk
[1:59:25] and Satan could speak through him.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; He couldn't come. Satan couldn't come
[1:59:29] and anoint Adam, but he could come and
[1:59:30] anoint an animal.
[1:59:34] Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; That beast. And he did. He spoke right
[1:59:38] to Eve. Well, didn't God say, "Yes, God
[1:59:43] has said we'll not touch the tree unless
[1:59:45] we die." He said, "Oh, but surely you
[1:59:47] won't die." Because God knows. He's
[1:59:49] trying to hide something from you. He
[1:59:51] knows if when you receive that, you're
[1:59:53] going to know you're going to be like
[1:59:54] God. They already were gods. Little
[1:59:56] gods.
[1:59:58] They came right directly from God. He
[2:00:01] did. Adam, can you All right. So, what
[2:00:03] did Adam do? He showed the very thing
[2:00:06] that Christ would do [music] 4,000 years
[2:00:08] later at Calvary.
[2:00:10] And by that, we're able and are redeemed
[2:00:14] by [music] this precious blood. God
[2:00:16] bless you.
[2:00:18] Amen.
[2:00:20] Amen.
[2:00:22] I haven't even got to what the [music]
[2:00:24] re real gift is, and yet I've been
[2:00:26] speaking all around it.
[2:00:28] Amen. But I'll get to it again. I don't
[2:00:31] know about Wednesday, but [music] Lord
[2:00:33] willing, by Lord willing, I'll preach it
[2:00:36] next Sunday. I have something on my
[2:00:38] heart for Wednesday, but we'll see how
[2:00:40] the Lord leads. Do you love him?
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What are you playing?
[2:00:46] Original life. Are you okay? Well,
[2:00:48] that's a good song. One of my favorites.
[2:00:51] Okay. Do you believe in the original
[2:00:53] life?
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; What is it? Original seed. What's in
[2:00:58] that seed? eternal [music] life.
[2:01:01] Amen. It's the original life. It's the
[2:01:03] original word.
[2:01:06] God's attributes were
[2:01:08] [music and singing] manifested to his
[2:01:11] bride in this.
[2:01:14] Caught the [singing and music]
[2:01:15] revelation by the last prophet's
[2:01:18] message. And we know who we are and what
[2:01:24] we are [music and singing] raised up
[2:01:25] for. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:29] for the original life. [singing]
[2:01:32] The original life,
[2:01:35] the original seed,
[2:01:39] the original word that is the seed is
[2:01:42] what I [music] believe. Jesus Christ
[2:01:47] is revealed. Seven is [music] himself
[2:01:51] unveiled. The original life,
[2:01:55] the original [music]
[2:01:56] seed.
[2:01:58] We are the word made flesh today. This
[2:02:02] is what the scriptures say. And we're
[2:02:06] are [music] seen within, [singing]
[2:02:08] redeemed, perfect without sin. Yes, we
[2:02:12] are [singing and music]
[2:02:14] anointed
[2:02:16] and inspired by our God
[2:02:21] whose original life, [singing]
[2:02:24] the original life,
[2:02:27] the original seed,
[2:02:30] the [music] original word
[2:02:34] is what I believe. That's what the bride
[2:02:37] believes
[2:02:38] is revealed, unveiled.
[2:02:41] Himself, the secret original life,
[2:02:46] the original seed.
[2:02:50] Our eyes of yours, mine has opened up at
[2:02:55] last, and sweet victory is ours. who
[2:03:00] were chained down in the past. But true
[2:03:04] jubilee has sounded and we have you
[2:03:08] individually are God
[2:03:12] whose original life,
[2:03:15] the original life, [music]
[2:03:18] the original seed,
[2:03:22] the original word.
[2:03:24] Yes, that [music] is what I believe.
[2:03:28] Well, the son of man himself is
[2:03:31] unveiled. The seventh seal is unveiled.
[2:03:35] The original life,
[2:03:38] the original seed.
[2:03:41] We are called to placing
[2:03:44] full authority [singing]
[2:03:46] and power. Sleeping saint will wake and
[2:03:50] join us very soon. [music] Translation
[2:03:52] in the we're in the hour. Gentile days
[2:03:55] will soon [singing] be over.
[2:03:58] Glory hallelujah to our God.
[2:04:03] Who's the original life? [music]
[2:04:06] Well, the original life,
[2:04:10] the original seed,
[2:04:13] the original word
[2:04:16] is what I believe.
[2:04:20] The son of man is revealed.
[2:04:23] Seventh seal is unveiled. The original
[2:04:27] life,
[2:04:29] the original seed. [music]
[2:04:32] See, the original seed was God's mind.
[2:04:35] His thought that you were existing in,
[2:04:38] that you were a part of himself [music]
[2:04:41] was expressed
[2:04:43] and it was made manifest in the fullness
[2:04:45] of Jesus Christ. [music] For what
[2:04:47] purpose? To take our place. Just what
[2:04:50] Adam did. To be crucified, [music]
[2:04:52] to take death on himself for us and you
[2:04:54] and I. Amen. All right.
[2:04:57] You remember last two weeks ago [music]
[2:05:00] or I think Sunday before last, brother
[2:05:03] Paul took a message and said, "If thou
[2:05:06] can't believe, [music]
[2:05:09] Amen.
[2:05:10] that son would be healed." And the man
[2:05:13] [music] said, "Oh God, help my unbelief.
[2:05:15] I do believe."
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. It's the same
[2:05:20] thing when it [music] comes to
[2:05:21] salvation. If thou can't believe,
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; you are saved. Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. It applies to
[2:05:30] both. It's a double covenant. It's a
[2:05:32] double cure. Not only [music] for
[2:05:34] sickness
[2:05:35] and health,
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; but for salvation of your soul. It's a
[2:05:40] do a double cure.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; All you have to do if [music] thou can't
[2:05:44] believe.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You see, it's unveiled.
[2:05:48] Brother, sister, the book, the lid's
[2:05:50] been taken off. The seal been removed.
[2:05:53] Christ is [music] risen. And we're
[2:05:54] realizing a bride realizing when he
[2:05:56] raised, I raised with him. It's
[2:05:58] finished. I've already raised.
[2:06:02] [music] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:06:04] Amen. You pray for one another.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Pray for each other. Pray for me. I'll
[2:06:11] pray for you. Have been praying. I will
[2:06:13] pray. We have needs. God knows those
[2:06:15] needs. But don't you turn your eyes from
[2:06:18] the word and begin to reason and lift up
[2:06:19] that idol of yourself. [music]
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. you just completely give yourself
[2:06:23] over to that word because that cannot
[2:06:25] fail
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; and go to [music] confessing it. Don't
[2:06:28] you take what somebody else says and
[2:06:30] what the reasoning says and what this
[2:06:32] one says and this child or this one or
[2:06:34] that one. Don't you become burdened down
[2:06:36] by what they think. Don't you try to
[2:06:38] figure it out yourself. You just let go
[2:06:40] of that idol of yourself
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; and quit placing it up there as your
[2:06:43] idol and take what God said regardless
[2:06:46] of how you feel about it, regardless of
[2:06:48] what others say about it. Take his
[2:06:49] [music] word, believe his word, and
[2:06:51] start acting upon the word and quit
[2:06:53] being a hearer only, but a doer.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Brother
[2:07:00] Isaac, would you want to close up here
[2:07:02] in a couple songs? Can you get somebody
[2:07:05] to run that machine?
[2:07:09] Amen. God bless you, brother, sister.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
