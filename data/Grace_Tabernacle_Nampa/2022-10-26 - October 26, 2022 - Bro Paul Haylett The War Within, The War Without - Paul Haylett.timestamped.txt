[32:20] this world
[32:24] affords today
[32:28] same into that tonight
[32:31] amen
[32:32] how beautiful to be thinking
[32:35] of the things that God has already said
[32:37] in order for Saints
[32:39] to know that by his grace and mercy
[32:45] now sometimes
[32:47] we just come to places in our life and
[32:49] God
[32:50] says you know what I want to
[32:53] as it were I want to um
[32:56] make a point I want you to see something
[32:59] I want you to understand something and
[33:02] you know when he opens our eyes of
[33:04] understanding and I believe each one of
[33:06] us can say Amen to that when we see that
[33:09] God does something that's beyond our
[33:11] Thinking Beyond our intellect and I was
[33:15] just reading
[33:16] a few mornings ago I guess it would have
[33:20] been last week
[33:22] uh and and uh the morning there and I
[33:26] come uh into first Peter
[33:30] and uh it's just a lovely book got a
[33:33] lovely
[33:34] many many lovely things and so this
[33:38] evening I would that you would kind of
[33:40] follow with me
[33:42] that I'm taking a thought out of this
[33:44] scripture now not to do away with what
[33:47] the scripture says here but I want to
[33:49] take as it were you might say an
[33:51] expanded thought uh from that and uh so
[33:57] I want to speak to you tonight the war
[33:58] within and the war without
[34:02] in other words the war on the inside and
[34:05] the war on the outside
[34:07] and if we just stand for the reading of
[34:10] the word tonight that was a beautiful
[34:12] beautiful song service appreciated that
[34:15] amen
[34:17] uh
[34:19] we just turned to First Peter the second
[34:21] chapter and the 11th verse
[34:24] and we're going to take a thought from
[34:27] that and uh like I said want to take
[34:29] this in kind of a expanded uh uh format
[34:33] as it were to be able to uh just draw a
[34:38] thought out of that first Peter the
[34:40] second chapter verses 11 and 12.
[34:44] dearly beloved I beseech you as
[34:47] strangers and pilgrims
[34:50] abstain from fleshly loss
[34:55] so talking in a Physical Realm
[34:58] now
[35:01] choose our words carefully here
[35:04] fleshly lust does not always
[35:08] mean as it were to the opposite
[35:12] if you understand what I'm saying
[35:15] it's the same in when you study it
[35:17] deeper to the context of coveting
[35:20] envying
[35:21] these kind of things but yet it does we
[35:24] don't want to skip over where it where
[35:27] it is at abstain from fleshly Lofts and
[35:30] this is a thought that struck me so
[35:32] solidly the other morning which war
[35:35] against the soul
[35:38] having your conversation honest among
[35:40] the Gentiles that whereas they speak
[35:43] against you as evildoers
[35:46] now you're going to see that more and
[35:48] more saints that you are going to be
[35:49] considered the evil doer and those of
[35:52] the perverse nature right we're good is
[35:56] evil and evil is good
[35:59] they speak of you against you as evil
[36:01] doers
[36:02] they may by your good works which they
[36:05] Shall Behold glorify God in the day
[36:08] of visitation
[36:10] Heavenly Father we just ask you to come
[36:12] tonight help me Lord
[36:14] father just to express this correctly
[36:16] give us guidance give us Direction be
[36:19] with each and every one who is not here
[36:20] tonight father for the prayer request
[36:23] Lord we think of our sisters Lord with
[36:26] cancer Lord we just ask you to touch
[36:29] each one of them Father Lord we love you
[36:32] we appreciate you we thank you tonight
[36:34] for your grace and your mercy in the
[36:37] name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[36:39] seated
[36:42] so as we look at this it struck me as I
[36:44] was reading it that it is there that
[36:47] it's telling us if you abstain from this
[36:50] then these things war against the soul
[36:53] and those words war against the soul
[36:56] struck me and I thought you know uh so
[36:59] much uh of the time my brother and
[37:01] sister uh we want to to look at things
[37:04] and uh we take things into you might say
[37:08] the personal realm or or the flesh realm
[37:11] and and if we're not careful the word of
[37:14] God the prophet talks about it a lot
[37:16] says that we should be as Sons and
[37:18] Daughters of God moved up into Heavenly
[37:21] places in other words you've got to move
[37:24] out of the place that uh your flesh is
[37:26] controlling your life and it doesn't
[37:28] necessarily mean that your flesh is
[37:30] doing evil but I believe all of us could
[37:33] could relate to a time that maybe
[37:35] something happens and it feels as though
[37:38] there is like a depression or something
[37:40] presses upon you you and it can be hard
[37:43] or difficult to break through that and
[37:46] so it's there in that realm that we want
[37:48] to realize that uh it is that uh this is
[37:53] a Warfare can we say Amen to that is
[37:55] definitely a Warfare this is not just we
[37:58] are coasting through a life trying by
[38:01] some intellectual or actions or checking
[38:03] the right box but truly it is a Warfare
[38:06] and so it is my brother and sister uh we
[38:11] recognize what the Warfare is about it
[38:14] is not that Satan cares really about the
[38:18] flesh now the flesh becomes the obvious
[38:21] key as it were of what Satan's influence
[38:24] is we we cannot be living in overcoming
[38:27] life and the flesh be under control to
[38:31] uh other Spirits so the the real gist of
[38:35] what I'm starting this evening is is
[38:37] this war is against the soul it is not
[38:41] my brother and sister a war against this
[38:43] flesh but it is a war against the soul
[38:46] and when we can catch that as a key a
[38:49] real key my brother and sister will
[38:51] realize what Satan is doing and what is
[38:54] happening around us in Ephesians the
[38:57] sixth chapter we could just look at that
[38:59] real quick the tenth verse he says
[39:02] finally my brethren be strong in the
[39:04] Lord
[39:05] now see he's not telling us to be strong
[39:07] in some kind of physical fitness or some
[39:10] kind of that all of those things are
[39:12] good in the right measure in the right
[39:14] place it is not for us to be strong
[39:16] economically it's not for us to be
[39:19] strong in personality but it is to be
[39:22] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[39:25] His might to put on the whole armor of
[39:28] God that you might be able to stand
[39:30] against The Wiles of the devil and while
[39:33] I don't want to get personal tonight I
[39:34] believe I could lift my hand for every
[39:36] one of us and say we have experienced
[39:39] The Wiles of the devil he is a very very
[39:43] clever I don't take that back I don't
[39:45] know why forgive me but when I think of
[39:48] the word Wiles I think as a comic that
[39:50] was very popular when I was a kid of
[39:52] Wiley the Coyote and so you know he was
[39:55] always there trying to outsmart the
[39:57] Roadrunner now look at how all the
[40:00] clevers if you're familiar with that
[40:02] cartoon all the clever things he tried
[40:05] my brother and sister and sometimes it
[40:08] seemed for certain it would work but the
[40:10] way the gist or the nature of that comic
[40:13] was that it just continually failed and
[40:16] I reason I bring that up is because that
[40:19] is what's happening in the day that
[40:20] we're doing Satan coming and he's Wily
[40:23] he's clever he's studying and he's
[40:26] setting the Trap but by God's grace amen
[40:29] the presence of God in our life we don't
[40:33] show up for the Trap amen God stops us
[40:36] God turns us God brings us another
[40:39] Avenue and so Satan constantly Desiring
[40:44] to overcome my brother and sister you
[40:47] realize when you see someone under the
[40:49] In the Flesh under the effects of Satan
[40:52] you are not looking at Satan's goal was
[40:57] he didn't say I'm going to go out and
[40:58] control their flesh
[41:00] he said if I have their soul
[41:03] and I conquer their spirit I have their
[41:07] flesh
[41:08] so he doesn't fight for the flesh he's
[41:11] fighting on a much greater scale and
[41:13] sometimes we stop and say oh Lord you
[41:16] know I I just feel this and I feel that
[41:19] but look at this my brother and sister
[41:21] they have put on the whole armor of God
[41:23] that you may be able to stand against
[41:25] The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle
[41:28] not amen we're all familiar with this
[41:31] scripture we wrestle not against flesh
[41:34] and blood so we often times kind of see
[41:37] adversaries might say coming against us
[41:40] and we say Okay Lord we're not fighting
[41:42] against flesh and blood it's against
[41:44] principalities and powers of Darkness
[41:46] but my brother and sister we got to take
[41:49] this tonight if you would just give me
[41:51] liberty that we are not wrestling
[41:53] against ourself
[41:55] and Satan is not wrestling against you
[41:58] for your flesh
[42:01] but it's much deeper
[42:04] it's against principalities against
[42:06] Powers against rulers of Darkness of
[42:09] this world now to be a ruler in the
[42:11] darkness of this world my brother and
[42:13] sister and they will acknowledge it in
[42:15] the world today a politician to be
[42:17] successful has sold his soul to someone
[42:21] it is simply impossible to rise to the
[42:24] highest echelons of power without having
[42:27] made promises and Promises must be paid
[42:31] and so there's always an agenda
[42:35] and the devil's always got an agenda no
[42:37] matter how beautiful it looks in the
[42:39] beginning there's an agenda
[42:42] and spiritual wickedness in high places
[42:45] wherefore taken to you the whole armor
[42:47] of God that you may be able to withstand
[42:49] in the evil day and having done all to
[42:53] stand
[42:58] don't be buffeted don't be blown around
[43:01] by everything that happens
[43:03] see this is not against flesh and blood
[43:05] my brother and sister even though it
[43:07] feels like it sometimes doesn't it just
[43:09] feels like it's just a frontal assault
[43:11] against our our body against our being
[43:14] but look how sneaky Satan is the very
[43:18] thing that he really wants
[43:21] he pushes into the background
[43:26] Satan never comes face to face to
[43:28] humanity
[43:30] whether it introduces a child or a
[43:32] teenager to their first cigarette or
[43:34] their first drink
[43:37] to the evils we won't even go into that
[43:40] portion tonight but the evils that is
[43:42] present in the world today
[43:46] he doesn't say when I introduce you to
[43:48] this
[43:50] you'll give me your soul in exchange he
[43:52] doesn't say that he says they're trying
[43:55] to keep you
[43:57] from what you rightly deserve
[43:59] this is your body isn't that familiar in
[44:03] the world we live in today this is your
[44:05] body you can do what you want with it
[44:07] and so what happens is is Satan never
[44:11] comes and tells them what he's really
[44:13] wanting but he puts that in the
[44:15] background
[44:17] now my brother and sister it's there and
[44:19] he tries to keep and put the focus as
[44:22] much as he can on the Flesh and we live
[44:25] now if I'm speaking to you tonight I am
[44:28] speaking to you just because I'm
[44:30] speaking to myself
[44:32] and so it's there that we we oftentimes
[44:36] find ourselves
[44:38] putting way too much focus on the flesh
[44:41] I want
[44:42] I need
[44:48] Satan puts focus on the flesh
[44:51] and to satisfy a certain ingredient or
[44:55] element that God placed in US
[44:57] he also puts focus on religion
[45:01] now when I put it that way he's not
[45:03] making Focus
[45:05] on you receiving the Holy Ghost he's not
[45:08] making focus on you finding a one-on-one
[45:11] relationship with him it is a focus on
[45:14] religion
[45:16] and religion inherently is a covering so
[45:19] as long as you feel covered then all is
[45:23] well
[45:25] and so as he puts his Focus as much as
[45:28] he can on the flesh my brother and
[45:30] sister it's in that place that we if
[45:33] we're not careful and not led by the
[45:35] spirit of God we will find ourselves
[45:38] living according to the Flesh and now
[45:41] this isn't even just the whole thing of
[45:45] the wickedness out here and I just hope
[45:47] this little analogy or example would
[45:50] would register with you they tell you
[45:53] through research
[45:56] that the first couple bites that you
[45:58] might take of something that would be
[46:00] sweet or let's just uh everybody likes
[46:03] chocolate well most everybody likes
[46:06] chocolate
[46:07] but you realize the first couple bites
[46:10] of chocolate that you take is the
[46:12] highest sensory value
[46:16] you will have
[46:18] the rest you partake in is because of
[46:22] the sensory value
[46:25] that touched you
[46:28] and you could eat a pound of chocolate
[46:30] and it won't taste one drop better than
[46:32] the first bite because that peaked your
[46:35] sensory
[46:37] now I share that because this is what
[46:40] Satan's doing in the world someone does
[46:43] something it Peaks their sensory value
[46:46] to that right there and it's not that
[46:49] they would go away and say this is as
[46:51] good as it gets they are constantly
[46:53] trying to come back to that point or
[46:57] exceed that point that's what causes
[46:59] people to take more and more and more
[47:01] drugs is because they're trying to reach
[47:04] that sensory value that they re received
[47:07] the first time and so even in the cares
[47:11] of life and the pleasures of life what
[47:14] Satan's doing is he's not focusing you
[47:17] don't see Satan saying hey you need to
[47:20] be concerned about your soul today Satan
[47:23] says why don't you be concerned about
[47:25] your flesh why don't you see if the
[47:28] pleasure of the day cannot reach this
[47:30] pleasure cannot reach this pleasure I
[47:34] know as a young man that I have to admit
[47:37] I kind of became an adrenaline junkie
[47:39] and that's what drives you as you're
[47:41] looking for the next Big Thrill you're
[47:43] looking for the next and whatever you
[47:45] might do that is of that nature you just
[47:48] gotta you gotta try and get back to that
[47:50] point and my brother and sister in that
[47:53] realm that is just trying to satisfy the
[47:56] flesh
[47:57] there is nothing of Eternal value there
[47:59] there is nothing that will carry you uh
[48:03] through the dark or hard times of your
[48:05] life and so puts this focus on the Flesh
[48:08] and he puts it as it would be to give us
[48:10] some degree of comfort on religion so it
[48:15] it comes as such of anointing
[48:17] that uh even my brother and sister Satan
[48:21] has been so clever
[48:24] I've dealt with
[48:26] I won't say I'll say a lot but it's not
[48:29] like we're talking dozens and dozens
[48:32] but I've dealt with plenty of people
[48:35] finally when you get down to the root of
[48:37] it
[48:38] they're angry
[48:40] with God
[48:46] I just watched a little clip
[48:51] the natural disaster that took place
[48:55] I don't know that it was actually in the
[48:56] country of Indonesia but over in that
[48:58] area
[49:00] horrific tragedy
[49:04] and the reporters interviewing someone
[49:06] and this young woman says if God would
[49:09] allow this
[49:11] I'll never acknowledge Him
[49:13] again
[49:16] how clever Satan is
[49:19] the scripture says these things happen
[49:21] to the righteous
[49:23] and the unrighteous
[49:25] but Satan's so clever to come in to call
[49:28] someone to say this caused death this
[49:31] caused destruction this affected my
[49:34] family this affected my life and God
[49:36] allowed that I'll never acknowledge Him
[49:38] ever again you see what has happened is
[49:41] they've come into a time of trouble
[49:44] 's in their life and they give the
[49:47] credit as it were to an Angry God
[49:50] that's how Satan has confused them and
[49:53] how he has so directed this that they
[49:56] they come and say God must be angry and
[49:58] I wouldn't serve an Angry God therefore
[50:01] I won't serve God at all I won't even
[50:03] speak his name my brother and sister
[50:05] sometimes these troubles of Life As I
[50:08] said taking this out of Ecclesiastes
[50:11] these troubles come to the righteous and
[50:14] the unrighteous to the rich and to the
[50:16] poor
[50:17] until the wise and the unwise
[50:21] they happen
[50:24] otherwise if I would say this our
[50:26] brother Mike oldtake being struck by
[50:28] someone driving out of control God must
[50:30] have been angry at him
[50:33] no
[50:34] God says I have a plan and I will prove
[50:36] that I am God and when that life is in
[50:39] you Desiring then you don't look at that
[50:42] and say why didn't God keep me from this
[50:44] we look at this and say Lord what is it
[50:47] you are doing I want to be a part of
[50:50] that if I have to give my life my
[50:52] brother and sister imagine Shadrach
[50:54] Meshach and Abednego walking up the ramp
[50:57] as it were being escorted pushed into
[50:59] their them poor as I've spoke before I
[51:02] feel sorry for them poor soldiers that
[51:04] had to give their life for an angry king
[51:09] but Shamrock Meshach and Bendigo didn't
[51:11] say oh my you know what brother this is
[51:13] malfunctioned
[51:15] we're being thrown into fiery furnace
[51:17] maybe we should have re we reconsidered
[51:20] we could have secretly serve God we
[51:22] could have bowed and then repented
[51:25] but there was something in them that
[51:27] says you know what I am not backing up I
[51:30] know who I am and I know what my God has
[51:33] told me and he said that I'm not
[51:35] supposed to bend my knee to any other
[51:38] God and I'm telling you my brother and
[51:40] sister we don't need a big statue
[51:43] somewhere to say another God there's
[51:45] Gods everywhere in this world right here
[51:48] God's of prosperity and a pleasure and
[51:51] of knowledge and all of this and there's
[51:53] many bowing their knee to those Gods but
[51:56] I want to be a Shadrach Meshach and
[51:58] Abednego the prophet of God said God
[52:01] knew what he was doing and he waited
[52:04] till they had been thrown in the furnace
[52:07] and he met them there
[52:11] couldn't he have done something
[52:12] different
[52:15] couldn't he have just changed the heart
[52:17] of the king
[52:19] couldn't he
[52:21] of course he could
[52:24] but he chose to let you and I go through
[52:26] some hard trials
[52:29] or fiery furnace
[52:34] and then he chooses to remind us it's
[52:36] not about our flesh
[52:40] that's not what the Bible is about it's
[52:41] not our flesh
[52:46] you know people look at this and
[52:49] seems unlike in the last while
[52:51] uh I I have dealt with people talk to
[52:55] people tried to encourage people along
[52:57] these lines and people you know they
[53:00] want to know why God hasn't fixed their
[53:02] relationships
[53:04] they wonder why God doesn't come and do
[53:07] something about their health and I don't
[53:09] mean to throw Brothers under the bus but
[53:11] I just remember one time a minister I'll
[53:14] just leave it at that you know he said
[53:16] you people that think you can take Pepsi
[53:18] and chips and pray over it and it'll be
[53:20] good for you
[53:24] foreign
[53:25] yeah
[53:29] I'm not real fond of green things
[53:34] but there comes a point in your life you
[53:35] start realizing that God created those
[53:38] for a purpose and there wasn't to be
[53:40] decorations
[53:44] and people look at this and they say why
[53:46] is my health as it is
[53:50] some people look at success or lack of
[53:54] they say why are they doing good and I'm
[53:57] struggling
[53:59] why are things like they are
[54:02] or see people who suddenly become
[54:04] prosperous and that destroy their
[54:06] families
[54:12] find people with that kind of success
[54:14] and they never acknowledge that God was
[54:16] behind it
[54:18] was always about themselves I I
[54:23] some are successful and call it luck
[54:26] some call it personal
[54:29] but all of that is designed to draw
[54:32] attention from one thing
[54:34] and that is the soul
[54:38] it demeans the value of a personal
[54:41] relationship of Jesus with Jesus Christ
[54:44] and puts it on external
[54:47] we have a whole religious thing
[54:49] happening in the world has been for
[54:50] quite a few years you know name it and
[54:53] claim it and you're a greater Christian
[54:55] the greater wealth that you have uh the
[54:59] more money that pours in I I have
[55:01] watched many testimonials
[55:04] one that I'm reminded of
[55:06] of this couple that you know went to
[55:08] these meetings went to a deal and and uh
[55:11] it became Revelation to them and and
[55:13] their prayers morning noon and night
[55:16] their prayers were for Success so they
[55:19] could do something for God
[55:21] and then success came
[55:24] giant house in Palm Springs
[55:27] big pool in the backyard exotic cars
[55:31] expensive clothes and jewelry
[55:34] and ultimately did Led them down the
[55:37] road that their children fell apart and
[55:39] they ended up in divorce
[55:41] is that God
[55:44] you see what happened Satan got them to
[55:47] turn their focus remember they started
[55:50] if you'll bless us Lord we'll do
[55:53] something for the kingdom
[55:55] Satan brought them to go over into the
[55:57] realm of the flesh
[55:59] now imagine that same couple
[56:02] if they had been true to their prayers
[56:04] to God
[56:06] and as the money flowed in
[56:08] they had given it to the right things
[56:11] and done I believe just like I believe
[56:13] in the Rich Young Ruler I believe God
[56:15] would have continued to prosper them and
[56:17] their family would have been intact and
[56:20] they would have been strong spiritual
[56:23] fortresses as it were but you see Satan
[56:27] has a way of getting the focus to turn
[56:31] to the flesh
[56:34] who doesn't want to live in a nicer
[56:37] house
[56:38] drive a nicer car wear nicer clothes it
[56:41] is just a matter of humanity
[56:47] but who would also like
[56:49] the temple not made with hands
[56:53] to be presentable
[56:56] to be clean and made ready
[57:00] for the greatest gift and the greatest
[57:02] guest there could ever be
[57:06] that is to look inward into the soul and
[57:09] not outward to the flesh but Satan come
[57:12] on let's be real Saint Satan anoints us
[57:14] we go shopping
[57:16] oh there's a better barbecue
[57:19] Milwaukee just came out with a better
[57:20] tool
[57:30] you don't walk into Home Depot or Lowe's
[57:32] or any of these places and walk out
[57:34] saying I need to read my Bible more
[57:39] you walk out with the plans in your hand
[57:41] for a bigger deck and a better this and
[57:43] a better that
[57:45] because Satan so cleverly has got us to
[57:48] stop
[57:49] looking at the soul
[57:51] and saying oh I want I desire this is it
[57:57] I must have that
[57:59] oh if I I say this a little bit in Jess
[58:02] but I say this in seriousness also if
[58:05] sometimes we had a great desire to
[58:07] possess more of God as we did to own
[58:11] more Milwaukee Tools I'm guilty I was
[58:13] just in there the other day I'm like Oh
[58:14] my look how nice these are oh
[58:18] if I just had this one I could do this
[58:20] and that but what they don't sell is
[58:21] five gallon buckets full of
[58:24] enthusiasm
[58:27] so you can own all the tools and never
[58:29] use them
[58:30] I hope you'll take that both ways we can
[58:32] have everything
[58:34] but if we never use it but Satan
[58:37] focusing towards these things and and so
[58:40] we look and and uh is designed to draw
[58:43] us away from actually stopping and
[58:46] taking time now Saints if you're with me
[58:48] that's fine you don't have to say Amen
[58:49] tonight or not I I just kind of was a
[58:52] little troubled struggled a little bit
[58:54] on presenting this because it almost
[58:56] sounds kind of pointed but I certainly
[58:58] don't mean it that way but my brother
[59:00] and sister we need to take the time to
[59:03] stop
[59:04] and just say Lord let me take this
[59:07] moment
[59:08] don't let the phone ring don't let the
[59:11] door be knocked upon the doorbell let me
[59:14] just take this time and just focus on my
[59:18] soul lord where am I
[59:21] what is happening in my life and what is
[59:24] my focus at this moment
[59:28] but Saints I don't know about you it
[59:30] seems around our house
[59:32] you get down to pray or you get down
[59:34] reading your Bible and your phone will
[59:36] ring someone will knock on the door the
[59:40] dogs bark at a sparrow and distract you
[59:44] see Satan's there
[59:46] because he doesn't want you to look in
[59:48] the soul realm he wants you to keep it
[59:50] at the flesh level
[59:54] read the Bible and see all the blessings
[59:56] that are in the Bible
[1:00:00] we tend to jump over the corrections
[1:00:05] somebody say Amen
[1:00:10] we jump over the corrections because
[1:00:12] it's hard
[1:00:14] for the flesh to come face to face with
[1:00:17] itself
[1:00:20] just it is when we get old
[1:00:24] it's hard to come face to face with your
[1:00:26] mortality
[1:00:30] um
[1:00:31] now let's look here
[1:00:33] at this rate I'm going to have you all
[1:00:35] crying out of something I don't know
[1:00:36] tonight
[1:00:39] and now how Satan tries to pervert this
[1:00:41] satisfying of the Soul
[1:00:45] that thirst for the soul
[1:00:48] do you know what I'm talking about what
[1:00:49] brother Brown's talking about
[1:00:51] first that's what brought us where we
[1:00:54] are tonight was that thirst
[1:00:56] it was an intellectual my brother and
[1:00:58] sister oh the message can be into
[1:01:00] electoralized very well
[1:01:03] but that is not what brought us here it
[1:01:05] was a thirsty
[1:01:07] it's what draws one out of a whole
[1:01:10] family
[1:01:12] why wouldn't we all just remain I've sat
[1:01:14] there with a brother and he explained to
[1:01:17] me how his family has just struggled so
[1:01:19] hard with him their relationship with
[1:01:21] him and I said why are they struggling
[1:01:23] brother and he said because when I
[1:01:25] witnessed the message to them they look
[1:01:27] at him and say of our whole family why
[1:01:30] you
[1:01:32] and he said I would sit down later by
[1:01:34] myself and say yeah Lord
[1:01:37] of my whole family
[1:01:39] why me
[1:01:42] but then God takes us in the realm and
[1:01:44] there's a thirst there
[1:01:46] is something that needs something and it
[1:01:49] has to be found
[1:01:52] he tries to give you everything to
[1:01:54] satisfy it
[1:01:56] he is so deceitful in these days of
[1:01:59] perversion
[1:02:00] this is a perverted world my brother and
[1:02:03] sister of this 1965.
[1:02:06] if it was a perverted World in 1965 what
[1:02:10] would you call it today
[1:02:14] and the insanity isn't all outside the
[1:02:17] walls
[1:02:19] people come right in
[1:02:22] I want my little boy I wanted a girl
[1:02:25] so I'm just going to turn my little boy
[1:02:28] into a girl
[1:02:31] and then they proceed to destroy lives
[1:02:34] because of perversion
[1:02:37] it's a perverted race it's a perverted
[1:02:40] people everything is perverted and has
[1:02:42] perverted so gradual
[1:02:46] think about this
[1:02:48] you know it's interesting
[1:02:51] when I was a little kid
[1:02:54] we lived
[1:02:55] oh I don't know exactly what it is I'm
[1:02:57] going to say three four miles Beyond
[1:03:00] Wilder and to the South is where my dad
[1:03:03] had a dairy
[1:03:06] and we as kids got such a novel idea
[1:03:09] we're going to ride our bicycles to
[1:03:11] Caldwell
[1:03:14] you know what our parents well they said
[1:03:15] you can do it go ahead
[1:03:18] you know what their warning to us was
[1:03:21] there was no warning about don't talk to
[1:03:23] strangers
[1:03:24] don't do this don't do that
[1:03:26] don't get run over on the highway
[1:03:31] but now
[1:03:33] you wouldn't hardly dare
[1:03:35] to put your children out there
[1:03:38] if you expected to see them again
[1:03:41] it's changed that much
[1:03:44] it's perverted so gradual until it's
[1:03:47] become the most deceitful age any human
[1:03:50] being ever lived in it's more deceitful
[1:03:52] than it ever was and so we see what this
[1:03:56] is and Satan says you know what I'm
[1:03:58] going to give you everything I can give
[1:04:00] you to satisfy the thirst
[1:04:06] you know it's a interesting story of a
[1:04:08] brother that I I don't know the brother
[1:04:10] but I know very much about him I know
[1:04:13] people very close to this brother
[1:04:15] backslid as a Young Man
[1:04:18] went out in the world married a young
[1:04:21] lady had a start of a family was wildly
[1:04:24] successful in business
[1:04:26] literally making millions
[1:04:28] of dollars a year had everything every
[1:04:31] kind of boat every kind of travel
[1:04:32] trailer every kind of vehicle Monster
[1:04:34] House
[1:04:36] and at 40 odd years old about 45 years
[1:04:39] old found himself
[1:04:42] increasingly
[1:04:44] unsatisfied with his life and because he
[1:04:47] was a very Savvy businessman he started
[1:04:50] looking around and saying you know what
[1:04:51] I've got a good family I've got money
[1:04:53] I've got all these things I have plenty
[1:04:55] of time why am I not satisfied and
[1:04:58] actually come to a place one day he got
[1:05:01] down as it were first time in years and
[1:05:03] said God what is this that's wrong with
[1:05:06] me
[1:05:09] and from that moment it was over
[1:05:12] and he realized I left God all those
[1:05:15] years ago
[1:05:17] and The Thirst
[1:05:20] has come back
[1:05:26] the story you might say has a great
[1:05:28] ending but it has a terrible ending
[1:05:32] he had family that were still
[1:05:34] in church and
[1:05:36] he started interacting with them and
[1:05:39] they started encouraging him
[1:05:41] he even went to a few meetings and stuff
[1:05:43] like that everything is okay because
[1:05:46] they're still going to the lake they're
[1:05:47] still taking their vacations to Europe
[1:05:49] they're still doing everything that they
[1:05:51] do but one day when he tells his wife
[1:05:55] I'm going to go back and I'm going to
[1:05:56] serve God within a week she filed
[1:05:59] divorce papers
[1:06:01] and found a good lawyer that cleaned him
[1:06:03] very thoroughly
[1:06:05] and then his question was Lord why
[1:06:08] would I be in my mid-40s
[1:06:12] sleeping on my own brother's couch
[1:06:17] we'll get to the answer in just a minute
[1:06:22] see there's
[1:06:23] you might call it a fight as it is
[1:06:25] because that's what happens in Warfare
[1:06:27] right there has to be a fighter it's not
[1:06:28] a war if you walk out and just run up
[1:06:31] the White Flag that's not war
[1:06:34] and Truce is my brother and sister are
[1:06:36] not the end
[1:06:38] or the cessation of warfare that is
[1:06:41] merely a delay of an ultimate uh uh
[1:06:45] settlement that must take place so you
[1:06:48] can come and say we're going to have a
[1:06:49] truce that's not the end of it too many
[1:06:51] people have a truce with the Devil
[1:06:54] they're waving a flag saying hey how
[1:06:56] about you don't bother me I won't bother
[1:06:58] you but my brother and sister this
[1:07:00] Warfare that takes place and tells Satan
[1:07:04] has the soul he will lie cheat steal and
[1:07:08] use every subterfuge he can to try to
[1:07:11] conquer that
[1:07:13] it's Warfare
[1:07:15] Can someone say that with me it's
[1:07:18] Warfare
[1:07:19] this is not a game we're in Saints we're
[1:07:22] not just going to church it's Warfare
[1:07:27] and it was all designed to draw
[1:07:29] attention away from the soul so here we
[1:07:32] have a battle going on
[1:07:36] to satisfy the soul
[1:07:40] you can satisfy
[1:07:44] I heard a brother put it this way
[1:07:49] he said the most unhappy
[1:07:52] person on Earth he used brother but I'm
[1:07:55] changing it to person
[1:07:57] on Earth
[1:07:58] is a backslidden believer
[1:08:02] most miserable person on Earth
[1:08:07] they don't want to be around anybody
[1:08:09] they don't want to talk to anybody they
[1:08:11] don't want no part of these things they
[1:08:13] go and they occupy their time here and
[1:08:16] occupy their time there but the truth of
[1:08:18] it is is they're not wanting to deal
[1:08:20] with the Warfare
[1:08:22] the scripture warns us about being weary
[1:08:25] and well doing I would ask tonight that
[1:08:27] you would give me the privilege to
[1:08:29] change that and not become weary in
[1:08:32] Warfare
[1:08:33] not sit down on the battlefield just
[1:08:36] because the battle has went for so long
[1:08:40] his mercies are fresh are new every
[1:08:44] single morning and so if we are there
[1:08:47] entering in then we will have the
[1:08:49] strength for the Battle of that day
[1:08:56] so as we look at this
[1:08:59] you say what was the answer for this
[1:09:02] this I call him young man now
[1:09:06] what was the answer for this young man
[1:09:08] that the Lord spoke to him when he said
[1:09:10] Lord how is it after literally being
[1:09:12] worth millions of dollars having this
[1:09:15] business and it's all collapsed around
[1:09:16] me what is it Lord and the Lord spoke to
[1:09:19] him and said one soul
[1:09:22] is worth ten thousand worlds
[1:09:25] and he realized the value he had placed
[1:09:28] was on the things of the flesh
[1:09:32] and God was giving him a wake-up call
[1:09:34] and saying the value I place on you has
[1:09:38] nothing to do with your flesh and
[1:09:41] fleshly things it has all to do with
[1:09:45] your soul
[1:09:47] and while his life was not good dealing
[1:09:49] with things of visitation and all this
[1:09:51] kind of things he found a piece in his
[1:09:54] life because he realized that God had
[1:09:56] just done him the greatest service that
[1:09:59] could be done and that would be to
[1:10:01] redeem this soul and bring it back and
[1:10:03] show the value of the Soul
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:08] the prophet of God speaks of it many
[1:10:10] times a soul being worth ten thousand
[1:10:12] worlds you notice if you go study this
[1:10:14] and I've looked through just I don't
[1:10:16] know if I would say hundreds but maybe
[1:10:18] it was hundreds of of quotes related to
[1:10:21] this of comments related to this you'll
[1:10:24] find there's never a mention of the
[1:10:26] value of the Flesh in that equation
[1:10:29] never says your Soul's worth ten
[1:10:31] thousand world but your flesh is worth
[1:10:34] this and I tell you I say that in that
[1:10:36] context but the prophet of God did talk
[1:10:38] about the value of the Flesh and at that
[1:10:41] time I forget now what it was here I'm
[1:10:43] just getting all excited but you know
[1:10:45] what it is current I just looked it up
[1:10:46] today in case you want to know and it's
[1:10:49] currently under inflation you have about
[1:10:51] one dollars worth of elements in your
[1:10:54] body
[1:10:55] now if you don't mind your body being
[1:10:58] dismembered and your kidneys sold here
[1:11:00] and this Soul there and whatever else
[1:11:02] you might be worth a few hundred
[1:11:04] thousand
[1:11:08] okay
[1:11:11] it's kind of disgusting when you look
[1:11:13] study that part
[1:11:15] yeah
[1:11:18] healthy kidney in China could be worth
[1:11:20] as much as 245 thousand dollars
[1:11:25] oh
[1:11:26] very racist
[1:11:29] if you're white
[1:11:33] a Chinese kidney is
[1:11:35] worth considerably less
[1:11:38] I'm not sure why and I'm not going to
[1:11:40] find out why
[1:11:44] but look at this
[1:11:49] spoke you know the quotes you know the
[1:11:51] story as it were that we'll put 500
[1:11:53] suits
[1:11:55] and I think it was 89 cents worth of
[1:11:57] elements
[1:11:58] inflation's got us to a dollar maybe a
[1:12:01] dollar and a half
[1:12:04] and we look at that
[1:12:07] what is it God's telling you look I'm
[1:12:10] sorry
[1:12:11] your soul on this side the scale worth
[1:12:13] ten thousand worlds your flesh on this
[1:12:17] side worth nothing
[1:12:21] and yet the devil causes us to Pander
[1:12:25] to the flesh
[1:12:27] over and over again
[1:12:31] now if this comes out a little hard just
[1:12:33] say ouch okay
[1:12:35] that'll be as good as an amen tonight
[1:12:37] just say ouch
[1:12:38] but you see my brother and sister God's
[1:12:40] wanting us to see that we are too
[1:12:43] focused he said you know what the
[1:12:45] prophet of God says what we need to do
[1:12:47] is get behind the veil which is to get
[1:12:51] Beyond the Veil of this flesh yet behind
[1:12:54] the veil into the Shekinah Glory and
[1:12:57] rise up into Heavenly places
[1:13:01] nothing about if your flesh wants to
[1:13:07] but I won't make it a direct quote
[1:13:08] tonight
[1:13:10] but the prophet of God lays the
[1:13:12] foundation that it would be more on the
[1:13:14] order of if you will allow yourself to
[1:13:24] I Die daily
[1:13:28] was the Apostle Paul's words
[1:13:34] could we
[1:13:36] hold to that
[1:13:39] could we take the Apostle Paul's words
[1:13:42] and say let them be my words
[1:13:45] prophet of God the Apostle Paul's
[1:13:48] teaching so tightly
[1:13:50] to the bride of Christ
[1:13:53] that I'm preaching Paul's message to you
[1:13:56] and they said oh that's good enough
[1:13:58] that's close enough no they said we're
[1:14:00] counting on that we're holding to that
[1:14:03] why
[1:14:05] because he knew that was a standard that
[1:14:07] God had placed that was you know as we
[1:14:09] use the term that was the gold standard
[1:14:13] are we going to hold the gold standard
[1:14:14] tonight
[1:14:16] Lord let me die daily
[1:14:18] let me die daily don't let my flesh rule
[1:14:23] you see the problem people have when
[1:14:25] they get caught under that anointing is
[1:14:27] they believe if they die daily that they
[1:14:29] won't enjoy their life
[1:14:31] but I'm telling you my brother and
[1:14:32] sister there's nothing like the Liberty
[1:14:34] that's found in Jesus Christ that's when
[1:14:37] you really start to enjoy life
[1:14:39] amen why because as we read the
[1:14:43] scriptures in our opening
[1:14:45] when we are caught up
[1:14:48] in that lust of the flesh
[1:14:51] there's a war
[1:14:53] taking place in US
[1:14:57] come on y'all quiet tonight
[1:15:00] my wallet's in the back office I got a
[1:15:02] 50 bill in there maybe I need to offer
[1:15:04] that for an amen
[1:15:06] but I know it's the truth because we're
[1:15:08] not much different all of us
[1:15:11] amen when we do and say and act upon
[1:15:15] things that we know have grieved the
[1:15:17] Holy Spirit it puts such a damper on us
[1:15:21] and such a Warfare in us that we will
[1:15:24] not be able to say oh brother I'm in
[1:15:27] Heavenly places it would be more like
[1:15:29] Lord help me but I feel like I'm plowing
[1:15:32] the gutter
[1:15:34] because we were never designed to be in
[1:15:37] that place let me say that again you as
[1:15:40] the bride of Christ were never designed
[1:15:42] to be in that place
[1:15:44] God designed you for Heavenly places
[1:15:47] that means that we cannot let Satan
[1:15:50] bring us to the place that our flesh is
[1:15:53] controlling our life we were designed to
[1:15:56] come to the place that if our flesh has
[1:15:58] not rulers hip over us we stop and say
[1:16:01] Lord forgive me and we say to our our
[1:16:05] spouses or our children or our parents
[1:16:07] forgive me because there's the Liberty
[1:16:10] from the Warfare
[1:16:13] we weren't designed to be under a
[1:16:15] Warfare condemnation is a Warfare
[1:16:22] conviction brings peace condemnation
[1:16:24] brings more distress
[1:16:29] now in Matthew 16 are we all right
[1:16:33] in Matthew 16 24 then said Jesus and to
[1:16:37] his disciples If any man will come after
[1:16:40] me
[1:16:41] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:16:43] cross and follow me
[1:16:45] for whosoever will save his life
[1:16:48] shall lose it
[1:16:51] now let's take this when he's talking
[1:16:52] about Savings in his life he's actually
[1:16:55] my brother and sister it's not out of
[1:16:57] context to say whosoever will decide to
[1:17:00] Forfeit the kingdom for their flesh
[1:17:05] is going to lose their flesh anyhow
[1:17:09] right because we just have a season
[1:17:14] don't want to sound morbid but
[1:17:17] kids when you're 12
[1:17:19] 13 14 15 20.
[1:17:22] 80 sounds old
[1:17:28] when you start knocking on the doorstep
[1:17:30] of 80 as it were you know you see the
[1:17:33] Mast of it just over the horizon
[1:17:36] don't seem very old at all
[1:17:41] do everything
[1:17:43] to preserve it
[1:17:45] you know some of them ex-hollywood
[1:17:47] people
[1:17:49] you know oh so and so she's had six face
[1:17:52] to live
[1:17:55] that won't do one thing for her
[1:17:59] she's preserving trying to preserve the
[1:18:01] flesh
[1:18:03] but we stand on the principles because
[1:18:05] he says you know what for whosoever will
[1:18:07] save his life
[1:18:09] will lose it and whosoever will lose his
[1:18:12] life for my sake see there's the
[1:18:14] quantifier not just losing it for
[1:18:16] something I went to the jungles and I
[1:18:18] went here and I went there and I helped
[1:18:20] the poor
[1:18:22] no you got to lose it for him
[1:18:26] shall find it
[1:18:28] for what is a man prophet of he shall
[1:18:30] gain the whole world right
[1:18:33] everything the flesh wants
[1:18:39] but come to a place that will lose his
[1:18:42] own soul
[1:18:44] see this is putting it right here in the
[1:18:45] balance before us Saints
[1:18:48] putting it very very balanced for us
[1:18:52] and what shall a man give in exchange
[1:18:53] for his soul
[1:18:55] well none of us will I don't believe
[1:18:58] ever how billionaire
[1:19:00] in front of our name
[1:19:02] but I can assure you
[1:19:04] that when God called the Rich Young
[1:19:06] Ruler
[1:19:08] he would have gladly gave him
[1:19:11] everything
[1:19:17] but he'd been given the opportunity
[1:19:22] he went to the market as it were and was
[1:19:24] given an opportunity Trade It
[1:19:27] trade it and follow me
[1:19:30] now I believe most of you would still
[1:19:33] recognize this I don't say this as
[1:19:34] Doctrine but I just believe in principle
[1:19:36] that it's true that the Rich Young Ruler
[1:19:39] would have said okay Lord I will sell
[1:19:42] everything I've got
[1:19:43] and I will give it to the poor and I
[1:19:45] will follow you
[1:19:46] see God puts in US gifts
[1:19:49] and it's just a personal thought okay
[1:19:51] nobody make Doctrine out of this don't
[1:19:53] take it but I want you to see what it is
[1:19:55] that what God's placed in you in ability
[1:19:59] that God doesn't just take that back
[1:20:01] when you serve him
[1:20:03] if you're good at math you get saved
[1:20:05] your memory doesn't you know you don't
[1:20:07] know how to do math now because you're
[1:20:09] saved
[1:20:10] no
[1:20:12] imagine the Rich Young Ruler
[1:20:15] saying I'll do that Lauren
[1:20:17] calls up his investment banker
[1:20:20] and says yeah the XYZ Company sell it
[1:20:24] and the guy's like okay what's going on
[1:20:26] just sell it
[1:20:31] well my
[1:20:32] sold for twice as much as we thought it
[1:20:34] would sell for
[1:20:37] then his investment bankroll call him
[1:20:39] the next morning and say did you know
[1:20:40] the stock in such and such tripled last
[1:20:43] night
[1:20:44] the whole time he's out Lazarus would
[1:20:47] have never been laying on the curb in
[1:20:49] sight of his mansion
[1:20:51] he would have said build a hospital and
[1:20:53] help this man
[1:20:57] and his investment banker would have
[1:20:59] called him up said you're never going to
[1:21:00] believe this
[1:21:02] but that old Barren ground you bought
[1:21:04] years ago on a whim outside the city is
[1:21:08] worth a hundred million dollars
[1:21:11] here more money
[1:21:14] because that was a gift God gave you
[1:21:17] now my brother and sister I hope you can
[1:21:19] make sense of this
[1:21:21] the gift that God has given us that
[1:21:23] matters
[1:21:26] I don't mean to be personal but some of
[1:21:28] you can do computer stuff and you can do
[1:21:31] it well
[1:21:32] in your company acknowledges you do that
[1:21:35] well
[1:21:36] and some of us we wouldn't have a clue
[1:21:39] but there's other things we do well
[1:21:42] there's things that we do and people
[1:21:44] would come and pardon me it touches
[1:21:46] those in the church here touches even
[1:21:48] myself and some people say they just
[1:21:50] drive a truck
[1:21:52] good you go drive that truck
[1:21:55] yeah see if you can even get it out of
[1:21:57] the parking lot
[1:22:00] but you know the gift that God has given
[1:22:02] us that we do well
[1:22:04] as we hear the word
[1:22:07] we hear the word of God
[1:22:09] it isn't a foreign sound to us it's real
[1:22:13] and it's alive and it makes a difference
[1:22:15] and the other part of that gift is when
[1:22:18] we have heard the word we're able to
[1:22:20] take that word and if you just bear with
[1:22:22] me digest that word and put it into
[1:22:25] action
[1:22:26] because it's not just hearing the word
[1:22:28] we must be doers of the word also my
[1:22:32] brother and sister what separates the
[1:22:33] bride from the rest of the world because
[1:22:35] we hear the word we receive the word and
[1:22:38] we act on the word and the word is
[1:22:40] changing us
[1:22:42] amen that is a gift from God
[1:22:47] oh otherwise we would teach the world
[1:22:50] we would teach the world how to do that
[1:22:53] but you can't
[1:22:55] amen
[1:23:00] see never in the scripture where you
[1:23:02] find Value placed upon them
[1:23:04] flesh
[1:23:07] you see the battle on the outside is
[1:23:09] real
[1:23:10] come on Saints there's some of you ought
[1:23:12] to be saying that's the truth the batter
[1:23:13] on the battle on the outside is the
[1:23:16] truth
[1:23:18] we can't diminish that
[1:23:25] and it seems to be the greatest battle
[1:23:29] prophet of God
[1:23:31] preached greatest battle ever fought
[1:23:34] we'd say okay it has to be the mind
[1:23:37] but you realize my brother and sister
[1:23:39] that these two still
[1:23:41] don't have any value
[1:23:47] the battle in the mind
[1:23:51] nowhere in the Scripture it says what
[1:23:53] would you give
[1:23:54] for your mind
[1:23:59] but these are the Avenues that Satan
[1:24:01] assaults us from
[1:24:02] but they're still avenues that are
[1:24:04] connected as it were in the flesh
[1:24:10] Hallelujah
[1:24:12] well
[1:24:14] won't we just argue on where the
[1:24:17] greatest battle takes place
[1:24:20] say only what the prophet said you're
[1:24:22] off the word
[1:24:23] well okay I'm not going to argue with
[1:24:25] you but I'm telling you I know people
[1:24:28] that can quote the Bible to you forwards
[1:24:30] and backwards they can quote the message
[1:24:33] to you forward and backwards
[1:24:35] and they have no battle
[1:24:37] in the mind
[1:24:41] and you know why
[1:24:43] because they can quote it
[1:24:46] no sir
[1:24:48] because it's settled
[1:24:50] in the soul
[1:24:53] you say they never have a battle oh oh
[1:24:56] they have a battle
[1:24:58] you know how the battle starts you can
[1:25:00] go study history and look back on this
[1:25:02] it's Town starts by the blowing of a
[1:25:06] horn
[1:25:07] or a trumpet
[1:25:09] and the waving of the penance
[1:25:13] now who's the devil going to fight for
[1:25:14] when he looks out and he blew the horn
[1:25:17] and he waved the pennant and he looks
[1:25:19] and all he sees is the blood of Jesus
[1:25:21] Christ
[1:25:22] where's the battle
[1:25:25] did the prophet of God not say that
[1:25:27] Brother David just quoted I don't know I
[1:25:29] think brother Chris quoted it here
[1:25:31] recently I know I quoted it here
[1:25:32] recently my brother and sister you know
[1:25:34] you get under the blood
[1:25:36] amen and if the Devil Comes under the
[1:25:39] blood with you he'd be your brother
[1:25:42] that's how powerful the blood is there's
[1:25:45] the answer to our Warfare is because we
[1:25:48] stand my brother and sister and decide
[1:25:50] we're going to settle this with the
[1:25:52] devil on our own and then we wonder why
[1:25:54] we get beat up like the seven sons of
[1:25:56] Siva
[1:25:57] amen then we're like oh why this happens
[1:26:00] and then we Face another battle because
[1:26:02] if our heart condemns us not then we
[1:26:04] have confidence so Satan's working the
[1:26:07] avenue to bring condemnation into our
[1:26:09] life so that when we come to church we
[1:26:11] can't worship because we got some other
[1:26:14] thoughts on our mind that we're saying
[1:26:16] oh Lord forgive me we're sending in
[1:26:18] church you know like a brother told me
[1:26:19] one time he says brother Paul I got so
[1:26:21] many things I need to set right with the
[1:26:23] Lord I said didn't said it right he said
[1:26:25] well I don't know the scripture says
[1:26:27] that if you take communion unworthily
[1:26:29] that you are guilty of the body and the
[1:26:31] blood of Jesus Christ and he said
[1:26:33] there's been so many times in my life I
[1:26:36] repented of things walking up the aisle
[1:26:38] to take communion
[1:26:44] were you sincere brother
[1:26:46] oh you better believe I was sincere
[1:26:49] so it would have been better if you had
[1:26:51] found a priest to make that repentance
[1:26:55] would have been better if you had done
[1:26:56] it two weeks ago
[1:26:59] is it not sufficient
[1:27:02] to have a harsh desire to take communion
[1:27:08] I think I broke his little little prison
[1:27:12] wide open
[1:27:14] I said Do You Realize as you were
[1:27:16] walking up to take communion
[1:27:19] the ghost said I will not allow you
[1:27:22] to take it unworthily
[1:27:25] and as he's walking up the aisle his
[1:27:27] heart
[1:27:28] is heavy Lord I said this Lord I've done
[1:27:31] this Lord forgive me
[1:27:35] he thought he was just saving face
[1:27:38] to continue to take
[1:27:40] go forward and take communion
[1:27:44] but does the scripture ask us not
[1:27:46] whether we have to confess again and
[1:27:49] again
[1:27:50] to be forgiven of our sin
[1:27:54] is one sincere repentance sufficient
[1:27:58] I ask you tonight is one sincere
[1:28:01] repentance sufficient
[1:28:05] then who's talking to him
[1:28:09] who's talking to him
[1:28:11] as a war counting the mind as part of
[1:28:14] the body part of the flesh it is the
[1:28:16] flesh that is talking to him but the
[1:28:18] Holy Spirit dealt with that brother so
[1:28:21] that he would not come and take
[1:28:23] communion unworthy and he was there just
[1:28:25] shocked breaking down in tears it's like
[1:28:27] you mean God cared enough to not even
[1:28:30] let me make it up there before I said
[1:28:33] Lord please forgive me I said brother
[1:28:35] God loves you that much
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:41] but the flesh said
[1:28:49] my oh my
[1:28:51] have I confused you yet
[1:28:55] not even an answer
[1:28:57] oh my
[1:29:00] god well
[1:29:01] so the word what does it do it tells us
[1:29:03] put on the whole armor of God to guard
[1:29:05] ourselves
[1:29:07] let's not let the devil make this about
[1:29:09] our flesh Saints
[1:29:11] let's come to a place where recognizing
[1:29:13] who we are in Jesus Christ
[1:29:16] and when we recognize who we are and
[1:29:19] that we have the ability to step behind
[1:29:21] the veil into the very presence of Jesus
[1:29:24] Christ then my brother and sister let's
[1:29:26] not let Satan make this about your flesh
[1:29:29] let's not not let him now I'm going to
[1:29:32] ask y'all a personal question and most
[1:29:33] of you won't raise your hand some of you
[1:29:35] won't even blink but have any of you
[1:29:37] ever been offended
[1:29:40] let's see let me just look at your faces
[1:29:42] I hear no response I can just look at
[1:29:44] faces yep yep I can see it I know I
[1:29:47] offended brother Trevor him and I went
[1:29:50] out in the alley and fought amongst the
[1:29:51] trash cans and we got it all settled
[1:29:54] praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:29:57] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:29:59] why did we get offended
[1:30:01] well they were rude
[1:30:03] what would have happened if you'd have
[1:30:05] poured Grace and blood all over them
[1:30:08] well it might have changed them no it
[1:30:10] would have changed you by the ACT
[1:30:13] they would have changed you by the very
[1:30:15] Act of pouring the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:30:17] over them prayer amen and putting Grace
[1:30:20] on them so what do we do we get our
[1:30:22] feelings hurt we get emotions
[1:30:24] now look emotions can be my brother and
[1:30:27] sister a sensation
[1:30:29] I've told you all before about it and
[1:30:31] I'll just give you a very brief as a
[1:30:33] young child my mother's seeking seeking
[1:30:35] things of God wanting more of the Lord
[1:30:37] and going to a meeting I can drive you
[1:30:39] right to the the church building today
[1:30:42] tonight where it took place and my mom
[1:30:44] on the platform with a whole bunch of
[1:30:46] other people predominantly women and as
[1:30:49] the preacher come along and did almost
[1:30:51] like a Benny Hinn thing and if you don't
[1:30:53] know what that is you can Google it and
[1:30:55] a Benny Hinn thing and these people are
[1:30:57] falling down and I remember as a kid
[1:30:58] just being in awe to watch someone fall
[1:31:01] over and their head bounce off the floor
[1:31:03] that's not playing
[1:31:08] the man comes to my mother nothing
[1:31:10] happens my mom's like Lord please Lord
[1:31:13] please Lord please
[1:31:15] and a man does him grabs her forehead
[1:31:20] just looks at her goes on very next
[1:31:22] person bam very next person bam there
[1:31:26] were several in that group that were
[1:31:28] friends with my mother
[1:31:32] I rode home with my mother that night
[1:31:34] that memory is burnt
[1:31:36] in my mind
[1:31:38] I think my mom ran a stop sign drove
[1:31:41] down the center line everything just
[1:31:42] crying out to God
[1:31:44] why why
[1:31:48] why
[1:31:50] I tell you why
[1:31:52] all of her friends
[1:31:54] in a few short years
[1:31:57] had earrings plastered in their ears I'm
[1:31:59] not judging don't you misunderstand me
[1:32:01] hair is short is mine
[1:32:04] living any old way oh life was slain in
[1:32:06] the spirit
[1:32:09] oh my brother and sister
[1:32:12] God's leading his dear children alone
[1:32:16] God is protecting us God's not wanting
[1:32:18] to call a truce with the Devil the
[1:32:21] scripture says we would walk out on the
[1:32:23] ashes of the wicked
[1:32:24] we're not going to build a habitation
[1:32:26] next to them
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:30] I'm not coming across too harsh am I I
[1:32:32] don't I don't mean it harsh
[1:32:35] see
[1:32:36] we're not going to let Satan bring
[1:32:38] offenses
[1:32:40] it's not gonna
[1:32:43] the Lord's not going to let us fall
[1:32:45] under false anointed brother Chris and I
[1:32:46] was talking about the other day I hope I
[1:32:48] don't steal his Thunder but my brother
[1:32:50] and sister false anointed ones at the
[1:32:52] end time listen to it read it
[1:32:55] it's actually a startling sermon when
[1:32:57] you think about the very fact that
[1:32:59] people can be so anointed and it not be
[1:33:01] an anointing on the soul
[1:33:04] it's on the flesh
[1:33:06] and so we don't want to be those people
[1:33:08] my brother and sister not being
[1:33:09] judgmental but we don't want to be those
[1:33:11] people that are just anointed on the
[1:33:14] flesh I wanted to make it down into the
[1:33:17] soul and if I have to pay a greater
[1:33:19] price a greater consecration then I say
[1:33:22] Lord let it come and let me pay that
[1:33:24] price
[1:33:25] because it won't do one bit of good to
[1:33:28] have it on our flesh all the days of our
[1:33:30] life and hear those words depart from me
[1:33:33] we want it to be the real thing my
[1:33:35] brother and sister we don't need envies
[1:33:37] and we don't need Strife coming in we
[1:33:39] need a a good holy ghost moving amen so
[1:33:43] let's not make it about the things
[1:33:45] related to flesh so well I felt about
[1:33:48] this I had people tell me before now if
[1:33:51] this applies to you please forgive me
[1:33:52] but I've had people tell me I I just I
[1:33:56] just that that didn't feel right
[1:34:00] it's a word
[1:34:02] it's a word don't tell me how you felt
[1:34:05] about it it was the word it wasn't me it
[1:34:09] wasn't the other preacher it was the
[1:34:11] word I don't care how you felt about it
[1:34:14] it was the word
[1:34:16] instead of saying Lord correct me Here I
[1:34:19] Am Lord correct me they wanted to
[1:34:21] correct the word
[1:34:24] now I'm telling you my brother and
[1:34:25] sister it'll never go anywhere
[1:34:27] they'll never go any deeper than their
[1:34:30] feelings if they let their feelings make
[1:34:32] those decisions
[1:34:35] now let's go here into this another
[1:34:37] quote out of the sermon thirst a little
[1:34:40] farther down
[1:34:41] greater should be the thirst of any soul
[1:34:44] for the Waters of life
[1:34:46] than to say you belong to a church
[1:34:49] The Thirst of the Soul can't be
[1:34:51] satisfied the real true thirst it can be
[1:34:54] perverted
[1:34:55] you can think you're all right when you
[1:34:57] join church but that isn't it that won't
[1:35:00] satisfy the genuine holy thirst for God
[1:35:03] it just simply won't do it it's just not
[1:35:06] there now David said in Psalms 42 7 here
[1:35:09] when the deep calleth into the deep at
[1:35:12] the noise of thy water spout the souls
[1:35:15] call
[1:35:16] does anyone ever experienced that
[1:35:18] yeah
[1:35:19] yeah come on we got a better response in
[1:35:21] this church than that don't we hey man
[1:35:24] we wouldn't be here tonight if it wasn't
[1:35:26] something deep within us crying you
[1:35:28] wouldn't let me be beating up on you
[1:35:33] there wasn't something deeper than just
[1:35:35] going to church
[1:35:36] otherwise we would just have church
[1:35:38] services that talked about how important
[1:35:40] we are and how good God is and all the
[1:35:43] blessings he's going to pour out and
[1:35:45] everybody's going to walk out saying
[1:35:46] that's good that's good and live lives
[1:35:48] that won't match the word
[1:35:50] I'd rather take the risk
[1:35:52] I believe oh my which one of those
[1:35:56] I can't think of which one of those
[1:35:58] preachers it was
[1:36:00] I think it was
[1:36:05] it doesn't matter you're right Jerry
[1:36:13] he said we got a choice you can be
[1:36:15] offended At Me Now
[1:36:17] or offended at me then
[1:36:21] take your choice
[1:36:25] yeah
[1:36:26] my
[1:36:27] I'm not looking to offend you
[1:36:30] the Soul's call
[1:36:32] look I've often used this in
[1:36:34] illustration if there's a fin on the
[1:36:35] fish's back it had to be put there for
[1:36:37] him to swim with he has need for that
[1:36:40] now what if he'd say I'm going to be a
[1:36:42] different fish I'm going to be a smart
[1:36:45] educated fish ah huh I'll just I'm going
[1:36:48] to believe some real theology I believe
[1:36:50] I don't have to have that fin he
[1:36:52] wouldn't get very far in the water would
[1:36:54] he and that's exactly right amen and
[1:36:58] what if a tree said now I know there had
[1:37:01] to be an earth first for me to grow in
[1:37:03] that's right I'm supposed to grow in the
[1:37:05] Earth but I'm going to be a different
[1:37:07] tree I want them to just set me out here
[1:37:10] in the middle of the street so I can be
[1:37:13] noticed see he wouldn't live very long
[1:37:16] see that's right when a deep calleth to
[1:37:19] the deep it takes more than joining a
[1:37:22] church it takes more than shaking hands
[1:37:24] with the preacher it takes more than
[1:37:26] living a good straight life it takes
[1:37:29] something to satisfy the inside of you
[1:37:32] that pours down from God right not Pours
[1:37:35] Down from church not Pours Down from
[1:37:37] here or from there it pours down from
[1:37:39] God
[1:37:40] amen two people too many people keep
[1:37:42] looking back to the church oh we have
[1:37:44] just had a conversation here the other
[1:37:46] day we have just the most dynamic
[1:37:50] pastor
[1:37:58] felt like saying you have scripture for
[1:38:00] that
[1:38:04] and when thou in laodicea
[1:38:07] have a dynamic pastor
[1:38:09] Thou shalt overcome all things
[1:38:15] no sir
[1:38:17] no sir
[1:38:20] dynamic
[1:38:23] is interpreted
[1:38:25] as
[1:38:26] our pastor has more personality
[1:38:30] than your pastor
[1:38:36] come on
[1:38:37] you never hear the word dynamic and dull
[1:38:41] in the same description
[1:38:45] you see what's happened
[1:38:47] you want to check it out spend the time
[1:38:48] go back what the prophet of God said
[1:38:50] they'll be looking for that really smart
[1:38:52] good-looking curly-haired guy that can
[1:38:55] hold their attention
[1:38:58] that's dynamic
[1:39:06] had a brother tell me one time he says
[1:39:07] well brother Paul he said nobody sits on
[1:39:10] the front row in our church
[1:39:11] I was like well praise God we have some
[1:39:14] he goes oh no it's not that they don't
[1:39:16] want to he says I just get so excited
[1:39:18] sweat flying everywhere and spitting now
[1:39:20] just nobody wants to sit there anymore
[1:39:22] because they have to take a shower
[1:39:24] and I thought well my goodness this
[1:39:26] brother he's not a get up there
[1:39:31] oh man
[1:39:36] I've heard a calf
[1:39:39] with a twisted gut sound like that
[1:39:42] I know that's a little rough
[1:39:46] we don't have Twisted God
[1:39:48] we're not calves
[1:39:50] we're Sons and Daughters of God there's
[1:39:52] something that's alive in us
[1:39:56] there's something alive in us my brother
[1:39:58] and sister something Dynamic when the
[1:40:01] word strikes us that we are like that's
[1:40:04] the truth did we have to process it in
[1:40:06] the brain I can guarantee every one of
[1:40:08] you when you've heard the word at times
[1:40:10] it was so real to you before you gave it
[1:40:12] thought you said amen yes because it
[1:40:16] struck in the soul not in the mind to be
[1:40:19] processed run across your neurons
[1:40:21] digested put in place restructured and
[1:40:24] determined that'll be good enough no sir
[1:40:26] there was something in the soul and it
[1:40:28] was a soul that responded not the flesh
[1:40:31] oh my brother and sister God help us
[1:40:35] amen
[1:40:37] oh Hallelujah
[1:40:39] see the tree
[1:40:42] doesn't want to live in the middle of
[1:40:43] the street
[1:40:44] a tree wants to be planted by rivers of
[1:40:48] Living Water
[1:40:49] that's where the real desire amen what
[1:40:53] is it wouldn't live very long that's
[1:40:55] right when the Deep calleth to the deep
[1:40:57] it takes more than joining the church
[1:40:59] the shaking of hands living a good
[1:41:02] straight life
[1:41:03] it takes something to satisfy the inside
[1:41:06] of you
[1:41:07] Pours Down I want to just make emphasis
[1:41:10] as you say you already read that brother
[1:41:11] Paul I want you to make it it takes
[1:41:14] something that poured down from God
[1:41:18] to satisfy this soul
[1:41:20] the Deep falling to the Deep at the
[1:41:22] noise of that water spout amen sister
[1:41:25] Ruth if you were to come
[1:41:27] Hallelujah
[1:41:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:31] amen
[1:41:37] Hallelujah
[1:41:41] don't let Satan fool your Saints
[1:41:44] amen oh we get to enjoy the things in
[1:41:47] this flesh
[1:41:49] we get to enjoy life
[1:41:52] we get to you might say sure the Thrills
[1:41:55] of what life is
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:41:59] but none of that will matter
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:03] if the soul
[1:42:05] dies of starvation
[1:42:08] if the soul
[1:42:10] is weak
[1:42:14] the soul is dehydrated from the spirit
[1:42:17] of God
[1:42:19] all of this stuff here
[1:42:22] won't matter
[1:42:25] but when the soul
[1:42:28] has stood kind of a take from the word
[1:42:30] here under the water spout or the
[1:42:34] Fountain of God
[1:42:36] and just the waters
[1:42:39] the precious word of God the spirit of
[1:42:42] God falling on that person
[1:42:44] I don't say this lightly Saints but the
[1:42:47] wheels can fall off the car
[1:42:49] and you'll stop and say thank you Lord
[1:42:51] you've got something greater for me
[1:42:53] life can be difficult and you'll say
[1:42:57] Lord
[1:42:58] if this is the path you've called for me
[1:43:01] I'll walk in
[1:43:03] not in a cloud of depression
[1:43:05] not under not under this or under that
[1:43:09] I'm going to go beyond that I'm going to
[1:43:11] quit looking at my flesh could could
[1:43:13] maybe tonight I don't know is this not
[1:43:16] to pressure you but maybe it wouldn't
[1:43:17] hurt just to lift a hand and say you
[1:43:19] know what I'm not going to walk in this
[1:43:21] flesh I'm going to walk in the spirit of
[1:43:23] God I'm going to walk in his presence
[1:43:25] and and when my times and the clouds
[1:43:28] come I'm going to be reminded that I'm a
[1:43:31] daughter of God I'm a Son of God whether
[1:43:33] the sun is shining or not whether I have
[1:43:36] a job or not or whether their sickness

[1:44:02] is hard sometimes
[1:44:05] understand that I think this a little
[1:44:07] bit why the Lord laid this on my heart
[1:44:09] because sometimes you'll just stop and
[1:44:11] say Lord
