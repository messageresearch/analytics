but the real house is sitting here amen that's his house you know it's his house where he put his name it's in his house where it's a place of worship amen it's where the sacrifice is amen is in his house his place where he put his name amen let's stand together this evening thank you brother Alex brother Isaac God bless you open your Bibles please with me to 2 Corinthians I want to title this tonight as I just uh follow the leading of the Lord here and what he'd have us to do I want to title this I am because he is I am I am because he is I am when you're in the I am then when I'm in the I am then I am amen amen so Lord help us to see this may it be an encouragement to your heart to press on because you have nothing to turn around about amen it's just go forward proceed I was looking up that word we'll come into it in a minute but to proceed something to proceed is to go forward keep going amen just keep proceeding forward you started on it keep going amen 2 Corinthians chapter 4 starting with verse six we could take a lot of this because we've we've uh let's just let's just take the 18th verse of chapter three there first but we all with open face unveiled face there's a mystery here that's been hid that is now seen known by someone because it says we all so I trust that together we can say we amen all amen with open face beholding is an a glass the glory of the Lord so whose face are you beholding and who is him who is this face you're beholding you could say as brother brandom referred to the child mama that's me cuz something the veil's been removed when it shall turn to the Lord the heart shall turn to the Lord the veil will be removed beholding as in a glass a mirror the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord verse six for God the spirit of the Lord for God who commanded he is that Spirit how many say amen for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined who has shined in our hearts to give the light God did has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face that's the person of Jesus Jesus Christ so whose face is opened what's unveiled but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels so I'm speaking again tonight as we just want to background this the real you it's been onward here for about four meetings now maybe more a lot more than that but it's just becoming so personalized huh brother Chris becoming personalized we're realizing where we come from who we are and where we're going but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of David Dean Hart nor put your name in it of us then it goes on to say but we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken C cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also whose life he is who's been unveiled in your hearts he has that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in your in our body what is the life of Jesus the spirit of God is that right it was God in him all right might be made manifest in our body by what Same Spirit for we which which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life now why are you going through these trials these struggles these Temptations these heartaches these persecutions why are we going through that because for this purpose that we which live always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh amen amen now it says verse 13 we having the same Spirit of Faith as it's written I believe therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak I want to jump down to 16 for which cause we faint not but through but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed revived day by day amen I'd like you to go to St John 15 verse 7 very familiar scriptures brother Brown took this scripture and read it and then said then he said now you see who you are and he said here if ye abide in me and my words abide in you John 15:7 you shall ask now watch he said if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then you know who you are that's right what the real you is amen you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here is my father herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples amen then continue father had loved me so I've loved you continue ye in my love now St John 14:20 have a skull field just across the other side verse 20 at that day what day when the message of the seventh angel Revelations 10 the open of the Seven Seals comes Amen in that day it's going to come to full reality full Revelation for what purpose full Revelation full faith a perfect faith for what purpose the change or the the the full realization of what we have in substance amen all right so he said so he said at that day we know that the prophet identified that scripture as this day you shall know not imagine not hope not a make believe that I am in my father ye in me and I in you he amen amen so we're going to proceed on this I am because he is I am now you may be seated I'd like you to go with me over to St John 11:25 Martha meeting Jesus at the grave of Lazarus and Jesus said in verse 23 saith unto her thy brother shall live again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day but Jesus said unto her Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life amen I am the resurrection and the life who are you you can't be the I am he's I am you can't be in him and not be the I am and if he's Resurrection is life that's who you are then fear not there is no fear hallelujah amen how can you pass away when the I am can't pass away all right so he said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me he that believeth in me when were you believing in him that before the foundation of the world you were portion of himself you were the thought of himself existing you were the substance in him that had to be expressed he thought of you he it was a thought of himself he wanted to be bride he had an attribute to be bride he had an attribute to be a husband so he had an attribute to be a bride he had attribute to be a wife that was in him that was a part of of him that was a portion of him that had to be expressed and when it was expressed it was a word it was logos and the logos had to be manifested amen amen all right so he put his thought into manifestation and so you being predestinated word for this season written in the Bible for this season becomes that word living made manifest in flesh Hallelujah because he wrote of you in here this is him you can SP to point to this scripture and say it's written of me right point to the scripture just like he did say it's written of me amen hallelujah amen so he said here he said not he said all that God I'm I'm quoting what he said all that God was he poured into Christ all Christ was or is was poured into his body the bride is poured into his body the bride that's the second fold of a three-fold manifestation of the seven seal of the mystery amen the mystery of himself that's what it is remember he said it's unfolded in a three-fold manner three-fold purpose and that secret could only be known to his bride amen so if you have and know the secret and it's opening in you who are you you're his wife all right and nothing can nothing can nothing shall be able to defeat the I am nothing can stop the I am it's Eternal it came from God it goes back to God Jesus knowing he came from God and went back to God so what about us that's the Revelation he's unfolding that's the message of the seventh angel all right so he says here the headship and the body now it's not them people he said but the headship and the body has become one unit not the not the humanness the body of Christ himself has become one unit yes it's God manifested in his people this is in Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 591 he said the headship and the body has become one unit it's God manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer Twain he's he's he's he's pointing us to a man to a manifestation and the reality of his message they're no longer Twain this at the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God and that voice of the seventh angel the trumpet you look at you look at the it's a a linear I don't know how many have that linear uh uh the Greek words of the New Testament anyway it calls it the trumpet that's amen the days of the voice of the seventh angel the trumpet sounds the mystery of God is finished amen so we we'll come into that just a little bit here so it's God manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer Twain they're one they're one all right God and his church is one then if he if we're not if but we are one then whatever he is we are and I say I am being little I am because he's the capital I am amen are you with me I have to be that and that I am is eternal and it's eternal life and it's manifested in flesh glorifying and manifesting the sun all right so he said it's they're no longer Twain they're one God and his people Christ in you God's Great Faith Revelation God's Great Revelation is Christ in you what is Christ in you then the substance of things hoped for the substance of the thing promised the evidence of Things Not Seen amen you have it already Christ in you has given it and identified that you are in him you are one okay so so we see here he said God's Great Revelation glory to God what are we doing even bearing his name bearing his name what goes with that name everything that name goes for everything that name pertains to we're bearing that name we become that name made manifest amen all right okay so he said I'm just picking this up here on being one I want you to hear this the church will come through justification through Luther sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostal brother brandham said the Pentecostals was the last great Reformation he said but we're beyond that we didn't do away with that we're beyond that because the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the new earth makes way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again what are we coming back to word who are we the word that's it what can who can defeat the word the word is impossible can't be defeated amen see so he said now the the word through these through these through the these processes amen three processes what's the the justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost constitutes what the new birth amen then what's growing himself is growing in you what is he growing what is he manifesting himself in Bride form so the message of the hour is Christ in Bride form the message of the hour is the bride coming of Christ and so we see he said and and it'll go or it'll go through baptism of holy ghost or the Pentecostals and go and then proceed right on proceed watch proceed right on into the Perfection of the son of man how is he perfected how is Adam perfected where was the capping Stone of Adam of the ministry of Adam where was it what was the capping Stone of all creation the bride she was the Caps she was the capping off of all that Adam was she was in Adam a part of Adam had to be expressed as Adam are you with me so it was a finished mystery of Adam because there's still a mystery to be unveiled that would fulfill and bring to full manifestation Adam because he was both male and female and there had to be an expression of himself in the bride form Hallelujah and he says now with that expression of himself and bride form we're ready to go back to Eden because that's the message of the hour back to we're going heading back to Eden which is his third coming how many you know that when's his third coming when he steps with his bride right back upon the Earth again in the Millennium amen the the Earth has a baptism and who steps upon it the I am who steps upon it when you receive the baptism who steps upon in your Earth and begins to develop you and it begins to change you and it begins to mature you just as the Earth will become matured who's the city dwelling there amen how's that mountain going to come to pass because that mountain that body that that Earth has got to have a change doesn't it just like you have to have a change but what's bringing you to that change the unveiling of I am in you is your change that you have as a substance in you now see there's no more fear I'm talking as an individual I speak to other IND individuals here there's no fear in perfect love and you can't have his faith without his love so let's go back here he says now so the pent and go it'll go from the Pentecostals right into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons other words person so what is I am speaks of a single person is that right the I am speaks of a of a person I mean speaks of a of it's a personal pronoun of an of a person you understand so what person is it you see you see what did he do for us at Calvary he opened his life poured out his life is that right for who to Quicken for what purpose to Quicken that seed he will was the full seed is that right but he had a wife yeah that was in him and had to be expressed that's right so she was body of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone that's what the bride is Same Spirit she doesn't have another Spirit she has the same spirit amen right manifested in flesh that's right it's right exactly right all right now so you see It'll be this same selfers God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they'll be they'll both be the same don't tell me we're not coming close to that there's a bride right at the point of maturity here today I believe that with all my heart she's maturing exactly as she as the word said she would into the very person of Christ himself manifested in flesh it's a different flesh the only difference between us and the calvary man is a different flesh man there's still a spiritual birth we weren't born we weren't born we were born this man was born by sexual birth what we're all every one of us so we were defeated to begin with he didn't come by sexual birth he but he came by a spoken word birth and so have we spiritually come through a spoken word birth which will have to be translated into a new body exactly right amen praise be to God the seed is being preached the Son of God is ripening the seed there's got to be light here there's light here you realize that when the when when there's when Dawn comes there's a space of time between Dawn and the rising of the sun there's time between time who's manifesting here who's ripening so we can get out of the way so Israel can have their message where are we at do you recognize your day in this message amen you are the one being awakened the bride's being been awakened she may be few in number but she's here she's on Earth amen maybe getting fewer and fewer but there's still Bride on Earth that will be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye amen when that last one comes in the finality of it Sheil that Resurrection will take place how many looking for that every day I'm looking for it every day I'm looking to meet those loved ones every day and we're growing from glory to glory why because we're looking in the glass realizing who we are little by little more by more we're possessing this ground that is our ground amen amen the new the new ground the new the new land praise the Lord amen so you're that seed see there one he said they're both they'll both both be the same they are one he said now do you see where where we're at he said now now we see where we're at where's the headship where's the capping off here what where is that see he said now we see Christ the true headship coming going in coming in his bride and he said now we see the Promise being fulfilled now we see the Promise being fulfilled when could he say that after the opening of those seals now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride Hallelujah this isn't this isn't known to the public this is a secret catching away but it's happening and it's happening every day and it's happening right here it's happening in this room it's happening every day in in the heart of an individual called Jesus Christ the bride amen the Virgin birth of the Bride is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever she is the Virgin born word of God you said those those cliche they are not cliches they are reality this word is not becoming just a word to us become reality it's coming off of the page manifesting in US holding us keeping us directing us leading us guiding us every moment every day amen how many see that happening despite what you do how many tests and trials you go through you're at peace while in turmoil you're you're a dual person two Natures in the same body but one is you and the other's not you but that that's not you will be quickened and made you Lord it'll be changed but where's the change taking place it's in you that's right it's in the From the Inside Out amen you've already read when Jesus rose you Rose with him because when that token comes in which is the person of himself comes in and makes himself manifest in you it shows you done you say I I hope I make it you've already done made it I'm talking about faith you've already done made it you say Well it don't look like you made it no faith tells me I've already made it so on my my my confidence is not in this my confidence is not in this man the senses you you want to look at your senses you're denying the faith you want to look at those senses that are contrary to the word when Jesus said you're healed you're healed amen I don't care there's nothing can stop that from happening as long when you believe that that's a light the water to water that seed that must be manifest Hallelujah that's exactly right all right I want to read something out of here before we go much further but just let me go a little bit further now you see where you're at okay and today he's standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost which is who God himself which is standing here in the person of the Holy Ghost amen manifesting himself hisself more and more how many would say amen amen you individually can see him manifesting himself more and more I see more and more manifesting bringing this body under obedience to his word more and more the path of the justice is a Shining Light it doesn't grow darker and darker it gets lighter and lighter amen more personalizing all the time amen see he's standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and more coming into his bride his church making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same making himself known who's revealing the son of man where's the son of man revealed today in his wife through his wife that's exactly right he'll work in and through her you want to know where he's working you want to know what the promises there will be a royal bride which is Royal seed of the royal promised son she's to come on the scene in this hour and there's a word prophesying she'll be here now we see the Promise being fulfilled amen hallelujah all right they'll go right on into perfection right on to maturity right on into the capping off what is our message today the capping of the Pentecostal message is what we're speaking above today the ministry of Christ himself impersonated among his people with the very same things he did when he was here on Earth in his body the bride the very same things that he did on Earth in his body the bride now that's what we're speaking of today what what are we seeing what are we what are we Glory what are we what are we rejoicing in the capping of the Pentecostal message not the Pentecostal denomination the Pentecostal message the new birth you grow up you can't stay in the Pentecostal babyhood you have to grow up and that's why those seals were open that's why that seventh seal has to come to manifestation which is himself revealed in Bride form praise the Lord all right so Jesus knew where he came from we have to know where we came from we come from the same Source he came from therefore we are the same word he is we're not another word we are his word that's why Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my words here's the word here's the word here's the word here's the word here's the word my word shall never come void to me they'll never respond back to be void but will accomplish what I've sent him to do that's his power that's his working that's him working in you so yield let go let go of yourself let go lean not to your own understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path trust in the Lord with all your heart quit trusting in your in your senses quit trusting in your feelings quit trusting what somebody else says about you what what does he say about you I'm telling you what he says about about you you are perfect and sinless in Christ you are perfect and sinless if you're in the sinless one who are you you're sinless hallah if you come through the blood whose life do you have because life is in the blood life comes through the blood hallelujah amen I like I like to see him manifested in trials and testings and and and and all these it's not easy on the flesh but but who are we this isn't the real you this is bringing out the character the realization of the character that is you amen amen what are all these things happening for to bring you to a perfect perfect completion that he said you already were in him to realize you are complete in him listen this little bride when you say I am because he is I am then I am can't die I am can't fail I am cannot pass away I am cannot fall I am a sealed in I am as secured I am as owned by the word himself I am is the word himself I am is the light I am is the life which is the light amen amen I am seated now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus while I'm being persecuted while I'm being tested in this earth why why I don't feel like it but I'm already seated in Heavenly places one side one side if you look at this side say I can't be seated you're looking at the wrong side because the Bible said you are now seated in Heavenly places in Christ birth you are the birth word amen you are the supernatural birth word you are a new creation and that creation is a spoken word creation you are a spoken word creation the spoken word is the Original Seed you are the Original Seed manifested you are that seed brother the Jesus said Jesus said in in John or in uh Luke 811 he said the word is the seed that the sers sold the word is the seed amen praise the Lord now turn with me to St John we've read this two or three times already but St John 15 verse 26 look at this scripture it doesn't matter brother sister I say preach it if it's preached every day until now until we see the Rapture it's got to be preached I don't care who preaches it every member of the body every fivefold Ministry they're saying the same thing how can they be in the same Spirit we're becoming more in one heart one Accord one mind the mind of God don't think of robbery being in it it let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God what are we speaking about this morning he bringing it back to that absolute Oneness again just like it was in Eden before the fall he's got to bring it back do you realize that's what's happening do you realize that's what's taking place she's maturing she's growing she's in the presence of the son amen well you say yeah well if he were in the presence then the son is here he just said it was here the Holy Spirit himself is here manifested in flesh that's the son he that hath the son he that hath the word quickened in him being the seed of God manifested in flesh is the son am Hallelujah did you get that and he that hath the son hath life and this is the record he's given to us eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's Jesus Christ the word Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ the I may the I am not I will be or I I I have been or will be I am the same yesterday and today and forever he that was which is and shall come amen what are we looking to come we're looking for the resurrection of those Believers that without us they couldn't be made perfect The Headstone has to to be manifested The Headstone has to come The Headstone is here and it's being manifested we have the message of The Headstone we have the capping off of the of the of the ages they capping off of that birth we have to come into that form we have to manifest The Headstone which is the revelation of the son of man Hallelujah you say that's a big order but it's it's too big for David but it's not too big for he that is in me he's doing it perfectly as he said he would it's all his achievement it's all his work it's all himself it's here in us working through us it's all him and when you come to that Revelation then quit your belly aching anymore by the way I have that sign quit your belly aching what do you have to fear you just don't know how I what I'm going through Brother David quit looking what you're going through and look at the word that's already gave you the promise of what you're going through and the Deliverance for it it's already yours what do I got to do take it take his word don't add your opinion to it don't add your feelings to it don't add nothing to it just take the word and say the word said so in my heart I absolutely believe it and what I believe I have now the just shall live by faith faith in what faith is in the word now let me read to you what I read here or I didn't read I quoted it because I didn't have it to read but but in the message perfect faith brother Brown said this and I'll come back to what he said earlier I mean before this a Believer are you a Believer I want you to get the depth of this quote it's more than just a surface mental idea he's saying something here to us a Believer is you want to know what a believer is the believer is the faith of God that moves in you was he the Living Word was he in action then what is the bride she he said she must and is the word living and in action amen she's the Bible bride other words she's the word for her day and season this is the season that it would be him in Bride form you want to know where he's coming people don't even see it they got it all they got all kinds of ideas about his coming right but we have the true revelation of his coming and we are the revelation of his coming amen hallelujah these aren't ideas this is the word this is the truth that's why I am is the truth I am is the way I am is the word I am is the resurrection and the life you are the resurrection and the life because you are the I am you're in him he's in you you say he's in me if that seed isn't in he can't be in you if you are not that predestinated seed there's no way for God to be in you but when you are that seed and he quickens that seed and it recognizes the seed recognizes the word for the hour for the season for the time and acts it out not not trying to make believe and pump up this and pump up that it does it automatically because if I had the spirit of Christ I would live what Christ lives if I had the spirit of bethoven I'd write music if I had the spirit of Dillinger I'd be a murderer why because I have his spirit and if you have the spirit of God how are you going to disbelieve any word of it so when the that seed is quickened down you're that seed quickened the lights come upon it the water poured upon it and it quickened that seed to life amen and you say I've always been that word the old Catholic priest said brother brand he said Mr brandom God is in his church he said brother brandom said no he said God is in his word now I hope you get a hold of that amen because what's in you that Christ in you birth in you will recogniz the word you cannot go out there and say well well I I just believe this I believe this word yeah I'm not qu disqualifying the fact that you believe it you can't be a seed and disagree with the word you can't be his seed and disagree with the word because the word is the seed and if you are that word how can you disagree with it oh the Holy Spirit can't be in you and live some other life but his word manifested in the season and the hour that is present that it's here to do because it come to your time your time your season and here you are living out that part that God said you would live out you're that portion of that word you didn't live in another time if I lived in Luther's time I would believe with all my heart justification by faith I do today if I lived in Wesley time I believe in sanctification by the blood I do today only it's opened even further to us today if I live in Pentecostal time and I had and I was in that time that was my age I would believe in the restoration of the gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but if I stay in that babyhood I'm not going to mature so there had to come a sunlight and a sun in its strength for you and I to mature into him his very being and that was kept a secret before the foundation of the world until the hour of the seventh Angel's message which is the seventh seal which is Revelations 10 and now it comes into a body you begin to eat of that word open to you you can't get enough of that and you grow into the very thing you're eating amen and you're and he's prophesying through you amen preaching through you and you become the final voice to the final age see it's not David it's not David out here this brother that brother this sister sister no it's Christ you've come from God you're returning back to him the whole thing has have been the the the mystery of redemption it's every bit of it comes right back around now we're coming right back to what what we didn't realize in the beginning we realize here at the end that's exactly what restores us and sets us totally free amen amen amen he had to manifest his attributes do you understand he has to manifest his as a savior a husband a bride a wife a Healer all these attributes of himself a deliverer he has to manifest himself as the Victor he had to manifest himself Victory and you're his victory you're his faith and you're his victory because the believer is the faith of God other words the believer is the revelation of God himself which the Revelation is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen it's living and exist amen it's not a question it's not I hope I know you shall know in this day that I'm in my father father in me and I in you and you in me I only see one God who is the I am where's my identification lay then in the I am I am because I am I am because he's I am he's I am I have to be the I am you say you're just boasting making yourself I'm not making anything of this I'm talking about the reality of who you are I'm talking about what's in the inside I'm talking about the resurrection what a what a resurrection that was there and I rose with him what about what a resurrection this is I've come out of Darkness I've come out of Leo DEA I'm walking in the light I'm in between these times right now Israel's ready to receive a message happening in Israel exploding over there and here we are growing into very maturity ready to take a Rapture a body change which is already working in US we already have it you have it as substance it's not a a question anymore I've already made it I've done made it how are you speaking Brother David I'm speaking Faith amen do we realize we have to have it in faith first it has to be the word first it has to be the revelation of the word first hold fast to the faith hold fast to the confession of faith yes amen amen amen the word is NY the word of faith is n the even in thy mouth if ye abide in me and my word in you ask what you will speak what you will and walk forward pise Lord amen and quit looking at your H yes you're weak I'm weak this is nothing but a weakling and thank God I know that now I can yield it completely to the Lord Jesus and let him do what he wants to do to glorify himself and bring honor and glory to his name which is present you realize his name is present his word is present his life is present his light is present the message of God that his own message is that he's light and you're the children of that light he said my word is a SE that is Sor sowed and he said now the disciples said tell us the the parable of the of the of the tears and the wheat he said the good seed are the children of the Kingdom that were swn in that ground and the devil come behind it and the tears are the children of the devil he said of the evil one amen and they both grow together but at the Harvest in the time of harvest he sends his angels h hallelujah amen and they gather out what how they gather what's separating here the word the word is separating the revelation of the word the True Believer is the faith of God that moves in you is the revelation of God GE David said God is my Revelation Psalm 62 God Is My Rock do we get water from the rock yes we do but what do we do we speak to the Rock not smed it by standing around worry and weeping and and poochy lip disease and wo is me and woe is me and looking at yourself all the time quit smiting The Rock speak to the rock that it may give forth its water why cry speak go forward you either believe what he said or you don't believe what he said you have a choice right now to take what your senses declare take what the doctor says and they're not wrong I'm not saying they're wrong but take what he says or take what the word said which is eternal God's word is eternal God's word can't fall God's word Can't Fail God's word will never pass away are you God's word how do we become God's word receiving what he said receiving that day in Calvary be born again and lay in the presence of this open Word and this message and grow into the maturity and revelation of he said he said you would be in myself you will be myself that it's not far off it's not hey hey Lord where are you I want you to come down here I want you to come over here come down no he's in you amen who's in you the word's in you and if the word's in you God's in you because God dwells in his word hallelujah they say well bless God God dwells in a church it sounds good it makes us feel good but how does he dwell in the church because the word seed is in the church and he's in his word hallelujah and you've United by the word and the Word was in the beginning go go back to the beginning which is God and that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me and I and you and you and me hallelujah we're here he said we're here hallelujah we're here I'm so glad to see him personifying himself right Among Us and see what he promised for the word and what's and not not what somebody's emotions singing and jumping and dancing but by his word amen he's making himself known glory to God talk about Freedom we never knew Freedom like this this is freedom wait till we get wait wait till I get beyond the down payment amen I've got the I've got the very I've got the very uh uh what do I want to say this very substance yes of this body change already God Satan can't come in and take that from you he can't even find where you're you're at he can't come to where you're dwelling that's why no no no plague shall come nigh your dwelling because your dwelling is Christ your house is Christ your temple is Christ and you are that Temple of himself amen is that right but where's your temple brother Brown said Christ is your temple so he's in you dwelling in you he's living in his house and you're dwelling in him hid away and Satan can't get to you that's all there is to it if he has to get to you he's got to come through the blood you are sealed under that blood that life of that token has identified you that before the foundation of the world you were his thinking of himself and here you are in the day you were promised to be here and fulfilling the scriptures in this hour you can't get it any planer than that amen Hallelujah my the sun would come out has it in this time between time the sun has come out it may be a dismal day out here you can't tell whether it's daylight or not but in the evening time right here I'm talking about evening between evening and darkness at DUS between there also brother Bram said but watch in the morning and he said good morning bride between that time and the time of the sunrise what's it going to rise on in the East again are you with me and this day is is the rising of the sun where is he rising in his word Brother David that's you that's the real you that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah you say you're awful excited I'm beyond excited am that's right we better be Beyond excited because if you're just excited aable in here what about in here there ought to be something bubbling in here if you're going through the hardest trial the hardest stress and persecuted and cast down and everything the Bible just we just said you know brother sister that's the Walk of the I am hello how can we expect anything else if he suffered do we expect to get get by without suffering if you're not suffering there's something wrong brother Bram said there's something wrong with the church a bride people that are not suffering why do I want to suffer no but the suffering is only to glorify him manifest him show that he's present Hallelujah God's got genuine gold they want to say gold is 2, something dollar an ounce I'll have you know it's beyond the worlds an ounce I may be an ounce of gold but I'm the same gold that's a whole gold I may be a shaving of it but I'm still that gold that gold is the I am and I'm a shaving then I am just as I am as he is that spoonful of water says the same chemical as the whole water that ocean I may be a spoonful of that ocean but I'm the ocean then I'll just remain in my place and carry out that portion that part by his power by his Revelation by his victory so I am his faith and I am his victory I am his Revelation Christ in me identifies that I am his Revelation because Christ in me brings the word that he spoken and uncovers it and reveals it to me personally there's your evidence not the emotion right I don't say there 's not emotion with it but you can have all the emotion you want and still go to hell you can have all kinds of emotion of the Holy Spirit present cast out devils and still be lost because that Spirit I'm not talking about the soul I'm talking about the middle middleman that middl man can be Anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost receive a baptism of the genuine Holy Ghost and still not be the word inside the word recognizes the word the word manifests the word the word is the word Hallelujah Glory all right I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking why I didn't preach on the Holy Ghost why I didn't do this here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you the Holy Ghost is the action in you moving the Holy Ghost is the action you it's a life not an emotion I can have all kinds of emotion out here and still be the I am on the inside I can have all kinds of frustrations all kinds of things as he judging me by that or is he judging me by what he is the word having come through the blood how can he see me any differently than himself he looks through the blood the Holy Ghost token identifies he has to look at the blood through the blood to me and he can't see me in air he can't see me he sees me faultless he sees me perfect and he said this is the message to you bride rising of the sun this is my message to you you're standing perfect glory to God Amen that's right he promised he would send you Heavenly light to ripen that word seed that was sown for this day you are that seed sown amen my it had to be spoken the only way you can be birthed is by the spoken word that little Eagle didn't know what an eagle meant he could be called an eagle he told he was an eagle but until that voice he heard that voice something resounded on the inside then he knew he was an eagle where's the evidence then see that you're an eagle amen amen all right the word is the seed that is so or sowed amen so watch it in action not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it is a person I am is a person and eternal life is a person I have eternal life then who's what person are you he said I'll build my church upon the foundation of the revelation of who I am therefore you have his name and the name of the Lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it and are safe amen there you are right there Hallelujah you hold his name you are his name you're in his name you're pregnated with life bearing his name you can't bring anything thir birth but a but a perfect Eternal child of God amen just like Sarah conceived had Faith finally built up to the faith where she could conceive and was bearing the promised son Glory just take that feed upon it that's right there it is all right now he knows he has Sons and Daughters he knows he has a bride amen amen amen he knows that okay paragraph 68 perfect faith I'm winding down here now the only thing you have to do is have faith in what you are amen now the only thing you have to do is have faith in what you are now brother bascus have faith in what you are the revelation of what you are must be here he wouldn't ask you to have faith in something wasn't here but it's been revealed he said now have faith in what you are you grow in faith you you walk in faith the path of the just is Faith is a faith walk it's the very Faith Of God it is the very Faith Of God I'll say it again it is the faith of God that's the believer your Revelation his Revelation your ministry and his ministry is the same only we're a many member he was one member he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was the word himself is that right we become the word as we receive the word but we're always the word because we were always his thought when you catch a revelation of the thought then you know where you come from then you'll know who you are are the Bible said in the beginning was the word the word was with God was with God was with God how was it with God as a substance a thought of himself that's how it was with God he was that word he was that expression and he was and it was with him and it was him then I hope you got that watch so you know where you come from then you know where you're going right and if you know where you're going then you know who you are you know where you come from you know who you are if you know where you're going you know where you come from you can put it any way you want to do it they all go right together as one person the god that's in me will be in you the god that me and me in you is the same God yes am what a revelation I am so thankful for this I don't even know how to conduct myself that's the truth it's so real as I said it's so personal it's a person I am that person I'll build my church upon the revelation of who I am and if that church just build upon a revelation of her of who he is then when she grows up who is she you have to be him all right now say Have Faith In what you are have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word that said what he was it's written of me now watch this I went back to St John 15:26 but when the comforter is come we're talking about him tonight this is our comforter when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father now watch what he says here which excuse me of from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth which proceedeth

you right now when you have God you have faith you have his faith and everything he promised is yours and he quickens it for his season and you act accordingly my father worketh and I worketh hitherto is that right my father's working at this moment and I work and I can't work until the father Works through me and I can't do anything until the father reveals it to me he had my vision we have the word and it's revealed to us we act according to that word that's the Oneness that's the relationship that's the unity we're talking about that's our day that's our hour and in him was life and the life was the light so the I am is the light and you're the light he said you were and if he said he said you are what he is where's I am today see how the word just you can't even stop it just goes right together It just fits It just fits together you're beginning to see your puzzle and it creates it's it's a face and that faces you that faces him and that faces you you with open face beholding in his glass the glory of the Lord how can you behold the glory how can you be the glory when he said he wouldn't share his glory with no one because he's not sharing it with another one he's sharing it with himself Hallelujah she is him thy light has come behold the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee upon thee is there any these here tonight blessed be the name of the Lord It's risen upon thee Hallelujah there's not another person you're not another person you're not an you are a Living Word he's the Living Word you're the Living Word you're Eternal he's Eternal you're his possession he's my possession I am him he's me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm not speaking I'm not speaking a foreign language to the bride tonight I'm not speaking I am speaking another tongue right that's exactly right brother David keep preaching buddy you were preaching another tongue but we know this that he that knows God heareth us we came from God we're here representing God and we have the voice of God and the voice of God is this message and you can't deviate and add to it quit adding your thinking to what that Prophet said he was a Vindicated Prophet quit putting your opinion on it ask God to reveal it to you Hallelujah we have Heavenly light we're walking in Heavenly light we're growing in Heavenly light and that light will Chang these mortal bodies and it's in me already working it's already working did you hear me it's already working I've already defeated death I passed from death into life I've already passed it what do I have to fear this for I'm already risen hallelujah hallelujah so proceed means go forward continue forward go forward advance and the spirit that come from the Father which proceeded from the father he shall testify of me you have a true testimony because you're a true witness and a true witness has a true testimony and I've testified to you tonight he's here the same he was yesterday and shall be forever I don't care what this flesh thinks I don't care what it feels like it's got a voice but I will not heed that voice my comfort my headship is within me I'm following my husband we are one no longer Twain this message has declared that I and the father are one I and my husband are one I hope that you in your own personal self can say the same thing well I just hope I it's quit your hoping and start believing what the word said and start feeding on the open book if you don't have any desire and pulling yourself to feed on that open book I'm sorry for you cuz you're not recognized the day and the season you're in not recognizing the message of your day you're too taken up with fleshly ideas too taken up with the things the Earth which is nothing but temporal and it's passing away and it's dying and we have life and we have it more abundantly he said I've come to give you life and give you more abundantly so start believing in who you are quit looking at what you're not don't you realize the word has separated that and Jesus had had faith in the word that he said what he was it's written of me can't you go back and say it's written of me I came from him do you realize you came from him bride amen you're the promised word for the hour you're the promise of the hour you're the message of the hour you're the open book you're the record of eternal life you're him the eye am I'll finish right here didn't David and the Psalms the prophets and all speak of him I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven amen I'm the bread of life that came from God out of Heaven amen I am that tree of life from the Garden of Eden isn't that exactly what he said the bride was the tree of life amen what is it's the tree he's you said no no no no he's the Tree of Life yeah but he's got a bride and that bride can't be something other than him so she is also the Tree of Life the bride tree the prophet said you can't make it together and you not make it perfect can't full have the full Revelation without that bride tree Revelation 10 he said the seventh he said notice at the opening of the seventh seal Seven Seals Revelations 10 which is the message of the seventh angel the full word is to be born into manifestation again I'm just capping it off what we said tonight all right and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when he was here on Earth amen isn't that what we saw isn't that what was declared to us isn't that what Vindicated a prophet that he had the word for the hour and then that word the hour went into flesh and here we are manifesting that same word who are we then we are the message we are the mystery of Revelations 107 we are the finished mystery the very Capstone of creation was she Adam revealed in Bride form that's right and who are we we're the second Adam's bride amen and here we are come back we had to go in the dirt too see ground but here we come back in full restoration amen bride and bridegroom one same person she is him and she and he is her she's the mystery of Christ revealed she was the mystery of Adam we could say a lot on that right from here but I'll just I'll stop and we're we're going here now see see this is this is the calling made they realize that this is the calling out of the Bride not a Pentecostal message I'm quoting to you what he said the Pentecostal message was restore gifts back to the church but this is the calling forth of the Bride another message another message this is e age this is Eagle time this is time between time what's it called bride time amen seed time are you with me the Corner's been turned you're that house and you dwell in him that owns it glor all right nobody else say amen I will all right all right now and he knew am I'm the Tree of Life of the Garden of Eden I'm all these things I am that I am and he knew that that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him who' he say you are Messi that's right and he knew that that with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was with him and the Word was made manifest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer and the believer is the faith of God that moves in you therefore he relied upon what God had made him amen and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as Believers what is a Believer the revelation of himself can't we rely upon that quickened word can't we rely upon that unveiled word can't we rely upon that open face that we see amen do you love him the headship in the body has become one unit it's God manifested in his people let's stand amen you're like that Lily coming up out of the pond that dark smudy Pond but brother sister let's realize something here Matthew 14:27 the last scripture I want you to read this while you're standing Matthew 14:27 26 and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea where is he today and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying oh it's a spirit you better leave it alone Brother David be careful it's it might be a spirit on you say to you I don't to say it to me but I'm saying I'm preaching it tonight I'll be careful you want to you don't want to you don't want to get too serious with this now you know you know people misunderstand you know why because they're carnal minded not spiritual minded he that is spiritual minded what's the Bible say he discerns the difference between what is spiritual and what is natural is that right all right so see to be spiritually minded is life and peace all right then he said then but straight way Jesus spake unto them and I'm going to leave you with this be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid cast away your fear because as he was so are we in this present world and you can't be that word seed alive in you without having the love of God in you because you can't have that faith without God's love they go hand in hand that faith that I've just spoke of tonight works by the love of God which God is don't try to put him on a don't so many don't understand agape love they make it felo feeling friendship and I'm nothing against that but Agape loves much [Music] higher it's God himself if that seed's in you and that seed's been quickened in you and alive in you the love of God's in you is that what the Bible said it sure did go back to First [Music] John amen that's right so I leave that with you be of good cheer it is I Be not [Music] Afraid yeah you were born defeated you come up through a Mucky smudy Pond you're pressing your way amen is that right press your way through it why because I'll tell you why God by his predestinated has has brought this seed to life and expressing itself coming to life and on top of all that it has it has overcome it has see it doesn't ex did the seed overcome yeah then you've overcome you're that seed you've done overcome it doesn't Express itself down there it's getting up to express itself neither did you and your sin and adultery and everything you lived in you didn't Express nothing but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself into life and now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the sunlight it's brought you out of what you it's brought out excuse me it's brought out what you really was in the beginning you see what I mean you saw the light and bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily be of good cheer I've overcome the world I've overcome it is I I am amen let's pray Lord Jesus this night has gone very quickly and some would say you went overtime maybe I did but in whose mind I said what Lord I felt you would had me to say so was it over time no let us lose sight of ourselves and our feelings and realize what's the most important is it our rest is it our fleshly man or is it the word everything will pass away this body is going to go to dust but it will rise again if that seed's been quickened inside of you now you have the token of it you have the Assurance of it amen Lord I Thank you for the word I thank you for delivering the word I thank you Father for the Deliverance you've given us individually personally and as we go forward Lord we continue to walk in this light this beautiful light the DU Drops Of Glory shining around us in us through US Lord what a blessed walk it is it's a path a shining light that grows greater and greater not dimmer and dimmer oh Lord till that perfect Rapture that perfect change that perfect that perfect realization we'll step into Lord that's what we're looking that's what faith sees that's what faith expects that's what faith has and now For Your Glory I commit these words to you in Jesus Christ's name knowing it's by your grace that's given it may it be quickened to every predestinated heart may they lose sight of who they not and realize who they are Lord grant it to that predestinated seed which I know you will it's not hard to ask that because you said you would do it it's already a promise and it's happening For Your Glory and Honor we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I'm going to have to sing that song again spread your wings in The Winds of Faith because what are you doing you're spreading your wings in The Winds of Who You Are amen that winds of faith is exactly who you are that faith is exactly who you are and start spreading your wings upon the basis of who you are start believing in what you are start acting upon what you are I just read it to you now only thing you have to do is have faith in what you are amen there are two roads you may take okay
