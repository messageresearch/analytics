[25:26] appreciate it they just would like a
[25:28] phone call so not having what happened a
[25:32] couple days ago when we were there that
[25:35] there was no one there and by the time
[25:36] we left there was a crowd um so anyway
[25:41] um sister Joanne just really rallied I I
[25:45] got to uh I I kind of considered it
[25:47] special to my heart to actually get a
[25:50] little chuckle out of her and a smile
[25:53] and uh some very personal words back and
[25:56] forth brother Bob you know I've been
[25:59] told that he he he he's not doing so
[26:01] good in his thinking but if that's the
[26:04] case then he had a wonderful day because
[26:07] we just had a lovely little conversation

[26:14] see the love that they have because
[26:17] brother Bob was telling me says oh that

[26:51] let's
[26:51] remember uh brother Sergey sister ulie
[26:55] and the family and their little getaway
[26:58] amen just uh turn in Hebrews the 5th
[27:00] chapter verses
[27:03] 8-14
[27:05] um and uh just want to just take a few
[27:10] minutes tonight Lord be with me I'll be
[27:13] very
[27:15] um
[27:16] uh precise concise
[27:19] tonight Hebrews 5 starting with the eth
[27:23] verse though he were a son yet learned
[27:26] he obedience by the things which he
[27:28] suffered and being made perfect he
[27:30] became the author of Eternal salvation
[27:33] unto all them that obey him called of
[27:36] God a high priest after the order of MDC
[27:40] of whom we have many things to say and
[27:43] hard to be uttered seeing you are dull
[27:46] of hearing pretty straightforward isn't
[27:49] he for when the time ye ought to be
[27:52] teachers you have need that one teach
[27:55] you again which be the first first
[27:58] principles of the Oracles of God and are
[28:01] become such as have need of milk and not
[28:03] of strong meat for everyone that useth
[28:07] milk is unskillful in the word of
[28:09] righteousness for he is a babe but
[28:12] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[28:14] of full age even those who by reason of
[28:17] use have their senses exercised to
[28:20] discern both good and evil Heavenly
[28:24] Father we just thank you Lord tonight
[28:26] Lord just speak to our hearts and Lord
[28:28] you know the prayer requests you know
[28:30] all of the needs father not just here
[28:33] but around the world father Satan is
[28:35] attacking this bride but Lord she is
[28:39] predestinated to stand this test and
[28:42] father not only will she stand the test
[28:44] but she will come out of the test father
[28:46] Victorious and full of Glory father we
[28:50] thank you for the opportunity to come
[28:51] before your Saints tonight I pray that
[28:53] you would just bless them in your
[28:55] precious name amen you you may be seated
[28:59] amen so as we would look at this tonight
[29:02] I just uh want to kind of look an
[29:06] overview of this real quick so here here
[29:09] in in uh these scriptures we see that
[29:13] God is bringing a pattern of his life to
[29:15] us and it is there that we would
[29:18] sometimes hope that life would just get
[29:20] simple for us but it is there that he
[29:24] learned obedience by the things he
[29:26] suffered and we can no less expect my
[29:29] brother and sister to learn obedience by
[29:32] the things that we suffer and uh you
[29:35] know the pattern that Jesus Christ gave
[29:37] to us uh was not just a pattern that
[29:40] only he could live but it was a pattern
[29:42] that he give to us as a Son of God he
[29:46] gave it to us that he would be our
[29:49] living epistle that the bride of Christ
[29:51] could read or discern that life and live
[29:55] that very life can we say Amen to that
[29:58] it was not just lofty words that we
[30:00] looked at and hoped that somehow we
[30:03] could do but these were words that were
[30:05] given to us that we by example would be
[30:08] able to obey and live that now we see my
[30:11] brother and sister the
[30:13] culmination uh we see it in our society
[30:16] now that you might have someone uh uh 30
[30:18] 40 50 years old who is actually very
[30:21] immature and and it is that we see that
[30:24] this is the kind of uh influences Satan
[30:27] would desire to leave upon the people in
[30:30] this age because if he can keep the
[30:32] people the Christians if he can keep
[30:35] them drinking milk then he's got no fear
[30:38] from them they'll never have enough
[30:39] strength to fight the battle they'll
[30:41] never have enough maturity to have
[30:44] discernment on how to fight the battle
[30:47] now I think we've all experienced times
[30:49] that we approach things entirely uh
[30:52] wrong we didn't see it the way that we
[30:54] should approach it in other words we
[30:56] took it and thought we could solve we
[30:58] thought we could fulfill we thought we
[31:01] could uh have the answer but to realize
[31:04] that it is that it's only comes this
[31:07] culmination this coming to maturity only
[31:09] comes our position in Christ and so it's
[31:12] there that a time as verse 12 says that
[31:16] when we ought to be teachers we have a
[31:20] need to be taught again and uh so the
[31:23] first principles of the Oracles of God
[31:26] and so as they type it very very
[31:29] strongly uh in such conditions this
[31:32] immaturity we need something that just
[31:34] makes us feel good about oursel now lest
[31:37] it would sound like I don't believe we
[31:39] should hear the gospel preached as
[31:41] something that would make us feel good
[31:42] about ourself but I believe the bride of
[31:44] Christ uh what makes her feel good about
[31:47] herself is not little Daisy pats on the
[31:50] back and not little oh you know you're
[31:53] such a good person kind of thing but
[31:55] what makes the bride feel good is when
[31:57] she sees herself in the word and even
[32:01] when the word corrects her she still
[32:03] feels good about it can you say Amen to
[32:05] that I I I think that is a beautiful
[32:07] thing that when we even see correction
[32:10] in the word we can actually say I need
[32:12] that I want that amen and so it is by
[32:16] this coming into maturity that we
[32:19] realize that as the time that comes that
[32:22] we ought to be teachers do we realize
[32:24] each and every one of us has a Teaching
[32:26] Ministry we have a Ministry that is
[32:28] teaching the world that Christ is on the
[32:30] scene he's present here today he's alive
[32:34] he's a Healer he still is revealing
[32:37] faith in us and it's there that we see
[32:41] this uh our life and not a teacher mode
[32:44] saying you know I'm a great teacher of
[32:46] the message but when you live the word
[32:48] out you're teaching someone amen might
[32:51] be your children it might be a a spouse
[32:53] it might be a friend whatever it might
[32:55] be a coworker but it's there that we
[32:58] need to be in a place that our life is
[33:01] teaching people that God is real amen
[33:04] but this milk thing my brother and
[33:07] sister I I I study you know different
[33:10] ways I guess you would say and sometimes
[33:13] we'll look at this and I I come across
[33:16] little things in my my studies or
[33:18] looking and and you realize that there
[33:21] is such a move in the land today that uh
[33:26] there's not a real preaching of the
[33:28] Gospel there is a a uh what do they call
[33:32] it a collidoscope or whatever that is uh
[33:35] of religion and what it is is just
[33:37] giving a little snippet just enough of a
[33:40] glimpse of each bit of religion that
[33:43] people feel comfortable that this is
[33:45] actually what it is and to me this
[33:47] reassures of what the prophet said that
[33:49] there had to be a Ministry that would
[33:51] come into this day to restore the gospel
[33:55] back to its correct form we don't need
[33:58] just a little snippet of something that
[34:00] makes us feel good about oursel we need
[34:03] Resurrection life amen and so it's there
[34:06] that as Resurrection Life comes into us
[34:09] we'll see that patterns are forming in
[34:11] the world today and we see how that that
[34:15] these patterns uh are coming that it is
[34:19] my brother and sister when the inmature
[34:21] start teaching the only thing an
[34:24] immature uh uh Ministry produce is
[34:28] immature Ministry and so God in this
[34:31] hour the prophet of God I'm not using
[34:33] his exact words but he's talking about
[34:36] how there had to be something and we'll
[34:37] touch on it in just a minute there had
[34:39] to be something fit for every age that
[34:42] comes down that was sufficient for that
[34:44] age and we're looking at the culmination
[34:47] Satan's plan is coming together and he
[34:50] is here to fulfill the plan in its
[34:53] fullness and so there has to be
[34:55] something here that is correct correct
[34:57] for this day the prophet many times says
[35:00] we cannot go back and take Moses
[35:02] Ministry we can't go get uh uh Noah's
[35:05] Ministry we can't go back and and say
[35:07] you know I'm just going to follow it all
[35:09] worked out well for Jacob I think I'll
[35:11] just follow the pattern of Jacob's life
[35:13] well my brother and sister we're living
[35:15] in this hour We're the bride of Christ
[35:17] we were called to fulfill the word for
[35:19] this hour and I think sometimes that has
[35:22] become like Words almost like a cliche
[35:24] for us we're going to fulfill the word
[35:26] for this hour but if we catch the
[35:28] revelation of how important you and I
[35:31] are in this hour we will never look at
[35:34] that the same when we talk about
[35:36] fulfilling the word for this hour it is
[35:38] a key element that God has called you
[35:41] and I to fulfill and so it's not a
[35:44] pattern of immaturity now I'm going to
[35:46] speak a little direct to you tonight if
[35:48] you don't mind we're seeing things come
[35:51] up in what we would call the message
[35:53] that are simply signs of immaturity
[35:56] people uh you might say uh being
[35:59] defensive of of their position well if
[36:02] we would just take a position in Christ
[36:05] then we don't even then have to defend
[36:07] it because the prophet of God said
[36:09] you're not called to defend this message
[36:11] you're called to live it and so Lord
[36:13] help us to live it and a sign of
[36:15] maturity is not to argue of the ups and
[36:18] downs and rights and lefts of this
[36:20] message the maturity is the life amen
[36:23] and when we are mature we live the life
[36:25] and let our life testify what we believe
[36:29] amen cuz anyone can get up and say all
[36:31] kinds of words of well this is and this
[36:34] is and that is but my brother and sister
[36:36] look at the life amen so it says that
[36:39] those that are uh using milk are
[36:41] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[36:45] amen so it's there we'll find as time
[36:48] goes on maturity my brother and sister
[36:51] is in such a fashion you know you can
[36:54] have a 10-year-old that's quite mature
[36:56] and we say they're very mature but we
[36:58] need to put a quantifier on there for
[37:00] their
[37:02] age and so a 10-year-old that's quite
[37:05] mature will not have the same maturity
[37:08] as one who has went through great
[37:10] struggles and trials and struggles of
[37:12] life and been in that they just you
[37:14] can't quantify that and the same thing
[37:17] and so as we'll look at this real quick
[37:19] tonight we'll find that the maturity
[37:21] that's coming forth in the bride right
[37:23] now being brought forth my brother and
[37:26] sister sister is us laying in the
[37:28] presence of the son is what's bringing
[37:31] this maturity we cannot produce this
[37:33] maturity on our own we'll say well I I'm
[37:36] going to be a stalwart soldier of the
[37:38] Cross I'm going to fight for the gospel
[37:41] but Peter thought
[37:44] that and Peter realized that God was
[37:46] actually calling him to a higher
[37:49] maturity than Peter even knew existed
[37:53] and if I could speak directly tonight I
[37:55] believe there's a maturity that God has
[37:57] for you and I that is higher than we
[38:00] even realize is here amen a place in the
[38:04] word that we we would find ourselves and
[38:07] look back if God carries a few years
[38:09] we'll look back and say I never ever
[38:12] realized amen and so God is bringing
[38:15] this maturity up and just as the wheat
[38:18] doesn't go from green to mature in one
[38:21] day neither will this bride of Christ
[38:23] amen she's got to separate from the hust
[38:26] she she's got to separate from this the
[38:28] things that have cradled it the things
[38:31] that protected it from all of the
[38:33] elements she has to separate herself and
[38:36] separation is hard I believe we can say
[38:38] Amen to that so as you look at that he
[38:42] says now in this I have the the
[38:45] commentary put in here a lack of
[38:48] maturity my brother and sister so milk
[38:51] has its season it has its time and I'm
[38:54] not saying that it isn't it isn't n good
[38:57] sometimes just to sit around and and
[38:59] talk of the very basic simple things of
[39:03] the Gospel we don't have to go deep dive
[39:05] into all kinds of complicated things
[39:08] sometimes it's just good to put a
[39:10] conversation around he's my
[39:12] savior he's my healer he's my deliverer
[39:17] and we can build a conversation around
[39:19] that but my brother and sister maturity
[39:21] is the combination of pulling all of
[39:23] these elements together to have a
[39:26] complete unit when it's finished and so
[39:30] hopefully I can clarify that in just a
[39:32] minute I'll tell you nothing trains you
[39:35] for
[39:36] war like
[39:39] Warfare I love history sister Sue always
[39:42] buys me some
[39:44] books uh you know here and there and in
[39:47] that my brother and sister they they
[39:48] make the soldier the recruit he crawls
[39:51] through the mud he has to run until he
[39:53] almost collapses has to shoot his gun
[39:55] until he's accomplished he they shoot
[39:58] real rounds they do all of these things
[40:00] my brother and sister but there's
[40:02] nothing like knowing the guy on the
[40:04] other end of that is really truly trying
[40:06] to kill you that brings a maturity it
[40:09] brings something to you that you can't
[40:12] experience by just sitting back and
[40:13] talking about it it is something that is
[40:16] real amen and I'm telling you what's
[40:19] happening in this age you know uh my
[40:21] brother and sister what's fitting for
[40:22] this age is God has got battle hardened
[40:25] now not hard hardened in their Spirit
[40:27] not hardened in their soul but hardened
[40:30] in the face of the enemy they don't run
[40:32] they don't retreat they don't give up
[40:35] amen they're not afraid of the enemy
[40:37] they know who the enemy is they know
[40:38] he's already defeated they know as a
[40:41] roaring lion as one brother said he's
[40:44] already had his teeth pulled amen so you
[40:48] have to face up to that that kind of
[40:49] maturity to realize that no matter what
[40:52] happens in our world Amen that God's got
[40:55] it in control and so if strong meat
[40:58] belongeth to those that are full age and
[41:00] I want to be of full age amen who by
[41:03] reason of
[41:07] use this is not somebody sitting in
[41:09] church getting preached
[41:11] to are you with me but by reason of
[41:18] use have their senses exercise to
[41:21] discern both good and evil you know
[41:23] what's hidden between the lines there
[41:27] the
[41:28] times in our immaturity that we didn't
[41:32] recognize and Satan pulled one over on
[41:35] us and told us if you as a real
[41:38] Christian but my brother and sister what
[41:41] happens we're
[41:43] exercising the battles we Face the
[41:46] challenges we Face the age that we live
[41:48] in is exercising us that we could come
[41:52] and have our senses exercised to
[41:55] recogniz ize these things can someone
[41:58] say Amen God's doing that in our life is
[42:00] he not amen it is happening amen we're
[42:04] not just hoping we're not looking for
[42:05] some thing off in the future but it's
[42:07] happening now I'm telling you my brother
[42:09] and sister that Warfare is not
[42:12] fun amen Warfare is work it is all not
[42:17] peaches and cream but as you look at
[42:20] this uh it is very fitting I hope you
[42:22] don't mind to use the word fitting it
[42:24] just struck me and I just kept in up in
[42:26] my thinking but it's very fitting that a
[42:30] mature bride is on the Earth
[42:32] today imagine in
[42:35] 20124 that we had an immature bride in
[42:38] the world today how she would fare
[42:41] against Satan's Onslaught my brother and
[42:44] sister but you see even though some of
[42:46] us are are not old enough some of you
[42:49] are not old enough let me put it that
[42:51] way but you see we've got to see the
[42:53] seasons of the message mature in now
[42:57] when I say that there's no class
[42:58] distinction between the young and old
[43:00] when it comes to the Bride of Jesus
[43:02] Christ because you see as the bride went
[43:05] through these things bringing maturity
[43:08] back here it wasn't coming it is coming
[43:11] let me let me just stop get my thought
[43:13] together it is coming to us as
[43:16] individuals but you have to recognize
[43:18] that God also deals with the bride as a
[43:21] body amen so all the years of extreme
[43:25] legalism start with the years when
[43:27] people said brother brandham is
[43:30] Christ and then we moved into the years
[43:32] right after his passing of extreme
[43:35] legalism and then we rebounded from
[43:37] extreme legalism into extreme liberalism
[43:41] and and we don't need to explain all of
[43:43] that but these were stages that were
[43:46] coming to bring it and what does it
[43:48] produce now a bride who stands on the
[43:51] word believes the word and it don't
[43:53] matter if she's a young or old old she
[43:56] is the bride and she's matured and she's
[43:59] ready to face the culmination of the age
[44:02] when it comes down my brother and sister
[44:04] now little things not to Spook you
[44:06] because we would look and think is there
[44:08] a correlation but you'll find that we're
[44:10] now having more and more people's
[44:13] accounts when their their banking
[44:15] accounts banks are shutting them off and
[44:18] then coming back and saying oops but you
[44:21] see it's not an oops my brother and
[44:23] sister they're just practicing cuz you
[44:25] won't buy buy or sell without their
[44:28] permission they're just practicing it's
[44:30] just coming along this culmination of
[44:32] all of these things and and little
[44:35] things that are happening that that I
[44:37] won't go into all this stuff it's in a
[44:39] way irrelevant but we're seeing how the
[44:42] very signs the prophet said would be the
[44:44] signs of this day are popping up around
[44:48] us we're seeing this come up we're
[44:50] seeing Israel once again you would think
[44:54] that after all of these countries
[44:56] uh you know well let me put it this way
[44:58] if some of them countries the leaders of
[45:01] those countries would just read the
[45:03] Bible and believe what they read they
[45:05] would realize they will not defeat
[45:07] Israel they will not possess that land
[45:09] they can't take it away because it's not
[45:12] about politics it's about prophecy and
[45:15] so as they are fighting in a physical
[45:18] world looking at boundaries trying to do
[45:21] all of this and to uh scheme and
[45:23] whatever God has got a work that must
[45:26] come to pass and it is amen so it's very
[45:29] fitting that there is a mature Bride on
[45:30] the Earth today she's coming up to that
[45:32] time and this bride is supported by the
[45:35] word it's not the other way around it's
[45:38] this bride's supported by the
[45:40] word but you'll find that underneath
[45:43] this
[45:45] bride that
[45:47] word has so
[45:50] solidified that she actually can stand
[45:52] on the word without fear of collapse she
[45:55] can stand on the word without fear that
[45:58] it will not do what it says so she is
[46:00] able with
[46:03] confidence you know there was a little
[46:05] video that I seen sometime a long time
[46:07] ago it was uh titled something like why
[46:10] women live longer than men and it showed
[46:14] these guys with two ladders one sitting
[46:16] on top of the other with a five gallon
[46:18] bucket on top of that at the top of a
[46:20] stairwell and I I looked at that and I
[46:22] thought yes definitely something like
[46:24] that would cause women to live a lot
[46:26] longer than men and you know you look at
[46:29] this my brother and sister because man
[46:31] in his own ability is always trying to
[46:35] improvise instead of going to something
[46:38] that is proven he's always improvising
[46:41] he's always trying to do this and and
[46:43] you'll see that this mature bride is
[46:45] coming she's gave up on the Improv
[46:50] now yes there it is speak louder sister
[46:54] Carrie she don't need need to improvise
[46:57] any longer amen we'll just cut it down
[46:59] to a word I can get out amen she doesn't
[47:02] need to improvise any longer she's got
[47:04] Solid Ground that she's standing on
[47:06] she's standing on this word and she
[47:08] knows this word won't fail her it didn't
[47:11] fail our lord Jesus it hasn't failed the
[47:13] Saints of the ages she can stand here on
[47:16] this word and say Satan get thee behind
[47:19] me knowing she's still got a battle to
[47:21] fight but knowing that God is not going
[47:24] to leave them standing alone
[47:26] oh I tell you it's a beautiful thing my
[47:28] brother and sister when we'll come
[47:30] because you see this is coming to the
[47:32] place where the prophet of God said when
[47:34] this bride realizes who she is she'll
[47:38] become an invincible Army and part of
[47:41] that seeing who she is is knowing this
[47:43] word I stand on will not fail amen and
[47:47] so Satan's always trying to prove that
[47:49] the word has failed some way but the
[47:52] bride is supported by the word in other
[47:54] words she she has nothing outside of the
[47:56] word she's got no other Foundation now
[47:59] the unbeliever or the skeptic would say
[48:02] well they got nothing they they've lost
[48:04] all of their their rational uh uh
[48:07] socializations and all of these things
[48:10] you know they've segregated themselves
[48:12] from the rest of the world and religion
[48:14] and whatever my brother and sister you
[48:17] look all the way down through the Bible
[48:19] and God has always been a separator he's
[48:22] always separated that so this bride has
[48:25] nothing outside of the word to stand on
[48:28] and what she needs is in the word today
[48:34] yeah I think those words are maybe a
[48:36] little deeper than we comprehend what
[48:38] she needs is in the word
[48:40] today right we cannot live Noah's
[48:42] message we can't go back to Moses we
[48:44] can't go back over here we can't go back
[48:46] over there and as much as we look at the
[48:49] natural type of Joshua and Caleb my
[48:51] brother and sister we can't even go back
[48:53] there now in a spiritual context we can
[48:55] take that but in a natural context we
[48:57] can't go back there we have to stand on
[49:00] the word for our day now brother Bram
[49:02] says in the message the token uh he says
[49:06] we're not to come together to talk about
[49:08] the message now if you isolated that it
[49:12] would not look very good right we're not
[49:14] to talk about the message we are to come
[49:17] together to get in the message and the
[49:20] message is Christ he is the word that's
[49:23] right we're to get into to it get
[49:26] beneath it yes sir that's what we're
[49:28] supposed to do coming right out of the
[49:30] token here my brother and sister we know
[49:33] what the token was was to get under the
[49:35] blood of Jesus Christ to get in his
[49:38] presence amen and the prophet of God
[49:40] even says that if we would get under the
[49:42] blood and the devil got in there with us
[49:44] amen he'd be our brother that's how
[49:46] powerful the blood is that the devil
[49:48] couldn't even get under it without being
[49:50] changed oh I'm telling you what we've
[49:53] got nothing to worry about of a life
[49:55] Chang changing power we got nothing to
[49:57] worry about whether God will take these
[49:59] little habits now I know it's not you
[50:01] but people like you have little habits
[50:03] that have hung on and we have those and
[50:06] I'll just break the ice for you I've got
[50:08] little habits I want to break them I
[50:11] don't want them but I am not afraid
[50:13] today whether that habit in my life will
[50:16] be broken because God's got it all in
[50:18] control and I keep getting back under
[50:20] the blood keep getting Washed by the
[50:22] Water of the word amen and those things
[50:25] get washed away just think about who you
[50:27] were about 5 10 years ago and you'll
[50:29] realize just what God has been doing in
[50:31] our life Can someone say Amen to that
[50:34] amen so you look at that and realize Now
[50:36] You See It Is by The searching amen
[50:39] we're not to just talk about the message
[50:42] but come together and get in the message
[50:45] and so it is by searching the scripture
[50:48] amen that we find our position now what
[50:51] I'm fixing to say would probably cause
[50:52] some maybe somebody will listen to this
[50:54] and disagree not that will be fine but
[50:57] I'm telling you my brother and sister we
[50:59] have created such a platform around the
[51:01] message that we Define what we believe
[51:05] and defend what we believe with quotes
[51:08] alone without going back to the word but
[51:11] that's not what the prophet of God told
[51:13] us to do he told us take it back to the
[51:16] word that's right amen so that is the
[51:18] very cpel what people argue or part of
[51:21] the thing is is what is the word amen
[51:24] well I still believe by example of what
[51:27] the prophet of God said and this is the
[51:28] word when he's talking about the word
[51:30] amen so if someone disagrees that's fine
[51:33] amen I think it be a white cloud White
[51:36] Horse we'll all do just fine but you
[51:38] look at this see he says in John 5:39
[51:41] search the scriptures for in them ye
[51:43] think you have eternal life and they are
[51:46] they which testify of me now obviously
[51:49] when John spoke that there wasn't you
[51:52] know a a a a message info base or you
[51:55] know uh the table or whatever else but
[51:58] there's a very strong point uh that was
[52:02] made of searching the scripture amen for
[52:05] in them you think you have eternal life
[52:07] now my brother and sister how many times
[52:10] have you searched may maybe in your
[52:12] position in life you wouldn't but you
[52:14] know you search and you find something
[52:16] but it's actually the wrong
[52:20] conclusion sometimes that's the downfall
[52:23] of
[52:24] people
[52:28] they go to
[52:29] Google and Google says do this and it
[52:33] might be exactly the opposite of what
[52:35] they really should so they searched and
[52:37] had a wrong understanding of what they
[52:39] saw a wrong interpretation or a wrong
[52:41] conclusion of facts now my brother and
[52:44] sister I believe when this was spoken
[52:46] here in John amen recorded in John that
[52:50] we're looking at this my brother and
[52:51] sister it is the searching of the
[52:54] scriptures will not simply do it for us
[52:56] we could be a great uh uh Scholastic uh
[53:00] understudy we could be a great mind and
[53:02] just study the scripture I believe
[53:04] there's probably hundreds of thousands
[53:06] of people today that study the Bible
[53:09] come up with the wrong conclusion amen
[53:11] they they come I just listened uh uh to
[53:15] a woman
[53:16] preacher that should have been my first
[53:19] clue but I just listened to a woman
[53:21] preacher give a defense of why we should
[53:24] let women in the PO
[53:27] now my brother and sister she actually
[53:28] made a very plausible
[53:31] defense but from the very beginning it
[53:34] was
[53:36] flawed and not picking on our sisters
[53:39] because actually I think sometimes their
[53:41] Ministry reaches more people than ours
[53:43] does but you look at that you see you
[53:46] can't just say well I researched this
[53:47] and found this and I found that you have
[53:50] to have the correct interpretation for
[53:53] our age when we're not looking back like
[53:56] I I I was talking to an individual and
[53:59] they were saying well you're saying that
[54:00] a woman should dress like this but how
[54:02] did you know the difference between a
[54:04] man's robe and a woman's robe back when
[54:06] Jesus was
[54:08] here well I don't live in that
[54:11] day I live in this day what's the
[54:15] interpretation for this day and this
[54:19] doesn't apply to us here but you look at
[54:21] that see we have to have the
[54:23] interpretation for our day
[54:25] not for another time trying to live back
[54:28] uh in another time
[54:31] now in the sermon God's gifts always
[54:33] find their places we'll look at this my
[54:36] brother and sister and one way we can
[54:38] look at this concerning like Ministries
[54:40] or whatever that a man that's called of
[54:42] God will always find his correct place
[54:45] in the body this is a promise from God
[54:48] brother brandham says here God gave his
[54:50] word so much here so much here talking
[54:53] about parceling it out as it were so so
[54:55] much here for each age and then he sent
[54:57] a prophet down anointed to make that
[55:00] word come to pass and it supports the
[55:02] other one that was coming and you can
[55:05] see that my brother and sister down
[55:07] Through the Ages it was always a
[55:09] prophetic word that pointed us to the
[55:13] Next Generation as it were or the next
[55:15] Prophet to come on the scene but you see
[55:18] the prophet of God here in several
[55:20] places tells us that he doesn't see
[55:22] another Prophet coming so we realize
[55:26] that not only does his ministry match up
[55:28] in the scripture that this is the
[55:31] seventh or last age the Fulfillment the
[55:33] maturity of it that there is not another
[55:36] word coming there's not another Prophet
[55:39] coming so it's there that it is spoken
[55:42] of and it supports the other ones that's
[55:44] coming see like the Messiah always
[55:46] supported every prophet in his own life
[55:49] his own being the word that was given
[55:51] for that day he come fulfilled that
[55:54] written word and foretold what the other
[55:56] one was going to be can you find me
[55:59] somewhere where the prophet of God said
[56:02] what the next Prophet would
[56:05] be not a challenge but something to look
[56:08] at what he did say was I believe this is
[56:11] the end of the ages I believe we've come
[56:15] to the
[56:16] maturity now if the word has come to a
[56:19] maturity itself in this day there must
[56:24] be a bride that correlates
[56:27] immaturity you can't have a mature word
[56:30] come and an immature bride continue on
[56:33] moving without coming to any kind of
[56:35] maturity now my brother and sister some
[56:38] people feel like that maybe you are
[56:40] stepping over your Authority when you
[56:43] would come and and take a position like
[56:46] I have a voice but the word of God tells
[56:49] us that the spirit and the bride say
[56:51] come so the bride's voice is connected
[56:55] directly with the spirit not Place
[56:57] subject to it not Place diminished next
[57:00] to it but become as a a portion or a
[57:03] part of the spirit being expressed in
[57:06] this day is a bride's voice and that
[57:08] bride is not going to come and just
[57:10] dance around and and act like she's just
[57:13] got the World by the tail she's a
[57:15] serious bride she's a bride that's
[57:17] making herself ready she has taken the
[57:20] word of her bridegroom and held it
[57:23] closely and said I believe that and I
[57:26] will act upon that and there's a
[57:28] separation to the world there's a
[57:30] separation to things around them I hope
[57:33] I'm making sense tonight amen so it's
[57:36] there as the Messiah always supported it
[57:39] every prophet in his own life was giving
[57:41] a word for the future you know what word
[57:44] the prophet seventh angel messenger had
[57:46] for this my brother and sister this age
[57:49] right here he didn't have it a
[57:50] supporting Ministry of another Prophet
[57:53] to come he had a support ing Ministry of
[57:56] a bridegroom coming and claiming a bride
[57:59] he had a Ministry that said she's going
[58:01] to rise up and accept her position and
[58:04] he's going to come and claim her and
[58:06] take her home now it's a many membered
[58:09] bride my brother and sister but our lord
[58:11] Jesus looks at it as though just taking
[58:14] one wife amen even though she's a many
[58:16] membered body and he's coming for her
[58:19] not for another age not for another
[58:22] thing not for another ideology but for a
[58:25] bride amen not to continue now this
[58:28] might hurt just a little bit uh but it's
[58:30] not a Continuum of a prophet's message
[58:34] my brother and sister the word gives us
[58:36] the example of a time when it comes
[58:38] Isaac and Rebecca there comes a time
[58:41] that eleazer for all his importance for
[58:44] all his authority for all that he was
[58:46] called to do and for every bit that he
[58:49] believed and stepped into his calling
[58:51] there come a time that elaser gets to
[58:54] watch Rebecca run to her bridegroom amen
[58:57] eler doesn't follow behind her now
[59:00] listen to me but elaser stopped and said
[59:03] I've done my job and she's now coming
[59:07] into the fullness of who she is and he
[59:10] is being fulfilled as a
[59:13] bridegroom amen it's not this
[59:15] continuation constantly elaser didn't
[59:18] knock on the tent pole and say hey I
[59:21] just feel like I should come to supper
[59:23] tonight make sure it's all all right my
[59:25] brother and sister wasn't his calling
[59:27] see the word that called you and I is a
[59:30] word that promised to bring you and I to
[59:32] maturity and it's doing it amen it's
[59:35] bringing this bride to maturity and
[59:37] she's now rising up in faith realizing I
[59:40] have a calling and I'm going to fulfill
[59:43] that calling I don't need to ask someone
[59:45] how I should fulfill it the word has
[59:47] spoken to me and I know how to fulfill
[59:50] it because the word says that he
[59:53] suffered learned Obed obedience through
[59:55] suffering and here this bride is now
[59:57] learning what it's like to enter into
[1:00:00] spiritual
[1:00:01] warfare and she is becoming quite
[1:00:05] Adept at fighting the spirits of the age
[1:00:10] remember the time now Church bear with
[1:00:16] me I remember the
[1:00:20] time there was a constant running to the
[1:00:23] pastor
[1:00:25] of how do I do this and what should I do
[1:00:27] and where should I do and all of this
[1:00:30] and there are some pastors and I I don't
[1:00:32] say this in any way negative that still
[1:00:35] want to fulfill that
[1:00:38] role but Saints I want you to recognize
[1:00:41] maybe I wouldn't call it my vision but
[1:00:44] it's just how I see
[1:00:46] it a church that is
[1:00:49] maturing doesn't have to go and cry on
[1:00:51] the pastor sold soldier
[1:00:55] shoulder all the time right she's coming
[1:00:58] into
[1:00:59] maturity
[1:01:02] amen there's this lady that lives in my
[1:01:05] house looks like my
[1:01:06] wife she wants me to quit bringing her
[1:01:09] up but
[1:01:10] anyway you know when the light bill's
[1:01:12] due she doesn't have to come and ask me
[1:01:14] do I pay the light
[1:01:15] bill maturity's brought her to the point
[1:01:18] if we want to have lights the bills got
[1:01:19] to be paid and she does it and this
[1:01:24] bride been given remember brother Brown
[1:01:25] talked about the
[1:01:27] checkbook this bride doesn't have to
[1:01:30] stop and say do I have permission right
[1:01:32] we can take that direct back to what the
[1:01:33] prophet of God said amen write the check
[1:01:37] so here's a bride that's coming into
[1:01:39] maturity not constantly having to go is
[1:01:41] it okay if I write the check but she
[1:01:44] knows she can write the check and she
[1:01:46] knows the check is good and there's the
[1:01:49] shift that is coming into the bride of
[1:01:51] Christ she's coming into maturity and
[1:01:54] you know know like I said there are
[1:01:55] there are pastors I I know men
[1:01:57] personally they they really would like
[1:01:59] the church you know you're going to buy
[1:02:00] a car come talk to me well I'm sorry if
[1:02:03] you're going to buy a car and you come
[1:02:04] talk to me you'll probably be buying a
[1:02:06] cheap car and you'll probably be buying
[1:02:09] a car that's
[1:02:12] white but maybe you don't want a cheap
[1:02:15] car and maybe you don't want one that's
[1:02:19] white so the only way I can force you to
[1:02:21] buy a cheap car that's white is to lean
[1:02:24] on you to impress upon you to start
[1:02:27] using some kind no my brother and sister
[1:02:29] that's not maturity maturity is this
[1:02:32] bride has caught a revelation of who she
[1:02:35] is and realizes these things the color
[1:02:38] of her car the color of her shoes the
[1:02:40] color of this that and the other has
[1:02:42] nothing to do with her salvation but
[1:02:45] where she stands in Christ has all to do
[1:02:48] with it amen hallelujah so you look at
[1:02:51] this amen I need to hurry on
[1:02:55] cuz they amen and then when he came he
[1:02:58] was a fullness of all the prophets
[1:03:00] manifested this talking about Jesus cuz
[1:03:03] they were the word of the Lord they see
[1:03:07] this is where people I want you to catch
[1:03:09] this I I'm not on a crusade tonight but
[1:03:11] I want you to catch this where people
[1:03:13] come to a place but don't move on are
[1:03:16] you can you see where I'm at they come
[1:03:18] to a place amen now they were the word
[1:03:22] of the Lord uh and uh
[1:03:25] because they were the word of the Lord
[1:03:26] and he said himself if you call those
[1:03:28] Gods whom the word of God come to how
[1:03:31] can you condemn me when I say I am the
[1:03:35] Son of God so here it was these men were
[1:03:39] the word of the Lord here brother
[1:03:41] Brown's breaking the word down and says
[1:03:43] these prophets of the Ages were the word
[1:03:47] of the
[1:03:49] Lord so you can see where people in this
[1:03:51] day and age have come to a point they
[1:03:53] can't get pass the Prophet The Prophet
[1:03:55] is the word of the Lord but my brother
[1:03:57] and sister we need to come into the
[1:04:00] place of the manifestation of the word
[1:04:02] of the Lord you can say the prophet's
[1:04:04] got the word of the Lord thus saith the
[1:04:07] Lord but there has to be a manifestation
[1:04:10] of thus saith the Lord coming forth out
[1:04:13] of that if not we've stopped right there
[1:04:15] amen only part way you call them Gods
[1:04:18] who the word of the God come to how can
[1:04:20] you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of
[1:04:22] God see even those in that age was
[1:04:24] identified as Gods God called them
[1:04:27] himself Gods what were they they were
[1:04:31] manifestations of his word well what did
[1:04:34] the prophet come along and say my
[1:04:35] brother and sister that you are amen he
[1:04:39] said we are manifestations so he's
[1:04:41] saying the prophets were manifestations
[1:04:43] of the word of God but then the prophet
[1:04:46] takes it a step further and says you are
[1:04:49] manifestations of the word of God Amen
[1:04:52] Hallelujah didn't leave it all in in the
[1:04:54] lap of the prophet he said that word the
[1:04:56] prophet had will come to you and cause
[1:04:58] you to be a representation or
[1:05:00] manifestation coming to maturity of the
[1:05:03] word of God Amen hopefully I'm not too
[1:05:08] excited tonight
[1:05:10] amen and here was he the fullness of the
[1:05:13] word deity embodied deity manifested In
[1:05:18] the Flesh and all that was in
[1:05:21] Christ he bottled up some more no sir he
[1:05:25] poured it out into the church into the
[1:05:31] body of Believers not Church
[1:05:34] denominational not church as an
[1:05:38] entity and all that was there was poured
[1:05:41] into you and I see we got to stand today
[1:05:44] Hallelujah there any gods in here little
[1:05:47] G little G amen we don't want to get
[1:05:50] some warped philosophy about whoa we're
[1:05:52] going to do this but my brother and
[1:05:54] sister by the word of God we are little
[1:05:56] Gods praise the Lord amen we've got the
[1:05:58] very life of Jesus Christ in us and the
[1:06:01] Very life that was in him poured in us
[1:06:03] will produce exactly the same seed so
[1:06:05] we're not looking for another seed we're
[1:06:07] not looking for another life we're not
[1:06:08] looking for another manifestation we are
[1:06:11] the manifestation of the word for this
[1:06:14] hour amen and if Christ is here in this
[1:06:18] hour then we know where we stand
[1:06:23] Hallelujah
[1:06:29] my oh my God so excited I lost
[1:06:34] myself
[1:06:37] okay watch for these gifts that these
[1:06:41] men
[1:06:42] brought they couldn't have brought that
[1:06:44] to a prophet now it's just talking about
[1:06:46] the wise men yeah the
[1:06:50] Magi they couldn't have brought that to
[1:06:52] a prophet it wouldn't have been right
[1:06:53] see them gifts couldn't have went to
[1:06:57] Elijah they couldn't have went to Moses
[1:07:00] they had to come to him and being those
[1:07:03] gifts were strictly meant for that day
[1:07:05] and that was to identify who he was by
[1:07:08] these gifts then here come God along and
[1:07:11] protected him and kept them two years
[1:07:14] down there until they found the perfect
[1:07:16] sign how fitting same thing today amen
[1:07:21] we're not looking at a whole different
[1:07:23] manifestation the prophet of God said
[1:07:25] same thing today now let's go back and
[1:07:28] read this again because this is the same
[1:07:30] thing for this day in relationship those
[1:07:33] gifts were strictly meant for that day
[1:07:36] right that gift wise men camels a star
[1:07:42] meant for that day but to identify him
[1:07:45] and then Here Comes God along and
[1:07:47] protects him I'm telling you my brother
[1:07:49] and sister look right down through the
[1:07:51] age that we're living in we'll start
[1:07:53] with brother brand a gun blows up in his
[1:07:55] face the bolt tears up his head the
[1:07:57] stuff blows in his eyeball but God
[1:07:59] protects him didn't keep him from a gun
[1:08:01] blowing up but protected him now we
[1:08:04] won't elaborate on that because you can
[1:08:06] make your own references but I want you
[1:08:07] to stop and look in your own life as God
[1:08:10] protected any of us has God not been on
[1:08:12] the scene for you and I and it's not
[1:08:15] always in a physical element sometimes
[1:08:17] he's protecting us from Spirits he's te
[1:08:20] from things that Satan would try to
[1:08:21] throw in our way but he's protected us
[1:08:24] and we stand here today or sit amen so
[1:08:28] he keeps them until they found the
[1:08:32] perfect
[1:08:33] light oh praise God hallelujah we could
[1:08:38] be Baptist tonight we could be lutherans
[1:08:41] tonight we could be Mormons or Catholics
[1:08:43] tonight but God protected us until we
[1:08:47] found the perfect light amen oh
[1:08:50] Hallelujah that makes my heart so happy
[1:08:53] amen how fitting amen you got people
[1:08:57] that's just as loyal nice people genuine
[1:08:59] people but you see in that there's going
[1:09:01] to be something come forth that God's
[1:09:03] always done to identify this day this is
[1:09:06] the day when these things are spoken to
[1:09:09] happen it's talking about today talking
[1:09:12] about this age talking about this this
[1:09:14] time there won't be many just a very
[1:09:18] very few that'll be saved the Bible said
[1:09:20] so that just be a
[1:09:22] handful
[1:09:25] just a
[1:09:26] handful well there's more than eight of
[1:09:28] us here
[1:09:33] tonight draw your
[1:09:36] straw we'll see if you're in or
[1:09:40] not but you see this was the culmination
[1:09:43] of the
[1:09:44] ages we don't sit here and try and
[1:09:47] figure out who the eight
[1:09:50] are we were called someone say Amen to
[1:09:53] that that we were called and God said
[1:09:57] this work I began in you I will finish
[1:10:03] so the example the prophet was making
[1:10:04] when he's talking and taking the
[1:10:06] scripture and making that example he's
[1:10:08] not cutting it down to eight people he's
[1:10:11] there in a vision of the marching to the
[1:10:14] music my brother and sister there was a
[1:10:16] multitude out of every nation that was
[1:10:19] marching the prophet's not trying to
[1:10:21] create some doctrine that there's only
[1:10:23] going to be people but he's telling you
[1:10:25] this is not going to be a large group of
[1:10:29] people just going along as a
[1:10:32] movement this is a bride
[1:10:35] called and that's why we need to
[1:10:37] identify we need to speak out I'm called
[1:10:40] I'm standing there don't let the devil
[1:10:42] rob you of your position I am called I
[1:10:45] know without a doubt God called me yes
[1:10:48] amen and he will finish the work he has
[1:10:51] started amen the one be many just a
[1:10:54] handful let's go on there brother Alex
[1:10:56] if you'll just Jesus said himself it was
[1:10:59] in the days of Noah wherein eight Souls
[1:11:01] were saved eight Souls out of a
[1:11:03] generation likened to this as it was in
[1:11:05] the days of Noah what was it great
[1:11:07] cultured people great workers great
[1:11:08] Builders great everything as they had
[1:11:11] made this civil civilization just like
[1:11:14] it great things that they had and as it
[1:11:16] were in the days of Noah so shall it be
[1:11:18] at the coming of the son of man see and
[1:11:21] God had Noah to identify his promise
[1:11:23] word and it was very fitting the ark was
[1:11:27] fitting to the word of God that he spoke
[1:11:31] that he would destroy man but he saved
[1:11:33] what he
[1:11:34] could you realize how important those
[1:11:36] words right there
[1:11:38] are but he saved what he
[1:11:42] could because there was a people who
[1:11:45] wouldn't say yes to the
[1:11:48] word but there's more than eight of us
[1:11:50] here tonight saying yes to the word
[1:11:54] you see God is not going to take that
[1:11:56] lightly he's not going to just brush
[1:11:58] over that the very life the very seed
[1:12:00] the very desire remember the man who
[1:12:02] come to brother brandom and said you
[1:12:04] know I I I I want the Holy Ghost I I
[1:12:06] read this little tract and something
[1:12:08] inside of me I went here seeking the
[1:12:10] Holy Ghost I went here seeking the Holy
[1:12:12] Ghost I went here seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:12:14] I want the Holy Ghost brother brandom
[1:12:16] how do I find the Holy Ghost and brother
[1:12:18] brandham tells him remember that moment
[1:12:20] when you read that track and something
[1:12:22] inside of you changed and you knew that
[1:12:25] it changed that's when you received the
[1:12:27] Holy Ghost am but we need a movement we
[1:12:31] need an activity we need a date we need
[1:12:32] a time we need no my brother and sister
[1:12:35] we need our hearts turned we need our
[1:12:37] hearts to just turn over and say I
[1:12:39] believe this word I believe this word
[1:12:42] this is the truth this is who I am there
[1:12:45] it is my brother and sister amen he
[1:12:47] saved what he could now these wise men
[1:12:50] bringing their gifts identified their
[1:12:51] gifts identified what it was that's the
[1:12:53] reason God protected those gifts through
[1:12:56] every move that they made he protected
[1:12:58] it until they arrived with those gifts
[1:13:00] because they were fitting for the
[1:13:04] time they were the
[1:13:07] ones in essence God used to
[1:13:11] manifest that that child that was Jesus
[1:13:16] Christ has
[1:13:22] come r the other
[1:13:24] day a man describing what prophecy
[1:13:27] fulfilled
[1:13:28] meant and I feel like he come fairly
[1:13:30] close to it but my brother and sister
[1:13:33] when the prophet of God took the word of
[1:13:35] God and opened it read between the lines
[1:13:37] opened all of this laid it out for us he
[1:13:40] told us there would be a bride on the
[1:13:42] earth at the coming of the
[1:13:46] Lord not
[1:13:48] rhetorical not not um oh what's the word
[1:13:51] that just jumped off my mind
[1:13:54] but a real bride let me just put it that
[1:13:56] way get down to Basics b a real
[1:13:59] breathing walking talking Bride on the
[1:14:02] earth that is there not to be redeemed
[1:14:06] see people sometimes say well you know
[1:14:08] we'll be redeemed in the Rapture my
[1:14:10] brother and sister you have been judged
[1:14:12] now amen you are not judged and redeemed
[1:14:15] in the Rapture or there you have already
[1:14:19] come into that position standing before
[1:14:22] Christ finished work I don't feel
[1:14:24] finished well it won't matter what you
[1:14:26] feel it's what God thinks amen it's What
[1:14:29] God Says amen now let me get back here
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:33] huh wasn't the day made civilization
[1:14:37] great thing Ark was fitting to the word
[1:14:39] of God that he spoke that he'd destroy
[1:14:41] man but he saved we could okay yeah here
[1:14:43] we are now these wise men bring their
[1:14:45] gifts identified their gifts identified
[1:14:47] what it was and that's the reason God
[1:14:49] protected those gifts I already read
[1:14:50] that haven't I every move that they made
[1:14:52] he protected until they arrived with
[1:14:54] these gifts because they were fitting
[1:14:56] for the time does my church understand
[1:14:59] that brother Brown puts that out to them
[1:15:01] do you understand what I'm telling
[1:15:07] you eight people were fitting for days
[1:15:09] Noah's
[1:15:11] day
[1:15:14] amen all those of an
[1:15:17] age plus Joshua and Caleb were fitting
[1:15:21] for Crossing into the Promised Land
[1:15:24] there's a bride that's fitting right now
[1:15:28] she's here right now designed of God
[1:15:31] called of God and God is watching over
[1:15:34] her to bring her forth as a glorious
[1:15:38] bride amen not just somebody that
[1:15:40] believes a message let's get Beyond I
[1:15:42] believe the message as being some
[1:15:43] Benchmark I'm telling you I was called
[1:15:46] you were called We're bride my brother
[1:15:48] and sister he has made a promise he is
[1:15:50] coming back for a bride and if I can
[1:15:53] ever just get in gear here we'll get
[1:15:55] along amen I I'll just he will protect
[1:15:59] it until his purpose is served I'm glad
[1:16:03] of that now we go along here you see
[1:16:08] this gift that's in you it can't just be
[1:16:10] given to
[1:16:12] anybody sometimes we think that you know
[1:16:14] it almost be like you know a raffle or
[1:16:17] something you know we do that go get the
[1:16:21] flower little girl R raffle he loves me
[1:16:25] loves me not well I think you have to
[1:16:27] keep going around right it's correct I
[1:16:29] haven't done that before I'm not no no
[1:16:33] this is not something like that and then
[1:16:34] God just said oh look you win the
[1:16:38] lottery Lottery of Salvation no no God
[1:16:42] specifically you and chose amen the gift
[1:16:46] in you can't be given to anybody but
[1:16:48] look at this we're talking about praise
[1:16:50] my brother and sister we're talking
[1:16:51] about a bride who's coming in into a
[1:16:53] place that they are able to do this so
[1:16:55] you see it's the fruit of our lips amen
[1:16:59] our praise our worship is for Christ
[1:17:02] alone you see they it said there earlier
[1:17:05] in the quote I'm kind of dragging this
[1:17:06] out but earlier in the quote it couldn't
[1:17:08] be given to Elijah it couldn't be given
[1:17:10] to these others amen this fruit of our
[1:17:14] lips can only be given to Jesus Christ
[1:17:18] and that's why my brother and sister
[1:17:20] you'll find the struggle that's going on
[1:17:22] today when people start praising and
[1:17:24] lifting men up and up and up it's almost
[1:17:27] as though God is obligated to knock them
[1:17:29] off of the podium because that praise
[1:17:31] should be for our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:17:34] no one else amen our God is a jealous
[1:17:38] God Amen Hallelujah let me jump forward
[1:17:41] here it's already time to quit and I'm
[1:17:42] not done
[1:17:45] amen look at this now I
[1:17:49] think to me okay if it's okay if I can
[1:17:52] just expr express it from the way I see
[1:17:54] it the fact that brother BR chooses to
[1:17:57] express this in the six seal has some
[1:17:59] significance to me and we won't go into
[1:18:02] time to explain that but you'll see
[1:18:04] paragraph 81 of course just like always
[1:18:07] I encourage you go back study what's way
[1:18:10] before this and way after this so we
[1:18:11] don't end up with something
[1:18:13] skewered she was
[1:18:16] barefooted she stopped She held her head
[1:18:18] down she seen who it was and she was
[1:18:21] very shy she knew this great person and
[1:18:25] she was just a cousin to these other
[1:18:27] girls their father was forming on this
[1:18:29] big armor outfit so they they kept she
