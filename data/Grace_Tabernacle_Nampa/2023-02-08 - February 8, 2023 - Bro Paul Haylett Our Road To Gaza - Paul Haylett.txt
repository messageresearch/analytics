TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen just to realize that God would come down and meet us and um we once again want to look at this and let's turn our Bibles to acts the eighth chapter brother Trevor sister Kerry not well okay let's remember Sister Carrie and brother Trevor for strength amen chapter starting with verse 26. and um I have verse 40 here but we'll just see where we end up amen now I love this my brother and sister because through the scripture we we see times and places now when an angel of the Lord comes my brother and sister it is not a lesser message than God himself it is absolutely lip to ear from almighty God to us and so as we look at this and an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and go toward the South and to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza which is Desert and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia a eunuch of great Authority Under Candace Queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure This truly is an important man and had come to Jerusalem for to worship now brother Branham says that he had come God brought him there for the day of Pentecost so we're not talking about a man who had come just with a remote interest in religion this was a man who had a burning desire to know God was returning and sitting in his Chariot read Isaias the prophet then the spirit said unto Philip go near and join thyself to this Chariot and Philip ran there to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah saying understandeth thou what thou readest and he said how can I except some man should guide me and he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him and the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his sheer so opened he not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life was taken from the Earth and the eunuch answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this of himself or some other man then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized and Philip said if thou believe us with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is a son of God and he commanded the Chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both Philip and the eunuch and he baptized him and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away Philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing but Philip was found I'm not sure how to pronounce that word I was going to look it up but zodus passing through preached in all the cities till he come to caesarea Heavenly Father we ask you Lord just to come and speak to us tonight and lord it's our hearts desire father Lord we see so many things happening around us father Maybe it hasn't changed maybe it's just our attention has been drawn but Lord it sure seems to me that you are moving upon your people to draw them into a higher realm to draw them into a higher place to make father even as that Lord graduation of our brother Gideon father to make us aware we need to live right for the moment not looking to the Future not looking down the road but to live in the moment for how quickly our life can change Lord we ask that you would change our lives father and Lord we don't want to be slothful so we ask you Lord come quickly let your word come upon us anoint us Lord for our lives to be corrected Lord or for our lives to be lifted up and edified before you father not in days or weeks or months to come but now Lord we ask you to bless this time in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I certainly would ask you to pray not as it is just for uh the retief family but sister Jerry and I was very blessed to spend time with the youngest of brother Gideon's grandchildren and I don't say this to bring emotion on you but I I've share this with you to realize it's not just Lord bring them comfort but the youngest grandchild Gareth was at the scene of the accident crying out to God raise up my grandpa raise up my grandpa Lord raise up my grandpa that young man's heart is completely broken we need to remember Gareth in prayer amen I don't believe it was an undue Vision review he had of his grandfather but this young man lifted up loved adored his grandfather this is the kind of pain and that our family is experiencing amen let me get on Focus here every time I think about these things I start to cry as we are reading this scripture my thoughts go my brother and sister how that God always works in the realm of the supernatural it is not that we expect to see some flashing of light and thunder and whatever it would be but my brother and sister whether we recognize it or not God veils himself in our everyday life he's right here with us and whenever God is dealing with you amen as God dealt with you this week spoke to your hearts just touched you when God is dealing with you do you realize that that is a supernatural event taking place and so as we look at this because our God is the god of the supernatural now the world out here believes they need to put God in the book of history and study him as a history book but my brother and sister we serve a risen savior that is truly Supernatural and so is God is uh dealing with us do not downplay that you know I I'm finding as I get a little older I wish that by God's grace this would have happened a few years before but it no doubt I'm the one that hindered it but my brothers and sisters we get down the road I start to be just a little more open and expressive about the fact that sometimes we get caught in a realm that we tend to downplay God like well the Lord was speaking to me well I don't mean really speaking to me I mean it was no my brother and sister don't downplay that that was God whether it was in your heart that he spoke or here in the mind that you comprehended God is speaking to his church amen speaking to his bride and we need to come to a place where we have confidence enough and display that confidence where our young people would say you know what when God's dealing with me I don't need to be ashamed I can stand up and say God's been speaking to me and and I believe this amen and so as you look at this and realize that the realm of the Supernatural is taking place around us each and every day and we don't always understand God's plan but we'll look at this and realize my brother and sister that that truly Our God's plans are perfect and so is God is veiling himself in our everyday lives they realize that our day-to-day life is a supernatural event taking place and if you want just a little a very low-key example of a supernatural event taking place we'll look at this and look at the scriptural definition of the demons that have been turned loose in the day that we live in and anyone that has been around it all recognizing the oppressive spirit that is building up in not just our nation but the world and so you see this outpouring of these demonic spirits my brother and sister they're overpowering they're causing what you would call Sane people and causing them to do crazy things even to taking of lives into different things like that and you realize that the supernatural event taking place today is the Hedge as a word that God has put around you and I he said I would raise up a standard my brother and sister we don't need to look for a wall being built up we need to look and realize the Holy Ghost is here and it is sufficient for our present need amen as it is we have the answer to the devil's question and so we don't need to be ashamed of that we need to stand on the word and say thank you Lord for a supernatural event taking to place today amen and so is this a supernatural events are taking place now look at this the prophet of God emphasizes this was not the holy ghost that come upon Philip my brother and sister he says Philip already had the Holy Ghost this was an angel of the Lord amen let's not be mistaken that there was just a little stirring as it were in Philip's Spirit to go and do this but it literally was an angel of the Lord moving in the midst of a Philip as speaking to him now I just want to throw this in in the world we live in today there's many critics say well William Branham Angel of the Lord waiting for this that's all just some strange Hocus Pocus well my brother and sister my Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever and God sent an angel of the Lord down to Philip God can send an angel of the Lord anywhere he pleases I don't care what their theological understanding says I don't care what their words of the Greek and this and that Arabic whatever means my brother and sister if God wants to send an angel God sends an angel and then God anoints Sons and Daughters of God to receive the message that an angel brings amen because what good would it do if God sent him Angel a messenger and there's no one to hear it and no one would obey it so we look at this and he tells them rise and go my brother and sister you realize how Divine this appointment is Philip doesn't know there's an Ethiopian on the road there's no one come along and told him but an angel and he gets up and now I want to bring this because we actually are a people of science did you realize that amen the prophet of God said that that man had broke into God's laboratory Laboratories are used for science so it's there that we are a people of science but we've got the original formula amen we don't need another formula we don't need a new modern version of this but it is there if you would just bear with me tonight to make the point amen a Divine appointment and so here is God putting in place the Ethiopians rate of travel velocity and he's taking now in Rising Philip up from a place obviously sitting or resting and he raises him up and God knows exactly my brother and sister by this formula where the Ethiopian and Philip are going to come together and you say brother Paul how do you figure this because there had to be a pool of water in a dry land and so God intersects this to come together Philip with a message Ethiopian with a hunger in his heart and a pool of water oh my brother and sister don't tell me God wasn't up there doesn't have that he can go up there the X and the Y and the this and that and whatever only he don't need to take a pencil and wave his arm it's just there and he speaks it and he gets Philip up and sends him on his way now I believe if we could study history far enough we'll find that this Ethiopian has already made great progress in his journey but he's coming down my brother and sister without realizing it to a Divine appointment in a supernatural event oh I say Lord let us have a Divine appointment in a supernatural event don't let us be home when we should be in the house of God don't let us be absent-minded when we should be focused Lord don't let us be distracted when we should be looking with intensity oh my brother and sister so as we look at this if you were a naval officer you would say I could take a Sextant that I could took and take and look at the Horizon look at the stars look at this and I can then Mark a mark on a map which is amazingly accurate and how much more that God would come down into Supernatural and be able to mark the time and the place and everyone who should be involved and where it should happen I say thank you Lord amen the Lord dealing with us is no accident my brother and sister God did not accidentally bring you to church tonight God did not kind of just stumble along and kind of give a little influence to you well could I should I no my brother and sister God knows what he's doing amen and so we see Philip he rises and goes and he meets this Ethiopian now this unit my brother and sister is a man of great Authority the word says that he has charge of all of Queen Candace's wealth her treasure I mean that's pretty important man but do you realize that everyone is equally important to God doesn't look and say oh that's a queen she's higher than you that's a king you're underneath God looks down and says that's sons and daughters and I'm telling you my brother and sister of the first level oh I don't know how to say this of the first level of genealogy always comes down Sons and daughters you don't find Sons and Daughters lifted listed after fourth fifth tenth cousins they're always right there at the top so God is moving in such a fashion that as this uh Ethiopian is is going along there uh you know it is that way that God uses the prophet shows us so clearly we could take it out of scripture we can take it from the prophet however you desire to do it but I'm just going to speak it to you tonight everyone the scripture says everyone that hungers and thirsts after righteousness shall be found see I'm going to confuse you a little bit it is true because there's only one place we find the satisfaction of the Soul and the prophet of God says we never sought him he sought us so we're hungering and thirsting I don't mean to confuse anybody whatever I just want to lay this out in another little fashion every one of us in our position we are found I'm hungry and God found me amen my soul needs satisfied and God brought the word to me amen so I didn't go to him oh I went to church either no my brother and sister it's God who has found us and it's in our time of need so I say this this Ethiopian traveling down the road it was not anything to do with when he left and how far he would travel that day and what ability or the endurance of his horses or whatever it would be an endurance of the human element God said I have appointed the time to come to you it was never never Philip never the Ethiopian but God said I've appointed this time and I will find you in the desert don't you love the symbolism as it were of that not in a lush easy place let's go over here and pick a pomegranate let's go sit over here in the shade let's do this but God met him and every one of us has come to a supernatural event in the desert in the drive time of our life we've met God and he come to us why because there was something down inside of us that was saying I don't know this world has to offer my brother and sister as I've shared there's testimonies around the message people sitting on a bar stool there's a brother back to East I won't be any more specific than that and he taught he shared with me I I preached in their church and by God's grace a lovely service and he comes to me and he said I want to share my testimony briefly brother Paul I was sitting on a bar stool been born and raised in the message walked away from it in business making good money sitting in a bar stool and somebody said God's not real and he said I've gone up slam my beer on the counter and said let me tell you and then he walked out of there angry and when he got out the door he was like what did I just say and behind that come the words I believe that and it turned his life around oh I'll tell you what my brother and sister why would we even bother to put a limitation on God why even let the devil bring that to our lips a limitation on our God Hallelujah so here's a man with a hunger and he's going along in his Chariot and it's reading aloud maybe my brother and sister he was reading aloud so that his servants would hear also or maybe that's just a value that he recognized hearing it with his own ears now I prefer myself to believe that reading aloud has a certain characteristic to it that has an impact on us and I just share just sorry to bring it back to my own life but many years ago sitting in church sister Jerry just Faithful is faithful with the children in church and you know me wavering in and out and in and out God dealing with me amen and one day as it were my Chariot come to a halt amen and God start dealing with me and I realized my problem was is I didn't believe it enough to say it out loud but in my heart my heart said I believe and I found myself standing behind a pig shed one night doing chores and speaking out loud to the stars in heaven Lord I believe and then I had to start working on Amen but by God's grace I broke through that barrier that had been placed there and as that happened I started to be able to sit in church this might not seem like a great significance my brother and sister but I'm telling you in some places and sometimes the question asked to you that is ask you demands an answer out loud in the military you're never allowed to nod your head Soldier is this weapon ready no sir I I sir hmm what if we changed ourselves our our perspective and looked at it and said God wants an answer from me not a nodding of my head not a wave of my hand he wants to hear my voice amen speak amen amen now look this anointing that was on Philip was not to just say I went down on the road to Gaza and there was an Ethiopian there and I yelled at him you need Jesus Christ you know like people in the intersections and the cities they got a little a little sandwich board or whatever and they stand the intersection almost getting run over and they're yelling at the cars that go by you need Jesus but God said that isn't what I want you to do Philip I want you Philip to go near I want you to get right over there where this gentleman can look at you and recognize something sense something about you and he gets right over there very near hey man I'm kind of thinking my brother and sister that near must have been about in the middle of the road amen not often the bushes somewhere yelling at him as he went by but in the middle of the road and there it is that now he is present in this man's life and and I'm not trying to take Liberty tonight but I want to stretch these boundaries just a little bit amen you know it's not enough just to wave over the fence at your neighbor maybe sometimes you need to draw nearer to that neighbor you need to come right down where that neighbor can look eyes on you and he can see there's something about this family next door that's different amen now if they don't care to know why you're different you can't knock their fence down but my brother and sister are often times The World Is Still Desiring they're hungering they don't know where to find it they've been to this church and this church and this church and this church they don't know where to find it and it's there at the point that they would assume that all churches are the same God put you in the neighborhood and he calls you to come right down there and draw nigh to them draw near to them and so as it is he's standing there very near amen Philip doesn't shaunt her over there he ran to him and he heard him reading the prophet isaiahs and here's another thing I think sometimes this might be just you can just put it down to opinion so that way you toss it out it's just fine you don't have to be guilty but many times my brother and sister our first words are positive pointed statements but what did Philip do understandeth what thou readeth you see the Ethiopian didn't see him as any form of adversary he almost will look down and says maybe this guy's as confused as I am maybe he doesn't understand it either and maybe we could have a dialogue so he wanted he wanted Philip to come up in the Chariot because now hey this is a this is a good discussion I don't think you run all of The Treasure of the queen without being a pretty smart guy I don't think that you're going to graduate into that position without understanding how to lead people and how to deal with situations and have problem resolution and and have a vision and and a kind of you might say an open mind to uh grasp the concepts and so it's there that he invites Philip to The Chariot and he says you know what I can't even I can't even uh figure this out I'm not going to figure this out there's no way for me to figure this out lest some Man shows me now I want you to catch the contrast of the world we're living in today we don't want anyone to tell us anything but here's a man of great Authority saying how can I know last some man he didn't say unless some Supernatural event takes place no sir what he didn't know at that time was the supernatural had already taken place when God the angel of the Lord tells Philip come on get up and go find this man there was a supernatural element taking place and this man is here honest opening heart very clear saying you know what I want to know but I don't know how unless somebody would tell me and so God opens this door and I'm telling you my brother and sister when God opens the door for you to speak that blunt to people you better have the courage Lord help me too Amen to speak amen that God knows what he's doing my brother and sister and so he goes and he starts to speak to me he says you know what how can I except some man should guide me now this man is not going to force him this man is not going to tell him what to do and then just leave him but this is the key that Philip is there and Philip is going under the leadership of the holy spirit amen Angel of the Lord speaking to him he comes down there and he is now going to just be guide non-religious Authority not a man demanding of what he should or should not do right there's a song says he leads his dear children along it doesn't say he hurts them or drags them he leads them what is it we have the perfect guide Saints amen we have the perfect guide oh my oh my oh my we have the perfect God and so it's there uh you look at that and he says okay Philip I gotta head myself a minute to go there he desired Philip come up and sit with him and I'm telling you Saints tonight I I hope you don't mind that I'm just a little excited about this but I thank the Lord for Holy Ghost leadership amen there's men that have come into my life through the years and maybe the season didn't look so good we had a pastor once here in the valley I treated him just lower than dirt and I'm ashamed of that but I'm telling you I look back through my life and see the impact that man had on my life he was there constantly when I was rude to him he always come back with with kindness he always come back with Grace and and you know God give me an opportunity many many many years ago to to make it right with him and you know as I'm looking at him and standing there crying as a grown man crying looking while I was in my 30s I don't know if I was grown man or not I was working on it though and I said forgive me brother you know what his response was your bum but I knew God would do something with you know his answer was brother Paul I always knew God would work in your life amen and I knew that you would come then I was Marvel how'd you know this because it was something that spoke to him not a carnal voice something in the word and I I just I'm so appreciative my brother and sister I can't even I'm just my world got turned upside down this last few days it's maybe brought out the chemical reaction of emotion striking neurons which causes your tear ducts to open or a supernatural event you know it's pretty easy to get just a tad bit callus just attend it not enough to feel like we're disrespectful or anything but just enough and then God sends something in your life did I tell you about that reaction that strikes the neurons or a supernatural event and God comes down and says you just need a little tenderizing and I want you to know when God tenderizes his doesn't look like a mallet with little spikes or little pyramids on top of it that's not God's idea of tenderizing so as it is my brother and sister I got to stay on track tonight amen so he's there saying I don't know about this man I just want to say tonight lift my hand and say thank you Lord for Holy Ghost leadership amen that the power of God would come down to where we are amen and thank you for men and women that will listen to the voice of God amen amen it's just it's a beautiful thing to see this take place so he he's led by the spirit spoke to go join yourself he starts his witness with a question amen versus a statement and then when he asked this he sets back and gives this Ethiopian eunuch he gives him time to you might say formulate his answer he doesn't throw any yes or no's at him he just throws it out there for the man to be able to speak from his heart and say you know what I I don't know how I could unless someone would help me and what that was as he's speaking he's not actually speaking see this whole time my brother and sister he's not actually speaking to Philip everything that Philip is speaking and every response spoken by is not to Philip Philip is the vessel and I want you for just a moment to turn Philip into nothing more than a giant jug that contains the the a spirit of God contains the wine amen the new wine is Hope Philip's nothing more than a joke but this man don't recognize it and so it is as he's speaking to Philip God is then anointing Philip to pour out a little more only he's not pouring out Philip he's pouring out the words the very Spirit the very nature the very life of our God Amen and so is it is there tipping the the vassal and pouring out just a little bit more it wasn't quenching to the hunger of this man I want you to catch this he didn't quench the hunger of that man it increased it amen as this is poured out to him it is increasing his hunger in other words a few words of the Gospel will not satisfy him and I've heard people say well just a little bit of the Gospel will just do the job I'm telling you my brother and sister the word of God says it's an inexhaustible Supply and God would not give us an inexhaustible Supply so that we would sip at it amen he wants to pour it out and we are drinking it up amen and it's becoming the very life and the Very nature of us and he wants us to take a bigger drink and a bigger drink and a bigger drink amen and while we will be satisfied to quit searching as it were for the world out there my brother and sister don't any let anybody fool you that you're going to just come to the place there's a difference between being satisfied and being filled amen we can be filled with the spirit right go back many refillings but there's still a Hunger for More Of God the prophet of God shows us and says even shows us how even in heaven there'll still be a hunger but we'll satisfy it by standing and being and worshiping in the prayer presence of God not that we got to sip and we go off and ignore him for a month or two or many it don't work that way Hallelujah so as he starts to speak to him amen I want to read to you out of a quote here hear ye him see so you see that it doesn't take great big things to bring Christ it doesn't take great organization neither does it take great churches great Gathering but it takes a sincerity of one heart to bring him and I think in the Bible when Philip was having a great healing campaign and the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit called him from his campaign and went into the desert to meet one Ethiopian oh it don't even make sense look at the success we could have had Philip if you had stayed here in town kept the stadium full kept the people engaged talked to them it would have been but God saw the hunger of one Ethiopian in a backside of a desert and said I will satisfy that sincere hunger to lead him to a saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus you see my brother and sister you can fill the building but how many will be filled when they leave the building there's the difference right there and it's a human nature to worry about filling the building but what we want to do is see those that were there filled when they leave the building Hallelujah and so we see here that he starts to read to him or speak to him and referencing the scripture he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his sheer so open not he not his mouth you know there's some theologians I don't know exactly what all these terms might be there's theologians in the day that we live in actually so Brazen to declare that Jesus just didn't speak because you know basically they would just hold it against him and you know kind of like they read the riots today you know anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law so Jesus just chose to be silent that ain't what that scripture just said is it he was silent to fulfill the word of God amen amen that wouldn't fit most of us most of us would be their hey officer you're asking the wrong guy I'm innocent you do this I'm calling my lawyer I want my one free phone call and I don't know Jesus is silent anointed fulfilling the word might have been easy my brother and sister to have called them white at walls and pointed out very clearly you know just as those he met that day with the woman he could have just started telling them well you sir and this is what you have done have you confessed that to the priest he could have defuse them poured water as it were on their powder there was no bang left when he started to tell him the sin and the things of their life but that didn't fulfill the word absolute silence is what fulfilled the word and the world mocked him for that as though he had nothing to say the critics would mock him even to our present day for not having anything to say but the word had already said it amen now I want to lay this little point just briefly I don't get sidetracked my brother and sister there's times for us to be silent because the word has already spoken people say well I just got into this deal to defend the message the scripture has already spoken no amount of words on your part will defend the message There's A Time For Us to be silent what made the difference even to the thief on the cross was not the words that were spoken but it was the presence of God him takes a man where he can say he's innocent be silent over there be in he's innocent there's no sin found in him we we deserve this but not him and you know it's kind of a tricky conversation when we should speak and when we should be silent God give us wisdom God give us wisdom let me hurry right along here amen so he's verse 32 he's talking about he takes him the scriptures LED as a sheep to the slaughter now let's turn to Isaiah 53 1-7 I believe this is just a very uh Fitting Place to go ahead and actually uh uh read the scripture that is being referenced here who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground for a hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men definitely would not make it on TBN that might seem like a dry statement to say but my brother and sister you understand the religious world today is half Hollywood the Prophet The Prophet spoke half Hollywood and half religion I read a little blip of a guy that was associated with TBN and he said you know for a spontaneous religion religious show it sure took us a long time to put their makeup on hmm despise rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him it was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken you want to take this in context my brother and sister you can go back to Peter's Behavior amen several of the Apostles called upon deny him amen and many a person today who calls him Lord and savior denies him under pressure um oh no I'm not talking about a dungeon somewhere Saints I'm talking about the office at the water cooler yeah surely it's born our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities can we say Amen the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed I believe this is scripture we need to come to the place my brother and sister that we hold this very dear and all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth and he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is before her Sears is dumb so he opened not his mouth now you look at this I'm believing my brother and sister that out there on that dry dusty road to Gaza we've been out there my brothers sister it's nothing but a desert Amen in modern times they've drilled big Wells and done different things but in those days my brother and sister you look at the landscape and realize that for Miles there's nothing and that's where God takes this takes this to take place and Philip anointed by the spirit amen following the leadership of a voice of an Angel starts to lay out who Jesus Christ is and all that pertain to him now this man my brother and sister was not dumb he was not foolish he was without knowledge right we can use the terms they're kind of blunt we can use the words is someone stupid that can be a connotation that they have an inability to learn but one who is ignorant is just lacking the knowledge my brother and sister are you with me go verify with that with Webster if you need to so you see he is there without this knowledge and as Philip is speaking to him a fire a light is coming on and a fire is kindling and he's then says okay this Prophet you're talking about recognizes as a prophet ma the kingpins of Israel didn't recognize him as a prophet as this this Prophet is he speaking of himself or someone else the writer now my brother and sister he's looking back to Isaiah now is Isaiah talking about Isaiah or is he talking about someone else oh my don't you wish that you got those kind of openings around the water cooler gas station grocery store wherever it was somebody would want to know what is the voice that is speaking in this day and then he lays all about our lord Jesus out before him now my brother and sister you'll find as this is done we don't know what the actual uh words in the text and everything that was there but as this goes along we will find that this man is coming to a place give such a Clarity to this Ethiopian of the message of the hour some of you know brother Kyle's testimony I got to visit with him for quite a while the other night he's a very enthusiastic amen just just has such a burning desire and he said now brother Paul I know this will take too long but I just want to share my testimony with you and I thought about it's like well if you take as long as I would take me then I'll I'll just wait for another day amen but we had this lovely time my brother and sister what happens when the word is given to you in the right way this man didn't say well I don't know about you but Matthew 28 19 Brother Kyle faced family they're rejected not completely but in this sense you got it wrong boy but it was Revelation in him because God did the speaking amen and when it come down it's there my brother and sister this ethiopian's catching this he's like okay okay so now if this is the if this is the word and this is this and this is this this okay put this over here put that there and it says x times iPhone sometimes nobody had to beat him nobody had to say look you've been in the church for six years now and why aren't you about no sir there was Revelation struck him because this comes straight from the Throne of almighty God right to him and it's laid out and he says you know what I I I need to be baptized you know would there be some reason why I can't be uh baptized and and Philip you know says hey look if you are a real believer now I'm going to say this slightly different Philip did so just give me a little Grace if you're a real believer you will be baptized not you might or you'll think about it or you know surely it was good the first time it's just a matter of words no sir you'll desire to be baptized and so God is dealing now as he brings him to this place my brother and sister if we would spend more time I think preaching about Jesus and last time educating people about the message did I say that out loud uh oh I said that out loud you guys will forgive me right because I can prove it about a thousand ways over by scripture we're trying to educate people into a message how about a revelation oh my Saints I'll just tell you I'll just speak it blunt I've had people say well if you believe that explain it to me and God turned me mute is that right mute's not speaking God's turned me mute and I'm actually saying oh why can't I oh oh only to realize later it was exactly the right thing because someone wanted a paragraph by paragraph explanation of the message of the doctrines Etc of that and say well I'm a Believer explain it to me why can't you explain it because God didn't want me to explain it because you see once we have explained it theologically I'm getting ahead of myself let me just hurry amen that was a rabbit Trail excuse me so what this was my brother and sister is I skip over a couple things here this was a predestinated Son of God being revealed amen you say well well he was catching baptism and catching this revelation of who Jesus was my brother and sister that whole oh I know this is going to sound a little strange to you tonight but it was not Jesus Christ being revealed at that place our lord Jesus doesn't need to be revealed again he's already been revealed it's revealing the seed in the son or daughter of God Amen we don't need to re-crucify our lord Jesus we don't need to bring him to another Resurrection we don't need to take him up in a cloud my brother and sister and it's all been done we need to look to the revelation of the word of God revealing the son or daughter of God on the Earth today and if they have a theological Spirit on them a religious spirit they'll want you to explain that but if they have a c Gene of almighty God they will look at that and say I always knew there was something more there but the problem is if we educate them in we get them in the message but they've never ever got a revelation of who Jesus Christ was because they've never got a revelation of who they are and until they get a revelation of who they are they will not see themselves in the word of God but the minute you catch the the deal I don't care what happens I don't care if I fall I don't care if I got mud on my face I don't care if I wear the knees out of my britches crawling along like a beggar I'm a Son of God and God will Redeem Me Hallelujah those are the ones my brother sister that don't quit amen what is it there's no argument there's only amens well what did the prophet say he said Real Son of God will say Amen to every word of God and I don't mean to come across like I'm might have sounded but simply that's what happens a Believer says Amen to the word believer doesn't say well go get your Concordance I once you can take this and run it through prudence and this is man I can believe that no real believer something inside of them says that's the truth that's nothing but the truth so Philip tells him if you believe with all your heart now mayest and the answer said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God can we say that tonight I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and so he commands The Chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water Philip and the eunuch and he baptized him and when they come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away Philip you know brother and sister we need to have a little more of this in our churches because the problem we have is we get to such a place now this can be hard for me to really explain very good so please grasp it it's we we come to a place that you'll find people that are like well this was Pastor he he led me to the Lord he baptized me and it's there it'd be good if some of those just disappeared out of your life all that was left was a revelation of Jesus Christ because see you're not pressing forward we're always waiting for the next word from Philip what is the next thing that Philip brother Philip has for us on Wednesday night what does brother Philip have for us during these special meetings what we need is get brother Philip out the presence of God the Holy Ghost in and it wouldn't matter who was up here speaking you'd walk out and say God spoke to me tonight amen God revealed himself to me tonight but you see my brother and sister I believe with all and you can find this if you want to spend a few hours studying not really that hard to find at all just to take you just a few hours but you look at this now the prophet of God ties this in and he says and so here is the eunuch and when he comes up out of the water Philip disappears and he's there now the unit under the spirit of the Lord he doesn't go I got to go back to Jerusalem I got to go wherever I got to find Philip no what does he do he's rejoicing it's back in the Chariot and starts heading to his house and his house is all the way down here in Ethiopia and by the time he gets down there he's so burning on fire that he doesn't just tell mama or daddy or wife or kitties he starts to tell Ethiopia amen he starts to let him know that Jesus Christ is alive and well there's a supernatural God on this scene it's a real word of God in this hour he doesn't go down there and say well I think I'm gonna build a church I think I'm going to copyright this go down to the Ethiopian government copyright this no sir he starts telling people hey I'm in a position of authority this is who I am people be hell yeah you're important but let me tell you what happened to me nothing to do with importance God met me and the backside of the desert amen what did the prophet to cut this a little short if you don't mind me skipping over a couple of things what did the prophet of God say he said tell them how your candle got lit amen here's the Ethiopian almost on the back side of the desert I'm wondering what does this even mean and God sent a man to me and he revealed the word to me he revealed a message that was for my hour amen he wasn't telling him about what happened uh in in Egypt he wasn't telling him about what happened beyond that my brother and sister he was telling what was happening right now he is risen amen he's alive it's real today he's risen and I want to tell you I want to just to put this I don't know you probably caught it but it's not his road to Gauss and my brother and sister it's our road to Gaza that God said I'm going to meet you wherever you are at and I'm going to send the right person into your life to speak to you that you can believe and when the supernatural happens you are not oh this will be misunderstood but you're not tied belt to belt with the man amen God took the man amount not took him out of your life literally but spiritually amen the prophet said I have come to introduce you to Jesus Christ amen the prophet of God himself he said I did not come to tie you I'm just paraphrasing to tie you to bring you to bring something to myself I didn't do that I came to introduce you to Jesus Christ and if you don't mind me going this far tonight amen God took the prophet out of our life amen in the Physical Realm took him out that we would then look to the word which is Christ himself and we're looking to the word and we are walking on to our house to our nation to our Kindred to our tongue not constantly looking back what will brother Philip say what will brother Philip say my brother and sister are what does the Lord Jesus say what does a revealed word in this hour tell us oh I'll tell you my brother and sister it's time for us on our road to Gaza to realize God didn't call us to turn around go back to Jerusalem and see what the religious leaders had to say about it but he called us to go on and carry the word oh Hallelujah oh my you didn't gonna see Philip I don't believe there's never another recorded place of Philip referring to the Supernatural on the road to Gaza why oh he cared trust me he cared but it had become such a common place that when God took him out there to the Ethiopian he knew God was doing something amen and when God took him back planted him again and he traveled through all those lands and ends up going to caesarea Philip didn't look back and say now I hope that God will be with me again I hope that this message I'm sharing might impact somebody like the Ethiopian he knew if God sent him there there was a seed present there was a life that had to be oh did you guys memorize the formula I didn't either but I tell you what it worked so well long before man ever thought about GPS God's been positioning his men Hallelujah sent one into my life amen that brother amen you might say he didn't have I don't even know how to describe that I don't even know how to say that I'll tell you what God did though God showed me a man that could be treated every way every ill way I didn't call him names I probably come close though but that brother God put him right in the midst of my road to Gaza a man that could show such love in the face of such disrespect amen and it changed my life I was like my if I could grow up to be half that man that brother is I would feel very happy my brother and sister we don't need to be in charge of the Queens Treasury to be important in the kingdom of God but what we do need to do is climb in our chariot they look a little different now don't they my man had a four horsepower Chariot in them days he is important guy six horsepower Chariot he was really on top of it if you had a one horse power chariot well it was the economy car amen you go a lot further on less feed none of that mattered to God didn't care that he held the checkbook to a kingdom amen what he did hold was a treasure Bound in an Earthen vessel and he said that's good enough for me to keep this appointment can you say Thank You Lord tonight amen we didn't have to be important we didn't have to have any of these things but God says I know where you're at and I know the season and I will meet you there amen Amen Let me just hurry I have about two minutes and thou know us all things Philip was sent from you remember telling you he left Mary had to go out into the desert right in the midst of a big meeting left thousands of people and the city was rejoicing and God said go out and stand in the desert you remember that for one man in Ethiopian a covered colored man coming down from Jerusalem returning to Ethiopia who had joined greatly with the queen and he was reading the prophet Isaiah and he didn't understand what he was reading and God told Philip go join yourself with him and when he did he spoke to him about Christ Jesus baptized him in a little hole of water out there and Philip never did return back to Samaria as far as we know or as the Bible gives reference the Holy Spirit caught him away and the eunuch didn't see him no more oh sorry about that sorry about that go ahead brother get in and the eunuch taking that message on down into Africa well there you are you see God knows what to do many times we guess at it but God knows just exactly what's right doesn't he oh how I love him his sovereignty his goodness his Mercy oh I tell you my brother and sister it's not a chance that we could in honesty say tonight that God doesn't know what he's doing in our life and maybe if we could just let go as that eunuch did and just say you know what I'm going to trust you to lead me and show me what I need and my brother and sister God's gone I'm not defending preachers God's got Faithful Men on the Earth today that want nothing more than to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ but the world today doesn't want to accept little Philip they want something greater and you know what he left with this man this Ethiopian well Philip left with him he didn't leave a man the man wasn't rejoicing you're going to get baptized in the name of Philip what he left with him my brothers and sisters was a man that had a functioning revelation of Jesus Christ and what Philip left with the Ethiopian was a functioning revelation of Jesus Christ not a broken revelation go look up the word function or functioning amen you'll find that there is purpose and responsibility associated with those words he left a man with a purpose and because God had been so gracious to meet him on the road he realized he had responsibility to this gospel that had been shared to him my he didn't tell him out of there now this Doctrine you've got to take this Doctrine you've got to do this he'd already caught the doctrine Jesus Christ Doctrine man it ought to be the doctrine that we tell everybody about you see we need less intellectual Revelation and more functional revelation you know my brother and sister I'm going to say this in a tad bit joking but you can buy something and you don't even need to see where it's made from all you have to do is open it up and follow the directions and if you can't make no sex no sense at all out the directions I think I can tell you what country it was made you know attach a to d but D is a not what am I attaching it to and what am I attaching it with and what's it supposed to do it's like hey we can save one millionth of a cent by not printing that page of the directions but God's got a step by step and is there in the chariot Philip didn't fill his mind full of all kinds of other things he filled the Ethiopian eunuch's mind with the revelation of Jesus Christ and let the Revelation fill in all the other blanks that need to be filled in but you see how I can't help but just explain this amen sister vika if you would come maybe start to play something Satan's comments got us explaining it all we get their minds so muddled up with uh well if you catch this now and this and if you get that you'll get this over here and you'll get that my brother and sister we left a page out of the directions maybe more than a page how about we just get the people pointed to Jesus Christ oh now and I'll speak this as I close as I'm done I believe this message is Jesus Christ so we don't have to go throw the message on a shelf somewhere no no but we need to make sure that we don't add all these other things all of this so you'll just understand not my brother and sister the Holy Ghost God Can Explain himself God knows how to explain himself amen can we witness that tonight amen that God explained himself to us and continues to do so hallelujah oh praise the Lord God bless you tonight Saints hey man let's just stand sing a song or two before we dismiss Lord prepare me do you know that song sister vika

glad we got a place amen when I think of that song I I think of the Ethiopian I don't believe he was reading this to satisfy a curiosity if one has ever been truly hungry for the word of God there is something taking place inside here it's not just a thought my brother and sister but there is something just as though it was absolutely a physical need remember brother Brown talking about the little boy eating The Petal off the bicycle there was something deep down inside of him made it satisfied I still don't know how I don't say this to be funny but I don't know how you discover that what you're craving is in a petal on a bicycle but there had to be Supernatural sense and I don't know how it is that we pick our Bible up brother Trevor and days that were discouraged I didn't say I don't know really how but in my flesh I don't know how it is that my Bible can fall open right to the very scripture I need and I hope you follow me here there's something maybe it was a smell maybe there was just some sense there that he looked one day to The Petal of a bicycle and said that's what I need but I can tell you the supernatural sense that has come to you and I to look at this word and say I've got to eat this I've got to eat this right here I can't live without this hey man let's Close Our Eyes just thank the Lord for his love grace and mercy tonight as we dismiss Lord Jesus we love you we thank you for your word father that Lord you met us on the backside of our desert and you brought the word that changed our lives father now you keep wooing us and drawing us back to you and all I can say is tonight thank you Lord thank you Lord for that wooing thank you Father for that hunger that had to be satisfied thank you Lord for the men Lord that would go and stand on the road to

home and to our family we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah God bless you Saints amen maybe let's just sing that little song If that same spirit and I believe it is amen if that
