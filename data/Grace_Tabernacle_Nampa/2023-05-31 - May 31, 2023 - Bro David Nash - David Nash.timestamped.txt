[32:05] song service Lord and even as the people
[32:07] who went before the uh the ark and
[32:10] around Jericho Lord is singing the songs
[32:13] and doing what they were doing
[32:15] to bring the presence of God and in
[32:17] obedience to your word
[32:20] so father in the it was the Levites I
[32:23] believe that blew the trumpets and the
[32:25] walls came down so father we come to you
[32:28] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ and
[32:30] if there's anyone with a wall a problem
[32:32] whatever it might be Lord Jesus you're
[32:36] more than able
[32:37] to tear it down it said they fell down
[32:40] flat
[32:41] so there was no Trace that those walls
[32:44] were ever even there
[32:46] so father that's the way we come to you
[32:48] tonight
[32:49] I come here as a man get me out of the
[32:52] way father that you can speak heart to
[32:54] your heart to people in Jesus Christ's

[33:00] well thank you brother Paul for having
[33:02] us here again tonight each one of you
[33:04] for coming out it's good to see you my
[33:07] wife actually was gonna make it but
[33:10] she's still got that cough stuff and
[33:12] she's either afraid that she's going to
[33:14] disrupt the service or
[33:16] cough it on to somebody so she's just
[33:19] she goes not yet not yet so just pray
[33:23] for her and uh
[33:24] pray for me I I I'm staggering a little
[33:28] bit tonight because my son sprains his
[33:30] ankle on Friday and not to be out done I
[33:32] sprained mine on Sunday so
[33:36] so we're limping a little bit but that's
[33:38] just you know these things go with the
[33:41] territory I suppose
[33:42] uh as I was looking at some things and
[33:46] I've been studying different things
[33:47] today this might come rather strange
[33:52] if I'm catching the way the holy
[33:54] spirit's trying to lead us let's turn
[33:57] first to Leviticus the seventh chapter
[34:03] I think we might have spoke on this some
[34:05] years ago here and I did it once in
[34:09] Mexico not too long ago
[34:11] but in the seventh chapter of Leviticus
[34:14] the first verse
[34:16] it says this is the law of the trespass
[34:18] offering it is the most holy
[34:22] in the place where they kill the burnt
[34:25] offering shall they kill the trespass
[34:27] offering and the blood thereof shall he
[34:30] sprinkle roundabout upon the altar
[34:33] and he shall offer
[34:37] of it of the fat thereof and the rump
[34:39] and the fat and the cover at the inwards
[34:42] and he continues to talk about that and
[34:45] then he turned verse 5 he says they'll
[34:47] burn the the leftover there on the Altar
[34:49] and he repeats in verse six every male
[34:53] among the priests shall eat thereof and
[34:55] it shall be eaten in the Holy place for
[34:58] it is most holy
[35:01] we'll just read a couple more there it
[35:03] says and the sin offering is so is the
[35:05] trespass offering there is one law for
[35:07] them the priest that makes the atonement
[35:09] therewith shall have it and the priest
[35:12] that offers any
[35:14] man's burnt offering even the priest
[35:16] shall have to himself the skin of the
[35:19] burnt offering which he offered
[35:22] gracious Heavenly Father we love you and
[35:25] we thank you tonight in the name of
[35:27] Jesus Christ amen
[35:29] and be seated
[35:32] we've been ministering the last couple
[35:34] weeks almost through I guess uh
[35:38] in Tri-Cities so I've got a little bit
[35:40] of this in my head still
[35:43] oh
[35:44] on Romans 3
[35:47] and I'm not sure how the Lord wants to
[35:49] put this together with Leviticus 7 but
[35:52] we'll see
[35:53] so God bless you let's look at Romans 3
[35:55] you can it's okay to be seated as we
[35:58] read this portion of this very simple
[36:01] it's the last verse of Romans chapter 3.
[36:06] and it's just one verse there
[36:16] and the last verse of Romans chapter 3
[36:19] is 31.
[36:21] and he said I'll read 30 and 31 seeing
[36:24] it as one God which shall justify the
[36:27] circumcision by faith and the
[36:29] uncircumcision through faith do we then
[36:31] make void the law through faith God
[36:34] forbid yea we establish the law
[36:39] so as we look at this and we think what
[36:42] is he
[36:44] what's he really talking about when he
[36:46] said you know do we uh
[36:49] he's talking about the circumcision
[36:51] there and the uncircumcision and we know
[36:53] of course the Jews were under the law
[36:56] they circumcised every man-child and if
[36:59] they weren't circumcised then you know
[37:01] they had no part in the Covenant and if
[37:03] we go back all the way to Abraham it was
[37:06] through the Covenant of circumcision
[37:08] that God
[37:11] he said is this is my Covenant that I
[37:13] make with you and this is my you know
[37:16] it'll be the circumcision and all your
[37:17] males and he talks about those things
[37:19] under the law
[37:21] but in and when we think about what is
[37:24] circumcision what he was actually
[37:25] talking about there well for you know
[37:28] male female it's just the removal of
[37:31] flesh is what the circumcision is
[37:34] and so and that was the you know for the
[37:38] Jews and for those who were going to
[37:40] receive the law after Abraham that was a
[37:43] type or a shadow of what God is shooting
[37:46] for all the way down through history
[37:50] he wants to see the flesh because this
[37:53] flesh as we have it and we understand it
[37:55] it came from sin born in sin shaped
[37:59] their iniquity came into the world speak
[38:00] and lost or speaking lies and and how
[38:03] that this this flesh and this the sin of
[38:05] this flesh and how that it uh
[38:09] you know in another place there in
[38:10] Romans and also again in Corinthians it
[38:13] talks about you know the the law Wars
[38:16] the law of the flesh Wars against the
[38:19] law of the spirit and so forth so we
[38:21] realize when we come down to this
[38:23] particular scripture
[38:25] uh he said but you know here it's one
[38:30] God and he's going to justify the
[38:32] circumcision how does he do it he does
[38:34] it by faith and he's also going to judge
[38:36] the uncircumcision or receive the
[38:39] uncircumcision through faith because
[38:42] Abraham had Faith before he received the
[38:45] circumcision
[38:46] he'd already met with God he had you
[38:49] know part of his promise and those kind
[38:51] of things all that had come to him by
[38:53] faith in God
[38:56] so when we receive God and we we receive
[38:59] Jesus Christ we receive the faith we
[39:02] take our little bit of faith that we
[39:04] have as the Bible says everybody's got a
[39:06] little bit of faith
[39:09] and when we put our faith into his faith
[39:12] then it's no longer our faith that does
[39:15] it it's the faith of Jesus Christ
[39:19] because we're taking our little portion
[39:21] whatever it is and some people have you
[39:23] know large portions of faith in others
[39:25] it seems like we barely make it from day
[39:27] to day
[39:28] but God does it and and it's and how do
[39:32] we do it well it's like you know I'm
[39:34] limping around today and my wife is you
[39:37] know she thinks I'm a little crazy but
[39:39] yeah and I pray she's probably right but
[39:41] I'm just sitting there going oh man with
[39:44] his stripes I am healed with his stripes
[39:46] I'm Healed with his stripes I am healed
[39:49] I may not have a lot of it but I know
[39:51] that works because his faith declared
[39:55] that
[39:57] in Isaiah and first Peter I believe it
[40:00] is and so when we take our little bit of
[40:03] faith and we put it into his faith then
[40:07] the all the promises become available to
[40:11] us because it's not it's no longer our
[40:13] faith it's not my faith anymore
[40:16] it's not your faith only that we're
[40:19] putting our faith into his faith
[40:22] and when we do that then every promise
[40:26] in the book becomes available
[40:29] everything that he that Christ was and
[40:32] ever will be we're a part of it if we
[40:35] have received Jesus Christ then we
[40:37] receive not only the name of Jesus
[40:40] Christ in that sense but we receive the
[40:43] faith of Jesus Christ
[40:45] and with the faith of Jesus Christ
[40:48] all things are possible
[40:51] because it becomes his faith and he said
[40:54] hey we can ask what we will and you can
[40:56] have it
[40:57] might be a little request might be a big
[41:00] request doesn't matter we've talked you
[41:02] know that that scripture uh if you say
[41:05] to this mountain be thou removed and
[41:07] cast into the sea and a lot of times
[41:09] where we know we're looking and waiting
[41:11] for the big mountain to move but excuse
[41:14] me I got something stuck in there
[41:17] but uh brother Brandon told us sometimes
[41:19] it's just it might just be one grain of
[41:22] sand
[41:23] you know on tomorrow another grain and
[41:25] another grain and another grain until
[41:28] eventually it's gone it's just not there
[41:31] anymore and God uses a space of time for
[41:35] all of these kind of things we in that
[41:37] uh Ecclesiastes it says there's a time
[41:40] and a season for everything and he says
[41:42] a time for this a time for that a time
[41:45] of this a time of that going through
[41:47] Ecclesiastes there so we understand that
[41:50] with the fall
[41:52] came not only death
[41:54] because the day you eat thereof you
[41:56] shall die
[41:58] but we I tend to you know for a long
[42:00] time I tended to overlook the fact that
[42:02] in the day
[42:04] you shall die
[42:06] a thousand years is but a day in the
[42:08] eyes of God
[42:10] so when they ate of the you know when
[42:12] they partook of that unbelief as it were
[42:16] and had the she had Eve had the
[42:18] experience with the unbeliever and uh
[42:24] that put them into the law of time
[42:28] thousand years and the you know he said
[42:32] in the day ye thereof ye shall die no
[42:35] one lived Beyond a thousand years from
[42:37] that time on
[42:39] we know Enoch escaped I'll put it that
[42:42] way escaped
[42:43] having to die
[42:45] but even Enoch only went to the place
[42:48] where the uh I can't remember which
[42:50] message it is but even Enoch didn't go
[42:52] straight into the heavenlies he couldn't
[42:54] go there until Christ was resurrected
[42:56] and that's when it was lift up your
[42:58] heads or your Gates and so forth and
[43:00] brother Branham said that Enoch was with
[43:02] that group following Jesus into that
[43:05] Heavenly City he only got from you know
[43:07] point a to the where the Believers went
[43:10] in those days but he escaped death for
[43:13] that matter and so we look at this and
[43:17] we realize it's by faith
[43:20] you know by faith we receive our
[43:24] circumcision which is the killing of the
[43:27] flesh
[43:28] and so it's not in the natural
[43:30] circumcision because he said it's not
[43:32] that you know justified by circumcision
[43:35] and and uncircumcision it's the faith
[43:38] that does the circumcising or the
[43:40] getting rid of the flesh
[43:42] it's not always easy
[43:45] in fact sometimes it's rather rough
[43:47] because we were born in this stuff and
[43:51] being born in this stuff we have
[43:55] become very closely associated with our
[43:57] first husband
[43:59] and
[44:00] we know that the birth order was changed
[44:02] instead of it being you know from the
[44:04] mind of God he spoke and said let us
[44:06] make man in our image and it was from
[44:08] the mind of God to the word of God to an
[44:10] atom and then then after that Adam was
[44:13] put in the flesh and were taken from the
[44:16] dust and then after that Eve is taken
[44:19] from Adam
[44:21] as
[44:23] we know these things and so
[44:27] the birth order was changed when she had
[44:30] the affair with the serpent because now
[44:32] the the first thing that comes about is
[44:35] the flesh through the the contact the
[44:37] male male and female the baby begins to
[44:40] form in the womb after that we've heard
[44:43] of course from the message that brother
[44:44] random and we know it to be true I've
[44:47] seen very seen it happen where the woman
[44:50] gets a really sweet Spirit about her in
[44:52] the you know a few days sometimes a few
[44:54] weeks before she delivers the baby
[44:56] because instead instead of it being you
[45:00] know from word to Spirit to flesh now
[45:02] it's flesh and then the spirit is
[45:03] waiting to take go into that baby and
[45:07] then when it comes forth it becomes a
[45:09] living soul
[45:10] well the living soul that it becomes is
[45:13] according to the first husband which is
[45:15] after the flesh
[45:16] that's why we have problems
[45:19] and we know that
[45:21] again there in Romans I I don't think I
[45:24] wrote it down but it talks about the
[45:28] the uh the woman and how that she's
[45:31] bound to the first husband as long as
[45:34] he's alive but if the husband is dead
[45:35] then she's free to marry another
[45:38] you're familiar with these scriptures
[45:40] right okay so that she and so what's it
[45:43] really talking about is
[45:46] that as long as we're bound to the first
[45:48] husband we're stuck
[45:51] but if the first husband's dad
[45:54] then we're free to marry and it even
[45:57] says there in in that scripture that
[45:58] says only in Christ
[46:01] because we're free to marry marry or
[46:04] become bride of Jesus Christ
[46:06] we are we become when we receive Jesus
[46:09] Christ
[46:11] the flesh is dying it's dead in fact
[46:14] officially if you want to look at it
[46:17] that way from God's word it's dead the
[46:19] minute you receive Jesus Christ amen
[46:21] finished done in his eyes
[46:24] but we have different eyes because we
[46:27] came the other way
[46:29] and so we you know I I used to kind of
[46:32] run back and forth with
[46:35] but I remember one time
[46:37] with repenting about things and I
[46:41] you know being in a lot of meetings
[46:42] around different places in the world I
[46:45] I hear preachers preaching and good
[46:48] messages but they hold prayer line after
[46:50] prayer line and some people like they're
[46:52] coming up for salvation every prayer
[46:54] line and it's like no
[46:55] no that's not it I received Jesus Christ
[46:58] the first time
[47:00] in his word if we believe his word he
[47:03] said lo I Am With You Always even until
[47:05] the end of the world
[47:07] and again he said I'll never leave you
[47:09] or forsake you you say but oh man I do
[47:12] such bad stuff and if I make my bed in
[47:14] hell he's still there to pull me out
[47:18] because
[47:20] that's God
[47:21] and that's where we put our faith
[47:24] so then he comes to this next verse he
[47:27] says do we then make void the law
[47:30] through faith
[47:31] and that's an interesting question
[47:33] because
[47:34] once we receive Jesus Christ he overcame
[47:37] the law every single law done finished
[47:42] we are no longer under the Old Testament
[47:45] law per se
[47:48] but the law he said when he makes this
[47:51] statement
[47:52] do we make the law make void the law
[47:55] through faith
[47:57] and he says God forbid
[48:00] we don't make that law void and back in
[48:04] Romans 7 and 14 it says the law is
[48:08] spiritual
[48:10] for we know that the law is spiritual
[48:12] but I'm carnal Soul under sin so he's
[48:14] telling us
[48:16] we we came into this world with this
[48:19] fleshly man and this carnal stuff
[48:22] and we've been fighting with the laws of
[48:25] the the all these natural laws because
[48:27] of this flesh that's under the natural
[48:29] law but the law itself is spiritual and
[48:32] so if this law is spiritual that we
[48:35] serve we serve a different law and he
[48:38] said so we
[48:40] he said do we make the law of none
[48:42] effect and he said God forbid what's he
[48:44] talking about
[48:45] for those that have received Jesus
[48:49] Christ
[48:50] we are dead to the law
[48:53] he fulfilled the law done over with he
[48:58] fulfilled every portion of the law
[49:02] and that law is dead in fact it says he
[49:05] became sin
[49:07] for you and us he paid the entire and
[49:10] complete penalty for sin done it's a
[49:14] finished deal and when we receive him we
[49:16] receive the potential the fullness of
[49:19] that into our soul our soul becomes by
[49:24] faith
[49:25] circumcised
[49:27] unto the law because the law is
[49:29] spiritual and the faith circumcises us
[49:34] to where that we can receive the
[49:36] covenants of Abraham
[49:38] Abraham
[49:40] your seed will possess the gates of its
[49:42] enemies
[49:43] Abraham you're going to be like you know
[49:47] sand of the sea all the different
[49:49] promises that came to Abraham so what
[49:53] he's saying there God forbid that the
[49:56] law because the law is spiritual but
[49:58] also that law does not stop
[50:03] in fact it's so much in effect not for
[50:07] the Believers because we have a way out
[50:09] we have been circumcised under the law
[50:13] through Jesus Christ into a spiritual
[50:17] law of
[50:19] all things all promises are mine
[50:21] everything that Christ had is available
[50:24] to you and available to me but the law
[50:27] is still in effect so much so that we
[50:29] had a prophet's message
[50:31] and in the the uh divisions of 1933 what
[50:36] you know everybody's talking here a
[50:38] couple years ago about oh uh sixth
[50:41] division fulfilled the woman in purple
[50:42] all those things we knew it was coming
[50:46] had to come
[50:47] and the things that go along with that
[50:52] but at the seventh Vision was ashes all
[50:56] across the land of America why is that
[50:59] because the law is still in effect
[51:03] and because of the denominational world
[51:06] and the
[51:08] the world in general
[51:11] the law was that a harlot should be
[51:13] stoned and burned with fire
[51:15] and she will be
[51:17] because the law is still in effect so he
[51:20] says God forbid
[51:22] but
[51:26] he said yea we establish the law and if
[51:30] you notice between where he says God
[51:32] forbid and Yea we establish the law
[51:34] there's those two little two little dots
[51:36] there that when brother Branham preached
[51:39] uh
[51:41] this day the scripture is fulfilled he
[51:43] gave us a cute not cute that's not the
[51:46] right word I'm sorry but uh just some
[51:49] insight
[51:51] into what those two dots represent many
[51:53] many many times in the scripture that's
[51:56] a time space
[51:58] so there's a time space he's saying no
[52:01] the Law's not done with way with
[52:04] God forbid we did away with it because
[52:06] it's going to be carried out all the way
[52:07] to the end
[52:09] but for the Believers we have overcome
[52:11] the law through Jesus Christ
[52:15] and so he makes this statement God
[52:17] forbid yea we establish the law
[52:24] what is that to you and me
[52:27] what is that particular
[52:31] course there
[52:33] we establish the law not by the doing of
[52:38] the Old Testament law
[52:40] but by the overcoming of the Old
[52:42] Testament law through Jesus Christ when
[52:44] people look at us
[52:47] we are establishing the law because when
[52:50] we get hurt we say with his stripes I'm
[52:52] Healed
[52:54] when we
[52:55] have problems in life where do we turn
[52:58] we turn back to the scripture that
[53:02] represents Jesus Christ in the beginning
[53:03] we turn back to the word in the
[53:06] beginning was the word the word was with
[53:07] God and the Word was God
[53:10] so we establish the law we become the
[53:13] signpost
[53:15] of the law and the Fulfillment thereof
[53:18] through Jesus Christ
[53:21] that should make us pretty happy
[53:24] because when people look at it they
[53:27] can't see that Old Testament law I mean
[53:29] there's a few Jews in in
[53:32] Israel that they try to keep that I mean
[53:35] Paul was just over there and Jerry and
[53:37] and there's certain Jews those Orthodox
[53:39] and they're trying oh man they try to
[53:41] keep that Old Testament law most of the
[53:44] world doesn't know that even exists
[53:45] hardly the primary for the Gentiles like
[53:48] like president said we were we were
[53:50] walking around the club over our back
[53:53] we didn't have any desire to do the law
[53:56] that those guys are into so
[53:59] the law that we express or that we
[54:02] establish as we receive Christ into our
[54:06] lives and we begin to magnify his name
[54:10] magnify his word because there's certain
[54:13] things we just don't do anymore or
[54:16] shouldn't do anymore if you do quick
[54:19] repentance is the best way to get back
[54:21] we heard that too
[54:23] and so we established the law so that
[54:26] when the world is looking for they know
[54:28] there's a law of God out there somewhere
[54:30] most of them and and I've got to talk to
[54:33] many people you know said well you know
[54:36] what's the first law and Emily said God
[54:39] wrote a a law in the sky
[54:43] about and it points us to Jesus Christ
[54:45] there's the Virgin birth the line of the
[54:47] tribe Vegeta a Judah there's the the
[54:49] judge over there with Libra there's you
[54:52] know
[54:54] and so they know there's a law there and
[54:56] they know there's laws in nature in fact
[54:57] all the scientists and stuff are
[54:59] study into these laws and even the
[55:01] things they've come up with in genetics
[55:03] and stuff over these last few years they
[55:06] know there's laws there and they're
[55:08] trying to break into those laws
[55:10] the laws of life
[55:13] but the law of life is Jesus Christ
[55:17] so when they look at us we may look a
[55:19] little crazy we might look a little
[55:21] ragged but we establish the law
[55:25] or the fulfilling of the law in our
[55:28] lives through Jesus Christ
[55:31] for certain
[55:32] [Laughter]
[55:35] I just had to do that brother Paul
[55:39] and that's one of the first messages
[55:41] we've preached there in a long time they
[55:43] said keep going on this
[55:45] so we you know but uh
[55:48] so we become the what people are looking
[55:51] at they they don't know it because it's
[55:54] unseen but when they see you they see
[55:57] the Fulfillment of the law through Jesus
[55:59] Christ
[56:01] so we become the we establish the law
[56:05] so then we read there from
[56:08] Leviticus
[56:10] I love the Lord
[56:15] and in this particular place
[56:17] uh
[56:19] where he's talking there in Leviticus we
[56:22] know it's talking to the priests and
[56:24] such and laying out the sacrifices and
[56:28] telling them how you know this sacrifice
[56:30] is for this and that sacrifice and all
[56:33] those things in his Leviticus I started
[56:35] at seven verse 1 and he talks about uh
[56:38] likewise this is the law of the trespass
[56:40] offering It's the Most Holy
[56:44] there's a whole lot of laws and
[56:45] sacrifices and stuff they did you know I
[56:47] believe it was a dove or a pigeon for
[56:50] healing and they had and a different one
[56:52] for leprosy and and all those things but
[56:55] this one he said is the most holy
[56:59] who we we know immediately it's talking
[57:01] about Jesus Christ because he alone is
[57:04] the most holy
[57:05] so as we begin to look at this and we
[57:08] think about establishing the law how
[57:10] does these law
[57:11] establish how do we establish this law
[57:14] because we're here to establish this
[57:18] right
[57:20] so this is talking about Jesus Christ
[57:22] and it tells him you know he's It's the
[57:25] Most Holy one and it tells them where
[57:28] they kill it and how to sprinkle the
[57:30] blood round about the Altar and of
[57:32] course we know it's talking about the
[57:34] altars of our hearts and uh
[57:37] and he comes down and he tells them how
[57:39] it's going to be divided up and
[57:41] everybody has to have a bite
[57:44] and then after they get that after they
[57:47] have received of the sacrifice they burn
[57:50] it with fire
[57:51] that's why we get justification
[57:53] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[57:57] Ghost
[58:00] there's a scripture that tells us that
[58:02] whosoever calleth on the name of the
[58:04] Lord will be saved amen
[58:07] because it says it but that doesn't mean
[58:09] they're full of the Holy Ghost
[58:12] and it doesn't mean they're a member of
[58:13] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:15] it just for whatever amount of Jesus
[58:17] Christ they received it was enough to
[58:19] obtain eternal life
[58:21] whoever calleth on me all noise and cast
[58:24] out I will but that doesn't mean
[58:28] that they're going to be those that are
[58:30] in the holy city of the Bride of Jesus
[58:33] Christ
[58:34] so here he gives them this sacrifice and
[58:37] tells them how to divide it how to eat
[58:39] it and then he mentions also that
[58:41] trespass offering and mentioned again in
[58:43] verse six it's also the most holy
[58:47] and is he
[58:49] begins to talk about this
[58:52] and he says the priest in verse 8 the
[58:54] priest that offers any man's burnt
[58:57] offering even the priest shall have to
[58:59] himself the skin of the burnt offering
[59:03] which he hath offered
[59:06] this is where
[59:08] I almost start wanting to jump up and
[59:10] down
[59:11] because
[59:13] in this it's giving a description
[59:16] of Jesus Christ becoming the most holy
[59:19] offering to get rid of sin and
[59:21] trespasses
[59:23] and how that that offering would be
[59:26] divided and Jesus on the night that he
[59:28] was betrayed it said he took bread and
[59:30] he began to divide the bread to his
[59:34] disciples
[59:35] and likewise manner he took the cup and
[59:38] he had them to drink and he said this is
[59:40] the New Testament of my blood it was the
[59:43] changing
[59:45] of the law of that Old Testament law
[59:49] into the New Testament law in which we
[59:53] become those who establish it
[59:55] but as
[59:58] they're going through this and everyone
[1:00:00] had to be a partaker of that sacrifice
[1:00:02] and then they would take the take the
[1:00:04] remnants thereof and they would run it
[1:00:07] outside and uh
[1:00:10] outside the gate and outside the gate
[1:00:13] they would burn the sacrifice and then
[1:00:15] the priest would take before he left the
[1:00:18] the sanctuary though he had to change
[1:00:20] his garment
[1:00:22] and when he would change His Garment and
[1:00:25] then he would take up these ashes and he
[1:00:27] would go out beyond the gate
[1:00:30] and Beyond the gate he would take those
[1:00:33] ashes and he would sprinkle them
[1:00:36] somewhere out in the wilderness wherever
[1:00:38] they had you know a special place for
[1:00:41] the ashes I mean the first place I love
[1:00:43] brother job
[1:00:45] where did he go when he was uh
[1:00:47] having his problem he went to the ash
[1:00:49] Heap
[1:00:51] because it was the only thing he had
[1:00:53] left that he knew he had met God's
[1:00:56] commandment
[1:00:59] he didn't have anything else left he
[1:01:01] didn't have another lamb or cow to
[1:01:03] sacrifice because the devil took it all
[1:01:05] he didn't even have any family left to
[1:01:08] hey man can you loan me 10 bucks so I
[1:01:10] can buy a lamb
[1:01:12] because God took that too I mean Satan
[1:01:14] took it from him God allowed it
[1:01:17] and so where did he go he went to the
[1:01:19] only place he had left to where he could
[1:01:22] where he sat down on that ass sheep and
[1:01:25] when he's on the ash sheep what's he
[1:01:27] doing he's scraping his sores
[1:01:30] with a broken vessel
[1:01:33] he's scraping himself with Jesus Christ
[1:01:36] he is our broken vessel
[1:01:39] and so here he is on the ash sheep he's
[1:01:41] doing that but now back to this and so
[1:01:43] the priest says that he goes out and
[1:01:45] such well then when the priest comes
[1:01:49] back
[1:01:51] and
[1:01:53] I can't remember if there's another
[1:01:55] place where it says he changes his
[1:01:56] garment again or not might be uh
[1:01:59] Leviticus 9 but uh
[1:02:02] yeah don't
[1:02:04] after that when it's all said and done
[1:02:08] everybody's gone home blood's on the
[1:02:11] altar Spirit of the Lord came down they
[1:02:14] did all their Duty
[1:02:16] and the high priest is getting ready to
[1:02:19] leave the sanctuary and go home
[1:02:23] who's the high priest
[1:02:26] Jesus Christ so the high priest has just
[1:02:31] offered himself or as we would say his
[1:02:33] son on the altar
[1:02:37] and now that that lamb that was slain
[1:02:42] you know they take it and when he's
[1:02:43] talking about how they divide it all up
[1:02:45] the first thing they do is they scrape
[1:02:46] the skin off
[1:02:48] throw it over on a chair somewhere I
[1:02:50] don't know what they did with it but
[1:02:51] they throw it over there somewhere and
[1:02:53] it lays there until all this other stuff
[1:02:55] is done
[1:02:56] and after all that stuff is done this
[1:02:59] priest comes back looks out okay people
[1:03:01] are going home they're rejoicing
[1:03:03] whatever their whatever's going on and
[1:03:06] the priest is getting ready to go home
[1:03:09] he goes over and he picks up that skin
[1:03:13] throws it over his shoulder because the
[1:03:16] Bible says it's his
[1:03:19] are you with me
[1:03:21] and the high priest
[1:03:23] takes the skin and goes home
[1:03:29] do you love him
[1:03:32] the high priest gets the skin
[1:03:36] he's the one that made the sacrifice
[1:03:39] by his word
[1:03:41] following the law
[1:03:44] he follows the law he does what the word
[1:03:48] says
[1:03:50] but where he changed the Garment before
[1:03:52] he went out so where does that fit the
[1:03:54] picture
[1:03:56] and we fast forward
[1:04:00] to the time of Jesus Christ when he's on
[1:04:02] Earth and he's gone to Calvary and
[1:04:07] it was a terrible terrible thing for in
[1:04:11] our eyes of what happened but it was the
[1:04:15] high priest
[1:04:16] allowing those High priests to sacrifice
[1:04:22] the perfect lamb
[1:04:24] because the highest judge in the land
[1:04:27] said I find no fault in him he was
[1:04:29] judged absolutely perfect
[1:04:34] and with that condition he could be
[1:04:36] crucified he could become under the law
[1:04:40] the perfect sacrifice the most holy
[1:04:45] sacrifice
[1:04:47] well we know what happened he died
[1:04:49] that body died and I know there are some
[1:04:53] people out there they say that Jesus
[1:04:54] couldn't be God because he died
[1:04:56] well I always ask the question then who
[1:04:58] in the world
[1:05:00] the Bible says Jesus Christ was speaking
[1:05:02] to the whole to the souls that were in
[1:05:04] prison
[1:05:06] there's a part there that never died you
[1:05:08] better get the word
[1:05:10] the word never died
[1:05:14] it was a fulfilling of the word well
[1:05:18] then when he he comes on the scene he
[1:05:20] raises you know the and he brings with
[1:05:22] him those other uh dead Saints out of
[1:05:25] that area and they they arise with him
[1:05:28] in fact the Bible said they were even
[1:05:30] seen after the resurrection
[1:05:32] around the city
[1:05:34] they could be witnessed
[1:05:38] as fulfilling
[1:05:40] the law
[1:05:42] or establishing the law because they
[1:05:46] died under their sacrifices and under
[1:05:49] those things you can find this in
[1:05:51] Hebrews 12 or 11.
[1:05:53] and it says they wandered about in
[1:05:55] sheepskins and goat skins and of whom
[1:05:58] the world was not worthy I love that set
[1:06:00] of scriptures oh man
[1:06:02] where'd they get the sheepskins and the
[1:06:04] Goat skins
[1:06:07] hello you understand
[1:06:10] So it's talking about and when those
[1:06:12] people came up on that Resurrection Day
[1:06:15] they walked about so that they could
[1:06:19] show the people that they established
[1:06:22] the law they became
[1:06:25] the law of the Resurrection through
[1:06:28] Jesus Christ
[1:06:32] so
[1:06:35] and Jesus when he comes out of the Tomb
[1:06:37] the first thing one of the first things
[1:06:38] that happens there uh you know the
[1:06:42] I believe it was Mary
[1:06:44] one of the Mary's
[1:06:46] she you know she goes to the tomb and
[1:06:48] she's crying in wherever you because
[1:06:50] they look she looks in the Tomb and the
[1:06:52] the stones rolled away and she's looking
[1:06:54] in there and
[1:06:55] where have you laid my Lord because
[1:06:57] there's a man standing there she thinks
[1:06:59] it's the gardener
[1:07:03] and
[1:07:04] she said where have you laid him I'll
[1:07:06] I'll take care of him
[1:07:10] and when she hears the voice of the
[1:07:14] gardener
[1:07:17] she said she knew it was Jesus
[1:07:22] the priest had changed the Garment
[1:07:25] and come forth but he tells her I've not
[1:07:28] yet ascended to the father that the
[1:07:31] sacrifice has been has been accepted
[1:07:35] but the very next
[1:07:37] portion
[1:07:38] he appears to the disciples he says okay
[1:07:41] now stick your fingers in my hands
[1:07:44] in my side
[1:07:46] because what happened
[1:07:48] after he went before the holy altar the
[1:07:52] most holy altar the fire of God
[1:07:56] he came back
[1:07:59] as the high priest of our confession
[1:08:03] and picked up the skin
[1:08:05] and put it on
[1:08:08] because those Old Testament
[1:08:11] priests and judges and all those things
[1:08:13] what did they use the skin for
[1:08:15] oftentimes
[1:08:17] well they didn't have paper like we have
[1:08:20] they would take a little chisel and a
[1:08:22] hammer and some ink and they would lay
[1:08:24] those skins out and you know they had
[1:08:26] different processes for keeping them and
[1:08:28] they would chisel the word of God
[1:08:31] into the skins
[1:08:36] and that's and then they would roll them
[1:08:38] into like the Scrolls we talk about the
[1:08:40] Seven Seals and stuff
[1:08:43] the wood was chiseled
[1:08:46] and job said it well though my words
[1:08:49] were written
[1:08:51] with an iron pin
[1:08:54] in the rock forever
[1:08:57] it's all Jesus Christ
[1:09:00] and how that
[1:09:02] the high priest went and picked up his
[1:09:04] to prove that I am the high priest now
[1:09:08] and he put that skin on and the next
[1:09:11] time they saw it he goes okay see this
[1:09:13] kid
[1:09:15] showing that he had established or
[1:09:18] fulfilled the entire law through Jesus
[1:09:21] Christ
[1:09:22] so if we establish the law
[1:09:26] what is our part of this
[1:09:31] the skin we know then ascended on high
[1:09:35] and he
[1:09:37] broke up the sacrifice as it were and to
[1:09:40] pour it back out to us as the Holy Ghost
[1:09:44] Genesis 49 I think it's eight
[1:09:47] said he became the resting lion who's
[1:09:50] our rest the Holy Ghost
[1:09:53] fire of God becomes our rest and so
[1:09:57] he pours out the Holy Spirit or the fire
[1:10:01] to get rid of this flesh
[1:10:05] that we're living in
[1:10:08] because the entire penalty for sin is
[1:10:10] done it's finished and when we receive
[1:10:13] that fire of God in us it is the Bible
[1:10:17] says our God is a consuming fire
[1:10:21] and he consumes when he comes into us
[1:10:23] that's why sometimes
[1:10:26] I don't know about you guys but I've had
[1:10:29] a few struggles here
[1:10:31] in my life
[1:10:32] and I just you know you feel like you're
[1:10:34] getting almost burned up or ripped up or
[1:10:36] whatever it is and it's because the Holy
[1:10:39] Ghost Fire is burning you know it's like
[1:10:43] today we were talking a little bit and
[1:10:44] it's like man it's like one thing after
[1:10:46] another this happened that happened this
[1:10:48] happened that happened
[1:10:50] I they started to say what's next and I
[1:10:53] go I don't want to know
[1:10:56] well what is that it's those trials and
[1:10:59] those Temptations to help burn up or
[1:11:01] burn the old
[1:11:03] man out of us
[1:11:06] that we can rule and reign with Jesus
[1:11:08] Christ
[1:11:09] because he's not going to have a bride
[1:11:11] that does not have his same character
[1:11:16] it's not you know we use the term
[1:11:19] Cakewalk
[1:11:21] no
[1:11:23] we have to have the same character
[1:11:25] because we're of the same sacrificial
[1:11:30] offering
[1:11:31] when we receive Jesus Christ and when we
[1:11:33] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:11:36] then he can take us and begin to
[1:11:38] establish the law
[1:11:41] in my life but there's another part
[1:11:43] because we get ready to close here
[1:11:48] and in this other part what
[1:11:51] the skin that skin there okay that he
[1:11:54] you know he that shows that he became
[1:11:56] the high priest of our profession you
[1:11:58] send it on high and shows that he was
[1:12:02] the Fulfillment of the law and now he
[1:12:04] pours that Holy Ghost back into us so
[1:12:07] that we can
[1:12:08] be part of him and it says we become
[1:12:12] part of Jesus Christ
[1:12:14] who has fulfilled the law therefore we
[1:12:18] can establish the law through Jesus
[1:12:20] Christ or let people look and say well
[1:12:22] who do you think you are well
[1:12:25] my name is David Nash but I'm
[1:12:26] establishing the law whether you like it
[1:12:28] or not because I received Jesus Christ
[1:12:32] and it becomes so powerful that
[1:12:37] he said you can have what you ask for
[1:12:39] and I I don't claim this as a
[1:12:42] you know people are always looking for
[1:12:44] testimonies and and stuff and
[1:12:47] but one time I was treated very roughly
[1:12:51] by a bank and you know a little bit
[1:12:54] maybe like Elisha who called for the
[1:12:56] Bears when I walked out of the bank
[1:12:58] I just kicked the uh
[1:13:01] the railing nice fancy building nice big
[1:13:04] place I kicked the railing and my wife
[1:13:07] is sitting in the car she goes why'd you
[1:13:08] do that
[1:13:10] I said what do you think she goes you
[1:13:12] kick the dust of your heels against that
[1:13:13] place
[1:13:14] I said you're right and then I began to
[1:13:16] explain what they did
[1:13:18] she goes wow
[1:13:20] I don't remember how many years but it
[1:13:22] was a fair amount of years later I went
[1:13:25] back to that particular City
[1:13:28] and I had heard briefly after that that
[1:13:31] bank had basically gone bankrupt and
[1:13:34] been bought out by another bank
[1:13:36] but when I went back a few years later
[1:13:38] than that tenant maybe 10 or 12 years I
[1:13:40] don't remember exactly
[1:13:42] the place where that bank stood was a
[1:13:45] big Downtown parking lot
[1:13:47] full of bums
[1:13:53] doing the things that defecating and
[1:13:56] throwing up and broken bottles
[1:14:00] God doesn't take it lightly
[1:14:03] he establishes us as the law
[1:14:07] and whether I was you know well what
[1:14:09] would your uh you know father forgive
[1:14:12] him it wasn't in my heart that time
[1:14:15] it just wasn't there
[1:14:17] I had a need and they
[1:14:19] basically kicked me out
[1:14:23] and
[1:14:24] so
[1:14:26] Our Lives friends are establishing the
[1:14:28] law and sometimes
[1:14:31] no brother Branham in one place he said
[1:14:33] there will be people that make it simply
[1:14:35] because they were kind to you
[1:14:37] and there's different ones when I look
[1:14:39] through my life to where I just go Lord
[1:14:42] God
[1:14:44] don't let that one go
[1:14:46] I know they're never going to see
[1:14:49] what I see
[1:14:51] brother Branham talked about his
[1:14:53] neighbor and he said he stood for me he
[1:14:55] goes don't go over there and go
[1:14:56] bothering him
[1:14:57] he goes they stood for me I'll stand for
[1:14:59] them
[1:15:00] that's the power
[1:15:03] that we have with God
[1:15:05] but at the same token we have the power
[1:15:08] to condemn that Harlot to be burned with
[1:15:12] fire
[1:15:14] so I said we were going to close with
[1:15:16] this
[1:15:17] so we become his skin
[1:15:23] when the high priest left and he took
[1:15:26] that skin and he became Jesus Christ the
[1:15:29] high priest of our confession and when
[1:15:31] he pours himself into us it's no longer
[1:15:35] our skin
[1:15:38] we become purchased products if I can
[1:15:41] use that word of Jesus Christ we're not
[1:15:44] ourselves it says somewhere in the
[1:15:47] scripture I'm sure we're not our own
[1:15:50] we are his
[1:15:52] we are his to do to be whatever he wants
[1:15:58] us to be
[1:16:01] there's a few times where I had
[1:16:04] scratched my head and went Lord I know
[1:16:06] the Potter's not supposed to say that
[1:16:09] the clay or you know the clay is not
[1:16:10] supposed to say to the Potter but do I
[1:16:13] have to do this
[1:16:16] but we're his skin
[1:16:18] and he says and he guides us and he
[1:16:21] leads us to certain people and and
[1:16:24] because he is seeking the fullness of
[1:16:27] his body and the fullness
[1:16:29] of the establishing of the law
[1:16:33] and there's another benefit to that
[1:16:36] when we're sick
[1:16:38] we can say Lord
[1:16:43] an enemy hath done this and I'm sick or
[1:16:45] hurt or an enemy hath given me this
[1:16:49] bill you ever get you know you're pretty
[1:16:51] flushed with things and all of a sudden
[1:16:52] you're
[1:16:54] one trip to the doctor's office or
[1:16:56] whatever and you're now you're 30 000
[1:16:57] ducks in the hole here well
[1:17:02] but because we're his skin
[1:17:06] we can say Lord
[1:17:09] didn't you pay for this
[1:17:11] Lord I know you paid for this and we can
[1:17:15] go before
[1:17:17] Throne of God and ask what we will
[1:17:21] because it's paid for
[1:17:23] and because his skin has now become
[1:17:27] our skin
[1:17:29] and we are entitled to it when we are
[1:17:33] burned with fire
[1:17:35] by faith and the flesh has been cut away
[1:17:39] doesn't matter as far as the natural
[1:17:42] circumcision or uncircumcision is the
[1:17:44] circumcision he says in another place of
[1:17:47] our hearts
[1:17:48] and if our hearts have that first
[1:17:51] husband killed and dead
[1:17:54] you got every right to every promise
[1:17:59] according to God's word because we
[1:18:01] become his skin
[1:18:09] the priest went home
[1:18:13] you understand we have a right
[1:18:16] to walk off of this world
[1:18:19] because now we are the manifestation of
[1:18:22] the law and he said I am the
[1:18:24] resurrection
[1:18:25] and I am the life
[1:18:27] for a Christian it's an absolute win-win
[1:18:30] deal
[1:18:31] because we now in this skin which is
[1:18:34] becoming his skin
[1:18:37] we can say and one day
[1:18:40] we will some of us have already gone to
[1:18:43] the what we call the grave grave was
[1:18:46] your Victory grave where's the sting
[1:18:48] death where's your sting
[1:18:50] well it doesn't matter
[1:18:52] they are fulfilling that part
[1:18:55] of the law
[1:18:57] the resurrection
[1:18:59] and for those of us who are still around
[1:19:02] at the particular time or moment or say
[1:19:05] the right thing however it works
[1:19:10] you can just cross over without going
[1:19:15] because he said so
[1:19:17] you love him
[1:19:19] God bless you thank you tonight
[1:19:23] Let's uh that's created me a clean heart
[1:19:27] see I was actually thinking about
[1:19:29] speaking something else in the very
[1:19:30] first line I have there's Psalms 51 10
[1:19:34] created me a clean heart when brother
[1:19:37] Alex started singing that song I'm going
[1:19:39] hmm I kept trying to get away from these
[1:19:42] pages I flipped back and there it was
[1:19:45] again and I thought oh my
[1:19:48] well your proper gift Alex thank you God
[1:19:52] bless you
[1:19:57] let's just stand for this
[1:20:02] and he's speaking actually there of
[1:20:04] another law when he says create in me
[1:20:06] because that's another law
[1:20:09] started out in the beginning God created
[1:20:13] and he is creating an end
[1:20:15] by his establishing the law he's proving
[1:20:20] the law of creation
[1:20:22] I mean it goes on and on that's what we
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:26] um
[1:20:29] creating me a clean heart
[1:20:36] oh God
[1:20:42] Spirit
[1:20:44] Within Me
[1:20:50] creating
[1:20:51] me a clean
[1:20:55] heart oh
[1:20:58] oh God
[1:21:01] and renew our right Spirit
[1:21:06] Within Me
[1:21:11] has
[1:21:15] it from thy presence
[1:21:23] [Applause]
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:29] please
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:38] the joy of the Salvation
[1:21:45] and renew our rights
[1:21:53] for we sing it once more and I hand it
[1:21:56] back to Alex or brother Paul
[1:21:59] we were
[1:22:00] just in Peru recently and uh
[1:22:05] I don't think brother Paul I'm a
[1:22:07] convention preacher I just
[1:22:10] I prefer going out Village The Village
[1:22:13] out in the bush that's just just me
[1:22:16] because you wind up sitting and all this
[1:22:18] stuff but they did something at the end
[1:22:20] of their convention I was really
[1:22:22] impressed and I got into it
[1:22:25] they decided for the very last service
[1:22:27] on Sunday night that
[1:22:31] I've heard brother Brannon mention this
[1:22:33] but I'd never seen it done before
[1:22:35] he said well if you're gonna do
[1:22:37] testimonies and that kind of stuff he
[1:22:39] said you should have a special service
[1:22:41] set aside for it
[1:22:43] well brother
[1:22:46] Gayton they did that the Sunday night
[1:22:49] service was just for songs specials
[1:22:53] testimonies whatever
[1:22:55] and uh
[1:22:59] how the Holy Spirit comes when he begins
[1:23:01] building on things and you know some of
[1:23:04] them were testimonies about well Lord
[1:23:05] did this for me in the convention and
[1:23:07] others were all different kinds of
[1:23:09] testimonies then they'd sing a song and
[1:23:11] and instead of having it you know set up
[1:23:14] like we do here and how the convention
[1:23:16] had been set up they had all the chairs
[1:23:18] along the side so anybody could come out
[1:23:20] to the middle and they'd handle the mic
[1:23:22] and give their testimony and do
[1:23:24] something maybe be something for Camp
[1:23:26] rather because about halfway through
[1:23:29] that place started coming on glued
[1:23:32] hearing the testimonies within the songs
[1:23:36] of all the Believers before it was over
[1:23:40] the whole place was dancing
[1:23:43] and all the women it was not now I've
[1:23:45] seen a few dance place you know places
[1:23:46] where they said that was dancing in the
[1:23:48] spirit well I'm not sure what spirit
[1:23:50] that was
[1:23:51] but this was so orderly and so beautiful
[1:23:54] all the women were you know they we're
[1:23:58] in a big you know the men started in a
[1:24:00] little circle and praising the Lord and
[1:24:03] doing what they were doing and that
[1:24:04] Circle kept getting bigger and bigger as
[1:24:06] each one would join and
[1:24:09] then pretty soon with all the sisters
[1:24:12] were actually going in the opposite
[1:24:14] direction and as the brothers would walk
[1:24:17] by the sisters you know we'd either high
[1:24:18] five or shake hands and
[1:24:21] I just learned I've never seen this
[1:24:23] before but it was really beautiful and
[1:24:28] anyway God is God and we all have a
[1:24:32] testimony we all have a portion or a
[1:24:34] thing that's God that God's done for us
[1:24:36] and just remember those people down
[1:24:39] there we got invitations of course come
[1:24:41] back come back come to one of the most
[1:24:43] touching things for me
[1:24:45] I was struggling a lot because my normal
[1:24:49] interpreter couldn't get into the
[1:24:50] country
[1:24:51] so I was using Google translate a lot
[1:24:55] thank God for Google translate I don't
[1:24:57] know that I let much care about Google
[1:24:58] but I sure like to translate it up and
[1:25:01] uh
[1:25:03] so you know we were doing that but at
[1:25:08] the end of it there's a bunch of Inca
[1:25:10] people had come down out of the
[1:25:12] Himalayas and
[1:25:14] uh they stayed over
[1:25:17] Monday morning all day Monday they sang
[1:25:20] and continued testifying and singing and
[1:25:23] part way into Tuesday before they had to
[1:25:25] start catching buses or whatever to go
[1:25:27] home and one of the most touching things
[1:25:30] to me and
[1:25:32] was one of the Incas a couple of the
[1:25:35] Incas came up and just said brother come
[1:25:38] come to the mountains because what you
[1:25:40] said went straight to our hearts
[1:25:42] so I hope that's what God did for you
[1:25:44] tonight God bless you
[1:25:46] love you thank you Paul Jerry take care
[1:25:50] of that guy would you
