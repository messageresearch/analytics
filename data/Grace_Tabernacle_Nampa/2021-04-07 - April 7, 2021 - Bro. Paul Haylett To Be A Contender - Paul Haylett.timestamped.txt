[23:06] aren't you glad you can say amen to that
[23:09] my you know there's so many things in
[23:13] the world today
[23:14] you know i don't want to get sidetracked
[23:16] this evening but
[23:18] you know just as you
[23:21] attempt i guess you might say to follow
[23:24] what is happening in the world around us
[23:28] it is so amazing my brother and sister
[23:30] how that
[23:33] things are coming together as as
[23:36] prophesied as the word has declared it's
[23:38] just
[23:39] it's coming together and it's as though
[23:42] that
[23:42] they don't want to you read little
[23:45] excerpts leadership of different
[23:47] churches
[23:48] they say well we still feel like we have
[23:51] a great
[23:51] difference but we feel compelled to join
[23:55] together
[23:58] my you see the word of god
[24:01] will come to pass amen so they're
[24:04] anointed
[24:05] even against their own better judgments
[24:09] to to step into to be a part of to join
[24:12] in and
[24:13] and uh just wait till they cancel
[24:16] culture makes it to christianity
[24:21] it's coming they'll stand one day and
[24:24] say you're not even a christian
[24:30] yes that's all right
[24:35] because their definition of christianity
[24:38] is not our definition
[24:40] of christianity hallelujah
[24:43] amen you know i hope you can catch my
[24:47] thought here otherwise you're going to
[24:48] think i'm nuts
[24:49] but you know they say in business
[24:53] real estate investing and things like
[24:55] that go
[24:56] counter to the culture
[25:00] when everyone's buying sell and
[25:03] everyone's selling
[25:04] by now look at that bring that over into
[25:08] the world we live in today everyone's
[25:11] crying
[25:12] unity unity unity but the word speaking
[25:16] out to us
[25:17] i believe with all my heart the word
[25:18] speaking out to us saying come out of
[25:20] her my people
[25:21] it's not a time see we're uniting to
[25:24] christ it's not a time to
[25:26] unite in this world in a in a human
[25:30] uh unity and so he's saying come out of
[25:33] her and they're saying come together
[25:35] hallelujah oh thank you lord hallelujah
[25:39] sorry about my random thoughts amen
[25:42] let's just stand as we go into the word
[25:44] tonight
[25:45] just want to speak once again out of the
[25:47] book of proverbs these age-old proverbs
[25:50] i want to go to chapter 17.
[25:54] i want to just kind of draw a little bit
[25:56] of main emphasis that really struck me
[25:58] as i was reading this and i want to
[26:00] title this tonight to be a contender
[26:02] amen i believe that's what each and
[26:05] every one of us's hearts desire
[26:06] is is to be a contender it is
[26:10] interesting i'm going to take a little
[26:12] turn on these words after a bit here
[26:15] and just trust you can follow me tonight
[26:20] better is a dry morsel
[26:24] and quietness therewith than a house
[26:27] full of sacrifices
[26:29] with strife i think we can just stop and
[26:33] say
[26:33] amen to that one right there a wise
[26:37] servant shall have rule over a son that
[26:39] calls us shame
[26:41] and shall have part of the inheritance
[26:44] among the brethren the fining pot
[26:47] is for silver and the furnace for gold
[26:51] but the lord trieth the hearts
[26:55] a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips
[27:00] and a liar giveth ear to a naughty
[27:02] tongue
[27:04] who so mocketh the poor reproacheth his
[27:07] maker
[27:08] and he that is glad at calamities shall
[27:11] not be
[27:12] unpunished now i want to just
[27:15] make comment on verse 5 just real quick
[27:22] that verse strikes me very strongly
[27:24] because you see
[27:25] saints growing up
[27:28] people's representation of the message
[27:30] was anything but
[27:32] stellar
[27:36] just reminds me i had a good friend as a
[27:38] young boy
[27:39] his name was jonathan and jonathan's
[27:43] parents had kind of showed interest in
[27:44] the message until
[27:46] certain things happened and then they
[27:48] pushed back
[27:49] very very hard against the message
[27:53] i don't know that they were so opposed
[27:54] to the message but they were certainly
[27:56] opposed to the hypocrisy
[27:59] one day you see we grew up swimming in
[28:01] the in the low lying canal and
[28:04] now they don't you know even allow that
[28:06] they'll cite you for trespassing
[28:10] above what would be called the checks
[28:12] where's all these pipes
[28:14] at every check that would come out and
[28:16] water would go to
[28:17] irrigation and my friend jonathan
[28:21] one day while swimming with some friends
[28:24] they started floating down the canal
[28:26] and jonathan said hey i forgot something
[28:28] or whatever
[28:29] actually i think it was the keys to his
[28:31] pickup and and he said i'll be with you
[28:33] in a second but he never shows up
[28:36] his pickup's still there they can't find
[28:38] him ultimately they determined that
[28:41] jonathan had dove into the canal and
[28:44] hit one of those pipes directly and of
[28:47] course
[28:47] whatever it did to him you know caused
[28:49] him to drown
[28:52] and people in the church that i attended
[28:54] as a young man
[28:56] rose up and said that's god's punishment
[28:59] for them for not
[29:01] accepting the message
[29:05] god help us to never never
[29:08] never ever
[29:13] because you see that spirit won't stop
[29:15] with the unbeliever
[29:17] once they say this my brother and sister
[29:19] they say the cannibals
[29:21] will cannibalize their own when they
[29:24] fail to find someone
[29:26] else never ever ever let that spirit
[29:29] in our midst we know the word of god
[29:33] says things happen
[29:34] to the rich and to the poor to the
[29:36] righteous and to the unrighteous
[29:38] amen let's never allow that devil to
[29:42] come in
[29:42] and cause us to start thinking god did
[29:45] that to them
[29:46] because they didn't agree with us
[29:54] oh my
[29:58] a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips
[30:00] and a liar give
[30:01] ear to naughty tongue whoso market the
[30:04] poor reproacheth his maker and he that
[30:06] is glad at calamities
[30:08] shall not be unpunished children's
[30:12] children
[30:13] are the crown of old men and the glory
[30:16] of children are their fathers
[30:18] excellent speech becometh not a fool
[30:21] much lest do lying lips a prince
[30:25] a gift is as a precious stone in the
[30:28] eyes of him
[30:29] that hath it whithersoever it turneth
[30:33] it prospereth he that covereth a
[30:36] transgression
[30:37] seeketh love but he that
[30:40] repeateth a matter separateth very
[30:44] friends a reproof entereth more
[30:47] into a wise man than a hundred stripes
[30:51] unto a fool an evil man seeketh only
[30:55] rebellion therefore a cruel messenger
[30:58] shall be
[30:59] sent against him let a bear
[31:04] robbed of her whelps meet a man rather
[31:08] than a fool in his folly think about
[31:11] that when saints
[31:12] i might i've run into a bear one time in
[31:14] the woods fortunately it had a lot of
[31:16] other things on its mind
[31:18] and i'm telling you it's bear season and
[31:22] the bear was running popped out of the
[31:24] brush just a few feet
[31:26] in front of me and we both stopped and
[31:29] both of our eyes got really big
[31:31] and it ran away and i simply stood there
[31:34] in neutral and went
[31:39] i wouldn't want to be this and look at
[31:40] this a bear robbed of her welts meet a
[31:42] man rather than a fool in his folly
[31:45] that's pretty severe judgment in my mind
[31:48] amen whoso rewardeth evil for good evil
[31:52] shall not depart from his house the
[31:55] beginning of strife is as
[31:56] when one litteth out water therefore
[31:59] leave
[32:00] off contention before it be meddled
[32:03] with he that justifieth the wicked
[32:07] and he that condemneth the just even
[32:09] they both
[32:10] are abomination to the lord pretty
[32:13] strong words right
[32:14] there wherefore is there a price in the
[32:17] hand
[32:17] of a fool to get wisdom seeing he hath
[32:21] no heart to it a friend loveth
[32:24] at all times and a brother is born
[32:28] for adversity oh isn't that beautiful i
[32:31] love verse 17
[32:33] amen a friend loveth at all times
[32:36] and a brother is born for adversity
[32:39] heavenly father we just ask you this
[32:41] evening lord
[32:42] once again as we look at these age-old
[32:45] proverbs father i
[32:46] i believe it would do us well lord if we
[32:48] would just continue
[32:50] not just for a few services but
[32:54] maybe all the days of our life just to
[32:56] come back and be reminded father
[32:59] lord how beautiful it is to serve you
[33:02] and the wisdom that you give us
[33:04] lord guidance your guiding hand upon us
[33:08] lord to know that father
[33:12] the only failure that we truly will ever
[33:14] have
[33:15] in our life will be the failure to let
[33:18] you lead our life
[33:20] and lord we thank you for your grace
[33:22] mercy tonight be with the
[33:24] saints father my own mother lord give
[33:26] strength to her
[33:28] lord our brother sergey i don't know
[33:31] father may be out on the road
[33:33] those who are not here tonight lord we
[33:36] thank you for the surgery that was for
[33:37] our sister shannon hofer
[33:39] lord for the circumstances the doctors
[33:42] felt like it went very well
[33:43] just ask your father to give life and to
[33:46] those bones that have died
[33:48] and lord give healing to her we ask in
[33:51] the name of jesus
[33:52] christ amen you may be seated
[33:59] you know as i look through this i i want
[34:02] to kind of focus on the
[34:04] the parts not necessarily to be selfish
[34:07] but
[34:08] focus on those things that really
[34:09] stirred my heart and
[34:11] as we look at this my brother and sister
[34:13] we'll look at verse 2 real quick a wise
[34:16] servant
[34:16] shall have rule over a son that calls us
[34:19] shame
[34:20] and shall have part of the inheritance
[34:22] among the brethren
[34:23] i just like to say this that i had to
[34:26] learn this lesson
[34:28] it is something that just didn't come
[34:31] natural
[34:32] i it took some bitter tears took a lot
[34:34] of prayers
[34:35] took a time of coming back into
[34:38] my own son and to look him in the face
[34:41] one day
[34:42] and be repentant on my own side on my
[34:45] own part
[34:47] because i was without wisdom in dealing
[34:51] with my son
[34:52] and this verse just strikes me my
[34:55] brother and sister a wise servant
[34:57] not just any old person not just one
[35:00] that
[35:01] demands obedience not one that is
[35:04] more worried about what someone else
[35:06] thinks
[35:07] but one that is wise shall rule over a
[35:10] son that causes shame and
[35:12] you know it reminds me of a statement
[35:16] that uh you know i heard many years ago
[35:20] there's various uh renditions of this
[35:23] but the statement is rules without
[35:26] respect
[35:27] leads to rebellion and so it is there
[35:30] that
[35:31] as our children or spouse or
[35:34] parents whatever it might be as as
[35:37] they uh go through struggles in their
[35:40] life i pray god gives each one of us
[35:43] wisdom how to deal with that and you
[35:46] know
[35:47] things come about that sometimes you
[35:49] know things still are
[35:51] not necessarily like we would want them
[35:53] to be
[35:54] but you uh with wisdom can open the
[35:57] conversation
[35:59] in such a fashion that they know exactly
[36:01] where you stand
[36:02] but because they know you're sincere
[36:04] they know you love them
[36:06] they're able to receive the words
[36:10] without rebellion so you're able to say
[36:14] i don't agree with what you are doing
[36:18] and this is why and they don't
[36:22] flare up at you they don't fight back at
[36:24] you because
[36:26] they know you respect them
[36:29] they know that you love them they know
[36:31] that your care for them
[36:34] is is of a nature that
[36:37] they might not agree with at the moment
[36:41] but they know that you're not they're
[36:42] just criticizing they're not just
[36:44] putting them down and and you know so i
[36:47] i just that verse struck me you know
[36:49] actually this whole verse chapter 17
[36:53] has so many little tidbits that touch my
[36:55] own life
[36:56] that it would sound like i would just be
[36:58] sharing my story tonight but i i don't
[37:00] want to do that so i'll try not to
[37:03] but saints i just want you to remember
[37:05] as we deal with our children whether
[37:07] they're
[37:07] you know you know just at the age
[37:10] they're starting to
[37:11] understand uh let us deal
[37:14] with wisdom let us by god's grace pray
[37:17] through of
[37:18] how to deal with things and what to say
[37:20] and when to say it and
[37:22] you know i'll just share this little
[37:24] tidbit i know my son won't matter
[37:26] you know my son fought when he was young
[37:29] that
[37:29] uh his mom and dad was a little hard on
[37:32] him in fact it's a cute little story
[37:35] if you can see the humor in it that
[37:38] jerry one time found our son sitting out
[37:41] behind the house
[37:42] talking to the dog and kind of
[37:44] complaining to the dog that his mother
[37:47] was so mean
[37:50] you know the dog i guess was the only
[37:52] sympathetic
[37:54] one around the house
[37:57] but you know our son
[38:00] he kind of grew up feeling like his
[38:02] parents had been hard on him some
[38:04] people call it a middle child syndrome
[38:06] isn't it amazing how many syndromes
[38:07] there are there's one for the oldest
[38:09] child
[38:10] there's one for the middle child there's
[38:11] one for the youngest child there's one
[38:13] for the only child
[38:15] and so you know we can find an excuse
[38:19] for almost anything but
[38:21] you know one day my son is on the phone
[38:23] and he goes dead
[38:26] he goes i thought i'd ask you a question
[38:28] and i was like okay what what is it and
[38:30] he said
[38:31] what do you do with a 12 year old
[38:36] who will not do his school work will not
[38:38] listen
[38:40] and i said son go stand in the mirror
[38:44] and ask yourself that question
[38:49] he had good humor that day he said i've
[38:52] already done that and i have no answer
[38:56] you see it is the reality that we
[38:59] experience but we don't always convey
[39:02] we can't convey that we can't share the
[39:05] life lesson so therefore we need to
[39:07] saints have a compassion as it is for
[39:09] our children
[39:11] that the struggle they're going through
[39:12] that you're saying if you i know none of
[39:14] you ever did this but
[39:15] you know some of us did and if you just
[39:18] listen to me
[39:20] you'll have the answer
[39:24] don't we wish that worked but you see
[39:27] they have to go and experience it for
[39:29] themselves and
[39:30] if we recognize that natural and
[39:33] spiritual type together
[39:35] that sometimes what we have experienced
[39:38] what we've went through
[39:39] is so real to us that we would like to i
[39:42] just say this figurative i'm not picking
[39:44] on
[39:44] no one or trying to imply anything we'd
[39:46] like to go out maybe to
[39:48] the young people and be able to just
[39:50] grab a hold of them and say just
[39:53] listen to me
[39:56] but what we need to do is have a
[39:58] compassion to realize it doesn't work
[40:00] like that it didn't work for
[40:02] you it didn't work for your parents it
[40:03] didn't work for your parents parents
[40:05] all the way down into the history of
[40:07] your family it didn't work that way and
[40:09] so what we need to do
[40:11] by god's grace is have a wisdom on how
[40:14] to deal with because this struggle
[40:17] is very real to that individual as the
[40:20] scripture speaking to that
[40:21] son that struggle is very real
[40:25] it is not a just listen to me you won't
[40:28] go through it
[40:29] they have to go through it they have to
[40:32] experience it
[40:33] just like our children must come to the
[40:36] place that they recognize
[40:37] even though being born in a family
[40:40] in the house of god all the days of
[40:43] their life
[40:43] they are a sinner they've got to come to
[40:46] that it isn't enough that we can just
[40:48] say
[40:48] you were raised in the church your fine
[40:50] children everything will be fine
[40:53] they must come to the position that they
[40:55] recognize
[40:56] without jesus christ i'm lost but i
[40:59] never did anything evil i never done
[41:01] anything wrong
[41:02] how can i be lost it is not that you are
[41:05] simply
[41:06] under that covenant of born in sin and
[41:08] shaped in iniquity
[41:10] and we have to break that covenant
[41:13] amen and so it's there that we come and
[41:15] and you can't just
[41:16] cuddle your children you can't cuddle a
[41:19] son
[41:19] you must come but it must be in wisdom
[41:22] and it must be in love
[41:24] or otherwise we build a wall of
[41:26] rebellion because there's no respect
[41:32] god help us you'll see it sometimes in
[41:35] the preacher and how he treats people
[41:37] hopefully i'm not sound like a hypocrite
[41:40] here
[41:42] but when you see a preacher that speaks
[41:44] down on the people
[41:46] and is harsh with them what happens is
[41:49] is the human nature raises up a little
[41:52] wall
[41:53] he doesn't care about my situation
[41:56] he doesn't understand and if we're not
[41:58] careful it just shuts it off
[42:03] you see all else aspects of this
[42:06] we must have the wisdom how to deal with
[42:09] this
[42:10] and we see how god come down in the form
[42:14] stepped into it of jesus christ that was
[42:17] god himself
[42:18] and you see god didn't come down as a
[42:21] great mighty
[42:22] spiritual as it were warrior and just
[42:25] come and say
[42:26] do this but he lived out the example he
[42:30] he was hungry he was tired he felt
[42:33] friendless he
[42:34] he faced all the adversity he was spit
[42:37] on he was mistreated in every fashion
[42:39] and my brother and sister he didn't turn
[42:41] to an assistant and say you know what
[42:43] deal with them
[42:46] but he accepted that and with wisdom and
[42:48] we can look at that and see the wisdom
[42:50] as he deals with a son who has brought
[42:53] shame
[42:56] what is the wisdom he brings to you and
[42:58] i
[42:59] love and redemption
[43:02] and i pray that we would approach people
[43:05] that we interact with whether they've
[43:06] been
[43:07] in the are in the message have been in
[43:09] the message or headed out of the message
[43:10] coming to the message
[43:12] let us come with wisdom
[43:16] and love to show them
[43:20] really is a difference it's not just
[43:21] words
[43:23] you see we're coming down my brother and
[43:25] sister and you might think this is a
[43:26] silly example to bring
[43:28] but we're coming down to a time that
[43:30] it's just words
[43:31] has become the predominant factor
[43:34] in the world we live in today
[43:38] our politicians say this do this
[43:42] church leaders say this do this comes
[43:45] right down to every
[43:46] every aspect of everything that talk
[43:49] is cheap behavior can be anything
[43:53] and so you see the natural typing the
[43:55] spiritual what's happening
[43:57] the church is saying we're spiritual and
[43:59] we have need of nothing
[44:00] but yet their whole life is not one bit
[44:03] different than the world around them
[44:05] so the world around them says if that's
[44:07] what being a christian
[44:09] is then i don't need to be one because
[44:11] i'm just like they are
[44:13] but god in love and wisdom has come down
[44:17] and showed you and i
[44:18] that there is a life that we can take a
[44:20] hold of
[44:21] that is a life-changing life
[44:24] amen and that's what we want those
[44:26] around us to see
[44:28] that god give us wisdom god give us
[44:31] wisdom
[44:32] hallelujah remember rules without
[44:35] respect
[44:36] simply leads to rebellion
[44:39] i've been there i've been there as a
[44:42] young man
[44:44] sorry about my rant
[44:48] in verse three the finning pot the
[44:50] finding pot is for silver and the
[44:51] furnace for gold but the lord
[44:53] trieth the hearts and you know we look
[44:56] at this my brother and sister and
[44:57] realize
[44:58] that as we look through scripture we
[45:00] read the quotes and
[45:01] and talk about as it were uh the the
[45:04] refining
[45:05] fire uh and we look at that but you know
[45:08] god placing in us uh this uh value
[45:12] that is actually much greater than gold
[45:14] will look in
[45:15] revelations the second chapter the
[45:17] thytiran church agent
[45:19] it says there in this scripture that he
[45:21] searches the
[45:22] reigns in the hearts of man and and it's
[45:25] in there that he comes as a refining
[45:27] fire
[45:28] to cleanse us amen and it is my brother
[45:31] and sister
[45:32] such a a powerful word because as he's
[45:35] speaking to the thy tyrant church age
[45:37] he's he's laying down to them the very
[45:39] foundation
[45:40] of what is coming of what god is doing
[45:43] and how that
[45:44] the church in its present stage in those
[45:47] days
[45:47] was uh okay it was in you might say the
[45:50] will of god
[45:51] god had a judgment for them but they
[45:53] were in the will of god god was working
[45:55] through the church
[45:57] but god was telling them through the
[45:59] word that i'm going to
[46:01] purify you or bring you to a higher
[46:03] level
[46:04] and as time went on there's different
[46:06] quotes where brother brown says i tried
[46:08] to to not bring a lot of them tonight
[46:10] for the sake of time
[46:12] but brother branham uh talks about all
[46:14] those messengers coming right up into
[46:16] the philadelphian church age coming up
[46:19] into the pentecost movement
[46:21] brother branham says they all rejected
[46:24] the final move of the holy ghost
[46:28] you see when god come to finally do the
[46:30] purifying to
[46:31] to come down in that final final act my
[46:34] brother and sister
[46:35] it's one thing to have a piece of gold
[46:37] dug out of the earth
[46:39] it's another thing to take that gold and
[46:41] chip all the rock away from it and
[46:43] another thing to
[46:45] then put it in there and melt it down
[46:47] but you know
[46:48] if you understand those kind of things
[46:50] you don't just get it hot and it comes
[46:52] out
[46:52] clean meant a lot of revivals through
[46:56] the ages that didn't produce anything
[46:59] you see god had to just like a man and
[47:02] when he's melting these things down to
[47:04] purify that
[47:05] you have to put some kind of there's
[47:07] different terms for it but you have to
[47:08] put some kind of a
[47:10] flux in there that causes the impurities
[47:13] oh i hope you see this
[47:14] causes the impurities to draw together
[47:18] amen and causes the gold
[47:21] to come clean oh we're living in an age
[47:24] my brother and sister that god's putting
[47:26] something into the midst of the church
[47:28] that is causing the impurities to come
[47:30] together
[47:31] like never before never before have
[47:35] these people come
[47:36] been so bold and been so vocal to push
[47:39] against the word of god
[47:41] while declaring what you believe is
[47:43] wrong wrong
[47:44] wrong but yet they're completely outside
[47:46] of the word of god
[47:48] and what they don't realize the flux of
[47:50] the holy ghost
[47:51] is coming down in the midst of the
[47:53] church he's testing and
[47:55] changing and cleaning the hearts
[48:02] and the impurities are drawing together
[48:03] and becoming vocal you say why do you
[48:06] say vocal
[48:08] because when you add the flux depending
[48:11] on what kind of material you're using
[48:14] the impurities rise to the top and the
[48:17] first thing you see
[48:20] is the impurity
[48:23] and the only thing unless you deal with
[48:25] it
[48:26] is you will see the impurity
[48:30] so what happens the wheat
[48:35] and the tear must be separated
[48:40] and it is the move of the holy spirit
[48:42] that's coming down causing this
[48:43] separation
[48:44] and the word is coming to such a place
[48:47] my brother and sister this might sound a
[48:48] little harsh a little judgmental i don't
[48:50] mean it to be
[48:51] but it is a stark reality that god's
[48:54] pouring more of the holy spirit
[48:56] in causing the hearts to come and the
[48:58] hearts desire see he's
[49:00] checking out the heart he's not making
[49:03] the heart follow
[49:04] he is there refining as it were giving
[49:08] every opportunity to the heart to reach
[49:10] out and seek more of god
[49:17] and then it says in that season in that
[49:20] time
[49:22] that the tares would be bound as it
[49:24] would
[49:26] we used to doing different things
[49:29] melting things down
[49:31] you add the flux to that and then you
[49:34] can sweep all the impurities off the top
[49:38] we were making rifle bullets out of lead
[49:42] and so not exactly a precious metal
[49:45] but we wanted it to be clean we wanted
[49:49] to make good bullets out of it to shoot
[49:51] them
[49:51] and you see my brother and sister to me
[49:54] it's a very real thing
[49:56] he's searching the hearts now we'll look
[49:58] here in malachi 3
[50:00] and we'll see now as we look at this in
[50:03] malachi 3
[50:04] he said behold i send my messenger and
[50:06] he shall prepare the way before me
[50:08] and the lord whom ye seek
[50:11] shall suddenly come into his temple even
[50:14] the messenger of the covenant whom you
[50:16] delight and behold he shall come
[50:18] saith the lord of hosts but who may
[50:21] abide the day of his coming
[50:23] and who shall stand when he appeareth
[50:26] for he is like a refiner's fire
[50:29] and like fuller's soap so in this case
[50:32] we recognize the fuller soap is the
[50:34] additive that causes a separation
[50:39] and he shall sit as a refiner
[50:42] and a purifier of silver and he shall
[50:44] purify the sons of levi and purge them
[50:47] as gold and silver
[50:48] that they may offer unto the lord and
[50:50] offering in righteousness
[50:52] now you see my brother and sister every
[50:54] one of these is a reference that he
[50:56] is like a refiner's fire and like fuller
[51:00] soap
[51:00] and he shall sit as a refiner and he
[51:04] shall you see how this is laying out
[51:06] this
[51:07] he's looking at the heart and he's
[51:09] putting the flux as i've already spoken
[51:11] he's already putting that in which is
[51:13] the holy ghost in our hour
[51:15] and it's putting it in there and that
[51:16] holy spirit is coming now my brother and
[51:19] sister will see
[51:20] christ in two dispensations in in the
[51:23] day that we live in
[51:24] he either comes as our redeemer or he
[51:27] comes
[51:27] as our judge there's this two simply two
[51:32] positions
[51:33] we can call him redeemer but if our life
[51:36] is not worthy of the gospel he's
[51:38] actually
[51:38] coming as judge
[51:41] regardless of what we say and we talk
[51:44] about communion you know that we should
[51:46] judge ourselves
[51:48] you see what a lovely opportunity we've
[51:50] been given to uh open ourself
[51:53] up uh to the presentation as it were of
[51:56] the holy spirit
[51:57] and let the word of god come like the
[52:00] fuller soap right because it's actually
[52:01] the word
[52:02] that causes a separation amen we know
[52:05] the word is christ himself
[52:07] but we see that that it's the word that
[52:09] comes and is the
[52:10] final separation and so it's coming and
[52:13] even though we know malachi 3 doesn't
[52:16] directly apply to our day right this was
[52:19] really actually to john's day but the
[52:21] word my brother and sister applies to
[52:23] all of us
[52:24] and so it is there what is this make an
[52:27] offer unto the lord an offering not in
[52:30] its beauty
[52:31] not in its uh uh uh vast quantity
[52:35] not in any thing but righteousness
[52:40] that's what god's looking for he's
[52:41] looking for the offer in righteousness
[52:44] you see the man with an unclean heart
[52:46] could offer a perfect lamb
[52:52] didn't change anything he was a man with
[52:55] an unclean heart
[52:59] so as we look at this i just want to
[53:02] keep going here tonight
[53:03] um a wicked doer giveth heed to false
[53:07] lips
[53:10] i could give you so many examples that
[53:12] go with this but i'm restraining myself
[53:15] from things through the years that we
[53:18] we've heard
[53:19] stories shared uh uh some
[53:22] actually were directly affected to
[53:25] sister jerry and i through the years
[53:27] statements that were made and people
[53:29] heard it and believed it
[53:30] and were certain of its validity but my
[53:33] brother and sister
[53:34] you see uh just because someone uh
[53:37] uh listens to something you know as it
[53:40] were gossip
[53:42] and uh believes that and goes forth and
[53:45] shares that we have to make sure
[53:48] see we have people my brother and sister
[53:50] are so concerned that they'll be
[53:52] deceived
[53:55] but they listen to everything
[53:59] my lord help us you know what
[54:05] in business we have something i apply
[54:08] constantly because we deal with a
[54:10] multitude of people and that is trust
[54:12] but verify
[54:14] so i don't look at anyone and say i'm
[54:16] not going to trust them
[54:18] but i have a way of going and verifying
[54:22] what we're doing or whether or not
[54:26] what they're saying is correct
[54:30] now i like verse six we can get on a
[54:32] happy note here some of you smile on
[54:34] this especially those of you got
[54:35] grandchildren
[54:37] children's children are the crown of old
[54:39] men
[54:41] now i've got children's children i'm a
[54:43] grandfather so i guess i'm an old man
[54:46] but i'll tell you there's something
[54:47] special about them
[54:49] you know you like them in small doses
[54:51] you know grandchildren
[54:52] are are so lively
[54:56] they're so full of energy that after a
[54:58] while they simply
[54:59] wear you out but there's something about
[55:02] seeing them
[55:02] you're going to be frustrated and want
[55:04] to spank them yesterday and when you see
[55:05] them today all you want to do is kiss
[55:07] them
[55:09] the glory children are their fathers
[55:12] excellent speech becometh not a fool
[55:14] much less
[55:15] do lying lips a prince
[55:19] you know the apostle paul come and he
[55:21] said i do not come to you
[55:23] in excellency of speech
[55:27] here was an educated man of all the
[55:29] apostles he's a man that had an ability
[55:32] to speak
[55:33] in such a fashion that no doubt he can
[55:36] convince
[55:37] by the very words and the approach of
[55:39] using those words
[55:40] he could convince by that but see god
[55:43] anointed him not to come in the
[55:44] excellency of speech
[55:46] because a man that is persuaded against
[55:48] his will
[55:49] is unpersuaded still and so it's not
[55:52] about how persuasive we are my brother
[55:55] and sister
[55:55] this is why the prophet of god over and
[55:57] over and over again
[55:59] is talking about the gospel the message
[56:01] of the hour coming in this day
[56:03] and what what the christ the threefold
[56:06] manifestation of christ
[56:07] and over and over again he says this
[56:09] can't be explained
[56:13] it has to be a revelation it can't be
[56:16] explained otherwise someone with a a
[56:19] beautiful speech with beautiful words
[56:21] can lay it all out so correctly
[56:23] as to why this is why it should be what
[56:25] it is and many people
[56:27] then come and the prophet of god also
[56:30] speaks about that
[56:31] is kind of an intellectual revelation of
[56:34] the word for the hour
[56:35] and my brother and sister we don't want
[56:37] an intellectual revelation
[56:39] let it come first into the strength in
[56:41] its in our heart
[56:42] and then as we come god opens page after
[56:45] page after page
[56:46] line after line until we see what the
[56:49] plan of god is
[56:50] and see our place in it and how we fit
[56:53] so
[56:53] intricate into that plan we are not just
[56:56] shoved into it my brother and sister
[56:58] let me tell you put it this way now some
[57:00] would not agree with this approach
[57:02] but my brother and sister because
[57:04] knowing that we would have the mind of
[57:06] christ
[57:07] knowing that we are the very portion as
[57:09] the prophet of god says
[57:10] we are the half of him and that makes
[57:13] the whole
[57:14] do you realize the whole plan of god was
[57:16] actually built
[57:17] around you
[57:20] now that seems some people think that's
[57:22] contradictory
[57:24] but i want you to look at this for a
[57:26] moment god didn't say i'm going to do
[57:28] i'm going to ask something impossible
[57:31] and expect you to do it
[57:34] god said i'm going to take humanity who
[57:37] has created
[57:38] in my image and i'm going to make
[57:41] everything available to them what we
[57:45] see is weakness god just sees as part of
[57:47] the plan
[57:48] and as this comes a hold god designed
[57:50] this whole plan
[57:51] my brother and sister i'll just liken it
[57:53] to this right here
[57:54] god had a segment of his creation
[57:57] of redemption for the woman at the well
[58:00] and all like her
[58:03] he had it for the rich man he had it for
[58:05] the poor man he had it for the really
[58:07] smart man
[58:08] he had it for the very unintelligent as
[58:10] it were man
[58:11] so god built the whole plan around what
[58:13] we were going to be
[58:15] so that he could fulfill then that plan
[58:18] in
[58:18] our life specifically not just hey you
[58:22] happen to fit into this my brother and
[58:24] sister the plan of redemption
[58:26] was built specifically for you and i and
[58:28] we don't just
[58:29] as it were the round hole and square peg
[58:32] concept
[58:33] god made that plan of redemption to fit
[58:35] you and i
[58:36] perfectly oh if it's our if he did that
[58:40] for us perfectly
[58:41] how about we just perfectly trust him
[58:44] how about we just perfectly stand on
[58:46] that word and say lord let it come to
[58:47] pass in me
[58:49] hallelujah hallelujah now you know
[58:52] verse 9 he that covereth a transgression
[58:55] seeketh love but he that repeateth a
[58:58] matter separated
[58:59] very friends now this my brother and
[59:02] sister there are several different
[59:03] things
[59:04] quotes and and scriptures that we can
[59:06] look at this the scripture on one side
[59:08] let's look at it kind of you might say
[59:09] the negative side here
[59:11] if we hide
[59:16] one sin the scripture says we become a
[59:18] partaker of that sin
[59:23] amen
[59:27] but do you know the scriptures talking
[59:28] in that
[59:31] that a man who won't repent
[59:34] keeps coming and we would
[59:38] as it were shield everyone
[59:41] from their behavior actions and
[59:44] consequence
[59:46] scripture says then we're partaker of
[59:47] that
[59:50] but the scripture says if you see a
[59:52] brother taken in a fault
[59:56] let me just paraphrase it you don't go
[59:57] rebuke him degrade him shame him
[1:00:01] you actually cover him
[1:00:06] you actually shield him
[1:00:10] to lift him back up to his rightful
[1:00:12] position
[1:00:14] so we cover a transgression it's because
[1:00:17] we love them
[1:00:19] not because we want to hide their sin
[1:00:23] does that make sense do i explain that
[1:00:25] well enough you see the two differences
[1:00:28] some people hide sin in the church we
[1:00:31] we've known of situations where sin has
[1:00:33] been
[1:00:33] hidden covered up camouflaged in the
[1:00:36] church because we don't want the
[1:00:37] disruption
[1:00:38] but the person never repented
[1:00:42] what it does is ultimately because the
[1:00:44] scripture says whatever's done in secret
[1:00:46] will be made
[1:00:46] open but when you have someone with a
[1:00:49] repentant heart and they have a failure
[1:00:51] as it were in their life
[1:00:52] we don't broadcast it to the world we
[1:00:54] cover that up because there is
[1:00:56] repentance
[1:00:58] we want to restore them we don't want to
[1:01:00] shame them we want to restore them
[1:01:02] so you see the two sides of this amen
[1:01:05] that we would cover
[1:01:07] a transgression of a man a brother
[1:01:10] because we want to restore them to their
[1:01:14] rightful place amen
[1:01:16] and you look at this and and realize
[1:01:18] that these things are
[1:01:19] are very difficult sometimes things
[1:01:22] happen in people's lives
[1:01:23] the devil gets in there throws a
[1:01:25] stumbling stone
[1:01:26] and they get caught by that my brother
[1:01:28] and sister what we want them to do we
[1:01:31] want each
[1:01:31] one of us uh let's bring it back to
[1:01:33] ourselves we want to have a spirit of
[1:01:36] repentance
[1:01:37] we want to come and and not be shamed
[1:01:40] and
[1:01:40] and throwed out but we want to have a
[1:01:42] spirit of repentance and
[1:01:44] and that works kind of in two ways my
[1:01:46] brother and sister you see people
[1:01:48] can come and feel like well that church
[1:01:50] wasn't very kind to me
[1:01:52] but yet they themselves have something
[1:01:54] that they have held in their own heart
[1:01:56] there's a spirit about them there's a
[1:01:58] nature about them there's a behavior
[1:02:00] about them
[1:02:01] and they're not going to repent but they
[1:02:03] want everyone to overlook that for them
[1:02:06] no it's a two-way street amen
[1:02:10] right the prophet of god shows us
[1:02:12] clearly whatever we want in the house of
[1:02:14] god
[1:02:14] we must come in an attitude or a spirit
[1:02:17] to receive that
[1:02:20] hallelujah amen
[1:02:24] and reproof in earth more into a wise
[1:02:26] man than a hundred stripes into a fool
[1:02:30] the word of god says that we come to the
[1:02:32] house of god
[1:02:34] that's where correction begins so we
[1:02:37] recognize correction doesn't begin in
[1:02:39] the man called the pastor
[1:02:41] or the man called the deacon but
[1:02:44] correction
[1:02:45] starts in the word of god in the moving
[1:02:47] of the holy spirit and
[1:02:48] so the chastening doesn't come of man it
[1:02:52] comes of the word and
[1:02:53] my brother and sister we have to receive
[1:02:55] or hear the word
[1:02:57] to be corrected or chastened so when we
[1:03:00] won't listen
[1:03:01] when we close off to certain things then
[1:03:04] sometimes god is dealing with us and we
[1:03:07] just simply don't want to listen
[1:03:10] but you know what correction or
[1:03:11] chastening doesn't mean negative to a
[1:03:14] child of god
[1:03:15] it actually means positive
[1:03:24] i want to go down to verse 14.
[1:03:29] the beginning of strife is as when one
[1:03:31] letteth out water
[1:03:33] therefore leave off contention before
[1:03:36] it be meddled with now my brother and
[1:03:39] sister if you
[1:03:40] would understand what they're meaning
[1:03:42] here the beginning of strife is is when
[1:03:45] one lit without water
[1:03:46] you realize that when you go to let out
[1:03:49] water
[1:03:50] without having something to measure it
[1:03:52] in if if it's just simply running
[1:03:54] as it would be out of a culvert into a
[1:03:56] ditch
[1:03:57] there is no way to
[1:04:00] let just a little
[1:04:05] when you open the gate it flows
[1:04:09] now i say this humorous but i hope
[1:04:12] i hope you catch the deep meaning of it
[1:04:15] because
[1:04:16] it isn't always that we intend
[1:04:19] someone might say now brother paul what
[1:04:22] is the problem that you have with
[1:04:24] brother david
[1:04:26] well brother david and i don't really
[1:04:28] have a problem
[1:04:31] but
[1:04:37] i mean the other day it wasn't really a
[1:04:39] big deal
[1:04:41] but
[1:04:45] and i i really think he didn't mean bad
[1:04:48] by it but he
[1:04:57] well come on tell me what did he do well
[1:05:00] i
[1:05:01] shouldn't
[1:05:04] well it can't be that big a deal can it
[1:05:06] no really it's not
[1:05:13] the person walks away
[1:05:16] oh i thought maybe he just like tripped
[1:05:19] over your foot in the foyer
[1:05:23] we didn't really i hope you follow me
[1:05:25] saints we didn't really when we started
[1:05:27] out we didn't
[1:05:28] intend
[1:05:33] but when you start opening the gate
[1:05:38] it just comes out now
[1:05:41] don't lift your hands but because i want
[1:05:44] you to understand where i stand on this
[1:05:46] i've been guilty of that
[1:05:50] i never intended to say what i said or
[1:05:53] the amount of what i said but i said
[1:05:54] what i said when it was all done
[1:05:56] why because i opened the gate and next
[1:05:58] thing it was flowing
[1:06:00] and so contention comes out my brother
[1:06:03] in such a fashion
[1:06:04] and the word says you know what what i
[1:06:06] want you to do
[1:06:07] is to not let out any water at all don't
[1:06:10] let any contention come out at all
[1:06:13] the beginning of strife is as when one
[1:06:15] litteth out water
[1:06:17] therefore leave off contention
[1:06:22] you know how hard that is saints but i'm
[1:06:23] telling you right now can i be open with
[1:06:25] you tonight
[1:06:26] i'm telling you right now god help me i
[1:06:28] i just seems like sometimes these things
[1:06:30] happen
[1:06:31] and i just want to be able to come and
[1:06:34] take my gripes about you
[1:06:36] did i say that
[1:06:39] and i want to lay them down at an altar
[1:06:41] where it really matters
[1:06:44] you see because if i say something about
[1:06:46] you to you or you to you
[1:06:48] it doesn't change anything my brother
[1:06:51] and sister
[1:06:52] it just starts a contention and it
[1:06:55] starts to move through the church and
[1:06:57] sometimes these contentions can come
[1:06:59] from all kinds of things and
[1:07:00] pardon me for making a reference but it
[1:07:02] can be doctrine it can be ideologies it
[1:07:05] can be
[1:07:05] teachings that people have and this
[1:07:08] contention starts to move and pretty
[1:07:09] soon it's thrown to the whole building
[1:07:11] it's flow flowed through every life it's
[1:07:14] touching everyone
[1:07:15] and in the end we can say i really
[1:07:17] didn't mean for that to happen
[1:07:18] and be truthful in our heart but if we
[1:07:21] can come and say you know what
[1:07:22] i disagree with this i disagree with
[1:07:25] that i don't like what brother paul
[1:07:26] said i don't like what brother you know
[1:07:28] what my brother and sister if we'll lay
[1:07:30] it on the altar first
[1:07:31] and you do that you know you can correct
[1:07:34] your husband sisters
[1:07:36] from the altar brother you can correct
[1:07:39] your wives
[1:07:40] from the altar parents we can correct
[1:07:42] our children
[1:07:43] from the altar do you believe me
[1:07:47] it's it's scriptural
[1:07:52] of course the scripture also says spare
[1:07:54] the rod you spoil the child so
[1:07:56] there's times and places
[1:08:01] but see some people are drawn to what
[1:08:03] you might call contention
[1:08:06] some people are drawn to that some
[1:08:07] people need you know some people
[1:08:10] uh the older i get pardon for putting it
[1:08:13] back this way but the older i get the
[1:08:15] less drama i like in my life
[1:08:17] i just like you know i like this to
[1:08:20] happen
[1:08:20] and i like this to happen i like this to
[1:08:23] happen and
[1:08:24] if you say you're gonna do it please
[1:08:26] just do it
[1:08:27] i don't want it to be a big deal just do
[1:08:29] it if you can't do it you said you would
[1:08:32] do it
[1:08:32] and you can't do it just pick up a
[1:08:35] telephone and say
[1:08:36] i'm sorry i told you i don't know for an
[1:08:38] example i told you i would come and do
[1:08:40] this
[1:08:41] i can't come just pick the phone up
[1:08:43] don't make a drama out of it just say i
[1:08:45] am sorry i can't
[1:08:48] and then on the other end we don't make
[1:08:49] a drama out of it they
[1:08:51] promised well hallelujah
[1:08:55] the world doesn't revolve around me it
[1:08:57] doesn't revolve around you
[1:08:59] but the drama and some people love drama
[1:09:04] that's why the world has all kinds of
[1:09:05] drama shows
[1:09:10] having said that i read a little clip
[1:09:12] the other day on the computer that said
[1:09:15] that there is ample evidence that all
[1:09:17] the reality shows
[1:09:19] are false
[1:09:22] so what is it they've created a drama
[1:09:29] a little becomes a lot very quickly but
[1:09:32] i want to
[1:09:33] just put this as i try to hurry along
[1:09:36] here
[1:09:37] if we could focus this kind of energy
[1:09:42] that might come in all the contention
[1:09:44] whether it be within our marriages our
[1:09:46] families our church
[1:09:47] our workplace whatever you're talking
[1:09:49] about if we could
[1:09:50] focus our energies into the right
[1:09:53] channel
[1:09:54] in jude the first chapter verse 3
[1:09:58] says you know what beloved when i gave
[1:10:01] all diligence to write unto you of the
[1:10:03] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:10:05] to write
[1:10:06] unto you and exhort you that you should
[1:10:09] earnestly contend for the faith
[1:10:13] which was once delivered unto the saints
[1:10:16] now my brother and sister do you
[1:10:17] understand
[1:10:18] the root word connection contention and
[1:10:21] content
[1:10:22] come right down to the same basic root
[1:10:25] word definition
[1:10:29] my look at that what is it to argue
[1:10:33] to assert to compete
[1:10:38] literally when there is contention
[1:10:45] there's competition
[1:10:50] it's really what it comes down to it
[1:10:52] might be ideas
[1:10:53] ideologies competing but what if we took
[1:10:58] and funneled all of those energies into
[1:11:00] the right channel and
[1:11:01] and we stood here as ministers as
[1:11:04] brothers and sisters in christ
[1:11:06] and we said you know all of this stuff
[1:11:08] that's going on around us
[1:11:09] the energy it would take me to to go and
[1:11:12] tell this person
[1:11:13] i disagree with you what if we channel
[1:11:16] that
[1:11:16] and we got down and said lord if i'm
[1:11:18] wrong correct me if he's wrong correct
[1:11:20] him
[1:11:21] what if we focus that in lord and maybe
[1:11:24] you know they're wrong
[1:11:25] you know sometimes that does happen we
[1:11:27] know without a shadow of a doubted
[1:11:29] individual is wrong in their position
[1:11:31] and what if we channel that energy
[1:11:33] instead of cornering them in the corner
[1:11:35] of the church
[1:11:36] and telling them you're wrong you're
[1:11:37] wrong wrong and i can prove it what if
[1:11:39] we channel that
[1:11:40] into earnestly contending and while we
[1:11:43] contend for the faith that was once
[1:11:45] delivered
[1:11:45] we can go ahead and reach out with a
[1:11:47] hand of faith and get a hold of our
[1:11:49] brother and sister
[1:11:50] and pull them into our prayer life pull
[1:11:53] them
[1:11:54] into the word through our own prayers
[1:11:56] i've seen god work that way i've seen
[1:11:58] god answer prayer
[1:11:59] i've seen lives completely turned in
[1:12:02] different directions
[1:12:03] over the prayers of a wife a grandmother
[1:12:05] grandfather a husband
[1:12:08] and channel that energy into that and
[1:12:10] say you know what i'm not gonna
[1:12:12] pardon me brother david but i'm not
[1:12:14] gonna contend with brother david
[1:12:16] i'm gonna contend for the faith that was
[1:12:18] once delivered to the saints and as i
[1:12:21] contend for that faith that was
[1:12:22] delivered to the saints
[1:12:24] it will be remarkable that brother david
[1:12:25] gets more spiritual
[1:12:29] come on look saints i'm not trying to be
[1:12:32] boastful but i know i'm telling the
[1:12:33] truth tonight
[1:12:35] i'm knowing that every time satan can
[1:12:38] divert our attention and our energy to
[1:12:41] some other form of some contention
[1:12:46] he didn't say what i want you to do is
[1:12:48] earnestly get in contention
[1:12:50] for the faith he said i want you to
[1:12:52] contend and my brother and sister when
[1:12:54] you look at the root of that scripture
[1:12:56] and the root of those things my brother
[1:12:57] and sister what it is
[1:12:59] is when you are contending for the
[1:13:01] gospel the faith that was once delivered
[1:13:03] to the saints you are looking to christ
[1:13:05] in christ alone
[1:13:06] and no other body no other person no
[1:13:08] other body of believers
[1:13:10] no other faction you're looking to
[1:13:12] christ in christ alone
[1:13:15] because you see only god can change
[1:13:19] the others
[1:13:22] it's probably good that we can't
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:38] i'll skip over a little of this get a
[1:13:40] little carried away sometimes
[1:13:43] you know it goes right hand in hand
[1:13:48] with the sermon this thought and believe
[1:13:49] it or not the thought was there first
[1:13:52] but this is how hand in glove the quote
[1:13:55] fits to this brother branham is closing
[1:13:59] out a prayer
[1:14:00] may the lord add its blessings to that
[1:14:02] reading this is kind of an
[1:14:03] unusual text it's an unusual statement
[1:14:06] because we were asked to contend
[1:14:09] and yet the bible said there should not
[1:14:11] be contentions
[1:14:13] among us so very clearly stated right
[1:14:16] here in
[1:14:17] the the message that we should be
[1:14:20] contending without the contention
[1:14:22] god help us to put the contentions to
[1:14:24] the side i think they should this
[1:14:27] i want that that should have been this
[1:14:28] this should be come on let's forget the
[1:14:30] drama
[1:14:32] let's put our shoulder to the wheel and
[1:14:33] contend for the faith
[1:14:38] bible said there should not be
[1:14:39] contentious among us but we notice that
[1:14:41] not
[1:14:42] only to contend but to earnestly contend
[1:14:46] that is with great exuberance and energy
[1:14:51] contention is all right if it's for the
[1:14:54] right thing
[1:14:55] he said to earnestly contend for the
[1:14:57] faith that was once delivered unto the
[1:14:59] saints
[1:14:59] now you hear so say today oh divine
[1:15:02] healings against my faith
[1:15:04] the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:15:06] against my faith there's only one
[1:15:08] faith and that faith doesn't come by
[1:15:10] joining church that faith comes by
[1:15:12] hearing
[1:15:12] and that of the word of god and we wrote
[1:15:17] so if we are so if we are bid to
[1:15:20] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:15:22] once delivered unto the
[1:15:24] saints the faith should not come out of
[1:15:26] a creed book
[1:15:34] but it should come out of god's bible
[1:15:38] for faith cannot rest upon the shifting
[1:15:40] sand of man's theology
[1:15:43] but it can only rest upon the eternal
[1:15:44] rock of god's unchangeable word
[1:15:47] that's the only place that faith can
[1:15:49] sufficiently rest
[1:15:52] you understand the words that he put
[1:15:53] right there we can put our faith
[1:15:56] in other things but it will never be
[1:16:04] sufficient
[1:16:06] no matter how much something else how
[1:16:08] real it looks
[1:16:09] how godly it looks it must come from the
[1:16:12] word
[1:16:12] of the living god look sometimes now
[1:16:15] look i don't want to sound offensive
[1:16:18] but more and more as time goes on we're
[1:16:20] hearing people
[1:16:21] little things like brother branham told
[1:16:25] so and so who told so and so who told me
[1:16:31] but this going back here
[1:16:35] won't fit
[1:16:41] come on remember i shared that it just
[1:16:44] comes to my mind i shared that deal
[1:16:46] sister ruth sharing about the puzzle she
[1:16:48] had that had color on both sides of the
[1:16:50] pieces
[1:16:52] so you could put the piece in that shape
[1:16:56] but it's not the right
[1:17:00] not right see so
[1:17:05] we got to have something where
[1:17:06] sufficiently rest no matter how much
[1:17:08] something else how real it looks how
[1:17:10] godly it looks it must come from the
[1:17:11] word of the living god
[1:17:13] because faith only comes by hearing and
[1:17:15] hearing of the word
[1:17:16] so there's many things that looks
[1:17:18] appealing to the eye i have often
[1:17:20] thought of seeing
[1:17:21] great shrines of the different religions
[1:17:23] and how beautiful they could be and i
[1:17:25] think of the temple of diana
[1:17:26] in the bible that it's claimed that it
[1:17:28] was more beautiful than the temple of
[1:17:30] solomon
[1:17:31] made out of marble and laid with gold
[1:17:33] for the goddess diana of
[1:17:34] ephesus
[1:17:43] i'll just pause for a moment
[1:17:50] the looks doesn't count
[1:17:56] now i don't want all you sisters coming
[1:17:57] to church
[1:18:00] this next sunday looking like you've
[1:18:02] been out doing chores
[1:18:03] okay i want you to come to church
[1:18:05] beautiful
[1:18:07] wear your nice clothes do your hair come
[1:18:10] with a smile on your face
[1:18:12] okay brothers we don't want to come in
[1:18:14] here
[1:18:15] with our just grubbies and you know the
[1:18:17] prophet of god said wear your best to
[1:18:19] church and
[1:18:20] you know come presentable come looking
[1:18:23] like
[1:18:24] you're happy to be here
[1:18:28] but looks doesn't count
[1:18:35] it's what god's word says there's a way
[1:18:38] that seemeth right unto a man so then
[1:18:40] faith could not rest upon looks then
[1:18:42] faith can only find its place in the
[1:18:44] word
[1:18:45] and we were asked to contend earnestly
[1:18:47] for the faith that was once delivered
[1:18:49] unto the saints
[1:18:50] and you realize my brother and sister
[1:18:52] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:18:54] saints is right here
[1:18:55] contained in this book in the word in
[1:18:58] the holy ghost going back to my earlier
[1:19:00] thought
[1:19:00] it's been poured into you it's what's
[1:19:02] refining you
[1:19:04] it is not this church it is not some
[1:19:08] some certain group or some certain
[1:19:10] ministry or some certain activity
[1:19:12] it's the holy ghost in you that's doing
[1:19:15] the refining
[1:19:17] amen it's not well we were taught so
[1:19:19] well our pastor taught
[1:19:20] doctrine and all these things so well
[1:19:23] that won't give you the holy ghost
[1:19:26] that won't change your life it is the
[1:19:29] word
[1:19:30] which is christ in you
[1:19:33] there is what is changing us the nature
[1:19:35] change
[1:19:37] now we've just been sister jerry and i
[1:19:39] and in our interactions
[1:19:40] uh uh uh you know it's a it's a lovely
[1:19:44] thing
[1:19:44] uh and you know we come across this
[1:19:47] quote the other day
[1:19:48] this sister jerry actually shared it
[1:19:50] with me uh but i had just
[1:19:52] read it not that long ago uh where
[1:19:54] brother brown is dealing with that
[1:19:56] family and
[1:19:57] now he's talking about they were german
[1:19:59] and and uh
[1:20:00] and uh all this you know their ancestry
[1:20:04] and this young man had been converted
[1:20:07] but he hadn't received the holy ghost
[1:20:09] and the prophet of god says you know he
[1:20:11] ought not marry any girl
[1:20:13] pardon me for using these words but he
[1:20:15] says he'll make her life hell
[1:20:18] so the kid wasn't out in a bar room or a
[1:20:20] pool hall or
[1:20:21] running the streets at night he was
[1:20:23] going to church but he hadn't had a
[1:20:25] nature change
[1:20:29] young ladies well it goes both ways
[1:20:32] young people as the lord tarries and you
[1:20:35] get older you start looking for someone
[1:20:36] in your life
[1:20:40] don't look and say well that will
[1:20:44] change you don't marry them
[1:20:48] in fact you don't even hang out with
[1:20:50] them
[1:20:55] you know hold hands with them
[1:20:58] you know snuggling the car with them
[1:21:07] because without a nature change now when
[1:21:09] i'm talking about snuggling i'm not
[1:21:10] talking like the world's doing that i'm
[1:21:12] talking like
[1:21:13] you sit in the car touch shoulders you
[1:21:15] know going down the road you feel just
[1:21:16] that warm fuzzy feeling
[1:21:18] you married people should know what i'm
[1:21:20] talking about
[1:21:22] should don't go there
[1:21:27] the nature change comes first
[1:21:30] the new birth comes first that
[1:21:33] experience in christ
[1:21:35] and then you move on to happily ever
[1:21:40] after
[1:21:47] sometimes it's best to keep that inner
[1:21:49] voice
[1:21:50] inside
[1:21:54] we're asked to attend earnestly
[1:21:57] my brother and sister that's not
[1:21:59] half-heartedly that's not
[1:22:01] when it's available or it's easy
[1:22:06] an earnest contention is when you
[1:22:10] almost if you can i put in my words
[1:22:14] it's when you almost recklessly
[1:22:22] pursue
[1:22:24] well praise the lord if i get a
[1:22:25] promotion
[1:22:27] i'll know god loves me
[1:22:30] the devil will make sure you get
[1:22:32] bypassed
[1:22:34] come on we earnestly contend rich poor
[1:22:37] it's kind of like marriage vows right
[1:22:40] for richer for poorer
[1:22:43] sickness and in health
[1:22:46] for new house and furniture
[1:22:51] no earnestly contending
[1:22:55] i won't be satisfied without the faith
[1:22:58] that was delivered to the saints in
[1:23:01] pentecost
[1:23:02] i won't be satisfied until that same
[1:23:06] holy spirit comes down and i dwell in it
[1:23:09] each and every day
[1:23:14] my uh just so many things we could share
[1:23:18] but saints i just want you to catch this
[1:23:20] see all the way back
[1:23:22] in the proverbs not just
[1:23:25] 19th century 20th century 21st century
[1:23:28] all the way back in the proverbs
[1:23:32] it's showing us how this
[1:23:35] battle this race this great effort
[1:23:39] that is being afforded must be done
[1:23:44] with all of our might all with our
[1:23:46] ability
[1:23:47] not half-heartedly
[1:23:51] i should have went ahead and had brother
[1:23:54] alex put it but
[1:23:56] a little farther down in this quote i
[1:23:59] think it's
[1:24:00] beyond i think it was the 13th
[1:24:03] or 14th paragraph brother branham's
[1:24:06] talking about american why nothing is
[1:24:08] happening here is because the people are
[1:24:09] no longer hungry
[1:24:13] brother alex could you quickly find that
[1:24:16] amen the faith once delivered to the
[1:24:19] saints
[1:24:20] 5706 10 i believe it was 13 14 15
[1:24:24] somewhere right there
[1:24:27] let's see
[1:24:33] i don't know go back the other way just
[1:24:36] a little bit
[1:24:44] well brother alex if you'll just look
[1:24:46] for it right there
[1:24:50] he's talking
[1:24:55] anyway if we don't if we don't see that
[1:24:58] right there i might have read further
[1:24:59] than i
[1:25:00] you know that was further than i thought
[1:25:02] but my brother and sister the prophet of
[1:25:03] god is saying the problem is we're not
[1:25:04] hungry
[1:25:05] that's right that's why god's not doing
[1:25:07] he says if we get hungry god will start
[1:25:10] acting upon it let's let's get hungrier
[1:25:13] saints can we do that i i'm not going to
[1:25:15] chastise nobody i'm just asking you from
[1:25:17] my heart
[1:25:18] let's get hungry or let's let's start
[1:25:21] putting a more
[1:25:22] earnestness in our contending and you
[1:25:25] say well brother paul i'm
[1:25:26] full-blown contending praise the lord
[1:25:28] pray for me
[1:25:30] pray for me got a lot of distractions in
[1:25:31] my life pray for me
[1:25:33] amen now look
[1:25:37] i want to just close out with this right
[1:25:39] here proverbs
[1:25:42] 15th verse he that justifieth the wicked
[1:25:46] and he that condemneth the just even
[1:25:48] they both are abomination to the lord
[1:25:50] now i want you to see the continuity as
[1:25:52] we would go backwards
[1:25:54] into proverbs the sixth chapter and we
[1:25:56] would look right here
[1:25:58] and we will see what the scripture says
[1:26:01] 6-16
[1:26:02] these six things that the lord hate yea
[1:26:04] seven are an abomination unto him
[1:26:07] a proud look a lying tongue
[1:26:10] hands that shed innocent blood a heart
[1:26:13] that devises wicked imaginations
[1:26:16] feet be swift in running to mischief
[1:26:20] a false witness that speaketh lie
[1:26:23] and he that soweth discord among the
[1:26:26] brethren
[1:26:27] amen now i'm going to take this and if
[1:26:29] you don't mind i'm going to just focus
[1:26:30] on this last verse for just a moment
[1:26:32] sister emmy if you'll come
[1:26:34] you see my brother and sister he that
[1:26:36] saw a discord
[1:26:38] among his brethren would be one
[1:26:42] that would intentionally come and bring
[1:26:45] contention into the body of believers
[1:26:51] intentionally
[1:26:55] knowing that what he's saying knowing
[1:26:56] what he's doing
[1:26:58] is going to cause problems
[1:27:02] god said that's an abomination
[1:27:05] god forgive us when we innocently
[1:27:08] cause problems you know forgive us lord
[1:27:12] when we innocently say or do something
[1:27:14] that causes a problem
[1:27:15] but look at the kind of spirit that
[1:27:16] would be upon a man
[1:27:18] to know as it would be i can come and i
[1:27:20] can drive a wedge between brother trevor
[1:27:22] sister carrie
[1:27:23] or brother trevor and brother david or
[1:27:25] or whoever it might be i can drive a
[1:27:27] wedge in there
[1:27:29] god says i hate that that makes me sick
[1:27:34] oh my brother and sister god forgive us
[1:27:36] for our innocent mistakes
[1:27:38] and lord protect us from any spirit that
[1:27:40] would cause us
[1:27:42] to come with a contentious spirit
[1:27:45] into the house of god let us come
[1:27:48] already my brother and sister uh uh
[1:27:52] surrendered already come subjected to
[1:27:55] the word of god come into the house of
[1:27:57] god into the body of believers
[1:27:59] already you know what is real you know
[1:28:01] what is real courage
[1:28:02] i read this and i won't have the words
[1:28:04] writing but i read this recently
[1:28:07] said real courage is a man who comes up
[1:28:10] with his name
[1:28:12] and tell him thank you when it's
[1:28:14] finished
[1:28:18] wow i can sit down and
[1:28:22] interact and not have to start a fight
[1:28:27] and can get up and say
[1:28:29] thank you let us be those kind of
[1:28:32] christians
[1:28:34] let us just take these words from the
[1:28:36] book of proverbs and
[1:28:37] let them come down and rest in our heart
[1:28:39] i believe god laid them
[1:28:41] for us to to realize these little
[1:28:43] nuggets as we go along we get to pick
[1:28:45] them up as we go along
[1:28:46] and realize you know what and and here
[1:28:49] again saints i'm sorry to say i've been
[1:28:51] guilty
[1:28:53] of venting frustrations at times
[1:28:56] and saying well if they had done this
[1:28:59] you know what i've done
[1:29:01] i've thrown out every ingredient there
[1:29:03] is
[1:29:04] for a contention
[1:29:07] when i've taken that to people
[1:29:11] instead of christ when we take that
[1:29:16] as it were to the church
[1:29:19] and not the pastor you know what i'm
[1:29:22] saying
[1:29:24] sometimes even we can take it to a
[1:29:28] friend
[1:29:30] my wife what are we doing we're creating
[1:29:34] the ingredient for contention
[1:29:36] my husband the ingredient
[1:29:40] for contention how about lord
[1:29:44] i just know i just know my husband is
[1:29:48] wrong lord
[1:29:52] but i'll just leave it to you lord to
[1:29:54] change it
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:30:00] you know sometimes god just
[1:30:05] lets these things happen it ain't about
[1:30:07] the trial
[1:30:09] it's about what you and i are going to
[1:30:12] do with
[1:30:12] it lord help us to pass the test
[1:30:16] help us lord that the refiners fire as
[1:30:20] it refines our hearts
[1:30:22] brings us pure and pure into
[1:30:24] righteousness
[1:30:26] not of the things that buffeted by this
[1:30:28] earth
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:32] not by the things of this earth my
[1:30:34] brother and sister but moved by the holy
[1:30:35] spirit
[1:30:37] because you see if we're moved by the
[1:30:39] things of this earth
[1:30:41] we actually will just simply get blown
[1:30:44] off course but when we allow the holy
[1:30:47] spirit
[1:30:48] to come down we'll find those around us
[1:30:53] even though they might do us wrong we
[1:30:56] can find ourselves fulfilling the word
[1:30:58] of god that we can
[1:30:59] love our enemies have you ever thought
[1:31:01] how hard that is
[1:31:03] come on saints honest some of you are
[1:31:06] more passionate some people are just
[1:31:07] smile not your head go on
[1:31:10] some of us are more passionate
[1:31:13] well i can remember this happened
[1:31:16] oh really when did that happen it
[1:31:18] happened on may the 13th
[1:31:20] 1984 might be time to
[1:31:24] let go of that you see
[1:31:27] we want to be able to love our enemy
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:33] it's got to start somewhere doesn't it
[1:31:36] we're fixing to start planting
[1:31:40] you know seeds saints
[1:31:44] all we're putting in the ground right
[1:31:45] now
[1:31:47] is a seed i spent all winter
[1:31:52] fixing the harvester that's wonderful
[1:31:56] we've spent years preaching about the
[1:31:58] rapture
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:01] but we got to get the right seed to
[1:32:04] produce
[1:32:05] the right result that there would be
[1:32:09] a rapture that we'd have something
[1:32:13] to be harvested i just prayed tonight
[1:32:18] just from the depths of my heart as i
[1:32:19] read these scriptures
[1:32:22] i just saw god dealing with me little
[1:32:25] things
[1:32:27] i'll be transparent when the trouble
[1:32:29] went through this church
[1:32:32] i felt so gut-punched
[1:32:35] i i wanted to revert back to some wild
[1:32:39] teenager and just go assault somebody
[1:32:44] now we can laugh about that saints but
[1:32:46] it was a feeling i felt betrayed
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:50] but out of all of that god said look
[1:32:52] this is your part
[1:32:55] how do you feel about your part you know
[1:32:58] what i had to do
[1:33:00] had to repent over my part
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:06] but ultimately i don't want contention
[1:33:10] i want to see a group of people each and
[1:33:13] every one of us
[1:33:14] as it were shoulder to shoulder saints
[1:33:16] each one of you
[1:33:18] i trust you how much i love you so i'm
[1:33:20] not doing from human emotion but
[1:33:22] from my heart how i love you as brothers
[1:33:25] and sisters in christ
[1:33:26] and i want to see us shoulder to
[1:33:27] shoulder each one contending
[1:33:30] all contention left behind us
[1:33:34] simply contending for the cross
[1:33:37] simply contending for the faith that was
[1:33:39] given to us
[1:33:41] hallelujah oh my
[1:33:47] what is that song sister
