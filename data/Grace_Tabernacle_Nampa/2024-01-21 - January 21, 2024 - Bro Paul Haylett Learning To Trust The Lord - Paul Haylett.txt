guiding us father to be Sons and Daughters to be all that you called us to be May the power of the word come alive in us this morning I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah well I'll try to keep this very short so you don't have to stand but we just had a a wonderful time uh you know uh there's a lot could be said but I'll just say that um God was really gracious uh our brother David uh invited us to be a part of Newport Camp our convention actually I guess is what it would be and you know I got to meet a lot of brothers that I never knew before and um we got to see the power of the Gospel change lives so many testimonies uh the testimonies go into the dozens upon dozens of of positive report coming back of things that have changed and I I interacted and got to speak to many of these young people and to hear uh their testimonies and it it is lifechanging even for us amen we stand there and preach the gospel but we're still human and sometimes we just need encouragement our own selves and God come and we got to see that was not without opposition amen Satan was there amen broke my heart but there were young people that sat during the service and looked at their phones and laughed sharing a joke or something with each other but my brother and sister I don't want to be rude but the word of God is to the believer amen amen if people don't want to believe I'm not talking about going through the struggle of life don't misunderstand me I'm not talking about fighting a battle and sometimes feeling like you've been overrun by the enemy but I'm talking about just a a cold Spirit an indifferent spirit and I prayed for young people and I was blunt uh maybe not the normal Paul that you might know but I was incredibly blunt with some of these young people uh of don't let this Indi Spirit keep you from being blessed and saw some respond and some didn't but it doesn't matter matter we were there doing what God wanted us to do and I believe that it was a powerful work I never knew brother Andrew Spencer before but uh got to have a lot of time to interact to talk on the things of God talk on natural things and um I just bring uh a a uh thank you from Brother Andrew I text him very early this morning uh to let him know that we were praying for brother Ron and um he sends his thank yous for your prayers and uh so also greetings from him and um sister Katie just a wonderful sister and um also greetings from our brother Matt and sister Rachel Watkins I never knew brother Matthew before I've many times thought to invite him but somehow just never did but um amen just met a fine young man I I can't even put to words uh the the connection I felt with him it was as though uh I say this kind of humorous you know married people can answer or finish each other's questions and I found with brother Matt that uh uh I was just like yep and he's going to say and then he would come along and say now brother Paul and I was like oh come on brother Matt let me finish my sentence so just this lovely Connection by God's grace I want you to pray I I would like to invite brother mat sister Rachel uh and uh do that I don't know if you saw uh sister Becky coffey's father passed away brother fure after U 90 97 years old uh a veteran of World War II of combat and a veteran of many many years as a minister and um a lovely Legacy in his family he's got uh uh a whole past C of grandsons that are just serving the lord and doing their very best to spread the gospel so remember Sister Becky uh in prayer You Know It uh uh her her dad was you know just a huge part of her life and what a wonderful testimony there is there amen so as we'll look at this I just um want to bring last but not least actually this is the greatest I saved it for last greetings from our brother David and sister St iers uh Brother David is the pastor of the church there in Nazareth Belgium um oh I forgot I was going to write the title down it's quite a lengthy name on their Church basically shorten it up in English uh the Bride of Jesus Christ assembly amen and uh just a lovely group of people um and um uh Brother David sister EST send their greetings and um they're doing an incredible work uh they're a church not much different in size maybe a little bit bigger than us but very much a spearhead of uh many things there in that area and uh a a great example amen that it doesn't take a large Church to do a great work amen and I tell you Saints I I would like us to catch that kind of vision amen that it doesn't take a huge church and it doesn't take uh uh what we always put as oh if we this and if we that but just to yield to the will of God let God do the work amen it's a an amazing thing so I bring greetings from Brother David and the church to you amen let's turn our Bibles I want to speak to you this morning on this title challenged but not defeated learning to trust the Lord uh I spoke spoke a little bit bit of this uh there last Sunday in Belgium uh but I just felt it on my heart to to come back and you know I kind of put it out to Sister Jerry I said do you think it would be strange for me to preach the same sermon and uh just as a wife she's just like you won't preach it the same anyway so just go go ahead and so here we go amen sister Leah sister Gabriella are going to say you know I think I've heard this before but it won't be so by God's grace amen we turn to the Book of James first chapter verses 2-8 and you're very familiar with these scripture and by the way I don't know if I said it I am so happy to be home amen God bless you Mel my lovely niece I love her so much Michael amen so surprised see Michael there coming seemingly out of the veil just walked right and that's just awesome Amen the scripture very familiar for us my brother and sister and until you catch by Revelation what God is really saying to you this scripture will always seem to be difficult but when you catch by Revelation what God is really saying what he's doing you will read this scripture and you will say praise the Lord amen hallelujah glory to God Amen because I will be tested and I will be challenged but I will not be defeated amen there's the whole thing it's not whether you face the battle my brother and sister and it's not matter whether you come unscathed from the battle it's knowing that you cannot be defeated is what makes the difference in our lives amen my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith Amen Let me back up a little bit having the revelation of this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire which is complete wanting nothing but if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that he giveth to all men liberally and up Brath not and it shall be given him but let him ask in Faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in his spiritual life in all things that's right amen if you find yourself being tossed and driven just stop go back through this scripture and let this scripture come alive cuz when it comes alive the devil can't blast you hard enough to shake you now when I say shake you my brother and sister that won't mean this old flesh amen one of these days we're going to catch the Revelation this old flesh is not our friend we're going to catch a revelation this old flesh should not be our control tower amen but the old flesh has got a voice and that voice doesn't belong to God amen amen it belongs to the flesh amen and we know what that anointing is amen amen Heavenly Father we ask you come Lord as we would just come give us Lord the courage to speak boldly today let it speak concisely today father let it make a difference Lord we don't want this just to be a tradition we come and stood and spoke to the people and the people responded and we go home with nothing changed but let today be a day father that we could lift a hand lift a heart and say Lord change me change my heart oh Lord father change me into your image Lord bring me to a place that I can walk with the confidence that I know Lord you intend for me to walk in Lord we ask you for your blessing today ask for your anointing in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I guess I might as well just get this out in the open so that you'll all know that that in just roughly two weeks we will be going for the first time in years to Chile and um just asking that the Lord would just give us something that it not just be a visit uh to say hi to old friends but if God would be so gracious that it would be a time of the opening of the word a time that the Holy Spirit would use us to uh maybe touch a new generation of young people I I look at the pictures and uh Communications that are shared and um you know that uh I'm just going to speak boldly I don't want to sound conceited but those that we were instrumental and then coming to the Lord and being baptized and lives being changed amen and now we see them they have families they've got little children and they're they're solid they're moving forward some are ministers now some are deacons in the church some are Street evangelists uh going out with a courage bold to stand in the Public Square and preach to the people but there's a new generation that has risen up and God wants to touch that generation just as much as he touched the previous generations and I believe that God is doing that now I believe that the same holy ghost that stood on the platform with the prophet and spoke and discerned the hearts of the people is sitting right here this morning in our midst to deal with you and I and to deal with our young people amen and it's time for us just to have a courage bold amen the timid that's good is a natural nature my nothing wrong with a natural timid nature but my brother and sister as Sons and Daughters of God it's a time that we're called to be bold not a time to sit back and say I hope but it's a time to say the word says amen amen and when we enter into the word says it's no longer our natural nature that is controlling us but it is the word of God itself amen now as we look at this today I want to just uh preach to you amen as I I said this title challenged but not defeated and uh you know uh it is what God is working in our life my brother and sister is not just for us to come to the house of God and stand boldly and say praise God Amen and sing the songs but it is for us to be in our time alone in the time of great travail as it would be to be on our own ship on the sea of life and a storm coming and shaking our little ship Amen to be able to stand in those times and be able to say my God is in control Amen to have faith in him and you know we're living in a world that the average Christian is looking for what God can do for them I I like to go maybe I'm a little counterculture forgive me if that would be offensive in any way but I like to go and see exactly you know the prophet of God said that H in these latter times we would see them coming for the oil and I like to just kind of go and take a glimpse into what's happening in their world to see what they're doing and and you're seeing a stirring you're seeing as it is in that context a Revival taking place because the people are realizing you see it over and over and over again if you know where to look people are saying there's got to be more now these are not people that are looking for just some Supernatural event to go woo over but they're they're actually hungry for more but when they come face to face with the more is what we'll show where that desire is or the limits of that desire and so it's there that it's wonderful to go to meet people Amen to meet people that have been witnessed to Once on the street and something in them said I I I need to go and not even getting enough information to know where a church is at and to start just praying you know where where is this that man I talked to on the street where is he who is he where's his church at and then to be somewhere and standing somewhere and just feel compelled to speak and say you know I met these people the other day they described themselves as Holiness and and you know they spoke these words that were special to me and and I don't know where they at do you know anyone like that and they're like their next door and for God to lead them right there my brother and sister we serve a supernatural God don't don't put limits on him amen don't put a boundary on him don't you know we we might put a chain on our dog to keep him from wandering but listen not put a chain on God let God move where God wants to move let God move with the authority that is the word in our hour amen we don't have a watered down wishy-washy message we have a message that came from the Throne of God and it came to you and I let's take a halz of that amen and as we look in the world today we're seeing that the Prosperity Gospel is starting to crack the faade of the Prosperity Gospel is starting to break because even people that were were totally committed to that are realizing that there's something Hollow there something that's not being produced and they have money God's bless them they have nice houses beautiful cars they have all of this but they're still empty on the inside and there's no reason for you and I to be here today and be empty on the inside there's no reason for us to be sitting here wondering what is it and who am I and where am I going and what is going on because God's brought a certain word in this hour but if we're not careful well my brother and sister the attributes and actions of others will cause us to pull back from the promise of God that's promised to you amen maybe it's not promised to someone else but it's promised to you and let's claim that promise amen that it's there that it's our word and you know this idea that came many years ago that Prosperity was a sign of God's blessing was there in sense you can say yes God blesses us but when we take that as an absolute it's contrary to the word of God the real blessing in this hour my brother and sister is when the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into the truth there's a sign that God is present with us and the Holy Spirit is moving in our midst it's not for us to live shallow lives it's not for us to have shallow Revelation I'm not talking about you have to go into deep Mysteries to to find or be in the presence of God but it's not for us to live shallow lives it's for us to live lives or we have an absolute that Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior that Jesus Christ is our provider he is our Castle you might say our Tower of strength he is everything the word of God said he is to us and when we can come and hold unwavering to that we stand this test of time amen you know we're looking I almost feel sorry now don't misunderstand me I'm not speaking condescending but I feel sorry for people here in denomination my brother and sister because you see they don't have a real Revelation and they're still facing the Same Spirit of leoa that you face now imagine you're out here in Leo deil with an absolute uncertainty there's nothing Rock Solid in your life and you're uncertain about politics I've talked to people that were afraid you know this this war in Israel they need to stop it because it's going to spread even greater and and you know this is going to happen and that's going to happen and and and and and nothing will happen unless God said it would amen why be afraid amen go boldly amen oh you say this seems like a paradox for you to say brother Paul but I'm telling you go boldly enough that you buy the house you plant the potatoes you seek a better job be bold enough to go forward and say I'm going to have a family and we're going to press and serve God to the coming of the Lord be bold enough to say these things are natural of life I do not have an inordinate desire for these things it's a natural thing and I'm going to walk boldly in it the spirit of fear is what holds people back I don't know I don't know I don't know well I'll tell you I know I know we have a word for the hour my brother and sister I know where our future is and the prophet of God told us our future is clear amen our future is not bound up in the spirit of leoda but imagine that you don't have that that certainty that would be a scary life that would be a challenge because you see they're under the anointing of leoda without understanding the context of the manifestation of the spirit of leoda you know it's interesting I was listening to a little deal here recently man was talking about divorce and he says you see the EB and flow of our nation he said if I knew nothing else I could just go study the divorce numbers of our nation and I could give you an idea of what's going on in our nation that's right ain't that startling wouldn't have to be a religious man just go over here and get some facts and look at them and he said I can tell you from those numbers and those numbers alone our nation is in a steady decline oh I tell you my brother and sister but if he could ever look at the new birth amen if he could ever look at that new Mar marriage that's taking place if he could ever catch a revelation that there is a bride that is espoused to her bridegroom and that number my brother and sister is growing and growing and growing it's not a declining number it's a growing number amen as more Sons and Daughters of God catch revelation of who they are and step into the vision and step into the promise that number is growing people say but but but but there's people leaving the message my brother and sister the people leaving have have nothing to do with I'm not speaking down to them but they have nothing to do with your salvation that one that says well this happened and that happened has nothing to do with you the promise The Vow is between God and you it's not between you the pastor this person that person that church it's God speaking to you God calling you God claiming you God wanting to slip the ring on your finger oh Hallelujah aren't aren't you happy this morning God my rich Mercy has come amen see they haven't even been taught scripture asks how will they know they must be taught we're not looking for intellectual Concepts we're not looking for educational programs to teach you how to be a Christian this all comes down amen I I guess I'll just warn you all now so you can be prepared we might be a little longer today amen I'm telling you this rode all the way to Belgium and rode all the way back amen so it's got a little time on it but look at it my brother and sister What's Happening Here is without teaching it all right that's why the five-fold ministry I'm not here to defend the five-fold ministry there's a whole bunch of people under that title ought to be kicked out but I'm telling you wherever God puts something down you might say in stone there's a true the prophet taught us about there's a counter we're not going to look at the counterfeit because as the counterfeit counterfeits the counterfeit it gets farther and farther from the truth but I tell you you go back to the truth and you look at the truth and you'll recognize I always was a Son of God I always was a daughter of God I don't care what this does and what that does and the lies that somebody said here and what devil tricked me into this I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God that's the truth but imagine never being taught that there was even a spirit of leoda where you just find yourself buffeted in life and You' have tests look I'm going to be blunt this morning I'm going to tell you right now I don't care who's here and who isn't here God laid this on my heart and I vowed to be bold my brother and sister the day of looking at what Satan tricked you into the day of looking at what someone said about you the day of looking to your flesh needs to be finished am needs to be done our flesh won't get us in a Rapture our flesh will not repair relationships our flesh will not want to get down and pray our flesh will not want to get closer to God it's time sever that relationship amen where the flesh controls your life that's right as I already said I believe Christians are looking for what God can do for them it's definitely a spirit of the age we live in but I'll tell you in spite of the challenges that we Face we need need to be focused on what we can do for God Amen we're Sons and Daughters of God can we say Amen to that have a desire in our heart amen what does that mean that means we're willing to be servants to our Lord Jesus Christ amen if we want to walk on our own my brother and sister that's not submission and that's not being a servant if you walk by your own judgment amen so when your emotion tries to tell you when your knowledge tries to tell you cause it to be subject to the word amen let us be subject to the word this is not oh don't misunderstand me I'm not talking about be subject to the word you must do this and you must do that and you have to have this and you have to have that man we're not a I hope we're not a checklist religion there was a time I grew up under an aspect of the message that was a checklist we're no longer there we've run out of list we've got the word amen we don't need the pen and the paper we don't need to check the box amen look Hallelujah when's the last time you made a mistake let me figure this out about 45 minutes ago illustration only but you see my brother and sister the devil wants you to look at that so much that you never go forward soon as I can go forward I will go forward but we can't go forward cuz we're tethered that's right I'm no longer a slave to sin that's right I'm no longer a slave to fear amen that tether's been cut off I've been delivered amen will that come around yes that's right reminds me of a man I knew he said man Paul uh what do I do we bought a house in the country and it came with a dog I guess it was there and then a week after we moved in it shows up at the doorstep and then it wants to come in the house I made some questions around the neighborhood and they said oh that dog will eat your furniture it'll kill your cats it'll do this it'll do that and they left it on purpose what do I do I said I don't know I can't tell you what I told him here in public I don't know but I wouldn't let that devil in my house that's right he looked at me devil well anything that eats Furniture has to have a spirit on it amen I would get rid of that thing and I would get rid of it on a serious measure um I would know it was gone I wouldn't hope it was gone it bites kids it kills the chickens do away with it I'm telling you my brother and sister it's it's time for us to look around our life look around our house and anything that doesn't bring Harmony and joy and peace and the presence of almighty God needs to get the axe amen that sounds a little harsh don't it but it's not time for us to have a truth with the devil it's time for us to give him an eviction notice with some force behind it amen I want to focus on what I can do for the Lord what I can do for you the body of Christ can I be an example oh you know this is a hard question to ask my brother and sister because we're human and and I I'm definitely not going to ask my wife my granddaughter my daughter son-in-law grandchildren I'm not going to ask them to be the testimony of my good example cuz you see they see me when I'm H hungry no it's not hungry hangry yeah come on you know what I'm talking talking about and the devil tell you your testimony went right out the door with the hangry but did it no cuz we're living in a world of warfare we're living in a world that Satan is constantly attacking and the True Believer recognizes and comes and reinforces that place he doesn't run from it he reinforces it and says Lord forgive me but I'm going to do better and he does Amen aren't you glad that God gives that to you that you can declare to do better and you do amen Allelujah I want to be an example to my peers I I want to be an example to the body as a whole amen maybe we could lift a hand or lift your heart this morning and say Lord I want to be a prayer Warrior I want to make a difference in this body of Believers I want to change the life of my children I want to change the world around me and if I have to become the fiercest of Warriors let me be a fierce Warrior amen I don't want to be one you know go back we spoke to the young people a little bit on the Sunday morning at the convention amen talking my brother and sister about David and Goliath oh we don't want to be the one that stands on the other side of the valley and shakes our sword oh devil but we want to be like David and we want to March right down into the oh you could maybe describe it as a valley of a shadow of death because David had Faith but David did not know the future and he went right down there and David come down now the scripture says he came to a brook and picked up five stones but I'm telling you he came to the River of Life he come right down to the river of life and he met Jesus down there he met Faith down there and he knew when he picked up that that Jesus was with him and he had had faith in the word and he walked from that River of Life and went right out there in the face of the enemy my brother and sister we weren't never called to crawl in the mud and wrestle the devil amen we were called to deal with him at the arms length as it were to say stand your ground I'm here to defeat you today cuz like the old saying says if you wrestle in the mud with a pig you get dirty and he likes it right Hallelujah don't you love the human psych using the word psych over the pulpit probably gets you branded as some kind of weird person but let me tell you I believe in that I've got the mind of Christ Hallelujah not my mind it's his mind he didn't have to come down here and say now I'm going to reshape your mind he I'm going to make you a new creature amen that's got my mind amen are you with me don't want to leave any weird Vibes behind but when we come to that place my brother and sister that we have to resort to saying this that's happening is psychology and that over there is emotion and this over here is this why don't we quit the label and ask God lord if this is what I need to come closer to you then reveal it to me and let me come closer I want to get closer amen man I'll tell you let me put it back to this little romance right here I'll tell you the first time that a young man ever starts paying attention rightful attention to a young lady amen she might like him and she might be wanting to receive that but it's still a change to her to have some young man look her in the face and say I think I love you you have to go process that might process it and say I like that nothing wrong with that right right but you want to see something strange is when somebody expresses their undying love and they hardly even know your name makes me nervous and I'm grown up Satan doesn't care about who you are your heart your desire your direction in life he will tell you how much he loves you till he's got you go stud study the pattern then he turns into an abuser the prophet of God said that if a young man truly loved you young ladies look at me sisters Prophet says if a young man truly loved you and you love someone else he may still love you but he'll be a gentleman and he'll step back from that relationship because he loves you enough to let you be happy now I want you to think about the devil the devil loves you enough to take you but he could care less whether you're happy but my Lord my Lord Lord comes and he speaks to me in so many ways I I could tell you this trip everything we've went uh you know we all have our experience we've went to museums we rode the subway we saw the Eiffel Tower it's not all they crack it up to be amen that big old Arch I'll tell you what I Remember by that big arch in the middle of Paris it's surrounded by hundreds of crazy people in cars people who call you names and give gestures to you and shout and scream and beat on their own steering wheel that's what I remember of the arc or archd Triumph or whatever didn't look like there was any Victory there you see that's what the world we live in I ask a lot of people what do you think about Paris and they're like they're crazy over there but they also call it a gym of the world yeah whose gy Jesus Christ said you're the gy of my world you don't need chaos you don't need crazy you don't need all this you need me amen amen and there's a true Arch of Triumph right there Hallelujah you know there's so much to understand about ourselves I love this the naysayers of the message they can speak down on the message but they can't even Define their own self I'm sorry I I I refuse to accept a critical mass decision from a crazy person am I speaking too blunt this morning I'm sorry you don't even know which direction you're going You're a gyro Chopper out of control I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this but you shouldn't do that no come on that's it come on let's just understand this there's so much to understand of our own self of those around us but let's look at it in spiritual sense I want to know where I fit in the family I want to know where I fit in this body of Christ because when I find my proper place in the body of Christ my brother and sister that only comes by Revelation right amen that you don't just figure this out where you fit in the body when you start trying to figure out where you fit in the body is when the devil starts throwing little things in there and you start thinking Well I this and I that and and I I must not be nobody I must be a nothing or you might think I'm the greatest of all but when God gives revelation we can find ourselves fitting right into this body and we realize this body is not complete without me Can someone say Amen this morning this body is not complete without me I don't care if I'm the least or maybe God would bless me to be one of the greatest it doesn't matter it's not complete without me and I'm going to be part of that body cuz I have a revelation of a complete body that's right amen hallelujah I hope you guys don't mind me bringing this up but it's about time for us to get our complexes out in the open that's right you know what we do as humans we hide that complex people only see a little shadow of our complex we're in Belgium we're talking about dogs and it was kind of interesting conversation you know oh you know little dogs are okay okay big dogs scare me well you realize statistically speaking that little dogs bite more often than big dogs do that's right so you love the biter and you're afraid of the liquor and then a brother brother Johan was like well I'll tell you I don't necessarily like big dogs they got a mouth about this size and one of them wrapped its face around my face and that's why my whole lip and doxing yeah well steal my thunder thing wrapped its face around my face split my lip wide open they had to sew it all together and now he has this and you can tell he has a complex sorry brother Johan he listens to our services big or little does the complex matter big or little come on my brother and sister can I ask you as your friend as your pastor it's time for us to get our complexes out in the open and just acknowledge I have an issue with this I'm not talking about shaming yourself but I'm saying you know what I I've got a complex about this somebody said something about me at one time and I guess I kind of believed them and I I don't want to I I I want to be free of this somebody said you'll never amount to much as a Christian something anchored down it and you go through struggle after struggle after struggle and that echoes in your mind I'll never be much of a Christian but what you don't know is that Christian right beside you who has never told those words still battles the same complex because that is leoda that is the spirit of the age demeaning undermining amen you know do we really have a revelation that every devil and hell's been turned loose against us yes sir I I think a lot of us don't though I think a lot of us can't imagine now let's take gesi he's there and he he tells Elisha we are surrounded yeah I think what we need is a prophetic word to open our eyes amen we have that prophetic word but I think some of us are a little slow at opening our eyes that we look at what's going on in the world and we're like oh Lord come on there's more for us than there is against us it's time for us to say look devil I'm sorry you come to this fight outnumbered amen I'm sorry you didn't bring your best when you came here oh you need to respect the devil amen you need to respect the devil don't don't just act like he's nothing you're going to blow him off the only thing he respect is the word that's right he doesn't respect one other thing but the word that's right amen every lion Spirit you ever meet them yes now this was a little something that I spoke there in Belgium and I hope you can follow this but you know David was out in the pasture with his sheep and a lion come a lion Spirit tried to lie to David but I love that goes back to some child Fable thing every hair on your chinny chin chin he grabs that lion by the hairs of his chin and he defeats that Lon but wasn't there another spirit that come to David out in the pasture what was it have you seen and met the bare spirit I don't want to confuse you but the prophet of God all the way back into 1957 so there'll come a time that it once was we went to them Paris meaning and got their clothes and got their stuff and we have been so demoralized and taken down they now come to us that's right that bear spirit is everywhere they think it's Beauty to Bear it all that's right but David defeated that Spirit also no Doctrine here okay please nobody go away saying brother Paul just introduced a new doctrine in the message but you see my brother and sister what are the odds you're going to meet Al line in your front yard or maybe more so your backyard because you have privacy not very you're not going to meet a bear but there's a lot of Lon spirits around there's a lot of spirits that are trying to get everyone to Bear it all well the only thing that we're called to do is take it to Jesus amen amen I got off track there didn't I amen now look at that Philippians 4:13 says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me do we believe that amen amen we have more Revelation in this age than there's ever been in any age the culmination of Revelation which is a climax and this is not an intellectual Revelation my brother and sister amen and this is not connected to something that's outside of the word in other words extra biblical we don't have to come and dig out some book of astrology or whatever you know the prophet of God God talked about astrology but he didn't make that a foundation of our faith amen he didn't let's say now as long as the astrology all lines up amen you got the Holy Ghost he said no repent and be baptized you get the Holy Ghost don't study an astrology chart don't study what somebody else has got to do people are like well you know the the Magi they were they were led by astrology you know so if if brother brandom's quoting them and speaking that there must be some kind of astrology thing are we far enough down the road in maturity to say you poor ignorant people that's right you think this is what we get out of the Bible prophet of God said find yourself in the Bible he didn't say go over and find yourself in a book of astrology that's right he said find yourself in the Bible and to find yourself in the Bible you got to be in the Bible amen amen it's much better if you just become the Bible you just become the word than and the Lord said I'll lead you and guide you into truth amen now look at this I preached on this quite a bit and you guys will just bear with me but 99 times brother random talks about reading between the lines now not all of this is in an absolute spiritual context but you'll go if you study loud you'll find that the prophet of God's talking about reading between the lines he's making example of a letter from his wife and he's there on the mission field and he opens this letter and in there she's saying well you know Bill I I put the kids to bed laundry is all done and the dishes are all done and I'm sitting here missing you the prophet of God uses that as an analogy to say or show you how it is to read between the lines cuz he knows what she's saying he she he knows what she was meaning when she pinned those words he knows somebody else might read the letter and go oh wow the house is all tidy you know brother bram's not there to enjoy it but uh you know kids are out of the way way and the laundry and the dishes and everything uh now she can just do whatever she wants no no without Revelation you can't read between that line but with Revelation you can read between that line amen and so the prophet speaks of these things and my brother and sister this all ties in had a lovely conversation amen uh with many brothers but our brother David iers I just really had a lovely time but you see my brother and sister when God starts to move you has got moved any of you when God starts to move you in a certain direction God didn't take you so you would go over there and say um I've been here God's got something for you amen God never LED Israel aimlessly in the desert Israel LED Israel aimlessly in the desert but you can study right in the word of God and see that they actually blamed God for their journey in the wilderness that Journey was their Journey that was not God's Journey but ultimately God used it and this is going to be rough hang on we should have installed those seat belts here in the church their parents had to go the way their parents desired to go and a new generation rose up and when jhua spoke to them they had reference point I've been there I saw my grandpa fall in the wilderness I saw my grandmother fall in the wilderness I saw my mother fall in the wilderness I saw my father fall in the wilderness I'm not going to fall I'm going to stand on this word there was a promise that was given God did not change his promise he did not change his word because of your circumstance his word is solid and God said I've got a people that are going to follow the promise and they're not going to follow the circumstance they're not going to look over here and say mom and dad quit I'm quitting they're not going to look over here and say my friends have quit I'm quitting they're going to say this is a promise of God this is a word of the hour for me and I believe it and I'll stand on it so strong my brother and sister so strong it's blunt but I think we're getting to an age that we probably need to be a little more blunt than we've been we need to start calling Sin Sin instead of saying an understanding that's how they understand it I need to keep to my notes now look as we see this my brother and sister I'm going to move forward in First Kings 17 we see under this Elijah anointing amen now remember God may take the man but he never takes the spirit right the Elijah anointing that took place Mount Carmel all of that is right here still today same anointing same power of God the same promise of the word the same obedience on God's part to his own word isn't that amazing God would hold himself to an account that he'd say if I want them to believe it and act on it then I will act on it amen not a double standard I I shared met I appreciate everyone who come down and helped clean the parking lot on my way to the parking lot on Friday to the church traveling down Orchard coming up on an intersection I see a car coming from the left breaks slows down turns the corner never comes to a complete halt in front of me is a sheriff's deputy he comes down to the stop sign breaks never comes to Halt drives through it in the middle of the intersection turns his lights on does a U-turn that's perfectly legal right not in the state of Idaho it's not and then he goes and I'm quite certain he was going to give a ticket to the person who ran the stop sign while he himself is guilty of the same now I'm not talking to people like you I'm talking to you how many times have we judged and we ran the stop sign that's right God help us that's right it's time for us to stand up and say Lord forgive me I'm not going to hide under the cloak of your word I'm not going to hide hide under a cloak of the message I want to live the word I want to be the message I don't want to hide in it I want to be it amen now we look over here in First Kings amen Elijah anointed he's there all that happened now he's up there and it's there that he is enjoying life as much as a prophet can there's always burdens for them to bury uh uh I mean carry um and so God just one day says I'm going to use the natural circumstance of life there's a drought in the land and all of a sudden the brook is just declining until there's nothing and those faithful Ravens where' they go what's happening the Devil comes and says God's abandoned you I felt that in my teens I literally did I'm not even trying to serve God I'm just doing my own thing but I would always put out these little uh I look back on them and think how silly but I'd put these things out now Lord if you want me to serve you let this and this and this happen didn't happen you imagine what would happen if it did Lord if you want me to serve you let this happen next time it's going to be a little bigger let this happen next time it's a little bigger let this happen now Lord if you really love me you know what we'd be com spoiled brats that our whole salvation was built on what God could give us instead God comes to a prophet drives up the brook and the prophet starts to move I don't think he probably was happy praise God I was tired of this lovely Mountain View with my own private cave God moves him he starts down there what is there a Divine appointment aren't you glad God gives out Divine appointments he gave me one time amen he gave you one one time amen a Divine appointment and we see in First Kings 17 amen he walks down into town and you know here's a town that is just forsaken it is desolate there's hungry people there's not history says there was not even hardly the reason there is emphasis in the scripture of her going out to pick up a stick or two is because all the sticks had been picked up it wasn't like a big F pile of firewood out in the driveway she had to go find a couple little sticks to light a fire to take the last little bit of meal and the last little bit of oil and make a little cake for her and her son and her confession was after this we're going to die that don't sound too positive does it that doesn't sound too encouraging but God knew what it would take to catch her heart amen and so here it is Elijah comes and says hey that's fine but make me a cake first now I need to hurry through here so I don't keep you too long but my brother and sister let me just cut this to the chase God was not challenging the natural this was not about dividing the flower and the oil God was challenging her faith to trust him God challenged her can you believe my Prophet can you believe the word for this hour and something oh it's there you see it in the scripture a little turmoil but if I do that yeah but something inside clicked and she goes over here and she takes oil she takes flour she makes a a cake for the prophet what was it my brother and sister it wasn't a natural resignation that I'm going to die anyway I might as well help this guy it was a faith movement it was a challenge to her faith to believe and this is God's Prophet speaking to me saying feed me first give your portion to God first I'll take care of you and so she makes the cake she gives it an imagine oh praise God I can only imagine she goes right back my brother and sister to make a cake for her own self and there's just as much flour as when she divided it to God it wasn't to Elijah she gave that to God God challenged her faith she responded and she gave it back and God said that's fine I bless you imagine how she must have marveled when she went to pour some more flour out and said it down and it looked just as full she poured some oil out set it down and it was just as full oh what was that my brother and sister God challenged her faith amen and she oh Hallelujah she was challenged but she was not defeated amen she stood there and said I believe I believe you realize if God called her right to this day she'd be sitting right here in the church I'm a Believer amen amen I've seen the supernatural I've seen the power of God hallelujah let me cut cut to the chase here amen I love it 1713 he said unto her Elijah said unto her fear not I'm no longer a slave to fear amen did she might not have known those lyrics but she knew the atmosphere where fear was dissolved before her eyes and she said you know what I'm going to follow the word and in following the word she actually saved herself and her family that's it by following the word amen let me hurry and go forward little shite woman a blessing from God Barren and a prophet gives her a message she has a child but one day the child's there he's out in the sun we can analyze it from an intellectual concept and say the boy had a heat stroke but it doesn't matter what he had my brother and sister he said my head my head and is he's there he dies and now imagine I I just experience erience this if you don't mind me being this personal we had four girls with us brother Abel's two daughters M Victoria maybe this backfired on me through the years of claiming Gabriella as my adopted granddaughter cuz I tell you what sometimes you just want to deal with your granddaughters and my own granddaughter oh grandpa as M likes to do all the time I can't even hardly do that brother Paul she did that to me so many times be talking I don't want you to go to oh no we're not going to Paris brother Paul please they went gent twice they went to andp and did you go to bro and Bru what they don't know maybe only guess the whole time of me in my heart I'm not going to tell brother Adam and Sister Sarah we have no idea where her daughter's at I'm not going to tell my own daughter I I have no idea where aiyah is at then they said we want to go to Paris Brother David I submitted all of us under his leadership he's a pastor there pastor and he says no thank you cuz a little bit of this and a little bit of this I would have been going okay instead we went with them and I wished I had enough courage to say no but you see my brother and and sister when it comes to our children it's a whole different realm your baby boy has died I've witnessed it in person people collapsing on the floor crying out no no not this woman tells a servant saddle the donkey take me to the prophet now I'm going to just take a little liberty here I hope you don't mind but she said my son has died and he was a child of the promise given to me by prophetic promise take me to the word that's right need an answer that's right don't saddle your donkey and go answer some counselor out here don't go out here ask the world what they think don't go ask the people that got a popular opinion go to the word amen and she went to the word and when she got there my brother and sister amen the prophet says hey go down and see what her problem is and her answer to that was just take me to the word and when she gets to the word what's her confession all is well oh God help me to have that kind of faith help me Lord to be that kind of Christian to be that kind of an example help me Lord to trust you amen amen and a prophet says okay servant go down there take my staff and she that's it she says I won't leave you I'm not going to leave you I'm letting you know right now that the word is going to go down to my house and the word word is going to speak and my son is going to live oh if we could have enough courage to send the word never leave the word stand on the word knowing that the word will deliver its promise I don't care if you're talking about salvation if you're talking about emotional or mental or it's health I don't care stay with the word the word won't fail you the word won't walk away from you the word won't leave you hungry amen amen hallelujah amen and a prophet goes down and I want to throw this out to you God wasn't challenging the death of a son God was challenging the faith that's right of a daughter of God you realize secondarily she was a mother right secondarily she was a wife that's right first off she was a daughter amen of God amen amen too many would just say well I guess it's God's will she didn't think it was just God's will she that was a prophetic promise to Me Prophet didn't have to give me a child but he gave me a child he let the word be born in the manger of my heart amen amen he's the one who brought the word he's the one that spoke the word word and I'm going to stand on that word that word is not going to die in my possession Hallelujah come on my brother and sister it takes that kind of vow to stand in Le oia the word will not die in my possession hallelujah oh thank you Lord you see her faith was challenged but not defeated amen it's not written but I can tell you inside when she heard those words you're son is dead or she saw her son being dead there Satan was Johnny on the spot Johnny on the spot what did you expect should have kept him under your under your skirt here and made him a mama's boy we sang a song here my interpretation of it when men are men yes they stand on the word amen as men amen they don't run they don't hide they don't retreat they stand as men that's right oh God let us be let us be Lord let us be amen now I'll go quickly here you can find it Amen brother Matthew Watkin shares testimony of a friend of his friend amen you might have seen it it's it's it's shared at uh evening light in Louisiana this man was a minister this man was active in the church and it's irregardless but he was a black man and uh he give up he's dying got huge tumor on his neck are you familiar with it amen now look what happens my brother and sister that man a faithful man of God under the curse where the doctors say there's nothing we can do for you had tumor on his neck there's pictures this is not a story this is life and he had tumors on his legs and the calves of his legs and his whole body was just this big black image and this friend of brother Matt's this brother in the church was friends with him says brother Matt come with me go they go there they're talking to the man and the man says well I never thought it would end this way but I guess this would be God's Will and they sat down and started going into the the word with him amen and if you're not familiar with this go study it out it's powerful they brought up I think even maybe played it on the phone the testimony of sister Elena buts now I hope this doesn't shock some of you but I'll tell you I've just had a transformation in the last while no I didn't go run off jump off a cliff but also as our brother Matt preached to the young people I'm tired of being either in this ditch or that ditch I'm tired of people saying it's either this way is this way well I'm here to tell you there's something right down the center that's according to the word it is the word I maybe don't always understand it but I tell you God dealt with sister Elena and she got down there and was dancing before the Lord she didn't care if there was a congregation seeing her she didn't care who was watching her on the internet the Lord said dance and she danced and some would say oh I don't know about the to dancing well if God said dance I want to dance and if God Says dance I want to see you dance we're not dancing to make a show we're not dancing to be some kind of spectacle but when God speaks and God heals sister Elena and they share that testimony with this man and they're there we just want to encourage your faith believe God Is A Healer I won't go into the whole story they go on some time and then one day that man 's wife calls up brother Matt's friend brother in the church and says I got a picture I'm going to send you and those of you familiar with the testimony will see a man that had goers hanging on his body and looked like he was old in this picture it's quite handsome actually I wished I kind of had that cut that he has and the picture he's standing there this picture of the prime of life God healed me amen oh if you're a message believer God does that if you can have enough faith God will do that but the prophet of God said every bit of faith that you need to make the Rapture is already in you let it be released Lord please release it Lord let me see who I am I'm sorry I'm yelling I'm getting excited I think I must have been excited before I started but his faith was challenged and his faith was not defeated the same God is in this building this morning the same God is moving in our midst the same God that promised I'll take you in a Rapture you'll be my bride that God is here this morning oh the devil will challenge your faith to believe that but I'm here to tell you open your eyes because there's more for us than there is against us amen I don't care what that devil is I don't care what that giant is I don't care how loud and boastful he is I don't care how he tries to bring up your past that's under the blood he is defeated hallelujah hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah Romans 12 1 through3 you know the scripture deals with a Measure of Faith amen Brothers put it on the screen there it is amen but to do God has dealt every man The Measure of Faith amen now only I'm going I'm not even elaborate on this but I'm going to tell you I don't care what the devil speaks to you you you you you you you you about your faith oh if I had more faith heyen I don't care what the devil's telling you God said in his word I've gave you the measure I've already given it to you Hallelujah all you got to do is reach out take possession of it amen amen you can leave the present you can leave the present on the counter and walk away amen or you can say this is God's gift to me that's right that's right right if I had more faith I could serve him if I had more faith I could trust him if I had more faith no no challenge that devil defeat that devil on the grounds of the word amen it's already yours amen it's already yours you don't have to ask the devil to let go of it and you don't have to ask God to give it to you it's already yours hallelujah amen hallelujah your faith is challenged can you say Amen to that but God gave you the measure amen he gave you the measure of Faith take that measure let it be revealed amen our challenge is to believe what if all these other challenges that we call challenges aren't really the challenge that matters did you hear me what if you believe the challenge that's challenging you is the one that really matters when God put it before you as a challenge accept my gift oh brother Paul you just made it too simple is it the gift of the blood gift of forgiveness gift of Salvation a lot of gifts pardon me I don't want to sound irreverent but it would definitely qualify as a believer's Christmas yeah am here's a gift here's a gift here's a gift here's a gift now whose fault is it if we turn and walk away from that gift but if we're not careful we get out here a distance in our lives I've been there I feel qualified to speak about it and you look back and say well if the Lord had only I'm sorry there it is amen everything you needed for life's journey right there that's it but it's God's fault no no no come on that's right let's have enough faith God gives you a gift accept it amen amen musicians if you'll come our challenge is to believe Saints that's one of the greatest challenges say well I've got lust I'm dealing with pornography I got a lion Spirit I've got this I've got that that's not your challenge your challenge is to believe that's it Hallelujah and your challenge in the time of the challenge is to realize God's already said you're Victorious amen that's hard to believe isn't it when you feel like you got all kinds of trash throwed on your head it's hard to stand there and say I believe I'm not done reading the message so I won't even name it but I was just reading where the prophet of God I'm paraphrasing this he says now we all make mistakes and I made my mistakes already this morning whoa I've heard people quoted I wouldn't follow a prophet like that praise God there's a few of us over here that'd be like I relate yeah I relate I understand I make mistakes I have problems I've told lies I've lost it in the flesh oh I said that out loud y come on let's be human let's be human don't be sanctimonious don't be over righteous we're human I've lusted In the Flesh I've lied I've done this I've done that we've built our own chart of the measures of a lie and if they only light light light light light gray they're acceptable can we trust God Amen he said I called you don't listen to anyone else that's right I called you amen that's right just trust me whatever is happening in your life whether you got sickness whether you got sorrow whether you got disappointment whether you got challenges that you wouldn't even want to share to the world nope doesn't matter my brother and sister just trust God that's what God's doing he's calling us just trust me just trust me I said I would lead you I said I would guide you I said I would take you and the work I've again I will finish well you want to know where the Finish is at we got this idea that the Finish is going to take place right here in this flesh and then we'll go in a Rapture well I'll tell you when he said I'll finish this work I began in you that work is when you step from time that's right into eternity as Sons and Daughters of God up to that moment right there this flesh is subject to every Spirit of leod deia subject to the devil's Onslaught subject to our our own fears and doubts but when we can trust God enough Lord I'm just going to take that step of Faith amen oh Jerry Gabrielle Leah help me remember how they sang that song of uh I think it was the first night brother Matthew was preaching how they sang that song they leaped over the wall into a higher [Music]

I ran through the troop and I leaped over a wall and nothing's just the same on the other side of the wall no no they sang that song I leaped over the wall to a higher realm that's right that's what we're doing Saints you imagine we're no longer down here in the valley full of all of its filth and all of its whatever is down there in unbelief and shadows of death and whatever we run and we leap over a wall to a higher realm and then we're running running running come on whoever feels like they're running I don't know about some of Y maybe I maybe I'm just too carnal but I sometimes feel like

bike with no idea what's going to happen when we come down but we'll find out you see you got to be able to be moved by the Holy Spirit if God wanted you to be this Ironclad unmovable person that's what you'd be but he called you and I to be moved as a holy spirit those they're slowly diminishing from our presence but those who have been in the meetings with brother brandham good Godly
