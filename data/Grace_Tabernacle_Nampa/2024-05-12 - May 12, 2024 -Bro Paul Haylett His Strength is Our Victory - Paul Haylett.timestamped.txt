[30:00] Lord just to make us exactly Lord as you
[30:03] would
[30:04] desire amen have just uh first off I
[30:08] want to start happy Mother's Day amen
[30:12] that's just uh a lovely holiday uh we
[30:16] sure appreciate our mothers even our
[30:18] mothers that have passed before us uh
[30:21] have left an indelible Mark upon us and
[30:25] um our dear sister when I come walking
[30:27] out I looked out and I thought my am I
[30:32] seeing things or what but God bless you
[30:34] and welcome back amen God bless you so
[30:38] much amen so just happy uh for our
[30:42] mothers and thank you so much for you
[30:44] know as the scripture says that um it
[30:47] would be our our mothers our
[30:50] elders that would train our young
[30:54] daughters our young
[30:56] mothers uh and to present and you know
[31:00] it lays out a very clear
[31:02] picture um to be passed from generation
[31:05] to generation the example of godliness
[31:09] the prophet of God says you want to know
[31:11] what a church is look at the sisters and
[31:14] uh you know quite a quite a lofty uh
[31:18] responsibility but in a way it's not
[31:20] because see you're just simply living
[31:22] out the word and so you're an example to
[31:25] the younger that the word can be lived a
[31:28] as as a wife as a mother in this
[31:30] generation uh the word can be lived and
[31:33] we thank God for that amen there's not a
[31:36] question of is this possible we know it
[31:41] is possible to live the word in this day
[31:44] I say thank you Lord amen just a couple
[31:48] little things um that I have on my own
[31:51] little list here that I kind of
[31:53] forgot uh brother Sergey will be
[31:56] traveling uh a little later here I think
[31:58] our brother vasile I think we had a
[32:00] prayer request for him out on the road
[32:03] and um uh we want to just remember them
[32:06] as they are traveling the roads we want
[32:09] to remember our brother Victor um you
[32:11] know he's been taken into the Ukrainian
[32:13] Army and and uh I don't personally at
[32:15] this moment know exactly uh what his
[32:18] status is whether he's still in training
[32:20] whether they've done but what we do know
[32:23] is when the Holy Ghost is around you
[32:26] surrounding you that Satan can't touch
[32:29] you and we just want to make sure we
[32:32] lift our brother Victor up because uh
[32:35] fine brother I've been in his home
[32:37] eating at his table enjoyed his
[32:40] fellowship and uh he's just a wonderful
[32:42] brother and uh the impact also in all
[32:46] the
[32:47] Believers uh in in Ukraine and in Russia
[32:50] and any surrounding countries that
[32:52] there's
[32:53] influences uh we want to lift them up
[32:56] amen if that was happen happening to us
[32:59] uh we would certainly covet their
[33:01] prayers so let's be faithful to to lift
[33:04] all of the Believers uh it doesn't
[33:06] matter if they're identified in in a a
[33:08] church we recognize a name or location
[33:11] but simply the believer amen wherever
[33:14] they may be and as we know here in the
[33:16] United States sometimes for
[33:18] circumstances there are those that are
[33:20] you know end up in far away or far out
[33:23] you know um uh places uh and uh they
[33:27] they need our prayers just as much as as
[33:29] anyone else uh and
[33:34] um this just came in as a text I was
[33:37] actually silencing my phone because I'd
[33:39] forgotten and saw this text um brother
[33:43] Andrew boy scout's niece Kesha was
[33:46] involved in an ATV accident and has
[33:49] broken her hip in two places uh is being
[33:53] um uh
[33:54] medevaced uh to I believe Anchorage
[33:58] uh will need surgery so we just want to
[34:00] remember uh Kesha in prayer uh and
[34:04] certainly the Saints there uttermost
[34:06] Tabernacle um and
[34:08] truly brother Chris Brother David myself
[34:11] we've all been there it is the
[34:14] uttermost you know that you are in the
[34:16] middle of
[34:18] nowhere and uh so they they're doing
[34:23] good God's God's great my brother and
[34:25] sister you know in a world uh uh full of
[34:28] um different religions that are very
[34:31] opposed to the message God is still
[34:34] giving such a strong
[34:36] testimony that any kind of wedding and
[34:39] funeral and Etc they want the Believers
[34:42] to come sing because they acknowledge we
[34:44] feel the presence of God and that my
[34:47] brother and sister sisters never been
[34:50] behind the pulpit never preached a
[34:52] sermon but preaching the gospel and uh
[34:55] we thank the Lord for that uh so please
[34:58] remember those requests also and um we
[35:02] have a little mission report uh this
[35:04] morning uh so the church here has sent
[35:08] an offering to uh Vision books which is
[35:11] um that work that brother Barry Coffey
[35:14] uh is kind of behind or kind of uh
[35:18] directing and uh so he had sent out a a
[35:23] uh little notice or request here
[35:25] recently of the printing of
[35:28] 145,000 message books and um he you know
[35:33] it takes special kind of person I'm not
[35:35] sure I'm the guy that could just send a
[35:37] text out to the world and say send us
[35:40] your
[35:40] money but brother Barry has just a
[35:43] unique way of of going about that just
[35:45] reel forward we want your support and uh
[35:49] I just want to let you know that as um
[35:52] as a body of Believers that we have sent
[35:55] a a nice offering uh to the support of
[35:59] the printing of those books to be
[36:02] distributed um you know 145,000 book
[36:05] sounds like a lot but um it literally is
[36:10] just a drop in the
[36:11] bucket um you know the the message is is
[36:15] uh really taking hold uh in those
[36:18] countries where where it would be that
[36:21] um we would think that it might not no
[36:24] message in their
[36:26] language many many of them don't have
[36:28] Bibles their Pastor has a Bible but they
[36:30] don't even have a Bible and uh but yet
[36:34] the truth Finds Its resting place and
[36:37] they're able to take a hold of that and
[36:39] how they Rejoice uh I've seen a couple
[36:42] videos that uh when uh you know
[36:46] sometimes I don't know how how our
[36:48] church would react if people really got
[36:50] speaking in tongues and dancing in the
[36:52] spirit but I'm telling you these people
[36:54] got to getting excited and dancing and
[36:56] happy cuz they've been handed the first
[36:58] Bible they've ever laid their hands on
[37:01] in their life and they're excited and
[37:04] some just I'm
[37:06] sure
[37:08] respectable
[37:09] sisters you know aged sisters you might
[37:12] say Amen not not just that and just to
[37:15] see them weeping as they dance in a
[37:17] circle holding their Bible amen and uh
[37:21] when's the last time you did that that's
[37:23] it we got spoiled amen let's not let our
[37:27] spoiled situations keep us from
[37:31] rejoicing that we have the word of God
[37:35] Amen so amen well we have something very
[37:40] awesome this morning I thank the Lord
[37:42] for this uh uh the Lord blessed our
[37:45] brother Chris sister Kristen with a
[37:49] wonderful little man and um he's such a
[37:52] peaceful child or at least when I'm
[37:54] around him he is I don't know if he's
[37:56] just always that way is just pretty much
[37:59] always that way amen and um so we're
[38:03] going to have a dedication this morning
[38:05] with a slight twist brother Chris just
[38:08] felt upon his heart just prayed about it
[38:10] felt upon his heart and had the desire
[38:13] to dedicate his own son and uh I think
[38:17] that's wonderful in his office as a
[38:19] minister to be able to step over into
[38:23] that and be able to hold his own
[38:26] blessing from God and commit them back
[38:28] to the Lord and so we just invite
[38:31] brother Chris sister Kristen why don't
[38:33] you just drag the children right up here
[38:35] with you amen cuz we're not as
[38:37] individuals right we look at the

[39:19] amen just wanted to first thank the Lord
[39:22] you know we we were always praying for
[39:24] Christen and tough pregnancy but it I
[39:28] was thinking about it and every doctor
[39:30] that checked him every time they checked
[39:32] him he said man he's so
[39:35] healthy so for God to to see Kristen
[39:38] through the pregnancy and then to have
[39:40] the baby born amen just
[39:43] spotless in this thing so um we named
[39:46] him aliser Owen take and aliser means
[39:49] his Scottish and means defender of the
[39:51] people and Owen we named in honor of
[39:54] Brother Scott whose first name is
[39:56] actually Owen
[39:59] but um and Owen means Noble well-born or
[40:02] young Warrior so um we just want to pray
[40:05] that the Lord would harness him at a
[40:06] young age and uh turn that meaning into
[40:12] something for the gospel let's bow our
[40:14] heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord
[40:17] just thank you so much for this gift
[40:19] you've given us Lord Jesus and father we
[40:22] know that uh Satan already is waiting at
[40:25] the door Lord Jesus and but father
[40:27] father you are the one in control you
[40:29] are the one who called us to this
[40:31] position Lord Jesus who called this
[40:33] young man into the world and father we
[40:36] as a gift to us we give him back into
[40:38] your hands Lord and we ask father in The
[40:41] Wicked world that we live in he would
[40:42] grow Lord Jesus to be just like you Lord
[40:46] Jesus a reflection of your spirit a
[40:48] reflection of you father to the to to
[40:51] each one of us and the rest of the world
[40:53] around him Lord I pray you would just
[40:56] put strength into Christen and I Lord
[41:01] father as you would just call us to this
[41:03] place I pray you bless him Lord Jesus
[41:05] now as we dedicate him in your name in
[41:07] the name of Jesus Christ and we give him
[41:09] to you Lord may you have all preeminence
[41:12] in his life and full control we pray in
[41:14] Jesus Christ's name
[41:16] amen amen thank you Lord
[41:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[41:23] hallelujah wonderful what a privilege it
[41:26] is and Amen to to just see another one
[41:31] you know that the Lord has promised and
[41:33] we just believe as this dedication as
[41:35] the prayer is said that he would serve
[41:38] the Lord all the days of his life and be
[41:41] a great example grow up as a young man
[41:44] that the world you know is is so afraid
[41:47] of being different unless it's their
[41:50] different but we want to be different to
[41:53] represent our Lord Jesus Christ The Life
[41:56] of Christ amen let's just stand as we
[41:58] would just go into our thought for the
[42:01] day uh and thank you musicians and thank
[42:04] you brother Alex I always enjoy amen the
[42:08] music God has blessed us considerably
[42:12] amen pray He blesses those that make the
[42:15] sacrifice uh to to uh give themselves
[42:19] amen I want to speak to you this morning
[42:21] on the topic of his strength is our
[42:24] Victory and uh let's turn in our Bible
[42:27] if we would to Psalms 46:
[42:32] 1-3 and uh just pulled in into these
[42:36] thoughts just feel like it's obviously
[42:38] the inspiration of the Lord that he
[42:41] would come and speak to us sometimes you
[42:44] know you can find your your mind just
[42:46] kind of blank you've been pondering Lord
[42:50] uh what would you like us to speak and
[42:53] what would be the thought or the topic
[42:55] Lord would it be something that would
[42:57] Bless the people uh you see my brother
[43:00] and sister I think any true minister of
[43:02] the Gospel any real True Believer uh we
[43:06] we don't want to focus on oursel as
[43:08] though that we have have something to
[43:11] accomplish that we have something to be
[43:13] lifted up about but we're constantly
[43:16] seeking what is it that would bless the
[43:20] body of Believers because when the whole
[43:22] body is blessed my brother and sister
[43:24] and we are identified in that body we
[43:26] are blessed we don't have to go seek our
[43:29] own personal blessing we have a blessing
[43:32] because we are part of this body and I
[43:35] thank God for that today amen Psalms 46
[43:39] 1-3 God is our refuge and strength a
[43:43] very present help in trouble can anybody
[43:45] say Amen to that yes sir therefore will
[43:49] not we fear though the Earth be removed
[43:53] and though the mountains be carried into
[43:55] the midst of the sea though the waters
[43:57] thereof Roar and be troubled though the
[44:00] mountains shake with the swelling
[44:02] thereof silah Heavenly Father we just
[44:05] ask you to be here in this service Lord
[44:08] we thank you for this time to come
[44:09] together as Saints Lord a little
[44:11] sickness has passed through our midst
[44:14] but we rebuke that in the name of Jesus
[44:16] Christ as Sons and Daughters we stand up
[44:18] Lord we claim our healing and believe
[44:21] father that you are looking upon us
[44:23] father smiling and blessing us as we
[44:26] walk in this life
[44:27] father we thank you today and we ask in
[44:29] the name of Jesus Christ bless this amen
[44:33] you may be
[44:40] seated you know I I just was having a
[44:43] little word with sister Jerry in the
[44:45] basement and sometimes you know the
[44:48] devil that Sly old Fox and I sure
[44:50] appreciate the song being uh sung the
[44:52] other day it was beautiful uh but we'll
[44:56] look at this
[44:58] and how Satan would desire to come and
[45:02] the Very things that we believe the very
[45:03] things that we hold dear to our heart
[45:05] Satan would like to come and just anoint
[45:08] a circumstance now this is not an as
[45:11] would be anointing upon our life that
[45:14] would be for months and years although
[45:16] that's possible but just in a
[45:18] circumstance we can come to a place that
[45:21] that we feel as though there is
[45:23] something out of kelter we feel that
[45:25] something's lacking and and we have
[45:28] something we're nervous about situations
[45:30] whether it be with children marriage uh
[45:34] economies Etc that that just weigh Upon
[45:37] Our conscience and and wear at us a
[45:39] little bit and I I think that if we
[45:41] could fully Embrace verse one Amen in
[45:44] all things of our life and just remember
[45:48] in the time of trouble he's our refuge
[45:51] and strength and he is our everpresent
[45:54] amen help in the time of trouble help in
[45:58] trouble and you look at that my brother
[46:00] and sister I think sometimes we we just
[46:02] get a little nervous and we start to try
[46:04] to deal with the situation and
[46:07] unfortunately as the way I'll put this
[46:09] is often times God is our last resort
[46:13] instead of our first that's we should be
[46:16] from the very beginning speaking to him
[46:18] saying Lord I commit this problem to you
[46:21] but the human element and I don't know
[46:23] if this phases you like this but it does
[46:25] me that the human element does
[46:27] everything it can do to try and fix the
[46:29] problem and then when we realize I can't
[46:32] fix this we go to the Lord my how we
[46:35] have that backwards amen that we should
[46:38] be going to the Lord first and there is
[46:42] no second
[46:44] alternative amen and when we'll take the
[46:47] place we say well we have faith well
[46:49] let's have faith enough just hand it to
[46:50] the Lord now that doesn't keep you from
[46:52] praying over that situation uh you know
[46:56] again repetitiously as it were continual
[46:59] that way but there's nothing wrong we
[47:01] see in the scripture examples nothing
[47:03] wrong to come and lay that petition back
[47:06] before the Lord but we're not Beggars
[47:09] you notice Beggars tend to be very
[47:12] repetitious I need you I need you to
[47:14] give me give me give me give me give me
[47:17] that's not how we approach the Lord we
[47:18] approach him as Sons and Daughters we
[47:21] approach him as a promise already given
[47:24] I love the little story about the
[47:26] brother
[47:27] that uh told his son uh that if he would
[47:30] help him do the yard work they had quite
[47:31] an extensive yard he says son if you
[47:33] help me do the yard work today uh you
[47:36] know I'll take you for an ice cream and
[47:38] you can order whatever you want so quite
[47:41] quite large there they labor in the
[47:44] afternoon sun and they get all done the
[47:46] dad is quite honestly he's just wore out
[47:49] and showers and sits down and uh pretty
[47:52] soon you know here comes the son and
[47:55] he's standing there by his dad and
[47:56] finally his dad says uh son uh what is
[47:59] it and he
[48:00] says remember the
[48:05] promise dad puts his shoes on puts a
[48:08] family in the car takes him down for his
[48:11] ice cream you see the boy didn't have to
[48:14] beg his father the promise had already
[48:18] been given and God is faithful amen and
[48:22] we are not here to be Beggars amen amen
[48:26] but you know wouldn't this take away a
[48:27] lot of anxiety in our lives if we would
[48:29] just simply approach the father and say
[48:31] remember father there's a promise and I
[48:34] I'm here to now collect upon the promise
[48:37] now I want your will to be done I want
[48:39] your timing to be done I don't want to
[48:42] dictate those things but I'm here for
[48:44] the promise I'm here to claim what was
[48:47] promised to me amen and so you know as
[48:50] the word says here you know that he is
[48:53] our refuge and our strength and as will
[48:57] do this if we'll realize that we are
[48:59] hidden in Christ there's our refuge amen
[49:02] we shouldn't have to in the time of
[49:04] trouble run to the Refuge we really
[49:06] should already be in The Refuge that's
[49:10] where we're called to stay amen and so
[49:13] as we would be there in the Refuge
[49:15] hidden in Christ uh we realize then our
[49:18] strength is not our own we are not here
[49:21] and going to serve God till our strength
[49:23] runs out our strength is in the Lord and
[49:28] so if we get away from that human
[49:30] element and maybe I'm just preaching to
[49:32] myself this morning but my brother and
[49:35] sister there comes a time that we say
[49:37] Lord I want more faith well maybe faith
[49:39] is just giving it to the Lord amen maybe
[49:42] not you know I laid my hand on it and
[49:43] the supernatural came and so it shows
[49:46] I've got faith how about we have faith
[49:48] by just giving it to the Lord and
[49:50] trusting that what he has said he will
[49:53] fulfill and as this comes we are looking
[49:57] and I would say this as Believers you
[49:59] know uh what separates us I believe a
[50:02] little bit from the rest of the
[50:04] religious world my brother and sister is
[50:06] we have a very very clear promise in
[50:09] front of us we're not preaching of a
[50:11] Jesus Christ 2000 and some years ago
[50:15] we're preaching about the Christ that's
[50:17] in you present this morning living with
[50:21] power amen amen not not just you know as
[50:25] it is just something vag out there but a
[50:28] very real promise that is coming to pass
[50:32] because the word said amen that's all
[50:34] it's got to come down to we don't even
[50:35] have to go back and say well brother
[50:37] brandham said brother Bram said the word
[50:39] said because he preached the word the
[50:41] word said and we're standing here on the
[50:44] promise of the word in this hour knowing
[50:46] that if we will just simply reach up and
[50:48] take a hold to the promise it will come
[50:51] to pass the limiting factor is not
[50:55] God right
[51:00] it's clear that we're relying on God in
[51:03] this crazy
[51:05] age everywhere you look my brother and
[51:07] sister you cannot even hardly go into
[51:13] town why do I use that
[51:17] term you don't have to go out your
[51:21] door and you see the craziness of the
[51:24] world and it's getting crazy by the day
[51:28] and my brother and sister as much as
[51:29] they try to rain the craziness in it
[51:32] just pops up somewhere
[51:35] else you know it it's uh it's something
[51:38] I I share this story was shared with me
[51:41] a secondhand story but uh very reliable
[51:45] source uh um a
[51:48] father his daughter was in school and
[51:50] all this things about identifying as
[51:53] animals and whatnot and his daughter got
[51:55] a set of fuzzy little ears in a tail and
[51:58] she started wearing it
[52:01] everywhere and she says I'm a
[52:04] cat the dad had told her take that
[52:07] nonsense off she saids no dad my
[52:08] identity is a cat finally one day he'd
[52:11] heard enough of
[52:13] this he went to school for a parent
[52:16] teacher meeting and he looked around and
[52:18] there was all these kids with these
[52:20] crazy
[52:21] costumes and he's like what is
[52:24] happening that Saturday day he went down
[52:28] to Walmart bought a tent a sleeping bag
[52:32] a water cooler a pillow some other
[52:36] articles and he asked his daughter if
[52:38] she wanted to go for a
[52:40] drive and he drove up into the White
[52:43] Tank Mountains north of
[52:46] Phoenix they found a nice spot and he
[52:48] unloaded all this and he set up the tent
[52:50] and he did all this and the daughter's
[52:51] like what are you doing Dad she said
[52:54] well cats live in the wild
[52:59] that's right and he says so if you're
[53:00] going to be a cat this is where you're
[53:02] going to
[53:03] live cats also feed
[53:07] themselves he no more got the cat set up
[53:10] and he looked over and the daughters
[53:11] taking the ears off and taking the tail
[53:14] off and looks him in the face and says
[53:16] I'm your
[53:18] daughter now my brother and sister we
[53:21] are not here to take on the spirit of
[53:23] leod deia which is this uh this crazy I
[53:27] won't even go into it today to be
[53:29] definitive but these crazy spirits that
[53:32] are religious Spirits are spirits that
[53:34] are are wanting you to acknowledge there
[53:37] is a God but not acknowledge God and
[53:40] that's what the world is doing today
[53:42] they they'll acknowledge there is a God
[53:43] to be a Christian you have to
[53:45] acknowledge there is a God but they
[53:47] don't want to acknowledge God but my
[53:50] brother and sister we're not here to put
[53:51] on ears and Tails and other identities
[53:54] then call oursel this that and the other
[53:56] together we're here to say we are Sons
[53:59] and Daughters of God which means I have
[54:02] and you have his DNA in you amen
[54:06] directly identified and if we are the
[54:10] word for the day what will be the
[54:12] manifestation of our life the word amen
[54:15] not some crazy outside spirit amen my
[54:18] brother and sister I won't go into it
[54:20] but just recently a little situation
[54:23] where they had a men's Minister meeting
[54:26] and just absolutely the carnality of
[54:29] this world is on display right there and
[54:32] when a man was spoke out against it they
[54:33] called him out of
[54:36] order this the world we're coming in
[54:40] amen and we would look and wonder Lord
[54:42] can this be but you see we're hidden in
[54:44] Christ our refuge is him our refuge is
[54:47] not the message my brother and sister as
[54:49] some would identify it amen Jesus Christ
[54:52] is the message amen but to to identify
[54:56] it as we're not Baptists we're not
[54:57] methodists we're we're the message my
[54:59] brother and sister that's not our refuge
[55:02] our refuge is in Jesus
[55:05] Christ and so it all depends on how you
[55:08] want to identify or use those words to
[55:10] bring Clarity and our strength is
[55:13] definitely not our own amen how many
[55:17] times have we come to a point we just
[55:19] felt like it's Sunday morning I'm
[55:23] tired I I'm just staying home I'm I'm
[55:25] not going to go to church church I I
[55:27] don't feel like
[55:29] it
[55:31] amen
[55:33] hallelujah some of you are smiling how
[55:36] many of you felt that way this
[55:40] morning
[55:42] yeah but it's not because we have a job
[55:45] to do no that's right it's because
[55:47] ultimately down inside of us something
[55:49] says I want to be in God's presence and
[55:53] I want to worship with the Saints amen
[55:55] these are those I believe God has called
[55:57] me to worship with and even in glory I
[56:00] believe that we will be mingling as it
[56:02] is in that realm to to to associate with
[56:05] one another just my thoughts on that but
[56:08] we look at that and there's something
[56:09] down inside of you that reacts in that
[56:12] time of weakness discouragement I know
[56:15] you probably don't get discouraged my
[56:16] brother and sister but discouragement is
[56:18] a tool of the devil amen and he just
[56:21] wants you to believe that it doesn't
[56:23] matter anyhow he'll bring us to such a
[56:25] place that we will actually believe that
[56:28] amen but he is our answer he's our help
[56:32] in this time of trouble and we have to
[56:34] remind ourselves of that you say brother
[56:36] Paul this is seemingly just simple stuff
[56:39] yes it is but if we don't remember to
[56:42] remind ourselves or put ourselves in an
[56:45] atmosphere to be
[56:50] reminded had a brother just reach out to
[56:53] me doesn't live here
[56:56] and he said brother Paul if there's
[56:58] something I can do for you to help you
[56:59] to make your burden just a little bit
[57:02] better you know what I told him brother
[57:04] if something comes up I'll let you know
[57:06] but you know what I should have said to
[57:08] him pray for
[57:09] me just keep praying for me brother
[57:13] that's the greatest help that there can
[57:15] be ever be done you might come to the
[57:17] farm and you might lift a heavy burden
[57:19] or something to help me through that or
[57:21] clean up a mess or mow the lawn or
[57:24] something that's wonderful but what
[57:26] really makes a difference is when we
[57:28] pray for one another amen when we draw
[57:30] the presence of God around one another
[57:34] when we come into that place that we
[57:35] know because I prayed that the Lord has
[57:38] come to church with my brothers and
[57:40] sisters I believe the power of prayer
[57:42] that strongly that we can pray and make
[57:44] a difference in each other's life amen
[57:47] amen and often times we're worried about
[57:49] this I hope this is not offensive but
[57:51] we're too busy praying for ourself amen
[57:54] we're too busy saying you know what I I
[57:56] feel so tired I feel so discouraged Lord
[57:58] I need you to touch me Lord I need you
[58:00] to this Lord I need you to do that Lord
[58:03] I need this but if we'll settle in and
[58:05] start as it were pick one end of the
[58:07] valley or the other end or side to side
[58:10] just start praying for the Saints no you
[58:12] don't got to try and figure out where
[58:13] their bank account's at and where their
[58:15] faith is at and what their circumstance
[58:18] is all you've got to do is get down and
[58:20] say Lord I want you if you would be so
[58:23] gracious come to this house speak to
[58:26] this brother speak to this sister speak
[58:29] to these young people Lord in the way
[58:31] that you choose am and make a difference
[58:34] Lord remind them who they are amen
[58:37] hallelujah am because you see in his
[58:40] strength we find Victory it's not in our
[58:43] own I don't know about you there's one
[58:45] day you know talking about mountaintops
[58:48] we spoke on Wednesday you know there's
[58:50] days my brother and sister you can be on
[58:52] the Mountaintop and in the valley within
[58:54] 10 minutes
[58:56] you can we can run headlong down the
[58:58] mountain oh everything's coming apart oh
[59:01] my marriage oh my children oh the church
[59:05] and next thing we know we're in the
[59:06] bottom of the valley and then we'll say
[59:08] how did I get
[59:09] here but to get out of that Valley
[59:13] requires
[59:14] effort
[59:16] sweat
[59:19] tears boy you guys are
[59:23] quiet maybe we could assure the preacher
[59:27] today how many of you have ran headlong
[59:28] into the valley absolutely yeah
[59:31] Hallelujah and those of you that didn't
[59:33] lift your hand I'm going to raise my
[59:34] hand for you because it's just a fact
[59:37] that we do amen now as we look at this
[59:43] we'll see my brother and sister he's our
[59:44] help in a time of
[59:47] trouble that would be describing a
[59:49] traumatic time or traumatic event and
[59:52] we'll see that it often takes place you
[59:55] know you can have trauma atic things
[59:56] happen in the church in the world and in
[1:00:00] our own
[1:00:01] lives traumatic my brother and sister
[1:00:04] it's traumatic and how many times have I
[1:00:06] seen when you know chaos comes
[1:00:09] earthquakes come tsunamis come that that
[1:00:13] the church fills back up people you
[1:00:15] haven't seen for quite a while show up
[1:00:16] in church because the trauma shakes them
[1:00:20] down to the very core of what they
[1:00:21] actually believe but they don't have
[1:00:24] what it takes to stand up and say you
[1:00:27] know what I'm going to live what I
[1:00:28] believe it's a paradox I believe this I
[1:00:32] just don't have the willpower to live
[1:00:35] it in
[1:00:37] Chile a brother give us a
[1:00:41] very chronological timeline of the
[1:00:44] nature of what happened in Chile when
[1:00:47] they had that great earthquake in the
[1:00:48] 60s the churches filled back up and
[1:00:50] Revival lasted several years but tapered
[1:00:54] away
[1:00:56] and then the next time they had a major
[1:00:58] earthquake the church is filled up again
[1:01:00] but not quite as
[1:01:02] full and it repeated again and again
[1:01:06] what was the year that we were there
[1:01:08] Jerry
[1:01:09] 2010 the
[1:01:12] tsunami swept it was big enough large
[1:01:15] enough we're not talking about a little
[1:01:16] sweep up on the shoreline Saints large
[1:01:18] enough to move ocean liners into the
[1:01:22] middle of the
[1:01:23] city and the people stood in the streets
[1:01:26] and cursed
[1:01:28] God see how the
[1:01:30] transition from the early
[1:01:32] 60s to
[1:01:34] 2010 they went from crying out to God
[1:01:37] for Mercy to standing in the streets
[1:01:40] looking to the heavens and cursing
[1:01:43] God we see what trauma can do we know in
[1:01:48] our own life each one of us would have
[1:01:49] something that we would call A traumatic
[1:01:52] event and it doesn't matter if it takes
[1:01:54] place in the church in the world or in
[1:01:56] our own life he promised in this darkest
[1:01:59] of times he was with us now we either
[1:02:03] believe that he's with us today my
[1:02:05] brother and sister or believe he might
[1:02:07] hear
[1:02:11] us the prophets of
[1:02:14] Baal often wondered about that in the
[1:02:17] scripture how God
[1:02:20] viewed Elijah mocking them yell a little
[1:02:24] louder perhaps he is hunting he's
[1:02:28] traveling he's
[1:02:29] sleeping yell a little
[1:02:32] louder but our prayers my brother and
[1:02:35] sister aren't based the answer is not
[1:02:37] based on how loud we
[1:02:39] pray it's not based on how long we
[1:02:43] pray it's based on our faith that he
[1:02:47] will answer that prayer
[1:02:56] there are those that I have met through
[1:02:58] the years that have been in multitudes
[1:03:00] of brother bram's
[1:03:04] meetings and little things that were
[1:03:06] shared to realize that people who come
[1:03:08] through the prayer
[1:03:09] line when they were standing there in
[1:03:12] the presence of the
[1:03:14] Angel
[1:03:16] believed but had already lost you might
[1:03:20] say their healing their faith before
[1:03:23] they ever got off the platform
[1:03:28] and when the critic would look they'd
[1:03:30] say he prayed for them declared them
[1:03:32] healed but they weren't that's false but
[1:03:37] you see my brother and sister it's not a
[1:03:39] matter of what brother brandham prayed
[1:03:41] and God answering that
[1:03:44] prayer what is our faith right what is
[1:03:47] our belief do we really believe you can
[1:03:51] say in context we're
[1:03:52] healed do we really believe that the
[1:03:55] word is coming and delivered us from Le
[1:03:59] oysa if it's based upon Our Own
[1:04:03] Strength we will be those who have lost
[1:04:06] their healing before we make it off the
[1:04:07] platform
[1:04:09] amen but when we simply have a strong
[1:04:12] faith unshakable unwavering in our Lord
[1:04:15] Jesus Christ it does not matter my
[1:04:19] brother and sister what we see what we
[1:04:21] hear what we feel it doesn't matter what
[1:04:23] the circumstance around us is is we're
[1:04:26] not trusting this flesh we're trusting
[1:04:28] the Lord Jesus Christ am and when we
[1:04:30] hold on to that he said I Am with You
[1:04:33] amen I Am with You amen hallelujah so
[1:04:37] what does it do have any of you I hope
[1:04:39] I'm not preaching too personal today but
[1:04:41] I guess it's kind of my style so but uh
[1:04:44] you know have any of you ever felt like
[1:04:46] you just were kind of bogging down
[1:04:48] beling down just seemed like you know
[1:04:50] one day after another it was just a
[1:04:52] little more difficult than the day
[1:04:53] before and it's like Lord am I really
[1:04:55] even saved you know maybe the minister
[1:04:57] would say something and you're like well
[1:04:59] I don't see that in my life and and you
[1:05:01] start to question you start to ponder
[1:05:03] and you know you just say ah lord I
[1:05:07] can't but then one little thing comes it
[1:05:09] might be in your prayer time it might be
[1:05:11] in a song in a tape in a reading your
[1:05:13] Bible and one little thing comes and
[1:05:16] something gets a halt of you and you
[1:05:19] suddenly find your strength I am not
[1:05:21] going to settle in the pit I'm going to
[1:05:24] rise from this I'm going to believe the
[1:05:26] word I'm going to act on this word and
[1:05:28] something in just a few moments the
[1:05:30] whole atmosphere changes and you look
[1:05:33] back and say now that had to be the
[1:05:35] devil yeah that wasn't me that was the
[1:05:38] devil
[1:05:40] amen do you relate yes sir so look how
[1:05:44] the devil's doing this he tries to cut
[1:05:46] our strength our faith in the very word
[1:05:49] that was placed in you and I in the
[1:05:51] beginning he tries to sever that link
[1:05:54] cuz if he can sever that link than all
[1:05:56] the promises of God that had been given
[1:05:59] Daddy I'm here for my promise amen all
[1:06:02] that is severed and that little boy
[1:06:04] imagine at that age you know 10 12 years
[1:06:07] old and Daddy doesn't buy him the ice
[1:06:09] cream and then the next time daddy says
[1:06:11] son help me do the yard work he's going
[1:06:13] to be reluctant to do that because my
[1:06:15] dad does not keep his promise but when
[1:06:18] we come and take a hold of that promise
[1:06:21] and say that promise was promised to me
[1:06:24] I don't know about you guys okay don't
[1:06:26] take it personal I don't know about you
[1:06:29] but I know what God promised me he said
[1:06:32] I'll never leave you Paul I'll never
[1:06:35] forsake you Paul I'll be with you even
[1:06:38] to the very end and that's my promise
[1:06:41] maybe you have one just like it amen but
[1:06:44] if I can come to the place that I say
[1:06:46] God I'm certain you have forsaken
[1:06:49] me what happen the next time the Holy
[1:06:53] Spirit urges us to do something
[1:06:56] we're
[1:06:58] reluctant maybe evangelists would come
[1:07:00] and say come be prayed for and we won't
[1:07:03] get out of our seat because nothing
[1:07:05] happened last
[1:07:08] time not realizing that we were the
[1:07:10] limiting
[1:07:12] factor but I'll say
[1:07:15] this we have not made it this far on our
[1:07:18] own strength that's right our strength
[1:07:21] as you could see the whole picture our
[1:07:23] strength has run out
[1:07:26] years
[1:07:27] ago well especially those of you that
[1:07:30] have joined the elite club of the over
[1:07:32] well we won't even go to that
[1:07:34] number but your strength ran out years
[1:07:37] ago he's been carrying us amen he's been
[1:07:41] you might say propping us up for years
[1:07:44] my brother and sister not for moments
[1:07:51] years now the scripture is talking about
[1:07:54] Godly counsel
[1:07:58] I like Godly
[1:08:01] counsel amen
[1:08:03] amen scripture tells us that there's
[1:08:06] wisdom in the multitude of
[1:08:09] counsel not just numbers got 10 guys
[1:08:13] eight of them don't know what they're
[1:08:14] doing no that's not the kind of counsel
[1:08:17] you need you need counsel that can look
[1:08:19] you in the face and say now this is what
[1:08:21] the word
[1:08:22] says brother
[1:08:25] this is this where we're at brother amen
[1:08:28] or
[1:08:29] sister
[1:08:31] amen so he's talking that's why the Aged
[1:08:34] mothers are there to
[1:08:36] counsel the
[1:08:38] younger because you see there's times in
[1:08:40] our life we simply don't have the
[1:08:44] experience I'm telling you my brother
[1:08:46] and sister I remember quite vividly the
[1:08:47] first time I ever prayed for somebody
[1:08:49] that just outright had a devil on
[1:08:52] them and I spent about 2 seconds praying
[1:08:55] for them
[1:08:56] and I prayed the rest of that time for
[1:08:58] the Lord to give me enough Faith to
[1:08:59] break through whatever this Spirit was
[1:09:02] and to lay something on that person
[1:09:04] because when you have someone that has a
[1:09:06] demon on them they're not there praying
[1:09:08] the prayer of faith my brother and
[1:09:09] sister they're there if they're in the
[1:09:11] altar it's because they know they're in
[1:09:13] a desperate place and so you can't
[1:09:15] really call that faith and sometimes
[1:09:17] someone has to be able to break through
[1:09:19] right we bind our faith together and you
[1:09:21] break through that spirit and when you
[1:09:24] see that when you see what happens in
[1:09:26] that case a sister going to go out of
[1:09:29] church that day had her mind made up
[1:09:32] already had tied the Rope to the to the
[1:09:35] deck on their house was on the edge of a
[1:09:37] Ravine and already tied the Rope to the
[1:09:39] post of the deck going to go home from
[1:09:41] church and literally when the husband
[1:09:44] and the children are in the house she
[1:09:45] was going to walk out there put that
[1:09:47] around her neck and step off the deck
[1:09:49] made her mind up absolutely convinced
[1:09:52] and you come there and you go to pray
[1:09:53] for them and you're buffing in and
[1:09:55] you're buffing and you're like
[1:09:57] something's wrong here I don't know
[1:09:58] what's going on something's wrong here
[1:10:00] Lord help us to break through we need
[1:10:03] you Lord and you don't know whether it's
[1:10:05] just she's got a health problem a
[1:10:07] marriage problem a child problem you
[1:10:09] don't have a clue but what you know is
[1:10:11] you can't push through it and then all
[1:10:13] of a sudden something
[1:10:15] happens and a little sister goes
[1:10:19] home shoes the children in the house
[1:10:22] takes her husband out and says let me
[1:10:26] tell you this story before I show you
[1:10:27] what I show
[1:10:29] you God delivered me today amen I've
[1:10:33] been set free today that spirit that H
[1:10:36] me the doctor said it was postpartum
[1:10:41] depression call it what you will it was
[1:10:44] a devil that's
[1:10:46] right but God rich in Mercy amen said
[1:10:51] you know
[1:10:52] what my strength amen
[1:10:55] the Lord speaking my strength is going
[1:10:59] to be your Victory
[1:11:02] amen and that sister the next time we
[1:11:04] seen him had been a while down the road
[1:11:06] she was set free complete it wasn't for
[1:11:08] a day a week a month my brother and
[1:11:10] sister but her husband he he he was so
[1:11:14] shaken when he told me he says when she
[1:11:16] took me over there and right behind
[1:11:18] flower pot the Rope coiled
[1:11:22] up that devil thought he had found
[1:11:26] Victory but all he found was defeat
[1:11:30] because that sister is a daughter of God
[1:11:33] Amen and she held to that amen when
[1:11:36] those kind of spirits come in our
[1:11:39] neighborhood in our house in our car my
[1:11:41] brother and sister that's the time for
[1:11:43] us to cry out Lord your strength is my
[1:11:47] victory and I know you are strong you
[1:11:49] are powerful you're wonderful you're
[1:11:52] gracious you're
[1:11:53] glorious you're my God
[1:11:56] God Amen I'll tell you what my brother
[1:11:58] and sister if you want to just get
[1:11:59] carnal aspect he invested in you he's
[1:12:03] not going to waste that investment he
[1:12:05] put the word in you and he said his word
[1:12:07] can never return void so when he put his
[1:12:10] word in you it's time for us to say Lord
[1:12:13] let the word come forth amen not my
[1:12:17] emotion not my feeling not this not that
[1:12:19] you know it's not a conflict between
[1:12:21] this family that family this person and
[1:12:23] that person it's a conflict between God
[1:12:25] and the devil and Christ is in you and
[1:12:28] the devil hates that and because of that
[1:12:31] he hates you but you know I think the
[1:12:32] devil just
[1:12:34] hates you know when you got friends that
[1:12:37] drink two cases of you know I mean like
[1:12:39] a case of beer two two deals of beer
[1:12:41] every night they smoke two packs of
[1:12:44] cigarettes every
[1:12:46] day serve the devil
[1:12:49] Faithfully can you say he loves
[1:12:52] them no sir no sir I think he hates
[1:12:55] equally but he hates you especially
[1:12:57] because he recognizes the word in you
[1:13:00] amen hallelujah Psalm 73:24 this rate
[1:13:04] we're going to be here a while Thou
[1:13:06] shalt guide me with thy counsel and
[1:13:08] afterwards receive me to Glory is't that
[1:13:12] beautiful amen amen the Lord's giving
[1:13:15] you and I counsel today my brother and
[1:13:16] sister because he's setting the stage
[1:13:19] for you and I to be in
[1:13:22] glory it's not for us to be here and say
[1:13:25] well I'm just trying to be a Christian
[1:13:27] and it's so hard and I feel like I
[1:13:29] sacrifice so much what a lie of the
[1:13:32] devil don't use a word of sacrificing
[1:13:35] fleshly lust and not sacrificing that oh
[1:13:38] oh as though you're sacrificing that to
[1:13:40] the Lord my brother and sister I'm
[1:13:42] telling you what you're doing he's just
[1:13:43] flat delivering you of those spirits
[1:13:46] that were T tormenting or demeaning your
[1:13:49] life that's simply what he was doing
[1:13:51] amen Thou shalt guide me with thy
[1:13:53] counsel and afterwards receive me to
[1:13:54] Glory Glory whom have I in heaven but
[1:13:57] thee and there is none upon Earth that I
[1:13:59] desire beside thee My Flesh and my heart
[1:14:02] faileth but God is the strength of my
[1:14:05] heart can you say that with me but God
[1:14:08] is the strength of my heart and my
[1:14:11] portion forever am amen forever my
[1:14:15] brother and sister
[1:14:19] eternity thank you
[1:14:23] Lord a heart it's
[1:14:26] fortified you realize what's fortifying
[1:14:28] your heart yes
[1:14:30] sir what's fortifying your heart is all
[1:14:34] of what God is exactly
[1:14:37] right that's why I love the Book of
[1:14:40] Esther so much that when she went was so
[1:14:44] compelled by the
[1:14:45] word by Christ God himself living a
[1:14:49] Godly uh uh testimony for us to look at
[1:14:52] in this day and when she prepared
[1:14:54] herself she wasn't bed dangled or or
[1:14:57] whatever they call that you know when
[1:14:59] all kinds oh he'll like all the flashy
[1:15:01] stuff she went in there in the
[1:15:03] Simplicity of the Gospel which is called
[1:15:05] Holiness and she presented herself and
[1:15:08] they said Esther if you go in there
[1:15:10] without invitation and he rejects you
[1:15:12] you will never see the King
[1:15:15] again but see she had a different
[1:15:17] Revelation she knew who she was and that
[1:15:20] Revelation played itself out right there
[1:15:23] when he saw her he didn't look at her
[1:15:25] and say there's a queen he looked at
[1:15:26] that and said that's my wife and my wife
[1:15:29] is a part of
[1:15:31] me and he wasn't worried about common
[1:15:33] law state laws or divorce
[1:15:37] court she comes and he says I give to
[1:15:42] you half right let's put this in the
[1:15:46] right context not half of everything I
[1:15:49] own this and that and that and that
[1:15:53] and I give you half of who I am
[1:15:58] amen amen half of who he
[1:16:02] was now my brother and sister the Holy
[1:16:05] Ghost has been poured out we're standing
[1:16:08] here with absolutely a husband's promise
[1:16:13] to a
[1:16:16] bride amen and we'll settle for a
[1:16:19] portion of
[1:16:22] that we settle for
[1:16:26] a token amount a
[1:16:29] percentage let's settle for all that God
[1:16:32] promised amen that's right amen he
[1:16:34] promised I'll give you the Holy Ghost
[1:16:36] and I'll fill you and not only the
[1:16:38] things that I do but you shall do these
[1:16:42] also amen and when you translate those
[1:16:45] words they say it means and
[1:16:51] more can I give you an ouch you still
[1:16:53] love me
[1:16:55] are we pressing into that that's
[1:16:58] question are we pressing to the place
[1:17:01] that all that Jesus Christ is that's it
[1:17:05] amen we're taking the portion granted to
[1:17:10] us amen now the prophet comes along and
[1:17:13] says if you go out to the ocean and you
[1:17:16] dip one little scoop or Dipper of water
[1:17:19] out of the ocean it has every quality
[1:17:22] every mineral everything that's in the
[1:17:25] ocean is in that little portion and I
[1:17:29] say my brother and sister Lord help me
[1:17:31] and I'm speaking to Paul this morning
[1:17:33] but I think that we have come along and
[1:17:36] said that portion is not for me and I
[1:17:38] can't live this portion and this one
[1:17:40] here I felt before or experienced before
[1:17:43] but it just seems too much for someone
[1:17:45] in my position my brother and sister
[1:17:47] drink the picture amen drink it drink
[1:17:51] the water of the word amen take that
[1:17:54] portion because his strength is our
[1:17:58] Victory sir we don't need the whole
[1:18:00] ocean we don't need to travel the world
[1:18:02] we don't need to be able to stand up and
[1:18:04] say I have such great faith I don't even
[1:18:06] want that to be in my vocabulary I just
[1:18:09] want it to be that's my husband and I'm
[1:18:12] going to go to my husband and he's not
[1:18:14] going to reject me or throw me away he's
[1:18:17] going to say come even to the half of my
[1:18:20] kingdom to the half of who I am because
[1:18:24] the these two are one amen that's it
[1:18:27] right where do we sever the line where
[1:18:30] do we say well I'm a pretty good
[1:18:32] Christian or I'm almost a Christian or
[1:18:34] I'm trying to be a Christian you are a
[1:18:36] Christian because Christ is in his body
[1:18:40] he's in his church he's in his word he's
[1:18:43] in
[1:18:45] you well I don't think I have enough
[1:18:47] faith for the Rapture you don't even
[1:18:49] know how much faith it takes for the
[1:18:50] rapture
[1:18:57] remember kids when we did the corn in
[1:18:59] the little egg
[1:19:02] cups a cotton ball not even
[1:19:07] dirt put the seed in the cotton
[1:19:10] ball so is the
[1:19:12] life this could be an arguable question
[1:19:16] is the life in the
[1:19:18] dirt is the life in the
[1:19:21] water the life is in the sea that's
[1:19:25] right Hallelujah and when he put that
[1:19:27] seed in you he didn't say well you're
[1:19:29] going to be a cotton ball
[1:19:33] Christian you're going to be a kitchen
[1:19:35] sink faucet Christian he said I put the
[1:19:38] life in you I'll make sure the life
[1:19:41] comes forth and
[1:19:43] produces hallelujah
[1:19:47] amen I'm getting lost
[1:19:50] here you see
[1:19:53] is oh your heart anybody got a
[1:19:57] heart you've heard the phrase Through
[1:19:59] The Years you know somebody does
[1:20:00] something kind of mean have a heart
[1:20:02] makes you wonder sometimes do people
[1:20:04] really have a
[1:20:05] heart but you see our heart is fortified
[1:20:08] by all that God is that's right it's not
[1:20:10] fortified by the church we attend not
[1:20:12] fortified by the pastor that we're so
[1:20:14] impressed with we're not fortified by
[1:20:16] this that and the other our list of
[1:20:18] friends that's right my brother and
[1:20:20] sister our heart is fortified by Christ
[1:20:23] himself amen you see his
[1:20:27] counsel now we already know I already
[1:20:29] spoke it today that his counsel a Godly
[1:20:32] Council right a multitude of Godly
[1:20:34] counsel but my brother and sister his
[1:20:37] council is not group think that's
[1:20:42] exactly we think the prophet meant
[1:20:45] this I tell I don't know what your
[1:20:47] experiences are in life but I've sat in
[1:20:48] a chair before set around a table before
[1:20:51] and had someone make a statement like
[1:20:53] that
[1:20:55] well that's what the prophet
[1:21:04] thought when the prophet said those
[1:21:06] words he included
[1:21:09] scripture so you're saying that's what
[1:21:11] the scripture thought that's it and then
[1:21:15] it struck
[1:21:16] me they're
[1:21:19] right they're
[1:21:22] right because the word discerned the
[1:21:24] thought that's right of the
[1:21:28] heart and their view which the message
[1:21:33] is correct as long as it matches my
[1:21:38] thinking well we got a train wreck
[1:21:40] coming I can see it mhm that's right yep
[1:21:45] got a train wreck
[1:21:46] coming now we got to
[1:21:50] hurry okay what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:21:53] for let's just go right here and just
[1:21:56] touch on that now the purpose what was
[1:21:59] God's purpose in sending the Holy Spirit
[1:22:02] now I would Mark that down John 14
[1:22:03] beginning at the 14th verse reading
[1:22:05] through the chapter for the basis God's
[1:22:07] purpose we find here in sending the Holy
[1:22:09] Spirit was one purpose let's get this
[1:22:12] right what the holy spirit's for Holy
[1:22:14] Ghost for one
[1:22:16] purpose that God himself might dwell in
[1:22:19] his church and continue his plans
[1:22:22] through amen is it okay okay if I change
[1:22:25] this quote just for a moment through you
[1:22:28] that's right amen no not the Holy Roman
[1:22:31] whatever my brother and sister and not
[1:22:32] the first church of this and not the
[1:22:34] first church of there but he's coming to
[1:22:38] uh continue his plans through you the
[1:22:41] church amen you are the church amen not
[1:22:44] a building somewhere that God was in
[1:22:46] Christ continuing his plans through
[1:22:48] Christ out of Christ into the church
[1:22:51] continuing his work through the church
[1:22:53] now we know what the holy spirit
[1:22:56] is
[1:22:58] amen but I've met people in the message
[1:23:01] who don't know what the holy spirit is
[1:23:03] because I've been told to my face that
[1:23:04] the holy spirit is not
[1:23:10] God you would think every one of us
[1:23:12] around the message would have enough
[1:23:17] Revelation but be told right to your
[1:23:20] face it's not
[1:23:23] God okay
[1:23:25] moving on now we know what the holy
[1:23:28] spirit is we found out last night that
[1:23:30] it's God Amen I don't know if it gets
[1:23:33] any pler than that do I need to
[1:23:35] underline that do I need to shout it a
[1:23:36] little louder make them rewind the deal
[1:23:38] and we'll record it again and again and
[1:23:40] again that the holy spirit is God that's
[1:23:43] right Hallelujah now you might wonder
[1:23:45] why I would use that quote well just
[1:23:47] hang on okay and now we move into the
[1:23:50] very next one out of that a little
[1:23:52] farther down may we say it like like
[1:23:54] this all that God was he poured into
[1:23:57] Christ because he emptied himself amen
[1:24:01] amen now we could stop see the word and
[1:24:04] can denote a pause in there before
[1:24:07] continuation and so it says that he
[1:24:09] emptied himself
[1:24:27] I've changed my
[1:24:30] mind you can't get it
[1:24:34] back so even if God wanted to take it
[1:24:39] back the pause in
[1:24:43] time of the pouring
[1:24:49] out I'm going to pour myself into you
[1:24:52] brother Trevor the Lord
[1:24:59] I've changed my
[1:25:00] mind how's he going to get it
[1:25:04] back he can't he doesn't want
[1:25:08] to that's why when you were in him
[1:25:11] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:13] there's no space of time to come down
[1:25:16] here and say I guess I've decided you're
[1:25:19] not the bride of Christ after
[1:25:22] all it is poured out Can someone say
[1:25:27] thank you Lord thank you Lord that it's
[1:25:30] not my weakness not my failure not my
[1:25:33] insecurity and complex it's not my
[1:25:36] station in life you poured it out and
[1:25:38] Lord you poured it into me oh
[1:25:42] hallelujah thank you
[1:25:45] Lord
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:50] amen he emptied himself and poured it
[1:25:52] into Christ and Christ was a fullness of
[1:25:54] the godhead bodily all that Jehovah was
[1:25:57] he poured into Christ and all that
[1:26:00] Christ was he poured into the church not
[1:26:04] into one
[1:26:06] individual see that's why we have an
[1:26:08] issue around the message where people
[1:26:10] say no no this was just poured into
[1:26:12] brother
[1:26:13] brandham the rest of you are just
[1:26:15] nothings that's not what the prophet
[1:26:17] said amen he poured it into not one
[1:26:21] individual but into this body of
[1:26:23] believers amen that we as body of
[1:26:26] Believers can look at the word and
[1:26:28] equally say that word was for me that's
[1:26:31] your promise father and I've come today
[1:26:35] for my promise that you gave me Lord
[1:26:41] hallelujah I love this not into one
[1:26:44] individual but into the entire body amen
[1:26:47] hallelujah you know what that means
[1:26:49] whether we have those men that maybe
[1:26:52] have a little deeper Revelation on
[1:26:54] certain things they have the the well I
[1:26:58] hate to even use the word mind but if
[1:27:00] you'll bear with me they have the mind
[1:27:01] to
[1:27:03] understand certain things a little bit
[1:27:05] better they can grasp it a little bit
[1:27:07] better there's things my brother and
[1:27:09] sister in the word that I just say Amen
[1:27:12] to CU I just don't know maybe I haven't
[1:27:15] given it enough time enough study but
[1:27:17] then I don't want to become an intellect
[1:27:19] right that's right amen have a
[1:27:21] chalkboard the length of that wall and
[1:27:23] start writing out formula to come out
[1:27:25] with a fact of something I can just say
[1:27:27] I believe
[1:27:28] that I don't need to explain it I don't
[1:27:30] get into heaven because I can explain it
[1:27:33] I get into heaven because I believe it
[1:27:35] amen and so it's there you'll have those
[1:27:38] that have that that understand I'm going
[1:27:40] use the word intellect if you don't mind
[1:27:41] they have can grasp that they're smart
[1:27:44] people hope that doesn't sound like an
[1:27:46] insult to anyone here today but there's
[1:27:48] a lot of smart people in this church but
[1:27:50] some of us still get in Hallelujah
[1:27:54] without that my brother and sister
[1:27:55] there's a glitch in the hardware of my
[1:27:58] IQ but it doesn't matter because I can
[1:28:01] say Amen to that word and that's
[1:28:03] actually really the Revelation is in
[1:28:06] saying Amen to the
[1:28:09] word
[1:28:11] amen not to an individual but in entire
[1:28:14] body now it's right there on the
[1:28:18] screen there where we come together in
[1:28:22] unity we have power that's
[1:28:27] right is Unity that you all agree with
[1:28:30] the
[1:28:30] pastor no is Unity that we all agree
[1:28:34] with
[1:28:37] committee Unity is that we have an
[1:28:41] agreeance with the Holy Spirit that's
[1:28:43] right and that's where he says when we
[1:28:48] come if you don't mind me inserting this
[1:28:50] in when we come in harmony with the Holy
[1:28:55] Ghost that's where we have
[1:29:04] power I'm sorry to bring these things up
[1:29:06] but they're
[1:29:07] just reminds me of a man I interacted
[1:29:11] with him a fair amount period of
[1:29:16] time his church was he used to say my
[1:29:18] church is in harmony with
[1:29:21] me my church is in agreeance with me
[1:29:25] and when he quit the
[1:29:27] message they all quit the message whose
[1:29:30] Revelation did they
[1:29:33] have they certainly didn't have the Holy
[1:29:36] Ghost because
[1:29:39] today if it's got wings and flies it's
[1:29:43] good it don't
[1:29:45] matter now look my brother and sister
[1:29:47] you say why do you bring that up brother
[1:29:49] Paul because I'm telling you it ain't
[1:29:51] you ain't you it ain't you did you guys
[1:29:53] catch that
[1:29:54] it's in the dictionary
[1:29:56] now it ain't you and me agreeing it's us
[1:30:02] agreeing with him amen right and that's
[1:30:05] as the prophet of God says where we have
[1:30:09] power amen so this is where you and I
[1:30:13] come to the place that his strength
[1:30:16] becomes our Victory because it's no
[1:30:19] longer you and I but it's him Christ in
[1:30:22] you the hope of glory bringing it to
[1:30:25] pass amen but whether it's planted the
[1:30:28] seed in soil or cotton ball it must have
[1:30:34] water the life has to be in the seed
[1:30:36] amen but it's got to have something
[1:30:38] external and if you have a church
[1:30:40] without the Holy Ghost you have a
[1:30:42] relationship with Jesus Christ without
[1:30:44] the Holy Ghost it will ultimately die
[1:30:48] that's
[1:30:49] right hopefully that wasn't too
[1:30:52] blunt now now coming along here you
[1:30:57] know Christ outpouring himself into a
[1:31:00] body of
[1:31:01] Believers when we come together in this
[1:31:03] Unity we have power as a
[1:31:06] body in other words what that says when
[1:31:09] I believe that every word the prophet
[1:31:11] said not every word in the context some
[1:31:13] people would take it but every word of
[1:31:16] the
[1:31:19] word it's not I have
[1:31:22] power and you don't or you have power
[1:31:24] and I
[1:31:25] don't this is a body being Drawn
[1:31:28] Together by The Very fact that we are
[1:31:33] the same amen now I don't know if you
[1:31:35] guys have looked in a mirror lately but
[1:31:37] I I don't hardly
[1:31:39] find much similarity between most of us
[1:31:44] my daughter Jolin when I joke with her
[1:31:46] that she got switched at the hospital
[1:31:48] she says that's an impossibility then
[1:31:50] she points to her nose and says and
[1:31:52] here's the evidence
[1:31:59] so you see what God's
[1:32:02] doing he's drawing every one of us
[1:32:06] pulling us in in in in in in and you
[1:32:13] know what that is it's called refining
[1:32:16] right he's the fire yeah and the
[1:32:19] pressure believe it or not can be used
[1:32:21] right out of Leo deia right out of Leo
[1:32:24] de seea the pressure absolutely but it
[1:32:27] needs fire and the Holy Ghost fire comes
[1:32:29] down that's why you're different than
[1:32:31] the rest of the world
[1:32:35] Amen I maybe have a button excuse me
[1:32:40] here now look I I want you to go right
[1:32:43] here expectations look what brother
[1:32:45] Brown says here now I I I've just as you
[1:32:47] know anyway I I shouldn't I don't need
[1:32:49] to worry about explaining
[1:32:51] it don't look to symptoms if you look to
[1:32:54] sisms you're sure to be lost any man
[1:32:57] anytime who looked to the Natural Things
[1:33:00] always lost their
[1:33:06] Victory that's it now I'm going to make
[1:33:10] a statement you might think it was a
[1:33:11] little contrary this come from an old
[1:33:13] guy that I knew years ago Guy full of
[1:33:16] wisdom failed many things in life and
[1:33:19] still in the end come out ahead and he
[1:33:22] used to say this to me it's like Paul
[1:33:25] did you shop for prices he's a farmer
[1:33:27] did you shop for prices and I'd say no I
[1:33:30] do business with him he said well let me
[1:33:32] just remind you Paul nobody Minds your
[1:33:35] business better than
[1:33:40] you pretty good if you don't agree
[1:33:43] please give me your credit card and
[1:33:44] checkbook after church and we'll see if
[1:33:47] I can mind your money as well as you
[1:33:49] mind your
[1:33:50] money and some of you I might do better
[1:33:53] actually
[1:33:57] yeah my wife doesn't call me cheap for
[1:33:59] no reason at all amen now look at
[1:34:03] this let me turn this over here and
[1:34:05] morph
[1:34:07] this nobody's going to mind your
[1:34:09] spiritual
[1:34:11] position better than
[1:34:19] you if you're spiritually
[1:34:22] bankrupt don't blame me
[1:34:25] me cuz I don't hold the key to your
[1:34:28] spiritual
[1:34:29] life you
[1:34:31] do but we'll find that when we move into
[1:34:34] the correct
[1:34:36] position his strength almost immediately
[1:34:40] becomes our Victory
[1:34:42] amen have you ever noticed the more you
[1:34:46] pray the better people
[1:34:48] look right H that's right anybody brave
[1:34:52] enough to lift a hand and say I I have
[1:34:54] been there the more I pray the more
[1:34:57] everybody in the church looks like a
[1:35:05] Christian I'm going to get serious for a
[1:35:07] moment here as we come
[1:35:10] close I want you to stop and Ponder what
[1:35:12] is it you need victory over
[1:35:16] today just stop for a moment cycle that
[1:35:20] through your own
[1:35:21] Consciousness what is it I need victory
[1:35:24] over
[1:35:29] today are you overcoming it or is Christ
[1:35:33] in you overcoming
[1:35:36] it if you're trying to overcome it
[1:35:40] you're just
[1:35:41] subduing the
[1:35:43] temper right the lust of the flesh the
[1:35:46] pride of
[1:35:48] life the Love of Money whatever that
[1:35:52] might be
[1:35:53] you're trying to subdue it right but his
[1:35:57] strength that's right are you with me
[1:36:00] that's right his strength is your
[1:36:03] Victory amen not your
[1:36:06] strength that's right amen that's right
[1:36:09] Hallelujah now you want to
[1:36:11] know tie some thoughts together here as
[1:36:13] we
[1:36:16] close Samson did a lot of things under
[1:36:19] that Nazarite vow
[1:36:24] and when Samson
[1:36:28] backslid everything looked like it was
[1:36:30] done his eyes are
[1:36:33] gone but Revelation had already been in
[1:36:35] him he already knew what Revelation was
[1:36:37] he didn't have to go find
[1:36:40] Revelation now I want you can you put
[1:36:42] your can you put your vision cap
[1:36:46] on he's out there pushing that
[1:36:51] grindstone physically I'd say he
[1:36:53] probably got to be a pretty strong man
[1:36:55] pushing that thing around in a
[1:36:59] circle I wonder how many people would go
[1:37:01] to the fitness club today if they went
[1:37:04] in there and there was a grindstone and
[1:37:05] they said oh pay us 50 bucks a month you
[1:37:07] can push
[1:37:11] this but brother Brown talks about that
[1:37:13] one little
[1:37:15] hair popped
[1:37:19] out and something see it wasn't that
[1:37:22] hair no
[1:37:24] this where the legalism in the message
[1:37:26] has missed
[1:37:27] it it wasn't that hair it was The Vow
[1:37:32] associated with it yes sir that's right
[1:37:35] amen that's right and when that one
[1:37:36] little hair popped out we have no
[1:37:39] recording of Samson's prayer and
[1:37:42] testimony and confession to God but I
[1:37:45] tell you that one little sprig of faith
[1:37:47] that popped up oh when I get more faith
[1:37:50] I'm going to be an overcomer no you're
[1:37:52] not
[1:37:54] no you're not because you're measuring
[1:37:56] your faith by your intellectual
[1:37:59] conception when you look at that and say
[1:38:02] that promise is true in Samson Now
[1:38:04] understand this is just the way I see it
[1:38:06] Samson's pushing that thing around and
[1:38:08] he's like wow my hair's coming
[1:38:13] back how long could it
[1:38:16] be now you Brothers can actually grow a
[1:38:19] beard but no I've seen Brothers I've
[1:38:22] seen them in the morning morning they
[1:38:23] shaved and I've seen them in the
[1:38:25] afternoon and they already had more fuzz
[1:38:27] on their face I can grow in a
[1:38:32] week but I can see
[1:38:35] Samson I remember a promise my daddy
[1:38:38] made
[1:38:39] me I
[1:38:41] remember what he spoke to
[1:38:47] me and in the
[1:38:49] end he was greater than in the beginning
[1:38:54] and I don't care what the devil has done
[1:38:55] to you spoke to you tripped you up lied
[1:38:59] about you lied to you about
[1:39:01] you in the end you're going to be
[1:39:04] greater than ever in your life because
[1:39:09] we measure Faith by our carnal thinking
[1:39:14] God measures faith I can produce a quote
[1:39:17] if you want it by looking at the heart
[1:39:20] that's right God said there it is in the
[1:39:23] heart
[1:39:24] and my strength this the Lord speaking
[1:39:26] if you don't mind Paul putting it this
[1:39:28] way my strength is in their heart amen
[1:39:34] they believe that's it and we are the
[1:39:37] Overcomers that's right my brother and
[1:39:39] sister amen if you musicians would
[1:39:45] come once again I want to come back I
[1:39:47] want to ask you what do you need victory
[1:39:49] over
[1:39:50] today I don't care what the situation is
[1:39:52] it be a natural situation that you need
[1:39:56] help amen but if you just let your heart
[1:39:59] reach out to the Lord today amen just
[1:40:02] lift your heart up to the Lord and say
[1:40:03] Lord you know my need now father
[1:40:06] whatever faith I need I'm just going to
[1:40:08] speak in your name because you the one
[1:40:10] who made the promise I never promised
[1:40:13] myself healing I've never promised
[1:40:16] myself overcoming power I've never
[1:40:18] promised myself Victory but I can look
[1:40:22] to my father that's right and he has
[1:40:24] over and over and over made promises and
[1:40:28] I'm here today by God's grace maybe you
[1:40:30] would call that Faith to be able to come
[1:40:33] and stand there not not rude
[1:40:37] right not the one that barges in jumps
[1:40:40] in the deal and grabs dad by the face

[1:42:23] babied a little bit amen but I'm sure
[1:42:27] glad I'm not a baby any
[1:42:31] longer I was in the store with Jerry the
[1:42:33] other day and this is where this thought
[1:42:34] come to me sorry my thinking so far out
[1:42:37] there but I saw a grown man with two
[1:42:40] boxes of diapers under each arm walking
[1:42:43] through the middle of
[1:42:44] Costco and I don't know why I thought
[1:42:47] this and Lord forgive me but I thought
[1:42:49] are those for him or does he have a baby
[1:42:50] he looked a little old
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:01] sorry about saying
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:09] that how much more embarrassing would it
[1:43:12] be that we had to carry that box into
[1:43:15] the house of
[1:43:18] God H you won't forget that thought for
[1:43:22] a while
[1:43:23] sorry sometimes there is value in
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:28] shock but you see we come into the house
[1:43:30] of God needing to be
[1:43:32] pampered that's but we don't have a
[1:43:35] box we just want the preacher to talk
[1:43:39] about how God sent a prophet and we're
[1:43:41] all going in a
[1:43:42] Rapture and it's all going to be so good
[1:43:45] won't it be glorious there but the
[1:43:48] prophet of God said it's going to be the
[1:43:51] Christian that's going to be the most
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:55] disappointed the drunk the dancer
