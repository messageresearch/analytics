we look upon his wonderful face and it brings a security it brings a comfort it brings a peace cuz I can tell you we look into the world we live in today and there is no security there is no Comfort there is no peace it is Satan's Eden and um Satan is just chaos he he knows how to stir up and tear up but he doesn't know how to rebuild and repair and restore we look at this and realize how blessed today that we are as Sons and Daughters of God that no matter what is the issue of our life today our lord Jesus is here he is our peace he is our comfort he is our healer he is our savior he is our bridegroom amen and to me that that is just such a wonderful wonderful feeling you know I don't know if you ever come to the place in your life that a day a week a month feels like a tornado but in those times right there we need a savior we don't need religion we don't need a place to go we don't need a beautiful choir what we need is our Lord Jesus amen to come and comfort us and just put his arms around us and [Music] love us amen our brother Manassa sent uh text to me this morning got some decisions some things happening in his life and uh just sends greetings to your church says he loves you and I believe him and um he uh just ask for prayer for the Lord to just give him wisdom on on what direction in his life so let's be faithful remember uh our brother manasse in prayer and um I don't think she's maybe still in the sanctuary but brother Gideon's friend Lily um many of you would have saw what we posted the other day um please be in prayer I'm believing God's going to change her life and Lily if you can hear me and no doubt you can amen we're believing God's going to change your spiritual life amen those things that you spoke the other night that made the devil mad amen I believe God will bring them to pass the hunger in your heart The Emptiness that's there I believe he'll feel that and we want to bind that Spirit of epilepsy it's nothing but a demon and we want that demon bound and put back where he belongs let's pray for that let's hold that up amen and uh so I think Lily's already figured out that I'm a little bit forward but um the thing is is she's also a little forward so maybe she'll understand that amen please pray for us we'll be in Florida uh not a vacation but not overly worked um uh brother Danny has asked us to minister Wednesday night and uh Sunday morning Sunday night uh and uh just in case any of you are actually feeling like that we're just going to have a really good time it's raining right now in Florida so anyway um let's turn in our Bibles I want to speak you tonight today uh let go and let God have his way amen and I probably will speak a little direct this morning and I trust that you won't mind amen and speaking of direct sister Dorcas I've been praying for you amen I've been amen it's interesting how God works sister Dorcas I want you to understand this God has valued my prayers for you more than he has valued my sleep and I say thank you Lord to wake up in the middle of the night you cannot sleep and God just lay individuals on your heart and be able to just enter in for them and um I I just say God bless you we're lifting you up amen each and every one of you I I I you know just kind of have to to remember everybody I just have to start the front or the back and just go down every Pew and pray for you where I remember you sitting amen so let's turn in our Bibles this morning a little bit different scripture maybe I hope you can catch our Anchor Point but r Romans the 3r chapter veres 1-4 some of the things that brother Isaac voiced right here resignate with me out of these scriptures right here and um we just Saints Lily's in the back room showing the signs of those little seizure type things right at this moment let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we come before you we know that Satan is mad because Lily is in the house of God this morning but father we are here knowing that the Great I Am the deliverer Our Savior our healer is here this morning and father we're asking you now just to go in touch Lily Lord Jesus bind that Spirit father that would try to cast its spell upon her Satan you are bound in the name of Jesus Christ it is not by our ability it's not by our power but it's by authority of the word of God that is in us that we speak Satan depart this morning in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we'd ask that your holy spirit will just move right down touch our sister Lily father just touch it father right down into her physical body Lord whatever it might be that's there in the brain that short circuits to cause these seizures we bind that in the name of Jesus Christ and we're asking for your Holy Spirit to come put these things back to their Norm noral rightful and god-given position that she can come forth and live life as you called for her to live Lord we ask you in the name of Jesus Christ now may the word the presence of your Holy Spirit Come and change this situation even as we pray in your precious name amen hallelujah amen the prophet told us Satan has his punch that he G gets but my brother and sister we do not have to sit here and accept his verdict it is the word of God it is Christ in you and I it is the word that is standing here this morning can we say Amen to that we are the word standing here this morning and Satan will attack the word every opportunity he gets but he will not defeat the word amen I say thank you Lord and we're just sending the Holy Spirit right there to the forier that God would touch her amen Romans the 3rd chapter: 1-4 what advantage then hath the Jew or what profit is there in of circumcision much every way chiefly because that unto them that were committed the Oracles of God for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect under the circumstances we have right here this morning my brother and sister unbelief will not make the word of God without effect God forbid yay let God be true but every man a liar but is as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged amen Lord just bless this time we ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated we look in the world we live in today Saints unbelief is all around us just to those of you might not have seen it but those that did maybe to bring but you know isn't it interesting that our own government and all the inaugural and all of these days of prayer and all this stuff actually chooses someone a woman Minister that gets up and everything that she portrays everything that she believes everything that she speaks out is contrary to the word of God and yet they would say we have chosen a minister of God to speak and to bring forth and I think it is very very evident as it is in this day that we live in that the very fabric of our nation is unbelief there is nothing there now you'd say well they believe in God brother Paul but my brother and sister the devil believes in God it's something more than just believing God exist amen and this might be a little blunt a little direct it's more than just believing God sent a prophet amen you have to have the evidence of the message of the hour in your life or we're missing it amen and so as you look at this we see this unbelief and in the world we live in today I'm going to just be blunt today hope you don't mind so many people have stepped away from the message because someone they respect said nope this isn't so but it tells you this is what it tells you my brother and sister they never had a personal experience their self because if you have a personal experience now this sound a little rude forgive me but if I have a personal experience let me turn it around I'm going to give you the positive side if you have a personal experience there's nothing negative I can say that will turn you around but with without that personal experience then we look to people and become respector of persons and we say well they say it's not true so I guess it's not true my brother and sister we're supposed to have enough of the word of God in us to rightly divide and discern the word of God and so as you look at this when we get this relationship with the lord the devil can come he can whisper in your ear just as much as he wants to whisper in your ear because if you are sealed then my brother and sister his words are not coming or penetrating into your life his unbelief will not affect you in fact it shouldn't make us arrogant but we should be in a place in our life we could remind the devil I have words that declare where you are going and I have words that declare where I am going amen so your words don't apply to me and obviously the word to me does not apply to you and the prophet of God you know the quote said you know if you're under the blood if Satan could come in there I'm paraphrasing could come in there to you when you're under the blood he would be your brother that's how powerful this Blood this message this word is in this hour if Satan penetrates into your world and you were under the the Covenant under the word under that my brother and sister it'll have the same impact on him that's right oh my brother and sister let us be hid in Christ amen not just close not to say we are friends but to be hid in him amen people can say what they want but it's always the action that tells the story is that not true amen it's the action that tells the truth amen and their unbelief will only affect you if you open the door that's right amen if you do not accept it if you do not open the door then that unbelief cannot even affect you we have been sealed my brother and sister and when you think about it the blood over the mantle what did it do you a lot of ways you can look at this but please catch this when the blood was over the mantle of the door my brother and sister it sealed what was on the inside it wasn't sealing what was on the outside amen so they had to be in the house with the blood over the the mantle the lentil H it was there that's the position not outside not outside the blood had to be in the blood under the blood and so there it was God sealed them and here we are today living here in this age a time that we need God more than ever before my brother and sister don't be looking back and saying I wish I had been with the prophet there in meetings in 1965 what we need to be is with the great prophet in meetings here in 2025 amen cuz when we're here with the great prophet our Lord Jesus Christ the same power that was seen and witnessed is there is right here in this building this morning ready to do what you would ask what do you need this morning it's about time maybe we acknowledge we are needy people amen unbelief can it do away with with belief no sir in fact unbelief doesn't even contain the same ingredient it can't water down real belief because unbelief is a lack of faith a lack of word lack of the presence my brother and sister belief contains all of that amen so you can't just say I'll add a little belief or faith to unbelief and turn it into belief it doesn't work that way and we look at this I love this shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect I say my brother and sister it's time for us to just make sure I'm not preaching like your Sinners I'm not preaching like your unbelievers but I'm just saying this is a time we should make sure that we're in a position that the faith of God the word of God has the correct effect on us that's right we don't want the word to run off of us like water on a duck's back we want to absorb the word we want to be as it were a sponge instead of a brick amen amen you know we look at this often times have have any of you been influenced by talking in a positive sense believer Christian been been influenced by another believer I I think every one of us that's that's really the pattern that God chose that he would put those that would be amples to us and we could look to them but you see a true uh example or ample that God would give will never allow the credit to be pointed to themselves that's right it they're always pointing you on to Jesus Christ on higher higher higher so we look at this and realize that that our relationship with the Lord needs to be based on our relation ship alone in other words if I was to say you know I serve God today brother Lonnie Jenkins was quite quite a mentor to me I cannot live on brother Lonnie's Revelation today in fact even many things that I have tried to pass on to others around me I share them but you see my brother and sister what brother Lonnie spoke to me in those days would be empty if I never the revelation of what he was saying right so if I just tried to live off of the words alone the time would run out memory causes us to not be able to remember exactly how it was but you see when that relationship that one would Mentor you into one would encourage you into when that relationship becomes your relationship as a child I lied to my dad and it's not acceptable in this day but it was I think in the 70s I lied to my dad and I thought he was beating me to death he whooped me so hard and when it was all done he looked me in the face and says if you'll tell the truth the first time you don't have to remember the story that's right I tell you it changed my life I didn't appreciate being whooped on what I did appreciate was a lesson behind it that if I'll just stand for truth I don't ever have have to remember what I said when I said it and my brother and sister if you will build your relationship on the Lord Jesus Christ going through life when you hit the hard times you don't have to stop and say what did I build this relationship on you'll be able to stand there and say I know who my relationship was it wasn't this pastor it wasn't this church it wasn't this great man it was Jesus Christ and cuz pastors and churches and great men can fall fail go away but that relationship that has been formed and and brought right in and become one with Christ it won't fail you it can't fail you and you will remember that in every situation in every day of your lives in the good times we praise His name just a principle right there in the good times we praise His name and when we have learned the real relationship in the bad times we still find oursel praising his his name it won't be about our condition my brother and sister but it will be about the relationship that's right amen you see when that is on him when our witness is Jesus Christ that's right I had a brother one time I thought it was interesting how he put it he wasn't trying to be contrarian but brothers were sharing well brothers so and so witnessed to me other brother's like well you all know brother so and so yes that's who witnessed to me this and they were sharing and and they weren't speaking out of line it was just a a little testimony of who and this one brother I don't know maybe was a little contrarian he said well it was Jesus Christ that W witnessed to me everybody else stopped H how do you respond to that but you see it might have well and it would have been Jesus Christ in brother brother sister sister brother amen there it is but we got to realize that no man ever come to God himself amen God come to man our Lord Jesus Christ found us we did not find him and so when we can find the true witness of who we are and how we fit in the plan if it was of man it would be man again and again and again now remember in the scripture you know that young Prophet goes to testify to the king and God tells him now when you leave you don't go back the same way so he had a word of the Lord right a thus saith the Lord and he goes and God accomplishes what God wanted to do and the young man is leaving now another Prophet man this will throw us this will throw us cuz man this is a Prophet this is not you know the janitor at the church this is a prophet comes and says hey you need to come to my house you need to do this and you know it's in that case here's a young Prophet what was it inexperience and lack of discipline you say lack of discipline that's right some people just have a hard time following God's leadership that's right and he says look after God spoke to you he spoke to me you know why we have a Thunders Doctrine that's it because someone stood up and said after the prophet was finished speaking God anointed me to finish it come back to my house rest eat imagine how he felt when he was there on the road and he meets the lion face to face there would have been a time of recognition I did not obey the Lord I'm sure glad God didn't use a lion in my life yeah hey I'd be a pitcher on wall as a memorial somewhere come on you know you would too amen but we got to learn that When God says this is how I want it done God speaking not man speaking this is how I want it done I don't care what anyone else says I don't care how they want to rearrange the message of the hour I put the word out there I gave it to you from the voice of a prophet direct to you just obey it just stay with it don't turn the right or left don't come with well God called me told me to say and oh no my brother and sister that's called confusion that is chaos but the word is always clear amen so our witness of Jesus Christ what is the This Man Called Jesus what is his track record could we just for a moment kind of taking a little bit from what brother brand taught in the sermon the trial can we just a moment stop can we put this man Christ Jesus what's his track record do we have anyone that says can stand today and testify he failed anyone testify that he was insufficient you see there has to be a witness right a true witness one that experienced amen that's right now there'd be people that say I prayed and God never answered my prayer yes he did you were just listening for your answer you were listening for what you wanted it to be and God did answer your prayer amen just not the way you wanted him to that's right just not in the time and the fashion but this man now will go over here and witness that God did not answer his prayer what kind of witness is he F false witness that's right by the same token men will stand today and say the Lord told me and if it doesn't bear witness in the word that's it what kind of witness that's right is that right the word will always take us to the word the prophet of God puts it this way and says the word of God will never take you away that's right from the word amen the spirit will never take you away from the word so as we look at this my brother and sister we just see that the track record of our Lord Jesus Christ should be here this morning if you are discouraged if you're sitting here and you feel like you do not have aners you feel like there's things that are out of kelter my brother and sister just the testimony of Jesus Christ should increase your faith to be able to stand because here's one who has testified he says this is what I'll do and I will do it according to my word but he didn't give us a timeline so perfect now actually we do have revelation of of a timeline we really honestly do have a a witness of the timeline he said before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord gives you a timeline amen that when these things shall take place when you see these signs we have timeline my brother and sister what should we worry about when the Lord is going to call us home when should we worry about when is the rapture taking place why should we be worrying about whether our children are going to be saved or not if we have placed them under the blood and committed fully gave them take your hands off and give them to the Lord you might not like what you see happening in their life because my god oh oh my God does not play games when he wants to change your mind amen we know I know personally brothers that will tell you don't play games with God cuz I put a challenge to God and I regretted what happened in my life because of the challenge but I serve God today because I realized God was listening when I challenged him amen right don't say that to God cuz God will do the work and if he can't lose a one how are you going to change it that's right but that doesn't take away the fact that we as parents as pastors Ministry Etc don't commit our time and pray for you and pray for the outcome of your children pray for the outcome of this church we must do that that is our part and don't worry about it God will do his part but we've got to let go amen and let God Amen do his work that's it that's it I'm going to hold my children a little cocoon I don't want anybody to look at my children and and and criticize them and and I'm going to protect my children cuz I'm a good father you just took it out of God's hand that's right and put it into your hand and then later you'll wonder how did we end up I I I I took this position and how did it end up like this because that's God's business amen your job is get down and pray amen your job is to get in the word your job is to create the atmosphere in the house right absolutely right and God that's it is there to do his job but we've got to let go amen and let God do the work amen amen amen that's right right young man that I met one time his testimony was his mother a faithful mother a loving mother a caring mother and every time she saw him she just tore into to him in a motherly way uh you need to serve God you've got to serve God you know what's right you got to stop what you're doing you got to do this and finally one day in a fit he told him mom as long as you're nagging me I'll never come back to church sounds disrespectful but it shocked his mother and she thought is that how it comes across I thought I was encouraging my son to serve God and she got down in prayer and said Lord what what can I do to get my son how can I encourage my son and she's listening to a tape and the prophet of God says pray that's it Prayer Changes Things amen she got a revelation all of her nag time sorry to put it that way but all of her nag time converted into prayer time and it wasn't long before her son says you know I just can't stand it any longer I've got to serve God but imagine now I because we don't know what the other outcome but maybe she just decided that nagging was the best way her son had made a vow I'd have to say with the devil anointing him he would have kept that vow I'll never come back to church but when God got a hold of it amen God said you know what you just do what I ask you to do and we think it's such a minimal thing oh just praying for them what what are you doing for them I'm just praying for them seem so minimal does it till you have Revelation and when you have Revelation you realize you are shaking Heaven and Earth because now you have completely let go of it which took a supernatural event in our life and let go of that and said Lord here it is it's yours amen I can't change it anyhow that's right I can't fix it but you can and I'm trusting you to fix it because you said so that's it that's exactly you spoke it Lord I believe it and we'll see this come to pass Hallelujah but as long as we have our hand in there telling the Lord I need to help you I need to help you Lord You're not quite seeing it from my point of view and the Lord's over here pardon me this sounds maybe a little outlandish thank God I don't see it from your point of view cuz we get skewered come on let's be honest can we be honest with one another we get that thing they call a opinion and it's because it's our opinion it has to be correct nobody's going to come and say well my my opinion really isn't correct it's false but I'm going to give it to you anyhow know everybody who shares their opinion believes it's the right thing well let me share an opinion with you let go that's it and let God that's it just hand it over to the Lord that's right and he'll deal with it in time does that mean it's next week brother Paul no might not even be next year that's it we might see a world in chaos such that we never dreamed it was but I want you to really study the thought I many years ago preached to the church we were down by by the post office area down there uh across from where the police station is now you know and I remember preaching there saying look how Wicked this world is this is Sodom oh the coming of the Lord must be imminent and it's about 40 times worse first now you you couldn't trust Paul's opinion on what I thought was so horrible Sodom was a lot rougher city than we give it credit for the testimony of a true witness brother brandham says here now a testimony before a person has to have an experience before they can testify absolutely now look I don't want to discourage nobody here but we got people without the Holy Ghost testifying God's opinion that's it right scripture tells us that you can't even say that Jesus truly say you can say the words but you won't be saying it in spirit and in truth that Jesus is the Christ without the Holy Ghost that's right amen it it gives you a very clear picture of the line that God has cut through there saying just cuz these words come from your mouth doesn't mean you're a witness that's right without experience you're not that's right don't discourage it get the experience amen if you're called in court you have to have to as give a testimony you have to know something before you can testify right that's right any old man can stand and say God's a Creator exactly then then they'll go and support for evolution yeah still believing that God's a Creator Sorry God doesn't straddle fences God doesn't hang to the side he's clearcut God's very clearcut he's so clear-cut that basically he'll say if you'll just get out of my way that's right you're in desperation for this for that the other if you just get out of my way I'll take care of it you know that's nothing like I'll just take this back to experience you know um you you be a young man uh this was my life I'm a young man I want to be a carpenter I've got all the tools I got every tool I need and I'm there working and I'm working underneath this older gentleman finally one day in frustration he turns around and said are you my puppy or what no I'm not then why don't you sit back and learn but you see what I wanted to do I wanted to I wanted to prove that I really cared I wanted to be there every time he turned around here and he's like get away from me get away from me and observe get away and when I say this is how you do this pay attention but we think oh I'm following the Lord so closely out of ignorance yeah are you with me yeah you know it's good I like to see enthusiasm I want to see my grandkids learn the things that God's blessed me with but I don't want to you know step on their feet till they hurt and turn around elbow them in the head I don't want to do all of this stuff what God wants us to do is to look and live amen when when they were there with the Brazen serpent God didn't say you have to come up here and touch this thing what you had to do is look and live amen whether you on the near side or on the far side in the valley or On Top of the Rock you look you can live my brother and sister God doesn't want us to have to go become some preachers some pastors uh best man as it were to be there beck and call and to th just throw ourselves into the work what he wants us to do is sit back and say you know what there's a principle there's something and if I get the principles I will be as my pastor is I will be a faithful man of God I will be what it is that that God has called me to be my brother and sister but you won't do that by tagging along cuz tagging along you'll miss most of what is done and the reason it's done so you look at that see seeing something that knows the witness is a person who has seen something and knows that it is the truth yes y could we get a better understanding of Christ in you you amen I've shared it in the church here brother in Chile older brother used to be a pastor but but you know as time went on he he wasn't a pastor anymore but a faithful Minister kind of retired in a sense sitting in the coffee shop every morning newspaper a little bag old thing and some tea and there's another man about his same age sitting at another table finally it's like hey I see you here all the time who are you what are you what do you do the other gentleman says oh I pastor this church over here he says oh I I'm a minister of the Gospel also he didn't go and say your doctrine's wrong you guys are you know you guys are you know false seed no he asked him oh your church how big how this how that good people I assume yes yes yes they talk about the word one day this man this pastor says um come speak for me on Wednesday night at our church cuz I'm just so impressed by the things you share this started a plan of God that he didn't just immediately start going all the time there but they're there every morning morning you know I'll call it a bagel you know bagel and some tea look at the newspaper that's provided talk about the word would you preach a Sunday for me well if you want me to yes I've been praying about this would you preach a Wednesday would you preach a Sunday would you preach a Wednesday would you preach a Sunday and there were people who criticized him have you witnessed to him yet have you witnessed to him yet and he would say yes I've witnessed to him oh what where did you start what sermon yeah the Bible the greatest sermon ever preached amen two and a half years he's been invited to preach on a Sunday morning and he wakes up early that morning and the Lord says today Y is the day he's like Lord I don't think they're ready the Lord the brother puts it this way it wasn't an audible voice but it rung in my head today is the day do you know that church was roughly half of the church when he got up and says have you enjoyed what I preach to you and there yes but when he brings it when he Springs it to them half of the church says you're an ult and you were deceiving us the other half of the church including the pastor and in the ministry says that's what we've been looking for when we let go and let God that's it right that's it oh in the wrong season my brother and sister no wonder the way it's approached I I believe this this personal opinion okay can can I have permission to express I think half the time that people re back up or kind of reject the message is not the message itself it's how we present it that's right yeah yeah like a brother told me once he Saidi love scrambled eggs but I don't like scrambled eggs that look like they've come off the floor you see we can scramble it all up and we present it in the wrong fashion no wonder they don't want to eat it but when we step back and let God do his work am when the season was right and it was the Holy Spirit that discerned the season that told this brother today is the day not next week not next month not next year today is the day amen and it works perfectly amen absolutely amen witness a person seen something that knows it is the truth they are called to give witness amen did he say speak witness and then a witness must know what he's talking about oh now he's starting to talk yeah so so there's a time that you can be a witness without talking but then when you come to the time that he knows what he's talking about he must not be somebody told me a certain certain thing he must be the witness himself if not he is speaking of someone else that could be a witness at the scene right exactly let's go to that did that have another part to that I don't remember if I posted it in there or not maybe not okay I was trying to keep it a little shorter but you see my brother and sister God's always always got a witness Amen on the scene amen amen now I'm not speaking harshly don't un misunderstand me but this morning somebody will walk out of here and say I didn't really understand what brother Paul was saying somebody will walk out of here and say God spoke to me this morning and one will be a witness because they know exactly the other ones say I went to church but you see God knows exactly what he's doing in the time and the place and the condition that he wants everything to be in right going to pray for the baby but the Hat has to be in the right place and brother brandham says I couldn't move the Hat that's right amen it wouldn't be the preacher moving the hat or the preacher trying to move the spirit in the church it is God that must put the hat and God might use a man or a woman to move the hat but it's got to be God that's moving the Hat that's right amen we can't come and say we're going to have a Revival get everybody in this building saved we might have a Revival and turn way more than we bring to Christ because we didn't do it God's way but when we let go and say Lord here it is I commit this to you this is your word if they are your seed Lord they can't walk away from this word oh my I believe this morning in spite of the unbelief around us that the faith of God is still in full effect amen I'm not worried about the message puttering out burning out being blowed out my brother and sister there'll be a lot of men there'll be a lot of men that will come and say nope the message is not I I I say this because I've heard them say it and the message just doesn't have the same effect it used to says who yeah says who the seed can't grow without light is a sun any less the light today than it was when God spoke it my brother and sister it's just as powerful and it will bring forth we need to do our part but you see this is what happened right Leo deia right if I had my little grandson up here I'd use him for an example all the rest of you are a little bit big Le deia sleep my baby sleep everything is just fine sleep my baby sleep the Lord told me everything's just fine I'm sorry the Lord's not here to lull you to sleep he's here to wake us up amen he's here to bring it that we would recognize what the message really is we have got a misconstrued idea of what the message is we believe God sent a prophet we see it in the scripture see all this but we don't see the personal conviction amen that the message was sent to bring that's right you say brother Paul isn't that a little straight it might be but I tell you what if you standing there with the Apostle Paul he'd have let you know directly you don't got it yeah he comes back my brother and sister after his journey he gets back to Jerusalem he doesn't run in there in high five and hug all of the disciples he goes back there and says what are you guys you guys are lukewarm you're like the phical you're you're you're not sincere you're not committed they didn't like Paul some said Paul come to stir us up yes he did praise God anybody want to be stirred up by the word amen let's not be laxidasical let's not just sit here and say hey God sent a prophet everything's fine my brother and sister why don't we let God go and let him do what he really wants to do oh let's have a Revival why don't you start the Revival amen it doesn't need to be a guest preacher it doesn't need to be anything but you and God and then you can start a Revival amen are we brave enough to commit ourselves and say Lord start with me amen amen or we would rather that after it's kind of proven to half of the church then then we'll jump on board my brother and sister sorry this will be blunt what if the other half of the church never has a Revival that's it and you're waiting for them uh is this too blunt no individual time to let go and let God do his work time for us to get rid of all the little petties and the little these things that come and and oh we're shook up about this and we're shook up about that well what if you're the only one the prophet preaches this I feel confident to to paraphrase this quote what if you're the only one in this church that's it that's going to go in the Rapture and you're waiting for someone else amen my why don't you let go and let God that's it amen that's it right have we seen enough to say we're Witnesses amen amen any hands raised here to say we've seen enough to say we Are Witnesses my brother and sister we've seen the supernatural amen when you let the witness Testify the false witness is judged of his testimony and the true witness is judged of his testimony what sentence do we want to receive because we will be judged amen of what we testify what we witness we will be judged I'm going to lift my hand today I'm no better than any one of you so don't misunderstand but I lift my hand today and say Lord I Want My Testimony to be a true witness of Jesus Christ I want my testimony to ring true if somebody says I'm going to take you and I'm going to run you through the word of God and see if you go through the word of God you say but I know my life is not worthy it wouldn't go yes it will I'm telling you cuz you see God will not judge you by the flesh God will judge you in the spirit and if you have the Holy Ghost and in the right spirit in the right approach God will take your flesh yes yes brother Donnie calls it that old rotten filthy flesh he'll take that flesh anointed by the spirit right through the filter amen cuz God said I'm not looking at your flesh that's right I'm looking at the word and if you don't believe this world out here can be anointed to let your flesh go through the filter and see the spirit that's in you then then you missed it God will anoint them to not see the little everyday failures some of them not religious at all and they have more Revelation on that than the religious people I love it let's take it back the woman caught in the very Act was God speaking to them in the flesh or in the spirit you could say both really but I believe amongst those there would have been some of those Sadducees Pharisees never had committed adultery never had done that would not be guilty but spiritually they were guilty amen God deals with some In the Flesh some in the spirit some in both if you're guilty in the flesh well that'd be horrible that they high priests and everything would be guilty of the very same things but my brother and sister sometimes God brings those things and manifests them in the spiritual realm the prophet of God now there's some crazy people out here have said you know that the pastor um is your spiritual husband I'll let you soap on that one for just a minute brother Paul is our spiritual husband you could find a minute context for that right but if you can take it in the flesh realm I just divorced you all because I couldn't handle it I couldn't deal with it trying to control your life I would put it blunt pardon the humor if I'm in control you all probably driving a white car yeah we won't even go any further than that cuz I know some of you don't like white cars so we're going to have a doctoral argument here see how silly that is but spiritual husband's side just to reinforce this the prophet of God said the wife will never answer for the husband but the husband will always answer that's right for the wife if a minister preaches false doctrine that spiritually impacts you God will have Grace but not for the preacher that's right the man will answer yes sir take this principle go study it go listen to brother Eugene he really drives at home Redemption always comes through the mail amen and it is there that when we deal that what is the husband doing for his wife binding her in legalism binding her in false control no a real husband gives his wife Liberty amen amen amen now Sister Jerry that doesn't talk about the wallet we just we've been discussing this let me put it that way it's good don't don't worry about it it was a small bus I threw under let the witness Witnesses testify false will testify false true will testify truth see we go back my brother and sister that uh God forbid this is verse four out of our original scripture God forbid yay let God be true let every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings what you're testifying of and mightest overcome when thou art judged God putting us in a position that what is testified we will find deliverance and what is Justified we will find Deliverance you see this what the word's doing my brother and sister it's not a click now let me hurry hurry hurry along here uh in expectations what if someone come up in the morning to your door Express agent and throw it a whole basket full of rattlesnakes and had your name on them here they are they're yours you know they're there just like you know your symptoms is there if you receive them they're yours but you don't have to take them you can say I don't want them say your name's on them say I don't want them I won't have them he can stand there and argue as much as he wants to but until you take them and sign for them they belong to the express company which is Satan transfer and storage he amen and sign they belong to express company until you sign for them don't sign for nothing the devil brings you say there it is though I refuse to have it amen and that's what God wants you and I evil spirits contrary Spirits critical Spirits amen whatever it would be it doesn't have to be just entirely with healing but anything that the devil would deliver we don't have to accept it amen and it's time for us to be bold to stand up and say you know Satan I took this delivery last week but I'm not taking it this week I have in the past lived under this influence but no longer I'm not going to accept that have you seen the little video that was made by a a brother and sister down I believe that was Tucson wasn't it Jerry about the the snakes Jerry says she doesn't know okay she's the one that showed it to me um but a a sister down there Mesa okay doctor says you have cancer and at first she accepted that but then God spoke to her and they have this little video where they depict this all out and finally in the end they grab that and it's throwed out the door and when Satan comes back they rough him up and throw him out the door and what this little video was depicting was the fact that this sister at first accepted I have cancer but God spoke to her and said you know what you don't have to claim this and became Revelation to this sister and she started thanking God every single day for her healing and she goes back to the doctor and the doctor says we don't understand why it's not there we know it was there but you don't have cancer any longer and my brother and sister in their little video they depict that as grabbing that uh Delivery Man and throwing him out of the house Hallelujah open the door throw the devil out we don't have to have depression we don't have to have anxiety we don't have to have fear we don't have to have symptoms of disease we don't have to have that God is our healer how about today Saints we would actually say Lord I let go of this and I give it entirely to you let you fulfill it that you would take care of it I can't do it myself right righten hallelu but I prayed the prayer of faith for healing then let God settle it deliver it amen bring it that's right cuz remember he's never failed that's right yet oh that's right and he's not going to I don't care what our need is this morning Saints that's it I don't care what it is that's right amen we got to let go and let God that's exactly and when he comes on this scene it will change things you say but I've been praying for the Lord to come on the scene maybe you're the one that's hindering it that's right amen that's it maybe our prayer shouldn't be Lord I need you to do this I need you to do this maybe it should be something on the order of Lord thy will amen be done that's it that's it true right that's it amen I don't have that much faith brother Paul well let me tell you you personally never did faith is of God Amen strange how The More We Trust him the more faith we have amen wait it's not our understanding of the scripture how we can explain the seals and the vials and the Thunders no my brother and sister the more you trust God the greater your faith will be who wants more faith amen amen let's trust him amen okay that's right take it back have nothing to do with it if you won't testify you've got it when you test you still have test when you testify you still have your sickness the devil keeps it with you but refuse to testify it I won't have it no sir oh my that's when you're getting Faith give your faith a chance right turn it loose unbridle it let it work you've got it all bound down with tradition turn it loose cut it Loose let God have his way with you amen somebody's words right either what you're looking at or what God says there you are amen that's true God's word is true believe it all right amen amen I don't know about you but that's inspiring to me amen amen see it's not just a physical healing it's spiritual healing also healing of marriages healing of everything that we have amen you see young or old Saints we were designed by God to have a God in control am and I say a God you know what I'm talking about you've got a choice amen and amazing everything that's been done you know we see the cycle Through the Ages it backfires on companies but you know Campbell Soup the new tomato soup flop so bad they had to just cancel that they literally hold millions of cans of tomato soup to to the landfill because people didn't want their new tomato soup and we have a new age do you know I believe a new age you guys look nervous I'm a new aged person that's right H amen come on y I'm a new age amen I stepped out of Leo deia and I stepped into the bride age and I'm living under a whole different anointing a whole different calling and expecting a whole different result amen it's not their little woo woo music it's not their little behaviors my brother and sister that was Satan's imitation when God had the bride step out of leoa into the bride age Satan says I've got to have a new age also but my brother and sister a prophet very quietly spoke this out I say very quietly it never hit the New York Times it never hit the post or anything like that and he said this is a new age we're no longer living in leoda well well we're under this Spirit brother Paul the influence of leoda so hard my brother and sister don't let that become a crutch God called you out of there that's right he called you into another position in Christ Jesus amen we've come into the bride age amen hallelujah but look at this young or old were designed to have a God in control and Satan substitute Gods amen Baal for example you know in New York City if you guys any of you listen or read anything Jonathan KH put you know we don't hear about it we live in Idaho but they've now got a a a deal an arch and a statue and all this to bail in a park in New York city in America a nation that's supposed to believe in one God and Bale has come in and they set up a camera and they've recorded people come as they pass by quietly and they pause for a moment and do their little and walk on I'd like to go visit this Arch and statue of Baal in a bulldozzer that's what God did right he sent God Faithful Men out into the Groves and they tore them things down amen you know but poor O Gideon man I'm telling you poor O Gideon he got it from every angle God calls him to do something it makes his dad his neighbor his cousin his mother and everybody else mad he says I can't do that Lord and the Lord says nothing about can't you will that's right and I'm going to tell you this morning not arrogantly don't sit here and tell me you can't serve God today you will amen because you are his chosen amen amen all through scripture chosen chosen look now my brother and sister see look through the scripture also I'm I'm way slow as I should be just another couple minutes here look what God did God so anointed his ark they took the ark stole it tucked it away in their temple in front of their gods and every one of them bowed down that's right amen now imagine how shocked they were cuz see this is not just like oh Mighty Wind or earthquake or something the ones that were behind the ark fell towards it ones to the right fell towards it the ones to the left fell towards it the ones Beyond it fell towards it that's right and I don't care what leod deia all the spirits of this age what anyone says every one of these spirits will fall subject to the word of God they will bow down now my brother and sister I I want to put this to you a little strongly if in the end they'll bow down God has given you and I Authority today to make them bow down right here today to you to Bow subject to you as Sons and Daughters of God it's time for us to look at the word and say that's not history and that's not something over here I am the word and I am here I'm living in this today and the spirits of this age are going to bow down in this day to the bride of Christ which is the word amen is that too strong too far out there it's about time my brother and sister we get that kind of confidence in God that the Satan the spirits of the age are going to bow down to the word of God and the word is in you amen hallelujah oh and we have a real God the same yesterday he's the same today and he'll be the same tomorrow that's right he'll he'll do the same things well brother Paul if we were in a lion's den would the Lions leave us alone it all depends if God chose a lion to be what took you home exactly right see you can't say well praise God if we are in the Dark Ages and we were in the Coliseum those Lions wouldn't have touched us no if God ordained you to give your life you would give your life amen and if he ordained you to live you would be anointed to declare the life in you and Satan like a roaring lion is roaming to and fro in this day and I just this is just personal opinion okay is that all right to express this I believe if I'd have been in the Lion's Den or in the Coliseum I believe I would have lived and the reason I believe that is because Satan today is going as a roaring lion and God has anointed you and I not to death but to life amen we're standing here serving the same God under the same principles of the same word and God says you know what I'm not calling you to death in this day I'm calling you to life in this day and I believe whatever age we would have been we were called to life now that's just an opinion take it how you want here amen but I'll tell you what my brother and sister we got to start standing up and giving God the opportunity to fulfill his word now in Witnesses did I not finish that quote that's all right we move on in witnesses there as God spoke from Heaven he saw the spirit of God coming like a dove falling upon man who had been born born in a manger see what the world call great God calls foolish and what the world called foolish God calls great that's right so don't mind to be called foolish that goes against this old flesh every one of us just want to be accepted of our pows we want to we want to be you know cuz remember you can't have the mind of Christ and the mind of the world at the same time you can't be in your way and God's way at the same time that's right I want to learn to be a carpenter and I'm going to do it by being in your way no that's what that Old Gentleman you move over there about 8 feet and stay out of my way and just learn we can't be in God's way no that's right we've got to let God have his way amen you have to get out of your own way to let God have his way that's the only way you're ever going to do anything you got to get away from your own thoughts your own reasons don't try to reason amen just believe amen I'm going to close here we have a lot of needs in this assembly don't we I think that we could just go there wouldn't be a Pew that didn't have a need represented on that pew how are we going to deal with that will it help if the pastor preaches harder will it help if I tell you you're Sinners will it help if if if if no it won't no it won't the difference my brother and sister is we have to let God have his way and I tell you God is God right amen can you tell God what to do no sir can you move God depends on I know how brother David's looking at it but you can move God by the feeling of our infirmity we can move God by our fervent righteous prayer we can move God not in man's way of thinking I'm going to make God do no you're not going to do that but we're Sons and Daughters of God we can get God to move now it's not take away my Affliction change me you know there's a brother in Cloverdale can't remember his name brother uh ball RP any of you know brother ball R brother ball R Indian brother if that matters walks with arm braces I would do a poor imitation but he kind of throws his one leg and your heart goes out and says oh man our brother ball R you know what brother ball RS told me he said brother Paul there's one thing the Lord equipped me to do really really well I'm thinking oh he can do computers he can do this he said I can pray amen amen I can pray amen right maybe we don't need so many natural talents that's right if God would Grant to us a spiritual Talent like that amen maybe we wouldn't be so so dependent upon our self if our self had been born Afflicted that's it maybe we at an early age getting saved come and say you know what brother borup spoken these words in
