[30:31] now because we surrender ourselves to
[30:34] you and for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[30:38] name
[30:39] amen amen amen if you'd turn with me in
[30:43] your Bibles to First John
[30:45] 10 we'll get right into the word I want
[30:48] to um well I'll give you that title in
[30:52] just a
[30:53] moment 1 John
[30:55] 10:27 starting with verse
[31:00] 27 I'm sorry St John I'm
[31:03] sorry yeah I wrote that down wrong
[31:07] sorry it's not first
[31:11] John I knew that don't know why I wrote
[31:13] it that way okay St John
[31:17] 1027 my
[31:19] sheep let's just start with verse
[31:23] 26 now this is to unbelievers said but
[31:26] but you believe not because you are not
[31:29] of my sheep as I said unto
[31:34] you let me just back up to verse 25 so
[31:37] we're not just left hanging there Jesus
[31:39] answered them said I told you and you
[31:42] believe not the works that I do in my
[31:45] father's name they bear witness of me
[31:48] but you believe not because you are not
[31:50] of my sheep as I said unto you my
[31:56] sheep hear my voice
[32:00] now that word hear is to
[32:03] receive my sheep hear my voice and I
[32:07] know
[32:09] them and they follow
[32:12] me now in the in a verse in that same
[32:16] chapter he said in verse five and a
[32:19] stranger will they not follow but
[32:21] they'll flee from him for they know not
[32:23] the voice of
[32:26] strangers there's nothing there's only
[32:30] something in you that will receive the
[32:32] voice of God and will not receive the
[32:35] voice of a stranger no matter how close
[32:38] it is to the voice of
[32:41] God Amen isn't that wonderful see you
[32:44] never put that there God did and so but
[32:48] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[32:50] me and I give a watch I give unto them
[32:54] eternal life who is he giving that to is
[32:58] sheep so he did nothing to earn this you
[33:01] did nothing to Merit it he said I give
[33:04] it to them that have that ear to hear
[33:08] the Bible said he that hath an ear to
[33:11] hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith
[33:13] to the churches that right after every
[33:16] Church age he that hath an ear he that
[33:19] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[33:22] saith so my sheep hear my voice and he
[33:26] said I know them
[33:29] when did he know us the Bible said he
[33:31] knew us before the world
[33:33] began so I know
[33:36] them and the only way we could know him
[33:40] was that he knew us if he didn't know us
[33:44] and he didn't plant that seed of himself
[33:47] in us we couldn't know
[33:52] him no matter how good we would be no
[33:55] matter how good works we would have how
[33:57] emotional we would have how much we'd
[33:59] shout or dance or even cast out Devils
[34:02] you can do that by the spirit of God and
[34:03] still not know him right
[34:09] amen because many of them will come and
[34:12] say to have not I cast out devils in
[34:14] your name and preached in your name and
[34:16] but he said I Know Thee not depart from
[34:19] me you worker of
[34:21] iniquity all right so verse 28 and I
[34:25] give unto them eternal life them my
[34:28] sheep and they shall never watch this
[34:31] they shall they shall never
[34:35] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[34:40] out of my
[34:42] hand what a
[34:45] consolation amen all right then I'd like
[34:49] you to go with me to St John
[34:52] 157 or excuse me 1527
[34:58] use this scripture a little bit here in
[35:01] last few times but we'll use scriptures
[35:05] a
[35:09] lot it it's not so much how much we read
[35:11] the
[35:12] scriptures it just keeps unveiling
[35:17] itself these things excuse me verse 26
[35:21] starting but when the comforter is come
[35:23] whom I will send unto you from the
[35:25] father even the spirit of Truth
[35:28] which proceedeth from the father he
[35:31] shall testify of me and you also shall
[35:35] bear witness because you have been with
[35:39] me from the
[35:43] beginning amen and Luke
[35:47] 12 Luke 1232
[36:01] fear not little flock for it is your
[36:04] father's good pleasure to give you the
[36:10] Kingdom so fear not little flock it's
[36:13] your father's good pleasure to give
[36:16] you the kingdom all right you may be
[36:21] seated I want to title this and it's a
[36:24] bit of a strange title but my actually
[36:26] my subtitle tonight would would actually
[36:29] be the subject for tonight more but I
[36:31] want to title this because I want to
[36:32] continue if the Lord is willing with
[36:35] that title on
[36:36] Sunday and let me read the quote that I
[36:39] brought this from this
[36:42] this is found in in
[36:45] uh Christ is the mystery of God
[36:49] revealed and the prophet says and his
[36:51] church stands
[36:53] alone she is not hooked with nothing
[36:59] but he was identified by God being the
[37:03] body that God dwelt in and the church is
[37:07] identified by his body doing the same
[37:11] thing so if he was identified how he was
[37:14] identified by God being the body and we
[37:17] are the body and then we're
[37:20] identified as his body we must have the
[37:22] same
[37:25] Spirit doing the same same thing she is
[37:30] his
[37:32] body the manifested truth what is his
[37:35] body she is his body the manifested
[37:38] truth of his promised word for the last
[37:44] days and she and she alone stands by
[37:49] it she and she alone stands by
[37:54] it what makes what would make her so
[37:58] different there's all kinds of good
[38:00] people but we're not talking about good
[38:02] people or bad people
[38:04] tonight because you can you can be good
[38:07] and then you can turn around and not be
[38:08] so good right but none of us I think in
[38:12] here want to do wrong or or do anything
[38:14] to grieve the holy spirit so that's not
[38:18] our desire but whether we make mistakes
[38:21] or
[38:22] fail in these things do things that are
[38:25] not good how many's done things is not
[38:27] good certainly all of us
[38:30] have even as Believers filled with the
[38:32] Holy Ghost we do things not good
[38:36] amen but see none of that
[38:39] counts what counts is that you could
[38:42] hear his voice calling
[38:44] you to the Rapture calling you to the
[38:48] feast calling you to the word for the
[38:52] season and you're able to receive it
[38:55] that's the difference that's a life
[38:58] and and I just I picked something up on
[39:00] this morning this evening but get
[39:03] Quicken to me but that's the life that's
[39:04] worthy of the
[39:07] Gospel amen there's only one life and
[39:09] that's
[39:11] him amen so it's him you revealed in you
[39:14] it's no more you
[39:15] living it's
[39:18] him amen and so fear not little
[39:22] flock it's your father's good pleasure
[39:25] to give you the Kingdom so back to this
[39:26] quote here he says and she and she alone
[39:29] stands by
[39:32] it that's why the devil's howling see
[39:36] see backing up here she is his body the
[39:38] manifested truth so see he's come down
[39:41] manifesting himself he himself it's not
[39:44] another he himself manifesting himself
[39:47] in the formation of his
[39:49] bride
[39:51] amen and because she is his
[39:54] body she has his spirit that's why the
[39:58] devil's
[40:00] howling these great organizations and if
[40:03] I have time and we if we can if I don't
[40:05] know if I have time but some things I'd
[40:07] like to take out of the church age book
[40:09] here tonight but you know good and well
[40:11] that those great organizations are
[40:13] setting up something to close her up and
[40:16] it's happening brother sister we may not
[40:19] think it but look at since this
[40:21] presidents come
[40:23] in look at look at the look at the
[40:25] Spirit he's anointed under to move
[40:28] things I'll take this and do this and
[40:31] move this around and change this
[40:34] and it's all it's motivation bringing
[40:38] that church that you know why because
[40:41] it's the it's the it's the church it's
[40:43] the carnal Church the the the conf the
[40:47] in the the Council of churches the the
[40:51] church the
[40:53] denominations that are behind him
[40:55] becoming politically strong
[40:58] that's exactly what's
[41:00] happening and we're living in a
[41:02] tremendous time because I'll tell you
[41:03] right now we could go any
[41:05] moment it's just that close and the
[41:08] bride's coming to a full maturity even
[41:10] Friday there's seven stars lining up and
[41:12] I'm not prophesying what that means but
[41:14] seven is
[41:15] completion and if we had five stars
[41:17] lined up in 1962 at the end of 62 and
[41:20] the prophet said the astronomic of
[41:22] Heaven is announcing her approach as the
[41:24] infant bride coming forth
[41:27] what will it be when she
[41:30] matures now manifest here on the earth
[41:33] who is she she's
[41:35] him just in another form so see he's
[41:39] here and I pray that all of us could
[41:41] become that God conscious in everything
[41:44] we do to know that he's here he's with
[41:47] us he never leaves us he said I'll never
[41:48] leave you nor forsake you but be with
[41:51] you to the
[41:52] End
[41:54] Amen oh there was some people switched
[41:56] over
[41:58] here so I'm sorry I I thought they were
[42:01] on this
[42:02] side well you all hear me anyway all
[42:06] right so thank the Lord for
[42:09] that so we going on with this he said
[42:14] now that's why the devil's howling these
[42:15] great organizations to set up something
[42:18] to close her up now watch what he says
[42:20] they'll never do
[42:23] it they'll never do it she'll be taken
[42:26] up
[42:27] not closed up I want to take my title
[42:30] this morning this evening taken up not
[42:34] closed
[42:35] up taken up not closed
[42:39] up now we're at the end we know we're at
[42:42] the end we're at the end the prophet
[42:44] said we've arrived we're at the end how
[42:46] long he says I don't know but we've
[42:48] arrived at the
[42:50] end there going be no more Church ages
[42:53] we've come to that place where the bride
[42:55] maturing under this opened word because
[42:59] that's who she is She lays in that
[43:01] presence of that risen
[43:04] son that's why I said when I walked in
[43:07] some of them were sitting there and I
[43:08] said well good morning well good morning
[43:11] yeah I said the Sun's
[43:13] Up the sun's up it is the prophet said
[43:17] it is the rising of the sun good morning
[43:19] bride I'm not trying to be funny but
[43:21] it's just when we realize that that it
[43:24] is good morning to the bride it's a new
[43:27] day it's the bride time it's seed time
[43:31] it's Rapture time so we're going to
[43:34] progress with this but tonight I want to
[43:36] take a subtitle free
[43:39] indeed free
[43:41] indeed so these organizations are trying
[43:44] they'll never do it she'll not be she'll
[43:46] be taken up not closed up she is now
[43:49] risen Hallelujah are you with me she is
[43:52] now
[43:53] risen you said well Brother David I
[43:55] haven't changed it all but that would
[43:57] brother Bram not talking about
[43:59] physically we will physically R
[44:02] rise but what's he saying spiritually
[44:05] we've risen we rose with him when he
[44:08] rose see and how could we then rise with
[44:12] him and die spiritual we can't die when
[44:16] you raised with him you've passed from
[44:19] Death to
[44:20] life amen the body will pass away but
[44:23] this will rise again see
[44:27] what a what a what a freedom indeed what
[44:31] a free Freedom
[44:34] indeed so she's risen and by the power
[44:37] of the Vindicated word how do many know
[44:39] this message is
[44:40] Vindicated not to be William bram's
[44:44] message but yet it is William bram's
[44:46] message but it's the message of the
[44:49] seventh angel It's
[44:51] Christ it's his message amen and power
[44:56] of that's why that's why he Vindicated
[44:58] the word we're not just taking a word of
[45:00] a man we have a Vindicated word promised
[45:03] to us promised to her amen how a bride
[45:06] holds that promise he told me he would
[45:10] return after me you believe that he told
[45:14] me he would he said I'll come again and
[45:16] receive you to myself now that's already
[45:19] begun did you know that that's already
[45:22] begun but it's got to
[45:23] end with him also receiving and meeting
[45:26] us in the air
[45:27] but what's he doing he said he told me
[45:30] he we'd return after me I believe it
[45:32] uh-huh see yes sir to meet her headship
[45:35] so what's he come for to make her ready
[45:38] for her to be ready to meet him in the
[45:41] air that's what we got to do there's a
[45:44] meeting he's provided the ring the token
[45:47] he's provided the clothing she wears and
[45:50] the provided meeting place so he's come
[45:54] for us to be ready to get ready because
[45:56] how can we lay in the presence of the
[45:58] sun and the Sun not be
[46:00] present is that right so we're laying
[46:03] here
[46:05] ripening so I believe it yes sir to
[46:08] what's it for what's he what's he come
[46:10] this way for to meet her headship her
[46:12] Redeemer her husband her King her Lord
[46:15] her lover her savior in the provided
[46:18] meeting
[46:19] place so free indeed where the spirit of
[46:22] the Lord is there is
[46:25] liberty so let's turn over to second or
[46:30] excuse me St John 8 just go right over
[46:32] here to John
[46:35] 8 and we'll begin reading here with
[46:38] verse
[46:51] 32 and you shall know the
[46:54] truth Jesus speaking you shall know the
[46:57] truth and the truth shall set you free
[47:00] on verse 25 they said unto him who art
[47:04] thou and Jesus said unto them even the
[47:07] same that I said unto you from the
[47:10] beginning who art thou even the same as
[47:12] I said unto you from the beginning what
[47:14] was in the beginning the original word
[47:18] God was in the
[47:19] beginning amen so I've told you in the
[47:23] beginning I'm I said unto you from the
[47:25] beginning
[47:28] I have many things to say and to judge
[47:30] of you but he that sent me is true and I
[47:33] speak to the world those things which I
[47:35] have heard of
[47:36] him and of course they understood not
[47:39] that he spake to them of the
[47:41] father then he and then he
[47:45] says over here in verse 32 again down
[47:50] here and he said and you shall know the
[47:53] truth and the truth shall shall make you
[47:59] free they answered him and said we be
[48:01] Abraham's seed we've never in bondage to
[48:04] any man how sayest thou you shall be
[48:06] made
[48:09] free Jesus said unto him verily I say
[48:12] unto you whosoever committes sin is the
[48:16] servant of sin now that's 1 John 3:8 if
[48:19] you just hold your spot there just a
[48:21] minute let me read this 1 John 3 and
[48:24] verse 8 and9 he he said he verse 8 of St
[48:29] John or 1 John 38 he said he that
[48:32] committes sin is of the devil for the
[48:34] devil sinth from the beginning for this
[48:37] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[48:39] that he might destroy the works of the
[48:42] devil I'll keep that in heart in your
[48:45] heart the Son of God was
[48:47] manifested that he might destroy the
[48:50] works of the devil whosoever is born of
[48:53] God doth not commit sin
[48:57] for the seed remaineth in him and he
[49:02] cannot amen that ought to make his so
[49:05] happy and he
[49:08] cannot what's it mean to be born
[49:11] again to have that seed quickened in
[49:15] you made life who is that that's the sun
[49:20] revealed in you and you shall know the
[49:23] truth and the truth shall make you free
[49:27] whosoever is born of God do not commit
[49:29] sin for his seed remaineth for whose
[49:31] seed his seed God's seed remaineth in
[49:34] him and he cannot sin because he is born
[49:38] of
[49:39] God
[49:41] Amen so what that son revealed in you
[49:44] for that he might destroy the works of
[49:47] the devil what destroys the works of the
[49:49] devil the light being manifest will
[49:52] destroy the works of the devil all right
[49:55] the word destroys him so we go on here
[49:57] in St John and he said whosoever
[50:00] committeth sin is a servant of sin and
[50:02] the in verse 35 the servant abideth not
[50:05] in the
[50:07] house forever but the son abideth ever
[50:12] now that house is a
[50:14] kingdom amen and and the servant won't
[50:17] abide in the house forever but the son
[50:20] abides in the house forever amen and
[50:23] verse 36 if the son therefore shall make
[50:28] you free you shall be free indeed amen
[50:33] if the son therefore makes you free you
[50:36] shall be free
[50:39] indeed amen turn with me to
[50:45] Galatians chapter
[50:50] 1 verse six six verse 15 and 16
[50:56] and when it
[50:58] pleased God who separated me from my
[51:01] mother's womb and called
[51:05] me now what's Romans 8:30 said to many
[51:09] let me just quickly read that to you you
[51:11] don't have to turn there but Romans 8:30
[51:14] says whoever he
[51:16] called he would
[51:24] justify moreover whom he did
[51:26] predestinate them he also
[51:29] called amen have you been
[51:32] called if you heard you had the ability
[51:35] to hear the
[51:36] call amen many are called but not
[51:40] everyone can hear the
[51:42] call many are called but few are chosen
[51:46] so they that are chosen will receive and
[51:48] hear the call how did he call you and I
[51:51] through the
[51:52] word we were in the hour that we were to
[51:56] receive and hear that word for our day
[51:57] and we could hear that word could
[51:59] receive it the Bible said he that
[52:02] heareth my word and believeth on him
[52:03] that sent me is pass from Death To Life
[52:06] shall not come into
[52:08] condemnation okay what am I saying this
[52:11] for because you're free indeed we're
[52:13] trying trying he's trying to show us how
[52:15] free we are indeed if I might say this
[52:19] to be free indeed means in reality in
[52:21] truth in fact so to be free indeed means
[52:24] you're free in reality yeah in truth in
[52:29] fact so it's the truth you're free and
[52:31] it's a fact that you're free and it's
[52:33] real you're
[52:36] free amen he just we just read he said I
[52:39] can't lose
[52:40] them in St John 10 he said and I won't
[52:43] lose one of them amen no man can pluck
[52:47] them out of my
[52:49] hand so why should we fear any man or
[52:53] any organization when you know your free
[52:57] who can bind you to be free indeed to be
[53:01] free means to be at
[53:04] Liberty Amen to be free means not to be
[53:07] under restraint not restrain under
[53:10] restraint to the flesh to sin to death
[53:12] not enslaved to that you're
[53:15] freed amen not being under see not
[53:20] imprisoned and yet we are prisoners but
[53:22] we're not imprisoned to sin death the
[53:25] world we're not imprisoned we're free
[53:28] amen we're
[53:29] released we'll come into that after just
[53:32] a little bit here all right so so we see
[53:36] that who moreover whom he predestinated
[53:40] them he called and whom he called them
[53:41] he also Justified declared righteous and
[53:45] whom he justified them he also
[53:49] glorified it's brother sister you
[53:51] couldn't have it any
[53:53] better you may go through struggles and
[53:55] trials and pressures in this life but
[53:58] you're free
[53:59] indeed there's a reason for pressures
[54:02] there's a reason for trials and test but
[54:05] it's not for your demean it's for your
[54:07] good we'll we'll come into that in just
[54:10] a bit here all right so Galatians 1:16
[54:15] said so when God pleased God who
[54:17] separated me from my mother's womb and
[54:19] called me by his grace see it was
[54:23] Grace that called you you never merited
[54:27] Grace Grace is a free gift it was given
[54:30] to you all right so for for what purpose
[54:34] why did he why did he call me by his
[54:36] grace to reveal to reveal is to unveil
[54:40] to reveal his son in me where in me to
[54:47] reveal his son in me how many have a
[54:49] skull field Bible they looking at
[54:50] there's a little footnote h on there you
[54:52] see that little H right there that says
[54:55] in me
[54:57] we'll go to that in just a minute where
[54:59] that is but to reveal his son in
[55:03] me that I might preach him among the
[55:06] Heathen immediately I conferred not with
[55:08] flesh and blood why he was freed he
[55:10] didn't have to he wasn't conferring with
[55:12] flesh and blood he didn't even have any
[55:14] confidence in the flesh amen I didn't
[55:16] confer with it but he went to the word
[55:18] and proved his experience by the word
[55:22] amen all right so I so he said to reveal
[55:26] his son in me so if we go back to 2
[55:29] Corinthians CH 4 we'll find where Paul
[55:32] referred there in
[55:34] me to reveal it's a
[55:37] birth it's the it's the it's the new
[55:41] birth that revealing of his son in him
[55:44] was the
[55:45] new the new
[55:49] man old things are passed away behold
[55:52] All Things become new so in in 2
[55:58] Corinthians 4: 6 for God who commanded
[56:01] the light are we just saying about it we
[56:04] walk in the light God who commanded the
[56:06] light and God is
[56:08] light to shine out of Darkness has
[56:13] shined who has shined God has shined the
[56:17] light has shined in our hearts to give
[56:19] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[56:23] of God in the face of Jesus Christ so
[56:27] when he turned your heart to the Lord
[56:30] when the when your heart was turned to
[56:31] the Lord the veil was removed why was
[56:34] the veil when the veil was removed
[56:36] something was hid in the veil under that
[56:38] Veil now was made
[56:41] known now was revealed what was that
[56:46] Revelation that predestinated seed was
[56:50] quickened in you the veil was removed
[56:54] and the Word was opened the word where
[56:56] in you and so it comes down here and
[57:00] that Lord is that spirit and where the
[57:03] spirit of the Lord is
[57:05] Glory where the spirit of the Lord is
[57:08] you're free indeed where the spirit of
[57:10] the Lord is there's
[57:12] liberty
[57:14] amen you can walk every day in Liberty
[57:17] you don't have to worry about well I'm
[57:19] going to be up and I'm going to be down
[57:21] you'll have your ups and downs you'll
[57:22] have your failures you'll have this but
[57:24] that does not remove what you are it
[57:26] does not remove your freedom prise the
[57:29] Lord because B by God by Grace gave you
[57:33] life because you had and called you and
[57:35] you heard that
[57:37] call because that life was that seed was
[57:41] laying in you that you were chosen in
[57:44] him that seed was laying in you to be
[57:46] quickened and that quickening you heard
[57:48] the call and could receive
[57:50] it amen amen
[57:53] amen amen
[57:56] so what happened here so but we all with
[58:00] open face I preached on here a while
[58:02] back open face what is that whose face
[58:05] is
[58:06] open it's not David's whose face is open
[58:10] here it's Jesus
[58:13] Christ so then we go over here for then
[58:16] then we're changed into that image being
[58:18] changed we look into a glass we see who
[58:21] we are so we're being changed into that
[58:23] image from glory to glory is that right
[58:27] and that's our
[58:29] ministry 2 Corinthians 4:1 says that's
[58:32] our ministry what's our ministry the
[58:34] unveiling of God what's our ministry the
[58:37] third pull what's our
[58:40] ministry all right
[58:42] so ver or paragraph 290 of Christ The
[58:48] Mystery of God revealed this is the
[58:50] fourth or fifth time I brought this but
[58:52] that's not just because we're bringing
[58:54] it it's speaking something to you
[58:57] watch this it's Jesus Christ the new
[59:00] birth revealed in
[59:03] you what did what did the veil
[59:08] hide what did what the veil was taken
[59:10] away for what when it turned to the Lord
[59:13] the veil was
[59:14] removed amen so the veil being taken
[59:17] away now we come face to face with who
[59:20] we
[59:21] are and all we all with that unveiled
[59:24] face
[59:26] amen are free
[59:28] indeed amen we're we've we've actually
[59:33] raised right
[59:35] there there what a great resurrection
[59:38] that was but what a resurrection this is
[59:40] identifying we raised with him because
[59:42] that open Word in you identifies you are
[59:45] his property you're his eternal

[1:00:03] Birth by the spoken
[1:00:06] word that's why in this hour you had an
[1:00:08] ear to hear that word spoken because you

[1:00:14] me from the beginning so you're my
[1:00:17] Witnesses you're with me from the
[1:00:21] beginning amen then where was it what
[1:00:23] was before the beginning a thought
[1:00:27] because in the beginning was the word
[1:00:28] and the word is a thought
[1:00:31] expressed so you were in me residing in
[1:00:34] me living in me abiding in me alive in
[1:00:38] me before the world began you were the
[1:00:40] very thought of myself and now I brought

[1:01:12] don't know where you come from and who
[1:01:14] you are you don't remember it but all
[1:01:16] that's been restored back because the
[1:01:18] Bible said he would
[1:01:20] restore amen is that right we're being
[1:01:23] restored back to the original faith and
[1:01:25] the original faith is God's
[1:01:27] faith what he had before the foundation
[1:01:30] of the world you weren't existing in him
[1:01:32] as a as a feeling you weren't existing
[1:01:35] as a as as you say it was a thought but
[1:01:38] that thought was substance that thought
[1:01:40] was faith and when God spoke even spoke
[1:01:43] the worlds into existence when he spoke
[1:01:45] you he spoke you into existence for you
[1:01:48] were with me Jesus said you're my
[1:01:49] witness for you're with me from the
[1:01:51] beginning why having an ear to hear him
[1:01:54] hear the word for the hour I identifies
[1:01:56] it's revealed to you which is your
[1:01:58] evidence that that holy spirit that you
[1:02:00] were called and alive in him and you are
[1:02:04] his
[1:02:05] property then you're free indeed for
[1:02:08] because who the sun sets free is free

[1:02:42] before the world began it was in Christ
[1:02:45] and now you've receival you received
[1:02:48] that token which identifies your faith
[1:02:52] is God's faith you say if I just had
[1:02:54] Faith you have faith' amen God will
[1:02:57] reveal the faith he Reveals His Faith to
[1:02:59] you amen he reveals himself to you for

[1:07:30] revealed in you we're talking about the
[1:07:33] headship of Christ notice being
[1:07:35] personally identified by the original
[1:07:37] headship we have the answer to the
[1:07:39] devil's question yes amen glory we have
[1:07:43] the answer to the devil's question he
[1:07:45] Christ is risen and has paid the price
[1:07:47] in raising up the body the devil can't
[1:07:50] stand it that's the reason these
[1:07:52] ecuminical kingdoms are setting up
[1:07:54] that's the reason they're all coming
[1:07:56] into what they're doing
[1:08:00] now amen and it's it's happening
[1:08:04] now
[1:08:06] amen and it's very it's very
[1:08:09] subtle all right the devil that's the
[1:08:12] reason he's howling the way he is his
[1:08:14] wickedness and his schemes been
[1:08:15] uncovered by the Risen resurrected
[1:08:18] Christ in the headship over his
[1:08:21] body
[1:08:23] amen you think I'm beside myself I'm not
[1:08:26] we got the devil's
[1:08:28] answer amen amen not me that liveth not
[1:08:32] me that liveth it's not you living it's
[1:08:35] not the man you
[1:08:37] living that's right oh but my goodness
[1:08:40] we say well I failed I guess that's it
[1:08:42] no no when you're free indeed there's no
[1:08:45] failure hello amen you say but I failed
[1:08:48] here but you didn't fail
[1:08:51] here when that's revealed in you there's
[1:08:54] no failure well that just gives me the I
[1:08:57] can just have Liberty to do whatever I
[1:08:58] want yes but there's one thing you don't
[1:08:59] desire to do and that's do anything
[1:09:02] contrary to the word and yet you'll fall
[1:09:05] and yet you'll
[1:09:06] fail I don't mean Fall Away to apostasy
[1:09:10] I'm talking about just falling daily
[1:09:12] daily we backslide daily we make
[1:09:14] failures daily we say things we didn't
[1:09:16] want to say do things we don't want to
[1:09:18] do that brother
[1:09:21] sister what makes the difference is the
[1:09:24] seed word word in you made
[1:09:27] alive that's what gives you the freedom
[1:09:30] God called you you didn't produce it you
[1:09:32] didn't do it you didn't marit it God
[1:09:34] knew you God predestinated you God chose
[1:09:36] you it's all God's working it's all
[1:09:38] God's achievement it's God in you
[1:09:40] working and he's going to bring you and
[1:09:42] fulfilled his purpose that he had for
[1:09:44] you amen it can't fail it just can't
[1:09:46] fail you're free
[1:09:48] indeed all right so
[1:09:57] so he says here now I had a I had a
[1:10:01] scripture here the reason I'm hesitating
[1:10:02] a minute there was
[1:10:06] a oh no it wasn't
[1:10:13] uh well maybe we'll come across it's all
[1:10:16] right we've got the devil's answer not
[1:10:18] me that liveth but Christ that liveth in
[1:10:20] me it's not my idea it's his power not
[1:10:23] my idea it's his word he promised it
[1:10:26] here it
[1:10:28] is how many can say this day personally
[1:10:32] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:10:35] me Amen in you he said it would be here
[1:10:40] and here it is amen we got his answer we
[1:10:43] have Satan's answer God has Vindicated
[1:10:46] himself God proves himself to his
[1:10:47] promise in the last day Hallelujah the
[1:10:50] headship is
[1:10:52] here amen Christ the Risen Lord he is he
[1:10:55] is here in the same power of his
[1:10:58] resurrection that he ever was
[1:10:59] manifesting himself there's the devil's
[1:11:03] answer let me read that again he said he
[1:11:06] said the headship is here amen Christ
[1:11:10] the Risen Lord is here in the same power
[1:11:14] of his resurrection that he ever
[1:11:17] was manifesting
[1:11:22] himself there's the devil
[1:11:28] answer when he wants to come and accuse
[1:11:30] you tell him his accusing is he can he
[1:11:33] can't accuse you there is no
[1:11:35] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:11:39] Jesus amen he can accuse all he wants
[1:11:42] but is but as accusing who is he accuses
[1:11:45] you Christ has Justified you already
[1:11:48] declared you righteous he's going to
[1:11:51] accuse you of not being righteous he's a
[1:11:53] liar because you've already you you are
[1:11:55] already righteous this isn't an idea
[1:11:57] that you formed in your mind it's not an
[1:11:59] imagination it's a revelation it's a
[1:12:06] reality all right he said the headship
[1:12:09] and the body has become one unit it's
[1:12:12] Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in
[1:12:14] you the headship and the body has become
[1:12:16] one
[1:12:17] unit it's God manifested in
[1:12:21] you it's in his people that's the reason
[1:12:24] the husband wife is no longer
[1:12:28] Twain amen they're
[1:12:32] one you received his seed you received
[1:12:35] that germ you're
[1:12:38] one amen amen yet that Oneness isn't
[1:12:42] like me and my wife CU my wife could be
[1:12:44] somewhere else and I'd be here and yet
[1:12:46] I'm still one with her but Jesus said my
[1:12:48] my wife and I are one if you've seen me
[1:12:51] if you see me he said you've seen God if
[1:12:54] you see the bride you see Christ yeah
[1:12:57] amen
[1:12:59] amen that's
[1:13:02] right so that kind of Oneness is
[1:13:05] different amen because he's in you all

[1:16:50] that sent me and this is the will which
[1:16:54] has sent me

[1:24:53] of God Peter called it the blood of
[1:24:55] Christ Paul called it the blood of the
[1:24:57] Lord and the blood of Jesus one person
[1:25:01] that is that is that Revelation again

[1:25:09] a virgin birth and indwell it that he
[1:25:11] might be the that that it might be the

[1:25:45] will keep you so loaded up with
[1:25:47] everything else including the internet
[1:25:48] and videos and and this this this this
[1:25:52] line and this line and this chat line
[1:25:54] and that chat line and all you see what
[1:25:57] is
[1:25:58] happening Satan knows that faith comes
[1:26:01] by hearing the word yes
[1:26:08] amen he'll steal it remember he's the
[1:26:12] thief he comes to steal and
[1:26:15] destroy but Jesus said I am come to give
[1:26:18] life and that more
[1:26:21] abundantly so where's our choice

[1:26:36] now you try all you want to do and live
[1:26:39] it you can't live it in your own body
[1:26:40] your own fleshly man you'll never live
[1:26:43] it you can frustrate and get FR that's
[1:26:46] just the exactly what the devil wants
[1:26:48] but as soon as you turn to the word and
[1:26:50] say but he did this for me he gave it to
[1:26:52] me that's mine regardless less of how I
[1:26:55] feel amen then what's going to happen is
[1:26:58] going to make him mad but there's his
[1:27:00] answer it's not I that liveth but Christ
[1:27:03] that liveth in me and the life I now
[1:27:05] live in this flesh I live by the faith
[1:27:07] of the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:27:09] himself for
[1:27:11] me and it's not me that liveth it's

[1:27:34] opened walk in the
[1:27:37] light well it makes the devil mad I
[1:27:40] don't care how mad he gets or how many
[1:27:41] don't want to believe it I
[1:27:43] do there's going to be somebody believe
[1:27:45] it though she's a minority she's in the
[1:27:47] minority
[1:27:48] today she has a great big system that's
[1:27:51] against her and they will try to destroy
[1:27:53] her
[1:27:55] amen but they won't do it she'll be
[1:27:57] taken
[1:27:58] up all
[1:28:01] right would you like an Old Testament
[1:28:03] type let's go back to the Garden of
[1:28:07] Eden see the blood freed us okay let's
[1:28:10] go back to the Garden of Eden when the
[1:28:11] when the news came to Glory that his son
[1:28:13] Adam had been lost did God send an angel
[1:28:17] did he send a son did he send another
[1:28:20] one like us no what' he do
[1:28:25] who was calling for Adam who came down
[1:28:27] looking for him who came himself see God
[1:28:31] did he came himself to redeem that lost
[1:28:34] son Hallelujah God did not entrust his
[1:28:37] plan to of Salvation to another he
[1:28:39] trusted only
[1:28:41] himself amen so what are you trusting
[1:28:46] in he said I'm trusting in God then
[1:28:48] you're trusting in yourself
[1:28:51] too the real self amen the real
[1:28:56] person all
[1:28:58] right he trusted only himself God was
[1:29:01] made flesh and dwelt among us he has
[1:29:03] today that's what he is doing today and
[1:29:05] redeemed us unto himself we're saved and
[1:29:08] if he came down not only brother Brown
[1:29:10] said he didn't complete Redemption on
[1:29:12] the cross he started it his completion
[1:29:16] of redemption is when he took the book
[1:29:18] and claimed his redeemed rights that
[1:29:20] finishes
[1:29:22] Redemption now we have the complete
[1:29:25] revelation of Christ amen and you're
[1:29:29] that completeness you're that Capstone
[1:29:31] of that
[1:29:33] creation amen amen amen what manner of
[1:29:37] people ought we to be when we know we
[1:29:39] are free
[1:29:42] indeed amen and we can't be shut up we
[1:29:46] can't be closed up we're taken
[1:29:49] up all right so now he he were saved by
[1:29:54] the blood of God the Eternal God indwelt
[1:29:57] a mortal body in order to take away sin
[1:30:00] he became the lamb in order to shed his
[1:30:02] blood and entered into the veil with it
[1:30:04] then where would where did he Enter he
[1:30:06] went entered into the veil where is that
[1:30:09] he entered into your soul is what he did
[1:30:12] he could enter in because that was
[1:30:14] inside the
[1:30:16] veil amen how he had to make the way for
[1:30:19] the veil to be
[1:30:21] rent amen and he did amen consider this
[1:30:25] since it is the blood of God then it is
[1:30:28] perfect blood listen to me
[1:30:32] carefully since consider this tonight
[1:30:35] consider this since it is the blood of
[1:30:38] God it is perfect
[1:30:40] blood and if the perfect blood is
[1:30:43] loosing or washing us loosing us freeing
[1:30:46] us from the power and bondage and
[1:30:48] defilement of sin then the loosing is
[1:30:51] perfect and complete
[1:30:54] amen amen and you know that because he's
[1:30:58] given you the token of his own life then
[1:31:00] the loosing is complete and it's perfect
[1:31:03] you're completely perfectly
[1:31:06] loosed you're freed
[1:31:08] indeed
[1:31:10] amen that's right the loosing is perfect
[1:31:13] and complete so therefore there is now

[1:31:18] condemnation then is God going to come
[1:31:20] with condemnation when you're loosed and
[1:31:22] freed from condemn ation and he paid the
[1:31:25] Judgment of it for you and you were in

[1:40:00] close amen these things are quickly you
[1:40:03] know the pope up here he's having been
[1:40:05] in the
[1:40:06] hospital one word says he's about ready
[1:40:09] to die the well he's feeling pretty good
[1:40:10] but they won't really come out and say
[1:40:12] how he
[1:40:13] is but you know what you know what let
[1:40:16] me just pass this on to you I wonder if
[1:40:18] the next one's coming out of the United
[1:40:21] States look what the Prophet said
[1:40:23] paragraph 87 of of a message called acts
[1:40:26] of the Holy
[1:40:27] Spirit 541 1219 evening 54 I believe one
[1:40:32] of these glorious
[1:40:33] days when the United Confederation of
[1:40:36] church goes together and brother sister
[1:40:38] they are going together they are
[1:40:40] becoming very politically strong and
[1:40:43] what they do is going to look real
[1:40:45] reasonable because the buck against that
[1:40:48] they're going to be they're going to
[1:40:49] come they're going to go together
[1:40:51] they're and and they they own phenomenal
[1:40:54] wealth in fact they own so much
[1:40:56] phenomenal wealth that every perfect
[1:40:58] time they can buy it
[1:41:00] out she can they she become politically
[1:41:03] strong how they doing
[1:41:05] it see you see how it's
[1:41:08] working you see you see what the spirit
[1:41:11] am I lost my mic I lost my mic okay it's
[1:41:15] still on though
[1:41:18] okay okay I guess I'm
[1:41:20] back they become politically strong I
[1:41:23] could read a lot of quotes to you right
[1:41:24] now I had some things marked down I'll
[1:41:26] have to get it another time but there's
[1:41:30] a Temptation don't you fall under that
[1:41:32] Temptation we're not just reading words
[1:41:34] here to be reading them tonight we're
[1:41:36] not just saying what we're saying just
[1:41:38] to be saying it rely upon
[1:41:42] God Amen stay true to that word and he's
[1:41:46] trying to tell you you are free just
[1:41:49] walk in your freedom walk with me just
[1:41:51] walk with me let go and let me as our
[1:41:54] Pro our Pastor said let go and let God
[1:41:56] have his wonderful way then let
[1:42:00] go let go of yourself let go and take
[1:42:04] God at his word take him at his
[1:42:07] word
[1:42:09] amen while we look not at the things
[1:42:12] which are seen but the things which are
[1:42:14] not seen for the things seen are
[1:42:16] temporal how can you put any confidence
[1:42:18] in something temporal but in the Unseen
[1:42:22] the Eternal
[1:42:25] things getting back to that quote one of
[1:42:29] these days when the confederation of
[1:42:30] church goes together and they're binding
[1:42:32] they're bound remember they're Bound in
[1:42:33] the bundle is bound they're bound and
[1:42:36] The Binding is that that Confederation
[1:42:38] of church that ecumenical council
[1:42:41] they're coming right together in it
[1:42:43] uniting together that's the
[1:42:46] binding amen that's the binding all
[1:42:49] right I believe one of these days when
[1:42:51] the at church come together and the new
[1:42:53] pope is brought out of the United States
[1:42:57] and put over there according to prophecy
[1:42:59] then they'll form an image like unto the
[1:43:02] Beast exactly what they're heading for
[1:43:06] now who Mo what's motivating this this
[1:43:11] President see what's motivating I can
[1:43:13] tell you what's motivating it's the
[1:43:15] spirit it's the spirit of the Beast it's
[1:43:20] the spirit of Rome
[1:43:26] she's behind every bit of it now I know
[1:43:28] that goes
[1:43:29] online he said be careful what you say
[1:43:31] I'm I'm careful what I say I'm saying
[1:43:34] the truth am that's right all right so
[1:43:37] and I tell you the Church of God will be
[1:43:39] drove together an IM we make an image to
[1:43:41] the Beast and I tell you when these
[1:43:43] things happen the True Church of God
[1:43:45] will be drove together the real true
[1:43:47] believers that have come out of
[1:43:49] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[1:43:51] Pentecostal Nazarene Pilgrim Hol is
[1:43:53] Catholic and whatever they'll be will be
[1:43:55] will go together and cemented by the
[1:43:57] love of God that will make the body of
[1:44:00] the Lord Jesus
[1:44:02] Christ all the Believers and an
[1:44:06] agnostics and the agnostics and the
[1:44:08] shallow-minded will be cast will be cast
[1:44:12] to one side they'll go right on into the
[1:44:15] confederation of
[1:44:17] churches you see there's been a
[1:44:18] separating now it's all separating the
[1:44:21] two Vines are mature
[1:44:25] in thought I'd drop that in if you ever
[1:44:27] wonder where that is he did say it all
[1:44:33] right but before the wheat matures both
[1:44:37] true and false Vine are coming maturity
[1:44:39] but before the wheat matures those
[1:44:41] ripened tears must be bound for the
[1:44:44] burning now they're not burned all at
[1:44:46] once but they are
[1:44:48] bound and the burning comes
[1:44:51] later see they are all joining they are
[1:44:54] all joining the World Council of
[1:44:56] churches that is The
[1:45:00] Binding soon the garnering of the wheat
[1:45:02] will come the Gathering of the wheat the
[1:45:05] garnering of the wheat what gathers the
[1:45:08] wheat shout voice a
[1:45:11] trumpet gathers the wheat into the
[1:45:15] Garner all right that's happening
[1:45:18] brother sister I think we ought to get
[1:45:20] on
[1:45:21] board amen it's you know the Train's
[1:45:23] only stopping once
[1:45:26] here amen we better throw down the bag
[1:45:29] of
[1:45:31] peanuts or it's
[1:45:35] leaving amen that's right that's the
[1:45:38] truth you can't play around with it
[1:45:40] anymore the Train's here one stop that's
[1:45:43] it it's moving on going on to the east
[1:45:47] going on to
[1:45:50] Israel the bride's being called away
[1:45:53] you say is she yes she is she is and
[1:45:57] soon it'll manifest itself in a body
[1:46:00] change amen all right
[1:46:06] now as many as I love and rebuke I
[1:46:09] chasen now this is where I'm I'm
[1:46:12] ending as many as I love and
[1:46:16] rebuke and chasen he said to rebuke is
[1:46:20] to reprove
[1:46:23] so rebuke means to
[1:46:26] reprove to reprove is to expose with a
[1:46:29] view to
[1:46:30] correction Chason doesn't mean to punish
[1:46:33] you Chason means to discipline
[1:46:37] you so he's he rebukes he reproves and
[1:46:41] he
[1:46:42] disciplines isn't that
[1:46:45] wonderful all right we have a father he
[1:46:48] reproves and
[1:46:51] disciplines because the sub object's
[1:46:53] amendment is in mind other words he's
[1:46:55] got a purpose for
[1:46:59] that he's got a purpose to train you see
[1:47:03] herein is now set forth the love of God
[1:47:06] and he desired in his love a family of
[1:47:09] his own a family of Sons Sons like
[1:47:17] himself there therefore before him there
[1:47:21] before him lies all mankind is one lump
[1:47:24] of clay out of that same lump will he
[1:47:27] now make vessels unto honor and to
[1:47:29] dishonor the choosing will be his own
[1:47:32] choosing then those chosen ones born of
[1:47:35] his spirit will be
[1:47:37] trained will be trained to conform to
[1:47:40] His Image in their walk he reproves with
[1:47:44] all longsuffering and gentleness and
[1:47:46] mercy he disciplines with nail scarred
[1:47:49] hands sometimes this Potter must take
[1:47:52] the vessel is working on and thoroughly
[1:47:54] break it down in order that he may
[1:47:56] rebuild it exactly as he desires
[1:48:00] it but it is love that is love and
[1:48:04] another way there is not there cannot be
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:32] he said there would be a strength I
[1:48:33] can't find that right now so I'm not
[1:48:35] going to try to find it
[1:48:42] but he talked about
[1:48:44] the this little flock he
[1:48:48] said he
[1:48:50] said that denominational Church will
[1:48:53] church will seek to destroy the
[1:48:55] bride and it'll be a threefold as a
[1:48:58] threefold cord is not easily broken
[1:49:02] you'll have you'll have the power of
[1:49:05] physical political power and Satan
[1:49:08] satanical power he said now the bride
[1:49:11] they'll seek to destroy the bride but
[1:49:14] she will she will
[1:49:16] suffer but she will
[1:49:19] endure so brother sister let's stand

[1:49:29] forward to she will endure
