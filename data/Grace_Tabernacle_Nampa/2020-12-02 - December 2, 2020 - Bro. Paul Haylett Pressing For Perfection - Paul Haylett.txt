all in control he's got it all in contr control he put that reassurance weigh down in my [Music] soul he's got it all in control I like the second verse I put my life in his hand I put my life in his hands so every road I walk down I'm sure it's in his plan I put my life in his hands my father knows my father knows what I need my father knows what I [Applause] need and everything I go through he knows what's best for me my father knows what I needs cuz he's got it all in control he's got it all in control [Music] he's got it all in control put that reassurance way down in my soul he's got it all in control it's got it all in control he's got it all [Music] in put that reassurance way down in my soul he got it all in [Music] control Hallelujah definitely something we can say Amen to tonight amen knowing that our God has got everything in control you know sometimes you just have little things in life and we might call them a scare you know little thing that just comes up but you know the word of God just so clearly declares that when Satan would come in like a flood that's God just raises a standard up now God doesn't run out and find a standard to put in the way it's already in US amen the standard is already been provided it's already right here we just need to sit and say Lord you've got it in control and we just leave it in your hands thank you so much amen let's just uh rise this evening and turn in our Bibles amen as we just go on the overall topic of preparation of the inner man I just want to speak tonight um this might be a if I'm using the the words correctly a little bit of an amalgamation of different thoughts that uh we have spoke recently so if you say hey wait brother Paul used that scripture here while back or he spoke on that it it's just kind of a little collection tonight and and uh from my heart I I really want to say it it's meant as a encouragement that we could just look back through the word of God what what it says about us and what God has already done and we have that evidence right in our midst we're not a people who are sitting here saying well if God's ever going to do anything he should do it we're a people who can say God's already doing it amen he's already providing we're already seeing these things come to pass amen and so as we look at this I Pray tonight it just be a blessing to you so we turn in our Bibles to the Book of James the first chapter uh starting with the first verse uh we shall uh read several verses here and then we'll skip to the 17th verse James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ and I believe that's how we are identified to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren count it all joy when you fall in diverse Temptations amen knowing this at the trying of your faith amen so every one of us has a personal faith right it's been marked for us it is our faith the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing and if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally I like this scripture I've read it many times here to the church because it just strikes a chord in my heart God's not stingy no God's not like I'm I'm going to run out of this I better Dole this out very carefully no he says here that he giveth to all men liberally and up Brath not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord see we can't start our day off God loves me and finish our day off I'm not sure God loves me you you have to stand solid you have to believe you're a son or daughter of God you have to believe you're the bride you can't waver this back and forth because what'll happen is in the very moment that you need doubt will rob you you know the robber never sends a warning at 12:01 I'm walking in your bank and taking all your money he always comes at the unexpected now I just want to put this to you that's what the devil does he he recognizes that God's doing something and he waits as close as he can to the climax of what he believes God is doing and he starts dropping his balms and throwing his doubts and his fears and we have to recognize we're not going to receive anything of God if we are sitting here filled with doubt and fear a double minded man is unstable in all his ways let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away for the son is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man Fade Away in his ways blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him we shall go to verse 17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning thank you Lord Heavenly Father we just ask for your hand upon the service tonight Lord upon the Saints Lord that are called this church home we just ask you Lord wherever they may be tonight whatever their circumstance is Father may your Holy Spirit Reach Out touch their hearts stir them Father we pray Lord draw all of us into your presence we ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as we look at this tonight I often times as I read this scripture you can look at that and see if you pluck one portion of it you could become discouraged you could look at that and think you know what um it's going to be so difficult at the trying of my faith and if you're not careful you will remember the failures and not the victories you will remember the difficulties and not those things that brought a great joy and praise to your lips so as we submit oursel to the word we must always take all of the word We Can't Stop and and just dwell on the negative we have to take all the what you might say the beautiful portions of scripture those things that bring joy to our heart and you know I just coming down here um in verse 17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness well look at that my brother and sister see God God doesn't come as we might in the human nature we'll come one day and we'll be happy and maybe similar circumstances we won't be happy and sometimes we we have a different point of view and depends on what's going on around us and you know you hang out with positive people you'll have positive actions and reactions you hang around with negative people you will find yourself caught up in a negative frame of mind but you see God's not that way and so what God says is good is good and what God Said is evil is evil and if God says I'm going to bless you then you can count on being blessed you don't have to question whether today will be different or not amen and so I I love that and I love good gifts anyone love a good gift amen a perfect gift amen but God has given that because he come in his word and he promised that to you and I that in this hour this would be the hour that he would manifest himself to his bride and it's not just coming down you see God uh presents himself aresh in every generation every Church age God come down and print it not a new message not a new approach not a new but he brings himself aresh and comes down to remind the people that no matter what age that you were born or called to rise up in then in that age God is present he's alive it is uh the power of the Resurrection is being manifested to us and it's a matter for you and I if we are going to uh look at that and say you know what I receive the word for my day I receive the word for my hour it won't do any good Saints um and this could go vice versa but it don't do any good for me to say I receive it for you you have to yourself rise up and say I receive this and I claim my healing amen I I claim my position in the body amen now sometimes we look at this and say you know what I I uh uh I I believe you know that I have been healed by his stripes now my brother and sister that's wonderful that you believe but do you believe God loved you enough to make that real that you can step out with absolute confidence and claim that you see just taking it as a bit of knowledge and acknowledging the word says it is not sufficient it has to be anchored deep down in us that we can come my brother and sister and say thank you my brother and sister let me just uh put this uh a little nugget from Sunday that I didn't get to uh you see we must be fully p persuaded amen do you know God's fully persuaded about you he didn't come along with any variableness or turning he said you're my son you're my daughter and he never wavered from that he never said well if you come along and and you don't just behave right today you're not my son or daughter any longer you see just as sold out as you would be about God God is sold out about you and God wants to heal you brother brandham says this God wants to heal you more than you want to be healed amen he wants to fill us with his holy spirit even more than we want to be filled and and that's because he's entirely sold out about you he's entirely persuaded about who you are and if we can just reciprocate that back to God and completely be persuaded that when God said he wants to fill us with the Holy Ghost he wants to fill me so bad amen it's not just how bad I want it but God's there wanting to fill me amen and fill you amen now we'll look here and second Corinthians uh looking in uh 12th chapter starting the 9th verse there and he said and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee I I think that ought to just stir our hearts with a little Joy tonight that that he's not saying now it's going to get a little sketchy down here in leod deia it's going to get a little down here at the end of time it it is it is going to you know I've poured out a lot of Grace Through the Ages I poured out a lot to uh mankind I poured out a lot in leoda and so when we get down to the end of this leod to see and age it's going to get a little thin so we got to be real careful no my brother and sister he said my grace oh if we could take that as an absolute uh anchored in the Rock statement my grace is sufficient this is not us abusing but God is telling you no matter what comes your way and no matter what tricks that the devil would throw in front of you and no matter what the tumble and struggle of life will be my grace is sufficient oh I tell you when you can walk in absolute confidence of who you are and the world we live in this scripture should just cause our heart to burst amen because knowing that God's telling you right here can I read between the lines tonight amen he's telling you you cannot fall am no matter what would happen in your life my Grace will be there as your safety net and it's going to catch you no matter if Satan pours every Spirit every demon of hell and pursues you relentlessly my grace is sufficient for you oh I tell you I say thank you Lord amen for my strength is made perfect in weakness Paul is speaking here to the Corinthians and my brother and sister he's speaking of the things that God has spoken to him this is not Paul's opinion this is not Paul's interpretation but this is the very message that God gave Paul on the backside of a desert and so now I want you to see the sincerity of this coming forth is that Paul himself went through his whole life with the great burden that he was the least Among Us for what he had done to the body of Christ he carried a great burden a great level you might of guilt uh uh that Satan would try to throw back upon him and no doubt uh this just me as a man looking but no doubt he could remember of the faces of those that he had put to death of those that he threw in the prison but yet Paul this Revelation was so real to him that he could come and I believe from the complete sincerity of his heart he could come and speak the words that God spoke to him and declare my grace is sufficient for thee Paul and now Paul as a carrier of the word comes forth and now he is not saying hey this is my Revelation I'm bringing to you but he's now just the conduit that has come and declared what God was sharing and that is God's grace is sufficient and strength is made perfect in weakness amen now he's there speaking and he puts it in his words here he says uh most gladly therefore would I rather glory in my infirmity not boasting in the power not of what I have delivered and Spirits I've cast out and how deep God took me into the word of God I would rather tell you how little I am I would rather tell you how weak I am what my inabilities are that's what I want to tell you about and then I want to declare to you that my God delivered me out of that and brought me into his word that's oh oh Hallelujah that stir my heart many times it is the very nature of mankind that we would like to be able to to share of the great things and of us and God spoke to me and I prayed for this person and they were healed or delivered or this and that and that's wonderful my brother and sister but there's a time for us to acknowledge I am nothing without him I have no strength I have no knowledge I have no I am not sufficient but in him oh in my weakness he is made strong and I think that's something Saints we can glory in tonight is that we don't have to come it's not a boast of our ability it's not a boast of accomplishment but it is boast that God has never failed us amen that no matter what we come up against and no matter what our struggle might be as we would find ourselves maybe fading as it were as the flower In the Heat of the day we find oursel fading we find God raising us up oh hallelujah amen that the power of Christ see it's in the weakness amen it's not in the boasting or strength but in the weakness that the power of Christ comes and rests upon us hallelujah because when a man tells you how great he is he's speaking often times from vanity amen now we have to be careful we don't judge someone that way to to acknowledge that God has done great things to acknowledge that God has come and healed at the hands being laid upon in prayer that God has come and delivered under the power of prayer we want to be careful we don't look at all these things and say Vanity Vanity that's right but you'll find that when a man feels a need to lift himself up it's because he sees something in himself that is great or trying to acknowledge I say God help us we're not worthy of nothing but death but he granted life and I say tonight thank you Lord amen my heart just just is is oh you might say smitten and is just swelling within me to realize how much God loves us hallelujah isn't it wonderful amen because he you see he wants to see you weak yep yeah that's exactly right that the Holy Ghost can come down in you amen that's exactly right and make something out of us amen not eyes of man but to the plan of God exactly right you see we recognize it's not the strength of the believer no no sir the scripture clearly tells us that's right that when we would be lifted up that's it is when we fall into Satan's trap amen so it's not the strength of the believer but it's the strength of the Life in The Believer amen that's right Hallelujah and if God is in you and I tonight my brother and sister we cannot fail we've got every bit of strength we've got every bit of authority we can stand upon the word of God and if we do slip and Satan would say oh I got you right there God's already got a remedy that we can stand on our heart would say oh Lord forgive me and when we find confidence to press forward just on the way to church sister Jerry and I listening to the prophet he's talking about the lady that got caught up in the Social Circle and her daddy got put upstairs reading a encyclopedia on geography or whatever and she just wanted to be quiet while the Social Circle is going on but pretty soon the house begins to shake and he starts a screaming and a holler and she goes up there daddy you don't even have your Bible what's going on and he said oh honey I was just reading in this book right here and there's a sea and they can't find the bottom of it he said oh hallelujah hallelujah to know that my sins are in the sea of God's forgetfulness and he can't even remember brother brandom goes on to say you see you and I can't forget that's it but the amazing thing is is that God can forgive us and then completely did you hear me completely not 98% not 99% not 99 9% but then God can completely forget about that when it's there under the blood of Jesus Christ oh don't you wish as humans we could do that Hallelujah many a husband many a wife you know if they have troubles in their life you know they get to argueing I'm not talking about people here I'm not meaning anybody in general but just overall they get to argue and something gets up maybe they've been married for 20 years you know and maybe the wife will say well you know after we was married just 3 months you promised me this and you never done it well I'll tell you what the man will stand there I can almost assure you the man will stand there and say did I really do that I don't remember doing that is that possible would I have said that and the odds already did but you see we as humans humans we're completely capable of forgiving right Sons and Daughters of God completely capable of forgiving if not we need to get to the altar ourselves but one of our greatest battles is the memory to forget about those things but I tell you if you have forgiven it that's right then it should not bring any ey to you that's it it should not raise your blood pressure No it should not cause you to clinch your teeth or your fist if you've truly forgiven it if you find yourself having this kind of reaction then you might need to go back and let the last drgs of that go to the Altar and let it pass away to remember yes sir yes sir yes sir that's actually you know that's one of the reasons you see that we become tired now this is a human nature this is the element we're dealing with that God uses this the way he created us he uses this actually to move us it's not always what we would see as some visual Supernatural but God actually lets us as Sons and Daughters of God get to the place that we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of the condition of our life and that moves us you say well it was powerful preaching it was this it takes this to do it it takes a Revival an evangelist of this sometimes it just God comes down and anoints you to be sick and tired of the position you're in and then you realize I don't have to be in this position maybe the preaching uh reminds you I don't have to be in this position I I have made a decision that placed me here but now Lord I'm Letting Go with this I'm letting go of my anger at my husband my wife my children my parents the pastor the this the that uh the conditions of all these things I'm letting go of that so that I can be free amen amen that's the Liberty I'm looking for it's not about them my brother and sister I preached it many times I'll say it again tonight it's not about the trial but it's how you react to it that's right amen you can react and find Victory or you can react and find stress and strains right once again I want to reiterate this it's not the strength that you have no sir it's the strength of the life in you that's amen Hebrews 11:38 of whom the world was not worthy I can say Amen they were a people that this world was not worthy but you know God's replicating that there's people walking on this earth right now that this world is not worthy of them they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith never even got the promise right now you talk about my brother and sister Faith holding on to something you know we've all seen the the little example of it the proverbial uh uh little donkey pulling the cart with the pole with the carrot hanging on it now I don't mean to imply that's how God works right but you see the Promise was always out in front of them and they were always looking to that promise but they never obtained it you see God has led his word or put in such a way that every should every believer should be looking for the coming of the Lord in their day now if you'd understand me tonight there's the carrot there's the carrot if you understand I don't mean that disrespectful but God's putting it in front of the people this is the day this is the day and you live like that and you know why God did that cuz we're humans I I'm a firm believer Saints this is just opinion throw it out if you don't like it but I'm a firm believer that if God showed us that he wasn't coming till 2024 we'd get pretty sloppy we would just church going would be a formality and when it come on Easter morning morning 2024 we'd all be prayed up and ready to go but that's not way God wanted it he wants us prayed up and ready to go every single day amen that's so God has he puts that in such a fashion that we but you know what it becomes the very life nobody's behind us saying Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready do we have gentle reminders you know I shared that quote with you and scriptures concerning how that the Holy Spirit brother Bram says you know he hammers the dross out of you he takes that gospel hammer and he hammers that dross out of you now I'll tell you God knows what he's doing so they all had a good report you couldn't find fault in their life but they didn't receive the promise but now look at verse 40 God having provided some better thing for us now I you know people have questioned before do you think that we have more than they did in other ages what does this scripture say God's provided something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect so the final ingredient of the final age right the the bride right that's usen the spirit anointing us we say come we're the one anointed in this hour my brother and sister to speak the good news of the Gospel we're the one that's anointed to live this good news out and in the Fulfillment of that we now finishing the work that they lived and preached all those ages we now coming to the fullness of that we don't drop the Baton you all know what a relay race is amen you know many times you see it uh you know you you could probably go on the Internet or something and just find something that shows every one of them that ever dropped it but it don't matter how well the race was run my brother and sister when they come to the last hand off which was the leodan age amen when the Baton was handed off off if that gets dropped then then all the effort of all the rest is just falling out you see God knew and we don't want to be boastful get lifted up but you see I think it would be fair to say that God saved some of his very best for this last day to grab the Baton of this gospel and be able to run not looking at what today is not looking at this but as we spoke on Sunday to give our best amen you don't want the guy that's going to run with the Baton who says uh oh I'm far enough ahead of everyone I can just slow down and walk and wave at everybody you don't want that guy you want the guy who runs the race that is set before him and he runs it in sincerity and he runs it with all that is within him to finish this race amen so as God has given some better thing for us amen what was he doing he's giving us now study this out if you need to the fullness of the godhead bodily this is the hour that the fullness of the godhead bodily is expressed and God said I'm going to manifest myself so clearly in the people of this age there will be no doubt that it's me and not them there'll be no doubt it's not a special race as in an Aryan race or a this or that but it will be that special race of people that are able to go to a backside of their desert and die out and come forth telling this is what God says I can live it you can live it this is the word his grace is sufficient Hallelujah I want you to just think about how incredible that was in its day for them to grasp that just as it was in L uh Luther's day to grasp the idea that the just shall live by faith we'll look at that and say Yes praise the Lord that's good but imagine the revelation when it struck them am come on I want you to grasp that when that Revelation struck them that was such an incredible thing and it would have become a lightning rod in the church Someone said no we live by the church we live by what the church said but when those that caught that Revelation the just shall live by faith and we can put in the prefix and add to the end of that how they do in this modern uh English uh put our little parentheses and add that context faith in the word amen you see it wasn't faith in Martin Luther it wasn't faith in the system it was faith in the word and when they read the word themselves for the first time and it struck a cord in their heart you weren't sending them back you weren't sending them back to some church you weren't sending them back to an organization because they had caught that revelation now brother Chad Lamb made a kind of a h a statement I might not have the exact words right but I just was listening to just a little clip uh uh brother Chad the other day brother Chad made this statement he said Revelation brings Warfare yes sir when you get a revelation of the word Satan is angry and you can expect that Nest you might say of Satan to be stirred up and you can see him then Onslaught the believer to try to get him to back up from this revelation of the word that he has received I tell you what my brother and sister when you are struck by Revelation you better make sure you got the armor on cuz Satan's going to come roaring out of the dark he's going to do everything he can to knock the wheels off of your wagon but you might as well just know that when God opens your heart and you see who you are you know it's a theme and I I say this just not that I have this great vast knowledge but but my brother and sister little tidbits come here and there and comments that come it's being preached in Europe and being preached in Africa South America who are you recognize who you are amen when that Revelation comes down Satan's going to come in and try and knock you away from the revelation of who you are cuz if he can get you back to being a churchgoer a church member uh relying on someone more spiritual than you to guide you if he can knock you back to that position then he's got control of you but when the bride of Christ recognizes who she is my brother and sister the prophet of God I call it a famous quote myself because it is very well read very well shared and when we recognize who we are we become the Invincible Army that's right Hallelujah but Satan wants to bind you he'll fight you over that that's right he'll fight you over that he don't want you to come to that position amen you see we're not called to fail no fail not a should not even be in our vocabulary that's right we shouldn't even know my brother and sister we know the goal that is set before us anyone here tonight anyone listening not know what that goal is if if you don't know what that goal is we have missed something that's right we we have we haven't paid attention as ministers we know what the goal is my brother and sister it's not to get a great big church it's not to be popular in fact I think the prophet of God basically said when our church gets too big and the mayor of the city starts to come we should get nervous that's right I don't think we'll have to worry about that hallelujah it's not to get to a great big church it's to get a holy ghost experience amen amen get a personal knowledge of Jesus Christ now this is just something I'm studying so I I'm only going to throw this a little tidbit but my brother and sister if you have come you got saved you feel like you got the Holy Ghost but your life hasn't changed in the last 10 years you don't really know God that's right exactly right it's an Ever growing ever expanding experience it is not I met him and all is well no that's right it's an experience that is growing amen yes sir Hallelujah so we're looking for that Holy Ghost experience uh between us and God not us preacher and God pastor and God church and God but us and God Amen so what do we do we set our eyes on that goal and no matter what happens keep your eyes on the goal that's it that's it it don't matter my brother and sister what's happening around us amen hallelujah praise the Lord right you know it's a shame I'll just throw this out it's a shame that in America the best we have to offer for the President and Vice President is two crazy people yeah it's a real shame that's right but you see their craziness and all of Congress and Senate and whatever's craziness behind that has got nothing to do with this bride and where she's going so you see all of that becomes just the distraction where we get all caught up what's going to happen what's going to happen what's going to happen my brother and sister what's going to happen is this bride's going to keep pressing to the goal and she's going to keep her eyes on this goal and while the world is falling apart wait somebody preached about that world falling apart hallelujah what happened they're fall fall in apart we're focused right amen we're remembering what the word was we're remembering it's not about brother brandham as in the reference point being brother brandham brother brandham was the voice that God used to come and speak to tell you and I to stay focused on the goal Hallelujah so we're not as it were rallying around a certain sign but the prophet of God so clearly and such a nice little analogy isn't it just just such a nice little analogy we can use almost any City can't we we're almost there look it's Chicago let's stop on the road let's all get out and run around the sign yeah right run around the sign are you with me you can run around the sign but you haven't made it to the destination no you you got to keep your eyes on that goal and keep going cuz it won't matter how many times you run around that sign you won't be in Chicago that's right yes sir that's right Hallelujah I hope I said that polite enough amen see no matter what happens keep your eyes on the goal you see the prophet of God just read it tonight but I'm trying to keep this concise tonight sunny skies are not a sign of God's approval that's right cloudy guys are not a sign of God's disfavor that's right amen they are not the sign no sir that's right the sign is the manifestation of the word in other words God interprets his own word and when he said you know what my sign's going to be that the spirit amen the spirit's here the spirit's always been here but the bride now has to come into her rightful position and mate up with the spirit to be able to say come amen so this bride's got to be positionally placed in the right season under the right sign under the right word to be able to say come amen hallelujah amen oh thank you Lord amen thank you Lord I believe the sign is here amen amen I believe that bride is there she's calling out amen now I want to just add this in here just as a good example God keeps his word a very beautiful title to a sermon some time ago brother Dr ER Baxter was formerly my campaign manager he was telling me of an experience that he had and the boys had up in British Columbia they were all Champion Riders on bicycles Ernie said brother brandom I could get on my bicycle and go downtown get an armload of groceries come back never even touch the handlebars turned the corners going around the street cars automobiles never touch the handlebars he said certainly I was sure I could win that contest and said there was other writers there equally as good as I or better and the contest was to ride 200 yards on a 14-in plank and not fall off and the plank was about 3T High get on this plank and ride H don't sound like too big of a deal does it well he said when I got up on there knowing that I was a genius yeah we've all met him he said I was sure I could ride that and ever who wrode it a new swin bicycle he said I got up on there and I didn't ride 25 ft till I fell off and another one got on and he did the same just as simple a little analogy about a a bicycle in a contest isn't this such a cute story he said we had a little old boy my goodness I didn't know he was allowed to use language like that had a little old boy around there and he wasn't very much of a rider and we were sure he wouldn't even get started but said somehow when this little lad got on there and they pushed him off down the plank he rode straight to the end went off just as perfect as anyone could ride that's amazing isn't it sometimes it's not the ones we expect brother Brenham said when you get there that's right you'll be surprised who is there that's right oh let's not get the most vocal or the best of this or the best of that it might be just that little boy as it were after he had won the bicycle we all got around him and asked him how did he do it and he said I'll tell you fellas the reason you lost the race you were looking down like this trying to keep your bicycle on the board I didn't care what's going on down here that's right huh you see the big picture I don't care what's going on down here amen I was looking at the end so I held steady amen oh if that isn't a lesson to the church don't look what's going on here watch the end and keep steady stay with God's word God keeps his word amen hallelujah my goodness Saints you can look right up here just as close as boyy Idaho now you know they they commissioned the phone company to set up two toll-free numbers that supposedly won't track uh who's calling and if your neighbor doesn't conform to our mandate which is not law it was just us saying you're going to do this call us and we'll send the police you see where this is heading training of a people and there was Daniel I hope you're with me I don't need to tell the whole story in every detail do I he had a choice you pray to your God and the decree made a declaration Daniel had a choice open the shutters or close the shutters and what happened the Mayor's tollfree Hotline that Daniel guy is doing it again Daniel it's been reported that you were praying and you can't pray to anything but the king and his stuff look where we're headed Saints you say oh brother Paul that's not it no it's the foundation of it it's the spirit working its way in where we as a nation on a religious foundation will have no problem turning in another Christian right they're not following the rules you know they just gave a a pastor of a church back East they just gave him a I think $155,000 fine because someone in his church or was visiting the church saw someone fist bump someone else in the church and that was against the Mandate of no physical contact right $155,000 fine see where we're headed might not be very long before they come and tell you people that insist on hugging and shaking hands at Grace Tabernacle that you're in trouble I'm kind of getting scared Saints I think we should shut the video off I think we should tape black paper over the windows not let any visitors in any longer make all of you sign a an agreement that you won't tell anybody what happens inside our church now when you see these signs look up look up your Redemption draw nigh amen look up the boy says you guys were all looking down you weren't looking to the end you weren't focused on the end you were all looking down oh my goodness we've got we've got a crazy president or a scile one and a crazy one and we've got this and we've got crazy people in our government here and we've got all these new rules that aren't really rules CU they didn't pass them correctly but what are we going to oh what are we going to do look up look to the end stay focused finish the race keep steady here he says it right here very well oh if that isn't a lesson to the church don't look what's going on here watch the end and keep steady stay with God's word God keeps his word amen hallelujah hallelujah amen you know Saints Grace those watching you want to see a supernatural event just ask the Lord to open your eyes tonight gesi was there all he saw was the me all he saw was the dire circumstance but God was gracious enough to open his eyes and see that greater is he that is in you amen than he that is in this world that's right that's what it comes down to that's it we need to just say Lord open my eyes let me see the very end of this let me see who I am let me not get distracted let not things come in my life that would draw me away Lord let me just keep pedaling as I look to the the end that I can win the prize amen hallelujah oh look at that again as we go back to that verse God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen the fullness of the word for the ages has come to our day my brother and sister it's complete you know what this perfect little bride have you met her yes sir did you know that she is found in the most unexpected places yes sir right hey amen you don't have to go to a cathedral you might go to a grass Hut you might find a in a little stucco block building somewhere up in the mountains in the woods you might find her in the middle of the big city you might find her in the desert most unexpected places but she's there amen you see this re little Revelation 19 bride she's not much to look at you know that she's not going to be the one walks out and the whole world goes amen she's going to be the one yes sir that is actually according to the word despised but she's the one that the seed is in Hallelujah and it takes a seed my brother and sister whether you talk natural talk spiritual it's a seed seed that brings forth new life without this seed there there's no life I don't care what what they do there is no life without the seed amen and you know what she's doing this little Revelations 19 bride you know what she's doing nobody even Harley notices she's getting ready that's exact right she said every night that cute isn't it such a cute little story about that uh armor meaton and that little girl isn't such a just a cute story that brother Brown told us yeah no I'm sorry that was a Revelations 19 bride right there in that story amen why the whole rest of the world's having fun in a great big party she's over there getting ready sewing up as it were that spiritual gown that she is clothing herself what is that the word that's right she's bringing herself she's clothing herself in the word just she's not trying to break a record she's not having open houses she doesn't need to serve lemonade and cookies to get people to come visit her church sir no sir she's just sewing up that garment getting ready getting ready that's right oh thank you Lord amen oh Lord I want to be ready amen you see what happened is is um now I hope you catch this don't judge my statement too quick till you hear the whole one this Revel 19 bride is actually not thinking about getting married that sounds a stumper doesn't it she's not thinking about getting married she's already accepted her bridegroom amen it's not a thought of it might be or it could be she has already declared he is my husband that's right he is my bridegroom he received me I've received him amen so she's not just talking about someday oh there's going to be Rapture someday Saints be careful don't let it be empty words don't let it be lip service that we're going to go in a Rapture let it be something that comes from the depth of the heart I'm going in a Rapture I'm already he's coming back for me he promised you see that cute little story once again has a completely scriptural basis that is there that when he showed up in the wagon she didn't say now look I'm not ready to go today we can go tomorrow we can go in the morning no she was ready she was ready because she believed his word and she said I'm prepared I haven't made a big fan Fair everybody else is dancing and having a party she sat in there and swed her a garment oh are you with me tonight right hallelujah amen Philippians 3:13 I need to hurry here hallelujah brethren I count not myself to have apprehended do we fully understand that scripture he's telling us I don't view this that I have already done enough I don't view this as though I have already checked off everything that needs checked off I don't view this as though I've already obtained this in one sense you can say he already had though just the same as you and I can say we have already obtained it are you with me right I count not myself to apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind reaching forth into those things which are before amen you see that right there saying sorry to sound like an English teacher or something but that right there the context of that gives you the understanding that he is still actively involved and pursuing what it is that he's talking about apprehending right in other words he's not sitting on his Laurels I believe the message God sent a prophet we're done everything's fine no sir actively this bride amen is actively pursuing her position at the bride amen she's actively moving into that actively declaring that actively living that amen so she's not looking at what's behind whether those are disappointments or those are accomplishments she's not looking to what's behind amen I almost put in tonight a quote that's uh been I've used it a couple times Through The Years where brother brandham says you know we're not looking at what was done 50 years ago think about it think think about it we're not looking back 50 years Saints God's right here today and we are actively apprehending what is necessary for this bride to go to her rapturing marriage supper Amen to move forward into this position she's called to and the reason she does that is she knows she's called it's not doctrine of the church it's not doctrine of the message it's Revelation and she knows that when she declared that Revelation that I am the bride of Christ that she had to face her cousins who mocked her who do you think you are yeah that's right she had to push against that no doubt they did everything they could to hinder her but she just kept pressing into it amen because she was confident I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect amen H amen somebody's perfect amen be thus minded and if any and if in anything ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you see what are we doing going back to that lovely little story just keep your eyes on the End Amen don't worry about it my brother and sister don't worry about What doctrine is moving in the message that's right don't worry about what influences are moving in the message don't worry about what one church is doing over here and one church is doing over there keep your eyes on the goal amen be persuaded just as I shared with you the other on Sunday there's only two camps that's it persuaded and not persuaded Hallelujah don't be looking around you well we've got family here we got family there we've got this friends here we got friends over there don't look at that don't look at that keep your eyes on the end of that that little boy wouldn't have wi any farther than the rest of if he'd have been riding down there and saying daddy look what I'm doing mama look what I'm doing girlfriend look what I'm doing would have fell right off of there amen but the fact of the prize was not to impress the people around him but to obtain the prize which for him was that swin bicycle Hallelujah I'm going to jump down a little bit here oh well what's another minute he told the Pharisees said search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me they tell you who I am they should know it so ought they know it today it's not a big bunch of Racket or a fuss or a carryon or a lot of noise it's Jesus Christ manifested among his people right the scripture says so notice now that makes it true when God says so and we find now the only way that he can reveal is to come into you that's it amen that's it m not into the doors of the church not into a certain church or not into the pastor into you hallelujah thank you Lord yeah quite honestly I mean that just leaves a little side note I'm quite honestly can't even fathom why pastors would want to have their hand in every family and every individual's life and like puppets control them that's a lot of strings how would you keep them how would you keep them all straight use your toes you'd have to use your toes yeah then you'd have to probably have some helpers then you'd have to be tell them not enough too much right left see I don't understand that there's one leadership that we as a body of Believers need and that's the Holy Ghost that's right we don't need to become nobody's puppet we don't nobody sticking their nose in our life and saying don't do this and don't do that and you shouldn't this and you shouldn't that that's that's the Holy Ghost amen and when we get surrendered to God and we finally get fully persuaded when we are absolutely convinced of who we are all the garbage just slowly gets washed away and Falls away it's when we're not persuaded that the junk happens amen and it's just that simple my brother and sister when we're not persuaded is when the devil shows up with a credit card application the devil shows up with all kinds of Cheetos and Pepsi and all the problems start happening in life but when we get persuaded we're able to look at that and say sorry that's not good for me I'm not going to do it amen amen that's why you know I'm a firm believer I'm getting sidetracked sorry but I'm a firm believer that we don't have to preach Morality In the church the Holy Ghost does that for us amen all we got to do is get the Holy Ghost in the church and then we don't have to go around trying to put out all these little fires and all these little troubles and and and Johnny run off with Susie and and they're doing this and that's doing that and our teenagers are behaving like a devil and oh what are we going to do now no let's get God in the church keep him in the church so keep the church on fire God will take care of the rest I expected you guys to lift the roof off Hallelujah is coming to you he is he can and he is the word and the word in you then the Holy Spirit reveals Christ through the word after he after after did we see that big word after he gets in you that's well we can talk about it can be part of our our uh what do they call that when you have that deal you repeat to get into church um um churches you know do that like you're going to join our church you have to say the Apostles Creed couldn't think of that you know you repeat this and you're saved no no no no it's after he Christ the the word gets in you amen he is in you you must take his word see well my church don't believe that all right you'll never get in see when you refuse the word you're refusing him hallelujah we're right down to the end here I'll leave off this last quote it's just a too good to leave off but what's another five minutes amen for thou art my lamp oh Lord and the Lord will lighten my darkness you know we could just stop right there and make a whole sermon right out of that amen I don't have to worry about the darkness of Leo to see I've got a lamp amen for by Thee I have run through a troop and by my God have I leaped over a wall as for God his way is perfect and the word of the Lord is tried sir so we don't have to question it it's already been proven he is a buckler to all that trust in him for who is God save the Lord who is a rock Save Our God Amen God is my strength and power and he maketh my way amen perfect amen right isn't that reassuring that we can read this scripture make that declaration but brother Paul my way is not perfect he says it is he says it is let's just believe the Lord he says our way is it's going to be perfect Hallelujah that's it Hallelujah had a couple side notes on that but I believe you have the point things that are to be is't this beautiful it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection that's it it's not a ghetto it's not something run down it's not a failure not a failed social experiment perfect Place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there that's right now if God made a place for you does does he have a place for you yes sir Hallelujah I believe with all my heart we got a place a little name card he might say as it would be in our our normal world that says right here is where you're going to be seated that's right not by chance not an accident right God knows be therefore perfect even as your Father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married oh so he's come that's right that's right now I want you to catch this I want to just throw this off to you just real quick the prophet of God very carefully showed us that the marriage between be good for our young people to understand this maybe we need to teach this in our young people's the marriage between a young man and a young woman doesn't come in the white dress and the tuxedo and kissing the bride before the people the prophet of God clearly shows us that the marriage is in the giving and The Taking of The Vow amen so when a young man young woman might be sitting you know on the Park Bench looking out over the lake and the Moon is shining on it and they feel all warm and cozy and he would turn to to her and say would you marry me and she says yes the only thing that can undo that is the girl's father saying no otherwise that vow is binding now I want to sound crass but they give a kiss and a hug and life goes on and they marry somebody else they broke that vow that's right that's why this whole cording and stuff is not a game it's not just something we just flop around I got a boyfriend I got a girlfriend I go here I there I do this I do that it's okay I'll find the right guy some no no it's serious business and I want you to tie this right back right here to see this see as we're coming down because you have to stand and be married to the perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride amen take that natural take that spiritual right we're not wanting somebody that's all kissed on and all whatever and hugged on and whatever see God doesn't want a church a bride that's all kissed on and she's over here today and over there tomorrow God wants that Perfect Bride amen so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen she was trapped into it see God never held it to her account oh to stand and be able to say Lord forgive me my shortcomings forgive me Lord of my weakness and my failures and forgive me and he says I've already washed that my perfect blood has washed that into the sea of forgetfulness and I want you to be able to stand and with joy and thanks giving and confidence and say I am a perfect son daughter of God Amen I'll stand on the word I'll be faithful Lord I do it not because I'm afraid but because I love you amen hallelujah sister Emmy would you come hallelujah amen oh the word in you Hallelujah that's it when he gets in you amen you must take his word amen amen you can't say I've got the Holy Ghost and argue with the word amen and you can't doubt the word and say you trust God right because he is his word hallelujah let's just stand here this evening amen I tell you what I like that 2 Samuel 22 that we already read God is my strength and power he maketh my way perfect hallelujah thank you Lord amen thank you Lord you know let's sing Psalms 19 you know sometimes when you study something there's just songs come to you you might find yourself singing something and I've kind of learned over time you know just to write those down there's just something about that a little little something special about that and so let's just uh sing that if we would this evening Hallelujah Brother Jay if you'd help me I actually love this song it just moves my heart whenever I sing it I think about [Music] it is perfect oh Lord you are perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is true making wise a simple or to be all in Gold sweeter also than honey and the Honey C but the statutes of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure in lightning the eyes more to be Des gold find gold sweeter also than Hy and the honey the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous all together and in the keeping of them there's great reward there's great reward in the keeping of them there is great reward can we say Amen to that Hallelujah you know as we're pressing to Perfection we're actually pressing into our rightful position amen right it's not something that's set high and Beyond us you see it's already our position amen hallelujah I just like to close I think I'll just kind of shorten this and might be a little shift but you know this is the scripture we read tonight and I think we we ought to just remind oursel we're going to run through that troop and we're going to leap over that wall hallelujah it's nothing going to stop us amen I declare it Hallelujah might see me you know just run and you know I tried that stuff in school you know they said well Paul you you run pretty good why don't you go out for track and I found my little niche in there and the coach was like you know going to do you know this and then he changes his mind and he says you know Paul I want you to try the hurdles about 10 minutes later he says I I want you to just go back and do what you was doing before because you see if you run and you hook your toe on that thing you either fall down or you knock it down amen so when you think about that in the human element not everyone is qualified to run through a troop and leap over a wall but God has called you amen you might not be a hurdler in this world in their view but I tell you what when it comes from running through the troop and leaping over the wall God's made you able hallelujah hallelujah unfortunately I never made the track team oh well praise the Lord but there's a track team as it were that I am making I was called for it I'm qualified well Hallelujah I can run through a truth and leap over a wall Hallelujah hallelu he's my rock and my shield he gives power to oh hallelujah hallelujah oh now I'm free from condemnation Jesus is a rock of my salvation I can run through a TR and leap over a wall Hallelujah yes Hallelujah well I can run through a grou and leap over oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah he's my rock and my shield he gives power to all hallelujah oh Hallelujah well now I'm free from condemnation Jesus is the rock of my salvation I can run through a true and leap over hallelujah hallelujah let's give a little praise to the Lord tonight oh hallelujah amen you notice there's no words in there that says I'll try amen it's words that says I can amen oh Hallelujah who can tonight amen amen we are going to run through the troop and we're going to leap over the wall Hallelujah nothing going to stop us and I just say thank you Lord Jesus tonight Lord I pray these words would stir the hearts of your children just to remember father we're pressing into our Prof our our profession we're pro oh Hallelujah Lord we're pressing into our position amen of perfection amen oh Lord that's what you called us to Lord you've told us to press to the mark of the High Calling and that is perfection in you Lord thank you thank you Lord It's all I can say tonight thank you Lord Your Grace your mercy your kindness to us Lord father it's almost hard to comprehend that

Line keep our eyes on the prize that has been set before us we say you thank you tonight Lord and we close this service father with an amen from the depths of our heart so be it Lord Thy word has
