[29:48] and i'll begin with verse 3.
[29:53] god's speaking to job out of a whirlwind
[29:56] and he says in verse 3 gird up now thy
[29:59] loins like a man
[30:03] for i will demand of thee
[30:06] and answer thou me
[30:08] where wast thou
[30:10] when i laid the foundations of the earth
[30:13] declare if thou hast understanding
[30:17] who hath laid the measures thereof if
[30:20] thou knowest or who hath stretched the
[30:22] line upon it
[30:24] where upon are the foundations there of
[30:27] fastened or who
[30:29] laid the cornerstone thereof
[30:32] when the morning stars sang together
[30:35] and all the sons of god you notice all
[30:38] the sons of god shouted
[30:41] for joy
[30:43] amen
[30:44] i want to read you can be seated i'll
[30:47] just
[30:48] open up with that but i want you to turn
[30:50] to first john
[30:55] and i want to go to the fifth or fourth
[30:58] chapter of first john
[31:14] now we took that title our subject out
[31:16] of that
[31:18] 38th chapter of verse 4 of job it said
[31:22] where was thou
[31:24] that's the question with all of you
[31:25] tonight
[31:27] or other words where were you when he
[31:29] laid the foundations of the earth
[31:32] where were you
[31:34] you'll get the revelation of where you
[31:35] are it's going to show you where you
[31:36] come from
[31:38] who you are
[31:39] and where you're going
[31:42] that's right
[31:44] would you like to know that
[31:47] that ought to settle it forever
[31:49] if you know where you come from
[31:53] amen then you know who you are
[31:55] and if you know who you are
[31:57] you know where you're
[31:58] going you can't miss it
[32:01] there's no way to miss it because i'm
[32:03] going to tell you right now that
[32:04] revelation is god's achievement it's
[32:06] nothing you've done or could do it's
[32:08] god's achievement
[32:10] so in first john 4 let's start with
[32:13] verse 4 ye are of god little children
[32:17] wow
[32:19] you are of god
[32:21] you know that's an eternal he's eternal
[32:24] there's only one form of eternal life
[32:25] and that's
[32:26] god and you are of god
[32:30] now how are you going to fail
[32:34] you say i fail every day but yeah
[32:36] there's a part of you does fail but
[32:37] there's a part that god doesn't see the
[32:39] failure the other part can't
[32:43] the eternal part of you can't fail
[32:47] the inside of the inside man the third
[32:49] man can't fail
[32:51] i say it like that because brother
[32:53] branham said that inside man
[32:56] amen are you with me he said you said in
[32:58] one place the third man
[33:01] amen
[33:02] all right
[33:03] so he said here
[33:04] you are of god little children now see
[33:08] see there's the word right there
[33:10] everybody can read it but can they hear
[33:12] it
[33:13] everybody can read that same word
[33:16] and hear it with the ears the voice of
[33:18] god the word is the voice but can you
[33:20] receive it can you hear it
[33:23] there's only one group of people one
[33:25] group in this earth today that can hear
[33:28] that word
[33:29] and hear this scripture
[33:31] and that's the bride amen
[33:34] amen
[33:35] you are of god little children and have
[33:37] overcome them who are them antichrist
[33:42] antichrist spirit
[33:43] you have overcome them because greater
[33:46] is he
[33:47] that is in you
[33:50] than he
[33:51] that is in the world
[33:54] i want to jump down here to verse 7. you
[33:56] can read the whole chapter later but i
[33:58] just want to get to these points here as
[34:00] i said this is just the beginning
[34:04] verse 7 but i'm going to lay this out as
[34:06] the foundation of what we're going to
[34:07] speak on here
[34:10] not only tonight beloved let us love one
[34:14] another
[34:15] for love is of
[34:18] god
[34:20] and everyone that loveth is born
[34:23] of god
[34:25] and knoweth god
[34:27] this love we're speaking of tonight is
[34:29] not filial
[34:31] it's divine
[34:32] and we're going to find out as we go on
[34:34] further here
[34:35] for love is of god it said verse 8 he
[34:38] that loveth
[34:40] not
[34:42] see he that loveth is born of god
[34:45] amen
[34:46] born of god so if you're born of god you
[34:50] are of god
[34:52] he begat you
[34:54] you had to be in him for him to begat
[34:56] you
[34:57] amen because you're his son
[35:00] what makes you a son that's seed land
[35:03] there that's been quickened that becomes
[35:04] flesh
[35:06] amen
[35:08] that's son
[35:09] that's god the son that's you
[35:13] yourself
[35:14] that's god in you that's of god
[35:18] are you with me
[35:19] all right now so we say
[35:22] see so we come down the eighth verse he
[35:24] that loveth not
[35:26] knoweth not god
[35:28] for god is
[35:30] love
[35:32] for god is love
[35:36] in this was manifested the love of god
[35:39] toward us in this
[35:41] in this was manifested the love of god
[35:44] toward us
[35:46] because that god sent his only begotten
[35:49] son
[35:50] into the world that we might live
[35:53] through
[35:54] him
[35:55] now who was he
[35:57] he was god himself
[36:00] in some form
[36:02] do you believe that
[36:04] he was god the son
[36:05] amen
[36:07] are you with me
[36:08] all right
[36:09] that was himself that was the fullness
[36:11] of the godhead bodily in one man
[36:14] that's our redeemer that's our savior
[36:16] that was god himself
[36:18] that was the blood of god that was shed
[36:19] there for you
[36:21] all right
[36:22] then he would be everything god was
[36:24] wouldn't he so let's read that again in
[36:26] this was manifest the love of god toward
[36:28] us because that god sent his only
[36:30] begotten son into the world this love
[36:32] was begotten toward us that we might
[36:34] live through him
[36:36] herein herein
[36:39] is love
[36:40] not that we loved god but that he loved
[36:43] us
[36:44] and sent his son to be the propitiation
[36:48] for our sins
[36:50] what's he redeeming here what's he
[36:52] what's he dying for himself
[36:55] his sons
[36:58] his offspring
[37:00] his bride
[37:01] amen all right
[37:05] beloved or excuse me let's go let's go
[37:07] over here to verse
[37:11] 13.
[37:14] hereby know we
[37:16] that we dwell in him
[37:18] and he and us
[37:20] because
[37:21] he hath given us of
[37:23] his spirit
[37:26] there you are how do you what do you how
[37:28] are you going to know that you're in him
[37:30] and he's in you he's placed to giving
[37:31] you the token
[37:34] the token is your assurance that the
[37:35] price has been paid for you
[37:38] you have the token
[37:40] now what's going to keep you out of it
[37:41] what's going to keep you out of
[37:42] everything they purchase for you
[37:44] what's going to keep you from claiming
[37:45] it what's going to keep you from having
[37:47] it
[37:48] nothing apply the token
[37:50] to place the token with your prayer
[37:53] satan has to move why because it's his
[37:56] life
[37:57] it's his
[37:59] love
[38:00] and keep this in mind through these this
[38:02] series that love
[38:05] never
[38:06] faileth
[38:09] we're talking about god's own love we're
[38:11] talking about agape love
[38:13] not filial
[38:15] but agape love
[38:17] amen the capstone love
[38:21] all right
[38:23] now in verse
[38:26] 16
[38:28] and we have known and believed the love
[38:31] that god hath given to us
[38:34] and we have known and believed the love
[38:37] that god hath given to who
[38:41] well he's love
[38:43] what have we received
[38:46] himself
[38:48] then the love that god has given to us
[38:52] when he gave us his spirit he's given us
[38:54] his love
[38:57] all right
[38:58] then god has given to us
[39:02] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[39:08] not dwelleth with love but dwelleth in
[39:10] love
[39:12] dwelleth in god
[39:15] hallelujah what a place of safety
[39:18] you think any plague is going to come
[39:19] now you're dwelling
[39:22] you see the bible said no plague can
[39:24] come now you're dwelling your dwelling
[39:26] is christ
[39:29] this house is his dwelling but your
[39:31] dwelling
[39:32] is christ
[39:35] amen you may have all kinds ups and
[39:37] downs and and failures and struggles and
[39:39] trials in this but that word in you can
[39:42] never move
[39:44] it can't be moved
[39:47] you believe that the word cannot be
[39:49] moved
[39:51] you're planted like a tree beside the
[39:53] waters
[39:54] shall not be moved
[39:58] what is that tree who is that tree it's
[40:00] the bride tree what is the bride tree
[40:02] the tree of life
[40:04] in bright form
[40:07] all right i don't want to get too far
[40:09] going on these things because i would be
[40:10] i just have one page of notes but i got
[40:12] some things i want to share with you
[40:14] brother branham said here further it'll
[40:16] be a little bit of reading tonight so
[40:17] just bear with me
[40:19] but verse 16.
[40:23] okay i dwelleth and growleth god is love
[40:25] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[40:27] god and god in him
[40:30] herein is our love made
[40:32] perfect here it is our love made
[40:35] mature
[40:37] that we may have boldness in the day of
[40:40] judgment
[40:42] because as he is
[40:44] because as he is
[40:47] because as he is so are we
[40:52] in this world
[40:53] so are we
[40:55] amen there is no fear in love but
[40:58] perfect love matured love
[41:00] complete perfect
[41:02] matured love
[41:04] casteth out fear
[41:06] because fear because fear hath torment
[41:09] he that feareth
[41:11] see perfect love there's only one
[41:12] perfect love and no you cannot enter
[41:15] that dimension
[41:18] amen of where he saw those saints
[41:21] caught up in their theophany amen
[41:24] without perfect love because nothing was
[41:26] there but perfect love
[41:28] so you see what we're doing by feeding
[41:30] on the word for the hour don't you and
[41:32] taking and reading your bible without
[41:34] the message you would know what's in
[41:35] this bible
[41:37] for the hour you wouldn't be able to
[41:38] receive it
[41:40] that's the truth
[41:43] or he would have never had to send a
[41:44] prophet with the interpretation of what
[41:46] god was saying for this season and show
[41:49] it in the word
[41:52] amen
[41:53] so thank god for a prophet
[41:55] a vindicated prophet
[41:58] amen and he that will not believe that
[42:01] prophet
[42:02] doesn't have the love of god in his
[42:03] heart
[42:07] that's right that's exactly right
[42:10] amen because he had the word he was the
[42:13] word he was the word for our day he
[42:15] didn't deviate from this word that's
[42:16] what identified him
[42:19] amen
[42:20] and if you can't believe this neither
[42:22] will you believe the prophet's words
[42:27] and if you can't believe the prophet's
[42:28] word you won't accept this either
[42:32] amen that's right we're not talking
[42:34] about just a man we're talking about the
[42:36] word
[42:37] that's come in our day the son of man
[42:39] revealing himself through a son of man
[42:44] okay
[42:46] so who are we believing the son of man
[42:50] and what are we manifesting the son of
[42:52] man that's what we're here on earth to
[42:54] manifest
[42:55] that's what we're here on earth to
[42:56] fulfill himself
[42:59] in bride form
[43:01] that's the end time message
[43:03] that's the message of his coming
[43:06] amen because without that you won't meet
[43:08] him
[43:09] you've got to have this spiritual union
[43:11] you must have it in faith before you
[43:13] have it
[43:14] in reality full reality
[43:16] you've got to meet him now or you'll
[43:17] never meet him there
[43:19] you've got to be married now you'll
[43:21] never be married there
[43:24] you see what i'm saying versus spiritual
[43:26] the revelation of the word always takes
[43:29] revelation
[43:31] it takes faith
[43:32] you must know him by that means
[43:35] you must have your healing by that means
[43:36] all of that works by faith all we do is
[43:39] by faith as believers
[43:43] amen
[43:44] all right
[43:45] so
[43:48] so we see here he said he that feareth
[43:51] is not made perfect in love we love him
[43:55] because
[43:56] he first loved us
[44:00] amen
[44:03] the prophet says here i'll just pass
[44:05] this note to you there's two different
[44:06] kinds of love kind of mentioned that
[44:09] already but one of them is the greek
[44:10] word filio
[44:12] filio means friendship
[44:15] also means a human love or friendship
[44:19] love
[44:20] the kind you have for your wife
[44:22] love that kind of love
[44:24] that kind of love is not a true love
[44:30] amen but if you're married to your wife
[44:33] and she gets a little upset with you or
[44:36] you get upset with her or she gets upset
[44:38] with you
[44:39] love will cover it
[44:42] that's not human
[44:44] there's another love there if your love
[44:45] is based on the on the union because god
[44:49] revealed to you this is my eternal mate
[44:52] she's mine and i'm her hers
[44:55] is are you with me
[44:57] then that's going to hold you
[44:59] that's going to be a love that covers
[45:01] over that other love
[45:03] that love won't that feeling won't hold
[45:05] out it's got condition
[45:07] that's right it'll you know like brother
[45:10] branham went on to say he said and i
[45:12] know you little teenagers want to
[45:13] believe that filio is a true love but
[45:16] that's wrong
[45:18] that kind of love will make you jealous
[45:20] of your wife you'll take a pistol and
[45:22] blow a man's brains out because of her
[45:24] well i don't think a christian would do
[45:26] that
[45:27] but
[45:29] you'd get pretty upset wouldn't
[45:30] you irritated if somebody come along and
[45:33] did that to my wife but what would agape
[45:35] love do
[45:37] it would what would that do it'll get
[45:38] down and pray for that man's lost soul
[45:41] because that felio ain't real love
[45:45] amen
[45:46] amen all right but agape love will get
[45:49] you down and pray for that man's soul
[45:51] forgive him
[45:53] speak to him see
[45:55] see it says says that's agape love
[45:58] that's the kind of love the church needs
[46:00] what we all need is that kind of love
[46:03] god give me that love
[46:06] all right
[46:09] ephesians chapter one
[46:12] now if we don't do any more than read
[46:13] the scriptures at all say amen and go
[46:15] home
[46:17] this evening because that's worth every
[46:19] bit of it
[46:21] i'm not i can't explain you can't
[46:23] explain revelation
[46:25] but we speak it and we're expecting god
[46:28] to reveal it and he'll do so through his
[46:31] word
[46:33] god operates and lives in and dwells in
[46:35] his word he's obligated to his word
[46:39] amen
[46:40] all right so
[46:41] ephesians chapter one
[46:47] verse four very familiar scriptures but
[46:49] we can read scriptures over and over
[46:50] again and get something more new every
[46:52] time and quicken to you we can take a
[46:54] message oh well i've heard that message
[46:56] before i've read that message i don't
[46:57] need to read that again yes you do
[47:00] you need to keep feeding on that message
[47:02] because i'll tell you what it keeps
[47:04] opening amen
[47:05] why because the word of god is eternal
[47:10] amen that's right not the word of a man
[47:12] the word of god is eternal
[47:17] so according at verse 3 blessed be the
[47:20] god and father of our lord jesus christ
[47:22] who hath hath past tense
[47:25] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[47:28] all
[47:29] spiritual blessings in
[47:32] look at the positioning here
[47:35] in heavenly places in christ
[47:38] according as he hath chosen us
[47:41] half past tense you didn't choose him he
[47:43] chose you
[47:45] in
[47:46] him
[47:48] where'd he choose you in
[47:50] him before the foundation
[47:53] of the world that we should be holy and
[47:56] without blame before him in
[48:00] love
[48:04] having predestinated us predestinated us
[48:07] unto the adoption or positioning
[48:10] adoption is placing or positioning
[48:15] of that son of children by jesus christ
[48:18] to himself according to the good
[48:21] pleasure of
[48:23] his will
[48:25] not your will
[48:26] his will not human will his will
[48:30] all right
[48:40] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[48:43] wherein he hath made us accepted
[48:46] he hath made us accepted
[48:49] in the beloved
[48:52] verse 9
[48:53] having made known unto us
[48:55] us
[48:57] the mystery of his will
[49:01] amen are you with me
[49:05] he he he he adopted us as children
[49:08] according good pleasure of his will
[49:09] having made known to us the mystery of
[49:12] his will
[49:13] according that's what the message of the
[49:15] hour has done
[49:17] is made us prepared and ready for a body
[49:19] change
[49:22] by unveiling his will
[49:25] to us individually personally
[49:28] all right then having made known unto us
[49:30] the mystery of his will according to his
[49:33] good pleasure
[49:34] which he hath purposed
[49:37] in himself
[49:38] all right now we're getting into
[49:40] something
[49:41] he has purposed this in himself
[49:45] you didn't purpose it
[49:47] amen he purposed it
[49:49] it's his achievement it's his doing
[49:53] he made the choice you remember the
[49:55] elect are elect according to
[49:58] foreknowledge
[50:00] are you with me
[50:02] elect according to foreknowledge that's
[50:05] that's his that's his doing
[50:08] you didn't make that choice he made that
[50:10] choice
[50:12] amen when he made the choice and you
[50:14] come up to have the choice you made it
[50:17] because you ordained to make that choice
[50:20] because he chose you
[50:22] but you had a choice
[50:25] are you with me
[50:27] but how are you going to go contrary to
[50:29] what you did in him to begin with
[50:32] then he would be defeated
[50:33] but he still gave you a choice
[50:37] amen
[50:38] he chose you
[50:40] that you might choose him
[50:45] that sounds like a riddle doesn't it
[50:48] but that's right
[50:49] okay now
[50:52] having made known a pleasure good
[50:54] purpose with yet purpose in himself that
[50:57] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[50:59] times we are in those times right now
[51:01] we're in that place he might gather
[51:03] together in one how's he going to do it
[51:07] by opening the seven seals
[51:10] because we're looking the opening of the
[51:12] seven seals was the notation or the
[51:15] realization that we're in the fullness
[51:18] of time we're in that dispensation
[51:21] we're at the end
[51:23] all right we've arrived he said we've
[51:25] come we've come to that place
[51:28] when that moment is i don't know but
[51:29] we're in the end time right now we're in
[51:31] the end
[51:33] all right so there had to be a fullness
[51:35] of jesus christ revealed and that had to
[51:37] come through the opening of seven seals
[51:39] you'd have no fullness of the word
[51:44] so it's very important that we eat the
[51:46] open book
[51:48] because right in that open book is your
[51:50] identification
[51:51] because you are the open book
[51:56] you are the open book
[52:00] amen
[52:01] you are the reveal revelation of himself
[52:06] when he was here on earth in the
[52:08] fullness of god revealing god he
[52:10] revealed you
[52:14] is that right he was revealing you
[52:16] because you were in him and all that he
[52:18] was was being unfolded revealed
[52:21] and when he unveiled himself and
[52:22] revealed god revealed himself in some
[52:24] form that was you there
[52:31] so but my but my question is to you is
[52:34] where was thou before the when he laid
[52:36] the foundation of the earth
[52:38] because in the beginning
[52:41] was the word
[52:44] is that right
[52:45] in the beginning was the spoken word
[52:49] the spoken word is the original seed
[52:52] in the beginning was the word that's
[52:54] original
[52:57] in the beginning god the word created
[53:00] heavens and earth laid the foundations
[53:03] but where were you
[53:08] amen that's right where were you
[53:11] your attitude towards the word your
[53:13] attitude towards the word for this hour
[53:15] denotes where you were
[53:20] either you long for more of him or
[53:22] you're just coming to church because
[53:25] it's a duty
[53:27] and not a love affair
[53:31] amen are you with me
[53:34] why do we sit down and feed on the word
[53:35] because we love him why do you believe
[53:37] him because you love him
[53:41] amen
[53:42] outside of that
[53:44] where's real faith real faith is is
[53:46] working by love
[53:50] okay so so we come down here and he said
[53:54] let's continue on in the dispensation of
[53:57] the fullness of times he might gather
[53:58] together in one not in two not in three
[54:01] and one
[54:02] all things in christ both which are in
[54:05] heaven and which are on earth even in
[54:09] him
[54:13] all right in whom we have obtained an
[54:15] inheritance i see if i have that mark
[54:17] because i was moving okay verse 7
[54:20] verse 17.
[54:22] now let's see wait a minute now
[54:25] 9-10
[54:27] okay yeah just to verse 10 there
[54:34] yeah and then i want to go to chapter 3.
[54:37] verse 3
[54:44] how that by revelation now paul said you
[54:47] have heard of the dispensation of the
[54:49] grace of god which has given me to you
[54:51] word
[54:52] to you word is to you the individual
[54:56] how that by revelation he made known
[54:58] unto me the mystery
[55:01] by revelation
[55:03] that's god's way that's god's purpose by
[55:06] revelation abel offered to god his
[55:08] excellent sacrifice then his brother
[55:11] cain they were both religious they both
[55:14] believed god they both were making
[55:16] building a church they were both
[55:17] worshiping
[55:18] but god didn't accept all that he
[55:20] accepted revelation
[55:22] and that was because of the difference
[55:24] of the seed so the evidence of the seed
[55:27] is that they'll receive the word
[55:31] by revelation
[55:34] all right so he said here he said
[55:37] whereby
[55:38] and we come verse 3 how that by
[55:40] revelation he made known unto me the
[55:42] mystery
[55:44] and then verse 16.
[55:49] that he would grant to you
[55:52] i i bypassed a lot right there but let's
[55:54] just get over here to verse 16 that he
[55:57] would grant you according to the riches
[55:59] of his glory to be strengthened with
[56:01] might by his spirit
[56:03] in the inner man
[56:07] in the inner man
[56:09] verse 17 that christ may dwell in you by
[56:13] that christ may dwell now i'm trusting
[56:15] the lord will make this re start to
[56:17] reveal these things to you that christ
[56:20] may dwell in your hearts
[56:23] where where in your hearts
[56:26] you realize that in your heart you have
[56:27] another realm
[56:29] it's called the soul
[56:31] in that spirit realm there's another's
[56:33] third circle isn't there
[56:35] the heart
[56:37] is the spirit
[56:40] amen but in there
[56:42] is a soul
[56:45] amen
[56:48] all right that's the inner man he's
[56:50] speaking of here that christ may dwell
[56:52] in your hearts by faith that you may
[56:56] that you being rooted and grounded that
[56:59] ye being rooted rooted
[57:03] you just weren't put out you were rooted
[57:05] and grounded
[57:07] in love
[57:09] may be able to comprehend with all
[57:12] saints
[57:16] what is the breadth the length and the
[57:18] depth and height
[57:20] and to know the love of christ
[57:22] verse 19 and to know not imagine not
[57:26] something well i hope it's so but faith
[57:29] is the substance
[57:32] substance
[57:34] of things hoped for
[57:37] it's substance you say well i i hope i
[57:40] get what i'm hoping for
[57:42] i hope i get the word see
[57:44] let's promise me but i hope i get it no
[57:46] it's not hope you get it if it's
[57:48] revealed to you it's yours
[57:50] it's substance you have the substance of
[57:52] the thing hoped for you've already got
[57:54] it
[57:55] what are you waiting for the full the
[57:57] full revelation the full realization the
[57:59] full manifestation of what you have in
[58:01] faith
[58:02] must be manifested completely
[58:06] if i believed i was healed then i'd
[58:08] start rejoicing for my healing i'd start
[58:10] confessing that faith and my body would
[58:13] obey my confession
[58:16] it's got to be manifest why because
[58:18] faith has taken the word and faith is
[58:21] the channel that god manifests his word
[58:23] through
[58:26] amen
[58:28] all right
[58:30] so verse 19 again and to know the love
[58:33] of christ to know the love of christ
[58:35] which passeth knowledge
[58:37] that you might be filled with all the
[58:40] fullness of god
[58:42] as we said
[58:43] prophet said in the message things that
[58:45] are to be
[58:48] and that's paragraph 42 he said he said
[58:55] the fullness of the word come into
[58:57] existence by the opening of those seven
[58:59] seals
[59:01] that was promised to us in this age that
[59:04] we then can understand
[59:08] amen
[59:09] amen so see
[59:12] he laid everything else in order but
[59:14] there's something that had to be brought
[59:16] as a capstone message
[59:19] that would cap the whole thing
[59:21] amen and that had to be
[59:23] god himself
[59:25] unveiling himself
[59:27] and who is he love
[59:30] right
[59:34] all right now i'd like you to go with me
[59:36] to hebrews 10. that's a lot of reading i
[59:38] realize
[59:39] but i'm laying all this down
[59:42] in part one
[59:44] in verse 10 we may come back to it
[59:46] probably will in different times but
[59:47] hebrews
[59:49] chapter 10
[59:53] verse 5.
[59:55] remember my subject herein
[59:58] is love or my title excuse me
[1:00:02] my subject says where was thou
[1:00:05] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[1:00:07] he saith sacrifice and offering thou
[1:00:10] woodest not but a body hast thou
[1:00:13] prepared me
[1:00:16] amen
[1:00:18] now in the church age book i have some
[1:00:20] things i want to share with you here in
[1:00:22] different places and it won't be long
[1:00:25] in the church age book
[1:00:30] and if you want to follow along it's in
[1:00:32] the older book it's in the blue book
[1:00:36] and that's on page 354 i'm reading from
[1:00:38] and we'll probably come back to this
[1:00:40] other times
[1:00:43] but the scripture says in revelation 3
[1:00:46] 19
[1:00:47] and i'll read you don't turn to it as
[1:00:49] many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[1:00:53] be zealous thereof and repent
[1:00:56] brother branham comes down he says let's
[1:00:58] examine the first phrase as many as i
[1:01:02] love
[1:01:06] in the greek
[1:01:07] the emphasis is is upon the personal
[1:01:10] pronoun
[1:01:11] i
[1:01:15] he does not say as many
[1:01:18] would feel that he should say he does
[1:01:20] not say what many feel he should say
[1:01:23] as many as love me
[1:01:27] no sir
[1:01:29] no sir
[1:01:32] and he says
[1:01:34] i said no sir we must never try to make
[1:01:37] jesus now listen to this carefully we
[1:01:39] must never try to make jesus the object
[1:01:42] of human love
[1:01:45] we must never make jesus the object of
[1:01:48] human love
[1:01:52] what is human love
[1:01:54] it is an agape love
[1:01:56] it's filial
[1:01:59] all right you must never make jesus the
[1:02:01] object of human love
[1:02:05] that a lot of people go around say i
[1:02:06] love jesus i love jesus but i won't
[1:02:08] accept his word
[1:02:10] well i love jesus but i can't accept the
[1:02:12] message of a prophet well i love jesus
[1:02:14] but
[1:02:16] i go to church i'm good enough
[1:02:18] and it's a loose term i love him i love
[1:02:20] him i love him not questioning the love
[1:02:23] it's a true statement but
[1:02:27] unless you have god in you
[1:02:29] how do you how can you say you love him
[1:02:31] unless she first loved you
[1:02:33] and if he first loved you where were you
[1:02:35] when he laid the foundations of the
[1:02:37] earth
[1:02:41] amen you see we wouldn't have all this
[1:02:43] open i thank god again for a message of
[1:02:45] the hour that's opened these mysteries
[1:02:47] have been sealed in this word
[1:02:49] never would we have come to that
[1:02:51] knowledge or knowledge being revelation
[1:02:54] true understanding of what god had hid
[1:02:56] here for us that was laying in us ready
[1:02:58] to be opened
[1:03:02] where were we where what are we we're
[1:03:04] part of this word
[1:03:08] that's why when the eagle heard the
[1:03:09] scream something screamed inside of him
[1:03:11] that's what i've been listening for
[1:03:13] hear the voice
[1:03:14] but being an eagle he was able to
[1:03:16] receive the voice of an eagle
[1:03:20] because he knew the voice
[1:03:22] why did he know the voice because before
[1:03:24] he became an eagle in a barnyard he was
[1:03:26] an eagle in another eagle
[1:03:30] are you with me amen
[1:03:32] all right then how's he going to turn
[1:03:34] down his father's voice when he always
[1:03:36] was a part of his father and his
[1:03:37] father-in-law wanted fellowship with him
[1:03:40] or his mother
[1:03:42] looking for him
[1:03:46] and when he heard that scream something
[1:03:48] inside of him responded to that
[1:03:51] and when he heard it he looked up he
[1:03:52] didn't look down he looked up he was
[1:03:54] taught to look down but he looked up
[1:03:57] he was taught to look at his failures
[1:03:59] and his faults and his mistakes and his
[1:04:01] failures instead he looked up
[1:04:04] beyond that
[1:04:05] and said there's what i want to begin
[1:04:07] with begin to dawn on
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:14] the sun is up begins to dawn on you
[1:04:17] it is the rising of the sun
[1:04:22] amen amen thy light has come
[1:04:26] bride thy light thy
[1:04:29] light is come
[1:04:32] amen there's darkness in the world
[1:04:33] there's gross darkness upon the people
[1:04:35] you can see it is
[1:04:37] they're going insane they're going to
[1:04:38] they're fanatical they're in every way
[1:04:40] they're they don't know what to do they
[1:04:42] don't know whether i seen a guy i said
[1:04:44] it was a guy that was a guy or a girl
[1:04:46] sitting in a car
[1:04:48] he had a ponytail shaved all over but he
[1:04:50] had enough hair to have a ponytail up
[1:04:51] here this way and the ponytail back here
[1:04:54] this way
[1:04:56] i said he doesn't know who he is you
[1:04:59] know what it is
[1:05:00] a terrible
[1:05:03] case of
[1:05:04] amnesia
[1:05:07] they don't know how to identify
[1:05:09] themselves they don't know whether
[1:05:10] they're man or woman
[1:05:12] they don't even they can't even begin to
[1:05:14] identify who they are
[1:05:19] it's
[1:05:20] amnesia and it's really unless unless
[1:05:23] it's predestinated seed it's incurable
[1:05:28] but to the bride
[1:05:32] thank god he brought us back to where we
[1:05:34] were in the beginning
[1:05:37] amen where we were in the beginning
[1:05:40] that's a great revelation where were you
[1:05:42] when i laid the foundations up there
[1:05:44] where was you
[1:05:48] i've got to hurry i didn't think i'd
[1:05:51] have to hurry
[1:05:52] anyway
[1:05:55] okay so
[1:05:57] he said
[1:05:58] you can't make jesus the object of human
[1:06:00] love
[1:06:02] in this verse no it's not the object of
[1:06:05] human love but he said i love
[1:06:07] he said no it is the many that are the
[1:06:10] loved ones of god
[1:06:12] it is his love in question not ours
[1:06:17] praise the lord it's his love and
[1:06:19] question not ours
[1:06:23] amen so once again we find ourselves
[1:06:26] glorying in his salvation his purpose
[1:06:30] and his plan we are confirmed even more
[1:06:34] strongly in the truth of the doctrine of
[1:06:36] sovereignty of god even as it said in
[1:06:38] romans 9 13 jacob i loved
[1:06:41] see
[1:06:42] does it now not does it now obtain that
[1:06:45] since he loved only the many he is
[1:06:47] therefore a state of complacency
[1:06:49] awaiting the love of those who have not
[1:06:50] drawn nigh to him by no means is this so
[1:06:53] for he declared also in romans 9 13 esau
[1:06:57] have i hated so he made a
[1:06:58] differentiation there he said jacob i
[1:07:01] loved he saw i hate
[1:07:04] and we know why
[1:07:07] he said why
[1:07:08] jacob alone was the seed
[1:07:11] jacob had the seed though he was a
[1:07:13] shyster and esau was a better moral man
[1:07:16] outwardly esau did better works
[1:07:20] but they weren't being judged on human
[1:07:22] merit
[1:07:26] amen god didn't accept human merit he
[1:07:29] says right here he said
[1:07:31] he said
[1:07:33] in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out
[1:07:35] for the children not being born neither
[1:07:37] having done good or evil that the
[1:07:39] purpose of god according to election
[1:07:42] so how did he love us first i loved i as
[1:07:46] many as i love what is that in elective
[1:07:48] love
[1:07:50] why because of where you were to begin
[1:07:53] with
[1:07:58] he knew you
[1:08:00] he didn't know he saw but he knew you
[1:08:04] he knew jacob
[1:08:08] amen you say well he knew all things i'm
[1:08:10] not talking about that kind of knowing
[1:08:12] i'm talking about knew you intimately
[1:08:15] knew you you were in him a part of him
[1:08:17] you were in the eternal thought of
[1:08:19] himself
[1:08:21] god had eternal thoughts we know he's
[1:08:24] eternal so those if they're eternal
[1:08:26] thoughts they had to be a part of him
[1:08:31] amen there's only one form of eternal he
[1:08:34] knew all things he knew who would be
[1:08:35] here he knew what what you do he knew he
[1:08:38] created all things
[1:08:40] but not all
[1:08:42] were his seed
[1:08:45] not all was himself
[1:08:48] i didn't have anything to do with that
[1:08:50] neither did you so i can't boast of
[1:08:52] knowing doing anything of good or evil i
[1:08:54] can't boast of myself or my works
[1:08:57] i boast in his love and grace to me
[1:09:00] to call me to himself
[1:09:03] despite myself
[1:09:05] despite my failures despite my heirs
[1:09:08] despise everything else
[1:09:10] he chose me
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:16] amen to be his he chose me to be his
[1:09:20] dwelling place
[1:09:24] um
[1:09:27] that kind of jumped way
[1:09:30] all right
[1:09:32] now he said so he said that purpose of
[1:09:37] god according to election might stand he
[1:09:39] said not of works not of works
[1:09:43] satan has always taken you around the
[1:09:45] bush by works
[1:09:48] if you fail works he's right there to
[1:09:50] condemn you
[1:09:52] you did this you did that i say you're
[1:09:54] talking to the wrong man because i have
[1:09:57] a i am a resurrected son of god raised
[1:10:00] from the dead passed from death unto
[1:10:02] life
[1:10:02] and you can't pin those works on me
[1:10:04] because i never did them to begin with
[1:10:06] i'm justified as though i'd never done
[1:10:08] it
[1:10:13] amen
[1:10:14] he justified you
[1:10:16] you didn't justify yourself he declared
[1:10:19] you righteous because you were in him
[1:10:22] always
[1:10:24] to be eternal you didn't come into him
[1:10:26] somewhere you always were in him and you
[1:10:29] could never leave him because eternity
[1:10:31] can't end
[1:10:34] it never had a start that didn't have an
[1:10:35] end
[1:10:36] can we we can't fathom that in our
[1:10:38] little finite mental minds but something
[1:10:41] in our hearts says that's right
[1:10:48] amen amen
[1:10:50] all right so
[1:10:53] so he says it's not of works but him by
[1:10:56] but of him that calleth the love is
[1:10:58] elective love it is his love for his
[1:11:00] elect it is his love for his elect you
[1:11:04] didn't earn it
[1:11:07] you can't earn it
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:13] that's right and we believe in good
[1:11:14] works but good work should show your
[1:11:16] faith in christ
[1:11:19] are you with me faith with how works is
[1:11:21] dead because if you really believe god
[1:11:24] you'll act like you do if you really
[1:11:25] believe you're healed you go to acting
[1:11:27] like you're healed the works declares
[1:11:29] the faith
[1:11:32] and if you really love him your works
[1:11:34] will declare you'd love him
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:40] he loved you did not his works declared
[1:11:42] that he loved you
[1:11:45] sure did
[1:11:47] he died for you he gave his life for you
[1:11:49] he he shed his life for you he made the
[1:11:51] redemption for the price of you when you
[1:11:53] were a sinner
[1:11:54] no good
[1:11:56] deadbeat
[1:12:01] he took
[1:12:03] he took your penalty
[1:12:06] he took
[1:12:07] the chastisement of your peace
[1:12:10] he took your sickness
[1:12:12] he took your sin
[1:12:14] and bore it in his body
[1:12:20] and we were in him bearing the judgment
[1:12:22] he took the judgment for sin in his body
[1:12:25] you were judged right there
[1:12:27] and because he rose again sealed that
[1:12:30] judgment
[1:12:32] you could never come back into a
[1:12:34] christian a real believer can't die
[1:12:39] he's resurrected how can he die when
[1:12:41] he's already risen
[1:12:42] i'm not talking about the human part
[1:12:45] this will rise again how many believe
[1:12:47] that you go in the grave this will rise
[1:12:48] again because he's already bought it
[1:12:50] it's his it's his own
[1:12:53] it can't come up like this
[1:12:54] but it'll come up because sin can't rise
[1:12:58] unbelief can't rise
[1:13:00] mistakes and failures will never rise
[1:13:01] again once they're dead they're gone
[1:13:03] period that's it
[1:13:05] but this body will rise again because
[1:13:07] quickening power is in it
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:12] all right
[1:13:14] now
[1:13:20] okay
[1:13:21] so he said then then his love for us is
[1:13:25] apart from human merit
[1:13:28] the purpose of god the purpose of god
[1:13:31] stands in election
[1:13:34] that is opposite to works or anything
[1:13:37] man has in himself
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:47] all right
[1:13:48] in the same book page 149 we look at
[1:13:51] these these things
[1:13:53] here
[1:13:56] in church age book
[1:14:00] trying to i'm trying to get down to this
[1:14:01] and i've got just a few more minutes
[1:14:03] here so 149. now these are familiar
[1:14:06] quotes
[1:14:07] but as i said we read and we reread and
[1:14:09] we read and we reread and somewhere it
[1:14:11] just quickens and keeps coming alive
[1:14:14] i may experience that
[1:14:16] absolutely
[1:14:18] it's revelation
[1:14:19] god unveiling unfolding
[1:14:22] eternity unfolding
[1:14:25] your eternity unfolding
[1:14:28] did you hear me say that right
[1:14:30] you are eternity
[1:14:32] unfolding
[1:14:34] i'm talking about that
[1:14:36] real you
[1:14:38] the born again you
[1:14:42] see without being born again you'll
[1:14:43] never be able to hear the word for the
[1:14:45] season
[1:14:50] that's right because you have the
[1:14:51] teacher come in to teach it
[1:14:53] to discern it
[1:14:54] to receive it because he said
[1:14:56] i will lead you i will guide you into
[1:14:58] all truth when he the comforters come he
[1:15:00] will lead you into all truth
[1:15:03] without him you can't come there

[1:15:08] so we'll never always put emphasis on
[1:15:10] the new birth but you grow after that

[1:15:16] that new birth that new creation that
[1:15:18] new
[1:15:18] you
[1:15:21] a new race his own race the revelation
[1:15:23] of himself grows into his stature
[1:15:27] into a completeness
[1:15:30] into a capping
[1:15:31] when you receive the holy ghost you
[1:15:33] receive the seal
[1:15:35] it's not the seal up there it's the
[1:15:37] positioning you're positioned
[1:15:40] and that capstone is there it comes down
[1:15:42] brother brandon made it very clear when
[1:15:44] you receive the baptism the holy ghost
[1:15:46] that is the new birth
[1:15:51] amen
[1:15:53] amen okay we can spend a lot of time in
[1:15:55] that i'll touch just briefly on it here
[1:15:58] tonight but on page 149
[1:16:00] the heart purpose i love this i love
[1:16:03] this quote
[1:16:04] the heart purpose
[1:16:06] of god can you imagine the heart purpose
[1:16:08] of god
[1:16:11] here we are going into the very heart
[1:16:12] purpose
[1:16:14] where were you
[1:16:15] going into the very heart purpose of god
[1:16:19] for coming into the heart purpose
[1:16:22] the eternal purpose he said not only is
[1:16:24] that the heart purpose it's the eternal
[1:16:25] purpose
[1:16:27] of god was to take a bride of his own
[1:16:30] choosing
[1:16:32] well i sure wouldn't have chose brother
[1:16:34] david but he did
[1:16:36] i'm talking about the real brother david
[1:16:38] he did
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:44] he chose you
[1:16:45] well i'm not good enough that's what the
[1:16:47] devil will tell you
[1:16:49] but he just he just we just read here
[1:16:51] he's not looking at that whether you're
[1:16:53] good enough or not
[1:16:54] if that's the case jacob would have been
[1:16:56] thrown out
[1:16:57] because he wasn't good enough
[1:16:59] he was a deceiver
[1:17:02] smile
[1:17:03] now you know that's the truth
[1:17:07] he deceived his daddy deceived his
[1:17:09] brother
[1:17:10] but he had to have that birthright
[1:17:14] he was a finigler he was a good jew
[1:17:20] he wanted the birthright
[1:17:22] i want the riches i want the right
[1:17:26] god said i honored that
[1:17:28] that was something beyond jacob
[1:17:31] because that was the type
[1:17:33] of the birth
[1:17:35] the new birth
[1:17:36] we have the birthright anybody here with
[1:17:38] the birthright to all god owns
[1:17:42] well you're so rich you're beyond what
[1:17:44] you even
[1:17:45] you may be as
[1:17:47] poor as a pauper but
[1:17:50] like i am but
[1:17:51] you're rich
[1:17:56] amen beyond
[1:17:58] what you can imagine
[1:18:00] amen all right so
[1:18:02] he says here he says
[1:18:04] that was a bride of his own choosing
[1:18:06] that's his eternal purpose his heart
[1:18:07] purpose that choose a bride of his own
[1:18:09] choosing his own choosing and that
[1:18:11] purpose can you imagine god chose you by
[1:18:14] his own choosing amazing
[1:18:16] he chose you by his own choosing
[1:18:22] he said
[1:18:23] he hears his own choosing and he says
[1:18:25] the heart purpose was the zone choosing
[1:18:28] and that purpose was in himself nobody
[1:18:31] else involved in this it's himself
[1:18:34] creator of heavens and earth author of
[1:18:36] life giver of every good gift he chose
[1:18:38] you
[1:18:42] was in himself and being eternal him
[1:18:45] being eternal was decreed this was
[1:18:48] already decreed before the foundation
[1:18:51] before the foundation of the world
[1:18:59] think of that
[1:19:01] he wasn't he wasn't worried about who
[1:19:02] was going to hear it
[1:19:04] he decreed it
[1:19:06] he decreed himself i'll be this i'll be
[1:19:09] him he'll preach behind the pulpit on
[1:19:11] this certain day and this is i've i've
[1:19:13] chosen him i've chose her i've chose him
[1:19:14] i've chose arabic
[1:19:17] and they're going to accept my word and
[1:19:18] they won't be satisfied until they meet
[1:19:20] me in themselves
[1:19:24] till they have that birth they know that
[1:19:26] they know they pass from death into life
[1:19:28] and then they'll start growing they'll
[1:19:30] start growing in the stature they'll
[1:19:32] start growing up into the very into my
[1:19:34] very being into my merry self love
[1:19:38] that's who i am
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:43] all right
[1:19:45] and he says
[1:19:48] before god was god before other words
[1:19:50] before god was an object of worship
[1:19:52] before god was god god is an object of
[1:19:55] war adoration no one else there to
[1:19:57] worship him so it so he's only at that
[1:19:59] time potentially god when he decreed it
[1:20:01] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[1:20:04] the bride was already in his mind
[1:20:10] already
[1:20:12] and you thought you just come around and
[1:20:13] i have such a problem every day why
[1:20:16] because you're discerning yourself by
[1:20:18] your mistakes and your ups and your
[1:20:20] downs and how you feel and how you don't
[1:20:23] feel and i don't feel like this and i
[1:20:25] don't feel like that must be something
[1:20:27] wrong with you
[1:20:29] who are you judging that by
[1:20:31] his word
[1:20:33] he said i'll never leave you i'll never
[1:20:35] forsake you i'll be with you even in you
[1:20:38] i'll direct you i'll guide you i'll lead
[1:20:40] you into all truth
[1:20:42] i've healed your body i've made every oh
[1:20:44] lord meet my need he said well i've done
[1:20:45] it just reading such and such a
[1:20:47] scripture here and i've already met it
[1:20:48] what are you going to do about it
[1:20:50] you're going to accept it
[1:20:55] amen it's the amen it's the end of all
[1:20:58] strife his word is your absolute
[1:21:01] all right then he said
[1:21:03] the bride was already in his mind yes
[1:21:05] she was she was existing it wasn't just
[1:21:09] well this is a nice thought it's the
[1:21:10] thought no she was existing
[1:21:16] she was eternal and she was existing in
[1:21:18] his very thoughts of himself the eternal
[1:21:20] the thoughts of the eternal and he said
[1:21:23] and what about those thoughts of god
[1:21:25] they are eternal are they not the
[1:21:26] eternal thoughts of god let me ask you
[1:21:29] are the thoughts of god eternal
[1:21:32] sure they are
[1:21:34] you can't be thinking of himself and not
[1:21:36] be eternal thoughts
[1:21:41] hallelujah where were you
[1:21:46] if you can see this he said you will see
[1:21:48] many things
[1:21:50] if you can see this you will see many
[1:21:52] things
[1:21:53] god is
[1:21:54] unchangeable amen i could go on and on
[1:21:57] here the thoughts of god are eternal
[1:22:00] they
[1:22:01] are real he never had another thought
[1:22:04] about you he doesn't have a new thought
[1:22:06] about you what he had in his mind about
[1:22:08] you and about being himself and about
[1:22:09] his choosing about being his bride has
[1:22:11] never changed it's never wavered it's
[1:22:13] not based on your marriage it's not
[1:22:15] based on nothing you are free
[1:22:19] you are released
[1:22:25] i wonder the devil thought me so hard
[1:22:27] about getting this out today
[1:22:29] tried to chew my lip up i
[1:22:31] bumped it down i got a sharp tooth there
[1:22:33] and about
[1:22:34] he said i'll get him i'll keep him from
[1:22:36] talking
[1:22:38] then he made my eye my eye it looks like
[1:22:40] it may be a little watered up or
[1:22:41] something
[1:22:42] i said lord this is your eyes they
[1:22:44] haven't bothered me yet so
[1:22:46] amen

[1:22:53] word that's your absolute
[1:22:56] well i don't feel like it i must not
[1:22:57] have my healing it doesn't based on what
[1:22:59] you feel it's based on the word
[1:23:04] you don't add to it what you feel you
[1:23:06] don't reason with it
[1:23:08] you take it
[1:23:09] you apply it
[1:23:13] you have the token to apply it
[1:23:16] if you're born again

[1:23:21] to apply the word
[1:23:23] you apply the blood you can apply the
[1:23:26] blood
[1:23:30] not only you say it was the blood of god
[1:23:32] it was your blood too
[1:23:35] not human blood
[1:23:37] and yet it was a human but it was his
[1:23:39] blood and if that blood is is is his
[1:23:42] blood then you are set completely free
[1:23:44] there's no more condemnation when you've
[1:23:46] come through that blood nothing can come
[1:23:48] through that blood but himself but his
[1:23:50] life but his own life his own love that

[1:25:50] preacher that preachers what about the
[1:25:52] housewives it's just as important as an
[1:25:55] apostle or a prophet the prophet said
[1:25:57] you have a ministry you're not taking it
[1:25:59] serious enough you're anointed to your
[1:26:01] ministry and a husband ought to
[1:26:03] recognize it
[1:26:05] that's your ministry
[1:26:09] you know that you're anointed to your
[1:26:11] ministry
[1:26:12] to do your ministry
[1:26:16] if it was going to be on the time spent
[1:26:18] my wife has a greater reward than i do
[1:26:22] she's ministering every single day
[1:26:25] sometimes even in the night
[1:26:27] she's ministering
[1:26:29] was she ministering to her home her
[1:26:31] family her husband
[1:26:34] as she serves her husband she serves god
[1:26:37] did you know that
[1:26:39] is that strange to you that's the word
[1:26:45] amen god's looking at it that way
[1:26:51] you see all right what's my purpose to
[1:26:54] do feed the sheep
[1:26:56] serve my household
[1:26:58] amen
[1:26:59] serve her i love her my my my work is to
[1:27:03] love her as christ loved his body
[1:27:06] and real marriage is going to express
[1:27:07] that
[1:27:11] exactly right
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:14] and the wife is going to have respect
[1:27:16] and reverence for her husband
[1:27:18] why because the bride has respect in her
[1:27:20] or her her husband
[1:27:24] amen then the husband ought to lead a
[1:27:26] i'd live a certain life that he can be
[1:27:28] respected
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:35] that's right
[1:27:38] i don't know how i got on that but i'm
[1:27:39] but it's still
[1:27:41] where were you
[1:27:43] here in is love
[1:27:45] talking about it all right
[1:27:47] now
[1:27:50] you are chosen of god
[1:27:52] those who are royal seed the elect of
[1:27:54] god are the predestinated foreign of god
[1:27:56] and we're in the mind of god and in his
[1:27:57] thoughts plain language the true bride
[1:27:59] of christ was in the mind of god
[1:28:01] eternally not expressed okay i've
[1:28:03] already been through it i won't go any
[1:28:04] further than that he said it was very
[1:28:06] apparent that she be called that
[1:28:08] see spoken word bride she's a spoken
[1:28:11] word seed bride because she's expressed
[1:28:14] and he said and she's expressing what
[1:28:17] the word she's always been a part of the
[1:28:18] word she was a part of the word to begin
[1:28:20] with where were you in the word
[1:28:24] it was already clear when he laid the
[1:28:25] foundation had been spoken things were
[1:28:27] beginning to manifest manifest where
[1:28:29] were you in there
[1:28:31] in that word
[1:28:36] amen all right so he said here he said
[1:28:40] so he so she was predestinated him she
[1:28:43] came from the same source
[1:28:46] that our lord came from
[1:28:48] amen the son are you with me you've come
[1:28:51] from the same source was eternal with
[1:28:54] him and let this mind be in you
[1:28:57] as it was in our lord jesus who thought
[1:28:59] it not robbery to be equal with god
[1:29:06] amen are you with me
[1:29:08] we're not above him but we're equal
[1:29:11] that's the mind of god that's the mind
[1:29:13] of god not the mind of the flesh you're
[1:29:15] trying to make up somebody look at i i'm
[1:29:17] god no you're not you're just a lump of
[1:29:19] clay
[1:29:20] but that inside man who you are the real
[1:29:22] you is the spirit of god
[1:29:25] and that's what we operate by i have no
[1:29:28] confidence in this but i've got all the
[1:29:29] confidence in the world of that unveiled
[1:29:32] word that i am
[1:29:33] that's him
[1:29:35] in me jesus knew who he was
[1:29:38] and he operated on that faith
[1:29:42] because faith takes this resting place
[1:29:44] in the eternal unmovable word of god
[1:29:48] hallelujah all right
[1:29:51] so
[1:29:52] we eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:29:55] became the many members spoken word seed
[1:29:58] manifested in flesh let me read that
[1:30:00] again we eternal in his thoughts in our
[1:30:04] turn our season here now became the many
[1:30:07] members spoken word seed manifested in
[1:30:10] flesh and those eternal thoughts now
[1:30:12] manifest in flesh
[1:30:14] are the sons of god even as we are so
[1:30:17] called we did not become seed by the
[1:30:19] rebirth we were seed
[1:30:22] and therefore were reborn you must have
[1:30:24] the seed to be reborn
[1:30:29] remember that spirit can be anointed you
[1:30:31] can do all those things but you can't
[1:30:32] receive the word for your season
[1:30:35] the word's not there but you can do all
[1:30:37] the rest of it you can be anointed to
[1:30:39] shout and dance and speak in tongues and
[1:30:40] prophesy
[1:30:43] balaam was
[1:30:44] and balaam prophesied right
[1:30:46] but he couldn't receive the word
[1:30:49] god revealed his perfect will and he
[1:30:51] wouldn't accept it
[1:30:54] all right
[1:30:55] we go right down the line with them what
[1:30:57] about esau what about what about
[1:31:00] judas
[1:31:02] amen he couldn't stay in the word when
[1:31:05] it went up to receive life he couldn't
[1:31:06] receive life no more than cain could
[1:31:08] receive life
[1:31:11] wrong seed
[1:31:12] it's the seed that tells the difference
[1:31:17] amen
[1:31:18] all right now
[1:31:21] only the elect can be reborn because the
[1:31:24] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:31:26] could be quickened
[1:31:29] what's the quickening of the seed the
[1:31:30] word living in you
[1:31:33] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:31:38] amen
[1:31:40] that's who you are
[1:31:45] all right he said we're seed the reason
[1:31:48] we could be quicken in non-seed there's
[1:31:50] nothing to be quickened
[1:31:53] they'll have a good feeling they have
[1:31:54] this but that but they can never come to
[1:31:56] birth
[1:31:58] never be born again they cannot come to
[1:32:01] real pentecost
[1:32:04] you see real pentecost began without an
[1:32:06] ending
[1:32:07] because it's life
[1:32:10] amen always was came to bur a time when
[1:32:13] pentecost i'm not talking about the
[1:32:14] denominational pentecostal shuck i'm
[1:32:16] talking about real pentecost
[1:32:18] real pentecost makes way for the holy
[1:32:20] ghost himself
[1:32:22] to come right into maturity
[1:32:25] to capping
[1:32:26] to positioning capping his positioning
[1:32:30] amen
[1:32:32] it caps off that birth word
[1:32:34] it's who you are you see where the
[1:32:36] bride's coming to right now that's why
[1:32:38] we're very close to a body change
[1:32:40] because she's knowing who she is
[1:32:44] care about the other they holler all you
[1:32:46] want about your little self-organization
[1:32:49] your self-denominations the reason you
[1:32:51] do that because you don't recognize the
[1:32:52] word living and an action in your day
[1:32:55] and if you don't recognize it there's
[1:32:57] something wrong maybe not born again
[1:33:00] because if you're born again the spirit
[1:33:02] of god in you would lead you into all
[1:33:03] truth
[1:33:05] hallelujah
[1:33:06] bring these things that i said to your
[1:33:08] remembrance
[1:33:09] correct you and you'll be quick to
[1:33:11] answer it
[1:33:13] spear the moment like brother george
[1:33:14] said just on sunday when it when it's
[1:33:16] this time you're hearing the word you
[1:33:18] hear what to do act on it
[1:33:20] right now

[1:33:24] line

[1:33:55] see what he says
[1:33:57] okay i'll be closing here in just a
[1:33:59] short few minutes
[1:34:01] he says
[1:34:02] here paragraph 154
[1:34:08] or 155 excuse me of the church age book
[1:34:15] if you are true seed
[1:34:19] well let's just back up here a minute
[1:34:21] page 154
[1:34:25] what is i want to just solidify this
[1:34:27] there's no question in your mind what is
[1:34:28] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:32] what is the baptism with the holy ghost
[1:34:35] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[1:34:38] body of christ
[1:34:40] it is
[1:34:41] the new birth
[1:34:44] and we just expressed how it would be
[1:34:46] born because that spirit comes to
[1:34:48] quicken that seed and it's a
[1:34:50] resurrection of christ in you
[1:34:53] amen that's the new birth
[1:34:55] all right
[1:34:56] he quickens it
[1:34:58] quickens the seed it's saying there to
[1:35:00] be quickened he planted it there before
[1:35:02] the world began
[1:35:03] he put it there
[1:35:07] but see
[1:35:09] we're too busy
[1:35:11] to go search for it oh i've got more to
[1:35:15] do i've got to kill some deer from my
[1:35:16] father leave me alone jacob i don't care
[1:35:18] about the birth right
[1:35:22] i've got too much to do
[1:35:25] than to sit down and fellowship with the
[1:35:27] lord
[1:35:28] and eat of the book
[1:35:30] and make sure i'm right
[1:35:34] you say yeah it hurt
[1:35:35] well
[1:35:37] it probably did
[1:35:40] but the nail needs to be clenched
[1:35:44] where are you standing
[1:35:47] are you born again well i hope i am
[1:35:49] that's not enough
[1:35:51] this new birth is not i hope i am
[1:35:56] and it's not because i believe the
[1:35:57] message i'm born again no that's not it
[1:35:59] either well i go to a message church
[1:36:00] that's not it either
[1:36:02] well i shout and i dance i had chills
[1:36:04] and i had this and i did that it's
[1:36:05] nothing you did or did not do it's a
[1:36:07] revelation in you
[1:36:11] it's truth presented it fills you
[1:36:15] it gives you life
[1:36:17] and you know it
[1:36:22] it's not because you i don't know what
[1:36:23] you'll do baptize baptize you may jump
[1:36:26] up and down you may cry you may weep you
[1:36:28] may go hallelujah you may scream top of
[1:36:30] your voice i don't know what you'll do
[1:36:32] it doesn't matter what you do that's not
[1:36:34] the question of the evidence of getting
[1:36:37] is it it changes you
[1:36:41] amen now where's your desire tonight
[1:36:44] you want that more than anything else
[1:36:46] you want that more than relationship you
[1:36:48] want that more than food you want that
[1:36:50] more than land and houses you want that
[1:36:52] more than money you want that more than
[1:36:54] popularity
[1:36:55] what is your desire tonight
[1:37:02] if you're longing for it there's a deep
[1:37:04] calling to that
[1:37:06] then there's the deep to respond
[1:37:10] god doesn't play around he's not
[1:37:12] speaking this message tonight just to
[1:37:14] play with you give you a message
[1:37:17] he's trying to get across to something
[1:37:20] here in his love
[1:37:23] all right now
[1:37:25] he said
[1:37:27] that's the new birth it is the spirit of
[1:37:29] god coming in and filling you after you
[1:37:31] have repented heard the word and been
[1:37:34] baptized in water as an answer of good
[1:37:36] conscience towards god
[1:37:38] it comes in
[1:37:40] now there's people that can receive the
[1:37:42] baptism of the holy ghost prior to water
[1:37:45] baptism water does not save you water is
[1:37:48] just an outward conscious of the faith
[1:37:50] that you're expressing outwardly that i
[1:37:52] believe i died with him you're showing
[1:37:53] it in baptism and you rose with him that
[1:37:56] faith that i believe what he did for me
[1:37:59] and if there's a real repentance there's
[1:38:00] going to be a real birth
[1:38:05] amen
[1:38:07] all right
[1:38:09] so
[1:38:11] he says here be careful here he said
[1:38:13] it's not the person the country doesn't
[1:38:15] eternally from god it's the word or the
[1:38:18] seed
[1:38:19] that's what it is
[1:38:22] god sends his word to quicken that seed
[1:38:24] god sends his spirit baptism to quicken
[1:38:26] that seed it's the seed that god
[1:38:28] recognizes
[1:38:33] okay
[1:38:34] now if you are true seed
[1:38:36] you will hear that word
[1:38:40] if your true seed you will hear that
[1:38:42] word
[1:38:46] but when you hear in your he said no man
[1:38:49] is never the same when you hear the word
[1:38:51] of god you might hear in your ears
[1:38:54] the voice speaking but when you hear it
[1:38:56] in your heart the voice speaking see
[1:38:58] then you're hearing
[1:39:01] you do not see with your eye you look
[1:39:03] with your eye you see with your heart
[1:39:05] you see something and say i just don't
[1:39:07] see it you mean you don't understand it
[1:39:09] you do not hear with your ears you hear
[1:39:12] with your heart
[1:39:14] amen many times your ears can hear the
[1:39:17] true voice of god and it falls off like
[1:39:19] water off of a duck's back but when you
[1:39:21] really hear you hear with your heart
[1:39:25] that's on the message
[1:39:28] the voice of god in these last days
[1:39:30] you hear with your heart
[1:39:34] so what's your heart saying
[1:39:36] where's your heart
[1:39:38] where's your heart what's the affection
[1:39:40] of your heart you know the scripture on
[1:39:42] that
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:45] set your affection on what things above
[1:39:47] not on things in the earth
[1:39:50] so if you'll hear that word if your true
[1:39:52] seed you will hear that word the spirit
[1:39:53] will baptize you into the body of christ
[1:39:56] filling you and empowering you and you
[1:39:59] will receive that word for your day and
[1:40:02] age
[1:40:04] how clear how clear the true evidence
[1:40:06] becomes see
[1:40:09] when the word is revealed to you
[1:40:14] now we've been constantly saying
[1:40:18] he said when jesus received the holy
[1:40:21] holy ghost positioned him as that son
[1:40:22] before them all and having been filled
[1:40:25] thus the same pattern holds at pentecost
[1:40:27] and ever after he went and demonstrated
[1:40:29] power receiving the full revelation of
[1:40:32] god and from god for that day full
[1:40:36] revelation
[1:40:38] what's he telling you here the evidence
[1:40:40] that where you were to begin with
[1:40:44] how do i know this is how you know
[1:40:48] he said now we have been constantly
[1:40:51] saying that the true evidence of being
[1:40:53] baptized with the holy ghost or born
[1:40:55] again is for the believer to receive the
[1:40:58] word for the age in which he lives you
[1:41:02] have an ear to hear
[1:41:06] god
[1:41:07] okay let's just see here 1
[1:41:10] 273.
[1:41:14] on page 273.
[1:41:21] i thought it wouldn't take much time
[1:41:23] tonight but let's be all these no i'm
[1:41:25] not going to complain about that god has
[1:41:27] his way
[1:41:28] he said he had a ministry talking about
[1:41:30] judas he had a minister granted unto him
[1:41:33] and he healed the sick he cast out
[1:41:35] devils in jesus name but when the
[1:41:37] showdown came he sold out for gold and
[1:41:40] political power he said how can that be
[1:41:42] when only god can cast out a devil
[1:41:45] because the rain falls on the just
[1:41:47] and the unjust
[1:41:50] they bear what they are though
[1:41:52] a cocklebur will never be a wheat and
[1:41:54] the wheat can never be a cuckleber but
[1:41:56] they receive the same rain and live by
[1:41:57] that rain but they can't receive the
[1:41:59] word for their season because the water
[1:42:02] was sent for the wheat
[1:42:04] and the wheat would bring the word
[1:42:05] because they'll bring forth of their
[1:42:07] kind
[1:42:08] the water of the lord the word will
[1:42:11] bring forth of its kind and that's what
[1:42:13] we see happening around the message
[1:42:20] we're seeing the separation
[1:42:22] to truth
[1:42:23] the separation between truth and
[1:42:26] error amen
[1:42:29] all right
[1:42:31] no mistake about it if a person that is
[1:42:33] truly baptized with the holy ghost into
[1:42:35] the body of christ receiving the
[1:42:37] fullness of the spirit will be in that
[1:42:39] word all the way
[1:42:44] that is the evidence of being baptized
[1:42:46] with the holy ghost judas failed
[1:42:48] multitudes will fail right there and
[1:42:50] when they fail to go out in that word
[1:42:53] the names are taken off of the book of
[1:42:55] life
[1:42:58] amen i said and got to that portion that
[1:43:01] i wanted to but anyway
[1:43:02] all right i'm gonna i'm gonna bypass
[1:43:05] things that are to be
[1:43:06] but i want to say this in that your life
[1:43:09] was pre-planned
[1:43:11] nothing happens to a christian without
[1:43:14] or happens by chance it's all
[1:43:16] ordained of god
[1:43:19] just chew on that a while a christian
[1:43:22] he's not denoting a christian is a loose
[1:43:24] term today but real christian means
[1:43:26] they're tabernacling deity
[1:43:28] that's a christian christ like and you
[1:43:31] can't be christ-like without god being
[1:43:33] in you
[1:43:35] amen
[1:43:36] you're gonna you're gonna live this kind
[1:43:38] of life you're gonna receive the word as
[1:43:40] he did you're gonna know who you are as
[1:43:42] he did
[1:43:43] amen
[1:43:44] all right so so being christ-like is to
[1:43:48] have deity living in you that's a
[1:43:49] christian
[1:43:52] why are you a christian i will i go to a
[1:43:53] certain church i go to i go to uh
[1:43:55] brother paul's church i go to grace
[1:43:57] tabernacle and doing some a christian
[1:43:58] that doesn't mean a thing
[1:44:00] that you're a christian christians will
[1:44:02] go to church
[1:44:03] but because you come to this church you
[1:44:06] can go to hell
[1:44:09] i'm not saying that loosely i'm saying
[1:44:11] that with every bit of sincerity i know
[1:44:13] that doesn't save you
[1:44:15] just because you can proclaim
[1:44:16] intellectually i'm a part of the message
[1:44:18] without the birth of the word in you
[1:44:20] without the revelation of jesus christ
[1:44:22] in you you're not going in a rapture
[1:44:24] you're being left here for the
[1:44:25] tribulation so it behooves us to be sure
[1:44:29] because i don't know if you'll make it
[1:44:30] out of this room i don't know if you'll
[1:44:32] get home tonight
[1:44:34] i don't even know if i will
[1:44:38] amen let's why not have a knowing
[1:44:40] instead of a hope so
[1:44:42] instead of imagining it so let's have a
[1:44:44] hope so i mean excuse me have a no-sew
[1:44:51] where's the complaining when you know
[1:44:53] that you had to be if you had if you're
[1:44:55] born of god you had to be in god before
[1:44:57] the foundation of the world you had to
[1:44:59] have the gene of god in you
[1:45:02] and when you and when that receives that
[1:45:04] what's it declaring to you well then the
[1:45:07] brother sister failures and all that
[1:45:09] you've overcome every bit of that
[1:45:14] god's not looking by the ways of the
[1:45:15] flesh no more he doesn't judge you by
[1:45:17] the ways of the flesh he sees what's in
[1:45:19] you
[1:45:21] the blood has has sanctified and then
[1:45:24] allowed him to come in and live his life
[1:45:26] in you let's go beyond sanctification
[1:45:29] we're actually we're sanctified every
[1:45:31] day by the word
[1:45:33] the blood cleanses us keeps us clean
[1:45:36] let's go beyond that and get to the
[1:45:38] point of contact brother sister filled
[1:45:41] with the holy ghost in this hour you
[1:45:42] become god's point of contact
[1:45:46] and contact salt has to have contact in
[1:45:49] order to heal in order to express life
[1:45:51] in order to
[1:45:53] in order to to um ex to
[1:45:58] give life
[1:46:00] a believer can do that
[1:46:02] that's not the word i want to use so but
[1:46:06] to believers they can impart life that's
[1:46:09] what i want to say you can impart life
[1:46:11] the prophet said what is the greater
[1:46:12] works of jesus christ to impart life he
[1:46:15] said a believer can impart life to a
[1:46:17] believer
[1:46:19] a real christian can impart life but he
[1:46:21] has to have the contact
[1:46:23] and you are god's point of contact
[1:46:25] because you're god's word expressed in
[1:46:28] this hour you are himself living
[1:46:33] and the great revelation of it is that
[1:46:35] it's in bright form he is
[1:46:38] that had to be expressed to fulfill i'll
[1:46:41] leave it right there
[1:46:43] but everything everything
[1:46:45] has been pre-planned
[1:46:47] you are all pre-planned by god nothing
[1:46:50] happens by chance with god it's all
[1:46:52] pre-planned
[1:46:55] amen then your failures your mistakes
[1:46:57] your ups and downs your trials your
[1:46:59] temptations has all been pre-planned by
[1:47:01] god
[1:47:06] so what are you going to do when you go
[1:47:07] through it you're going to take god
[1:47:11] you're going to place god in front of
[1:47:12] you place god before you
[1:47:15] it's been planned he knew it would
[1:47:17] happen he was all he allowed it
[1:47:23] just to see what you're gonna do
[1:47:26] you're being expressed in a being see
[1:47:29] all right
[1:47:30] but everything i don't believe a person
[1:47:32] just happened to be here even your birth
[1:47:34] here was pre-planned what about your
[1:47:36] spiritual birth
[1:47:40] now listen to this and i'm closing right
[1:47:42] here
[1:47:49] i don't believe that a person just
[1:47:51] happened to be here by chance
[1:47:54] and when you come to the world
[1:47:55] everything had to be for prepared for
[1:47:57] you and pre prepared rather for you i
[1:48:00] don't hardly understand that how we
[1:48:02] could think that a god that could
[1:48:04] prepare all these good things for us
[1:48:06] would not could he not
[1:48:08] could we not put trust in could we not
[1:48:11] put trust in him
[1:48:15] he created you you didn't have anything
[1:48:17] to do with coming into the earth at this
[1:48:18] time
[1:48:19] he brought you this earth he created the
[1:48:21] worlds by spoken word he brought you
[1:48:22] here
[1:48:24] look at what he's done look where you
[1:48:25] were cannot you trust him
[1:48:29] if he brought us in this chaos that
[1:48:30] we're in now if he brought us in this
[1:48:34] chaos that we're in now and prepared the
[1:48:36] good things of life for us here how much
[1:48:39] more can we trust him to prepare the
[1:48:41] things that is to come see the eternal
[1:48:44] things
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:48] hallelujah that's right
[1:48:50] how much more can we trust him
[1:48:53] all pre-planned
[1:48:57] the cloudy
[1:48:58] skies and the storms of life are no
[1:49:01] signs of god's disapproval
[1:49:04] neither are bright skies and still water
[1:49:06] signs of his love and approval
[1:49:09] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:49:12] beloved you were already approved
[1:49:15] his love is elective which he had for us
[1:49:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:49:21] does he love us yes how shall we know we
[1:49:24] shall know because he said so
[1:49:26] and
[1:49:27] manifested that he did love us for he
[1:49:29] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[1:49:32] spirit
[1:49:33] placing us
[1:49:34] as sons
[1:49:37] and how shall i prove my love to him
[1:49:39] by believing what he said
[1:49:44] and conducting my sin by conducting
[1:49:46] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[1:49:50] he
[1:49:50] he in his wisdom allows to come to
[1:49:54] pass amen
[1:49:57] ruthie if you'd come
