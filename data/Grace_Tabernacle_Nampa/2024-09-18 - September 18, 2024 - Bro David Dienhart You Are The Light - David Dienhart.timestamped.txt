[21:34] Wednesday as we were on the second part
[21:37] my
[21:40] my my title tonight is a little
[21:44] different than it was last time and it's
[21:46] been different the last time than it was
[21:48] the first time and I just I just I
[21:52] thought I could understand why Lord
[21:53] because it's just
[21:56] expanding and so my title is you are the
[22:00] light let me just rephrase that not my
[22:03] title his title but I'm saying it as he
[22:07] would say it my
[22:12] title you are the light his life made
[22:15] manifest part
[22:17] three he are the light his life made
[22:21] manifest what is his life made manifest
[22:24] for it is light it is the light and the
[22:28] and the the Bible said ye are the light
[22:29] Jesus said I am the light then he said
[22:32] and ye are the light because why you are
[22:34] part of me to begin
[22:36] with and you are manifest in your season
[22:39] in your time that makes life his life
[22:44] manifested the word for the season but
[22:46] you are part of that word is being
[22:49] manifested and that's
[22:51] light now Darkness can't stand before
[22:54] light bride just recognize your position
[22:57] Lord Darkness cannot stand before
[23:00] light amen and the light is risen upon
[23:04] the bride it's not risen upon anyone
[23:06] else in this hour but it has risen upon
[23:09] you amen you're that manifestation in
[23:13] the in the time of insanity and gross
[23:16] darkness and everywhere around us we see
[23:19] nothing but chaos brother brandom said
[23:20] it's chaos like it was in the beginning
[23:23] when he said let there be
[23:25] light we've come he said back to that
[23:27] same position if you'd like to know
[23:29] where he said that it's on the message
[23:31] preached in Prescot 65 10:31 morning if
[23:34] you want to pick that up chaos he said
[23:37] it's back to what it was the beginning
[23:40] and what are we looking forward to we're
[23:42] looking for this Earth to have its
[23:44] baptism and we're looking for that
[23:46] baptism to bring about a body change in
[23:49] this earth when we step in the
[23:51] Millennium we have new
[23:52] bodies amen we've already we're standing
[23:56] here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:58] the seed is that birth word that spoken
[24:01] word for the season manifested we are we
[24:05] are received we've receive that what
[24:07] will that do for us it'll take us to a
[24:08] body change it is taking us to a body
[24:12] change little by little we're part we're
[24:15] we're taking the land amen of the Holy
[24:18] Spirit himself that's our place that's
[24:20] who we're called to take that's our
[24:23] position so my subject tonight is again
[24:27] as we took last Wednesday
[24:29] that special class of people brother
[24:30] Brandon referring to that in the in the
[24:32] church age book that special class of
[24:34] people is those that can and that have
[24:37] the ability to hear from God to hear God
[24:41] speak
[24:43] amen they have the ability and only she
[24:46] has the ability to hear the word or hear
[24:49] from God Amen so Ephesians one I want to
[24:52] read this again chapter or verse three
[24:55] blessed be the god of and father of our
[24:58] Lord Jesus Christ now what was our Lord
[25:01] Jesus Christ it was the manifestation of
[25:04] the father in
[25:06] flesh as son is that right who was this
[25:09] person he was absolutely the seed of
[25:14] God how many say Amen to that amen amen
[25:17] all right so blessed be the God and
[25:20] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[25:22] past tense already blessed us who's he
[25:26] speaking
[25:27] to whoever was in him is who he's
[25:29] speaking to yes amen because he came
[25:32] forth with the fullness of the godhead
[25:34] bodily God was in fullness in him then
[25:37] then being in him somewhere we had to be
[25:40] a part of him and in him before the
[25:42] world began
[25:46] then then that's what I
[25:49] am amen and so God blessed be the God
[25:54] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[25:56] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[25:59] blessings CU I was in him in fullness I

[33:27] opened
[33:28] Adam's side and took part of his
[33:34] flesh

[33:38] his flesh part of his body which was
[33:43] what his his wife the
[33:46] feminine which was his wife amen now she
[33:52] was part of his
[33:54] flesh and brother and the scripture said
[33:58] in the appointed time that God brought
[34:02] her to the man other words he brought

[34:36] ability to hear from God see brother
[34:40] Braham said she I'm I'm saying I'm
[34:42] saying what he said but this is what I'm
[34:44] what we're saying this is this is not
[34:46] just rhetoric this isn't not just quotes
[34:49] brother sister don't accept it that way
[34:52] this is

[35:21] was flesh of his flesh she was the
[35:23] mystery of
[35:24] Adam
[35:26] unsealed so what was
[35:29] unsealed Adam was
[35:31] unsealed amen Amen brother Bram said the
[35:34] opening of the seals was for what
[35:36] purpose to show the bride where she
[35:39] started I'm just paraphrasing it I you
[35:41] can come back to the exact scripture you
[35:44] paragraph
[35:45] 12 rising of the sun he said this
[35:49] opening of the seals was for to
[35:51] recognize where she come from who she
[35:53] was and where she was going and how
[35:55] she'd be revealed here in the end
[35:59] amen how she was revealed in him in the
[36:02] beginning how that she would be known
[36:05] and revealed in the
[36:07] end this was God's Great hidden Mystery
[36:10] amen and brother Bram referred to it as
[36:13] the mystery that was in the back part of
[36:15] his
[36:16] mind amen she was taken from
[36:20] Christ so she today is flesh of his
[36:24] flesh bone of his bone brother when
[36:27] Christ went to Calvary he went with you
[36:29] in
[36:30] him he had not been separated yet he was
[36:33] both male and female but he had his body
[36:36] in him he that was his body that he
[36:40] would be able to bed himself
[36:44] in who was he the seed Where Were You
[36:49] Who were

[37:16] bone amen so so the so here we are this
[37:22] message therefore shows the bride her
[37:25] origin

[52:38] yolk to one Spirit what are we yok to
[52:40] Same
[52:44] Spirit take my yoke upon you my yoke is
[52:47] easy he's given us his word how much
[52:49] easier is that but who standing in the
[52:52] way your

[52:56] your enemy is this this carnal man
[53:00] that's the greatest enemy you've got put
[53:02] your name there David dehart is the
[53:04] greatest enemy I've
[53:07] got but the word brings it under
[53:09] submission the word brings it under
[53:11] control if you'll let him do
[53:15] it you've got to let him you give him
[53:18] the headship you give him the
[53:21] deity what's a wife give her husband if
[53:24] the wife doesn't give her husband
[53:25] headship has no
[53:27] headship he may be the head but where's
[53:30] the headship without her giving that
[53:32] headship to him he can't come to his
[53:34] position he won't be in his
[53:36] position he might as well just be single
[53:39] you might as well be single too because
[53:41] you're putting yourself as an idol
[53:43] before you instead of serving the word
[53:46] and here we are listening to lying
[53:48] vanities putting lying vanities as our
[53:51] Idol instead of taking what the word
[53:53] said you're forsaking your own Mercy
[53:55] amen because Christ is here he's here
[53:59] now we're serving a person we're obeying
[54:02] a person we honor a person do you
[54:05] realize that person is here do you
[54:07] realize what it was who took the book
[54:10] who took what was whose sword was it in
[54:13] the hand of that
[54:15] Prophet it was his sword right it was
[54:18] the king's
[54:19] sword was the king the man William Bram
[54:22] no then who was it standing there as he
[54:25] said he would come through a prophet and
[54:27] stand there with the sword in his
[54:30] hand who opened the seals who took the
[54:35] book who who cried out as a lion that
[54:41] Roars who put his word in who put his
[54:45] word did not he say I will do nothing
[54:47] but I reveal my secrets to my servants
[54:49] the prophet so he himself stepped forth
[54:52] he became steep forth took the book took
[54:56] the sword in his
[54:59] hand held the sword in his hand and Loos
[55:02] those seals who do you think it was you
[55:04] think it was a man that did that no it
[55:07] was God himself standing there as a man
[55:10] taking the sword in his hand amen and
[55:13] opened and loose that word who did it
[55:16] Loose to you and
[55:20] I
[55:22] amen hallelujah all right so if the
[55:25] bride is and he's got the word in his
[55:27] grip and watch what he says he's got the
[55:29] word in his grip comes in
[55:35] us where is he coming in
[55:38] us I wonder if we can see the mystery of
[55:41] the seven seal the prophet said was his
[55:46] coming is his coming over with no his
[55:48] coming goes all the way out here all the
[55:50] way and it blows out into this into the
[55:54] Millennium out of the Millennium into
[55:55] the new City amen it's his coming it's
[55:58] all the coming of the Lord but what part
[56:01] are we what part are we
[56:05] playing if he doesn't have his bride
[56:08] then none of the rest of it comes to
[56:10] manifestation it's his
[56:14] coming and he's coming in the form he's
[56:18] brother Brandon made it very clear it's
[56:20] the bride coming of
[56:21] Christ it's not another it's himself
[56:25] she's here to Reve one person the son of
[56:28] man right now many will stand here and
[56:31] listen to this and say that's a bunch of
[56:33] that's a b why my goodness what do he
[56:35] think he is and who does he think he is

[1:04:08] striking why is California under
[1:04:09] judgment we know it is brother Ram said
[1:04:12] judgment has begun on the west coast is
[1:04:15] that right he said it's already
[1:04:18] begun he was crucified aresh by the
[1:04:21] churches put on Calvary brother Braham
[1:04:23] said that earthquake in in Alaska in
[1:04:26] 1964 was the sign of that time that he
[1:04:28] has been officially put
[1:04:33] out what's the next
[1:04:36] one I say next what next Earth remember
[1:04:39] there's an earthquake at his
[1:04:42] resurrection what are we looking for
[1:04:44] what are we expecting every day brother
[1:04:46] sister I'm such under expectation I walk
[1:04:49] out there in the morning early I go out
[1:04:51] there and I'm not saying it has to be
[1:04:52] that way you may be driving down the
[1:04:54] road I don't know where you'll be but
[1:04:55] you're going to have something appear
[1:04:57] before you your loved
[1:04:59] ones it's that close I know it's
[1:05:06] close I wish I could pull it out and
[1:05:08] express it in bright shining Neon Lights
[1:05:11] it's that
[1:05:12] close I don't think there's anyone that
[1:05:15] has a revelation of this holding it
[1:05:17] within them that doesn't know that and
[1:05:18] realize that how close I don't
[1:05:21] know I don't know I just know that every
[1:05:25] moment I'm looking for that one to
[1:05:27] appear what am I looking for because
[1:05:29] when I know that appears that it's that
[1:05:32] time is time for my
[1:05:34] change which I've looked for we'll be
[1:05:36] caught up together to meet him in the
[1:05:38] air how many's looking forward to that
[1:05:41] but what do you have to have first to
[1:05:43] get there you've got to have the
[1:05:45] revelation of this abiding in
[1:05:49] you it's always been God's way to reveal
[1:05:53] it then by revelation thy faith thy
[1:05:56] faith has made you whole thy faith has
[1:05:58] done thy faith thy faith has changed
[1:06:01] your
[1:06:03] body is that right that faith will do
[1:06:07] that amen it's Revelation brother sister
[1:06:10] it's Revelation he did not reveal
[1:06:12] himself to no other but his reveal his
[1:06:15] bride
[1:06:16] amen the rest of them can have an
[1:06:18] intellectual idea and intellectual but
[1:06:21] how do you know it's Revelation because
[1:06:22] it lives itself through you you don't
[1:06:24] have to pump up you don't have to work
[1:06:26] it up it's going to happen automatically
[1:06:29] it's going to be there because it's his
[1:06:31] life and the works that he did you'll do
[1:06:33] also what was his Works to believe to
[1:06:36] absolutely Hold Steady on that word and
[1:06:38] hold that word in every situation I
[1:06:40] don't care what happens that word is
[1:06:42] your absolute you'll hold right there
[1:06:44] and said thou there is my
[1:06:50] works and it's got to be
[1:06:53] manifest amen amen
[1:06:56] Hallelujah so he brought him by the word
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:01] now now I don't know how far to go with
[1:07:03] this I'm not going to go much further
[1:07:05] I'll just have to pick it up again but
[1:07:07] I'm trying to hit these high points of
[1:07:09] this now turn to Isaiah or second
[1:07:13] Corinthians 4 I didn't even come to that
[1:07:15] did I 2
[1:07:17] Corinthians I've just got off the first
[1:07:19] page even 2 Corinthians chapter 4
[1:07:40] in verse six now we have a Ministry I
[1:07:43] think that's very clear we have a
[1:07:46] Ministry Revel or 2 Corinthians 4:1 says
[1:07:49] we have a Ministry that we've received
[1:07:51] Mercy what's our ministry we've received
[1:07:53] Mercy then as freely as have received
[1:07:56] freely give yes amen as we said don't
[1:08:00] start looking at your lying vanities out
[1:08:04] here the senses what they tell you
[1:08:07] that's not your head Jonah said Jonah
[1:08:10] said I'll look I'll look once again to
[1:08:13] the temple I'll look once again to where
[1:08:15] God's dwelling where does he dwell in
[1:08:18] what's he does he dwell in his church or
[1:08:20] in his word the Catholic priest said God
[1:08:23] dwells in his church brother Bram said
[1:08:24] God dwells in his
[1:08:26] word then if his word is in
[1:08:29] you that's where God
[1:08:32] dwells amen
[1:08:35] amen and you had to be in him to be the
[1:08:41] word so 2 Corinthians 46 for
[1:08:46] God now watch verse 5 We Don't Preach
[1:08:49] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[1:08:52] ourselves your servants for jesus' sake
[1:08:55] for God not another himself God who
[1:08:58] commanded the
[1:08:59] light to shine out of
[1:09:03] Darkness amen did he command that what
[1:09:06] was the spoken word was what the
[1:09:08] Original Seed is that right then the
[1:09:11] then God who commanded the light to
[1:09:13] shine out of Darkness hath shined in our
[1:09:18] we put my you put my in there my heart
[1:09:22] to give the light to give the light
[1:09:26] what is the message God is light this
[1:09:28] then is the message God is light and him
[1:09:31] is no Darkness at all in him amen is
[1:09:34] there any Darkness at all in him no
[1:09:36] shadow of turning the Bible said if
[1:09:38] there's a shadow then there's Darkness
[1:09:39] mixed in it is that right but there's no
[1:09:42] darkness in
[1:09:46] him you've got to recognize your
[1:09:48] position that you are the
[1:09:50] light the reason you're the light
[1:09:52] because you're his life see what God's
[1:09:54] driving at here you are his life so God
[1:09:59] who commanded the light to shine out of
[1:10:01] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:10:03] give the light to give the light the
[1:10:06] revelation of the knowledge of the glory
[1:10:09] of God in the face that in the face is
[1:10:12] in the person
[1:10:14] of so how's God manifesting himself he's
[1:10:18] manifesting himself in the person of
[1:10:20] Jesus Christ in you that's exactly what
[1:10:23] the prophet said the new birth was
[1:10:26] he said the new birth is Jesus Christ
[1:10:28] revealed in
[1:10:29] you unveiled in
[1:10:33] you amen he said I'll build my church on
[1:10:37] that Revelation and the Gates of Hell
[1:10:39] will prevail against it so relax let off
[1:10:43] the pressure the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:10:45] Prevail against
[1:10:48] it then quit looking at
[1:10:53] your at your vanity
[1:10:56] vanities and look and keep focused on
[1:11:00] the
[1:11:01] word
[1:11:03] amen the word that abides the word
[1:11:06] that's directing the word that's guiding
[1:11:08] you the word that's leading
[1:11:12] you I'm coming to that just a minute if
[1:11:14] I can get through it before we have to
[1:11:16] close
[1:11:20] here amen
[1:11:23] why Amen Let Me finish the scripture in
[1:11:26] the face of Jesus Christ in the person
[1:11:29] of Jesus Christ amen did you get that
[1:11:34] but we have this
[1:11:35] treasure in Earth and vessels what is it
[1:11:38] then it's a hidden treasure but the
[1:11:41] treasure to you and I have been unveiled
[1:11:44] oh my I find this
[1:11:47] treasure amen I I can't give it to
[1:11:49] someone else it's my
[1:11:52] treasure it's the treasure he let me we
[1:11:55] find the
[1:11:57] treasure worth more than 10,000 worlds
[1:12:00] this
[1:12:02] treasure amen for we have this treasure
[1:12:06] in Earth and
[1:12:08] vessels Earth and
[1:12:10] vessels sexual born
[1:12:13] vessels
[1:12:15] mortal vessels but we have this treasure
[1:12:18] in Earth and vessels why because there
[1:12:21] was a seed that was there
[1:12:25] amen is that that God that God was the
[1:12:28] seed The Germ brother Brown said and in
[1:12:30] the age that you were to come on come in
[1:12:33] by the word The Germ the word found you
[1:12:37] that bedding
[1:12:41] ground because you were meant to be
[1:12:43] together one he had to come to his
[1:12:46] bedding ground just like you being a
[1:12:48] part of your father you couldn't know
[1:12:51] your father until your father had Union
[1:12:53] with your mother
[1:12:55] the the appointed predestinated portion
[1:12:58] of himself the bedding ground then the
[1:13:01] bedding ground through that you could be
[1:13:02] known to father because you started
[1:13:05] growing is that right then spiritually
[1:13:08] God had to have a
[1:13:10] bride amen he had to have and and and he
[1:13:14] said she would be come forth he knew the
[1:13:18] color of your hair he knew your stature
[1:13:20] he knew your build he knew when you
[1:13:22] would come who you might marry who you
[1:13:23] wouldn't marry he know know was all
[1:13:25] about you and he ordained you because in
[1:13:28] him was that germ to begin with and he
[1:13:31] had to have that bedding ground to unite
[1:13:33] therewith for to Quicken that
[1:13:35] predestinated seed that you
[1:13:39] are
[1:13:40] amen amen amen
[1:13:45] amen see it's a mystery unveiled it's
[1:13:49] revealed amen you are already there I'm
[1:13:53] bypassing a lot I'm just taking see why
[1:13:55] can why can the Dynamics here you are a
[1:13:59] part of the mechanics you are always a
[1:14:01] part of the
[1:14:02] mechanics how I should say let me qu
[1:14:04] requ phrase that how
[1:14:08] why how come you can receive the
[1:14:12] Dynamics is because brother Brown said
[1:14:14] you always were a part of the
[1:14:18] mechanics amen but when you came into
[1:14:21] the Earth you came through a perverted
[1:14:22] fashion but you always were were Amen in
[1:14:28] him so when you came forth to receive
[1:14:31] life in your season your time there was
[1:14:34] something that he put there called the
[1:14:36] predestinated seed that had to that
[1:14:39] water had to come forth and that germ
[1:14:42] had to come to its bedding ground to to
[1:14:45] its position the Dynamics and the
[1:14:48] mechanics had to come
[1:14:52] together amen there you are without
[1:14:55] mechanic just mechanics no
[1:14:57] good word only no good Dynamics only
[1:15:01] still no good but when the Dynamics and
[1:15:04] mechanics come together then you see
[1:15:06] Jesus Christ revealed made manifest the
[1:15:09] same yesterday today and
[1:15:13] forever that's
[1:15:17] you
[1:15:19] hallelujah amen now you were a part of
[1:15:22] the mechanics the Dynamics found this
[1:15:25] ground to manifest through then how does
[1:15:28] he manifest himself through the word the
[1:15:34] mechanics mechanics Were Meant For Life
[1:15:36] to come to the
[1:15:38] mechanics to manifest what to make the
[1:15:42] change to bring forth your to bring you
[1:15:45] in fellowship with
[1:15:47] himself oh Hallelujah there you are see
[1:15:51] I can't brag he said I'm my first oh I'm

[1:15:59] up Isaiah 9:2 said the people that
[1:16:02] walked in darkness have seen a great
[1:16:05] light and they that dwell in the land of
[1:16:08] the of the shadow of death upon them
[1:16:10] hath the light shined is that right it's
[1:16:14] Isaiah 60 verse1 and two right there

[1:16:21] 23:5 amen though I walk through the
[1:16:23] valley of the shadow of death I fear no
[1:16:25] evil for thou art with
[1:16:27] me you're walking with God Amen all
[1:16:31] right you're walking in the light
[1:16:33] Darkness may be around but it's not
[1:16:35] total darkness because you're walking in
[1:16:37] the light so a part of you that's that
[1:16:41] was complete you were complete but now
[1:16:43] the word has come the light has come
[1:16:45] it's sprung forth a resurrection in your
[1:16:47] soul and now that light becomes a
[1:16:51] shadow I mean that Darkness excuse me
[1:16:53] becomes a shadow because of the
[1:16:57] light so you don't have to fear the
[1:17:02] shadow Don't Fear The Shadow it's just a
[1:17:06] shadow a shadow only reveals that
[1:17:09] there's light and you're that

[1:23:44] just going to bypass it it's all over
[1:23:45] the message you can find
[1:23:48] it you always wasn't God The Germ of
[1:23:52] your life which is an attribute of God
[1:23:54] was which was his thought always was in
[1:23:59] God what was that thought it was the
[1:24:02] thought of himself so what are you

[1:24:07] witness you were with him from the
[1:24:09] beginning amen you're his
[1:24:12] life in the beginning was the word the
[1:24:14] word was with God the Word was God the
[1:24:16] word was with God how was it with God
[1:24:19] when he spoke that this the spoken word
[1:24:22] being the Original Seed when he spoke
[1:24:23] his
[1:24:25] thought
[1:24:26] amen you
[1:24:31] appeared and when he spoke his thought
[1:24:33] in this hour for you to be here you come
[1:24:36] to
[1:24:38] yourself how by the word by the spoken
[1:24:43] word that's how he brother Bram said
[1:24:46] it's by the spoken word is how he births
[1:24:48] his children
[1:24:50] right the new birth is the spoken word
[1:24:53] that's why he said this bride is
[1:24:55] literally the spoken word seed made

[1:25:25] could receive it how may see what we're
[1:25:27] saying all right amen all right
[1:25:32] now only the rain can raise the seed if
[1:25:35] the seed's
[1:25:38] there you were in your F just like you
[1:25:40] were in your father and by betting
[1:25:42] ground of your mother you were made
[1:25:44] manifest in his
[1:25:46] likeness then the great God if You' got
[1:25:49] eternal life then the germ of eternal
[1:25:50] life was in God at the beginning and you
[1:25:52] were there you were his thinking you

[1:26:25] you that's the real
[1:26:29] gift brother Braham said the real gift
[1:26:32] is that Soul down in there that could
[1:26:34] receive and hear the word of
[1:26:36] God all right then quit looking out here

[1:27:02] God he said if you enter in there where
[1:27:05] that shakina glory is what does that
[1:27:07] make you he said part of it because you
[1:27:09] couldn't get in there unless you come
[1:27:11] through the
[1:27:12] blood only the bride can get in there
[1:27:15] that is only her position there is the
[1:27:17] marriage bed there is the union

[1:27:48] body are you with me makes you the
[1:27:51] complete living being are you with me

[1:28:06] senses reasoning memory conscious

[1:28:17] taste filth here the inside body love
[1:28:19] and conscience and so forth five senses
[1:28:22] but the inside of the inside the control
[1:28:26] tower it's either God or
[1:28:29] Satan and that's determined now watch
[1:28:32] what I just won't go ahead of myself and

[1:28:52] you unless you your beginning was that
[1:28:54] soul in there from God he said then that
[1:28:56] other can come out here and be actually
[1:28:59] in their Spirit Anointed with a genuine
[1:29:02] anointing of the Holy Spirit how many
[1:29:05] know that you know that Brother David

[1:29:15] in
[1:29:16] emotions you can't put your confidence
[1:29:19] in gifts you can't put your confidence
[1:29:21] because you had chills you you shouted
[1:29:23] you danced the only confidence you have
[1:29:25] have is that the word is revealed
[1:29:27] personally to you living through
[1:29:30] you all right then here he said now he
[1:29:34] said now let me just read what he said
[1:29:36] you can mimic any of these things you
[1:29:37] can contact like like a Christian or you
[1:29:40] can cast out devils like a
[1:29:43] Christian you can you can mimic these
[1:29:46] things see the inside control tower the
[1:29:48] beginning if the if the beginning the
[1:29:50] origin isn't of God it'll never return
[1:29:53] to God
[1:29:55] isin't that something brother brandom
[1:29:57] you shouldn't talk so straight you scare
[1:29:59] people no you don't scare the bride it
[1:30:03] should do something to you this morning
[1:30:05] it ought to make you
[1:30:09] desperate I want to be
[1:30:11] sure I want to know I have that tug in
[1:30:15] my heart I'm answering that tug in my
[1:30:17] soul I want more of God and it's got to
[1:30:20] come through his Word of Promise for
[1:30:22] this day
[1:30:26] and let's start eating on the open
[1:30:28] book all right let's start taking the
[1:30:31] message and consume
[1:30:33] it let's take it take that and take it
[1:30:36] and let it bring light to the
[1:30:39] scriptures all right he said now you can
[1:30:43] you can if the origin isn't of God it'll
[1:30:45] never return to God do you understand it
[1:30:48] he said did you not did Judas not cast
[1:30:50] out Devils did he not cast out devils
[1:30:54] did Caiaphas the one who condemned him
[1:30:56] put him to death even prophesy didn't
[1:30:59] balum
[1:31:01] prophesy is that right what he said was
[1:31:04] the word of God it's even in the cannon
[1:31:05] of scripture is that
[1:31:08] right was he a false prophet or a true
[1:31:12] Prophet then what made him true or
[1:31:18] false all right he couldn't recognize
[1:31:20] the prophet he couldn't recognize Christ
[1:31:23] being being present in that little group
[1:31:25] of people out there following a
[1:31:29] prophet one both anointed
[1:31:32] prophets both anointed by The Same
[1:31:36] Spirit but one could receive and preach
[1:31:38] and manifest the word for the season and
[1:31:41] the other couldn't
[1:31:43] right now watch what he goes on to say
[1:31:46] he said he said you understand it did
[1:31:48] not Judas cath Caiaphas prophesy but he
[1:31:51] couldn't stay with the word see
[1:31:54] that's
[1:31:58] right all right that's so who so who's
[1:32:01] he bringing this message to he isn't
[1:32:03] addressing it to the outside world we
[1:32:06] can't talk to the sinner like this
[1:32:08] because he he knows nothing about it see
[1:32:13] now let me just go on here let me finish
[1:32:15] up with this right here but God wants
[1:32:18] fruit now Jesus wants fruit for
[1:32:21] himself I'm going to bring this to these
[1:32:24] things right here together he said now
[1:32:26] Jesus wants fruit for himself his wife
[1:32:29] must bring forth the kind of a child
[1:32:31] that he
[1:32:34] is you see what we're leading up to now
[1:32:36] see watch this if they don't if they if
[1:32:40] it don't bring forth children bride
[1:32:42] children word children then it's a
[1:32:44] denominational
[1:32:46] child then her first love for the is for
[1:32:50] the world and denomination she's gone
[1:32:52] back to that and many of them have that
[1:32:55] claim to believe this
[1:33:00] message now that's now watch he said he
[1:33:04] said she's gone back to that and it
[1:33:07] can't bring forth a real genuine born
[1:33:11] again Christian because there's nothing
[1:33:13] there to bring it
[1:33:15] forth what did the prophet say only the
[1:33:18] elect can be reborn because in non-elect
[1:33:21] there's nothing there to bring it forth
[1:33:25] yeah are you with me now if you
[1:33:28] understand he's speaking to you
[1:33:30] personally when you see this made
[1:33:32] manifest and see you're lining up with
[1:33:34] that word in you you've been
[1:33:37] identified there's no way the devil can
[1:33:39] reach in and take you out of there
[1:33:42] you're sealed
[1:33:43] in you always were in you always were
[1:33:47] his you always were yolked
[1:33:51] amen but the message had to come for you
[1:33:54] to see it to realize it to make it
[1:33:56] manifest it had to be made manifest
[1:33:58] through a bedding
[1:34:02] ground all right
[1:34:06] then and remember we are now as his
[1:34:08] bride pregnated with his Spirit oh my

[1:34:55] evidence of his resurrection this is
[1:34:57] eternal life and vindicates to the world
[1:35:00] that we are alive in him he

[1:37:10] the will of him that sent me amen what
[1:37:13] about you and I
[1:37:17] amen he said the natural Man receiveth 1
[1:37:20] Corinthians 2:14 the natural man
[1:37:22] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:37:24] of God because they're spiritually
[1:37:25] discerned and he cannot know it amen he
[1:37:29] said but verse 15 but he that is
[1:37:33] spiritual
