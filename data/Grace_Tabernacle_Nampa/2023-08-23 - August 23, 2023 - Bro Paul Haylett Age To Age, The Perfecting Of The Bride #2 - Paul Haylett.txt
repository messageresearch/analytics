just say thank you thank you Lord Jesus we bless your Holy Name tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Lovely song service I appreciate that music amen um forgot to put down on the list or remember Sister Joel Lynn not only is she um I say this a little bit joking wondering about her chosen profession back in the classroom with all these kids and whatnot and I think she's a little mentally exhausted plus she kind of has a obligation to further her education so she's having to do night school and those things so please remember her I had not totally put this out to to the Sunday School teachers but I would like to start Sunday school and young adults on Sunday September the 3rd and so uh just like you to keep that in mind amen let's turn in our Bibles um I want to speak to you on age to age the perfecting of the Bride part two amen we didn't make it through all the way uh last Wednesday and uh just would like to continue that but you know there was a little something that brother Stan uh said did you enjoy brother Stan's Ministry I I really just he was there in the home with us and just a lovely time uh it's really sad when you see two old men almost in tears when they left um and um so it wasn't all just brother Stan but you know it was just such a joyous time we were able to just interact talk about the word of God uh share share some Vision you might say and and that so but one thing that brother Stan said that struck me and uh you know I started into speak this um kind of coming and I'm I'm not bashful about giving credit where it's due but rather Vitale uh preaching about building the church and you know uh that night or that I guess that was day whatever I I just really was caught up with the fact that um Revelations 2 and Revelations 3 gives us a very clear view you might say the overall construction blueprint of the church and it really struck me and uh and then coming and coupling with something brother Stan spoke and he was talking about how if you remember he said I started on this series and I was just hurrying to get through this series and he said the Lord spoke to him and said what's your rush and he said then it turned into 60 some uh sermons that come out of that thought and so Saints if you don't mind my rush through the seven Church ages uh would uh turn into a little more of a study or going through the resume of the ages and so I don't know how many of you have the little book or have in that your church age book you can study it out of that so if Lord willing you would maybe the coming Wednesdays would bring your church age book or if you have the resume of the age book separate and and uh we will just stop and and let's just dig in okay because I believe the church age book is is a very beneficial to us it lays it out so clearly and so we can see that in there and and let's just dig through it let's look at what was happening in that day not brushing it off because just to give you a little glimpse of that that as the Lord struck to me as I've started re-reading the resume of the ages is the fact that my brother and sister the word of God had come and was so fresh in the first age but in such a short span of years Satan had already come in and was drawing it away already had added to it and already had started to put in man's ideas and I think it do us good because you see I don't believe amongst real Believers that we ever come to the place that we say oh I'm just tired of hearing this or that but my brother and sister I believe it's it's very important and we can see it through all the ages the emphasis of staying with the word it Satan would just love for us to to to to just pull back just a little bit to soften our stance here to compromise a little there but my brother and sister the anointing of the age of this age on the bride of Christ amen we're going to dismiss all the naysayers and all the negative people the anointing on the bride of Christ is stay with the word amen and as we hear the word preach we should never even if you hear a topic preached over and over again we should never get tired because if we believe God's leadership is guiding the church then someone needs to hear it you say but we've heard that preached someone maybe was yawning at the moment someone had went to the restroom or stepped out or whatever it might be and hey we want to make it amen that's our that's our goal that's our heart's desire to make it amen so we don't want to miss any instruction it reminds me one time as we went and uh was on a little holiday and there was kind of a little uh video deal on the screen and the man stood in the front and said now there'll be people waiting this was at the science deal in in Arizona he says now there's going to be people waiting behind that door you cannot exit that door now did you hear me you cannot exit that door when the little film thing was over half of the crowd went down to push their way out that door and so we realized just in the realm of humanity that when we were listening we're not always hearing amen Hallelujah first Peter hi amen sorry about that brother Gideon I probably just confused you all because I told them pick up where I left off but uh that's fine Brother Gideon they can it's a short scripture amen first Peter 2 5 ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house so this is God's intent to us Saints is to build up a spiritual house not a 5 000 square foot mansion with a four or five car garage amen a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ now we'll drop down a little bit into the second chapter verses 9 and 10. same ones that we read the other day and want to just reiterate this Foundation but ye are a chosen generation Can someone say Amen to that and we are a royal priesthood and a holy nation of peculiar people that ye should sow forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light now this is not just like my brother and sister this is Marvelous Light amen don't let Satan ever diminish this and and come to the place that we say well I follow the message I believe the message I I'm pretty sure the message is truth my brother and sister God called you now if God made a promise to you as it is in Malachi 4 5 behold I send you you know I've made this emphasis many times want to make it again behold I send you God is not speaking my brother and sister to the Elders of the church or to the hierarchy here or to those there he's speaking to you and I a very personal statement that he made and so as we'll look at this right here we'll realize that God has come and reiterated this personal statement amen that ye should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you well we got to be identified I know there's jokes out there if you're a sheep you're you but my brother and sister you've got to identify yourself in the word the prophet of God said so find yourself in the word amen how important that is he's called you out of Darkness into his marvelous life which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy Lord we ask you for your blessing upon the word tonight in your name amen you may be seated Saints now I would like you to turn in your Bibles to Revelations the third chapter and we'll start with the first verse now as we are looking at this we have we went through the other Church ages there in the second chapter on last Wednesday evening and we're just catching these few little portions and I'm I'm really happy because I felt a little uh I don't know a little sad to jump through this so quickly but then just those as I shared with you brother Stan saying that it struck me I thought what is my Rush amen so you look at this now Revelations 3 1 and unto the angel of church and Sardis right these things saith he the hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou has a name that thou livest and art dead he that overcometh verse 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels amen as well look at this my brother and sister there's nothing like having a church and I'm going to speak direct if you all don't mind there's nothing like having a church that declares that they have life but when you go in and you sit down in those Services you sit down in that that there there's no presence there's no life there and we're not going to throw stones outside here but we'll pray that it's not in our midst that we're talking we'll pray that it's not in our our faith but my brother and sister I've had family Through The Years in different denominations and had occasion to go to church with them and you know when you go into a a service and the only response the preacher gets is when he tells a good joke amen you realize that when they read the scripture very few people even open their Bibles and very few people even enter into this and you realize while they profess to be the Church of the Living God that basically they're more excited when the church posts its summer baseball league on the board amen then they get excited about what is happening or the church fantasy football amen would any of you be interested in joining a fantasy football group my brother and sister are no place in the house of God should such things be it shouldn't even be named as it were in the house of God but that's what it takes to put life in the church amen because in the preaching of the word now I don't know you know and I don't necessarily encourage you to do it but you know there's certain things that every once in a while I Glimpse at to just kind of see where it's going right because the prophet of God showed us or told us that uh when they start to seek the oil my brother and sister that the coming of the Lord is nigh upon us and you know you just kind of keep looking at that wondering what is this and my brother and sister there is some of these uh churches that that are preaching now I'll just share my opinion for what it's worth all two cents of it amen and I give rebate for nickels so you see where this value is at it's there my brother and sister I assure you and they're very verbiage they use that they're reading the message of the hour or they're that close in their seeking of the oil it's right there and so we see how that this is coming either way they are searching and you'll see ministers preaching to their churches and they are preaching a sermon my brother and sister you might question my judgment on this but they're preaching sermons that could be preached in this church and we would say Amen to it but there's no life in it it's Hollow it's empty all the nutrients you might say have been drawn from it and so they're quoting the scripture and speaking the thought but it's not changing the people and I tell you wherever this gospel is preached in the anointing of the Holy Ghost it changes lives you cannot sit under the preaching of the word that is Anointed by God and it not change our life amen and so it's there that we realize that what is coming in our day that that there's a time these Spirits lingering and coming forth as the prophet taught us that every Spirit of every age didn't go away because it was only to that age but it's now compounded with the spirits of the previous age and coming and that's why laodicea is such a mess is because we now have a compound of seven spirits amen talking in the negative seven spirits compounded together against the bride of Christ but look at this bride she's got Seven Ages worth of the anointing of the Holy Ghost than has been poured out on her that everything Satan's been able to do for seven Church ages the bride has an answer for that amen and I thank God for that hallelujah amen because this bride is going to have a name that she lives amen not a name that she lived in is dead but she's got a name that she lives amen and so it's there he says you know what to those that overcome they shall be clothed in white raiment you know I just love I just love that little picture you know that shows a little bride and she's all clothed in that gown of the word now you know I I love that picture because that's literally what is happening in our lives is that we are becoming the word and the word is becoming us we are so clothed in the word if you follow me that you can't see anything else now don't look at your flesh right we heard brother Vitale we heard brother Stan preach just very connected sermons my brother and sister it's not what we see in ourselves but it's what God sees in US amen because if we saw in ourselves I'd probably just get discouraged and quit because I don't see a guy that's got his act together I don't see a guy that's special but the word shows us that we are the word declares we are and God says I'm looking through the lens of my own blood through my own word at you and all I see is a bride coming to maturity amen I thank God for that I thank God for a timely preaching of the word amen so it's there he's saying you know to those that overcome I'm going to close them in that white raim it and I'm I'm telling you my brother and sister if you just get over yourself okay let's get over ourselves tonight when Satan comes like the flood we react in a human element we are react in humanity they said this did they mean it to me how did they mean that did I take it like they meant it did I hear like they meant it or is there misunderstanding and we'll go into a great battle about what this is and if we're not careful we'll convince ourselves we're offended but what happens I'm not making a point about that what happens right behind that initial influence of the spirit of the age the word comes right in and we start to say no that's not what it is that's my brother that's my sister this is the word Satan's trying to trying to break our fellowship like it was broken in the garden it's not about who's writing the word and who's wrong my brother and sister we need to take that whole thought that used to be so prominent people would say well you know praise God I would rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my Doctrine than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my spirit but my brother and sister are what we got to do is get out of our carnal thinking and know that God has sent the pure word to us amen it's not going to be about what the doctrine is if you're the bride of Christ you'll have the right Doctrine and what Satan's trying to do he's trying to stir it all up that we're trying to find our own footing but God says I will give you your footing you come unto me draw nigh to me I'll position you where you need to be and it's not going to be on sin it's not going to be out here at the landfill it's not going to be in laodicea I'm going to put you on the rock of my word and there you're going to be buffeted but you won't fall you won't be washed away you won't collapse you won't be taken my brother and sister because what happens is we will have the word come back not from the preacher well it might come from the preacher it might come from the prophet's voice but my brother and sister what God's really intending is the word that's already in you is going to rise up I was offended yesterday but now the word has rose up and I realize oh God but for your grace and we forgive and we reconcile and we move into our proper position it's not God running out with a Craftsman building a wall around you to keep you safe but it's a word that's already in you it's a word in you and you say but why didn't it rise up immediately because we are human and God wants to stir up our Pure Minds and in the stirring of our minds we can come back and that's why a Christian will repent if he's offended or that's why a Christian will always come back to the word of God because God says hey I'm now raising up the standard that's already in you we don't need to get out on the horizon and start looking for this standard this this Fortress this buttress that God is going to give my brother and sister look in Christ is here amen the Apostle Paul declared it amen quite strongly Hallelujah were we going to find Christ my brother and sister huh it's been taught around the whole world you've got to run down talk to the priests got to talk to the preacher got to go here what did he say he said it's in you amen that's where your hope of glory is at it's in you oh sounds like we're into some new age thing here oh it's in me it's in me it's all about me well I'm telling you my brother and sister the New Age spirit is just Satan's Twist on the truth amen that our Redemption is in US are you with me because if Christ is in us our Redemption is in US amen and if Christ is not in us we got serious problems we got really serious problems we don't need to argue over verbiage if we the Christ is not in me my brother and sister I'm stunned you could knock me to the ground with a feather how many people in the last couple years that I've run into that are there like no no he's not in me we're waiting for him to come well I'm telling you my brother and sister I'm sitting here in Grace Tabernacle and I will testify with my life he is here he is here tonight because you come in the house of God hungry with a desire Lord I'm hungry and I want to be fed and he made the promise I'll be with you even in you so where does this come from oh it's my pastor it's my pastor's doing it he's he's the reason I'm an overcomer you're backslid amen you're not your pastor it's Christ in you and the word is just stirring up what is already been placed in you Hallelujah you know sometimes we don't even realize what we like sorry to throw sister Jerry under the bus but tonight she made some kind of whatever you would call that and she told me you know this is what it is and it's going to be on a bed of mushrooms and I don't trust her anymore because somewhere in there cauliflower is hidden but when we're all done eating I had to look over and say honey that was really really good really really good and we come to the house of God sometimes we don't like what God decides to serve up to us but if we just sit down and say Lord I came hungry and I want to be fed and if this is what you have for me then Lord I'm just going to sit down and both elbows on the table it's not legitimate kids don't eat that way it looks like you're a Savage but I tell you know a Hungry Man when he sits down to the table got an elbow on the table and his head down and just starts putting the food in you see what God's doing he's feeding us what we need there's the standard raised in laodicea he's feeding us what we need because if it was what we wanted let's talk about that fancy fantasy football league we're going to never start you see my brother and sister Humanity let's let's face it let's face it Humanity likes those who will tickle their ears they're attracted to the ticklers hmm remember brother Jason you know a lot of our little kids you'd hear them over there don't tickle me don't tickle me as they stand there right next to him don't tickle me don't tickle me that's really the world we live in yeah oh just give us the word preacher tickle me make me happy you know I used to think the phrase preach me happy was a good phrase but I don't like it anymore because my brother and sister it's a phrase that can be so easily misconstrued because some people will be like preach me happy and they want to be able to walk out of church I feel so good well I tell you what makes you feel good my brother and sister is when you take the spiritual vitamin of the word and you are there and it's what happens tomorrow and the next day and the next day and as you look in the word and the prophet of God says the token is no longer the blood amen my brother and sister it's kind of startling when you look at that it's no longer the blood it's the life amen so we can have the blood people people repent and they get baptized and they move forward but if it's not the real life amen there's nothing there they can call on the token all they want and say we've applied the token we've applied the token my brother and sister that's to say I'm I'm getting off track but that's to say I've got the message on the mantle but what God wants is not on the mantle he wants it on our hearts he wants it in our life he wants it being manifested and then we can stand and say when my house is in order when my life is in order when everything is in order then God is obligated but not because I believe the message but because I'm living the word the life is in me it's in you and it's coming out Hallelujah let me get back on track here amen you see as you look at this he says he won't blot our name out of The Book of Life and so that's wonderful aren't you happy that he's not going to blot your name out of the book of life amen but you see it's not just the book my brother and sister because the bride of Christ is written on the palms of his hands we in other words are identified directly in him this is not just hey you can find my name where are we going to find you in Christ not just a name on a book I'm glad my name's on the book and I say thank you Lord that my name's on the book but you see I want to be identified in Christ Hallelujah I don't know if that made sense or not amen so he says then you know that I'm going to uh I'm going to declare you before my father I'm going to confess your name before my father before his angels you know there's nothing like I just remember years ago be careful young ladies when young boys start to pay attention you be careful the words that you use many years ago I started well I think the day I first met her I was very attracted to Sister Jerry and anyway my point being is one she said she'd never marry me amen be careful what you say young ladies God does have a sense of humor and that kid that you say he's a geek a dork and all those other words that are not legal to say in this day and age you might come back and haunt you I just as a friend share that with you but you see there was a special day in my life when I was before friends then I uttered Jerry's name you might say possessive for the first time the first household I ever took sister Jerry 2 was brother Dan and sister Sue's house I probably fell asleep and sister Sue visited with Jerry later told me good choice Paul but you see it starts with the confession I had to confess I believe this girl is the girl and you say but what's that got to do with God the devil needs reminded come on Saints the devil needs reminded and God is confessing us amen Before the Throne before the angel he's confessing us it's not a one-sided relationship I Love You Lord if we could hear the Heavenly Anthem we would hear God saying I love and you put your name in there I love them I have redeemed them they are my bride they are my possession and it's being spoken but we are caught in a Earthly realm and the voice is being projected as it were in a spiritual realm a Heavenly realm but I'm telling you how God's expression of his words his confession is is that there's something comes down and touches you and I in the preaching and the ministry of the word it touches us and we just say oh God's moving upon my spirit my brother and sister in a realm that we cannot recognize you are hearing that Heavenly voice declare your name and it's coming down through the heavens and you're responding to it but we're still caught in an Earthly real film that we don't realize that's the very voice of God that's wooing you oh it's not the preacher it's not the special singer that's God's voice wooing you and I into his presence oh thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah amen I just I love that amen Sardis had something really going for it but just all of these Church ages my brother and sister will recognize that there was a great move of God and then something started cooling off something started to change and as we go through the resume of the ages we'll look into that little closer but my brother and sister you can have the volcano but it can't stay red hot forever amen so it's there that once the lava comes out flows down the mountain pretty soon it gets hard and you look at the church ages and you'll see the same thing the church hot amen it flows out covers goes moves it's on fire and give it time and it becomes so solidified that even the moving of the holy spirit in its midst can't put heat that's right back in it oh think about it that's why God's going to stir his church and keep it on fire we might get a little cool sometimes but God is just going to pour a little bit more out on us amen keep us head up aren't you glad aren't you glad Hallelujah now let's go into the age of Philadelphia here Revelation 3 7. and uh so to the to the angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth now we jump to verse 12. he said him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name amen now as we look at this my brother and sister we'll we I have quite a bit I'd like to expound on this but I want to just go into the Philadelphian Church age uh to just to read to you starting with paragraph 244. amen and and just really take this from from the position the prophet lays out before us he said oh let's just take it word by word for just a moment will you bear with me that long just a little bit I know it's hot you know it's hot up here too but let's see I'll make he that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God pillar a pillar or a foundation a foundation in the temple of the house the house of God the Temple of my God or the house of my God it's a pillar the foundation these are those that took the word which they heard verse 8 and went back to the foundation you see how important this is prophets laying this out we didn't start a new religion people are like well I don't know why people are so enthralled with this William Branham about everything that he's ever preached has already been preached does it say anywhere in the word that it was a new revelation it was a correct Revelation it was coming back to build the foundation because my brother and sister remember the spirits of the ages coming forward there had to be the foundation laid in Philadelphia that God could build on now Philadelphia has a lot of different titles but it was definitely the age of knowledge the age of wisdom age of man progressing and we see that in the natural that it probably was as great of time for change has ever been upon the face of the Earth although now it's pretty stunning have to admit it's pretty stunning so a lap over of that Spirit has come here I mean I remember brother Prashant God bless you brother person he got right down at Paul's level I said what are you working on right now he looks at me okay brother Paul let me just put it like this I'm writing a book on a grain of sand I don't think you'll understand it any deeper than that I think you're right brother Prashant because um yeah that's pretty small and I tend to kind of write kind of big so yeah okay good God bless you brother you know but he said brother Paul where I don't know how they how that's come for them but he said what you might recognize is a microchip we're going to shrink it to maybe a quarter of that size wow you imagine the memory that's in your phone I've been blessed to have my library at the house could have been a spare bedroom but we felt like the company would be insulted if we opened the door shoved them in pulled the doors up behind them God bless you have a good evening but we filled it full of books got most of the message in book form imagine taking all of that and putting it on a grain of sand hard to fathom this little boy can't fathom that what's God doing now he's taking this word and he's building a foundation amen Let's see we went to my was it nephew second nephew went to a birthday party last night we'll keep it that simple and uh great Mel's friend Sage was talking about how you get underneath the house how you maybe put a basement in or how you do this he was mentioning you know it's kind of like interesting how do you take a house and just put a basement under it well he's just explaining the process you realize that the church indoctrinated anchored down and God come along and says you know in the Philadelphia age we can't go any further the Overcomer of this age I'm going to make a pillar in my temple but I've got to have a foundation under this pillar so God come back through the word and excavated all of the faults out my brother and sister and dug down there and built this Foundation that a church could be built upon that God would say that's my temple that's my house that's my dwelling place and that's why people who are approaching in a denominational intellectual mindset to the message don't even understand why God needs to send a prophet how men look at you and say why would God even need to send a prophet the Bible's been around all this time because your foundation's no good your foundation will not support the word of God or the word of God won't support your theory amen so it's there the foundation of the temple the house or House of God Amen these are those that took the word that they heard and went back to the foundation look what brother branham's standing my brother and sister goes beyond the curtain of time and he's standing there and as it's all coming to pass he's saying are these branhams no these are your converts and so who are all these well Apostle Paul and what's he doing he's declaring everything's going to be okay because we've went back to the foundation and we've built upon that foundation so I'm secure and then there's a bride that says we're counting on that amen and I stand here tonight and tell you I'm counting on that because I look I'm kind of kind of pragmatic I'm kind of analytical I'm kind of a skeptic in a sense and I look over here and I don't see anything that's going to do it I look over here I don't see anything that's going to do it I'll look over here I don't see anything to do it but that's not why I believe the message my brother and sister I believe the message because I've heard a voice that was wooing me into the word and when I got into the word I realized that we have been given the foundation amen the pillar the foundation amen let's I'm just getting excited excuse me went back to the foundation now let's get Ephesians 2 19 over the Church of Ephesus you know you have to go back to Ephesus that was the beginning is is the right all right let's go back to Ephesus where Paul was the church that he established and let's see now where we're at all right the Church of Ephesus let's go back now and see what this Foundation is back there what the prophet do he didn't say let's go back to Philadelphia right because he shows us clearly in the church ages that in every age there were those who lived all the Revelation they had for their day so if he'd taken us back to Philadelphia or Sardis or Ephesian Ephesus my brother and sister we we say well we're living all the word but you see we're living in a day of the Fulfillment of perfection of the finale my brother and sister and so it's got to all be put into place and it has to be built on the right foundation look they have that big building is it Los Angeles or San Francisco or what my brother and sister they're destroying half the city around them trying to save one building and the thing just keeps on leaning I think it's a perfect spiritual type they built it when they originally built it they said this building is a proof as it slowly loses this equilibrium and falls down without even the influence of an earthquake they might be right it might be earthquake proof but it's not uh it's not secure amen I'll get distracted excuse me but look God God's not going to let them their bows stand God's not going to let this world Satan's bow stand amen so it's there I got yeah okay calm down Paul now he's talking to the Ephesians now therefore you have no more strangers or foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of Lutheran or a Baptist no wait I got mixed up didn't die oh but are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone everything went in at the door Jesus amen and he that overcometh will I make him a pillar in other words part of the foundation what will I give him I'll put him in the doctrine of the Apostles and prophets from the beginning and give him the revelation Hallelujah isn't that beautiful and that we don't need to be identified as some big giant pillar all shiny and carved out of marble or whatever but we have come back to the very Foundation or revelation of the word that Paul was preaching in that day and very few understood because God hid in Paul's message so much it took the ages to reveal it it took ages to unfold the real depth of what he was preaching but the word says then this day all the Mysteries will be finished aren't you glad amen God says I'm not going to go further and keep hiding this I'm going to reveal it but it's going to be as as the scripture says a select group the prophet of God very much defines it as a select group it really sounds like we're egotistical and arrogant but my brother and sister what the truth of it is is we are seeing age to age God building and perfecting his church and we are here now with that knowledge we're here with that understanding so as we look at this amen let me keep going on I just thought oh I can finish this easy tonight but not Paul amen now as well look at this my brother and sister we recognize that um as this is coming forth the age of Philadelphia one of the greatest expanse of the Gospel around the globe man had the printing press man had developed a audio recording all of these things it was there now my brother and sister visiting with brother Stan he recounted some of the Early times of him growing up around the message in the message and he said you know one thing that he learned as a young man that you can be sitting there listening to a service over a telephone wire and he said that there are those old believers they had a bunch in their church that I think they're all but one gone now and and these old Believers would witness they would declare to you these things and he had a brother in the church and he asked him he says why don't you come to church he says oh I I listen to all the services brother but he says you know brother he said um it's not the same and I know that there are those maybe even listening to this service tonight but you see it's just not the same and we have witnesses of a prophet's message and the atmosphere that was in those churches and auditoriums when the prophet was there no Holy Ghost was moving and I could tell you my brother and sister about some of my own experiences of of how God has dealt with me and in dealing with me was dealing with others and what I experienced at the time knowing that God was there and going to work but if I just tell you about that it won't move you like it did when it happened now gives my thoughts a testimony I love sister Sarah's mom and dad sitting in a service I don't remember now all the exact details but within a few rows of the front right there had some questions and it's just not real clear on the tape but brother Branham coming right over in their area looking down upon them tells them it's going to be all right it's going to that's whatever they were thinking they had some doubts or question marks and he he speaks to them now my brother and sister I've sat right at a table in the restaurant and they've shared that with me but it didn't move me I acknowledge it and I'm excited but what did it do for them their own testimony it took all those doubts away removed every question mark there was and they could move forward you see we can't live on a second hand so we can talk about everything of the previous Church ages coming right up to Philadelphia right on the doorstep of our age and we can talk about the supernatural manifestation and how God moved and what God did and what was happening in that day my brother and sister I'm I don't remember the man's name now but there was a a man who was a riding a circuit preacher in Eastern New England many many years ago and he's riding at night so he would be at a church on a Sunday morning and he's riding in his horse steps in a hole and breaks its leg and he's there and he's thinking man what am I going to do it's too far to walk I'm not going to make it to the service Lord I told them I would be there got down on his knees laid his hands on the horse's leg and said Lord you know you are ordained this Beast to carry me got up got the horse up got on him and rode my brother and sister today we got a snotty nose and we can't make it to the house of God I've done that Lord forgive us amen I'm not throwing a stone at no one but you see the difference is that we're living in a shadow and they were living in the presence I don't want to live in the shadow I want to live in the presence I don't want to shadow in our church I want the presence in our church I want the power of God in this building I want the power of God in our lives amen and I'm not preaching down to anybody I'm just telling you that's the difference that's coming the age because we can sit here tonight and talk about all the supernatural that happened in brother branham's Ministry but we should be able here tonight talk about the supernatural that's happening in our ministry oh wait my wife has a Ministry you better believe she's got a Ministry our children have a Ministry we Brothers have a Ministry my brother and sister and we should be able tonight to recount what the Supernatural is moving in our presence we don't need to say brother so-and-so's church over here and brother so-and-so's church over here has got a supernatural move in its midst we should be able to say God is in Grace Tabernacle moving and changing and delivering and opening the word it should be that alive to us yeah Hallelujah I don't want to live in another age I want to live in this age I don't want to live under the witness of a anointing of a spirit of another day I want to live under the witness of the anointing of that Spirit here today in my life now I'm sorry I'm getting excited Hallelujah Hallelujah oh my you know I like some of these quotes because like brother Brown was starting that quote there let's take a word by word for just a moment will you bear with me amen so you know if I ask you to bear with me just remember I'm just quoting the prophet yeah I hope you don't mind the humor now as we look at this coming right down to our day Revelations 3. 14. and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now my brother and sister this is none other than our Lord Jesus Christ that's commissioning this because all things were made for him and by him by him and for him amen so you look at that that there it is the very essence this is the word from the foundation actually before the foundation because at the foundation time God was already speaking to lay the foundation are you with me it could be about a four-hour sermon if we tied that Foundation back to the foundation we just talked about because my brother and sister I'll just if I can just bring it very brief I want to ask you a question you might think it's rhetorical you might think it's ridiculous that I would ask you but I want to ask you and you need to answer if you would please humor me and answer it to yourself were you in Christ before the foundation of the world that should just settle where this word come from this should just settle it to us of where we fit in the plan of God but brother Paul I make mistakes it doesn't say before you made mistakes or after you made mistakes those are things we quantify those are things that Satan magnifies but God wants to identify you were in me before the foundation of the world and if you're in me then you are of me you know they have proven isn't it amazing you know some of these whodunit type things you know there was a mystery of something somebody you know assaulted or killed somebody and in the old days they just kind of had to go around and try and figure out oh here's a boot print and here's this and here's that but look at what's happening my brother and sister and you'll find that all of Nature and all of mankind and all knowledge has a foundation back in the word that has a mirror image of it coming out and now my brother and sister they can take even the slightest bit of your saliva and identify Who You Are not only that they can tie you to your daddy Hallelujah can I dance and get a little excited tonight everything the devil told me turned out to be a lie because they took just one little snippet of this no good piece of Flesh and proved who I belong to amen it isn't what the devil said it isn't what they said it wasn't what the church said because if you go back in the foundation of my family I would have to tell you tonight that I'm a Latter-Day Saint thank you brother David Hallelujah or as brother Stan shared a joke with me about this guy everybody knows this guy and they took him to the hardware store the banks and they went to the mayor and they went to the governor and they went to everywhere and the guy says I'll tell you what I'll go to one place where they won't know you and so they go to the Vatican and the guy goes in there and here this guy comes out old Charlie comes out on the balcony he's standing there with the Pope and he turns to the guy and says hey hey you know them he said well I know Charlie but I don't know that other guy my brother and sister that's how God's looking down he knows who we are there's no way that we can camouflage or be done and Satan can do he knows who we are and so what is he doing here to this he's taking us right back to the very beginning that is the foundation look how this ties together so beautifully this is the foundation the beginning amen so these these ages and these words tying together they're not individual thoughts of the age but if we was and I just want to make this point to you if we was in in a smarter way than Paul can do it just remove the Clutter as it were but it's the word of God so it's not clutter but if you know what I mean and we could remove all of that you could build a phrase as it were of the Overcomer of every age and it has cohesion it has continuity it makes sense God building the church from the beginning oh I tell you I just love that the other night reading that my brother and sister God allowed you and I to go behind the veil that was rent he allowed us didn't strike us dead that was Through the Ages those old prophets and all those priests they had to be as it were so totally prepared and so careful but we as Sons and Daughters of God not careless but sons of daughters of God we can go behind that Veil and we can reach into that Golden Pond and we can pull the Manna of the word out and we we can eat that word in this hour and God says I'll bless you for coming and reaching into the pond and taking this word and I bless you for eating the word and believing and confessing it and for them it was death but for you and I it's life Oh look The continuity I'm not going to repreach this tonight but look at this it comes right down through here and everything tied together shows us that God was actually building a church he was building a people then in the worst of times in an age where lies become truth and truth becomes lies and darkness is settled upon the land my brother and sister if you want the natural now we can't go back there but if you would want the natural example that I believe would be closest to the day we live in is when darkness settled everywhere but Goshen they were all in darkness and they couldn't explain why there was light in Goshen now I've heard some brothers say that God veiled their eyes and they actually didn't see the light that was in Goshen I hadn't really thought that through but in a sense it would make sense but I believe they see the light because they see you they see your life so there's Darkness here but there's light walking in their midst isn't it interesting how people come up with all kinds of theorems on the word I never I walk out that door right there but when I stop and say Lord let me only preach truth all I want to ever preach is truth Lord I don't want to be the guy that starts some new revelation that swept through the message I'm just fine with the tried and the true I'm just fine my brother and sister yeah Amen to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me now look at this we've progressed from going behind the veil and getting Manna out of the pot and now we've moved up here and we become the very Foundation the pillar but look what God's doing everything is moving us closer and closer and closer to him now I say it's wonderful to be a pillar in the house of God but I'll tell you what I gotta move and you got to move beyond the pillar status and we get to sit with him in his throne the prophet of God elaborates this not on the throne my brother and sister it's not on the throne we are in Christ amen not on the throne hey we've got the revelation of God you know we can no my brother and sister he's drawing us into himself oh Hallelujah now look here and how can I overcome I don't know if any of you have listened to this sermon lately but how can I overcome is Scott just a ton of nuggets in it Amen brother Chris and I was just discussing something along that line the other day and I would say brother Chris that that was inspired but I already had these notes amen but look at this did you notice the arrangements of that see set with me in my Throne not on my throne in my Throne that's in his domain see and there as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God so will the church be with him did you catch that in the complete domain not me or you sitting in church going whoa unto me I just keep failing I don't know if I can do this can I really be a Christian the devil's like of course you're not of course you're not you have identity crisis just like the girl with the purple hair and the guy who don't know what he is identity crisis but believe the word and the word really is all that I care for and then we wake up God Opening Our Eyes one more time and we realized it never was me that's right I could not make it to the throne room I could not go and say I believe I'll just sit down here by my Lord and everything will be all right what did he do he drew us right into himself now if we was to look in the mirror tonight it's actually interesting exercise they do this in a lot of different Realms I won't go into that but you know one of these exercises in a self-identity class that sounds strange doesn't it self-identity class because I I want to know who I am so I actually believe in self-identity yeah see I already mentioned it earlier in the service see you have to see yourself in the word so we really this sounds like psychology and forgive me but you have to have a self-identity because if you don't identify in this age if you don't identify in Christ you will identify in something else you're not going to just stand here void of an identity and so in these self-identity classes they have these people come up in front of the group I mean isn't that what you would always like to do hi I'm Paul I'm here because I have problems stand in front of the mirror and tell all the rest of us what you see well there's a story that goes with that this guy's been a drunk alcoholic all that you name the whole stuff he goes to one of those classes mandated by the court and he's standing there and he'd caught such a revelation of who he was in Jesus Christ they said now tell us what you see he stands right there for the longest time they're like okay go ahead speak said okay but I don't think you're gonna like it oh we can handle anything I see a redeemed Son of God you're delusional what do you see in the mirror tonight Hallelujah I don't see Paul heylett the son of David and Geraldine Halen I see a Son of God Amen I see myself not sitting on a throne sitting on the side saying oh I made it I just crawled into heaven I used to believe that saint that I used to confess that when when I was making my transition back to serve God I would even tell sister Jerry if I can just crawl and drag myself over the threshold of Heaven but ask me how I feel about that now I'm not going to drag myself over the threshold of Heaven I am going to walk in and they're going to say who are you and I'm going to say my name is Mrs Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's the perfect type of that she didn't stand there and say I hope he doesn't banish me no sir she knew he wouldn't banish her because she knew she was his wife and he was her husband she had no fear hey Hallelujah my I was asking brother Alex if he had maybe help me rewrite a song Amen and uh first thing he did is correct me I'd been singing it wrong all day long in the tractor but I like my version of the song and I might I might see if I can't you know turn it to a song and maybe teach it to you so you can all sing it wrong amen what is it the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride be with him in his throne in the entire domain scene not on my throne but in my Throne seat where his domain reaches a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches just as far as its boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity now I want to ask you what has God given you authority over Hallelujah I'm just trying to get authority over my wild children I'm just trying to get authority over my relationship with my husband I'm trying to get authority over my temper I'm trying why don't you set your sights a little higher and realize when you realize you've got authority over eternity to Eternity the rest of these things we've placed so much value on you're trying to take my identity from me I sure am and so is the Lord because he's given us a much greater identity Hallelujah so we could see and this is from eternity eternity let me finish I don't even know what time it is oh my oh my I shall get over saying this won't be very long amen see modern events made clear by prophecy just pulling this out paragraph 177 the believer can see the word made Flash the others cannot do it Hallelujah now let me remind you of I am interpreting the prophet's quote there let me get the mirror out let me get the mirror out the believer can see Christ amen see God see our lord Jesus made flesh and you're going to say but that's me in the mirror yeah that's right that's right Hallelujah oh my some people think it's going to be brother branham's image looking back at him oh my goodness so let me close this out Through the Ages Every Revelation every portion is relevant to the next and to the previous and I say the previous my brother and sister because the prophets and sages of old those faithful Godly men are looking and saying Lord if they don't want to be there I'll gladly I'll gladly take their position and there's a spirit in the land well if we could just go back and just live in those days my brother and sister when we do the resume at the ages you'll see the spiritual the the religious spirits of that day we're so strong and so convincing that if you think you would go back there because it would be easy you would find that you'd say Lord send me back to laodicea where I have all the word opened to me where I can identify I'm not trying to figure out who is this Man From Galilee this Nazarene who is this we've got open word amen amen the devil's clearly marked Hallelujah oh my come sister so I can stop preaching amen let's just take a very quick summary can we have a like a couple more minutes I'd like to brother Stan's deal I like that can I have just a little bit more maybe just an hour okay let's take this little quick summary First Age we get to eat of the Tree of Life That's Christ himself second age we're free of the second deaths free of spiritual death I really am lacking the hidden Manna amen because between the lines lies the revelation of God if it wasn't between the lines my brother and sister the word says that he had to hide it lest they would see and he'd have to heal them that heel is talking about restoring so we look at that power of the Nations this ties directly amen of us having power over the atmosphere where we live right here this is not you and I going over to the U.N and walking in there and this is power over our world here amen white Raymond clothed in the word Christ himself confessing our name you know there's always a little name dropping ghost in life business have somebody call you if I call me today oh yeah well now so and so okay I'm thinking what's that got to do with it I want to sell your farm my farm is not for sale well when you decide to sell your farm I'd like to sell your farm for I'll have forgotten who you are by then [Music] but you see what they're trying to do is they're trying to find a way to relate to you and let me put it this way my brother and sister the devil is working really hard to find a way to relate to you and Christ is here saying I can relate to you bring all your heavy burdens bring all the pain bring all the sorrow bring all the disappointment I can relate Hallelujah Hallelujah I'd like to elaborate on that but I've kept you too long then we see becoming a pillar the word having to go back to the foundation amen so that God could build a rapture in you come on that's what he's doing Saints God's Building the Rapture In You and I people are like I'm waiting for the Rapture if you're not in the Rapture right now my brother and sister you're not going to be in that Rapture amen this catching away catching away from the spirit of laodicea and all the spirits of Ages gone by and catching us away from ourself we can be sitting here saying oh praise God I've got free from the spirit of laodicea but if we're not free from ourself we're not really free from the spirit of laodicea amen so God's coming and he's bringing us and delivering us from this amen and then we get to sit with Christ in his throne for a guy that for a few minutes today had a real strong mental struggle um no those won't be appropriate words useful [Music] it's hard for us to see sometimes that we're sitting in domain Authority [Music] it's hard for us to grasp as a song says some Midnight Hour if you should find they don't have to be midnight it can be noon it can be nine in the morning and be three in the afternoon but some mine some Midnight Hour if you should find you're in a prison in your mind amen you don't need bars around you if your mind's in a prison my brother and sister you don't need no other bars around you but what is this domain Authority say brother Paul domain Authority that's where you stop and say Lord you know who I am you know my heart [Music] live I rebuke you in the name of Jesus and the rest of your day as though that never happened why Mind Over Matter if it's God's mind it's definitely over the matter but not our mind over the matter no that Sons and Daughters of God that have a revel and I have domain Authority amen God's over everything and I'm in God and God's in me hallelujah hallelujah I I really thought this wouldn't take this long I I yeah yeah oh my Hallelujah amen all is well thank you brother David amen Higher Ground let's sing that song I'm so glad 5 43 brother Gideon I sure appreciate brother Gideon labor and for us there Hallelujah aren't you glad that we can sing this tonight I'm pressing on hey man I'm not stalled out I've not fallen down I've not given up I am pressing on Hallelujah resting on your way hey every day [Music] Lord Lift Me Up all lift me up and let me stand by faith on him mean that I have found Lord plant my feet on higher grounds my heart has no desire to stay where doubts arise and fears dismissed [Music] my prayer my aim is higher ground Lord Lift Me Up and let me stand there by faith on Heaven a higher plane that I have found Lord plant my feet on higher ground I want to live above the world no Satan's darts at me or heard for Faith was gone other joyful sound of the song of Saints on Higher Ground Hallelujah [Music] plant my feet on higher ground I want to scale the utmost [Music] but still I'll
