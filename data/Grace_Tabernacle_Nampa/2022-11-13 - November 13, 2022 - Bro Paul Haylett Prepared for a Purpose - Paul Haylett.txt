You Are so faithful to me [Music] yes I love you because [Music] amen isn't wonderful we can say Amen to that amen I just want to make this a little announcement before I I forget I've pondered this prayed about it and I believe just for the sake of timing the efforts that are involved with Thanksgiving that we will not have a Wednesday night service directly proceeding Thanksgiving uh you know through the years it's it's always been just very hard for me to cancel a service I I just it's a long story some of you know it but it just kind of goes against the grain but just uh realizing all the preparations and things that would be will we will cancel Wednesday and we'll meet again the coming Sunday after Thanksgiving of which um our brother David uh we'll be ministering this Sunday after Thanksgiving so we have a little schedule there that will come out I have something I just want to share very quickly I thought about reading the whole thing to you but sister Andrea sent me uh um an email today and um just a lovely lovely email you know we shared the other day how God was touching those cancer markers and decreasing all of that and and it's continuing amen God is still just doing a mighty work in her body and she just asked me to thank you as a church for praying for her for remembering her and and let's be faithful in that to just continue uh to remember our sister Andrea you know um the devil would just love but remember as we spoke the other day he comes as a roaring lion we've got our own lion we don't need him and um you know the word's been spoken Christ is our healer amen we don't have to look or trust to anything else we can trust to him and so she just sends her greetings and her thank yous and we just want to continue to send our prayers up on her behalf and all of the sisters that we had been praying for that have these issues thank you so much and I don't want to embarrass her but um it's just really awesome to see our our sister vika God's given her a great gift consider blessed to receive that let's turn in our Bibles I want to speak to you again on the the title or general thought of the war within and the war without and uh you know this all comes directly um as inspiration that comes there's actually several sermons that brother Brown preaches along the same line but the greatest battle ever fought uh just comes right in there and uh we're we're seeing we're seeing that actually coming to pass right now and and I'll get into it if the Lord leads into the service a little further but truly the greatest bottle ever fought is not entirely confined to the spiritual world and so it is there that the age that we live in is a bombarding of spirits uh it is uh all all of the advertisements all of these kind of things are all designed to to catch your attention to catch something in that now those of you that might have focused this years ago uh you know they proved that in this Cinema when they were playing the the Prelude or whatever you call it to the show there would be images that were too fast for the mind or the eye to actually catch it but they were projecting images of candy bars and pop and popcorn and whatever and people always like I don't know why when I get you know they go to the theater then I just get this urge to that but it was this subliminal message that was being sent out and while the eye would catch it the Mind couldn't quite identify it but then slowed down it became obvious it was right there every so many frames there was a picture of these things and so I just shared that to kind of lay the groundwork that we're living in an age where Satan is just in his fashion just dumping these things putting them out and they say we don't understand uh uh why this person behaved in this fashion or this well my brother and sister it's under those influences which would be one of the reasons that as Believers I don't believe we should let our children be playing all of these games that are on these devices because I don't think you're going to find any born-again Christians doing you know uh Minecraft or a War of the Worlds or whatever those things are in fact I did some research on that and find out that one of the most popular writers of those games is is a drug addict who constantly would just get himself as high as he could get and still function and then stay up for 36 hours straight under an anointing and write those games and we just have to be careful let's turn in our Bibles to Second Corinthians if we would this evening it's just so good to see each and every one of you and you know just uh like you to remember I think about them very often our brother John sister Joanna down I believe it is San Jose or Fresno or wherever they're at somewhere between here and there and and all of the Believers down there we just ask you to remember them in prayer our brother Prashant and sister akonsha uh when when they can have been fellowshipping with them it's a pretty good drive I think three or four hours but there's some interaction and so you know we know Sister Jerry and I know brother John sister Joanna and we just ask you just remember them and the Saints down there in prayer now I want to have you you're going to have to jump from thought to thought tonight and I've tried to trim this down so that it doesn't drag out forever second Corinthians 4 10. through 12. always a bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest and in my notes I have enlarged the word in quite large it's a very key element of our thought tonight that Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you Heavenly Father we just ask you to bless the thought tonight help us Lord Lord just to be focused and we just ask the Lord Now guide us in your name amen you may be seated I just want to put this in a context now this is just how Paul thinks so if it doesn't come across just quite right uh you know just bear with me but you know when we pray for the Saints in the Ukraine we need to also remember all of the Believers um in those regions um it's not just Ukraine but on the Borderlands and even into the country all of the Believers in Russia and the bordering countries there there's just been a tremendous need and Believers that are in um these other countries are are you know giving a a lot to help the Believers taking families in and and these kind of things so let's just expand that boundary that border to all of the Believers in in the whole region because as we're thinking this has been very much on my mind uh just in the way that I I wrote my notes here now brother Branham in the greatest battle ever fought lays out the platform you might say that we can see clearly how that when the Warfare there was a choice of a Terrain for the Warfare that Satan he really desired to bring it into the mind he saw that that would be a very great place a very successful place for him to bring in the Warfare and so he he chose as it is to take the Warfare of the Mind knowing that if he can Captivate the mind he also gets the body but as I spoke to you on along this subject here of a few Wednesdays ago the flash does not matter at all he's after the soul he he wants the soul the flesh is just uh you might say a byproduct of what the Warfare is and what it's about and so as Satan has come he he chooses the mind because the mind is kind of you might say control Central and uh so as we look at the Battleground external uh how that Warfare is very destructive very devastating and we see how that Satan my brother and sister he has invaded so deep he looked out and he thought you know what I can affect generations to come if I can bring separation or divorce into a family it won't just affect that man and woman but it will affect children and those children then will have a scar and it will be that much easier for me to come and Scar them even deeper because they won't know how to trust they won't know how to to just put themselves completely into a relationship and that affects us spiritually also that people who cannot trust have a very hard time and when it comes even in the spiritual realm to trust God and so he looks at that and he says you know now if I can come and and the scripture says that he is our healer so if I can come and touch these uh Believers if I can come and uh when they're expecting or yearning or longing and crying out for healing if I can just come in and I can interfere just a little bit and so it's in that realm my brother and sister that he would come and just leave just this slightest slightest smidge of doubt or fear knowing that will interfere knowing that will hinder and uh you know it's there that he he would come and um in so many Fashions we won't go through them tonight you can just look at all of the things that are of humanity that Satan does not have to come and and uh completely rip something apart to make it ineffective uh you know sister Sue bought me a book quite some time back and I I got around to reading it and it was of the great spies uh and saboteurs of World War II and and actually I found a lot of uh very very inspiring things in there spiritually but uh one of the stories was how a man who was a spy just found work clothes put them on found a wheelbarrow and just started pushing it down the road and they come along and says what are you doing and he said oh I'm a laborer looking for work and they said well here is this Factory over here go over there and work and he went in there and he had in hidden in his clothes a special powder that was kind of a a super super fine grit and so he got him a job assigned to an area where they put all the bearings and he just went and every so many bearings he would do he would just rub a little of that grit on the bearing and then they could not understand as the trucks were leaving uh it was a truck Factory as the trucks were leaving some within a hundred miles some after a few weeks but they would grind to a halt because you see he didn't need to pour rocks and gravel and metal filings it was just the finest almost invisible to the eye is all he had to apply and it brought that to a halt and and it caused me to stop and think about how that Satan comes in our lives and he doesn't have to pour out you know great big things into our life but if he can pour out something of the finest that would would come at a certain day at a certain time down the road and would bring us to a place that we would come and we would start to doubt or fear would rise up in us and circumstances around us we'd lose our trust and it would be in such a fashion that when we as Christians come to a halt then Satan can just come in as it were and ravaged that person because they're not moving forward spiritually and so is that in this we look how that the Battleground external can be a great thing and let me just bring this to you also that the Battleground external Satan knows how whether it would be of the perversion of the world in magazines and and Etc but Satan knows how externally to assault you that it would be the prophet of God now people would sometimes cringe at Brothers Paul's way of looking at this but as the prophet of God is talking about hanging that little crucifix from Izmir and he says when you would look out there he says then I would turn I would look at the cross hanging there now my brother and sister I'm not implying anything negative please don't misunderstand but it wasn't like the prophet was blind to that woman on the street are you with me but he knew what he had to do so Satan throws these things external and if one's not careful he gets caught in that the second look the third look and condemnation comes and Liberty is taken away stripped for a season as it were and so we look at this these things sometimes that people think oh that was just a little story the prophet of God told you stop you read it again you pray over it those little stories are sermons in their own self they are there as in samples for us to recognize as he is speaking what is taking place and to know that if Satan can externally he will throw the very same thing back against you and I and so it's there that if we can grasp the the warfare that's taking place and this is why my brother and sister in Warfare you don't want all new fresh officers you want old veterans we want old brothers old sisters that would be able to say you know what we have been through this we have saw this please don't go there take a different route look at it differently because we need that in the body of Believers it is not just a fresh crop going on but God mingling our elders as it were with us right down to our babies to bring a mixture together that brings a successful church because in the outside realm external we then can fight again since those things with experience and with confidence not worried about all will this work or not you'll have and and you say what do you mean by oh old veterans or Elders my brother and sister it's not necessarily age that makes you Elder but if someone is discouraged in a position of their healing you need someone who has been healed amen you don't need to have a whole group of people speculating whether God Is A Healer or not that's why God puts these Elders as it were or even young people that have been healed they put them in the body so that when someone says I've been praying for healing someone can rise up and say remember God healed me and I'm telling you this might be a little Stark or whatever but my brother and sister you get a group of men mixed in age together and you're going to find that somewhere if people are on us there will be a brother that will say I have something I'm fighting and they're in that little group will be a brother what rise up and say God gave me victory over that you can do it brother keep pressing the battle and so God makes this mixture of the body of Believers so that there's always a witness on the scene God will never leave us without a witness Can someone say thank you Lord amen and so it's there that we are able to see in the external now my brother and sister it's interesting this magazine showed up after we're already well into this but I I received a a farm publication that I've been subscribed to for probably 30 years and partly because it's free but um this issue they send me it's about Mental Health they get right down to it they don't patty cake this thing now you say why do you bring that up brother Paul because there's some things in our lives that have a stigma and we as humans it's not just to mental health there's a lot of things sometimes there's sin in our life that's a stigma and the Articles talking about how that mental of Health affects people in such a fashion they can't even make decisions can't hardly get out of bed in the morning sometimes struggle to do the simplest task because one it wrongs them of all confidence of what they're doing uh it robs them of all of awareness of where they really fit in the picture and it demeans them and lowers their self-worth and I thought isn't that just like the devil that is just like the devil he comes in he wants you to look at yourself in the beer and say I couldn't possibly be a Son of God I couldn't possibly be a daughter of God and to young people to children say I I can't even see what they're talking about do I even try and Satan muddying this off and bringing in such a fashion that at the end what he's trying to do is take an external battle interior he's trying to bring it into an inner battle and when he can get that battle down in the Realms my brother and sister of the spiritual elements of our life then Satan's goes to work and it's a matter of time and it sometimes as a brother just shared with me the other day a little deal sometimes it takes two three four years for Satan's work to come down and cut his way all the way down to the soul but that's where he's going my brother and sister you know as the scripture says we'd be better to go to heaven I'm kind of enlarging this we'd be better to go to heaven missing an arm a hand an eye not able to hear not able to speak we'd be better to go down than to go whole and be lost and Satan knows if he can come in there and maim the spirit so he takes the battle in inside and the similarities my brother and sister are so close destruction devastation collateral damage sometimes people who are never touched by the Warfare are traumatized the rest of their lives just by the experience we'll touch on that I hope I can just get going here touch on that is what the prophet said now I'm going to skip over some things tonight so I just need you to just kind of grasp a whole to this and see where I'm going very costly to win a war now everybody's just guessing but I was looking at an article it was talking about how much that Russia has spent so far and how much Ukraine has spent so far and you go back and correlate that with what United States spent in Vietnam and these different things and war is costly not only in the lives of men and women and the collateral but just cold Hard Cash it's costly and you look at this and realize that to win a war is is very expensive but I want to just bring this so that I don't lose your thoughts tonight I want to just bring this right along and we'll go into Ephesians 3 16. and as we look at this my brother and sister to win a war is very costly a price equal to what he says in Ephesians 3 16 he said that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory not putting a price back to fleshly things or carnal things but he's viewing or tying you and I in a Warfare back to the riches of his glory my if one's soul is worth ten thousand worlds my brother and sister I think I've shared with you before I once had a business calculator that went out to like 10 or 12 places and I just started in in encyclopedia at the GDP and this is many years ago the GDP alphabetically of countries and I started just putting them into the calculator I didn't get very far down the list and the number was too big for a 10 Place calculator just give you an idea that the wealth of the world is a lot and then God said that ain't enough I'm going to times it by 10 and declare that's what you are worth when Satan would come and try to tell you you're worthless you're not worth the effort you're not worth anything God wouldn't even think of you throw that back at the Devil and tell him Satan until you could come up with the wealth of 10 000 worlds don't even open your mouth come on it's time for us to be bold on these things don't even open your mouth because you don't got it you couldn't even come down as a near Kinsman and redeem because you were afraid of what it would cost you my are you with me to be strengthened with might by his Spirit see now it's no longer exterior it's no longer an outward battle God's coming along and he's going to strengthen You by his spirit in the Inner Man that's what we need my brother and sister I got no problem with the brothers that exercised don't misunderstand that but we don't need external strength we need strength in the Inner Man we need strength down in the realm of the soul that we can stand solid and not be shoved around by every wind of Doctrine and not be uh finding ourselves confused by people saying no that's not what it is it's this it's that the strength of the inner man will take you to the heart of the word that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love you know interesting it doesn't even lay it down to Doctrine theology my eyes not been actually bothering me it's been bothering my wife but I wake up in the mornings my eye is just totally blood red bloodshot she finally said I'm making an appointment you're going to go you know how that is it's okay wives for you to be that way because men can be stubborn anyway so I went in there to the doctor this morning and uh you know I'm sure glad he didn't have a bunch of patients this morning because he's like so your wife said something to the to the receptionist and you guys are going somewhere and so I I tell him you know we're going to Israel and and we talked for probably 40 minutes on spiritual things and um he had books he says oh somebody told me to read this book he said and you know I thought well why are you telling me all the name and author of the book if you don't want me to read it but anyway we talked about these things and these things of the holy land and all of this stuff and and he he was like you know and I'm reading a book right now about how they're making the case that it um it wasn't the Romans that killed Jesus but I said I I would I would agree with that but his reasoning was wrong and he says well no the author means it's like this or had to be like a conspiracy because if the Jews had killed Jesus they would have stoned him and I thought okay I'm not going to get down to the niceties but I threw this one at him prophecy house to be fulfilled there's just no way we can say oh this will change this you know could be a different way prophecy must be fulfilled now my brother and sister the prophet of God says you need to recognize yourself in the word of God now prophecy might not put your surname there it might not put all of the you know middle names there but it speaks to the spirit of Sons and Daughters of God and identifies them as Revelation comes out of the book it it stirs the heart of a son or daughter of God that they can say he's talking about me and it's in that realm then we stop and say you know what if I'm in the book there's prophecy concerning me and that prophecy must come to pass and I stand on that and I say thank you Lord and the prophet of God comes along and drives it home and says he won't lose a single one and the devil's there saying you have no value you have no value you have no value I'm sorry regardless of what my value is the word said he won't lose me oh my brother and sister reminds me of a story some young men in the military we were in a beach in a foreign country on taking some leave time or whatever and one of them found an old coin and and he thought oh look at this look at this this is an old coin and he went to a coin dealer and the coin dealer says yes they made those out of every kind of metal and stamped that little Insignia on it and yours is not even worth a nickel do you want to change you see my brother and sister it doesn't matter the young man says no when was this coin made and they told them the date quite some time back he said it has value to me because I found it then the coin dealer says well I'll give you a few dollars for it no you don't understand this coin is taken on value to me something that wasn't worth it worth making change for is suddenly allow you and Satan would come and say your value or not couldn't be in God's economy being who you are and stumbling around like you have and making mistakes but God looked down and says I don't care about any other kind of value the value resides in what it is to me no and the devil would like us to believe we're nothing to Christ but the word says we're everything amen may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes All Passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US this message my brother and sister is external to some wife daughters you are gonna do this Sons you are going to be like this and I will be like this external but when the word ever gets down on the inside when the battle for the outside is put to the side and I say truly put the battle for the outside to the side and look to the inside and when it gets to the inside a man doesn't have to tell his wife how to dress a man doesn't have to tell his daughters how to dress a man doesn't have to tell his son what conduct that he should we should teach it but still there's something there that says this is it and when that is taken and the intrinsic value of that is recognized my brother and sister Satan has nothing to offer you he has nothing he can give to you that you would exchange for that unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen so this is showing that as God took this battle to the inside we don't find much in this scripture there in the New Testament really dealing exterior when you boil it all down my brother and sister it is just a very small amount that deals with the outer man because God knew if he can ever capture the Inner Man the inner man will capture the outer man oh we can dress right we can look right we can walk right we can talk right we can do all of that but the scripture says they come as ravening wolves so the exterior doesn't even matter God's looking to the inside oh Hallelujah I hope you don't mind I think I'll just step over a few things that basically are just reiterating that in the Great and Mighty conquer brother Brown puts it like this before any Victory can be won there must be great prices paid oh what prices and sometimes they are very deep and they make great scars tearing down but in order to have the mountain we've got to have the valley now I want you to think about Warfare you cannot hold the Heights in Warfare without being able to defend the valley and we say oh Lord just let me live in the heavenlies up in the mountaintops without any challenge without any no you see my brother and sister to hold the top you have to be able to defend the valley Lord not my will but thy will what are you doing you are ruling by offense and defense in the same Lord if you want me to live in Heavenly places then you have to allow me to make it through the valley to rise to Heavenly places this is why Saints I'm deviating just a little bit but this is why you will see people whose relationship goes from revival to Revival to Revival to Revival because they're not able to defend the valley are you with me you got to be able to move from The Mountaintop through the valley to the next Mountaintop intact if everything you have and everything that you are is destroyed at every Valley you come to then you cannot ride the next Mountain Victorious so God wants you to be able to defend yourself in the Valley now I don't think any of us tonight would raise a hand and say I just love going through the valley valleys are my specialty no sir lofty grandeur is the specialty I know where I can stand and the Eagles are flying and I can see and all its peace and tranquility but you see God didn't just no let me back up because actually God did make you to fly in the heavenlies I was kind of thinking in a different direction but God made you to fly in the heavenlies but you have to be able to fly down the valley also we've got to have the valley before we can have the sunshine we've got to get the rain for we can have the light we've got to get the night before we can have right they had to have wrong or you could have never known what wrong was but in order to conquer and to win the greatest battle that was ever won one stepped out of Glory oh aren't you glad tonight one stepped out of glory and said you know what I'm a veteran of this Warfare I know how to overcome these things and I'm gonna show you how to be the Overcomer the Conqueror and I'm going to show you the tactics of the enemy oh sorry I get a little excited tonight but you see my brother and sister one stepped out of Glory many years ago and he did not take upon himself the form of an Angel he did not come as some great person but he was going to prove that it don't take muskets and bullets and atomic bombs to win a war Hallelujah aren't you glad tonight we don't have to have a little pocket nuke briefcase nuke they have different terms for them my brother and sister we don't have to have that God has said I'll take you through Valley I'll take you to the middle of the mountain I'll take you to the top of the mountain if you ever want to find a scriptural or spiritual connection in that you look at lot and his daughters and they fled and they went down and they dwelled in the city for a while and even the city was too Wicked for a lot but where was the downfall at my brother and sister it wasn't in the total complete debasement of the valley they made it part way up the mountain found a cave in backslid right there God never intended for us to just get halfway to the Mountaintop halfway to an overcoming experience halfway to being conquerors and look what he did it brought about Moab which in the end Satan used to bring a downfall to Israel he did not come atomic bombs to win a war he clothed himself in humility like a little baby was born in a manger isn't that awesome my brother and sister I look at that and I say oh Lord I keep telling myself Lord I've got to do this and I've got to do that I don't got to do nothing but surrender I've got to just say Lord here I am reporting for Duty here I am whatever it is I want you to go crawl through the mud yes sir um come on and take you back into a into a few things here I hope you don't mind but you look and and there's a movie that's been made about it there's books written about it but a man named Colonel Hal Moore in Vietnam trained his soldiers I believe they were in Georgia Florida somewhere down there there were swamps anyway and he trained them so hard those men talked amongst themselves we ought to just kill this guy when he's you know went to the bathroom throw a grenade in there and get this over with everybody else has gotten you know easy everybody else is doing he made them wear full packs crawl through real mud with their gun in front of them and when they come out the other end their gun better be clean and Men hated him for it but they get sent to Vietnam and they came home from that war with the least casualties of any battalion that went there and Men come after married and starting families they found him and they thanked him because their name wasn't on a black marble wall in Washington D.C sometimes God says I'm gonna let you crawl in the mud for a little while I'm going to load you down with so many burdens you don't even think you can move and then I'm going to demand that you move and we're going to say Lord what are you doing to me making you a conqueror bringing you through the war that you would come one day and say thank you Lord thank you Lord I'm alive today there was not even a place for his birth when he came come I want you to look at the different material of warfare what he used now Adam's race was all in bondage there they were without hope without god without chance without Mercy without anything that could help them the great enemies of the lower regions of the Lost had them shut up in darkness now that seems my brother and sister are a different way to describe somebody that's just caught up in sin come on oh it's just a little sin no you're caught up in the outer regions of Darkness that's really how we correlate this problem is we have become tolerant that we were like that was just we don't even call it a gray lie I was a little white lie see how Satan's so tricky he's God is lying and whitewashing it and we don't even think it matters but the reality of it is at that point without repentance it's the outer regions of Darkness the prophet of God gave me a license to preach a little harder than I have been because he was talking about those preachers that were cowards because they wouldn't preach the word and I went and looked in the mirror and said I am not a coward so now I got to prove it had them shut up in darkness is not a way out it was no one could help nothing could be done it looked like a total complete loss but our hero I like this the world's always looking for Heroes they need a hero they got one right in their midst the greatest hero ever but he's not the kind of hero they're looking for but our hero amen can we say that together but our hero who came down from the portals of Glory condescending down for there was no man on Earth could do the job they were all as worldly speaking in the same boat we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lives and none of us could help each other hmm yes look at that none of us could help each other we stood helpless defeated Chaos on every hand you know this seems this is a brother shared with me it's been back a little while he shared with me he says you know Paul when I'm preaching a youth meeting convention he said I can tell the kids that were raised in the message from the kids whose families converted come into the message and he says it's a lot harder to preach to the kids raised in the message because they don't really know what sin is right oh they got caught with their fingers in the cookie jar but they don't understand it's it's a little harder for them to grasp that I was born in sin period that's just the whole thing I didn't have to go out and sin I was born into that and I was shaped in iniquity and I come forth Just naturally I mean you'll never find a parent saying now little Bobby when I'm in the other room you sneak over here and take cookies and when I ask you if you took cookies you tell me no any parent ever trained their kid like that no sir but Mom rounds the corner near a beeline to the cookie jar they know exactly what she wasn't stealing cookies but the other day if I walk in the kitchen and at first I don't know what she is doing and she's over there and she opens one drawer and pulls it way out then pulls the next drawer out and then when she was standing on top of the counter I'm like that's how that works yeah now when I was a kid we always lived in houses if you'd have stepped on that first drawer it would have splintered and it would have been disc and we were smart enough to not do that but you look Little Johnny Bobby Fred Sue whatever it's just in them come on let's admit it Saints it's just Dennis just Dennis that's why we all need a conversion amen yep we come down look at this my brother and sister seemed like the whole human race laid waste and then he come he come down because he was in the beginning the Bible said he was the word he was the logos that went out of God and the logos in the beginning was the word and he became the word then when he ascended up on that glorious day of Easter he become not only the word but he I look at this come on catch this I hope it stirs your heart he became the high priest of his own word oh my when we go before the high priest to tell them Lord I'm sorry for these things what are we doing we're not talking to somebody off in a room somewhere here is now the judge the jury everything all in one and he says as the high priest I am in charge I am the one that accepts the indictment I'm the one that gives the pardon know how beautiful that is my brother and sister he became the word then we need to send it up on that glorious day not only the word become the high priest of his own word and what a glorious thing brother Neville just think he's not only the word but he is the high priest of his own word how could we doubt it how could we walk to him and not believe that we receive what we ask for the very one that make the promise the very one that can fulfill the promise and the Very one that will will manifest that promise right out in our flesh as we read earlier is right there how could we not oh not receive what we asked for oh my this was a really long quote and at first I was going to cut it off but I was just it's just too good I gotta gotta gotta read it amen for he is the word and the intercessor of the word the logos become word and the word made flesh in the same flesh that was the word received up into glory and now is the high priest making intercession by himself to his word that's what it takes that's a lot deeper saying so I hope you don't just gloss over that as a you know a word Trail that's deep right there that's you having personal access to the very Throne of God oh we don't got to go through the preacher we don't got to go through a priest we don't got to go through you know Mecca as it were we have a direct line amen that little girl I don't know if she lives down there in Louisiana but she was down there singing that a direct line to the throne room yeah I don't know if any of you ever heard that but if you haven't go on uh what's that girl's name Jerry you remember Hayley cross go go on YouTube find Haley cross listen to that I'm telling you every time I listen to that song it stirs something in me because this little girl singing that song that has a direct line to the throne room oh you can't tell me because I've already got that direct line my brother and sister what is this that's you and I oh no we're not trying to bypass anything we're not trying to bypass going to church we're not trying to bypass the preacher we're not trying to bypass you know following the word of God no no no no no but God's given you a direct line to the intercessor I'm telling you what my brother and sister what's happening in the world we live in today and I'm not going to leave myself out of this little indictment is we are not making enough direct line calls to the throne room we're not asking for enough intercession reminds me of a little story years ago had kind of a deeper meaning to it priest is sitting in his confession booth young lady walks in one day and makes a confession concerning kind of an important but not really important thing and she does her confession she's back the next day at the confession booth and makes pretty much the same confession and the next day the same confession and the next day the same confession and the priest says look you've already confessed that she goes no I was confessing what I did yesterday this is a new day cute story huh except for the prophet of God says we backslide daily not a once a month visit to the throne room but daily and maybe not even daily maybe we shouldn't even let 24 hours pass I quieted you guys all up my goodness by himself to his word that's what it takes that's the material that the church is God what a weapon there has never been one like it he was the word and when he come he was born in a manger he come to use the weapon of love love to conquer the world not with that army bullets not with machine guns and tanks but he come in a different manner he come in the form of love he was God's love boy I'll tell you what if we're missing love my brother and sister you're not going to get much further than that cave halfway up the mountain oh God help us God help us and we're not talking about touchy feely love we're talking rooted in the word rooted in our spirit rooted that that we just are going to love no matter what now how many have ever been offended okay the rest of you can lift your hands and nothing be ashamed about it's hard isn't it and I am fairly good at opening my mouth and putting my foot in it and would leave the door open for some things to be taken as offense but now I want to remind you all just in case I have done that or I do it again can anyone tell me how many times you have to forgive me that's right now let's talk about love come on do we have love I'm talking to the bride of Christ tonight okay is that is that good we're not just talking to humans talking to the bride of Christ do we have enough love to do that Lord help us if we would say no let us find a place to repent if we say no to that and I'm not talking about making a big deal out of it just find your time in your own room however it works for you but you see that's what God's bringing us to that our weapon of our Warfare is not external it is internal my brother that I farm with always talks because he's a rough Gruff hiding that soft mushy interior who he is that you can tell him about something and he gets tears in his eyes and then immediately he's this light work you know gotta hide it somehow but you see my brother and sister in this world we live in my brother always says quit wearing your feelings on your sleeve okay I'll put them in my pocket and bring him up like a hanky so you can see them no I don't think that's what it is I think that God's working on a Saints to bring us to a place that it's no longer an exterior Warfare but it's down here in the piece and it's settled in The Souls of Sons and Daughters of God that we can look out and say you know they might have meant it but this test is not about them this test is actually about me and I'm going to win this test I'm gonna I'm gonna overcome amen praise the Lord are we willing to pay a price Saints now you look in the message we're almost done well you look in the message and um brother Branham uses the word betting ground quite a few times and so we'll look at this and I'm just going to touch just briefly on this for a moment imagine that the betting ground has been planted with good seed do you believe we have an exemption that says that the wicked one's not going to come and plant his seed in that same bedding ground that would be to say that the word was not entirely accurate so we have a betting ground that we've done our best Mothers you've done the best to raise your children can we say Amen the devil's not going to say they're never going to hear rock and roll the devil is never going to say I won't even bother them because they've been raised right actually then the Devil comes along and says you know what I'm I'm going to go in full Warfare full Warfare because here's a young person I love Saints I don't know if any of you ever went and looked it up I love reading about muskox can any of you tell me why can you remember one of the key elements of the muskox they always shove the weak to the center and they surround them with as it is their horns their heads out the problem the devil's got people into is we take the weak and we say you know the wolf might be satisfied if he gets to devour this one well that's well and good right I mean after all it's just natural selection you know the devil always goes after the weakest right come on somebody you know better the devil goes after whoever he desires weak poor strong rich but the musk ox they never they never abandoned their own wolves surround them try to entice them to go out and if you've ever watched anything like that they'll go out a few steps but they realize their safety is in the body and they come right back to their position why because look at this now God gave this Instinct I think for them to be an example in the spiritual world that it's not just them that will be damaged if they go out after to prove the message and they go out there and then the wolf devours them they've now left a hole as it were in the body that the Wolves will then uh try us they're luring this out they try to Dart in behind until that hole is closed that's why the body of Believers Satan says um I'll throw some offense in there draw somebody out they become angry I don't want to go to church with them they don't love me they're not far what is he doing he's leaving a hole in there he's not only got that when he's left a hole into the body that he can come into and so it's there my brother and sister the musk ox recognize us their protection is to not look at the hinder most parts of the other muskox but always oh I don't know why I drifted off into this but it's not going to be me back here going well brother Trevor you know brother Trevor's brother Trevor but it's me standing right here brother Trevor we'll just watch The Wolf together we'll Stomp The Wolf together you wanna kinda put a cheeseburger on whether I get him or you get him see never looking at the hinder most but always standing together saying I'm sorry yep double you're right you're right he didn't do that correct but I'm still going to stand shoulder to shoulder with my brother with the body of believers oh my see the betting ground produces fear or faith that's the Simplicity of it you can just boil it right down if you want what the prophet of God said it produces fear or faith and now we're down to our last quote here amen well that's the matter with our Pentecostal faith today we've let too many things hinder it the faith that we've been taught the Holy Spirit that's been living in US we've let too many things looking at somebody else well I'm sure I could live an overcoming life if everybody else would live an overcoming life well let yourself be the first if there's no one else you be the first we let too many things looking at somebody else and the devil is always trying to point you to somebody's failure but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that's genuine he'll point you to a hypocrite sometimes who went out impersonating something he didn't do it because he was impersonating this was kind of the root of what I started in the start of the service right we've made this circle around that we need those in our midst that have overcome we need those in our midst that have been healed we need those in our midst that have went through absolute fiery trials because they are not impersonators my brother and sister and when they tell you our God heals then you can understand sure is our God Is A Healer it's right here and when there's Deliverance someone brother sister would say God delivered me we can go to the bank with that and say you know what God's right here in our midst still delivering people are like well you know they just this isn't happening and that didn't happen like where probably at your house it's not because you have fear of faith and you gave up Faith and settled on fear and fear never accomplished anything what is that acronym they use for fear um false evidence appearing real my a lot of things that seem to appear real today my brother and sister yeah you better believe that Abraham Lincoln said on a quote that he put on the internet that come on we can find all kinds of nonsense but what are we doing Satan luring real Christians to look at the hinder most part of those around them I Repent from my statement I made the other day that somebody ought to chase them Scoundrels down and you know investigate their life and slam it in their face I I Repent from that that's not right I just read today the prophet said you know Judas is Ministry was a holy ghost Ministry God checked me I thought yep I would get all this evidence run over there and smack him in the face and they would be doing the will of God and I would be the one that would be out of the will I'll just withdraw I feel accept my apology for that one because that was unwise to stay say there no but if it come from a true source of the word of God heavens and earth will pass away but my word cannot pass away it's got to stay there you see it Sis it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart hallelujah sister Emmy would you come Hallelujah I hope that my little ramble the last few days through the word of God spoke to you tonight you see my brother and sister the devil wants to lure you into the fight on his ground but we've been given the word and the way to use it you realize some of the Roman legionnaires because there was a certain amount of prestige that come with those they had conquered some legionnaires that were maybe not of good moral character would find someone to fight them that was of a lesser skill and it made them look good because it comes out with everything he comes out with the helmet the breastplate you know all of the armor on the legs and and everything and the sword in his hand but because he has no experience it doesn't take long for that man to conquer him and then that man looks looks important looks great can count his victories I could just preach it or I could plagiarize it and you probably wouldn't figure it out but I don't like to do that brother Danny Stevens preached a sermon some time back and he drives home the point before Satan Lucifer ever got to the Earth come on grasp this before he ever got to the Earth he'd already been conquered he got got out of heaven by our hero Hallelujah come on Saints when the Devil comes a roaring just remind him sorry my hero My Heroes already kicked you out and you're already defeated oh I'll tell you what I love that my brother and sister I don't have to stand try and say well if I was a little more spiritual if I was a little more than this no sir I just get a stand with my hero he's already conquered him amen aren't you glad to serve a God Like That amen one to come in our time of need amen let's just stand and just worship for a minute or two I love you Lord oh now I would just ask you just to follow the directive as it were of the song would that be too much for Paul to ask you I love you Lord and I lift [Music] I'm not going to whisper it I'm gonna lift my voice I love you Lord foreign [Applause]

into his presence you see I've been promised by the word we read tonight that yes I'll take a little liberty and saying it I've been dressed in royalty you've been dressed in royalty and when you go to come to the throne Saints get this out of your mind you're not going to come and have to keep asking for permission can I go to the throne can I go to the throne you're going to hear a voice echo through the heavens the bride is here the bride is here everyone stand back the bride is here make way to the throne the bride is here and that's the value that he has placed on you and I not

God he comes out and he Woos us back he doesn't tell us we're not sufficient we're not good enough we have not enough value but he comes and he Woos us back oh my heart when I read that I just Rejoice about how many times my Lord has wooed me back how many times he said Paul this is not the end this is just part of the story oh what a mighty God we serve oh what a mighty God we serve Angels bow
