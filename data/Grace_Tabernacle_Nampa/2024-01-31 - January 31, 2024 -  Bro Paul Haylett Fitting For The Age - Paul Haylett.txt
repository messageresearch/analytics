and he was talking about the time thank you musicians of just lovely music tonight sure appreciate that amen want to just remember there's quite a few not with us tonight we just want to remember them in prayer every situation um I think most of you probably did see the text I sent about visiting sister Joanne they would appreciate it they just would like a phone call so not having what happened a couple days ago when we were there that there was no one there and by the time we left there was a crowd um so anyway um sister Joanne just really rallied I I got to uh I I kind of considered it special to my heart to actually get a little chuckle out of her and a smile and uh some very personal words back and forth brother Bob you know I've been told that he he he he's not doing so good in his thinking but if that's the case then he had a wonderful day because we just had a lovely little conversation and um you know it just so so lovely to see the love that they have because brother Bob was telling me says oh that Joe she's the prettiest girl I ever met in my life and it just melted my heart I got tears in my eyes thinking yep there it is still after all these years um just beautiful time if you're unable to visit definitely just lift them up in prayer amen let's turn our Bibles sister Carrie we welcome you home amen World traveler or well anyway uh North and South but and speaking of travel mercies let's remember uh brother Sergey sister ulie and the family and their little getaway amen just uh turn in Hebrews the 5th chapter verses 8-14 um and uh just want to just take a few minutes tonight Lord be with me I'll be very um uh precise concise tonight Hebrews 5 starting with the eth verse though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of God a high priest after the order of MDC of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing pretty straightforward isn't he for when the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord tonight Lord just speak to our hearts and Lord you know the prayer requests you know all of the needs father not just here but around the world father Satan is attacking this bride but Lord she is predestinated to stand this test and father not only will she stand the test but she will come out of the test father Victorious and full of Glory father we thank you for the opportunity to come before your Saints tonight I pray that you would just bless them in your precious name amen you you may be seated amen so as we would look at this tonight I just uh want to kind of look an overview of this real quick so here here in in uh these scriptures we see that God is bringing a pattern of his life to us and it is there that we would sometimes hope that life would just get simple for us but it is there that he learned obedience by the things he suffered and we can no less expect my brother and sister to learn obedience by the things that we suffer and uh you know the pattern that Jesus Christ gave to us uh was not just a pattern that only he could live but it was a pattern that he give to us as a Son of God he gave it to us that he would be our living epistle that the bride of Christ could read or discern that life and live that very life can we say Amen to that it was not just lofty words that we looked at and hoped that somehow we could do but these were words that were given to us that we by example would be able to obey and live that now we see my brother and sister the culmination uh we see it in our society now that you might have someone uh uh 30 40 50 years old who is actually very immature and and it is that we see that this is the kind of uh influences Satan would desire to leave upon the people in this age because if he can keep the people the Christians if he can keep them drinking milk then he's got no fear from them they'll never have enough strength to fight the battle they'll never have enough maturity to have discernment on how to fight the battle now I think we've all experienced times that we approach things entirely uh wrong we didn't see it the way that we should approach it in other words we took it and thought we could solve we thought we could fulfill we thought we could uh have the answer but to realize that it is that it's only comes this culmination this coming to maturity only comes our position in Christ and so it's there that a time as verse 12 says that when we ought to be teachers we have a need to be taught again and uh so the first principles of the Oracles of God and so as they type it very very strongly uh in such conditions this immaturity we need something that just makes us feel good about oursel now lest it would sound like I don't believe we should hear the gospel preached as something that would make us feel good about ourself but I believe the bride of Christ uh what makes her feel good about herself is not little Daisy pats on the back and not little oh you know you're such a good person kind of thing but what makes the bride feel good is when she sees herself in the word and even when the word corrects her she still feels good about it can you say Amen to that I I I think that is a beautiful thing that when we even see correction in the word we can actually say I need that I want that amen and so it is by this coming into maturity that we realize that as the time that comes that we ought to be teachers do we realize each and every one of us has a Teaching Ministry we have a Ministry that is teaching the world that Christ is on the scene he's present here today he's alive he's a Healer he still is revealing faith in us and it's there that we see this uh our life and not a teacher mode saying you know I'm a great teacher of the message but when you live the word out you're teaching someone amen might be your children it might be a a spouse it might be a friend whatever it might be a coworker but it's there that we need to be in a place that our life is teaching people that God is real amen but this milk thing my brother and sister I I I study you know different ways I guess you would say and sometimes we'll look at this and I I come across little things in my my studies or looking and and you realize that there is such a move in the land today that uh there's not a real preaching of the Gospel there is a a uh what do they call it a collidoscope or whatever that is uh of religion and what it is is just giving a little snippet just enough of a glimpse of each bit of religion that people feel comfortable that this is actually what it is and to me this reassures of what the prophet said that there had to be a Ministry that would come into this day to restore the gospel back to its correct form we don't need just a little snippet of something that makes us feel good about oursel we need Resurrection life amen and so it's there that as Resurrection Life comes into us we'll see that patterns are forming in the world today and we see how that that these patterns uh are coming that it is my brother and sister when the inmature start teaching the only thing an immature uh uh Ministry produce is immature Ministry and so God in this hour the prophet of God I'm not using his exact words but he's talking about how there had to be something and we'll touch on it in just a minute there had to be something fit for every age that comes down that was sufficient for that age and we're looking at the culmination Satan's plan is coming together and he is here to fulfill the plan in its fullness and so there has to be something here that is correct correct for this day the prophet many times says we cannot go back and take Moses Ministry we can't go get uh uh Noah's Ministry we can't go back and and say you know I'm just going to follow it all worked out well for Jacob I think I'll just follow the pattern of Jacob's life well my brother and sister we're living in this hour We're the bride of Christ we were called to fulfill the word for this hour and I think sometimes that has become like Words almost like a cliche for us we're going to fulfill the word for this hour but if we catch the revelation of how important you and I are in this hour we will never look at that the same when we talk about fulfilling the word for this hour it is a key element that God has called you and I to fulfill and so it's not a pattern of immaturity now I'm going to speak a little direct to you tonight if you don't mind we're seeing things come up in what we would call the message that are simply signs of immaturity people uh you might say uh being defensive of of their position well if we would just take a position in Christ then we don't even then have to defend it because the prophet of God said you're not called to defend this message you're called to live it and so Lord help us to live it and a sign of maturity is not to argue of the ups and downs and rights and lefts of this message the maturity is the life amen and when we are mature we live the life and let our life testify what we believe amen cuz anyone can get up and say all kinds of words of well this is and this is and that is but my brother and sister look at the life amen so it says that those that are uh using milk are unskillful in the word of righteousness amen so it's there we'll find as time goes on maturity my brother and sister is in such a fashion you know you can have a 10-year-old that's quite mature and we say they're very mature but we need to put a quantifier on there for their age and so a 10-year-old that's quite mature will not have the same maturity as one who has went through great struggles and trials and struggles of life and been in that they just you can't quantify that and the same thing and so as we'll look at this real quick tonight we'll find that the maturity that's coming forth in the bride right now being brought forth my brother and sister sister is us laying in the presence of the son is what's bringing this maturity we cannot produce this maturity on our own we'll say well I I'm going to be a stalwart soldier of the Cross I'm going to fight for the gospel but Peter thought that and Peter realized that God was actually calling him to a higher maturity than Peter even knew existed and if I could speak directly tonight I believe there's a maturity that God has for you and I that is higher than we even realize is here amen a place in the word that we we would find ourselves and look back if God carries a few years we'll look back and say I never ever realized amen and so God is bringing this maturity up and just as the wheat doesn't go from green to mature in one day neither will this bride of Christ amen she's got to separate from the hust she she's got to separate from this the things that have cradled it the things that protected it from all of the elements she has to separate herself and separation is hard I believe we can say Amen to that so as you look at that he says now in this I have the the commentary put in here a lack of maturity my brother and sister so milk has its season it has its time and I'm not saying that it isn't it isn't n good sometimes just to sit around and and talk of the very basic simple things of the Gospel we don't have to go deep dive into all kinds of complicated things sometimes it's just good to put a conversation around he's my savior he's my healer he's my deliverer and we can build a conversation around that but my brother and sister maturity is the combination of pulling all of these elements together to have a complete unit when it's finished and so hopefully I can clarify that in just a minute I'll tell you nothing trains you for war like Warfare I love history sister Sue always buys me some books uh you know here and there and in that my brother and sister they they make the soldier the recruit he crawls through the mud he has to run until he almost collapses has to shoot his gun until he's accomplished he they shoot real rounds they do all of these things my brother and sister but there's nothing like knowing the guy on the other end of that is really truly trying to kill you that brings a maturity it brings something to you that you can't experience by just sitting back and talking about it it is something that is real amen and I'm telling you what's happening in this age you know uh my brother and sister what's fitting for this age is God has got battle hardened now not hard hardened in their Spirit not hardened in their soul but hardened in the face of the enemy they don't run they don't retreat they don't give up amen they're not afraid of the enemy they know who the enemy is they know he's already defeated they know as a roaring lion as one brother said he's already had his teeth pulled amen so you have to face up to that that kind of maturity to realize that no matter what happens in our world Amen that God's got it in control and so if strong meat belongeth to those that are full age and I want to be of full age amen who by reason of use this is not somebody sitting in church getting preached to are you with me but by reason of use have their senses exercise to discern both good and evil you know what's hidden between the lines there the times in our immaturity that we didn't recognize and Satan pulled one over on us and told us if you as a real Christian but my brother and sister what happens we're exercising the battles we Face the challenges we Face the age that we live in is exercising us that we could come and have our senses exercised to recogniz ize these things can someone say Amen God's doing that in our life is he not amen it is happening amen we're not just hoping we're not looking for some thing off in the future but it's happening now I'm telling you my brother and sister that Warfare is not fun amen Warfare is work it is all not peaches and cream but as you look at this uh it is very fitting I hope you don't mind to use the word fitting it just struck me and I just kept in up in my thinking but it's very fitting that a mature bride is on the Earth today imagine in 20124 that we had an immature bride in the world today how she would fare against Satan's Onslaught my brother and sister but you see even though some of us are are not old enough some of you are not old enough let me put it that way but you see we've got to see the seasons of the message mature in now when I say that there's no class distinction between the young and old when it comes to the Bride of Jesus Christ because you see as the bride went through these things bringing maturity back here it wasn't coming it is coming let me let me just stop get my thought together it is coming to us as individuals but you have to recognize that God also deals with the bride as a body amen so all the years of extreme legalism start with the years when people said brother brandham is Christ and then we moved into the years right after his passing of extreme legalism and then we rebounded from extreme legalism into extreme liberalism and and we don't need to explain all of that but these were stages that were coming to bring it and what does it produce now a bride who stands on the word believes the word and it don't matter if she's a young or old old she is the bride and she's matured and she's ready to face the culmination of the age when it comes down my brother and sister now little things not to Spook you because we would look and think is there a correlation but you'll find that we're now having more and more people's accounts when their their banking accounts banks are shutting them off and then coming back and saying oops but you see it's not an oops my brother and sister they're just practicing cuz you won't buy buy or sell without their permission they're just practicing it's just coming along this culmination of all of these things and and little things that are happening that that I won't go into all this stuff it's in a way irrelevant but we're seeing how the very signs the prophet said would be the signs of this day are popping up around us we're seeing this come up we're seeing Israel once again you would think that after all of these countries uh you know well let me put it this way if some of them countries the leaders of those countries would just read the Bible and believe what they read they would realize they will not defeat Israel they will not possess that land they can't take it away because it's not about politics it's about prophecy and so as they are fighting in a physical world looking at boundaries trying to do all of this and to uh scheme and whatever God has got a work that must come to pass and it is amen so it's very fitting that there is a mature Bride on the Earth today she's coming up to that time and this bride is supported by the word it's not the other way around it's this bride's supported by the word but you'll find that underneath this bride that word has so solidified that she actually can stand on the word without fear of collapse she can stand on the word without fear that it will not do what it says so she is able with confidence you know there was a little video that I seen sometime a long time ago it was uh titled something like why women live longer than men and it showed these guys with two ladders one sitting on top of the other with a five gallon bucket on top of that at the top of a stairwell and I I looked at that and I thought yes definitely something like that would cause women to live a lot longer than men and you know you look at this my brother and sister because man in his own ability is always trying to improvise instead of going to something that is proven he's always improvising he's always trying to do this and and you'll see that this mature bride is coming she's gave up on the Improv now yes there it is speak louder sister Carrie she don't need need to improvise any longer amen we'll just cut it down to a word I can get out amen she doesn't need to improvise any longer she's got Solid Ground that she's standing on she's standing on this word and she knows this word won't fail her it didn't fail our lord Jesus it hasn't failed the Saints of the ages she can stand here on this word and say Satan get thee behind me knowing she's still got a battle to fight but knowing that God is not going to leave them standing alone oh I tell you it's a beautiful thing my brother and sister when we'll come because you see this is coming to the place where the prophet of God said when this bride realizes who she is she'll become an invincible Army and part of that seeing who she is is knowing this word I stand on will not fail amen and so Satan's always trying to prove that the word has failed some way but the bride is supported by the word in other words she she has nothing outside of the word she's got no other Foundation now the unbeliever or the skeptic would say well they got nothing they they've lost all of their their rational uh uh socializations and all of these things you know they've segregated themselves from the rest of the world and religion and whatever my brother and sister you look all the way down through the Bible and God has always been a separator he's always separated that so this bride has nothing outside of the word to stand on and what she needs is in the word today yeah I think those words are maybe a little deeper than we comprehend what she needs is in the word today right we cannot live Noah's message we can't go back to Moses we can't go back over here we can't go back over there and as much as we look at the natural type of Joshua and Caleb my brother and sister we can't even go back there now in a spiritual context we can take that but in a natural context we can't go back there we have to stand on the word for our day now brother Bram says in the message the token uh he says we're not to come together to talk about the message now if you isolated that it would not look very good right we're not to talk about the message we are to come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the word that's right we're to get into to it get beneath it yes sir that's what we're supposed to do coming right out of the token here my brother and sister we know what the token was was to get under the blood of Jesus Christ to get in his presence amen and the prophet of God even says that if we would get under the blood and the devil got in there with us amen he'd be our brother that's how powerful the blood is that the devil couldn't even get under it without being changed oh I'm telling you what we've got nothing to worry about of a life Chang changing power we got nothing to worry about whether God will take these little habits now I know it's not you but people like you have little habits that have hung on and we have those and I'll just break the ice for you I've got little habits I want to break them I don't want them but I am not afraid today whether that habit in my life will be broken because God's got it all in control and I keep getting back under the blood keep getting Washed by the Water of the word amen and those things get washed away just think about who you were about 5 10 years ago and you'll realize just what God has been doing in our life Can someone say Amen to that amen so you look at that and realize Now You See It Is by The searching amen we're not to just talk about the message but come together and get in the message and so it is by searching the scripture amen that we find our position now what I'm fixing to say would probably cause some maybe somebody will listen to this and disagree not that will be fine but I'm telling you my brother and sister we have created such a platform around the message that we Define what we believe and defend what we believe with quotes alone without going back to the word but that's not what the prophet of God told us to do he told us take it back to the word that's right amen so that is the very cpel what people argue or part of the thing is is what is the word amen well I still believe by example of what the prophet of God said and this is the word when he's talking about the word amen so if someone disagrees that's fine amen I think it be a white cloud White Horse we'll all do just fine but you look at this see he says in John 5:39 search the scriptures for in them ye think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me now obviously when John spoke that there wasn't you know a a a a message info base or you know uh the table or whatever else but there's a very strong point uh that was made of searching the scripture amen for in them you think you have eternal life now my brother and sister how many times have you searched may maybe in your position in life you wouldn't but you know you search and you find something but it's actually the wrong conclusion sometimes that's the downfall of people they go to Google and Google says do this and it might be exactly the opposite of what they really should so they searched and had a wrong understanding of what they saw a wrong interpretation or a wrong conclusion of facts now my brother and sister I believe when this was spoken here in John amen recorded in John that we're looking at this my brother and sister it is the searching of the scriptures will not simply do it for us we could be a great uh uh Scholastic uh understudy we could be a great mind and just study the scripture I believe there's probably hundreds of thousands of people today that study the Bible come up with the wrong conclusion amen they they come I just listened uh uh to a woman preacher that should have been my first clue but I just listened to a woman preacher give a defense of why we should let women in the PO now my brother and sister she actually made a very plausible defense but from the very beginning it was flawed and not picking on our sisters because actually I think sometimes their Ministry reaches more people than ours does but you look at that you see you can't just say well I researched this and found this and I found that you have to have the correct interpretation for our age when we're not looking back like I I I was talking to an individual and they were saying well you're saying that a woman should dress like this but how did you know the difference between a man's robe and a woman's robe back when Jesus was here well I don't live in that day I live in this day what's the interpretation for this day and this doesn't apply to us here but you look at that see we have to have the interpretation for our day not for another time trying to live back uh in another time now in the sermon God's gifts always find their places we'll look at this my brother and sister and one way we can look at this concerning like Ministries or whatever that a man that's called of God will always find his correct place in the body this is a promise from God brother brandham says here God gave his word so much here so much here talking about parceling it out as it were so so much here for each age and then he sent a prophet down anointed to make that word come to pass and it supports the other one that was coming and you can see that my brother and sister down Through the Ages it was always a prophetic word that pointed us to the Next Generation as it were or the next Prophet to come on the scene but you see the prophet of God here in several places tells us that he doesn't see another Prophet coming so we realize that not only does his ministry match up in the scripture that this is the seventh or last age the Fulfillment the maturity of it that there is not another word coming there's not another Prophet coming so it's there that it is spoken of and it supports the other ones that's coming see like the Messiah always supported every prophet in his own life his own being the word that was given for that day he come fulfilled that written word and foretold what the other one was going to be can you find me somewhere where the prophet of God said what the next Prophet would be not a challenge but something to look at what he did say was I believe this is the end of the ages I believe we've come to the maturity now if the word has come to a maturity itself in this day there must be a bride that correlates immaturity you can't have a mature word come and an immature bride continue on moving without coming to any kind of maturity now my brother and sister some people feel like that maybe you are stepping over your Authority when you would come and and take a position like I have a voice but the word of God tells us that the spirit and the bride say come so the bride's voice is connected directly with the spirit not Place subject to it not Place diminished next to it but become as a a portion or a part of the spirit being expressed in this day is a bride's voice and that bride is not going to come and just dance around and and act like she's just got the World by the tail she's a serious bride she's a bride that's making herself ready she has taken the word of her bridegroom and held it closely and said I believe that and I will act upon that and there's a separation to the world there's a separation to things around them I hope I'm making sense tonight amen so it's there as the Messiah always supported it every prophet in his own life was giving a word for the future you know what word the prophet seventh angel messenger had for this my brother and sister this age right here he didn't have it a supporting Ministry of another Prophet to come he had a support ing Ministry of a bridegroom coming and claiming a bride he had a Ministry that said she's going to rise up and accept her position and he's going to come and claim her and take her home now it's a many membered bride my brother and sister but our lord Jesus looks at it as though just taking one wife amen even though she's a many membered body and he's coming for her not for another age not for another thing not for another ideology but for a bride amen not to continue now this might hurt just a little bit uh but it's not a Continuum of a prophet's message my brother and sister the word gives us the example of a time when it comes Isaac and Rebecca there comes a time that eleazer for all his importance for all his authority for all that he was called to do and for every bit that he believed and stepped into his calling there come a time that elaser gets to watch Rebecca run to her bridegroom amen eler doesn't follow behind her now listen to me but elaser stopped and said I've done my job and she's now coming into the fullness of who she is and he is being fulfilled as a bridegroom amen it's not this continuation constantly elaser didn't knock on the tent pole and say hey I just feel like I should come to supper tonight make sure it's all all right my brother and sister wasn't his calling see the word that called you and I is a word that promised to bring you and I to maturity and it's doing it amen it's bringing this bride to maturity and she's now rising up in faith realizing I have a calling and I'm going to fulfill that calling I don't need to ask someone how I should fulfill it the word has spoken to me and I know how to fulfill it because the word says that he suffered learned Obed obedience through suffering and here this bride is now learning what it's like to enter into spiritual warfare and she is becoming quite Adept at fighting the spirits of the age remember the time now Church bear with me I remember the time there was a constant running to the pastor of how do I do this and what should I do and where should I do and all of this and there are some pastors and I I don't say this in any way negative that still want to fulfill that role but Saints I want you to recognize maybe I wouldn't call it my vision but it's just how I see it a church that is maturing doesn't have to go and cry on the pastor sold soldier shoulder all the time right she's coming into maturity amen there's this lady that lives in my house looks like my wife she wants me to quit bringing her up but anyway you know when the light bill's due she doesn't have to come and ask me do I pay the light bill maturity's brought her to the point if we want to have lights the bills got to be paid and she does it and this bride been given remember brother Brown talked about the checkbook this bride doesn't have to stop and say do I have permission right we can take that direct back to what the prophet of God said amen write the check so here's a bride that's coming into maturity not constantly having to go is it okay if I write the check but she knows she can write the check and she knows the check is good and there's the shift that is coming into the bride of Christ she's coming into maturity and you know know like I said there are there are pastors I I know men personally they they really would like the church you know you're going to buy a car come talk to me well I'm sorry if you're going to buy a car and you come talk to me you'll probably be buying a cheap car and you'll probably be buying a car that's white but maybe you don't want a cheap car and maybe you don't want one that's white so the only way I can force you to buy a cheap car that's white is to lean on you to impress upon you to start using some kind no my brother and sister that's not maturity maturity is this bride has caught a revelation of who she is and realizes these things the color of her car the color of her shoes the color of this that and the other has nothing to do with her salvation but where she stands in Christ has all to do with it amen hallelujah so you look at this amen I need to hurry on cuz they amen and then when he came he was a fullness of all the prophets manifested this talking about Jesus cuz they were the word of the Lord they see this is where people I want you to catch this I I'm not on a crusade tonight but I want you to catch this where people come to a place but don't move on are you can you see where I'm at they come to a place amen now they were the word of the Lord uh and uh because they were the word of the Lord and he said himself if you call those Gods whom the word of God come to how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God so here it was these men were the word of the Lord here brother Brown's breaking the word down and says these prophets of the Ages were the word of the Lord so you can see where people in this day and age have come to a point they can't get pass the Prophet The Prophet is the word of the Lord but my brother and sister we need to come into the place of the manifestation of the word of the Lord you can say the prophet's got the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord but there has to be a manifestation of thus saith the Lord coming forth out of that if not we've stopped right there amen only part way you call them Gods who the word of the God come to how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God see even those in that age was identified as Gods God called them himself Gods what were they they were manifestations of his word well what did the prophet come along and say my brother and sister that you are amen he said we are manifestations so he's saying the prophets were manifestations of the word of God but then the prophet takes it a step further and says you are manifestations of the word of God Amen Hallelujah didn't leave it all in in the lap of the prophet he said that word the prophet had will come to you and cause you to be a representation or manifestation coming to maturity of the word of God Amen hopefully I'm not too excited tonight amen and here was he the fullness of the word deity embodied deity manifested In the Flesh and all that was in Christ he bottled up some more no sir he poured it out into the church into the body of Believers not Church denominational not church as an entity and all that was there was poured into you and I see we got to stand today Hallelujah there any gods in here little G little G amen we don't want to get some warped philosophy about whoa we're going to do this but my brother and sister by the word of God we are little Gods praise the Lord amen we've got the very life of Jesus Christ in us and the Very life that was in him poured in us will produce exactly the same seed so we're not looking for another seed we're not looking for another life we're not looking for another manifestation we are the manifestation of the word for this hour amen and if Christ is here in this hour then we know where we stand Hallelujah my oh my God so excited I lost myself okay watch for these gifts that these men brought they couldn't have brought that to a prophet now it's just talking about the wise men yeah the Magi they couldn't have brought that to a prophet it wouldn't have been right see them gifts couldn't have went to Elijah they couldn't have went to Moses they had to come to him and being those gifts were strictly meant for that day and that was to identify who he was by these gifts then here come God along and protected him and kept them two years down there until they found the perfect sign how fitting same thing today amen we're not looking at a whole different manifestation the prophet of God said same thing today now let's go back and read this again because this is the same thing for this day in relationship those gifts were strictly meant for that day right that gift wise men camels a star meant for that day but to identify him and then Here Comes God along and protects him I'm telling you my brother and sister look right down through the age that we're living in we'll start with brother brand a gun blows up in his face the bolt tears up his head the stuff blows in his eyeball but God protects him didn't keep him from a gun blowing up but protected him now we won't elaborate on that because you can make your own references but I want you to stop and look in your own life as God protected any of us has God not been on the scene for you and I and it's not always in a physical element sometimes he's protecting us from Spirits he's te from things that Satan would try to throw in our way but he's protected us and we stand here today or sit amen so he keeps them until they found the perfect light oh praise God hallelujah we could be Baptist tonight we could be lutherans tonight we could be Mormons or Catholics tonight but God protected us until we found the perfect light amen oh Hallelujah that makes my heart so happy amen how fitting amen you got people that's just as loyal nice people genuine people but you see in that there's going to be something come forth that God's always done to identify this day this is the day when these things are spoken to happen it's talking about today talking about this age talking about this this time there won't be many just a very very few that'll be saved the Bible said so that just be a handful just a handful well there's more than eight of us here tonight draw your straw we'll see if you're in or not but you see this was the culmination of the ages we don't sit here and try and figure out who the eight are we were called someone say Amen to that that we were called and God said this work I began in you I will finish so the example the prophet was making when he's talking and taking the scripture and making that example he's not cutting it down to eight people he's there in a vision of the marching to the music my brother and sister there was a multitude out of every nation that was marching the prophet's not trying to create some doctrine that there's only going to be people but he's telling you this is not going to be a large group of people just going along as a movement this is a bride called and that's why we need to identify we need to speak out I'm called I'm standing there don't let the devil rob you of your position I am called I know without a doubt God called me yes amen and he will finish the work he has started amen the one be many just a handful let's go on there brother Alex if you'll just Jesus said himself it was in the days of Noah wherein eight Souls were saved eight Souls out of a generation likened to this as it was in the days of Noah what was it great cultured people great workers great Builders great everything as they had made this civil civilization just like it great things that they had and as it were in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man see and God had Noah to identify his promise word and it was very fitting the ark was fitting to the word of God that he spoke that he would destroy man but he saved what he could you realize how important those words right there are but he saved what he could because there was a people who wouldn't say yes to the word but there's more than eight of us here tonight saying yes to the word you see God is not going to take that lightly he's not going to just brush over that the very life the very seed the very desire remember the man who come to brother brandom and said you know I I I I want the Holy Ghost I I read this little tract and something inside of me I went here seeking the Holy Ghost I went here seeking the Holy Ghost I went here seeking the Holy Ghost I want the Holy Ghost brother brandom how do I find the Holy Ghost and brother brandham tells him remember that moment when you read that track and something inside of you changed and you knew that it changed that's when you received the Holy Ghost am but we need a movement we need an activity we need a date we need a time we need no my brother and sister we need our hearts turned we need our hearts to just turn over and say I believe this word I believe this word this is the truth this is who I am there it is my brother and sister amen he saved what he could now these wise men bringing their gifts identified their gifts identified what it was that's the reason God protected those gifts through every move that they made he protected it until they arrived with those gifts because they were fitting for the time they were the ones in essence God used to manifest that that child that was Jesus Christ has come r the other day a man describing what prophecy fulfilled meant and I feel like he come fairly close to it but my brother and sister when the prophet of God took the word of God and opened it read between the lines opened all of this laid it out for us he told us there would be a bride on the earth at the coming of the Lord not rhetorical not not um oh what's the word that just jumped off my mind but a real bride let me just put it that way get down to Basics b a real breathing walking talking Bride on the earth that is there not to be redeemed see people sometimes say well you know we'll be redeemed in the Rapture my brother and sister you have been judged now amen you are not judged and redeemed in the Rapture or there you have already come into that position standing before Christ finished work I don't feel finished well it won't matter what you feel it's what God thinks amen it's What God Says amen now let me get back here amen huh wasn't the day made civilization great thing Ark was fitting to the word of God that he spoke that he'd destroy man but he saved we could okay yeah here we are now these wise men bring their gifts identified their gifts identified what it was and that's the reason God protected those gifts I already read that haven't I every move that they made he protected until they arrived with these gifts because they were fitting for the time does my church understand that brother Brown puts that out to them do you understand what I'm telling you eight people were fitting for days Noah's day amen all those of an age plus Joshua and Caleb were fitting for Crossing into the Promised Land there's a bride that's fitting right now she's here right now designed of God called of God and God is watching over her to bring her forth as a glorious bride amen not just somebody that believes a message let's get Beyond I believe the message as being some Benchmark I'm telling you I was called you were called We're bride my brother and sister he has made a promise he is coming back for a bride and if I can ever just get in gear here we'll get along amen I I'll just he will protect it until his purpose is served I'm glad of that now we go along here you see this gift that's in you it can't just be given to anybody sometimes we think that you know it almost be like you know a raffle or something you know we do that go get the flower little girl R raffle he loves me loves me not well I think you have to keep going around right it's correct I haven't done that before I'm not no no this is not something like that and then God just said oh look you win the lottery Lottery of Salvation no no God specifically you and chose amen the gift in you can't be given to anybody but look at this we're talking about praise my brother and sister we're talking about a bride who's coming in into a place that they are able to do this so you see it's the fruit of our lips amen our praise our worship is for Christ alone you see they it said there earlier in the quote I'm kind of dragging this out but earlier in the quote it couldn't be given to Elijah it couldn't be given to these others amen this fruit of our lips can only be given to Jesus Christ and that's why my brother and sister you'll find the struggle that's going on today when people start praising and lifting men up and up and up it's almost as though God is obligated to knock them off of the podium because that praise should be for our Lord Jesus Christ and no one else amen our God is a jealous God Amen Hallelujah let me jump forward here it's already time to quit and I'm not done amen look at this now I think to me okay if it's okay if I can just expr express it from the way I see it the fact that brother BR chooses to express this in the six seal has some significance to me and we won't go into time to explain that but you'll see paragraph 81 of course just like always I encourage you go back study what's way before this and way after this so we don't end up with something skewered she was barefooted she stopped She held her head down she seen who it was and she was very shy she knew this great person and she was just a cousin to these other girls their father was forming on this big armor outfit so they they kept she kept looking down she was ashamed of being barefooted and he said what's your name and she told him said why why ain't you out there to to the rest of them is and she kind of made excuses and so the next night he watched for her again finally he was sitting out there and they all got to carrying on everything and he sat on the the Corell fence and watched her to come throw the dishw waterer out and he watched her and he said to her he said you know my real purpose of being here I want you to put your spiritual thinking cap on the real purpose of our Lord Jesus Christ being here my brother and sister think on it amen it's not just to create an earth not to populate an Earth with animals and all kinds of species of plant it's not to do this and do that my brother and sister he had a purpose amen no sir I don't said my purpose of being here is hunting a wife I find character in you that they don't have I was thinking of the church you see this is the prophet's words I was thinking of the church there it is my brother and sister in the nutshell there it is he's here and he's looking for a bride amen he's not even really looking to do signs and wonders as it were so he could do but we know that to be a Healer someone had to be sick to be a redeemer someone had to be lost we know that we're we're Believers we study that but he said I was thinking of the church and said will you marry me can you remember that time come on Saints do you remember that time when he spoke to you and said will you marry me will you claim me as your bridegroom cuz I want to claim you as my bride oh how beautiful that is amen see me see how this is now some of you that grew up being Believers may be a little different effect in your life but I'm telling you some of us that were downright stupid and did things that we will not ever confess to man about my brother and sister to realize God speaking to us said I want you to be my bride that reaction me yeah amen it's real me oh but he said you amen I can't think of such a thing me see that's the main boss's son Lord Jesus Christ amen he owned all the companies and all the ranches throughout the country and everything you see said yes I couldn't find one in Chicago and I couldn't find one over here and I couldn't find one down here in this church I couldn't find one over in the Seminary I couldn't yeah I want a real wife well I I tell you what any young man in this
