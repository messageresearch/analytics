the Saints who are not here tonight touch each one father you know our circumstance an and the challenges of this life father I believe I can speak from my heart and say Lord we everyone father love you we give praise to you tonight the name of Jesus Christ amen well I know I'll probably got a few things um to do but we'll just start right over here on the left sorry to do it that way Sister Sarah I bring to you so many greetings uh it is just phenomenal I didn't know that we had such famous people in the church but uh and then having said that so that I don't have to repeat it repeat it I I come along to brother Sergey sister ulia H and the and the kids that there is just people that I don't even remember names saying oh we had such a wonderful time and I'm thinking okay I'll bring greetings but I don't even know who you are so that makes it difficult but anyway that part just lovely and greetings uh from the churches uh in Saskatoon in Edmonton to the assembly here I think I'll probably need to repeat that on Sunday to to get that but uh the Lord just give us such a blessed and wonderful time uh we got to see I want take the time tonight to explain all of that but we got to see such incredible I would say Supernatural things happen you know when you don't really know what to preach on you don't know what to speak on and Lord lays something on your heart and you find out that it is just the perfect thing for the moment and and I I just say you know I I don't want to overemphasize that but when you're sitting there literally a couple hours before service and you don't know what to preach on and then the Lord comes on the scene lays something on your heart and then it turns out to be just very relevant to the body so that's wonderful and to you young ladies there was a host of young people that were like do you think they will remember us and I don't remember their names so we won't know whether you remember them or not but many many greetings from many young ladies uh in Edmonton and so I just uh say God bless you I want to speak tonight Lord help us to be very prompt thank you for the beautiful music and uh I want to speak to you on the opening of the book brings complete Liberty and uh as we'll look at this nothing new my brother and sister I'm finding that in the preaching of the word it's just uh very hard to dress up some new Fantastic Revelation it is here that we are hearing the word of again and again and God is reinforcing to you and I that um uh we are a part of the body of Christ and he has been with us and will be with us to the end and uh everything that we need he's already provided and we look at this turn to Isaiah 6 61 I mean 61 1-3 and um in that we'll just look real quick at these three verses now when you think about uh a prophet of God and speaking the word of God you know sometimes they'll speak in in a a figurative sense as they are God speaking and that's awesome and there'll be times that they will speak as the prophet but there's times that then that they put themselves into the equation that they are just a part of the plan that God is giving or living out and here in Isaiah he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for this Spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified Lord we just bless your word this evening your name amen you may be seated as we look at this I I think we should just Place ourselves right here in in these verses my brother and sister that God has come and given to you and I uh in this acceptable year of the Lord he's come to comfort us he's come to uh help us and and to bind up our brokenhearted spirits but I really wanted to focus this evening on those words to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and as we look in the day that we are living my brother and sister it it is uh in many ways very similar to the time down through the ages of of what has happened we see that how that God has come the people cry for deliverance and God comes on the scene and brings Deliverance now the prophet of God said that you'll look down through time and see that every Church age you'll see that every anointing of those times would come to a place that God would then allow them to actually turn more to a denominational Spirit but we also see where the prophet of God said that in the day that we're living this anointed word now this word my brother and sister the critic is going to look at it as though it was brother bram's word but you see they don't understand how God they don't understand God and they don't understand how God works so this word that come down into this day and the prophet of God says that this word will not denominate amen so he's not talking about a message to an age but he's talking now about a message to a bride amen can you imagine we look at the whole Spirit of denomination they serve without real understanding there's not Revelation there and in a way not a real desire to find it now imagine a marriage such that a wife gets up every day and Cooks breakfast and because why do you do that because I have to pretty soon I hope that went over flat really flat we're talking not about you okay but you see what it is to see how people serve God if they looked at that in the natural life face to face they would not like the action reaction and atmosphere that that would bring and yet the denominational spirit is basically one I serve God because I have to and there we'll see how that God moving down Through the Ages has declared this will never become a denomination and it's there that we're starting I believe that we are starting to see the real fruit of that because the spirit of denomination wants to move in is a constant pressure that is trying to come in and cause you and I to come to a place that that we by by a mechanical reaction serve God but yet to see the real word coming to the real believer brings about a a desire that we no matter what as it is uh uh no matter what unfolds around us we have this desire inside to please God it's not about I feel obligated but it's this heart's desire of who we are now I'm going to make a little jump in statement here so please follow me I'm going you to understand the seventh seal is our Liberty it is not a Doctrine amen it is if it was a Doctrine we would be going towards denominationalism but the the seventh seal is our Liberty amen it would be the same as saying tonight Jesus Christ is our Liberty amen the opening of the seals was a revelation of Jesus Christ to you and I so many people look at it as though it's simply a Doctrine my brother and sister it is not it is Christ himself coming to you and I and he as we look at this as Isaiah was speaking we can claim this scripture now for our day to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and we certainly if there ever was a world live in a captive world we live in a world where people are caught up by all kinds of isms and sisms and and identity crisis we see it really coming out radically in the identity realm that that people just struggling and you know a child will struggle if the parent struggles and so when we see a world now in a giant IDE identity crisis it's actually because the parent had an identity crisis and you say but how did that uh person get an identity crisis because their parent had an identity crisis and by the grace of God we as Sons and Daughters of God are not immune from from struggles and strife and not immune from our children uh coming up uh into the age that they're kind of starting to recognize or see their identity amen and of what they want to be I had a lot of fun with the young ladies in Edmonton uh well actually even in sasun but the young ladies in Edmonton were were just this very open group of young girls and and you know I I had a lot of fun what do you want to be when you grow up I don't know I'll wait till I grow up and then I'll tell you and you know things like that and you're like yeah no that's a good reasonable answer amen why should we five six years before we have to come to adulthood could uh you know try to figure out everything talk to another young lady I've known what I want to do since I was 10 years old and you know so it's such a variety that is there I'd have to vote with the one when I grow up I might have figured it out but anyway you look at this and and see what is happening in our day this whole identity of of people and places and you know Edmonton looks just like NAA you go to town everything's the same Saskatoon looks just like Edmonton just like NAA just like Phoenix just like wherever because there's one Spirit my brother and sister on the Earth today uh uh well there there's more than one Spirit two spirits in the church right but just one Spirit on the negative and one Spirit on the positive and so you can go to the far reaches I've been to the Far Far depth of Patagonia uh Argentina you're out in the literal me middle of nowhere and you you see exactly the same clothes the same music everything happening one Spirit now look at this what God is doing he's coming along in this day and while uh Satan is uh taking a people he's got people that he's anointing and they're declaring their Liberty uh these people are are saying you know what I'm so glad I I'm uh uh free I heard a conversation uh this this last week we're out amongst the public and this this woman says oh you know I'm so glad to be free from those holier than thou people looking for freedom but look at us my brother and sister in the counterbalance of this I'm so free from the spirit of leoa and I say thank you Lord every side is searching for freedom and without the anointing of the Holy Ghost my brother and sister we would probably be trying to find Freedom from the holier than thou amen well actually we want to be free from them anyhow but their view of freedom from the holier than thou is freedom from anyone that would even talk in public about Jesus Christ that's the freedom from the holier than thou that they are looking at and in John 836 the scripture says if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed and we're looking at a world my brother and sister through entirely different lens than than the world here is uh because they're looking now uh uh uh going to church and these kind of things is no longer a freedom to mankind they actually view it as a bondage they're actually viewing the very presence or conversation of Jesus Christ as a bondage while the real believer a Christi Christian uh looks at this and says you know what I'm so thankful God has set me free that I can serve him amen and uh we'll just I want to move along quickly this evening not to keep everyone uh James 1:25 said but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty so if you're willing to look into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein in other words don't just look at it and pass on uh but continueth therein he being not a forgetful hear but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed and I say today that word is true we are blessed in our deed today God's got his hand of Mercy uh uh Upon Our Lives everything that we do amen so as you look here you want to look at Satan's work from the beginning for just a few minutes now from the very start Satan has uh decided he made his his stand to separate the people from the word at all cost he doesn't care what it is and and if just a very simple thing you can just look everything that there is every way possible Satan has anointed it to keep the people from the word of God because Satan himself actually has the revelation of Liberty in Jesus Christ and he wants to keep the world from that because he is not going to promote something that is is not his plan now we know that he is just a copycat everything there is out here when the world says that we have joy he's only trying to mimic the joy that God has given to Sons and Daughters of God uh when we are happy amen we have this brother Dwayne Fair uh took us to A A A Restaurant hotel that's on on the river there in town uh and it was a place that brother brother brandham actually preaches about and brother brandham says now uh you know they he said we met these girls on the street and uh they said something the order I was going to look the quote up kind of forgot but they're like Whoopi This Is The Life and uh in that tape you know that brother Brown saying see this is where they're caught because they think that's the life now these girls were drunk and very scantily dressed and saying this is the life my brother and sister but Sons and Daughters of God by the word when we are covered by the word clothed in the word we can kick our heels together and say this is the life aren't you glad tonight amen Satan promoting his plan but his plan was not for you amen God gave you a plan and that plan is what is holding you today and so Satan trying to separate at all cost every way possible now look at the world we live in today everything that you look out here in entertainment every this is this is Canada uh you know every Cafe every restaurant every whatever we sat down in had hockey on a screen playing now that's their sport they love it amen I told the brothers over and over again they're like what do you think brother Paul and I told them I said it looks like a fight has just broken out uh because that's that's the way it is you know and uh you look at that but you see there's billions poured into the entertainment all that entertainment is is to satisfy a soul that's empty amen I'm not speaking against Sports if people like sports a little bit that's fine but in the overall picture they're just trying to satisfy the emptiness in humanity and so it's there as they pour billions into this thing everything from stuff that we actually could enjoy to things that are so terrible that we would not even want to be Associated Satan pours billions into that and all it is is the distraction to fill the cup of people to keep them from seeing Christ that's all it is every one of these World distractions is just to keep people from having time and trying to satisfy they literally would rather be naked drunk walking down the street saying yippe this is the life than to stop amen but still you run into to some as we're on this trip uh we are there and uh we were sitting in a cafe and literally the waitress is like oh go ahead and pray I'll join in with you and uh kind you know a little different approach most people just act like it don't exist but this little lady she says nope I'm going to be right here and I'm going to be praying with you and so you see as the prophet of God said they actually have a hunger but they don't know how to satisfy it and uh we said here tonight and there shouldn't be one of us here tonight even in our Li limited group here that spiritually is hungry and would say I don't know how to satisfy it we have been given the open book we know how to satisfy that hunger and uh so Satan imagine this Satan's such a gracious guy he's trying to do you a favor and free you from the bondage of serving God let me help you get away from this see he must cringe at the words the Apostle Paul said I Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ he's out here trying to help people not end up in the same position that Paul was in he doesn't want them to be a prisoner because that's just not right I was Shar shared with me a a a uh video uh uh of somebody had filmed and and was sharing it on the internet H and I had no idea that you people were such naughty people I had no idea that you had such devious uh ways about you I had no idea that you needed to be governed by some kind of body to control you but yet that what they would promote directly talking of the message that you're all in bondage and you all need delivered and there needs to be an oversight to make sure that you can completely escape from this well I tell you I I didn't know what to say after I saw that I thought I had no idea that I was such a position but I tell you after pondering it for a little bit the last few days I've decided being a prisoner of Jesus Christ is much preferable than being a prisoner of Satan it it is just such a marked difference you can with eyes that are open right thank God we can see amen every prisoner to Satan pays a heavy toll now you'd say but but the word says yes the word says we have to die but my brother and sister we're going to die somewhere I'd rather die sooner than later amen some men's sins go before them and some follow I would rather my sins if there be stuff in my life that that is not dealt with correctly or a point there I'd rather the Lord bring that up to me tonight amen than be in the judgment and find out that I was a prisoner to the wrong one so you look how this is what the word is today my brother and sister this is influenced a little bit by this video I will admit because of a perception that the world's trying to to share or promote now look at this I I look at this and and what is Liberty we have to stop and identify what Liberty is to each one of us if Liberty is to do anything we want to do then if we want to do something that is outside the W word we need to stop and figure out where is the disconnect cuz even Satan knows the word he he even experienced the word in fact uh the prophet says he knows it better than you do he knows you better than you know you but what is that my brother and sister that we would find in the world today that you're such an oddity that you should be over overpowered by the spirit of leod deia but yet God is taking you completely a different direction what is that we are not literal prisoners we don't have handcuffs on we don't ride a bus to and from our prison but my brother and sister to truly catch the revelation of what the Apostle Paul was saying when he was saying I Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ Lord help us catch that Revelation amen not not my brother and sister to try and go back in history and delve in that because the very spirit that anointed Apostle Paul to say that in that day that same spirit is here today and it's impressing you might say or or it's around us leading us to be able to come one day and be able to say that whatever name you put I'm glad I can just repeat it I Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ not ashamed to be a prisoner now my brother and sister one thing I garnished out of this little video is um while they have focused upon the message they focused on the people of the message uh what they won't do is go focus on all the rest of the denominations because you see if they think they've dug up something against the message wow when they start digging in the spirit of leoda in the denominational Spirit but they're not going to go there because there is nothing to be gained because Satan has already LED them into what they believe is their Redemption now one thing that brother uh uh as we were looking in things talking about things brother Eugene one thing that he he laid out and I I I'll probably plagiarize him a little bit without going back and in into his own sermons but brother Eugene was pressing on this point and that point was it's only through the male or husband is their Redemption very very plain simple thought and you go through the Bible everything comes back to the man for Redemption now if the man himself will not pursue Redemption and he withholds the Redemption from his wife from his children brother Eugene has a unique way of speaking caught me so off guard I had to stop and shake my head a little bit he said Paul a man who won't bring Redemption to his family is evil I thought wow that's pretty strong words because you see under the headship of Jesus Christ that is that man's Duty now I want to ask you have we been brought as as the church that makes us female amen have we been brought Redemption amen God's grace and God's mercy in this generation the Lord come down and brought the word of redemption to us and made it relevant to our day relevant to our lives that we can stop today and truly say uh uh you know your name in there I am a prisoner to Christ because he has purchased my Redemption and I stand here today under that Redemption knowing his blood will cover me and in that how beautiful that is and uh so Satan wants you free from the bondage of serving God and if you stop and look at that in simple terms uh of our life every day everything that would pull us away from the word away from the word is Satan plain and simple if we just look at it not like oh this is a good movie this is good music this is good this these clothes are a little on the edge but no if you just stop and say you know what what's trying to pull me away today is Satan however he's masqueraded himself however he's presented himself to cut it right down to the simplest it's Satan yes because you see now I'm not picking on any sisters forgive me I'm I'm not preaching any clothesline but my brother and sister when you see a sister converted I met a few that have been serving the lord for very long at all and of course Pastor to pastor we get to kind of discuss a few things in the perspective of it and brother Eugene made a comment about a certain sister hasn't been saved all that long and he says you know not once have I had to preach how you should dress to this sister she gave her heart to the Lord she'd come into the assembly into the body of Believers and God did a real work in her life and she changed you see that's what God's doing he's clothing us amen he's not unclothing us I'm thinking of the word now bear with me he's he's the word has come to clothe us not unclo us and so we see how God working in this whole plan so it's the opening of the book my brother and sister that believe brings complete Liberty we don't even have freedom to really worship God until we can see what the book has for us and so it's there if uh uh uh Ephesians 3:1 if you want to look at uh that about uh the Apostle Paul being a prisoner now the Lord has provided remedy isn't this amazing even before we had cause or need of a remedy it was provided for us God's laid that remedy out before us and he says you know know what by my blood by my blood I will pay every debt that you have now if you thought about it in the natural and somebody says you know what I'm actually going to let you keep on being a debor until you catch the revelation of who you are in the natural you imagine that people would be just it's not my money but when we come to this place that we recognize who we are in Jesus Christ Christ and he pays every debt now I don't mean to to step down on anybody cuz I I would be right there with you but we are still collecting debts or creating let me say create not collect we're still creating debt in other words if I could say it really blunt the blood of Jesus Christ had to cover me today not back when I was some rank unbeliever this that and the other but he's covering me today everything that I have in the prophet of God you backslide daily so the blood of Jesus Christ is still right here the book is open and he's still purchasing our Liberty tonight amen I love that it's not a condemnation thing it's not something to frown about because this is the love of Christ to you and I that he loves us so much he continues to pay the debt and brings us right into full Redemption him being the male and the church being the female and he keeps coming and bringing Redemption just as we should in our own families and in the church itself we should be bringing Redemption amen when we see a church that stops bringing Redemption and brings law you're seeing a church that's out of balance with the word of God now look at this there's not a on size fits all in our spiritual life is there wouldn't that be nice if there was this one size fits all but I'm sorry some people are just strange they have whole different thing it's not just simple it's complex did you know that you can actually Trace complexes for Generations we get saved we think that's the end of the complex my brother and sister being saved is not the end of the complex it's when we are willing to die to our own self and only then now look this is kind of straightforward stuff when the complex when you submit that complex and it dies my brother and sisters Satan will offer you day after day week after week month and year uh uh opport to resurrect that complex but God wants you and I to go back in the book and he says you know what eat the book yes eat the book The Deliverance my brother and sister is in Eating the open book it's not in a a psychological type thing it's not in a I can power my way through this it's not it's my Daddy's fault or my mama's fault or it's my wife's fault or my husband's fault or people go crazy and and say it's their children's fault my brother and sister the fault is not eating the book and once the book was opened the remedy is personal inside of the book for you and I I don't have to go and say what's the average reaction of a message believer I can go in and dig into the word for myself and God Deliver us to be able to take the word for our everyday life now we're human so we have a lot of similarities and that's exactly where it ends see when the prophet takes us through the horse riders many people took that and said oh so this is from age to age oh we're seeing what happened there this is from age to age but do you realize the prophet of God was also revealing all of the spirits associated with those horse riders and coming down to the place see that's why it was so important that God corrected brother brandham when when he had his idea of what the horse riders were the Holy Spirit comes in corrects that because you see you need to recognize the devil that's trying to keep you out of the book you got to know what the devil is that's trying to close the book on you you see we don't have to have the book taken away from us my brother and sister but if the book is now closed we will not get the remedy that God has for us so the open book brings a complete Liberty amen but here look at this when you expose the move behind it it really helps us to understand what is the move behind it and I'm going to preach it very simplistic tonight it's just breaking of Fellowship it don't matter if we're talking in the spiritual realm or we're talking relationships in marriage relationships with children even relationship with us amongst our brothers and sisters Satan's all about breaking fellowship and so anytime now how do I say this I well just say it Paul anytime we create an atmosphere say in the church that breaks Fellowship that didn't come from God you can't even you can't even can I just be blunt you can't even and say well we're the more spiritual of the church and we don't want to be around the unbelief my brother and sister with that atmosphere that's not Christ amen that's Satan cuz he's trying to break fellowship and so you know when you Define fellowship you know the prophet of God said you know two guys one ship uh it doesn't matter if the guy's in the front or the back or the left or the right if he's in that ship God's got you in the same boat with them for a purpose in other words sometimes you know the young mothers as scripture says need to be schooled by the older sisters to school the younger sisters how often do old sisters and young sisters hang out together just in a natural sense right it's not a natural relationship in an overall sense young sisters with children well they kind of H hang out with young sisters with children vice versa but you look what God's doing he's trying to build a complete body in this church not a fragmented body but a complete body now you and I where we come into this equation besides being submitted to the word we have to willingly be partakers of creating a complete body and if we're not willing to be a part of complete body well as God would be if you won't do it God will bring someone in and put them into that position but you see when we talk about a complete body it's not just natural but we're looking at spiritual we need every single individual to be in their correct place now I don't know about you and I'm not speaking down to to anyone or any circumstance please misunder don't misunderstand me but you know lately I've been feeling like there's just a little something missing and maybe maybe it's me y'all don't have to shake your head you don't have to agree or nothing I'm just going to voice my thoughts something missing but did you know it could be just as simple as we're not willing to become one with each other we're not willing to come and bear one another's burden in other words they made the decision let them pay the price that's not the gospel what is the message my brother and sister what is the message is it just our family are for no more what what is the message is it all just a list of doctrines is it all that we dress right talk right look right what is the message we need to put Christ back in the messag and I'm not talking the doctrine side of it my brother and sister we need to put Christ back in it you'll know them by their love you'll know them by certain characteristics and and Satan is here to try to break that fellowship at all costs we don't have to have wrong Doctrine right we we don't have to go off into some Fringe Movement we don't have to do this but if Satan can rob the unity out of the body take the love out of the body of Christ we won't care about what happens to others I had a situation I won't go too deep in but a brother thanked me for what we had preached and one evening there in Canada and he says I didn't even see it but that's what I was becoming I was worried about my family and no one else and God dealt with him and that's a little bit why I chose to preach along these lines tonight is we've got to go beyond that what if Christ only came for those he wanted to care for and that list didn't include us and we lived right we believed the word we did everything but we weren't on the list you'd say well of course that's just that's not predestination or that's this and no brother I hope you catch what I'm saying maybe a poor analogy but you see we're the bride of Christ we are Christ's love expressed on the Earth Earth today so either we've missed it or Satan's been doing a really good job and it's time the Lord's now pushing back and saying I'm not going to let that be the culture you see those horse riders when the prophet laid that out as much he was exposing the movement behind the horse riders what they represented and yet those spirits still operate amen but the Lord's still exposing the spirits so by God's grace amen we can still moving now the holy spirit's still stirring people is he not amen if we let him if we let him he still does the work now here again finishing my little bit pointed statement forgive me if we feel service has been a little dry or there's been a little something we got to realize it's not what's wrong with what God's doing it's what we're not letting him do and as we look at that now I I just can't help but relate this to you in a service there was particular man come to the Altar and we spent time with him there praying and stuff and later the pastor says um that really was a move of God because otherwise because of who that man is you could not have pried him out of his Pew you could not have forced him to walk to the front and you could not have made him sit there in the altar cry out to God but how many times has God come and we just didn't feel like I just don't feel like responding I don't feel like walking up front to an altar I don't feel like praying through we don't feel my brother and sister I'm just pondering I wonder how many times we actually miss the moving of the holy spirit in our midst and then what scares me is how much influence did my attitude have on that Lord help us we got to come to the place we care so much about everyone in this church there's no family no individual of a higher value that we could come and when we see a family in distress we should become in distress when we see a family that's struggling through issues with children or Finance or whatever amen maybe you don't have the money to contribute to a better solution for them that way but you got prayers and they cost us nothing but our own will and when we will will ourself into their need then we help change the situation not exciting tonight is it but sometimes when the wheelbarrow gets full you have to take it somewhere amen I say God's still stirring his people amen and we see it it sometimes it's in very simple ways that God is stirring people well our our young people wow our young people are so rebellious you could at least smile I hope this doesn't hurt anybody's feelings but our young people are so rebellious around here but if we look in God's mirror we realize they're only reflecting us and we want to blame them I've just been blaming you brother Titus sister via so rebellious and then as parents we look in the mirror and all we see is a self-righteous picture but when God slides his word children are rebellious because that's the atmosphere they live in but we're not rebellious maybe I should leave that for another service but you see my brother and sister this is how close our action and reaction is and when the open word comes we need to be able to be open enough to receive the open Word word now I would say this figuratively uh how many of us would want to be completely free amen we want to have absolute complete Liberty in Jesus Christ then we have to set the stage to receive absolute complete Liberty or we can take it a bit here and a bit there and hope that it all comes together maybe tonight I'm just preaching what's been rattling around in my head I don't know but you see Satan would desire to replace a real experience with a religious experience amen and I'll tell you today when the book is open and God is working he replaces religious experiences with real experience amen exact opposites between the two now brother Bram says in the identified Christ of all ages but when you find Christian people where the holy spirit is no matter what nation or how far in the jungle or whatever it is they do the same thing you do when you receive the Holy Ghost they do the same thing they have the same Liberty they do they believe the same way and act the same way that any Christian does when he receives Christ and so I bring this quote to you in this context and I hope youall forgive me I'm I'm not trying to lean on you or maybe I'm leaning on myself but we'll visit somewhere and say my that church has such Liberty and it's just so open and loving why don't we ask ourselves what's missing from us not looking to see what they've got but look for what's missing for us because I'll tell you boy I hope this don't go back to Canadians we preached in some very wonderfully open Services where I just preach with such Liberty and they have kid problems and financial problems and they have all kinds of problems but what they're Desiring is a solution they're actually looking for God's personalized uh uh solution now I guess that's just the words that stuck in my brain to their life they're actively pursuing God's will in their life and they have Liberty now if we're not careful we get looking at our problems I know you guys don't have problems but other other people do but we get to looking at our problems and our problem consume us and it's really bad when our problem fringes into someone else's life and the easiest solution is to blame them I know you've never done that I remember years ago preaching a place down south and just mentioning some things like that of who has decided that somebody else's family is the fault and you know it's actually funny I say it as funny cuz I was remember well I'm standing you know down about like this and uh I'm looking down the church and sister over on this side and a sister over on this side and they just both turn and look at each other and I it's like I think we've identified the spirit but you know the beauty of it the Holy Spirit come in that that service and when that service was over as one sister walked out and went across the parking lot to her car the other sister pursued her and repented in the parking lot and before that was over they're out there holding on to each other just crying and wondering how it was that they allowed that Spirit but you see it's when the book is open we're able to start letting these things go and God starts to bring us into the correct position as long as we will not allow the open book to change our life we have these stries but when we come to a place we actually care enough about the brother or sister no when we actually come to the place we care enough about the word then we start to move forward and these things start to Fall Away we we sing the song These Chains are Gone amen well my brother and sister we want the chains gone let's let the open book bring complete Liberty to us and truly then our chains will be gone hallelujah amen I've got so much more here I think it's a preacher plague amen I just barely scratch the surface but I must have too much Amen in these last days God replaced a religious experience with a real experience can we say Amen to that amen not what felt right but literally coming to the place we recognize Christ in us see we can't say that we have a Christlike spirit and it's bitter right Bitter Water good water same well nope don't happen we've got to come to the place we recognize but the half I wanted didn't get to sorry comes down to this simple thought when we recognize not talk about sister V if you would come uh not talk about but truly recognize Christ in you it will change every single one of us we will no longer look at life the same when we truly honestly recognize Christ in you the hope of glory that's what the book says and the book is Christ Our Lord Jesus is sitting here tonight saying I want you just to take my spirit and that doesn't mean you always have to pamper someone but that spirit will change our life and I want for Grace Tabernacle for my own life my own marriage my own children my own grandchildren I want complete Liberty to be able to reach out as it were and just take a hold of the word and Pull It in and make it my own amen God bless you tonight we'll just stop at this point right here whatever it is amen hallelujah I had on my little list here just a couple songs but um there's a fountain open I think it's 392 brother Sergey amen there's a fountain open and I'm not looking for an altar call or anything tonight Saints and don't mistake this but I I want to climb in the fountain tonight I want God to deal with my heart for every every little thing that would be in there that doesn't line up perfectly with his word Lord let me step into the fountain tonight and just wash that away let everything that would hinder not just me but you see when we come come with the wrong Spirit about us it hinders everyone in the building and I want God to come wash me that I would hinder that I would that I would encourage you or influence you positive not negative not leave behind a bitter taste not leave behind a residue that needs to be dealt with but to come and that shakana glory to fall in our midst oh how I long for that we have wonderful Services here Saints and that's what I want them to be we don't want to come on one day and slug our way through it on another day come and feel the joy of the Lord we have the promised word we have the promised son he's
