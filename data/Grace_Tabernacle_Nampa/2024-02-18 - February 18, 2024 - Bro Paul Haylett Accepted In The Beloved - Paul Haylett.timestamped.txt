[33:57] amen isn't that
[33:59] precious you know there's just something
[34:02] about coming into the presence of the
[34:04] Lord that just breaks the feathers of
[34:06] the week breaks those things that would
[34:10] kind
[34:11] of bring our spirit down a little bit
[34:14] just kind of dampen but my brother and
[34:17] sister there's something about the
[34:18] presence of the Lord whether it's in the
[34:19] workplace in the car in the House Church
[34:23] wherever it is there you can just feel
[34:24] the burdens breaking away you can feel

[34:32] this morning to see each one of you I
[34:34] say God bless you visitors but there is
[34:37] no visitors in the kingdom of God We are
[34:40] family amen and I'm glad praise the Lord

[34:49] brother Steve and Sister Sarah back God
[34:52] bless you and sister Carol it has been
[34:57] a long long time God bless you amen such
[35:02] beautiful memories good
[35:04] times it's just good amen let's turn in
[35:08] our Bibles this morning I want to speak
[35:10] to you on a title of accepted and the
[35:13] Beloved and uh you know it's it's good
[35:17] sometimes you know we just find
[35:20] ourselves
[35:22] um you know just caught in a thought and
[35:25] you know you just kind of seem to to
[35:28] just find something in there that that
[35:31] attracts you that speaks to your heart
[35:34] before I get too much further I just
[35:36] want to give you a greetings from the
[35:38] Ashdown family um you know uh they just
[35:42] like we miss Idaho so I don't know if
[35:46] they missed the dirt out here that we
[35:47] call Idaho or they're missing you the
[35:49] Saints but anyway they send their
[35:52] greetings and um uh youth service this
[35:56] coming
[35:57] Friday uh the um uh Grace kids would be
[36:02] at brother Sergey and sister Julia's
[36:04] house and um then uh the young people
[36:09] will be here at the church amen and then
[36:13] I forgot to call you back brother Sergey
[36:15] but um I'm I'm assuming we're still good
[36:19] the Bible study at 5 o'clock this coming
[36:21] Sunday at brother Sergey and sister
[36:23] yulia's house and they're so gracious to
[36:25] open their home and and do that so just
[36:28] let's do something special for them
[36:30] maybe bring a little something so the
[36:32] burden's not all on them uh and uh maybe
[36:36] help clean up the mess and um I'll
[36:39] volunteer sister Jerry uh to help with
[36:42] those things uh but anyway we look
[36:45] forward to that and I I apologize Saints
[36:48] you know we got so busy going to Europe
[36:50] and all the things that have happened
[36:52] that we have not we kind of dropped the
[36:54] ball on Bible study but by God Grace we
[36:57] get back in the cycle and uh have those
[37:00] on a regular on a regular basis amen so
[37:04] I think we did announce about brother
[37:06] Ben uh his okay yeah uh we were
[37:10] fellowshipping with brother Ben last
[37:12] night when he received a phone call uh
[37:14] that his uncle had passed away and so uh
[37:18] certainly want to remember uh the um uh
[37:23] family and all of that amen 2
[37:27] Corinthians the 5th
[37:30] chapter verses
[37:33] 1-9 this really encouraged me when I
[37:35] read this Saints because uh we put so
[37:38] much value on this Earthly vessel here
[37:41] we put so much value on on this house
[37:45] here uh but to put the right perspective
[37:49] to approach it in the right way
[37:52] certainly this is a temple of the Holy
[37:54] Ghost this is a tabernacle God chose to
[37:57] dwell in in this day on the Earth but at
[37:59] the same token all this is is a shell
[38:03] that carries our soul right amen it is
[38:06] just the transportation as it were and
[38:10] um I I find it kind of cute I'm an
[38:13] analogy person as you well know but when
[38:15] you hear someone else with a good
[38:17] analogy you know you're like yep I like
[38:19] that and they they brought this down in
[38:22] this sense that um uh this body is just
[38:25] like a a transport for our soul and the
[38:30] older the car gets the more maintenance
[38:33] it
[38:33] needs and I thought yeah isn't that the
[38:36] truth the more it needs but the other
[38:40] side of it is it's carried us this far
[38:43] to the Lord and it will carry us all the
[38:46] way Amen to the presence of God Amen
[38:50] that it just harnesses death to take us
[38:53] into the presence of God some people get
[38:55] nervous about that but actually as a
[38:58] Believer our hearts Rejoice to know that
[39:01] we are one day closer Amen to the Lord
[39:05] to the presence of the Lord and um that
[39:08] should make us really happy that should
[39:10] make us excited amen you know uh you
[39:14] think about uh if you were given the
[39:17] opportunity to go back in
[39:19] time what time would it
[39:22] be and I just shared this with the young
[39:25] adults this morning
[39:28] um from quite a young age until my
[39:30] mid-30s I was very
[39:33] foolish so I don't want to go back from
[39:36] 15 to
[39:38] 34 those were my foolish
[39:41] years
[39:43] and I go back and look at that and face
[39:46] some of the struggles that we faced
[39:49] through those years do I want to revisit
[39:52] them I don't think
[39:54] so I think today
[39:57] is the day to praise the Lord today is a
[40:01] day to serve him with all of our hearts
[40:04] because today is the day that the Lord
[40:06] has given to you and I and I say let's
[40:09] just rejoice in that second Corinthians
[40:12] 5 1-9 for we know that if our Earthly
[40:15] House of this Tabernacle were dissolve
[40:18] we have a building of God a house not
[40:21] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[40:25] for in this we grown earnestly Desiring
[40:28] to be clothed upon with our house which
[40:30] is from Heaven if so be that being
[40:33] clothed we shall not be found naked for
[40:36] we that are in this Tabernacle do groan
[40:39] being burdened not for that we would be
[40:42] unclothed but clothed upon that
[40:45] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[40:48] now he that hath brought rought us uh
[40:51] for the self-same thing is God who also
[40:54] hath given unto us the earnest of the
[40:57] spirit aren't you glad you got that down
[40:59] payment and if we think about how
[41:01] glorious it is here under the anointing
[41:03] of the Holy Spirit what it will be in
[41:05] his presence amen hallelujah amen amen
[41:10] given that Earnest or down payment of
[41:11] the spirit therefore we are always
[41:13] confident knowing that whilst we are at
[41:15] home in the body we are absent from the
[41:17] Lord for we walk by faith not by sight
[41:21] we are confident I say and willing
[41:23] rather to be absent from the body to be
[41:25] present with the Lord wherefore we labor
[41:28] that whether present or absent we may be
[41:32] accepted of him Heavenly Father we just
[41:35] ask Lord for your blessing upon this
[41:37] time bless each one father I pray that
[41:40] we can go forth today with the presence
[41:42] of eternal life Lord that portion that
[41:46] you have given to us today May it move
[41:49] us stir us father cleanse Us in the name
[41:52] of Jesus Christ we ask amen you may be
[41:55] seated
[41:57] and so in looking at this
[42:00] scripture my real Focus would be there
[42:03] in verse 9 those last few words we may
[42:06] be accepted of him and all that matters
[42:10] you know to get there as we' look at the
[42:12] Journey of life we're not going to stand
[42:14] there in the presence of the Lord and
[42:16] remember the pain and the sorrow and the
[42:18] struggle of life we're going to just
[42:20] stand there with those words that he
[42:22] will speak to us cherished words well
[42:25] done my good and faithful servant that's
[42:27] going to be where our heart truly finds
[42:30] a rejoicing a Revival is in that
[42:32] presence amen and you know I believe
[42:35] these scriptures here Express the
[42:37] heart's desire of every Christian I
[42:39] believe when the Apostle Paul spoke he
[42:41] was anointed of the Holy Spirit to uh
[42:44] catch the very essence of what our
[42:46] relationship with the Lord means it's
[42:48] not just that we chose to be separated
[42:51] from the world we chose not to partake
[42:54] of their things and and their rituals
[42:56] and their traditions and their ideas but
[42:59] there was something inside of us we
[43:00] didn't place it there we could not place
[43:02] it there but he placed it in us and we
[43:05] are simply a response of the word that
[43:07] was planted in this age here and we
[43:10] would say well we we were Sinners and we
[43:13] were saved but God knew the exact second
[43:15] that that seed would sprout in your life
[43:17] and start to bring forth and so it's
[43:19] there that we realize how perfectly the
[43:22] plan of God is and you know as we look
[43:25] at this we find ourselves maybe when
[43:27] we're young uh uh it is it is maybe a
[43:30] little distant view but as we get older
[43:33] we start to realize truly what this plan
[43:36] of God was for us and how much we
[43:38] cherish that you know uh we we would
[43:41] come and be able to to witness or
[43:44] testify that um I I I don't long for my
[43:48] life to be a vapor but I do long to be
[43:51] in the presence of the Lord I I don't
[43:53] want to say that I would would um my in
[43:56] my flesh especially look forward to
[43:58] passing uh from this life tomorrow but
[44:01] at the same token I know as I pass from
[44:04] this life I pass into eternal life and
[44:07] it's coming into that presence of the
[44:09] Lord that is like the great magnet
[44:10] pulling us forward and Satan well he
[44:13] doesn't have to get us to believe a
[44:15] false Doctrine he doesn't have to get us
[44:17] to do a lot of things he just has to
[44:20] muddy up the water enough to keep us
[44:22] from realizing what our real true call
[44:26] in is amen I I tell you I might sound a
[44:30] little harsh today my brother and sister
[44:32] the church was not called for a Super
[44:34] Bowl party the church was not called for
[44:36] a soup supper and a bingo party and and
[44:39] Bunko and a this and a that and be
[44:41] politically activated the church was
[44:44] called to be a place where Sons and
[44:46] Daughters of God come in and they bring
[44:49] their lick of fire and it turns into a
[44:51] great fire and it has created a spirit
[44:55] where people can can come and cast off
[44:57] the cares and the chains of life and
[44:59] find some Liberty as it is now we should
[45:02] have Liberty without having to come to
[45:05] church but there is something in the
[45:07] essence of coming in the house of God
[45:09] and seeing those you love and joining
[45:12] together with them to sing songs of
[45:14] praise and say Amen to the word amen
[45:17] hallelujah and so it's there that we'll
[45:19] realize the Apostle Paul I believe
[45:22] caught the very essence of that and what
[45:24] our real desire was and the struggle
[45:28] amen of the struggle my brother and
[45:32] sister you think about this and it makes
[45:35] sense naturally but we're more specific
[45:39] to the spiritual but you know in the
[45:41] natural you should be looking to the
[45:45] Future you don't just look to today my
[45:48] brother and sister we look to the
[45:51] Future because you see if you look just
[45:54] to today and today is a day for
[45:58] you then you're going to have your
[45:59] Christian experience marked as a bad
[46:02] experience but when you look to the
[46:05] Future and realize the very seed of God
[46:08] planted in your
[46:10] theophany before the foundation of the
[46:13] world says you're mine and you will be
[46:16] there in my presence you'll be there at
[46:18] the Sea of Crystal you'll be standing
[46:20] Before the Throne you'll worship me for
[46:23] eternity amen you'll realize today is
[46:27] nothing more than a blip of time that's
[46:30] right something that is so little it
[46:33] does not matter now my brother and
[46:35] sister if you don't mind me going off
[46:38] into this little Avenue you know a few
[46:40] years ago I was sitting with my banker
[46:42] and this sounds very carinal please
[46:44] forgive me and catch the spiritual point
[46:47] and and I was saying to the banker you
[46:49] know that I I was a little discouraged
[46:51] because the bottom line had not been
[46:54] changing for several years it it seemed
[46:56] like we were treading water if you
[46:58] understand that term and and uh my
[47:00] banker said you know Paul don't worry
[47:02] about it he said we've done the research
[47:05] as a bank we've done the research and
[47:07] it's between this age and this age that
[47:10] you'll truly make the most money in your
[47:13] life now my brother and sister this
[47:15] sounds like I'm I'm preaching some go
[47:17] Prosperity Gospel to you but I I hope
[47:19] you catch this my brother and sister I
[47:22] hope you catch this he said you know it
[47:24] will be somewhere in your late 40s to
[47:27] early 50s till 66 67 years old you will
[47:32] gain the most wealth that you will ever
[47:34] gain in your life he says so don't get
[47:37] discouraged look to
[47:43] tomorrow and I
[47:46] realize as we go through this life as
[47:49] young people we can have ups and downs
[47:52] we can have struggles and it it seems
[47:54] like Lord I failed you
[47:57] and we get
[48:00] discouraged and I'm not trying to put an
[48:02] age
[48:03] limit but I'm telling you the further
[48:05] you get into this relationship with the
[48:08] Lord the greater the intrinsic value of
[48:12] that relationship comes to
[48:14] you it's not about the ups and downs of
[48:17] our our early experience it's not about
[48:20] the ups and downs of our mid experience
[48:23] but it when it comes to the end of our
[48:26] whether young or old my brother and
[48:27] sister there's where the intrinsic value
[48:30] of this relationship starts to Blossom
[48:32] before us and we start to realize all
[48:35] these years God has been investing in me
[48:38] and now I get to as a mere
[48:41] mortal Express back to him that's right
[48:45] our appreciation for everything he's
[48:48] done and we would not know a good time
[48:51] if we had not experienced a bad
[48:54] time we would not not know healing
[48:57] unless we had been sick am we would not
[49:00] know Salvation unless we realize we've
[49:04] been
[49:05] lost my brother and sister how beautiful
[49:07] this is God the whole time placing this
[49:09] in us and as this intrinsic value starts
[49:12] to grow in us and we go through hard
[49:14] trials you go through a struggle and
[49:17] what God has changed in US is not that
[49:19] we doubt for weeks and months and years
[49:22] whether we're saved or not but we can
[49:24] stop and say Lord your Holy Spirit moved
[49:27] upon me and I know that wasn't the right
[49:29] reaction I know that wasn't the right
[49:31] words I know that wasn't the right
[49:32] attitude forgive me Lord and then we
[49:35] just continue to move on it's no longer
[49:38] a roadblock it is a pause a blip of time
[49:43] that we can say Lord thank you that you
[49:45] love me enough to correct my heart amen
[49:49] chastening my brother and sister is of
[49:51] Great Value it has it has a value like
[49:54] man measur is gold but chastening has
[49:57] that kind of value to Sons and Daughters
[49:59] of God that we could stop and say just a
[50:02] second Lord I need to unload this
[50:04] feeling this emotion this condition I
[50:07] need to just set it aside so that I can
[50:09] move on in the fullness of the
[50:11] revelation of Jesus
[50:13] Christ we talk about the revelation of
[50:16] Jesus Christ my brother and sister but
[50:17] if it doesn't change us we don't have a
[50:20] revelation we cannot go on in our same
[50:24] human behavior and say I've got the Holy
[50:27] Ghost but nothing ever changes because
[50:30] the presence of God will change us it
[50:31] calls Isaiah it caused Isaiah to say
[50:35] take a coal
[50:37] Lord these lips of mine it caused God to
[50:41] speak to Moses and say this is Holy
[50:43] Ground and Moses took his shoes off it
[50:47] takes us my brother and sister to a
[50:49] place that it would be as Joshua coming
[50:52] and he sees a a man as it were before
[50:55] him him he doesn't say well I don't know
[50:57] what I'm going to deal with this I'm
[50:59] just going to move away from this but
[51:01] Joshua is so anointed of who he was what
[51:03] he was called to do he draws his sword
[51:06] and says are you a friend or are you a
[51:08] foe and if we would measure the spirits
[51:11] of leod deia are you a friend or are you
[51:14] a foe our life would be much simpler
[51:17] that's right cuz either moving
[51:20] forward or we're moving back
[51:24] exactly
[51:28] I think it's so wonderful that God is
[51:29] gracious to
[51:33] us I hope you understand me this
[51:39] morning God gives us the ability to
[51:42] measure our relationship with him that's
[51:45] it now this is not for me to say well
[51:48] I'm a spiritual man I'm this I'm that
[51:51] but it's there that God by moving on us
[51:54] anointing us we start to realize and and
[51:57] we realize in the sense that you know
[51:59] what I've got room I got to
[52:01] grow now have you ever had a flower or a
[52:05] plant uh and you you plant that remember
[52:08] young people when we did the little deal
[52:10] with the corn and some you know uh some
[52:14] it just kind of was a a good point that
[52:16] we wanted to make to you but you know
[52:19] some of us we we kept planting our corn
[52:21] into a little bit bigger uh pot and um I
[52:26] took it maybe more serious than some of
[52:28] the young people did but you know you
[52:31] leave that little corn plant by the time
[52:33] he got about that tall we had him in
[52:35] this little pot and finally we decided
[52:37] okay enough of this we're we're kind of
[52:39] done babysitting this corn plant but
[52:41] when we pulled that out of that PO pot
[52:44] uh that little plastic thing the last
[52:45] time I don't know if you'd call it a pot
[52:47] or whatever but we pulled it out of
[52:49] there my brother and sister it was
[52:52] nothing but a mass of
[52:54] roots
[52:56] God never called us to be rootbound
[52:58] Christians he never called us to stay in
[53:01] our little world our our little
[53:02] denomination our little ideology our
[53:05] little thought until we're rootbound
[53:08] amen it was kind of amazing cuz I should
[53:10] have known better being a farmer but you
[53:12] know when we popped that out of there
[53:14] and I looked at that and I I kind of
[53:16] thought to myself where'd the dirt go
[53:18] because this thing was nothing but Roots
[53:20] but you see that plant could have never
[53:22] brought itself to maturity in that
[53:26] environment amen God wants you to spread
[53:29] your wings he wants you to take the word
[53:32] he wants you to step out and say you
[53:34] know what I was called a Son of God I
[53:37] was called as a daughter of God to step
[53:40] into the Rapture not crawl into the
[53:42] Rapture not beg myself into a Rapture
[53:45] not cry myself into a Rapture but stand
[53:48] up as a strong Christian filled with the
[53:51] Holy Ghost and say Satan get behind me
[53:54] I've been called to the Rapture I hear
[53:57] the word I hear the word I hear the word
[54:00] and I'm following the word right cuz we
[54:04] can get root Bound in our own concept of
[54:07] the message we can get root Bound in our
[54:09] own concept of Christianity we can get
[54:12] rootbound my brother and sister in our
[54:15] complex that's exactly right but God
[54:17] said I've set you free and he's been set
[54:19] free is free indeed amen let it go let
[54:23] it reach out take a to these things of
[54:26] the word of God that we can move
[54:29] forward that's right
[54:35] amen if you have an LG
[54:39] appliance the rumor that went through
[54:41] the whole world was that LG stood for
[54:44] life as
[54:45] good when they started that company they
[54:48] didn't think about life is good they
[54:51] just had a purpose but I'm here to tell
[54:53] you life is good amen I'm glad I'm
[54:56] living this morning amen this word that
[54:59] I just read scripture I read to you I
[55:01] want to be in the presence of God I want
[55:03] to stand Before the Throne I want to go
[55:06] and I want to be ready to go but at the
[55:08] same token in our Humanity we hold on to
[55:11] life we cherish it
[55:15] amen and so why don't we make the best
[55:17] of it while we're
[55:19] hereall
[55:21] testify that's it well
[55:25] die just live it that's it your life

[55:29] testify you don't have to stop we
[55:32] mentioned this to the young adults there
[55:34] you don't have to go out on the corner
[55:35] and tell everybody that goes by if you
[55:38] don't believe you're going to
[55:40] hell I don't know that that's always the
[55:43] right way to present the gospel my
[55:44] brother and sister there's no love
[55:46] there's no Redemption it is more of a
[55:49] fear being struck into the hearts of
[55:51] people I don't want Grace Tabernacle to
[55:53] have fear in their heart I want them to
[55:55] have a joy that they were called to
[55:58] serve god with everything that was
[55:59] within them there shouldn't be a fear
[56:02] other than the reverence of God there
[56:04] should not be fear in us there ought to
[56:06] be Liberty to say Thank You Lord that
[56:09] you wrote my name in the book before the
[56:11] foundation of the world and now I get
[56:14] the privilege to manifest your
[56:16] confidence in me your word in me your
[56:19] life in me I get this privilege to live

[56:26] as we'll shout and say Amen to that yes
[56:29] sir we have to turn around and say
[56:31] sometimes it's hard
[56:33] that's sometimes it's a great battle and
[56:36] we wonder could this really be what I
[56:39] was called to but I'm here to tell you
[56:41] this is what God called you to amen
[56:43] there won't be a person standing Before
[56:46] the Throne that has not scars that's

[56:51] wonderful amen and your testimony

[57:05] Apostle Paul and a few others would
[57:07] stand up and say you're counterfeit amen
[57:10] that's exactly you're not the real
[57:13] thing because this is a battle this is
[57:17] Warfare amen you're going to have some
[57:20] uh scars of fiery
[57:22] darts you're going to have those times

[57:28] might well be scars upon your heart upon
[57:31] your breast that we spe there as Satan
[57:34] tried to put his his uh sword and try to
[57:37] drive it into your heart to cause
[57:39] bitterness to take over but God come on
[57:41] the scene and he says let me put the
[57:43] bomb of Gilead upon you let my spirit be
[57:46] upon you let my life be upon you let
[57:49] healing virtue flow through
[57:52] youall and we rise up once again Amen to

[1:01:01] in church that living out our natural
[1:01:05] desire it really is who we are
[1:01:09] right if you don't mind I'm trying to
[1:01:11] break this habit but it just kind of
[1:01:14] kind of is hard you know how long I'd
[1:01:17] last in brother Trevor's Barber
[1:01:22] Shop how you here s your ear
[1:01:28] another one I've already cut one head of
[1:01:31] hair today what do you mean I got to do
[1:01:32] it
[1:01:35] again but I don't know how long brother
[1:01:37] Trevor would last out there at 3.8 mil
[1:01:41] an hour going down the
[1:01:46] field might last longer than I think I
[1:01:48] don't know be hard to
[1:01:51] judge but you see we have to recogn ize
[1:01:55] what God called us to in the
[1:01:57] natural some of you love to cook I love
[1:01:59] to eat your
[1:02:02] cooking some of you don't like washing
[1:02:05] dishes I love creating dirty
[1:02:07] dishes but you see we we all have this
[1:02:10] Niche that God's called us to and we
[1:02:13] can't all be Apostles and we can't all
[1:02:15] be prophets and we can't all be
[1:02:16] evangelists and we can't all be pastors
[1:02:19] but my brother and sister every one of
[1:02:21] us is necessary for the body of Christ
[1:02:23] for the kingdom of God to function it
[1:02:26] takes every single one of us and
[1:02:28] sometimes what we see as an envil in to
[1:02:32] Envy a
[1:02:34] position oh man must be nice I'm here to
[1:02:38] tell you it's not as nice as you think
[1:02:39] it
[1:02:40] is it's not as comfortable as you think
[1:02:43] it
[1:02:44] is people call you up and share things
[1:02:47] that you don't want to
[1:02:48] hear ask you to act upon things you
[1:02:51] don't want to act upon amen amen amen
[1:02:54] but I tell you what it's just as hard if
[1:02:58] you want to call it that just being a
[1:03:01] sheep that comes to church that's it
[1:03:03] faithful that's right week in and week
[1:03:05] out worship God and think why doesn't
[1:03:09] the pastor do
[1:03:12] this that can be difficult can't it come
[1:03:16] on let's be honest with ourselves not
[1:03:18] every one of you agree with
[1:03:20] me some of you can disagree with a smile
[1:03:23] some of you don't even realize you're
[1:03:25] frowning that's exactly right but the
[1:03:28] truth of it is God makes it work amen
[1:03:31] it's not man it's not this man or that
[1:03:33] man or this family or that family it's
[1:03:36] God that can bring a group of people
[1:03:38] together bring Harmony amongst them
[1:03:41] bring the liberty of the moving of the
[1:03:42] Holy Spirit amongst them and we still
[1:03:45] get to do what we
[1:03:50] want are you with me
[1:03:53] yes
[1:03:58] I feel sorry for people that feel
[1:04:00] compelled to have to ask the pastor to
[1:04:02] do everything in their life can I take a
[1:04:04] vacation can I buy a car should I buy a
[1:04:07] house now if you're asking to buy the
[1:04:08] house as in pray with me then I say ask
[1:04:12] that's right amen but if you want me to
[1:04:14] make the decision for you amen you might
[1:04:17] not like my
[1:04:19] decision amen flee the city move to the
[1:04:22] country have a chicken have a hog have a
[1:04:25] calf but some of you say we don't want
[1:04:27] that well okay do it anyhow I'm the
[1:04:33] pastor it's not how it works God gives
[1:04:36] you Liberty to live your life he gives
[1:04:38] you Liberty to chase your desires amen
[1:04:41] this not talking of the spiritual this
[1:04:43] is this flesh man he gives you Liberty
[1:04:45] to do that and because we love the Lord
[1:04:48] and believe his word we put him first
[1:04:50] and somehow it is blessed amen amen even
[1:04:54] our mistakes it's blessed Hallelujah so
[1:04:57] look at this now
[1:05:00] amen we just have to be careful that our
[1:05:03] thoughts are the Lord's
[1:05:06] thoughts how many times I hope this
[1:05:08] doesn't hurt anybody but how many times
[1:05:10] has Humanity said the Lord told me to do
[1:05:13] this and this and then in a day week
[1:05:16] month year 5 years 10 years they're like
[1:05:21] NOP this is no
[1:05:23] good Lord oh this might hurt I'm sorry
[1:05:26] but it's about the Perfect Analogy Lord
[1:05:27] told me to marry that woman five years
[1:05:30] later I think she's Anointed with a
[1:05:32] devil and I tell you what I have got get
[1:05:35] rid of her so I can go get a real Holy
[1:05:38] Ghost filled wife wait just a second you
[1:05:41] you said the Lord told you to marry her
[1:05:43] five years ago and now she's turned into
[1:05:46] a devil maybe you helped
[1:05:49] her that's it maybe you caused it maybe
[1:05:53] she's not the problem maybe you are the
[1:05:59] problem you see how we're always looking
[1:06:01] trying to Shuff will always do but you
[1:06:03] know what when our thoughts are God's
[1:06:06] thoughts and God's thoughts are our
[1:06:08] thoughts when God says I want you to do
[1:06:11] this or he places someone in our life
[1:06:13] husband wife you know sometimes I
[1:06:15] remember a brother and sister one time
[1:06:17] told me said we just don't understand
[1:06:18] you know we've been serving the lord
[1:06:20] since we were teenagers they met just as
[1:06:21] kids in the church we've been serving
[1:06:23] the lord since we were just teenagers
[1:06:25] and and we just lived our whole life and
[1:06:27] it seems like God allowed the devil to
[1:06:30] give us
[1:06:37] children and I thought you know I might
[1:06:39] not ever preach in this church again so
[1:06:41] I'm just going to feel free to give
[1:06:43] advice uh
[1:06:45] brother if there's devil in your
[1:06:47] children you brought it in the house
[1:06:49] that's it amen and it'll be up to you to
[1:06:52] throw it out that's righten
[1:06:54] don't be tossing your kids okay I'm
[1:06:56] sorry your kids are smoking pot and
[1:06:58] drinking and crawling out the window
[1:07:00] almost every night and whatever else but
[1:07:02] I'll tell you what when you become
[1:07:04] subject to the word they'll become
[1:07:05] subject to you and the word oh you think
[1:07:09] so brother Paul no I don't think so you
[1:07:12] don't I know
[1:07:14] so I don't need to think it get the
[1:07:18] garbage out of the house Amen in the
[1:07:20] message thirst brother Brenham says it's
[1:07:22] brings it right around whatever you're
[1:07:23] feeling on that's it oh Lord help us
[1:07:26] that makes all of us in a way guilty
[1:07:28] right we all have some little something
[1:07:30] that you know it might be I remember one
[1:07:32] time a brother told me he said oh I I
[1:07:35] don't you know I just don't like to do
[1:07:36] any questionable things and and you know
[1:07:38] we sat there in his house and he he had
[1:07:41] outdoor life filled in stream and
[1:07:44] whatever and I made some comment and his
[1:07:45] wife pipes up from the kitchen he
[1:07:48] doesn't read the
[1:07:52] Bible
[1:07:55] I thought Lord I need to pray for that
[1:07:56] sister's
[1:08:02] safety but something checked that man
[1:08:05] amen and he said it's the truth and I
[1:08:07] got to change yes sir that's it and it
[1:08:11] wasn't that he got to change he did
[1:08:13] change that's the beauty of this
[1:08:17] gospel it took a mouthy I mean I mean a
[1:08:20] sister
[1:08:22] uh
[1:08:25] but you see the truth of it was it was
[1:08:27] the right words at the right
[1:08:30] time I don't think we're going to make a
[1:08:32] doctrine of shaming you into the
[1:08:35] Rapture but sometimes the truth just has
[1:08:38] to be
[1:08:40] spoken sometimes we have to
[1:08:44] realize Satan is so
[1:08:47] clever if he can keep us from being
[1:08:50] accepted in the Beloved that's it right
[1:08:52] there keep us distracted
[1:08:54] distracted never tell a lie never lust
[1:08:57] In the Flesh never have a temper never
[1:09:00] have any of these
[1:09:01] things but not in the word that's
[1:09:05] it Satan's still one Amen to be accepted
[1:09:10] in the Beloved my brother and sister we
[1:09:12] need to make sure our thoughts align
[1:09:14] with the Lord's thoughts amen now I'll
[1:09:15] give you an example I'm sorry I don't
[1:09:17] want to keep you too late here I'm
[1:09:18] burning up time but if if you was you
[1:09:21] don't need to turn but if you was to
[1:09:22] turn your Bible to number 23 24 right
[1:09:25] through that region you'll see there
[1:09:27] it's this story talking about balam's
[1:09:29] struggle and trust me my brother and
[1:09:30] sister it was a struggle for balum balum
[1:09:33] wanted the position over here but he had
[1:09:36] enough of God in him he kept going back
[1:09:38] and asking God but the desire to be
[1:09:40] accepted and receive the the benefits of
[1:09:43] that was greater and the more he went
[1:09:46] back to man's idea the more he went back
[1:09:49] to what he thought was right amen the
[1:09:53] farther the word got from him until
[1:09:55] finally he comes to a place he starts
[1:09:57] out I won't curse God's people that's
[1:09:59] right no way I'll curse God's people oh
[1:10:02] we'll add another you know nicer thing
[1:10:04] and another thing and another gift and
[1:10:06] another whatever for you and the more he
[1:10:08] went back finally God says you know what
[1:10:10] I know what the desire of your heart is
[1:10:13] so you know what balam I will not give
[1:10:15] you permission go back study your Bible
[1:10:18] God never said go ahead and curse
[1:10:21] Israel he told him
[1:10:24] I give you or Grant to you the desire of
[1:10:27] your
[1:10:29] heart what is our desire today that's it
[1:10:32] if the Lord come down today and said I
[1:10:34] grant to you the desire of your heart
[1:10:36] Lord I pray it won't be wealth or fame
[1:10:38] or anything of this world here my
[1:10:41] brother and sister I pray that the very
[1:10:42] thing that would come from us would be
[1:10:44] Lord I want more of you I need more of
[1:10:47] you Lord I I just need to come Lord let
[1:10:50] the word correct me bring me in your
[1:10:52] presence Lord that's exactly right and
[1:10:55] look where balum ends
[1:10:57] up same
[1:10:59] altars same
[1:11:01] sacrifice same worship that's it same
[1:11:05] songs
[1:11:10] mostly because you can sing the same
[1:11:12] song with a different Spirit that's it
[1:11:14] and create a entirely different
[1:11:17] atmosphere that's the truth amen that's
[1:11:20] right if that wasn't the case you could
[1:11:22] take some of these country singers and
[1:11:24] some of these rock singers and whatever
[1:11:27] that sing Amazing Grace and you could
[1:11:29] play it in church and create the same
[1:11:31] atmosphere but you see it wasn't
[1:11:34] necessarily the
[1:11:36] music as it was the spirit that's it
[1:11:40] that's it and when that Spirit anoints
[1:11:42] them you got Dolly Parton I'm sorry for
[1:11:44] name and names you got Dolly Parton
[1:11:46] singing Amazing Grace and How Great Thou
[1:11:49] Art you've got to rock
[1:11:52] stars look
[1:11:54] sorry this some of this is from my youth
[1:11:56] and sometimes it just crops up you know
[1:11:58] and I I have to read the article because
[1:12:00] I I need to make a little connection
[1:12:03] Alice Cooper is now a
[1:12:04] Christian and if you don't know who
[1:12:06] Alice Cooper is well don't go look him
[1:12:09] up but I'm telling you he doesn't look
[1:12:11] any different than he did before and
[1:12:13] doesn't behave much different than he
[1:12:14] did before but he's now a
[1:12:16] Christian got religion that's exactly
[1:12:19] right now what atmosphere will it be
[1:12:22] when they sing Amazing Grace that's it
[1:12:25] it will not be the atmosphere that Sons
[1:12:28] and Daughters of God singing Amazing
[1:12:30] Grace create in the sanctuary s create
[1:12:33] in the house in the car wherever it
[1:12:36] might be so you see how these spirits
[1:12:38] come in and they anointed and uh balum
[1:12:40] keeps coming back until God says here I
[1:12:43] give you the desire of your heart and he
[1:12:45] goes out there he's got the right altars
[1:12:47] he's got the right sacrifice he's got
[1:12:49] all the foundation of Praise but
[1:12:51] everything behind it was a deception I
[1:12:54] everything behind it was a curse amen
[1:12:57] and there was no way when he come back
[1:12:59] in the presence of God that God would
[1:13:01] tell
[1:13:02] him well done that's
[1:13:05] right not a
[1:13:08] chance but Israel's problem is Israel
[1:13:11] stepped out and said well I see in the
[1:13:15] church
[1:13:17] ages I see that I see
[1:13:21] seals I see this I see this
[1:13:23] it must
[1:13:26] be what is the
[1:13:28] spirit behind it that's exact what is
[1:13:32] moving
[1:13:34] this now I'm going to get off this real
[1:13:36] quick but I want to say this If you flew
[1:13:38] right back into the book of numbers and
[1:13:40] stood there that day you would not find
[1:13:42] fault in the mechanics of their worship
[1:13:45] that's exactly it right
[1:13:47] there are you with me that's from
[1:13:50] showing up to church on time pay their
[1:13:53] tithe doing this and doing that reading
[1:13:56] their Bible all of these things you
[1:13:58] wouldn't find fault with the mechanics
[1:14:00] but my brother and sister the right
[1:14:02] Spirit was not in it it could never
[1:14:04] produce what the word said it would
[1:14:07] produce and so we have to have the mind
[1:14:10] of God we have to be in the word and in
[1:14:13] the right Spirit coming in there and
[1:14:15] when we do that we have seen this how
[1:14:17] God works in miraculous ways how his
[1:14:19] presence comes down and moves in our
[1:14:21] midst what's the difference
[1:14:24] amen what's the
[1:14:26] difference some
[1:14:28] people can't see the difference that's
[1:14:32] right some people sense there's a
[1:14:34] difference but don't know why that's
[1:14:36] right but revelation of the word that's
[1:14:38] it shows a bride that's right amen a son
[1:14:42] or daughter of God says look how close
[1:14:45] they came that's it they came so close
[1:14:48] but they could not reproduce the word
[1:14:51] that's oh my brother and sister
[1:14:53] you can oh I I'll I'll get caught off in
[1:14:56] analogy here amen hallelujah see so look
[1:15:00] at that we got to see the difference
[1:15:02] between man's desire and God's desire
[1:15:05] once again here the other day got a
[1:15:07] little text a little deal about how um
[1:15:10] that um you this is the this is 10 ways
[1:15:13] you can increase the attendance of your
[1:15:16] church and uh boy you know of course I
[1:15:18] just jumped right on
[1:15:21] that now I don't know who's volunteer
[1:15:23] but the very first now get this I want
[1:15:25] you to think about this the very first
[1:15:28] thing they put up as a way to increase
[1:15:30] the attendance of the church is to have
[1:15:32] one of you Brothers out in the parking
[1:15:34] lot greeting them and giving them the
[1:15:36] paper that outlines today's
[1:15:40] service we don't know what's going on
[1:15:42] one minute to the
[1:15:46] next I mean I must admit I was
[1:15:48] disappointed brother Alex didn't submit
[1:15:50] the song service songs for approval
[1:15:59] really some of you'll like the next
[1:16:03] one you should provide coffee and a
[1:16:07] light
[1:16:11] dessert my brother and sister do you see
[1:16:14] where religion has gone
[1:16:18] yeah it now I've wore this out but I'll
[1:16:21] wear it out one more time it takes to
[1:16:23] get you to come to the house of God is
[1:16:25] what it will take to keep you in the
[1:16:26] house of God so if we start with the
[1:16:28] word we can finish with the word we
[1:16:32] don't have to bring some kind of a
[1:16:33] gimmick or some kind of a program we'll
[1:16:36] start with the word and we will finish
[1:16:38] with the word and the seed that's in
[1:16:41] Sons and Daughters of God will be
[1:16:43] attracted to the word and when they hear
[1:16:46] and get their teeth in the delicacy of
[1:16:48] that beautiful dessert called the word
[1:16:51] that's it they will say I'm coming back
[1:16:54] that's exactly
[1:16:57] right imagine a Sunday without the donut
[1:17:02] man well I'll tell you what if that's
[1:17:04] the way this church is going to be I'm
[1:17:05] done with
[1:17:09] them we attended or an event at a
[1:17:14] church actually that was a funeral
[1:17:16] wasn't it but it was a regular thing
[1:17:19] just a
[1:17:21] different different vendor
[1:17:28] yeah signs on the door don't eat in the
[1:17:36] sanctuary Ah that's good words
[1:17:39] preacher oh I'm out of coffee get
[1:17:42] up slam the door come
[1:17:45] back where's a
[1:17:48] reverence is God going to look down and
[1:17:50] say Well done
[1:17:54] you bought the best coffee maker there
[1:17:56] is you have the best donuts there is
[1:17:59] well done no my brother and sister God's
[1:18:02] looking for a heart that comes into the
[1:18:05] house of God I'm telling you if we had a
[1:18:08] modern day Tabernacle here you would
[1:18:10] need to go down to Harbor Freight and
[1:18:12] buy every inch of rope they had because
[1:18:15] they would be dragging a lot of people
[1:18:17] back out of the Tabernacle they would be
[1:18:19] pulling a lot of people they would get
[1:18:21] in there in this modern day spirit and
[1:18:24] they would be there and God would say
[1:18:25] nope done drag another one
[1:18:30] out maybe they could recycle the Rope I
[1:18:32] don't know but you see my brother and
[1:18:34] sister that no what God's looking
[1:18:37] for we can build our own
[1:18:40] altar isn't this wonderful I I I want
[1:18:43] you to think about this for a minute
[1:18:44] hope I'm not too straight today we can
[1:18:47] build our own
[1:18:48] altar Can someone say thank you Lord I
[1:18:50] get to build my own altar but I'll tell
[1:18:53] you the difference between a real
[1:18:54] believer and somebody who's just
[1:18:56] claiming it is a real believer goes and
[1:18:58] says here is the directions for building
[1:19:00] my altar okay I'm going to do this and
[1:19:03] I'm going to do this and I'm going to do
[1:19:05] this and then when we put our sacrifice
[1:19:07] on the altar God says I accept it but
[1:19:09] when we build our own altar amen we
[1:19:11] throw everything we think is beautiful
[1:19:14] on that Altar and then we offer it to
[1:19:16] God and wonder why God's not pleased
[1:19:19] that's right so instead of finding out
[1:19:22] why God's not pleased we just change the
[1:19:25] rules of what pleases God so then we
[1:19:29] come up with a whole new religion of
[1:19:30] what we think pleases God I say help us
[1:19:36] Lord help us Lord I want an altar but I
[1:19:39] want it to be an altar of your desire an
[1:19:42] altar of your word an altar of your
[1:19:45] ideas Lord not my
[1:19:49] ideas now I know none of us ever got
[1:19:51] caught up in the realm of working for
[1:19:53] our
[1:19:55] Salvation except every one of us has at
[1:19:58] some point in time amen look our labor
[1:20:03] to build our altar my brother and sister
[1:20:05] will never get us in
[1:20:07] no amen we need to lay our altar on
[1:20:10] God's I mean our sacrifice on God's
[1:20:12] altar amen
[1:20:14] amen the reality of it is and I know
[1:20:17] you'll say Amen to this is all we really
[1:20:18] want is what the Lord desires that's all
[1:20:21] that matters to us amen Church
[1:20:25] attendance I don't know maybe we do make
[1:20:29] an
[1:20:30] effort for the church to
[1:20:37] grow maybe we preach the word
[1:20:42] boldly yes sir and then we live it
[1:20:44] that's it and it will attract that's
[1:20:47] right the believer amen it will attract
[1:20:50] the Christian because he's not going to
[1:20:52] look at you know I'm going to name the
[1:20:55] other ministers here just you know I
[1:20:57] mean not really throwing them under the
[1:20:58] bus or anything but you know maybe
[1:21:01] they'll look at brother David's
[1:21:03] Ministry they'll look at brother Chris's
[1:21:07] Ministry and maybe they'll come along
[1:21:09] and say you
[1:21:11] know they always just preach so nice
[1:21:14] except when they don't
[1:21:18] that's but I need
[1:21:20] it and I want it
[1:21:24] imagine a a group of Christians that
[1:21:26] actually Rejoice at having the hide tore
[1:21:27] off of
[1:21:29] them doesn't sound normal does
[1:21:32] it I think number eight or something is
[1:21:36] never speak harshly to the
[1:21:39] people I had to agree with
[1:21:42] them harsh is not the answer that's it
[1:21:46] truthful yes is the answer and there is
[1:21:49] such a difference between harsh that's
[1:21:52] right and and truthful that's
[1:21:54] right God help us amen why because we're
[1:21:58] moving forward my brother and sister to
[1:22:00] be acceptable in the Beloved that's it
[1:22:03] this is what God's doing now we're going
[1:22:05] to have to make this a part too I have
[1:22:07] just stretched this out too far but look
[1:22:09] at this my brother and sister Ephesians
[1:22:12] 1
[1:22:13] 1-14 amen I believe is is a just a
[1:22:16] definite uh connection to this and it is
[1:22:20] there because of the time uh I I'm just
[1:22:22] going to hurry through this a little bit
[1:22:24] probably shouldn't probably should just
[1:22:25] make it part two somewhere down the road
[1:22:27] but you know Paul we have no doubt that
[1:22:30] he was an apostle of Jesus Christ and
[1:22:32] Paul obviously was very successful so I
[1:22:36] won't name names but there's a man on
[1:22:37] the internet that is uh been ordained by
[1:22:40] somebody to point out every other uh uh
[1:22:44] religion's faults and failures and
[1:22:47] whatnot and you know I I I bless his
[1:22:50] heart just bless his heart but my
[1:22:53] brother and sister you know I thought
[1:22:55] where where'd this guy come
[1:22:56] from so I just type his name into the
[1:22:59] computer and I start looking back where
[1:23:01] he come from and how that everything
[1:23:04] that happened and somewhere at the
[1:23:05] bottom of it was his net worth and uh I
[1:23:09] I have messed up as a
[1:23:15] minister I I me I don't know what I did
[1:23:18] wrong I had no idea that being a
[1:23:21] preacher was a career path
[1:23:23] I thought it was a
[1:23:25] calling and you look at this and he's
[1:23:29] telling well this guy's a herotic and
[1:23:30] that guy's a heretic and then I realized
[1:23:33] that some of these guys he's calling
[1:23:34] Heretics you know we have very very
[1:23:37] similar uh beliefs you know and I
[1:23:39] realize you know what if we ever hit his
[1:23:41] radar we'd be a heretic yeah and I get
[1:23:44] up out of my chair in the office and say
[1:23:46] thank you Lord thank you Lord because
[1:23:48] the word said we'd be worshiping in the
[1:23:50] way that they call heresy that's right
[1:23:52] amen not Conformity that's right heresy
[1:23:55] that's right my brother and sister if
[1:23:57] they cannot accept the baptism of the
[1:23:59] Holy Ghost if they cannot accept baptism
[1:24:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if
[1:24:04] they cannot accept these things that are
[1:24:06] basic tenants of the scripture and they
[1:24:08] want to say we're the Heretics I say
[1:24:10] thank you Lord amen I'm going to just
[1:24:13] stand with a word no matter what their
[1:24:15] opinion is or where they put us in their
[1:24:18] little structure cuz their structure
[1:24:20] don't matter God structure does and amen
[1:24:22] and God laid it out very clearly and so
[1:24:25] we look at this now I want to just hurry
[1:24:27] up here uh blessed verse three blessed
[1:24:30] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:24:31] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[1:24:34] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:24:36] in Christ now I want to ask you today
[1:24:38] have you been visiting Heavenly places
[1:24:40] amen we should be able to lift our hand
[1:24:42] and say thank you Lord I've been in your
[1:24:44] word and that's taken me up into
[1:24:46] Heavenly places we cannot get into
[1:24:48] Heavenly places we cannot put oursel in
[1:24:51] Heavenly places it takes the word of God
[1:24:54] the Holy Spirit moving in us to lift us
[1:24:56] up out of leod deia I don't want to have
[1:24:59] religion I want Christ amen I don't want
[1:25:02] to have an ideology identity over here
[1:25:05] oh those of you Believers here you you
[1:25:08] understand what I'm saying I don't need
[1:25:10] the identity I don't need somebody say
[1:25:13] he's a True Believer I don't know what
[1:25:15] your opinion is I don't care what your
[1:25:17] opinion is Lord I care about your
[1:25:20] opinion Lord I want to be pleasing to
[1:25:23] you Lord this man over in this church
[1:25:26] and that family over there and these
[1:25:27] people down there they don't matter
[1:25:30] about my eternal destination they cannot
[1:25:32] change my destination amen
[1:25:36] amen Lord I want you to be pleased with
[1:25:38] me sir Hallelujah sir now imagine if you
[1:25:42] get a whole group or Church of people
[1:25:44] that have that desire Lord I just want
[1:25:47] to please you you'll suddenly find
[1:25:49] saints come on you'll find yourself in
[1:25:51] har harmony with everyone around you
[1:25:55] because you'll all be immersed in the
[1:25:57] word surrounded by the word filled with
[1:26:00] the word we won't have a thought we
[1:26:03] won't have an idea we won't have a
[1:26:05] concept it'll be the word
[1:26:08] amen sorry if you're getting
[1:26:10] excited
[1:26:12] Hallelujah man imagine a church like
[1:26:14] that there wouldn't be a single fuss
[1:26:17] anywhere
[1:26:20] amen except for
[1:26:23] which is kind of like the word
[1:26:25] but just negates everything in front of
[1:26:29] it we take this
[1:26:32] flesh
[1:26:34] everywhere we go exctly right yes
[1:26:39] sir the Apostle Paul says crucify
[1:26:42] yourself
[1:26:43] daily my he was a sick man I
[1:26:46] mean what's wrong with him no that's a
[1:26:50] deep deep revelation
[1:26:54] cuz I tell you what sometimes this old
[1:26:55] flesh gets up in the morning and it's
[1:26:59] already to growl bite snarl
[1:27:05] scratch surprised sister Jerry didn't
[1:27:07] say hey
[1:27:09] amen am
[1:27:12] amen pray for my husband
[1:27:17] amen but you know before the sun goes
[1:27:20] down the Lord corrects those Spirits
[1:27:24] deals with our
[1:27:26] hearts amen
[1:27:29] now what about all the feathers we left
[1:27:31] behind
[1:27:33] us this why we need the Holy Spirit
[1:27:36] every moment of every day you all know
[1:27:38] the feather story right yeah I think
[1:27:41] everybody knows the feather
[1:27:43] story yeah so let's go back and pick up
[1:27:47] the feathers problem is we don't know
[1:27:50] where we left
[1:27:51] them some of went here and some of went
[1:27:54] there and we try to restore Our
[1:27:56] Testimony we go back and make apologies
[1:28:00] we do all these things look I'm
[1:28:02] sorry but there's those feathers we
[1:28:04] never saw where they
[1:28:05] landed isn't it much greater Saints this
[1:28:08] is I'm just preaching my heart to you
[1:28:10] isn't it much greater if we can get so
[1:28:13] immersed in the presence of God we don't
[1:28:16] have to be feather Hunters that's right
[1:28:19] we don't have to go and remember now who
[1:28:21] did I say snarl at
[1:28:23] today who did I especially those of you
[1:28:27] prone to Road
[1:28:29] Rage that's going to be really hard to
[1:28:31] correct that one going to ask have to
[1:28:34] ask the police for a security camera I
[1:28:35] need to see every car that drove down
[1:28:37] the freeway
[1:28:38] today I need their phone number I need
[1:28:41] to be able to no my brother and
[1:28:43] sister but you'll find I hope you see
[1:28:46] humor in this you'll find how Satan can
[1:28:49] so anoint us
[1:28:52] I drive out of the driveway in the
[1:28:55] morning I can't just drive right out on
[1:28:57] the road because there's a car coming
[1:29:00] and I'm
[1:29:04] annoyed I'm going to have to wait three
[1:29:07] seconds to pull out on the
[1:29:10] road who do they think they are this is
[1:29:14] my
[1:29:18] road see how Satan can work
[1:29:23] the worst of it is we take that
[1:29:25] attitude home at
[1:29:27] lunch on the telephone to our
[1:29:32] children the whole time Satan's just
[1:29:34] sitting over there got a great Belly
[1:29:39] Laugh look what I did to them today it
[1:29:43] only took a car on a highway to ruin
[1:29:47] their
[1:29:50] day come on you can insert anything you
[1:29:52] want into that
[1:29:54] equation amen now I'll just leave that
[1:29:58] one be amen praise the
[1:30:05] Lord so having predestinated us into
[1:30:08] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:30:11] himself a good according to the good
[1:30:13] pleasure of his will see there's where
[1:30:16] we're at my brother and sister not what
[1:30:17] we think amen not what we you know look
[1:30:20] I'm sorry I'll be a little direct
[1:30:22] visitors forgive me but I'll tell you
[1:30:24] around the message we have written such
[1:30:27] definitive mission
[1:30:29] statements I can fellowship with them if
[1:30:32] they believe exactly like I
[1:30:37] do so far I asked the Lord why do I have
[1:30:42] no
[1:30:45] friends because no one can see it just
[1:30:49] like you
[1:30:53] it's called personal
[1:30:56] revelation will it lead us all to the
[1:31:00] same Finish
[1:31:01] Line it
[1:31:03] will but some of you I'm going to be
[1:31:08] truthful are much smarter than the rest
[1:31:10] of us and you grasp certain things and
[1:31:13] you see and boy you're looking way out
[1:31:15] over here and the rest of us got our
[1:31:17] head down plowing saying okay now
[1:31:20] Prophet said this okay I see okay I'm
[1:31:24] going to reach out really far
[1:31:26] here and others are like I'm going to
[1:31:29] reach out really
[1:31:33] far well I don't know about them they
[1:31:35] got this crazy Revelation they were
[1:31:37] sharing with the Church
[1:31:38] Fellowship about how this and this and
[1:31:43] this I think they're losing
[1:31:46] it and I heard the pastor say I believe
[1:31:49] that so it means our pastors lose sing
[1:31:55] it my brother and
[1:31:57] sister all that matters is the Finish
[1:32:01] Line amen when the word is manifested in
[1:32:05] you and the word is manifested in me it
[1:32:09] will take us to the exact same spot to
[1:32:15] hear the exact same words well done my
[1:32:20] good and and faithful
[1:32:23] servant White
[1:32:25] Horse White Cloud just believe he's
[1:32:30] coming amen we need to have as much
[1:32:33] grace for one another as we want to have
[1:32:37] for
[1:32:38] ourself and when we will come to that
[1:32:40] stage I'm cutting off a whole bunch of
[1:32:42] the sermon sorry but when we'll come to
[1:32:44] that stage my brother and sister we'll
[1:32:46] look out we'll see a brother and sister
[1:32:48] and we'll be thinking I don't know where
[1:32:50] they're going but I will send the holy
[1:32:53] spirit with them I will ask the Lord to
[1:32:56] go with them I'll ask the Lord if
[1:32:59] they're wrong turn them around amen
[1:33:03] bring them back that's right but I've
[1:33:05] seen this Mo life though I could testify
[1:33:07] my life I've looked before and thought
[1:33:09] you know what I don't I don't know where
[1:33:10] they're going I don't know where they're
[1:33:12] going my my oh my where are they going a
[1:33:16] year later I find myself exactly where
[1:33:18] they're at just because I couldn't see
[1:33:21] it didn't mean it wasn't God
[1:33:23] moving God just matured them a little
[1:33:26] sooner which is one of the reasons I
[1:33:28] Marvel that I'm your pastor because many
[1:33:31] of you are farther down the road than I
[1:33:34] am and maybe it's just you need somebody
[1:33:37] to say come on come on and somehow it
[1:33:41] was me that got put in that place but it
[1:33:44] doesn't mean that you have to dumb
[1:33:46] yourself down if I can put it in Blunt
[1:33:47] words concerning revelation of Jesus
[1:33:50] Christ because you can't can't have more
[1:33:52] Revelation than your pastor you remember
[1:33:53] that was a Doctrine in the
[1:33:55] message yeah oh my these people are
[1:33:58] getting revelated around here we're
[1:33:59] going to have to beat them so that they
[1:34:01] will get back in line no why don't we
[1:34:04] just move and join them amen let's rally
[1:34:06] around the word not the man amen amen a
[1:34:10] quote where brother Brown says you you
[1:34:11] should never look up to a man you should
[1:34:13] only look for an example to Jesus Christ
[1:34:16] amen if we'll look to Christ as our
[1:34:18] example my brother and sister then this
[1:34:20] word will bring each and every one of us
[1:34:23] into a Rapture that's right Amen to hear
[1:34:26] those words well done Amen to be
[1:34:31] accepted in the Beloved is our goal
[1:34:34] that's it it's not a contest it's not a
[1:34:36] race it's not something that we have to
[1:34:39] battle one another it is something we
[1:34:41] should link our arms
[1:34:43] together and press to the mark of the
[1:34:45] High Calling press into the word and
[1:34:48] encourage one another to press into the
[1:34:51] word
[1:34:52] amen I'm I don't mean to drop names but
[1:34:54] you know we were over at brother Sergey
[1:34:56] and sister Julia's house the other day
[1:34:58] and uh you know all the things that
[1:35:00] happened and whatnot and brother Sergey
[1:35:02] I really I I just carried that
[1:35:04] conversation we had home with me and the
[1:35:06] next day or two there I was just like
[1:35:08] this is wonderful because we got into a
[1:35:11] conversation into the word now everybody
[1:35:14] else was singing songs enjoying it was a
[1:35:16] beautiful time amen it was good I'm not
[1:35:18] putting down on no one else but that
[1:35:20] personal conversation we had in those
[1:35:22] things of the word was something I took
[1:35:25] home it had intrinsic
[1:35:28] value right and there was a couple of
[1:35:31] those that I'm like I've never saw it
[1:35:33] that way
[1:35:34] before so of course I had to tell
[1:35:36] brother Sergey he couldn't believe that
[1:35:38] because I had never seen it
[1:35:40] before nonsense that's right nonsense
[1:35:44] we're all moving into the revelation of
[1:35:48] Jesus Christ sister Ruth if you would
[1:35:50] come amen is it good to be a Christian
[1:35:53] amen good to have the word good to know
[1:35:56] that God said whatever your maturity is
[1:36:01] you're still growing you're still coming
[1:36:04] closer you're a son or daughter of God
[1:36:07] this is not an accident this is not a
[1:36:09] mistake you are my desire amen amen when
[1:36:13] you look in the word it ought to be a
[1:36:14] love story it ought to be something that
[1:36:17] just stirs our hearts a love story that
[1:36:19] we can pick up the Bible and say Thank
[1:36:21] You Lord For Loving Me amen you know
[1:36:24] we're going to be doing a marriage
[1:36:25] seminar here in a couple weeks or
[1:36:27] whatever up in Canada and uh I I won't
[1:36:29] spill titles and whatnot but I'm telling
[1:36:32] you my brother and sister instead of
[1:36:33] looking at marriage like it's a struggle
[1:36:35] we should look at marriage like it's a
[1:36:37] privilege we have the
[1:36:40] privilege of serving husband we have a
[1:36:44] privilege of serving a
[1:36:46] wife because you see the natural is
[1:36:51] reflected in the
[1:36:54] spiritual and if we think that serving
[1:36:56] God is a
[1:36:59] duty we think serving God is something
[1:37:03] that we're forced to
[1:37:05] do what kind of
[1:37:09] relationship what kind of
[1:37:12] relationship my brother and sister it's
[1:37:15] a privilege we are the most privileged
[1:37:17] people on the face of the Earth today
[1:37:21] God loves us says I'm going to put
[1:37:23] myself even my own spirit in you I'll be
[1:37:27] with you all the way to the end of this
[1:37:29] journey now I'm telling you the devil
[1:37:31] sure likes to tell us we're all alone
[1:37:33] and we're
[1:37:34] Lonesome but I tell you every time you
[1:37:36] turn back to the
[1:37:37] word The Lonesome Spirit goes
[1:37:41] away and there's a presence
[1:37:44] comes let us catch the
[1:37:48] Revelation that we are in the presence
[1:37:51] of the
[1:37:52] Beloved and he claims us don't you love
[1:37:56] The Song of Solomon I remember I knew a
[1:37:58] family years ago their kids were like 14
[1:38:00] or 15 years old and they're like Mom Dad
[1:38:04] um they're like don't read about
[1:38:11] that kids read about it with your
[1:38:15] spiritual cap
[1:38:17] on then you'll realize that's a
[1:38:20] spiritual
[1:38:21] is reflected in the
[1:38:23] natural but take it for the spiritual
[1:38:27] first and you'll realize how much God
[1:38:29] loves you how he looks at you not in a
[1:38:33] world carnal sexual pattern that the
[1:38:36] world likes to turn everything but in
[1:38:39] this love affair how precious we are to
[1:38:43] him how beautiful we are to him and how
[1:38:46] he desires us and Longs for our presence
[1:38:50] in the meantime the devil is telling you
[1:38:51] you'll never make it you're not good
[1:38:54] enough did anywhere in there did it
[1:38:57] say if you're good
[1:39:01] enough if we finished our scripture it
[1:39:04] says because you were
[1:39:06] boen because you were called because you
[1:39:10] are my beloved Hallelujah you love the
[1:39:14] Lord hallelujah I hope that made sense I
[1:39:18] just hate it when I study so much
[1:39:19] Brother David and I just think one more
[1:39:21] scripture one more quote one more
[1:39:23] comment's going to get the point and
[1:39:26] then realize
[1:39:29] that the points already been
[1:39:32] made but I still have pages of material
[1:39:35] that I feel compelled to
[1:39:37] share but God's good amen because we're
