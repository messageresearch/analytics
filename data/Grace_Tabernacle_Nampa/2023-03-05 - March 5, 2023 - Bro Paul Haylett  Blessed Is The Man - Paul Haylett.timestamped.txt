[24:00] I got a couple announcements here to
[24:02] make so um
[24:04] hey somebody wrote on here it's brother
[24:06] Scott's birthday today I don't see him
[24:07] here today but God bless you brother
[24:08] Scott if you're listening
[24:10] we love you and we appreciate you
[24:12] brother
[24:13] and we miss you not here
[24:19] um
[24:20] we're gonna go over so we've got
[24:22] everything squared away for camp this
[24:24] year
[24:25] um well I shouldn't say everything
[24:26] squared away
[24:27] a lot of the preliminary stuff so I've
[24:29] got a quick little slide thing here
[24:31] we're going to go through real quick and
[24:32] then I believe you have a special is
[24:35] that right okay so as soon as I'm done
[24:36] you can come up get the special on
[24:39] um you put that first one up so um
[24:41] Gray's Family Camp 2023 being Camp
[24:43] Cascade up in Donnelly Idaho
[24:45] so it's kind of right right there on the
[24:47] lake
[24:48] um and I'll we can get maps and stuff as
[24:51] that gets closer but uh so it'll be a
[24:54] check-in on Thursday evening June 15th
[24:56] at uh after 4 P.M
[24:59] um and then the checkout we've got the
[25:01] camp till Monday morning
[25:03] um so we got to be out and cleaned up by
[25:05] 1 pm on Monday morning so you move on to
[25:07] the next one there
[25:08] this is the kind of the flyer that Chris
[25:11] put together with the quote there that
[25:12] he felt was the quote for this year
[25:15] Psalms 105 41 he opened up the Rock and
[25:18] the waters gushed out
[25:19] they ran in the dry places like a river
[25:22] amen
[25:25] so go ahead and move the next one there
[25:27] so this year it's going to be quite a
[25:29] bit different than last year you know
[25:30] last year it was a bunch of us with RVs
[25:32] and Tents so this year we've got cabins
[25:36] for those that don't want a tent which
[25:39] I'm sure there's some people that rather
[25:40] not stay in a tent this year if they
[25:41] don't have to we have three premium
[25:43] cabins with a full bath with shower in
[25:46] those ones they sleep six
[25:48] they do have Heating and ceiling fans so
[25:51] this will be mid mid-june who knows what
[25:53] it's going to be like you know you never
[25:55] you know I never know how it is around
[25:56] here it is up in Donnelly so it should
[25:58] be cooler but you know those evenings
[26:00] can still be cool so they do have
[26:02] Heating in those there's 18 there's
[26:04] actually nine standard cabins but they
[26:06] split into they have like a wall that
[26:08] goes down the middle and divides them
[26:09] one side sleeps six and one side sleep
[26:12] seven so we're pretty much just dividing
[26:13] all those up
[26:15] but we'll see how the the sign up how
[26:18] when people sign up how that comes in
[26:20] um so the each one of those divided
[26:22] sleep six on one side and seven on the
[26:24] other they also have Heating and fans
[26:26] provided
[26:27] um those don't have restrooms or running
[26:29] water they have electricity obviously
[26:31] but um no running water so there's a
[26:33] central bath house
[26:34] um you know divided man on one side
[26:36] women on the other
[26:37] um and I believe there's four showers
[26:39] four sinks four toilets in each of the
[26:41] bath houses so
[26:42] um and there is no cooking allowed in
[26:44] the cabins so we'll get onto the meals
[26:46] here in just a second so you can go to
[26:47] the next one
[26:50] um there's a lodge dining hall for
[26:52] services and and obviously obviously the
[26:54] Mills seats up to about 200. as you can
[26:58] kind of see there in the picture there
[26:59] they've got a little platform up there
[27:01] with a projector and stuff like that so
[27:02] the services will be in there as well
[27:05] um there will be three three meals
[27:07] served daily so on that Thursday there
[27:09] will be a dinner served if you get there
[27:11] if you check in that Thursday night
[27:13] there will be dinner served and then on
[27:16] Monday morning if you stay till Monday
[27:18] morning to leave that morning there will
[27:19] be a breakfast served as well
[27:22] um so there's that um and then this has
[27:24] everything for the worship services and
[27:26] then the meals there's some other
[27:28] details around that but we'll address
[27:30] those as we get closer to the dates so
[27:32] move on to the next one there
[27:36] um there's a big fire pit area for
[27:37] devotions and stuff like that
[27:39] um seats about 100 with the logs and
[27:41] stuff around it it's kind of secluded
[27:43] it's it's surrounded by trees and stuff
[27:45] like that so it's got a nice little area
[27:47] um there are some RV sites with hookups
[27:50] and um several tent sites in the area as
[27:53] well so next one there
[27:57] uh there's also a big big kind of grass
[27:59] common area there uh activity area so um
[28:03] you know whatever we want to play out
[28:04] there soccer volleyball whatever that
[28:06] might be they also have stuff for
[28:09] archery a ropes course and kayaks since
[28:11] it's by the lake
[28:13] um and then whatever whatever other
[28:14] activities we decide to
[28:17] introduce there so move to that last one
[28:20] this has the fees and stuff in there so
[28:22] it is it is more money this year with
[28:24] the cabins and all the meals included so
[28:27] um
[28:27] the fees include three meals a day as
[28:30] you can see there and a meal on that
[28:32] Thursday or Friday depending or sorry
[28:34] Friday Thursday or Monday
[28:37] um so there's kind of the fees
[28:39] um
[28:40] if you have any questions about this ask
[28:42] myself I think I even can probably
[28:44] answer questions too after service
[28:47] um and then we will be sending out a a
[28:51] form to get signed up in the church
[28:53] WhatsApp so I've got a form all built
[28:56] out for that we are going to cap the
[28:59] attendance of Camp I think last year we
[29:01] had about 75 people this year we're
[29:03] opening it up since we have more room
[29:04] more spaces to about 125.
[29:08] um so
[29:10] um we want to make sure we want the form
[29:13] once we send that out we would like
[29:14] don't share that with anybody outside of
[29:16] our church for at least a couple weeks
[29:19] we want to make sure everybody in church
[29:21] has a chance to get signed up and be a
[29:23] part of that before we start opening it
[29:25] up to people outside
[29:27] so we just asked yeah once we send that
[29:30] out don't don't be sharing it right away
[29:33] um we want to make sure that everybody
[29:34] uh everybody here has a chance to get
[29:37] that get that done so
[29:39] um like I said if you have any questions
[29:40] around this uh please just ask me or
[29:44] Ivan um Chris isn't back yet but he
[29:46] would be the other one you could talk to
[29:47] him as well so
[29:49] um
[29:51] so looking forward to that hopefully
[29:53] everybody is I am amen we had a great
[29:55] time last year
[29:57] um oh and brother Stephen will be back

[37:12] and we say thank you Lord to that amen
[37:15] that he hears us amen when we call
[37:22] foreign
[37:23] just I think we overlooked it brother
[37:25] Trevor shared with me and I overlooked
[37:28] that
[37:28] um whether Trevor sister carrier
[37:31] down visiting for the Traverse parents
[37:35] and Reno area
[37:38] just a little Trevor sharing that he
[37:42] sees his parents aging so quickly and
[37:45] feels a great need to interact
[37:48] and maintain a relationship with them
[37:51] and so let's just lift that up we miss
[37:53] our sister Sue today and all those who
[37:56] are not with us I want to speak to you
[37:58] this morning overall title again of
[38:01] things that are to be and I want to
[38:05] speak taking this from the scriptures uh
[38:08] blessed is the man and I believe today
[38:12] we can take our claim our position as
[38:15] the Blessed of almighty God thank you
[38:18] sister Sarah brother Isaac amen it's
[38:21] good to see Sister Sarah back it's been
[38:24] quite some time but we appreciate that
[38:28] let's turn in our Bibles to Psalms
[38:32] first chapter verses one through six and
[38:36] we're going to kind of
[38:39] at least I think at the moment wrap up
[38:41] our little thought on job and we'll see
[38:44] how this carries from The Book of Job
[38:46] down through our thought today carries
[38:48] from The Book of Job
[38:50] right into the book of Psalms and well
[38:53] Psalm and we know that God always works
[38:56] in continuity he does not
[38:59] um he does not just start and stop
[39:01] something does not leave us hanging but
[39:04] everything is in continuity
[39:07] and while you're turning maybe you're
[39:09] already there but I just want to tell
[39:10] you we went and visited
[39:13] I'm still a little confused we call him
[39:15] brother mellow but then as we went uh
[39:18] and met them it's brother Paul and
[39:20] sister Lillian
[39:22] and had a lovely visit with them Friday
[39:25] evening there and just a lovely couple
[39:29] they're just getting everything in order
[39:31] now those of us who were born and raised
[39:35] here have never
[39:37] left the continent never crossed an
[39:40] ocean to start a new life we probably
[39:43] don't realize the complexity
[39:46] but they are uh by God's grace they're
[39:49] just moving forward
[39:51] um and and uh soon will be established
[39:54] in their own apartment and uh uh they
[39:58] shared with us the Lord has blessed them
[40:00] with a vehicle
[40:01] and blessed our our brother with a job
[40:04] and uh so just lift up our
[40:09] um brother Paul sister Lillian their
[40:11] family they have uh uh
[40:14] four children here
[40:18] yeah I think it's four children four or
[40:20] five children are here some
[40:22] grandchildren are here they do have a
[40:25] son uh Paul Jr
[40:28] um uh is is uh handicapped young man has
[40:31] been since his birth and so just
[40:33] remember them in prayer and uh and
[40:36] certainly our brothers and sisters that
[40:38] have come and started a new life you
[40:42] know the complexities that are are part
[40:45] of that uh labor so certainly I believe
[40:49] we would have a compassion uh for our
[40:52] brother and sister amen Psalm 1 1-6
[40:57] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[41:00] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[41:03] in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the
[41:06] seat of the scornful
[41:08] but his Delight is in the law of the
[41:10] Lord and in his law doth he meditate day
[41:14] and night and he shall be like a tree
[41:16] planted by the rivers of water that
[41:19] bringeth forth fruit his fruit in his
[41:22] season his Leaf also shall not wither
[41:25] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[41:28] young Godly or not so but are like the
[41:32] chaff which the wind driveeth away
[41:35] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[41:38] the Judgment nor the sinners in the
[41:40] congregation of the righteous
[41:43] for the Lord knoweth the way of the
[41:45] righteous but the way of the ungodly
[41:48] Shall Perish Heavenly Father we just ask
[41:51] Lord come Lord bless each brother each
[41:54] sister today wherever they might be Lord
[41:57] bless those that are here in the house
[41:58] of God today just speak to Hearts we
[42:01] pray for our brothers out on the road
[42:03] Lord just be with him keep them safe
[42:05] from their Journeys we thank you Father
[42:08] for the privilege and the joy it is to
[42:10] be Sons and Daughters of God we ask now
[42:13] in your precious name amen you may be
[42:15] seated
[42:18] foreign
[42:23] just a little prayer for me we just had
[42:26] a little bit of a little sickness I
[42:29] guess it is congestion and stuff
[42:31] amen now as we look at this today I want
[42:35] to tie this back together uh uh in uh
[42:39] our thoughts concerning job and we look
[42:43] at all that happened to job here was a
[42:45] man of God and we see the testimony of
[42:48] the word declares to us that God viewed
[42:51] him as a righteous man and uh one that
[42:54] would stand faithful in the test and are
[42:59] are uh
[43:01] the word of God chose us so clearly how
[43:03] that that he is offered up as a
[43:06] testimony as a witness uh and Satan is
[43:10] there very quickly believing uh
[43:12] believing a very
[43:14] um oh I'm just struggling with the right
[43:16] words here give me a moment just
[43:20] seeing that he can unravel or undo the
[43:23] plan of God that that the God's promise
[43:25] God's election could be undone but my
[43:28] brother and sister I say thank you Lord
[43:31] today that God's election cannot be
[43:33] undone there's no way that Satan can
[43:36] grab as it were the thread at the end
[43:38] and start to just unravel that but God
[43:41] has sealed this he's he's brought this
[43:44] to a fruition even though it is not a
[43:46] finished work as it is in the natural
[43:49] but God in the spiritual has made it a
[43:53] finished work and so we see that what's
[43:56] happening to job and and it wasn't just
[43:58] job my brother and sister we'll look
[44:00] today and realize that those that were
[44:02] around job Joe laments that uh all of my
[44:06] friends they have disowned me all of my
[44:09] neighbors and even my own family and all
[44:11] of this have pulled away from me I have
[44:14] not a friend I have no one and it was
[44:16] there that job is in this time and this
[44:19] this struggle but my brother and sister
[44:22] if you'll look through the word of God
[44:23] and follow the continuity of the
[44:25] scripture you'll find that God always
[44:27] brings everything in a full circle God
[44:30] is not allowing us to be tested just
[44:33] simply for the sake of being tested but
[44:36] God always brings it around for a
[44:38] spiritual growth for for a growth of our
[44:41] character and it is my brother and
[44:43] sister this thought was upon my mind as
[44:46] we were just had a little conversation
[44:48] downstairs God uses these things for
[44:51] building blocks now my brother and
[44:53] sister if we have no trial and no
[44:55] struggle in our life we have no building
[44:57] block and if we don't want to go I I
[45:00] think we should be able to say Lord I
[45:02] don't want to go through this life and
[45:03] not grow in nature and grow in character
[45:06] and grow in spirit I want to grow in the
[45:09] very presence of God into the stature of
[45:12] a perfect man and it's there that we
[45:14] preach about these things but sometimes
[45:16] I believe we failed to grasp the real
[45:19] true reality team of what God is trying
[45:21] to do and so God brings us around in a
[45:25] full circle we'll touch on this I I kind
[45:27] of struggled on what order to put some
[45:30] of this so I'm just going to go with
[45:31] what the god left or laid upon my heart
[45:34] here and we'll see this story is not
[45:37] only about God dealing with job it's
[45:40] easy to look at job and say my God
[45:43] offered him open the Hedge and I I know
[45:46] this might strike us my brother and
[45:47] sister is a little awkward but I think
[45:50] today that we should be able to lift our
[45:53] hands and lift our hearts and say thank
[45:55] you Lord to have confidence to open the
[45:57] Hedge around my life
[45:59] oh what we would be as pampered
[46:02] Christians if God kept the Hedge closed
[46:05] all the time and just let us Prosper
[46:07] without trials but my brother and sister
[46:10] it is fiery trials that molds the
[46:12] character of Sons and Daughters of God
[46:14] and so it's there that God was dealing
[46:17] and opened the Hedge on job but it
[46:19] didn't end with job it also come and was
[46:22] there to reveal you might say some flaw
[46:24] of character that was in those that were
[46:27] around job and we just view them as
[46:29] friends of job but I would like this
[46:32] morning to just present them as these
[46:35] were men that went to church with Joel
[46:37] these were people job had set and talked
[46:40] about the great things of God and talked
[46:43] about the word of God with and their
[46:45] families worshiped together and and were
[46:47] in that environment and God says you
[46:50] know what I'm not only going to prove
[46:52] job Satan's Focus was on job but God
[46:55] said I'm going to use this to bring
[46:57] about a growth in his friends and those
[47:01] around him and you know these were the
[47:03] men my brother and sister I hope this
[47:06] this strikes us deep in our hearts here
[47:08] to cause thought these are the men that
[47:11] should have been standing with job they
[47:14] should have been the men that said job I
[47:16] don't know what's going on I don't know
[47:18] why this is happening but I'm here for
[47:20] you job and I'm going to be praying for
[47:23] you should have been the men that were
[47:24] praying for job
[47:26] should have been the men that were
[47:27] encouraging job
[47:30] and the part my brother and sister of
[47:32] the tests that we face
[47:34] is a season that God chooses for us to
[47:37] stand alone
[47:41] I want you to just go look in the word
[47:47] it appeared that even God had stepped
[47:49] away from job
[47:51] it was caused to stand alone in that
[47:53] time
[47:56] and job if you study this out maybe I
[47:59] should have made this into a little
[48:00] longer series but as you study this out
[48:03] you'll see that while job puts questions
[48:06] of why this is happening and why is God
[48:09] allowing and what is this that I'm not
[48:12] seeing you don't find job forsaking God
[48:16] he has question marks he he has
[48:19] uncertainties but you'll find job comes
[48:22] to a certain place have any of us ever
[48:25] come that we've just kind of felt down
[48:27] in our spirit and you might even say
[48:29] Lord do I have a friend or why is this
[48:31] like it is and we'll come but have you
[48:34] ever noticed that God only allows this
[48:37] to go down to a certain point before God
[48:40] comes on this scene and starts to remind
[48:42] us you're not alone I have never left
[48:45] you I have not forsaken you I am here
[48:48] with you
[48:49] and so God is allowing job to come to a
[48:52] certain place and his friends certainly
[48:54] accelerated that
[48:56] what is it you've done job what secret
[48:59] sin what what are you hiding in your
[49:01] life and I pray this morning my brother
[49:03] and sister that wanna not one of us have
[49:06] something hiding in our life that we can
[49:08] say I'm going through a trial we're
[49:11] going through trouble and struggle but
[49:13] I'm not hiding anything and job kept
[49:16] telling them over and over again I am
[49:18] not hiding anything that I know of
[49:20] there's nothing in my life that I know
[49:23] of that is displeasing to God but yet
[49:26] they really didn't believe him
[49:30] but did it matter whether they believed
[49:32] him and doesn't matter if the world
[49:33] believes you
[49:35] we know in our hearts who we are we know
[49:38] God has taken us he's led us to the
[49:40] altar my brother and sister one of the
[49:42] things the prophet of God was concerned
[49:44] about years ago is that people came to
[49:47] the altar with dry eyes and got up with
[49:49] dry eyes and walked away and the
[49:52] scripture talks about how that they
[49:54] would be as that brittle stick we don't
[49:57] want to be the brittle stick my brother
[49:58] and sister it is so easy today for us as
[50:01] Sons and Daughters of God with the
[50:03] message opened before us to be able to
[50:06] stop and say Lord you know my heart and
[50:09] Lord with there be something unclean as
[50:11] the David spoke Lord Give Me A Clean
[50:15] Heart Lord amen that should be our
[50:17] heart's desire today don't Harbor that
[50:20] that if God opened the Hedge even
[50:22] further in our life that we wouldn't
[50:24] have to say yes there is something I'm
[50:26] hiding but to be like job and say I know
[50:29] of no sin in my life I have given myself
[50:32] to God all that I am all that I have is
[50:35] from him and is him and they said no job
[50:39] what is it come on open up what is it
[50:44] but God you see was working more than
[50:47] just job and it doesn't seem as though
[50:49] those that were unreasonably
[50:53] critical or
[50:58] unreasonably
[50:59] in their stance
[51:01] against job it doesn't seem as though
[51:04] that there's going to be a restoration
[51:06] there
[51:07] and I can tell you my brother and sister
[51:09] we don't always understand what's
[51:11] happening in our life
[51:12] but I will tell you I can say this from
[51:15] from the word of God not not to to be
[51:18] like oh we are Untouchable but the word
[51:20] says my brother and sister this work
[51:22] that's in you is already finished
[51:24] amen it's not about the trial you're
[51:27] facing today it's not about the struggle
[51:29] of today it's not about what this and
[51:32] the Very foreseeable future for you the
[51:35] word says that it's already finished and
[51:38] I say Lord help us to believe help us to
[51:42] just take that I don't need to
[51:43] understand it I don't need to explain it
[51:46] I need to believe it and when we will
[51:48] give God a chance to move in our life
[51:50] you will find that he will then at the
[51:53] end of it all bring it in a full circle
[51:56] and we will understand what is happening
[51:59] amen
[52:02] you see these thoughts that God is
[52:04] faithful can we say God is faithful
[52:07] amen God is faithful my brother and
[52:10] sister
[52:13] that should be something that's so
[52:15] anchored
[52:16] in our life
[52:18] that no matter what is happening we have
[52:21] this Anchor Point God is faithful
[52:24] whether it's troubles
[52:26] In the Flesh the family
[52:29] whatever kind of trouble we should be
[52:32] able to come back to this place Hebrews
[52:34] 13 5 says to us amen referring to it let
[52:39] your conversation be without covetness
[52:41] and be content with such things as ye
[52:44] have for he hath said I will never leave
[52:48] thee nor forsake thee
[52:51] can we say Amen to that this morning
[52:53] come on Church we're a little quiet this
[52:55] morning but we ought to be able to say
[52:57] Amen to the word of God Amen no matter
[53:00] how tired you are or what is happening
[53:02] in your life you should be able to come
[53:04] to the place I believe this he said I'll
[53:07] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[53:09] you amen because I can stand on that
[53:12] word and believe that amen now we look
[53:16] here I want to just take you into
[53:17] Jeremiah
[53:19] 11-13
[53:22] here again God using the Prophet
[53:25] Jeremiah to speak
[53:27] and declare but this word is just as
[53:29] true and faithful and established today
[53:31] as it was when it come from the prophet
[53:36] from the prophet Jeremiah's
[53:38] mouth from his voice
[53:40] for I know the thoughts that I think
[53:42] toward you
[53:43] saith the Lord
[53:45] now my brother and sister
[53:48] when we were
[53:49] in South Africa there was a young man
[53:52] that had had some things happen in his
[53:54] life
[53:58] and he literally put this to me he said
[54:02] brother Paul because of the things that
[54:04] I have done I was backslid and the
[54:06] things that I have done
[54:08] is God punishing me
[54:12] my brother and sister how do you have an
[54:14] answer you don't know every equation of
[54:16] their life but all I could do was bring
[54:19] that young man to this scripture
[54:21] all I could do is bring him to the place
[54:23] this is what I want you to look at I
[54:25] don't want you to look at where you've
[54:27] been and what Satan is saying to you I
[54:30] want you to know that God's thoughts
[54:32] towards you are thoughts of peace and
[54:34] not of evil to give you an expected end
[54:37] and God has never the prophet of God I'm
[54:40] paraphrased this the prophet of God lays
[54:44] out the foundation that God did not call
[54:46] us to see us fail he called us to finish
[54:50] this race and not finish it as crawling
[54:53] across the finish line but victorious in
[54:56] Jesus Christ and so it's there that we
[54:59] look at this what is God's expected end
[55:01] for us this morning Saints of Grace what
[55:04] is God's expected in amen it is to
[55:07] complete the word that he has placed in
[55:10] us to bring it to a finality of us in
[55:14] him amen we're his bride we're a part of
[55:18] him we're not separated we are a part of
[55:21] the Lord Jesus Christ and it's in there
[55:24] that his expected in is not for us out
[55:27] here faltering in the wilderness his
[55:29] expected end Is Us in his presence us
[55:32] walking and living with him and
[55:35] ultimately when this is all finished to
[55:37] be standing in his presence and
[55:39] worshiping him Before the Throne of
[55:41] almighty God my brother and sister it's
[55:44] there that God gives this expected end I
[55:47] tell you we maybe should study the
[55:49] scripture a little more to know what
[55:51] that expected end is
[55:53] then shall he call upon me and ye shall
[55:56] go and pray unto me and I will hearken
[55:59] unto you you know a very common thing
[56:02] that is is spoken
[56:05] I young people once again referring back
[56:07] to being in South Africa
[56:10] brother Paul does God hear my prayers
[56:13] unlike every teenager I've listened to
[56:16] music I shouldn't Listen to I I have
[56:18] some behaviors I know I shouldn't have
[56:20] and when I pray does God hear my prayer
[56:23] my brother and sister the word of God
[56:25] says he hears our car our call our cry
[56:28] and he hearkens to us he's responding to
[56:31] us he didn't say because you have missed
[56:34] this no desert were and miss this over
[56:36] here I'm going to ignore you that's a
[56:38] human trait that's not a god trait my
[56:41] brother and sister God says you call I
[56:43] hearken amen and he says ye shall seek
[56:46] me I love this scripture you shall seek
[56:49] me
[56:50] and find me
[56:53] what a declaration to tell someone
[56:55] walking through the Wilderness of
[56:57] laodicea walking through the spirits of
[56:59] the age that we live in my brother and
[57:01] sister you can't hardly function in this
[57:03] world that there isn't Billboards and
[57:06] magazines and music and stuff everywhere
[57:08] it's saturated you can't even buy
[57:11] groceries without hearing the world
[57:15] much less go to a shopping mall
[57:19] I sometimes Find humor in that
[57:22] just simply how subtle Satan is that
[57:24] maybe there's something
[57:26] that was some music we were talking with
[57:28] the with the young adults this morning
[57:30] music my brother and sister it's such a
[57:34] part of us
[57:35] you might walk in a store and there's
[57:37] some song that used to be something
[57:39] important to you
[57:41] and so subtle does it come to you you
[57:44] walk out of the store and you're humming
[57:46] it
[57:48] and then you stop and say but that's not
[57:49] me
[57:51] I reject that
[57:53] because you see God is bringing us to a
[57:55] place we have to open the door to let
[57:57] those things in and God is giving us the
[58:00] strength to hold the door
[58:01] to only let him in
[58:04] so you see he says you shall seek me and
[58:06] find me and when ye shall search for me
[58:09] when with all your heart
[58:12] let's not make
[58:15] Saints of Grace that are here this
[58:16] morning whoever might hear this let's
[58:19] not make a half-hearted attempt at
[58:21] serving God
[58:23] a half-hearted attempt will not give us
[58:26] what we want
[58:28] it only satisfies the flesh for a moment
[58:31] as though that the idea that we can
[58:33] check off something that we have done
[58:35] well I tried to do this or I gave my
[58:38] little part I went to church my brother
[58:40] and sister let's not be half-hearted
[58:42] let's pour ourselves into it you know
[58:45] there's been many a man and many a woman
[58:47] on the earth that has been given great
[58:50] talents
[58:53] I remember reading a story once I
[58:55] believe this was France that uh this uh
[58:58] I can't remember his young man or a
[59:00] young woman but I believe his young man
[59:02] had incredible talents and and it was I
[59:05] I always get it wrong uh I think it was
[59:08] a violin it seems like a fiddle is more
[59:11] of a lively whatever I believe it was a
[59:13] violin this young man is instructor said
[59:16] you are destined
[59:19] to be one of the greatest violin players
[59:21] in the world
[59:24] But ultimately this young man come to
[59:26] naught
[59:28] disappeared right off the scene as he he
[59:30] was rising up through the ranks of this
[59:32] these uh you know I don't know how you
[59:34] even describe that you guys know the
[59:37] music there you start off just the
[59:38] beginners and move to the next and at
[59:40] some point right there there's those
[59:42] people who start to rise above everyone
[59:45] else in their age group and they rise
[59:47] above those older than them they rise up
[59:49] into the level they're playing better
[59:51] than adults in a practice for years and
[59:53] it's a gift that God has given them and
[59:55] they move on and this young man had been
[59:58] in that place and then he disappears
[1:00:00] from the scene and one day someone found
[1:00:02] him and says what has happened why did
[1:00:05] you disappear and he said I quit because
[1:00:09] it asks too much of me
[1:00:14] did he not have the ability he had the
[1:00:16] ability did he not have opportunity he
[1:00:19] had opportunity but he was not willing
[1:00:22] to give of himself to achieve the gift
[1:00:26] that had been placed in him and I
[1:00:28] believe that fits perfectly in our life
[1:00:30] serving God God has given you and I amen
[1:00:34] the very Life of Christ has come down
[1:00:36] the very nature it's been given to us
[1:00:39] are we gonna step back because it asks
[1:00:42] too much of us
[1:00:44] or are we going to say Lord see this is
[1:00:47] a difference in the flesh it might ask
[1:00:50] too much but my brother and sister in
[1:00:53] the spirit if we just say Lord I know
[1:00:56] this is what you called me to be this as
[1:00:58] it were talent that you have given to me
[1:01:01] Lord I am not going to bury it I'm not
[1:01:04] going to put it to the side I'm going to
[1:01:06] let this Talent bear fruit and let it
[1:01:09] rise up now Lord I've reached the end of
[1:01:11] what I can do now I need you amen it
[1:01:15] never was about our flesh and what we
[1:01:17] could do it's always been about him
[1:01:20] amen
[1:01:22] and certainly we can say this is what
[1:01:24] happened to job as job had reached an
[1:01:26] end my brother and sister scraping the
[1:01:29] boils
[1:01:30] how many of us hardened enough
[1:01:33] to sit around the ash Heap scraping our
[1:01:36] boils without feeling forsaken
[1:01:40] without feeling that something has went
[1:01:43] wrong but God held job and you might
[1:01:47] have your own Ash Heap this morning and
[1:01:49] you might have your own things in your
[1:01:51] life that you are dealing with but I'm
[1:01:53] here to tell you this morning God has
[1:01:56] not forsaken you hold on cry out to him
[1:02:00] Lord I need you because otherwise we'll
[1:02:04] come to the place that as it were job's
[1:02:06] own wife saying why don't you just curse
[1:02:08] God
[1:02:09] she lost more hope than job did she
[1:02:12] doesn't scrape a boil she doesn't lay in
[1:02:15] the ash Heap she doesn't deal with all
[1:02:17] the criticism and yet she has sunk lower
[1:02:20] than job himself and she is now
[1:02:22] declaring you should just Curse God and
[1:02:25] die and
[1:02:27] job says hmm
[1:02:29] you're not a fool woman
[1:02:31] but you're talking
[1:02:33] like one
[1:02:36] isn't that a little scary we go through
[1:02:38] trials and there could be people around
[1:02:40] us
[1:02:41] actually sink lower in the trial than we
[1:02:45] do
[1:02:47] they have less hope for the outcome
[1:02:51] than we do
[1:02:54] Lord help us
[1:02:56] but Satan that's Sly old Fox he knows
[1:02:58] how to do it
[1:03:00] because you know when job said
[1:03:03] I Harbor no secret sin
[1:03:06] his own wife
[1:03:09] didn't believe him
[1:03:13] that's pretty rough
[1:03:18] amen
[1:03:20] when
[1:03:22] you shall search for me with all your
[1:03:26] heart
[1:03:27] now this morning
[1:03:32] I think it's safe to say every one of us
[1:03:35] experiences we have
[1:03:37] challenge us
[1:03:40] but you realize that every experience is
[1:03:42] opening a channel to the presence of God
[1:03:45] is not simply just testing us to Let It
[1:03:48] Go but all of these things that we uh go
[1:03:53] through all these things that we face
[1:03:55] are opening up a channel
[1:03:58] now
[1:04:00] the prophet of God preached to us about
[1:04:02] how that all kinds of things stop up
[1:04:05] that channel he talks about how they
[1:04:07] would be Limbs and logs and leaves and
[1:04:11] sticks and all of this stuff clogging up
[1:04:14] the channel and when the channel is
[1:04:17] clogged nothing gets through it but yet
[1:04:19] the spirit is still coming but it's not
[1:04:21] going where it should so as it would be
[1:04:24] a river or a a creek or whatever it
[1:04:27] might be and a creek here in Idaho is
[1:04:30] that little stream running down the side
[1:04:32] of the Hill they call them Creeks back
[1:04:34] East but we're in Idaho it's a creek
[1:04:36] amen and so it's there my brother and
[1:04:39] sister that when that water gets stopped
[1:04:42] up in the channel it runs somewhere else
[1:04:45] it's got to go somewhere and God is here
[1:04:48] dealing with us Satan's constantly
[1:04:50] muddying the water and throwing things
[1:04:52] in trying to clog that up it might be
[1:04:55] family relations it might be in the
[1:04:58] marriage it might be in finances it
[1:05:00] might be in just personal complex but
[1:05:03] Satan's constantly pitching things in
[1:05:04] there to stop that up but the prophet of
[1:05:07] God talks about how once that channel
[1:05:10] when it is clear when it is open the
[1:05:13] presence of God the power of God flows
[1:05:15] down that channel into the believer's
[1:05:17] life and it changes the atmosphere it
[1:05:20] changes how we look at everything Can
[1:05:22] someone say I've been there amen I know
[1:05:25] what that is and when that channel is is
[1:05:28] cleared out all of that Throwdown
[1:05:30] suddenly we realize it doesn't matter
[1:05:32] what it is that is happening in the
[1:05:34] world around us that God is present he's
[1:05:37] with us now my brother and sister it's
[1:05:39] times that we are there or climb as it
[1:05:42] were to the Mountaintop but God is not
[1:05:45] just going to let you sit on the
[1:05:46] Mountaintop the rest of your life he
[1:05:48] takes it down Satan's still present he's
[1:05:50] still throwing sticks in the channel to
[1:05:53] clog it up he's still muddying the water
[1:05:55] and it's there that we go through Cycles
[1:05:59] hmm and someone say Amen
[1:06:02] you guys all stay up too late last night
[1:06:05] amen come on I can't even get a smile
[1:06:07] out of you over that one now look at
[1:06:09] this my brother and sister that's there
[1:06:11] that we go through these cycles of life
[1:06:17] at the bottom of a cycle is that the end
[1:06:19] of it all we just quit no sir God gives
[1:06:22] us a reminder that we are climbing the
[1:06:25] mountain once again we've had to cross
[1:06:27] over and we're climbing the mountain
[1:06:30] again we come back and we as humans go
[1:06:32] through this cycle now I would challenge
[1:06:34] you to study the message and you will
[1:06:36] see it very evident in the message a
[1:06:40] prophet's own Cycles being reflected to
[1:06:43] us his own times my brother and sister
[1:06:45] he didn't come with the dealings with
[1:06:47] the IRS and just brush that off as
[1:06:49] though it was nothing it troubled him
[1:06:51] greatly it affected him you can hear it
[1:06:54] in his voice when he's preaching any
[1:06:56] reference to the IRS to the government
[1:06:58] to this thing it's a burden to me he's
[1:07:01] talking about this he was just like us
[1:07:04] my brother and sister and so we're going
[1:07:06] through these Cycles but I want you to
[1:07:08] remember that we come to a time and we
[1:07:11] come to a place we either decide that
[1:07:14] God has a plan for my life and I'm going
[1:07:17] to press into the plan imagine you've
[1:07:20] got troubles and you pray into that
[1:07:22] trouble instead of fleeing from it you
[1:07:25] press into it why because God has
[1:07:28] already made a way through this
[1:07:30] situation in my life and I will overcome
[1:07:34] it what is happening things are being
[1:07:36] thrown out of the channel God is Not
[1:07:38] anointing everyone else to throw it out
[1:07:40] of the channel he's anointing us to
[1:07:42] throw it out of the channel and it goes
[1:07:44] right down to our young people going to
[1:07:47] their school work and whatever else I
[1:07:49] can't understand this I can't accomplish
[1:07:51] this Mao remember God is not causing you
[1:07:55] to step away to be discouraged to quit
[1:07:58] he wants you to dig deeper he wants you
[1:08:01] to put more effort and more prayer oh we
[1:08:04] can labor in the flesh in the mind all
[1:08:07] we want but he's wanting us to come into
[1:08:09] him and enter into him and say Lord I am
[1:08:13] your child I am of your family I have a
[1:08:17] need Lord and you said if I ask anything
[1:08:19] in your name you would Grant it and he
[1:08:22] knows my brother and sister that we're
[1:08:24] not I just heard a brother preaching the
[1:08:27] other day I thought it was very good he
[1:08:29] said you look God's doing God's blessing
[1:08:31] the bride God's blessing his people God
[1:08:34] is taking care of his people and we can
[1:08:36] stand here and hear the word say ask
[1:08:39] anything in my name and he said why is
[1:08:41] it we don't have the same Spirit and the
[1:08:44] same attitude as the world in the world
[1:08:47] out here if God granted unlimited
[1:08:50] Authority for them to ask this is how
[1:08:52] the brother put it he said you would see
[1:08:54] an unlimited Fleet of learjets
[1:08:58] because that's what they desire but the
[1:09:00] bride of Christ he's asking in his name
[1:09:03] and you would see her coming into
[1:09:05] Revelation coming into the presence of
[1:09:08] God acting God lead us Lord guide us
[1:09:11] Lord open the word to us Lord make this
[1:09:13] real and that's the difference of this
[1:09:15] denominational spirit and of the true
[1:09:17] holy spirit amen God working because the
[1:09:20] bride of Christ wants more of Christ she
[1:09:22] doesn't need another Fleet of Cadillacs
[1:09:24] she wants Christ that's what separates
[1:09:27] us amen so these experiences bring us
[1:09:31] amen ultimately in opening the channel
[1:09:34] into the presence of God my brother and
[1:09:37] sister you know that the opening of the
[1:09:39] seventh seal we've been right here in
[1:09:41] our church and seen the controversy that
[1:09:43] that raises up when you start talking
[1:09:45] about the seventh deal but you know what
[1:09:47] the opening of the seventh seal is not a
[1:09:49] Doctrine my brother and sister it is an
[1:09:52] experience and if no one's ever had that
[1:09:55] experience then to them it's nothing
[1:09:57] more than a Doctrine as this says this
[1:10:00] that says that that says that it can't
[1:10:03] be open or there will be you know this
[1:10:06] and that will happen over here
[1:10:08] oh my brother and sister
[1:10:11] when the experience comes
[1:10:14] when that experience comes it's like no
[1:10:16] I'm sorry I have been in his presence I
[1:10:20] know who he is I know what he desires
[1:10:23] for me he walks with me and he talks
[1:10:26] with me my brother and sister it's not a
[1:10:28] matter of talking about whether The
[1:10:30] Mercy Seat is off my brother and sister
[1:10:33] who's what this and this is going to
[1:10:34] happen at this time the bride of Christ
[1:10:36] is in the presence of almighty God that
[1:10:40] seventh seal which is Jesus Christ
[1:10:41] himself has been revealed to her
[1:10:45] no you can't explain it
[1:10:47] people want well show me show me a quote
[1:10:51] I can't show you an experience I can't
[1:10:54] show you what happened down inside but I
[1:10:57] can tell you it is real just like the
[1:11:00] tent Vision not brother and sister it
[1:11:02] was there they went into the tent and
[1:11:04] when they come out there was someone
[1:11:06] there saying what happened in there what
[1:11:08] was the answer they gave them they
[1:11:09] didn't say well we had a good old Holy
[1:11:12] Ghost Pentecostal experience of this and
[1:11:14] of that they come out and I don't know
[1:11:16] what happened but I'm changed because
[1:11:19] there it's not a Doctrine it's a
[1:11:22] experience
[1:11:24] it's God dealing right down into the
[1:11:27] depths of the Soul
[1:11:29] we're not just church-going Christians
[1:11:33] we are Christians by experience
[1:11:39] hmm
[1:11:44] job 19.
[1:11:46] as I talk about like the opening of the
[1:11:48] seventh seal
[1:11:50] you know in you when you look at this It
[1:11:53] just strikes you
[1:11:54] in job 19 or 25 he says
[1:11:57] I cut these scriptures very brief I'm
[1:12:00] sure you're familiar with them if not go
[1:12:02] read them
[1:12:03] but job comes to this time comes to this
[1:12:06] place and he makes this statement for I
[1:12:10] know
[1:12:11] that my redeemer liveth and that he
[1:12:14] shall stand at the latter day upon the
[1:12:16] Earth and though after my skin worms
[1:12:20] destroy this body yet in my flesh I
[1:12:24] shall see God this is not the man who is
[1:12:28] scraping boils around the fire wondering
[1:12:31] what has went wrong this is man is a man
[1:12:34] that has caught a revelation of what has
[1:12:37] happened in his life and who his
[1:12:39] relationship with God is and what it's
[1:12:42] going to do for him and the opening of
[1:12:44] that seal to him showed him that no
[1:12:47] matter what happened even though the
[1:12:49] skin worms destroy this body yet in my
[1:12:53] flesh I shall see God whom I shall see
[1:12:58] for the church's sake
[1:13:01] no
[1:13:03] Joe caught a revelation It's All About
[1:13:04] Me
[1:13:06] you know there's a few times my brother
[1:13:07] and sister that we can come
[1:13:10] and kind of you might say almost be
[1:13:11] selfish
[1:13:19] I want the Holy Ghost
[1:13:25] I want the relationship with Jesus
[1:13:27] Christ
[1:13:28] I want overcoming power
[1:13:33] few times that we can come it might
[1:13:35] sound selfish but what is God doing he's
[1:13:37] making this so personal to us
[1:13:41] and that we can sit there and say this
[1:13:43] isn't about and I'm sorry to say this in
[1:13:46] this fashion but I would trust you and
[1:13:48] understand
[1:13:49] it's not about you
[1:13:50] it's about me
[1:13:52] and each one of you should be able to
[1:13:54] stop and say I'm sorry but it's not
[1:13:56] about all of you it's about me but then
[1:13:59] collectively as the body of believers
[1:14:02] it is all of us
[1:14:05] that make up the body
[1:14:08] of Christ the bride
[1:14:10] every one of us that makes that up
[1:14:19] see just want to maybe give you a little
[1:14:21] homework if you would
[1:14:23] Job chapter 42 the very last chapter of
[1:14:27] job
[1:14:28] you'll see there I'm just going to draw
[1:14:31] out of verses 7 through 10. and as it
[1:14:34] was so that after the Lord had spoken
[1:14:37] these words unto job the Lord said and
[1:14:40] I'm just going to jump over these names
[1:14:42] and I'll struggle with trying to
[1:14:43] pronounce them he's telling them I'm not
[1:14:45] happy with you
[1:14:46] I'm not happy with you I'm not happy
[1:14:48] with not exactly how you treated job but
[1:14:52] you never even spoke positive of me as
[1:14:55] God
[1:14:57] you catch that
[1:14:59] you know my wrath is kindled against
[1:15:01] thee against our two friends for ye have
[1:15:04] not spoken of me the thing that is right
[1:15:06] they were actually putting this negative
[1:15:09] view on God himself as though God
[1:15:12] couldn't deliver God didn't know what he
[1:15:14] was doing this is all out of control so
[1:15:17] God is not very happy with these men who
[1:15:21] were job's friends not happy with them
[1:15:24] at all instead of coming in like they
[1:15:26] should have as real Christians and
[1:15:28] saying job we're going to come to your
[1:15:30] house you are sick you have all this
[1:15:33] issue we don't understand it but we're
[1:15:36] going to come to your house job and
[1:15:38] we're going to have a prayer meeting
[1:15:39] until God brings an understanding a
[1:15:43] change a correction a Revival whatever
[1:15:46] it is job we're here we're going to be
[1:15:49] at home job praying for you we're going
[1:15:52] to be in the marketplace job praying for
[1:15:54] you we're going to be a church job
[1:15:56] praying for you instead it was easy
[1:16:00] what's your secret sin
[1:16:02] what is your failure job a man who
[1:16:05] served God all these years what is your
[1:16:07] failure
[1:16:08] my brother and sister see how that
[1:16:10] negative Spirit just talking to the
[1:16:12] young adults there are some influences
[1:16:14] amen look at this my brother and sister
[1:16:16] it's always a spirit working with the
[1:16:19] spirit and it's either
[1:16:22] almighty God
[1:16:24] or it's the devil
[1:16:25] there's no halfway point
[1:16:28] let's quit fooling ourselves that we're
[1:16:30] only mildly
[1:16:31] backslid
[1:16:34] we either are
[1:16:37] or we aren't
[1:16:39] do us well to judge ourselves Brother
[1:16:42] Paul's not here to judge you today
[1:16:44] but it would do us well to judge
[1:16:46] ourselves
[1:16:48] where are we at
[1:16:52] you know maybe we need to put some
[1:16:55] technology
[1:16:57] sister Jerry's Grill
[1:17:00] my grill however you want to call it our
[1:17:02] Grill
[1:17:03] you know technology is so great you can
[1:17:05] put the little probe in in the the piece
[1:17:09] of meat
[1:17:10] and then you can go off about your day
[1:17:12] today around the house
[1:17:15] and just pull your phone out
[1:17:18] oh there's something wrong
[1:17:22] it's not getting hot
[1:17:25] oh well I'll deal with it at supper time
[1:17:30] you go out there and you got this piece
[1:17:33] of meat that's
[1:17:35] inedible
[1:17:39] what do you do
[1:17:40] I hope this little analogy catches you
[1:17:42] what do we do Saints we're barbecuing we
[1:17:45] we have guests for supper
[1:17:49] and the Wi-Fi your phone tells you that
[1:17:51] that it's 90 degrees inside the barbecue
[1:17:54] you don't ignore that you go and you do
[1:17:57] whatever it takes to get that Barbecue
[1:18:00] on fire get it hot to do what you wanted
[1:18:03] to do and I say God give us something
[1:18:06] amen the holy spirit is our Wi-Fi my
[1:18:09] brother and sister to show us whether
[1:18:12] we're hot or not and Lord I want to be
[1:18:14] hot I don't want to be just a lukewarm
[1:18:17] half-baked Christian I want the word to
[1:18:20] come and show me what I need to do to
[1:18:23] change my life or we can just sit here
[1:18:25] and say well I don't know church is so
[1:18:27] hard going to church all my friends are
[1:18:29] goofing off today my brother and sister
[1:18:31] are you going to go to hell because your
[1:18:33] friends went to hell
[1:18:35] that was a little blunt wasn't it
[1:18:38] maybe we need a little blunt once in a
[1:18:40] while
[1:18:41] amen I don't want to come to your house
[1:18:43] and eat a cold raw steak
[1:18:45] I want to eat something that was cooked
[1:18:48] and cooked correctly prepared correctly
[1:18:51] now in job 42 we see how God then is
[1:18:54] dealing with them and verse 18 or 8 I
[1:18:58] mean he tells them uh therefore you guys
[1:19:03] take the seven Bullocks seven Rams and
[1:19:05] go to my servant job
[1:19:09] my these friends are having a moment of
[1:19:12] Reckoning
[1:19:14] all of their criticism of Joel their
[1:19:17] basic expression that God was not enough
[1:19:21] to keep job
[1:19:24] that's where they were really at Saints
[1:19:26] they were speaking in a context that God
[1:19:28] was not enough to keep job that there is
[1:19:32] something that has crept in that even
[1:19:34] job don't know about
[1:19:37] and God says Nope you haven't spoken
[1:19:39] correctly of me now I want you to go
[1:19:41] take these seven Bullocks these seven
[1:19:43] Rams and I want you to go to my servant
[1:19:46] job and offer up for yourselves a burnt
[1:19:49] offering and my servant job shall pray
[1:19:51] for you
[1:19:52] imagine the turn of events just a few
[1:19:55] days ago they're talking about Joe being
[1:19:57] backslid now God is coming and telling
[1:20:00] them you need job the backslid man to
[1:20:03] pray for you because he truly was
[1:20:06] sinless he truly had no hidden besetting
[1:20:10] sin he was truly just under the
[1:20:12] influence of the greatest battle ever
[1:20:15] fought and that is true my brother and
[1:20:17] sister you need to go back and listen to
[1:20:19] the prophet preach that again if that's
[1:20:21] not real to you you are in a battle and
[1:20:24] Satan is so convincing he'll convention
[1:20:27] you it's not worth it you don't belong
[1:20:30] there you can't live it you weren't a
[1:20:32] part of this he is so convincing we can
[1:20:35] walk away believing that but whenever
[1:20:37] the anointing of that spirit is broken
[1:20:39] and we can get back into the presence of
[1:20:42] almighty God we realize what has
[1:20:45] happened here Satan has spun a lie he's
[1:20:48] presented his story he's painted the
[1:20:50] picture but it's not God's picture we
[1:20:54] are God's picture amen we are not
[1:20:57] Satan's picture we are God's picture and
[1:21:00] so it's there that God comes in this
[1:21:02] case and says you know what you go and
[1:21:04] do this and my servant job will pray for
[1:21:07] you and for him will I accept
[1:21:10] I'm not going to accept it look at how
[1:21:12] God's working he's not going to accept
[1:21:13] it from job's religious friends
[1:21:18] God's only going to accept it from job
[1:21:21] the very man
[1:21:23] that they said you guys are crazy for
[1:21:25] believing God sent a prophet
[1:21:29] you guys are just nothing but a bunch of
[1:21:31] cult members
[1:21:34] well I tell you what
[1:21:36] the most amazing thing I've ever saw in
[1:21:38] my life
[1:21:39] is every denomination there is
[1:21:43] tells their churches what to do
[1:21:48] now I'm willing to open up I Pastor
[1:21:50] Grace which is my email
[1:21:52] I'm willing to let you see all of my
[1:21:55] mail
[1:21:56] I'm willing to let you other than the
[1:21:59] sensitive things of dealing with
[1:22:01] people's lives
[1:22:02] read and listen to every voicemail and
[1:22:05] text that I have with other ministers
[1:22:09] and have you show me
[1:22:11] where someone is telling us
[1:22:14] how to live
[1:22:16] someone holding us to an account or
[1:22:18] you'll have to deal with headquarters
[1:22:21] it doesn't exist but the very ones I
[1:22:24] find it ironic Saints the very ones that
[1:22:26] say this is a cult are getting their
[1:22:29] newsletters and their guidelines and
[1:22:30] their online directives and all of what
[1:22:33] your church can and can't do and they're
[1:22:35] getting that and being poured into them
[1:22:36] constantly and they say you're in a cult
[1:22:39] well I'm telling you my brother and
[1:22:40] sister the deceiving Spirit of the day
[1:22:42] is so blunt and it's so out in the open
[1:22:45] but it's not that it's the fact that the
[1:22:48] people are under delusion to believe a
[1:22:50] lie and so it's there that this is
[1:22:52] working that these people were sure job
[1:22:54] was the one that's wrong but here it is
[1:22:56] in job 42 God is telling them you're the
[1:22:59] one who made the mistake you're the one
[1:23:01] who didn't realize what was happening
[1:23:03] the plan of God was going to come to
[1:23:05] pass whether you guys are on board or
[1:23:07] not and you weren't
[1:23:09] but God rich in Mercy says you know what
[1:23:11] I'll tell you what you do you get the
[1:23:13] Realms and you get the Bullocks and you
[1:23:15] go to job and you get him to pray for
[1:23:17] you and from his prayer I'll accept it
[1:23:20] unless I deal with you after your folly
[1:23:24] and in that ye have not spoken of me the
[1:23:28] thing which is right like my servant job
[1:23:30] isn't this amazing joke down here in the
[1:23:33] ash Heap is still talking about how
[1:23:34] great his God is
[1:23:36] but as we shared here already my brother
[1:23:39] and sister when we look at this I wonder
[1:23:41] what they thought when job was there in
[1:23:44] chapter 19 and started to declare this
[1:23:47] this Revelation as it were that was
[1:23:50] unfamiliar to them and he starts to
[1:23:52] declare you know it doesn't matter what
[1:23:54] you guys think my redeemer liveth amen
[1:23:57] and I shall stand in the latter day and
[1:24:00] I owe my skin worms I'm done I'm toast
[1:24:02] but yet God's going to raise this body
[1:24:05] up our resurrection and bring us to a
[1:24:07] place to see that and we will see God my
[1:24:10] brother and sister they would have been
[1:24:12] thinking what is job talking about
[1:24:13] because they just like today were a cold
[1:24:17] formal
[1:24:18] representation
[1:24:20] of their Church
[1:24:24] are we going to be cold
[1:24:27] are we going to be formal
[1:24:29] but I do want to be a representation
[1:24:32] I want to be the right kind of
[1:24:33] representation I want to be able to
[1:24:35] represent that and have my Lord come and
[1:24:37] say you know well done my good and
[1:24:38] faithful servant you were a good
[1:24:40] representation of what I desired
[1:24:42] now we look at this and just see
[1:24:45] how that what happens is as they come
[1:24:48] and they did according as the Lord
[1:24:50] commanded verse 9 and the Lord also
[1:24:52] accepted job see this was a package deal
[1:24:54] job didn't pray a prayer Lord my
[1:24:57] worthless buddies here these no good
[1:24:59] buddies job made an honest from the
[1:25:03] heart sincere prayer concerning them and
[1:25:07] himself because by then he had realized
[1:25:10] all that the plan of God was
[1:25:13] and even in the times that he was low
[1:25:16] and he even had the question mark
[1:25:18] he realized at that point it was all a
[1:25:22] part of God's plan
[1:25:25] and God's plan will come to pass
[1:25:28] we're either on the boat
[1:25:30] or we're not
[1:25:33] amen
[1:25:39] now let's go back to Psalms 1.
[1:25:42] uh
[1:25:45] just uh take just a
[1:25:47] a moment more here
[1:25:51] look how this just rolls right out of
[1:25:53] job
[1:25:55] right into psalm
[1:25:57] now it's man who put the punctuation in
[1:26:00] the spacing and everything in the word
[1:26:01] of God God wrote it as one continuous
[1:26:04] flowing word that come forth and so we
[1:26:07] move now to Psalms 1 1 we read it as our
[1:26:09] opening scripture blessed is the man
[1:26:11] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:26:14] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:26:16] Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[1:26:18] scornful
[1:26:19] oh my brother and sister to realize that
[1:26:22] this plan that God has for us we don't
[1:26:24] need to take advice from the ungodly
[1:26:26] what do we do about what's going on in
[1:26:28] my life I'm struggling I have these
[1:26:30] troubles what do I do that's not the
[1:26:32] place that you get your counsel my
[1:26:34] brother and sister they're going to be
[1:26:35] out there put your wife to work
[1:26:38] they're going to be out there you know
[1:26:40] if you just would get a another job work
[1:26:44] weekends don't you don't need to be in
[1:26:46] church on Sunday
[1:26:47] they give a promotion you know that's
[1:26:48] where the devil invented shift work
[1:26:51] shift differentials
[1:26:54] I can I can work I can work nights
[1:26:57] I can work weekends I'll make another 75
[1:27:00] cents an hour no my brother and sister
[1:27:03] we don't need to go that direction we
[1:27:05] don't need advice from the world's way
[1:27:07] we need God's advice amen and so he said
[1:27:10] look at the effect on job from his
[1:27:12] friends when they started giving him
[1:27:14] counsel that was not godly counsel now I
[1:27:17] know some of this might go for like a
[1:27:19] lead balloon forgive me but I'm telling
[1:27:21] you I'd rather hear the truth and digest
[1:27:23] it than come later and find out that we
[1:27:26] are not you know when the scripture says
[1:27:28] that they're not going to be the ungodly
[1:27:29] is not going to be in the Judgment do
[1:27:32] you understand what that scripture means
[1:27:33] they're not going to come and stand you
[1:27:35] say but they will be judged no they're
[1:27:37] already judged the word has already
[1:27:38] judged them and it's there that just
[1:27:41] what the verdict of the Judgment of the
[1:27:44] word is is what is spoken at the white
[1:27:46] Throne judgment because they're already
[1:27:48] judged by the word but the righteous
[1:27:50] won't be judged my brother and sister
[1:27:52] because they've already been judged
[1:27:54] worthy by the word amen so there will be
[1:27:57] a white Throne judgment don't
[1:27:58] misunderstand there'll be a people
[1:28:00] standing up and their sins and
[1:28:01] everything being laid out before it but
[1:28:04] the judgment's already been done by the
[1:28:06] word
[1:28:07] and so they are not there see when it
[1:28:09] says that the Saints shall judge the
[1:28:11] wicked we're not going to be standing up
[1:28:12] there and going oh that was my old
[1:28:14] friend or my neighbor or my co-worker
[1:28:16] that was and and I'm sorry buddy but you
[1:28:20] know you're guilty
[1:28:22] no you're going to be there
[1:28:24] how are you going to judge them
[1:28:27] the word
[1:28:29] you're not going to be going
[1:28:31] well let's see I gotta let me read all
[1:28:33] the scriptures that you violated
[1:28:36] you know the very same ones that we had
[1:28:37] sometimes violated
[1:28:39] but the blood of Jesus Christ washed us
[1:28:42] and presented us and said we were worthy
[1:28:44] and they never sought forgiveness
[1:28:47] and they're there we don't have to read
[1:28:48] that to them it's already been judged
[1:28:51] get sidetracked on that topic
[1:28:54] so you see you look at this the friends
[1:28:57] had this effect
[1:28:59] and you know
[1:29:01] verse 2
[1:29:03] this Believers Delight is in the law of
[1:29:05] the Lord and in his law doth he meditate
[1:29:08] day and night you know reminds me of the
[1:29:10] song Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus it's not
[1:29:13] this world here
[1:29:14] but I like this as we're closing here
[1:29:18] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[1:29:21] rivers of water this who I am
[1:29:24] somebody going to be kind of selfish
[1:29:25] this morning and just say this is who I
[1:29:28] am amen this is where the word shifted
[1:29:30] and now they're talking about me this is
[1:29:33] not talking about the Heathen not
[1:29:34] talking about anyone else this is where
[1:29:36] the word's talking about me and he me
[1:29:39] shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:29:41] river the water that bringeth forth his
[1:29:44] fruit in his season and his Leaf talking
[1:29:47] pretty positive isn't it it's not coming
[1:29:49] down and saying well now this is God did
[1:29:52] this look we could never be planted it
[1:29:53] had to be God and we could never bring
[1:29:55] forth fruit it'd have to be God's fruit
[1:29:57] and our leaves would never no you know
[1:29:59] why the word has come in that fashion
[1:30:01] right there my brother and sister
[1:30:02] because God's already identified you and
[1:30:05] I as the word it's already identified us
[1:30:09] as being in Christ being one with him
[1:30:12] it's already identified it doesn't need
[1:30:14] to come every single time and say oh
[1:30:17] remember again you are remember again
[1:30:19] you are remember again you are when God
[1:30:21] identified you God identified you you
[1:30:24] forever amen for eternity you're
[1:30:28] identified now it's a human element that
[1:30:30] sometimes will stop and say well it's
[1:30:31] not me it's the lord well yes
[1:30:35] of course it is because if it was us we
[1:30:37] wouldn't last a minute
[1:30:39] it's God Christ in US Christ in you the
[1:30:42] hope of glory
[1:30:44] in that wonderful identified in the New
[1:30:46] Testament as a mystery
[1:30:49] Mysteries have to be revealed Mysteries
[1:30:52] have to be open I want to ask you has
[1:30:54] that mystery been identified in US
[1:30:58] that we in Christ the mystery oh my
[1:31:02] my oh my
[1:31:04] amen
[1:31:06] so let's look at this shall be like the
[1:31:08] tree planted by rivers of water which
[1:31:10] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:31:12] his Leaf also thou not wither and
[1:31:15] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper I like
[1:31:18] this identification I like this I claim
[1:31:22] this my brother and sister because what
[1:31:24] happens is
[1:31:26] drops right back
[1:31:28] to the ungodly
[1:31:31] it didn't leave any area in here there's
[1:31:33] no area in here to say but except for I
[1:31:36] had this happen in my life and but that
[1:31:39] happened in my life and I went to a
[1:31:42] church and had a bad pastor uh we went
[1:31:44] this and had this Pro no that doesn't
[1:31:46] leave any exceptions in there we are
[1:31:48] either my brother and sister the tree or
[1:31:51] we are the ungodly
[1:31:55] um
[1:31:56] y'all okay
[1:31:59] okay
[1:32:03] the ungodly are not so but are like
[1:32:04] chaff which the wind driveth away
[1:32:07] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[1:32:09] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[1:32:11] congregation of the righteous for the
[1:32:14] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[1:32:16] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[1:32:20] now look at how God lays this out we're
[1:32:22] not here this morning my brother and
[1:32:24] sister talking as though we're
[1:32:25] unbelievers we are here as Believers we
[1:32:28] we believe this word of God but
[1:32:30] sometimes Satan just gets us so beat
[1:32:32] down we're just like job and we're just
[1:32:35] like job's friends
[1:32:38] and I don't want to be identified as
[1:32:39] job's friends but in the end job's
[1:32:41] friends even found Redemption
[1:32:44] so even in their in their uh not so
[1:32:47] Godly approach of dealing with their
[1:32:49] brothers and sister and the issues in
[1:32:51] the church and things of life in the
[1:32:53] church and of families in the church
[1:32:55] they didn't do such a good job in their
[1:32:57] treatment and their representation and
[1:33:00] how they lifted them up or pushed them
[1:33:02] down but God come along rich in Mercy
[1:33:04] and said I'll give you another chance
[1:33:06] you're going to make an offering and
[1:33:07] you're going to ask for prayer and I'll
[1:33:09] forgive you oh I say thank you Lord but
[1:33:12] I would rather be the one that says job
[1:33:14] I don't know what's going on in your
[1:33:16] life brother sister I don't name all
[1:33:18] your names this morning I don't know
[1:33:19] what's going on in your life but I'm
[1:33:21] going to lift you up in prayer I'm going
[1:33:23] to stand and say even if you have a
[1:33:24] secret sin even if you have a secret sin
[1:33:27] I'm going to go before my God and say
[1:33:30] Lord come and deal kindly with them deal
[1:33:33] with that take that out of their life
[1:33:35] not to look and say you know what I
[1:33:37] think the reason you're having troubles
[1:33:39] is because you are a sinner no my
[1:33:41] brother and sister I say this morning I
[1:33:43] believe if there's a question mark you
[1:33:46] are having troubles because your sons
[1:33:48] and daughters of God and God said I'm
[1:33:50] going to let you be tested and prove it
[1:33:53] oh Hallelujah blessed is the man blessed
[1:33:57] is the man that could stand in the house
[1:33:59] of the Lord hallelujah
[1:34:02] amen sister Sarah if you would come
[1:34:06] the uncertain sound
[1:34:09] brother Branham says this he says then
[1:34:11] over in Psalms
[1:34:13] the first psalm
[1:34:15] we read this blessed is the man who God
[1:34:17] this is how brother Branham brings this
[1:34:19] out will not impute to him
[1:34:21] unrighteousness or sin but the blessed
[1:34:25] man is a different man
[1:34:27] David's being saying that how blessed he
[1:34:30] was that the blessed man he was like a
[1:34:33] tree that was planted by rivers of water
[1:34:35] Psalms 1 and how that he would bear his
[1:34:38] fruit in the season and the ungodly
[1:34:40] would not be so but he would perish and
[1:34:43] so forth but
[1:34:46] the blessed man
[1:34:48] was God's man
[1:34:50] and I'm going to stand this morning with
[1:34:52] a boldness of confidence of Who We Are
[1:34:56] we are a blessed man of scripture we are
[1:34:59] blessed because we're God's people amen
[1:35:02] we're not standing here as our people
[1:35:04] we're not standing on our ability but
[1:35:06] we're standing on the word of God that
[1:35:10] he put in us and not just put in US my
[1:35:12] brother and sister as an unwanted
[1:35:14] deposit but he put in US of something we
[1:35:17] long for something we desire I long to
[1:35:20] be even a more blessed man I long to be
[1:35:23] even a greater representation of my Lord
[1:35:25] Jesus I long to be able to stand and
[1:35:29] have discernment and judgment as it is
[1:35:31] to pray and to lift up my brother and
[1:35:34] sister to support and stand if someone's
[1:35:37] got to be not one that stands to to keep
[1:35:41] things to hold things says be as it were
[1:35:44] the support be the unknown or the
[1:35:46] unnoticed I don't care my brother and
[1:35:48] sister just so I'm part of God's plan
[1:35:50] that's what I care about because he's

[1:35:55] world not this world it's not our
[1:35:58] churches that give the blessing it's not
[1:36:00] the collective message around the world
