[30:16] when darkness is
[30:23] for now crazy
[30:28] this is it for ha
[30:36] hallelujah I believe we can say Amen
[30:38] this evening he is in the house
[30:41] hallelujah not only in this house as it
[30:44] were this building tonight but in the
[30:47] hearts of sons and daughters of God amen
[30:50] what a privilege my brother and sister
[30:52] you know the prophet of God and these
[30:54] are not his direct words but the prophet
[30:56] of God said God could have chose to
[30:58] dwell anywhere but he chose to dwell in
[31:02] us amen in that beautiful and yet we can
[31:06] still find God in nature we can find him
[31:08] in all of creation
[31:09] but the preeminent place he chose to
[31:12] dwell in was you and I oh my look how
[31:15] beautiful amen you go hike on the
[31:18] mountaintop you look in the canyon the
[31:20] waterfall the breeze is whistling
[31:22] through the pines and we say man this is
[31:24] the most beautiful place and that's
[31:26] nothing compared to the beauty of Christ
[31:28] in you and I hallelujah good to be here
[31:31] tonight I'm just thinking as we was
[31:33] having our prayer requests and and those
[31:37] things just thinking about our brother
[31:38] push aunt sister concha just to continue
[31:41] to lift them up in prayer Amen sister
[31:45] Concha there with her mother sister Vimy
[31:48] and you know Saints we don't we don't
[31:50] always understand and we don't always
[31:52] know the circumstances but I'll just say
[31:55] this from my heart that in the time that
[31:58] sister conscious mother sister V me was
[32:00] here with us
[32:01] never once did I see her hesitate to say
[32:04] amen to the word amen we don't know the
[32:08] effects and so therefore I say that to
[32:11] claim this that I claim her in my
[32:13] prayers as my sister V me Amen not just
[32:16] sister are conscious mother but I claim
[32:19] her as a sister in Christ amen and so we
[32:22] just want to be faithful to lift them up
[32:24] also in all things and we just have so
[32:27] many needs you know I think if we would
[32:30] all just be honest
[32:31] somebody say if you have a need it take
[32:34] the whole service for us to get through
[32:35] all the needs that we have sometimes we
[32:38] just kind of hold them in and that's
[32:39] fine but we just lift those things to
[32:42] the Lord and and just trust him that he
[32:44] would speak to us in and the tie
[32:47] the season amen yeah I kind of feel bad
[32:54] you know brother Manasseh was texted me
[32:57] the other day and I'm just terrible I'm
[32:59] working and my phone is like where is
[33:02] it's on the dash of the pickup it's in
[33:03] the seat of the tractor it's here and
[33:05] there but a man just actually enjoyed
[33:08] that
[33:09] brother Manasseh if you can deal with
[33:11] inattentive Paul here you just keep on
[33:15] texting me amen hallelujah good to see
[33:18] our brother Sergei here tonight I was
[33:19] just telling brother Jason well he's
[33:21] probably out on the road somewhere Lord
[33:23] be with him and walking to church and
[33:26] here he is so we're happy let's just
[33:28] stand I want to speak to you this
[33:29] evening once again on the preparations
[33:32] of the inner man and I want to kind of
[33:35] title this I had several different ways
[33:37] to title this but I brought this out in
[33:41] this way our current condition and so
[33:44] we'll just look at this tonight and not
[33:47] really thinking about making a greater
[33:49] portion of it but knowing that when we
[33:52] start to preach the Word of God that
[33:55] there's no end to it
[33:57] right it's so interconnected we can just
[34:00] go on we can have part 10,000 amen amen
[34:05] god bless you sister sue I missed you
[34:07] amen Galatians the 2nd chapter verses 19
[34:11] and 20 and we'll just look at those real
[34:14] quick amen
[34:17] for I through the law am dead to the law
[34:21] that I might live unto God see we have
[34:26] to choose whether we're gonna live by
[34:28] the law or we're gonna be dead to the
[34:32] law now remember the prophet of God said
[34:34] that he divorced you from your first
[34:37] husband Amen it's always a ticklish
[34:41] subject right if people don't understand
[34:43] that to realize that we have already
[34:46] been divorced from sin
[34:49] amen from bondage and brought into the
[34:52] Liberty which is in Jesus Christ I'm
[34:55] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[34:58] live yet not I
[35:01] but Christ liveth in me and the life
[35:04] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[35:07] the faith of the Son of God now let me
[35:11] just interject this if you don't mind
[35:13] the life I now live in the flesh I live
[35:16] by the confidence the trust that I have
[35:22] in the Son of God can't live in any
[35:24] other way it written on the page even if
[35:29] your name was printed there you would
[35:30] still have to believe and have
[35:34] confidence the life which I now live in
[35:38] the flesh I live by the faith of the Son
[35:40] of God who loved me and gave himself for
[35:43] me
[35:44] Heavenly Father we come tonight just ask
[35:47] you Lord to open this to us make it so
[35:50] real Lord we walk out of here tonight
[35:52] our hearts on fire rejoicing knowing who
[35:56] we are and what you have done for us and
[35:58] father knowing that there is a purpose
[36:00] for everything in our life every trial
[36:03] every struggle every sunny day every
[36:06] dark day everything father is for a
[36:08] purpose and we come Lord knowing that
[36:11] the Holy Ghost moving in our mist
[36:13] washing us by the water of the word
[36:15] father is to keep us into a position
[36:18] father to not let us falter not let us
[36:21] fail but holding us right where you
[36:23] desire for us to be day by day we say
[36:27] thank you Lord we give praise and glory
[36:29] and honor to you today Lord we'd sing
[36:32] songs of praise but Lord let our worship
[36:34] come from the depths of our hearts Lord
[36:37] as we lift you up as our Redeemer our
[36:39] savior our bridegroom oh how we love you
[36:43] today Lord we come Lord tonight just to
[36:47] worship Lord and receive from your word
[36:50] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[36:53] you may be seated you know as I was
[36:58] looking at this there's kind of you
[37:01] might say brought on by a quote and
[37:03] we'll get to it in just a little bit but
[37:06] as we would look at this my brother and
[37:08] sister we would realize that we have to
[37:12] constantly monitor our condition
[37:15] amen you know it's not something that
[37:18] kind of of the old phraseology of once
[37:21] saved always saved now you know that's
[37:23] interesting because the very depth or
[37:26] foundation of a statement like that is
[37:28] absolutely accurate amen the real Bride
[37:31] of Christ before the foundation of the
[37:33] world she's not coming here placed in
[37:35] Laodicea and gonna just fail one day and
[37:37] God turned his back on her
[37:39] amen that's not possible for the word of
[37:41] God teaches different and God is
[37:44] immutable and so we know that he has
[37:46] declared and we believe that so as we
[37:49] look at this we realize that it is a
[37:52] challenge it is the struggle of the
[37:55] Christian now if I use a phrase I don't
[37:58] mean it to be offensive but I'm speaking
[38:01] to the real Christian or the real
[38:03] believer tonight Amen because we can
[38:06] start talking to the unbeliever we have
[38:08] to put all kinds of quantifiers on it we
[38:11] have to put a little sugar here and
[38:13] there we've got to kind of make it
[38:14] appealing but my brother and sister the
[38:16] prophet of God told us that a real
[38:18] Christian the real believer is rugged in
[38:21] fact the real believer is such a
[38:24] believer that you cannot offend them so
[38:27] we realized at the time that we become
[38:29] offended that Satan has actually set a
[38:31] trap for us and injected a little bit of
[38:34] his poison where we become offended over
[38:37] the Word of God or maybe they'll phrase
[38:39] that it was brought in and so we look at
[38:42] that and realize by the grace of God
[38:44] that we have everything that we need
[38:46] tonight my brother and sister and for
[38:48] the days that are coming to be a rugged
[38:51] Christian not a hot house not a hybrid
[38:53] not just a flower that withers when the
[38:56] Sun comes up and things get hotter I
[38:59] didn't include it tonight but the
[39:00] prophet of God said you know sometimes
[39:02] he's talking about Shadrach Meshach and
[39:04] Abednego when the devil turns the heat
[39:06] up amen what happened with Shadrach and
[39:09] meshach they said you know what we're no
[39:12] matter what we'll seal our testimony
[39:14] with our life amen nothing that you can
[39:18] threaten nothing can do can get us to
[39:21] turn our back so when Satan turns the
[39:23] heat up Amen brother branham goes on to
[39:25] say then God turns up the faith in the
[39:28] belly
[39:28] amen so thank you Lord that for every
[39:31] challenge we will face every struggle
[39:33] that we will come to don't get in
[39:35] despair don't say oh how am I going to
[39:37] come out of this okay just believe that
[39:39] God is there and as Satan turns up the
[39:42] heat and gods over here turning up the
[39:44] faith hallelujah all thank you Lord amen
[39:47] so just when we think we can't go any
[39:50] further
[39:50] amen we get up and go further hallelujah
[39:53] first Corinthians amen just want to take
[39:56] quiet it's quite a lengthy reading here
[39:58] and we'll kind of go through it quickly
[40:01] I hope amen but by the grace of God I am
[40:04] what I am now you know that can be taken
[40:07] so many ways right we can use that as an
[40:09] excuse you know the old phrase now if
[40:11] any of your Irish forgive me but you
[40:14] know that used to be you know the
[40:15] Irishman would say well you know I've
[40:18] got a temper you know I'm Irish well
[40:21] hallelujah God broke the cycle and
[40:23] you're no longer Irish your sons and
[40:25] daughters of God amen the family of God
[40:28] whether we proven I trust that it was a
[40:31] linear enough it was clear clarified
[40:35] enough that we realized that the DNA
[40:38] that is in us now not this natural DNA
[40:40] but this natural DNA my brother and
[40:43] sister will live so many years and pass
[40:45] away and you know maybe have children to
[40:48] pass that DNA on but then again you
[40:50] realize all of us are hybrid so in the
[40:55] natural there's no pure DNA you can
[40:57] marry just as Irish as you want to marry
[40:59] Irish or just as much Dutch or whatever
[41:02] it might be but still we as humans are
[41:05] hybrid people a mother and a father
[41:08] right influence from both sides coming
[41:11] in but you see the DNA in us as sons and
[41:14] daughters of God is just as pure as a
[41:17] day that God said let there be light
[41:19] amen there is no pattern no shifting no
[41:24] uh-oh what's the word I'm trying to
[41:26] think of know of turning no shadow of
[41:28] turning
[41:29] amen God just held that just is true so
[41:32] we're just as much sons and daughters of
[41:34] God today as there ever has been through
[41:37] all the generations going right back
[41:39] into creation
[41:41] mence oh hey men by the grace of God I
[41:44] am what I am
[41:46] hallelujah I'm not Irish I'm not Dutch
[41:49] I'm not German had a lot of fun with
[41:51] brother Karl you know brother Karl's
[41:52] just as German his timin can get amen
[41:55] and we got a fair chunk of German in us
[41:57] and I looked him in the face and he's
[42:00] got a great sense of humor
[42:01] I said well praise the Lord brother Karl
[42:03] whatever there is in life I'm not as
[42:05] German as you are
[42:06] hey man and he's like I know brother
[42:09] Paul I know but I can't get rid of it
[42:12] amen oh my by the grace of God I am what
[42:15] I am and His grace which was bestowed
[42:18] upon me was not in vain
[42:21] fare hallelujah but I laboured more
[42:23] abundantly than they all sounds like a
[42:25] boast or doesn't he yet not i but the
[42:28] grace of God which was with me oh my if
[42:31] anybody ever comes along and says why
[42:33] you sure sound like your kind of
[42:35] spiritual or you kind of think you're
[42:36] this and ya know hey look you
[42:38] misunderstood it's not me but it's the
[42:41] grace of God that was placed in me amen
[42:45] but it wasn't my brother sister anything
[42:47] that you and I have done but it was
[42:49] God's grace that DePaul's it come right
[42:51] down and in the time when our human
[42:53] element fails that grace of God kicks in
[42:57] it lifts us right up puts us right in
[42:59] the position that we were called to live
[43:01] in hey men now therefore whether were I
[43:06] or they so we preach and so ye believed
[43:09] now if Christ be preached that he rose
[43:11] from the dead how say some among you
[43:13] that here is no resurrection of the dead
[43:16] but if there be no resurrection of the
[43:18] dead then is Christ not risen right so
[43:22] you got to come along and decide he's
[43:24] he's arisen or he's not hallelujah amen
[43:28] oh wow and if Christ be not risen then
[43:32] is our preaching vain and your faith is
[43:35] also vain you see no way to take a
[43:38] halfway a position on this you know kind
[43:42] of like the guy you know he's there at
[43:43] the Boden and he don't know where
[43:45] they're getting the boat or stay on the
[43:46] dock so he decided to put a foot on the
[43:48] dock and a foot on the boat and it's
[43:50] pretty humorous because you can't do
[43:52] that my brother and sister the dog
[43:54] which I will type as Christ was in
[43:56] movable but the boat under the slightest
[44:00] influence decided it was leaving amen so
[44:04] we can't straddle this there's no
[44:06] there's no straddling the fence as it
[44:08] were amen
[44:10] and then our preaching is vain your
[44:12] faith is also vain yay and we are found
[44:14] false witness of God because we have
[44:16] testified of God that he raised up
[44:19] Christ whom he raised not up if so be
[44:22] that the dead rise not for if the dead
[44:25] rise not then is not Christ raised
[44:29] pretty blunt isn't it gets right down
[44:32] puts it right to the road hey man you're
[44:35] either gonna believe that Christ is
[44:36] risen or you have been living a life in
[44:39] vain
[44:40] now if Christ is risen and I believe we
[44:42] testified tonight of that if Christ is
[44:45] risen then we have nothing to worry
[44:47] about
[44:48] amen because he has settled all at capri
[44:52] he said it is finished and so when he
[44:55] declared it is finished my brother and
[44:57] sister he doesn't write a sequel to that
[45:00] he doesn't change the ending of this
[45:02] story I don't know if you've ever been
[45:04] there I've read books before and it's
[45:06] pretty funny because they get to chapter
[45:08] whatever it is the very ending of the
[45:09] book and then they have a page that
[45:11] allows you to choose which ending you
[45:14] want have you ever read a book like that
[45:17] I read one one time it was kind of a
[45:19] mystery thriller you know and if you
[45:21] want the hero to come out you know
[45:23] smelling like a rose
[45:24] move to page so-and-so if you want the
[45:27] hero to be shot but live through it go
[45:29] to page so-and-so you know how they can
[45:31] just give the alternate ending of what
[45:34] you would please well my brother and
[45:35] sister God didn't come along and say you
[45:37] know what if you want it to be this way
[45:39] go to this portion you want it this way
[45:41] to be this portion he clearly identified
[45:44] that the end would be connected directly
[45:47] with the beginning with no alternatives
[45:50] all praise the Lord amen and if Christ
[45:55] be not raised your faith is in vain ye
[45:57] are yet in your sins then they also
[46:01] which are fallen asleep in Christ are
[46:03] perished let's see this doesn't fit with
[46:06] Hebrews 11 hey men
[46:08] Hebrews 11 lays the platform that they
[46:11] without us
[46:12] amen are not made perfect so it is
[46:15] declared in the very beginning when they
[46:18] come to the position to step from mortal
[46:21] life into immortality that God had
[46:24] already placed it that you and I had to
[46:27] come as conquerors you and I had to come
[46:29] as the overcomer of this day you and I
[46:32] had to be able to say Amen for this word
[46:34] and manifest this word out because they
[46:38] without us see it's not that they died
[46:40] in vain my brother and sister there's a
[46:42] bride on the earth today
[46:44] she's a believer of the word she's
[46:46] manifesting this word the very life of
[46:48] Christ is becoming her life has become
[46:51] her life and she is standing not of her
[46:54] own accord not of her own ability not of
[46:56] her own thinking or her own desire but
[46:59] she's standing there because God
[47:00] ordained it to be such oh hallelujah we
[47:04] ought to have so much confidence in God
[47:06] we just steamroll the devil every single
[47:08] day hallelujah is a sorry devil this is
[47:11] your alternative to the end of the book
[47:14] but I've already read the into the book
[47:16] and it don't match your end of the book
[47:19] and I'm gonna stand with God's into the
[47:21] book hey man says I'm an eternal being
[47:24] created formed filled in the image of
[47:27] God hallelujah so the devil he's trying
[47:30] to write he wants to be an author hey
[47:32] man he's got a lot of people publishing
[47:34] for him but there's some people that are
[47:36] right here on the earth right talking
[47:37] about the second book of Acts is to be
[47:39] written my brother and sister God's not
[47:41] going to pin it with ink and paper he's
[47:44] writing it on the fleshly tables of our
[47:46] heart in this day the manifested word
[47:49] for the hour doesn't need to go back on
[47:51] a page it's already on the page it's
[47:53] being now written in the hearts of sons
[47:56] and daughters of God and they are
[47:58] bringing that word to life oh my brother
[48:01] and sister if it stays on the written
[48:03] page it's a dead letter you can say well
[48:06] Christ is risen I have scripture for it
[48:08] he's going to come fill us with the Holy
[48:10] Ghost
[48:11] I've got scripture for it he's gonna
[48:12] come and take a rapture
[48:14] he's my healer he's a provider but if it
[48:17] don't come off the page it's of no value
[48:19] to you and I and that's why God chosen
[48:22] this
[48:22] our not to put it back on a page again
[48:24] he said I'm gonna let some people live
[48:26] this out Oh hallelujah hallelujah thank
[48:31] you lord amen because I know that those
[48:35] have fallen asleep in Christ are not
[48:37] perished in this life only we have hope
[48:40] in Christ now catch this how many times
[48:42] we can read over things and I'm not
[48:44] saying you don't haven't seen this but I
[48:46] just want to make emphasis if in this
[48:48] life we could put a pause in there in
[48:50] this day right here what is it July 1
[48:53] 2020 in this life right here if that is
[48:58] all we have only have hope in Christ not
[49:02] a manifestation of him not the real
[49:04] goodness we only have a hope then we are
[49:08] men most miserable but I tell you I got
[49:11] more than just a hope I've got to see
[49:13] God I've got the privilege amen and I
[49:15] think you'll say amen to this I've had
[49:17] the privilege to see God manifest
[49:19] himself in every bit of his word I've
[49:22] got to see it come forth I've got to see
[49:24] him come and manifest it come and
[49:26] manifest it come and manifest it oh my
[49:30] brother and sister not just a hope but a
[49:32] reality amen realities reality
[49:36] hallelujah but now is Christ risen from
[49:39] the dead and become the firstfruits of
[49:41] them that slept for since by man came
[49:44] death by man came also the resurrection
[49:46] of the Dead amen
[49:49] for as in Adam all die even so in Christ
[49:54] shall all be made alive but every man in
[49:58] his own order Christ the firstfruits
[50:00] afterward they that are Christ's at his
[50:03] coming then cut the end when he shall
[50:08] have delivered up the kingdom of God
[50:09] even the father when he I'll shut down
[50:12] all rule and all authority and all power
[50:14] for a must reign till he hath put all
[50:17] enemies under his feet oh my brother
[50:20] sister that is a finished work right
[50:23] there every last enemy every last
[50:26] tempter amen now the prophet of God
[50:29] talking about demons amen I've been
[50:31] studying demonology and brother Branham
[50:33] talking about demons and he says
[50:35] look many of you I'm paraphrasing if
[50:37] many of you misunderstand demons are
[50:40] just as real as Angels don't get an idea
[50:44] that they're just some little fluttering
[50:46] thing out here there just is real as
[50:48] angels now my brother and sister when I
[50:52] kind of harp and gripe and two away at
[50:54] certain things it's because they're just
[50:57] as real as angels that means if one come
[51:00] in and set down on the Pew and decided
[51:03] he would just sit here and wait till the
[51:05] next church service or the next month or
[51:07] the next year my brother and sister
[51:09] unless the power of God comes and moves
[51:11] him out of here he'll just sit here and
[51:13] he'll wait for the season when someone
[51:15] comes in under distress and opened up in
[51:17] their spirit and then they'll attack
[51:19] amen you know what the solution to that
[51:21] is kick ease hide out get the presence
[51:28] of God in the church and in our life so
[51:31] strong that demons can't stay there
[51:35] there's the answer
[51:37] come on but we're not going to do that
[51:40] by coddling it now I don't want to
[51:42] offend you Satan come on that's what's
[51:47] happened in a lot of our churches we're
[51:49] afraid to offend the devil oh now
[51:51] somebody will say now brother Paul's
[51:52] calling them people are devil no I'm not
[51:54] no my brother and sister I'm not calling
[51:59] anybody a devil but the devil don't care
[52:02] he simply don't care
[52:05] my Paul I knows
[52:09] Cephas I know who are you it's not going
[52:15] to be by our power not going to be bar
[52:17] might but by the Holy Ghost in our midst
[52:27] with us hold that for another day Paul
[52:31] amen he must reign till he hath put all
[52:36] enemies under his feet the last enemy
[52:37] that shall be destroyed is death
[52:40] now look somebody couldn't say brother
[52:41] Paul you're taking this out of context
[52:43] but my brother and sister I want to just
[52:44] tie this together tonight as we move
[52:46] forward Paul said I die daily
[52:49] so you will find now I hope you stick
[52:51] with me here you will find the
[52:53] culmination of God in this man or woman
[52:57] the son or daughter of God the
[52:59] culmination of God in them the Holy
[53:01] Ghost filling them is that they are
[53:03] willing to put themselves to death they
[53:07] are willing to come to a death and in
[53:10] some cases we know in the Dark Ages and
[53:12] even in the days that we live in right
[53:14] now it is a physical death that can be a
[53:17] type two but my brother and sister the
[53:19] culmination for a son or daughter of God
[53:21] is to come to the place that they are
[53:23] willing to die daily a man willing to
[53:27] crucify this flesh every single day amen
[53:32] not like well you know I'll just hold on
[53:34] to an attitude or spirit or whatever it
[53:36] will be for a season but to recognize
[53:38] that the enemy is what we are fighting
[53:41] against and if I need to vanquish my
[53:43] enemy it might be as simple as Lord
[53:46] forgive me Lord I allow this atmosphere
[53:49] this to be put in a certain way I
[53:51] allowed certain things I raised my voice
[53:53] I was angry I was this or I was loud and
[53:56] Lord forgive me amen the word says don't
[53:59] let the Sun go down on your wrath Amen
[54:01] whether it be family whether it be
[54:03] anyone around you the church whatever it
[54:05] might be my brother and sister I hope
[54:07] you're with me now and understand then
[54:09] I'm not trying to take this out of
[54:10] context I'm not trying to hack up the
[54:12] Word of God but I'm telling you my
[54:14] brother and sister one of the last
[54:16] things that we as message believers and
[54:18] I put that in a very broad spectrum it's
[54:20] going to do is conquer the last aspect
[54:23] or auspice of Satan's influence in our
[54:25] life it might be ever so little might
[54:31] just be a sliver reading a story real
[54:34] live history a historical deal of
[54:36] Vietnam you know and and this man was
[54:38] they were in a fight and and this man
[54:41] ultimately they went to get him up to
[54:45] move on I and he was dead a little
[54:50] sliver had passed through the back of
[54:53] his underneath the back of his helmet
[54:54] into his brain it was there hid in the
[54:57] hair nobody could even see that just the
[55:01] most minut
[55:02] sliver I'll tell you that's all Satan
[55:05] needs to do sometimes is just get a
[55:07] sliver into us we're guarding against
[55:10] great big things and we're looking in
[55:12] this and we've throat all the literature
[55:13] and all the movies and all this and all
[55:15] of that and all the clothes and this and
[55:17] this and this and we throwed it out and
[55:19] then Satan would come in with just a
[55:20] sliver for you I've put all things under
[55:27] his feet but when he say if all things
[55:29] are put under him it's almost a hair too
[55:36] big on the screen or am i at 27 yeah it
[55:43] is manifest that he is excepted which
[55:46] did put all things under him and when
[55:49] all things shall be subdued unto Him
[55:51] then shall the son also himself be
[55:54] subject unto him that put all things
[55:55] under him that God may be all in all
[55:58] amen else what shall they do which are
[56:01] baptized for the dead if the dead rise
[56:03] not at all why are they then baptized
[56:06] for the dead and why stand we in
[56:09] jeopardy every hour I protest by your
[56:12] rejoicing that I have in Christ Jesus
[56:14] our Lord I die daily
[56:19] he's making the declaration that all of
[56:22] this is irrelevant
[56:24] if this don't come out to pass if he
[56:26] isn't risen if all of this is here then
[56:29] we are in jeopardy but he says what he
[56:33] says without saying it right between the
[56:35] lines is then I believe in this so much
[56:38] that I dry
[56:39] jaylee i crucify myself because I
[56:42] believe this word I believe this life I
[56:45] believe what God has done and I'm
[56:47] willing to die or crucify myself daily
[56:50] because I believe this otherwise we
[56:54] would come to the place we'd say well I
[56:55] don't know maybe so maybe not you know
[56:58] it'll be fine I'll just kind of live
[57:00] this way or that way and in the end if
[57:02] it looks like I'm wrong I'll shift over
[57:04] no my brother and sister when passo Paul
[57:06] believed this word he believed it so
[57:08] much he crucified himself he died daily
[57:12] and a given example he come forth
[57:14] because he knew this
[57:16] was a truth well he had a backside of
[57:18] the desert experience and I pray God
[57:20] would be so kind to give you an eye a
[57:22] backside of the desert experience to
[57:24] bring us to the place that through fiery
[57:26] trials if necessary we could come to the
[57:29] place that we are absolutely convinced
[57:31] that there is not one doubt not one
[57:34] thing that would hinder us but when the
[57:36] devil would come and miss whisper in
[57:38] that midnight hour we could say you know
[57:40] what sorry Satan you know you might be
[57:42] here to condemn me but what you're
[57:44] condemning me under is already under the
[57:47] blood what you're condemning me of is
[57:49] already settled it's already finished I
[57:51] don't know what you're talking about
[57:52] hallelujah because the word has already
[57:55] come amen now he says here I protest by
[57:58] your rejoicing which I have in Christ
[58:00] Jesus our Lord
[58:01] I die daily Oh hallelujah what a
[58:05] position he took if after the manner of
[58:08] men I have fought with beasts at ephesus
[58:10] what advantage at me if the dead rise
[58:12] not he just laid it on the line all the
[58:17] sacrifice I've made as a minister of
[58:18] this gospel if this is not going to come
[58:22] to pass then I have labored in vain did
[58:28] he stop laboring no he knew it wasn't in
[58:31] vain he knew he was going to push push
[58:33] right to the reward hallelujah I think
[58:36] we got something in common
[58:37] Amen I think we've got the word for the
[58:40] hour we've got the same anointing Amen
[58:42] the same God same Holy Ghost coming down
[58:45] what they're doing is speaking in very
[58:47] plain words Paul didn't mince any words
[58:49] he said if this is verse then we've just
[58:51] wasted our time but it's not that it is
[58:54] this here and it is not in vain
[58:56] it is a life I was called to and I will
[58:59] live it hallelujah aren't you glad we
[59:01] can say the same thing today Oh
[59:03] hallelujah
[59:05] Amen because it's not in vain my brother
[59:08] and sister amen
[59:10] be not deceived evil communications
[59:12] corrupt good manners well my brother and
[59:15] sister the prophet of God talked about
[59:17] this and I'll just draw it out in a
[59:18] slight parallel he said you know don't
[59:20] you say that you're not a good Christian
[59:22] don't you say that you're sick and all
[59:24] these things he said you're talking the
[59:25] devil's language amen so when we start
[59:28] going off into these round
[59:29] if I'm not this and I'm not that you're
[59:31] talking to Devils language I think it
[59:33] qualify as in evil communication Amen
[59:37] we're telling God we're telling the
[59:39] world we're telling our family whoever
[59:40] it might be around us that we just don't
[59:43] think that God's work is gonna hurt my
[59:48] oh my
[59:49] well the Devils say you're crazy brother
[59:54] Branham says you know they call us the
[59:57] Holy Roller he says I went and looked
[59:58] and studied and went through all of this
[1:00:00] stuff and through all these records and
[1:00:02] there's no church registered nowhere
[1:00:04] that's called Holy Roller he said that's
[1:00:06] a name the devil put on it that's a name
[1:00:10] the devil used to try to scare you away
[1:00:13] from it amen oh my brother and sister
[1:00:16] well you know people get all weirded out
[1:00:18] well they're kind of getting you know
[1:00:20] those folks over there kind of getting
[1:00:22] loose in the joints you know and getting
[1:00:23] kind of noisy and kind of jumping up out
[1:00:25] of their seat once in a while and
[1:00:27] they're doing all this stuff I don't
[1:00:28] know what's going on with them well I'll
[1:00:30] tell you don't worry about it because
[1:00:31] there's no holy rollers here hey man
[1:00:34] that's just the Holy Ghost coming
[1:00:36] through scripture said he has been set
[1:00:39] free it's gonna set on his hands and
[1:00:41] never worship God oh no he's been set
[1:00:45] free is free indeed hallelujah well
[1:00:49] praise the Lord I want to let the world
[1:00:51] know I've been set free
[1:00:52] amen awake to righteousness and sin not
[1:00:55] for some have not the knowledge of God I
[1:00:58] speak this to your shame but some man
[1:01:01] will say how are the dead raised up and
[1:01:03] with what body do they come now fool not
[1:01:07] which thou sowest is not quickened
[1:01:09] except it died now I want you to think
[1:01:13] about this if the word that has been
[1:01:15] quickened to you and I is held in such a
[1:01:19] fashion that we are unwilling now I'm
[1:01:22] not talking about you having to come to
[1:01:23] an altar and have a big old session of
[1:01:25] crying and sobbing and all this stuff
[1:01:27] but my brother and sister if we're not
[1:01:29] going to allow that that God has placed
[1:01:32] in us Amen this very it's black this is
[1:01:36] a paradox its life but we've got to take
[1:01:39] the seed that has been sown and we
[1:01:41] got to come to the stage or the place it
[1:01:44] dies and when it dies it completely
[1:01:48] takes self to the grave it can't take
[1:01:54] portion of us it can't be a suggestion
[1:01:57] that in a certain time maybe will will
[1:02:00] will
[1:02:00] you know adhere to that or move with
[1:02:02] that my brother and sister it has to die
[1:02:05] for the seed to live now you know I'll
[1:02:08] put a natural parallel to that sometimes
[1:02:10] you know you get into farm country
[1:02:12] especially where there's no irrigation
[1:02:14] they rely on the rain and you can plant
[1:02:16] a wheat crop in the late late fall early
[1:02:19] winter and that crop germinate sand and
[1:02:22] it's coming up and you look out and say
[1:02:24] I've got a beautiful field of grain here
[1:02:26] but if it is dry or even freeze dried
[1:02:31] that little seedling will run out of
[1:02:34] moisture and what went under the snow
[1:02:37] which I'm going to put us under a trial
[1:02:38] Amen under a great blanket or depression
[1:02:41] it can go into that looking so good but
[1:02:43] when it the trial is over when all of
[1:02:46] that is gone you've got dead wheat and
[1:02:48] people say well we've got a problem well
[1:02:50] you do have a problem but many times all
[1:02:52] it is is the lack of moisture hey man it
[1:02:55] didn't get routed down hey man it needed
[1:02:57] a little more time to get rooted down in
[1:02:59] the soil it was trying to live just on
[1:03:01] the surface God sent a prophet we got to
[1:03:06] get deeper than God sent a prophet
[1:03:08] because when the trial comes and the
[1:03:11] moisture amen the scripture talks about
[1:03:13] the Holy Ghost being the water to our
[1:03:15] soul when the moisture goes away through
[1:03:17] the trial and temptation we can find
[1:03:19] ourselves drying up and literally
[1:03:21] blowing away but my brother and sister
[1:03:24] when it comes to the place that we
[1:03:25] realize I've got to die but in dying
[1:03:28] amen the scene has already actually
[1:03:31] sprung forth life before it actually
[1:03:34] completely dies so we go down into the
[1:03:37] grave and we commit ourselves to God and
[1:03:39] we are under that influence of the Holy
[1:03:41] Ghost that died to our self but remember
[1:03:44] this seed of life is already outside of
[1:03:47] there springing to life
[1:03:49] oh the Holy Ghost moving on you and I
[1:03:52] bringing something out in us and people
[1:03:54] say well what is
[1:03:55] what's happening with them there sir
[1:03:57] changed a lot there sir this there sure
[1:03:59] that my brother and sister don't worry
[1:04:01] about it we just died that's all but
[1:04:04] there's a seed of life there's something
[1:04:06] that's already sprung up don't worry
[1:04:08] about us we're not climbing in a hole
[1:04:09] like a hermit and gonna live out our
[1:04:11] life like some kind of a vagabond or
[1:04:13] something when that seed of life springs
[1:04:16] forth there's no contention oh I hope
[1:04:18] you're with me
[1:04:19] there's nothing for the seed of life to
[1:04:21] fight will there's no dead self that is
[1:04:24] not quite dead to contest with up
[1:04:26] there's nothing there competing with our
[1:04:29] life or our attraction our commitment of
[1:04:32] who we are that's dead and we've been
[1:04:34] raised up a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:04:36] Oh hallelujah my hope you don't mind me
[1:04:40] being excited tonight hallelujah this
[1:04:44] has just find a been real to me here
[1:04:46] recently amen hallelujah now I want to
[1:04:49] look at adoption but a real
[1:04:53] spirit-filled Church full of the power
[1:04:55] of God let's hope we can say Amen right
[1:04:57] that's us sitting together in heavenly
[1:05:01] places offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:05:03] praises of God the Holy Spirit moving
[1:05:06] among them discerning SiC and calling
[1:05:09] out the things that's among them that's
[1:05:10] wrong
[1:05:11] straightened out and making it flat and
[1:05:13] level now look at this people have a
[1:05:16] problem with this my brother and sister
[1:05:17] people have a real problem with this
[1:05:20] they say well that's not that's that's
[1:05:22] rude that's rude you call those things
[1:05:25] out that's rude to speak so forcefully
[1:05:27] that's rude to to speak the Word of God
[1:05:30] yet someone might say all that would be
[1:05:33] this or that situation and you have no
[1:05:35] right
[1:05:36] you didn't call it whatever you want my
[1:05:37] brother and sister but the prophet of
[1:05:38] God says right here that this is what a
[1:05:41] Holy Ghost filled Church will do it will
[1:05:43] call sin out amen it will flatten those
[1:05:46] things hallelujah now should it be done
[1:05:49] in a rude fashion in a way that would
[1:05:51] humiliate him and and be down on people
[1:05:54] no but my brother and sister let's call
[1:05:57] let's call it like it is
[1:05:59] amen let's not water this down let's not
[1:06:02] put sugar on top of this so we can all
[1:06:04] go home going over as a sweet service
[1:06:05] tonight
[1:06:08] because why always in the presence of
[1:06:11] God is that bloody sacrifice amen
[1:06:16] now remember we went through it this
[1:06:18] morning you wasn't saved by the blood
[1:06:21] you okay let me just you wasn't saved by
[1:06:29] the blood you're kept saved by the blood
[1:06:32] you were saved by grace through faith
[1:06:34] believing God knocked at your heart
[1:06:37] because he predestinated you you looked
[1:06:40] up and believed it accepted it see
[1:06:43] here's the thing my brother and sister
[1:06:45] when we look at predestination we cannot
[1:06:48] throw a free moral agency out the window
[1:06:51] when we look at at predestination
[1:06:54] there's decisions that will be made and
[1:06:56] we will go four years of our life and we
[1:06:59] will fight and we will struggle and then
[1:07:02] when we come because we are sons and
[1:07:04] daughters of God God allows the stage to
[1:07:07] be set that you yourself will make the
[1:07:10] decision God does not come get you in a
[1:07:12] headlock doesn't force you to come to an
[1:07:14] altar he doesn't force you to commit
[1:07:16] your life to Him ask for forgiveness my
[1:07:19] brother's sister God doesn't work that
[1:07:20] way amen so you look at this and realize
[1:07:22] now that you're saved by grace through
[1:07:24] faith God knocks at your heart because
[1:07:26] he predestinated you you looked up and
[1:07:31] believed it accepted it now the blood
[1:07:34] makes an atonement for your sins
[1:07:35] remember I said God does not condemn a
[1:07:38] sinner for sinning he's a sinner to
[1:07:40] begin with he condemns a Christian for
[1:07:43] sinning and then because he has
[1:07:45] condemned him Christ took our
[1:07:47] condemnation so there's no condemnation
[1:07:49] to them which are in Christ Jesus that
[1:07:52] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:07:54] spirit
[1:07:55] hallelujah aren't you glad that we can
[1:07:57] tell Satan take a walk take a walk buddy
[1:08:00] amen we're not sitting here on her own
[1:08:03] we didn't just come we're not identified
[1:08:05] oh I'm a Christian because I go to grace
[1:08:07] Tamra Nicole I'm a Christian because I
[1:08:09] believe God sent a prophet I'm a
[1:08:11] Christian because Christ is in me
[1:08:13] hallelujah amen and if you do anything
[1:08:17] wrong it isn't willfully you don't sin
[1:08:19] willfully a man that sins willfully goes
[1:08:21] out and willful
[1:08:22] sins never come into that body yet but a
[1:08:24] man that's once in there he's dead and
[1:08:27] his life is hid in God through Christ
[1:08:30] sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil
[1:08:33] can't even find him he's so far back in
[1:08:36] there he'll have to come out of there
[1:08:38] before the devil can ever get him and
[1:08:40] the problem is is we do come out there's
[1:08:43] the real problem is we do come out and
[1:08:46] we struggle sometimes and we have
[1:08:47] problems and we say Lord but I believe
[1:08:49] your word and forgive me Lord the lust
[1:08:51] of the flesh and the pride of life heady
[1:08:53] highminded all of these Adam Lord what's
[1:08:55] going on because we came out Amen what
[1:08:58] we're being taught by the word and the
[1:09:00] conditions that we're in is not to come
[1:09:02] out no matter how attractive or whatever
[1:09:05] the bait that Satan uses God's training
[1:09:08] us you say well couldn't you just put
[1:09:09] that down in our heart so strong we
[1:09:10] never would know because then that would
[1:09:12] take free moral agency away so he allows
[1:09:15] you the free moral agency and if I can
[1:09:17] just pick this I'm not preaching to
[1:09:19] anybody Amen except maybe me hallelujah
[1:09:21] but you know what happens is as we get
[1:09:23] over here and there's things in life
[1:09:25] maybe it's something we actually like to
[1:09:26] do in the flesh a certain activity a
[1:09:28] certain thing and we come out my brother
[1:09:31] and sister and we think well I'll be
[1:09:32] okay but then we come and Satan gets all
[1:09:36] over you and he gets in a wrestle and
[1:09:39] you know what what they say never
[1:09:40] wrestle with a pig you both get dirty
[1:09:42] and he enjoyed it that's what it's like
[1:09:46] wrestling with the devil you both are
[1:09:49] dirty and he enjoyed it
[1:09:50] but what happens to a son or daughter of
[1:09:52] God they come and they realize I've been
[1:09:54] wrestling with the devil Lord forgive me
[1:09:56] and they come back in and this grace my
[1:09:59] brother and sister that we were saved by
[1:10:01] it washes you right back up again and
[1:10:03] God don't say well just five more marks
[1:10:06] and you're out oh no he put right in his
[1:10:08] word how many times a day he spent he
[1:10:12] times a day that's what we forgive one
[1:10:16] another now if God expected us to
[1:10:17] forgive one another at that level would
[1:10:19] God not stand on his own word concerning
[1:10:22] you and I so I'm not condoning that we
[1:10:24] go out here and keep track but I'm
[1:10:29] telling you God's grace is sufficient
[1:10:32] hey man hey man you don't still sin
[1:10:35] willfully hey men but a man that's in
[1:10:38] there he's dead in his life is hidden
[1:10:39] God through Christ sealed by the Holy
[1:10:41] Ghost and the devil can't even find him
[1:10:43] somebody ought to say amen to that
[1:10:44] he's so far back in there he'll have to
[1:10:47] come out of there before the devil can
[1:10:48] even get him for you are dead I like
[1:10:52] this there's a little bit what motivated
[1:10:54] this whole service tonight tell a dead
[1:10:57] man he's a hypocrite and see what
[1:10:59] happens
[1:11:00] kick him in the side and say you old
[1:11:02] hypocrite you he'll not say a word and
[1:11:04] that's right he'll just lay there and a
[1:11:07] man that's dead in Christ you call him a
[1:11:09] hypocrite call him anything you want to
[1:11:11] he'll never rise up about it if anything
[1:11:14] he'll slip off somewhere and pray for
[1:11:16] you that's right
[1:11:17] but Oh some of them's very much alive
[1:11:22] that's when I think about we're supposed
[1:11:24] to bury dead people and then that's dead
[1:11:26] in Christ we bury them in water and
[1:11:28] sometimes we buried too many people
[1:11:31] that's alive too much malice and strife
[1:11:33] and there's too much in the church but
[1:11:36] we can't separate that but God does he
[1:11:40] knows his people he knows his sheep he
[1:11:43] knows every voice he knows his children
[1:11:45] he knows who he can call out he knows
[1:11:48] who he's predestinated he knows who he's
[1:11:50] given these things to what he's making
[1:11:53] himself known through oh my how he God
[1:11:57] can put confidence in his children on
[1:12:00] what to do knowing what they'll do
[1:12:03] exactly oh my brother and sister
[1:12:07] sometimes these things come out straight
[1:12:09] maybe they come out a little blunt I'm
[1:12:10] sorry but this is the Word of God
[1:12:12] hey man this is the day that we live in
[1:12:14] and the problem is is when you got
[1:12:16] people somebody said well I did that
[1:12:18] because they pushed my button well you
[1:12:20] push the button on a dead man he won't
[1:12:22] respond hey men they couldn't call you a
[1:12:24] deceiver they can call you you know
[1:12:27] false my brother and sister and I'm not
[1:12:30] asking for sympathy but I'm telling you
[1:12:32] this is real to me because in the last
[1:12:33] year year and a part I've been called a
[1:12:36] deceiver I've been called a liar I've
[1:12:37] been called false but my brother and
[1:12:39] sister I go home
[1:12:41] I cry and I pray and I don't respond
[1:12:45] and I'm not boasting about that but
[1:12:46] there's just something that's been in me
[1:12:48] just leave it alone
[1:12:49] it's not your battle it's the Lord's
[1:12:52] battle stand still and let God take care
[1:12:55] of his hey man you say Oh brother Paul
[1:12:59] we feel sorry for you don't don't my
[1:13:02] brother and sister because you see just
[1:13:05] like you I've got to have my character
[1:13:07] molded that there life that little bit
[1:13:10] of life that would Rebell in me the
[1:13:13] little bit that would want to speak back
[1:13:15] the little bit that would like to take
[1:13:17] as it were the message and say well I
[1:13:19] can prove to you you're wrong but a
[1:13:24] voice says let it go
[1:13:27] pray pray let it go now you might say
[1:13:33] well brother Paul you preached about it
[1:13:34] that's right I have an obligation to you
[1:13:36] Saints amen if the spirits sitting on
[1:13:39] the pew and I will not say there's a
[1:13:42] spirit here we need to deal with then
[1:13:45] the day will come that that spirit will
[1:13:47] blindside you and you'll say what
[1:13:48] happened what happened and it won't be
[1:13:51] your fault it'll be my fault I have no
[1:13:53] plans on standing before God guilty of
[1:13:55] not in their spirits here and we need to
[1:13:58] deal with them but people say well it
[1:14:01] seems like he's sure attacking them
[1:14:02] those are point statements well my
[1:14:04] brother and sister we're not going to
[1:14:06] draw out a great fesus trying to show
[1:14:08] the devil he's wrong in nice polite
[1:14:10] politically correct words amen if the
[1:14:14] spirits here as long and I don't say
[1:14:16] this is a fence please don't take that
[1:14:18] way but as long as I'm pastor I'm gonna
[1:14:20] call the spirit out and you say well
[1:14:22] brother Paul you didn't used to be we're
[1:14:24] that way well forgive me
[1:14:25] but I'm coming that way now I'm gonna
[1:14:27] stand on it and if it's the right thing
[1:14:29] I'm gonna say it if it offends somebody
[1:14:32] I'm sorry but I'm not gonna be
[1:14:34] politically correct when it comes to
[1:14:36] these spirits hallelujah amen so they
[1:14:39] can call you an old hypocrite they can
[1:14:41] call you a deceiver they can call you
[1:14:43] whatever they want to call you my
[1:14:45] brother sister we need to be protein God
[1:14:47] in such a fashion Lord I want to die I
[1:14:50] want to die today I want to die tomorrow
[1:14:52] and I died every day after that that
[1:14:55] when the voice of
[1:14:57] leaf would come and speak that I can say
[1:14:59] oh god help them we're not gonna rise up
[1:15:03] and call them names not gonna come and
[1:15:05] downgrade them my words or deep door

[1:15:11] I'm gonna say lord help them I want to
[1:15:15] see soul save my brother and sister
[1:15:17] there's no room in this word to come to
[1:15:20] the place to say I'm right hmm that's
[1:15:25] pride that's self rising up I'm right
[1:15:30] huh you might be right but your spirits
[1:15:33] wrong and if your spirits wrong you're
[1:15:36] wrong amen god help us
[1:15:38] come on Saints the Apostle Paul I want
[1:15:42] you to just catch this when he said I
[1:15:44] die daily I doubt if we understand the
[1:15:49] battle this is a man that set out to
[1:15:54] kill the Christian that's not a faint of
[1:15:58] heart man that's not a man that's timid
[1:16:01] that's not a man that's easily deterred
[1:16:04] this is a man that had a mission and he
[1:16:07] was going to fulfill that mission this
[1:16:09] is what God called me to do and God
[1:16:11] struck him down and he went to the
[1:16:13] backside of a desert and there he
[1:16:15] realized how wrong he was and my brother
[1:16:18] and sister you can say well he just he
[1:16:20] just struggled with that because he had
[1:16:23] killed them Christians my brother and
[1:16:26] sister I struggled with a lot more than
[1:16:27] just the fact he killed Christians hey
[1:16:30] amen he struggled under the burden of
[1:16:32] the word because you see that day wasn't
[1:16:35] any different than this day oh we think
[1:16:39] who were so enlightened
[1:16:40] yeah go ahead build you a pyramid come
[1:16:47] on how many of us I'm not speaking down
[1:16:51] but I just want to make this point how
[1:16:52] many of us has God called the backside
[1:16:54] of the desert we've got to see the
[1:16:55] supernatural of God moving right in the
[1:16:57] midst and coming back with an open book
[1:17:00] of Revelation you see my brother and
[1:17:03] sister don't sit here and let's get a
[1:17:04] big head about how Revelator we are hey
[1:17:07] man we got a lot of Revelation hey man
[1:17:10] don't take
[1:17:10] from that God's given us a great
[1:17:12] revelation of his word it's been open to
[1:17:14] us but my brother and sister you see he
[1:17:17] knows hey man he knows who's his sheep
[1:17:19] he knows every voice he knows his
[1:17:21] children he knows who he can pull out
[1:17:24] hallelujah he knows and we all have the
[1:17:27] confidence in God to know amen that we
[1:17:30] were called out hallelujah I hope I
[1:17:32] didn't tear that up too bad made sense
[1:17:35] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:17:38] them which are in the same room with
[1:17:41] Christ Jesus right who are them which
[1:17:49] are in Christ Jesus who walk not after
[1:17:52] the flesh she flits flesh is dead now
[1:17:54] can we move forward just a simple fact
[1:17:57] that flesh is dead now amen now you
[1:17:59] might go out and tomorrow struggle with
[1:18:01] the flesh but just to remind yourself
[1:18:03] the flesh is dead hallelujah I don't
[1:18:06] care devil what you're trying to
[1:18:07] resurrect in this flesh the flesh is
[1:18:10] dead hallelujah amen for the law of the
[1:18:15] spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made
[1:18:18] me free from the law of sin and death
[1:18:20] for what the law could not do is that it
[1:18:23] was weak through the flesh amen the law
[1:18:25] my brother and sister that many examples
[1:18:28] a prophet preaches amen the man would go
[1:18:30] he'd offer his offering and a year later
[1:18:32] he'd be back offering an offering again
[1:18:35] for the exact same sin and he never
[1:18:37] overcome it he just shed blood to cover
[1:18:40] it but we're not talking about that see
[1:18:44] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:18:45] Jesus has made me free amen not covering
[1:18:48] it again with the blood amen over and
[1:18:51] over again but free of the law of sin
[1:18:54] and death for what the law couldn't do
[1:18:56] that it was weak through this flesh God
[1:18:59] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:19:01] sinful flesh come on my brother and
[1:19:03] sister imagine how hard it was for those
[1:19:05] people they looked at Jesus Christ and
[1:19:07] they saw a man
[1:19:14] I could be mistaken but I believe in one
[1:19:17] place brother Branham said that God
[1:19:20] allowed Jesus his life to be such that
[1:19:25] it caused them to question is he or
[1:19:28] isn't he
[1:19:31] so Jesus in that position didn't walk
[1:19:35] around as an angelic being his feet a
[1:19:41] foot off the ground going through he
[1:19:44] made decisions he said things that they
[1:19:48] would look at and say is he or isn't he
[1:19:50] I don't know oh my there's a lot of
[1:19:53] people even today I don't believe it's
[1:19:55] here in our church I pray that God it
[1:19:57] isn't but there's people today that are
[1:19:59] still struggling with it is it or isn't
[1:20:01] it
[1:20:01] is this message truth or is it not well
[1:20:04] if the message is words on a page then
[1:20:08] you can struggle all you want but if
[1:20:09] you'll ever catch a revelation that this
[1:20:11] message is Jesus Christ amen you won't
[1:20:14] ever have to stop and say well is it or
[1:20:16] isn't it because if you've met Christ
[1:20:18] you will know it amen there won't be a
[1:20:21] question nobody will talk you out of it
[1:20:23] but if they can talk you into it they
[1:20:25] can talk you out of it
[1:20:26] amen but if the Holy Ghost ever comes
[1:20:29] and touches you you won't be able to be
[1:20:30] talked out of it amen oh happy where my
[1:20:35] hat amen
[1:20:38] the law could not do that is weak
[1:20:39] through the flesh God sending his own
[1:20:41] son the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[1:20:43] sin condemned sin in the flesh that the
[1:20:46] righteousness of the law might be
[1:20:48] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:20:50] flesh but after the spirit
[1:20:51] you know these scriptures take on a new
[1:20:53] life when you realize this is a dead man
[1:20:55] preaching this this is a dead man my
[1:20:58] brother and sister that's standing here
[1:21:00] opening this word to us it was not a
[1:21:03] preacher saying I hope so or it might be
[1:21:05] this is a man that's saying I know for a
[1:21:07] fact Amen when this happened in you
[1:21:09] you'll know it
[1:21:10] amen for they they're after the flesh do
[1:21:13] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:21:15] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:21:16] the Spirit for to be carnally minded is
[1:21:19] death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:21:21] life and peace because the carnal mind
[1:21:24] is enmity against God and then how you
[1:21:26] ever got in the carnal
[1:21:28] mind now look we live in a rat element
[1:21:30] like that my brother and sister that
[1:21:32] will go well you know if I take this job
[1:21:34] ah how's this benefit I take this job it
[1:21:38] has this benefit oh but this job's got
[1:21:41] both benefits but wait this job wants to
[1:21:44] own you so it's not a benefit we're
[1:21:49] always dealing in the flesh but there's
[1:21:55] a difference when you mind that's all
[1:21:59] you're doing is minding I got to get
[1:22:02] ahead a bigger house better car nicer
[1:22:05] vacation better clothes minding
[1:22:08] constantly tending hallelujah for the
[1:22:13] sake of time oh maybe catch that thought
[1:22:15] later for to be carnally minded his
[1:22:17] death be spiritually minded is life and
[1:22:19] peace because the carnal mind is empty
[1:22:21] against God for is not subject to the
[1:22:23] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[1:22:26] they are in the flesh cannot please God
[1:22:29] don't you love verse 9 but you're not in
[1:22:33] the flesh come on Saints you're not in
[1:22:35] the flesh amen but in the spirit if so
[1:22:38] be that the Spirit of God dwell in you
[1:22:41] Oh hallelujah for the Spirit of God to
[1:22:44] dwell in you the spirit of man must be
[1:22:46] dead
[1:22:48] God doesn't cohabitate God wants
[1:22:52] preeminence he wants to Dominion in
[1:22:54] other words he moves in he wants the
[1:22:56] whole house you know ha I just I see
[1:23:00] this you know all the time something I
[1:23:02] would have never dreamed about when I
[1:23:04] was a young man moved out of home and
[1:23:06] was bouncing around the world you know
[1:23:09] people will will put on Craigslist or in
[1:23:12] the paper on the radio I've got a
[1:23:14] three-bedroom house I don't need someone
[1:23:16] to share the rent and they let total
[1:23:19] strangers move right in and start
[1:23:21] sharing their house Wow
[1:23:26] it just wouldn't work for me
[1:23:31] it just would not work they'd be up in
[1:23:33] the middle of the night doing whatever
[1:23:34] they want and I'd be in there like what
[1:23:36] are you doing well we ought to be that
[1:23:42] suspicious of the devil God's not going
[1:23:45] to cohabitate with the devil speech amen
[1:23:48] oh so then that are in the flesh cannot
[1:23:54] please God but you're not in the flesh
[1:23:55] but in the spirit if so be that the
[1:23:57] Spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[1:23:59] man have not the Spirit of Christ he's
[1:24:01] none of his Maya that was pretty blunt
[1:24:04] wasn't it he's not it's not gonna play a
[1:24:09] game there and amen well praise the Lord
[1:24:16] I might need to I don't know how it is I
[1:24:19] just constantly run out of time it's
[1:24:22] just it's just tough
[1:24:30] see Paul speaking I'm just gonna make
[1:24:32] reference instead of reading all this
[1:24:35] Paul speaking he makes this declaration
[1:24:37] I die daily he was laying a foundation
[1:24:41] he was communicating to a Saints that
[1:24:45] this is the position that put Paul where
[1:24:47] he was at is that each and every day
[1:24:51] Paul had to come and submit himself to
[1:24:54] God not once or twice a week not just
[1:24:59] when things were a little out of kilter
[1:25:01] and we want God to hear us but as a
[1:25:04] matter of course he come and surrendered
[1:25:07] or submitted himself every single day
[1:25:11] well brother Paul I pray well that's
[1:25:13] good I pray and and this will be
[1:25:15] something a Saints don't worry about it
[1:25:16] I'm preaching to myself - we all pray
[1:25:19] but did we submit huge difference we can
[1:25:25] pray we can read our Bible but if we
[1:25:27] leave out the ingredient of submitting
[1:25:30] then we've simply just become a
[1:25:32] traditional and we have some tradition
[1:25:35] that we follow well we've been taught
[1:25:37] we've been taught we've been taught the
[1:25:41] Prophet said we've been taught my
[1:25:43] brother and sister you've got to get to
[1:25:45] the place that in that you come and say
[1:25:48] Lord thy will be done there is the
[1:25:52] ingredient amen there's the ingredient
[1:25:54] that submission that must come amen
[1:25:57] now look we jump down here in Romans 8
[1:26:01] and we look at this in verse 11 just
[1:26:04] going quickly amen but if the spirit of
[1:26:07] him that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:26:09] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[1:26:12] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:26:14] mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth
[1:26:17] in you so this is the man my brother and
[1:26:21] sister that has come to the place he has
[1:26:23] died and God moved in God's got the
[1:26:26] house he's got the kitchen he's got the
[1:26:27] master-bedroom he's got the garage he's
[1:26:29] got the family room he's got it all so
[1:26:34] if that spirit that raised up Jesus from
[1:26:37] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:26:41] from the Christ will also what will he
[1:26:42] do will quicken Hill
[1:26:43] bring to life he'll be assumption a
[1:26:47] stirring a raising up and energizing Oh
[1:26:51] hallelujah I also study this scripture
[1:26:53] and kind of the reason it was on my
[1:26:55] heart is I might still get to it but my
[1:26:57] brother and sister I kind of already
[1:26:59] blew it when I the other day but my
[1:27:01] brothers and sister we're not here just
[1:27:02] to be Christians we walk in there
[1:27:04] dragging our feet well I made it to
[1:27:10] church it's Wednesday night
[1:27:12] July 1st come on
[1:27:18] God energized us that would be my prayer
[1:27:21] God energize us amen I come to the house
[1:27:24] of God tonight not just to preach to you
[1:27:26] Saints but to get energized hallelujah I
[1:27:29] didn't come just to be the guy up here
[1:27:31] that gets to do all the talking you know
[1:27:32] people are like well you're up there you
[1:27:34] get to do all talking we don't get a
[1:27:35] respond well hallelujah I'm sorry I'm
[1:27:40] sorry we'll give you next Wednesday hey
[1:27:48] I know a brother one time if I can just
[1:27:50] deviate for just a second or no brother
[1:27:51] one time there's young man in his church
[1:27:53] and he said to home pastor said I just
[1:27:56] know I'm called to preach okay okay just
[1:27:59] keep praying month or two went by pastor
[1:28:01] I just know I'm called to preach said
[1:28:04] okay just keep praying after about six
[1:28:07] or eight months or something I don't
[1:28:08] remember the exact deal now anyways
[1:28:10] young man comes to the pastor and he
[1:28:12] says oh brother say I pastor I just know
[1:28:16] God has called me he said well that's
[1:28:18] good how about you know like three weeks
[1:28:20] away that Wednesday night you you preach
[1:28:23] oh thank you pastor not Wednesday night
[1:28:27] come this is their testimony this is
[1:28:31] their story that young man got up there
[1:28:32] and he was like well I had a thought but
[1:28:48] I can't remember
[1:28:51] what it was closed this Bible of a went
[1:28:55] and sat down come to the pastor a week
[1:28:58] later and he said that tore me up so bad
[1:29:00] pastor I went home
[1:29:01] and I asked the Lord Lord what what did
[1:29:04] I just do what did I just what and he
[1:29:06] said the Lord turned me to a scripture
[1:29:08] and clearly and told me I had a minister
[1:29:11] in the church he said but pastor I
[1:29:13] misunderstood my ministry is to whatever
[1:29:16] is necessary to be done in the church he
[1:29:20] become the groundskeeper he become a
[1:29:22] youth leader he became a lot of things
[1:29:24] but you see he mistook what his calling
[1:29:29] was but one thing I can tell you we
[1:29:33] won't mistake about our calling we were
[1:29:35] all called to be sons and daughters of
[1:29:37] God we're all called to have a ministry
[1:29:40] to Minister the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:29:44] through our life and no greater way to
[1:29:47] minister the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:29:49] through our life is to be dead to our
[1:29:53] flesh and when people would look at you
[1:29:55] and say well I don't think you this and
[1:29:58] you say well praise the Lord
[1:30:00] god bless you otherwise go look it up
[1:30:04] maybe you already have I knew things
[1:30:07] like that might be crazy but I'll have a
[1:30:09] word pop in my head and I can't get it
[1:30:11] out and I'll go back to the message and
[1:30:12] I did this the other day I looked up
[1:30:14] buzz saw
[1:30:15] go look at it man brother branham talks
[1:30:18] about buzz saw pretty regular yeah got a
[1:30:21] temper like a buzz saw got all kinds of
[1:30:23] things like a buzz saw my brother and
[1:30:25] sister if our flesh is dead there's no
[1:30:28] buzzsaw in us amen we are not going to
[1:30:33] respond like an angry Irishman forgive
[1:30:38] me all you believers that are Irish amen
[1:30:42] but my brother and sister you see it'll
[1:30:46] quicken our mortal body by his spirit
[1:30:48] that dwelleth in you therefore brethren
[1:30:50] we are debtors not to the flesh to live
[1:30:52] after flesh
[1:30:53] for if you live after the flesh you
[1:30:54] shall die but that other death is what
[1:30:56] he's talking about but if he through the
[1:30:58] spirit do mortify the deeds of the body
[1:31:00] you shall live for as many as are led by
[1:31:03] the Spirit of God
[1:31:04] they are the sons of God for you have
[1:31:07] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:31:09] to fear but you have received the spirit
[1:31:11] of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father
[1:31:15] amen now one thing I'll say my brother
[1:31:17] and sister now forgive me for bringing
[1:31:19] it out like this but we're gonna come
[1:31:21] down and find out one day under the
[1:31:23] spirit of adoption that God did not
[1:31:25] adopt us as Irishmen and he did not
[1:31:29] adopt us as Germans amen
[1:31:33] unless I would you know balance it all
[1:31:35] out in the church he didn't adopt us as
[1:31:37] Russians or Ukrainians or or French or
[1:31:41] whatever else it is well sure
[1:31:44] Scandinavian or whatever my brother and
[1:31:47] sister he never adopted us that way he
[1:31:49] adopted us under spiritual DNA this is
[1:31:53] my son this is my daughter well
[1:31:58] hallelujah well I tell you what if we're
[1:32:00] gonna act like our father my brother and
[1:32:02] sister we'll have to do most of us a lot
[1:32:04] of dyin to ourselves
[1:32:07] hallelujah now what I need to finish
[1:32:09] this okay we're just right there within
[1:32:12] a few quotes in time evangelist now
[1:32:17] today we say a good church member shakes
[1:32:19] hands with a pastor puts his name from
[1:32:20] the Methodist Baptist Baptist Methodist
[1:32:22] so forth lives a pretty good life now we
[1:32:25] missionaries we see those heathens live
[1:32:28] life that these Americans so-called
[1:32:30] Christians can't compare with by no mean
[1:32:32] whoa now that's an indictment right
[1:32:34] there
[1:32:35] see so if it's a good life all that
[1:32:38] counts then you're saved the same as the
[1:32:39] rest of them by an idol their morals
[1:32:42] would smother us smother over until we
[1:32:45] wouldn't have a chance to stand in their
[1:32:46] presence that's right and their acts but
[1:32:48] that's not it jesus said you must be
[1:32:50] born again in order to be born again
[1:32:51] it's letting yourself low it's letting
[1:32:56] yourself not him forcing you it's
[1:32:58] letting yourself go and die and the
[1:33:02] Spirit of Christ come into you well
[1:33:05] pastor I didn't like what you preached I
[1:33:08] disagree fine
[1:33:18] deikun Gilliam won't work will it will
[1:33:26] be visiting the deacon in the
[1:33:28] penitentiary entirely different death
[1:33:33] hallelujah
[1:33:34] entirely different death oh it's letting
[1:33:38] yourself go and die and the Spirit of
[1:33:40] Christ come into you then you're no more
[1:33:43] yours
[1:33:43] it's Christ in you see the Holy Spirit
[1:33:47] Paul said I die daily yet I live not i
[1:33:49] but Christ liveth in me see Christ o my
[1:33:55] brother and sister we gotta get right
[1:33:57] back down to the basics get down to the
[1:33:59] bare bones the prophet of God was
[1:34:01] pointing us to Christ no other platform
[1:34:04] no other approach Christ and if I told
[1:34:09] you I love this my brother and sister I
[1:34:11] love this and if I told you the spirit
[1:34:14] of John Dillinger was in me I'd have
[1:34:16] guns here and be an outlaw because that
[1:34:19] would be his spirit in me oh I'll tell
[1:34:22] you I wonder sometimes my brother and
[1:34:24] sister when you encounter people that
[1:34:26] are like that buzzsaw
[1:34:27] they are so adamant you're wrong you're
[1:34:30] deceived you're this you're that I
[1:34:31] wonder just what spirit they're
[1:34:33] manifesting hey man they could stood
[1:34:36] before Jesus and said you're Beelzebub
[1:34:38] did Jesus get angry at them and say oh
[1:34:41] yeah now people would say well he did
[1:34:43] speak back that's right that's right he
[1:34:46] identified it what did he do he come
[1:34:48] right in the church and I bear with me
[1:34:49] he come right in the church and he had
[1:34:51] not identified the spirit and he said oh
[1:34:54] now I'm not pointing at anybody so
[1:34:56] nobody misunderstand ya ever your father
[1:34:59] the devil whoa that smoked them they got
[1:35:05] so angry how dare ya we'll have you to
[1:35:11] know our fathers are all dead in the
[1:35:15] wilderness so you didn't like it because
[1:35:21] you see they weren't dead yet because if
[1:35:23] they were dead they would have looked
[1:35:24] and the scripture says that
[1:35:28] that oh let me get these worse they just
[1:35:29] slipped right on my brain how's that go
[1:35:41] brother David the works that I do yeah
[1:35:45] you know so if my work so my my brain
[1:35:48] dis literally flatlined right there
[1:35:49] maybe it's time to close but Jesus told
[1:35:52] him he said you know look my life my
[1:35:55] testimony well will testify of this and
[1:35:59] if it doesn't yes there is you don't
[1:36:03] believe me believe the works that I do I
[1:36:04] just it was on my mind didn't just fled
[1:36:07] yeah
[1:36:08] so see my brother and sister there it
[1:36:09] was he didn't have to call him names in
[1:36:14] that interesting
[1:36:15] when a spirit will come on where someone
[1:36:17] will literally retaliate in their
[1:36:19] disagreement with you and they have to
[1:36:21] do that by demeaning you something wrong
[1:36:25] there somebody's not dead look at this I
[1:36:32] love it
[1:36:32] spirit of Don John Dillinger was in me
[1:36:35] and of guns here
[1:36:36] be an outlaw because that would be his
[1:36:38] spirit in me and if I told you this and
[1:36:42] if I told is the spirit of an artist
[1:36:44] you'd expect me to paint the picture of
[1:36:46] an artist if I tell you I am a Christian
[1:36:50] and the Spirit of Christ is in me or you
[1:36:52] then we do the works of Christ Jesus
[1:36:56] said in Saint John he that believeth on
[1:36:58] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:37:00] he said there are these signs have
[1:37:02] followed them that relief now through
[1:37:04] the age there has been a time that these
[1:37:06] signs has not followed believers that's
[1:37:09] right the Prophet spoke VII spoke about
[1:37:11] over in Zechariah said there would be
[1:37:12] come a time there would not be called
[1:37:14] day or night but in the evening time it
[1:37:17] shall be light Oh hallelujah I think
[1:37:21] will disclose there I still got a little
[1:37:22] bit more but praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:37:25] oh oh this is a short quote short quote
[1:37:30] I I plead I plead something it's a short
[1:37:34] quote but when Christ comes in you've
[1:37:37] created an altar on your heart and your
[1:37:39] sins are taken daily
[1:37:42] the great st. Pauli said I die daily
[1:37:44] nevertheless I live but not me live
[1:37:47] Christ liveth in me there's the inner
[1:37:50] veil Oh hallelujah we talked about
[1:37:54] getting behind the veil prophet of God
[1:37:56] teaches us he said look you can't just
[1:37:58] come up to the veil you can't walk up to
[1:37:59] the veil
[1:38:00] you can't afraid to go through the veil
[1:38:02] you've got to get on the other side of
[1:38:04] the veil my brother and sister and there
[1:38:06] it is when we come to the place that we
[1:38:08] can say with an open honest heart it's
[1:38:10] not me that's living but its Christ II
[1:38:12] in me amen we've stepped beyond the veil
[1:38:16] not words amen anybody can say the words
[1:38:18] but when it comes from the very depth of
[1:38:20] the heart Oh Lord it's not me I can
[1:38:24] acknowledge today Saints it's not me but
[1:38:28] it's Christ living in me otherwise I
[1:38:30] would be a complete failure but thank
[1:38:33] you lord
[1:38:33] and lord I want to stay dead I don't
[1:38:36] want to have to say well you know 15
[1:38:39] years 20 years ago 25 years ago 30 years
[1:38:41] ago I died but today I'll rip your head
[1:38:45] off something wrong maybe that little
[1:38:49] sliver made it underneath the helmet of
[1:38:53] salvation and struck them in the brain
[1:38:56] and they think just because they can
[1:38:59] quote the message quote the Bible
[1:39:02] because they can say the right words
[1:39:05] that they've got it but oh to God that
[1:39:09] the sliver of God's Word would strike us
[1:39:11] in the heart that we could die that he
[1:39:14] could live sister Emmy will you come Oh
[1:39:17] hallelujah
[1:39:18] oh love the Lord tonight Saints isn't he
[1:39:21] good his word is beautiful now forgive
[1:39:25] me first kind of chopping this up but I
[1:39:28] tell you I just get excited my brother
[1:39:30] and sister when I look through the word
[1:39:31] here's daily living amen this is daily
[1:39:34] living then this might not be real super
[1:39:37] super deep but I tell you you've got to
[1:39:39] get deeper than you think to live it
[1:39:41] amen this is no surface relationship
[1:39:43] with Christ otherwise this old flesh
[1:39:46] tells us what to do and to say and they
[1:39:48] looked at me this way and they did this
[1:39:49] and they did that and I'm justified my
[1:39:52] brother and sister you're only justified
[1:39:53] in Jesus
[1:39:54] and nothing of this world right here
[1:39:57] will ever justify any behavior on our
[1:39:59] part but let us just die daily amen now
[1:40:04] kind of skipped over it
[1:40:05] so I'll just interject this maybe you'll
[1:40:08] just go on your own homework look this
[1:40:09] up for the prophet of God talking about
