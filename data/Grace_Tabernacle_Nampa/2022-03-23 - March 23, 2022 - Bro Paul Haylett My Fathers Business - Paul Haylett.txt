name we god bless pray may be seated and i have an announcement brother chris has an announcement so why did you come brother chris um let's be in prayer for this sunday brother jose will be with us and he'll be speaking so let's uh let's pray for brother brother jose lord give them timely message for us amen amen good morning good evening everybody um the brothers play this video real quick uh most of you probably saw on whatsapp this uh today but in case you missed it it's a quick shot of some youth singing at a youth service so they'll play it real quick and then i'll give my announcement when they're ready [Music] uh [Music] man so we've gotten a bunch of uh photos and videos and stuff and all of them have touched me as a individual but for whatever reason this one really struck a chord in my heart maybe it's the youth leader in me i don't know but for me you see that video and it could be any house in the u.s that the the way they live and things is very similar so it just makes it more real to me you know it's easier to connect with someone who day to day their life is similar rather than um and this is nothing against anything um um i'll just leave that there um just easy to connect right we have ukrainian believers here with us and so there's a big connection there um and so just really struck my heart and i was talking to brother barry and what's happened i said you know just uh that one really struck a nerve within me and uh financially in spiritual uh with prayer you know we as a church are helping but i said i wish there was was you know i want to do more um if there's more that we can do um don't hesitate to to ask i know you have a church full of capable people but as always there's always needs um for us to do things as well and so i said maybe we need do they need zoom youth services um or video messages to encourage them and he said hey let me find out so i'm still waiting to hear back but while i'm waiting to hear back i'm going to start doing so we are going to set up um a camera my phone tonight um probably with a simple backdrop with hoffman's head cry something that's familiar and i ask you to volunteer to say you know husband and wife together any youth 10 and up want to say we'll have some guidelines for you to say you know lord bless you your name um don't have to worry about the church part we'll cover that and that you're praying that your heart goes after them just some simple wow guidelines for you to to do that but we'll do that tonight after church so if you want to do it you know that there's this concept one awkward moment but what good can it do right as soon as we saw their faces and their videos there was an instant connection you said this real people that i'm praying for so now if we could turn around and give that back to them and say these are the people who are praying for you i think i mean if i was in a basement in the nest right now huddled down with my world coming to smithereens a little video message would do a lot of good from believers on the other side of the world so that's a guilt trip no i know sometimes people can be camera shy just pretend like you're talking to your brothers and sisters and we want to keep just a few words short and sweet because there's going to be a bunch of them put together so if you can go and participate thank you god bless you amen yeah whenever we can do our part let's do our part uh as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul let's sing number 563 b-flat coming nine master calleth come and dine jesus has a table spread where the saints of god are fed he invites his chosen people come and die with his manna he does feed and supplies our every need old is sweet to stop witches all the time oh come and on master call it coming down you may feast at jesus table all the time he who sent them all to turn the water into white to the hungry call it now come and dine soon the lamb will take his bride to me ever at his side all the horses of heaven will assemble thee vote will be a glorious high all the saints in spotless white and with jesus they will feast eternally [Music] [Music] come and die [Music] hallelujah i'm going to respond to the master's call tonight amen and just come and dine on the word of god amen isn't that beautiful you know it's um just a lovely thing as um we we look into that and i don't know brother ivan sister naughty do you recognize anybody in that little short video yes amen so just to drive the point that brother chris was making you know when you look into that and you say i i know that individual there's a connection there and did you know my brother and sister you were just looking at a part of your family if you had looked at that and said now oh oh that's my brother that's my sister my cousin whatever it might have been there's a greater connection and i i pray that we look at that not just as as oh some some people but uh have a real connection sister bonnie speaking of real connections god bless you tonight amen happy to have you here amen we have a visitor sitting with the young sisters over here i hope that you're blessed amen hallelujah look at that she's even got an arizona suntan and uh so we're happy to have you home hallelujah let's just go into our thought tonight and thank you to the musicians you know it's uh it's always good to be able uh to to look into the word of god and just see the day that we're living in and you know saints we could we can look out and find plenty of things to be concerned about is that not right i mean that's that's correct just all kinds of things to be concerned about but you know uh not to get off my thought tonight but we have to remember that there's two sides to this two sides of the pitcher and the real reality of the world we live in is not what you see out here it's not what you are influenced by out here that's not the real reality my brother and sister the real reality and the world can't see that reality and so they would judge you as maybe different a little odd a little something but i hope tonight we can just touch on these things in such a way that you'll see as it is why the lord has called us to be like we are he didn't call us to be a peculiar people as in strange but in reality we are strange to the world they they just don't know how to deal with with people who who have a a different world view isn't that you know growing up i never heard that word and then it bounced into our society and into our vocabulary a worldview well my brother and sister the world view that i like is the one actually you might think this little strange but the world view i like is the one where satan took jesus up to the pinnacle and said if you'll bow down and serve me all of this will be yours you see i actually like that world view because you know we could be multi-millionaires today we could be important we could be all kinds of things if we had simply heeded satan's invitation these things of this world are his to give away in the present moment but i like that worldview because we look down and realize you know what that's all right satan you might give it to me today but my father has already promised it's already mine and so i'll just wait for when my father gives it to me i don't need as it were the neighbor or someone else to come and give it to me so this world view my brother and sister you might think that's strange i put it that way but you see we actually can see what satan has to offer and by god's grace we actually can look at that and deem the value as unworthy it's not worth what satan wants to put on for a value and let's just stand and go in our bible i want to speak to you on my father's business tonight i want to take that out of luke the second chapter starting uh with verse 40 struggled a little bit on what verse there to take it from because there's uh just uh quite a content there but we'll just come from verse 40 down to verse 52 and we're going to just draw this little font or foundation out of this scripture and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him now remember saints that this is the word made flesh but even the word made flesh had to come to maturity god didn't just have him as a baby born and then be discerning and dealing with the spirits of the age and all of these things he come into a maturity and i love this the child grew young people you ought to read this scripture read it very sincere to your heart as you grow wax strong in the spirit be filled with wisdom which god will give to you and the grace of god will be upon you in fact tonight i'll say strongly i've spoken over the pulpit a few days ago a few services ago none of us are children too young to start praying for the holy ghost and we don't want to drill it in as a command to our children they have to do that but encourage them that they can reach out at a young age and lay claim to that and say you know what lord i want to be filled with your holy spirit i want you to be in control of my life i i want to know you all the days of my life as david spoke amen he was speaking my brother and sister the very hearts desire of the bride that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life amen now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus teared behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it delinquency parent delinquency it's obvious it's obvious i mean anybody who'd lose their child in the mall or on the road last left them at the rest area that's obviously child delinquency or prophecy fulfilled now if you forget your kid somewhere don't go oh it's just prophecy fulfilled okay but you see this was not delinquent parents these parents were under an anointing because god had a work that had to be done and it had to be done in a season in other words he wasn't going to go and get on his own donkey and ride back to fulfill the word of god so god let the parents get caught up in oh didn't we have wonderful special meetings wasn't this a wonderful time god's presence was here and they're amongst family and friends and they're going and then they wake up and say where's our child joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing to have been in the company when another day's journey oh my and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days now they didn't just come back into town and just pick him up right there at the gates of the city but after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers now my brother and sister in a modern time we would have to say this is a genius who has somehow got his master's degree in theology by the time he's 12 years old but this i remind you once again is the word made flesh and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him oh i can't help it i this is a deviation in another's thought but my brother and sister i've been amazed at the answers that god has given me amen i've been amazed at the things the lord spoke to me and it goes against our reasoning it goes against all that we think is the normal avenue and god says if you'll do this then this will take place and i i'll tell you i'm astonished that my god could come down in such a wicked age and he could give the answer to this age to you and i we are not sitting here without answers we're not sitting here without the authority to speak back to the devil when he comes oh i'll tell you what we ought to just admit amen we ought to stop and say how great is my god my god is great hallelujah hallelujah and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us you delinquent child behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing now look my brother and sister you have to understand that as the prophet of god explains to us sorry to keep you standing we'll be done in a second mary birthed jesus the prophet says she was just an incubator joseph is not father mary is technically not mother the word will always correct the air amen thy father and i have saw thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that thou sought me how is it i'm getting ahead of myself excuse me amen with ye not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and looked at this line right here and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these things in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man heavenly father we ask you to bless the service tonight father help me father to just put the right emphasis lord where you desire and we ask you to be with the saints the bride of christ around the world lord no matter what their circumstance is they are still your brother and under your care and under your direction and protection we thank you for that lord in your precious name amen you may be seated now as we look at this my brother and sister we see this time of the passover and how i could see that they you know joseph and mary getting caught up in that and being there with their family and of friends and how it was and they come but you see this as i already alluded to is much bigger than that because god was starting as it were jesus public presentation the the the the um acquaintance as it was of the world with his ministry and so as he is there uh they are they are concerned that where is he and no doubt they were shook up and uh as it come that they come back in those three days they don't find him in the city park now the reason i'm connecting this with my train of thought which is about the temple and the house and all of these kind of things concerning that is because you see he come back to the one very place that ultimately was rightfully you might say he has thrown on earth but would not be given to him as a throne on earth because of prophecy and so it was there that he was not to dwell in houses made uh of men of of you know flesh and blood to build up to construct but he was to dwell in and had no pillow no place to lay his head no no place to call his home and so all of this is coming about to be fulfilled by the word and you know it is sometimes my brother and sister it is well and good can can you i'll help you can follow me tonight my mind is just racing there's times saints i hope you can see what i'm saying here there's times that we actually know we are fulfilling the word of god there's times that we know what we are doing the position we are in is actually fulfilling scripture but there's more times that we are fulfilling scripture that we are completely unaware of and so here is jesus christ amen in the flesh and yet at 12 years old we have no nothing recorded as it is to say that he really knew what he was doing other than the phrase amen and i'm going to turn that as the phrase because he didn't come and say well we got separated and i thought well i'll be safe here at the temple or you know this is uh look mom and dad right here is the lost and found i knew you would come and find me no my brother and sister as he's speaking there mary is is uh speaking from her heart amen and so we don't criticize mary for the instinct of a mother speaking from her heart because no doubt she was sorrowful that her son had disappeared but it's there is he he comes and you know they're amazed when they see him they're sitting now i don't believe they just barged in and interrupted that would have been rude but they come into the temple and they look and no doubt in the temple they're looking around maybe to ask someone have you seen this little boy and uh you know they look in there and there is this circle of the of the priests and theologians and they're all there and sitting in the midst of this circle is their son and they are amazed what is he doing there that's not a position for a little boy but maybe they heard him speaking and as someone would say something to him he would speak back with a knowledge that is not normal you might say for a child of that age now i say this just as a matter of course when i was 12 years old i would have never thought of sitting down with the preachers would never entered my mind nor in the flesh would most preachers allow a 12 year old to enter into their conversation but here he is hearing what they have to say and responding and not only was joseph and mary amazed those that were sitting there i can assure you were amazed that this young man had an insight into the word because he was the word and as the word was budding and coming forth amen it could not be hid no more than as we come into the spring and the the trees start to bud of the leaf you are not amazed that the tree is putting forth a leaf but my brother and sister they were amazed that the word was budding forth out of a mere child and so it was in that place that we see now jesus established and it's here that we see a whole foundation the way i see it i'll just put it down as opinion that we see a whole foundation laid and so they're saying we we've uh sought you with sorrowing and he says in them how is it that ye sought me yours you sought me with sorrowing wish ye not that i must be about my father's business now the word whist means knowledge or intelligence don't you know he's speaking to them and saying don't you know i must be about my father's business i'm not the son of a carpenter i am not just another child that come out of nazareth i'm not just another you know as it were child of the streets just following in the footsteps of of our our traditions but i'm here to do my father's business and he is maybe you could take this in a form of a mild rebuke don't you know don't you understand mom don't you remember mary don't you remember when the angel met you and told you exactly what was going to happen has it become so easy saint that we can experience and i say this to you tonight we experience a supernatural and it's not long before we have almost put it as commonplace i pray god never let us turn the supernatural into something common we ought to hold to those things when god has done the miraculous in your life you want to hold to those things as it were to mark a memorial not to worship the memorial but to mark that as a remembrance in your life that god has healed me amen i want to just kind of make this real has god healed anyone here tonight amen so as we've seen god as a healer we should never let that just be commonplace that passes through the years and somebody talks about well i'm desiring healing well i tell you what don't be bashful don't be ashamed step forward and say brother sister pray for that claim that i have been healed this is real it's not just talk from the word but i stand here today having been delivered of spirits having been provided for in the times of impossibility be able to be a witness an example would be and i don't say this boastfully but an example would be is we're in florida the little church here that hosted the marriage conference they're speaking of this openly how that they're desiring to own their own building they share a building with another church and they desire to own their own building and it seems as though every bit of money they save the real estate prices go up accordingly and when i heard the brother speaking that it struck a chord with me and i said i know what that is we know what that is to save a little more money and see the price just increase you're no closer but then my brother and sister i this is how i view it today i don't view it as lucky i don't view it as circumstantial i view it as supernatural that one day we can drive by and there's a sign in front of this building and not only is a sign in front of this building they choose to price it within the reach of the saints i believe it's supernatural my brother and sister because we look and write not long after that not long after that we see the prices start to increase and you look and you say well hallelujah maybe we would have but as it was i felt anointed and brother stacy the pastor there i went to him and i said brother stacey i want to share this with you and i spoke a little short trying to make it abbreviated i won't make a claim that it was abbreviated i tried to make it abbreviated and he looked me in the face and he says thank you. that gives me hope why someone looking for healing someone looking for deliverance someone looking for provision it's good to know that it's real hallelujah amen let's not pull back and say well you know i don't want to sound like i'm boasting or i don't want to sound like blah blah blah my brother and sister just speak it just speak it you speak it in sincerity they'll receive it in sincerity so it's there that that he's sharing these things and they're amazed and then he tells him how is it that she sought me wished ye not that i must be about my father's business now you look at that and and he like i said he's questioning them don't you know or have the knowledge or the intelligence of who i am have you forgotten already what the angel said and what my purpose here is and so when i look at this my brother and sister i myself prefer to believe at 12 years old that jesus christ knew what his business was i don't believe he was wondering there might have been parts that god did not reveal to him at that age but it's there that he already knew there was a supernatural knowledge that was coming from him and so you know he's he's going about his father business business there and he speaks to him and verse 50 says they understood not the saying which he spake unto them so i want you to understand this now as jesus is speaking or responding to their statement and he's declaring to them don't you know that i'm supposed to be about my father's business how is it that you sought me i'm doing what i'm supposed to do and it went right over their head probably like what is our little voice saying did you catch that no i didn't oh well you see god knew exactly how to shield how to arrange how to position now you look at this my brother and sister it's actually very relevant because you see god actually wanted the body as we would look of jesus christ to come into maturity before he actually began his work so we'll see little tidbits through history but from 12 to 33 you're not going to see jesus casting out demons you're not going to see him making water into wine you're not going to see him breaking the loave my brother and sister you're not going to see but when he comes there is supernatural things he is doing things don't misunderstand me but he is not then you might say into the maturity of his ministry and so when he comes into the maturity of his ministry when the season is right then there it is he's a mature man and he is able then into the realm of warfare spiritual warfare right now we look at this and realize there was a lot of things threats and and things uh times that they chose tried to seize jesus and and they couldn't he slipped through their miss my brother and sister remember the whole foundation of it all is not physical right it's not flesh and blood it is a spiritual warfare that is taking place so we can go over here and say i i told this person off or i did this or i did that but if you're just working against the flesh you've accomplished nothing oh but boy howdy we like our flesh and my opinion is just my opinion but it actually is just a tad bit more important than your opinion so says i do we not struggle sometimes with that but you see the warfare is not flesh and blood it's not opinion it's a spiritual warfare and then the word becomes the foundation by which we fight there is no other you say fight yes it is my brother and sister sometimes you deal with spirits that would just love to crash the party amen they would love to be there so they understood not the saying which he spoke to them or uh spake unto them but my brother and sister you see once again i want to reiterate this supernatural beginnings can fade into a natural everyday life amen so if we forget the supernatural beginnings that we have now if you want to just a little view of supernatural beginning look at predestination look at the very fact that god before amen he supernaturally knew your heart come on saints he supernaturally knew your heart before your flesh man was flesh man so he didn't say i'm observing their behavior and saying i think that's a believer before we were even a speck amen he discerned through the ages and said there is one that the seed of life the germ of life will be dermatized it wasn't dermatized at that time there are people around the message they're talking about oh we were a dermatized seed before the foundation of the world no we were a seed amen we were not germatized it's when the word came to us was revealed and our heart opened up that the germ of life took life and started to manifest the life the life had to be in the seed right i just planted a few million seeds today yeah literally my brother and sister i wouldn't be out there planting that if i didn't think the germ of life was in it but i can take that grain of wheat and lay it on top of this and leave it there for a hundred years and it won't do a thing but god looked down and said the germ of life is in you term of life is there i'm recording this i'm doing it i have a little different view maybe i don't know maybe it's just the way i approach it but you know the lamb's book of life my brother and sister was a testament that god gave before the foundation of the world and as it were he said in that i know who's mine and i know it well enough i'll write it in this book right here so that later if anyone really wants to see what is happening here there they are here they are right here i've got their name in the book and here they are manifesting the very life proving predestination is supernatural not a guessing game some will some won't some will some won't no god knew so that's a supernatural beginning so your very existence is a supernatural beginning and so god supernaturally knew your heart amen and in that he knew exactly what he was going to do so as we look now my brother and sister the word has come in this day and this is just a very simple statement the word has come in this day to separate us from the religious spirits of the day do you realize what god is doing sometimes with the preaching of the word or the opening of the word he is not separating now i hope you catch this he's not separating individuals he's separating spirits remember this flesh man really means nothing to god oh god's gonna clean it up here what's on the inside will come to the outside so the outside will be clean my brother and sister but god's not redeeming the outside and so god's not really looking as it is to bring the word to the flesh man he's bringing the word to the spirit man and so it's in the realm of the spirit man that we then are activated or or energized to the word of god and so the word has come to separate us from the religious spirit to have the holy spirit amen because the religious spirits we'll get a little further in this if i'll just hurry along religious spirits are there my brother and sister but the holy spirit is what god looks at so the guy who is so pious the guy who is so knowledgeable can quote scriptures and quotes and whatever else just and we're amazed by that doesn't mean a single thing my brother and sister god's looking at the spirit amen and so it's there that our hunger and thirst see we're being separated from these religious spirits now this goes really deep and you're believers and you've been studying the word you understand this but you see religious spirits the prophet of god shows us that religious spirits many times are looking for a position many many times they're looking for prosperity they're looking for these things bigger churches bigger choirs do we have a choir oh we missed that one they're looking for the finer things right they tear down a nice church to build a bigger church and then they have a campaign to find more people to fill the bigger church so they can go and build a bigger church to have a campaign to find more people to fill the bigger church so really their goal is not to get people in a rapture their goal is to fill up a bigger and bigger church religious spirits so you look at that and realize that the word coming in our day my brother and sister is just as a young man i worked for a cattle ranch many times i was ran over by cattle because i was the lucky guy to stand on the sorting gate and when you have uh you know a 800 pound steer that says i don't care what you think i'm going left little me was not going to stop him and a metal gate's not going to stop him he's determined to go left but i'll tell you what once they crunch the gate and they fall down and their eyes are crossed you at that point convince them to go the direction you want them to does that ever happen to you oh i have a serve a loving god you sure do so much that he's going to let you get knocked well i won't use that term amen but anyway you will be there a little cross-eyed and then god will say now you'll go the direction i want you to go you see so it's there in that time and place that god is working on us and so the word has come to separate us from the spirits that are trying to separate us from the holy ghost if we realized how many spirits there were saints that are trying to separate you from the holy ghost we would be shocked but hey praise the lord all we've got to do is have our eyes open and realize there's more with us than there is against us so by god's grace amen we can press forward now the thing is is to be separated from the spirit of the day brings us to a place then that our hunger and thirst can be for christ alone now i was just reading brother and sister some things that the prophet of god was sharing and he's talking about how that there are are these people and um you know a wife often times sad for us men but a wife often times gives her heart to the lord and she's trying to encourage and influence a husband to serve god but the man is just stubborn he's stuck in his ways he's he's just bullheaded and and he's pressing forward just doing what he's going to do and doesn't want any part of this but my brother and sister do you understand and i just take this from an example out of a message the prophet is speaking about this you understand that it can't quench the thirst of the wife does she have trouble and travail she has bitter tears and struggles and sleepless nights and she has trials that seem insurmountable if you'd like to hear something that goes well with that go listen to brother danny stevens testimony of his parents very compelling testimony of a dad who has determined that his wife is not going to follow that man yeah encourage you listen to it because you see my brother and sister what happens is as as he pushes back brother john steeman pushes back against his wife her hunger and thirst didn't decline it increased as she is being as it would be pushed out into the desert impossible to be in services impossible to be in church what happens is is the hunger and thirst didn't wither away the hunger and thirst increased to the point the day come and i when i listen to this it's compelling to me the day come and he says if you go to those services when you come home me and the children will not be here and we won't come back and so she has a decision to make and then she says i'm going and it's in that moment right there he realized that she was willing to sacrifice everything for the message amen and i love this part right here i might not have the words exactly right but she heads starts turns to go to the door and all of a sudden he kind of hollers out wait i'll go with you he gave his heart to the lord and pastored a church for many many many years hallelujah you see my brother and sister our hunger and thirst is not to pacify this flesh or our our our mind you know and the world we live in to pacify that our hunger and thirst is there to be satisfied by the holy ghost aren't you glad of that otherwise the world the devil as i started this service would just offer you more he would offer you more and i remember a statement a man made one time and he said everyone he makes it as an emphatic statement everyone has a price he said i just pray to god that mine is high enough that it's never met hallelujah lord let my hunger and thirst be for you and you alone let my desire be for you and you alone lord that satan would never have something before us now look i i like i don't know do any of you like reading questions and answers i i actually like reading questions and answers you know it's not really a sermon in a way but but you go in there because you know what it's not you but it's people like you that are asking these questions i identify sometimes as i'm reading this i could see me there if i'd had that opportunity to be there at that time i could see me asking that question question and answer is brother brown make statement now we're jumping right into this so you can look at the date you can go study this if you want but i'm jumping into the story he said however he was telling me a little story once he said that when there's certain peoples his wife they were staying with and he had gathered all of his old stuff up in an old broke up truck and started out of town and his wife said you know what i ought to have got a drink of water before i left that place said i'm thirsty and he said well honey there's a hydrant said well we'll go on till you hit a better place you know i i didn't actually climb in the water but i preached services in south america and they had forest fire sister jerry would remember this well they had forest fire tore through their area everything's burned black now it's just water ashes and mud ugly dingy a brother told me he says brother paul this used to be so beautiful the trees shadowed the water and the water was nice and cool and you could stand in the shade of the trees and watch a baptism take place but here it is now a little dingy ash covered mud hole i don't know jerry won't remember either but that brother must have been like 80 something years old and to watch him they're like well we're going to baptize our brother so and so the deacons got down in the water now we know this pastor i preached for him many times and and he's a great orator and i know his his program is he's put his arm around this brother and would have talked about how he come to the lord and what the lord had delivered him from but you see my brother and sister that brother wanted to be baptized so bad he didn't even see that there was a pastor standing there and he just went right out into the water the pastor's there's like uh but you see he was so hunger and thirsting and knew that baptism was this key in his life and he had sought that and god had granted him salvation and he wanted to get it done so then the pastor just had to preach and it was kind of sad but funny at the same time because the water actually was a little bit chilly and pretty soon you could look down and the old brother is standing in the water because this pastor is going to have his word isn't that interesting how pastors are but the old brother is standing down there now he's got the shivers and then to see them two deacons put their arm around him and just pull them right up close didn't do away with the shivers but you could see this this light coming up in him my brother and sister hunger and thirst is an amazing amen now look at this she says you know what i've got a drink of water before i left that place said i'm thirsty well he said honey there's a hydrant hmm i ain't gonna get baptized until it's the perfect place water temperature yeah beautiful backdrop got the camera okay everything no come on she said there i i'll go i'll hit a better place there's got to be a better place to get a drink you see and he went on a little further and said there's another hydrant said well we'll just go ahead you see but said then when she got out in the country there was no pump and she was just fighting for a drink of water and after a while way over in the field was an old country pump way out in the field plum across through a bunch of cattle and she was afraid of the cattle oh my brother and sister comes a time no matter what the devil throws out he throws a little spook you know that message that william branham thing is a cult started by a man have you ever done that well i'm old school i'd be there you guys would all been like had the same answer it took me hours to find wait every known church on the face of the earth has a man that they take it back to but because they don't like you oh you say don't like me yeah they don't like you they don't like the word they don't like the word saints oh they don't they they like you some of them would just think you're the finest people they don't like you because you have become the word made flesh and they don't like the word walking in the flesh because it condemns their program it condemns their their their denominational spirit their hierarchy it condemns that then we just got down in the country no pump oh my isn't that how god works sometimes we just thought we were going to be fine i believe the message god run you plumb out in the country where the very thing that you fear you come desperate enough amen switch that page if you would brother mage mason but she said she said levi i just got to have a drink so he stopped the car and said before he could even get the car hardly stopped she was out and had that cutting across the fence she had to have water and when god becomes that real to you when you thirst like that amen stop this car stop this life i've got to have a drink something must be satisfied oh hallelujah amen when you thirst like that it's either god or you'll die you can't stand it any longer than something's going to happen my brother and sister we can preach and i enjoy the preaching i believe in the preaching but we can preach you've got to have the holy ghost you need to be born again but until now don't you guys know i love you so you won't misunderstand but until you are thirsty enough to be born again it will just be preaching but when we and i include myself in there get thirsty enough for the things of god god will open the door and it will happen and then you hear people say well we're going to move away from this church because we're just not fed i'm sorry you look plenty fat in the natural forgive me but you look like a skinny cow in the spiritual and you're blaming your appetite on the preacher i'm not defending preachers you know that you see it all comes back to us lord let me be hungry lord let me be thirsty but also lord give me that revelation as we see what is said about jesus amen that he was lit raised up in knowledge and understanding lord let that knowledge and understanding come down to me that i can quench this hunger i can quench this thirst i won't go get a beer bottle to do it i won't become a junkie for sports i won't become whatever of the world but i can find that place that satisfies the hunger and thirst in my soul amen and not just a sweet bite you know somebody i i met a few people excuse me but i met a few people that they was they've read the same things i read about food you know those that you know me for a long time know the chunky me and really inside i'm still the chunky me amen hey look there's one more piece of apple pie left in the pan and then one of you have to walk by and say brother paul surely you're not going to eat that the chunky me wants that piece of pie did you know that they say that the first depending on the food the first two to three bites is the highest sensory value you'll ever receive out of that food are you with me kind of a different analogy here and some people come and they take a bite of the good things of god and they've been reading that same book and said this is as good as it gets right here and they walk away amen if i was to eat more of that it wouldn't do anything more for me but you see the words just a little bit different amen you've got to eat enough of the word for it to make it all the way down into every cell and fiber of your body and when the word has made down to every cell and fiber of your body then you're ready to do god's business amen not worried about the world not worried about that but look at this now amen you can't stand any longer something's going to happen you you've got to get to business then with god that's when you take it takes place now these evil spirits this is kind of a shift in thought here saints but i want you to catch this i included it for this reason now these evil spirits deceive people and of them spirits many times are very religious now you say you mean religious yes sir even teach the scriptures the bible they sure do now notice jesus came to a bunch of men those holy priests the preachers and they kept the laws to the letter and they were very very religious amen hallelujah and jesus john called them said you generation of vipers that snakes who warned you who's warned you to flee from the wrath to come and when jesus saw them right so here it is john now when jesus saw them amen you are of your father the devil that was god saying that that wasn't an angry preacher that wasn't some man they said this is nothing but a carpenter's son what does he know where did he ever come from uh we can trace our lineage all the way back and they're talking to the very one that was the one that was in control of their lineage and i i want you to grasp that okay in control of the lineage and they're trying to talk to them as though you're you don't know nothing but look at this now just as religious as they could be remember when the devil takes his man but never his spirit god takes his man but never his spirit see the holy spirit comes into your life sanctifies your spirit lives through you amen not lives on you but when your spirit goes on your spirit is kept with god but the holy spirit was on you comes on somebody else and somebody else and somebody don't you just love that i like that amen so as you look at this now it says you see how this is coming back amen that was on now look at this jesus john called them said you generate survivors that snakes warned you to flee you're of your father the devil that was god saying that just as religious takes that but now look at this your spirit kept with god what do we have to fear what do we have to fear we did not leave as it were the value of our life with someone with loose pockets we left our life with the very giver of life what do we have to fear you know some might say oh i'm afraid to fly in an airplane i'm going to die you can't die until god says you're going to die and you could be locked in the biggest fortress and never wake up the keeper amen amen amen now look at this this spirit was upon elijah come upon elisha a double portion of it 700 years later or 800 years later come upon john the baptist made him act now look how elijah look how elijah was big old hairy man whiskers all over him i like brother brown has a sense of humor i'm telling you some people act like he is just deaf on everybody but he has a sense of humor sheepskin looked like a fuzzy worm his face out like that stomping down there with big old piece of leather around his girdles like girl around his loins like this and if you would have if he would have walked up to your house hallelujah people have turned god's prophets god's messengers god's men turned them into these refined little effeminate look what the devil's doing to the ministry go turn on a tv go turn onto youtube go turn on what and see the big names in the ministry now and they'll be standing out in front of the people and they'll be talking to you with their knees together and their hands out like this check it out you want to save yourself a nightmare don't see what's happening that big hairy stan um my call please right quick such a fellow standing in front of my door but that was a prophet of the lord sure was and then when he died a double portion of his spirit come upon elijah and then when 800 years later uh anyway brother brown that says that it's fine 800 years later come upon john the baptist and made john j act just exactly like they did because it was the spirit of elijah now look at that spirit comes right down amen god didn't have to come as it were and have an envelope and say now i'm going to pass this down to my servant david and when he receives this now he'll be anointed no sir no sir god said i know from the foundation of the world who my servants are who my ministers are who my prophets are who's going to speak for me and who's going to act out the word and so it's there amen 800 years later come on john the baptist made john act just exactly like they did because it was the spirit of elijah now if the spirit of elijah upon john would make john act like elijah the spirit of god upon you will make you act like jesus oh lord i want your spirit amen lord i ask you tonight in all sincerity and i'm not just preaching to you saints i'm asking the lord to pour his spirit out on us because i want to act like him i don't want to be a different spirit a different nature and just say i'm a christian amen christian is christ-like amen so we don't want to be just paper christians we want to be the real thing amen some old chinese proverb about no war was ever won with a paper tiger you need to fight like the real one anointed with the spirit of the tiger if you're going to win the battle we're going to be anointed with the spirit of our god our father the lord jesus christ amen all things were made by him and for him so that we could fulfill the word of god and so with that anointing on us my brother and sister there is no reason can i say this emphatically no reason for you and i not to act like jesus christ i'm irish i'm this i i was raised poor i was raised on this i'm an only child i this i that my brother and sister forget that nonsense there's nothing stopping us from acting like jesus christ hallelujah can i get an amen out of that now there's where you find the holy spirit see that's what the holy spirit does it makes you meek makes you humble makes you forgiving now i tell you what i've met a few grudge bearers there's banner bearers in the army right they hold up the the flags and the and you know all the banners of war and whatever i've met more than one person that was a grudge banner bearer i'm actually proud of it this person did me wrong 24 years three months six days four hours 32 seconds ago and until he repents god will never bless him seriously come on i tell you what i want to do i want to be like christ i want to be like my lord jesus christ and if i'm offended oh saint you'd say brother paul we've seen you you kind of got offended yes i'll admit i've kind of gone offended in the last year or two god forgive me for that but that doesn't mean that the word can't come even if i have failed the test doesn't mean i can't come and say this is god's expectation and then you live up to it i will live up to it and we'll all be blessed oh hallelujah amen amen amen amen now look i this is not in this quote but it's it's just there i put this matthew 5 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they might be lucky enough to be filled no sir this is i don't know the proper words of this but this my brother and sister is a positive statement this is a must statement right here i know there's proper english things to identify that but you look at that my brother and sister they shall be filled i'm claiming that i'm claiming that today praise the lord now look at this amen as we just move forward amen now i would say and i left some of this out because it just was growing growing it's wednesday night and i'm glad i did because i'm just about out of time but the prophet of god speaking about this and and what struck my heart as i was studying this was just the prayer actually what it is i i'm sorry i was going to write down the service but brother branham invites brother neville up to open in prayer i don't know if you'll realize this but brother neville's daughter sat right here in our midst the other day and grandchildren and some people are like well you know we they had to remove brother neville from the pulpit because i guess because brother brown didn't know what he was talking about because he spoke of the highest terms of this man and brother neville prays this prayer and it stirred my heart and in the end after reading that i wrote in the notes dear lord let me let me be about my father's business i i don't want to get caught up now brother and sister that's fine either you know god doesn't take all of this away from us some of us have been motivated in our life maybe more than we should have about things of business natural but you know what god help us to step over here and be about our father's business amen not worried about as it were i hope this isn't offensive to you not a a uh worried about when and where we're gonna make the next million and what we're gonna invest it in and how we're gonna make another one beyond that but i say that's well and good if you have that ability and god opens those doors but what's more important than that is to be about our father's business amen and his business is not houses and lands it is not of material things it's of eternal things and that's what god wants us amen now brother brahm says here in influence do you know that every one of you is an influencer social media influencers people get all like oh i dress like so and so why well they're an influencer hallelujah that's why we dress like sons and daughters of god because we are influencers praise the lord thank you lord i can be an influencer after all jesus said you're the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savor it henceforth it's good for nothing cast out trot under the feet of men we must you know i didn't emphasize this to the brothers but really maybe i should have because in my mind it was we must never forget that so there's certain things in the gospel the way that it's brought to us we should as it were make it bold i don't know how big the font your brain can hold but maybe you need to put it in bright red and make it as large a font so you never forget that oh cool we are salt but if a salt loses its strength that's its power to contact and salt can only save as it contacts but if it loses its power of contact then it's no more salt but it's sand it is to be made walks but when we lose our influence now look at what he's talking about contacts my brother and sister this is not the salt checker at the dinner table i'll never know what the taste of salt is if i never turn the salt shaker over sister jerry just bought a new salt shaker i'm telling you it wants you to know the taste of salt you turn that thing over and it's got like a five horsepower motor in there and it goes and you got pile of salt on you what it's got to do it's got to come in contact do you know your neighbor do you know your schoolmate your co-worker see there's our point of contact if we hide out you know i suggested it once but you guys voted it down if you'll remember i said let's all sell everything we got there was this huge ranch in montana already had like 11 houses on it and we could have bought that thing and just started our own commune i mean church but where would the contact be no god intended for you to work next to that i'm sorry to say it to you this way but that man that's vulgar and that man that's obnoxious and that man that's slob and people say well i just can't even stand working in my office because the way people dress and people they act then you run into another brother and he's like oh here meet my friend i work with him oh and and his wife and oh another co-worker and um their friend and it's like wow this is where there's got to be a story here yeah i witnessed to him at work and he he told me that i had a devil but i just kept after him until the devil got tired of pushing me off and finally the devil got tired of pushing me off he actually listened to me and then he was like that's in the bible he gave his heart to the lord and then his wife saw him change from a drunk womanizer and said there's got to be something here and she got saved and then this other co-worker said what happened to you dude what is it the salt's coming in contact imagine that people think you're weird when you communicate with the tatted up waitress or waiter people think that you've went out too far when you act like these people are normal until they see him on the church pew because the salt has to have contact and when we lose look at this now when we lose our influence as a father as a mother as a christian as a businessman as oh ouch a minister do you realize saints if you come to grace tabernacle because you feel obligated because you don't like the ministry the prophet of god said if you can't respect the man respect the office that's it i don't like to go to church when brother so-and-so preaches i'm not talking about the brothers here i'm making a point you dig into that you'll find at some point in time there's some bone of contention amen there's some time that they have been shamed insulted cast down spoke ill love and then people wonder why don't they like that minister but if that minister ever loses his influence with the people that's right he'll probably really struggle to ever gain it back that's why it's important you say brother paul i had i had somebody no names here but i had somebody say bro paul you're too transparent and i'll tell you right now i am but i can't change because i would rather you saw my flaw and saw me doing my best to deal with that by the word than to see a man that takes every little flaw in height it's just the way i am hopefully it'll work for you because you see i would value my influence more than my reputation as it were to be proud of did that all make sense as a minister we lose our influence with the people now we can be very popular in the line of the world and go along with the world but i mean as what we represent i'm not just paul haley i'm not just a farmer i'm not just a husband i'm not just a father a grandfather i am the representation of jesus christ can we say amen tonight we are the repute representation well maybe it would be safe to say we are the reputation of jesus christ amen yeah it's what we represent christ and when we lose our influences that is standing out how can we blend in with the day when god is so against the day yeah look at that people are saying well we're just trying to reach out so so people will come so our young people understand my brother and sister look our young people don't need to feel comfortable in laodicea young people i hope you forgive me for taking that position you don't need to feel comfortable young ladies in laodicea you don't need to be if you're in public school fit in they're anointed by a lot of spirits there and a lot of things that the word of god is against and we don't need to be comfortable with that nor do we need to be ashamed that we're different that's right now look how brother brown ties this on he said how could machetes say go on up and prosper my vision is right with yours when he knowed that god had cursed that evil people his vision had to be contrary and a man's vision today that could go with the trend of the world and still remain a minister there is something wrong with the man's vision you know what god said about his rich laodicean church put him on the outside we cannot stand with the popular belief and vote of the day we've got to be against that thing now i want to throw this in here i've got just a little bit more to go can i have it no just a i just watched this video um and and this man i didn't even catch what religion what background or nothing but his words were powerful he said when you see these modern day ministers in their ragged t-shirts they're skinny jeans with holes in the knees wearing flip-flops and their weird fritz haircuts in the pulpit he said that's all the farther farther you need to look to see their level of respect for god wow wow i mean there it is they're dressing their fashions they're fitting right in with the latest deal even one of them i recently seen a little clip this guy four or five necklaces oh and this one right here and he peels it out i got from a whatever something buddhist whatever that i prayed for in the airport and he blessed this necklace you're cute buddy the world i come from girls wear necklaces did i say that loud enough young men amen it's only an opinion but it's my opinion and you're going to hear it again girls wear necklaces and then not even to look like a closed horse well look it up see what the prophet of god said about he dealt with it yeah he said those things ought to be more like a personal thing something between say you and a husband or something like that we're not to be closed horses made me think of something i'd get shot for speaking that out loud amen hallelujah look we got to go the prophet of god says we've got to go against this. now look here i want i want to just hurry here amen that seems like a paradox for me to say that isn't it now i want to just paint a very quick picture if the lord allow me the blessings didn't you love brother abel's service amen the benefits of serving god amen i've got a god that serves he's got benefits hallelujah now look at this she said unto the men now this is joshua 2 9 amen we know what's happening right here she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land now she's just speaking to a couple spies just a couple guys you know that israel didn't care about their life they just randomly chose them no no that's not what the prophet of god said about them they were hand-picked men of god this is rahab here i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you she's given an honest testimony we're hearing we're seeing the supernatural for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you and come out of egypt and you did unto the two kings of the amorites and that were on the other side jordan shaihan and og whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt she's speaking for a whole kingdom one little woman speaking for a whole kingdom now if one little woman under that anointing could speak for a whole wicked kingdom what could a daughter of god do to speak for the kingdom of god in her right place in her right position oh you know sisters hey now's my time i can speak of the things of god i can speak of a position that i've been given to speak from amen isn't that beautiful so she's there she's not out of order saints that's the point i'm trying to make she's not out of order god ordained her to testify of the condition of this kingdom what did the two kings as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath i say amen to that now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness into my father's house and give me a true token that you will save a lie my father my mother my brethren my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death she didn't leave anything else she didn't say well you know my my one brother he's he's messed up he probably can leave him out what was she doing by anointing preemptively placing the token over her house she herself a harlot by revelation placing the token over her house wow that you will save a lot of my father mother brother and sisters all that they have deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours once you have been baptized and faithful in church for six months and once you have signed off on our creed why is it that man's always got to put the little caveat on the end [Music] yeah our life for yours you talk about being anointed if you utter not this is our business do you realize god was conducting business people act like business is bad god's conducting business he's got two anointed men who are down there on a business trip you probably never thought about it that way before did you just on a business trip we're down here to do business and if you don't tell anybody about our business huh okay amen our life for years he utter not this is our business and it shall be when the lord had given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee you know they'd pay a great reward she turned them in 1 800 number she could have lived comfortably the rest of her life on that after all she's just rahab the harlot but rahab the harlot had a hunger and a thirst and ray have the harlot young ladies young man i'm sorry to speak kind of strongly here rahab the harlot from rich to poor had tried to satisfy that hunger and rahab the harlot heard that jesus christ was the same yesterday today and forever and something in her heart stirred now wicked and carnal minds say well how did these two men end up at rahab's house i'll give you a glimpse studies have shown in 500 people you put an abuser and the abused in the same room and they will find each other i take that research and put it on a spiritual level you put them 500 people in that room and two believers will find each other they didn't need to have a lookout they didn't need a road map rahab didn't need some inside traitor secret the holy ghost led them to rahab and the holy ghost led rahab to them oh me oh my oh how could this be you mean the holy ghost will actually lead us and guide us into all truth my people oh saints i'm sorry i'm going to say this it's kind of strong but people in this message have got so carnal so carnal they're they're dependent upon this little action they're dependent on this little action i say let's depend on getting
