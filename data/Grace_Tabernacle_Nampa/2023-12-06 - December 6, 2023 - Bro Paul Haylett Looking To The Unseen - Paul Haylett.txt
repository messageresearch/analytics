and Glory To Thee amen amen thank you brother David you may be seated God bless you once again those joining on the internet hope you're blessed today let's um sing shine on me I'm just trying to think of some songs that we all will [Music] know it's an sing that an F Shine On Me Lord shine on me let the light from the liouse Shine On Me Shine On Me Lord shine on me let the light from the lighthouse shine on me oh Shine On Me Lord shine on me let the light from the lighthouse shine on me oh Shine On Me Lord shine on me let the light from the ligh housee shine on [Music] me amen see

touch my heart like you to I could search for all etern Lord and there is none like you amen I believe we can just say a hearty Amen to that Amen to know that he is everything we have ever needed amen you know uh the world is an interesting place new ideas new Concepts new things always coming forth and and Mankind gets so into looking for something new but here's our lord Jesus right here in front of us amen the same yesterday today forever I can get up in the morning and know that if I was in his favor and his love last night I'm in his favor and his love this morning I I don't have to just hope that today will turn out to be so right that I I can please him once again but to know that we can walk and I just like to speak Along on this thought today you know I got to thinking how ironic this is because sometimes when you uh I give a little sympathy to Brother David to brother Chris that when you haven't been in the Pulpit for a bit it seems like maybe what you're preaching on is so old and so untouched but the word is fresh every day right we have fresh Mana amen and and God is good and I'd been preaching on what is your vision and I want to just take along in that thought tonight uh looking to the Unseen and uh if we'll turn in Revelations 22 1-1 and uh praise the lord we prayed for you brother vile but here you are amen and we had a prayer request for you sister April but here you are amen and we're just happy for each and everyone uh and uh you know God is good um and uh as the song says he's good all the time am uh so so we just uh thank the Lord for that I want to draw a little thought through Revelations 22 1-1 and then verse 17 and he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river there and was there the Tree of Life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and no need no candle and they need no candle neither the light of the Sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever and I just have a little caption in my sideline right here because I personally and I want to put it that way so that it's not confusing I personally believe that even when we are there in his presence revelation will continue to come I believe it won't be a revelation as it were that we would say oh I now see this scripture and that scripture but it the Revelation as it would be of a a solid a real marriage that I remember a a man one time that I knew not really a Christian but he'd been married for uh about the time of brother Bob and sister Joanne and he had quite a sense of humor and he says you know every day she surprises me and um I I think that's going to be kind of a little bit if you don't mind me putting it in that way what it would be like when we are in the presence of the Lord every day is going to be a glorious day it's going to be a day that we get to see another side of our Lord and and uh I I just think it'll be wonderful I don't think we're going to sit back and say man you know this Heaven is just kind of getting old now it's going to be new it's going to be exciting it's going to be refreshing to our souls and and uh I I wrote it here as an eternal Revelation and that we see each day a little more of our Lord Jesus and he said unto me these things are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I have to admit I've been really caught up in Prophecy lately right it's just something that just captivated my attention and um going to keep the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand I hope you catch that amen God's declaring in this day that this word was to be fulfilled do not seal the book back up amen it is open to his bride it's open to his people amen and and a very clear saying amen for the time is at hand amen meaning this is a time for these things to come to pass and I say Amen to that and that he is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely amen we thank you Lord for your word tonight just ask you to speak to our hearts Lord make it real as it has stirred our hearts today father let it stir our hearts once again this evening we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know for Generations people uh looked at the word of God and and come to many conclusions they come to many ideas they had many thoughts that they expressed and in fact we could put it this way that whole religions have been founded on a single man's ideas of the word of God or in some religions a single woman's ideas of the word of God and it's amazing to me that if there is no scripture Foundation that something like that could exist but yet my brothers and sisters the word is declaring that it must come to pass these are the signs of the end times and so it is that everything that would be out of kelter of the word now you can't hardly really imagine and and I I want to put it this way tonight I I hope you don't mind me speaking it like this but I I think we're slightly prejudiced of the in the word because we have come and God has opened our eyes given us Foundation to build this on and we look around and literally I'm guilty of this saying why can't they see it it seems to us to be so clear so present right in front of them and and you get into this and if we aren't careful we'll get into a position that we somehow believe these people are inferior or lack something but we need to continually walk in the grace of God for he's the one that's given this Revelation to us he's the one who's brought this alive it was not us it was not our ability our intelligence it wasn't our spiritual or sacrifice it was him alone it was the gift of God given to us and so if we're not careful we start to say now why can't these people you see that sometimes that people come so far in the message and then just stop right there and we can't understand why did you stop and and they are at the limit of their Revelation but we should never look down on that because God gave Revelation to us at some stage of our life and in that Revelation my brother and sister it allowed us or give us ability to an understanding which meaning Revelation to move on and you know don't believe it's at the end for them amen just pray that the continuation comes to them of the revelation of Jesus Christ and as we come because we know that true revelation can only come from God Amen it cannot be preached from the pulpit many times I have experienced this where people say explain that to me if you believe this or this explain it my brother and sister you could explain it but without Revelation it's just more word words that have come from the page and you know that is what they already have so you can't give them more than what they already have so because you're not giving them more than they already have they don't even understand where you're coming from and so they say well we've got what you've got but we realize by Revelation this opening continual opening of the word God is taking us further into him amen this is not even to say taking me into revelation of a message of the hour my brother and sister properly interpreted that is taking us into him Jesus Christ amen and so as we go into our our Lord Jesus amen the relationship becomes greater and greater I believe we can get an amen out of that and so it's there that uh uh the throne is there and life is there and Revelation is there and God is Distributing this in such a fashion my brother and sister to his bride now my brother and sister if God was just to give us a great Book of Revelation which he did in essence but if he gave us a great Book of Revelation without the timing and the understanding how to to apply it we would come up with all kinds of things amen if you ever had much experience about the trailer park in Arizona there was a great Revelation and these things were brought out but the people in the trailer park didn't know what to do with what had been given to them and much trouble come from that and so it is in our lives that if we do not have H you might say the experience in the character to deal with the power of God imagine the mess that we create with that and so God is leading his dear children along opening the word to us and sometimes we have great flashes of Revelation and times that it just the word opens up so strongly we were talking about this the other day you know I I believe that was brother Donnie Reagan one time I know it's happened to me I'm sure it's happened to brother Chris and Brother David that you'll actually be preaching on a thought and the light bulb turns on for you amen and you're like wow I never saw that in the word till this second and you know you were led to pick that scripture or that quote so we see how that the word is coming and unfolding and bringing itself and so as this comes the generations are open and you know it says there in verse one he showed me a pure River of Water of Life now my brother and sister I'm telling you we're talking about Vision we're seeing John testify that this was open to him showed to him this River of Life he was there I believe it would be safe to say because of the way that John frames this that he had never saw these things before so this is now Revelation coming to him and and he is Amazed by what he is seeing and it is there uh uh that that he is saying this River of Life clear as Crystal and it's coming from the Throne of God this can only be the pure word of God this can only be a pure message that is coming it is not a message of man now I want to ask you tonight has the Water of Life been revealed to you and I amen it is Flowing tonight my brother and sister by no measure of man's ability but the fact that God showed us the River of Life Is there and we see it and we know that we must drink of that water and it is revelation to us amen and I love that that it come from the Throne of God and not of man because the word of God tells us that whatever come from man will fail now I'm telling you we're sitting here tonight I'm going to speak a little blunt or at least I think it's kind of blunt my brother and sister except for the prophet of God has revealed that we cannot be deceived if left of our own device we would be deceived this is nothing less than God coming down and at the time that devil wants to H interpret the word to you God gives you another Clear Vision of the River of Life it's pouring out to us that we can see now I'm telling just paraphrasing a little this because I I didn't want to be too long tonight but the prophet of God says you know that it's there in that time that those Spirits would be so deceiving amen he's basing this right out of the word be so deceiving that it would deceive everyone except for God shortens the time and then the prophet turns around to balance this and says you can't be deceived because you are the word amen now which one of those paragraphs are we going to worry about you see what I'm saying oh if time is not shortened we're going to be deceived was he speaking to you no my brother and sister cu the word says that you are the word and you cannot be deceived because you are Christ in flesh and you are the Living Word the flaming fire of God is living in US amen so we don't walk out of here to flaunt that I can go kiss the girls I can do this I can do that no you don't do that because you truly have the fire of God which is purifying fire living in you so it's changed us we don't have the nature we don't have the desire we have the Life of Christ in us and we need to break my brother brother and sister those spirits that would try to tell us well I'm I'm afraid I'm not pleasing well my brother and sister I'll tell you how you just seal that forever just live the word we don't have to have a writing we don't have to have all kinds of stuff and it won't matter who we know H it doesn't matter who you know there's no name dropping in heaven all we have to do is live the word and as we are obedient to the word it is what is our protection it is also our Revelation if we're not in the word we're not going to find Revelation amen so it's come straight from the Throne of God not the mind of man and here I'm going to just step off a little bit give me a little liberty if you would tonight this says that this is clear as Crystal amen you know what the devil wants to do he wants to distract you and leave the question marks in your mind that who you are in Jesus Christ is not clear as crystal that's it but when Revelation comes to the bride of Christ and she starts to see who she is it starts to become so clear that we could literally say clear as Crystal who we are in Jesus Christ amen now those that are wavering back and forth my brother and sister sometimes it happens in stages of life for people but my brother and sister the deeper they get in the word the clearer it becomes and when this the revelation of Jesus Christ coming straight from the Throne of God to you and I ultimately it will bring us to a place that who we are in Jesus Christ and who he is in the framework of the church will be clear as Crystal we won't have to sit here in muddy water many time times all these different doctrines come out and what they do is they say well this is this and when it doesn't make sense to anyone they say well that's because it's for us and you just follow us but the bride of Christ my brother and sister was meant to step into the Revelation the bride herself has to Step Beyond the Veil and when she steps into that realm it's not a matter of how smart she is how much money she's got or this or that or wherever it come my brother brother and sister it just really drives me I'll just tell you bluntly it drives me crazy when I meet people in the message that are prejudiced how can you be prejudiced when the same Christ that's in you is in them amen the same blood that redeemed you redeem them but we still have racism as it were in the message people saying they don't have Revelation they're from this country this culture they don't have Revelation like we do my brother and sister I have to wonder what Revelation they're talking about cuz this Revelation covers the blood covers the sin of man amen whether he's short tall whether he's white dark whatever it might be it covers it and God didn't say I'm I got a place in heaven amen for you over here and I got a place in heaven for you and just to keep the bride from fighting we'll build a fence in the middle of Heaven nonsense amen so no model up Revelation amen God called us to see who we are clearly can we tonight just lift a hand maybe and say thank you Lord for making it very clear who I am I'm not here with question marks of whether I'm a Son of God or a daughter of God oh we make mistakes but God has been giving us the the the grace of God liberally my brother and sister he said it's sufficient so even in our mistakes that we make In the Flesh we need to have the Revelation that his grace is sufficient for our situation Amen to see the plan of God clearly now it's there that it says in that there'll be no curse look how this is placed right before us that there shall be no more curse now I know this can be a little convoluted I might not do the best job of explaining it but do you realize right now that while there is still a curse on the earth that came at the time of the garden that you as the bride of Christ are not living under a curse that's right amen you'd say but we still have to work by the sweat of our brow amen we still have to do these labors we still have all of these things that's the flesh man amen that is the outer man amen living in the outer court but when we get into the holiest of holies the prophet of God says there's no light days and dark days and this troubled day and that kind of day but when we get into that realm look how much Satan wants to keep us from that realm he distracts us here distracts us there throws this in front of us but I want to drive it home and I don't believe I'm off track here tonight you are not living under a curse amen the bride of Christ is not the curse amen she has found Liberty in Jesus Christ amen it's that Liberty let listen to me if you will that that is the Liberty that allows you to step between the lines of the word and recognize he's speaking to me amen amen I am who he is addressing and that is a revelation amen cuz anybody can go to church that's right amen that's right I'll just throw this in to distract you I read a story once about this guy that was some kind of a Ponzi investor scheme guy and he looked around the world and said where can I apply this Ponzi scheme with great success he just went and joined the biggest church in town fleeced them all what was it because church has been turned into business if he come and offered his Ponzi scheme and the men of the church or families of the church had been in the right position they'd have said get that out of the house of God don't even let that in the house of God this is not a place Jesus whipped them off for the porch of the church because they were doing business in church and yet we see it all the time people calling it they they well we're doing this and we're doing that and come invest in this and come give us money for that and you know let's be partnered up I'm the majority you're the minority I'll get most of the money you'll get a little bit and that's how it works my brother and sister but it should never be there we were called not to live under the curse of this age we're not called to live under the curse of Leo deia we're called to live in the presence of God to rise and into the heavenlies amen lifting up constantly into the heavenlies is what God has called us to do amen and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him Hallelujah I'm glad to be a servant amen I I I don't I don't need to be important I just need to be part amen I need to be part of what God is doing I don't need to do Amen to claim it now look look how Satan comes you know every time God does a mighty work moves on us you have just a wonderful time you know the devil always comes in behind that amen he's just he's got that whole Philistine uh program right down let him Rejoice let him get excited there's a crop coming the word is producing and then Satan comes in like a flood trying to do that but my brother and sister there's some saints that have picked up the ox goat of the word amen and they've picked up the horn amen and the Jawbone and all of these of the word now imagine as we go back through that my brother and sister an ox go was a wood stick with a brass knob on the end it was never designed to crush an inch thick brass helmet but it did an all rotten uh uh Jawbone laying there on the side of the road now my brother and sister we look at that and sometimes we'll get the idea how convenient for him to be right there and there is a Jawbone I'm telling you God let that donkey die right there as part of his plan amen maybe that donkey had been walking along just fine his master's happy and the thing just because God said it's got to be right here amen I I'm just preaching to you okay is that fine I don't have a quote to back it up but you look at that and realize see God ordained there to be a Jawbone God ordained there to be an ox Cod God ordained Gideon to come into the position right amen look we see it Gideon had been living around that rock forever and that was Christ right in his midst and he failed to recognize him but in the season that it was necessary for him to have that Revelation the fire come from The Rock and Gideon realized God's been here all the time amen oh I want to just say Amen to that he's been here all the time amen but look how Satan May afflict this flesh but I want to say once again this bride is not caught in the curse that's right she has Redemption she knows where she came from she knows where she's going she's not under the curse Hallelujah in fact to the bride of Christ we can make the statement the curse has been broken yes sir no longer applies Satan's still bluffing our problem is is on occasion we listen to his bluff and when we don't listen to his bluff his bluff has no power over us amen now looking to the Unseen sure wish that the screen worked tonight that's that's a little bit of disappointment brother Brown says here and looking to the Unseen uh 50 amen let's see August 16th 1950 this is not like our can goods it doesn't have an expiration date on it does it some people kind of act that way no I'm sorry the word of God Is Timeless am if this whole nation with one Accord would throw themselves to God in sackcloth and Ashes of repentance and come back to the oldfashioned pathways that our forefathers TR there couldn't be a bit of harm come to us amen wonder why all the chaos is in our nation people are popping up out of nowhere going into shopping malls shooting children and mothers and all this stuff is because we've forsaken God you can find this pattern in Israel all through scripture that's right wouldn't be a bit of harm come to us I believe it'd be worth more than all the ammunition plants and things that we could make that's right and all the bombs that we could have there's nothing as great as prayer god holds all the future in his hands and someone asked me not long ago brother brandham what do you think about the future he said I I do not know what the future holds but I know who holds the future so that's the thing if I can keep acquainted with him that's right now my brother and sister we all have had passing friendships in our life but how is it that some friendships endure because we don't let them pass isin't that true we meet people and and uh I I'll just speak this in this this context okay uh hopefully they're not listening or won't be listening I won't embarrass myself but you know we went to Florida and I've listened to brother Denny steeman preach Through The Years different sermons here and there and and you know we went to Florida uh um I I jokingly say that brother Barry's marriage seminar was our excuse to go visit Florida but it was a blessing to go there and and uh so we're there in Florida I get to meet brother Danny I get to visit with him and I realize this is a man that I can kind of relate to and uh you know we go home and I mentioned to Sister Jerry one day I said yeah I really liked brother Dany but hey you know how it is Sister Jerry's like call him well he doesn't know me I I I I was just somebody that talked to him for 30 minutes after church on a Wednesday night but I was intrigued because there was something in me desired to see if there was friendship there and I call him up and he's like oh brother Paul I remember you and when I invited him to preach Our Family Camp he didn't answer the phone so I left a voicemail brother Danny this is Brother Paul and IAH hoen I don't know if you remember me or not but we would like to invite you to speak our family again a little bit later 15 20 30 minutes phone rings I remember you amen now I'm speaking from a natural context and I hope you can put in place I'm working on a lasting friendship not just to invite a man to be the preacher that comes to our family camp and preach I I've decided I want to be friends with him now my brother and sister in passing for us to to be a friend as it were with Jesus Christ you got to talk to him once in a while you got to have a relationship with him and you got to cultivate that you can't just sit in your chair in the evening time watching the sunset and say you know God's going to come and talk to me talk to him that's right reach out to him let him know you're interested I I want this relationship I want this to be something real I want this to be something something that if you come Lord in years maybe maybe we'll be old as it is and and it's there that we're sitting there not looking back saying I would have liked to have that relationship I would have liked to have that friendship I wished I would have made that call to brother Danny you know 30 years ago or whatever it might be I wish it be but no my brother and sister let's do it we need the Lord in our life let's do it amen reach out to him no greater friend than man has ever had than our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so here it is he said but I know who holds the future and that's the thing if I can keep acquainted with him we have the ability to keep acquinted amen so then he found out talking uh about Ahab and all of them or whatever and and he says and I found out the prophet was in Israel he said go fetch him bring him to me and they went down and somebody told him that Elisha was in Dothan and and when they got down there to Dothan when they went in by night time and Camp around about in darkness you see how the enemy always works underhanded in dark that's right you know young people it's a lot of fun to when you get your own car and you get all these things to go around in the dark but remember there's all kinds of spirits out there in that dark and encamped around about the city to catch Elisha so when the young man his servant raised up early in the morning and went out in other words he was a fellow taking him in and out and around was his servant like and when he went out uh uh come he come back and said alas my master for the whole city is enced about by the spirit of leoda well that's not quite what it says it's on the back screen I don't know if y'all want to turn around look backwards and camped about with horses and Chariots of the enemy and he said why there's more uh with us than there is with them come on my brother and sister we ought to come to the place that becomes a mantra to us let that become something that reminds us when we're having a tough day to be able to stand and it seems like that all has broke loose around you to stop and say I believe the word of God and I'm going to quote the prophet Elisha who has come under the spirit of Elijah so his name might be Elisha but he really is Elijah's spirit and he says there's more with us than there is against us you need a little will power to resist remember amen there's more with you than there is against you and there is a lot against us my brother and sister that tells you how many are here for you amen it's not that we're overwhelmed amen we just need to learn how to do arithmetic amen you think there's a few thousand demons opposing you then realize that there's many more angels in your midst than there ever will be devils in your midst amen it's about time for us to do some of God's math amen and so uh it was there there's more with us than there is with them well he could see no one but Elisha Elisha prayed Lord open the young man's eyes that he may see I think that'd be a good prayer for us to be praying praying over our young people Lord open eyes amen maybe old people how about we just say people open our eyes Lord that we can see what you're doing amen amen there's so many people now across the land and I don't want to get distracted to this so many people starting to question that the the message is not as effective did it die out with the prophet did something go away my brother and sister the prophet told us this would no longer be a public display God is showing himself to his bride amen he's not going to walk the streets of these cities doing the miraculous that they believe he's called to do in their midst he's doing it for his bride amen he's a deliverer a provider amen the husband to the bride amen not walking through the neighborhood to show off but coming down in a personal way to deal and show us there is more with us than there is against us hallelujah and I believe God had answered this prayer today he says Lord open the young man's eyes that he may see and the Lord moved the veil amen oh sorry for getting excited tonight I'm going to stand here and tell you God was gracious enough to me he loved me enough cared for me enough to lift my veil amen amen nothing's going to lift that Veil but our Lord Jesus and I say tonight the veil has been lifted to this bride she is looking and she is seeing the supernatural God in her midst amen and the people that are saying well we think the message might have slipped or something was missed we believe it this far butt and we got this butt and we got that butt I'm telling you God's on the scene God's working he's still a Healer he's still a deliverers till a savior amen the blood is just as powerful tonight as it's ever been through the the ages whether it's a public display or not it's there and it's doing the work that was promised amen and he's moving a people into his presence amen amen and the Lord moved the veil before the young man and he looked and the whole Oh you mean that little circle of devils down there that seemed to be very tangible was nothing because the hills are covered amen with the present the angels of God Amen oh Lord I really I I'm telling you I really wouldn't mind having an actual uh uh manifestation of that in our lives that we would walk down the street uh have to go in the grocery store you know all of the different places it might be I don't want to get into that and all the things that you see and are influenced by if we could just look out amen but God said I want you to live by faith so I believe my brother and sister that the angels are there walking with us surrounding us because all I can see is Devils amen but he's here that's right and he's surrounding us he's protecting us he's leading us amen he said he would Amen Hallelujah Lord yes sir pull the veil back a little farther Lord amen so you know in that case sometimes we just maybe need to stop and say Lord open my eyes that's it open my eyes amen and he looked in the whole hills and mountains were full of Chariots of Fire standing around the old that old Prophet well he wasn't afraid then see this is what bothers me Saints if I could be honest for just a moment when I hear people in this message talk about their fear of the economy and their fear of what's Happening Here a fear of atomic bombs I personally think there's something missing in the relationship because God when he opened our eyes to the word revealed word right took our fear with it amen amen we're not to sit here come what may my brother and sister we're not to set here under a spirit of fear but God has given us a sound mind and I'm going to Define sound mind for you tonight if you don't mind a sound mind is a mind that reads the word of God and says my God met me right here and this is what the word said it would produce and I'm going to look around and be able to say here it is my eyes have been opened no longer under the spirit of fear that's right amen that's right and I don't mean that I'm trying to criticize these people don't misunderstand me tonight but there's something wrong when we're consumed by fear maybe God would reveal that in such a fashion no condemnation involved but simply a fact that we would look at and say okay Lord I'm going to move in that direction Give Me Faith to kick this fear Spirit out hallelujah amen I'll tell you a little story from my past one time there was a kid that was was quite an act up rode our school bus and one day the bus driver said I've had enough she went back there not a very big lady she went back there and said get off the bus and he said I am not getting off the bus grabbed the hold of the back seats and he's this tall and she's this tall and he's got a hold of the seat and she he's like you can't make me and without him while he's doing his boasting act with his chest down out she reached around and unlocked the back door of the bus the door still closed but it's now unlocked that's right are you with me she stood back now she didn't say in the name of the school district she didn't say in the name of the bus superintendent she said I said I hope you're following me amen sometimes we want to put it this way well we got to put all these words with it but I want you to realize who author whose authority you are speaking in amen we don't have to give them a whole dictionary of this that and the other right seven sons of SAA we recognize we don't know you but we know them well let the devil know who we are amen and so she unlocks the door of that school busz and he doesn't realize it while he's all boastful and she's standing there and he's thinking how what she going to do and she just went and boom right out of the bus and on the ground and here's a whole Bus full of rebellious boys am I next you want to sedo the devil don't don't let him tell you I ain't leaving kick him out amen amen we have authority in the name of Jesus Christ we don't need to throw a bluff we have the word amen and the word will do the work for us if we'll give it a chance Hallelujah I remember that bus driver one time later in life I got a little carried away I think it had something to do with throwing a baloney sandwich from one end of the bus to the other she just looked up and said Paul you just used your last chance yes ma'am I don't know that a harle breathed until we got home what I didn't know is that bus driver knew my mother and about the time I made it home or got my chores done my mother knew all about it my brother and sister the devil can't touch you but what your father knows all about it we're not loners in this land we are the bride of Christ you want to take a real man and make him mad just say something or do something to his wife and then you'll see a real man become mad and we have a real father amen who cares about his children and he's not going to let the devil molest you amen amen hallelujah so as we look at this now I've got myself lost here uh we're fighting tonight here uh great Warfare fight against wrong the word of God against modern theology trying to make the word of God bring it to the people while the enemy would try to beset it in every way but one is a majority in God Amen do you realize tonight if we got Jesus Christ in US amen we're sitting here tonight when it comes to the devil we are the majority we're not just a singular Left Behind forgotten forsaken we are the majority in Jesus Christ amen and it's time for us to let the devil know that we are tired of getting kicked around or having him March through our house and leave his little trail of Destruction behind us now notice the point I want you to see is that Elijah the man who was of God called the man of God he did not look to the natural thing he looked to the supernatural amen he didn't look at what he seen he looked at what he did not see amen that's right now let's jump back for just a second that River of Life flowing out from the throne right now I look out this natural man yeah needs glasses to even you know Sister Jerry's like look at this across the kitchen and I'm like what do you got what is that this natural man cannot see that River of Life right but this spiritual man by God's grace sees that river flowing abut amen flowing right from the Throne of God clear as Crystal telling you I bought you I have paid for you you're my possession I hold title deed to you you are not only that but you're my bride yes sir oh I'll tell you my brother and sister it it there's so much I could preach like forever tonight on this subject amen but look at this amen he didn't look at what he seen otherwise he'd have seen exactly what gesi saw he's a prophet right but in the flesh if he had just looked with flesh eyes he would have only seen what ha I see and then he would have said we have a problem here Captain but he looked out with eyes of Revelation amen and those eyes of Revelation see the throne the River of Life coming from the throne and he realizes and he knows without a Shadow of Doubt God is with me amen now the prophet of God goes was on you know and he says about um how it might be another quote I don't remember here I dug through so many and put so many back on the Shelf but you know the prophet God talks about that you see when he he put that or did that he had the people that could see but couldn't see maybe I'll hold on to that I don't remember if I included that or not I had a little question for time now God wants us to be able to see the Unseen that's right I come across a qu quote that I I uh here again my brain's in a little fuddle forgive me I don't remember if I included it or not but I I just want to praise the Lord amen that he's let me see the Unseen yes sir that he's let me see what what even as much as it breaks my heart people in my own family can't see amen but God's let me see this and and it makes it seem a little weird to the world my brother and sister but I'm not looking at the world I'm looking to the Unseen which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen unseen as it is and uh you know so we get a look to the Unseen and look upon the past the curtain of natural time now brother brandham uh uh preached about uh you know going beyond the curtain he tells us about this but my brother and sister there's actually a curtain in the natural yes sir there is a curtain in the spiritual there is is a curtain in the natural and as it is you're going to have to get believe it or not you're going to have to get through the curtain of the natural just as much as you're going to have to get through the curtain of the spiritual and so in that realm we come to this place that once we part the curtain of natural Veil we step into the spiritual see if we never overcome the flesh we'll never see Christ that's right that's why dying to our is so important because if we don't get past this natural Veil we cannot get past the spiritual veil in the presence of God Amen that's why we have so many brother Brown says you know I'm just going to paraphrase this we got so many people to church we're proud of ourselves we got all these people to church but he said I'm afraid we're not getting them to Christ that's we' got them past a natural Veil into the house of God and they're sensing the supernatural they're sensing all of these things taking place but there's never been a change in them to get them through the veil into the spiritual so there you have intellectual Believers yeah that's right they're standing there with all kinds of influence from the message but no Spirit to back it up right amen so let me hurry along here amen you see my brother and sister to have a position of rest I'm paraphrasing and cutting some of this back the position of rest takes a spiritual man beyond the place of carnal men will ever see you want to know if you've come to arrest arrest is complete this I don't remember where I read this this is in hopefully you guys don't turn me off tonight this was in a writing about the psychology of man now not psychology in the sense that we often think of it but they're explaining there's two position for a man in the natural to sleep extreme fatigue or complete confidence of rest and he dated this back to the days that not your typical house cat but the saber-tooth tiger and he describes how these guys living in that world didn't just lay down anywhere and take a nap they had to have confidence cuz they wanted to wake up well I tell you what my brother and sister if God allows me to go to the Grave I want to have confidence I'm going to wake up and the only way I can come into that rest is to know that I'm in his presence CU without that we can go into the grave with no confidence of rising again or we can come to a place where we sleep with our fathers as it were and we can come to a place where we sleep not with fathers but with the father that's our rest that's our place where we can lay our life down with complete confidence and he will lift it up you know sometimes when you cut too much out of your sermon it leaves these weird little notches in there that nobody can figure out where you come from or where you were going I hope that made sense amen now brother Brown says 1949 uh July 18th 1949 I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision he says here and I was thinking that the natural man went out at the Unseen of his eye and pulled an adom down out of the sky and split that atam in two that destroys human life and if the natural man that knows nothing of God and cannot know nothing of God except he be converted and then his soul becomes alive with the supernatural if he could do that in the natural way what ought the man of God be doing my my friends the church is so far behind let's pray my that God will move his church up that the natural man with the natural resource is getting greater results than people that calls themselves Christian but what results are we looking at can you show me your heavenly passport that's a tricky question isn't it because you see we have no card we didn't receive anything in the mail that said you now been received your application has been accepted but there is an application yes sir and it is accepted yes sir he said that calls themselves Christian let's press into the Unseen the blessings are yours therefore for you now that tells us my brother and sister that this blessing if I could figurative put this out this blessing over here that we have looked at we have talked about we have fellowshipped around it it's time for us to step over and claim that I've shared this with the church before but let me give it just a brief little Glimpse in South America I have I I wanted to make a point to these young people they didn't seem to be catching what I was doing I didn't I I I had given sister Jerry my wallet and uh I asked her and she gave me some money out of the wallet US Dollars and I'm there who wants this every kid in the whole deal there was several hundred kids there they lift their hands nobody even moves who wants this there was a young man on the aisle about four or five rows back he he come up out of his seat and there was a boy on the outside few rows back actually stood up started to go forward and one of his friends you know says something in Spanish to him and he's like sits back down maybe he told him he's just preaching and I said come on doesn't anybody want this and hands went up everywhere finally that one boy jumped up he didn't even slow down long enough to let doubt and fear enter in he run up there and snatch that out of my hand and then he started going back and he's like turns and he's like I said you're going to give it back he said yeah yeah yes yes I I understand the example and I said whatat did I say who wants this that's it who wants this that's it come on who wants this that's it time for us to get out of our chair time to not to listen to your friend not to come here not go there and what's this opinion what's this Council what's the it's time for us to get as the Bride of Jesus Christ up out of our chair and go over and say this is my promise and I'm claiming it tonight I'm getting my hands on this promise and the little boy come to me after church and he said brother Paul he spoke English he said brother Paul seriously and I said I said I give and I'm not an Indian giver and he's like what's an Indian giver realize there's a little bit you have to you know and I said no an Indian giver is one who says I'll give it to you and at that point right there I thought I should have been preaching that God's not an Indian giver when he said I have a promise of eternal life you jump up and take a hold of that he's not going to come young people and ask for that back he's not going to say oh yeah that was just an example that was just a trying to convince you but God when he said I'll give you this gift I'll give you the Holy Ghost amen repent be baptized receive the Holy Ghost get a hold of it and don't let go cuz it's yours amen amen and the devil's there to say oh what this and say what that but that's not what God Said God said you do it I'll stand behind it and give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah forgive me for getting excited getting loud here amen if you could do that in the natural realm what ought the man of God be doing oh Lord help us amen we got something that makes nuclear power the Adam balb look like nothing amen hallelujah amen right Adam balb tear up the Earth my brother and sister change whole weather pattern change a whole deal Shake enough to break the rocks of the foundation of the mountains but it will not burn Heaven and Earth we serve a God that says there'll come a time amen but I'm not going to be here you're not going to be here praise God can somebody say thank you Lord hallelujah amen Now 1 Corinthians 13:12 what time is it we're almost almost there 1 Corinthians 13:12 for now we see through a glass Darkly isn't that the truth we're looking at all these promises of God and they've been just kind of out there been promised to them we don't see the clarity of it and we're trying to figure out how this applies to us and which way it is for now we see through glass Darkly but then oh Hallelujah God didn't stop with hey Jesus died to save me he stopped amen when he had completely claimed his bride well he didn't even stop then did he Brother David no sir because he took her on a honeymoon amen he took her home he didn't stop just when he got her amen that'd be awkward wouldn't it well I married you amen I'll come over to your parents house and visit you this week no no no no it doesn't work that way amen hallelujah I don't want to get sidetracked I just had a couple thoughts like whoa hey look at that but what happened veil was lifted right to spiritual vision yeah not for us to debate the message not for us to debate who's in who's out what's this and what's that my brother and sister I was just talking with a man amen uh kind of On The Fringe of the message I was just talking with him and I just laid it out I just felt so bold it was almost scary I just laid it out to him I said look this is how it is it's not between you and them and them and them has there been rotten preachers in the message I thought I'd hear an aen is that going to stop this bride from going no sir amen all the nickan all the deceivers all the wolves and sheep's clothing my brother and sister none of that is going to stop this bride she's going to take all of the word and the word said I'm here to deliver you and she believes the word amen so there can be a whole world full of deceiving Wolves Out Here dressed up any way they want saying they have Revelation and anointing and a word from the Lord and if that word don't line up with God's word then we know right where they're at and we're done with that amen hallelujah it's time for this bride to have this kind of confidence that the word is anchored in our soul wait wait wait let me take a little snippet for a DNA sample you are the word amen amen you're not just in the word you're not just around the word you're not just hearing the word you are the word amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah you know lift the veil even further Lord that's what I would ask don't let there even be one thing that's right hidden from this bride that's right Hallelujah now look let me move forward here in the message 19571 I'm finding some real nuggets in these old sermons amen prophet of God says in the sermon Ministry explained he said and now you go you ought to go and look these up yourself amen uh and read the whole context imagine how long a service would be if we read all the Prelude and the following of every one of these thoughts then when you accept it comma right space of time when you accept it a space you believe it and somebody say let's see if you look any different sister Betty retif brother bram's coming Johannesburg South Africa they're going to meet brother brandham they've heard about his ministry they have those that they know that have experienced that and they are so excited to meet brother brandham sister Betty goes gets her hair trimmed and permed and all done you know manicure everything is just fine going to meet brother brandham they sat there in a service that night and brother brandham preaches and she's sitting there going Lord forgive me that very day she had her haircut and Revelation penetrated everything down into her soul and she is sitting there almost ashamed afterwards because they have this appointment or this scheduled time to meet brother brandom and she's ashamed to come in his presence and they know more than come together and she says brother brandom and she pours her story out and brother brandham said sister Betty when your hair finally gets down below your shoulders and stuff God will hear your prayer gets out the car and walks off you know what he says he said the minute sister Betty you received the word god looked at you as though your hair that's it was long right and flowing that's exactly right she told this to Sister Jerry and I face to face this not a second or third hand kind of story and she said I never even was even a thought to ever do something to my hair after that yes sir and she said my heart trembled at the grace of God Amen that the moment she believed in God's eyes it was so oh my my brother and sister I think it's time for us maybe to start maybe even vocalizing if we need to I believe Lord amen not just words to satisfy man but from the soul to say Lord I believe amen I believe amen amen now look at this I got to hurry along here then we accept it you believe it and somebody said well let's see if you look any different why you still got brown eyes you still got the same as you was you can't show nothing that you are saved only your testifying of the Unseen amen what is it we see can I say Amen to that can you say Amen to that we the world might not see but when we have received that and been anointed by the Holy Ghost we see amen we know the difference you can't show that you're saved only testifying of the Unseen your faith says you're saved then you what you do you believe you're saved amen and then you say you're saved and then you act like you're saved and then you associate with those that are saved that's right and it works righteousness ain't that right and after a while everybody knows that you're saved hallelujah amen but it all starts with us just simply believing that's it amen hallelujah we'll just stop right here sister be if you'll come hallelujah amen Oh by God's grace my I'm sure glad we're not going by our vision that's right because I tell you what just give you an example in the natural I come home from work this evening afternoon however you want to call it or whatever it was today maybe it was lunchtime Jerry just is kind of like it was lunchtime and I'm thinking I got food on my face and she's like then she said your mascara is slipping you got to understand what kind of girl I'm married to but you see I had grease and dirt on my face I can't see it I hope you follow my analogy I can't see it without it being revealed to me that's right I don't know what I look like that's it but by God's grace our vision is opened up and we don't see a filthy character we see Sons and Daughters of God we're seeing the redeemed of the Lord amen amen praise the Lord God bless you tonight Saints amen I I had some songs here I'm not sure I guess I will have words I was just thinking we ought to stand and just sing the song he's in the house amen amen I believe he's in this house right here this natural house called Grace Tabernacle but he's in this house and all I can say is is thank you Lord you're in this house and that's what matters amen the rest of the house so to speak can look pretty rough as it is you know but when God's in the house he changes it quote I read you the other day brother brandham says you know we're not trying to work from the outside in he's working from the inside out amen do we know the song well enough to sing it [Music] Saints girl was lying there a people all were we they just laughed at Jesus when he said she's only sleeping as he took her by the hand she began to live again some began to praise the Lord some began to sing he's in the house oh death has to flee now there is life where Darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more doubt praise His name praise His name he's in the house we were like that little girl dead in all our sin Jesus touched This Heart of mine and gave me life again I am just a house of clay every sing that blessed day there's a light that shines on me for all the world to see that he's in the house death has to flee now there is life where Darkness used to be now there is hope
