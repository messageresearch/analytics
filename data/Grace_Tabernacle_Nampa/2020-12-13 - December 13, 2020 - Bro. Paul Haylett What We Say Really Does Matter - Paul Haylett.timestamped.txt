[49:22] amen you
[49:24] know it's so wonderful to to know that
[49:27] we've been
[49:28] called Amen to just try to be a follower
[49:34] remember when Israel left out of Egypt
[49:39] as they departed from Goan the scripture
[49:42] tells us they were a mixed
[49:44] multitude see some went because they
[49:48] wanted a change in their
[49:50] life but they weren't really
[49:53] called and those that are called can
[49:56] endure this test of time and those that
[49:59] just follow will not and I say thank you
[50:03] Lord that we're
[50:04] called because this test of time is a
[50:09] tremendously difficult
[50:11] test um everything that we
[50:15] do everything that we believe the
[50:18] scripture says must be
[50:20] tested and when it comes into the fire
[50:23] it's only those that are called
[50:26] have the endurance to go through that
[50:29] kind of test right I thank you Lord for
[50:33] your calling for your gift this morning
[50:36] I just want to bring greetings to you
[50:37] from Brother Rich Cobb there in Monmouth
[50:40] Oregon uh and his family uh they just uh
[50:46] want you to uh know that they love you
[50:48] and they're looking forward uh to
[50:51] someday soon coming back to see us and I
[50:55] I will definitely encourage you on that
[50:58] amen um brother rich brought something
[51:00] to my attention that I wasn't aware of
[51:03] and uh up in Sandpoint or cordelane area
[51:06] there is the little group of Believers
[51:09] you all know brother Roar and sister
[51:10] Mona and their boys and uh their family
[51:14] uh it would be sister Mona's brother
[51:17] Moses wol has um got a tumor on his
[51:22] kidney and the doctors say the only way
[51:24] to treat it whatever it is is to remove
[51:26] his kidney and that surgery is to take
[51:28] place sometime in the next few days and
[51:31] so we just ask for your prayers for
[51:34] brother Moses God would just come down
[51:37] on the scene we would actually prefer
[51:39] just to see him heal
[51:41] amen but if it goes to that then we pray
[51:45] that God would just bless the hand of
[51:47] the surgeon to uh the the surgery to to
[51:51] uh go smoothly so if you'll just
[51:53] remember them we certainly would
[51:55] appreciate that
[51:57] amen I want to speak to you today just a
[52:00] little shift uh in uh what we've been
[52:03] preaching on we haven't even really
[52:06] touched on those things when we're
[52:07] talking about being sold out to God but
[52:10] we'll make a little shift here after the
[52:12] new year and we'll talk about those that
[52:14] are sold out on the other side for a
[52:16] brief time and uh then we'll move into
[52:19] the make believer then we'll go on uh
[52:22] into the parts that are really important
[52:24] to us now my brother and S sister if we
[52:27] ever lose our compassion for the
[52:30] unsaved then we have lost it all right
[52:35] we we need to continue hold it upon your
[52:37] heart upon your mind that you need to
[52:40] Foster that atmosphere that it's not
[52:44] well those poor people out there but you
[52:47] need to Foster the attitude that we
[52:49] don't know who the last one is and you
[52:51] might be talking to them at work at
[52:54] their grocery store across the sidewalk
[52:58] and so foster that attitude that we want
[53:00] to just present Christ a loving Christ
[53:05] anyone can get up and present Christ in
[53:09] judgment but to present him in true love
[53:13] amen let that be the burden of our heart
[53:16] I want to speak to you today on the
[53:18] topic or the subject of what we say
[53:21] really does matter amen and we'll just
[53:26] draw this out of Matthew the 15th
[53:28] chapter starting with verse 21 thank you
[53:31] sister Ruth brother Chris
[53:34] amen uh just
[53:37] uh take a few moments today to to um
[53:43] present uh this thought and by God's
[53:46] grace uh Brothers there is a uh input
[53:49] select in the middle of my screen so I
[53:52] can't see
[53:54] anything Hallelujah
[53:57] there's an input select in the middle of
[53:59] my screen where I can't
[54:02] read so as we look at this today amen I
[54:08] don't know I don't know what to do with
[54:09] it here can I just push exit exit
[54:12] doesn't work amen so as we look at this
[54:16] today we want to just draw this thought
[54:18] out of Matthew 15 and and as we'll look
[54:21] at this we just want to um take the um
[54:25] uh thought as it were to today and and
[54:29] just let it be broadened to us let's not
[54:31] stay in a little narrow Focus but let us
[54:34] be broadened that that we could take and
[54:37] grasp the whole picture of what God is
[54:40] presenting to us and so we will um just
[54:43] turn now in our Bibles and and uh we'll
[54:47] just uh oh there we go you got to love
[54:50] technology and you got to love the
[54:51] people that understand technology amen
[54:55] and uh cuz I'm not one of
[54:57] them but please love
[55:00] me then Jesus went then and departed to
[55:04] the coast of Ty and sedon and behold a
[55:06] woman of Canaan come out of the same
[55:08] coast and Cried unto him saying have
[55:12] mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my
[55:16] daughter is grievously vexed with a
[55:18] devil but he answered her not a word and
[55:21] his disciples came and besought him
[55:23] saying send her away
[55:26] she's really disturbing our
[55:28] service she's really discouraging to us
[55:31] with all of her
[55:35] crying send her away for she crith after
[55:39] us but he answered and said I am not
[55:41] sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[55:44] House of Israel then came she and
[55:48] worshiped
[55:51] him yes saying Lord help me but he
[55:55] answered and said it is not meat to take
[55:57] the children's bread and to cast it to
[56:02] dogs and she got angry
[56:05] no got in her car and peeled out and
[56:08] drove
[56:10] away and she said truth
[56:13] Lord I recognize the truth prise the
[56:17] Lord you didn't come in that context to
[56:23] me oh Hallelujah
[56:26] yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
[56:28] fall from their master's table then
[56:31] Jesus answered and said into her oh
[56:34] woman great is thy faith be it unto thee
[56:39] even as thou Wilt so he just granted to
[56:42] her the complete desire of her
[56:47] heart and her daughter was made whole
[56:49] from that very hour amen Heavenly Father
[56:52] we just ask for your guiding hand Lord
[56:54] for your blessings in this service today
[56:56] Lord speak to us we pray in your
[56:58] precious name amen amen you may be
[57:02] seated you know whenever I look at this
[57:04] scripture I I'm always
[57:06] amazed how my brother and sister that
[57:10] when God moves when God works we find
[57:16] that when he calls a son or daughter of
[57:19] God that calling is so
[57:23] strong that it would break every
[57:26] Bond every chain that would bind that
[57:30] individual would be completely loosed
[57:34] Torn Free ripped out because nothing can
[57:38] keep a son or a daughter of God from the
[57:40] word of God and so often times uh we'll
[57:44] see here as we'll just uh uh look often
[57:47] times you know we see uh an event take
[57:50] place and um we see it just a little bit
[57:53] different so I want to just here and
[57:56] we'll find the the great similarities
[57:59] but I want to come and look into the
[58:01] Book of Mark now and so this is how Mark
[58:04] records this event in scripture and from
[58:08] thence he arose and went unto the
[58:09] borders of Ty and sedon and entered into
[58:12] a
[58:13] house and would have no man know it but
[58:16] he could not be
[58:17] hid for a certain woman whose young
[58:21] daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of
[58:23] him and came and fell at his feet the
[58:26] woman was a Greek a Sy phenician by
[58:29] nation and she B besought him that he
[58:32] would cast forth the devil out of her
[58:35] daughter but Jesus said unto her let the
[58:38] children first be filled for it is not
[58:41] meat to take the children's bread and to
[58:43] cast it unto the
[58:45] dogs and she answered and said unto him
[58:48] yes Lord yet the dogs under the table
[58:51] eat of the children's
[58:54] crumbs and he said unto to her for this
[58:57] saying go thy way the devil has gone out
[59:01] of thy daughter and when she was come to
[59:03] her house she found the devil gone out
[59:05] and her daughter laid upon the bed it is
[59:08] out of this passion of portion of
[59:11] scripture uh that I have drawn my
[59:14] thought or
[59:17] uh title today you see he declares unto
[59:23] her it's because of this saying right
[59:26] it wasn't something that was held down
[59:29] in her heart but she come and she spoke
[59:32] it out she acknowledged she knew that he
[59:36] was
[59:37] God she recognized by
[59:41] Revelation but she my brother and sister
[59:44] if I could lay this out carefully this
[59:47] morning you see when God calls
[59:50] you wait I already mentioned that didn't
[59:52] I when God calls you there will will be
[59:56] nothing keep you from coming to the
[1:00:00] word you will have struggles you will
[1:00:02] have what we would call failures you
[1:00:04] will have difficult times you'll have
[1:00:07] maybe children that are possessed of an
[1:00:10] unclean
[1:00:11] Spirit but those that are called
[1:00:13] recognize the word of God and so it's
[1:00:16] here that this
[1:00:19] woman knowing that there is a need
[1:00:21] knowing that her situation is dire she
[1:00:25] comes she needed a
[1:00:27] remedy and uh I would say that this
[1:00:30] morning my brother and sister she had a
[1:00:33] revelation where to find the remedy it
[1:00:36] wasn't that someone had said hey there's
[1:00:38] some religious guy over here speaking
[1:00:41] and things are happening you see God
[1:00:43] placed the need in her and the desire in
[1:00:47] her and then he gives Direction he said
[1:00:50] for I will be with you even in you even
[1:00:54] in you
[1:00:56] you don't have to guide yourself you
[1:00:59] have to let go and let God guide you and
[1:01:03] so in this we see she was anointed to be
[1:01:06] led right to our lord Jesus she was
[1:01:09] anointed to come and behold she has a
[1:01:12] revelation that he doesn't have to come
[1:01:15] he doesn't have to lay hands on her he
[1:01:17] doesn't even have to enter in the house
[1:01:19] she's looking for a
[1:01:21] word oh praise the Lord we've got word
[1:01:24] we've got the word my brother and sister
[1:01:26] we don't we don't have to have as it
[1:01:28] were some man come to the house we don't
[1:01:30] have as it were to to to have some great
[1:01:33] event take place we just need to get to
[1:01:36] the word and the word will be the answer
[1:01:39] to our
[1:01:40] situation and so as we'll see this we
[1:01:43] find that she is there and and uh you
[1:01:46] might if you want to take it in a a more
[1:01:48] abrupt method you would say that our
[1:01:51] lord Jesus uh uh insulted
[1:01:54] her but you see she had a need and there
[1:01:57] was nothing nothing nothing did I say
[1:02:01] nothing going to drive her away from
[1:02:04] having that need
[1:02:05] fulfilled she wasn't going to say well I
[1:02:08] guess if he's going to call me a dog
[1:02:11] then I will just leave here because I am
[1:02:13] not a dog but she caught the Revelation
[1:02:16] I hope you get this this morning she had
[1:02:18] caught a revelation he wasn't really
[1:02:21] talking about her he was talking about
[1:02:23] the fact that she as a gentile the word
[1:02:26] was not sent to her but she come with
[1:02:30] great faith and said I know the word
[1:02:32] when I see it I know the word when I
[1:02:36] hear it I know the word when I'm in its
[1:02:39] presence and you're not going to send me
[1:02:41] away because even the dogs get the
[1:02:44] crumbs from the children's
[1:02:46] table that's right amen and our lord
[1:02:49] Jesus in Matthew records it as because
[1:02:52] of her faith but in mark it it is
[1:02:56] because of the words that you have
[1:03:00] spoken would that be two different
[1:03:03] statements no no it was her faith
[1:03:08] expressed in words amen amen that's she
[1:03:12] didn't just hold Faith down in her heart
[1:03:14] and say my daughter will be healed my
[1:03:15] daughter will be healed she was there
[1:03:17] and she put her faith not only into
[1:03:19] action she's there before Jesus crying
[1:03:22] out but she put her faith into words and
[1:03:26] expressed it and said I may be a dog but
[1:03:29] this crumb here is worthy these Crumbs
[1:03:33] are worthy for us for me to be able to
[1:03:37] sh and Jesus then says for your
[1:03:41] words for what you have
[1:03:44] said let me give it in the exact words
[1:03:47] for this saying go thy way amen the
[1:03:51] devil has gone out of thy daughter amen
[1:03:54] hallelujah oh my brother and sister I
[1:03:56] want to just reiterate this she needed a
[1:04:00] remedy she had a revelation where to
[1:04:02] find it that's right right and we are
[1:04:05] here in the hour we're living in my
[1:04:06] brother and sister the scripture tells
[1:04:08] us that everything that will befall the
[1:04:11] world will befall
[1:04:12] you you be rich you be poor you be hot
[1:04:16] or
[1:04:18] cold you have sickness you have
[1:04:21] health all of these things see we don't
[1:04:24] have a blanket exemption where the bride
[1:04:26] of Christ we'll never get the sniffles
[1:04:29] sister Jerry and I was just discussing
[1:04:31] this just a little bit and you know it's
[1:04:33] kind of interesting Saints you know I
[1:04:35] had held in my heart uh that uh Lord
[1:04:38] just let our church let Grace Tabernacle
[1:04:40] the uh the Believers here let us just
[1:04:43] pass through this pandemic without the
[1:04:45] co I've spoke this from the pulpit
[1:04:47] before let us just pass through without
[1:04:49] the pandemic touching us but then it
[1:04:52] comes and it comes in a full force yeah
[1:04:56] but my brother and sister God took us
[1:04:58] through the fire brought us out on the
[1:05:01] other side
[1:05:04] healthy so then it become irrelevant
[1:05:06] whether you had the co or not because
[1:05:10] you had the remedy the Lord hallelujah I
[1:05:14] tell you I'd rather not hide from the
[1:05:17] issue I would rather have the remedy
[1:05:21] amen now brother brandham says here in
[1:05:24] the patmas vision
[1:05:26] he says there is a cry in all hearts for
[1:05:29] that
[1:05:31] rest but the majority don't know the
[1:05:33] answer so they try to steal the Cry by a
[1:05:37] religious process of keeping certain
[1:05:40] days or accepting denominational Creeds
[1:05:43] and dogmas but failing in that many try
[1:05:47] drinking and carousing and every
[1:05:49] physical excess thinking that by worldly
[1:05:53] pleasures there can be some satisfaction
[1:05:56] but as such there is no rest I think
[1:05:59] some of us can say Amen we know this the
[1:06:02] truth this isn't just words on a on a
[1:06:04] screen that this is words to us they
[1:06:07] smoke and take pills to quiet their
[1:06:09] nerves but there is no rest in Earthly
[1:06:13] potions they need Jesus they need the
[1:06:17] Heavenly remedy the rest of the
[1:06:24] spirit I say Amen to that amen
[1:06:28] amen then the most of them go to church
[1:06:30] on Sunday see now they're trying to find
[1:06:32] the
[1:06:33] remedy they go to church on Sunday that
[1:06:36] is good but even there they have no idea
[1:06:38] how to approach God and how to worship
[1:06:41] him that's right Jesus said that true
[1:06:43] worship was in the spirit and in truth
[1:06:45] John 4:24 but what kind of worship can
[1:06:48] you get in a church that knows so little
[1:06:50] of God it puts up a Santa Claus at
[1:06:53] Christmas and bunnies at Easter amen
[1:06:56] right what it's saying right there what
[1:06:57] brother bram's declaring right there is
[1:07:00] when we go into the traditions and the
[1:07:03] pageants and all of this stuff without
[1:07:05] preaching Christ and him crucified we
[1:07:09] make it all we can look forward to the
[1:07:12] Easter pageant we can look forward to
[1:07:14] this we can look forward to that I just
[1:07:17] love these things my brother and sister
[1:07:19] we're supposed to be in love with
[1:07:21] Christ that's
[1:07:23] right where did they get that they got
[1:07:26] it from pagans that's it and made it a
[1:07:29] part of church doctrine sir but when one
[1:07:31] turns to the Lord and is filled with the
[1:07:34] Holy Ghost he ceases from all such
[1:07:36] things he has a rest in his soul he
[1:07:40] really oh I want to live that's it I
[1:07:43] want to live Saints I I tell you I speak
[1:07:45] this to the young people I speak it to
[1:07:47] everyone let's live life to the fullest
[1:07:51] amen sister Jerry showed me a T-shirt
[1:07:54] and I might just order one and we it it
[1:07:56] said we did we're we didn't how is
[1:07:59] that we are not descended from fearful
[1:08:02] men amen and I stand here as a Son of
[1:08:07] God and I can declare I did not descend
[1:08:11] from fearful
[1:08:12] men did Jesus Christ in the flesh he
[1:08:16] knew what was coming my brother and
[1:08:18] sister he said Lord if it be thy will
[1:08:21] let this cup pass from me
[1:08:25] but nevertheless yes sir what did he do
[1:08:27] he just put his own desire his own
[1:08:29] thoughts everything of the flesh man to
[1:08:31] the side and said thy will be done and
[1:08:35] he knew the will would
[1:08:37] require a great
[1:08:40] sacrifice so now let's look at this my
[1:08:43] brother and
[1:08:44] sister I want to go back and and part of
[1:08:46] the reason I chose this quote there's
[1:08:48] many that kind of speak along these
[1:08:51] lines then most of them go to church on
[1:08:53] Sunday that is good but even there they
[1:08:56] have no idea on how to approach God and
[1:08:58] how to worship him I want to draw that
[1:09:00] out and I want to take it now to this
[1:09:03] cop phenician woman she was there she
[1:09:06] knew that in him by Revelation I believe
[1:09:09] I don't believe somebody persuaded her I
[1:09:12] don't believe somebody laid it all out
[1:09:13] about this should be the Messiah and he
[1:09:15] healed over here and he should be able
[1:09:17] to help you and your daughter it might
[1:09:19] be that nobody in the present company
[1:09:22] knew the situation of her house that's
[1:09:24] right but he was drawn by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:27] now my brother and sister when you look
[1:09:28] in the scripture now some people get all
[1:09:31] fussed over these things if it doesn't
[1:09:32] show it in the scripture then you know
[1:09:34] you shouldn't cover it but we'll find my
[1:09:36] brother and sister that it is quite late
[1:09:39] in this scripture where the term or
[1:09:41] words holy ghost shows up but my brother
[1:09:44] and sister as the very beginning of this
[1:09:46] scripture right here the Holy Ghost is
[1:09:48] present the very spirit of God Amen
[1:09:52] that's what the Holy Ghost is the very
[1:09:54] spirit of God so where wherever God is
[1:09:56] his spirit is also present it is not
[1:09:59] that we sit here this morning and say
[1:10:01] well God is in the building with us this
[1:10:03] morning now we're waiting for his holy
[1:10:05] spirit to come I'm sorry if he is here
[1:10:08] the holy spirit is here and if you have
[1:10:11] the Holy Ghost then you have God in you
[1:10:15] amen so we're not looking for some
[1:10:17] second part or third part it is God in
[1:10:20] you and so here is a Sy syop phenician
[1:10:23] woman she is there and she recognizes
[1:10:26] that the remedy to her situation is
[1:10:29] right here in front of us my brother and
[1:10:31] sister now I don't want to sound rough
[1:10:33] or crude but I'm telling you what
[1:10:35] there's some Believers you can't beat
[1:10:37] off with a stick and there are those
[1:10:39] that you just be a little cross with
[1:10:41] them and why they're just got their
[1:10:43] feathers ruffled up and and you know I
[1:10:45] don't know if any of you ever raised bny
[1:10:47] roosters I'll tell you what a bny
[1:10:49] rooster does they run around and they
[1:10:51] peck on everything and everybody until
[1:10:54] somebody PE back and then they ruffle
[1:10:56] their feathers up and walk
[1:11:01] off come
[1:11:03] on you know there phrase in the world
[1:11:05] they can dish it out but they can't take
[1:11:07] it well I'll tell you what we can dish
[1:11:09] it out and we can take it amen we can
[1:11:13] say Satan get behind me and he doesn't
[1:11:16] listen a bit he just keeps throwing
[1:11:18] those logs and chains and everything out
[1:11:20] in front of you and my brother and
[1:11:21] sister we as the bride of Christ will
[1:11:23] say Well it don't matter Satan what you
[1:11:25] think you're still defeated right you're
[1:11:28] still defeated and I'm not just cuz it
[1:11:30] seemed like there was more obstacles in
[1:11:32] my path after I stood up and started to
[1:11:34] voice it get behind me Satan there's
[1:11:36] more obstacles we don't twist in our
[1:11:39] mind we're not double-minded we are
[1:11:41] there he is defeated and in my mind my
[1:11:45] heart my soul he is behind me he no
[1:11:48] longer looms uh omniscient ompr strong
[1:11:51] and fearful in before me he is now
[1:11:54] defeated and Satan you have caused
[1:11:57] trouble you have brought many times you
[1:12:00] have brought distress and and
[1:12:02] discouragement but that is all behind me
[1:12:06] and you have to Saints this is not
[1:12:07] psychology you have to look at that and
[1:12:10] no matter what happens you have to say
[1:12:12] I'm sorry Satan you're still behind me
[1:12:14] yes you're still behind me I don't care
[1:12:17] the wheels fall off the wagon Satan
[1:12:18] you're still behind me now look at this
[1:12:21] lady look at her approach she comes she
[1:12:25] doesn't go to the temple to the
[1:12:27] priest she doesn't go to to to the
[1:12:32] council she came to the
[1:12:36] word right she comes to the word because
[1:12:41] she has Revelation that the word is the
[1:12:44] answer to her problem Oh my brother and
[1:12:48] sister many people today and I don't
[1:12:49] want to go off in any negative vein but
[1:12:51] many people today my brother and sister
[1:12:53] they run over here to brother soul and
[1:12:55] so they run over to here they run over
[1:12:56] to there they almost seek advice from
[1:12:58] the counsel they want to do my brother
[1:13:00] and sister your answer is in the
[1:13:02] word
[1:13:04] amen so what does she do when she comes
[1:13:08] she hadn't had schooling on how to
[1:13:11] approach
[1:13:17] Jesus but down in her heart the word as
[1:13:20] we would see it on the written page was
[1:13:22] already being opened up to her
[1:13:26] and she
[1:13:27] recognized here is my answer here is
[1:13:32] what I
[1:13:33] need right you
[1:13:37] dog no problem I'm a dog I still want
[1:13:41] the crumbs from your
[1:13:43] table you might look down on me no
[1:13:46] problem you see the reason was is cuz by
[1:13:50] Revelation she was willing to submit
[1:13:52] herself to the word not to man she was
[1:13:56] submitting herself to the word she said
[1:14:00] nevertheless if I'm a dog I want the
[1:14:03] crumbs all I need is your crumbs cuz
[1:14:07] even just a
[1:14:11] touch is
[1:14:13] sufficient I read a deal this man was a
[1:14:17] molecular
[1:14:20] scientist focus on
[1:14:24] the blood not just of humans but blood
[1:14:27] in
[1:14:30] general and he got
[1:14:34] saved and it was such an interesting
[1:14:37] thing to him when he got saved gave his
[1:14:39] heart to the Lord that he being a
[1:14:42] scientist that studied
[1:14:45] blood that it would be the blood of
[1:14:47] Jesus
[1:14:50] Christ and one day he had just a
[1:14:55] screaming fit in the
[1:14:57] laboratory when the
[1:14:59] revelation of the breakdown of the blood
[1:15:03] he was thinking of human blood when the
[1:15:04] breakdown of human blood and I don't
[1:15:08] remember these terms I don't think in
[1:15:10] these terms but in the smallest element
[1:15:14] involved in human
[1:15:17] blood I forget what that's called but it
[1:15:20] was some kind of little you know atom
[1:15:22] thing bouncing around in there break
[1:15:25] down to the smallest element of human
[1:15:29] blood and he realized how little of
[1:15:33] Jesus Christ he
[1:15:36] needed to be
[1:15:38] saved he didn't have to have some great
[1:15:41] big huge portion and he being an
[1:15:44] intellectual man realized he simply just
[1:15:47] needed to
[1:15:49] believe and my brother and sister the
[1:15:51] man then had a great Revival in his life
[1:15:54] and in his family because it wasn't by
[1:15:57] works it wasn't by how much he could
[1:15:59] serve it wasn't by how much he could
[1:16:01] give but it was how much he would die or
[1:16:04] give of himself to let that little bit
[1:16:07] of Jesus Christ change his life oh you
[1:16:10] know I think about that what a lovely
[1:16:12] story amen but look at how her approach
[1:16:15] is I I need to be moving on but look how
[1:16:18] this uh approach was that she did not
[1:16:21] come by some certain H Avenue she did
[1:16:25] not say well I must do this and I must
[1:16:27] do this I must offer alms or an offering
[1:16:30] or some kind of words of Praise but she
[1:16:33] realized as a child of God a daughter of
[1:16:35] God that her daughter in the flesh
[1:16:38] needed a deliverance and here was the
[1:16:41] one who could do the Deliverance what
[1:16:43] did she do she come she spoke of him but
[1:16:46] as brother brandham lays this out for us
[1:16:48] in the uh uh scriptures concerning
[1:16:51] Matthew that she came and she said Lord
[1:16:55] help me now Lord is a master right so
[1:16:58] she said uh Master help me but you see
[1:17:03] the problem was is she was identifying
[1:17:07] with him in the wrong fashion she had
[1:17:09] come and said have mercy on me oh Lord
[1:17:13] thou son of David but see she was not of
[1:17:16] the House of
[1:17:18] David technically he had no obligation
[1:17:21] to
[1:17:23] her but do you realize
[1:17:26] even as the scripture says when you
[1:17:28] don't know how or what to
[1:17:31] say the spirit will give you
[1:17:35] utterance so she identifies him as Lord
[1:17:39] Master which was completely correct but
[1:17:42] thou son of David which was wrong was
[1:17:45] not the right identification but you see
[1:17:48] instead of being uh uh uh uh buffered by
[1:17:52] that or or or set back by that uh she
[1:17:59] then presses in I hope you catch that
[1:18:03] this morning it's not about being
[1:18:08] buffered or set back my brother and
[1:18:10] sister but it's about pressing in amen
[1:18:14] you'll find that'll be what separates
[1:18:16] the bride of
[1:18:18] Christ you know what I find interesting
[1:18:20] to just give this in a natural deal
[1:18:23] sometimes people are right
[1:18:25] and people will rise up and tell them
[1:18:27] they're wrong and because they don't
[1:18:29] have a lot of confidence in
[1:18:33] their discernment of the right and wrong
[1:18:37] they can be
[1:18:41] silenced how would I say this in a
[1:18:43] better way they can be
[1:18:46] quieted by someone who's not even
[1:18:53] correct they say does spread a
[1:18:57] lie you speak loud and say it
[1:19:02] often and soon it becomes the
[1:19:06] truth it's what Satan would like to do
[1:19:10] quiet the voice of the
[1:19:12] Bride
[1:19:14] right by telling you often right you're
[1:19:18] not she right you're not
[1:19:21] she you can't be she
[1:19:24] she is a perfect one she is that but you
[1:19:28] see if we look at it through Satan's
[1:19:31] view we will soon believe Satan's
[1:19:42] words how life must have been for her
[1:19:44] with a daughter with a spirit on her we
[1:19:46] don't know what this Spirit calls the
[1:19:48] daughter to do we don't know uh uh what
[1:19:52] detrimental things were happening in her
[1:19:55] life but my brother and sister I can
[1:19:57] tell you this wasn't a young lady but I
[1:19:59] can tell you uh Brother David and I on a
[1:20:02] Wednesday night a man and a woman come
[1:20:05] into the church here and Brother David
[1:20:07] and I spent hours with her praying right
[1:20:09] here in the church only to recognize
[1:20:12] when it was all over the spirit that was
[1:20:14] there while she cried out I want
[1:20:17] forgiveness and I want Deliverance but
[1:20:20] the spirit there was so strong that she
[1:20:23] went off and went off with this man she
[1:20:25] didn't live she didn't uh wasn't married
[1:20:27] to this man she just uh he he described
[1:20:30] himself as her
[1:20:32] protector and I said you got no right to
[1:20:34] protect her well she chose
[1:20:37] me and while she cried for deliverance
[1:20:41] and we prayed for her we prayed with
[1:20:44] her she admitted it was drugs that took
[1:20:47] her out and then because of drugs she
[1:20:49] started to prostitute herself to get the
[1:20:52] drugs and it destroyed her marriage and
[1:20:54] her children children to the point that
[1:20:56] her uh husband uh um they'd recently
[1:20:59] been divorced even though this had been
[1:21:01] going for years uh had uh pulled away
[1:21:04] from her and all of her children and her
[1:21:06] heart would ache and it was there but
[1:21:08] you see that Spirit was so strong that
[1:21:10] in spite of all her cries she found no
[1:21:15] deliverance from that Spirit right so
[1:21:18] one can seriously sincerely desire
[1:21:21] Deliverance without ever finding it are
[1:21:25] you with
[1:21:26] me that's
[1:21:30] right this lady has a daughter with a
[1:21:33] spirit on
[1:21:34] her she's come to the place she's
[1:21:38] willing to do
[1:21:40] anything to find Deliverance for a
[1:21:43] daughter young people not just young
[1:21:46] people all of us but young
[1:21:48] people be careful who you make friends
[1:21:52] with be careful the music you listen to
[1:21:56] be careful of the things you
[1:21:59] read and be careful of the things you
[1:22:04] say because you see when the door is
[1:22:07] open to those
[1:22:09] Spirits the spirits my brother and
[1:22:12] sister as we see with the seven sons of
[1:22:15] CA they're not afraid of
[1:22:18] us I'm talking about in the flesh
[1:22:21] they're not afraid of us Paul we know
[1:22:25] Jesus we know who are you and then
[1:22:26] thrashed him and chased him out of the
[1:22:28] building that's right it's not a game no
[1:22:31] we don't know what brought this little
[1:22:33] this little girl into this stage where
[1:22:35] she is possessed by an evil spirit but
[1:22:38] what we do know is there was a mother
[1:22:40] that said my daughter will not go on
[1:22:43] like this my daughter will be delivered
[1:22:45] of this and she didn't sit back and say
[1:22:47] someday God will do this my brother and
[1:22:49] sister she went to
[1:22:51] what the source she went to the word
[1:22:55] and said you know what there's
[1:22:56] Deliverance in the word and I'm going to
[1:22:59] approach the word and I will not be
[1:23:01] offended by the word until I have what I
[1:23:06] need oh I'll tell you what let us have a
[1:23:09] church full of mothers like that let's
[1:23:12] have a church full of Believers like
[1:23:14] that that are going to go to the source
[1:23:16] and they are not going to be offended
[1:23:18] not turned away they're not going to be
[1:23:20] easily discouraged that's right
[1:23:23] Hallelujah
[1:23:25] a mother who believed the report amen
[1:23:28] what she went right to
[1:23:31] The Living Word that's right there's the
[1:23:34] difference it has to be the Living Word
[1:23:37] Sunday my brother and sister many people
[1:23:39] might feel like I'm too blunt on these
[1:23:41] things many people this morning will be
[1:23:45] in
[1:23:46] church many people will be in message
[1:23:49] churches and they will walk out today no
[1:23:53] different than they walked in
[1:23:57] you got to go to the source and that is
[1:23:59] the Living Word not that we read quotes
[1:24:02] not that we read scriptures not that we
[1:24:04] recount these things the word's got to
[1:24:07] be living and you have to come to it you
[1:24:10] have to come to the place you say I will
[1:24:12] submit myself to the word we're not
[1:24:15] talking about submitting to a man we're
[1:24:18] talking about submitting to the word and
[1:24:21] when we will submit to the word we will
[1:24:23] find the the answer the remedy to the
[1:24:27] situations of Our
[1:24:29] Lives amen she knew in her heart what
[1:24:32] needed to
[1:24:33] happen and she took a Hal of
[1:24:37] that
[1:24:41] amen I imagine that Satan probably come
[1:24:44] with a spirit of
[1:24:45] offense said he called you a
[1:24:49] dog you should ruffle your feathers and
[1:24:51] walk off well if that's the way he's
[1:24:54] going to speak to
[1:24:58] me but you see the real believer knows
[1:25:02] where the remedy is knows where the life
[1:25:05] is
[1:25:06] at and if the word says you need to stop
[1:25:10] what you're doing change your life you
[1:25:12] need to be Washed by the Water you need
[1:25:13] to repent you need whatever it might be
[1:25:16] the real believer is there and says this
[1:25:18] is the truth and this hurts but I can't
[1:25:22] walk away from the truth no matter how
[1:25:26] hard it hurts I can't walk away from the
[1:25:30] truth there's something in the truth
[1:25:33] that is stronger than any spirit of
[1:25:36] offense and my brother and sister Satan
[1:25:38] certainly would like to work the spirit
[1:25:40] of offense he like to come in and when
[1:25:42] people oh praise the Lord I'm preaching
[1:25:45] at anyone in general but when people are
[1:25:47] corrected by the word we got a decision
[1:25:49] to make I'll either stand with the word
[1:25:53] or I will be a
[1:25:54] it oh my brother and sister I'm telling
[1:25:57] you I know it hurts it's a two-edged
[1:26:00] sword it cuts on the way in it cuts on
[1:26:02] the way out but what happens is is when
[1:26:05] we are delivered from those things we
[1:26:08] recognize the sacrifice is worth the
[1:26:12] result amen and here is a mother
[1:26:16] committed Beyond any
[1:26:21] offense could we today say Lord let me
[1:26:26] be committed Beyond any offense never
[1:26:30] never Lord let me be
[1:26:34] offended hallelujah amen now in the
[1:26:38] sermon
[1:26:42] perseverance brother Brown says this
[1:26:45] here there's many places actually I had
[1:26:47] to sort through them until oh you guys
[1:26:49] will like me saying it this way I had to
[1:26:52] sort through all these quotes till I
[1:26:54] found the one that said it the way I
[1:26:56] wanted it to say
[1:26:59] it now the reason I say that
[1:27:02] is I in my heart was looking as it were
[1:27:06] for a particular
[1:27:08] approach right we're not changing it
[1:27:11] we're going as it were to the same exact
[1:27:13] spot but we have 360 to approach it from
[1:27:17] and I'll just be honest with you I I
[1:27:19] like to be transparent to you I I looked
[1:27:22] at these quotes and I found the one that
[1:27:25] approached it from the direction that
[1:27:26] God laid on my heart
[1:27:31] amen and this poor woman was the same
[1:27:34] she wanted she knowed that she was going
[1:27:37] to get it what's that Revelation
[1:27:41] revelation of Faith she knew she was
[1:27:44] going to get it she wasn't going there
[1:27:47] hoping for a Deliverance for her
[1:27:49] daughter she went there knowing I'm
[1:27:52] going to have a Deliverance for my
[1:27:56] daughter see and that's why in Matthew
[1:27:58] he speaks in such as her faith but Mark
[1:28:02] speaks of her words and there is no
[1:28:08] conflict there was no doubt no matter
[1:28:10] what she had to climb
[1:28:12] through come on Saints this is we're
[1:28:15] talking about leod deia we're talking
[1:28:18] about a world that is so wonderful so
[1:28:20] comfortable so good so lulling us to
[1:28:23] sleep
[1:28:26] Leep no matter what she had to climb
[1:28:31] through for just a moment we'll deviate
[1:28:33] to another woman who had a blood issue
[1:28:37] she climbed over them under him went
[1:28:41] through them nothing was going to stop
[1:28:44] her from the Revelation all I need to do
[1:28:47] is touch the Hemm of His Garment amen
[1:28:52] what a revelation that's right you see
[1:28:54] you'll find my brother and sister none
[1:28:56] of the crowd around her had that
[1:28:59] Revelation so much that the disciples
[1:29:02] were like what do you mean everybody's
[1:29:04] touching you but she had a personal
[1:29:08] revelation now my brother and sister
[1:29:10] personal Revelations are not outside of
[1:29:13] the word but it's real because it's mine
[1:29:15] personal revelation lines up with the
[1:29:18] word but it is God speaking to
[1:29:22] you amen it is not a general
[1:29:25] conversation to the whole church
[1:29:27] assembly but God dealing with you and it
[1:29:31] becomes personal that God speaks to you
[1:29:33] in that and you then stand upon that
[1:29:37] someone else would say I've never heard
[1:29:39] of God doing it that way why would God
[1:29:41] speak to you why would my brother and
[1:29:43] sister it don't matter what they think
[1:29:45] it don't matter if you have some great
[1:29:47] historical record to back it up if it
[1:29:49] lines up to the word and God spoke it to
[1:29:51] you hold on to that that's right amen
[1:29:54] amen amen she was going to get it anyhow
[1:29:58] am so look at this I like the prophet's
[1:30:01] words here and I don't believe they're
[1:30:02] just random words I believe there's
[1:30:04] anointing here so Jesus couldn't even
[1:30:07] turn her back
[1:30:09] right get this now I want you to think
[1:30:11] about that she wanted it so much she was
[1:30:14] so determined to get what was she felt
[1:30:17] was rightfully hers for her daughter
[1:30:20] that even Jesus and brother brandham
[1:30:22] says here by calling her of the wrong
[1:30:24] race calling her a dog it wasn't right
[1:30:26] to take the children's bread and feed
[1:30:28] dogs and so forth like that but still
[1:30:32] she went right on after it why because
[1:30:37] she had a revelation that her daughter's
[1:30:39] healing was right here oh she wasn't
[1:30:43] going to walk away until she possessed
[1:30:45] her daughter's
[1:30:47] Deliverance oh Hallelujah she went right
[1:30:50] after it anyhow because she was
[1:30:52] persistent amen she had a need her
[1:30:55] daughter was dying others had been he
[1:30:58] healed so why couldn't her daughter be
[1:31:01] healed that was the god of
[1:31:05] creation Now I want you to think about
[1:31:07] it it was a god of creation that went
[1:31:09] right down to her town right down to her
[1:31:11] house laid Revelation how did it come to
[1:31:14] her we don't know it might have been a
[1:31:16] passer by saying you know up here they
[1:31:18] have a man and he's speaking the words
[1:31:21] and laying on hands and and spitting in
[1:31:23] in the mud and wiping it on their eyes
[1:31:25] all these Miracles are taking place and
[1:31:28] it's just phenomenal and she's sitting
[1:31:30] there saying there's the answer for my
[1:31:32] daughter I don't know how it happened
[1:31:34] but the word come to her in her
[1:31:37] house amen and struck her heart and
[1:31:40] that's Revelation and it led her out the
[1:31:43] door she left her child behind in the
[1:31:46] care of someone else and went on and
[1:31:49] found this and when she come no amount
[1:31:51] of
[1:31:52] words right no amount of words our
[1:31:55] pastor preaches too hard our pastor
[1:31:58] preaches too long there's times our
[1:32:00] pastor makes no sense
[1:32:03] that's I don't care I didn't come to see
[1:32:05] the pastor that's right I didn't come
[1:32:08] for the pastor I came because I believe
[1:32:11] God is here I believe God is in his word
[1:32:14] and I believe his word is here so you
[1:32:16] might have come to see if the tie fits
[1:32:18] the shirt I picked it out myself is it
[1:32:20] okay
[1:32:24] none of that
[1:32:25] matters nothing's going to discourage
[1:32:29] it because that's not the reason I came
[1:32:32] amen is to whether he would say oh woman
[1:32:34] of great faith will have need
[1:32:37] you no no just a second the faith was
[1:32:42] there yeah but the test yeah came before
[1:32:47] the expression of the
[1:32:51] faith now I'm not speaking lightly I
[1:32:53] don't I don't don't mean to speak
[1:32:55] lightly but it's just something I wonder
[1:32:58] about and that's when you meet
[1:33:01] people that you've hardly shook hands
[1:33:03] with
[1:33:05] him nice to meet you I'm a Believer also
[1:33:08] I'm a man of great
[1:33:14] faith you've went through a fiery
[1:33:16] furnace you've been in a lion's
[1:33:19] den you've Fallen to the Earth from a
[1:33:22] burning airplane what what where where
[1:33:24] is the proof you're a man of great
[1:33:28] faith now you're going to think I'm
[1:33:30] turning on my own words here in just a
[1:33:34] minute often
[1:33:38] question knew a man many years ago my
[1:33:41] dad used it to make a lesson to me this
[1:33:44] man used to every time you'd see him
[1:33:47] known this man till he passed away
[1:33:49] practically my whole
[1:33:50] life and uh he would come up and Shake
[1:33:53] Your Hand
[1:33:55] and I'm just a humble
[1:34:01] man okay you're a humble man one day my
[1:34:06] dad said son I just want you to
[1:34:09] understand those that have to tell you
[1:34:12] they're humble usually
[1:34:17] aren't because the H humble man's life
[1:34:20] will show you he's humble amen
[1:34:24] but while it seems like here in just a
[1:34:26] second you're going to think I have a
[1:34:29] conflict
[1:34:31] sometimes God wants us to speak those
[1:34:34] things that are not as though they are
[1:34:37] that's
[1:34:39] right Hallelujah I'm a man of Faith
[1:34:43] that's it I'm a man of Faith right now I
[1:34:47] might not have enough faith for a
[1:34:48] toothache but I'm making my declaration
[1:34:52] I'm a man of faith amen amen you might
[1:34:56] be able to stand and say Lord I'm a
[1:34:59] humble man and you might realize that in
[1:35:02] reality you're not you you know how you
[1:35:04] find out whether someone's humble or
[1:35:07] not just go scratch them
[1:35:10] right go scratch them you'll find out if
[1:35:12] they're humble or
[1:35:14] not often times saints come on let's
[1:35:16] let's not necessarily for humor sake but
[1:35:19] let's recognize this often for not you
[1:35:22] scratch someone and they will humbly
[1:35:24] choke you kick you and
[1:35:28] bite no it's the truth but God make us
[1:35:32] humble I want to be humble Lord I want
[1:35:34] to be a man of Faith amen so what am I
[1:35:37] going to do I'm going to claim that I'm
[1:35:40] going to speak out I'm going to make my
[1:35:42] claim on who I am according to the word
[1:35:45] of
[1:35:49] God let me back up a little bit she went
[1:35:52] right after it anyhow because she she
[1:35:53] was persistent she had a need her
[1:35:55] daughter was dying others had been
[1:35:57] healed so why couldn't her daughter be
[1:36:00] healed and that was the god of creation
[1:36:03] Drew her right to it Jesus said for this
[1:36:05] saying the devil left your daughter see
[1:36:08] for this saying my brother and sister
[1:36:10] brother brandom's coming right back here
[1:36:11] out of Mark and for this saying for the
[1:36:14] simple fact that you stood here you took
[1:36:17] the words that were
[1:36:20] testing if you'll eat my flesh
[1:36:24] and drink my blood what was it it wasn't
[1:36:28] a commandment in the sense that we often
[1:36:31] think of it was a
[1:36:34] test
[1:36:38] yes and you won't have to worry about
[1:36:40] looking at the bread and the wine and
[1:36:44] understanding revelation of what was
[1:36:46] being said if you can't get past the
[1:36:48] simple words Eat My Flesh and drink my
[1:36:52] blood
[1:36:53] there what was what was God doing he
[1:36:55] just sorted or sifted them right there
[1:36:58] and there would be those that were there
[1:37:00] my brother and sister I can assure you
[1:37:02] there would be those who understood it
[1:37:04] no more than those who walked away but
[1:37:06] as the words were there Lord where could
[1:37:09] we go I just got nowhere to go Lord I
[1:37:12] don't know that I even understand what
[1:37:14] you just said but I got nowhere else to
[1:37:16] go Lord so I'm just going to stay right
[1:37:18] here and I you know Revelation going to
[1:37:21] come
[1:37:24] my
[1:37:25] mind she had the right approach to God's
[1:37:30] Gift did you know God does things
[1:37:32] sometimes just to do things a different
[1:37:34] way just to find out what people will
[1:37:39] do you know Saints I I I'm you guys just
[1:37:43] keep coming back and I'm happy I want us
[1:37:45] to have a church full of uh Godly Holy
[1:37:49] Ghost filled
[1:37:50] people and I apologize you know there's
[1:37:53] sometimes I just say things that you
[1:37:54] might say now why did he say that I just
[1:37:57] say that because uh I want to see what
[1:37:59] you're going to do about
[1:38:02] it I want to see what your reaction
[1:38:06] is and sometimes church maybe I
[1:38:10] shouldn't be so transparent here but
[1:38:13] there's been things said from this
[1:38:14] Pulpit that while you sat there and said
[1:38:17] now I'm not sure I understand where
[1:38:18] Brother Paul's going it lit other people
[1:38:20] on fire and I got to watch them melt
[1:38:23] down right in the
[1:38:27] church why did I say it is Paul so
[1:38:30] bright that he can think far enough
[1:38:32] ahead and word it in such a way I'm
[1:38:34] sorry ask my wife she'll tell
[1:38:37] you sorry about that sister
[1:38:40] Jerry no you see God
[1:38:44] knowing what
[1:38:46] button to
[1:38:49] push come on kids um do you know what
[1:38:51] button to push on Mom
[1:38:56] H come on you know what I'm talking
[1:39:00] about the mama you love me button is
[1:39:03] when you're in the store and you want
[1:39:04] her to buy you something and you keep
[1:39:05] pushing the mama you love me
[1:39:08] button but when it's time to vacuum and
[1:39:10] do the laundry and whatever you push a
[1:39:12] different
[1:39:18] button
[1:39:20] amen amen and all the children here
[1:39:25] today said
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:31] amen God does things to find out what we
[1:39:36] will do amen that's right cuz if you can
[1:39:39] be discouraged and run off he will
[1:39:43] discourage you and run you
[1:39:45] off but I don't think that that's going
[1:39:48] to happen now look brother Brown goes on
[1:39:51] to say it's over your head you haven't
[1:39:52] seen it and haven't noticed but I done
[1:39:54] something just now to do something
[1:39:56] that's
[1:39:57] right so he did something to cause
[1:40:01] something else to happen and we don't
[1:40:03] have a clue what he was talking about
[1:40:04] but neither did the people in the
[1:40:07] service and that so helped me and I
[1:40:09] watched it work see you say things you
[1:40:11] change your attitude right you change
[1:40:16] your
[1:40:17] voice you change sometimes your sermon
[1:40:22] watching and seeing certain things then
[1:40:24] watch and see how it
[1:40:30] acts I know you guys don't see the
[1:40:32] strings but I commit myself to God every
[1:40:35] time I come to this Pulpit Lord let me
[1:40:38] only say and do what you
[1:40:40] desire if I could put it to you and I
[1:40:43] pray that it's not my flesh and not me
[1:40:45] as a carnal man but you don't see the
[1:40:47] strings but you see we're here moving
[1:40:49] and doing according to what God wants
[1:40:52] done yeah
[1:40:53] and we see how in many cases it will
[1:40:56] cause one to look in their life and
[1:40:59] maybe they'll just start crying or
[1:41:01] praying or crying out and you'll see
[1:41:03] another they feel frustrated another
[1:41:06] feels confused another just plain
[1:41:09] rejects right
[1:41:14] amen and then brother Bram goes on he
[1:41:16] said
[1:41:18] because the prayer line is fixing to
[1:41:20] come up and it would be better for that
[1:41:22] not to be a
[1:41:23] you so what did he do he come down and
[1:41:26] he took the sword of the word and he cut
[1:41:29] away it something and I'll just put it
[1:41:31] this turn I don't mean it literal in the
[1:41:33] church here but somebody on the front
[1:41:34] row is just like
[1:41:36] Hallelujah and somebody somewhere else
[1:41:38] in the church is like oh if I could just
[1:41:41] get my hand around his
[1:41:43] neck same
[1:41:45] words same
[1:41:49] words but he says it'd be better off
[1:41:52] that it wasn't among you see just to see
[1:41:54] it happen then you change yourself and
[1:41:56] go back somewhere again see God did that
[1:41:58] very thing he still does it noticing she
[1:42:01] had the right approach to God's gift and
[1:42:03] remember she was the first one Gentile
[1:42:05] that God ever done a miracle on she was
[1:42:07] the first Gentile Faith admits the word
[1:42:12] is
[1:42:13] truth oh Hallelujah I I would almost ask
[1:42:17] brother Alex uh but then I thought well
[1:42:19] okay we can just make the emphasis I
[1:42:20] wanted me to put that in great big red
[1:42:23] letters on there Faith admits the word
[1:42:27] is truth and look at these closing lines
[1:42:30] now this going to be a little pointed
[1:42:32] sorry if it does offend
[1:42:36] anyone Faith let's be in context here
[1:42:38] okay are you with me high school dropout
[1:42:41] talking about English I want to teach
[1:42:42] you an English lesson Faith there's our
[1:42:46] subject admits the word is truth and
[1:42:50] faith is reverent yes amen see it's
[1:42:54] still in our subject faith is reverent
[1:42:57] very
[1:43:00] reverent when you find people Saints
[1:43:03] amen don't agree with you and they
[1:43:06] become irreverent Amen in the service in
[1:43:09] the sanctuary in the fer in the basement
[1:43:13] in the parking lot there's something
[1:43:18] wrong H that was a little straight
[1:43:21] wasn't it but we can make excuses for it
[1:43:24] well you just don't understand no I
[1:43:25] don't understand cuz I know what the
[1:43:27] prophet said I don't
[1:43:28] understand and I thank God for this and
[1:43:30] I am not boasting lest I would be tested
[1:43:33] but my brother and sister I've set in
[1:43:35] Services where things were preached that
[1:43:37] I blantantly knew did not line up with
[1:43:39] the message did not line up with the
[1:43:40] Bible and I was able to walk out there
[1:43:43] shake hands with the preacher after the
[1:43:45] service and go on knowing that they
[1:43:47] staunchly sincerely believed in what
[1:43:49] they were saying even though it wasn't
[1:43:51] correct and I never had to try and burn
[1:43:53] the church down that's
[1:43:56] right so there's something wrong when
[1:44:00] the faith won't admit
[1:44:03] truth and is
[1:44:05] irreverent little blunt but sometimes I
[1:44:08] think blunt is
[1:44:09] good amen see she submitted to the word
[1:44:14] and it brought the word to life in her
[1:44:17] house Isn't that cool wherever she was
[1:44:20] at we don't know how far she was from
[1:44:22] her home
[1:44:24] but as she is there submitting herself
[1:44:26] to the
[1:44:27] word and now we don't know exactly all
[1:44:30] of those things we don't know maybe she
[1:44:32] got down on her hands and knees maybe
[1:44:34] she got down on her knees maybe she did
[1:44:36] whatever you see sometimes we put too
[1:44:39] much emphasis on the physical
[1:44:47] postering reminds me one time I preached
[1:44:49] in a church
[1:44:54] that sounds a little arrogant doesn't it
[1:44:55] not too too much humility here I
[1:44:58] preached in a church and it was an
[1:45:01] awesome
[1:45:04] service I got to watch God move I got to
[1:45:06] watch break through a a sister come to
[1:45:09] the altar that had had this bitterness
[1:45:11] that was just ripping her life apart and
[1:45:13] God delivers her in that service another
[1:45:16] family was having an issue with a child
[1:45:18] and they managed to convince their child
[1:45:20] to come up front and we prayed with them
[1:45:22] and God delivered that child we got to
[1:45:24] see all of these
[1:45:26] things and I also got to walk out of
[1:45:29] that church in the foyer at the end of
[1:45:32] the service and shake hands with a
[1:45:35] man who is almost
[1:45:39] like God bless
[1:45:43] you thank
[1:45:48] you what are we going to do with the
[1:45:50] word amen right it's not the man
[1:45:56] here submit ourselves to the word humble
[1:45:59] ourselves to the word let the word be
[1:46:04] preeminent let the word correct us let
[1:46:07] the word wash us right go to the word
[1:46:11] and don't be driven
[1:46:13] away there's plenty of critics the world
[1:46:16] we live in today my brother and sister
[1:46:17] there's plenty of critics we wouldn't
[1:46:20] know what to believe we wouldn't know
[1:46:21] what to where to go and what to do if we
[1:46:24] listen to the critics but listen to the
[1:46:26] Revelation that God placed in your heart
[1:46:30] amen not what this man thinks it should
[1:46:32] be not this man's interpretation of the
[1:46:35] message what this man sees the faults of
[1:46:37] the message you need to find your own
[1:46:40] personal revelation with Jesus Christ
[1:46:42] and when he tells you eat my flesh and
[1:46:45] drink my blood then you with revelation
[1:46:48] will be able to say I will Lord you
[1:46:51] won't be there questioning what's going
[1:46:53] on has he turned into a vampire has he
[1:46:55] turned into a cannibal why would a man
[1:46:57] do this he must be be above my brother
[1:46:59] and sister it showed there was not one
[1:47:01] drop of Revelation in them they were
[1:47:04] following because it was the New
[1:47:06] Movement it's the new thing in town it
[1:47:08] was the new ideology we'll follow it and
[1:47:11] see what
[1:47:12] happens but when it come down to God in
[1:47:17] them they couldn't deal with it they had
[1:47:21] to push back how can would God be in
[1:47:24] me well I'll tell you how he'll be in
[1:47:27] you because he said he would we don't
[1:47:31] need any other evidence than he said he
[1:47:34] would I don't have to go find some
[1:47:36] tangible thing to hold up and show you

[1:48:08] law now Paul speaking here of the valley
[1:48:11] or the shadow rather the law being a
[1:48:14] shadow of good things to come could

[1:48:19] perfect then he goes on to show what the
[1:48:23] Perfection is see that's necessary we

[1:54:29] need for her daughter what was that that

[1:57:49] to ban him from coming to church cuz he
[1:57:51] he' just act that behavior out in
[1:57:54] church and a daughter that was so
[1:57:57] discouraged in her life that she
[1:57:58] scratched words in her own flesh or

[2:06:34] you know I read this little deal and
[2:06:37] sometimes you don't understand
[2:06:39] why people think what they
[2:06:42] think this man wrote A Deal questioning
[2:06:45] he says I don't
[2:06:48] understand how God
[2:06:51] would protect Daniel in a lion's
[2:06:54] den and let them saints in the Dark Ages
[2:06:58] be tore up by the lion he said I don't
[2:07:04] understand and I was looking at that it
[2:07:06] caused me to say you know what thank you
[2:07:08] Lord for a word that's opened up in our
[2:07:12] day to know that those Saints of old
[2:07:14] were anointed yes sir to walk out there
[2:07:17] did they not feel physical fear no I
[2:07:20] imagine they probably in their shoes but
[2:07:23] the anointing was so strong this is what
[2:07:26] God called me for the Lord prise the
[2:07:31] Lord and so much history you'll see as
[2:07:33] they stood there as the lion rushed to
[2:07:36] them and one swipe of a paw finished
[2:07:39] their
[2:07:41] life and here we are in
[2:07:44] leoa every destructive Spirit that's
[2:07:49] ever been in the ages that's right
[2:07:52] I hope you catch this cuz we think oh
[2:07:54] Lord could I have stood in a Coliseum
[2:07:57] and a a lion be turned loose on me would
[2:08:00] I have not run would I have not tried to
[2:08:01] climb the fence would I have not begged
[2:08:03] for mercy no they were anointed amen
[2:08:06] that's it and they stood under that
[2:08:08] anointing amen and I'm here to tell you
[2:08:10] that every one of those Spirits from the
[2:08:13] first age coming right on down is here
[2:08:17] right
[2:08:19] now and you're anointed to stand amen
[2:08:23] you're anointed to say Amen to the word
[2:08:26] you're anointed to fulfill the word you
