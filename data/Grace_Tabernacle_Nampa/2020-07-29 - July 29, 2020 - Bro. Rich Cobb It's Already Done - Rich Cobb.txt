bind every spirit of unbelief through the name of jesus christ the son of god and lord god i release into this auditorium tonight the peace and the victory of the holy spirit and the word lord so that the holy spirit can speak the mind of god exactly the way you want it lord jesus we bless your holy name lord jesus we praise you lord god thank you so much lord god amen let's sing that he is here he is here amen he [Music] will is his holy name [Music] he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name he is here you can touch him you [Music] hallelujah amen oh praise the lord amen hallelujah amen we we like to fill him but we know he's here anyway amen praise the lord jesus he's so wonderful amen let's turn to psalm 16 and 11 and while we read that i was listening to the token this morning in 64 and at the end of the of the sermon he was telling him he said now when you go through the prayer line he wasn't discerning he was just laying on of hands with the other brothers he says as you walk through this prayer line those that are in wheelchairs get up those that have crutches thrown down amen praise the lord amen i like that and guess what happened they got up and they threw them down amen so i say praise the lord amen because he brought a presence of victory and that's what's here tonight is a presence of victory this message when brother paul asked me god gave it to me uh whatever a month ago or whatever it is so i know that god's gonna do something amen so praise the lord he's already done it amen he's just gonna let us allow us to have revelation that he's already done it amen and so the message is it's already done praise the lord psalm 16 11 that would show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand power and authority there are pleasures forevermore amen lord jesus we thank you for the victory that overcomes the world even our faith we thank you that you absolutely are the same yesterday today and forever and so lord god as you save us you heal us as you lead and guide us you lead us into the truth as you let us see you that lovely one in plain view lord god then we're able to be with you and know you lord god in the power of your resurrection in the fellowship of your sufferings lord and that goes so much deeper than signs and wonders and miracles though that is you also lord god and we're thankful for it lord when we need some medicine we reach up and we grab it out of the skies that are full of your promises lord jesus we praise you and we thank you in the name of jesus christ amen hallelujah you may be seated amen brother branham says we all know it that healing is always his will it's just our duty to believe it amen and he'll figure out the rest amen and so i love that he will show me the path of life amen he brought you to the banquet table amen and and so he's given you revelation of who he is which is the path of life amen and so in his presence his fullness of joy amen in that shekinah glory in that intimate place that you and god get together amen and then he reveals himself in that intimacy and what does that bring it brings confidence it brings a spirit of victory it brings a spirit of overcoming to know that your husband knows all about you amen hallelujah and it says in here at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore the right hand is the hand of power amen it even says in revelation that he he causes his bride to sit with her in his throne amen and his throne is his authority and power over everything that is created you are eternal amen everything else is created praise the lord amen i'm just gonna have to take it off right now amen because i might get excited praise the lord but i like to see god revealed amen praise the lord and so that power and authority is the sign of the end time and so i'm here tonight is that in your heart stand up amen and and go in front of the world go in front of the devil and say i'm not afraid of you anymore because my husband is behind me he's before me he's all around me and everything he said is true and you are now you are on defense the devil is on defense you are on offense amen hallelujah and so there's pleasures forevermore and so we're in a real day of refreshing this is a glorious time to be alive and god is using everything that is around us to refresh our soul praise the lord jesus amen the devil has no rights in the flesh of the believer but what we have a right to do is take the word of god and speak it and and trample right over him and go forward amen hallelujah here's a little quote amen now notice the first thing was a refreshment what makes the seed grow did you ever get up in the morning and find the dew that fell down from heaven and refreshes the earth how does it refresh it when it's at peace the dew don't fall in daytime the dew falls in the night time amen when everything is at peace and you're going brother uh just wait the dew can never fall on you my brother as long as you're fussing and arguing and stewing about the things here on this earth he says get along with god and let the dew drops of mercy fall upon you in the stillness he goes he goes into a few songs but he goes how that god can get his believer with the curtains dropped around him alone to himself he will bring down a refreshing from heaven that there's no other person amen individual walk or no other way in the world ever know it only he that's laying there only you know it amen hallelujah and he takes all of this stuff that's out there and he he allows you to as his bride to to come in tight into him amen and he refreshes you and that's why you can walk out and be rejoicing that he's the same yesterday today and forever you can walk out that those children that you bore in your body that you speak it over them and that holy spirit has gone out and they have to obey the holy spirit amen blessed be the name of the lord amen that is thus saith the lord that is your right amen hallelujah i love it and so you were being refreshed in this time oh it's a glorious time to be alive amen and so these are the days of elijah amen hallelujah these are the days where jesus christ is proving himself amen to you to the church of the living god amen he's already he's gathering and bundling all the others but you he is maturing in him this is a time not to be caught up in in the spirits of laodicea in the churchianity and the politics and all that stuff get along with god and let that refreshing fall in your life amen look at psalm 91 that is in the old testament but it absolutely states the position of the believer amen it states exactly how he cares how he feels he who dwells in the secret place of the most high that kind of sounds like the little room to me hallelujah shall he he he'll he'll he'll bless him amen there's another one out of jeremiah 17 where it says he he will be like a tree by waters the heat will not brown the leaves and the fruit will keep bearing even in the time of dryness amen the the fruit will keep coming amen that's how he thinks about you so what's a little chaos going to do to the believer amen you are still bearing fruit you're still manifesting jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and we're going to sprinkle some testimonies in here amen not from the past not from brother branham amen not for my dad hallelujah because there's plenty of those hey man amen and and because a lot of men from that age had a lot of supernatural with them and god's still here and he's still the same and it's rugged faith and god still does exactly the same things and so god is not only proving himself to his bride but she is realizing that she will stay with the word by the spirit amen a mental revelation you are going to go back into the world amen but she realizes that because of the holy spirit that has done something in her soul she is staying with the word and things are going on around her and she's going wow man i still have a desire to go to church even when we were on on video amen i i wanted to be in church and now that it's gone uh then i'm back in church but i tell you we've lost people because a little too long amen and you get a little see laodicea is more lethal than what you think amen but see the bride we're going to stay positive the bride you can't wait to get back amen you can't wait to sing the songs of zion amen and you realize that man look at all the others though i pray for their souls and i'm believing that they're going to be back but isn't it a miracle that i want to be in church amen that i want to praise the lord and so for the bride here's the thing for the bride to abide under the mighty hand of god she must abide under all the word amen hallelujah amen she can't hope so and and i'm not going to say who or where but i i've known people that lately that they you know kovitz in their family and and and they want to come and be a part of a body and they're saying oh don't worry about it brother i'm saying you know well you're not coming am i afraid no but see there's no basis for their faith they have this faith wonderful people awesome people but the faith is here we say that's very judgmental brother well i i can i'm not going to list it but i can list out whole things how they break the laws every day see but in their mind they say god sent a prophet i believe i believe this message and so nothing's going to harm me amen but see that's different and so let's look at a little a little uh testament to that in first samuel 15 and 14 through 23. first samuel 15-14 amen through 23 and samuel said i like it what meaneth in the bleeding of the sheep in mine ears and the loin of the oxen which i hear and saul said they did you notice he never took responsibility oh it was the people amen it's like what kind of pastor are you to let your congregation overrun the word amen hallelujah that's why you need ministry to stay with the word the word the word the word amen hallelujah he says they have brought them from the malachites samuel is going saul who's king in this in this court amen and so on down he says wherefore then did thou not obey the voice of the lord but sits but it's fly up on the spoil he's saying why did you bring all the the best stuff back and it's evil in the sight of the lord and saul said in december yeah i have obeyed the voice of the lord pastor i believe god sent a problem i believe that the seals are open i believe this and and yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me amen and have brought a gag the king of the of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites but the people took of the spoiled sheep and auction and the chief of the things amen that were destroyed and they did it for good amen pastor i won the lottery and here's my tithes no amen that's truth that has happened amen hallelujah but see and samuel said hat the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord in this day amen we don't need a big education we don't need to have of a a 13 degree black belt in the message amen hallelujah we don't need to be great teachers so that you can't even touch the ground amen but all he wants is obedience to god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he wants you know be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken unto the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sign of witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry because the house rejected the word of the lord amen he hath also rejected him from you from being king amen that was a definite amen saul still went to heaven and so i i see everything that's going on today and this is a snapshot these people aren't they're not into hell but but if you i've never seen so many old ladies old sisters who are rebels today it's like man sister that that 20 year old woman's coming out amen it's like wow that's amazing hallelujah amen they don't have blue hair but but i just tell you you know it's because just because you're old doesn't mean you're dead amen but we need to be dead we need to be old and dead hallelujah but see we are led in this word to stay exactly with what the word says and when i say that i actually mean it read my lips stay exactly with what the word says not your opinion not rich's opinion not so and so to spend but exactly what it says amen but then they come well but brothers i don't care amen stay exactly with what the word says because then you were under the protection of the lord in these last days brother rahm says you are not under the protection just because you agree with this message you're not under the protection just because you believe in signs and wonders and miracles you are not under the protection of god just because you go to the right church this is an individual walk and there's gonna be thousands and tens of thousands of message people will be in hell but you won't because it's a revelation to you amen and you don't want all those people to go to hell you want you your spirit is christ that all should live and that's why you're here to stand in the gap for them amen and amen but you are you can walk around under the protection and the leadership of the holy ghost oh i love it amen it's simple the simple gospel look at what john 14 says 14-15 if you love me keep my commandments amen you know what if you if you can't love your brother you don't love god if you can't love your sister you can't love god i don't care what you say i don't care if your dress is so long it it flies out the back of the pickup when you're driving to church and your hair your you can use it to to raise and lower your husband out the second story window amen or the men they can have just the right look amen but but that doesn't mean anything brother branham was in a meeting and this pentecostal minister comes up and goes brother man i thought you were a pentecostal he goes well brother i am and he goes that woman on the piano she had short hair she had this she had that man tight everything and brother branham just to poke the bear he goes didn't she have a good spirit and and you know that probably threw him all off he goes brother i agree with you she wasn't dressed right her hair was short but he goes brother she's a brand new christian and god has really done something for amen praise the lord jesus amen amen that's leadership that's wisdom of a mature christian amen but if you love me keep my commandments just do what i say amen john 15 and 10 if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love hallelujah that's why the word was restored that's why the revelation of jesus christ coming into plain view fully into plain view so that we could fully and completely live for him amen hallelujah and see here's the leadership of the lord even before all of these events started we didn't know they were coming most amen some people have had dreams i've been told about it and i say praise the lord but even before he started i god was in he was laying on my heart to to just really cast all of my care amen like my parents did cast everything they didn't have insurance we had to go to the you know the cut rate dentist and and i can't blame this on the cut-rate barber but uh we went to all the cheap stuff all the poor people we were poor amen hallelujah but we cast all of our care upon him he fed us amen i didn't miss any meals praise the lord but he was always there amen but god was leading me he was saying he's go back to the reality of what i was when you were young and charities families the same way go back to the provision go back to the love go back to the victory go back to the reality amen and and i will take care of you in that place amen hallelujah and so uh and we're gonna talk about this in a minute but see i was casting already casting amen away the thinking of the world oh you gotta have so much in here and you're and and and i go to retire and you know the stock market goes down to eighteen thousand hasn't been there in a long time but i just kept say praise the lord you're gonna take care of me amen and so i was pulling myself away from everything that seemed reasonable and that's what you have to do in this message pull your mind away from what brother so-and-so says or brother so-and-so says or brother so-and-so says amen hallelujah what would you do if you didn't have the internet you would have to listen to brother paul amen hallelujah and so your pastor is ordained to see you through not brother chad or brother biscuit or brother you plug in the person they're all wonderful people but what i'm saying is that we have to cast away the religiosity that is around this message we have to get into the message which is jesus christ and in him crucified amen hallelujah amen praise the lord that's why i don't have to stand here and have a bunch of quotes because the quote master is within me the quote master is within you amen and so all the current events i'm not looking at that satan i'm not looking at the social security i'm not looking at the retirement i'm not looking at all these things amen hallelujah amen i'm casting all the care of my family upon my husband hallelujah focusing on what god has said and so i gave i've already given my wife and family and finances and our health and the ministry to god it's all his amen and so if you have the right kind of husband he's gonna work and provide for you amen and so i think god's a little bit greater than a natural husband amen and so he has already provided like the song says and so all that a believer has and is is of the lord amen i'm nothing i'm fat and bold and i'm not very smart but but we live on the blessings from the previous generation we are living on the blessings from my parents we're living on the blessings from tom and barb amen charities mom and dad and now we were wanting and desiring to do the right thing and if the lord should tarry then the children will live on the blessings of this amen oh praise the lord you're not only living for you but you're living for others and brother abraham says eternal life is living for others amen is looking heaven in the face amen hallelujah amen that's in the message he said brother you're not successful because you did anything it's because your parents sacrificed amen hallelujah so where is our big brain where are our big muscles nowhere amen and so nothing of the believer is because of you even it's by his grace unmerited favor do you know what brother brown used mercy and grace all the time and we we do that also you know what mercy means it's pity on the miserable that's you and i before god came we were miserable and those who are in misery amen you were having fun you thought out in the world but god's seen you is miserable amen hallelujah and so we know that in first peter 5 6 and 7 it says humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time oh you just get small and he's going to make you big amen amen the bible says and i know that they the prosperity doctrine uses this but this is our term you are not the tale you are the head amen you're not the girlfriend amen but you're the bride amen you get it all hallelujah humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all of your care upon him for he careth for you amen amen and i heard this quote the other day and i put it in here but i know that it's that they have a law here a fire marshal's law just so many you have to leave so much isles and so forth and that they can't and that they cannot help because they because that we are as christians we've got to do that it's a little more restrictive in oregon than here for the bible said jesus told us to give caesar those things that pertain to caesar and then to god those things that belong to god so we try to and if we will not obey caesar it's doubtful that we'd obey god and as long as caesar's lost don't interfere with gods we must obey god first and then these fire hazards and so forth well they know how to take care of that and they told us amen and so imagine if you're a pastor and somebody's blatantly telling you that they go 100 literally 100 miles an hour everywhere or they they talk about the case of wine they have at their house and these are message believers or or this or the slang or the cussing or this but now they're good imagine that imagine imagine what imagine the heartbreak well you said you shouldn't be so judgment we're not the word judge i don't have to say anything it's the word hallelujah and so why is all this happening it's a woe it's to get the bride to shake her a little bit and say hey hey honey amen you're gonna make it amen halle and your failures are just one snapshot in the life of god amen hallelujah praise the lord but see see god is he loves you so much he gives you a little gospel spanking amen which is chastisement he says now get up and go i believe in you amen you may be an acorn but i see you as an oak but see the desire of my heart is to live for god on his terms and if i go to hell doing that then i go to hell that's the way i feel if i go to hell i go to hell amen amen because i want to be able to be emptied out because did you realize that there's no man in the message that has any special revelation [Music] it's all god amen no special revelations nobody because why it's a body ministry hey man this is about you the body not about brother so-and-so amen hallelujah that's that's laodicea amen this is about the lovely one this is about the bride amen this is about you now amen this is about god giving the word through the ministry for you amen hallelujah amen and so i we just want to live emptied out i don't want my own thinking if it comes if it goes against the word amen when when you're diagnosed with something you get on the internet and start uh looking it up brother brown says you are not to do that he goes get off of there he didn't say the internet but he says don't go start reading about it you are glorifying the devil oh brother you know i just don't stick my head in the sand i'm going maybe you should amen because you're glorifying the devil not god amen amen when you're prayed for whether you're at home or up here or wherever it is then throw down those crutches of the devil get up out of that wheelchair of the devil and start walking in the light as he is in the light amen and so i don't really i told some brothers the other day i said i don't care what you think and i was smiling i said absolutely do not care it's too late i've already been a firefighter my skin is that thick now amen i don't care what you think but i love them we're friends but i don't care it doesn't matter what you think it matters what god thinks amen and i don't care what anyone else in the message thinks i know that there's one message one lord one baptism one victory one healing amen and so i don't regard all the other whatever because i want to stay with the word that is his revelation to me not mine i don't care if i'm right i want him to be right amen so here's the deal you don't have to wonder if you're right or not god will confirm it in your life amen you believe god amen don't don't just start looking the devil's going to say oh but you have this mistake you got this mistake oh you did this you did this amen you can come to think and say satan i'm not talking to you and lord i put all that on the altar and i'm going to go forward and and i'm expecting you to take all the desires and turn my heart towards home amen and just walk in there and because those b-17 pilots world war ii this one a little flock started they go oh i'm sorry i'm going home no they stayed with it bouncing around maybe a few scars on the on the b-17 and they went and did the mission and they came home and that's exactly like you you're not promised not to have scars you're not promised to have a smooth fight your promise to be victorious tonight hallelujah god is proving himself tonight amen so the first of the year comes around and charity comes home and says oh the piano teacher she's cutting her fees in half for the girls i was like yeah praise god see to me that's supernatural that is preparation because whether you believe it or not retirement is not as much as you make on the job amen but see i don't care because he provides did you realize that god anointed someone to give us some money for this trip i said praise the lord but so god is preparing the cello teacher decided to retire do something else see that's even more money we're not putting out amen hallelujah and anna she's looking on the internet and watching things and doing her thing but see that's small but to me that's big silas and anna's schooling we haven't had to pay anything yet god has provided everything so far amen that's supernatural amen i know if my sisters listen i'm sorry debbie i know you don't like that word but i'm going to say it anyway hallelujah hallelujah we had a well dug and god supernaturally brought all the funds we had a whole beef that we'd already committed to and god anointed my friend at work he goes you know what i'm only going to charge you three dollars a pound i said what he goes yeah he goes i just been thinking about it and i got off and i said glory i said lord bless him amen hallelujah that's like a cup of water but 600 pounds of it amen hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah see i was even able to give all the liver tongue and heart and and oxtail to brother and sister early because they love it amen hallelujah that's when you like sharon amen praise the lord hallelujah and this trip god anoints somebody to give some money to help amen hallelujah but to me it's god watching out for us amen we're going to have some more here in a minute but the revelation of this day was to reveal what not all that god sent a prophet he didn't it's not the louisville sign we're going uh brother branham said get your eyes off the sign to louisville and get yourself into louisville amen hallelujah that's exactly what we're here for louisville has been revealed amen hallelujah and the personal presence of jesus christ has never left this earth it is still here to do exactly what it says it will do amen and i love to live in the presence of god amen hallelujah and i'm going to tell you living in that presence of god doesn't mean that i'm walking around anointed screaming at the top of my lungs or laying on my face that means that by faith my heart is full of joy and happiness amen that what god's done that's walking in the personal presence of god hallelujah hallelujah if you want to cast out fear it's in that presence amen there is no fear in love because perfect love has cast out all fear there's no there's no confusion in that presence in that little room there is just divine love amen ministering victory and waves of joy he's brother brahm said today oh i wish you could feel this because the whole world is yours amen and i can say that tonight when the holy spirit is in us and living out the word and i'm going to prove it the whole world is yours amen hallelujah hallelujah personal presence casting out fear casting out confusion of the day see after the virus scare got started then god gave me a dream and that's the way he speaks with me and i was i was in perfect temperature i was out fly fishing and i don't fly fish but i just it's david all right amen but it was one of those dreams where i could feel there wasn't any humidity it was warm and no breeze i'm thinking this is awesome and i'm fly fishing i decide i said there's a hole down there i'll cast into it well i got my line caught on the top of this rock and so i went down there and i'm walking you know how you do you're on tippy toes trying to get it off there and i'm coming around and i come to this side of the rock and it's a it's kind of a shallow cave maybe about 10 feet but the rocks are set up to where i could see through the corner and so i got back there and like i said it was so real and here come a lion a big african lion off the hill and it was walking through and i just moved in to that rock and i stayed there and i watched him as he went over here and he went up amen but see god was telling us that he is the cleft of the rock and our safety is in him amen hallelujah praise the lord we don't have time to tell other stories like that but anyway that was for me that was me amen to encourage my faith as a pastor amen i don't want any wolves coming in and taking away sheep and so i have to sit there with with a 30 odd 6 and a scope amen and i and i may shoot them but then i want to pour in the balm of gilead amen hallelujah hallelujah amen glory take them off their feet then they can listen amen hallelujah but see psalm 8 5 and 6. psalm 8 5-6 for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory thou madest him to have dominion over the works of the hands thou hast put all things under his feet all things let's see you are an eternal being amen and everything you see is creation who has control amen absolutely his eternal spirit through you you can speak and go forward you can you can take authority amen all the hotels we've been staying at we take authority over all the spirits amen hallelujah brother branham here's that example these people they said brother branham this morning we got up and we're thinking that you're the messiah he goes oh oh sister he goes nah he goes you know why you think that because there was people in that hotel room the night before who thought that right hallelujah amen and so tonight you here in nampa he has put everything that you can see under your feet hallelujah amen what why do we know that amen we don't know that by denominational thinking we don't know that by partial revelation of the church ages we know that by the full revelation of jesus christ amen even this cross amen brother says the blood is for you even it's primarily for your mistakes amen hallelujah the wife the bride of jesus christ and so we're living in the day of authority brother bam says authority authority authority is the sign of the end speaking and living out through the wife amen and so the natural husband wants to nurture that wife amen paul even says that she's to run the household amen not the way leia decia does it but she's supposed to what what you can't be there with the checklist she's supposed to know what to do she runs a household proverbs 31 woman ran the household amen hallelujah and so authority speaking through you hallelujah see my wife can only manifest and live out my words if she listens to me and if she believes me and then performs them that's how she knows that my words are true and that's how i know that she loves me is because is because for me that's my love language for her to do things uh like that and for her it's snickers amen no but she doesn't need all the big gifts and big rings and everything and but uh but we you know i tell her i love her and i appreciate her and that she's the only one for me see you nurture those things in a natural marriage and it's the same thing with god and so as his wife we are under subjection to his word as we walk in the spirit amen that's why the holy spirit is so important and brother brown says that when we do that then we are little gods on this earth we are god's helpers little gods on this earth amen then that's when you are as righteous as god amen hallelujah you you have no fear amen this will get afraid your spirit realm will be tempted to be afraid but on the inside of the inside there is no fear amen what shall man do unto me what shall man do unto my children amen because something is different in you amen because now amen brother brown says that as you walk around you're giving out virtue literal virtue amen hallelujah amen hallelujah no spirit no subjection and i'm not saying that you won't but just like the disciples they blew it all the time but they were going to receive the holy spirit amen if you took a snapshot of peter cussing and swearing and denying christ and him looking at him amen you would say he is a low life he's nothing but he had the keys to the kingdom amen and so you can't judge on a person's actions amen right now you quit judging your kids like that amen get your eyes off of their their ecstasy or their mollies or whatever or they're dope amen get your eyes off the beer and the alcohol that they're drinking start speaking who they are honey you know what amen i'm ah you're a believer amen you just don't know it yet ali we had some visitors a while back and i was sitting here preaching and some of them teenagers they were like yeah whatever and so i said you know what i was there i know what you're thinking afterwards they shot out of there and would not even come around us because the devil doesn't like to be exposed because when you know who you are then uh oh praise the lord jesus but see i you want to cry out god send the holy ghost after him amen because we love him to death hallelujah no spirit no subjection amen but with the spirit when he the holy spirit comes then you begin to grow into a submissive wife to the word of god i don't have to figure things out i just know that he loves me and so why do you think satan is so much against that supernatural and living presence of god why because that revelation is what vindicates the word it's not your belief in this message it's the revelation of your belief in this message amen that is absolutely that's thus saith the message that's not brother rich that's brother branham amen hallelujah our mental faith and agreement on this message is not the vindication of the word amen the devil believes it mentally he's not your brother but it's the holy spirit in you oh amen just let him work just let him feel you just say lord i want more revelation amen lord i've tried to stop i tried to stop he goes quit trying to stop this quit trying to do this quit trying to do that let me do it amen oh brother one of the brothers at the church he was with my mom and dad way back 50s and 60s very gifted man lots of accurate prophecies amen but an alcoholic his whole life and he called up a while back and said is this rich cobb i said yeah he goes do you still preach the message praise the lord we do come up he goes well i'm coming you know in my natural i'm thinking i don't know what's this gonna be but he walked in and he his nose wasn't red like it used to be and there's a different spirit about him and so he gave a testimony he said i was sitting there in my trailer see god can even save you in a mobile home amen praise the lord hallelujah he said i was sitting there and he goes you know what i've given up he goes god i can't do it he's 86 86. god i just can't do it so i'm not even going to try because i don't want to be a disappointment so god came in that trailer and said how long are you going to be this way he goes are you ready to for me to set you free and i'm paraphrasing because yes not an alcoholic anymore right there hallelujah and so he's coming to church so the devil throws this ailment on him where he can't come he can't drive he can't hardly get out of the house and the doctors don't know what to do they can't do anything and so he asked for prayer from the bride the body and when the body prayed i didn't know about it till like several weeks later but he gave the testimony that that day when the body prayed that thing dried up and he has it no more amen amen no more great men though god still uses people of faith absolutely but it is now the body the elisha ministry a second book of acts is being written amen hallelujah hallelujah amen and so why is it what is it that vindicates your natural marriage well brother we got this ring and we had a nice ceremony that cost forty thousand or sixty some of the guys at work i'm just going are you crazy well i had to get this five carat ring and my old captain his he had different motives but he goes he goes matt he goes i'll do it for 2 000 and you'll have all the beer you want but but the people they you know well we had a good we had this what happens what do i run into over and over and over two years down the line you know what it's not like i thought brother i don't you know i have all this lust going on even though i'm married and and she well i don't like him as much like i used to amen what see the that ceremony is necessary but it doesn't vindicate marriage amen but see what vindicates marriage is that both of you know and you can plug in every definition of no right now you want to each other personally on all levels of intimacy amen i have complete faith in my my wife and she does with me that what we say comes to pass amen and so the message of the hour has come to vindicate the word amen your love and we're going to hit it again so don't worry but the message of the hour has come to vindicate the word being the revelation of jesus christ amen and so and i paraphrase this but you can look it up if you want to but uh people in all different kinds of churches they don't know these things you you are a privileged race you are a super race not because of your color amen but because of your predestination amen and and they don't know these things and so they just hope their sins are forgiven how many people do you know come to church oh god i hope that you love me i hope i'm going to heaven and he goes would you shut up with the hope amen amen as a pastor i want to say get that out of your dictionary amen either he loves you or he doesn't did he take you out of the pit or didn't he amen has he put you on a path to righteousness then let him lead amen hallelujah but they don't know if their sins are all forgiven they're hoping they are healed but the true believer amen you can be the shabbiest the most ignorant or you can be the richest believer there is but you know that you know that you know amen and because the devil's there throwing rocks at you you are this you are that and you go i don't care what you say because my husband has a witness on the inside because what he has already done it right he's already promised the holy spirit he's already healed all your sick he's already saved all your children he's already amen what did the shuna my woman do she's coming on that little donkey she gets off and runs he goes how is the family how is the child how is everything all is well and then she drops down crying oh she said the right thing like hattie right amen brother so-and-so how is it you know brother there's a lot of circumstances but all is well right because i believe i don't know when it's going to happen i don't know when these things are going to manifest but all is well amen hallelujah amen see we still have to fight even though it's all ours we still have to fight for every inch of ground but the ground is yours amen your desire is yours that's why he changes your desires because he wants to put his in there it's yours amen hallelujah my wife a couple months ago was bleeding pretty heavily and she called and and i just started praying and i was like oh please god please please oh god i hope you but please lord please no i said lord jesus i'm a son of god she's a daughter of god and lord god you are the same yesterday today and forever and you are victorious you've already healed her amen and so i satan i rebuke you i curse you in the name of jesus christ and lord i release the holy spirit i release the healing power that says with your stripes and then i then i went outside into the the bay and i started praising god thank you lord thank you lord well what do you think happened amen god dried it up amen hallelujah she was out gardening in the in the garden with flip-flops on don't do that and she some pokeder on her above her big toe and it got infected it was red and angry and hot and so we had our devotions and we prayed for her amen and the next morning i i got up earlier and she i pulled the car back and grabbed her foot and it looked a lot better she goes actually it started getting better that night amen and so amen it doesn't turn around that fast amen infection doesn't turn around that fast amen i've seen it many times it was god that turned around that affection hallelujah was god that did it all amen praise the lord jesus hebrews 4 14 and 16 and we're we're on base going to turn final here in a minute that's why silas isn't here he's building hours towards his commercial certificate but he plans on flying over to caldwell soon for a cross country for that so he might call somebody for lunch i don't know hebrews 4 14 scene then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession that's why god sent a prophet in a message so that we could start talking like a believer amen brother brahma says they just didn't get to talk about get around to talk about the message they got around to live it amen and that's why that's why we do more than talk about the great things that were in his life but we're saying oh brother or sister do you know what god did because of what he showed me uh my my i'm set free or or now the the people at school at work are at the market they're starting to ask questions amen because you're starting to give out right and he says now i'ma skip down to the last let us therefore come boldly he says jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession let us come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need amen hallelujah all right let's look at a bold woman amen queen esther she came boldly into the presence of the king amen why did she do that oh king live forever no she came in king live forever that's boldness because she was humble but she knew see boldness comes by the love that you know god has for you and you come boldly that way to your husband or your wife because you know the love that you have for her amen and so i'll admit it i'm not i know different cultures have their traditions but when you start using that excuse to live with your wife or husband i say that's trash trash amen amen you don't get to do that if you're a believer because when the holy spirit comes what did brother let's just use germans because i'm german and some of us are germans brother brown says this family that lived down the street from the church i'd walked by and i said good morning how are you god bless you and they said this but see he said some of their relatives got saved and you know what that german spirit's gone all of a sudden they're sweet and friendly they still like sauerkraut and and broughton and whatever else and amen they still have their they're proud of their heritage they might even have some lederhosen but you see their spirit has changed amen hallelujah praise the lord one of our brothers from fresno if if you walked up to him and you didn't know it you'd be afraid of him tattoos everywhere but you don't judge him by that you you get around him a little bit and you see that and he was he had some demonic experiences but he's a he's a good man now the holy spirit's doing things amen hallelujah praise the lord and so that's the thing here is that is that and i forgot my thought amen hallelujah but but you see that when we come boldly into his presence it's not by who we are what we've done but we come in by a changed life and so i don't care if you're red brown yellow black and white amen you you when the holy spirit comes it takes over your traditions and it doesn't make you a united states american marriage amen it makes you a marriage of the living god amen hallelujah praise the lord jesus because you wouldn't want a u.s of a marriage amen hallelujah but see god does it all because we come to him humbly but with boldness and that's what queen esther did and he goes i'll give you half of my kingdom well god's already said you got it all yeah amen when you have a need go in there like queen esther hallelujah and it's not that god may help you but he's already helped you he's already healed you he's already given you all the kingdom of god amen but but do we believe that what he said is already done it's already done amen the song is or whatever that is that's why i'm not a song leader amen i just put songs together my wife goes don't do that but he says it's already done i've already done i can't do anything more like brother bram says that jesus christ was here right now oh you go oh man i would believe well he's here amen he's all right you're here he's here right now praise the lord i'm sorry i'm yelling so much but isaiah 54 16 through 55 and 2. behold i've created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument of his work and i have created the waster to destroy amen who is who's allowing this it's the devil that's doing it god is eternal he's allowing the devil to do what he wants him to do he says and i have created the waster to destroy and this is my scripture during this time no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper amen hallelujah and so it's according to your faith amen even if you got that thing hallelujah i'm not going to name it but even if you did you're already healed hallelujah no weapon nothing no spirit no demon formed against the bride will ever prosper amen you can't and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn let him let him just blah blah blah blah amen let the other versions of the message blah blah blah blah blah right amen you love them to death you want to grab them and give them a little noogie amen say come on brother come on sister let's get past that amen but it's just to me it's blah blah blah blah you know what i don't have time if you want to go fishing let's do that amen let's let's do something but none of this amen oh yeah but see it doesn't matter what they think it's a matter what god thinks about you and so this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me it's not that trashy self-righteous stuff amen hallelujah praise the lord i hate it i hate self-righteousness amen well you must be a liberal then brother i'm liberal in the spirit of the lord because he does it all amen so this is the heritage of the servants the lord and their righteous is of me saith the lord ho everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come and buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price what is he saying he goes quit trying to do it give up let me get it for you wherefore do you spend money for that which is not people trying to figure out i i don't listen to brother reagan that much but he said you know what he goes all these years i probably preached on the tribulation twice he goes i don't care i don't care what happens in the tribulation and i'm going glory hallelujah amen he goes i live right here and i'm saying praise the lord hallelujah amen it's what happens here brother branham said we don't have to figure that out what [Applause] that's happens amen here i live now amen praise the lord why do we spend and your labor for that which is not oh you're just i gotta figure out these this equation i gotta do it and you're up to two or three in the morning god goes what are you doing well here it goes hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good what is oh taste and see that the lord our god is good and let your soul delight in the fatness amen i like that word amen i like it because i just brother burly williams he when i went down there a few years ago and brother paul and sister jerry know the same thing he he didn't want to say he wanted to go to the soul food restaurant but he when i said yes he was so happy amen we got in there and it's like you got to have lord and everything amen it's almost like lard and your pop amen lord and everything amen all the vegetables oh you're eating something healthy no it's full of lord amen but it tasted so good oh taste and see that the lord is good amen and let your soul delight in the fatness amen isaiah 53 and 5 but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed present tense he's already done it amen hallelujah day before i was going to retire go in to get my teeth cleaned and they take they always do the x-rays that's a ploy they just want the insurance money hey man if there's any dentist here sorry we need good dentists but she goes the dentist comes and goes oh i'm sorry to say this we're going to pull that out that that tooth that i just charged you over a thousand dollars for oh we got to take that out and i said whoa whoa whoa let's back it up a little bit i said no i'm not going to set any appointment oh i'm just let me think about this thing first well that was the night i would go to portland for the spanish outreach and so i'm on the way up there and i'm thinking you know oh great you know how you think just retiring insurance will run out in 10 days and you know all that stuff and so we get up there and i just feel led to have the brothers lay hands on me and so after the service all actually anybody i said anybody can and so one of them led in prayer and and again god doesn't i my faith is not in that what happened happened my faith is in what god's word says he says if you lay hands on the sick it shall recover but see all of a sudden the little short hairs that i do have i felt that thing coming from this side and they just and you could tell everybody felt it and it's just like man we had ourselves a prayer meeting but god healed me that's my confession amen because i know that he hears my prayers and i know that he hears your prayers even if you don't feel something he's heard your prayers and then a week later i was talking about that and sister marissa she was in the back tending to the kids amen and you know how that goes and she goes yes she goes i could feel it back there amen god it was in the house amen hallelujah and he's here tonight he's in the house amen praise the lord okay we're on final approach and philippians not the philippines but he's there too amen philippians 3 12-16 and i'm just going to read a portion brethren i count not myself to have apprehended and you know what he really that says in the amplified he goes he goes i don't count that i'm finished yet he goes i'm not i'm i'm mature but i'm not done yet i haven't figured out god and we're going paul hasn't figured things out but this one thing i do forgetting those things that are behind you know what tonight i don't care what you did in your past i don't care what you did last week if you put it under the blood god doesn't even remember it amen forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things that are before i press towards the mark amen i don't care about what you were or what what was going through your head i don't care about any of that amen hallelujah i think i testified that of last time i was here something happened and the spirit of depression came up on me that i'm not that way i've never had it i felt like i was exploding for a whole week i couldn't take it amen and so i just kept confessing i kept confessing i didn't get on the on the internet about all the medications and what the signs and symptoms i kept confessing and confessing and confessing and almost we were coming back from i was by myself coming back from portland one night and when i got to salem all of a sudden that spirit started to lift and it's gone and it hasn't come back yet amen and it won't come back amen because i'm healed but i went through that to know how people feel the pastor is the wave sheep he'll have all of the problems before you do amen oh thank you lord we are all healed tonight amen let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded why'd you say that brother because how's tell me someone can say it how's god perfect there's no wrong answer mostly by spirit the spirit of god in him makes him perfect right now as a believer you are perfect and entire wanting nothing that's what the word says hallelujah and that's my mind and if anything he be otherwise minded god shall reveal you need revelation about something pray for god will give it to you amen there's things that i i hate when there's one certain sister not at my church but she comes and asks me these hard questions and when she comes with her bible i'm going oh god let me answer it right this time but most of the time oh no oh i feel stupid amen i i in my mind the devil's going you call yourself a message pastor but i can go find it amen praise the lord but see it's not about me hallelujah let us therefore be perfect and if anything be otherwise minded god shall reveal it unto you nevertheless where to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing you're already victorious so let's say hello victor hello victor oh my name's not victor yeah but in god's presence you are victorious so you're a victor or victoria i don't care amen see humans they always look for what he's going to do and they praise him for what he's done yet the devil wants us to see in the here in the now that god won't answer your prayers he won't do it in your marriage here we're back to it people tend to live for tomorrow oh my wife and i were we're gonna go on this cruise and we're gonna go on this special vacation oh you know it puts a spark back in the relationship and all that amen when it should have never left or they're saying oh have you seen my my pictures of our wedding here let me get the the hand cart damn but see there they live what it was and what it's gonna be but they're ignoring the nurturing of the now amen hallelujah guess what if you nurture for the now it keeps the marriage fresh and as you nurture for the now it you're guaranteed that the future is going to be good you can't do anything positive that god doesn't see that amen god is concerned about we need i was talking to brother woosley and we were saying you know what we need to have a message a camp for the parents amen hallelujah amen because apparently not many message ministers are preaching uh the rubber meets the road stuff amen i i know that the ones that are here and brother ron and them that they do that but but there's a lot that they're good people but they don't see it amen so i want to live for today i want the marriage to be good today hallelujah i want my relationship with god to be good today not you know what god i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna get rid of that whatever and and i'm gonna serve you he's going yeah i've heard that amen but see the future is now the nurturing is now keep your love alive for him with him now amen and so that message of the hour and i promise we're closing has brought christ to the here and now amen i'm not my my dad was melancholy bless his heart and that's the way brother brother halet knows when they say oh bless his heart but see i'm not melancholy that's not me hey let's let's have it now if i'm gonna if i want steak i want it now amen if i want a double whopper with cheese i want it now two of them see if you're gonna eat eat if you if you're gonna like a smorgasbord and eat oh yeah i'm just gonna have a little bit of this salad oh you pathetic thing hey man there is food up on food about the hoot what if you that's why god took us out of denominationalism oh i'm gonna i'm gonna do i'm gonna have a little this and i'm having but no when the message opened up to you you said oh my god look at this there is steak everywhere there is shrimp that is barbecued there is pork fried rice amen there are blizzards every book amen [Applause] that's the way i feel about the word amen it's not oh here let me show you these pictures of how god used to make blizzards let me show you this how god used to do this let me show you how god used to i just went oh come over here brother let me give you a little shaking amen in psalm 46 god is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble therefore we will not fear though the earth be moved though all the crazies are in portland oregon don't judge the state by us by that no one else in oregon believes it agrees with that stuff therefore we will not fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea you're sitting there saying oh look at that isn't that nice amen last night when we were coming from somewhere twin falls that lightning and wind and rain we went right through the middle of it and i'm just this is so cool amen and there's tumbleweeds going across the road and you know you're trying to stay into the wind hallelujah praise the lord there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in the midst of her oh he's here tonight she shall not be moved amen hallelujah god shall help her and that right early the heathen raged amen and the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice and the earth melted amen when you speak the truth hallelujah oh come behold the works of the lord i'm doing it right now what desolations he hath made in this earth he maketh wars disease he's gonna shut the spout off one of these days right now he breaketh the bow he cut out the spear and sender he burns the chariots amen be still tonight and know that i am god i will be exalted in the heat amongst the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is here amen hallelujah and so when we come on his terms tonight amen then we are surrounded by his grace and mercy elijah had to have god open the eyes of gahesai to see all the angels around us amen it says in the bible that the angels are here for you and so when you get up in the morning amen they're there saying oh god she's up amen good he's up praise the lord and he goes okay i'm gonna ride with him to work amen and then i'm gonna be with him at work when he walks in those people are going to say oh wow what is that presence amen and then then i'm going to drive home with them hallelujah amen and amen hallelujah even when you're laying there sick they're just oh praise the lord jesus because they have faith and they're going to raise up they're going to get off that bed of affliction amen praise the lord jesus hallelujah i tell you what plant seed because in persecution when you're hidden in his secret place that's when you're refreshed hey man we we had a woman come in and and i kind of think she was full-on coveted up there she had fever been coughing for three weeks and i just didn't go sister no praise god amen what did she want she wanted prayer so after the service she came up we laid hands on her we cursed that thing god healed him brother chris our interpreter one of his people that he's worked with in the past he was always protecting brother chris from his family because they're they're telling people oh they're jehovah's witness or they're weird you know they do this but george is saying hey just calm down you know i don't see anything wrong with him well he come into service two weeks ago up there and just it was a great service he come up afterwards and i didn't know him i didn't know he's taking notes and reading his bible he goes mister because you know you know he goes mister that's exactly what i needed and i said praise god that's a supernatural act amen so praise the lord i pray that you're encouraged tonight i pray that your faith muscles are gone and you have to get new dresses and and pants amen hallelujah all underneath that wedding gown the devil goes oh there's that pious little person from from from

always get the guys garbage they always seem to put it on your shoulders and i've had more than one fellow cry with me and i'm just one of those supervisors like well let's just keep walking i had one fellow he uh he got really super upset and i could see that so i just said you know come with me let's go for a walk i don't do that i don't talk that's okay just keep walking so you walk with me and he's just one of these fellas and he closes his top he just he literally blows the stop he just starts to hop [Music] dude take a breath it's okay so anyways when it was all said and done he just looked at me give me a big hug and off we went to work well the other day i had this young fellow i had an opportunity to witness to him he's going through a divorce and been too good for him and i just i just started talking to him and i said you know you need to just you need christ you need something you can hold on to someone you can just take your cares and your burdens too and uh and i just kind of left it at that well there's a young man elias he goes to the murphy church and he was braver than i was he just walked up to him one day says you need to come to church with me so since then he's been sitting on the front row and he told me it's been amazing they're just preaching and he said uh it's just me it's me so i had been talking to my boss and uh he goes here i said that yeah he's a young fellow cordell he was one fell i wanted to fire he just wasn't getting it and then he just turned the leaf and all of a sudden he's become my best best fitter and uh so the other day he comes up to me and he just really somber and he says now jason i talked to you i said sure i said come on let's go for a walk so he just starts crying he's sobbing songs he's like i'm worried about
