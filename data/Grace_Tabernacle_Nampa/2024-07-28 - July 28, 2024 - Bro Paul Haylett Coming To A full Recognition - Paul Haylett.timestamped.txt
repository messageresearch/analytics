[36:44] encourage her amen let's turn I want to
[36:47] speak to you today on the thought of
[36:49] coming thank you beautiful song service
[36:52] the the songs actually very much uh
[36:55] corresponded uh with with our thoughts
[36:58] um things bringing us up to this this
[37:00] sermon today and um we uh we just really
[37:06] want to uh look at this thought of
[37:09] coming to a full
[37:11] recognition uh how important it is uh to
[37:15] to come to the full recognition not a
[37:17] partial recognition or not a partial
[37:20] Revelation but the fullness uh of our
[37:24] Lord Jesus Christ and uh how that he uh
[37:28] he has uh given us the word and when he
[37:32] gave us the word now we'll touch on this
[37:34] I don't want to get ahead of myself when
[37:36] he gave us the word we need to recognize
[37:38] just how special that is how how there
[37:42] there is just a a fundamental separation
[37:45] in there that uh uh uh hundreds of
[37:48] millions of people would say we have the
[37:51] word but we want the fullness of the
[37:54] word it's not just uh it's not just that
[37:57] we have a Bible on our Shelf and even as
[38:00] message Believers that we acknowledge
[38:02] that God sent a prophet and the word is
[38:04] being opened in our day but uh you
[38:07] you'll recognize this you can I won't
[38:09] name sermons but you can go right down
[38:11] through a list
[38:13] 1965 uh brother brandham starts to speak
[38:16] mentioning little things that cause us
[38:18] to recognize why he didn't know what was
[38:21] going to happen he knew something was
[38:24] happening he even mentions that you know
[38:27] uh my time here is short now we could
[38:31] all say those words but I believe that
[38:33] God had anointed him to make this
[38:35] declaration the time is short my time to
[38:38] be with you and so now bear with me real
[38:42] quick here before we go in
[38:44] this he left us now you got to have
[38:47] patience with brother Paul here he left
[38:50] us in incomplete
[38:52] message and our Instinct would be say
[38:54] absolutely not
[38:58] but the part that was
[39:00] incomplete was the
[39:02] manifestation in
[39:04] us so the word the prophet didn't leave
[39:07] us an incomplete message to go out and
[39:09] we have to go find
[39:11] something but the incomplete portion was
[39:15] the actual fulfillment or Revelation but
[39:18] now while I'm not saying that every word
[39:20] brother brandham spoke was thus sayith
[39:21] the Lord but when he was just speaking
[39:24] what God put on him to speak
[39:28] literally it was a fulfilled word at the
[39:32] moment it was
[39:34] preached and we're just now coming into
[39:37] the full recognition of what he spoke
[39:40] amen I think it's beautiful because he
[39:43] spoke it it's been waiting for us sir
[39:46] just we look at that and realize that
[39:48] that the Rapture is out here and and we
[39:50] think we're waiting for the Rapture but
[39:52] the Rapture is actually waiting on us
[39:55] amen so it's not something has to happen
[39:58] to bring the Rapture to pass my brother
[40:00] and sister we've got to come into the
[40:02] full recognition and when we come into
[40:05] our fullness of our position amen
[40:08] twinkling of an eye amen amen you know
[40:11] you look at this and see loved ones
[40:14] passing and and we think oh my it's sad
[40:17] but really it's not sad our sister
[40:20] Joanne she come to the fullness of what
[40:22] God had called for her on this Earth
[40:25] amen and and uh we we would see uh all
[40:29] of these things um that that when they
[40:32] come to that fullness my brother and
[40:34] sister anything beyond the
[40:37] fullness is the cycle beginning again
[40:40] the seed has to go back to the Earth
[40:41] that's right and coming back again I
[40:45] thank God for that it's a beautiful
[40:47] thing let's turn in our Bibles this
[40:48] morning to Luke the 10th chapter it's
[40:51] good to see you this morning brother
[40:53] Phil amen had lovely fellowship with you
[40:56] the other day I enjoyed my time amen uh
[41:00] Luke the 10th chapter 23rd and 24th
[41:04] verse um and
[41:14] uh
[41:17] amen Luke
[41:19] 10:23 and he and he turned him andto his
[41:24] disciples and said privately blessed are
[41:26] the eyes eyes which see the things that
[41:29] ye see for I tell you that many prophets
[41:32] and Kings have desired to see those
[41:34] things which ye see and have not seen
[41:38] them and to hear those things which ye
[41:40] hear and have not heard them Heavenly
[41:44] Father we ask you to bless the word
[41:45] today lead us guide us today Father may
[41:48] we go home saying it was good to be in
[41:50] the house of the Lord help us to be
[41:52] concise in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[41:55] you may be seated
[42:09] as we look at this I just want to touch
[42:12] on um just a couple things real quick
[42:15] verse 23 and he turned him into his
[42:19] disciples and made a broad Public
[42:24] Announcement no it was very private
[42:28] it was only known to the
[42:30] disciples and uh he he then shares to
[42:34] them what the religious world would have
[42:37] thought almost was a um uh you
[42:41] know conceited or something point of
[42:44] view a very very you know uh uh I can't
[42:49] think of the word I wanted to think of
[42:50] you know bounced off my head and was
[42:52] gone uh but you know people would say
[42:55] that's almost like an arrogant statement
[42:57] to say look you're the bride of Christ
[42:59] we're Christians also but here is Jesus
[43:01] speaking to the disciples and he gives
[43:04] them a private word that comes and it
[43:07] it's not for the public it's not for the
[43:09] world and I'll tell you how private is
[43:11] it's even today still private to many
[43:14] that many today it's still not a word
[43:17] that they understand or they believe
[43:19] they understand but do not have the
[43:21] fullness of it and he's telling us that
[43:24] many prophets and Kings desired to see
[43:26] what you have in this day and they
[43:29] longed to hear my brother and sister
[43:31] it's not to say they didn't see glimpses
[43:33] of this or there was portions of it that
[43:35] was real to them but the whole picture
[43:38] amen and and it is that the things that
[43:41] we have today uh that we see and they
[43:44] wanted to see and we hear and they
[43:47] wanted to hear it shows us how that we
[43:50] should not take this scripture too
[43:53] lightly the fact that God has blessed us
[43:56] to be able in this day to hear what the
[43:59] prophets and kings of old wanted to hear
[44:01] they wanted to understand and God has
[44:04] given us understanding amen he's opened
[44:07] it to you and I in this day and and I
[44:10] think that sometimes we maybe take this
[44:12] scripture just a little bit too lightly
[44:15] that we say Okay God God's revealed to
[44:17] us he sent a prophet we see these things
[44:20] the the uh uh you might say the
[44:23] organizing of this and what I mean by
[44:25] organizing is that these things have to
[44:28] be set in order in other words God does
[44:29] not dwell in chaos God is very organized
[44:33] amen he just doesn't like organized
[44:35] religion when they try to set the
[44:37] pattern of how it must be they want us
[44:39] to be organized to hear what he has
[44:42] given the ability uh to us to hear and
[44:44] to see what he's given the ability uh
[44:47] for us to see and uh you know this is an
[44:50] incredible gift from God and uh if if
[44:53] we'll look at that you think all through
[44:55] the life that we live uh uh you know uh
[44:59] uh we've received good gifts in our
[45:01] lives all all through the ages sometimes
[45:04] a good gift is a very simple gift it's
[45:06] not elaborate I I just remarked uh uh
[45:10] you know uh to a friend to a brother
[45:12] here some time back about uh just kind
[45:15] of an off-handed statement you give your
[45:17] children too many Christmas gifts and he
[45:20] said oh we just love our children but
[45:22] you know two days after Christmas the
[45:24] toys are all strewn around the yard and
[45:27] their sons over there in the corner of
[45:29] the yard with a stick digging a hole and
[45:31] so sometimes it is that we think we're
[45:35] giving a good gift but really there
[45:37] would be a better gift amen and
[45:39] certainly listening to the prophet uh
[45:43] this uh last few days here you know and
[45:46] he's he's talking about how that these
[45:49] things that we have received from God
[45:52] these things that were gifts that God
[45:54] has given to us let us not look at them
[45:57] lightly let us not just sit back and let
[46:00] them become common to us because these
[46:02] are great gifts these are gifts whether
[46:05] we are rich or poor whether we are smart
[46:08] or we're just average whether we're
[46:10] good-looking or we are not none of that
[46:12] matters this gift surpasses every gift
[46:15] on the face of the Earth today amen and
[46:19] this good gift is such an incredible
[46:21] gift has come from God and it's
[46:24] specifically tailored to you amen now we
[46:27] can say I hear the same scripture I hear
[46:30] the same songs I I was in the same
[46:32] service but God dealing with you God
[46:35] speaking to you you'll walk out now I'm
[46:38] just assuming that each one of us came
[46:40] Desiring to hear from God today and come
[46:43] prepared amen we come with prayer we
[46:45] come with reading of scripture and we're
[46:48] here today because we wanted to hear
[46:50] from God we're not checking off the box
[46:52] I went to church on Sunday but when we
[46:55] come in here as we walk out today God
[46:58] will have spoken to you now see this
[47:01] gets to be very Broad and generic God
[47:03] has spoken to you exactly what you
[47:06] needed now you have to decide who you is
[47:10] amen amen when you were here if God has
[47:13] dealt with you and realized that was
[47:15] specifically tailored for you for your
[47:18] need because you see one the preacher
[47:20] don't know what your need is and two
[47:23] your needs are so uh diverse that
[47:26] there's no way that one simple thought
[47:28] by man could come and touch each life
[47:31] can someone agree with that and so we
[47:33] see how that God would come and he gives
[47:37] this great gift very specifically
[47:40] tailored to you and I now I'm still
[47:43] amazed uh you know uh a brother shared a
[47:46] testimony uh with me here recently and
[47:49] my brother and sister it's amazing how
[47:53] that when you could just give a simple
[47:55] testimony of what God has done in your
[47:57] life a simple testimony how the word of
[48:00] God has changed your life and you know
[48:03] there's come so many rejections so many
[48:06] times that people just kind of turn that
[48:08] off but I'm telling you my brother and
[48:10] sister the seed knows exactly where the
[48:14] seed is at amen and so the seed being
[48:17] placed in the heart of Sons and
[48:19] Daughters of God I love how God actually
[48:22] camouflaged that because if it was not
[48:24] camouflag Satan would come and do
[48:27] everything outright he could to destroy
[48:30] that life but you know once the seed
[48:33] germinates and the root is settled into
[48:36] the soil amen it's much harder to kill
[48:40] the birds can't pick it up amen the wind
[48:43] can blow but if in the right soil amen
[48:47] you know just a little farmer note you
[48:49] plant and farm in sand amen sand will
[48:52] grow beautiful crops but the hardest
[48:55] thing you have in sand is keeping the
[48:57] plant fed because sand does not
[49:00] hold and getting it to grow in the
[49:03] spring without the wind blowing the sand
[49:05] to cut it
[49:07] off so you'll find that Satan once he
[49:11] recognizes there's something there will
[49:13] do everything but when that plant is
[49:16] rooted
[49:17] down when it is when it is already got
[49:20] life
[49:22] expressed amen much harder for Satan but
[49:25] I tell you when never you find
[49:27] testimonies of men coming from prison
[49:29] there for
[49:30] murder and the seed comes to them in the
[49:33] form of a book in a prison
[49:35] Library you see people that have been in
[49:38] all kinds of circumstances man being
[49:41] testified of his own life of how he was
[49:44] sitting in a bar stool had walked away
[49:46] from the message of the hour as he
[49:48] acknowledged it I walked away from God
[49:50] and I'm sitting there on a bar stool and
[49:53] somebody blasting and he it's what he
[49:55] believed somebody saying well that
[49:57] church over there them branom mites and
[49:59] he got up indignant stood right there
[50:01] boldly in their face and said that's the
[50:03] word that's the truth that's it and they
[50:06] said well why aren't you there and he
[50:07] said it's not that it's
[50:09] me and the next Sunday he went to church
[50:12] and continued to go to church cuz his
[50:15] own words said it's not the
[50:18] message it's me that's
[50:21] it that's it and he recognized all these
[50:24] years that I walked away it was wasn't
[50:27] the word of God that's exactly it was
[50:31] me you see God will use that he knows
[50:33] how to deal with us
[50:36] amen and we look in Hebrews 11th chapter
[50:39] the 39th and 40th verses
[50:43] here and we know Hebrews as a faith
[50:46] chapter and when you would look at that
[50:49] Amen brother Phil and I was just talking
[50:52] about this touched on this you know you
[50:54] look down through here and you see the
[50:56] mistakes and the problems that have have
[50:59] been in the lives of the Patriarchs and
[51:01] all those of old the scripture says the
[51:04] Renown these men that stood and we look
[51:07] at today if you scrutinize their lives
[51:11] uh very critically you you would say
[51:13] this there's something missing in the
[51:15] scripture when it says that these were
[51:17] great men of faith that these were great
[51:19] warriors these are the outstanding David
[51:22] an apple of God's eyes start listing
[51:24] David's faults and and there's no way in
[51:27] a human element you can come to a
[51:29] conclusion that he would be the apple of
[51:31] God's eye but you see God wasn't looking
[51:34] at David through his circumstance he was
[51:36] looking at him through the prophesied or
[51:39] spoken word and and the spoken word he
[51:42] was the apple of God's eye amen and the
[51:45] spoken word no matter what our
[51:47] circumstance today has declared us the
[51:50] beautiful virgin bride of Jesus Christ
[51:53] it doesn't matter the circumstance of
[51:55] our life it's what the word said we were
[51:58] amen and the word is there you know it
[52:01] is
[52:02] unmovable you know the word just simply
[52:04] won't move amen heavens and earth that's
[52:07] right heavens and earth are going to go
[52:08] away but God's word will never go away
[52:11] it's
[52:12] immovable it's the very pin that holds
[52:15] the
[52:16] universe and we see here he said and
[52:19] these all having obtained a good report
[52:22] through faith that's right amen that's
[52:26] it obtained through faith but they don't
[52:29] have a promise it never come to pass the
[52:32] promise for them now we could sit here
[52:35] today and you can look at your flesh and
[52:38] you can say but I did this and I did
[52:40] that go back come on put your name in
[52:42] Hebrews 11 and find that you are a hero
[52:46] of Faith whether you think you are or
[52:48] not because God said I'm looking at the
[52:51] finished work and the finished work is
[52:55] God's word
[52:57] not man's word God's word and God having
[53:01] provided now I hope you catch this is
[53:03] kind of hides in the scripture without
[53:06] us really focusing on
[53:08] it see I I wanted to do more but we're
[53:11] going to be long enough as it is and
[53:14] these all the these Saints having
[53:17] obtained good report through faith
[53:18] received not the promise God having
[53:21] provided some better thing for us amen
[53:26] we've been given something better than
[53:28] every one of the Saints listed in Hebrew
[53:31] 11 it's hard it sounds almost bful they
[53:35] they were these great people but I'm
[53:37] telling you when the book is finished
[53:39] and time has come and it's going to be
[53:41] there they're going to say are you she
[53:43] amen uh the leontin had wrote a song
[53:46] about that and it's very touching when
[53:48] you think about it they're going to say
[53:50] are you the ones that come through Le
[53:53] OA the greatest time of Revelation the
[53:56] greatest time of overcoming power the
[53:58] greatest challenges of the age and you
[54:02] are them and all we can say is we were
[54:06] provided are you with me we were
[54:08] provided something better than other
[54:12] ages and that was the fullness of the
[54:15] word it was the complete word had come
[54:18] out and in that word every nutrient that
[54:21] we needed spiritually was given to us to
[54:25] take it and Satan tried to beat you out
[54:27] Satan's trying to run you and and give
[54:29] you tired and fatigued and and you know
[54:32] what we do when we're fatigued we we
[54:34] have unra thinking it's perfectly
[54:38] thinking at the moment but it's
[54:44] unrationed something better amen it
[54:48] wasn't what we did it wasn't what we had
[54:51] or figured out but it was provided for
[54:54] us it was placed on the table for us in
[54:58] front of us in the presence of our
[55:02] enemies oh how precious that is that God
[55:05] didn't say I'm going to have to take you
[55:06] to a Wilderness and hide you from
[55:11] this I'm going to put it on the table in
[55:13] the presence of your enemies amen right
[55:17] in the middle of leod DEA I'm going to
[55:19] feed you and provide you and give to you
[55:22] what it takes to overcome in this day
[55:25] that they with without us should not be
[55:27] made perfect and they want to be
[55:30] perfect so you've got a whole you say
[55:33] well I I don't even have a friend I'll
[55:35] guarantee you on the other side you got
[55:36] some friends you don't think you have a
[55:39] friend here in Leo to see on the other
[55:40] side there's some people rooting for you
[55:43] saying come on Brother come on sister
[55:46] fulfill this word come on home because
[55:49] we cannot be made perfect without you
[55:53] and we can take that back and speak it
[55:55] to our lord Jesus
[55:56] Lord we cannot be made perfect without
[56:00] you you see how that that figure eight
[56:03] continuous comes there's no beginning
[56:06] there's no ending there's no spot that
[56:08] we come and say oh we're just done we
[56:10] have everything we need no my brother
[56:12] and sister God has a Synergy that is in
[56:15] his word that keeps us moving and keeps
[56:18] us fulfilling the word of God amen amen
[56:21] now in the church age amen we see here
[56:26] uh leodan Church age brother Brandon
[56:29] puts it this way in the
[56:31] writings he is the true witness now this
[56:34] word true is the same word we saw back
[56:38] in Revelation 3:7 you recall that it
[56:41] does not mean true as in contrast with
[56:45] false see this is something that's
[56:48] taking place with you and I right now
[56:50] this is the word being preached the word
[56:53] by the foolishness of preaching bringing
[56:55] us to to a place that we come into an
[56:59] understanding of this amen it has a
[57:02] richer deeper meaning by far it
[57:05] expresses perfect realization in
[57:08] contrast to par uh partial realization
[57:13] amen now when the word of God first
[57:16] spoke to your life you heard the message
[57:19] you read the message however it came to
[57:22] you and there was there was something
[57:24] that caught your attention and you
[57:26] realize this is true and I'm not being
[57:29] critical of any other Church religion
[57:32] Place time whatever but my brother and
[57:35] sister if truth was out there they
[57:38] wouldn't look like they look that's
[57:40] right they wouldn't act like they act
[57:42] amen they would have a whole different
[57:44] Outlook towards the
[57:47] Bible I was just listening to a man's
[57:50] little oratory on
[57:53] music and he says you know he finds it
[57:58] troubling We Now call it gospel music in
[58:02] the name of Jesus
[58:03] Christ and the attributes of his names
[58:07] many times are not even mentioned he
[58:09] said they could be singing to the devil
[58:12] and you wouldn't know the
[58:15] difference now I'm not here to tell you
[58:17] what kind of music you're listening to
[58:19] but I would like for you to judge it
[58:21] yourself you could take a lot of this
[58:24] music and you could l literally just go
[58:27] over and sing it and the devil would be
[58:28] happy to hear your
[58:30] praise you see we have to be careful
[58:32] because the twins are the so close to
[58:35] deceive is right here amongst us I I
[58:38] don't necessarily mean that right here
[58:39] in the church but I'm talking about in
[58:42] the world we live in it is so close yes
[58:44] sir and so people go they gather they
[58:47] they sing they're all of that and
[58:50] they'll be shocked to find out my
[58:51] brother and sister see this actually
[58:53] happened in nah that they were there and
[58:56] and they were they were enjoining
[58:59] themselves with these others and didn't
[59:02] realize as they thought they from their
[59:04] heart were praising God did not realize
[59:07] that they were praising all of these um
[59:12] Pagan
[59:14] interfused into Christianity right not a
[59:19] separation trying to amalgamate it
[59:24] together and God says it makes me
[59:31] sick that's why it struck me in the song
[59:33] there see we don't want it to be someday
[59:36] that he says well done we want to hear
[59:39] well done every day we want our life and
[59:43] if it isn't well done we have the
[59:45] solution Amen to to amend for that amen
[59:50] back in the Philadelphian age the coming
[59:52] of the Lord was drawing
[59:53] nigh what great love that age manifested
[59:56] for him it reminds me those beautiful
[59:58] words of 1 peter: 18 whom having not
[1:00:02] seen ye love and whom though now you see
[1:00:05] him not yet believing you rejoice with
[1:00:09] joy unspeakable and full of glory and
[1:00:11] with them we Rejoice also we haven't
[1:00:13] seen him but we have felt him can we say
[1:00:18] Amen to
[1:00:19] that we you can't say oh I saw the
[1:00:23] Lord but you felt it
[1:00:29] and this is just drawn out so please
[1:00:31] don't judge me just for this short term
[1:00:33] of it but you have seen the Lord that's
[1:00:35] exactly
[1:00:37] right you saw his manifestation in Sons
[1:00:40] and
[1:00:41] Daughters you saw his life you've saw
[1:00:45] him in our
[1:00:48] presence and that's really only a
[1:00:50] partial realization of what it will be
[1:00:53] like to see him face to face
[1:00:56] amen but we have come in his presence
[1:01:02] amen with him we Rejoice also oh let me
[1:01:05] back up a little further having seen
[1:01:08] with joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:01:09] with them we Rejoice also we haven't
[1:01:12] seen him we have felt him we know him
[1:01:14] now as much as our limiting senses can L
[1:01:18] us but one day it will be face to face
[1:01:21] that is for this age he is coming at the
[1:01:24] end of this age
[1:01:26] partial realization will be made perfect
[1:01:30] realization completed realization
[1:01:33] Hallelujah we have been looking through
[1:01:35] a glass Darkly but soon it will be face
[1:01:38] to face we have been going from glory to
[1:01:40] glory but it will soon be right in the
[1:01:43] glory and in his glory will shine we
[1:01:46] shall be like him wondrously like him
[1:01:49] Jesus our savior Divine isn't that
[1:01:51] wonderful is what the prophet says there
[1:01:53] but I want to say to you isn't that
[1:01:56] wonderful amen the very thing that has
[1:01:58] drawn us from the very beginning the
[1:02:01] very fact that he loved us so much and
[1:02:03] we have been made in His image and
[1:02:05] there's nothing more true of being made
[1:02:08] in His image than the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:10] Christ amen the real believer is the
[1:02:14] absolute ultimate of being made in His
[1:02:17] image amen we're not talking about just
[1:02:19] Humanity but we're talking about Sons
[1:02:21] and Daughters of God made in that image
[1:02:24] which is the word
[1:02:26] amen do you realize that Christ stood
[1:02:28] here on the earth as the word we can see
[1:02:32] his faal facial features as it what of
[1:02:35] Jesus Christ but the molding that we
[1:02:38] really want to be like would not to be
[1:02:40] like him in sandals and robes you know
[1:02:43] there's been movements through the years
[1:02:44] of people we want to be like Jesus they
[1:02:47] let their hair grow and they got a beard
[1:02:49] and they're wearing uh robes and wearing
[1:02:52] sandals everywhere they go and they're
[1:02:54] saying we're being like Jesus but my
[1:02:56] brother and sister he was the word amen
[1:02:59] and when we want to be like Jesus that
[1:03:01] means we need to be molded into this
[1:03:03] image right here not a long-haired man
[1:03:06] with a beard wearing a robe walking down
[1:03:08] the road amen hungry and cold that part
[1:03:12] of being like him they don't want to
[1:03:13] deal with and they neither want to be
[1:03:16] like him on fire they just want to be
[1:03:20] right in the middle they can go either
[1:03:22] way it just depends on what the day is
[1:03:25] right the
[1:03:27] circumstance
[1:03:30] amen we are complete in him that is true
[1:03:34] he would not lie to us about that but
[1:03:36] one day we will be changed in the atoms
[1:03:40] amen oh I tell you what my brother and
[1:03:42] sister you know science has done their
[1:03:44] very best the Medical Science has done
[1:03:47] their very best to document the healing
[1:03:53] process and when you think about this
[1:03:55] it's it's
[1:03:57] incredible you see some cells when you
[1:04:00] are
[1:04:02] injured blood
[1:04:04] cell flesh
[1:04:06] cell the blood cell comes
[1:04:09] out flows
[1:04:13] away the flesh cell is there saying wow
[1:04:19] I've been
[1:04:22] hurt but there are certain blood cells
[1:04:24] that say enough of this
[1:04:27] bleeding I'm going to bind myself
[1:04:29] together brother I'm going to bind
[1:04:33] myself with you brother I'm going to
[1:04:35] bind myself with you brother we're going
[1:04:38] to stop the bleeding and your blood
[1:04:40] starts to coagulate and it creates that
[1:04:43] that stops that flow and then there are
[1:04:45] cells that just sat there and brother
[1:04:46] brandham teaches us how that cancer
[1:04:49] often times comes in from a bruised cell
[1:04:52] now let's just take that away from the
[1:04:53] carnal flesh World some times I want to
[1:04:56] ask you come on we can be honest have
[1:04:58] you been bruised absolutely amen what is
[1:05:01] that Satan's attempt to cause a cancer
[1:05:04] of unbelief to come into you that you
[1:05:07] would say I don't think this is true I I
[1:05:09] don't know that it's even worth praying
[1:05:11] I don't know whether it's worth trusting
[1:05:13] because I've been hurt and I am bruised
[1:05:16] but I'll tell you what there's some
[1:05:18] cells in that body that said yes we have
[1:05:21] been injured we have been bruised but I
[1:05:23] tell you what we're going to do we're
[1:05:24] going to work our way back to the
[1:05:26] original and I tell you my brother and
[1:05:28] sister I've got a few spots on my body I
[1:05:30] won't go into it but I've cut the ends
[1:05:32] of fingers off I've done things and
[1:05:35] amazing grace of God there's sales there
[1:05:38] that knew what should be there and have
[1:05:42] recreated themselves Amen to be that and
[1:05:45] I sat here today with a thumb that's got
[1:05:48] an end when I have cut it off Plum back
[1:05:50] inside the fingernail amen but God said
[1:05:53] I know what belongs there and I'm going
[1:05:55] to send the right cell the right life
[1:05:58] the right healing virtue to put you back
[1:06:01] where you belong to make you whole in Le
[1:06:04] oia to make you whole in a world that
[1:06:07] could care less about your condition
[1:06:10] they just want to fulfill what they want
[1:06:12] to fulfill but Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:15] know where they belong and every cell
[1:06:18] ordained of God to come and put it back
[1:06:21] in its right order only reason we have
[1:06:24] bitterness is and things that Linger on
[1:06:26] through years of our life is because we
[1:06:29] refuse to let God come back and heal it
[1:06:33] refuse to bind oursel cell to cell and
[1:06:37] let God heal that amen we're complete in
[1:06:41] him that is true he would not lie to us
[1:06:43] one day we'll be changed in the atoms we
[1:06:46] will put on immortality we will be
[1:06:48] swallowed up in life then we
[1:06:52] will realize
[1:06:59] oh my you know I'm starting to feel
[1:07:04] old I'm not as old as say Brother David
[1:07:07] would be and I mean that politely just
[1:07:09] talking about age brother
[1:07:10] Phil I'm starting to feel it though I
[1:07:13] climb a flight of stairs and legs that
[1:07:16] used to just be full of Vitality and
[1:07:18] just Propel me up there say uh I know
[1:07:21] it's only a few more steps but you could
[1:07:23] stop and consider resting
[1:07:29] that's but we don't have time to
[1:07:32] rest the only rest we're called to is in
[1:07:34] our Lord Jesus Christ no pause I'll just
[1:07:38] pause my
[1:07:39] life and I'll resume it in some later
[1:07:42] date but God wants us even when we're
[1:07:46] weary might be weary in
[1:07:48] spirit might be weary in
[1:07:51] mind the heart might feel
[1:07:53] weary but God wants us just keep
[1:07:58] going don't stop
[1:08:00] now the
[1:08:03] Finish is
[1:08:06] close then we will realize
[1:08:10] realization now you see what's happening
[1:08:13] is is God's bringing us to a full
[1:08:15] recognition right exactly we're starting
[1:08:17] to have a realization that it's not how
[1:08:19] much of this Bible I can quote
[1:08:22] verbatim but it's how much of this Bible
[1:08:24] I can live verbatim
[1:08:26] amen because that's the that's the
[1:08:29] growth that God's looking
[1:08:31] for is to be like him amen now as I said
[1:08:36] earlier and now we'll just touch on this
[1:08:39] the word says that the
[1:08:41] scripture is of no private
[1:08:43] interpretation that's right and I'm glad
[1:08:46] of that because that would all depend on
[1:08:48] who had the pulpit it's whose
[1:08:52] interpretation well I'm the preacher
[1:08:54] today or I'm the pastor of of the church
[1:08:56] and this is what I say the word means
[1:08:58] you imagine the confusion you would have
[1:09:01] let's take the message of the hour that
[1:09:03] we have it in in booklet and uh uh audio
[1:09:08] and and some uh you know um film Etc and
[1:09:13] imagine now if every church that
[1:09:16] embraced the message interpreted it
[1:09:18] different and then we all come together
[1:09:20] for a special
[1:09:21] meeting
[1:09:23] h i mean it be like take him from the
[1:09:27] pulpit none of us agree with him next
[1:09:29] man gets up take him from the pulpit we
[1:09:31] don't agree with him you would go
[1:09:33] through the list of every Minister
[1:09:35] because everyone would have their own
[1:09:37] little
[1:09:39] view
[1:09:42] right I hope this little analogy would
[1:09:45] strike with you so a few days ago in the
[1:09:47] other house on the other side of the
[1:09:49] road there I was mowing the
[1:09:51] backyard and or going to mow the
[1:09:53] backyard and um there was a dough
[1:09:56] standing there in the yard and uh I
[1:10:00] wasn't very far away from her
[1:10:02] maybe less than here to the pews in the
[1:10:05] back and in my mind I remember watching
[1:10:08] a video Once where a guy didn't realize
[1:10:10] that a dough had a fawn there and the
[1:10:13] dough attacked him and just beat the tar
[1:10:16] out of this poor guy beat him right down
[1:10:18] to the
[1:10:19] ground and that little video replayed
[1:10:23] it's like I can see see her saying to
[1:10:26] herself if that human comes just one
[1:10:29] more
[1:10:31] step but I stopped and respected the
[1:10:33] space I didn't say a word anything and
[1:10:36] she was nervous at first and then she
[1:10:38] just calmed down and her tail come back
[1:10:40] up and her ears came up and she's
[1:10:42] looking at
[1:10:43] me and I didn't step towards her I
[1:10:46] stepped sideways and then she moved and
[1:10:48] went went out the gate and was gone into
[1:10:49] the
[1:10:51] cornfield well I go back the next day to
[1:10:54] mow the lawn
[1:10:56] and I'm mowing along the out perimeter
[1:10:58] of the lawn and um let's just say uh
[1:11:02] lawn care and Landscaping are not one of
[1:11:05] my
[1:11:07] um um yeah
[1:11:12] yeah you know I used to joke with sister
[1:11:15] Jerry that grass was to keep the weeds
[1:11:17] from growing and uh then after you mow
[1:11:21] grass for years you realize the grass is
[1:11:23] a
[1:11:24] weed but but you don't want the other
[1:11:26] kind of weeds and I'm mowing along on
[1:11:28] the lawn
[1:11:29] mower and just right out the corner of
[1:11:32] my eye there's a little Flicker and I'm
[1:11:35] like what's that and
[1:11:36] I and and I actually have a picture of
[1:11:39] it on my phone if any of you love to see
[1:11:42] it and right here in just this little
[1:11:45] narrow band that's kind of growed up
[1:11:47] with some
[1:11:48] weeds is this Little Fawn it's so
[1:11:52] tiny and so beautiful
[1:11:57] and it's laying there and what I saw was
[1:11:59] a flicker of its ear now I'm standing
[1:12:02] this far from it it's looking straight
[1:12:05] ahead you can't even see it breathe it's
[1:12:09] just laying
[1:12:11] there and I thought I don't want to
[1:12:13] disturb the little guy I got on the
[1:12:16] lawnmower but I went by it you know I I
[1:12:18] the way I'm over the yard you know went
[1:12:20] by it like five times things just
[1:12:23] looking straight ahead
[1:12:26] doesn't
[1:12:27] BR and I thought isn't that
[1:12:30] something we get a
[1:12:33] choice to either follow our Instinct and
[1:12:37] not
[1:12:41] run trust that's it not flee that's
[1:12:46] it
[1:12:49] rest now fear
[1:12:52] paralyzes but this little deer laying
[1:12:56] there I don't know that you can blink
[1:12:59] that slow I stood there after I got
[1:13:02] quite a bit of the lawn mode I took the
[1:13:04] little
[1:13:05] picture and it was
[1:13:13] blinking and I struck me I thought
[1:13:17] Lauren we got a lot to fear out here
[1:13:22] right people are like I don't fear the
[1:13:24] devil
[1:13:26] but the stop and think about it in
[1:13:28] natural
[1:13:29] element there's a lot to be afraid of
[1:13:32] out
[1:13:33] here and we in here have a
[1:13:37] choice we can rest in the peace knowing
[1:13:41] who we are that
[1:13:44] Mama you know they figured this language
[1:13:47] out that Mama told that baby you rest
[1:13:50] right there all the
[1:13:52] back so we either choose to rest
[1:13:56] or we flee and where would the little
[1:13:57] guy flee he couldn't jump the
[1:14:02] fence he couldn't run fast enough the
[1:14:04] wolf would get
[1:14:08] him I got done mowing the lawn and I
[1:14:10] come to put the aration back on and and
[1:14:12] start it and I wanted to rearrange it so
[1:14:14] he wouldn't get sprinkled and get all
[1:14:17] wet and I walked up there just close
[1:14:20] enough to look and the little guy's eyes
[1:14:22] were closed his legs were out there and
[1:14:24] his head was
[1:14:27] down and I thought you know
[1:14:30] what I think he had an instinct to
[1:14:34] know there never
[1:14:36] was never was anything going to get
[1:14:39] him he understood
[1:14:42] that now you
[1:14:46] see the scriptures have no private
[1:14:49] interpretation but it's been privately
[1:14:51] interpreted that's why we have nazarin
[1:14:54] and Baptist and Methodist and all these
[1:14:57] all these other
[1:14:59] things now I had a man one time he says
[1:15:02] well you guys what you believe is an
[1:15:04] interpretation of the Bible and you know
[1:15:07] it's amazing if you just trust God me
[1:15:09] instant in season out of season trust
[1:15:11] God and I told him sir I know you won't
[1:15:13] agree but it is not an interpretation of
[1:15:16] the Bible what we believe is the Bible
[1:15:18] amen amen not an interpretated form of
[1:15:21] it but it is the Bible and this is what
[1:15:24] the problem is is because it was
[1:15:26] interpreted and they missed the mark
[1:15:29] they didn't touch it but I tell you the
[1:15:31] word this this private interpretation
[1:15:34] the revelation of the word is very
[1:15:37] private amen it is not not a private
[1:15:41] interpretation but it's very private
[1:15:43] because as Jesus was speaking to them he
[1:15:46] turned to them and he didn't announce it
[1:15:49] to the world he spoke to them as
[1:15:52] individuals and told them exactly they
[1:15:55] stood and who they were and so it was at
[1:15:59] the discretion of God Amen totally at
[1:16:02] the discretion of God who would receive
[1:16:05] the understanding or interpretation of
[1:16:07] the word he said I didn't give it to a
[1:16:10] man to interpreted when you will listen
[1:16:12] to The Prophet speaking of the seals he
[1:16:15] will tell you I was been awake every
[1:16:18] single night and God dealing with me and
[1:16:21] and where I don't remember exactly where
[1:16:23] that's at if it is right there in the
[1:16:25] Seal's book but he says and the Lord
[1:16:27] corrected
[1:16:29] me so it wasn't his interpretation he
[1:16:33] thought right a perfect example is the
[1:16:35] the White Horse and all of these things
[1:16:37] he he he thought oh this is what this is
[1:16:41] and then he comes along and says no the
[1:16:43] Lord corrected me amen so it wasn't
[1:16:46] brother bram's correction or
[1:16:48] understanding it was the Holy Spirit
[1:16:50] correcting that and so that the word
[1:16:53] will always correct the amen and so I
[1:16:56] think we all of us today should lift our
[1:16:58] hand and say Lord if there is any air
[1:17:01] correct it amen I want every air in my
[1:17:04] life corrected Lord amen amen so we look
[1:17:07] at this now John wanted to
[1:17:10] know if if Jesus was the Christ he sent
[1:17:13] some disciples over there to talk to
[1:17:15] Jesus now uh should we should are you
[1:17:18] him or should we look for another one so
[1:17:22] John is is coming to a place brother
[1:17:24] brandham puts it out this way his Eagle
[1:17:26] Eye got filmed over now my brother and
[1:17:29] sister if he his Eagle Eye got filmed
[1:17:32] over our Eagle Eye can get filmed over
[1:17:36] amen we can't just say I saw that God
[1:17:38] sent a prophet and it'll just be uh
[1:17:40] everything will be perfect no overtime
[1:17:42] little things in our life come on you
[1:17:44] know each one of us has that little
[1:17:46] thing the scripture calls it a besetting
[1:17:48] sin and that besetting sin is not being
[1:17:51] a drunk or a dancer or something
[1:17:53] sometimes it's a little something in our
[1:17:55] life that just limits us enough from
[1:17:58] taking full Hal of the promise and that
[1:18:01] becomes a besetting sin CU we'll not go
[1:18:03] no further amen right amen we can't get
[1:18:07] beyond that
[1:18:09] amen
[1:18:11] amen Satan's
[1:18:14] tactic is we can come to a place saints
[1:18:17] that we don't even recognize the
[1:18:19] supernatural in our midst that's it
[1:18:22] that's got to be from an Eagle Eye being
[1:18:24] filmed up over God said he would be here
[1:18:27] and we bring our lick of fire into the
[1:18:29] house of God and we don't recognize it
[1:18:33] we don't see
[1:18:34] it because our eye is filming
[1:18:37] over amen we don't recognize The
[1:18:40] Supernaturals right here in our midst
[1:18:42] but I tell you what there's precious
[1:18:46] glorious beautiful reminders coming from
[1:18:48] the Throne of God just as Jesus he
[1:18:51] speaks of that he don't rebuke them
[1:18:53] disciples but he used very strong words
[1:18:55] there's you got to understand there's
[1:18:57] kind of a difference there or at least
[1:18:58] I'm I'm putting a a line in there this
[1:19:01] difference he didn't say you bunch of
[1:19:02] unbeliev and no good guys you go back
[1:19:04] and tell John while the power of God was
[1:19:06] working on him he had Revelation but he
[1:19:08] has no Revelation now no what he did is
[1:19:10] he told them look this is what's
[1:19:12] happening I'm going to just paraphrase
[1:19:13] it the blind are being healed their
[1:19:15] souls being delivered their souls being
[1:19:18] saved and there's Supernatural taking
[1:19:21] place go back and tell Jonah about that
[1:19:24] oh my brother and sister if they' have
[1:19:26] showed up and and uh got there and said
[1:19:28] well Jesus
[1:19:30] said and they told him a different story
[1:19:32] it wouldn't have helped their
[1:19:34] interpretation right but I believe they
[1:19:37] were men faithful that took Jesus's word
[1:19:40] and carried it word by word and took it
[1:19:43] back to John and John would have found a
[1:19:45] spark in his soul that reassured him
[1:19:48] this is the Christ I knew it was but I
[1:19:51] needed my remembrance my memory to be
[1:19:54] stirred that I was called by God in that
[1:19:57] 20th and 21st century I need to remember
[1:19:59] that the God sent a prophet to me and
[1:20:03] I'm here to receive this word I don't
[1:20:05] care what they say about this being off
[1:20:07] and that being off because their life
[1:20:10] doesn't represent truth either amen so
[1:20:12] they're trying to bring you to them to
[1:20:15] their level and their level doesn't even
[1:20:17] come close to the word and it's there
[1:20:19] but my brother and sister it won't be
[1:20:21] brother brandom that saves you and I it
[1:20:24] is the message of the word when Jesus
[1:20:27] said the blind eyes are being open deaf
[1:20:29] ears are hearing it is the word for the
[1:20:33] hour it will be our recognition that we
[1:20:36] were called to this message we were
[1:20:38] called to this life that we do see and
[1:20:41] we do hear it's not about the pastor
[1:20:44] it's not about the Evangelist it's not
[1:20:47] about these things it's about you and I
[1:20:50] that God called us to come into this
[1:20:52] place and we would recognize the word
[1:20:54] and say this is what long satisfies my
[1:20:57] heart this is what I longed for this is
[1:21:00] what has drawn me out of the depths of
[1:21:01] sin and Leia
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:06] hallelujah amen these are precious
[1:21:08] reminders coming from the Throne of
[1:21:11] God not a redundant message no sir but a
[1:21:15] message that's here to remind us amen of
[1:21:17] who we are now 1 Corinthians
[1:21:21] 4:3 amen
[1:21:26] I I think this was preached for this day
[1:21:28] right here be honest that's spoken but
[1:21:31] if our gospel be hid it's hid from them
[1:21:33] that are lost in whom the God of this
[1:21:35] world hath blinded the minds of them
[1:21:37] which believe not lest the light of the
[1:21:40] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:21:42] image of God should shine unto them for
[1:21:45] we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[1:21:47] the Lord and ourselves your servants for
[1:21:50] jesus' sake now I want you to understand
[1:21:54] I I I I probably shouldn't go here but
[1:21:57] I'll just be
[1:21:59] quick people say you're following a
[1:22:04] man how many of you followed a man to
[1:22:06] church
[1:22:10] today see this word right
[1:22:15] here is very very direct telling them
[1:22:19] their minds have been blinded because
[1:22:21] they don't even believe that's right
[1:22:24] they don't even
[1:22:26] believe just go do a little research
[1:22:28] right now what's going on in the
[1:22:30] denominational
[1:22:31] world right over here now they're having
[1:22:34] great meetings under they don't really
[1:22:37] say it's the World Council of churches
[1:22:38] but when they all come together and say
[1:22:40] we should worship together because we
[1:22:42] all believe in the same
[1:22:44] God oh okay nowhere in my Bible does
[1:22:48] seula show
[1:22:53] up we have no sun Gods so Sun wives we
[1:22:58] have no
[1:22:59] Jupiters but we all believe the same
[1:23:02] thing no I'm sorry we
[1:23:05] don't and that Spirit showing up hey we
[1:23:08] as message Believers should all just get
[1:23:10] together we believe the same thing no we
[1:23:11] don't that's right no we don't we
[1:23:15] believe a pure word we don't need to
[1:23:18] come and
[1:23:19] compromise look I I'm not going to be
[1:23:21] really actually talking about clothes
[1:23:23] when I say this but but my brother and
[1:23:25] sister we believe in Holiness that's
[1:23:27] right amen we believe in living right
[1:23:30] that when people would recognize us
[1:23:31] they'd say there's something different
[1:23:33] about them and we might say well I I
[1:23:35] feel embarrassed about being different
[1:23:36] well I'll read you a quote just happen
[1:23:38] to have it amen but look at this now we
[1:23:42] preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[1:23:46] the Lord and ourselves your servants for
[1:23:49] jesus' sake come on I can't help it they
[1:23:52] got a lot of forgeries out here they got
[1:23:53] imperson ators they've got spies in the
[1:23:56] land they they've got all of this that
[1:23:58] they look at and that's the only thing
[1:24:00] they can see my brother and sister what
[1:24:02] I you see is the gospel is going to be
[1:24:05] carried and shared and preached and
[1:24:08] testified of and lived unto all Humanity
[1:24:12] amen All Nations Kindred tongue there's
[1:24:15] going to be a true witness in their
[1:24:17] means amen the prophet of God said God
[1:24:19] has never left this Earth as it were
[1:24:22] paraphrasing without a witness amen and
[1:24:25] if he said it I believe it and he's not
[1:24:27] talking about a false witness they're
[1:24:29] out of the picture they're not even on
[1:24:31] the page he's talking about real true
[1:24:33] witnesses that you can look at their
[1:24:35] life you can see the example they live
[1:24:38] and you can be testified that's a real
[1:24:40] Christian Lord let me be one of those
[1:24:42] men
[1:24:44] amen hallelujah for God who commanded
[1:24:47] the light to shine out of Darkness has
[1:24:49] shined in our hearts to give the light
[1:24:51] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:24:53] the face of Jesus Christ amen Treasures
[1:24:57] amen and Jars of
[1:25:00] Clay oh
[1:25:03] my but we have this treasure in Earth
[1:25:05] and vessels the Excellency of the power
[1:25:09] may be of God and not of us we are
[1:25:12] troubled on every side yet not
[1:25:13] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:25:17] despair now I just want to yeah we
[1:25:20] should finish that scripture thank you
[1:25:22] persecuted but not forsaken someone say
[1:25:24] Amen to that cast down but not destroyed
[1:25:27] always bearing about the body the dying
[1:25:29] of the Lord Jesus that the life also of
[1:25:32] Jesus might be made manifest in our body
[1:25:36] Hallelujah now as we look at this I want
[1:25:39] to just hurry right
[1:25:41] along Matthew
[1:25:43] 11 verse
[1:25:47] 25 at that time Jesus answered and said
[1:25:50] I thank the thank thee oh Father Lord of
[1:25:53] Heaven and Earth because thou H has hid
[1:25:55] these things from the wise and prudent
[1:25:59] amen H so this just shows that it really
[1:26:05] is of a private interpretation when it
[1:26:07] comes from God
[1:26:10] that's not us having a private
[1:26:13] interpretation but God having a private
[1:26:17] interpretation and what I love about the
[1:26:19] age that we live in this age of
[1:26:21] knowledge wisdom Etc is you have these
[1:26:24] Scholars and I I've you know did a
[1:26:26] little checking on some of these and
[1:26:27] they'll stand up and tell you
[1:26:29] emphatically this is what God
[1:26:32] meant and I'm
[1:26:35] thinking okay I I'm not very
[1:26:38] smart but that just that doesn't
[1:26:42] fit I'm sorry just doesn't fit but
[1:26:46] they're quite confident that's what God
[1:26:50] meant okay I think I'll go get educated
[1:26:54] some somewhere
[1:26:55] else I think I'll let the Lord educate
[1:26:59] me I'll let the Lord speak to me and
[1:27:02] I'll let the Lord break it all
[1:27:05] down now back into the church age book
[1:27:08] uh revelation of Jesus Christ chapter
[1:27:11] 1 now you're all familiar with this
[1:27:14] quote or should be you recall that I
[1:27:17] mentioned at the beginning of this
[1:27:19] message that this book we are studying
[1:27:21] is the actual revelation of Jesus
[1:27:25] himself in the church and his work in
[1:27:27] the future ages we are future age then I
[1:27:30] mentioned that it takes a holy spirit to
[1:27:33] give us Revelation or we will fail to
[1:27:36] get it in other words it just comes down
[1:27:39] Holy Spirit or nothing that's it amen
[1:27:43] that's
[1:27:44] it bringing these two thoughts together
[1:27:46] you will see that it won't take just
[1:27:48] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[1:27:50] book real this is why we've come down in
[1:27:53] the age that the
[1:27:58] Seminary the theological
[1:28:01] school all of
[1:28:04] this it's all presented in the same form
[1:28:07] and fashion and you can realize that
[1:28:10] because now they're coming even more and
[1:28:12] more so the
[1:28:15] curriculum of a Theological
[1:28:17] Seminary is almost
[1:28:20] all in a oh what was the word that was
[1:28:25] used in a straight line linear all
[1:28:28] linear they they just you it wouldn't
[1:28:31] matter if you go to a Methodist Seminary
[1:28:33] or you uh go to a Lutheran Seminary it's
[1:28:37] linear because you see the spirits are
[1:28:39] all being drawn back and lined up to
[1:28:42] come to be one unified thought and while
[1:28:45] they don't recognize it because this is
[1:28:47] from our Seminary just so happens that
[1:28:51] it kind of correlates with theirs and
[1:28:52] we're not that far apart
[1:28:55] even though at one time we stood up and
[1:28:57] marched out of church and never went
[1:28:58] back because it was too much but now
[1:29:02] it's not so much see the spirit's being
[1:29:05] drawn did you see where they had a great
[1:29:06] big meeting you might not have caught
[1:29:08] that on the news they had just a great
[1:29:10] big um uh ecumenical meeting here the
[1:29:13] other day and you've got Catholics and
[1:29:16] you've got all the different
[1:29:18] denominations and all of them coming and
[1:29:21] uh some of the some of the people that
[1:29:23] were there said it was the most
[1:29:25] beautiful
[1:29:27] time they have ever experienced they
[1:29:30] said the presence of God was so strong
[1:29:33] in the building it sounded like angels
[1:29:40] singing that's right brother David but
[1:29:43] the wrong Angels yes yeah yeah so you
[1:29:49] see what's happening my brother and
[1:29:50] sister this is all moving forward
[1:29:54] it's moving forward oh I could just go
[1:29:57] on and on saying that it's moving
[1:30:00] forward it's moving forward you guys are
[1:30:03] getting sleepy it's moving forward
[1:30:05] that's right it's moving forward but you
[1:30:08] want to know what the secret is it can't
[1:30:11] move forward unless you are moving
[1:30:15] forward because it's an
[1:30:19] impersonation of the real bride of
[1:30:21] Christ and as the real bride as
[1:30:24] manifesting and she is on display
[1:30:27] Satan's right there oh trust me you've
[1:30:30] got these that are over into statues and
[1:30:32] suddenly people are like well it's not
[1:30:34] really an idol it was a representation
[1:30:37] and and you got you know now you got
[1:30:39] Catholics speaking in
[1:30:43] tongues see it's all impersonation so as
[1:30:47] you would look at this might might
[1:30:48] wonder sometimes why brother Paul is
[1:30:50] wanting you just to see what's going on
[1:30:52] because as you move move forward they
[1:30:55] move forward amen amen and I want you to
[1:30:58] recognize that the word of God moving
[1:31:01] the bride into her rightful position is
[1:31:04] allowing Satan to move his bride into
[1:31:07] her rightful position because if you are
[1:31:10] not in your rightful position Satan's
[1:31:12] got no message for his people but
[1:31:15] perversion and he's just imitating this
[1:31:18] and as you'll see the word breaking
[1:31:20] forth to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:22] you'll see the word break breaking forth
[1:31:24] to Satan's bride amen amen oh my brother
[1:31:28] and sister I won't go into it here but
[1:31:30] they are having Revelation from the word
[1:31:33] they're seeing scripture like they never
[1:31:35] saw it before and they are happy to see
[1:31:38] that but what they don't realize it's
[1:31:40] not the same word even though it's the
[1:31:44] same words amen did that come across
[1:31:47] right amen not the same word even though
[1:31:50] it is the same words amen
[1:31:54] amen because their word is an
[1:31:58] impersonation
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:01] Hallelujah reminds me I hope you guys
[1:32:03] see a little humor in this just recently
[1:32:05] I saw an ad for peon pie and they were
[1:32:08] so bold to say our pie is better than
[1:32:12] whatever the name Grandma they used to
[1:32:14] be in the grocery store grandma smiths
[1:32:16] or something like that our pies are
[1:32:18] better than Granny Smiths well granny
[1:32:20] Smith's pies were horrible
[1:32:25] I mean it's like
[1:32:27] really that that's the best you could do
[1:32:29] it's like we can't say these are the
[1:32:31] best pies around so we'll just say
[1:32:33] they're better than
[1:32:35] that and that had no power had no
[1:32:37] Authority had no life had no Revelation
[1:32:40] but it's better than that but not by
[1:32:44] much
[1:32:45] Hallelujah I wonder how their pie
[1:32:48] advertisement campaign went down maybe
[1:32:52] there's enough generation s that never
[1:32:56] knew what granny Smith's pies tasted
[1:32:59] like so they think it might be good
[1:33:03] sister Sue no
[1:33:05] correlate
[1:33:07] amen but it takes a special class of
[1:33:09] people this means this book can't be
[1:33:10] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:33:13] of people it'll take one with prophetic
[1:33:16] Insight I want to ask you this morning
[1:33:19] do you guys have prophetic Insight yes
[1:33:22] amen we we should be making claim to
[1:33:24] that you might say well I don't know if
[1:33:25] I no to see a prophetic word you have to
[1:33:28] have prophetic
[1:33:30] insight and so as I have skipped over a
[1:33:37] portion and we'll drop back to it
[1:33:40] now ordinary study thinking to make this
[1:33:44] no that won't work see it's going to
[1:33:47] take the operation of the Holy
[1:33:50] Ghost it's going to be the holy ghost
[1:33:53] that makes this book liveu to a special
[1:33:58] class of
[1:33:59] people and we all know that don't we yes
[1:34:02] sir then why does that devil come around
[1:34:04] and try to build a nest on top of your
[1:34:06] head that there's something wrong with
[1:34:08] the message because this big crowd out
[1:34:09] here says
[1:34:13] so
[1:34:17] scarecrows
[1:34:20] scarecrows
[1:34:22] Hallelujah I'm going to get around to
[1:34:24] preaching it
[1:34:26] amen but that little groundhog brother
[1:34:28] Brown talks about what did he do he went
[1:34:30] up there to that scarecrow and after a
[1:34:33] while he looked at that and his desire
[1:34:35] for butter beans was greater than his
[1:34:37] fear of
[1:34:39] scarecrows and he just reached up there
[1:34:41] and hit that thing and it rattled oh my
[1:34:44] oh maybe what they said is
[1:34:46] true but the
[1:34:48] deep in the
[1:34:50] groundhog called to the Deep of the
[1:34:53] butter bean amen amen and he knew what
[1:34:57] those butter beans were and he couldn't
[1:35:00] help
[1:35:04] himself until he realized the days of
[1:35:07] Miracles are not
[1:35:09] passed God did not give all power just
[1:35:12] to the church amen he has given ears to
[1:35:16] a bride and she hears what he says and
[1:35:20] says amen she hears
[1:35:24] his very thought of the word and
[1:35:28] understand it which is the
[1:35:29] interpretation brother Brown saying read
[1:35:31] between the lines what is it my brother
[1:35:34] and sister she is one mind with her
[1:35:38] bridegroom one mind she doesn't have to
[1:35:41] Thum through a whole bunch of different
[1:35:43] does it mean this does it mean that one
[1:35:45] mind and it takes her right back to the
[1:35:47] word and she says this word is for
[1:35:51] me amen the Bold ground hog says those
[1:35:56] butter beans are
[1:35:58] mine
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:03] hallelujah yeah but a mystery
[1:36:08] requires the teaching of the spirit
[1:36:11] where it never becomes clear how we need
[1:36:13] to hear from God and lay us ourselves
[1:36:16] open and yield it to the spirit to hear
[1:36:18] and to know amen
[1:36:21] amen you amen you know the veil can't be
[1:36:26] lifted by man no sir we'll never be
[1:36:29] lifted by
[1:36:32] man we must have Christ it's that
[1:36:36] simple we must have Christ to share
[1:36:38] Christ amen we've got to have the
[1:36:42] Revelation that this word was for you
[1:36:45] yeah that's it if if you have no
[1:36:47] Revelation the words for you we'll sit
[1:36:50] in church and think about I don't know
[1:36:52] what yeah that's
[1:36:54] right almost every I'm going to throw
[1:36:57] you under the bus brother
[1:36:58] Danny almost every interaction I have
[1:37:02] with brother Danny he reminds me how
[1:37:05] good the Huckleberry milkshake that he
[1:37:07] had that I didn't
[1:37:09] have he wants me to know just how good
[1:37:14] that
[1:37:15] was and he's challenged me to drive back
[1:37:18] to horse you bend and go to that same
[1:37:20] place and get
[1:37:21] one but he knows
[1:37:24] he knows Paul you'll never do
[1:37:27] it how do you know brother Danny because
[1:37:30] in this short time that I've met you I
[1:37:31] know you'll never do it you're not going
[1:37:34] to waste your time just to drop up there
[1:37:36] to get one good delicious super
[1:37:39] delicious the best ever Huckleberry
[1:37:44] milkshake and you know what with
[1:37:47] S I had to admit that he was right
[1:37:54] and the devil
[1:37:56] said you'll never really catch the
[1:38:01] mystery of this
[1:38:04] message and too many of us
[1:38:07] said you're probably
[1:38:14] right because he knows if he can just
[1:38:18] keep you one step from that
[1:38:23] you'll never quite reach out far
[1:38:27] enough it's not whether you believe this
[1:38:30] message it's not about whether there's
[1:38:33] actually sin in your life see too often
[1:38:36] we think that devil is all about
[1:38:39] Sin but sometimes the devil just takes
[1:38:42] our very nature
[1:38:45] right and turns it against ourself
[1:38:48] that's
[1:38:49] right and then we'll say
[1:38:54] I would take
[1:38:55] communion
[1:38:58] but I'd believe for my
[1:39:00] healing
[1:39:02] but what is it he knows you're not going
[1:39:06] to get past that point right
[1:39:12] there he doesn't have to throw the
[1:39:14] garbage in front of
[1:39:15] you he knows we'll just reach a
[1:39:20] point remember brother brandham talks
[1:39:22] about Johnny
[1:39:25] Johnny had been tied up for so long in
[1:39:27] sin and unbelief of leod
[1:39:30] deia but he got set
[1:39:34] free but it had such an impact on his
[1:39:37] life that Johnny could only walk out
[1:39:39] there just so
[1:39:43] far and it's no longer the chain of
[1:39:46] circumstance no longer the chain of
[1:39:49] unbelief holding
[1:39:51] him it's Johnny holding
[1:39:55] himself see how clever Satan
[1:39:58] is Johnny wasn't out raing everybody's
[1:40:01] Berry Patch and cornfield and whatever
[1:40:03] else no Johnny's living in a small
[1:40:06] world that he won't let himself out of
[1:40:10] Lord help us amen Lord help us my
[1:40:12] brother and sister amen see we got to
[1:40:16] come to a full recognition now I'm going
[1:40:19] to hurry here amen so don't let Satan
[1:40:22] take away the re reation that you are
[1:40:24] special you have to see yourself in that
[1:40:26] Revelation Amen to come to the full
[1:40:29] recognition that the Revelation is you
[1:40:31] amen amen you got to be in there amen my
[1:40:34] brother and sister it's not something we
[1:40:36] observe from a distance amen otherwise
[1:40:39] we
[1:40:40] could we could just sit back
[1:40:43] and just say yep yep that's true that's
[1:40:47] true
[1:40:48] but we have to climb in amen excuse me I
[1:40:52] I always struggle when I start cutting
[1:40:54] paragraphs out because my thoughts but
[1:40:57] anyway you know 2 Corinthians 4 but we
[1:41:02] have this treasure in Earth and vessels
[1:41:04] that's it that the Excellency of the
[1:41:06] power may be of God and not of us no
[1:41:09] wonder I'm definitely going to stop
[1:41:11] focus on this no wonder Satan wants you
[1:41:13] to stop and look at your flesh that's
[1:41:17] right cuz if you are looking at your
[1:41:19] flesh you will not look at the treasure
[1:41:22] that's inside this earn vessel we're too
[1:41:26] busy looking on the outside and we have
[1:41:30] failed to catch the Revelation that it's
[1:41:32] not the outside of the earth and vessel
[1:41:34] but it's what's on the inside there's
[1:41:37] where the treasure is hid amen now I
[1:41:40] never did understand Pokemon but for a
[1:41:43] season you guys probably remember we'd
[1:41:45] be in church and people would be parked
[1:41:47] in her parking lot brother Ivan would be
[1:41:49] going out there you know asking them
[1:41:51] what they're doing and and uh you you
[1:41:53] know
[1:41:55] Pokémon and somebody has posted a deal
[1:41:58] on our grounds that this was some kind
[1:42:00] of a Pokemon um I don't know what was it
[1:42:06] nugget terabyte
[1:42:10] megabyte
[1:42:11] cookie I don't know the right language
[1:42:13] is I honestly
[1:42:15] don't but the people were so much they
[1:42:18] would come I hope you catch this there
[1:42:20] were so much they would come and park in
[1:42:21] our parking lot
[1:42:24] looking for a Pokemon
[1:42:27] treasure I would have loved to have got
[1:42:31] their game but we'd have had to dealt
[1:42:32] with a lot of unbelief to maybe talk to
[1:42:34] one real person I wonder what they'd
[1:42:35] have done if we'd put this Pokemon thing
[1:42:37] right
