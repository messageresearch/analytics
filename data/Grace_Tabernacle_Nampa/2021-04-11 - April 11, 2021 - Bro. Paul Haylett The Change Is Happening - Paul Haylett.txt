[Music] [Music] [Music] up [Music] [Music] are [Music] [Music] how [Music] happy and free [Music] must be [Music] [Applause] [Music] way [Music] you know we can only imagine what we can have a vision in our mind right now we can think of all the things that scripture says and all the things that have been shared with us still at this point it's unable to be completely grasped amen glad to have our visitor god bless you today sir amen and we have these visiting non-visitors and we are so happy to see them today my brother bob sister joanne god bless you how precious it is to see you today amen i was just actually thinking a couple days ago about what a rotten pastor you have because he hasn't been to your house but uh you know it just sometimes you know it really honestly is just our concern that as we cough and sneeze and whatever through life here that we don't want to bring something to your doorstep but we definitely have been lifting you up in our prayers it's good to be here today amen good to see each one of you brother sergey god bless you glad that you're with us today let's just stand as we turn in the bible today we want to speak to you on the change is happening as we look in the scripture we see all these promised words all these things that described to us and uh just felt very much that the song service this morning touched me on several notes of what i've been thinking and feeling you might say in the last few days and i just always love that when the lord comes and speaks to us through song and through the word and through prayers that are prayed amen when the devil shows up god raises a standard hallelujah we're not focused i like that brother trevor we're not focused on the fact that the devil come roaring to the doorstep we're focused on the fact that god raised up a standard hallelujah so no matter how many times the devil shows up the standard is there being raised amen and all we can say is thank you lord hallelujah let's turn in our bibles to ii corinthians this morning amen i i normally try to tell you i'm going to be short and quick and i'm not so i'm just going to tell you today this will be lengthy so that way you're just prepared for it amen hallelujah second corinthians the fifth chapter starting with the first verse going to verse nine for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved and we know if time carries on long enough it will amen we have a building of god he's in the house oh hallelujah i just got a little inspired over that praise the lord he's in the house we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit look my brother and sister if just think about the times god moving in your life and that is just a down payment that is just the earnest of what god is doing for you prayers answered amen spirits rebuke deliverances that were sought after are found healings have come and this is only a down payment oh my oh my oh my i tell you what i think if i can just inject a opinion for just one second here i think as mere mortals all we can handle is the down payment if god just poured his spirit out upon us my brother and sister we wouldn't even function as in this world right here we would not we would not even be able to see as it were what this life here is and god knew what he was doing amen hallelujah thank you lord but you know he has been still pouring in more and more hallelujah hallelujah therefore we are always confident knowing that wilts we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident is it okay as a christian to be confident look saints i want to just tell you i won't go into the whole story but you know i i've voiced it over this pulpit before you know in the world today churches around us not being critical but churches around us have a mantra we are broken we are broken god knows we are broken i my brother and sister god knows you are fixed god knows you are fixed he didn't say i want you to walk through life with this testimony i'm broken i'm broken i'm broken how can we speak these words we are confident that i'm broken no i'm confident that i'm fixed i say willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him here or there or everywhere that we would be accepted of him hallelujah don't you just love that my brother and sister oh lord we just ask you to come this morning and just open your word to us father set us aside lord that it not be our thoughts and our words but let us just come into your word and father let it make a difference this morning in our lives may your holy spirit move in our midst father the questions we have answer them lord the needs father we ask you according to thy will answer them lord open our eyes to see father of revelation of your word and father we ask for your guiding hand today in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may be seated amen you know sometimes as we are looking through our bible you know you come across this scripture that just strikes you very powerful and i couldn't tell you how many times i have read that scripture those verses but every time that i read them they come even more powerful than ever before and we can talk about all the great accomplishments the places we have been the people we have preached to and prayed for and the miracles that we have seen but it really still comes down that no matter wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him that is that is the bottom line of it all is that our life would be accepted of our lord jesus christ amen it doesn't matter rich or poor it doesn't matter whether we are educated or illiterate none of that matters what matters is this life that we are giving to him amen now as we would look at that my brother and sister we find in verse 4 which i find as a lovely verse there that we are looking now at this fact that mortality might be swallowed up of life and we're looking and as we're talking about the change is happening we are seeing that mortality is actually being swallowed up in life even as we live today it is not something that's going to be a great event someday but my brother and sister it is the day-to-day life that is this mortality this flesh and we'll dig into this a little deeper in a few minutes but it is being swallowed up i'm telling you every day there's things if we would call it our habits our natures amen and we would love to have you know a brother trevor you just struck right in the thought as i was studying these things we would love to get up one morning and all of those things of our natural life character that describes who we are personally would just be totally changed but you see god as it is is the sands of the seashore as it would be uh the river washing in the canyon god sometimes just works very slowly he lets things just move along and you know he allows us and and this is kind of just a personal uh thought to me really in a sense that god allows us to become sick and tired of us of ourself and in that it becomes the thing that instigates the change because it's not as though we change ourselves or else we would just write some health self-help books and everybody would just be changed but it is within us the word working as the song says the word is working mightily in me and you know sometimes people say well the word says you know that if we would speak to the mountain it would move well my brother and sister i don't believe that is something that god gave to us as a promise that we could just walk around saying move and everybody say wow look what he did but you've got to realize when you speak to those mountains in your life if one pebble rolls off the back side of that mountain god has honored his word we're looking for great things that change it but god says you know what you have to enter into this this is your journey this is as it were your labor now we know that works will not get us there but you'll look through the bible and find over and over again that god has required an effort from his children no child of god ever just laid in bed and got spiritual deliverance that's right amen if it is we'd all buy bigger curtains thicker curtains and just pull the pillow over our head and come out perfect for a rapture it doesn't work that way hallelujah so i love that that mortality might be swallowed up of life and you know we jump down a couple verses and it just reaches out to me this is just really the mantra that we would look at here for we walk by faith and not by sight and i'm telling you if we walk by sight my brother and sister we would be pulling the curtains over the windows and we would be putting our head under the pillow because we're living in a world that's just falling apart and there is just absolutely no doubt about it but you see walking by faith you can look and as the scripture says you see these things coming to pass look up amen don't get all discouraged don't lower your head down raise up look up your redemption draweth night i believe with all of my heart my brother and sister our redemption is right here before us amen and our faith is rising up to this that standard as it were and and we look at that you see because this standard that god has it's not offense around you that satan cannot get through it is our faith in the word of god and as satan comes in and buffets you your faith is rising up and you know you look at this take it back to the book of job you'll find the parallel that it was when the hedge was open that it was then in that case that job started to look at his own life and say you know maybe i'm not or where did i fail and then god allowed those others to come in and start voicing the words of doubt and fear and it was when job got down to a low ebb his faith was waning my brother and sister and satan must have been getting all of the little whistles and the balloons and everything ready for a celebration that god speaks to job and he grasped not just the words my brother and sister but what was behind the word amen you'll look at this and we'll touch on it in a few minutes that lord willing but you see my brother and sister when god said let there be light we don't have to say okay will this come to pass there was a manifestation and light shone now it was no longer just prophetic word speaking let there be light it was a reality so we don't have to go back and say now if god spoke let there be light will there be light there is light we have an evidence of this and when god spoke to job god moved down into the midst of job's battle when satan had raised up such a rampart against him and god spoke to job and he started thinking now what is it i know you've been there i've been there what is it why am i here when yesterday i was up in heavenly places and we start to look at that and we say why and there is something which i hope i can convey to you today that reaches out to you and changes you [Music] and one minute we're looking i couldn't possibly be a son of god i just seem to fail all the time to looking at it and saying the word says the word says and i believe it and i confess it and i don't care what the world or the devil says i'm a son of god and when we come into that position you see satan says whoa that isn't what i intended but you see that's what living by faith does we are not by this world my brother and sister we're not of the things of this world and jumping down to verse 9 before we move on wherefore we labor see there's an effort involved wherefore we labor that no matter what happens here or there that we may be accepted of him amen see that's really the goal my brother and sister too many people come along and say well we believe god sent a prophet we believe this we believe that that settles it no my brother and sister there's a life that must be lived because we're not here to be identified by a title we're identified in the life and so when we identify in the life it doesn't matter what continent you're on it doesn't matter where you from what background you come from or whatever your circumstance might be you'll recognize that who you are is uh entirely entirely contained within the words of god amen now as we look at these passages of scripture we can be looking from our present condition and saying i'm i'm looking for change i i can i can recognize the word has come i recognize that god is moving in our day and and uh what i want to do is is i want to see the change you know sometimes the hardest thing there is is to see the change in us come on saints sometimes the hardest thing is to see the change in us sometimes it can be difficult to recognize you see the same old humanity the same old problems you hear the preacher preach the body change is coming we've heard it for years have we not god's going to take home a bride god's got a chosen people god's we've heard it the change is coming amen let's just go and see what corinthians 15 51-54 says about it that's right amen behold i show you are you here i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed so every son or daughter of god that pleased him has the guarantee that you're going to be changed but change is hard change can be really hard in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass a saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory but you see my brother and sister in one sense you can look at this scripture and say that is future tense but you see the change that brings you to the fulfillment of this scripture is not what we would call a miracle it is not something that just instantly happened and there's no battle my brother and sister you'll find continuity through the scripture there's always been a battle associated with victory victory does not come by just being present victory comes by being a participant that's right so you look at this the body change is coming i believe this scripture with all of my heart but my brother and sister i want you to hear this preacher this morning that change is here because the foundation of our change is in the word of god not just the word but the revealed word or word that you understand word that's come alive to you the preacher or someone else can say it's in here it's in here but if it's not at your level and it's not in you then it does no good hallelujah i can tell every every time that they have a seminar in phoenix arizona on how to sell houses and make lots of money i i know when that happens because my phone rings and people want to know if i want to sell a house that i've sold almost two years ago you but you see they're buying into a concept that has no foundation because if it had a foundation it would be current come on we can be lutherans my brother and sister we can be methodists my brother and sister but you see the word has kept on moving and we are here we are not here to dive into the concept that luther what he spoke was absolutely truth but it's not the word for our day it is a portion it was foundation that was laid it come down it's all a part of it but we don't want to go back to luther's day my brother and sister we have revealed word for this day a word that comes down write down and follow the continuity just in the scripture and it brings us to a day that we are talking about a word in this hour that is producing rapturing faith not just a faith but rapturing faith very specific hallelujah or we can go on for a few more hundred years talking about god's going to come someday i'm telling you in my world in my world i hope your world's the same way in my world he has come he is here today i'm not looking for a future tense of god in my life i'm not looking at a past tense of god in my life i'm looking at a present tense god in my life hallelujah so the foundation of change or our change let's get more specific is in the word of god now let's look right here in this quotation amen that the people that's the people now the seed of abraham because he raised us from the dead amen we were dead in sin and trespasses and he who was able to change look changes that's it multifaceted he changed my mind amen amen brother christian your lovely wife is undergoing the metamorphosis of a change of mind amen amen come on i hope we're all lifting her up in prayer you see we don't want her to just sit there in limbo land is there a god or is there not right we know there's a god hallelujah so he's able to change my mind change my thoughts boy it's getting more complicated as we go here change my nature don't you love this all encompassing right we can't just hit a few high points comes down change my nature change me all over that's from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet from fingertip to fingertip i don't want to just lose a temper i don't want to just lose this i don't want to just lose that i want to be changed oh hallelujah can someone say it's happening hallelujah he can do as he pleases and if he can't do as he pleases he's not god so people that are like well you know we can only expect so much unbeliever i can expect a complete deliverance a complete restoration a complete healing and complete revelation of who jesus christ is anything short of that you are limiting god which means you don't believe change my thoughts change my nature change me all over he can do as he pleases whatever he says i believe it's the truth and every seed of abraham believes the same thing amen hallelujah i hope this doesn't sound judgmental to you my brother and sister but the problem is is we have way too many limitations this will work unless this happens they'll get deliverance unless this happens they would come to church if the sermon was short enough and didn't step on my toes come on real son or daughter of god says oh lord condition me condition me lord for what i need to receive amen a little something comes in my mind but i think it's too you might say just humor and i don't want to inject it now but you see my brother and sister this is what happens when a person completely surrenders to jesus christ amen that's right that's exactly right we can only move as far let's just stop for a minute god might change our mind about something but we really want to have our own opinion so he doesn't get our thoughts and we'll still stand up and if you're irish forgive me i'm not picking on you it's just the common phrase well we have a temper we're irish you ever noticed you never saw anyone who ever repeated that go well we have a temper we're irish no sir we have a temper we're irish come on that's how it works so we might give him our mind as it is now if you'll understand this that we can read our bible and say sure enough jesus christ died for me sure enough i need to repent i need to be baptized sure enough i need to but you see we don't give him our thoughts we're still more concerned about the fact that major league baseball left the state of georgia we have a disaster here what are they going to do well praise the lord when i first saw that major league baseball cancels georgia and i was like mlb what is that i'm not making fun of it but it's like with all the acronyms that are out here in the world and then then i thought well what is that and i i was on the computer news and i clicked on it's like oh major league baseball yeah that's right they still play baseball don't they you see because that's not our world but if we give him our mind but our thoughts are all caught up in our nature's all caught up and see what it comes down to is we got to have a change [Applause] and what god starts god finishes hallelujah come kicking or screaming come crying come holding on to everything in the world but if you're son or daughter of god you will come that's it hallelujah might have to give up some of those beloved things yeah we'll move on before i get myself in trouble amen now look at this ephesians 1. this is quite a lengthy bit of scripture but if you'll just be patient with me you look at this because you see god is laying a foundation and and when we uh can catch the mind of god the spirit of god we'll understand exactly what god is trying to do now you know you can come along and and you know just pick something you can have uh two men equally qualified equally gifted framing a house but they have learned in two different fashions when those men come together one's going to be telling the other you're doing that wrong you're doing that wrong you're doing that wrong but yet in reality they will both finish with a house that is square and plum and is structurally sound it's just one learned in a different fashion now i'll bring this out to expound on it a little more i remember years ago i was in construction when there were men that moved here or come here from the state of california and introduced what they called the california corner in framing now most of you wouldn't know what that was but it actually is just a labor saving and a wood saving method of framing corners on a house and i remember the first house we encountered and working with a gentleman and he said we're going to frame this house with california corners and all of us are looking at him what are you talking about and we framed the house with california corners because it was his house his job and when the inspector come he said what kind of nonsense is this i'm not accepting this there's not enough wood in this corner and so this man had to then go into the uniform building code and dig through there into some random paragraph that says in this condition you can in the meeting of two walls in a corner introduce you can do it blah blah blah blah and the inspectors like never knew that existed so you see my brother and sister the fact that we as humans i cannot come in in my spiritual walk the same exact way that brother trevor comes or brother david or anyone else i am me and i come but there is one absolute that is the word and the word says this is how it will be done what i will accept and what i won't accept and no matter what our opinion of that is we have to come back to the word because it designates to us what is acceptable and so as you look at that now paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which art ephesus i meant grace to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us come on are you with me who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen not our church not a certain preacher not someone who feels like they have more revelation but to his good will and pleasure to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved hallelujah so it's not just a random possibility or something far-fetched that we might find ourselves accepted according to this word we are already accepted can someone say amen this morning already accept it amen amen i get excited about that in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known oh my brother and sister are you with me this morning having made known unto us the mystery of his will now let me just interject this if we as a church are living acting walking talking behaving contrary to the word of god we cannot reach up and take this scripture and say it's ours that doesn't mean god's not moving you changing you bringing you to this position but you see we can't have an opinion contrary to the word and then say oh praise god you're in conflict having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness that's complete the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ not in the beginning not in the beginning not in the middle point not at the three quarters in the fullness that's the end of my brother and sister when it's all coming manifested out in the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him hallelujah in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated now look i i don't want to i don't wanna sound judgmental but you ever talk to somebody in the marketplace and you visit and something said and they like we don't believe in predestination okay i don't know that we really have anything to talk about [Music] because my bible which i believe with all of my heart says we're predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen amen you know there's some christian humorous one of them he assured everybody it wasn't really a bible and he had some humor to go with it and the point he was making was very profound and he says you know i love to witness to everybody i meet and i met this person in the store and i was talking to them they said well we don't agree with that part and he reaches over into this book rips a few pages out and he said i was down here in the park walking the dog and i got to talking to an individual and they were like oh praise the lord this this and this what do you think about that i don't believe that and he said and that i can't do justice to his humor he said and that's how they got the pocket version of the bible because they ripped everything they disagreed with out of it and when they got done they could just slide it in their pocket no my brother and sister we're believers we're believers i believe this bible it is not for us to censor it's for us to believe thank you lord amen yes that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory now we come back here's our second encounter as it were now we understand that this is in the mind of paul this is revelation how god revealed it to him on the backside of the desert but he's once again reiterating to us or a second witness that this is the earnest or the down payment of our inheritance now this down payment my brother and sister is enough to take the drunk and the whoremonger the most vile among stuffs and wash them white as snow oh this down payment this earnest of our inheritance is so powerful oh imagine what the full strength of it is oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now look at this see to fulfill this scripture now i want to know are we called to fulfill this scripture are we called to be these people hallelujah but look at this now look at the struggle that we face we born in sin and shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies that's what the word of god speaks about us amen we're called sinners but go back to verse four and you will recognize that we were called for change see this right here in verse 4 according that he has chosen us and hit before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love my brother and sister there has to be a change from those born in sin and shaped in iniquity to fulfill verse 4 there has to be a change but you see the problem is is we're looking at it in the wrong way because we will find that we were in christ from before the foundation of the world so really what the change is is in our thinking now our change is in how we view ourself because you will be as you see yourself come on are you with me you will be as you see yourself and we're not talking about self-help or psychology if you look at the word of god and you say i'll never live up to that my brother and sister then you will struggle and struggle and struggle you look at the word of god and say lord there's a high standard there's a high standard you have raised up in this lao to see an age and lord i i don't know it doesn't look like i can do it it doesn't seem like i can do it but your word says i will do it lord so i will do it you see it has to come to the way we think it so my brother and sister the change oh we see it we see it in our lives we preach it to our children that you're going to repent and be baptized you got to get filled with the holy ghost you've got to live for god there's no substitute no shortcut but my brother and sister do you understand that the will of god has already been placed in you it is now time for us as sons and daughters of god to look at the plan of god and see who we are in the plan and when we see oh well i tell you my brother and sister you cannot look i i have a friend only one in the whole family that's a christian the family is respectful but yet a little bit mocking i think they term him as the reject six that live this way and one that won't touch their lifestyle they think it's ruled by a majority so therefore he must be the reject and you know what he does he turns around and says that's right i've rejected everything the devil offered that's right they don't like that they start talking about politics that's much safer do you see my brother and sister what happened it's the frame of mind i hope you catch my point today i could be misunderstood it's how you look at yourself in the word of god that's going to matter that's what was happening with job job was starting his friends are saying look joe what was a secret sin what is it job that you have done and job was there frustrated his own wife saying you know what you speak as a foolish man why don't you just curse god and die and you can't tell me that job is a man didn't look over at his wife and think i'd like to just ring her a little scrawny neck we are humans aren't we yeah but you see when god spoke to job not the first time he ever spoke to him but in the midst of that battle in that season god spoke to job and job started to catch that and god says where were you hallelujah what a question to be asked us where were we my brother and sister well i've got the word of god that says that before the foundation of the world i was in him so i can stop and say i don't know what happened when the stars were hung i don't know what in the heavens were created i don't know none of that stuff but i know according to the word i was in him i was chosen in him before the foundation of the world so i can go back to that place but you see i have to be able to reconcile who i am and who you are in this present world and the struggles that we have and the trials that we face and we can say but if i was a christian i wouldn't do this and god says i've already chose you that portion of the equation is all finished what we're working on is the changing of your thinking of your ideas your imaginations your nature to see my plan for you to see who you are in me there's where the change is coming amen it is not that we will save ourselves it is not that we can produce anything but god coming down starts to enlighten or show us that we truly are sons and daughters of god and that equation is settled hallelujah you see we've been chosen for change now you look at this my brother and sister when you're chose for change brother it's not just a simple thing it actually can be quite strenuous you might say on us in our life you know as a as a young child my my parents my parents did their very best that they could do we lived on a farm outside of the small town of greenleaf about the same distance you might say opposite of what the graham family lives on this side we lived on the other side the family lovely old couple christian people friends quakers owned a little store in greenleaf we're talking about a little old store stooped wood porch with the boards worn pot belly stove in the middle you could walk in there ask for a gallon of milk and walk out of the store they pulled the card out under your family name and wrote the date and one gallon of milk and when my parents settled up their milk check at the end of the month they would stop in there they would pull that card out they would add up what was owed that's strange it says candy born in sin shaped in iniquity we would go in that store as such clever clever seven eight nine year olds and we'd go by the candy counter nobody knows we are so clever many years later we went to make it right with them how do you know how many candy bars you stole this old couple just looked at us and said we knew all the time what this is not a revelation no we knew all the time why didn't you do something we did what did you do the police here to arrest us we went home every night and prayed for you amen we live in a world now that the devil causes you to do it and then he calls 9-1-1 but you see god works in a different way and here was an old couple that could have threw the gauntlet as it were down on us instead they went home and prayed for those little children that they'd all be saved stunning just reduce you into a sobbing child because you just realized these people as much as they always tossled our hair when we were little and encouraged us now you kids remember you do good in school or you'll end up like us but you see god knows because you see what he started he knew that when you heard the word of truth that you would believe and he knew that you would be sealed and he knew that that would be the earnest of your inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession he knew he knew saints a kid that was stealing candy didn't know did he all he could think about was i have 50 cents and i'm not going to spend it on candy if i can steal it now you have to remember you know back in them days you could buy gumballs for a penny a piece so you know it was a different world now we'd say well that's nothing but you see it was all relevant it was all relevant now you look at this the redemption of the purchased possession you catch the saints are you catching what we're looking at this and our previous scripture are all past tense already finished already settled has nothing looking to if this happens here or if that happens there all of it is past tense amen i hope you catch the significance of it god with confidence declared it as a finished work amen now here an unveiling of god really good sermon amen really good sermon yes sir like i changed from husband when my child is born then i'm father when my grandchild is born i'm grandfather see but i don't change that's still me that's right see and that's god and it's just i changed my see it's just you changed your form see notice and nature changes down from a young man to middle aged to an old man there you are you see you just changed your form now you couldn't say little fellows standing up here 16 years old say he was a grandfather he couldn't be his form has to be changed a few years changes it then he becomes a grandpa see what i mean amen now look at this but he's the same person all the time the same person god all the time in the is in this way he reveals himself to his people in doing this notice through the age of the pillar of fire re revealed himself to his people in the age of jesus he revealed himself to his pape people in the age of the holy spirit as son of god son of david he always reveals himself in that manner to his people making the people to know him now we're talking my brother and sister not to the whole world we're talking to real christians through sons and daughters of god god always reveals himself to his people to his children amen it's not god hiding himself and letting you guess god will reveal himself to you hallelujah oftentimes we want to know the great secrets before we meet the man who wrote them come on we want to boast we know christ we know christ we know christ but we don't even know what he read we don't understand what he read wrote i mean we don't understand it but we want to be able to say we know it we know it we know it we know it come on could kind of speak some kind of harder things concerning the day that we live in but i'll tell you my brother and sister we were just discussing it on the way to church you see it's such a paradox that people will talk about their relationship and their experience and how they love the lord but we'll live a life that's contrary to his word see you can't live the life contrary to him and actually say you know him because his nature is just as much him as his spirit is and john 1 says that the word is him so you can't contradict the word and say you have him that's right it gets a little dicey right you say well that's kind of that's kind of not very kind well my brother and sister the truth is we need to get people to christ not church that's right amen that's right he has veiled behind something notice in the same way or same nature every time god veiled in jesus to do the work of redemption at the cross god could not die as a spirit he's eternal but he had to put on a mask and act the part of death he did die but he didn't do it in his god form see that confuses a lot of people that's why they want to support the trinity because they've got to divide god up because they don't think our god is big enough to then make a body go down and dwell in that body preach the word and then retract himself from that body right as the spirit left jesus say that don't think that god's big enough to do that because they've got god in saying well we were created in his image and we can't do that well i'm sorry you're not god you're a part of him if the words in you but you're not god so they're approaching the word of god in a humanistic mental approach that says this is how we can do it this is what we would do and if we have the opportunity this is the potential of what we do and they have totally lost the prospect or the the understanding of god did i confuse you or you're just quiet amen god veiled in jesus to do the work of redemption at the cross god could not die as a spirit he's eternal but he had to put on a mask and act the part of death he did die but he couldn't do it in his god form he had to do it in the sun form as son of man on earth see he had to be sun form then when he returned on pentecost he was son of god again see what i mean get the idea he was amen look at that how god is coming now presenting himself now you go on in in this message brother brown was talking about god in morphe right how that god come down and he just put a mask on as it was in a play same god come down from creator amen coming all the way down through provider healer everything he just put on a different mass same god amen there was no division of authority same god amen so as he's putting on this he did not change his nature saints look at this regardless of what he was presenting he didn't change his nature and so if god cannot change his nature he's immutable if he can't change his nature he won't change his word so we live in a world where everybody wants to dice the word up and say well we think it should be like this surely he meant this he meant what he said and said what he meant amen changing his mass not his nature not his word same name same physical form now look at this i want you to follow this right here we'll come down and look at this just you and i same name same physical form but you see god working in us changes us from the carnal amen yes changes us from the carnal changes us to the spiritual but you see he didn't stop there because people can be spiritual and not have all of god people can be very spiritual and not be even lined up to the word of god people can talk have gifts speak in tongues people can prophesy people can have visions they can do all of that and be off of the word amen so you have to be careful when you say well i did this and i did that i witnessed this or i spoke this i prophesied this that's good are you on the word amen so we can be changed from the carnal to the spiritual but the next step that god is working is to move us out of the spiritual into the supernatural and wherever god is the supernatural is present that is god working in his word so if we say we have the word and it's alive but we are all just carnal we are all just caught up in the things of the world the fashion and the life and the nature of the world my brother and sister we can say we've got religion we've got a spirit on us but we don't have the supernatural which is supernatural can also if you want to allocate it to this sense is the holy ghost amen so wherever the holy ghost is the supernatural will take place lives will be changed and god will work see one can be spiritual without being supernatural but see what happens there's a change taking place god brings us out of the carnal that's often times just an incredible change is it not i mean it's pretty funny i remember one time sister jerry and i i won't mention where it's at in case you ever meet these people but uh we were at some folks house and and uh i preached at their little church and and um we're at a house and there's this big bookcase full of photo albums and uh i i just sitting there and i wouldn't say i was bored but nothing really happening i pulled a photo album out i looked through it and here it is starts off with their family before they're married and all this stuff and i'm going through there the brother's like whoa whoa whoa no don't look at those albums and it sparked a conversation he goes we really shouldn't keep those out in public i was like you shouldn't we got in this conversation he said you know a little bit brother paul my wife and i keep these as a reminder where god brought us from their photos when they were first married you know before they got saved just being like the world he says now you skip about the next five or six photo albums you can go to the next one so i just i love photos i reached down there and i pulled that one out and here it is and it's like oh cool something happened and it's like something happened next album something's really happened next album wow something's really happened the change is taking place god is in our midst working on us changing us no longer will we boast of being irish no longer will we boast of our intellect no longer will we boast of anything but christ because we recognize without him we're nothing we're nothing that's right there's a brother i'll just share this little antidotal deal here there's this brother lives back in kentucky um when sister jerry and i first met him we couldn't even understand spoke his name we had his name totally different i mean we were totally totally confused we made a comment about brother so and so when somebody says who's that and we're like you you know him and they're like that's not his name because he talked like he was from way up in the hills of kentucky and a brother asked him one time he says brother you work in the coal business what do you do i own them turns out in the hill country of kentucky and west virginia even walmart leases land from him for a building because he owns it all whoa brother what's it like to be rich he said i don't know really nothing's really changed but i can tell you what it's like to get saved something changed a man that might be one brother told me he's worth 100 million bucks he didn't care he wants to tell you about how he got saved amen you see a change coming over but what happens is if satan can get in there he causes us to put down what it was to get saved and raised up the idea of what it'd be like to have a lot of money but a real move of the holy ghost on a man or woman would cause them to put that down and want to tell you what it was like after they got saved you see this is the kind of change god is working he's not taking us to be glorified in this world here glorified in the eyes of man but as we shared at the start of our deal it is that we would whether here or there please him amen that's what it's all about it's not about how impressed people are in the day that we live in but it's about whether we are pleasing to him you see my brother and sister because one can be spiritual and not be even saved but you see when the change starts taking place you see it's like a play i just let me finish this out and then we'll be done it's like a play you see some characters in the play and you'll find this is brother branham speaking about these things some characters in the play they come and they play a part and then they go off and they come back and they play another part and they might go off again and come back and play another part but you see some my brother and sister in this great play we call life or just called to be carnal that's the only part of the play they have is just being carnal and there's some that are called from the carnal part and they come back out to play another part of the play and that is as a spiritual person they can tell you what god has done for them they can tell you how blessed they are they can do all these things but here this sounds judgment judgmental but forgive me you can sit there and you will experience that and realize what they're doing how they're living is actually contrary to the word of god uh my isaac and i had a tad bit of experience like that yesterday somebody just oh praise the lord glory to god hallelujah all this stuff my brother and sister but you look at that not judgmental i actually love this lady but you look at that and realize this doesn't line up with the word of god but you can't put an edge in sideways or a word in sideways to talk about any other thing because they've got the answer so they've come back with the mask of a spiritual person but my brother and sister that won't do it either because just being spiritual doesn't mean we line up with the word of god and i don't honest from the depths of my heart you know i'm not saying this judgmental it's just that is the part that they are playing and we know as long as there's life there's hope amen but now we see some and just to kind of shrink this down and not drag it all out we see some come back again and they're called to wear a supernatural mass they're called as a word be the star of the show or the heroine or the hero they're called with another mass they come back and they come back under another anointing they've been through everything every one of those has but they've come back and by god's grace as we've read the scripture to you today they're called now from before the foundation of the world to step into another position that they are chosen and predestinated and that they have been filled with the holy ghost and they have been sealed into the day of their redemption they're coming back wearing another mouse they're not the common church they're not the world out here they've been called to another part in the play and each part of the play if you look at it in the natural my brother and sister requires a little more in the human element we would say talent or some quality right are you following me we're certainly not lifting any any human abilities up but in that the higher the position or the more what would you call it uh all i can think of is carnal words the star of the show are you with me reminds me i as a kid i got sick i didn't end up going to the school play thank you lord but you know what my part in the play was give you a little idea with the teachers and whatnot thought of me i was the guy standing at the gate with the spear he doesn't move he doesn't say anything he just stands there and looks straight ahead and i remember my teacher saying paul you'll be perfect for that part yeah see i can talk about this firsthand but you see god keeps calling some back to another part and another part and every one of those parts requires more than the previous part did every one of those require something more a sacrifice memorizing part of it was in in the play just be honest to the teacher here part of it was as paul was horrible at memorizing things right so these kids all had lines they had to memorize and the teachers say now paul what are you supposed to say ah no you can't have the piece of paper paul you have to memorize it oh okay but you see each one of these is requiring a little more i want to tell you how god moved this morning brother jason sang the songs that lined up brother trevor got up not lifting these up this is god moving in a mess brother trevor got up and talked about a standard standard you see it's god that's raising the standard saints not just to keep the devil out but for the perfecting of his bride he keeps raising a standard and she keeps she can't help it can you explain to me why you want to meet that standard can you explain to me why you wake up in the middle of the night and you cry tears lord help me live your word lord help me lord to live up to your word why is that in you because god's calling to you is lifting you up to a higher standard and it's in that my brother and sister that you move from just being carnal from spiritual and move into the supernatural and he identifies as supernatural as bride according to the scripture see now we could go back i want to reiterate this again got ahead of myself earlier we can go back to ephesians 1 and notice and looking down through that scripture every bit of that is in past tense he's already done that work for you and i hallelujah he's not hoping that you will meet up to that he's not hoping that you as a as a christian will someday somehow meet that standard he's already made the declaration and now he's bringing his will to pass that's bringing you to the place you're rising to the standard you're rising to that position to fulfill that word of god because you were predestinated you were called of god the word says chosen could have chose anyone can someone lift a hand and say thank you lord for choosing me amen that's that's what it comes down to saints it ain't what we did he chose us amen and he says this is a part you can play it you can you can identify with it now i want to just i just want to come along that line right here now a key notice here as we read that this angel come down from heaven having a key in his hand i believe it's revelation 13 or 19 we find again another angel coming with a key and a key is purpose of a key is to unlock something something that's been locked up or is something that should be locked up but a key is given for that purpose now there are many kinds of keys because we have many uses of keys there is keys to the storehouses praise the lord we have a heavenly vision that said we're going to store up manna some people have their idea what that stored up man is i'm telling you my brother and sister some people have been given a key we don't have to wait for someone else to unlock the storehouse we don't have to follow some man's direction on what to look for inside of the storehouse god gave us the key to go to the storehouse and unlock it for whatever need we have right now hallelujah this is the age it was stored up for saints not for another day far down the road it was stored up for today and too many people are sitting back saying well we're going to wait for direction on opening the storehouse i'm sorry i've been given a key i've been given a key and whatever i need i can walk right in there i'll tell you how that works can i just be free for a moment i'll tell you how that works you have a little something that's kind of bothering something a little struggling i'm talking about paul here and you're just kind of going it's like lord i don't know i don't know and you go and you pick up your bible and it opens and there's a scripture and you read it and you go oh my there's the answer then you go pick up a message because i like to read as it were more than listen i did that last night sister jerry bore the brunt of my excitement key to the door laying on the little bookcase and i thought i want to read a little something here even just a page or two or three before i go to bed and now options oh there's a cover of one but no book marriage and divorce read that about 10 times in the last few months uh oh key to the door i sat down there are many kinds of keys because we have many uses of keys there's keys to the storehouses that's right i got so excited hallelujah somebody don't have to bust the lock and i don't have to sit here and wait for somebody to come along that's going to put the key in and tell me this is what it all means go i think it's about page 27 or so 25 6 7 in your church age book the prophet of god talks about we need to pray for revelation that's right more than anything else hallelujah why because it's key it's a key it starts unlocking the storehouse we don't need to have anybody tell us exactly where to go to find it in the storehouse or you need to listen to this because this is what you need today maybe what i need today is different than what you need today but i've got a key to this storehouse there's key to your own house right no preacher older i get the more upset i get when people blame their problems on the preacher could because i'm a preacher but i don't think so because you see you hold the key to your house i don't have the key to your house i cannot drive to brother sergey's right now and just let me let myself in his house i don't have a key to his house he might tell me where he's got one hid but you understand there's a key to your automobile we call them keys and they are keys they can be duplicated many times or to the house or there sometimes can be made what we call the skeleton key yeah in other words it's a key that's kind of made with the levers acts on it that twist the lock in a certain way can almost unlock any door called the skeleton key have you ever witnessed that yeah one time i a guy i knew i used the locksmith whatever and he was like kind of joking he says i want to make a bet on how long it'll take me to get inside your pickup and i thought he don't gamble he's got about 10 kids so he ain't got no money so there has to be a sure thing going here and i said i i won't and he went over to my vehicle and faster than i could figure out what he was doing he had my door open now saints if you don't lock your house and you don't guard the key the devil will climb right in and you'll come home to a house that's rummaged pillaged amen yeah our house or even our automobiles can be duplicated and then there is a key cannot unlock no door and here's the part i got a little excited about that's it are you seeing it saints any key cannot unlock no door until it's used by a man amen and unlock it because you see let me say something very brash and bold here if i had a key to your spiritual house there would not be one of us dragging old ugly baggage behind us there would not be one of us that would be dragging fears and bitterness there would not be one of us because if i had the key to your spiritual house we would unlock it and we would clean it out but i don't hold that key you do you have to pick up the word of god you have to unlock it you have to then walk over to the storehouse and unlock it do you realize every son or daughter of god's got a key to that storehouse in spite of some people acting like there's only a handful of keys in this message to unlock the storehouse i'm here to tell you i've got the words of a prophet that gave that authority to me to you and to everyone that desires a closer walk with the lord the key in itself cannot use itself it's got to have something to yield the key hallelujah is change happening oh lord help us take the key and unlock it amen oh my yes let's see whether we want to go on to this or call it quits i think we should read it is that okay another another couple minutes here that's it we in him then we being in him we are still veiled to the religionists and professors of the world see our glory that we have and enjoying right because we got a key to the storehouse we are still veiled to them outsiders they think we're crazy and not again see see that's right but we who are in here in christ baptized into him first corinthians 12 and to him we are partakers of this glory does that know what the scripture says amen see this is not just oh this is what you believe this is the bible see but not on the outside you're still looking in denying it see so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is were invited into him which is hid to unbelievers by the veil of human flesh by the veil of human flesh i can still find your faults i can still see your mistakes if you were really the bride of christ if you were really a son of god if you were really a daughter of god but they're looking at the veil because they can't see no further so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all he is we're invited into him which is hid to unbelievers by the veil of human flesh they know that glory see this is what i was talking about earlier they know that glory they read of it it's in the word the glory of god and things like that it's just a word to them amen to us it's a manifestation see it's more than a word it's reality this goes back i made reference of this earlier i kind of forgot i'd actually put it in here god said let there be light that was the word but now there is light it ain't the word it's light see what i mean we don't have to go back and say will this be fulfilled it is fulfilled now isn't just a written word to us it's reality we're in him now we're enjoying now we behold him now we see him the word manifesting himself it's hid out there because why it's veiled in human flesh just as it was when jesus was there and come right down in their midst my brother and sister you understand some people say this is just mythology but it will make the point to you they had it figured out exactly how the messiah was going to come they had him coming in such a fashion that all they were looking for was that particular thing but here he come veiled in human flesh born under a circumstance that they could not comprehend they said this is illegitimate this is wrong but what they couldn't understand was that seed that pure word of god could not come in any human relationship of a mixing of cells and a blood borne and a seed and coming forth through sex and a human deliverance my brother and sister it had to be the pure word of god so there could be no other uh way to bring it no other depiction no other deal but the way god chose to do it they could look at that and say oh my goodness he's illegitimate and he can't possibly be and now he's claiming he is the son of man that he is a child of god when he says i and my father are one he's blasphemous but they didn't even realize they were talking to god himself and so it is in the 21st century i don't know why i like to read articles like this maybe it's because i'm crazy but when i see these articles talking about this my brother and sister i won't mention the name because i don't want to mark the man as it were but there's a man who has repeatedly lied to his churches has been caught in all kinds of discrepancies and all kinds of carnal things and as of last year people still sent his little church something to the tune of 74 million bucks because he stands up there and says if you send me money god will bless you enough people believe him add up to 74 million bucks then he begged him for more money so he could buy a nicer jet because he had a dream from god of him flying in a brand new falcon x well if we're going to get into the dreams i had a dream here a while back now you know guys don't want to do that okay yeah sorry about that but you see my brother and sister then you have a man or men stand up and preach the word directly from the bible and they want nothing to do with him why because that spirit that's on them identifies with the spirit that's on them and the reality of it is they don't want god they want money that has become their god and some people control is their god and some people notoriety or fame or influence is their god you see the devil's got this lovely smorgasbord and he just lays it out and he lays it out and people are coming they're attracting to what will give them what they want but did you realize going back in our scripture without going back to quote them he said i chose you before the foundation of the world to be in me holy and righteous and if god said i've chose you he never
