just be seated for a moment sister Jerry as a song that I would like her to sing amen at um you know sometimes you just little things just touch you and you say you know what this is this is good I believe what touches us my brother and sister it's not just us as one individual but touches us collectively as a body amen [Music] the father has a plan though it's hard to see it now you feel you're walking all alone but he is there no doubt when the storm around you rages and you're tossed to and fro when you're faced with life's decisions not sure which way to go stand still and let God move standing still is hard to do when you feel you have reached the end he'll make a way for you stand still and let God move when the enemy surrounds you and the walls are closing in When the tide is swiftly rising and you wonder where he's been friend there never was a moment that his arms weren't reaching out you can rest assured and be secure God is moving right now stand still and let God move standing still is hard to do when you feel you have reached the end he'll make a way for you stand still and let God move when you feel you have reached the end he'll make a way for you stand still and let God move he answer will come but only in his time stand still and let God move stand still and let God move hallelujah hallelujah hey man let's just stand as we'll go into the word Brother David I heard a lovely report Lord this orchestrated that you'd have a full house amen and that's just beautiful thing the Lord just allowed him to have a birthday party and attract people from all over to be there and to be a part of that and the Lord knows amen just as he knows how to draw his bride from the four corners of the earth amen he knew each one of us would be here today and he knew what it would be as it would be for last weekend amen and we thank God for that amen Hallelujah I want to speak to you this morning on the measure of faith amen and Faith applied and so as we look at this my brother and sister we'll just turn to Romans the 12th chapter and uh in that we can just draw we'll start to draw our thought for the day amen Romans 12 1-5 amen it's good to see each and every one of you I know that there are some obviously some traveling some gone some sick I know brother Sergey I saw him yesterday and talked to him for just a moment and he sounded pretty rough and so we just pray Lord would just be with them and my daughter and grandchildren and anyone else that we might have missed that's not well today we just pray God's hand of Mercy those are not here Lord just be with them amen Romans 12 1-5 I beseech yeed therefore brother I I beseech you therefore pause comma brother in specific who he's talking to by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice and be not conformed to this world oh my I'm just I'm having a hard time reading this morning let me start over here with my glasses off I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you presents your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and we can make an emphasis on reasonable and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect pause will of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members one of another Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord to come just open your word to us Lord this deal father in the flesh and the body father of those who are not well today maybe hear or absent Lord those who by circumstance Lord are not here we just certainly father ask you to just deal kindly with each one all of the prayer requests father seems like we always miss someone or something but father you know the needs of this body Lord you know the needs of your body the bride of Christ and Lord we just ask you to come and and just touch each one of those needs father and Lord encourage and give strength father give direction and wisdom father give Revelation and Lord we'll ask you to come this morning and open the word of God lord beyond what our human comprehension but open the word of God to us father that we can walk out today Lord Just a Little Closer to You Lord a little encouraged Lord a little strengthened father whatever is necessary in this body that the vitamin of the word come down into watch each Soul father we thank you for this opportunity to come today and we bless you father and we thank you for your blessings your grace upon us we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as we look at this today I think as we would take and just look at verse 2 for a moment it's a kind of single that out you might say and to to look at that for a moment it is there my brother and sister that it tells us not to be conformed to this world and so if we're going to correctly apply the word of God to our lives we we have to actually stop and take it now I'm just going to term it this way if you if you would follow me we have to take it literally from semicolon to comma to semicolon to comma we can't just go and brush our way through the word and say well that was good it's God's word but you see God is wanting to come in one portion of the scripture one one portion of a verse would complement my brother and sister it is there what unfolds that and there are many keys but there's only certain keys that unlock the gospel amen and and that's why you know when God gave the keys to Peter amen and told him you know to go and take that my brother and sister there were those who misinterpreted that and thought that it was like that he held the key but the key was Revelation and the key that was given my brother and sister was not a key just for that day that season not even for that church age but it was for Time and Eternity and when eternity is still unfolding my brother and sister the keys will still be working amen and so you say well will we need more Revelation when we when we get to the other sign well I believe we will be receiving more Revelation as we get there because God is unfolding himself and so as it's there that we receive that and so you know he he says here not to be conformed to this world and I want to just focus for a minute how easy it is actually to be conformed how easy it is that we as humans and I know when I was a young man in high school I struggled with kind of what you might say was a dual identity I I really as a young man I wanted to serve God but there was struggles you might say in the church at that time and I did not identify with those struggles and it seemed like the world over here just come in and filled that little void that was there and I found myself as a Young Man conforming to the things of the world and you know it was like you get off the school bus you know and uh when you went out of the house in the morning you know you had your hair had to be combed you know my parents were were not super fussy but you know they kind of said hey look you know you need to look a certain way my hair was combed my shirt was tucked in by the time I got off the school bus at the high school my hair looked like I'd been through a tornado and my shirt was untucked and sleeves sloppily rolled up because that was what the fashion of the day was and I was conforming into the fashion and when I got off the school bus at the end of the day in front of my house well I couldn't do much for my hair but my shirt was tucked in and my sleeves were rolled down and buttoned up you see I knew and the scripture tells us that if we know when we don't do it that to us it's iniquity it's actually sin and so I was nothing more than a sinner that had an understanding that there was something greater than what I saw at the time something greater than I felt like I could live or was compelled to live but that did not take away that there was something greater there and so we want to correctly apply the word and and so by not being conformed to the world but if we allow ourselves to be transformed now my brother and sister there's many Transformations take place but we are not here my brother and sister to to take a World's idea you know you go into a bookstore and you go to the self-help section isn't it amazing that a bookstore will actually have a whole section that is about you helping yourself now if they would just go ahead and have a section that said God helping you and filled it full of Bibles it would make a difference in life but what do they do they come to a place and promote the idea the transforming of your thinking that I can change me but my brother and sister the truth is very few people are actually successful at changing themselves and usually it's a superficial thing they're changing my brother and sister you know what it does is I read a book one time the guy very candid and he said you know I I was uh kind of into dabbling the social drugs and alcohol and and you know I started reading these self-help books and he said you know I I I quit the smoking cigarettes and drinking and and the recreational drugs and I just replaced that addiction with another one that was more acceptable what we are looking as we've sung in the songs this morning we're looking for renewing of our minds amen what is that taking our mind back to what it was before it got muddied up and perverted and and all the trash dumped out upon that he says they be transformed by the Renewing Your Mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and so my brother and sister to correctly apply the word we're going to have to change our thinking amen it's not a self-help book it's not it's not me gonna just oh I'm going to think positive thoughts think positive thought there must be a change in our thinking but not a psychology type change of our thinking amen it's not a psychology type thing that you know mind over matter as it is but yet you will find as a son or daughter of God that you have to think in the right vein because wherever our mind is at we will go if our mind is on money we'll go speaking to the youth group amen nothing wrong with prosperity but the scripture clearly shows us that our prosperity must be in Christ and then it will also be in the natural amen when Prosperity is Just only in the natural my brother and sister we can be a corrupt I won't even go there it's all negative but we can be so corrupt and have Prosperity but when you prosper in Jesus Christ amen then your business and your life will be lined up and be correct amen you don't have to worry about well you have as it were an enemy but God has taken care of that so as we are having a change in our thinking it starts to come and we're changing from the old man isn't that beautiful that we can change but you know what the old man came to church with us this morning the old man was aggravated at the car who come to the four-way after you and cuts you off and goes on and that bothers us still that's the old man but we're looking for renewing from that where you can look at that and as brother Branham talked about the little waitress that was doing so poorly we're not going to leave a tip for them and he says no no she's having a rough time you need to give you need to help her our thinking my brother and sister is so in the thinking of the old man that we don't often think about what any other circumstance might be and so we look at this now as we're moving forward on this where does our doubt come from it doesn't come from the new man it doesn't come to one who's been transformed our doubts and our fears come from the old man it comes from the man that's under the influence of the Fall it comes from the man that can only see what is directly in front of him you know there has been down in many many aspects of History we just go into this first second in any aspects of History whether it was science or different things there would be terms there would be men and women that would be called visionary and they looked beyond what the present was and they saw something greater and and they stepped out and pursued this other vision and and they look back in time and say you know they were a person born before their time or they were Visionary my brother and sister I'll tell you there's a bride on the Earth today that God has blessed and she is visionary she's not looking in this circumstance in this world right here does not dictate to her who she is and what her life will be but she's looking Beyond the Veil into the word and realizing oh this old man is still here but he's not my destiny he's not going to control who I am and I say God help you and I today to be Visionaries Amen to be able to catch the vision of the word for the hour not to be caught up that this is how I was raised this is a circumstance of my life then I'm going to be as it were my brother and sister you'll mind I was just looking at some stuff concerning Haiti heartbreaking circumstances and there is there in Haiti and they're talking to people in the slums and they are telling them nothing will ever change for me or my children or my children's children this is our future will they make progress to change their position but on the other side of Port-au-Prince is a family that says we're going to change and when the schools was doing nothing but a Congregation of kids and violent acts and gangs they said we'll teach our own children when they couldn't get food in the marketplace they said we'll grow our own and when our children leave the door their hair will be combed and their shirt will be tucked in because you will identify with you follow me so the old man is where doubt come from and why is it my brother and sister that when we come face to face with things of the word then oftentimes the very thing that comes to us first of the preaching of the word the reading of the word the hearing of the word and there's a doubt that slips in maybe it might be in the form of I've tried to live that but I can't seem to live it I I maybe I can't live it and and so why is it that always there's the negative comes in first it like floods in on us and and we're fighting and pushing back we'll hear the word being preached amen we're more than conquerors and we'll be thinking yeah well I wasn't a conqueror here I was in a conqueror here I wasn't a conqueror here I love the fact that Brother David brings out and when he come up to pray amen if our heart condemns us not amen but you see there's a side that comes in that we have been trained and schooled in such a fashion that because of the Fall we'll take it all the way back there we come and find ourselves having doubts and fears as some of the first things that rise up if you believe and don't doubt you can move this mountain and yet no heart we would say I I don't think I can move them out in our heart we'll battle with certain circumstances over and over and over again sometimes decades go by still battling this same battle and it's there that there's always that but why is it that we doubt first and then by God's grace we start pressing into the battle and slowly start claiming the victory when we could have stood in the very beginning and said victory is mine Satan get behind me but often that nature of humanity brings us in to the position here and then we battle to claim the victory we get the victory can we say Amen to that we can claim the victory but why is it we must battle is it the doubts of the world out here is it the doubts of the drunkard in the alley is it in the doubts of this person here and that person there it's our own doubts we must battle through our own doubt many a young person hope young people don't mind me preaching it this way this morning many young person finds themselves out in the world of the influence where people can just live any old way they want almost flippantly say oh I offended you I'm sorry and they just go on without a care it seems and here's a young man and a young woman wanting to serve God called of God and it seems like such a battle while the rest of the world lives Carefree but God called you to rise up maybe the doubt is there maybe the fear is there but God called you rise up and possess the land my brother and sister when Israel come in the days of Moses and then coming into the leadership of Joshua my brother and sister doubt would have been palatable doubt would have been you could have cut it with a knife doubt would have been so present amongst the people that it would be just seemingly as though it was a doctrine of Israel to doubt but God come and said I'm going to change this and he starts to speak to Joshua and he tells Joshua everything that I have promised my servant Moses you will bring it to pass my brother and sister everything the God promised to our prophet of the day and the word that come has come and many things people say the doubters say well that didn't come to pass that didn't come to pass did God put an expiration on it did God put a time lapse on it God put his time on it amen and a god of Eternity is not bound by days weeks months or years but he's Bound by I'm looking as we sang the song This Morning amen he looked down into eternity and says I see you and there's where you are not here not in this it's there but we're over here fighting our doubt we're fighting our fears and we're struggling amen now I hope you don't mind that I just kind of take this in a stronger fashion we take this correct position right in verse two he said me transformed by the renew of your mind that ye may prove you realize what our job is doing you hear my brother and sister we're proving amen we're proving the word of God you say but it's not me it's Christ in me amen Christ is in there he's proving it and we can stand here in this hour oh my brother and sister sometimes we find ourselves still struggling but God is proving what is good amen he's proving what is acceptable he is proving what is perfect it's his will amen and we are the manifestation of God's will because we cannot live in this life out of the will of God and expect to walk in his Blessing it's pretty simple walk in his will and he promised to bless us now blessing us is not is not a new shiny Corvette sister Jerry and I went to pick up a car at the mechanic shop and the previous owner which is the dad of our mechanic had this brand new Corvette sitting there in front of it and I looked at that you know there was a time in my life how can I be just blunt I lusted after those things oh I'm gonna own a Corvette one day but maybe it's the old creaky bones that you realize you've got to sit down this far off the ground then you've got to crawl out of that and I had a friend one day went and test drove one of them new modern sport type cars and he went to get out of it and he said I had to roll out on the ground and then stand up he says can you imagine honey we're gonna go out for dinner oh we look so cool as you roll out in the puddle at the parking lot my brother and sister you see God changes us and what we used to think was normal for our life and necessary for our life God is changing us because his perfect will and his will is not the world his will is his word and so God is proving his word in this hour through you and I if God did not want to use you and I some people believe no no that was for the prophet that's for this that's for that it really we're just the minions my brother and sister if that was the truth then God would have manifested all of the word of God through them but God is sitting here waiting for you and I to get out of our fear to get out of our doubt and come and say you know what this is worth fighting for this is worth standing up for and I'm going to amen and if you have to stand in front of the mirror and convince yourself on that then I say find a nice big mirror and stand there till you believe it amen now what is it we are going to prove the word amen the will is the word we're going to prove the word now you hear it all the time my brother and sister whether it's people that were around the message still around the message that have doubts and fears or just simply denominational Spirits you hear a common phraseology and and sometimes you we got to be careful about not taking the verbage and applying it directly it might just be words but many times you'll see that there's a point that they come and they say well the the bride of Christ is supposed to do this but somehow or another they withdraw themselves from that position as though it's another group of people maybe more spiritual than them that are going to fulfill that portion of the word of God my brother and sister the Bride As we read here this many membered body amen that we're all a member of is going to fulfill the word of God Amen it's not left for someone else it's not left for another time or season it's not left for a more spiritual people it's left to a people that make mistakes daily and have to repent daily it's mistakes that are made by people that the first instinct is I I need to pray for this person but would God hear my prayer maybe maybe I was just a little upset or angry or fussed or whatever here and would God hear my prayer because of that and those doubts start to come and then a still small voice I don't know if I go into music or not let's just put it this way volume does not equal anointing just because it's loud doesn't mean it's real amen now so he says here I want to dissect this another way that ye may prove what is that good now the word May means expression of possibility you see how God lets his word be brought in such a fashion that you can decide whether May means absolute or remote possibility we're sitting here this morning believing it's a remote possibility that we fulfill the word of God then you will only remotely try but if you are here today and read it like Paul reads it I am going to prove amen I'm not going to just try to prove I am going to prove and if doubt comes up first I will battle my way through doubt if fear comes up I will battle my way through fear if the enemy comes and stands before me I will battle my way through the enemy because I was called to prove the word of God and I will prove it amen Our God's an on-time God can we say Amen to that and so this bride is not just a possibility do you read anywhere in the word of God where it says they'll possibly be a bride take a rapture no sir it very clearly states it as an emphatic fact that there is going to be a people that he says we're not a people but are now my people and I'm going to expand that a little farther there was a people that didn't really have faith but now have my faith they don't have their own faith they don't have their own ability it's him amen and he is there telling him you are going to take my faith and you're going to release it and you are going to bring this to pass Hallelujah because I tell you what every time I've tried to do something on my own I think I've got it figured out Hallelujah amen I'm probably the little kid on the bicycle riding along there instead looking at the end like I should have been many times we're like hey everybody see how good I'm doing and then we crash and then the Devil comes and says see you're not even a Christian and we identify with that but then we have to push our way back through that and realize no I am I just allowed the world to distract me you know God's more gracious than this world is policemen following you you cross over the white line three times he pulls you over and gives you a ticket for distracted driving God allows you to cross over the line many times and then he just keeps reminding you get back in mind get back in life now as we look at this I need to hurry on amen see we're not just a possibility the word says we're already been made more than conquerors can we say Amen to that today amen now look what the word does is we read the Bible with any kind of revelation we realize amen the Bible proves that we recall amen we should not one of us be sitting here this morning with a doubt that it's God that's calling us amen and so if the world's calling you my brother and sister you'll find you know I I knew this individual I know this individual and uh you know I hadn't seen him for a while and when I run into them the next time they've got a tattoo from their wrist bone all the way up to their collarbone and and uh you know Paul being so diplomatic like I am I just said um you realize you just poisoned half to your liver and he's like what are you talking about and I said the ink from that tattoo your body's trying to digest that ink oh it can't be a big deal or else they would have told me do you see the devil putting disclaimers on everything no sir he glamorizes and glorifies and blows it up in neon lights my brother and sister the devil has put the warning in so fine a print you can't read it and he focuses everything away from that but what does God do he comes and gives us the whole picture amen and I could elaborate onto this but I don't want us to be too long today amen so the word of God proves that we're called amen it proves that we've been redeemed by the blood amen these These are the the unbeliever my brother and sister he might say it proves nothing well that's because his eyes are closed he's not behind the veil and the word proves that every tenet it proves every tenet of Christianity do you realize my brother and sister there's even Muslim uh theologians if you'd call them whatever they they term their holy men that acknowledge that the Bible expounds on the basic tenets of life much greater than their writings their writings are all rules the Bible is life you read every line and if you read it as rules you need to read it again amen need to pray for understanding and the Lord is using you to do it why didn't he have some great holy man the impeccable life the Untouchable life the life so far above reproach but God says you know what I'm going to use you I'm going to let you prove my word I'm going to let you and I've said this many times here in the church and I believe it with all of my heart my brother and sister it was not the signs and wonders people argue over these things it was not the signs and wonders and discernments of the Prophet that Vindicated his ministry I'm convinced of this it is you sitting here today living out what he preached and how he opened the word of God and there's a living testimony of what he said this word will produce my brother and sister there was many preachers in those days that discern the Hearts and Spirits and called out and there was healings and all of those things right because we recognized as it was the whole deal about the fishing and the line and all of that we realize what happened there but you look at that and say okay now I just challenge you to go study this and find who or what they produced find what they produce today many churches I won't call out names but we've been rubbed elbows with for years and now today they're just they allowed this they don't want this group to leave they've allowed this they don't want that group to leave allow this allow this allow this my brother and sister it's all around us almost every religion that ever had the name Holiness associated with it is no longer holiness but the bride adorned in the word is not moving to the world but she's moving to Christ her wedding day has come she's standing there in the presence of God and she wants to look her best I'm telling you there's not much of a bride that would come into the church to get married that day in a ratty wedding gown she decided to go for a jog in the park she decided to go walk down the alleys of that's it no my brother and sister there's something wrong with that so we look and see how this bride of Christ she is concerned about the very smudge on the Hem of her garment not going the other way how much can I cut away of my garment but how do I keep my garment clean amen so it's there the Lord asks you to do it now this is God's will and I've got it right here for you in case you don't know what his will is many times Saints I just want to put it out to you kind of strong today many times we come ask the preacher I need an answer if we actually just stop ask the Lord to show us pick up our Bible start reading you'll find the answer God put Ministry God put men as as help and and these kind of things but I'm telling you how thorough God's plan works is that if we will pray and read our Bible that we will be led right to the answer to our problem do we have doubts sometimes let's all be honest we have doubts you know it's interesting I was thinking about this the other day When We Were Young I seen a little video clip of some young men it's back east in a church group outing these young men are scrambling up these rocks like mountain goats and somebody at the bottom they never did show them but I can only assume that they probably were a little older be careful laughs as these young men scramble up the rocks and it took me back in time I used to do that now I just stand at the bottom be careful because you see we come into a place if we're not careful if we don't conquer fear fear conquers us and if we don't conquer doubts then doubt Will Conquer us reminds me I know this kind of blunt forgive me for putting it this way but a gentleman that I've known some what for many years said well I always had doubts about the message and it struck me that's why today you believe half of it's true and half of its false because you never dealt with the doubts back here they stayed there and when we allow doubt to grow doubt doesn't just stay at church doubt comes along and says I probably made a mistake here I probably made a mistake here and you'll see people radically change their lives make just ridiculous decisions and it all comes back to a doubt because they doubt it what God did for them in the beginning that's right amen we read of the promises and sometimes we struggle a little bit as I referenced speaking to the mountain my brother and sister I remember a brother one time said you know I just don't know about that scripture I don't think it applies to us because I was out in the woods one time and I just I was there and I just said okay Mountain be moved come on mountain move I'm waiting God for this mountain to move it never moved but the problem is he was amiss he was trying to make God prove his word is God to be mocked no but you see to approach it that way there had to be a doubt somewhere in the recesses of the mind that this would really apply I like how brother Donnie Reagan put it he said now you could go out today we could dismiss church and we'd go find us a mountain over here somewhere if you can find one in Tennessee and um you know we go out there and tell the mountain to be moved and nothing's going to happen and many people are going to walk away and say even our pastor tell the mountain to move and it didn't move but brother Donnie says you come in a time of need you come in a time that is important and you're sincere and you would speak to this mountain oh it's figurative maybe it is figurative but if you needed to move a real mountain and you were desperate and you spoke to it in the name of Jesus Christ I personally believe the mountain will move but as long as we come with a doubt a question mark that right there just nullifies everything you know my brother and sister a lot of examples we could give and all of them take time but you look at this the word in you cannot produce anything less than God In the Flesh today not one thing less can it it has to produce that the word cannot return void now if we have a doubt that the word can return void then all of the word will return void because you nullified it with your doubts but if you can stand there in faith and believe that this word called you that you are Son of God your daughter of God and the word has called you to this position then you can stand in complete confidence now we talk about that you know uh some people think that Fox's book of Martyrs sister Jerry's over there yes yes because I half the time mispronounce that mortars you know yeah well I don't know due to miss Dynamite maybe it is mortars but you read that my brother and sister and when you have Believers in the Dark Ages willingly walk to the Post they're not dragging them kicking and screaming and they put them in pile the wood around them and light it on fire and then they sing songs glorifying God as they burn to death doubt will not allow you to do that you must have Rock Solid Faith this is who I am and if this is what God called me to then here am I Lord amen amen you see we're here my brother and sister to do great things but sometimes we have to take care of the simple things first I was just reading a little little webinar type thing the other day and somebody wrote into this minister do we really have to repent if you believe your Bible you do otherwise if you don't give your Bible you'd read the repent but when nothing happens another man also says I tried that religion thing and I prayed and I prayed but God never answered so I left who was that buddy uh buddy Robinson Lord if you don't come you don't change me you're going to find my bones laying here in this field what a difference yeah I knocked God never answered I left Lord if you don't come you're just going to find my bones here what a light years apart one of faith one of doubt they doubted God would answer from the very beginning and they got exactly what they expected having said that sometimes we have doubts can we be honest enough yeah amen we read the promises then we struggle a little to see that promise fulfilled and have you ever been hesitant now take this in the natural take it in the spiritual have you ever been hesitant to apply something because there was just something nagging at you that it it wouldn't work you know I mean I I had a friend use some kind of JB Weld water patch and he's like that's been on there for 10 years I'm standing in the hardware store well they want 25 for this stuff and I don't know if it's going to work or not it worked for him but it might not work for me I'm not gonna I'm not gonna waste of 25 dollars so what did I do I just drilled a hole through there and put a deal on the outside with silicone and a bolt and a deal on the inside not cranked it down it's ugly but it worked I have confidence in that thing but you see he had confidence in JB Weld water patch it's what we have confidence in Saints we have confidence in the world then we we we take the world's opinion we have confidence in God we take God amen it's that simple now no this is not the most exciting sermon today but I felt like I needed to preach it amen Hallelujah maybe we're a hesitant to apply it and and um you know that doubt look Saint doubt is not God's doubt amen so where'd it come from if there's only two spirits in the church if there's doubt where did the doubt come from now in Luke 11 uh it's quite a lengthy scripture here uh so we're going to just go through it real quickly uh amen we'll go down and jump right down to verse 5 there and uh I'm I'm not going to read everything here we're going to just preach this out and man so here's Zacharias Amen in the course of time here Zacharias is a very righteous man his wife Elizabeth is a very righteous sister and they had no children and so Elizabeth is barren and they're getting up in years and it comes to pass that while he's doing his duty regardless of everything else in his life he is doing his duty he's performing it well amen and his job was to be there at the altar of incense and and so it's there that all of a sudden is standing there is an angel of the Lord standing right there with him and I believe you know that it would trouble us too it would catch us off guard that here is here's an angel standing right here and all of a sudden he's like okay and and fear fell upon him and he was you know wondering what's happening and the angel says to him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard now what prayer is this Zacharias no doubt had more prayers than Lord bless us with a child but that was a prayer that God chose to honor and you'll find that in that many other prayers of Zacharias would have been answered also and thy wife shall bear thee a son and you shall call his name John and you'll have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth and I Rejoice at John's birth amen for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn into the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias and turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord and Zechariah said unto the angel now this isn't some great glaring I don't believe you but he just says whereby shall I know this for I am an old man and my wife is well stricken in years you see those simple words were laced with doubt he's just heard an angel of the Lord and he's like I don't think this can happen and the angel answers him I can see it now maybe very direct I am Gabriel that stands in the presence of God and I'm sent to speak unto thee and to show thee he's glad tidings and behold Thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words so he's being rebuked this is a point I want you to catch he's being rebuked for his unbelief but God's promise still stands you see the word of God says there will be many who don't enter in because of their unbelief but here when God is dealing with his own he says you know what you're going to pay a price for your unbelief but this promise still stands amen your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you'll have days that you'll have doubt will it cost you yes it will cost you but God is not going to take the promise away from you some people say well you know you sinned away your day of Grace if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ God will make you pay a price for the unbelief but we'll never take the promise from you amen and he said here it shall be filled fulfilled in their season now my brother and sister I don't know about you but I read that and I get excited amen because there's times I just have doubts there's times that I'm like I'm not called to do this I can't do this if God wanted something really good to happen he would have got somebody else to do it so I you know and by brother and sister when you look at that you realize the devil has been talking and we have been listening now planting the vine and where to plant it amen now look at this so you can't mix up oil and water and make it work right it's got to either be water or oil and God is still the same God we got a religion that mixes up and says God was once did this and doesn't do it today then we're trying to put all in water together the scripture said he is the same yesterday today and forever it just won't mix with unbelief Faith won't we have faith in God it's Eternal unbelief has always been since the Garden of Eden God has always wanted his people to believe this he wanted them to have confidence and to show himself among his people God is a spirit amen amen if you have confidence in God Amen my brother and sister what is it you've got to get rid of the unbelief you've got to get all of that out of it amen and move on let me move on so we can finish here in a moment amen I put it this way Zacharias did not intentionally not believe but it was that old man it was like I don't mean to be Christ but we're now old and we've been trying to have children for many years and now you're telling me in our old age we're going to have children I have no no reference Siri how many old people have children it has been known to happen and Gabriel says you're not even going to be able to speak I'll tell you what to do I'm not going to let you go this is Paul's take on it okay I hope you don't mind but I'm not going to let you go out there and people say what happened in there well I met Gabriel everybody be like you met Gabriel aren't you just pouring incense on the Fire I met Gabriel he said Elizabeth and I were going to have a child I really don't see how it could happen I kind of questioned this you know I mean I just don't know what it'd be because you guys know you've prayed for us we've had prayer requests in the church for all these years and we've never had a child I just don't see how that could really happen no God says you know what you got that little seeded out right there you haven't conquered yet and so I'm just going to make it so you can't even speak and that way you cannot express what's roaring around in your mind not what's in his heart Zacharias was faithful the scripture says him and Elizabeth were righteous people if he would have looked at the heart his answer would have been entirely different but he looked at the mind and said oh how can this happen so I'll just silence you for a while and you know if he wrote on the page I met Gabriel there's just no way he could put the same expression come on there's a lot of difference take a page sit down and write I am afraid it does not have the same impact on you is when your own voice comes forth and says I am afraid write on a page I doubt nothing like the impact it comes when your own voice says I doubt I believe hear your own voice I believe there's something about opening our mouth and speaking hallelujah what are we doing we're planting the seeds of faith we're planting the word when we speak that out or Worse plant planting the terror so it's there amen hey come my brother and sister it's not that he he really questioned that he didn't intentionally not believe but that old man was there and so it's there that that was the first response and that's what I was talking about earlier sometimes our very first response then we have to go and fight our way through that this is the word amen but in the back of the mind there's something saying it's not for you it's not for you it's not for you then you have to go and press through that that's right amen now brother Brandon and letting off the pressure I'm going to skip over some stuff here and letting off the pressure brother Branham says here finally let's talk about an eagle amen when he gets weary all of his feathers are getting loose so he cannot fly very high anymore then he goes he goes High into the mountains until he finds a certain Rock and then he sits at that rock now the job is that he's got to beat his head against that rock until that crust flies off amen and they say he will beat and beat and beat until his head will bleed he will almost knock himself out and he will come back and beat again until all the crust is gone and when all that cross goes off his head though he's bleeding and wounded he's got the Assurance he will rise up raise up and flop what feather he's got and scream out he lets off the pressure why he knows as soon as all that crust is gone he's going to renew his life again he gets renewed again new life is sure to come when all the crust is gone and let me put this in here as a reminder real life true stories not religion this is life my brother and sister when this Eagle is going through this stage of life there's another eagle bringing fresh meat well I don't know where did they all go I guess they're just aren't Christians they're not believers no you know while they were trying to beat the scale off of their own head right amen greatest battle ever fought that's right sometimes we've got to find a rock and we got a beat until that scale falls off right do we let him starve to death we shouldn't we shouldn't if nothing the least we should be is just praying our hearts out and when I think how great a God is to be mindful of his ego to give that eagle a way to renew his life when he's old the only thing he has to do is beat the crust off and that's a great thing oh I know another rock that a man can beat the crust of the world off there until un every unbelief has dropped in every shadow and every Fetter has dropped until he's got the world beat out of him all the unbelief beat out of him all the pride beat out of him all the starch beat out of him then new life is sure to come then you can let off the Steam and just start rejoicing because new life is sure to come as long as you can beat the unbelief out of you not the preacher beating it out see there's such an emphasis my brother and sister that people think somebody's going to do this for me but here is in these simple words of the Prophet taking it and putting it into place I to each one of us here including myself today we've got to find that rock somebody can't find the rock for us and somebody can go beat on that rock and it won't do you a bit of good but you've got to be willing to let yourself beat yourself on the Rock Amen Hallelujah there's recorded there's an area in New York where the Eagles gather and they've set up cameras there to film all of this and my brother and sister there are eagles now if this isn't life I don't know what is I'm closing there's Eagles that fly there it's a great congregation area of eagles and there literally will be Eagles that fly there and they flew there but they never fly again and they stand over there and other eagles can fly right up and drop a nice big chunk of meat right in front of them and they won't touch it and other eagles around them are over there beating their beak and all of that growth that comes up and starts to cover they're over there within steps beating their head on the rock and this eagle does nothing and I'm going to just kind of put it this way day by day week by week year by year this eagle gets weaker until one day it dies and people say what happened what happened we could go for another couple hours on that but I tell you that an eagle that's anointed you know they've got some of those Eagles that they they have mapped out their ages I don't know how they do all that stuff but they're very old at one point in time there was an eagle that they had kept records on that they believed had been around when George Washington tomorrow it's pretty old eagle it's been back a few years you know maybe in my childhood but look at this my brother and sister what happened the eagle that was willing to go beat his head on the rock see brother Branham didn't just make this story up this is real that's right this is real the eagle that's willing to beat his head on the Rock and beat all the unbelief out of himself and all the doubts and all the fears is going to renew his strength and go on and live but if they won't that growth of the beak do you know part of the issue of why they don't go ahead and eat you say well the beak has screwed up but what happens is is that young Tinder those of you ever nailed your thumb to the wall you know believe it or not hiding down there's another thumbnail and underneath that beak is another beak Desiring to be free and they start to separate an eagle can't actually write because they're called rippers of Flesh and he can't rip flesh because now he's he's got this separation in there and he can't really rip the flesh and then he can't eat let's see cares of life the world all the things of the world why it's got to be broke it's got to be separated from us we're not going to devise a you know a a way to feed the eagle so he can just go on in his present condition no God provided the rock that's right and the Instinct in the eagle to go to that rock and I think it's such a beautiful type because it's not just any Rock they gather they gather together and there's something about that place can you imagine an eagle conversation Sister Sarah will you come you imagine the eagle conversation this is The Rock my grandpa beat his head on and grandpa said great grandpa and great great grandpa beat their head on this rock now look how it is for us as Sons and Daughters of God help us that our children and our children's children would be able to say my grandpa my great grandpa beat his head on this rock amen amen and that's why our family is what our family is because the rock breaks away everything you know as we look at this and realize Zacharias all that had happened amen God give them one child give them late in life gave him a child that was considered at the time a wild man [Music] I probably think that sometimes Elizabeth probably went Lord would you bless me with you know I'm trying to fix these good meals for my son and he's out here eating Locust he's getting stung while he's digging the honey out of the Rock what kind of wild man he disappears for days on end out in the woods my brother and sister he wasn't wearing a three-piece suit and one day just went on a skin and went out in the wilderness that was his nature amen Elizabeth God tempered her because he knew what he was giving her and knew what the job was it wasn't about Elizabeth it was about the calling placed on John's life I'm thankful for John's calling amen he was one of a man of Courage amen now look at this you go a little farther in Luke right there same chapter and here's Mary we didn't get there today here's Mary almost the same words [Music] but look at the after response she's like how is this going to happen to me it seems how I've never known a man [Music] and the response is be it unto me [Music] understand this be it unto me though let the word come to pass in me be it unto me amen I'll stop at that right there because we could just go on hallelujah amen just amazing to me how the response is not that far removed from each other God doesn't take a promise away from Zacharias but he silences him and what does he do gives voice to Mary and the courage that while the whole world sorry I hope this is not too straightforward while the whole world fought that she had been a promiscuous young woman that she had something to hide something to do and Mary wasn't silent you see Mary lived right in her community after the Holy Ghost come to her amen and it started to produce Jesus Christ now God help us not to be silent in our neighborhood not to have to move out or whatever but let it be according to your word Lord if this is you Lord then it will be and no one you know the song says you know I ought to know I was there when it happened I had to know amen they might have looked at Mary like they did but she was the one that was reminded by her own words when she said be it unto me she said I'm willing to Bear the reproach I'm willing to be this oh Hallelujah be it unto me let's just stand and sing that song Amen Hallelujah 7 12 brother brother brother Gideon I actually just as I finished up there in the office come to me amen probably just sing the chorus [Music] be it unto me according to your word according to promises I can stand for you are upon my heart the truth that sets me free [Music] according to your word O Lord [Music] eat unto me [Music] according to your word according to your promises [Music] the truth that sets me free according to your foreign [Music] amen father of life Seated on your throne of grace Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen as I was reading my Bible the other day this out of Luke just spoke to me I just had to share that from my heart you know sometimes I just wished I could preach as good as I do in the tractor you know it always seems to be so inspired there it comes just flows but still it's the same word it's the same God that wrote it amen same God that's bringing it to pass so whether I can do it perfectly or not shouldn't be whether it's good for us or not amen hallelujah oh Father Of Life sitting on your throne it's only by your mercy we all sing Oh Lord you have said if we call upon yours are we and our family would they say oh Lord oh so we cry out your name is [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] side [Music] Jesus Christ father of Love Never failing to foreign [Music] until the day you take us all the way so I Cry I'll join me [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] Jesus Christ so we cry our name he'll shed eyes [Music] you realize [Music] round and pray Lord [Music] Jesus Christ isn't it good to be a Christian today Amen to realize my brother and sister even in our moments of doubt promise still stands it is still a certain promise a promise we can anchor amen Our Lives all I can say is this thank you Lord thank you Lord for your word thank you Lord 144 as we would close the lovely name of Jesus [Music] what [Music] somebody help me please [Music] oh oh it's sweet and the songs they sing in him [Music] sing first one again you're dismissed a reaching fire of all in the brightest always [Music] hey manager dismissed just turn to
