[33:40] gathered in your name that you would be
[33:43] here father and you are here tonight
[33:45] Lord Jesus and that is what makes the
[33:47] difference Lord Lord that is why we come
[33:51] here as why we don't go to the Baptist
[33:53] Church or to the Lutheran Church or to
[33:55] the Catholic
[33:56] Church father because that's not where
[33:58] you are Lord but you are here tonight
[34:01] father not that this building holds a
[34:04] specialness father but Lord your word is
[34:07] here father I look out across the
[34:09] congregation and I see you Lord Jesus
[34:12] manifested in your bride and father that
[34:15] is why we come here Lord Jesus father
[34:18] thank you for your presence tonight Lord
[34:20] Jesus may you speak to our hearts
[34:23] tonight may you take these words Lord
[34:24] these simple words that you have laid on
[34:26] my heart May they not be tied with my
[34:28] opinions Lord my own thoughts but Lord I
[34:32] would be stepped out of the way
[34:34] completely Lord Jesus that you could
[34:35] come and speak to us father that is our
[34:38] desire tonight Lord I desire as well to
[34:41] hear from you Lord Jesus we thank you
[34:43] Lord we commit ourselves into your hands
[34:45] in your precious name we pray the name
[34:47] of Jesus Christ
[34:50] amen amen it's good to be here tonight
[34:53] thank you
[34:54] musicians amen why don't we stand
[35:05] you can show that first slide and then
[35:06] we'll just stay there for a little bit
[35:09] um my title tonight is fear is a liar
[35:13] amen and my subtitle is Faith is the
[35:16] antidote psalms
[35:20] 27 I know we have a joke in the take
[35:23] house that when things start to go Ry my
[35:26] wife looks at me and says about to
[35:28] preach aren't
[35:30] you and it's
[35:32] funny I'm sure our pastor and Brother
[35:35] David get testify to this that you go
[35:36] through something and God has you preach
[35:38] about it and then that it means a little
[35:40] more to you
[35:43] personally and so uh I had to deal with
[35:46] some fear and uh it's funny what it does
[35:49] to you Psalms
[35:53] 27:1 the Lord is my light and my
[35:56] salvation Whom Shall I fear the lord is
[35:59] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[36:01] be afraid when the wicked even mine
[36:03] enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat
[36:06] up my flesh they stumbled and fell
[36:08] though an host should encamp against me
[36:10] my heart shall not fear though War
[36:12] should rise against me in this will I be
[36:15] confident one thing have I desired of
[36:18] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[36:20] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[36:22] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[36:24] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[36:27] for the time of trouble he shall hide me
[36:29] in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[36:31] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[36:34] me up upon a rock may the Lord add a
[36:37] blessing to the reading of his word he
[36:38] may be seated
[36:40] tonight praise the Lord that's the
[36:43] um opening scripture that brother
[36:45] brandom uses when he preaches the
[36:47] Rapture and um that's perfect for the
[36:51] bride of Christ in the day that we live
[36:53] in amen that there is nothing that the
[36:56] Lord is our life and our Salvation Whom
[36:59] Shall We Fear and mean that encompasses
[37:02] everything the Lord is the strength of
[37:04] our life amen if you want to turn with
[37:07] me to Luke chapter
[37:13] 8 Luke chapter 8 verse 8 while you're
[37:17] turning I'm going to take my jacket off
[37:38] Luke 8 verse
[37:44] 22 now it came to pass on a certain day
[37:47] that he went into a ship with his
[37:49] disciples and he said unto them let us
[37:51] go over unto the other side of the lake
[37:53] and they launched forth but as they
[37:55] sailed sailed he fell asleep and there
[37:59] came down a storm of wind on the lake
[38:01] and they were fil filled with water and
[38:04] were in Jeopardy and they came to him
[38:06] and awoke him saying master master we
[38:08] perish then he rose and rebuked the wind
[38:10] and the Raging of the water and they
[38:13] ceased and there was calm and he said
[38:15] unto them where is your faith and they
[38:18] being afraid wondered saying one to
[38:20] another what manner of man is this for
[38:22] he commandeth even the winds and water
[38:25] and they obey him
[38:39] sorry amen praise the Lord amen so here
[38:42] we have the disciples on the sea and I
[38:45] thought it was interesting that we sing
[38:47] The Haven of Rest amen and there is no
[38:49] coincidence
[38:51] it there is none of that in the kingdom
[38:53] of God with God and um we are living in
[38:57] the Haven of Rest am and so the
[39:01] disciples
[39:03] here were on the Sea of
[39:07] Galilee and
[39:10] um Jesus has asked them to take him to
[39:13] go across to the other side of the lake
[39:15] that they call it and in the middle of
[39:17] this Jesus falls asleep and I don't know
[39:22] if any of you have ever been on the
[39:23] ocean in big waves but um that's no joke
[39:27] I've uh we took I was a young kid so I
[39:30] was kind of oblivious to the fear and I
[39:33] thought it was the coolest thing ever
[39:34] but we took a jetbat out uh out of
[39:37] Whittier Alaska into the ocean and on
[39:39] the way back it was sunny but it was
[39:40] windy and we were dealing with six foot
[39:43] swells and that's a big thing when you
[39:46] can't see over the wave in front of you
[39:48] and your boat's feeling like awfully
[39:50] small and with every Crest water would
[39:53] Splash over the side and into the boat
[39:55] me and my buddy thought it was the
[39:56] coolest thing ever but my dad and his
[39:58] dad were freaking
[40:00] out but we made it okay it was just fine
[40:03] but he had to take every every wave uh
[40:07] gently and uh when he come to the other
[40:09] side it was with a crash and so um the
[40:13] there it says here that their their boat
[40:14] was filled with water didn't say there
[40:16] was a little bit of water it says it was
[40:18] filled so they were on the point of
[40:19] sinking when they woke up Jesus and when
[40:22] Jesus wakes up he asks them where is
[40:24] your faith perhaps they were puzzled at
[40:27] the this question um and not sure what
[40:30] he meant at the time but I'm sure later
[40:32] on as the Revelation grew they
[40:34] understood what the problem was is that
[40:36] they were experiencing fear because of a
[40:39] lack of faith and fear had told them
[40:42] that the waves were going to seek them
[40:44] fear had told them that there was
[40:45] nothing that they were going to be able
[40:47] to do they couldn't fight against the
[40:49] weather and it was going to be the end
[40:51] of their lies that's what fear said but
[40:53] fear is a liar and that's not the
[40:55] outcome of the story The of the story is
[40:58] that Christ who is our faith amen spoke
[41:02] to the storm and brought calm to the
[41:05] Sea amen praise the Lord and from that
[41:09] they sailed out on the smooth seas and
[41:11] they were astonished at what happened
[41:14] and they were like wow this guy can even
[41:17] talk to the storms the winds and the
[41:18] rain and they obey him have you ever
[41:21] seen a storm stopping that
[41:25] fast so okay brother David has praise
[41:28] the Lord I got to hear that testimony
[41:30] sometime amen but God can do it we've
[41:33] heard testimonies apparently there's one
[41:35] in our midst of God doing just that very
[41:39] thing but what does it take it takes
[41:41] faith and faith is the opposite of fear
[41:44] because fear brings doubt but faith is
[41:47] the antidote and I'm here to say tonight
[41:48] that fear is a liar amen Matthew chapter
[41:54] 14 tonight we are
[41:59] uh I'm I'm the coach and we're in
[42:03] halftime and we're getting a pep talk
[42:06] tonight middle of the
[42:09] week praise God we'll preach it right
[42:11] into
[42:14] Sunday Matthew Chapter
[42:17] 14 verse
[42:19] 22 and straightway Jesus constrained his
[42:22] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[42:24] before him unto the other side while he
[42:26] sent the multitud udes
[42:38] away praise the Lord I wonder if this is
[42:41] after the one we just read or before it
[42:45] that's your homework so maybe maybe it's
[42:47] the second time and he's giving them
[42:49] another chance so he sends them out and
[42:52] verse 23 and when he had sent the
[42:54] multitude away he went up into a
[42:56] mountain apart to PR and when the
[42:58] evening was come he was there alone but
[43:00] the ship was now in the midst of the sea
[43:02] tossed with waves for the W wind was
[43:05] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[43:07] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[43:10] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[43:12] walking on the sea they were troubled
[43:13] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[43:16] for fear but straightway Jesus spake
[43:18] unto them saying be of good cheer it is
[43:22] I Be not
[43:23] Afraid amen you remember as a child if
[43:26] you were afraid and and you it was quiet
[43:29] in the house and it was a it was night
[43:31] time you'd heard a noise the wind was
[43:33] blowing against the window panes and and
[43:35] there was just something that spooked
[43:37] you that scared you and then you hear
[43:38] your dad's voice you relax hey it's okay
[43:42] Dad's here I remember times I would wake
[43:45] up in the middle of the night and I
[43:45] would be afraid and then I would hear my
[43:47] dad clear his throat and prop his
[43:49] recliner up cuz he used to get up in the
[43:50] middle of the night and he had to he'd
[43:51] have to sit up for a little bit he'd
[43:52] prop his recliner up and I'd be like hey
[43:54] everything's cool I'm going back to
[43:55] sleep just the sound of the father
[43:58] brought peace amen so here here's Jesus
[44:02] man the father he gives us out the voice
[44:04] be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid
[44:07] amen aren't you glad that you heard that
[44:09] in this day and age that we live in amen
[44:11] there is a lot of fear Amen in the world
[44:14] around us 28 and Peter answered him and
[44:17] said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto
[44:20] thee on the water and he said come and
[44:22] when Peter was come down out of the ship
[44:24] he walked on the water to go to Jesus
[44:27] two fears it's a spirit it's not a
[44:30] spirit it's Jesus amen now Peter says
[44:32] well if it's you let me come to you on
[44:34] the water so Peter steps out in faith
[44:36] because he heard the call of the father
[44:38] of he heard the call of Christ he heard
[44:40] the voice and he followed the voice out
[44:42] into the water and he and he began to
[44:44] walk upon the Water to Jesus but when he
[44:47] saw the wind boisterous he was
[44:53] afraid and beginning to sink he cried
[44:56] saying Lord save me and immediately
[44:59] Jesus stretched forth his hand and
[45:00] caught him and said unto him oh thou of
[45:03] little faith wherefor didst thou doubt
[45:07] you would think to yourself Peter just
[45:08] walked on water he how could he be a man
[45:11] of little faith but you see it wasn't
[45:13] the walking on the water it was when he
[45:16] saw the storm when he looked around him
[45:19] at at what was happening amen and he
[45:21] thought he thought to himself well this
[45:24] this this this anointing this power that
[45:26] that is that has has me on the water is
[45:28] not strong enough to overcome what is
[45:31] the storm that is around me it's not
[45:33] strong enough to defeat the waves and
[45:34] the and the wind and so he began to fear
[45:37] and when he began to fear amen that
[45:40] doubt took over and he began to sink
[45:42] into the water but he was just
[45:46] fine he was okay because fear is a liar
[45:50] and so you I mean here the here's these
[45:54] the disciples in the middle of the ocean
[45:56] see sorry it's not the
[45:58] ocean um in the dark middle of the night
[46:01] and there's this person walking across
[46:02] the water I would spook you be honest
[46:05] with me
[46:06] tonight and they they found out it was
[46:08] Jesus fear said that's a spirit that's a
[46:11] ghost of some kind but fear was a liar
[46:13] and it was not it was Christ it was
[46:15] Jesus walking to them Amen brother
[46:18] brandham says and I apologize I didn't
[46:20] get this quote to him but um Jehovah
[46:23] Gyra number 3 1964 he says today people
[46:26] people are something on the order like
[46:29] they was in the days when the disciples
[46:31] Was Out on the Ocean and one night a
[46:34] storm came up and there wasn't nothing
[46:36] all hopes was gone that they ever be
[46:38] saved and they seen him come walking on
[46:41] the water now their ship was water
[46:43] logged and the sails were broke and the
[46:46] ores were gone and they were holding one
[46:49] another screaming and they looked out
[46:51] there and seen him coming walking on the
[46:53] water and was scared of him their only
[46:56] hope and they were afraid of the only
[46:57] thing that could save them if that ain't
[47:00] a true picture today again amen and
[47:03] we'll just we'll just bunny trail off of
[47:06] that isn't that a truth when people hear
[47:09] the truth the truth know the truth and
[47:11] the truth shall set you free when they
[47:14] hear the truth the spirits that they are
[47:16] bound with begin to tremble in fear and
[47:19] they become afraid like he says here the
[47:21] very thing that can save
[47:24] them amen it's like someone perched on a
[47:27] a cliff you know they they're just hey
[47:29] look this is cool and they're standing
[47:31] on the edge and they get gripped by fear
[47:32] and they can't even move someone comes
[47:35] along to try to help them and they don't
[47:37] touch me don't touch me I'm going to
[47:39] fall don't touch me that's the very
[47:40] thing that could save them or someone's
[47:42] drowning and so what do they do they
[47:44] climb on top of the person that's trying
[47:45] to help them cuz fear had taken over
[47:48] amen and when fear takes over it's in
[47:50] the natural when fear takes over some
[47:52] someone they lose all ability to think
[47:54] rationally amen and when fear takes you
[47:56] over over spiritually you lose all
[47:58] ability to think rationally to Think
[48:01] Through the the the the Holy Spirit our
[48:03] filter amen when you allow fear to take
[48:06] over what you're facing what you're what
[48:08] you're dealing with and then you begin
[48:10] to forget the promises of God because
[48:13] now your faith is being replaced with
[48:15] doubt but I'm here to remind you tonight
[48:18] that fear is a liar amen so he goes on
[48:21] to say he says they thought it looked
[48:23] spooky you know they said they cried out
[48:24] for fear it's a spirit it looked too
[48:27] like spiritual that's the same thing it
[48:29] is today but if you'll just do like they
[48:33] did when they cried out they heard that
[48:35] voice coming fear not it is I Be not
[48:38] Afraid be of a good courage and if
[48:41] you'll just watch The Word of Promise
[48:42] for this day you'll hear that same voice
[48:45] speaking through the word it's me I
[48:47] promise to do this in the last days fear
[48:50] not don't be scared put your trust in me
[48:54] the Son of God who he is believe it now
[48:59] amen they were frightened they were
[49:02] afraid but the voice said be of good
[49:04] cheer be of good courage do not be
[49:08] afraid notice that's how first thing he
[49:10] said he didn't say be afraid first first
[49:12] he said be
[49:14] happy you're in the middle of a storm
[49:17] right the waves are cresting over the
[49:20] side of the boat your sail's useless
[49:22] your engine to your boats shot blew a
[49:25] hole out the side of it
[49:28] you're going nowhere you go to grab the
[49:30] ores guess what you forgot them there's
[49:33] no ores in the boat there's nothing you
[49:35] can do you're frightened you're freaking
[49:38] out and this thing on the water says be
[49:43] happy guess
[49:46] what those disciples were the elect of
[49:49] God you are the elect of God tonight and
[49:53] sometimes the Lord comes along and
[49:55] before he even tries to calm you down
[49:57] and and then tell you to not be afraid
[49:59] he says look you need to be happy amen
[50:02] be happy what is there to be happy
[50:05] about they said well it is I Be not
[50:08] Afraid amen that's what they thought
[50:10] what is there to be why are we going to
[50:11] be of good cheer excuse me whatever you
[50:14] are out there on the water do you know
[50:16] what's going on around you are you aware
[50:18] of what's Happening you want us to be of
[50:20] good cheer but then the voice said it's
[50:22] I be not
[50:24] afraid it is I
[50:28] amen be of good cheer it is I he didn't
[50:30] have to say it's Jesus right right he
[50:33] didn't have to say it's it's it's it's
[50:36] Jesus of Nazareth it's it's it's Mary's
[50:39] son it's the son of Joseph it's it's the
[50:43] Messiah it's it's me the Jesus of Na he
[50:47] didn't have to say any of that he said
[50:49] it is I and they knew instantly who it
[50:52] was why why because that the natural
[50:55] typing of the spiritual we know the
[50:56] voice because my sheep know my voice my
[51:00] sheep know my voice amen and when you
[51:02] hear the voice of the shepherd amen it
[51:05] erases the fear that you are
[51:07] experiencing praise the Lord but
[51:10] sometimes amen we have
[51:13] to the Lord fights your battles for you
[51:15] the Lord gives you courage to fight
[51:18] sometimes you have to fight against that
[51:19] fear and you have to know the truths of
[51:23] the word of God to fight against that
[51:25] fear not every time did my did my dad
[51:28] take that fear from me I had to fight
[51:31] that fear now why did I how could I do
[51:33] that because of what I was taught amen
[51:36] so God gives you all the strength all of
[51:38] the Holy Spirit everything you need to
[51:40] face the day and age that we live in but
[51:42] sometimes he says walk by faith against
[51:44] that fear and man sometimes he comes
[51:46] along miraculously and he says it is I
[51:49] be not afraid but he has given you the
[51:51] ability to fight against the Demons of
[51:54] this world and that is fear is a l
[51:57] praise the Lord and tonight we are being
[51:59] reminded of that
[52:01] amen well I think it was Sunday a pastor
[52:04] was was ministering and then it's funny
[52:07] I wrote a title for tonight's sermon
[52:09] down didn't know it was for tonight and
[52:11] um went back and realized it was not the
[52:14] right title but it was the right notes
[52:17] so I changed the title and I just had
[52:19] one little line it said there's
[52:20] discouragement in the message camp and
[52:24] uh I didn't know how that fit it just
[52:25] sat there in my notes until a few
[52:27] minutes before brother Jason called me
[52:29] out and I was reading through some
[52:31] quotes and I began to think that
[52:34] discouragement amen we're going to read
[52:35] the quote here praise the Lord
[52:37] perseverance
[52:38] 1963 now I found this quote I I don't
[52:41] believe there's a coincidence I found
[52:42] this quote and I said oh this is perfect
[52:44] I wonder who she is and I read up and I
[52:47] read down and I realized that she was
[52:50] the the that woman that came to the Lord
[52:52] for the healing of her daughter and he
[52:53] called her a dog so amen we just heard
[52:56] about that on Sunday brother B says he
[52:59] says finally she made her way through
[53:01] all these obstacles and she arrived at
[53:03] Jesus now seemingly all of her trouble
[53:06] was over she arrived at Jesus but it
[53:08] wasn't it was just starting many people
[53:11] would say well if I know Jesus yes we
[53:13] see that every night see he comes right
[53:16] with us each night proves hisself to be
[53:18] here but still we come back the next
[53:20] night with all of our troubles again you
[53:23] see see he so he's saying he says people
[53:25] come every night saying well if I could
[53:26] just see Jesus and he's there but they
[53:29] have to come back they go out with their
[53:32] trouble still he says see is that right
[53:34] now that's right she arrived at Jesus so
[53:37] perhaps maybe if she hadn't had that
[53:39] kind of Faith the first discouragement
[53:41] after finding Jesus why she would have
[53:43] of have been she would have blowed it
[53:46] blowed up and got upset and went back
[53:50] but you see Faith won't do
[53:53] that Faith won't turn it loose faith is
[53:58] persistent it holds right on now watch
[54:01] she had all confidence and faith in this
[54:03] man now if she had just been mocking or
[54:06] just saying you know I'm going to go
[54:07] down and I'm going to give it a try I'll
[54:09] see what he's got to say if he says
[54:11] something against our Creeds we'll we'll
[54:14] just leave that's all but she come to
[54:17] get something and she was determined to
[54:19] stay there till she got it so
[54:22] discouragement fits right in with fear
[54:26] if you go if she would have went to
[54:28] Jesus with the attitude of well I'm just
[54:30] going to go down there and and and and
[54:32] just just take a look and and try there
[54:34] was no
[54:35] faith but because she went down in faith
[54:38] when discouragement came at her when
[54:41] fear came at her amen she didn't turn
[54:44] back aside amen she says but the the the
[54:47] the the dogs eat the crumbs from the
[54:49] master's table she was persevering for
[54:52] what she desired so what is the why did
[54:56] I drop this in here the discouragement
[54:58] around us amen is for one thing is part
[55:02] of the age that we live in but this
[55:05] discouragement the best thing to fight
[55:09] against it is
[55:11] Faith why do you do what you
[55:15] do for the reward that people say hey
[55:20] good job buddy no sir you do it because
[55:25] God called you to do it why do you serve
[55:29] him in this crazy age don't you know
[55:31] influential men have said it's a cult
[55:34] don't you know well-respected men have
[55:37] said oh I came face to face with the
[55:39] truth and I have to deny the message
[55:42] don't you haven't you heard why are you
[55:44] still here
[55:46] tonight because fear is a
[55:50] liar what is the antidote to the
[55:53] discouragement around the message it's
[55:55] faith
[55:57] what is Faith revelation of who Jesus
[56:00] Christ is you cannot get Faith unless
[56:03] you hear the word of God oh so I'm just
[56:05] going to go home and play a tape 24/7
[56:07] that'll be good but that's not what it
[56:09] means hearing is believing hearing is
[56:12] having a revelation of the word of God
[56:14] and that is where faith comes from
[56:16] that's why brother brandom said if the
[56:18] true bride of Christ the bride of Christ
[56:20] could ever catch revelation of who she
[56:22] is she would be an invincible Army
[56:26] because fear is a liar amen praise the
[56:29] Lord I have a few slides here Genesis
[56:33] 15:1 after these things the word of the
[56:36] Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying
[56:38] fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[56:42] exceeding great
[56:44] reward fear not I am your shield and
[56:48] great
[56:50] reward Genesis
[56:52] 21:17 just so you know I took it from
[56:54] Genesis all the way way through and I
[56:56] thought as I was going through cuz the
[56:58] word fear is mentioned 400 times in the
[57:00] Bible but as I as I was going through
[57:03] and I was looking through I was like am
[57:04] I going to get am I going to get a
[57:06] scripture at Revelations if I am i g
[57:08] this is going to be amazing if I do and
[57:10] I got a scripture at of Revelations so
[57:12] tonight we got to look at a fear not
[57:14] from Genesis to Revelations Genesis
[57:17] 21:17 and God heard the voice of the lad
[57:20] and the angel of God Called to Hagar out
[57:22] of heaven and said unto her what ath
[57:24] thee Hagar fear not not for God hath
[57:27] heard the voice of the lad where he
[57:30] is contrary to the word of God was
[57:34] ishma yet God said I hear you so fear
[57:38] not God hath heard God has heard tonight
[57:44] God has heard the groanings and the
[57:46] travailing of the Sons and Daughters of
[57:48] God God has heard amen Genesis 26:24 and
[57:54] the Lord appeared unto him the same
[57:56] night and said I am the god of Abraham
[57:59] thy father fear not for I am with thee
[58:02] and will bless thee and multiply thy
[58:04] seed for my servant Abraham's sake fear
[58:07] not I am with you and I will bless you
[58:11] brother Chris is it
[58:13] okay to be blessed do I have to do do I
[58:17] have to to to to to to never you know
[58:21] I'm not going to go there praise the
[58:23] Lord I will bless you fear not I will
[58:27] bless you now we come into the book of
[58:30] Deuteronomy don't read it and
[58:32] Deuteronomy is of Moses speaking to the
[58:36] children of Israel from the word of God
[58:39] right the lord gave him the word he's
[58:40] speaking to the children of Israel the
[58:42] children of Israel have spent over 400
[58:45] years in
[58:46] Egypt praise the Lord remember that
[58:48] Deuteronomy 1:21 behold the Lord thy God
[58:51] hath set the land before thee go up and
[58:54] possess it as a Lord God of thy fathers
[58:58] hath said unto thee fear not neither be
[59:01] discouraged fear not you shall possess
[59:05] in
[59:07] Victory you shall possess in Victory
[59:11] ultimate and total
[59:14] Victory amen Deuteronomy 3:21 to 22 and
[59:18] I commanded Joshua at that time saying
[59:20] thine eyes have seen all that the Lord
[59:22] your God ha done unto these two kings so
[59:25] shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms
[59:27] wither thou passest you shall not fear
[59:30] them for the Lord your God he shall

[1:03:32] courage fear not nor be afraid of them
[1:03:36] for the Lord thy God he it is that doth

[1:03:58] he will be with thee he will not fail
[1:04:00] thee neither forsake thee fear not
[1:04:03] neither be dismayed maybe I'm a bit of a
[1:04:06] nerd but I had to go look up the word
[1:04:08] dismayed dismayed consternation and
[1:04:10] distress typically that caused by
[1:04:13] something unexpected no matter what you
[1:04:16] do no matter what you face in life it's
[1:04:17] already been covered in the
[1:04:19] book there is a story there is a
[1:04:23] scripture there is an example for every
[1:04:25] everything everyone will face in their
[1:04:29] life so fear not don't be distressed by
[1:04:33] the
[1:04:34] unexpected amen God knows the unexpected
[1:04:37] is going to happen that's how God works
[1:04:40] himself right God knows you're going to
[1:04:43] wake up one morning you got to go out
[1:04:45] it's it's cold here I'm sorry I've been
[1:04:47] in I was in Arizona too long I'm
[1:04:49] freezing somebody send me some
[1:04:52] help you get up in the morning and and
[1:04:54] and maybe you don't have a garage and
[1:04:56] your car's outside and you got to drive
[1:04:58] in to work and it's the windshield's
[1:05:00] iced over and it's cold and you decided
[1:05:03] to make it make it a fast trip out and
[1:05:06] so you just wear your
[1:05:08] slippers and you get to the car and the
[1:05:11] car won't start is that
[1:05:14] unexpected yes it is fear not don't be
[1:05:18] distressed amen what don't be stressed
[1:05:21] that's right you say fear is not just
[1:05:24] great big scary
[1:05:27] things amen don't be don't be afraid
[1:05:30] don't be
[1:05:31] distressed don't fear how you're going
[1:05:33] to get your car working again that's
[1:05:35] right don't be stressed
[1:05:39] out do you like being around people that
[1:05:41] are stressed you think the Lord likes
[1:05:43] being around you when you're stressed
[1:05:46] praise the Lord he's a gentleman amen
[1:05:48] the book of Deuteronomy okay now that's
[1:05:51] Moses to the children of Israel the
[1:05:53] Israel had been ruled by fear for over
[1:05:56] 400
[1:05:58] years and I found it interesting that in
[1:06:00] the book of De Deuteronomy there is so
[1:06:03] much on fear not fear not if you ever
[1:06:07] been into if you ever been in a
[1:06:08] relationship or you come from a church
[1:06:10] that held you there by fear right you
[1:06:14] have to hear the words of the Good
[1:06:17] Shepherd that's for a time to wash you
[1:06:20] from that fear because fear is a liar
[1:06:25] that's right show the children of Israel
[1:06:26] how to hear it time and time again fear
[1:06:29] not fear not fear not fear not if you
[1:06:34] want a new screen background for your
[1:06:35] phone just hit me
[1:06:38] up amen for 400 years their life was
[1:06:42] ruled by fear when you were in the world
[1:06:46] your life was ruled by fear am that's
[1:06:49] right when to bed at night you were
[1:06:51] afraid you got up in the morning you
[1:06:53] were afraid the plane hit some serious
[1:06:55] turbulence you were afraid you pulled
[1:06:58] your rosary out you were
[1:07:01] afraid but God's word is the direct
[1:07:04] opposite of that because he says fear
[1:07:06] not funny how everything the devil has
[1:07:09] is a perversion of the Perfection of
[1:07:12] Christ God calls you to fear
[1:07:15] him but
[1:07:17] not
[1:07:19] scared fears in irreverence amen so the
[1:07:22] devil thinks you know it's that's like
[1:07:24] that's the the a big line for people
[1:07:26] that are Liv in the world oh well this
[1:07:28] is my
[1:07:29] choice I do what I want the devil has
[1:07:33] him jipped could deceived because the
[1:07:37] bride of Christ knows we are here not by
[1:07:39] ourselves amen it is Christ right we're
[1:07:43] the only ones willing to admit that
[1:07:46] that's right but the people in the world
[1:07:47] say oh this is all my choice this is
[1:07:49] what I want to do yet their lives are
[1:07:51] being ruled by fear praise the Lord
[1:07:55] judges 6:23 and the Lord said unto him
[1:07:58] peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt
[1:08:02] not die now I took this from the story
[1:08:03] of Gideon Gideon's afraid because he saw
[1:08:06] the angel and he's you know oh I've seen
[1:08:08] an angel I'm going to die I'm going to
[1:08:10] die and the Lord says you know peace be
[1:08:11] unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die
[1:08:14] but it's a scripture in the Bible and
[1:08:16] guess what fear
[1:08:19] not you shall not die amen you are
[1:08:23] Eternal amen say how dare how can you
[1:08:26] say that you know so you you you you say
[1:08:29] to someone who's who's dying of cancer
[1:08:31] fear not you shall not die whether they
[1:08:33] depart this Earth or not they never died
[1:08:37] if they're a child of God that is a
[1:08:39] promise you can stake your life on
[1:08:42] praise the Lord because you have eternal
[1:08:44] life now we move into First Kings 17:13
[1:08:48] and Elijah said unto her fear
[1:08:52] not go and do as thou Hast said
[1:08:56] you know we don't always know the
[1:08:57] outcomes of the tasks we've been given
[1:09:00] by God that's right but he says just do
[1:09:03] it and don't be afraid that's right amen
[1:09:07] that's right now we know the ultimate
[1:09:09] outcome of serving him on this Earth but
[1:09:12] we don't know the outcome of our choices
[1:09:14] to serve him on this earth does that
[1:09:18] make sense or was that a bit of a tongue
[1:09:20] twister you don't know the outcome of
[1:09:22] your choices to sacrifice your life for
[1:09:25] God always on this
[1:09:28] Earth but God says fear not go and do
[1:09:33] like I've told you to do so Elijah is
[1:09:36] speaking to this lady this woman but
[1:09:38] make me therefore a little cake first
[1:09:42] oh well that man is a male
[1:09:47] chauvinist no see the world has a
[1:09:50] misunderstanding of what it means what a
[1:09:53] a true man is and I'm not not going to
[1:09:56] go into all that that's another sermon
[1:09:58] for your pastor to
[1:10:01] preach no just amen we have to give God
[1:10:06] of ourselves first he says fear not
[1:10:10] everything's going to be okay but you
[1:10:12] have to give me your life first what was
[1:10:15] she doing by making Elijah that cake
[1:10:17] that was the last of her meals she was
[1:10:19] giving her life she was giving up her
[1:10:21] life she was dying out completely
[1:10:24] because she knew or she thought if she
[1:10:26] made that cake there would be none for
[1:10:28] her for her but he says and bring it
[1:10:30] unto me and after that make for thee and
[1:10:33] for thy
[1:10:35] son fear not the Lord will provide and
[1:10:38] we know the end of that story amen the
[1:10:40] Lord provided her with plenty of oil and
[1:10:42] flour for the rest of the drought amen
[1:10:46] see we try out of our own devices can I
[1:10:48] have either of these water bottles we
[1:10:50] try of our own devices to save our own
[1:10:52] skin sometimes
[1:10:59] and in doing so prevent God from coming
[1:11:01] on the
[1:11:08] scene we have $42 in our bank account we
[1:11:12] need gas we need food God says put 40 in
[1:11:15] the offering plate give 40 to this
[1:11:19] brother and we say no we can't this is
[1:11:22] the last money we have
[1:11:25] not though cuz God holds a thousand
[1:11:28] cattles on every Hill yes
[1:11:32] sir and so you
[1:11:34] give next day next few days something
[1:11:38] happens whether or not God gives you a
[1:11:41] bunch of
[1:11:43] cash he
[1:11:45] provided sometimes sometimes we get
[1:11:47] caught up and I know this is a fault of
[1:11:49] my own and I confess before you tonight
[1:11:52] we get caught up in the materialism of
[1:11:54] our age amen and we think we got to have
[1:11:56] it all and we get stressed cuz we can't

[1:12:18] software

[1:26:22] discouragement
[1:26:24] amen amen Faith hey praise the Lord re
[1:26:28] Romans 10:1 17 so then Faith cometh by
[1:26:31] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:26:36] Revelation Revelation is the power to
[1:26:39] overcome the worlden because Revelation
[1:26:43] see God says the Lord Jesus Christ has
[1:26:46] says I have I have everything you need
[1:26:49] to
[1:26:50] overcome but a revelation of that allows
[1:26:54] you to take it that's right without
[1:26:58] Revelation it's still sitting
[1:27:00] here but faith says I can take that
[1:27:07] amen that's right God told Abraham
[1:27:11] circumcised
[1:27:13] everyone and God because of of of
[1:27:16] Abraham's display of
[1:27:18] Faith amen he was given the circumcision
[1:27:21] of the flesh now you've been given
[1:27:23] circumcision of the heart but God said
[1:27:25] Abraham leave leave your family and come
[1:27:28] walk with me in the desert he didn't
[1:27:31] have message
[1:27:32] books he didn't
[1:27:35] have
[1:27:37] support people it was him and Sarah and
[1:27:40] his nephew who just pulled the opposite
[1:27:43] direction the entire time caused him
[1:27:45] grief yet Abraham stepped out in faith
[1:27:49] you think Abraham had fear yes but his
[1:27:52] faith overcame fear and when you read of
[1:27:56] him in Hebrews
[1:27:57] 11 you don't read about his mistakes you
[1:28:00] read about by
[1:28:02] faith praise the Lord by faith you don't
[1:28:05] hear about the fear and the ending of
[1:28:07] Noah's life you just hear about the
[1:28:09] faith that Noah had to step into the ark
[1:28:12] amen God has given you the ability Amen
[1:28:16] to fight and have faith to overcome the
[1:28:19] world that is you are faced with amen
[1:28:22] and he is telling he is saying
[1:28:24] amen fear is a liar amen and there's one
[1:28:28] more thing he says
[1:28:31] shalom shalom fear not be of good cheer
[1:28:36] and peace be unto thee peace be unto
[1:28:40] thee I don't know about you but just
[1:28:42] saying Shalom makes me feel fuzzy on the
[1:28:45] inside there's a lot packed in that word
[1:28:49] Shalom peace unto you God had and
[1:28:55] God has given you peace that's why the
[1:28:59] script Psalms it says spread a table be
[1:29:02] before you in the presence of your
[1:29:04] enemies every day of your life you're in
[1:29:06] the presence of your
[1:29:07] enemies this guy is your
[1:29:10] enemy but he says I give you peace in
[1:29:13] the midst of all that imagine a raging
[1:29:16] War imagine imagine bullets flying
[1:29:18] overhead artillery shells whistling by
[1:29:23] bombs explod and you're sitting there
[1:29:25] having a nice gourmet meal white
[1:29:28] tablecloth you got a napkin on your leg
[1:29:30] you got two forks one for your salad one
[1:29:34] for your steak and you're enjoying
[1:29:36] yourself there's not a speck of blood on
[1:29:38] that white tablecloth you you have a
[1:29:41] meal prepared in the midst of the
[1:29:44] battle amen you have been given a feast
[1:29:47] amen and God has said Shalom sister Emy
[1:29:50] and Sean you guys want to come on up
[1:29:52] here amen fear is a liar don't be
[1:29:56] discouraged saints of God don't be
[1:29:58] discouraged and I I I know great even
[1:30:01] Great Men of Faith have
[1:30:04] times of
[1:30:06] discouragement you're not exempt don't
[1:30:09] think and don't think there's something
[1:30:10] wrong with you because you experience
[1:30:12] fear amen don't think that you know
[1:30:15] don't pick someone in your head that you
[1:30:16] think is a great Christian and think
[1:30:17] they never have fear that's right
[1:30:22] right we don't we don't
[1:30:25] there there's there's mature there's
[1:30:27] different levels of maturity Christians
[1:30:30] we're all going to come to the same
[1:30:31] place because that's what's going to get
[1:30:32] us out of here amen some
[1:30:35] people who who are mature would be the
[1:30:38] first ones to say no I'm no great
[1:30:42] Christian but what is the secret
[1:30:47] ingredient their faith but where did
[1:30:50] that Faith come
[1:30:52] from revelation and the things that they
[1:30:55] had to go
[1:30:56] through the the the the the the scars
[1:30:59] you could see on their the this the
[1:31:04] uh the black people the Africans that
[1:31:06] came over in the early days of America
[1:31:08] and were slaved they had great faith but
[1:31:11] they had scars on their back to show for
[1:31:13] it that's right those that earned their
[1:31:16] freedom had scars on their back to show
[1:31:18] for
[1:31:19] it amen the the things that that you go
[1:31:23] through you you we pray for Faith and we
[1:31:26] we pray for God to to to to give us more
[1:31:31] maturity in his word I'm I'm I'm missing
[1:31:33] a word here I I I
[1:31:36] apologize but then then we shy away from
[1:31:41] the the hard thing he's asked us to do
[1:31:44] when that's now we don't do things for
[1:31:46] personal gain you understand what I'm
[1:31:47] saying but God has a journey that you
[1:31:49] have a journey that you're on and God
[1:31:51] says you know you're going to walk
[1:31:53] through through this this fire here you
[1:31:57] say no I'm not I'm going to go around it
[1:32:00] you can't that's you can't go around it
[1:32:03] and so you have to say God give me the
[1:32:08] strength to walk through the
[1:32:11] fire the children of Israel excuse me
[1:32:13] Shadrach Meshach and
[1:32:15] Abednego like I said I'm reading through
[1:32:17] the Book of Daniel they had
[1:32:20] to you okay you think
[1:32:24] do you think everyone in the kingdom was
[1:32:26] like oh look at these three guys they're
[1:32:28] not bowing no everybody
[1:32:29] knew because of their lives testified of
[1:32:32] it so as soon as that music played
[1:32:34] everyone looked at them to see what they
[1:32:36] were going to
[1:32:37] do you think they you think they were
[1:32:39] out there where everyone could see them
[1:32:41] without praying God give us the strength
[1:32:44] and the faith to walk through the fire
[1:32:47] they didn't they didn't go out there I
[1:32:49] mean I'm sure a human element they were
[1:32:51] hoping maybe the king would change their
[1:32:52] mind but they knew if they stood for God
[1:32:55] they would be thrown into the
[1:32:57] fire you stand for God you will be
[1:32:59] thrown into the fire whether that be a
[1:33:02] natural fire like the children of Israel
[1:33:04] I pray not but the fire of relationship
[1:33:07] with your family the fire of
[1:33:09] relationships at work the fire in in
[1:33:12] your
[1:33:13] life but what did that fire
[1:33:21] do it set them free
[1:33:24] it burnt their
[1:33:28] bonds and they walked out see that's the
[1:33:31] crazy thing about the Mira about Christ
[1:33:34] he passes you through the fire and with
[1:33:36] that fire he sets you free from the
[1:33:39] shame of your Youth and you walk out the
[1:33:41] other side without a smell of smoke on
[1:33:44] you who is this guy W that guy's a oh
[1:33:47] you should have KNN him known him when I
[1:33:49] knew him you can't even tell the
[1:33:52] difference now he you can't even see you
[1:33:55] can excuse me there's a big difference
[1:33:57] you see well this this guy used to be
[1:33:59] this over here a murderer yeah
[1:34:01] wow not a smell of smoke on him praise
[1:34:05] the Lord amen God help us Amen to

[1:35:15] child you've been asking for or whatever
