[15:58] and number 714.
[16:10] A country where no twilight shadows
[16:15] deepen.
[16:20] Unending day or night will never be.
[16:28] A city where the storm clouds cannot
[16:33] gather.
[16:38] Oh, this is just what heaven means to
[16:43] me.
[16:47] What will it be when we get over yonder

[17:09] Christ forever.
[17:13] Oh, this is just what heaven means to
[17:19] me.
[17:23] A place where there is no
[17:26] misunderstanding.
[17:33] And from allity
[17:36] and strife, we're free.
[17:41] No unkind
[17:43] words to wound the heart are spoken
[17:51] now. This is just what heaven means to
[17:56] me.

[18:33] me.
[18:37] And when at last we see the face of
[18:42] Jesus
[18:47] before whose image other loves all flee.
[18:56] And when they crown him Lord of all,
[19:00] I'll be there.
[19:05] For this is just what heaven means to
[19:10] me.
[19:14] What will it be when we get over yonder
[19:23] and join the throng around the glassy
[19:28] sea?

[19:36] Christ forever.
[19:41] Oh, this is just what heaven means to
[19:46] me.

[25:04] light in the end time, Father. And so,
[25:06] we are counting on that and we even see

[25:48] thy hand lead me and thy right hand
[25:50] shall hold me. I if I say surely the
[25:54] darkness shall cover me, even the night
[25:55] shall be about me. Yeah, the darkness

[28:31] in the keeping of them.

[28:43] Amen. Amen. More to be desired than
[28:46] gold. Amen. This song keeps coming back
[28:49] to me. Just want to sing it again. More
[28:51] of you.
[28:54] It's not the song, I think. It's the
[28:56] thought. Right.
[29:08] more of you. Sorry, I didn't write the
[29:10] number down. We all know it though.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Okay.

[29:20] of you.
[29:26] More of you.
[29:33] I've had it all.
[29:36] But what I need is more of you.

[29:52] And yet I hunger
[29:56] still.

[30:18] More of you.
[30:24] I've had it all.
[30:28] But what I need is more of you.

[30:43] but yet I hunger
[30:47] still
[30:50] empty and bear.
[30:53] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[31:03] More of you.
[31:09] More
[31:11] of you.
[31:16] I've had it all,
[31:19] but what I need is more of you.
[31:29] I've had my fill
[31:34] and yet I hunger still
[31:41] empty and bar.
[31:44] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[31:53] Amen.
[31:54] Amen. I believe that's the desire of all
[31:56] our hearts this evening. Amen.
[31:59] Hallelujah.
[32:01] Amen. As we ask our brother David to
[32:02] come, I'd like to sing that little song.
[32:04] L
[32:15] the chorus here.
[32:23] Hello here.
[32:28] How we long
[32:32] to worship
[32:35] you.
[32:40] Hello.
[32:45] Hello.
[32:50] How we long
[32:54] to worship
[32:57] you.
[33:03] Lord, we come to you in worship.
[33:10] No matter what the circumstance,
[33:17] no matter what the situation,
[33:23] we will lift up holy hands.
[33:31] Hello.
[33:36] Elohim,
[33:40] how we long
[33:44] to worship
[33:47] you.
[33:51] Hello.
[33:56] Elohim.
[34:00] How we long
[34:03] to worship
[34:06] you,
[34:10] Lord. We come to you in worship.
[34:17] No matter what the circumstance,
[34:23] no matter what the situation,
[34:30] we will lift up holy
[34:35] hands.
[34:38] Elheim,
[34:47] how we long
[34:50] to worship
[34:53] you.
[34:57] Elohheim,
[35:07] how we long
[35:10] to worship
[35:13] you.
[35:26] We long
[35:29] to worship
[35:32] you.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, I commit every angel to you now
[35:43] according to your will.
[35:47] this congregation into your hands. My
[35:49] salvation.
[35:58] Amen.
[36:01] Hallelujah.
[36:03] Do you long to worship him?
[36:06] I can tell you what it's going to take.
[36:08] It's going to take a dying to self
[36:12] to truly worship him.
[36:15] You can't worship yourself
[36:19] and him at the same time.
[36:23] We must surrender to him.
[36:30] I stand before you this evening with an
[36:33] urgency in my heart.
[36:38] In fact, I want to title this an urgency
[36:42] to surrender.
[36:45] I was out in prayer this morning early
[36:49] and the Lord laid in my heart a real
[36:51] urgency
[36:58] and believe that he's calling you and I
[37:03] to a
[37:05] complete surrender.
[37:11] I believe it's very urgent that we do
[37:12] that. We let go and we let him just
[37:16] absolutely take us over.
[37:24] And I it's an urgency. And I and I I
[37:27] speak of urgency as a desperation.
[37:31] We're at the end.
[37:38] Are you ready if the resurrection takes
[37:40] place in a few more moments?
[37:45] Are we ready if it should come in the
[37:48] morning?
[37:50] I don't know when it's going to be.
[37:52] That's how urgent we are right here. But
[37:55] God is calling you and I to a complete
[37:58] and total surrender.
[38:02] I cannot
[38:04] overstate that.
[38:09] I'm not just speaking to you. I'm
[38:10] speaking to myself. I'm including all of
[38:13] us.
[38:17] So, let's bow our heads for a word of
[38:19] prayer. Our heavenly father,
[38:22] it is my my
[38:25] soul is shaking. I'm I'm just totally
[38:30] Lord, may this same
[38:32] spirit
[38:34] of urgency
[38:36] settle
[38:38] on the heart of your bride.
[38:43] Lord, we're at the closure.
[38:47] We don't know. I don't know how much
[38:50] longer.
[38:53] We don't know but what we'll even make
[38:56] it home tonight. We step from here to
[38:59] there in faith.
[39:02] But Lord, let us completely
[39:05] release,
[39:07] let go, and give ourselves in full
[39:10] surrender because that's what it's going
[39:12] to take. That's what it's got to take
[39:17] to take that body change.
[39:20] And you're going to have your bride in
[39:22] that position.
[39:25] You will and it must. And she's here on
[39:27] the scene today.
[39:30] So Lord, here we are tonight. We haven't
[39:32] come here by chance. It isn't something
[39:35] we've come just because
[39:39] of what afraid of what others might
[39:41] think or what we think. But Lord, we've
[39:44] come with a love in our heart
[39:47] &gt;&gt; for more of you.
[39:52] more of you, Lord. Now, Father, we
[39:55] present ourselves entirely in your
[39:57] control and this service is in your
[39:59] control and purpose and hands tonight.
[40:04] speak to every individual heart to each
[40:07] one
[40:09] we pray and for thy glory bless your
[40:12] promised word for I believe there's the
[40:16] promised word is here that you said
[40:18] would be here in this hour
[40:21] Lord and that is in the formation of
[40:23] your bride
[40:26] and you are here among us because that's
[40:28] you
[40:30] and Lord we just release ourselves now
[40:32] to what you would have us to hear. Speak
[40:35] to us personally in Jesus Christ's name
[40:38] we pray. Amen.
[40:41] Amen. God bless you. Turn with me in
[40:43] your Bibles to Psalm 139
[40:49] and we're going to read verse five. We
[40:52] could read. You go home and read the
[40:54] whole psalm.
[40:59] Do you believe he knows you?
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Do you believe he's searching you?
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; This is what verse one says.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, thou hast searched me
[41:10] &gt;&gt; and known me.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; As I said, my title is an urgency to
[41:14] surrender.
[41:17] Surrender, don't take that lightly.
[41:20] Surrender is losing your whole self and
[41:23] putting yourself in the hands
[41:26] of your Lord.
[41:28] He is perfect in all of his ways. He
[41:31] makes no mistakes. He cannot fail. He
[41:35] cannot lead you astray. He's going to
[41:38] lead you perfectly. The Lord is my
[41:41] shepherd.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; How about your shepherd?
[41:46] What is it? And we're likened unto
[41:47] sheep. We can't lead ourselves.
[41:50] We cannot lead ourselves.
[41:54] And if and we we are heading toward a
[41:56] climax. We know that. We're seeing it
[41:59] everywhere. But the climax we're looking
[42:01] for is a meeting in the air. We're
[42:03] looking for the resurrection.
[42:06] I'm expecting it
[42:08] &gt;&gt; and I want to absolutely let go.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; No matter what the circumstance is, I
[42:14] have a promise. I have himself in me
[42:19] and I know that he d guides and directs
[42:22] absolutely perfect.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; So Psalm 139, let's take verse five.
[42:30] Thou hast beset me behind
[42:34] and before.
[42:36] Praise the Lord.
[42:39] And laid thy hand upon me.
[42:43] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[42:47] It is high. I cannot in your own
[42:49] ability, your own thinking. You cannot
[42:52] attain it. So we need to let go of that
[42:55] &gt;&gt; and yield ourselves and abilities
[42:59] to God.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we in our own human
[43:04] ability can do nothing. We are nothing
[43:06] to begin with. We were born with come
[43:09] into the world defeated.
[43:12] That's exactly right. God is not asking
[43:15] you to depend upon your self and your
[43:17] knowledge. He's saying give yourself
[43:19] over to me. Without me, you cannot make
[43:22] it home.
[43:25] Without your surrendering me to me,
[43:28] that's the urgency of it. Verse
[43:33] 17,
[43:35] how precious also are thy thoughts unto
[43:39] me, oh God. How great is the sum of
[43:44] them.
[43:45] I'd like you to turn me Jeremiah 29.
[43:51] These are familiar scriptures. The Bible
[43:53] ought to become familiar,
[43:56] but not only familiar, but Lord, let it
[43:59] be revealed.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Let the thought
[44:05] be revealed unto me. His thoughts, his
[44:08] thoughts concerning me is laying right
[44:11] here in this word. It says right here,
[44:13] verse 11, for I know the thoughts that I
[44:15] think toward you.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[44:17] &gt;&gt; saith the Lord. You believe you're in
[44:19] this word?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; You believe you're the thinking of God
[44:23] &gt;&gt; in this word.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; God thought of you, put you in the word
[44:26] because the word is a complete
[44:27] revelation of himself. And without you,
[44:29] he cannot have a complete revelation.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; So you're in this word.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; You're written here in this word.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; And so I know the thoughts that I think
[44:40] toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of
[44:42] peace and not of evil to give you an
[44:45] expected end. I say let's surrender to
[44:48] him. Let's surrender to him. There's so
[44:52] many places in the scripture we could
[44:54] read. Let's go over here to Philippians
[44:57] 2.
[45:03] Philippians 2 verse 13
[45:07] through 16.
[45:11] For it is God which workketh in you, oh
[45:14] God, let us become desperate.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Do we realize this? Do we understand
[45:20] this? That it's God
[45:22] that it is God
[45:24] &gt;&gt; which workketh in you. You don't need to
[45:26] to lean upon your thinking. Let go of
[45:29] that. Give yourself to God. Give
[45:31] yourself to the word unreservably. Only
[45:34] believe.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Let go. See, for it is God which
[45:39] workketh in you to will.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; What's he asking for? Submission.
[45:46] Submission, brother, sister. Surrender.
[45:48] Surrender to this scripture right here.
[45:51] Surrender. It is God which workketh in
[45:53] you.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Then let's start acting on it, shall we?
[45:58] Let's surrender ourselves to him.
[46:03] For it is God which workketh in you both
[46:06] to will and to do. You don't have to
[46:10] make things happen. Let him do it. Put
[46:12] it in his hand. Put it in his hands. You
[46:14] put it in his hands. Let go. You put it
[46:16] in his hands.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Don't take it back.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Leave it in his hands.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Leave it to the word.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; For it is God which workketh in you both
[46:28] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[46:33] according to his pleasure. Now we'll
[46:34] come back Sunday we have part two but
[46:36] remember in Ephesians so we made stress
[46:39] of that his pleasure it's his pleasure
[46:42] it's his purpose
[46:45] he's called you individually for his
[46:47] purpose he's moving through his purpose
[46:50] he's working out his purpose just
[46:53] surrender to him
[46:56] you're not going to make it home without
[46:58] him you cannot make it home without
[47:00] submitting to yourself to him I can't
[47:03] overstress I overemphasize that
[47:06] both to do of his good pleasure.
[47:09] Therefore, verse 14, do all things
[47:12] without murmurings
[47:15] and disputings. Because surrendering
[47:18] yourself fully to him there, how can
[47:21] there be anything to murmur about or
[47:23] complain?
[47:24] &gt;&gt; The word has given you everything you
[47:26] have need of.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; He's He's provided the way out. He knows
[47:33] his thoughts. He's He's provided uh he
[47:37] he's given us peace,
[47:40] &gt;&gt; an expected end.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; He's provided it all.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; And yet we think there's something we
[47:46] have to do in it. There's nothing you
[47:48] can do in it. Just give yourself to the
[47:50] word
[47:52] &gt;&gt; and let him lead. He will never lead you
[47:55] contrary to his word. If you find a
[47:57] spirit leading you away from the word,
[47:59] that's not God.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what station you're
[48:04] in, what you are, or who you are.
[48:07] He's not asking you for your abilities.
[48:09] He's asking you for your surrender.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; I cannot overemphasize that tonight.
[48:18] Verse 16. Let's just jump down here.
[48:22] Holding forth the word of life that I
[48:25] may rejoice in the day of Christ that I
[48:27] have not run in vain nor labored in
[48:30] vain. St. John, one more scripture while
[48:32] you're standing. St. John 17 or 15. St.
[48:36] John 15
[48:40] verse 5.
[48:43] Take this to yourself. Hold it tight. I
[48:47] am the vine. You are the branches.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; I am the vine.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; You can do nothing without being in the
[48:57] vine. The vine supplies the energy.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:01] Amen. What's the vine got to do?
[49:04] What's the branch got to do? I mean,
[49:06] submit to the vine.
[49:09] You can't bear your own fruit. He said
[49:11] right here, I'm the vine, you're the
[49:13] branches. He that abideth in me and I in
[49:16] him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.
[49:19] For without me, you can do nothing.
[49:26] If a man abide not in me, he is cast
[49:28] forth as a branch and is withered and
[49:31] men gather them and cast them into fire
[49:33] and they are burned.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; If ye abide in me, I'm coming down to
[49:38] this this statement. I've got a little
[49:41] bit twofold here. If ye abide in me and
[49:44] my words abide in you, that's oneness.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; You shall ask what you will. That's the
[49:51] mind of God in you. You shall ask what
[49:54] you will and it shall be done unto you.
[49:58] Here is my father glorified that you
[50:00] bear much fruit and you shall ye so
[50:04] shall ye be my disciples.
[50:07] You may be seated. God bless his word.
[50:11] Amen.
[50:14] He has no hands but ours, no ears but
[50:16] ours, no tongue but ours, no feet but
[50:18] ours. So let's let him have everything.
[50:22] Let's let him have everything.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Let's determine in our heart to release
[50:29] ourselves to him.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I can do nothing without you.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; So, let's let him have everything. The
[50:39] secret of this is submitting yourself
[50:41] with godly love into the hands of a
[50:43] loving father and let him take you over.
[50:49] Ah,
[50:50] &gt;&gt; that's the key. Let him take you over.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; You're certainly not going anywhere s
[51:00] surrendering to yourself.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; The song says, "All to thee I now
[51:12] surrender. All to thee I freely give."
[51:16] Let me read that again. All to thee I
[51:19] now surrender.
[51:21] All to thee I freely
[51:25] &gt;&gt; give.
[51:28] It's not a drudgery.
[51:30] He's not forcing you. He's just simply
[51:35] saying let go and let me have you my
[51:39] way. You're too busy in other things.
[51:42] We'll get to that in a minute. I'm not
[51:44] speaking of just you. I'm including
[51:46] myself, every one of us here
[51:49] under the same dominion of this word.
[51:54] All right?
[51:56] You must God, excuse me, God wants a
[52:01] complete surrender.
[52:03] Now, I'm quoting the word of God through
[52:06] a prophet. He said, "God wants a
[52:09] complete surrender." Are you willing to
[52:11] give to him what God wants?
[52:15] God wants a complete surrender.
[52:18] Surrender everything, all you are, every
[52:20] fiber. Give all to him. Let him rule.
[52:25] The Bible said, "Let the peace of God
[52:28] rule
[52:29] in your heart." What's that rule?
[52:32] umpire. It's an absolute.
[52:35] He's absolute. You can't put yourself up
[52:38] here as absolute. There's only one.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; There's You got to have an absolute. So,
[52:43] it's going to be either yourself or the
[52:45] word.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; That's what it's come down to.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; And this, and I'll say this, this
[52:54] message is the word of God.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] All right.
[53:01] Let him rule. Remember, he is the word.
[53:05] He's the final word. He's the ultimate.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; That's the end of all strife.
[53:12] That's the end of all murmuring.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; That's the end of all complaining.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; That's the end of all you trying to do
[53:18] it. You just let go and let him do it.
[53:21] Well, he doesn't do it in the in the
[53:23] time period I think he ought to. That's
[53:25] the problem, isn't it?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; You need patience.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Exactly. You need
[53:33] patience. When you submit yourself to
[53:35] him, he's going to fulfill his word. But
[53:37] he works through faith. Right?
[53:40] &gt;&gt; You take his word in faith, believing
[53:42] what you don't see, you don't have, you
[53:44] don't feel, but she said so. And faith
[53:46] rests in that word.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; When you ask, you believe, you receive
[53:51] it. Not later. Now, not looking for
[53:54] something to happen immediately. Because
[53:56] he said so, you receive it. I've
[53:58] received it, Lord, and you shall have
[54:00] it.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; That's going to be in God's time.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; So, don't start flirting with something
[54:06] else. I want to say right now, God is
[54:09] not a mixer.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; That's what Eve did. She mixed her seed
[54:14] with another seed. You say her seed.
[54:16] Yes, she had a seed. Do you Oh, well,
[54:18] she didn't have a seed. Oh, yes, she
[54:20] did. She has God's word.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That was her seed. She had the word of
[54:25] God, but she couldn't wait for the word
[54:28] to for God to fulfill his word.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. She had the seed
[54:35] &gt;&gt; and she mixed it.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. She She had the She had her
[54:41] husband's word. She had the word of the
[54:43] Lord. She was given seed. She had the
[54:47] seed and the prophet said she mixed that
[54:49] seed.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; With another seed
[54:52] &gt;&gt; and it brought forth death. To mix
[54:55] anything with an original that original
[54:57] word is bringing death. It's not going
[55:00] to go anywhere. It just brings failure.
[55:02] You'll try. You'll try. You'll strive.
[55:04] You'll strive. Why? Because you're not
[55:06] completely giving over to the word and
[55:08] do what he said and act upon it. I speak
[55:11] of all of us.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what is God doing? He has a
[55:16] bride coming to the full for her full
[55:20] potential. She's coming up to her full
[55:21] headship. She's she's growing. Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you must She's growing to a to
[55:29] a complete stature of himself.
[55:35] You must be desperate or perish. Here
[55:39] again, here's the word. You must be
[55:41] desperate or perish.
[55:45] And if there's ever a time that we
[55:46] should be desperate, it's this day. It's
[55:48] this hour. We must be desperate or
[55:51] perish.
[55:57] the Lord is my shepherd.
[56:01] Then surrender to your shepherd. In
[56:03] order for a sheep to follow the
[56:05] shepherd, it must submit itself to the
[56:07] shepherd.
[56:10] And let me say again, you cannot lead
[56:13] yourself. You cannot even defend
[56:15] yourself. A sheep is helpless
[56:18] &gt;&gt; without the shepherd.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; So are we.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Totally.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:28] I'm not talking about perfection of the
[56:30] flesh. I'm talking about the soul being
[56:32] perfected. The per the letting go, the
[56:35] soul submitting, surrendering. Then let
[56:38] God take and rule from within from the
[56:40] control room.
[56:42] Your emotions,
[56:44] your thoughts, your deeds, your actions.
[56:47] Let that be your absolute in the soul.
[56:51] In there in that little room is where
[56:54] you meet him.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's where you live from. That's
[56:57] where you talk from. That's where we
[56:59] should always move, live, talk from
[57:02] there. Right there. Surrendering to he
[57:05] that is in you.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than your
[57:10] circumstance.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; How many times did we have to hear that?
[57:13] How many times will we have to hear
[57:15] that? Greater is he that is in you
[57:19] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world? than he
[57:21] that is against you. Then your enemy of
[57:24] your own self. That's the greatest enemy
[57:26] you've got is your own self. So don't
[57:28] bow to that. You lift up an idol of
[57:30] yourself. Anything. Oh my. Let me not
[57:34] get quite get ahead of myself here. All
[57:36] right. Let's back a minute. Let's go to
[57:38] Luke 13.
[57:46] The prophet said this. We want now we
[57:49] want separation. And God's word calls
[57:51] for a total separation from all
[57:53] unbelief. God's word calls for a total
[57:56] separation from all unbelief. Separated
[57:59] to his headship alone, not mixers.
[58:06] We must be separated to his headship
[58:08] alone. God doesn't want a mixer.
[58:12] You can't mix anything with God's word.
[58:16] If you do, it's death.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; It's failure.
[58:20] Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; That settles it. That ought to settle
[58:23] it.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Luke Luke 13
[58:34] verse 24. Strive to enter in at the
[58:37] straight gate. For many, I say unto you,
[58:40] will will seek to enter in and shall not
[58:43] be able.
[58:46] When once, now listen to this. When once
[58:49] the master of the house is risen up and
[58:54] has shut to the door, and you begin to
[58:56] stand without, and to knock at the door,
[58:59] saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, and he
[59:01] shall answer and say unto you, I know
[59:03] you not, whence you are.
[59:06] Then shall we begin to say, we have
[59:09] eaten and drunk in your presence.
[59:12] Why? We've gone to church our whole
[59:14] life. We were raised in the message.
[59:17] That's good.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; But the message has got to be in you.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't be just out here as a
[59:23] religion. God help us. Don't ever make
[59:26] this message a religion. Your religion.
[59:28] It's not your religion. It's your life.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; It must be your life.
[59:36] Amen. All right. So,
[59:39] she I don't even know you. They've come
[59:41] knocking at the door. But I but I drank
[59:43] with you. I I walked with you. Many
[59:45] hunted with him. meant he did many
[59:46] things with him.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And still didn't know him.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; We can come to church every day and
[59:54] still not know him.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; It's got to be him living in you. That
[1:00:02] ought to put a desperation in our hearts
[1:00:04] because either we're desperate for him
[1:00:06] or we're not desperate for him. We ought
[1:00:08] to be desperate for him seeing in the
[1:00:10] condition of the world and what's around
[1:00:11] us and every sign pointing that we're
[1:00:13] here. We've arrived. The seal have been
[1:00:15] open. Brother Bram said that denotes
[1:00:17] we're at the end. We've arrived. We're
[1:00:19] here. We're at the end.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be any more history
[1:00:24] written because there'll be nobody here
[1:00:25] to read it.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're We're This is where
[1:00:29] we are. And God is calling us to a
[1:00:32] complete and total surrender. This is an
[1:00:35] urgency.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to take this lightly
[1:00:39] tonight. There may be few of us here. I
[1:00:41] don't know who's online, but this is an
[1:00:43] urgency.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; God is calling for your complete
[1:00:47] surrender.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; There's there's things powerfully moving
[1:00:58] right now completely. Judgment.
[1:01:02] Three blasts up on on Sunset Mountain 60
[1:01:06] 61 62 60 years ago. We've We've come
[1:01:11] down here 60 years.
[1:01:13] Where are we at? We're right here, right
[1:01:16] now, right ready to leave.
[1:01:20] There's a bride marching out of here.
[1:01:22] There's a bride on the march. The move
[1:01:24] is on for the bride. That ought to put
[1:01:26] enough desperation in you, seeing
[1:01:28] around, seeing the time, seeing where
[1:01:30] we're at. That ought to put a
[1:01:31] desperation and an urgency. Lord, I want
[1:01:34] give everything. I give all to you.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:39] If I close the book right now and go
[1:01:41] home, I've done what Lord laid in my
[1:01:43] heart to bring an urgency.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; May it strike your heart.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Let us not let us not just I don't mean
[1:01:54] we are, but let us let us including me.
[1:01:57] Let us not lay around anymore waiting.
[1:02:00] Let's be active and acting on the word
[1:02:02] and believe it. Act upon it. Not hearers
[1:02:05] only, but a doer of the word.
[1:02:08] If you're a doer, then you've submitted
[1:02:10] yourself that his word is the absolute.
[1:02:12] His word is the amen. His word is
[1:02:14] leading you. It either is or isn't.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Let God search our hearts. Let God go
[1:02:24] deep into our souls. Let's go beyond our
[1:02:26] emotion realm.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; This isn't emotion. This is the
[1:02:30] revealing of himself in you. That's what
[1:02:32] it has to be.
[1:02:34] In order for you to surrender, you must
[1:02:36] have and receive him. And then he works
[1:02:40] through you. And he's just simply
[1:02:41] calling you to a greater deeper love
[1:02:44] affair with him.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; A deeper greater love affair with Jesus
[1:02:50] Christ. Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And here we see right here when once the
[1:02:56] master of the house is risen up and the
[1:02:58] prophet comes along and preaches a
[1:03:00] message, it is the rising of the sun. It
[1:03:03] is the rising of the master. Not will
[1:03:06] be, it is.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; So if it is and it's come to
[1:03:10] manifestation, where are we at? The
[1:03:13] bride is in a maturity. She's ready to
[1:03:15] leave. She's going. Brother, sister, let
[1:03:17] us surrender.
[1:03:27] Matthew 25:10.
[1:03:30] I could read further in those
[1:03:32] scriptures, but I'll just for saving of
[1:03:34] time here, I just make the point there.
[1:03:36] When the master of the house is risen up
[1:03:38] and shut to the door, other words, what
[1:03:40] is he saying? He's saying right here in
[1:03:42] Matthew 25,
[1:03:44] the 10th chapter, 10th verse, excuse me.
[1:03:49] Notice here, notice here that the that
[1:03:52] the that the sound went forth at
[1:03:54] midnight. There was a cry. A cry. Not
[1:03:58] look, brother, sister, we're not looking
[1:04:00] for a cry. We've heard the cry.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom cometh.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; This is the mystery of the of the
[1:04:07] message. This is the mystery. the
[1:04:10] prophet said is how he comes.
[1:04:13] Amen. What's he doing here? The cry has
[1:04:17] gone out. Behold, the bridegroom cometh.
[1:04:19] And they rose up to trim their lamps
[1:04:23] to make ready for his coming.
[1:04:26] And here he is. And he she and she
[1:04:29] realizes the foolish don't I don't have
[1:04:31] oil. And she goes to get oil. Brother
[1:04:33] Brandham before the seals were open
[1:04:34] said, "Don't you men realize here she is
[1:04:37] trying to get oil?" And at that time he
[1:04:39] came.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And we had a we have and we've turned
[1:04:44] from a planting season, a a former rain,
[1:04:48] and the latter rain was being poured out
[1:04:50] to to to to rain upon that seed that
[1:04:53] been planted that begun to spring forth
[1:04:55] and bring it to maturity. And where are
[1:04:57] we at now?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; 60 years down the road. We're not here
[1:05:03] in 65. What's happening now? What's the
[1:05:06] promise now? what's being revealed now.
[1:05:09] God help us. You need to surrender
[1:05:11] completely to God and let him come in
[1:05:13] and show you and lead you and guide you
[1:05:16] and fill you.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; He's in his marriage. Verse 10 here,
[1:05:30] 2510.
[1:05:31] Here they are trying to get it. And he
[1:05:33] comes and while they went to buy the
[1:05:36] bridegroom came, do you realize what the
[1:05:38] opening of the seals was? Do we realize
[1:05:41] what we seen in the heavens? That's
[1:05:43] brother Brandham said when when when
[1:05:46] Rebecca was riding along following the
[1:05:49] message in the message growing, there's
[1:05:51] a silent time there. It was be revealed
[1:05:54] to her. Do you realize that that was
[1:05:56] taking place? What was taking place? The
[1:05:59] revealing of the message, preparing her
[1:06:01] to meet her bridegroom. Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Who's that in the field?"
[1:06:08] And the messenger said, as as the
[1:06:10] prophet said on the message, invisible
[1:06:12] union, "That's our Lord." No, rising of
[1:06:15] the sun. That's our Lord up there.
[1:06:17] That's your Lord.
[1:06:21] And what was she riding on? The very
[1:06:23] thing, the very camel she watered was
[1:06:26] the power. Amen. The white, not the
[1:06:29] original seed, the original word. She
[1:06:31] was watering that and it took her to the
[1:06:34] word made flesh. I wonder where it's
[1:06:36] taking us today. What are we seeing?
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, the marriage has come.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; And while they were and while the
[1:06:49] bridegroom and while they were seek
[1:06:51] while they were went to buy, the
[1:06:52] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[1:06:54] went in with him to the marriage.
[1:06:58] The prophet said, "We've already got the
[1:07:00] marriage." He said the rapture is a
[1:07:02] wedding supper.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And the and the prophet said on page 27
[1:07:06] of perfect faith, he said he's pouring
[1:07:09] himself into her. They are becoming one
[1:07:12] for not the marriage. That marriage is
[1:07:14] already there. They've already becoming
[1:07:16] one for the wedding supper.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; What is the wedding supper? A
[1:07:20] celebration
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; of the marriage. A it's a consummating.
[1:07:24] It's the complete committing
[1:07:26] consummation of that marriage.
[1:07:31] What are we looking for? The fullness of
[1:07:33] redempt the fullness of adoption, which
[1:07:35] is our body change.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; There's something taking place
[1:07:42] that the majority are not getting
[1:07:46] and they can't. But the bride, this
[1:07:49] message, this urgency, it can only be
[1:07:52] seen and received by the bride.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; I don't know who the bride is.
[1:07:59] It's not my duty to know.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; My duty is to tell you what's taking
[1:08:03] place.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; All right. So, here we are. And they
[1:08:10] that already went in went in with him.
[1:08:12] Went in with him.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; He's already come to receive you.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; The opening of the seals was the
[1:08:22] performing of a marriage.
[1:08:24] He said the first duty, the first thing
[1:08:26] of duty I had to do before in the
[1:08:28] opening of seals was to marry a couple
[1:08:30] back in the little room.
[1:08:35] I performed a marriage. What were those
[1:08:38] seals doing?
[1:08:40] They were opening up, revealing, opening
[1:08:44] Christ to you. It's the It's what is it?
[1:08:46] It's the opening of the word. It's the
[1:08:48] third pull.
[1:08:53] And who's it going to be revealed to?
[1:08:55] What's the secret? Who's going to
[1:08:56] receive that secret? Only the bride.
[1:09:01] Amen. All right. He's in his people. The
[1:09:06] prophet said he's in his people. See,
[1:09:09] we're going to a wedding supper. He's in
[1:09:11] his people moving among his bride with a
[1:09:13] love affair to her.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Not to all the women. To her. With a
[1:09:18] love affair to her. She's pregnantated
[1:09:20] with life. She's right now. She's here
[1:09:23] bearing his name, bearing his life.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; If you're going to see Christ today,
[1:09:31] you'll see him outside of meeting him in
[1:09:34] the air, which we're looking for. That
[1:09:36] is what we're looking for. We're looking
[1:09:38] for we're looking for the the uh the
[1:09:41] second Adam to appear.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; But you say, "What has he done?" He's
[1:09:47] already come. He said, "I'll prepare a
[1:09:48] place for you and I'll come again and
[1:09:50] receive you."
[1:09:55] Hallelujah. I'll receive you unto
[1:09:58] myself.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; And that surely that's a receiving of.
[1:10:02] But there's got to be a faith coming
[1:10:04] here right now to prepare you for that
[1:10:06] receiving. There's got to be a
[1:10:07] perfecting of the word. And God's
[1:10:09] calling for your surrender
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; to what? To me? No. To a church? No. To
[1:10:15] the word present with us.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hid behind skin.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; God with skin on him today.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Not another person. He's got skin on
[1:10:26] him.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:31] They are become, he said, pouring in the
[1:10:33] love affair. Pouring out into her. He's
[1:10:36] pouring out into her himself. Then he
[1:10:38] had to be here to POUR OUT OF HIMSELF.
[1:10:41] THERE HAD TO BE there had to be a
[1:10:42] fountain open and you had to partake of
[1:10:44] that fountain. I hope you understand
[1:10:47] what I'm saying. There was a release of
[1:10:49] life
[1:10:52] or brother Brandham couldn't say
[1:10:54] couldn't say she's now pregnant with
[1:10:56] life bearing his name bearing his life
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; bearing the sign bearing himself among
[1:11:04] the people because we see now he had to
[1:11:07] fulfill scripture. There had to be
[1:11:10] himself coming in a bride form
[1:11:13] in the bride form. In order to fulfill
[1:11:16] scripture, in orders to come back to
[1:11:18] Eden and back to the original Eden, he's
[1:11:20] come got to be a full restoration. And
[1:11:23] that's why the LATTER RAIN WAS POURED
[1:11:25] out
[1:11:28] because the the word is growing. The
[1:11:30] word is growing in the bride to a full
[1:11:33] stature. The revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:36] I say this on things that are to be. He
[1:11:39] said the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:11:41] today. Today.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:46] Amen. Is the same. He said it's himself
[1:11:50] again. The revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:53] The same spirit that was in him is in
[1:11:56] us. The same man, the same person is
[1:11:59] here in another actor's garment. Just
[1:12:02] the actor's garment he promised would
[1:12:04] be. It's a royal bride to the royal
[1:12:06] promised son. It's not another seed.
[1:12:09] It's the same seed. It's the original
[1:12:11] word. Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And the revelation of Jesus Christ today
[1:12:16] is growing in a bride.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; To the full stature.
[1:12:23] And he's now he's calling because here
[1:12:25] we are. We've come to this place. We're
[1:12:27] now ready to be changed. And he's
[1:12:29] saying, "Submit yourself. Give yourself
[1:12:32] to me completely.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Don't get out of step. Stay in line.
[1:12:38] Stay in line.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:44] Amen. It sounds like you say, "Brother
[1:12:46] David, you're desperate. You're upset."
[1:12:47] No, I'm not upset. I'm desperate. Yes,
[1:12:49] I'm I'm urgent. I'm I'm bringing an
[1:12:52] urgent message.
[1:12:54] This is maybe the last time. And your
[1:12:57] attitude toward this tonight will
[1:12:59] determine where you're going.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Not their attitude toward me. You may
[1:13:04] not like the way I minister the word.
[1:13:06] Not your attitude toward me. It's your
[1:13:08] attitude toward the word.
[1:13:12] It's toward him.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:13:19] Hallelujah. All right. He's in his
[1:13:22] people. You believe he's in his people.
[1:13:28] Oh my. Not. It's the rising of the sun.
[1:13:30] Not will be. It is now the rising of the
[1:13:33] sun. Then he turned right around and
[1:13:34] said the sun is up.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Right in the same message. She said,
[1:13:39] "The sun is up."
[1:13:44] All right.
[1:13:46] The bride is marching out.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; She's leaving.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; She's going. I wonder, are you on board
[1:13:55] of that? Are you marching? Where are you
[1:13:58] going? Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you right now, it's going to
[1:14:05] take a complete surrender and submission
[1:14:07] to that word.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; You cannot be desperate until God speaks
[1:14:17] to you. Look at the widow woman. He He
[1:14:21] told Elijah, "Go to that town. I I have
[1:14:24] a widow woman in that town where there's
[1:14:27] nothing but poverty, where there's
[1:14:28] nothing but but uh uh no rain. There's
[1:14:31] nothing but uh uh famine,
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; but I've commanded a widow woman
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; to sustain you.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And he had to believe that. He had to
[1:14:42] submit himself to the word to go there.
[1:14:44] And he went there expecting to find the
[1:14:46] widow woman. And the widow woman didn't
[1:14:49] know yet that God had commanded her to
[1:14:51] take care of that prophet.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Take care of the word. Feed it. WATER
[1:14:55] IT. GLORY TO GOD.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And the power THAT WAS IN THAT WORD
[1:14:59] would sustain her and take her to her
[1:15:01] bridegroom. Now there is submission.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; There is surrender.
[1:15:10] And so, and so he come he he came and he
[1:15:14] said, "Bake me a cake while I've only
[1:15:16] got one left. Me and my boy are dying."
[1:15:19] This is the outward appearance of
[1:15:21] things. This is the situation. This is
[1:15:23] where we're at.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; But regardless, he said, "Bake me one
[1:15:27] first."
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; And when she turned and had the right
[1:15:32] mental attitude and turned to surrender
[1:15:34] herself to the word, "And thus saith the
[1:15:37] Lord."
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; The barrel of meal will not be empty and
[1:15:41] the and the cruise will not run die
[1:15:43] until there be rain again upon this
[1:15:45] earth.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; When she turned to surrender herself,
[1:15:49] GOD TOOK CARE OF IT.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's what he's asking us to do.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Submit yourself to the word. I will take
[1:15:56] care of it. I will provide. I will take
[1:15:59] you. I will bring you to your change.
[1:16:01] Don't be weary. Don't be fear anymore.
[1:16:03] Just surrender. Submit yourself. Take me
[1:16:06] at my word. Let go of your fear. Let go
[1:16:08] of your anxiety. Regardless, I don't
[1:16:10] care how it feels. I don't care who says
[1:16:12] what this one says or that one says.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; My,
[1:16:20] you can't be desperate until he speaks
[1:16:22] to you. Oh, church, rise and shake
[1:16:24] yourself. Pinch your conscience. Wake up
[1:16:26] in this hour.
[1:16:29] We must be desperate to perish. There is
[1:16:31] coming forth something from the Lord.
[1:16:33] And he said, I know it as thus sayaeth
[1:16:35] the Lord. and we have it.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; It's the opening of that seventh seal.
[1:16:40] Those seals have been opened. It's thus
[1:16:42] sayeth the Lord.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; And we have it. And he said, "And now we
[1:16:46] don't say it's coming. It's still
[1:16:48] coming. It's arrived. It's here. And
[1:16:50] we've grown our EP in it. We're living
[1:16:52] in it. We're growing in it.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; The bride is coming to a a maturity. She
[1:16:58] knows what she is. She knows where she
[1:16:59] is. She knows what she is. And when she
[1:17:02] knows what she is, the rapture will go.
[1:17:06] Oh, brother, sister, submit yourself.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Don't let me let me just read this
[1:17:13] quote. Let me finish this and let me get
[1:17:15] something to you if I don't get anywhere
[1:17:16] else. All right. Now,
[1:17:21] God in you, I think that the love of God
[1:17:24] causes desperation.
[1:17:27] See, I believe the reason we don't have
[1:17:29] desperation is because it's a lack of
[1:17:30] love. That God, the love of God, I think
[1:17:33] the love of God causes desperation. And
[1:17:36] that's exactly what the lack is. You've
[1:17:38] got so taken up over your affairs, your
[1:17:40] own affairs, your love has become cold.
[1:17:44] I say, God, restore that first love.
[1:17:46] Restore that zeal. Restore that desire
[1:17:49] that I had to surrender and completely
[1:17:51] yield myself to you out of love. Not out
[1:17:54] of Not out of your duty. How do you
[1:17:55] think your duty? God doesn't want your
[1:17:57] duty. He doesn't want anything you can
[1:17:58] produce. He wants your love. And your
[1:18:01] love is trust. AND YOU'LL OBEY his
[1:18:03] commandment. And in order to do so, you
[1:18:05] give yourself to him. Jesus himself
[1:18:07] learned obedience through the things he
[1:18:10] suffered. You're going to suffer. You're
[1:18:12] going to go through these things, but
[1:18:13] God has allowed it. And all you can do
[1:18:15] is say, "God, I rejoice in that because
[1:18:18] you are fulfilling a purpose that you've
[1:18:20] given to me in the body." Then I can
[1:18:22] say, "Hallelujah. So be it. I give
[1:18:24] myself to your word to fulfill what you
[1:18:26] desire. For your ways are perfect.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And you have said
[1:18:35] you made my way perfect.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right.
[1:18:41] We must be desperate to perish. It's
[1:18:43] coming from the Lord. I know it as thus
[1:18:45] sayith the Lord. We know it now as thus
[1:18:47] sayith the Lord. In fact, the bride has
[1:18:48] thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:18:51] Amen.
[1:18:53] I know it. There is coming forth
[1:18:55] something. There is, not there will be.
[1:18:57] There's coming forth something. We
[1:18:59] better get desperate. It's between life
[1:19:01] and death. It'll pass through us and we
[1:19:03] won't see it. And I want you to know
[1:19:05] it's passing through and many are not
[1:19:08] seeing it. I'm not saying how many, this
[1:19:09] one or that one. That's none of my
[1:19:11] business. I just know there's very few.
[1:19:13] Straight as the gate narrows away and
[1:19:15] few that find it. I don't care. But I
[1:19:17] want to be one of those few. How am I
[1:19:19] going to do it? Submission. Surrender.
[1:19:21] Amen.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Surrender to my will. Surrender to my
[1:19:26] word. Surrender to the words that I've
[1:19:28] spoken it. Surrender to thus, sayaith
[1:19:30] the Lord. Surrender to what's happening.
[1:19:32] It's moving right through us right now.
[1:19:34] It's not a public show. Amen. The bride
[1:19:37] has a hold of it. It's the secret that
[1:19:39] no one knows but her. And that's what
[1:19:42] we're preaching about. That mystery.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a hidden It's still not hidden.
[1:19:46] It's open.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; And there's a bride partaking of it. And
[1:19:51] the call is going out. The revelation's
[1:19:53] still going out. Why? Because there
[1:19:55] still may be one more. I don't know. But
[1:19:58] I know that he's risen up. And the next
[1:20:00] thing is a shutting of the door. It may
[1:20:02] be shut. I don't know. The ministry is
[1:20:04] going to still go on. It's going to
[1:20:06] still go on to the eternal lost, but
[1:20:08] it's still going to be for the brides
[1:20:10] who are still here. And there's still a
[1:20:12] perfecting through that word. There's a
[1:20:14] perfecting of that bride. There's a
[1:20:16] growth of that bride. Until everyone
[1:20:18] comes into that full growth. He's going
[1:20:20] to take her out of here. And it will,
[1:20:22] it's such a sudden thing, but it's
[1:20:23] already been happening.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; But those not expecting it can say,
[1:20:29] "Well, I thought the rapture was to take
[1:20:32] place before." And we already see we
[1:20:35] already see judgment struck the West
[1:20:36] Coast.
[1:20:39] Brother Bram said, "The wrath of God's
[1:20:41] belching right beneath you, LA.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; When and how long, I don't know. But
[1:20:46] this but you're going to sink."
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're under judgment.
[1:20:51] Listen, we see it all the time. Where's
[1:20:54] Where's the greatest point of judgment?
[1:20:56] LA. You see it over and over and over
[1:21:00] again.
[1:21:05] Three blasts said judgment striking West
[1:21:07] Coast.
[1:21:11] Amen. A great earthquake. Alaskan
[1:21:13] earthquake. I don't know if you were in
[1:21:15] that. No, you weren't. Too young.
[1:21:17] weren't born yet. Who was it that told
[1:21:19] me they Oh, yes. Sister Amy King that I
[1:21:22] was in that earthquake.
[1:21:25] You talk about talk about scary.
[1:21:31] Probably one of the if not the greatest
[1:21:33] earthquake that the earth has had. But
[1:21:35] brother Ram said it that earthquake
[1:21:37] didn't unbalance it, but the next one
[1:21:39] will.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:42] And he said it was a a judgment sign
[1:21:46] because when Jesus died there was a
[1:21:48] great earthquake. And he said by that
[1:21:50] earthquake he told us it means that
[1:21:53] Jesus Christ has been officially put
[1:21:55] out.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; If you're going to be married to be here
[1:21:59] to be married to
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; but he's here in spirit form. He's not
[1:22:03] here as a Calvary man. You're going to
[1:22:05] meet him.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; But his spirit is here in a bride form.
[1:22:10] He's taken up a position. The garment
[1:22:12] has changed. Why? Because the curtain is
[1:22:14] raised.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Things are happening that hardly anybody
[1:22:18] knows about.
[1:22:21] Amen. And I don't know how many or how
[1:22:24] few. I don't care. But there's one thing
[1:22:25] I must know. That's who I know.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And he never said it would be a group
[1:22:30] get it. He said it' be individuals.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And they don't understand you no more.
[1:22:36] They understand him
[1:22:38] because they because they're like the
[1:22:40] wind. It goes where it listeth and
[1:22:42] returneth. And you don't know the
[1:22:43] circuit because you're not born again.
[1:22:47] Because everyone that's born again would
[1:22:49] understand where the wind moves and how
[1:22:51] it moves. And you see what I'm saying?
[1:22:53] You'd go back to St. John 3. I'm going
[1:22:56] off my way here, but I'll just leave it
[1:22:58] with you.
[1:23:04] He said, "I believe it'll throw us into
[1:23:08] desperation." When you see the
[1:23:10] conditions of times and people waiting
[1:23:12] in sin the way they are, it'll throw you
[1:23:14] into desperation.
[1:23:24] I believe it will. Desperation calls for
[1:23:27] a subject. And when that subject, no
[1:23:29] matter how faint it is, it's received.
[1:23:32] It's believed right then because faith
[1:23:34] catches catches when desperation is
[1:23:36] pushing it. Love in there mixes with it
[1:23:39] and brings it brings it to it.
[1:23:43] Desperation does it.
[1:23:48] Amen.
[1:23:51] in 1 Thessalonians 5. You don't have to
[1:23:54] if you'd like to turn 1 Thessalonians
[1:23:56] the 5th chapter
[1:24:05] and verse 20
[1:24:08] through 24.
[1:24:10] Prove all things, hold fast to that
[1:24:12] which is good.
[1:24:16] Abstain from all appearance of evil. And
[1:24:19] the very God of peace sanctify you holy.
[1:24:22] And I pray God your whole spirit, soul,
[1:24:26] and body be preserved blameless unto the
[1:24:30] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:24:32] Faithful is he that calleth you, who
[1:24:35] also will do it. Then let's go. Let go
[1:24:38] and let him do it.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Faithful is he that calleth you. How
[1:24:44] many's been called? How many know he
[1:24:45] called you?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Then he can't leave you. He's got to do
[1:24:49] it. What is he? What what's your Lord
[1:24:51] asking you to do? Surrender yourself to
[1:24:53] me
[1:24:57] and let me place you. Let me guide you.
[1:25:00] Let me bring you into that change. You
[1:25:04] cannot you cannot bring yourself. And
[1:25:07] here you're going through situation that
[1:25:08] you're trying in your own ability to
[1:25:10] take care of. You need to surrender. You
[1:25:13] need to submit yourself to God
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; and act on the word. Forget Listen, I'm
[1:25:19] going to read this thing, okay?
[1:25:26] Calling you to oneness with him alone,
[1:25:29] one with your husband, the word in a
[1:25:31] perfect relationship with him alone. No
[1:25:33] flirting with another seed or another
[1:25:35] man. No mixing as Eve did.
[1:25:39] When you go to flirting with another
[1:25:41] man, what's happening? You're flirting
[1:25:44] with Satan.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And that man can be this man right here.
[1:25:50] This man, you're that man.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; You're flirting with it. You're
[1:25:56] listening to two things. You're
[1:25:57] double-minded. You're not settled on one
[1:25:59] mind here. You're divided in interest. A
[1:26:03] double-minded man is unstable. Yeah,
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; his ways are confusing because he's
[1:26:07] trying to divide himself between two
[1:26:09] interests
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; instead of giving himself in total
[1:26:12] submission to the word. He's trying to
[1:26:14] divide himself, trying to live in
[1:26:16] between.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, brother, sister, religion
[1:26:22] is full of that.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't and it's not kept out of
[1:26:29] the message arena either.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; It's full of it.
[1:26:35] you're trying to divide yourself instead
[1:26:36] of giving yourself absolute completely
[1:26:38] fully to the word and let him lead you
[1:26:41] through your struggles and your trials
[1:26:42] and let him guide that. Let him take
[1:26:44] care of that. Let him guide where you
[1:26:46] are and not where you are. Amen. Let him
[1:26:48] do it. Give yourself to him and quit
[1:26:50] your complaining about it and rest in
[1:26:52] it. I don't care what it looks like and
[1:26:54] how it feels. Give yourself over to it.
[1:27:00] But the probably reason you don't is
[1:27:02] because you're afraid to. You might as
[1:27:04] well just hit the thing right in the
[1:27:06] head. You are fearful that God won't
[1:27:08] keep his word.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason you would stay
[1:27:13] because you're listening trying to hear
[1:27:15] another voice.
[1:27:22] Okay, I'm going to I'm going to have to
[1:27:24] Okay, listen to me.
[1:27:26] Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[1:27:36] Why do you hunger, church?
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; How many's got a hunger?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Why do you hunger, church? Why do you
[1:27:43] thirst?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Good question.
[1:27:47] Why do you hunger? Why do you thirst?
[1:27:50] I'm not talking about natural. I'm
[1:27:52] talking about spiritual things of God.
[1:27:54] Why do you hunger? There's something in
[1:27:55] you hungry. There's got to be a deep to
[1:27:57] answer that call.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Why do you thirst? There's got to be
[1:28:00] something to satisfy that thirst.
[1:28:03] Why do you hunger? Why do you thirst?
[1:28:05] It's the father trying to reveal this
[1:28:08] hidden secret to you.
[1:28:13] But
[1:28:16] you let
[1:28:18] May God just drive this home. But you
[1:28:20] let so many things get it out of you.
[1:28:27] That absolute so many things are getting
[1:28:30] it out of you. You let your job,
[1:28:38] you let your wife,
[1:28:41] you let your husband,
[1:28:43] you let your children. I am quoting what
[1:28:45] the prophet said here. It's not my
[1:28:47] thought. I say amen to it. Lord, I want
[1:28:49] to surrender myself to this. You let
[1:28:52] your job, your job is overcoming the
[1:28:55] word. There's no preeminence of the
[1:28:57] word. It's your job that has
[1:28:59] preeminence.
[1:29:02] It's your It's your It's your emotions
[1:29:06] that have preeminence. It's your
[1:29:07] children that have preeminence. You're
[1:29:09] listening to them instead of hearing the
[1:29:11] word.
[1:29:13] If you would turn and give yourself over
[1:29:14] to the word, God would take care of all
[1:29:16] of that. Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; But as long as you're trying, he moves
[1:29:19] his hand back and you can keep trying,
[1:29:21] but you'll never make it.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You've got to yield completely to what
[1:29:26] the word said. Submit yourself.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; If the word said this and this and do
[1:29:33] this and this, then give yourself to it
[1:29:35] and submit yourself and quit trying to
[1:29:38] figure it out. Only believe.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; But you let so many things
[1:29:47] job, wife, husband, children, cares of
[1:29:50] the world,
[1:29:53] cares of money, cares of property, it's
[1:29:56] all happening. It's all taking premise.
[1:29:58] Satan saying, "Oh, but if you don't do
[1:29:59] this, you don't do that." I learned that
[1:30:01] a long time ago. I had a business and I
[1:30:04] never could write any business as long
[1:30:05] as I took it first and put it first. But
[1:30:07] as soon as I put God first, placed him
[1:30:10] first, put it first, I got more business
[1:30:12] written and got paperwork done. God was
[1:30:15] teaching me, you've got to put you first
[1:30:17] the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God
[1:30:20] is his word made spirit in you. Then why
[1:30:22] don't you let him in you lead you and
[1:30:24] guide you? Why are you trying in your
[1:30:26] own spirit to do it?
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Don't lift up yourself as an idol
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; and you place that before God. Anything
[1:30:40] that comes before God is an idol.
[1:30:44] There's only one thing and only one way
[1:30:46] you're going to make it and that's
[1:30:47] Christ.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; You may not understand. He never asked
[1:30:53] you to understand. He asked you to
[1:30:54] trust. You don't have to understand how
[1:30:56] the shepherd leads. He said, "Trust me.
[1:30:59] Trust me.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; If you love me, trust me." Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; And if you're not discerning the
[1:31:11] difference, you need a you need a birth
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; because without the Holy Spirit in you,
[1:31:16] you will never discern the difference.
[1:31:17] These two spirits are not. There's these
[1:31:21] two seeds are so close in their
[1:31:23] manifestation because they're both and
[1:31:25] I'm I'm I'm leading into Sunday and I'll
[1:31:27] just speak this. They're both anointed
[1:31:30] of the genuine Holy Ghost.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; But one can't surren to the word and the
[1:31:36] other does because they are the word.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And it would be so close it would
[1:31:42] deceive the elected if possible.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Now I'm just going to say that in case
[1:31:47] somebody's missing.
[1:31:52] I'm going to stop it right there. I'm
[1:31:53] going to continue on what I'm saying
[1:31:55] here. Cares of the world. You let the
[1:31:57] pastor, you let a preacher, you let a
[1:31:59] minister, somebody else, friends, you
[1:32:02] let friends, you let relation,
[1:32:04] feelings, senses, and on and on we could
[1:32:08] go. Properties.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:12] Since when do any of these things you're
[1:32:14] going to leave them? You never got them.
[1:32:16] You never brought them into the earth.
[1:32:17] You're going to leave without them. Why
[1:32:19] don't we just submit ourselves to God
[1:32:21] and let go of it and let God handle
[1:32:23] these things
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; and let the peace of God rule in your
[1:32:27] heart instead of you ruling?
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; See how close that is between spirit and
[1:32:35] soul. That's why it took the word to
[1:32:38] show the difference.
[1:32:40] It would divide a sunder between spirit
[1:32:42] and soul, between who you are and who
[1:32:45] you aren't.
[1:32:51] Amen.
[1:32:53] Somebody else, friends, relation,
[1:32:56] feelings. Don't let self, as I already
[1:32:58] said this, become your idol, an idol or
[1:33:01] your idol between you and God. No mixing
[1:33:04] of the seed.
[1:33:09] You say, "That stung, brother David. You
[1:33:11] might as well just I'm preaching it to
[1:33:12] myself, too. You might as well just let
[1:33:14] it sting because it's going to do you
[1:33:16] good. It's going to separate you. And
[1:33:19] God calls for total separation from
[1:33:22] anyone, anything, anybody that would
[1:33:24] stand between you and that word.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; God's word, God's word. Do we believe
[1:33:29] God's word? God's word calls for a total
[1:33:32] separation from unbelief.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not telling you don't go out
[1:33:35] and work. I'm not telling you don't
[1:33:37] you're not going to have struggles. I'm
[1:33:38] not telling you that. But you have the
[1:33:39] word.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; That ought to be your rest. We've
[1:33:43] entered. If you've entered into rest,
[1:33:45] you ceased from your labors.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Then don't pick up your labors again.
[1:33:51] It's dead. That old man is dead. You're
[1:33:53] eternally separated from him.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; God shown you where you stand. God shows
[1:33:57] you who you are. God has already given
[1:33:59] you his spirit to show you that the work
[1:34:02] was finished. He's already predestinated
[1:34:04] everywhere you go, everything you'll do.
[1:34:06] Just yield to him and let him lead you
[1:34:08] by the word. He is the word. He's not
[1:34:10] going to lead you any other way. Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad your situation is.
[1:34:15] Don't quit saying woe is me. Woe is me.
[1:34:17] You're just putting yourself in front of
[1:34:19] the word.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; There's no woe is you.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God and a seed of
[1:34:26] God, there is no woe is you.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Quit saying that. Oh, God help me to get
[1:34:32] to these. I had some things I wanted to
[1:34:34] bring in that and I don't know when I'm
[1:34:36] going to preach again. But anyway, let's
[1:34:39] Here's the question.
[1:34:41] Ask brother Brandham.
[1:34:45] I've read this before. I'm going to read
[1:34:46] it again. I feel very rich. He The
[1:34:49] question is, you can't surrender to
[1:34:50] Jesus. I can't give over over completely
[1:34:54] to Jesus. Have I an evil spirit? You
[1:34:57] can't surrender to Jesus. Why? What's
[1:35:00] the matter? If you are a woman, don't
[1:35:01] you have to surrender to your husband to
[1:35:03] be a wife? Surrender all you are. A
[1:35:06] little lady when you were married,
[1:35:07] virtuous, fought all your life to stay
[1:35:09] virtuous, but one day you found a man
[1:35:11] that you loved and you were his
[1:35:13] completely. You were his completely. Put
[1:35:16] it to the spiritual here. You were his
[1:35:19] completely.
[1:35:23] If you're a married woman, the way you
[1:35:24] serve your husband is the way you're
[1:35:26] serving God
[1:35:28] because it's going to reveal what what
[1:35:30] your condition is with God.
[1:35:34] All right. You were his completely. The
[1:35:37] things that you fought against all your
[1:35:39] life and tried to live queen, clean, and
[1:35:41] clear, and virtuous. Now you surrender
[1:35:44] every bit of it to one man. Oh, that's
[1:35:46] hard. Oh, that's hard. Brother David, my
[1:35:49] He's done so many things wrong. And I
[1:35:51] think he's wrong. And he said this.
[1:35:52] There you go. You're letting something
[1:35:55] else
[1:35:57] instead of the word
[1:36:00] lead you.
[1:36:05] I don't care if he's the dirtiest one
[1:36:07] alive. If you married him, you serve him
[1:36:11] and do everything he asked you to do and
[1:36:13] you submitted yourself to him.
[1:36:17] Unless he asks you to do something
[1:36:18] that's contrary to that word,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; then you take your stand for the word.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; But you are there to serve him. I don't
[1:36:27] care if you disagree with him. Then pray
[1:36:29] with him and pray for him and quit
[1:36:31] listening to this one and to that one
[1:36:33] and to the other one to imprint and
[1:36:35] listening to the devil to put you and
[1:36:37] bind you and separate you. That is not
[1:36:41] God. That's the enemy doing that.
[1:36:46] Amen.
[1:36:52] You put yourself completely in his
[1:36:54] hands. You are his.
[1:36:57] You You sell out. You surrender every
[1:36:59] bit of it to one man. All that you've
[1:37:01] stood for in decency and moral and
[1:37:03] everything like that. Now you turn it
[1:37:04] over to a man because you surrender
[1:37:07] yourself to the man. Can't you do the
[1:37:09] same thing to Jesus Christ? Just
[1:37:11] surrender yourself that way. All that I
[1:37:13] am, all my mind, all my thoughts, my
[1:37:16] hands, my feet, my ears, my eyes,
[1:37:18] everything. Surrender it. Give it over
[1:37:21] certainly.
[1:37:23] And quit thinking it's a drudgery to do
[1:37:25] it.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Quit thinking the devil putting a reason
[1:37:28] in you and you like you're bound. Oh,
[1:37:30] I'm so bound. I could be freed.
[1:37:35] You're only free when you let Christ
[1:37:37] have his way.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; There's your freedom. who the Son sets
[1:37:42] free is free indeed.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; I don't think you possess of an evil
[1:37:51] spirit.
[1:37:53] I think the evil spirit anoints you with
[1:37:55] them kind of thoughts.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:38:00] Exactly.
[1:38:01] Because what he's saying you and
[1:38:03] thinking you to believe is contrary to
[1:38:05] the word.
[1:38:08] Then just simply repent. Turn around and
[1:38:11] go the way of the word. Change.
[1:38:16] How do you change? Submit yourself to
[1:38:17] the word.
[1:38:19] Do what he said to do. Whether you feel
[1:38:21] like it, whether it looks radical to
[1:38:24] your thinking, you have committed
[1:38:26] yourself to God. Then let go and believe
[1:38:28] he's deleting you. Regardless of what
[1:38:30] you think,
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; you either will believe what you've done
[1:38:35] or you don't believe it.
[1:38:39] You've either given him headship and
[1:38:40] rest in that whether the things happen
[1:38:42] the way you didn't think it would
[1:38:44] happen. Remember what he said? It's so
[1:38:46] good and so pleasant to say, "Here am I,
[1:38:48] Lord. Then lead me, guide me, direct me
[1:38:51] in what pleases you, and then don't
[1:38:53] murmur when it doesn't go the way you
[1:38:55] thought it should."
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:39:07] You're not the watchman over your house.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; He is.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Whether it be husband, your husband, the
[1:39:15] Lord, he's the watchman.
[1:39:19] And he's got a duty to do to keep it
[1:39:21] lined with the word. And if you don't
[1:39:23] obey that word,
[1:39:25] he's not the blame.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:36] Not easy, is it? It's hard.
[1:39:42] He said, "You cannot surrender yourself
[1:39:44] to God." Let me show you something. Why
[1:39:46] would you want to surrender to him?
[1:39:49] See, the lady's asking, "Do I have an
[1:39:52] evil spirit? I can't surrender to
[1:39:54] Jesus." And yet, she wants to.
[1:39:57] And you're sitting here, you want to
[1:40:01] Amen. All right. What's he saying then?
[1:40:04] Because there's Why would you want to
[1:40:06] surrender to him? Because there's
[1:40:07] something out there calling to you to
[1:40:09] surrender.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; It's a very good sign that you ought to
[1:40:13] surrender yourself. And now all you do,
[1:40:15] brother, sister, might be a young person
[1:40:17] or old, whatever it is, just find
[1:40:19] themselves. So they can, they just can't
[1:40:21] find themselves to completely surrender.
[1:40:23] Just give yourself over.
[1:40:28] to a loving father, to a loving husband,
[1:40:30] to a loving
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; bridegroom. Just give yourself over.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; You see how that contra your humanness?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Well, I know I can do it. If you go
[1:40:45] along and think you have an ability to
[1:40:47] do anything in your human ability, you
[1:40:49] need to lose that. In order to please
[1:40:52] God and fulfill his purpose, you must
[1:40:54] master the thought of any human ability.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. God can't use your ability. You
[1:41:04] have to give it to him.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Don't you go out thinking you have an
[1:41:08] ability to do such and such. Because as
[1:41:11] long, brother, as long as you're
[1:41:12] thinking of that, he said it will fail.
[1:41:17] Amen.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Go back. go back and listen to the
[1:41:22] message perfect strength by perfect
[1:41:25] weakness and see what he said.
[1:41:29] All right, I'm I'm just going to close
[1:41:31] here. Very close to it. All right, what
[1:41:35] do we need to do? Take up your cross
[1:41:38] daily. Deny yourself. Take up your cross
[1:41:41] and follow him.
[1:41:44] What are you doing when you take up your
[1:41:45] cross? You're crucifying self.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:50] You're submitting yourself to the word.
[1:41:55] It's either you're absolute or you're
[1:41:57] your absolute.
[1:42:04] Amen. While we look not at the things
[1:42:06] which are seen, but the things which are
[1:42:08] not seen, for the that's the look focus.
[1:42:12] While we look at the things that are
[1:42:15] seen are temporal, the things that are
[1:42:16] not seen are eternal.
[1:42:23] when he leads us to a life of complete
[1:42:25] surrender and service to him. I wonder
[1:42:26] if our spirits and something sometimes
[1:42:29] don't rebel and kind of showing the
[1:42:30] wonder if we are lambs. A lamb is
[1:42:33] obedient.
[1:42:37] Amen.
[1:42:39] And that's the way a real Christian is.
[1:42:41] Self-sacrifice themselves, caring
[1:42:43] nothing for this world, but giving they
[1:42:45] all they got to God.
[1:42:48] You see, that's all you have to do. Just
[1:42:51] give yourself to a loving father. Give
[1:42:53] all that you are
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; and let go and quit your fredding.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Quit your fearing that it won't work.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Because as long as that's there, you
[1:43:04] haven't surrendered.
[1:43:06] You need to surren I'm not saying it
[1:43:08] won't come. Sure, it'll come. Satan's
[1:43:10] going to put all kinds of things out
[1:43:11] there to get you off of that. He doesn't
[1:43:13] want you on the word because he can't
[1:43:15] defeat it. That's right.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; As long as you stay in the word. Oh,
[1:43:18] he'll try. He'll try to bring this
[1:43:19] thought. He'll try to do this. He'll say
[1:43:21] this through somebody and that through
[1:43:23] somebody. But give yourself to the word.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; That's your place. That's Are you his
[1:43:31] wife?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then your position is give
[1:43:34] yourself to him
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; all that you are
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; and quit worrying about how it's going
[1:43:39] to happen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Quit worrying about it when it's going
[1:43:42] to happen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; And let him take care of that.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; And if there's a question about doing
[1:43:54] anything, listen to what your Lord is
[1:43:56] leading you to do. Don't do it.
[1:43:59] Because a question is not faith. Faith
[1:44:02] is knowing.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; This may question,
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; but that soul won't question when it's
[1:44:08] led by God.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; So, you're not living by this. You're
[1:44:11] living by this.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; You live by faith. You don't live from
[1:44:15] your head. What you think
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; in your head. You're not living by what
[1:44:19] you think in your head.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; You're living by faith in the heart.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Then you need to learn how to speak from
[1:44:26] the heart, act from the heart, do from
[1:44:29] the heart.
[1:44:32] do from that little room. Live that. If
[1:44:35] you walk in the spirit, you will not if
[1:44:37] you live in the spirit, you'll not
[1:44:38] fulfill the lust of the flesh. Then
[1:44:40] let's let us not only live in the
[1:44:42] spirit, let us walk in the spirit.
[1:44:54] Now we see the promise being fulfilled.
[1:44:57] Christ our headship is going in coming
[1:44:59] in his bride. Then the head and the body
[1:45:01] are becoming one in works in sign in
[1:45:05] life vindicated by God himself through
[1:45:07] his promised word for the last day.
[1:45:09] Vindicated by God himself through the
[1:45:11] promised word for the last days. He
[1:45:13] promised this in the last days. Now if
[1:45:15] you're spiritual,
[1:45:17] that's to have the mind of Christ. If
[1:45:19] you're spiritual, God in you, you'll
[1:45:22] catch it.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; You're going to see it. You're going to
[1:45:27] see your day. You'll see your hour. The
[1:45:29] evidence is that you have the ability to
[1:45:32] receive his word for the season. The
[1:45:35] season back is not 1965. The season is
[1:45:38] 62 years later.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; That prophecy of that of that prophet we
[1:45:44] are now fulfilling. We see in it being
[1:45:46] fulfilled. What was what was prophecy
[1:45:50] modern events made clear by prophecy.
[1:45:53] Now we see the prophecy. I'm fulfilling
[1:45:55] it. You're fulfilling it. We see the
[1:45:57] prophecy fulfilled.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; What day are we in? How close are we?
[1:46:04] If he said it's close there and he
[1:46:05] brought the prophecy and the word could
[1:46:07] not fail. God will fulfill all his word.
[1:46:09] What about right now? We better get
[1:46:11] desperate. We better surrender. It's an
[1:46:14] urgency.
[1:46:16] One more thing and I'm closing because I
[1:46:20] can't fulfill all this.
[1:46:22] When the bride has been committed to the
[1:46:24] groom, a marriage has taken place. When
[1:46:27] the bride is committed to the groom, she
[1:46:29] takes off her veil and places it over
[1:46:32] the groom's shoulders. What's that
[1:46:34] signifying? That not only is she under
[1:46:37] his dominion?
[1:46:40] Are you listening?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Over his dominion. That she has
[1:46:45] transferred her rights to him. That he
[1:46:48] is the head. What is he the head of?
[1:46:51] He's the head of the body.
[1:46:55] Amen. What's our head? The head of the
[1:46:57] body. And who's his body? You. Who? He's
[1:47:00] the head of his house.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; And you are his house.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Then who has the preeminence over his
[1:47:08] house? The master,
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; the Lord.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; The headship, the headstone.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; We have a capstone message. Do you
[1:47:18] believe this message is a capstone
[1:47:19] message?
[1:47:21] Then let's follow him.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; The body is submitted to the head.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Are they not becoming one for the
[1:47:34] wedding supper?
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:47:41] she belongs to him and him alone. That
[1:47:43] he bears the responsibility. She
[1:47:45] transferred her right. She bears the
[1:47:47] responsibility and the care. And that he
[1:47:48] alone, no one else, no other man, no
[1:47:50] other seed, no other power has any right
[1:47:52] and responsibility. And that beloved is
[1:47:54] the key. That beloved is the key.
[1:47:57] Submission is the key.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; He is sovereign. God by divine decreed
[1:48:08] said who would be in his bride. He
[1:48:09] elected her. He chose her. She did not
[1:48:11] choose him. He called her. She did not
[1:48:13] come on her own. He died for her. He
[1:48:16] washed her in his own blood. He paid the
[1:48:17] price for she belongs to him and to him
[1:48:21] alone.
[1:48:24] Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Him alone.
[1:48:29] No one else.
[1:48:31] She is wholly committed to him. Holy.
[1:48:33] Holy committed. Totally committed.
[1:48:36] Completely committed to him. And he
[1:48:40] accepts. This is the beautiful art. And
[1:48:42] he accepts the obligation.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Rest in it.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Rely on it.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Trust him. He accepts it. He's accepted.
[1:48:52] You put his veil over his shoulders.
[1:48:54] Leave it there. Don't pick it up and
[1:48:56] say, "Well, it's my veil."
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; No, you've given it to him.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Then let him lead you contrary to your
[1:49:08] natural carnal reasoning of what you
[1:49:10] think is best. Let him lead you.
[1:49:14] This has to come to a complete
[1:49:15] surrender. It must come to a total
[1:49:17] trust.
[1:49:20] This is the urgency of the day. This is
[1:49:22] what it takes to meet the challenge of
[1:49:25] the day.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Who's going to meet the challenge?
[1:49:30] They that believe the word.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; They that can take him
[1:49:38] at his word. So be it unto me according
[1:49:42] to thy word. Without murmuring, without
[1:49:44] any feeling, the angel said, "This is
[1:49:47] what's going to happen." The angel, the
[1:49:50] Holy Ghost, will overshadow you before
[1:49:52] you're married. And that holy one in you
[1:49:54] will be the word living.
[1:49:57] It's a word birth. It's a spoken word
[1:50:00] birth. So is it in you spiritually. It's
[1:50:03] a word birth.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:12] What are you going to do with him?
[1:50:15] Trust him. Live for him. Commit yourself
[1:50:18] to him. Quit trying to figure out what
[1:50:20] he meant than what he said. Let it go
[1:50:22] and trust your shepherd.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Though it looks very dark where you're
[1:50:28] at, quit trying to figure out what
[1:50:30] you're hap what's happening. Trust him.
[1:50:32] Give yourself over to him. Let go. take
[1:50:34] him at his word and close the ears and
[1:50:38] close the eyes to everything contrary
[1:50:41] your feelings to that word
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; and give it over into his hands and when
[1:50:47] you place it in his hand don't you dare
[1:50:49] take it back
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; brother sister it's not a law I'm
[1:50:57] telling you you're going to make
[1:50:59] mistakes but you have a word to lean
[1:51:01] back on when you do right back right
[1:51:04] back to the word. And he'll show you.
[1:51:06] And when he shows you, that's his love
[1:51:08] projected to you, keeping you, holding
[1:51:10] you, keeping you in line.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; He's before me and he's standing behind
[1:51:15] me.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; He knows my thoughts.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; He's already predestinated where you'd
[1:51:23] be. So be it unto me, Lord, according to
[1:51:26] thy word. I've read you the word. Here's
[1:51:28] what he said. Now, so be it unto me. I
[1:51:31] say as an individual, so be it unto me
[1:51:33] according to thy word.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; The power lays in his word.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; You have the mind of Christ. If you have
[1:51:44] the mind of Christ, you will not
[1:51:46] disbelieve that word. You will submit
[1:51:50] yourself in total surrender. He's taken
[1:51:52] a bride out of here that's surrendered
[1:51:54] to him because it's a love affair.
[1:51:58] You don't love. You don't love anything
[1:52:00] else greater. Nothing. Nothing more.
[1:52:02] Believing nothing more. Nothing else can
[1:52:04] separate you. You're going to lay
[1:52:06] everything else. If you lose everything,
[1:52:07] you've got it all.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; If you lose everything, they take house,
[1:52:11] they take land, they take money. I don't
[1:52:13] know what they're going to take. But
[1:52:14] don't you weary and don't you fear of it
[1:52:16] because you have him. You have
[1:52:18] everything you need.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Do you not realize that he's a creator
[1:52:23] and he creates through your lips?
[1:52:27] Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Surrender yourself to the word.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; I was going to go into that speaking
[1:52:34] sewing. I'll have to do that another
[1:52:36] time.
[1:52:39] What is the key? Full surrender to God.
[1:52:42] Amen. That's what it takes. A complete
[1:52:44] surrender. God wants to surrender. How
[1:52:47] can you show your realities before you
[1:52:49] surrender to him? You've got to
[1:52:51] surrender. How can you show his
[1:52:53] realities unless you surrender to him?
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; He want How many want to see more of
[1:52:58] him, more manifestation? Then let go
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; and submit yourself to him. God bless
[1:53:08] you. Let's stand.
[1:53:14] I know we're always wanting to do
[1:53:16] something and put our part in something
[1:53:18] we know we ought to do. But brother,
[1:53:21] sister,
[1:53:23] that's not the way it works.
[1:53:26] You can't do it that way.
[1:53:29] And no ability, I don't care whose it
[1:53:31] is, will never be usable in the sight of
[1:53:33] God. God has to get all of our abilities
[1:53:36] out of us before he can achieve his
[1:53:39] purpose.
[1:53:43] Now, I'm not saying God didn't give you
[1:53:44] an ability, then give it back to him.
[1:53:46] Quit trying through your ability.
[1:53:48] Let God take it. Let God take your hand.
[1:53:51] Let God take you and do what he wants
[1:53:54] through you. And quit trying to find
[1:53:57] fault with how he made you. Quit trying
[1:54:00] to find fault with what he's doing with
[1:54:03] you. Simply take him at his word.
[1:54:17] Let's so run that we may obtain. Okay,
[1:54:21] we got a goal to We got a goal. How'd
[1:54:24] that boy say on that platform or that
[1:54:26] panel riding that bike? Because he got
[1:54:29] this focus on the end. He quit looking
[1:54:32] around what was around him.
[1:54:36] Stay focused.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:54:42] You've committed yourself to God. You've
[1:54:44] given yourself over to a service. Then
[1:54:46] let's start fulfilling it.
[1:54:50] And quit trying to put these other
[1:54:51] things in front of you.
[1:54:58] Quit letting so many things take it out
[1:55:01] of you. God wants to reveal himself in a
[1:55:04] closer relationship than he ever has.
[1:55:07] He's got to take you home. Then let's
[1:55:10] let go and let him take you. Let go. Let
[1:55:17] let go
[1:55:19] and let God have
[1:55:22] his wonderful
[1:55:26] way.
[1:55:28] Let go
[1:55:30] and let God have his way.
[1:55:39] Your sorrow
[1:55:41] will vanish.
[1:55:44] Your night turn to day
[1:55:48] when you let go and let God have his
[1:55:55] way. Let me just read something to you
[1:55:58] here. Proverbs 18:10
[1:56:02] says, "The name of the Lord is a mighty
[1:56:04] tower. The righteous run into it and are
[1:56:08] saved. See, you're married. What's your
[1:56:11] name?
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Where is his name? Where's his name
[1:56:14] revealed?
[1:56:16] In his house. In you.
[1:56:19] In that day, the son of man will be
[1:56:21] revealed. What will it be revealed for?
[1:56:23] To join the church to the head. Unite
[1:56:26] the marriage of the lamb. The bridegroom
[1:56:28] call will come right through this. When
[1:56:31] the son of man will come down and come
[1:56:33] in human flesh. Who's human flesh? The
[1:56:36] prophets.
[1:56:39] Just like he did to Sarah and Abraham.
[1:56:42] God has come in flesh again. Do you
[1:56:44] believe that?
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Turned his back to him to show that the
[1:56:50] same thing that happened to Abraham is
[1:56:51] happening to us.
[1:56:54] But who's going to conceive seed?
[1:56:57] Be the bride because she submits herself
[1:57:01] to him.
[1:57:04] Amen.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Let him change you. Let him mold you.
[1:57:08] Let him do what he wants to do with you.
[1:57:10] And quit your complaining.
[1:57:14] Quit your murmuring.
[1:57:16] That's unbelief.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; You're you're sowing through your lips
[1:57:20] and you're going to reap that. And
[1:57:22] you're trapped. You're snared by your
[1:57:25] mouth. The Bible said, Proverbs 6:2,
[1:57:27] you're snared by the word you speak.
[1:57:30] Yeah,
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to start in that. That
[1:57:33] would take another hour. But I had that.
[1:57:36] That's why I read to you St. John 15:7.
[1:57:38] If you abide in me and my word in you.
[1:57:44] Romans 10:8, the word is nigh thee, even
[1:57:46] in thy mouth. What is the word of faith?
[1:57:54] The son of man will come down in human
[1:57:56] flesh to unite the two together. Has he?
[1:57:59] The church has to be the word. He is the
[1:58:01] word. The two unites together. And to do
[1:58:03] that, it'll take the manifestation of
[1:58:05] the revealing of the son of man.
[1:58:09] Then can then can we see the marriage
[1:58:11] supper is at hand?
[1:58:13] If I never see you again,
[1:58:16] remember the marriage supper is at hand.
[1:58:18] The rapture is the wedding supper. The
[1:58:20] opening of the seals. The wedding is
[1:58:22] performed.
[1:58:25] the opening of the word.
[1:58:29] Amen. All right.
[1:58:32] Is uniting the two together. See, it's
[1:58:34] the son of man, Jesus Christ, will come
[1:58:36] down in human flesh among us and will
[1:58:38] make his word so real that he'll unite
[1:58:40] the church and him as one. The bride and
[1:58:43] then see that he said it'll unite the
[1:58:45] bride and him as one. Then they'll go
[1:58:47] home to the wedding supper. Amen. She's
[1:58:50] already united. See, we go to the
[1:58:51] wedding supper, not to the marriage.
[1:58:57] Let me declare unto you, he's here
[1:59:00] receiving his bride,
[1:59:02] uniting with her.
[1:59:05] They are becoming one
[1:59:08] for the rapture.
[1:59:12] Then so be it unto me according to thy
[1:59:16] word.
[1:59:18] Praise the Lord. Are you happy? You
[1:59:21] might have had some straight talk, but
[1:59:23] straight talk's good for you.
[1:59:29] Don't take it as a man.
[1:59:33] You know, the Bible said in Psalm 29,
[1:59:35] you give him strength, you give him
[1:59:37] prede preeminence, you give it to him.
[1:59:40] He's worthy of the best. What do you do
[1:59:42] for him? Give him the leftover. Oh yes,
[1:59:44] you can run around day and give him
[1:59:46] three minutes at night before you go to
[1:59:48] bed. deserves. He deserves your best. He
[1:59:50] deserves everything you got. Give him
[1:59:52] your best. Give him your best. Give him
[1:59:54] the best of your life. Give him the best
[1:59:56] of your songs. Give him the best of your
[1:59:58] talent. Give him everything you got.
[2:00:00] Give him your feet. Give him your hands.
[2:00:02] Give him your eyes. Give him your mouth.
[2:00:04] Give him your ears. Give him your soul.
[2:00:06] Give him your heart. Give him your
[2:00:08] praise. Give him everything you got.
[2:00:11] Hallelujah. He deserves the best.
[2:00:13] Surrender all you are. This is what it
[2:00:15] takes.
[2:00:17] This is the key. A full surrender.
[2:00:27] I had you stand, but can I read
[2:00:29] something to you
[2:00:32] and show you what it means
[2:00:35] when we say an urgency?
[2:00:39] I want you to stand with me. Bow your
[2:00:40] heads, won't you? I want you to bow your
[2:00:42] heads and focus on what's being said
[2:00:44] here.
[2:00:45] God told me to do this and I almost
[2:00:47] forgot it.
[2:00:51] Oh God, this is the prophet speaking and
[2:00:53] let it be your words. Oh God, let me go.
[2:00:56] Lord,
[2:00:58] let me go. Don't leave me behind. Jesus,
[2:01:02] let me go with you, Father. I don't want
[2:01:05] to stay here on this earth to watch
[2:01:07] these tribulations coming on.
[2:01:10] I don't want to stay here in this
[2:01:12] insanity. I don't want to stand here
[2:01:14] with hideous sight when hideous sightes
[2:01:17] the people losing their mind. We look at
[2:01:19] men trying to act like beasts and look
[2:01:21] like beasts and women trying to look
[2:01:23] like animals with their paints on their
[2:01:25] face. Knowing these things are predicted
[2:01:27] to happen that the thing will they'll go
[2:01:30] insane till locusts will rise up with
[2:01:33] hair like women to haunt the women and
[2:01:35] teeth like lions and things that you
[2:01:37] said the mental condition of the people
[2:01:39] will go completely will be completely
[2:01:42] gone. We see it now. He said, "We see it
[2:01:45] in the making, Lord." But I say right
[2:01:47] now, we see it happening. Lord, help us.
[2:01:50] Restore to us the sane mind of Christ
[2:01:52] Jesus, our Lord. Oh, great leader of
[2:01:55] eternal life. We accept your promise
[2:01:57] tonight. Let this go deep in our hearts.
[2:02:01] I plead for this people. I plead for
[2:02:03] every one of them in the name of Jesus
[2:02:05] Christ. Lord, I pray that Christ, the
[2:02:08] son of God, will come into the hearts of
[2:02:09] every one of us, Lord, and mold us and
[2:02:12] make us into new creatures in Jesus
[2:02:15] Christ. Grant it, Lord. We love you. We
[2:02:18] want your dispos our dispositions to be
[2:02:21] your disposition. Our change, we want it
[2:02:23] to come into us that we can be your
[2:02:25] children. Feel your spirit moving in our
[2:02:28] hearts, Lord, tendering us, bringing us
[2:02:30] to realization of this insane age that
[2:02:33] we're living in. Grantite, Lord, when we
[2:02:36] see young women so caught up in the web
[2:02:38] of the devil, young men, perverted
[2:02:40] minds, dope addicts, children, cigarette
[2:02:43] smoking, drinking, immoral, Satan's
[2:02:45] Eden, God had taken you 6,000 years
[2:02:48] according to the Bible, to build an
[2:02:50] Eden, and you put your son and your wife
[2:02:52] in there, his bride to rule over it.
[2:02:54] Then Satan come around and perverted it.
[2:02:57] He He's got 6,000 years and he's built
[2:02:59] his own intellectual Eden through
[2:03:02] science and education and so-called
[2:03:04] intelligence. And he's built it into a
[2:03:06] mess of death. Oh God, take us back to
[2:03:10] Eden again, Lord, where there's no
[2:03:12] death, where there's no sorrow. Grant
[2:03:14] it, Lord. We stand humbly waiting for
[2:03:17] the second Adam to come for his bride.
[2:03:19] Make us part of him, Father. We pray in
[2:03:22] Jesus' name. And we say again, "Oh God,
[2:03:26] don't leave us.
[2:03:29] Don't let me
[2:03:31] don't." He said, "Oh God, let me go.
[2:03:33] Don't leave me behind."
[2:03:37] What's the key?
[2:03:40] Surrender.
[2:03:44] Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads, the
[2:03:46] close of this service,
[2:03:49] you've taken your liberty. I don't
[2:03:52] believe your word can return void unto
[2:03:54] you. It'll go and accomplish what it's
[2:03:55] sent to do. I say, Lord, accomplish your
[2:03:57] word in me. You said you're going to
[2:04:00] live and move and have your way in a
[2:04:02] bride. You are here in bride form.
[2:04:04] You've put on another garment. It's a
[2:04:07] still you, the same person united with
[2:04:09] your bride. And Lord, we see the bride
[2:04:12] coming of Christ just as you promised
[2:04:15] that seed would come again. And the
[2:04:17] promise is here. And we see the promise
[2:04:19] being manifest. We see who we are. Lord
[2:04:23] Jesus, we thank you and praise you. I
[2:04:25] ask you to minister to every individual
[2:04:27] heart as you have. Continue to minister
[2:04:30] that word. And Lord, if there be a
[2:04:32] Sunday and we come together, let us come
[2:04:34] together expecting to receive. Not
[2:04:37] expecting upon a man, expecting upon you
[2:04:40] to feed us, to open your word to us, to
[2:04:43] reveal it. We pray now. We give you
[2:04:45] praise. Let our mouth give you praise.
[2:04:47] Let us give you thanksgiving in all
[2:04:49] things and give the thanksgiving and the
[2:04:51] sacrifice of praise continually
[2:04:54] rejoicing. We ask this in Jesus Christ's
[2:04:57] name. Amen.
[2:05:01] So let go
[2:05:03] and let God have
[2:05:07] his wonderful
[2:05:10] way.
[2:05:12] Just let go
[2:05:14] and let God have
[2:05:18] his way.
[2:05:23] Your sorrow
[2:05:26] will vanish.
[2:05:29] Your night turn
[2:05:31] today.
[2:05:33] Walk in the light. Then rise up. Arise
[2:05:37] quickly, bride. Arise. Give yourself
[2:05:39] completely to him. Rise up. Thy light
[2:05:43] has come. Amen.
[2:05:46] Ah, I surrender all.
[2:05:51] I
[2:05:53] surrender
[2:05:55] all.
[2:05:57] Let's do that.
[2:06:00] Lord, I
[2:06:02] surrender
[2:06:05] all.
[2:06:09] All
[2:06:11] to thee my blessed
[2:06:16] savior

[2:06:24] witnesses once again let's sing that
[2:06:26] portion I

[2:06:50] my blessed
[2:06:53] savior.

[2:06:58] surrender
[2:07:00] all. God bless you. God be with you. In
[2:07:04] the name of the Lord. You're dismissed.
[2:08:24] Six.
[2:09:30] Good everything.
