[29:39] very very much um blesses my heart amen
[29:43] I want to speak to you this evening uh
[29:46] on just a simple title of my mountain
[29:49] and so as we'll look at this we'll see
[29:53] uh just I want to make several uh
[29:56] connections through the scripture
[29:58] concerning the mountain when you look at
[30:00] the topic itself it's an incredibly
[30:02] large topic to to uh tie in all the
[30:06] aspects of of uh how God works and where
[30:10] he chooses to to meet amen he'll meet us
[30:14] anywhere but you know you can look
[30:17] through the scripture and you would
[30:18] almost be able to say in a sense that
[30:22] God's chosen place of meeting is a
[30:25] mountain amen now we're not a Doctrine
[30:29] but it it It just fits very much turn in
[30:31] your bibles if you would we'll start off
[30:33] with Psalm 30: 1-2 which is what was
[30:38] part of uh the original connection of
[30:42] this thought uh was David here in the
[30:46] 30th
[30:53] chapter and uh starting with verse one I
[30:58] will extol thee Oh Lord for thou Hast
[31:00] Lifted Me Up Can someone say amen and
[31:04] Hast not made my foes to Rejoice over me
[31:08] oh Lord my God I Cried unto thee and
[31:11] thou Hast healed me now my brother and
[31:14] sister this word healed doesn't just
[31:17] cover a physical Affliction that's right
[31:21] amen I'll tell you what my brother and
[31:23] sister as we see with the 10 lepers I
[31:26] want the Lord to make us completely
[31:28] whole amen not just asking for something
[31:31] in the Physical Realm but heal us Lord
[31:34] amen amen oh Lord thou Hast brought up
[31:37] my soul from the grave and thou Hast
[31:40] kept me alive that I should not go down
[31:44] to the pit sing unto the Lord oh ye
[31:47] Saints of his and give thanks at the
[31:50] remembrance of his Holiness for his
[31:53] anger endureth but a moment in his favor
[31:57] is lying
[31:58] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[32:01] cometh in the morning I say Amen thank
[32:05] you Lord and in my
[32:07] Prosperity I said I shall never be
[32:11] moved now here again I don't want to get
[32:13] distracted tonight but Prosperity is a
[32:16] multifaceted word also because we can be
[32:21] poor in the things of this world and be
[32:25] the most prosperous and blessed people
[32:28] on the face of the Earth amen you know
[32:32] wealth good times are no sign of God's
[32:34] favor his keeping power the word is a
[32:38] sign of his favor amen we thank you Lord
[32:42] for that in my Prosperity I said I shall
[32:45] never be moved Lord by thy favor thou
[32:49] Hast made my Mountain to stand strong
[32:53] thou didst hide thy face and I was
[32:55] troubled I cried to thee Oh Lord Lord
[32:58] and unto the Lord I made supplication
[33:00] which is a form of prayer what profit is
[33:04] there in my blood when I go down to the
[33:07] pit shall the dust praise thee shall it
[33:10] declare thy truth meaning this is what
[33:14] we're here for
[33:17] amen are you with me Saints that's right
[33:19] amen we're here amen not that the Rocks
[33:23] would cry out not that the dust would
[33:26] praise him that that's what we're called
[33:29] to do amen
[33:31] [Music]
[33:32] hallelujah here oh Lord and have mercy
[33:35] upon me be thou my helper thou Hast
[33:38] turned uh for me my mourning into
[33:41] dancing thou Hast put off my sackcloth
[33:44] and gted me with gladness to the end
[33:46] that my glory may sing praise to thee
[33:49] and not be silent oh Lord my God I will
[33:52] give thanks unto thee forever amen amen
[33:56] we're going to take the word forever as
[33:59] it is here again various definitions of
[34:01] that for
[34:03] eternity we're going to be giving praise
[34:06] to the King of Kings for eternity does
[34:08] that make you happy it really stir my
[34:11] heart today amen Heavenly Father we just
[34:13] ask you Lord come be with us tonight
[34:15] speak to our hearts those who are unable
[34:18] to be here father thinking Lord of those
[34:21] that are sick not feeling well Lord we
[34:23] would just ask you to come touch them in
[34:25] body Lord for I know their desires was
[34:28] to be in the house of God tonight so we
[34:31] ask you give strength to them in the
[34:33] name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[34:36] seated Saints amen as I read these
[34:39] verses it resonates with me because you
[34:42] see where our strength comes from when
[34:45] we look at that where does our strength
[34:47] come from the word is very clear that
[34:50] our strength comes from the Lord it is
[34:52] not you know uh uh definitely no uh uh
[34:55] point to those who exer size are
[34:58] physically fit uh but the natural
[35:01] strength you just uh let that wne for a
[35:03] little bit and and we just seem to go
[35:06] right back where we were and it is the
[35:08] same in our spiritual walk if we do not
[35:11] continue as brother brandham spoke about
[35:13] flexing those Faith muscles if we do not
[35:16] Flex those Faith muscles they will
[35:19] wither and so it is by God's grace that
[35:22] we uh this is a hard one sometimes uh to
[35:26] to really kind of wrap our thoughts
[35:28] around but that's why God allows these
[35:30] things little things to come in our
[35:32] lives amen that we would be continually
[35:35] flexing our faith muscle in other words
[35:38] if we could say Okay praise God I am in
[35:40] Rapture condition and I don't need to do
[35:42] anything until he comes we would find
[35:45] ourselves very weak but by these trials
[35:47] of the day amen the trials that seem to
[35:50] just appear from nowhere uh that we
[35:53] continually Flex our faith muscle and
[35:56] that gives us strength to stand in the
[35:59] uh the trials of the day amen so every
[36:02] good gift we know comes from the Lord
[36:04] and our strength comes from him amen and
[36:08] uh you know we can be void of a natural
[36:12] understanding now uh let me flesh this
[36:15] thought out we can be void of a natural
[36:19] understanding and oftentimes my brother
[36:22] and sister what I'm thinking or trying
[36:24] to say is that we have decisions to make
[36:28] and we don't know what decision to make
[36:31] we don't know where to go to go right or
[36:33] to go left and so we are void of natural
[36:37] understanding of a circumstance we know
[36:39] that we must deal with we must have an
[36:42] answer for and it is there that God has
[36:46] come when we are often times void of an
[36:49] answer God comes and he has the answer
[36:53] for us you might find it in scripture
[36:56] you might find it in the prophet in the
[36:58] message you might find it just in your
[37:01] prayer time but you see God knows and he
[37:04] has the answer for us even when we don't
[37:08] have an answer so we're LED of the lord
[37:11] we could call that revelation we could
[37:13] call that revelation we can say you know
[37:15] what scripturally here in a spiritual
[37:18] realm you know Revelation comes but
[37:20] Revelation comes over in simple things
[37:23] my brother and sister where God comes to
[37:26] deal with us and you know it is uh when
[37:29] we would come into places to apply
[37:31] Revelation into natural everyday life uh
[37:35] we could be in a position that we make a
[37:38] decision and it's not till later we
[37:40] realize how anointed by the influence of
[37:44] the Holy Spirit to make that decision
[37:47] when we come and find ourselves in the
[37:49] quandry we don't know right or left but
[37:52] when the Holy Spirit comes down and
[37:54] moves upon us to move in a certain
[37:56] direction to give an answer of yes or no
[37:59] or forward or or stop or whatever it
[38:02] might be and we realize then it was
[38:05] actually the Holy Spirit coming right
[38:07] down maybe in the car maybe in the house
[38:10] maybe in the Council of Brothers
[38:12] whatever it is and the Holy Spirit comes
[38:14] and we don't even recognize that he's
[38:17] moving us in a certain direction but he
[38:19] said I will lead you amen we just need
[38:22] to come into every situation and say you
[38:25] know what he said in this situation
[38:27] he maybe didn't name it specifically but
[38:30] he said he would lead us and guide us
[38:32] and Truth my brother and sister is
[38:35] sometimes revealed in just the correct
[38:37] answer the correct decision truth being
[38:40] revealed and so we are under the
[38:42] influence of the Holy Spirit each and
[38:45] every day should be all day of every day
[38:48] amen and that we would be under that
[38:50] leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh we
[38:53] just sometimes need to just let go and
[38:55] say Lord just just influence my
[38:58] decision I just need you to I just need
[39:01] you to to show me you see sometimes God
[39:05] does not answer in direct
[39:08] answers sometimes he takes us to a
[39:11] scripture sometimes he takes us to a
[39:13] time of prayer sometimes he simply gives
[39:16] us that gentle loving nudge to cause us
[39:20] to go in a certain way now in verse
[39:23] seven as it is we'll look at this uh and
[39:26] look how it is spoken Lord by thy
[39:31] favor thou Hast made my Mountain to
[39:34] stand strong you know sometimes as Satan
[39:37] would come in try to Buffet us to change
[39:39] our mind to change a decision but you
[39:42] know our Mountain can stand strong in
[39:44] this day amen thou didst hide thy face
[39:47] see whenever God is absent from us
[39:50] whether we haven't been in the right
[39:52] atmosphere we're not responding
[39:54] correctly uh we as sons and daughters of
[39:57] God we sense that also we know when when
[40:02] that leadership that presence is not
[40:05] with us and it should trouble us if
[40:07] we're walking without the leadership of
[40:09] the Holy Spirit and it doesn't trouble
[40:11] us my brother and sister we need to stop
[40:13] and rethink our position can someone say
[40:16] Amen to that amen and so I want to
[40:21] jump tonight into the book of Hebrews
[40:25] the 11th chapter
[40:27] just finding in my studies quite a few
[40:30] connections back and forth and Hebrews
[40:32] 11
[40:35] and33 is talking about the Believers the
[40:37] Overcomers the Saints who through faith
[40:41] subdued kingdoms rot righteousness
[40:45] obtained
[40:47] promises now my brother and sister every
[40:49] word in this scripture that pertains to
[40:52] the bride of Christ is a promise to you
[40:54] we should look to obtain those promises
[40:58] if it says we're healed we need to pray
[41:01] and approach god with confidence have
[41:03] our position marked that he is my healer
[41:06] if we need direction wisdom knowledge
[41:09] Revelation he you know all of these
[41:11] things we need to claim that you got to
[41:14] step into the scripture take a hold to
[41:16] that promise because you see my brother
[41:18] and sister God never failed from a
[41:20] promise he made us but many times we see
[41:22] those promises not being fulfilled and
[41:25] it is because we have to take a hold of
[41:27] the promise because we're a part of the
[41:29] promise amen so God doesn't say well
[41:32] they've got no faith I guess I'll just
[41:34] discount that and go on and do it no God
[41:37] will bring you and I to a place that our
[41:39] faith is built up but if you want a
[41:42] prayer answered start with the basics
[41:46] amen my brother and sister we don't have
[41:49] to have a complicated now Lord I need to
[41:51] be able to explain all of this and that
[41:53] and you know I remember one time a
[41:55] person asking individual asking for
[41:57] Revelation to understand the tent
[42:00] Vision but their life was in
[42:03] chaos so don't go trying to understand
[42:07] tent Vision to be able to explain it
[42:09] start with the basics Lord let me help
[42:12] put my house in order Lord help me be a
[42:16] person that would read my Bible and pray
[42:19] let me love my brothers and sisters and
[42:21] lift them up start with
[42:23] Basics because you see if we don't have
[42:25] basics in place God's not going to teach
[42:29] us
[42:31] algebra
[42:32] amen so as you look at this so it's here
[42:37] that that it stopped the mouth of lions
[42:39] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[42:42] the edge of the sword and out of
[42:44] weakness were made
[42:46] strong waxed violent uh VI
[42:50] violent waxed violent in fight Valiant
[42:54] in fight and turned to flight the army
[42:57] of the aliens so it was in this position
[43:00] of weakness that God chose to record
[43:03] this in Hebrews 11 telling you this is
[43:05] part of the recipe that made these
[43:08] saints that are listed in this scripture
[43:10] made them who they were is because in
[43:13] their weakness God was able to be made
[43:16] strong amen not one of those in Hebrews
[43:20] 11 come forth as a great Giant in the
[43:23] sense that we think of giants they came
[43:26] forth they were living their life every
[43:28] single day they got up in the morning
[43:30] they went to work you might say Amen
[43:33] they dealt with issues in the family
[43:35] they dealt with finances they dealt with
[43:37] health they dealt with
[43:40] in-laws they dealt with everything just
[43:43] like we did
[43:45] amen but in their weakness because it
[43:49] was submitted to God they found
[43:51] strength
[43:53] amen now as I said this might be a
[43:56] fairly short service today I shouldn't
[43:58] say things like that Amen brother Ivan
[44:01] told me the other day about I don't
[44:03] remember how he worded that but if if
[44:05] you say it or something it doesn't
[44:08] happen so this is going to be a really
[44:09] long
[44:11] service amen but uh I I just want to tie
[44:15] these ends uh concerning a mountain
[44:18] together here now let's look here in
[44:21] Genesis
[44:22] 19 uh it is there that we'll see this
[44:25] story of Sodom we'll see that here is
[44:30] lot and his family uh we have Angels
[44:33] dealing with them and it is there that
[44:37] we'll look at the scripture really
[44:39] careful uh to just catch this uh We've
[44:42] preached it before it might be you know
[44:45] uh old news but amen and while he
[44:48] lingered talking about lot while he
[44:50] lingered the men laid hold upon his hand
[44:53] and upon the hand of his wife and upon
[44:56] the hand of his two daughters the Lord
[44:59] being merciful unto him and they brought
[45:03] him forth and set him without the city
[45:06] now this might here right here might be
[45:08] classified as a miracle here here is a
[45:12] Angels this is a a god coming down and
[45:15] moving where they could not move
[45:18] themselves have you ever been in that
[45:21] position where you knew you needed to go
[45:23] you knew what you needed to do but you
[45:26] couldn't find self doing that it was
[45:28] something that was an unction that was
[45:30] lacking and God comes and moves us and
[45:33] then afterwards we realize exactly what
[45:36] happened God was gracious to us amen and
[45:40] so uh the being merciful unto him they
[45:43] brought him forth set him without the
[45:45] city and it came to pass when they had
[45:48] brought them forth abroad that he said
[45:52] Escape for thy life look not behind thee
[45:56] neither stay thou in all the
[45:59] plain Escape in my own notes I I
[46:03] capitalized this I made this bold escape
[46:06] to the mountain lest thou be consumed so
[46:10] the Refuge here is being given to lot
[46:14] that your Refuge is the
[46:18] mountain now I want to preface this
[46:21] beforehand just studying recently we
[46:24] won't go into all the quotes tonight but
[46:26] the the prophet of God uh putting forth
[46:29] this that the reason that people
[46:31] struggle and don't receive the blessing
[46:34] or answer to prayer that they should is
[46:37] because they are afraid of the presence
[46:41] of the Holy Spirit they find themselves
[46:44] checked they they find themselves
[46:47] pulling back brother brandham speaking
[46:49] quite harshly to brandom Tabernacle that
[46:52] they had pulled back from the moving of
[46:55] the Holy Spirit now that's pretty strong
[46:57] words my brother and sister to speak
[46:59] that out but sometimes strong words are
[47:02] necessary so it tells them here Escape
[47:05] for your life for thy life look not
[47:08] behind thee neither stay thou in all the
[47:11] plain so he makes clear the statement
[47:14] that you stay
[47:16] away neither stay thou in all the plane
[47:22] very clear amen no reason to stumble
[47:25] over those words words just like many
[47:28] words my brother and sister if we're not
[47:30] careful we stumble over when the word
[47:32] itself has showed us clearly how to not
[47:35] stumble at those
[47:37] words amen very very difficult uh quite
[47:40] a few examples I could go in but I'm a
[47:43] little afraid of getting sidetracked
[47:44] tonight and so it's there he tells them
[47:47] now uh neither stay thee in all the
[47:49] plain escape to the mountain very clear
[47:52] words if you're in the plain and not the
[47:55] mountain you're going to be
[47:58] consumed I think it'd be safe to say if
[48:01] we would be a little bit of
[48:03] Liberty if you don't stay in this you're
[48:07] going to be
[48:09] consumed you know God's warning to us
[48:13] take the book eat it amen amen also
[48:17] tells us we must live by every word so
[48:22] if we're living on less than every word
[48:25] we're not on the mountain
[48:27] right we're in the
[48:29] plane and so you can go on and I hope
[48:33] that you follow my thought there you see
[48:36] God's very
[48:37] specific God didn't say come as you are
[48:40] and leave as you
[48:41] are God didn't say you know on your way
[48:45] through to do this or do that you know
[48:47] stop and worship me for a minute very
[48:49] specific
[48:54] amen and lot said to him
[48:57] now see this is where trouble starts
[48:59] right here in verse 18 and lot says unto
[49:02] them oh not so my
[49:06] Lord you see what you preached on
[49:08] marriage and divorce what you preached
[49:09] on the opening of the seals what you
[49:11] preached on baptism what you preached
[49:14] not
[49:16] so there might be more Lots in the land
[49:19] than we give credit for they're talking
[49:23] to God's servants which is God's voice
[49:26] yeah and telling them not so oh Lord
[49:30] don't let us ever come to that position
[49:32] never never Lord no matter how much
[49:35] grief it would bring in our spirit or
[49:38] physically in that element don't say no
[49:41] to God he knows what's best for us and
[49:44] he wants what's best for us oh not so my
[49:47] Lord behold now thy servant hath found
[49:51] Grace in thy sight now I want you you I
[49:54] want to this what I really want to kind
[49:56] of ponder today what what tonight what
[49:59] what it is see is is the Angels amen God
[50:04] draws him out of
[50:06] Sodom draws him out of this wicked
[50:09] place and now lot is telling the Lord
[50:14] how he wants to receive the Holy
[50:16] Ghost how he
[50:19] wants all of these
[50:23] Revelations what I'd really like is for
[50:25] for you Lord to
[50:27] let me be a Christian on my
[50:31] terms in my thoughts my understanding
[50:34] let me let me serve you in the way I
[50:38] think it would be best for me to serve
[50:40] you do any of you trust yourself to make
[50:42] a statement like that I I don't even
[50:45] trust myself to make a statement like
[50:47] that because my thinking is
[50:50] flawed anden that's scary you guys will
[50:52] be voting on a new pastor our Pastor
[50:54] said his thinking is flawed well you're
[50:56] humans also and our thinking is
[50:59] flawed amen and so and we come to the
[51:03] point we start telling God how we want
[51:05] to serve him and what we find to be an
[51:08] acceptable thing and the direction that
[51:11] we want to go so this is how Lord you
[51:13] need to do it for me now they can all
[51:17] follow and be lined up with the word but
[51:19] I need a special
[51:22] exemption I don't ever want to be
[51:25] foolish enough
[51:27] I don't even want to use the word
[51:28] bravery there it just simply falls into
[51:31] foolishness to talk to God like that
[51:34] Lord let me be changed to match this
[51:38] word that's what matters there's there's
[51:41] the whole answer for us to start in the
[51:44] beginning what it would be when God was
[51:46] dealing with lot if what lot would have
[51:48] just said yes
[51:50] Lord less words than he gives to him if
[51:54] he would have just said yes Lord yay and
[51:57] amen to the word and lot would have just
[52:00] allowed the Holy Spirit to lead you know
[52:02] what would have happened the Mountain's
[52:03] hard can someone say Amen to that it's
[52:06] not easy to get to the top of the
[52:08] mountain whether you're just enjoying a
[52:10] hike you're hunting or whatever you
[52:12] might do in the natural and this
[52:14] mountain my brother and sister it would
[52:16] have been hard to got to the top but
[52:19] that wasn't really what bothered lot
[52:21] because lot knew the fire was on the
[52:24] mountain and he did not want to to go
[52:28] face that and he actually speaks L some
[52:31] evil now it comes in the scripture and
[52:34] says when we would say that good is evil
[52:36] and evil is good take this back that lot
[52:39] actually was afraid to go to the
[52:41] mountain L something would befall him
[52:44] now I want to say to you and say to
[52:46] myself if God has called you there God
[52:50] ask you to go to the mountain would God
[52:53] not make your way on the mountain safe
[52:56] and secure and blessed for us to walk in
[52:59] the path that he has called for us amen
[53:02] but if we interject any other thoughts
[53:05] any other ideas any other perceived
[53:09] things go study the message you'll find
[53:12] brother brandom laying it to brandham
[53:14] Tabernacle how that they have pulled
[53:16] back from the presence of
[53:20] God he doesn't spare anything he lays it
[53:24] right to them because you see Satan
[53:28] wants us to be afraid to face the word
[53:31] but we want to face the word we should
[53:34] we long to face the word because there's
[53:36] our Redemption my brother and sister
[53:38] there there is our judgment you know
[53:40] what we we would look and and This Ti
[53:42] into a lot of other things so let me be
[53:44] brief but you look at this my brother
[53:46] and sister and it's really hard when you
[53:48] have a carnal thought to calling
[53:51] judgment upon
[53:54] yourself right
[53:57] would you want to call judgment on
[53:58] yourself people would say no but the
[54:01] truth of it is communion being one
[54:03] example we are calling judgment on
[54:07] ourselves saying Lord I want to judge
[54:10] myself lest I would be judged less I
[54:13] would be found wanting I'd rather face
[54:15] it tonight my brother and sister than in
[54:17] his presence I would rather face it that
[54:20] there's shortcomings in my life today
[54:22] than I would to stand in his presence
[54:25] and and find myself short of that and so
[54:27] you look at this and and he says you
[54:30] know Behold thy servant found Grace in
[54:32] thy sight and thou Hast magnified thy
[54:35] mercy which thou Hast showed unto me by
[54:39] Saving in saving my life and I cannot
[54:42] escape to the
[54:44] mountain I
[54:46] cannot the very place he should have
[54:51] run the very Avenue
[54:58] I find it profound
[55:01] myself because God had given him
[55:04] Grace and given him Mercy that he
[55:07] recognized he felt there was his
[55:11] license to say I have a better plan
[55:14] Lord that's not what God
[55:17] intended God intended for him amen I'm
[55:21] glad of Grace I I need it I need Grace
[55:25] every single day day of my life I need
[55:27] it in abundance I'm glad that his grace
[55:30] is
[55:31] inexhaustible and it's sufficient
[55:34] because otherwise we'd be done and just
[55:37] the
[55:38] heartbeat but it doesn't Grace does not
[55:41] give us
[55:43] license to say no to the
[55:48] word I had a brother asked me one time
[55:50] he said brother Paul can you describe
[55:52] Grace to me and I said brother I'm not
[55:55] sure this is a good answer but this is
[55:56] how I see grace that when I have done
[56:00] all that I can do my very best ability
[56:03] and have still failed Grace is what
[56:06] catches me when I'm
[56:09] falling it's not when I don't do
[56:12] anything Grace is not there for us
[56:15] that're too
[56:16] lazy uh resistant to doing the right
[56:19] thing that's not what Grace is
[56:21] for amen that's when God will take as it
[56:24] were uh spare the r spoil the child amen
[56:28] spare the word spoil the
[56:30] saint amen so the word's got to come for
[56:33] you and I and it will come I say that
[56:36] positively it will come to put us in our
[56:38] correct position but just as it would be
[56:41] the rod it's not going to feel
[56:43] good so it's better to say Lord I need
[56:47] Grace but I'm going to do what you asked
[56:50] me I'm going to walk in the word I'm
[56:52] going to walk in the light you know what
[56:54] that path up the mountain must have been
[56:58] like all of us have
[57:01] hiked it's never a straight
[57:05] road the hike up the mountain in the
[57:08] presence of the Fire on the Mountain
[57:11] leads us
[57:12] here leads us there through some brush
[57:15] through the
[57:16] water up the Steep Parts the parts where
[57:21] we're on our hands and knees
[57:27] but ever moving to the
[57:30] fire ever moving to the presence of the
[57:33] Holy
[57:35] Spirit if it was easy everyone would do
[57:38] it I want to applaud you for your
[57:41] tenacity but mostly say thank you Lord
[57:44] for your grace that you have put in us
[57:47] an attraction to the fire amen so it's
[57:51] there he says you've magnified your
[57:53] mercy you've showed me uh uh unto me
[57:56] saving my life and I cannot escape to
[57:58] the mountain l e some evil uh take me
[58:01] and I I die he had quite a revelation
[58:03] didn't you of what God was doing God's
[58:06] just said you go to the mountain that's
[58:07] where I'll save you and he's saying if I
[58:10] go to the mountain I'll
[58:12] die now let's turn this spiritual if we
[58:15] could for a
[58:16] minute Lord I want to go to the mountain
[58:20] and I want to
[58:22] die I want to die Lord because when when
[58:26] I come in presence of that
[58:28] fire amen it's a purifying fire refining
[58:32] fire I want to be dead when I come in
[58:35] the presence of that
[58:36] fire Hallelujah that's right amen his
[58:40] mercies are new every morning but so is
[58:42] our determination to be humans is
[58:45] refreshed every
[58:46] morning amen personality is refreshed
[58:49] every morning attitude refreshed every
[58:52] morning everything that we would
[58:54] describe in the human element is also
[58:56] refreshed every
[58:59] morning and it has to die to come in the
[59:02] presence of that
[59:04] fire and so he comes he says now Lord
[59:07] verse 20 I've got a I've got an
[59:10] alternative you know the prophet when he
[59:13] preached the message he preached it too
[59:16] hard he hates
[59:19] women sisters do you feel
[59:24] hated there's no no yes answers
[59:28] please no you see the reason they
[59:30] rebelled against that is they chose the
[59:34] alternative not the
[59:36] word and they said you're judging me
[59:40] well if you had judged yourself you
[59:42] wouldn't even feel like you were being
[59:46] judged so without a
[59:49] judgment imagine if I had a whiteboard
[59:51] here we would be drawing this simple
[59:53] thing here's here's Sodom here's the
[59:57] trail and here's the
[1:00:01] why you know when I was a kid my mother
[1:00:04] said I drove her nuts because everything
[1:00:07] we did I said
[1:00:09] why why
[1:00:12] why any of you have children like
[1:00:15] that
[1:00:18] why oh we have grandchildren like that
[1:00:21] yes and they're not here to defend
[1:00:24] themselves but but you see every path
[1:00:27] has a
[1:00:29] why why did he not go to the mountain
[1:00:33] that's what God told him to do why did
[1:00:35] he come with an alternative of let me go
[1:00:39] to a city in the
[1:00:44] valley
[1:00:46] because if I can say this kind but
[1:00:50] straight everything he was used to the
[1:00:53] atmosphere of Sodom was not to be be
[1:00:56] found on the mountain that's right it
[1:00:58] was to be found in the
[1:01:01] city every atmosphere whether we're
[1:01:03] message claim the message or whether
[1:01:05] we're just denominationally minded amen
[1:01:08] we will be drawn to the atmosphere that
[1:01:11] makes us comfortable Lord May the fire
[1:01:14] come Amen Let us be comfortable in the
[1:01:17] presence of the Holy Spirit be
[1:01:18] comfortable in God's word coming down
[1:01:21] and touching right down where we live
[1:01:23] let us be comfortable when he takes a
[1:01:25] hold of us and draws us out of sin and
[1:01:27] draws us out of the state of unbelief
[1:01:30] and draws us into his presence and then
[1:01:32] says look I need you to go to the
[1:01:34] mountain let us be
[1:01:35] comfortable this is what you want for me
[1:01:38] Lord this is what I will
[1:01:43] do he said look now there's a city and I
[1:01:48] hope you don't mind me putting just a
[1:01:50] slight bit of a a a leaning to this
[1:01:53] behold now this city is near
[1:01:56] to flee unto and it's a little
[1:02:02] sin it's just a little place of
[1:02:08] unbelief now I'm not judging no one no
[1:02:10] one misunderstand this I think we're
[1:02:12] probably all been guilty at some point
[1:02:15] it's a really good movie it only has a
[1:02:17] little bit of cursing it's a good movie
[1:02:21] but it only has a little bit of nudity
[1:02:26] it's only a small
[1:02:30] City let me let me be a Christian over
[1:02:33] here
[1:02:34] Lord let me be a Christian in in just
[1:02:38] these small things we can ignore
[1:02:40] them my brother and sister you can't go
[1:02:43] to Costco Walmart or anything
[1:02:45] anymore amen we might be living on the
[1:02:48] outskirts of
[1:02:50] Sodom it it's terrible it's
[1:02:53] terrible amen
[1:02:56] so you
[1:02:57] know he says let me go it's a little one
[1:03:00] let me escape thither is it not a little
[1:03:03] one and my soul shall live he had a
[1:03:06] different view of what living than God
[1:03:09] did he had a different view of what life
[1:03:12] and Liberty was compared to what God had
[1:03:15] God said you're going to find life on
[1:03:17] the mountain lot says look if I can just
[1:03:19] go over to the city this is where I'll
[1:03:22] find life and I hope I hope I'm making
[1:03:24] sense tonight amen so lot was being
[1:03:27] offered a way of Escape but he literally
[1:03:29] said I'm afraid of your plan for my
[1:03:33] life I'm literally afraid Lord that you
[1:03:35] might turn me in into an extreme
[1:03:43] Christian but God said get out of the
[1:03:45] plane go to the mountain wasn't that
[1:03:48] pretty clear in
[1:03:49] scripture yeah get out of the plane but
[1:03:51] I want to not only go to the plane I
[1:03:53] want to go to a city in the plane
[1:03:56] so he called it God's
[1:03:59] grace to be able to go his own
[1:04:03] Direction I I I want to just maybe drive
[1:04:06] this home again thank you Lord for your
[1:04:08] grace it is sufficient amen but Lord
[1:04:11] never let my thinking come to the place
[1:04:14] that I think your grace will let me do
[1:04:17] whatever my flesh wants to
[1:04:23] do calling God's Grace to do his own
[1:04:27] thing now let's look where his plan got
[1:04:30] him and we won't get into all the
[1:04:31] details here but um the city however
[1:04:34] small was the wrong
[1:04:37] place to willingly Embrace those things
[1:04:40] that would breed unbelief into our
[1:04:43] life it's a wrong
[1:04:46] place
[1:04:47] right I don't care how big the church is
[1:04:50] I don't care how prosperous the city is
[1:04:52] I don't care about any of these things
[1:04:55] if it brings unbelief in our life we
[1:04:58] made the wrong decision at the
[1:05:03] why if God be gracious enough we can go
[1:05:05] back to the why and go but look what
[1:05:08] happened he goes down to the city and I
[1:05:11] like I said I don't really want to uh
[1:05:13] dwell on this we know what happened he
[1:05:16] got down in the city realized that he
[1:05:18] was out of God's will makes a decision
[1:05:21] and he finally goes to the
[1:05:23] mountain but he only goes halfway up the
[1:05:28] mountain this might sound a little harsh
[1:05:30] and I don't mean it that way but my
[1:05:33] brother and sister being a halfway
[1:05:34] message believer is going to leave us in
[1:05:36] a cave with all kinds of
[1:05:40] chaos and that chaos will come back to
[1:05:43] haunt us down the
[1:05:47] road you look at that realize for for
[1:05:51] the sake of the service young people Etc
[1:05:53] we won't really go into that uh but um
[1:05:57] so it goes back to the mountain but he's
[1:05:59] only got a halfway experience never made
[1:06:02] it up to the fire he only made it to a
[1:06:04] cave part way up the mountain and in his
[1:06:07] mind called this God's mercy and
[1:06:13] Grace I'm not a real
[1:06:15] believer but I don't drink and smoke and
[1:06:18] dance anymore that's only halfway there
[1:06:22] I don't know if it'd really be half but
[1:06:23] you follow me so so we see what happened
[1:06:27] here with lot uh when he had a
[1:06:31] misconception of the placing of the
[1:06:34] mountain in his life now I think we all
[1:06:37] would relate to this that that we talk
[1:06:40] about things good and bad blessings and
[1:06:42] whatever you know we're in a mountain
[1:06:44] praise the Lord I was on top of the
[1:06:46] mountain praising God and now I don't
[1:06:47] know what happened in a few weeks I'm
[1:06:49] down in a valley and let's just take
[1:06:51] that and bring that thought or that that
[1:06:53] idea back over into this my brother and
[1:06:56] sister spiritually you and I were called
[1:06:59] to live on the mountain but God said
[1:07:01] I've got a mold character in you so I'm
[1:07:02] going to take you down in a valley every
[1:07:04] once in a while and in that Valley
[1:07:07] you're going to come and I don't know
[1:07:08] you know it isn't like you just walk
[1:07:10] down the valley take care of business
[1:07:12] and just somehow end up back on the
[1:07:14] mountain my brother and sister easy to
[1:07:16] get in the valley hard to get on the
[1:07:17] mountain but God said I'm going to mold
[1:07:19] your character part of it is and I'll
[1:07:22] say this just for myself so it won't be
[1:07:24] out of line you know sometimes we let
[1:07:27] ourselves just coast and when you Coast
[1:07:30] you go down and you come to a place and
[1:07:32] you wake up one day and realize I don't
[1:07:34] want to be here this is not where I
[1:07:37] belong it's hot down here it's dirty
[1:07:40] it's dusty I hope you can spiritually
[1:07:42] apply those it's not where I belong I
[1:07:45] want to go back to the mountains is
[1:07:47] there anyone here that doesn't like the
[1:07:49] mountains no there's something inherent
[1:07:52] in us that wants to be on the
[1:07:56] mountain amen I think the scripture even
[1:07:59] talks about living in a valley the
[1:08:00] prophet talks about living in a valley
[1:08:02] and eating eggs I live in a valley and I
[1:08:05] love
[1:08:06] eggs what am I going to do I'm going to
[1:08:09] take the spiritual application the
[1:08:11] prophet was talking
[1:08:12] about but you see my brother and sister
[1:08:14] how we can so easily get in the valley
[1:08:16] but it's work to get on the mountain and
[1:08:19] stay on the
[1:08:20] mountain now imagine where now we know
[1:08:23] God's word's got to be fulfilled but
[1:08:25] imagine where things would be if lot had
[1:08:28] went to the mountain if lot had spoke to
[1:08:32] his wife spoke to his daughters and said
[1:08:34] we need to obey the Angels they're from
[1:08:37] God and they would have said we know
[1:08:38] they're from God but we must
[1:08:41] obey some people think that teaching our
[1:08:44] children or or teaching uh the the
[1:08:47] strength of the word is some form of
[1:08:50] abuse I tell you what abuse is and
[1:08:53] pardon me dear sisters abuse is when we
[1:08:56] let our daughters go out there and be
[1:08:59] ravaged by
[1:09:00] Satan abuse is when we turn our sons
[1:09:03] over and let the world out there amen
[1:09:07] sometimes the the daughters are the
[1:09:09] ravaging amen and some sons are there
[1:09:12] just being ravaged by the devil my
[1:09:14] brother and sister that's abuse amen
[1:09:17] teaching the truth laying the word out
[1:09:20] doing our V to align it and put it in
[1:09:22] the proper concept is not abuse but the
[1:09:25] world has now said it's abuse and back I
[1:09:28] believe the state of Pennsylvania uh
[1:09:30] said forcing your kid to go to to church
[1:09:32] is child
[1:09:36] abuse I'm not sure I got that state
[1:09:38] right but back and and it's like child
[1:09:41] abuse okay I mean the same
[1:09:44] as
[1:09:51] um
[1:09:53] church kids which
[1:09:58] one or
[1:10:02] church see how twisted the world is this
[1:10:06] a concept that we see was manifested all
[1:10:09] the way back with
[1:10:13] lot Moab my brother and
[1:10:16] sister was a basis I hope you follow me
[1:10:20] was a basis or
[1:10:22] Foundation of a form of child child
[1:10:27] abuse even when it turned out the
[1:10:29] daughters were the
[1:10:31] abusers but because the daughters didn't
[1:10:34] know the word of God didn't know the
[1:10:35] presence of God didn't know the
[1:10:38] atmosphere it was all void from
[1:10:41] them I
[1:10:43] believe they were raised in
[1:10:47] church
[1:10:50] religious but the abuse took place when
[1:10:53] they weren't brought in the presence of
[1:10:54] God
[1:10:56] right when the daughters wouldn't have
[1:10:57] looked on the mountain and said Daddy I
[1:10:59] recognize that that's the Holy
[1:11:02] Spirit when they become afraid of it
[1:11:05] when they become afraid of the moving of
[1:11:07] the holy spirit in our
[1:11:10] midst rather would like a
[1:11:13] lullabi a pat on the back a
[1:11:16] star a prize a field
[1:11:19] trip and none of those are
[1:11:22] wrong but it is if they don't recognize
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:26] fire if they can't see the fire parents
[1:11:30] were guilty of
[1:11:32] abuse that could sure be misconstrued
[1:11:34] couldn't it my oh my now I want to hurry
[1:11:39] up and kind of close up
[1:11:41] here Joshua 14
[1:11:46] 6-13 now here we are starting this you
[1:11:49] know the story they've come they're all
[1:11:51] there in place and they come unto Joshua
[1:11:54] gilgal and Caleb the son uh is there and
[1:11:58] um he says you know remember this thing
[1:12:01] that the Lord spoke to me I had a
[1:12:05] promise do we have a promise amen we
[1:12:09] need to remember the promise my brother
[1:12:10] and sister this is part of coming into
[1:12:12] the presence of God reminds us of our
[1:12:15] promise and and and you know I I really
[1:12:19] I really like Caleb I'm looking forward
[1:12:21] to the day I meet him you know because
[1:12:23] he says I was 40 years old when I was
[1:12:25] with Moses and I went and spied out the
[1:12:28] land and I saw that it was flowing with
[1:12:30] milk and honey and I saw it was
[1:12:32] everything that the word had promised
[1:12:34] everything God had promised I saw that
[1:12:37] that was
[1:12:38] true and you know he's a little rough we
[1:12:42] wouldn't like it today many many
[1:12:43] churches wouldn't like it if they had a
[1:12:45] Caleb standing in their midst and and
[1:12:47] basically telling them your hearts
[1:12:49] melted but I was there in the presence
[1:12:52] of God and saw it was the truth and your
[1:12:55] hearts have melted people be don't judge
[1:12:58] me don't judge us don't judge us we're
[1:13:02] Christians we go to church we know Jesus
[1:13:04] Christ is real that makes us
[1:13:07] Christians you want to check it out just
[1:13:09] go around and ask people their
[1:13:10] definition of being a Christian they
[1:13:12] believe Jesus is
[1:13:13] real no relationship no life just
[1:13:20] real so you know he says I wholly
[1:13:24] followed the Lord that's verse eight the
[1:13:26] Lord my God and in that time Moses tells
[1:13:30] him verse 9 uh surely the land which thy
[1:13:33] feet have trotten shall be thine
[1:13:36] inheritance amen and thine children
[1:13:39] forever because thou Hast holy followed
[1:13:42] the Lord my God what a difference my
[1:13:44] brother and sister from
[1:13:46] lot amen here's a promise that the land
[1:13:49] you have walked on and claimed as a a a
[1:13:53] Son of God as a husband
[1:13:55] as a father the land you've walked on
[1:13:58] will be a promise unto your children was
[1:14:02] there anything like that with
[1:14:03] lot He Walked on a lot of land but he
[1:14:07] never walked on it correctly and so now
[1:14:09] here's the promise that is given to him
[1:14:13] and he's standing there coming back
[1:14:15] speaking it to man and to God and to
[1:14:19] saying you promise everything I walked
[1:14:22] on the prophet of God comes and
[1:14:23] reiterates to us lays it out to you
[1:14:26] footsteps our possession oh Lord help us
[1:14:29] to walk on the word Walk In The Word and
[1:14:33] let that be our possession so that the
[1:14:35] promise to our children is released and
[1:14:38] when that's released amen it's no longer
[1:14:41] Mom and Dad causing the children to come
[1:14:43] to church a man causing his wife or a
[1:14:45] wife causing the husband it's no longer
[1:14:47] that that it's taking place in that
[1:14:49] realm it is a burning desire in their
[1:14:52] own life in their own soul I I have a
[1:14:55] promise and I'm going to see that
[1:14:56] promise come to pass I want to see it in
[1:14:59] my mama I want to see it in my daddy I
[1:15:01] want to see it in my brother I want to
[1:15:03] see it in my sister I want to see it in
[1:15:06] myself because this is my
[1:15:08] promise and so this is where we see now
[1:15:12] that Caleb is moving forward I want to
[1:15:14] just move through this here and uh it
[1:15:17] comes to a place my brother and sister
[1:15:19] and he says you know what I'm coming
[1:15:23] and this is the word verse 10 you know
[1:15:26] he says this and behold the Lord hath
[1:15:28] kept me alive see parallels with lot
[1:15:32] lot's talking about the Lord giving
[1:15:34] Mercy to him to keep him alive but look
[1:15:37] what it produced but here's Caleb with a
[1:15:40] real revelation of the word for his hour
[1:15:42] standing there and saying you know what
[1:15:45] he's what's kept me alive thank you Lord
[1:15:48] now I'm not looking for Mercy I'm not
[1:15:50] looking for Grace to go live this
[1:15:52] message the way I want to live it I am
[1:15:54] going to stay and with this word you
[1:15:56] promised us what's he doing he's calling
[1:16:00] God you might say in a sense if I have
[1:16:02] the right words to an account you
[1:16:06] promised I believe the promise I've
[1:16:09] applied the promise and now I want to
[1:16:11] see the manifestation of This Promise
[1:16:17] amen we actually don't know where he's
[1:16:19] standing at this
[1:16:22] point so many feet above sea level
[1:16:25] was it flat was it in a valley was it on
[1:16:29] a plateau we don't know these things but
[1:16:32] you'll find here that it's kind of given
[1:16:35] in the word and especially when you go
[1:16:38] to Israel this becomes very real to you
[1:16:42] because of where it is at what the
[1:16:44] promise is and where it's placed it
[1:16:46] starts to speak to your heart and you
[1:16:48] realize praise God Amen now I want to be
[1:16:52] Saints I want to be verse 11
[1:16:56] I want that to be my testimony I want it
[1:16:58] to be your testimony I want you to be
[1:17:00] able to stand up with a boldness amen we
[1:17:03] you know the problem we have is people
[1:17:05] often times are just bold about the
[1:17:07] wrong
[1:17:08] reasons amen just I I don't watch it I
[1:17:12] don't know much about it I used to
[1:17:13] follow when I was young but you know I
[1:17:15] just know for this is how the world
[1:17:17] Works people are bold enough there's
[1:17:19] snowflakes falling I think this was a
[1:17:21] historical Green Bay Packers picture
[1:17:24] snowflakes are
[1:17:26] falling and there's snow collecting on
[1:17:28] the football field and some guy's got
[1:17:30] his shirt off and he's painted himself
[1:17:33] in a giant Green Bay Packers emblem on
[1:17:36] his body and his body is blue and he's
[1:17:38] shaking CU it's so cold but he's into
[1:17:48] this I'm not poking anybody don't
[1:17:51] misunderstand
[1:17:53] me the prophet of God said their amen
[1:17:56] sound like a sick
[1:18:03] sheep should I dismiss
[1:18:08] now because you're quiet doesn't mean
[1:18:10] you're a sick
[1:18:11] sheep it's a lack of sincerity it's what
[1:18:15] makes it sound like a sick
[1:18:16] Sheep
[1:18:19] amen it could be true might not be I'm
[1:18:23] not sure
[1:18:25] I don't remember ever reading that in
[1:18:27] the
[1:18:29] message I know a brother's this bold he
[1:18:32] did this I'm not this bold a brother
[1:18:35] said well You Preach Today on this I
[1:18:38] don't believe I ever read that in the
[1:18:40] message and the brother looked him in
[1:18:42] the face and says I doubt you ever even
[1:18:44] read the
[1:18:48] message
[1:18:50] ouch I think he was correct though one
[1:18:54] the man never tested
[1:18:58] it verse 11 as yet I am as strong this
[1:19:02] day as I was yesterday amen if you don't
[1:19:06] mind me putting that that way I I'm just
[1:19:09] as strong in the word today as I was
[1:19:12] yesterday I'm not slowly declining from
[1:19:15] spiritual
[1:19:16] starvation I'm in the word I'm eating
[1:19:20] I'm just as strong this day as I was in
[1:19:22] the day that Moses sent me as my
[1:19:24] strength was then even so is my strength
[1:19:27] now for war both to go out and to come
[1:19:31] in amen I want to be that kind of man I
[1:19:34] want to be that kind of believer to be
[1:19:37] able to stand up not with a boasting
[1:19:39] Spirit be able to say you know what in
[1:19:41] all the ups and downs of life I'm
[1:19:43] standing right here in
[1:19:46] 2024 and when God give me the Holy
[1:19:49] Spirit I'm just as strong right now as I
[1:19:52] was then amen and I am ready for war
[1:19:55] Satan I don't like it when I have to
[1:19:57] fight you but I'm prepared I've got the
[1:20:00] word I've put on all the breastplate and
[1:20:02] all of those things and I'm standing
[1:20:05] here prepared to do battle you can't
[1:20:08] have my wife you can't have my husband
[1:20:10] you can't have my children you can't
[1:20:12] have my
[1:20:14] parents
[1:20:15] amen I I I just would share this some of
[1:20:18] you have seen it many of you wouldn't
[1:20:20] have but I got a lovely testimony out of
[1:20:23] Belgium amen some young girls probably
[1:20:27] would shock most of us to see how they
[1:20:29] appeared when they came to to the
[1:20:33] conference but they were very little
[1:20:36] when their parents left the
[1:20:38] message and something in them on their
[1:20:41] own unction now had relatives they had
[1:20:43] relatives that were still around the
[1:20:45] message on their own unction we want to
[1:20:47] go to this conference they come a little
[1:20:50] shocking maybe to look at at first but I
[1:20:53] tell you what they already have put
[1:20:55] their word in I want to be baptized
[1:20:58] these two sisters
[1:21:02] and almost sounds like Rebellion they're
[1:21:04] forcing their parents to take them to
[1:21:08] church come on don't tell me this word
[1:21:10] isn't alive and well in this day don't
[1:21:13] tell me the promise is not there for the
[1:21:15] believer to take a hold self young or
[1:21:18] old to take a hold of and say I'm just
[1:21:21] as strong now as I was then amen I
[1:21:24] believe that'll be these young ladies
[1:21:25] testimony in the future I'm just as
[1:21:28] strong as when God spoke to me at this
[1:21:30] certain time and place and I'm going to
[1:21:31] stand that strong and I want my parents
[1:21:34] to stand that strong sir and I thought I
[1:21:38] was going to be short
[1:21:41] service just as strong as the day that
[1:21:43] Moses as my strength was and even my
[1:21:45] strength is now amen verse 12 I spoke
[1:21:50] all these words all
[1:21:53] these contract
[1:21:55] to bring it down to a place my brother
[1:21:58] and
[1:21:59] sister
[1:22:01] David said the Lord made his Mountain
[1:22:04] strong sturdy
[1:22:07] unmovable man after God's Own
[1:22:09] Heart but we have a contrast in there
[1:22:13] prophet of God said that lot was a
[1:22:16] righteous
[1:22:18] man and you look in the scripture and
[1:22:20] you'll see that Samson appears in
[1:22:24] Hebrews
[1:22:25] 11 I wouldn't choose Samson to be a peer
[1:22:31] for our young
[1:22:33] people but in the end he conquered more
[1:22:38] than he had in all the rest of his life
[1:22:41] God's ways are higher than our ways amen
[1:22:46] amen we would just read the scripture
[1:22:49] and think man Samson was a wreck and I
[1:22:52] guess that was the end of it but no God
[1:22:54] knew God had a plan but now look at this
[1:22:57] we're coming back around and looking at
[1:23:00] a
[1:23:01] Caleb amen where did Caleb travel
[1:23:08] through the Wilderness of
[1:23:14] sin
[1:23:17] 2024 what are you traveling
[1:23:20] through a
[1:23:22] Wilderness of sin
[1:23:26] and Caleb come out of that and all of
[1:23:29] the things that Caleb stood you know
[1:23:31] Caleb went and helped every brother
[1:23:33] every family get
[1:23:35] established didn't even have his own
[1:23:38] promise in his hand as it were but he's
[1:23:41] out establishing establishing
[1:23:43] establishing establishing let me help
[1:23:45] your family help me help you brother let
[1:23:47] me help you sister Widow whatever it
[1:23:48] might be let me help you young
[1:23:51] people and finally comes to a day and
[1:23:54] every everything's coming together and
[1:23:56] he says you know what if
[1:23:59] then I I like this right in here you
[1:24:03] know I'm as strong this day as I was and
[1:24:05] that day Moses sent me and my strength
[1:24:07] was then even so is my strength now for
[1:24:09] war both to go out and to come in now
[1:24:12] therefore give me this
[1:24:16] mountain because here's where the
[1:24:18] promise is give it to me did it change
[1:24:23] anything my brother and sister nope
[1:24:25] wherever the Lord spoke it he knew it
[1:24:27] was true you heard us in that day how
[1:24:30] the anakims were there and that the
[1:24:32] cities were great and fence and so be
[1:24:34] the Lord will be with me then shall I be
[1:24:37] able to drive them out as the Lord said
[1:24:39] so his
[1:24:41] Mountain wasn't a freebie his Mountain
[1:24:44] had some struggles I want to ask you is
[1:24:47] your Mountain got some struggles in it
[1:24:49] amen are you going to overcome are you
[1:24:51] going to claim that mountain it's your
[1:24:53] Mountain it's the promised word of the
[1:24:55] hour our Mountain to stand on the word
[1:24:58] of God to claim the promise but it's not
[1:25:01] only sister Jerry and I was talking
[1:25:03] about this a little bit and I I haven't
[1:25:05] really researched it probably shouldn't
[1:25:07] say anything but my brother and sister
[1:25:09] you know uh the seventh seal is a an
[1:25:13] open Revelation
[1:25:15] right but it's only open if you have
[1:25:18] stepped into it you stand on the outside
[1:25:21] and look at the seventh seals being
[1:25:25] open no wonder people can debate or not
[1:25:29] they've never went in so Joshua said I'm
[1:25:33] just as strong to go out as I was to go
[1:25:37] in I was just as strong to leave the
[1:25:39] world as I was to go into Christ amen
[1:25:43] fight this my brother and sister and see
[1:25:46] everything is fenced and the Lord will
[1:25:48] be with me then I should be able to
[1:25:49] drive everything out and Joshua blessed
[1:25:52] him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jeff
[1:25:56] Hein what's it look like in
[1:25:58] Hein is it a valley well there is a
[1:26:02] valley of Hein but the point that was
[1:26:06] historically recorded is calum's
[1:26:08] position his place is on the
[1:26:13] mountain Saints this is our recorded
[1:26:15] place on the mountain do we have a
[1:26:18] moment just to read one little
[1:26:20] quote uh 1962 10 and 13 of 62 the
[1:26:24] influence of another now brother bram's
[1:26:26] coming up to a prayer here and he says
[1:26:29] now with our heads bowed and our heart
[1:26:31] hearts uh bowed to in his holy reverence
[1:26:35] I wonder if there'd be some in here
[1:26:37] tonight that would have a request that
[1:26:41] they is burning on their heart and I
[1:26:43] think we could tonight Saints maybe
[1:26:45] maybe you could just go follow this do
[1:26:48] you have something a request that's
[1:26:50] burning on your heart they might just
[1:26:52] raise up their hand before God God and
[1:26:54] say in your prayer Lord Jesus I have
[1:26:57] needs I've got my hand up Lord Jesus I
[1:27:01] have
[1:27:02] needs speak to me tonight
[1:27:06] amen heal
[1:27:08] me give me my financial
[1:27:12] needs what was he doing he he's actually
[1:27:16] my brother and sister maybe I'm assuming
[1:27:19] he's actually speaking to a need without
[1:27:22] Discerning it openly like calling them
[1:27:25] out when he says give them healing give
[1:27:28] them financial needs I don't think those
[1:27:30] were random words he threw out I believe
[1:27:33] it discerned the hearts and the needs of
[1:27:35] those Believers at that
[1:27:37] time or whatever it is he supplies all
[1:27:42] our need God bless you about
[1:27:46] 90% of this
[1:27:49] congregation I didn't realize it was on
[1:27:51] the screen sorry
[1:27:55] 90%
[1:27:57] now we either have to believe that those
[1:28:00] people were as genuine as we
[1:28:02] are see there the naysayers are going
[1:28:05] yeah those people are just
[1:28:08] ignorant I believe they were just as
[1:28:11] sincere and just as in tune as we
[1:28:16] are and you got 90% of a church raising
[1:28:20] hands I have something burning on my
[1:28:23] heart
[1:28:24] I have something I have need
[1:28:27] of and I I just it this caught me as I
[1:28:30] was looking at
[1:28:32] this the two things that
[1:28:34] he he speaks out
[1:28:39] healing no doubt physically
[1:28:42] spiritually
[1:28:45] financially speaking to the needs of the
[1:28:48] people musicians had just
[1:28:51] come I say tonight I would just like to
