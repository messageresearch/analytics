Let our attitude be right toward the word, the living word, as it comes forth. But Lord, may it work its work in our lives, each one individually, for we it's an individual affair. We ask this now and believing we receive what we ask for, we say, "Praise be to God." It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh you may take your seats. We'll sing a couple more songs. Um, let's go to number 524. [Music] When I saw the cleansing fountain, open wide for all my sin. I oy the spirit's wooing. When he said, "Wilt thou be clean?" I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb. for sinners slain. Give him glory all ye people [Music] for his blood has washed away each day. Though the way seemed straight and narrow, all I claimed was swept away. My ambitions, plans, and wishes at my feet in ashes lay. I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain. Give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away each stain. Then God's fire upon the altar of my heart was set a flame. I shall never cease to praise him. Glory, glory to his name. Let's sing verse four. Oh, blessed be the name of Jesus. And I'm so glad he took me in. He's forgiven my transgressions. He has cleansed my heart from sin. And I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain. [Music] Give him glory all ye people. for his blood has washed away each day. Amen. Let's see number four uh 444. What a day that will be as uh as brother the B brother Paul comes. There is coming a day when no heartaches shall come, no more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye. All is peace forever more. On that happy golden shore, what a day, glorious day that will be. Oh, what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see. And I look upon his face. The one who saved me by his grace. When he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land. What a day, glorious day that will be. There'll be no sorrow there, no more burdens to bear. No more sickness, no pain, no more parting over there. and forever I will be with the one who died for me. What a day, a glorious day that will be. Oh, what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see. When I look upon his face, the one who saved me by his grace. When he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land day, glorious day that will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that is so glorious that our finite minds cannot even comprehend how beautiful that will be. And the time that we get to stand before God. Amen. Stand there upon the Sea of Crystal with the saints. Sing praises. Never have a tired moment. Never have a moment of pain. Never have a time that your hands seem to be heavy. Maybe you have a little pain in your shoulder and makes it hard, but that'll all disappear. We'll just be able to praise the Lord. Amen. I I just look forward to that. Amen. Uh as we go into the service here, I just want to bring greetings to you from Brother Jonah, Sister Edna, Brother Art, Sister Karen. Um they had a wonderful time. They felt very blessed to to be here. uh quite a long ways to drive uh for them, but uh brother Jonah had fit in uh time in the Tri Cities there uh with brother Jose and and the little group of believers there to visit with them. So uh just a lovely time. They enjoyed it and I think we enjoyed them, did we not? &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh uh so we just appreciate that. We already mentioned about brother Persant and his back pain. He just said it's just really bothering him. And uh he also just uh to just let us know that his parents have uh been allowed to come. They were arriving this afternoon there. Uh so uh his mom and dad and he was just uh desiring God's blessings upon their time of fellowship. And always uh I honestly can't say I don't know north,southeast or west, but let's remember sister April. We know her heart and we know her heart is is to the Lord and the things of God and and uh sometimes her work schedule is crazy and then obviously we know that when she does have that moment she just their family being very close oftent times just to go be with them. Uh we want to remember Gideon and Lily. Amen. While we don't understand everything that's going on, what we see is two souls that need Jesus Christ. Amen. And so let's remember them. Amen. Just uh be faithful to hold them up that the Lord will move upon them. And um we mention uh and I I can't remove the brother from this, my brother and sister. It's just how I feel about it. Um we want to remember them. Brother Gideon. Amen. And uh we desire to see Lily um you know saved, filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. and uh uh sister Sophie's son Manassa. You all remember Manassa well. Uh him and his wife Katie have moved from Chicago back to Boisey. Uh they have come for what they see as their opportunities, but I see as an opportunity for God to move and put them back in fellowship. And uh so we just want to remember that. Amen. Um uh they've been coming on Sundays. My friends uh the Floyd's Lois uh and her daughter Sammy and son Cody. Uh just please remember them. God is just doing a a great work really. Just everything that I speak to them uh this this they're just saying I see it. I believe it. I I you know understand that. And I uh by God's grace I had um my started out just to be lunch and I think uh I talked with I'm going to put it this way is how I feel brother Cody for three and a half hours uh yesterday and um I broached the message with him &gt;&gt; and uh we just put that out in front of him uh and uh just ask them you know if you have questions you know, don't don't push it away, just pray about it. And uh but in the conversation in that three and a half hours, everything we spoke to him, he seemed to to accept and and believe that and recognize that God is doing something very supernatural &gt;&gt; in their lives. And uh so just please remember them. These are these are people, you know, sometimes we feel a personal investment as it were. Uh but like I've shared, you know, I've known Cody since, you know, uh he was just this little guy and known the family, I should say, and and you know, to see God start to deal with them &gt;&gt; and the way that he has dealt with them, you know, not us putting something out there, but God coming down and and speaking to Cody, you need to call Paul. And we have never had a spiritual conversation ever before. And yet God laid upon his heart, call Paul. And um I I just believe this is something the Lord has ordained. And so we do that. Let's just stand and go into the word today. Thank you so much, brother Alex, um and sister Ruth and uh brother Titus. Amen. Just uh beautiful. Amen. Uh, you know, I put about 10 titles to this uh in the last two days until I finally settled on this one. And um I I trust that it would be a relevant title. But it's what struck my heart today as I was working. I just thought, you know what? Uh the truth of it is regardless exactly how this all comes out tonight, we are anointed to stand in this day. Amen. Not an accident that we were born and brought and everything put in place. Not an accident, but by the grace of God. There is anointing come down right from the throne of almighty God. Come right down into our lives. And in that, we cannot do anything different. Now, I believe we all have to recognize there's been times that we just felt so forlororn and we felt so low and we felt so distressed and distraught that it's like, do I can I go even find strength to go another step to go any further? And then some anointing just comes upon us and we say, "I can't quit now. &gt;&gt; I won't quit now." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that anointing, my brother and sister, overrides every anointing of our flesh and of our mental state. It rides over that and says, "I called you. You are more than able." Amen. Let's turn our Bibles to Ephesians the 6th chapter verses 10-14. And uh by God's grace, we can we can give thought to this tonight. Amen. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. And I want to ask you, is he not a wy character? Amen. He is just so clever. He He just can wait and wait. He's got patience. He just waits and waits. And at the right moment, he springs a trap and thinks, "I've got them now." And that anointing we were talking about comes down and we say, "You know what? Uh, yep. Maybe I make some mistakes." So, we get down to a final quote. I think you'll like that this evening. We'll make some mistakes, but there's something in us that we cannot just stop. Amen. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness, wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day. And certainly this day qualifies having done all to stand. Stand therefore. And that really was was the crux of where this thought was is we have been anointed in this hour when we have done all we feel like we can do. God just brings us to a place instead of tucking our tail as the phrase is and running. We just stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we get to see the power of God come in. We get to see the Holy Spirit start moving. We get to see things changing. We see atmospheres change. We see attitudes change. We see all of these things because God's not going to allow us to fall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, our idea of falling sometimes we think, "Oh, I fell." But brother and sister, that was a speed bump in your life. That wasn't that wasn't the story of your life. It was a speed bump. Amen. You rose up, you come down, but you keep going. Amen. Hallelujah. Stand therefore having your loins gird about with truthmen and having on the breastplate of righteousness. Heavenly Father, we ask you to come tonight. Just move in our midst. Father, speak to our hearts, Lord. To those who would hear, Father. Lord, may you just speak to hearts wherever they may be today. Lord, that we could realize that we have been called and your calling is true and it is faithful. Lord, it's not conditional, but Lord, you knew and placed within us the very seed of life. Lord, a lifechanging seed, Father, that we can stand here today know that we belong to you and you to us. Father, we thank you for your grace and mercy. Be with each one tonight, I pray. Amen. You may be seated. Now, as we look at this, I want to just put it this way, not to make some great emphasis of it, but my brother and sister, we often times because of our humanity find ourselves struggling against flesh and blood. And sometimes that flesh and blood is another individual that we seemingly feel anointed to have some kind of unconditional disagreement. But oftent times the real battle that we're fighting is our own flesh and blood. And and so we're not against these governments. We're against all these things, my brother and sister. We certainly see what the prophet of God has said about what is going to come to pass. And and uh you know, not to deviate off into those things, but just by a vote and a stroke of a pen, you know, you you can add just a few trillion to a debt of a nation that's already bankrupt. scripture not only being fulfilled but reinforced. Amen. Prophecy being reinforced of what it is and and seeing how these things all come and uh you know as this comes my brother and sister it causes us that we could withstand in this evil day and having done all to stand stand. And you know what is there to hold us is this steadfast belief that God is in control. Amen. And as we're here today, if we were looking at our own, if we were looking at our position, a and what we saw the future holding, uh we would have no reason to have hope. We would have no reason to to have uh a a a bright future as it was. But I'm telling you right now, if I could put it in the right words, forgive me if I don't quite get this right, but I'm telling you right now, this stage of your life is the dullest &gt;&gt; it'll ever be. Because when we pass from this into life, real complete fulfilled life, we'll never remember this. This will be something so far behind us. So while we look at our ups and downs and we judge our life by the ups and downs and and we uh you know are excited and depressed over the ups and the downs but to realize my brother and sister that we are here uh uh in the very foretaste right the down payment that we have come and it is here that in this down payment life is glorious we see the power of God moving we see the Holy Spirit nudging us constantly along he doesn't just leave us on the side of the road and bypass us and say, you know, well, you know, we just leave them alone. But he's always nudging us and drawing us closer and closer. And so we have our loins girth about with truth. And we have on this breastplate breastplate of righteousness and we hold fast to the simple fact that we know his truth that the Lord is in control. Now, as we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, uh we would see how that Satan is uh pretty amazing really when you think about Satan and and what God allowed him, the authority that God did allow him. Just as he was dealing with Job, he says, "You know what? I I'm going to open the hedge and you can do everything but take his life." And there, my brother and sister, was the very thing that bound Satan. He could not take that life. You can say, "Well, is he talking natural life?" I tend to believe as I read that scripture, he was talking about eternal life. You you you can do whatever you want to this man, but you're not going to take life from him. Amen. So, Satan really was bound. All he was doing, he had just been had his eye teeth pulled right there because no matter what he inflicted upon Job, Job was still a son of God. And I'm telling you, my brother and sister, I believe this with all of my heart, that if God would do that with Job, he's done the exact same thing with you and I. That no matter what Satan might try to afflict us with and circumstance he tries to place upon us, he's already been defanged. Amen. He cannot take our life because our life is hid in Christ. Amen. And when we were hid in Christ, that was not a conditional like you have a bad day. Oh, you're out. Hope you're having a good day. You're in. But it is a unconditional promise of God that is just as sure as the heavens and the earth and the earth being hung in the heavens. My brother and sister, look at time. They're there and they are forecasting time by the second into the future because that's how perfect God's timing is. Amen. No man could ever do that. And you know, Satan uses our own uh in our own life. He uses our own life against us. He uses our own words and deeds against us. Can somebody say amen to that? And what he's trying to do is render you and I ineffective. He's trying to bind us. Cuz if our hearts condemn us not, then we have confidence in God. So if he can rob our confidence then there'll be many things in our life we won't even approach or approach God for those because we don't have confidence in our own position and Satan knows he doesn't got to get us out of the church. He doesn't have to break up everything around us. He's just got to rob the confidence that we would have that we cannot come boldly to the throne of God. But we will come boldly to the throne of God because the Lord is not going to allow Satan to bind you and I. Amen. The word says that whatever is bound on earth will be bound in heaven. What is bound in heaven will be bound on earth, my brother and sister. And the word has already went forth. Let's think about that. when we're I was listening today just some beautiful beautiful quotes and different things and and my brother and sister when the prophet of God is speaking he is not talking about as a past tense he's not talking about as a future tense but he's talking about a right now atmosphere talking about the opening of the seventh seal how glorious he says oh how glorious that is that that seal is open that Christ is with us and the word is active It is by here doing the work on our behalf. It's our advocate and and it's just taking place right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not saying, "Oh, God God was my advocate last week. He'll be my advocate next week. He's my advocate right now." Amen. That just stirs my heart because I don't know about you, I still am taming this flesh. Amen. Every once in a while it it kind of like a a mad lion or something. every once in a while this old flesh just kind of you know and God's still taming that and and here again I don't want to make too much emphasis too early but we close this out today this evening uh by God's grace by sharing a beautiful quote with you so Satan trying to render us ineffective now brother Brandham says in the quote perfect strength by perfect weakness amen this I I love this quote right here not in a critical sense but a realistic sense of who we are. We could each one take the name William Brham out and put our name in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is not a criticism like some people might interpret it to be, but it's literally reflective to you and I because it's reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Brham. He's the one that gets in God's way. He's the one that gets lazy. &gt;&gt; Amen. H. Ah, this is pretty painful. Amen. Amen. I think without changing this quote, we could just add he's the one that procrastinates. You know, I mean, there's just a lot of lot of uh reflection in there. Amen. He's the one that gets lazy. He's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it. And when he does, that shoves God right out of the picture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. Can anybody tonight say, "Yep, I understand what the prophet is saying here." Amen. But when I can get rid of that guy, when I can get to a place that he is out of the way, then God can come over and do things that William Brham knows nothing about. Oh, I tell you what, Lord, help each one of us to get out of the way that the Lord could come down and do things we know nothing about. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, when you just visit sometimes with people and they share their heart and they say, you know, what was said here at this point was almost exactly word for word what we spoke about. My brother and sister, no man can come and say, "Yes, I thank you. I take credit for that. You see, what's happened is is we have got pushed out of the way and God is doing things that we know nothing about. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord, for that. That's when God can use you. &gt;&gt; And I want to be used. Can we say amen to that? I want to be used. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just be a church member, message person, goes to church, have some kind of perfect attendance or something. I want God to use me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want him to use each one of us. And and then God can use you. That's when he can use any of you. He can use anybody when we get out of the way. But as long as we've got ourselves in the way, then we cannot. All right. Amen. Look at that. I love that quote because you see what it's doing is the prophet of God's not setting himself as a prophet so far above the people that when you guys ever attain to this glorious position you'll be overcomers &gt;&gt; but he's bringing right down. Now think about the prophet just to insert this think about the prophet when he said you know here I'm 50 years old and if I'm ever going to do anything for the Lord I better get started. Now, that might cause some to to feel condemned. Uh it might cause some to to say, "Well, if he felt that way, where are we at?" But the truth of it is that was the Holy Spirit nudging brother Brandham for more consecrated life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit's not here to condemn you and I that we're not doing the supernatural, we're not doing this, we're not doing that. But it's the nudge that is nudging us to be more consecrated. Lord, I want to do more for you. &gt;&gt; Even doing more for the Lord could just be your prayer life changing. &gt;&gt; Could be being more faithful to to study the message, to read your Bible, uh all of these little things. It doesn't mean many of us are not called uh not to go out and go to foreign lands and to the dark side of Africa or to the far south of Australia, as it were, and the outback. and this and that. My brother and sister, many of us, the majority of us are just called to be faithful. That's God's calling in our life is to be called faithful to the word that's been revealed to us. &gt;&gt; And the Lord's calling us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To a higher calling. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Hebrews 12 1-3. Uh we look at this, my brother and sister, not to compare ourselves to the saints of days gone by because I believe we can make a very realistic claim that we have something that they never had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nowhere in time in the history has the seventh seal been revealed and open to humanity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Where you come and people say, "Oh, but God was with them." But we're talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ. There's never been a time that that revelation has been opened in such clarity to mankind. And so we're looking at something that's very supernatural and as it is Hebrews 11 that they without us cannot be made perfect. So there had to be a word that came to you and I that would bring you and I to perfection because God's not going to bring the word in this day skip us and go back into perfection for them. But we are the final key as it were the punctuation in the paragraph that says this is the word come into perfection. Amen. And God chose us to be in this day which ought to give us something when we feel ill about our life. we feel down about our life, we ought to give us something to jump and shout about. The fact that God would say, "I see you as a perfect believer. I see you as a saint. I see you as a son or a daughter of God. I see you in this position. And I've placed you in this age, this time to fulfill this into perfection." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That, my brother and sister, is not an accident. We're not here just, oh my, I I believe the message and I hope I make it to the end. I hope this, I hope that. There ought to be a certainty in us that if God called you to this hour, that God has already finished the work and you are the perfect person to be in the bride in this hour, the perfect, none better. &gt;&gt; No one can take your place. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Hebrews 12 says, "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, &gt;&gt; and the sin which thus so easily beset us." Now remember, the prophet of God give clarity that sin was unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the actual attributes are just the the byproduct &gt;&gt; of unbelief. So, see what Satan's trying to do &gt;&gt; when we see this? He's trying to shoot us with the arrow of doubt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. A arrow of fear because fear feeds unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, it's there that it's interesting because how Satan works, he causes people to become disgruntled. And they think they're disgruntled with the message. They think they're disgruntled with God. But the truth of it is they're disgruntled with themselves &gt;&gt; because you see when they quit serving God, they never become happy. &gt;&gt; It's not their sudden uh uh moment of of supreme happiness. It it lingers. It lags. It follows them. &gt;&gt; And I could give you real life examples, but we certainly would never want to put that into the the public forum. But you look at this. see every bit of unbelief which so doth easily beset us. Let us run with patience the race that is set before us. So we are running a race. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's absolutely without a doubt we are running a race &gt;&gt; and it's not a sprint. &gt;&gt; It's closer to an ultramarathon. &gt;&gt; And so as we run the race my brother and sister we actually have to pace ourselves. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, when I say that, I'm not talking about you pull back from the word. But the thing is is instead of trying to force ourselves into something that we're not ready for. In other words, like revelation of the word, people jump in there. I believe that, but they don't. And someone can persuade them from it. &gt;&gt; They weren't ready for it. &gt;&gt; But when you are ready for it, no one will ever persuade you from it. And so that's why God doesn't want us to jump ahead and and try and dive into these things. The prophet of God said, "Look, you you just take those things you don't understand. You put that on a shelf." And in other words, if you don't put it on the shelf, you'll become obsessed with that and it will eat you up until you either create your own answer or you decide there is no answer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But in God's season, it comes down and it fits so perfectly in that time and space and our life is changed forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you look at this in in natural I I'm going to pick on brother Trevor. I think I'm going to ask I'm tired of farming. It's too hard a work. I tell you, my arms are about to fall off my body. And um I I'm I'm thinking that what Brother Trevor does is a lot easier. And I I've watched uh you know, I've watched people get haircuts and I want Brother Trevor to let me come over there and just rent one of those seats and he can share his customers with me. Yeah. He's got that look on his face like, uh-huh. Right. But the truth is, with studious study and plenty of practice, even at this age, I could become a barber. &gt;&gt; There'd be a few nick deers and a few ugly haircuts. Might have to be free, but I could do it. But you see, my brother and sister, when we would come, if I was to go tomorrow, and brother Trevor said, "Fine, brother Paul. I've got an empty chair. Just come. first customer in the door in the morning, you can have him. Pretty soon, Brother Trevor wouldn't have any customers [Music] because I'm not ready for that. I'm not trained for that. I have no experience to that. I have no revelation of what it is. Somebody'd come in and say, "Uh, I want to fade." I've heard Brother Trevor use that word before. I want to fade. And I'd be like, "Fade what? Fade in, fade out, fade up, fade down." You see, my brother and sister, that is such a silly analogy, but it's the truth of the gospel that we cannot press into what we are not ready for. &gt;&gt; Amen. People can get, "Oh, praise God. We are going to just come into this and we're going to bring the rapture on." My brother and sister, they might not be the reason the rapture is not taking place. It might be me. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't want them to rush the rapture. We know they can't, but I don't want them to rush the rapture unless I'm completely ready. And I don't want to rush the rapture unless you're completely ready. Amen. So, what happens is as we we come into this position that we are anointed to stand in our position this day and come into a maturity. Now, you listen to the prophet of God talking about Abraham and Lot. And it was there that Abraham stayed up there on the mountain. Amen. And it wasn't the best feed. It wasn't the best place for cattle. It wasn't the best environment. It was dry and dusty and always windy and whatever. But my brother and sister, the season by Revelation, Abraham said, "This is where I belong." Amen. And see, he could have by the very fact that he was Abraham and God was blessing him. He could have went down into the plains of Mary and went down there and that lush grass put his cattle on there and physically prospered. But spiritually right there on that dry, dusty mountain is where he belonged. Amen. And we need to recognize that at times we are anointed to stand where we are. Don't get impatient with God. Don't get impatient with yourself. Don't be down on yourself. Just recognize my footsteps are ordered of the Lord. That's what the word says. So, I don't need to try and be somewhere else and be farther here or farther there and over here, but I need to stand right in the position God has called me. Now, this is not something saying that we can be lazy and we can be whatever. As I I read that quote, Brother Brandham's saying there, you know, we can be lazy. We're not justifying that laziness, but at the same token, don't beat yourself trying to be something you're not. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Everybody's talking about revelation of a certain scripture, a certain thought, a certain thing. My brother and sister, God will reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just be patient. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let the Lord move on that. I I'll just give you an example. I remember a a brother come many many years ago. The church was very small. Sister Sue would remember brother Herold would come and preach to us. And I can remember I remember this very vividly. The first time brother Herold starts preaching on the third pull. And I remember you know Paul half in and half out of the message you might say. You know still a lot of Paul's flesh that was was controlling Paul. And I just oh and I remember I I don't have the paper but I just remember and brother Herold talking about the third pole and putting this out and I remember writing on a piece of paper third pull with a big check mark like what is he talking about but did you know by God's grace see never give one thought about third pull coming up to that point but then it's presented and I remember after that every time I picked up a message book, every time I listened to the tape, the prophet of God was saying something about the third pull and I became so real to me. Now, I'm telling you, I could not have went 6 months prior to that and dug in and said, "Oh, the third pull." I wouldn't have had any understanding. But God come in the right season, opened it up, and let us see what it was. Because we had to come through what? We had to come &gt;&gt; to be ready. &gt;&gt; That's right. for that. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, forgive me for putting it this way, and if I'm wrong, I'll repent. But I wonder if we would judge oursel and say, "I'm ready for the rapture right now." On one side, we can say, "Yes, we are." But there's still things that God's working on. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we have to acknowledge God's still working on us. And being ready for the rapture is not our decision. &gt;&gt; It's his decision. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, the bride of Christ cannot miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. We won't just be a little bit late or distracted from that. The bride of Christ is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it will take place because it's the transformation of this bride from being bride into wife. Amen. And so it's this transition that's taking place just as is natural. Amen. You go from being uh single to being betrothed. Amen. To coming and ultimately when that one day is finished, you start the day. You're not bride. The day is finished. You are wife. You're the bride. And God is working on us. Let's not try and rush ourselves into this. Let us just say, Lord, you started this work, right? This is his word. You started this work. You will finish this work. Can we have that kind of confidence tonight? Amen. This what you started in me, Lord. Not just started in the bride of Christ in the world, but what you started in me, you will finish and I will finish triumphant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will finish boldly. Amen. looking unto Jesus, the author and finish of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross. Now, my brother and sister, I want you to just stop and think for a moment as Jesus is coming to that point. They've judged him. They've let Barabus go. He's going. Does that look like joy? &gt;&gt; Does not look like joy. And when you see Jesus there under that burden, you're seeing a physical man's burden. But Jesus Christ was rejoicing because he knew when those words left his lips, &gt;&gt; it is finished. &gt;&gt; That there was nothing Satan could do &gt;&gt; to reverse it. &gt;&gt; That's right. No emperor, no ruler, no governor, no nothing could stop that. Those words went out and unlocked every key of every promise and made it so open and so free that we stand here today and we can rejoice. It is finished. &gt;&gt; It is finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I've not today was a good day, but you know, um uh you know, I've had just recently some days that would just qualify as bad days. Amen. You know, I just uh I I did some silly things. Forgot to lock in a a deal on a feeder house of a chopper. And as I was moving, it swung open and I just wasted a few hundred. Ripped hoses off, broke electrical fittings. And you just look at it and say, "Wow, that was not very bright." &gt;&gt; But in eternity aspect, not even a dot, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Everything I work for this week just went out the window right there. &gt;&gt; But you see, that's carnal. That's not who I am. &gt;&gt; That's not what I'm working for. That's not what I'm living for. That's not what my goal is. &gt;&gt; That's just the carnal side of it. And what it does is it humbles us because we amen have to learn lessons as the apostle Paul even himself expresses that he himself when he would do good evil is present with him. Some people some people have that analyzed that that Paul must have been some kind of, you know, saint by day and secret sinner by night. &gt;&gt; How carnal is their reasoning on that? &gt;&gt; Amen. God God's not going to call him a saint by day and a sinner by night. But the Apostle Paul was acknowledging he was human just like you and I. And he had a calling in his life. And God proved that calling. But he was still a man, still flesh and still struggled and still learned. &gt;&gt; And that conversation we were having, Brother David, you might not even remember that, but you made the words as we're visiting with Brother Jonah, you said the words about that. Just right along that very line, we are continually growing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And if we're not, there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; There's where we need to get nervous. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me hurry along here. Who for the joy was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, is sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. And I say, "Thank you, Lord, for what you've done. For consider him that endureth such contradiction of sinners against himself." In other words, he's redeeming people that are absolutely contrary to what he represented. And he redeemed you and I anyway. He didn't stop and say, "I'm going to go find some more righteous people." Already righteous people. The Apostle Paul, when you think about him, uh just to finish that little thought, you think about the Apostle Paul. Amen. He's putting the believers to death and God still said, "You are redeemed." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Maybe that was a little bit of Paul's problem, the midnight hour to remember. Amen. those faces &gt;&gt; of those &gt;&gt; that he was in control of &gt;&gt; and put them to death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Men, women, children, &gt;&gt; that would be a tough memory. &gt;&gt; But our Lord Jesus Christ says, you know what? He endured these contradictions &gt;&gt; of sinners against himself. See, there's witnesses past and present, and there's witnesses right in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to go looking out somewhere else for witnesses. They're right here in our midst. Amen. Of overcoming power, the word of God, the blood is sufficient. Some preacher, I I won't even mention his name. I'll just leave him as some preacher recently made a statement to the world that uh Jesus Christ needs a blood transfusion cuz he's running out of blood. Talk about carnal nonsensical thinking that that the world is getting. This is his reasoning. The world's getting more sinful, so there must not be enough blood to cover the sin. Oh, my brother and sister, they so miss it with that kind of carnal thinking. Because you see, there's the contradiction that they think that it has to do with how much blood is available. My brother and sister, even just the very presence of of the most minute, you might say, a blood cell would be enough to save and heal and do of every bit of humanity. and they would don't even want to acknowledge. They take John 3:16 and say, "If God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, then there shouldn't be any. There's something wrong with the gospel." No, something wrong with the people because the light, amen, came according to the word and the darkness comprehended it not. &gt;&gt; Amen. The darkness didn't want anything to do with the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they think somehow the light is defective. &gt;&gt; Yeah. such nonsense in the day that we live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we stop and examine what it is Satan's using against us. &gt;&gt; Stop and examine that. &gt;&gt; I I think it's worthy for us to take time what it is that Satan's using against us. &gt;&gt; Yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, we're waring against flesh and blood, so we want to blame someone else. My problems are usually my wife. But that's a false statement. My problem is not my wife. My problem is me. As the prophet of God said, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Satan uses that and we put the blame somewhere else because we don't want to have to claim our blame. &gt;&gt; We want it place it somewhere else. But God wants us to stop and examine what Satan's using against us. And then we can by the word and I'm I'm kind of speeding this up a little bit. By the word we recognize what Satan uses against us. We set that aside. That is a sin that so easily besets us. That's the unbelief that easily besets us. We have to consciously in and of ourselves recognize and say, "Lord, give me the strength. Give me the direction. and give me the desire to take this and set it to the side because I was not called to stand amongst those that were judged. Amen. Are going to be judged. We are already judged. We're standing here in this position today. Standing in this, anointed to stand in the day that we judge ourselves. Amen. That's what we're anointed to do. to stand in this day and judge oursself, not pushing it off to another day, but we want to set that aside and focus on running. &gt;&gt; I read a little clip here recently of a a man I I never knew his name and I don't remember it now, but um he he ran I think ultra marathons they call them. And people would ask him, how how can you do that when you run beyond the point that the medical field would say is beyond the point of exhaustion? How can you do that? And he says, even though it's over the horizon, I keep my eyes on the goal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He wasn't looking at, oh, this body's tired. Oh, this is this. Oh, this is that. But he just would look and say, "Over the hill is a goal, and I'm going to reach the goal." And I believe that that kind of thinking, not power of the mind, not not those kind of psychology things, but I think we need to stop and say, you know what? What is keeping me? What is keeping me, Lord? Let me set that aside and let my thoughts be wholly completely, solely upon you. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm here for. I'm not here to to uh acquire great wealth. I'm not here to to do this or to do that. I I'm here to live out the word of God. I'm I'm called to join. Amen. You talk about joining something. I want to join that great host of witnesses. &gt;&gt; I want to be one of those that would be called by the word of God. The Holy Spirit would say, "You are a witness." &gt;&gt; I want to be identified in that. Amen. You see, the scripture says he's the author of our faith. Now, as the author, he starts to write the story, &gt;&gt; but let's not forget he's the finisher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It didn't stop where he's the author. Amen. He is the author and the finisher of our faith. Amen. You see, he's already paid the price. And that was the finishing of it all. He's already paid that price. And and I want to say let's not set that aside because you see if we set that aside, if Satan convinces us to set that aside, we have devalued the crucifixion. We've devalued the Holy Ghost. We've devalued God's plan. I don't want to be the man that stands before God and says, "I place no value &gt;&gt; on what you said about me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I placed no value on the very word that said, "I've come to make you a new creature in Christ Jesus." Oh, I couldn't do that. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You've demeaned and devalued the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you want to get really stark about it, you've called God a liar. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's that's just brutal. But you see the scripture shows us very clearly that this battle can leave us weary and faint in our minds. &gt;&gt; Now my brother and sister the word faint just to put this we understand what the word weary means. Um but faint &gt;&gt; we can have a loss of consciousness like many a person has said you know I could never make the rapture and they go you might say unconscious and they just quit trying because they think that they can't. But it also means to become weak or to lack conviction. So to become faint, we can come to a place where weak and we lack conviction. My brother and sister, I don't want to deviate off into that tonight. But we understand as Revelation declares to us that I wer that you were hot or cold. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. because I'll spew you out of my mouth if you're lukewarm. &gt;&gt; See what Satan's trying to do? We can we can believe this message and become weak and lack conviction. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But God wants us to be in the word present, not in a offendable position. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But that we can take the very straight words of God. Amen. And say, "Well, it was the preacher that offended me." No, it's actually not the preacher if he's a real godly preacher. It's the word that offends people. It's the word that becomes the stumbling block. Amen. So, it's there. But when we stay focused, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't become weak. We don't start to lack conviction. &gt;&gt; As the prophet of God said, you can't offend a real believer. And that's because the real believer is not an unbeliever and he's not a makebeliever. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's a believer. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. To keep our conviction. Now, excuse me. I'm just trying to seed the time. I don't want to. Second Timothy 2 chapter verses 1-3. Um, now therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. Imagine now that we've been given grace, this bundle if you would call it, of grace that we can be strong in that or we can be weak in that. &gt;&gt; In other words, we don't take it serious enough to place its real intrinsic value. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you get a real believer &gt;&gt; and and and we'll look at this and we'll say, "But I I I'm still struggle with this. I still there's this circumstance. You know they call them trigger points. Anybody have a trigger point? Anybody here that's not telling the truth? We all have a trigger point. Something that lights us up. &gt;&gt; But you see, my brother and sister, when we'll come and we're strong in the grace that God's given us. That's right. &gt;&gt; Even if you get triggered, God's got a solution. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. God's got the antidote. That's right. &gt;&gt; For you and I. &gt;&gt; Even if something, &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord will undo those triggers. He'll He'll kill them with time. Amen. And sometimes he kills them because you just get to the point you're sick and tired of being sick and tired and you just quit reacting to it because you're tired of reacting to it. Anybody know what I'm talking about? You know? Amen. and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also. So it lays a very firm foundation here scripturally that the word is passed down. But the passing of the word, the teaching of the word must come with personal revelation. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we could be educated into this &gt;&gt; and that won't work. Be thou therefore, thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Now, my brother and sister, there's two kinds of hardnesses in the world. A hardness, let's just talk about uh being a good soldier. There's a hardness that comes with being trained a and engaging, being involved, becoming part of that conditions you that you are not a weak and weary Christian. You're not going to lose consciousness. You're not going to give up. You're not going to be faint because you've been conditioned into a hardened state that you are a good soldier able to stand and fight in the battle. And then there's a hardness that Satan likes. And that's the one what comes down on the heart that the word of God cannot penetrate the heart because it's hard. It's it's it's h brought to a place that nothing can penetrate it. Amen. See the difference? One is a conditioning that comes from the inside out. The other is a conditioning that comes from the outside in. And when it comes from the outside in, it will be that point. And I've made light of this in the past, and I don't really mean to tonight, but you know, there's those that we can be singing the song, I shall not be moved. And there's two different beliefs in the church as they sing this song because one saying the word of God is real, the gospel is real, the Holy Ghost is real, and I know that I as a son of God am real. And the other one is there. They can't change me. They can't do this. They can't influence me. I can. They won't do it. Amen. The song, same song. Two entirely different reactions. But we look at this. See, God wants you and I to be conditioned. Not a callous as in being callous to the gospel, to be conditioned. When Satan sits there with his fiery darts, it's going to be it won't work. Satan, &gt;&gt; I've been conditioned by the word. Amen. I've been hardened in this battle to see the ws of the enemy and to be able to stand and fight. Not give up and run, but to fight. Satan, I'm gonna take your weapon, which might be my very nature. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Might be my very nature. That arrow might be coming out of your heart. It's your very nature. And by the grace of God, snap. Not to be used against me. This is heart belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ, not you, Satan. &gt;&gt; You're a thief. You're a liar. That's right. &gt;&gt; And you cannot take this heart. Amen. Amen. Because you see, we'll be battle hardened. Amen. When we get to glory, my brother and sister, some of these scars, I'm not even going to ask you if you have any scars in your life. I'm just going to make an emphatic statement. The scars you bear in your life that cause you grief right now will actually become trophies &gt;&gt; before our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That I overcome this. I overcome this grievously hurt. Overcome it by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, we're anointed to stand in this day. Amen. &gt;&gt; The most wicked, the darkest of all ages. We've been anointed by God to stand in this day. Not to fall down, not to die, not to turn and run, but to stand. Amen. And when we've done all to stand, stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what God's telling us. &gt;&gt; Because you see, no battle, no victory. &gt;&gt; No victory, no testimony. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look, Brother Bram says in the junction of time, I've got just a couple more minutes if you don't mind. In the junction of time, Brother Bram, God doesn't promise a flowery bed of ease. Don't falsify a Christian. Amen. I like that. Don't talk about flowery bed. It's going to be all blessing. God wants to make you rich. Don't Don't falsify being a Christian. Don't falsify a Christian. And don't falsify the message by telling them everything's going to be all right. There's nothing going to harm you. There's nothing going to ain't no trials or nothing. That's wrong. As a poet said, must I be carried to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas? No, sir. God doesn't promise ease and prosperity, but he promises grace to endure in every time. It's grace that we look to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say amen to that tonight. Amen. It's sometimes grievious. Sometimes it's painful. Sometimes we just think, "I just quit." Amen. I'm sorry to say this, but I believe in transparency. I've quit as your pastor so many times that nobody believes me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't even believe me. Amen. Because my flesh, if I listen to my flesh, it says, "Ah, I'm not doing this." But there's something an anointing that comes down and my soul says this is what you were called for. Do what you're called for. Come and respond to the word that called you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we look to that grace and that grace is what brings us back up. Gives us a strength to face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say this emphatically every challenge of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a single challenge that grace will not take us through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Philippians 4 1-9. I'll skip through some of this. I started at verse one, but we'll jump down. Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. Amen. That ought to be something that we would put more. Not paralyzed. Not paralyzed by fear, not paralyzed by circumstance, not paralyzed by our own failure, &gt;&gt; our own flesh. Not paralyzed by that. I was called to be an overcomer of this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Paul, no. No buts. I was called. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if my God's not powerful enough to fulfill his word in my life, then we're in trouble. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But he is. &gt;&gt; And he already has. &gt;&gt; And we are the recipients. &gt;&gt; Amen. of the power of God. So by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving. See I think sometimes we do all the rest the prayer and and our idea of supplication but there's no thanksgiving in there. &gt;&gt; We need to be saying thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Imagine the culture we would create as a group of believers as families as individuals if in the worst of times we're like thank you Lord for this trial. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the trouble that's hit the church. Thank you, Lord, for the trouble that's hit my family. Thank you, Lord, for this circumstance. Thank you, Lord, for everything. Thank you, Lord. Because you can talk that way when you have a complete confidence that God said, "It is finished." And he was talking to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think he's talking to brother so and so the minister and this evangelist and this guy over here and those my brother and sister, the devil will beat you and beat you and beat you and beat you. But when you realize it was as though God was standing right in front of you and said, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This work I've begun in you. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; it is finished. Amen. &gt;&gt; The calling I put in your life, it is finished. &gt;&gt; Everything you need to make the rapture, it is finished. &gt;&gt; Totally change our approach. None of this up and down, up &gt;&gt; and down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay. Power of transformation. I want to read this quote to start the service, but we'll use it to finish it. Now, we're not a perfect people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say amen for you. We're not a perfect people. We make our mistakes. We do things that's wrong. But you see, love covers all of that. We're willing when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another. Yeah. That's warriors, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. Oh, no. Surely that's for the weak to come back and say, "I'm sorry. That's for the wimps, the warriors, the bold ones. They never say sorry." &gt;&gt; Not true. &gt;&gt; Not true. That's a lie out of the pits of hell. Amen. The prophet of God hit it right on the head. Yep. That's warriors. That's really men and women. That's gallant. Any man can go out to the battlefield that's got nerve enough to walk out there, but when he gets knocked down, then get up and try it again. See, there used to be a song that a young man and a young woman used to sing in the church. If I fall or if I fail. See, if I fall or if I I forget how it goes, let me rise and try again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In our failure that paralyzes us, let us be like this. &gt;&gt; If I fall or if I sin, &gt;&gt; let me rise and try again. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is my heart. Just forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time. &gt;&gt; Can we relate to this? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this real to us? It's not for us. I guess I can't do it. Look, I just fell down. I just failed. I just I can't No. Lord, &gt;&gt; let me rise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And try again. &gt;&gt; Sister Ruth, if you would come. &gt;&gt; Amen. My brother and sister, we were anointed to stand in this day. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; In our weakness, in our failure, in our victory, &gt;&gt; everything that is in our life, &gt;&gt; God is in control of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we were anointed &gt;&gt; to be finishers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Called to set aside everything that would beset us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And run the race with the finish line clearly. &gt;&gt; That's right. in our vision. Amen. Can we say thank you Lord tonight? Amen. For his word that would just make it so assured in our hearts &gt;&gt; that we were called to run this race right here. I had a brother some time back. I understood the point he was trying to make, but I I I just felt like he was missing a point. And he said, "Oh, how would have loved to been back in another age. I thought about what the brother said for a moment and I said, "Brother, um, why do you say that?" And he said, "Man, this age is so hard." Now, I'm going to make a statement. I probably don't have anything to back this up. Every age &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; was hard. &gt;&gt; Every age seemed insurmountable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every age. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If we were back in Philadelphia trying to sort between Luther and Wesley and all of these things, it's like, who's telling the truth? Go back to the colosums. What it must be like. They did these kind of cruel things. And I don't say it just to put a bad memory in your things, but they would chain men in the end of the arena and then send their wife and children and they literally were forced to watch. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What happened to their wife and children? &gt;&gt; I find that stunning. &gt;&gt; I find it. And we can go back in the history of Nika. They come right down and they went into Nika because they thought we can change them. They realized they couldn't. History shows that th many of those men never made it home because they sent assassins to track them down and kill them lest the truth would be taken back to the people &gt;&gt; of what was happening at Nika. &gt;&gt; Does any of that sound easy? But a prophet come and gave us an insight. You see, they were never told what was happening to them. But by prophetic insight, you and I see the ws of the devil. We see his plan. And he's still slippery enough to pull us in sometimes. But I'm telling you as we closed out that quote, "Though I fall, Lord, let me rise to fight again." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you see, we see what God said about Job and we see about what God said about you and I. But Job never had that advantage. He went into this greatest trial of his life. Had no idea that God said what he said about him. &gt;&gt; That's it. But we stand here today by prophetic word knowing we as the bride of Christ cannot be lost, cannot be deceived, will never be forsaken, but are redeemed and washed in the blood of the lamb. And we are the overcomers. &gt;&gt; And we have that advantage. And we still have our battles. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But we are anointed &gt;&gt; to stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He lives. 5:49, brother Alex. Amen. Let's just stand. We'll ask our brother Alex to come and just help us with the song. Amen. I serve a risen Savior. Okay. Serve a risen Savior. He's in the world today. know that he is living. Whatever men may say, I see his hand of mercy, I hear his voice of cheer. And just the time I need him, he's always near. He lives. He lives.
