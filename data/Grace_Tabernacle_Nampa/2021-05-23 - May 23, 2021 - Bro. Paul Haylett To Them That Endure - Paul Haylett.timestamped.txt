[33:01] graduation a milestone in her life
[33:03] and you know i think the greatest i
[33:06] can't help this sister nema but i just
[33:08] remember a time i got to baptize you
[33:10] and there's there's milestones in our
[33:12] life that we get to measure
[33:15] life with you know and to get out of
[33:17] high school and to be able to move on in
[33:19] life
[33:20] as a milestone that i never experienced
[33:24] has the word dropout attached to it you
[33:27] know
[33:27] but uh you know i've never spoke ill of
[33:29] a drop out since
[33:31] uh but uh anyway what a lovely milestone
[33:34] and god bless you sister nima for this
[33:35] time of your life and
[33:37] may the lord just
[33:40] just bless you in all things as you move
[33:42] forward amen
[33:43] could i just have a personal moment to
[33:45] share a couple little things with you
[33:47] just that are very personal to me you
[33:50] know as
[33:50] as this spring harvest time comes it's
[33:53] always been a very stressful
[33:55] time for me and um you know
[33:58] uh in that little short season here
[34:01] everything is very moisture sensitive
[34:03] it's it's not just
[34:04] f we don't get it today we'll get it
[34:06] tomorrow it's very moisture sensitive
[34:08] and
[34:08] so we have as you know you've seen
[34:11] brother chris has preached and stealing
[34:13] my
[34:13] my thoughts i'm not preaching what i
[34:15] intended to preach this morning because
[34:17] he preached it for you the other day
[34:19] uh but uh anyway as we just move forward
[34:22] you know there's times and it's
[34:24] stressful
[34:24] and i know uh uh you know those of you
[34:28] that
[34:29] are in business for yourself especially
[34:31] and those of you that are just doing
[34:32] there's times it's we
[34:34] use the term crunch time and uh
[34:38] so as we were coming this week things
[34:40] going very very good
[34:41] but not good and uh
[34:45] i've been just praying the last few days
[34:48] brother chris just
[34:49] spoke these words and kind of gave me
[34:51] the encouragement to go forward and
[34:53] share this
[34:54] you see we sometimes say lord i need you
[34:57] to do this
[34:58] lord please do this and god
[35:01] answers your prayer in a way entirely
[35:04] different
[35:05] than what you expect and i've been
[35:08] praying the last few days lord i want to
[35:10] be in the house of god on sunday
[35:13] i need to be there i want to be there so
[35:16] lord just make a way
[35:18] and i was just expecting everything to
[35:20] dry to the right moisture everything to
[35:23] just go
[35:23] and we would just be finished but
[35:26] instead
[35:27] the lord opened the windows of heaven
[35:30] and in a totally unexpected way we're
[35:33] here this morning for sure
[35:35] been guaranteed to be here because
[35:37] everything is sopping wet
[35:40] but god answered our prayer amen we are
[35:43] here this morning amen and i want to
[35:46] share something associated with our
[35:48] harvest and hopefully you'll just catch
[35:50] the significance of this
[35:52] the machines that we run are very
[35:54] sensitive to
[35:55] things like metal they have a magnet
[35:58] built into them
[35:59] even a little piece of wire an inch long
[36:02] will stop the machine
[36:04] and but they won't stop is aluminum
[36:08] and you think well aluminum soft it's
[36:11] not really an issue
[36:13] but as we were harvesting a few days ago
[36:16] the machine tripped the magnet metal
[36:19] detector
[36:21] and i go to find what it is reverse the
[36:23] machine
[36:24] it dumps everything back out on the
[36:25] ground and i'm going through the hay
[36:28] and i pick up a very large thick
[36:31] chunk of aluminum
[36:34] enough to totally blow up the cutter
[36:38] head of the machine which
[36:40] is a significant thing in the sense that
[36:42] it costs thousands
[36:43] of dollars to rebuild
[36:47] but this made my heart happy just to say
[36:50] thank you lord for
[36:51] carnal things of life at the end of this
[36:54] substantial chunk of aluminum
[36:57] is one little dinky rusty
[37:01] steel bolt
[37:06] that's all it took it already had teeth
[37:09] marks chewed on it
[37:10] it was there but god in his infinite
[37:13] mercy
[37:14] allowed whatever that fell off of years
[37:16] ago to have
[37:18] one little dinky piece of steel
[37:22] attached to it i just share that because
[37:25] you know it's our prayer each and every
[37:26] day just as it is
[37:28] brother vasily brother sergey
[37:32] i thought maybe both of you would be out
[37:34] on the road i was really laughed at
[37:36] brother jason but i was right on board
[37:38] i've been praying lord be with them
[37:39] wherever they're at on the road they're
[37:41] here this morning
[37:42] you see god knows our heart he knows
[37:44] every little detail
[37:45] don't give up if satan tries to tell you
[37:48] things don't matter
[37:50] i'm here to tell you that in the case of
[37:52] this for an example
[37:54] one little dinky piece
[37:57] of steel now it sounds corn
[38:01] but it saved brother paul about ten to
[38:02] twelve thousand dollars
[38:04] one little dinky piece every detail
[38:08] of your life matters to the lord
[38:12] never never look at the picture
[38:15] and say i think god has forsaken me
[38:18] i think that i'm here alone i think that
[38:22] just remember he said i'll be with you
[38:25] even in you
[38:26] and to the end of the world my brother
[38:29] and sister what an incredible
[38:31] incredible promise there is i would like
[38:34] to share something with you real quick
[38:36] amen if brother isaac will put that up
[38:39] on the screen
[38:41] you know i was just listening uh to
[38:45] um a sermon uh
[38:48] preached there at evening light
[38:50] tabernacle and i don't know if it's
[38:52] minden louisiana and uh
[38:55] in the pre-service this was on this
[38:58] screen and you know
[39:01] i'm not much on predictions right every
[39:04] new year you know you can see it in the
[39:06] grocery store the little magazine
[39:08] psychic predicts this year this will
[39:11] happen
[39:12] and if they do get it right it usually
[39:15] is just barely right
[39:16] it's never ill so we don't pay much mind
[39:18] to that but
[39:19] this intrigued me and and caught me in
[39:22] such a way i thought isn't this the
[39:24] truth
[39:25] because god deals in the certainty
[39:28] god doesn't deal with uh might be it
[39:30] could possibly be
[39:32] if this comes together and that comes
[39:34] together if mars and venus and some
[39:36] other thing
[39:37] line up then it'll all happen god deals
[39:39] in certainty so sons and daughters of
[39:41] god can deal
[39:42] in certainty and let's just read these
[39:45] together because i
[39:46] just like i said it it caught me the top
[39:48] 10 predictions for the rest of 2021
[39:51] one say amen to those predictions you
[39:55] think will come to pass okay
[39:58] amen god's word will still be true
[40:02] the holy spirit will still move
[40:06] the high priest will still be touched
[40:11] there will still be god-anointed
[40:13] preaching
[40:14] amen god will still inhabit
[40:17] the praises of his people there will
[40:20] still
[40:21] be room at the cross there will still be
[40:25] deliverance i want to make that plural
[40:28] deliverances amen there will still be
[40:31] salvation
[40:33] there will still be healing and the last
[40:35] line i believe
[40:36] capital over there will still be
[40:39] overcomers
[40:41] hallelujah aren't you glad i think every
[40:44] one of these
[40:46] will come to pass hallelujah god bless
[40:49] you my brother manasseh good to see you
[40:52] amen let's just stand i want to speak to
[40:54] you this morning
[40:55] on redemptions manifestation once again
[40:58] you know saints i'm just sorry i told
[41:00] you before we were going to map
[41:02] out we were going to lay out this deal
[41:03] of the unbeliever the make-believer
[41:05] but i'm i'm telling you i just can't
[41:07] bring myself to preach on them
[41:08] when there's so many beautiful things to
[41:10] preach on concerning
[41:12] the believer amen i just uh
[41:15] you know you go in the front of the
[41:16] grocery store and there's all these
[41:18] delectable things you know they always
[41:20] put the bakery or used to anyway put it
[41:22] right close so you come close to it
[41:23] because soon as you would see that you'd
[41:25] say i have to have some of those
[41:27] and you know it's there that it's a
[41:30] good but nobody wants to enter the
[41:32] grocery store from the back door
[41:34] you know why the dumpsters at the back
[41:37] door
[41:39] so we don't want to enter the grocery
[41:40] store from the back door we don't want
[41:41] to look at the garbage first and then go
[41:43] find something good
[41:44] we want to come in the front door look
[41:45] at the good things and some things do
[41:48] end up in the dumpster
[41:49] but that doesn't concern us because
[41:51] we're not shopping the dumpster
[41:53] we're shopping of the good things so
[41:56] here we are today
[41:58] once again i don't know why i feel
[42:00] compelled to share that but i'm just
[42:02] telling you that probably don't count on
[42:04] or wait or hold your breath for me to go
[42:05] preaching
[42:06] on the unbeliever and the make-believer
[42:08] very much because it just doesn't apply
[42:10] to us does it
[42:12] huh saints hello
[42:16] hello
[42:21] oh my
[42:24] i have to preach a sermon on that amen
[42:28] second thessalonians the first chapter
[42:30] verses one through twelve
[42:34] paul and sylvanias and timotheus unto
[42:37] the church of the thessalonians
[42:40] in god our father and the lord jesus
[42:42] christ
[42:43] grace unto you and peace from god our
[42:46] father
[42:47] and the lord jesus christ we are
[42:50] bound now this word bound my brother and
[42:53] sister
[42:53] is not one of obligation
[42:57] as in a requirement but this
[43:00] is something that has gripped them
[43:04] so they've been gripped to thank god
[43:07] always for you brethren
[43:09] as it is meet because that your faith
[43:13] is withering away no see that's not
[43:16] something to be excited for
[43:17] so they are compelled to thank god
[43:21] because your faith groweth exceedingly
[43:24] and the charity of every one of you all
[43:27] toward
[43:28] each other aboundeth boy that's what i
[43:31] desire for grace tabernacle
[43:33] so that we ourselves glory in you
[43:36] in the churches of god for your patience
[43:39] and faith
[43:40] in all your persecutions
[43:43] and tribulations
[43:46] that ye endure
[43:52] interesting
[43:54] they're making a declaration paul is
[43:56] that i glory
[43:58] in you for your patience and for your
[44:00] faith
[44:01] that you have in other words
[44:05] your withstanding or living in or
[44:08] surviving through
[44:10] or standing solidified in
[44:14] persecutions and tribulations that you
[44:18] endure i say that's quite a compliment
[44:23] which is manifest token of the righteous
[44:26] judgment of god that ye may be counted
[44:29] worthy of the kingdom of god
[44:31] for which he also suffer seeing it is a
[44:35] righteous thing with god to recompense
[44:37] tribulation to them
[44:38] that trouble you and to you who are
[44:42] troubled rest with us when the lord
[44:46] jesus
[44:46] shall be revealed from heaven with his
[44:48] mighty angels
[44:50] inflaming fire taking vengeance on them
[44:52] that know not god
[44:54] and that obey not the gospel of our lord
[44:56] jesus christ
[44:58] who shall be punished with everlasting
[45:00] destruction
[45:02] from the presence of the lord and from
[45:05] the glory of his power when he shall
[45:08] come
[45:08] to be glorified
[45:12] catch this saints he doesn't say come to
[45:16] be glorified with his saints
[45:20] and to be glorified in
[45:23] his saints let me just put this
[45:28] that is the manifestation
[45:31] of the seventh seal
[45:34] christ in you right
[45:37] amen hallelujah
[45:42] and to be admired in all them that
[45:45] believe
[45:47] because our testimony among you was
[45:50] believed
[45:51] in that day wherefore also we pray
[45:54] always for you that our
[45:55] god would count you worthy of this
[45:57] calling and fulfill
[45:59] all the good pleasure of his goodness
[46:01] and the work of faith with power
[46:04] that the name of our lord jesus christ
[46:06] may be glorified
[46:08] once again not on you in you
[46:12] and ye in him according to the grace of
[46:16] our god
[46:16] and of the lord jesus christ hallelujah
[46:20] amen let's go before the lord this
[46:23] morning
[46:24] father i just asked you this morning
[46:25] take our simple words and
[46:28] father bring them to life in us
[46:32] lord let this word father lord come and
[46:36] as we stand father in the season that we
[46:39] are here
[46:41] looking at the world around us
[46:44] an insanity father that seems to be
[46:46] overcoming
[46:48] an insanity that's running rampant
[46:50] father
[46:51] but yet while we'll look at this and
[46:53] while it is an affront to our senses
[46:56] we go back to your word father and we
[46:58] see that
[46:59] it has already prophesied that these
[47:02] things would come to pass
[47:04] now father let us stand with a surety
[47:07] and confidence lord that all of your
[47:10] word will come to pass
[47:12] let us come with faith father taking
[47:15] holds of the word of god that applies to
[47:17] sons and daughters of god that
[47:19] in the application of your word in our
[47:21] life father it will strengthen us
[47:24] give us lord understanding revelation
[47:26] father of the days that will come before
[47:28] us
[47:29] and what has happened uh behind us lord
[47:32] that we can go forward with a complete
[47:34] confidence father
[47:35] day by day lord not of fear for
[47:38] certainly we see the spirit of fear is
[47:40] upon the land
[47:42] but father we weren't called to fear
[47:44] lord we were not called to be bound
[47:46] again by the spirit of fear
[47:48] so we stand upon your word today with a
[47:50] confidence lord
[47:52] that these things will come to pass just
[47:54] as you have spoken
[47:56] we believe this and declare this in the
[47:58] name of the lord jesus christ
[48:00] amen you may be seated saints
[48:04] hallelujah
[48:06] so i i say in all jokingly uh joke uh
[48:09] kind of about um the previous services
[48:14] uh it is funny brother chris was
[48:16] marveling the other day that i had quit
[48:18] one verse in front of what was a thought
[48:20] upon his heart
[48:22] i marveled when he preached on that
[48:24] topic because that was going to be
[48:26] my next sunday sermon but you look at
[48:28] that and realize
[48:30] this is nothing more than just the mind
[48:32] of god
[48:33] the anointing of god dealing in the
[48:35] midst of the body
[48:36] so it is not one man stealing a thought
[48:39] from another because all of this
[48:41] is god's thoughts it is not our thoughts
[48:43] it's god's thoughts and
[48:45] so as we look at that i i will touch for
[48:47] just a moment my brother and sister
[48:49] that uh we will see all through the
[48:51] scripture
[48:52] how god has a call to action god has
[48:55] something that
[48:56] he has called each and every one of us
[48:58] to do and
[48:59] so it is there that we stand upon the
[49:01] word of god knowing that the calling and
[49:03] the election is sure
[49:05] and we have confidence in what god is
[49:07] doing in our midst and
[49:09] you know i think as i think uh in these
[49:12] lines i i think of the time you know of
[49:15] of
[49:16] uh sister jerry not not to lift her up
[49:18] but just to do this and
[49:20] when her family and you know every
[49:22] family has a history
[49:23] but as a young woman i believe about 13
[49:26] years old
[49:27] uh she was introduced and things started
[49:30] to stir her heart a brother preached a
[49:32] sermon
[49:33] uh in fact the brother used a poster of
[49:35] a rock and roll star
[49:38] to part of his sermon making his point
[49:40] and in that
[49:41] you know she said lord if this is true
[49:44] uh show me or prove this to me and we
[49:48] see how god is faithful right he
[49:50] you ask in sincerity he will
[49:53] answer amen and so you look at that and
[49:57] know that we can trust that god hears
[49:59] our voices
[50:01] he knows our hearts and we stand upon
[50:03] that
[50:04] and you know verse 4 and verse 5 if
[50:07] we have already looked at this but i
[50:09] just want to come back
[50:10] and just bring that into
[50:13] a a little more emphasis you see
[50:17] the scripture says you know that we
[50:19] should rejoice as i said
[50:21] in the fiery trials that we could
[50:24] come but you see there's something
[50:26] deeper than just
[50:27] uh rejoicing that we're in the fiery
[50:29] trials but
[50:31] that we ourselves glory in you and the
[50:33] churches of god for your patience
[50:35] now my brother and sister today we would
[50:37] all each one of us say you know what
[50:40] oh i know i should pray for patience i
[50:42] need patience and it's hard to even pray
[50:44] for patience
[50:45] because you know that the fiery trials
[50:47] are going to
[50:48] follow that will test your patience but
[50:50] let me just remind you
[50:52] lest you never pray for patience that
[50:55] god's going to perfect you
[50:56] anyhow whether you asked to or not
[51:00] so you might as well stand and say lord
[51:02] thy will be done which would be to say
[51:04] lord give me patience
[51:06] amen you know that is the significant
[51:08] factor
[51:09] in our life and our lord jesus christ in
[51:12] that he come
[51:13] as our brother david preached this last
[51:15] sunday uh uh
[51:16] you come and and you bring yourself in
[51:19] subjection to the word of god
[51:21] and we have such a beautiful example
[51:23] that took place there in the garden
[51:25] when our lord jesus said lord not my
[51:28] will be done but lord
[51:32] thy will be done
[51:36] see that was the ultimate in a
[51:37] subjection and you say well uh
[51:40] i don't know that i can do that i say
[51:42] you can i say that you can clearly come
[51:44] to the place in your life that you would
[51:46] look to the word of god
[51:48] and say lord let me be this word in
[51:50] other words lord let this word
[51:52] let me be obedient to it and i'm
[51:54] speaking today you know on this topic of
[51:57] uh
[51:57] uh either endure or enduring to the end
[52:00] i had several wrote down
[52:02] my brother and sister you see there's
[52:03] something about
[52:05] enduring and and we'll touch on this or
[52:07] go deeper
[52:08] but when we come to the place that we
[52:10] are willing
[52:11] to look at the plan of god and to submit
[52:14] ourselves
[52:15] to the plan of god and say lord i
[52:18] totally put my will
[52:19] in subjection to your will my brother
[52:22] and sister that's what the
[52:24] brother david was preaching on that's
[52:25] what he was laying out
[52:27] is that we're not saying i have to have
[52:29] it this way i have to have it this way
[52:31] but lord however you want it to be
[52:34] lord i am good with that i just want to
[52:36] be in your presence i just want to
[52:38] to be able to uh be able to stand and
[52:42] you know he's uh here speaking now in
[52:44] verses four and five he's glorying in
[52:46] the believer's
[52:47] trials in uh what uh they're called to
[52:50] endure he's
[52:51] uh he's he's uh giving glory to god
[52:55] and lifting up the believer because of
[52:58] what you
[52:58] are enduring and now my brother and
[53:00] sister you will look at this and realize
[53:02] that enduring
[53:04] uh the definition is to continue to
[53:06] exist in the same state or condition
[53:08] so the unbeliever is going to endure
[53:14] the make believer is going to endure
[53:18] you see this is not just something given
[53:20] in a small slice
[53:22] to a peculiar people but the ability to
[53:25] endure
[53:27] the unbeliever and the make-believer
[53:29] will endure in their state
[53:31] in spite of all evidence contrary
[53:34] and they use a term of that cognitive
[53:37] dissonance
[53:38] my brother and sister all evidence
[53:40] against their position is there
[53:42] and they'll say well i still don't
[53:43] believe or i still believe god can do
[53:45] this but
[53:47] but you see it comes down that enduring
[53:50] for a son or daughter of god is is not
[53:53] just
[53:53] existing in the same state or condition
[53:56] but it is
[53:57] also to come to a place that we
[54:00] can undergo this is under the transitive
[54:03] verb
[54:04] portion of this definition to undergo as
[54:07] a hardship
[54:09] especially without giving in to suffer
[54:13] endure except
[54:16] with tolerance you see
[54:20] we are sons and daughters of god as the
[54:22] apostle paul is speaking here he's he's
[54:24] telling them that
[54:25] i i glory in the fact that you're able
[54:27] to endure
[54:28] through these great trials endure
[54:31] through the struggle of life
[54:32] that is going on around you it is not
[54:35] simply that we put our head down
[54:37] in a stubborn nature and press on but
[54:40] god is bringing us my brother and sister
[54:42] to undergo the hardship but able to do
[54:46] it
[54:46] with a style that is different than the
[54:49] rest of the world to
[54:50] undergo this to endure whatever
[54:53] affliction
[54:54] fiery trials that we would encounter but
[54:57] to be able to go
[54:59] through that not just to say well i
[55:01] guess if god's going to do this to me
[55:03] i'll just
[55:03] go on but we understand by revelation
[55:07] this is what god called us to this is
[55:09] who
[55:10] we are we are not just people
[55:14] that by chance come to the house of god
[55:16] was introduced given a bible
[55:18] introduced to a message now we're not
[55:20] just by chance come to a place or a time
[55:23] but my brother and sister called before
[55:25] the foundation of the world
[55:26] to this calling called to this season
[55:29] called to this day
[55:31] and you say oh i don't feel like this i
[55:33] don't care what you feel my brother and
[55:35] sister
[55:35] nowhere in the word of god does it say
[55:37] serve me if you feel like it
[55:41] but the word has said i have a calling
[55:43] it is a sure
[55:44] calling and i have called you and of
[55:47] this
[55:47] calling that i have called you of i have
[55:50] given
[55:51] a surety and when i could swear by none
[55:53] greater
[55:54] i swore by myself to ensure that what i
[55:58] have spoken of you
[55:59] will come to pass
[56:04] it doesn't get any more beautiful than
[56:06] that saints
[56:07] to know that god has done now let me put
[56:10] it in this terms right here
[56:12] i remember many years ago when i first
[56:14] started to farm
[56:15] the banker said you have no history as a
[56:17] farmer on your own sure you're a
[56:18] farmer's son
[56:19] but you have nothing and my father was
[56:22] very kind
[56:23] he allowed me to pledge even things that
[56:25] he owned he had a tractor i
[56:27] i was able to pledge it i pledged my car
[56:30] my pickup everything that i owned to my
[56:33] name to the bank
[56:34] so i could borrow a few thousand dollars
[56:37] to rent a piece of ground
[56:38] now my brother and sister the surety
[56:41] that we
[56:41] gave was a surety that if we failed
[56:44] they would come and with surety take
[56:47] what i had
[56:48] but this surety that our lord jesus
[56:51] christ has signed as it were
[56:53] in his own precious blood was not a
[56:55] guarantee that if you fail
[56:57] the devil can take what i've got my
[56:59] brother and sister this was a surety
[57:01] that god said what i have poured into
[57:04] you
[57:05] cannot fail it's not a
[57:08] well if it does this is a surety
[57:12] it cannot fail i'd like someone to lift
[57:15] a hand and say thank you lord
[57:17] amen this is not a a gamble 50 50 stake
[57:20] of success or failure
[57:22] this is god saying what i have begun in
[57:25] you
[57:26] i will finish oh isn't that so beautiful
[57:30] it stirs my heart down to the very depth
[57:33] because i don't know about you but i
[57:34] made about
[57:35] 50 or 150 or maybe that's too low
[57:38] mistakes the last week
[57:41] i don't glory in my mistakes i glory in
[57:43] the fact that god said he would never
[57:45] leave me nor
[57:46] forsake me there's where the glory comes
[57:51] because we have a surety
[57:54] amen you see in these scriptures and i
[57:58] chose that one there's very many and
[57:59] we'll probably have a part two or three
[58:01] on this
[58:01] but my brother and sister there's many
[58:03] scriptures that deal with this idea and
[58:05] thoughts of enduring and endureth but
[58:08] you know what
[58:08] in this scripture i've read to you
[58:10] there's not a single mention
[58:12] of flowery beds of ease
[58:16] paul is talking of their patience
[58:20] and their endurance of the trials
[58:25] they're going through
[58:28] he doesn't talk about oh wasn't that
[58:30] beautiful as you've got to walk and
[58:32] lounge and just enjoy
[58:35] all the glory of being a son or daughter
[58:37] of god
[58:39] paul's talking about fiery trials
[58:42] he's talking about enduring with
[58:45] patience
[58:46] what is set before you the path we say
[58:49] of life
[58:55] reminds me of a man brother that i know
[58:58] good christian man he said you know i
[59:01] met a friend in college and
[59:02] he was witnessing to me and i gave my
[59:04] heart to the lord
[59:06] and he said i went and got baptized and
[59:09] and my friend kept mentioning to me
[59:12] whatever you do just hang on and he
[59:15] thought
[59:15] what's he talking about and then he said
[59:18] when the trial
[59:19] started hitting him he thought
[59:22] my friend lied to me because he had
[59:25] grasped the idea that being a christian
[59:28] his problems were over
[59:32] and he brings this to his friend and he
[59:34] says you know i feel like you deceived
[59:35] me because i thought when i got saved it
[59:37] was over he goes i know i tried to warn
[59:39] you in kind words
[59:42] in subtle words your battle is just
[59:45] starting
[59:46] the struggle is just starting
[59:51] and he said but the problem that i found
[59:54] in that
[59:56] as i was hooked on the idea that jesus
[59:58] christ died for me i was hooked already
[1:00:01] on the idea
[1:00:02] that i had been set free i was hooked
[1:00:04] already that i would have eternal life
[1:00:06] and as the trials got stronger he said
[1:00:10] all i could remember was
[1:00:12] he promised me not meaning his friend
[1:00:15] but our lord jesus he promised me he
[1:00:18] promised me
[1:00:19] and he was able to hang on until he had
[1:00:21] a full revelation of faith
[1:00:24] you see not a single mention of the
[1:00:25] flowery beds of ease or
[1:00:27] the natural accomplishment you will do
[1:00:29] this and you will do that
[1:00:31] you will overcome this on your own my
[1:00:34] brother and sister but you'll notice
[1:00:35] also in the scriptures there's not a
[1:00:37] mention of compromise
[1:00:40] there's not a mention of a watered-down
[1:00:42] message that would
[1:00:43] redeem but he's talking about the
[1:00:46] strength of the word of god
[1:00:48] because your faith groweth
[1:00:51] exceedingly something's happening that
[1:00:54] is changing the individuals that paul is
[1:00:57] speaking to
[1:00:58] and he's not seeing a stagnant church
[1:01:01] but he's seeing a church
[1:01:02] that faith is growing exceedingly
[1:01:06] and you know sometimes my brother and
[1:01:08] sister we go through battles and maybe
[1:01:10] this is not you but i will use myself
[1:01:12] for an example
[1:01:13] we go through battles we go through
[1:01:14] struggles we go through things of life
[1:01:16] and we don't see much in ourselves and
[1:01:19] we cry out to god oh god help me i just
[1:01:21] feel like i'm just not growing i'm not
[1:01:23] doing
[1:01:24] but you see those around you are looking
[1:01:26] at your life saying wow
[1:01:28] look what god's doing in them look at
[1:01:30] the power of god moving them and
[1:01:32] lifting them up they're growing while we
[1:01:35] ourselves look at ourselves very
[1:01:37] judgmental
[1:01:38] or critical and we don't feel like we're
[1:01:40] growing you know i don't know
[1:01:42] how it is whether the young kids are
[1:01:44] taking care of this but we shared this
[1:01:46] with grace kids and
[1:01:47] and trying to make a point about the
[1:01:49] seed that was placed in them and
[1:01:51] we planted a corn seed in a cotton ball
[1:01:54] and i hope they've been watering them
[1:01:56] have you been taking care of your corn
[1:01:58] seed i hope so kids
[1:02:01] you see i'm reminded every day of this
[1:02:03] example i gave to the children of what
[1:02:06] god is doing what the seed is it must be
[1:02:08] cared for it needs sunlight
[1:02:10] it needs water it needs attention and if
[1:02:13] it is cared for
[1:02:14] i don't know we were just sharing
[1:02:15] brother chris sister christian stopped
[1:02:17] by the house last night
[1:02:18] uh with yours out mine is about this
[1:02:20] tall now
[1:02:22] amen it had a little head start on the
[1:02:24] kids because i wanted to make sure that
[1:02:26] as i took this to them that i wouldn't
[1:02:28] be taking them
[1:02:29] bad seed
[1:02:32] but you see my brother and sister if we
[1:02:34] just put the seed on the cotton ball
[1:02:35] in the water and put it in the window
[1:02:37] and never look at it again
[1:02:38] nothing will come of that it will grow
[1:02:40] to a certain point and then it will run
[1:02:42] out of
[1:02:43] moisture it will run out what is
[1:02:44] moisture represented my brother and
[1:02:46] sister think about it
[1:02:47] amen the washing of the water of the
[1:02:49] word so you don't give it word
[1:02:51] this body will dry out and it will just
[1:02:53] fade away
[1:02:54] it will slowly wither back to nothing as
[1:02:56] though there never was something there
[1:02:58] but the evidence of an empty shell
[1:03:00] that satan can say this is what i do to
[1:03:02] christians
[1:03:04] but if we'll give it attention we'll
[1:03:06] give it a little water
[1:03:08] we'll put it in the right atmosphere it
[1:03:10] grows
[1:03:12] amen and we get caught as it were
[1:03:15] in the in the negative side of things in
[1:03:17] the struggle of life
[1:03:19] because you see my brother and sister
[1:03:20] that's where the satan or satan
[1:03:23] that's where he excels is to always
[1:03:25] paint the negative picture
[1:03:26] but i want to reiterate this to you amen
[1:03:30] not a single mention of compromise
[1:03:33] and not a single mention of decisions
[1:03:35] made from emotion
[1:03:40] come on don't tell me satan don't use
[1:03:42] emotions
[1:03:46] husbands wives children we're all
[1:03:49] subject to emotion
[1:03:50] and that's good because if we don't have
[1:03:52] emotion we're dead
[1:03:53] but we as christians do not make
[1:03:56] decisions
[1:03:57] in our life and we don't speak as it
[1:03:59] were those things
[1:04:00] will influence our life from a position
[1:04:02] of emotion
[1:04:03] we speak those things according to the
[1:04:06] word of god
[1:04:07] we don't speak it because i feel like
[1:04:09] this i feel like
[1:04:11] one's my friend i don't feel like i'm
[1:04:12] loved i don't feel like they care i
[1:04:14] don't i don't i don't i don't
[1:04:16] i'm sorry the word doesn't say you know
[1:04:19] what serve me if you feel like it
[1:04:22] serve me on the days you're happy serve
[1:04:26] the devil on the days you're sad
[1:04:28] no my brother and sister he says serve
[1:04:30] for me
[1:04:32] no sub note of compromise no sub note of
[1:04:35] emotion
[1:04:36] and not a single mention of us making
[1:04:38] decisions from our
[1:04:39] intellect do this
[1:04:43] if you understand this he says only
[1:04:45] belief
[1:04:47] he counters these things with only
[1:04:49] belief
[1:04:50] that means you have to the in that
[1:04:52] context of those words
[1:04:54] you have to exclude something he is
[1:04:57] saying
[1:04:57] of all the options that there are in
[1:05:00] your life
[1:05:01] i want you to only write singling out
[1:05:05] only belief don't take all these other
[1:05:09] options don't like all of these other
[1:05:11] things that are presented
[1:05:12] don't take the excuses and the reasoning
[1:05:15] don't take none of that
[1:05:16] just single out and belief
[1:05:20] because if you start to compromise and
[1:05:22] you start to go from your intellect
[1:05:24] there is all kinds of intellectual
[1:05:27] concepts
[1:05:30] there's all kinds of emotional concepts
[1:05:35] you know i felt like bringing a
[1:05:38] little flower because i think sometimes
[1:05:41] saints this is how
[1:05:43] we get caught up in the cares of life
[1:05:44] any of you ever get caught up in the
[1:05:45] cares of life
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:48] remember we always make the little jokes
[1:05:50] about the little boy or the little girl
[1:05:52] they're sitting out on the backside
[1:05:57] she loves me she loves me not
[1:06:01] she loves me she loves me not
[1:06:05] all the way around the flower gets down
[1:06:07] to the last one
[1:06:09] she loves me a bad flower
[1:06:16] it's not how we serve god they don't get
[1:06:19] up in the morning
[1:06:20] he loves me he loves him or not he loves
[1:06:22] me loves not he loves me not oh it's
[1:06:24] going to be a terrible day
[1:06:26] i'm sorry his word said he loves you
[1:06:29] his word says because of his love that
[1:06:32] is beyond
[1:06:33] our love he redeemed us when he
[1:06:36] when we loved him not he loved us amen
[1:06:39] so we come to this place and we
[1:06:41] recognize
[1:06:42] we have to stand on the word of god it's
[1:06:44] not an emotion
[1:06:45] it's not an intellect and certainly it
[1:06:47] is not
[1:06:48] an opinion because i can assure you
[1:06:51] today
[1:06:52] that there will be influences in your
[1:06:53] life anybody have influence in your life
[1:06:55] come on let's be honest with ourselves
[1:06:57] i'm talking about outside of the church
[1:06:59] outside of husbands wives
[1:07:01] parents etc we have influences in our
[1:07:03] lives
[1:07:04] and my brother and sister sometimes
[1:07:06] those influences in our life
[1:07:08] affect us more than the preaching of the
[1:07:11] word of god
[1:07:12] what we need to do is put all the other
[1:07:15] influence to the side
[1:07:16] and if the preacher is preaching the
[1:07:18] truth then we need to say you know what
[1:07:21] this trumps my friend my mama my daddy
[1:07:24] this person that person this trumps
[1:07:26] their opinion
[1:07:28] because this is the word of god but if
[1:07:30] we're not careful
[1:07:32] opinions weigh so heavily and we might
[1:07:35] hear the preaching
[1:07:36] once a week twice if we attend
[1:07:40] all the service but opinion can come
[1:07:44] multiple times a day
[1:07:46] all week long and he ever noticed
[1:07:50] when the devil comes to speak he doesn't
[1:07:54] come
[1:07:55] when you're on fire got victory
[1:07:58] got your sword pulled out and you
[1:08:02] are ready to fight no sir the devil
[1:08:05] always comes
[1:08:07] when he finds you now i'm just saying
[1:08:10] this
[1:08:11] if any of you were in this position i'm
[1:08:12] not picking on you
[1:08:14] but when you're sitting in your bedroom
[1:08:17] with the shade pulled
[1:08:19] and the lights off nobody loves me
[1:08:26] that's when the devil says hey
[1:08:32] i love you
[1:08:41] what i want you to do now is reciprocate
[1:08:42] this
[1:08:46] what's god ever done for you and you
[1:08:49] know what happens
[1:08:50] we go into a state of amnesia right
[1:08:52] there
[1:08:53] and every good gift that god has given
[1:08:56] us through our life
[1:08:57] suddenly vanishes from our thinking and
[1:09:00] we're like
[1:09:01] yeah i'm not even sure god loves me
[1:09:05] oh my and the devil's like
[1:09:08] here's some clothes here's some music
[1:09:11] here's
[1:09:12] some new friends they'll all love you
[1:09:15] well you know what the world has a
[1:09:17] different definition of love than god
[1:09:18] has and because
[1:09:20] we are sons and daughters of god can
[1:09:22] someone say amen to that
[1:09:24] amen the devil is now trying to
[1:09:26] interpret
[1:09:27] what true love is to you and true love
[1:09:30] my brothers and sisters now i hope this
[1:09:31] doesn't hurt anybody's feelings
[1:09:33] especially you children
[1:09:34] but uh love is not giving you everything
[1:09:37] you want
[1:09:40] the scripture says those he loves he
[1:09:43] gives every gift
[1:09:44] they pray for
[1:09:51] i can't find it in the bible either
[1:09:54] those he loves he chastens
[1:09:59] but wait if god will do this for me
[1:10:03] i'll love him you will for a season
[1:10:07] the season till that brand new shiny car
[1:10:10] that you thought
[1:10:10] had to be a gift from god gets scratched
[1:10:17] the body shop can't get the paint right
[1:10:20] and your rear bumper looks yellow
[1:10:22] compared to a white car
[1:10:24] and suddenly it's like lord you got to
[1:10:26] get me a different car
[1:10:30] if you love me lord i'll get a different
[1:10:31] car now i'm sorry you were upside down
[1:10:34] when you traded into that car and now
[1:10:36] you've got a car with a weird colored
[1:10:38] bumper
[1:10:38] that's uh and no it ain't going to work
[1:10:41] that way
[1:10:42] god loves you when he brings your hide
[1:10:44] to church
[1:10:45] come on you didn't bring your hide to
[1:10:47] church he brought your hide to church
[1:10:49] he knew your footsteps and god chose his
[1:10:52] love oh come on saints just have a
[1:10:53] little sense of humor this morning
[1:10:55] when you come to church and god just
[1:10:56] wails on you
[1:10:58] come on i've got some good children i've
[1:11:01] got three very good children god bless
[1:11:03] me with
[1:11:04] i ask them did we spank you enough
[1:11:08] i don't even remember you ever spanking
[1:11:09] me and i'm like
[1:11:11] i somehow raised a child i never whipped
[1:11:14] i failed
[1:11:17] because the word says those you love
[1:11:19] chasing it
[1:11:21] think about it parents think about it
[1:11:26] if you really love them sooner or later
[1:11:28] you're going to whoop them
[1:11:29] i don't know sister gabriella did your
[1:11:31] parents spank him
[1:11:34] yes okay see brother adam sister sarah
[1:11:36] loved her
[1:11:38] amen i'll tell you see we can bring this
[1:11:40] right down there some of you never got
[1:11:42] whipped
[1:11:44] your parents have warped you and say i
[1:11:47] love you and the reason i never
[1:11:48] corrected you and i gave you everything
[1:11:50] you wanted and i babied you and i
[1:11:51] cardinaled you
[1:11:52] it's because i love you i call to
[1:11:53] question that doesn't fit the word of
[1:11:55] god
[1:11:57] a parent that really loves their child
[1:11:59] will bring that child to a center
[1:12:01] where christ is at and will balance them
[1:12:04] of the goods and the bads and all things
[1:12:07] and they will have discipline in their
[1:12:08] life it will not be if you
[1:12:10] do this that will be the proof you love
[1:12:12] me i'll tell you the word says he
[1:12:14] already loved us before we loved him
[1:12:16] amen and we needed to stand and say
[1:12:18] thank you lord for the correction of the
[1:12:20] word
[1:12:20] thank you lord when the word comes and
[1:12:22] touches in my life instead of pushing
[1:12:24] back and rebelling
[1:12:25] i'm going to lift a hand and say thank
[1:12:27] you lord because you loved me enough to
[1:12:29] correct me
[1:12:32] pretty hard to sell that idea to a 10
[1:12:33] year old
[1:12:37] i'll just interject this my son you know
[1:12:40] sister jerry one time years ago
[1:12:42] sitting with our golden lap he's out
[1:12:45] there
[1:12:47] her name was ginger and joel's got his
[1:12:49] arm around the dog and he's telling
[1:12:50] ginger
[1:12:52] my mom is so mean she doesn't love me
[1:12:56] she's just
[1:12:56] she's just mean the years go by my phone
[1:13:00] rings one day
[1:13:02] my son says son i'm sorry
[1:13:06] my son says dad what do you do with a
[1:13:10] rebellious 12 year old
[1:13:11] won't do his school work won't listen to
[1:13:14] his mother
[1:13:15] won't do anything won't clean his room
[1:13:17] what do you do and i said you should
[1:13:18] know
[1:13:26] and he's like oh
[1:13:30] okay i don't know if he whipped him or
[1:13:32] not
[1:13:36] but you see my brother and sister we
[1:13:38] gotta come to a place that we understand
[1:13:41] what god wants in our life
[1:13:45] you see we have to recognize the keeping
[1:13:47] power
[1:13:49] now if we ever thought that we have ever
[1:13:52] done
[1:13:52] something in and of ourselves we are
[1:13:54] mistaken it's one
[1:13:55] someone ever presents to you saints oh
[1:13:57] you are such strong christians
[1:13:59] you are this you are that you have done
[1:14:01] this the scripture says you have
[1:14:03] overcome the devil
[1:14:04] but the word bring balance in our life
[1:14:06] that we recognize it was christ
[1:14:08] in us that's overcoming the devil we
[1:14:10] wouldn't last five minutes
[1:14:11] in our natural flesh dealing with the
[1:14:14] devil
[1:14:16] i just watched a little video of some
[1:14:18] new child a little boy he's like
[1:14:21] seven or eight years old and he's
[1:14:23] already beating the masters at chess
[1:14:29] that's you and i playing life with the
[1:14:32] devil
[1:14:34] we think i can handle this i'm an adult
[1:14:37] the devil just tie you up checkmate you
[1:14:40] before you even realize what is
[1:14:42] happening
[1:14:49] you have to recognize now as paul is
[1:14:52] speaking to the galatians in
[1:14:54] 220 amen he says here
[1:14:58] i am crucified
[1:15:03] with christ
[1:15:06] do you catch what he's really saying
[1:15:08] catch the depth of this
[1:15:10] he says i've already submitted i've
[1:15:12] already died to myself i've already gave
[1:15:14] up every idea i had
[1:15:15] every emotion every intellectual idea
[1:15:17] everything i've had
[1:15:18] it has been killed laid on the cross
[1:15:21] crucified
[1:15:22] with christ nevertheless i live
[1:15:26] yet not i see starting to recognize this
[1:15:29] position as an overcomer
[1:15:31] in this hour my brother and sister we're
[1:15:33] not overcoming but we're overcoming
[1:15:36] sounds like a paradox doesn't it but we
[1:15:38] recognize i'm an overcomer why
[1:15:40] because christ is in me i'm standing
[1:15:43] here with god as the center of my life
[1:15:45] not my will lord but thy will be done
[1:15:48] and all of a sudden we're alive again
[1:15:51] amen we're not caught up in in the sin
[1:15:54] and
[1:15:55] debauchery of the world we live in amen
[1:15:58] yet not i but christ liveth in me
[1:16:00] and the life which i now live in the
[1:16:02] flesh
[1:16:03] see how he brings it right back down
[1:16:05] he's not putting it all to the spiritual
[1:16:07] come on saints
[1:16:08] we're not talking about this we're a
[1:16:10] saint in church and the devil in
[1:16:11] business
[1:16:13] we're not we're not a devil on friday
[1:16:15] amen on the same
[1:16:16] sunday it comes right down the life
[1:16:19] which i now live in the flesh
[1:16:22] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:16:24] who loved me
[1:16:26] and gave himself for me see their very
[1:16:29] foundation of our overcoming of power
[1:16:31] that is in us today
[1:16:33] now i want to just be real straight with
[1:16:35] you today any overcoming
[1:16:37] overcomers in the building today amen
[1:16:39] every one of us i don't care what
[1:16:40] yesterday was like what this morning was
[1:16:42] like
[1:16:42] you should be lifting a hand and saying
[1:16:44] i identify as an overcomer in jesus
[1:16:47] christ
[1:16:48] amen why because i've got him in me
[1:16:51] and he's already overcome in other words
[1:16:54] we could stop and throw the party
[1:16:56] that we're victorious
[1:16:59] but the time's not right for the party
[1:17:05] the time is not right for us to stop and
[1:17:09] celebrate
[1:17:12] reminds me of a story of some viking
[1:17:15] warriors
[1:17:15] i think they were on the isles there in
[1:17:19] what we would know as great britain
[1:17:22] and there was some people of the
[1:17:25] whatever they called them of that area
[1:17:29] and uh they struck down the
[1:17:32] lead or head viking the the
[1:17:35] i don't know the general they struck him
[1:17:38] down
[1:17:39] and they were all celebrating but what
[1:17:41] they didn't realize
[1:17:42] is they had just made the rest of the
[1:17:44] vikings angry that they had struck down
[1:17:46] their leader
[1:17:48] so they started to throw a party and
[1:17:50] celebrate
[1:17:51] and they were fallen upon by angry
[1:17:54] warriors my brother and sister i want to
[1:17:57] just put this home to you
[1:17:59] every time that satan tries
[1:18:03] to knock you down and put you out
[1:18:07] and you strike a blow to him
[1:18:12] it's not time to celebrate
[1:18:15] he's going to be angry he don't want to
[1:18:18] hear you
[1:18:20] praying for deliverance he doesn't want
[1:18:22] to hear you praying for a brother or
[1:18:24] sister for deliverance
[1:18:26] he doesn't want to hear you testifying
[1:18:28] of the power of god
[1:18:30] he doesn't want to hear you testifying
[1:18:32] of being healed
[1:18:34] he's going to come right back have you
[1:18:36] ever noticed
[1:18:38] have you ever noticed you have a
[1:18:39] wonderful church service
[1:18:41] wonderful time in your home wonderful
[1:18:43] experience
[1:18:44] and you're just glorifying god i always
[1:18:46] call it preachers monday because that
[1:18:48] seems to be how it affects the preachers
[1:18:50] but my brother and sister you can just
[1:18:51] go home thank you lord there was things
[1:18:53] i never even saw
[1:18:54] that were spoken lord i just know it was
[1:18:56] your mind and monday morning you get up
[1:18:58] and the pickup don't start and you make
[1:18:59] it to the farm shop
[1:19:01] and uh you forgot your keys and you go
[1:19:03] back and you this and that
[1:19:04] and it just goes on and on and on the
[1:19:06] day and when somebody calls you up hey
[1:19:08] god bless you brother paul
[1:19:09] how are you doing today
[1:19:16] lord is it lying

[1:19:24] am i a hypocrite
[1:19:28] can someone answer that for me no we're
[1:19:32] not
[1:19:33] because this is just the circumstance
[1:19:35] this is the mirage that satan paints
[1:19:38] and our emotions would be this day
[1:19:41] was a disaster
[1:19:50] do you know what i'm talking about
[1:19:55] yes sir yes sir
[1:20:00] and the life which i now live
[1:20:04] in the flesh come on i hope you're
[1:20:07] catching this
[1:20:09] when i live in the flesh
[1:20:12] not me the man in church oh praise god
[1:20:15] we stomped on the devil and we're all
[1:20:18] in control and we bound every spirit
[1:20:20] praise god worship worship worship
[1:20:23] worship
[1:20:24] now this life you live on monday morning
[1:20:30] now let me change the scripture just a
[1:20:31] little bit to make this point this what
[1:20:32] life
[1:20:33] i now live on monday morning
[1:20:36] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:20:42] the life i live when the wheels fall off
[1:20:44] the wagon i live
[1:20:46] by the faith of the son of god the life
[1:20:50] i live
[1:20:50] when all pardon me i don't use these
[1:20:53] words but when all hell
[1:20:54] breaks loose in my house and the devil
[1:20:57] wants me to get in a boxing match with
[1:20:59] my wife
[1:21:00] he wants me to just think about whipping
[1:21:01] my kids he wants me to pick something up
[1:21:04] and throw it
[1:21:04] he wants me to be angry he wants me to
[1:21:06] stomp he wants me to slam doors
[1:21:08] he wants me to do all of these things
[1:21:10] this life i live in the flesh
[1:21:12] that's not the life he's talking about
[1:21:14] he's talking about
[1:21:16] i can withstand this i can come
[1:21:19] and put christ as the barrier the
[1:21:22] standard
[1:21:22] can be raised and i'm counting on the
[1:21:25] standard being raised
[1:21:27] i'm not saying wow praise god finally
[1:21:29] god raises standard
[1:21:30] he's always raising the standard but you
[1:21:33] gotta get behind it
[1:21:35] you can't say amen to the word and then
[1:21:38] walk away from the word
[1:21:39] expect that word to be the answer to
[1:21:42] your problem
[1:21:48] because you see this is for those who
[1:21:49] endure
[1:21:51] now my brother and sister if you don't
[1:21:54] endure if you quit
[1:21:57] this word doesn't apply to you
[1:22:01] this is the word that god has given to
[1:22:03] sons and daughters of god
[1:22:04] that can stand up and say though all
[1:22:07] hail
[1:22:08] assail me i shall not be moved
[1:22:12] what is that oh i'm anointed not to move
[1:22:14] know what the decision you're going to
[1:22:15] make
[1:22:16] and it's going to be devoid of emotion
[1:22:19] devoid of intellect
[1:22:20] devoid of someone else's opinion it's
[1:22:22] going to be devoid of all of this
[1:22:24] it's going to be something down inside
[1:22:25] of you that you say i'm going to stand
[1:22:28] and i don't care what happens i don't
[1:22:30] care what goes on in the world around me
[1:22:32] i don't care that they're trying to rip
[1:22:35] the nation to shreds all
[1:22:36] afraid of this afraid of that we'll read
[1:22:38] a quote here in just a few minutes
[1:22:40] you tell me whether it's accurate or not
[1:22:42] but you see my brother and sister
[1:22:43] this life or living in the flesh has to
[1:22:46] be by faith as the son of god if we're a
[1:22:48] christian
[1:22:49] it can be that we are here for a good
[1:22:51] word of encouragement we'll go home and
[1:22:53] just then fall back into our melancholy
[1:22:58] come on it's going to be a decision
[1:23:00] whether you're an overcomer or not
[1:23:02] it's not going to just happen you're not
[1:23:04] going to endure
[1:23:05] the temptation and trial of a laodicean
[1:23:08] age
[1:23:08] just because you know that there's a
[1:23:10] messenger in the land
[1:23:11] you're not going to do that just because
[1:23:13] you can say god sent a prophet
[1:23:14] you're not going to do that just because
[1:23:16] your mama and daddy have been christians
[1:23:18] forever
[1:23:18] you're gonna do that because you're
[1:23:20] gonna stand up and say the word
[1:23:22] is what i follow the word is what i look
[1:23:25] to
[1:23:25] i will not compromise on the word i will
[1:23:28] keep my eyes on the target
[1:23:31] hallelujah now let's look at a natural
[1:23:34] example
[1:23:35] looking in the world today there's many
[1:23:38] people very athletic
[1:23:40] you see when it comes to running this
[1:23:42] race
[1:23:45] some very fast in the short term
[1:23:49] hallelujah they give it their all
[1:23:54] but they're spent in a very short time
[1:23:58] i sometimes like to watch a little track
[1:24:00] and field
[1:24:02] i know this might sound weird but i've
[1:24:04] always been intrigued by uc and bolt
[1:24:06] i believe he's jamaican guys about from
[1:24:08] the floor down there about this tall
[1:24:11] got legs as tall as i am defies
[1:24:14] every logical terminology
[1:24:17] and association there is to a sprinter
[1:24:21] and he comes out of the blocks
[1:24:25] and every one of these other guys is
[1:24:27] already in front of him
[1:24:30] but the man knows how to give it his all
[1:24:34] and he gives it his all and he has a
[1:24:36] stride
[1:24:37] 40 percent longer than most sprinters
[1:24:44] but can he do that all the way around
[1:24:46] the track
[1:24:48] no sir
[1:24:51] he's a sprinter now i'm sure he could
[1:24:54] far exceed any of us all the way around
[1:24:56] the track
[1:24:58] but you see his passion is to go fast
[1:25:02] to go furious to give his all because he
[1:25:04] knows
[1:25:05] in 10 seconds it's over we've all met
[1:25:12] them haven't we
[1:25:13] yeah right they were in the house of god
[1:25:17] they were on the front row they were on
[1:25:19] the platform standing next to the
[1:25:20] preacher
[1:25:21] preach it brother but they're not here
[1:25:24] today
[1:25:27] and there's been those that can run the
[1:25:30] 800 meter
[1:25:33] or in that region
[1:25:39] and those that can run the mile
[1:25:43] but the real test of human endurance in
[1:25:46] the natural
[1:25:47] is the ultra marathon or
[1:25:51] the iron man where you have to
[1:25:56] run swim
[1:25:59] and ride now follow me as i share this
[1:26:03] with you
[1:26:05] you have to live it in church
[1:26:09] you have to live it at home
[1:26:12] you have to live it out in the world
[1:26:17] the ultra marathon of the believer
[1:26:26] come on are you with me this morning
[1:26:29] you can get in the house oh god you can
[1:26:31] jump up and down you can clap and sing
[1:26:33] and shout and you can do this
[1:26:35] but getting a knockdown drag out
[1:26:38] on the way home from church
[1:26:41] you know what that produces confuse
[1:26:48] children
[1:26:51] did i hear somebody just tear a band-aid
[1:26:53] open
[1:26:57] come on brothers and sisters it's not
[1:26:58] what we're called to do
[1:27:00] we're called to live it here we're
[1:27:02] called to live it at home
[1:27:05] god help us we're called to live it
[1:27:08] young people at school
[1:27:11] amongst your friends in the neighborhood
[1:27:14] maybe family that's not believers
[1:27:16] whatever it might be we're called to
[1:27:17] live it there
[1:27:18] you see not a sprint not a mid-range but
[1:27:20] to run the full gamut
[1:27:22] to be able to live it wherever see
[1:27:25] that's why the ultramarathon or
[1:27:28] the iron man
[1:27:33] has to express more than just
[1:27:37] short-term or mid-term
[1:27:41] it has to be the ultimate
[1:27:46] reminds me this took place in hawaii
[1:27:49] this man has won
[1:27:50] many championships they were
[1:27:53] swimming in the ocean as part of this
[1:27:55] ultra marathon
[1:27:56] iron man experience and a storm blew in
[1:28:00] and they had boats out there because
[1:28:01] there were people that were
[1:28:03] foundering in the water and they had to
[1:28:05] rescue them and and this man he
[1:28:07] he moved ahead of the pack as typical
[1:28:10] and he comes out and he finishes the
[1:28:12] race and he's so exhausted he rides up
[1:28:14] to the finish line and if someone hadn't
[1:28:16] caught him he would have fallen off
[1:28:19] of of the bicycle because they sometimes
[1:28:22] you know change this around and this one
[1:28:24] particular when they finish the race on
[1:28:25] a bicycle
[1:28:27] and uh they were like hi how did you do
[1:28:29] this how did you do this
[1:28:30] and he said the whole time oh i hope you
[1:28:32] get this the whole time he said i saw
[1:28:34] myself
[1:28:35] holding this trophy
[1:28:39] i saw myself here at the finish line
[1:28:42] just like i
[1:28:42] am holding this trophy that's the only
[1:28:45] thing that kept me going is someone's
[1:28:47] going to hold the trophy
[1:28:48] and i want it to be me
[1:28:52] and they're like wow that's incredible
[1:28:54] that's incredible and as i watched that
[1:28:56] i thought no that's the son of god
[1:28:58] as it were what we've been called to do
[1:29:00] we don't look at the short term we don't
[1:29:02] look at the midterm we don't look at the
[1:29:03] trials around us we don't look at fiery
[1:29:05] trials we're looking at the finish line
[1:29:07] we're looking at the promise that god
[1:29:09] has given us and it is a sure promise
[1:29:11] because he guaranteed it himself amen it
[1:29:15] is not something that just might happen
[1:29:17] could possibly happen it will happen
[1:29:19] because you will not by emotion
[1:29:21] you will not by your intellect it will
[1:29:23] not be by someone's opinion
[1:29:25] you yourself will say i'm going to stand
[1:29:27] on the word i made a vow to god
[1:29:29] i'm going to stand on that vow i will
[1:29:32] die trying
[1:29:33] hallelujah hallelujah galatians the
[1:29:37] fifth chapter
[1:29:38] stand fast therefore in the liberty
[1:29:41] wherewith christ
[1:29:42] hath made us free are we free this
[1:29:44] morning
[1:29:45] amen claim it saints be not entangled
[1:29:48] again see that's the devil's work he's
[1:29:50] he's got his ned out there he's
[1:29:51] constantly throwing it out trying to
[1:29:53] entangle you again
[1:29:54] i've heard this before my brother and
[1:29:56] sister now i don't know why i'm going
[1:29:57] here but i'll just go here
[1:29:58] yeah i've heard this before people like
[1:30:01] well my wife and i were just
[1:30:03] well these are believers these are
[1:30:04] message believers and they're like well
[1:30:06] we're just holding it together until the
[1:30:07] kids are all grown
[1:30:08] and then we'll probably divorce and i'm
[1:30:10] like why in the world would you do that
[1:30:11] well we haven't gone along for years and
[1:30:13] i said well why
[1:30:14] and he goes oh it's a long thing you
[1:30:16] know her family's all divorced my
[1:30:18] family's all divorced and it's just the
[1:30:19] way it is
[1:30:20] i said you've been sitting under the
[1:30:21] wrong teaching the wrong preaching the
[1:30:23] wrong anointing
[1:30:24] because this is a god that breaks all of
[1:30:26] those things this is a god that empowers
[1:30:28] anyone who will stand up and say i want
[1:30:30] what the lord wants
[1:30:32] and you can't find a place in the word
[1:30:34] of god that god says
[1:30:35] i will call you my bride i will call you
[1:30:37] my wife i will call you my own
[1:30:39] until
[1:30:42] no sir this work i have begun in you
[1:30:47] i will finish well let me just take that
[1:30:51] as
[1:30:52] i'll meet you at the finish line
[1:30:56] right god's not going to come and just
[1:30:58] dole out
[1:31:01] well i hope this don't hurt anybody's
[1:31:02] feelings god ain't going to have any 40
[1:31:04] year olds living
[1:31:05] in the basement supported by someone
[1:31:08] else
[1:31:10] god's raising up a people a rugged
[1:31:12] people a word filled people a word
[1:31:15] that will stand the test come on
[1:31:19] right come on saints
[1:31:22] now look how paul brings out this
[1:31:24] struggle that takes place
[1:31:25] behold i paul saying to you that if you
[1:31:27] be circumcised
[1:31:28] christ shall profit you nothing now how
[1:31:31] is this right because under the law of
[1:31:33] moses they had to be circumcised
[1:31:35] for i testify again to every man that is
[1:31:37] circumcised he is better to do the
[1:31:39] whole law now which one of us can live
[1:31:42] the word of god never slip never fail
[1:31:48] are they here today no and they'll never
[1:31:51] be here
[1:31:54] christ has become no effect to you
[1:31:58] i've met him i'm gonna i'll tone this
[1:32:00] down i don't want to be offense i'll
[1:32:01] tone this down
[1:32:05] i don't know if any of you ever
[1:32:06] experienced this or somebody come and
[1:32:09] flip a message book open in front of you
[1:32:11] and tell you
[1:32:12] i've been following this for 50 years
[1:32:17] don't tell me
[1:32:22] okay i'm not going to tell you
[1:32:27] but you've now moved away
[1:32:32] from that and you're justified
[1:32:37] by your adherence
[1:32:40] not by revelation not by something
[1:32:44] that's real
[1:32:46] everything the prophet said i've done it
[1:32:49] can someone just go ahead and voice it
[1:32:51] real loud here who did you find in the
[1:32:53] bible that jesus spoke to
[1:32:55] that replied in that same manner
[1:33:03] rich young ruler i've done
[1:33:06] all of that that is saying oh help me
[1:33:09] that i could fulfill the words that you
[1:33:11] spoke to me said no done it all
[1:33:14] see he's now a debtor to the whole law
[1:33:17] the net result was is he couldn't keep
[1:33:19] the whole law or he wouldn't ended up
[1:33:21] over there asking
[1:33:22] for lazarus to bring him a drop of water
[1:33:28] what you know what it says who so is
[1:33:31] justified by the law i did it all
[1:33:33] you're fallen from grace for we through
[1:33:36] the spirit wait for the hope of
[1:33:37] righteousness by faith
[1:33:39] for in jesus christ neither
[1:33:40] circumstances availeth anything
[1:33:42] nor uncircumstances but faith which
[1:33:45] worketh by love
[1:33:47] you did run well
[1:33:51] come on saints let's not be speaking
[1:33:54] these words to each other
[1:33:55] you did run well
[1:33:58] which implies they're not running any
[1:34:00] longer
[1:34:02] come on it's happening amongst us don't
[1:34:04] don't stick your head in the sand
[1:34:06] it's happening amongst us people are
[1:34:08] taking their emotion
[1:34:09] their intellect their knowledge and
[1:34:11] opinions of others and they're holding
[1:34:13] them up
[1:34:13] and they're there and they're coming to
[1:34:15] the conclusion it's not worth running
[1:34:18] i can't run i can't do this i'm not
[1:34:19] going to do this
[1:34:21] come on it's righteousness by faith see
[1:34:24] neither circumstances availeth anything
[1:34:26] nor uncircum but faith which worketh by
[1:34:29] love ye did run well
[1:34:34] who who did hinder you

[1:34:54] run
[1:34:55] are you going to endure i'm not being
[1:34:58] too harsh am i
[1:35:00] i just want to tell it like it is i just
[1:35:02] want to tell it saints don't don't let
[1:35:03] these things come
[1:35:04] don't let these distractions come in

[1:36:18] peel's paid off for somebody
[1:36:20] because we got people that are offering
[1:36:22] all kinds of excuses of why they're
[1:36:24] pressing forward why they're not growing

[1:37:26] me
[1:37:28] look i'm trying to encourage you to keep
[1:37:30] running

[1:37:39] uh seals or whatever it is and and he's
[1:37:41] out there and he's went as far
[1:37:43] he's all bloody and he dislocated his
[1:37:45] shoulder and they popped it back in
[1:37:47] joint and
[1:37:47] it's just throbbing and he's ready to
[1:37:50] call it quits i believe his navy seal
[1:37:51] and
[1:37:52] he goes over there and they have a bell
[1:37:53] hanging out there in front of the
[1:37:55] building and and he goes over there and
[1:37:57] he's just reaching up there to ring the
[1:37:59] bell
[1:37:59] and here come a drill sergeant and he
[1:38:01] gets over there and i'm going to mute
[1:38:03] this down you know because obviously
[1:38:04] they're worldly people in their language
[1:38:06] as a little brother but he's up there

[1:38:09] were a woman i knew you wasn't enough i

[1:38:32] he turns around and goes back and picks
[1:38:33] up the log again and goes on
[1:38:36] and after he graduates the drill
[1:38:38] sergeant comes to him
[1:38:40] and says hey look i hope you didn't take
[1:38:42] offense by those words but i knew if i
[1:38:44] didn't do that
[1:38:45] you was gonna pull that bell
[1:38:49] and you're too much of a man to quit

[1:39:06] worship him for eternity
[1:39:07] sitting with the saints you don't want
[1:39:08] to hug peter's neck and paul's neck and
[1:39:11] you don't want to do that come on just
[1:39:13] quit
[1:39:15] but if there's something inside of you
[1:39:17] that wants to stand there one day
[1:39:20] on the sea of crystal before the throne
[1:39:22] of almighty god
[1:39:23] and something in your heart is saying

[1:40:20] verse 9
[1:40:22] amen a little leaven leaveneth the whole
[1:40:25] lump
[1:40:26] now we often look at that in a negative
[1:40:28] sense but i'm telling you if we can just
[1:40:30] as it were just forgive me
[1:40:31] if we can take just a little bit of
[1:40:32] faith and we can stand as sons and
[1:40:34] daughters of god believing
[1:40:36] the promise not backing down from it
[1:40:38] we're gonna stand it and everybody's
[1:40:39] saying what's happened to brother so and
[1:40:41] so
[1:40:41] and we can come and then we get to
[1:40:43] inject just a little bit of leaven
[1:40:48] and it starts to move not talking about
[1:40:50] us saying look what i did
[1:40:51] we're talking about the power of god
[1:40:53] obedience to the word the life
[1:40:55] and the pretty soon we live in a little
[1:40:57] here in 11 and there and then the day
[1:40:59] comes that you're in your fiery trial
[1:41:01] and someone you shared with comes back
[1:41:03] and says have faith brother
[1:41:05] have faith sister stand up don't give up
[1:41:08] i can see the finish line it's right
[1:41:10] there i can see
[1:41:12] it just stand up come on in fact i'll
[1:41:14] tell you what i'll do
[1:41:15] have any of you seen that video that man
[1:41:17] i believe is from like nigeria or
[1:41:19] something like that what country over
[1:41:20] there
[1:41:20] always produces the the ethiopia or
[1:41:23] something i don't know
[1:41:24] kenya and the man had run and and
[1:41:27] something had happened in any way he was
[1:41:28] almost lame and
[1:41:29] he comes and he thinks it's the finish
[1:41:31] line and he stops have you seen that
[1:41:33] video clip
[1:41:35] and the runner behind him which was
[1:41:37] pretty close he wasn't a long ways
[1:41:38] behind him
[1:41:39] pretty close right behind him he comes
[1:41:41] up there and the finish line is not here
[1:41:42] to the back of the church away
[1:41:44] and he comes up there and he's stopped
[1:41:46] and he can't communicate with this guy
[1:41:48] they don't speak the same language
[1:41:52] and he's trying to motion to him and the
[1:41:53] guy's like no you know
[1:41:56] i finished no
[1:41:59] gets the guy's arm around his neck walks
[1:42:02] him right up to the finish line
[1:42:05] stops just short of it lets him walk
[1:42:09] across
[1:42:10] and everybody was like why did you do
[1:42:13] that
[1:42:14] you could be the winner and he said i
[1:42:17] couldn't face my mother if i did that
[1:42:22] now my brother and sister i want to know
[1:42:23] if you couldn't face mother
[1:42:25] how would be for sons and daughters of
[1:42:27] god to just walk past another brother or
[1:42:29] sister
[1:42:30] and say well if they're not going to
[1:42:31] make it if they're not going to make it
[1:42:33] i guess that's their problem if they're
[1:42:34] not going to make it
[1:42:35] they don't know where the finish is
[1:42:36] they're confused no
[1:42:38] i couldn't face my god come on saints

[1:43:45] you because you're a god-fearing
[1:43:47] christian
[1:43:49] the spirit is coming more and more and
[1:43:50] more they hate you

[1:44:49] through all of this but i will just give
[1:44:50] a look because there's something
[1:44:52] that is catchy about this
[1:44:58] verse 1 for his mercy and earth forever
[1:45:02] verse 2 for his mercy endureth forever
[1:45:04] verse 3 for his mercy endureth forever
[1:45:06] for for his mercy endureth forever
[1:45:08] and we get to go down through every one
[1:45:10] of these scriptures my brother and
[1:45:12] sister
[1:45:13] and because his mercy endureth
[1:45:16] forever amen you've got no reason to
[1:45:19] quit
[1:45:20] you've got no excuse to quit you've got
[1:45:23] no
[1:45:24] insurmountable obstacle to quit
[1:45:27] for his mercy endureth forever

[1:45:34] say brother paul i haven't been living
[1:45:35] it i can't live it i can't seem to get
[1:45:37] ahead i can't do this just cry out for
[1:45:39] mercy
[1:45:40] because his mercy endureth forever
[1:45:43] his mercy is sufficient for you and i
[1:45:46] the word of god in the new testament
[1:45:48] says his grace is sufficient but it's
[1:45:49] the same
[1:45:50] hallelujah so we look at that my brother
[1:45:52] and sister we stand upon that
[1:45:54] now look god's got confidence in you can
[1:45:56] i have just a few more minutes
[1:45:58] amen you see god chose his present age
[1:46:01] to manifest himself
[1:46:02] in this world through you
[1:46:07] see it's not it's not just that there's
[1:46:09] word out there it's not that we've got
[1:46:11] 1200 somethings we've got 1200
[1:46:14] recordings we've got this we've got that
[1:46:16] no
[1:46:16] you see the greatest testimony
[1:46:20] that's taking place on the earth today
[1:46:23] it's you we either
[1:46:27] testify of a risen savior
[1:46:31] or we testify that it was insufficient
[1:46:36] for us to finish the race
[1:46:39] i'm telling you i don't want to be the
[1:46:40] one standing there telling god
[1:46:43] i couldn't do it he didn't give me
[1:46:45] enough mercy he didn't give me enough
[1:46:47] grace he didn't
[1:46:48] no i don't want to be that guy no sir i
[1:46:51] want to stand there saying lord i don't
[1:46:52] know how you view me lord but i'll tell
[1:46:54] you
[1:46:54] i've given all i could give and i
[1:46:56] believe your word and i just fought and
[1:46:57] i fought my fault and
[1:46:58] i'm battle scarred but lord here i am
[1:47:02] amen hallelujah
[1:47:06] now look at this do you see the twist
[1:47:10] that we're in
[1:47:11] now young people it's not applying to
[1:47:14] you right
[1:47:15] because god's called you to a different
[1:47:16] calling a higher calling
[1:47:19] so this is the counter type to you
[1:47:22] do you see the american youth what
[1:47:25] condition it's in
[1:47:27] that's the men and women of tomorrow
[1:47:37] yeah no i like to check news online
[1:47:43] los angeles
[1:47:47] vehicles full of people pulling up to a
[1:47:49] restaurant
[1:47:51] jumping out slashing people with knives
[1:47:54] beating them with sticks turning over
[1:47:55] tables
[1:47:56] one of them shows an individual clearly
[1:47:58] going up to a woman at a
[1:48:00] at a table there grabbing her drink from
[1:48:02] in front of her
[1:48:09] tell me if we them have something just a
[1:48:12] little bit prophetic in this right here
[1:48:14] no wonder jesus said except these days
[1:48:16] be short and no flesh would be saved
[1:48:19] therefore i'm basing my thoughts here
[1:48:20] that we're at the end time
[1:48:22] jesus the lord jesus shall come soon but
[1:48:25] the spirit of the day oh can you see
[1:48:27] take on your thinking can you see what's
[1:48:29] happened before this great
[1:48:31] onslaught coming on to bring the mark of
[1:48:34] the beast
[1:48:35] and to fulfill the scriptures
[1:48:38] come on our own congress here in the
[1:48:41] united states and look people say well
[1:48:42] it's united states everything's messed
[1:48:44] up in the united states i've been
[1:48:45] overseas in there before like
[1:48:46] well you know you know these islamics
[1:48:49] have it right america is the great satan
[1:48:51] i'm sorry as we go they go
[1:48:54] don't tell me that you come out with
[1:48:56] some new fashion i've been this in south
[1:48:58] america
[1:48:59] sister jerry and i be here and you just
[1:49:00] start to see the young people wearing
[1:49:02] some certain fashion here
[1:49:03] we fly down to south america and we're
[1:49:05] preaching in a little church it's in a
[1:49:07] village of two or three thousand people
[1:49:08] and they're wearing the same jeans now
[1:49:10] they might be knock off and they might
[1:49:11] have come from china
[1:49:12] but their exact same style the exact
[1:49:14] same fashion the exact same everything
[1:49:17] i'm telling you what goes here goes
[1:49:18] there
[1:49:21] there's no exemption can you see what's
[1:49:23] happening before this great onslaught
[1:49:26] what is an onslaught great outpouring a
[1:49:29] great pupish a great conquering of
[1:49:32] for this onslaught coming on to bring
[1:49:34] the mark of the beast and to fill the
[1:49:35] scripture
[1:49:37] by forcing the people after the hold is
[1:49:40] gotten just like it is in
[1:49:42] other countries we're not going to be
[1:49:45] come on let's think about america
[1:49:46] we're not going to be socialists like
[1:49:48] them and this and we're not going to be
[1:49:49] like this and we're not going to be like
[1:49:51] that
[1:49:51] we're americans we're we're exempt
[1:49:54] no you're not no sir
[1:49:58] just as beatlemania crept across the
[1:50:02] ocean
[1:50:03] so will all the spirits of this world
[1:50:06] come to our shore oh wait did not the
[1:50:09] prophet of god say paris is no longer
[1:50:12] the center or the pit of that fashion
[1:50:14] devil
[1:50:16] he said hollywood yes that's right
[1:50:19] so import export
[1:50:24] imagine forcing the people after the
[1:50:28] hold is gone just like it is in other
[1:50:29] countries
[1:50:30] force them into things that they do not
[1:50:33] accept
[1:50:37] praise god i would never ever submit
[1:50:40] myself to the mark of the beast
[1:50:47] well imagine that they went so far in
[1:50:50] our current deal i want you to catch the
[1:50:52] sign of the time
[1:50:53] we're going to create a passport and you
[1:50:55] won't be able to fly unless you've been
[1:50:57] vaccinated
[1:51:00] another liberal from somewhere back east
[1:51:02] there delaware or something's like
[1:51:03] well let's make it so they can't go from
[1:51:05] state to state unless they've been
[1:51:06] vaccinated
[1:51:08] and another one chimed in and said well
[1:51:10] maybe we should hook it to their credit
[1:51:12] card
[1:51:15] come on saints don't tell me the word of
[1:51:16] god is coming to pass
[1:51:18] that's right it's coming to pass and
[1:51:19] they don't agree
[1:51:21] people don't agree everyday people don't
[1:51:23] agree but the force
[1:51:25] pressure well we'll do this
[1:51:29] well that sounds terrible don't it won't
[1:51:30] be able to buy or sell without the mark
[1:51:32] of the beast
[1:51:34] but you know what that's not the biggest
[1:51:37] problem
[1:51:39] i think i'll just go ahead and take the
[1:51:41] mark and i'll serve
[1:51:42] god in secret
[1:51:47] won't work won't work
[1:51:51] god said come out from amongst her
[1:51:54] in other words make a stand what does
[1:51:57] that mean
[1:51:57] can i interpret that for you saints
[1:52:00] endure
[1:52:01] to the end amen don't take
[1:52:04] a compromise don't set for something
[1:52:07] else
[1:52:09] coming on to bring the mark of the beast
[1:52:11] and fulfill the scripture by forcing the
[1:52:12] people
[1:52:13] after the whole has gotten just like in
[1:52:14] other countries force them into things
[1:52:16] that they do not accept to cause the
[1:52:19] persecution
[1:52:20] and the boycott to come oh my oh my oh
[1:52:23] my this is scary i don't know if i can
[1:52:25] handle this this is scary this is scary
[1:52:27] this is scary

[1:54:42] people are like where's that where's
[1:54:43] that kind of faith where's that kind of
[1:54:44] thing we don't see it we don't see it
[1:54:46] really
[1:54:47] i'm telling you i'm not going to explain
[1:54:49] it some of it's very personal i moved a
[1:54:51] couple mountains this last week
[1:54:53] come on saints don't get into some idea
[1:54:55] that you're going to go out here and
[1:54:56] find some hill in your way and just test
[1:54:58] it to see if it works
[1:55:00] i mean how it works you have things that
[1:55:02] come as it were
[1:55:04] in your life it's a mountain it's
[1:55:06] blocking your prayer life
[1:55:08] it's blocking you understanding the word
[1:55:10] of god reading your bible it's blocking
[1:55:12] you
[1:55:13] and you start to speak to those
[1:55:14] mountains and say you know what satan i
[1:55:16] rebuke you in the name of jesus christ
[1:55:18] that spirit leave and it leaves
[1:55:22] there was a mountain oh but that
[1:55:25] are you sure brother paul well i'll tell
[1:55:28] you
[1:55:28] i'll take the position brother donny
[1:55:30] reagan says
[1:55:32] said this quite a few years ago he said
[1:55:34] i believe if the day comes
[1:55:37] and there is a literal mountain in your
[1:55:39] way
[1:55:41] it will not be because you're like i'm
[1:55:43] here to prove this
[1:55:44] it will not be because you're convinced
[1:55:49] it will because you have a need
[1:55:52] and you have the faith to meet the need
[1:55:57] hallelujah might be a literal mountain
[1:56:00] in that day
[1:56:04] it's a good deal god don't give us that
[1:56:05] kind of authority because they're
[1:56:06] building houses all over the countryside
[1:56:08] out there by us and i'd be out there
[1:56:09] saying house be removed house be removed
[1:56:11] house be removed
[1:56:17] wow now look let's hurry on here
[1:56:23] you know what just seal this deal sister
[1:56:25] amy come on
[1:56:26] amen that's the reason she's so nervous
[1:56:29] frustrated as she is
[1:56:30] is because there's a hydrogen bomb and
[1:56:32] missiles of the air
[1:56:34] that could destroy the whole world one
[1:56:36] nation is scared of the other
[1:56:37] no matter how little it is they got
[1:56:39] these missiles that they claim well just
[1:56:40] one of them
[1:56:41] they can direct them by the stars and
[1:56:43] drop them anywhere in the world they
[1:56:45] want to
[1:56:48] sorry i just had to laugh this morning
[1:56:49] it's like we got some folks in the
[1:56:51] church that
[1:56:52] kind of identify as russian
[1:56:56] i'm sorry brother sergey i just this
[1:56:58] morning had a little chuckle you know
[1:57:00] it's not like we think amen you see
[1:57:02] there's this great anointings that are
[1:57:04] out there and these great spirits of the
[1:57:05] age and
[1:57:06] god has just chosen you see there's
[1:57:08] people there that love the lord just
[1:57:10] like you and i do believers there read
[1:57:12] their bible have faith in god
[1:57:14] but you see god chose and he ordained to
[1:57:17] place these as it were
[1:57:19] places of pieces on the chessboard you
[1:57:21] might say and
[1:57:22] you look at this so don't don't ever you
[1:57:24] know don't ever have i
[1:57:25] i tell you i'll just put it this way i
[1:57:27] run into a brother once that absolutely
[1:57:29] had an absolute bias
[1:57:30] against americans the brother looked me
[1:57:32] in the face and tell me you know what
[1:57:34] according to the prophet you guys are
[1:57:35] nothing but cannon fodder just to waste
[1:57:37] your evil
[1:57:38] i was like god bless you brother but my
[1:57:41] bible says it would be safe from every
[1:57:43] nation kindred and tongue so
[1:57:44] i'm claiming that position that even in
[1:57:47] wicked as america has become
[1:57:49] there is a bride of christ coming from
[1:57:52] america
[1:57:53] hallelujah hallelujah russia as i heard
[1:57:56] on the news the other day
[1:57:58] i probably just put my foot in my mouth
[1:57:59] but did that come out positive please
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:04] the other day she claims she can destroy
[1:58:06] this nation and keep the atoms and other
[1:58:08] things and breaking up her nation
[1:58:10] we don't know what to do about it
[1:58:12] everyone is making these claims and it's
[1:58:14] so
[1:58:14] people's science has broken the gulf
[1:58:16] great laboratory until they're going to
[1:58:18] destroy themselves
[1:58:20] god lance always lets wisdom destroy
[1:58:22] himself god doesn't destroy anything
[1:58:25] god destroys himself by wisdom as he did
[1:58:27] at the beginning taking
[1:58:29] satan's wisdom instead of god's word
[1:58:32] now she knows she must give way she
[1:58:34] cannot stand it russia i believe
[1:58:37] will destroy this nation today
[1:58:40] if she thought that she could destroy it
[1:58:42] and then preserve herself
[1:58:44] any of those little nations could do it
[1:58:46] they're afraid
[1:58:49] but they know because they know that
[1:58:51] this world cannot stand
[1:58:53] in its orbit under such conditions so
[1:58:55] the world knows that her birth pains is
[1:58:57] so great she's got to give way
[1:58:59] there's going to be a new birth born at
[1:59:02] hand
[1:59:03] i'm thankful for that i'm tired of this
[1:59:05] one anyone who knows that there's a
[1:59:07] place of death and sorrow and all kinds
[1:59:08] of discrepancies and so forth
[1:59:10] and i'm glad that she has to give way
[1:59:11] and i'm glad that the time is at hand as
[1:59:14] john said of old
[1:59:15] even so come lord jesus now she must rot
[1:59:19] of course as i have said in order to
[1:59:20] bring
[1:59:21] a new birth what she has robbed into
[1:59:24] notice my brother
[1:59:25] she's totally rotten now look at this i
[1:59:28] want you to think about the day we're
[1:59:29] living in right now what's happening
[1:59:32] her politics and systems is just as
[1:59:35] rotten as they can be
[1:59:36] there isn't a sound bone in her
[1:59:40] in her world system her politics her
[1:59:42] religion politics
[1:59:44] whatever it is one says i'm a democrat
[1:59:45] i'm a republican i'm a methodist i'm a
[1:59:47] baptist why
[1:59:48] the whole thing is rotten to the court
[1:59:50] there's got to be something give way she
[1:59:52] can't stand
[1:59:53] and if you put a george washington or an
[1:59:56] abraham lincoln in every county in this
[1:59:58] united states
[1:59:59] it still couldn't come back it's beyond
[2:00:02] redemption
[2:00:03] there's only one thing that can help her
[2:00:05] that's the coming of the creator
[2:00:07] amen now i want you to look in the world
[2:00:10] we're in i don't look at these things
[2:00:12] negative i believe in being informed i
[2:00:14] believe in looking at this
[2:00:15] but my brother and sister when you have
[2:00:18] both sides they lie
[2:00:23] they manipulate they hide
[2:00:26] they deceive they kill they steal they
[2:00:28] destroy
[2:00:31] there's only one refuge that we have
[2:00:35] and the only way we find that refuge
[2:00:39] is endure
[2:00:43] scripture says there's a fountain hope
[2:00:45] open in the house of david
[2:00:47] you can't just talk about that fountain
[2:00:49] saints you've got to go get it
[2:00:52] the scripture says the house of the lord
[2:00:55] is our strong
[2:00:56] the name of the lord is our strong
[2:00:58] refuge
[2:01:00] you can't just talk about that you have
[2:01:02] to go
[2:01:03] get in it you have to endure
[2:01:06] to the end you know every person who
[2:01:10] runs the boston marathon
[2:01:13] and crosses the finish line receives a
[2:01:15] medallion
[2:01:18] did you know here a few years ago there
[2:01:20] were people who
[2:01:22] almost made the finish line
[2:01:25] i'll help you get this i read it i
[2:01:27] remember i kind of laughed and cried at
[2:01:28] the same time it's like what's happened
[2:01:30] to our nation
[2:01:31] they almost made it to the finish line
[2:01:33] they were within
[2:01:34] sight a few blocks of the finish line
[2:01:37] and they quit
[2:01:39] and they threatened if they did not
[2:01:40] receive that same medallion
[2:01:42] that they would sue them because they
[2:01:45] almost made it
[2:01:50] there's no such thing as almost eternal
[2:01:52] life
[2:01:54] there's no such thing as i almost
[2:01:56] finished this race
[2:01:59] endure saints i'm encouraging you today
[2:02:03] whatever comes your way whatever is
[2:02:05] happening in your life
[2:02:06] you might say brother paul you stepped
[2:02:08] on my toes i'm sorry i stepped on your
[2:02:09] toes but let the lord step on your heart
[2:02:13] and move you there's no place to quit no
[2:02:16] time to quit no reason to quit
[2:02:18] trust god stand on the word press
[2:02:21] forward
[2:02:22] amen do you know that it's the rules of
[2:02:24] the boston marathon as long as you are
[2:02:26] on the course they're supposed to keep
[2:02:30] the finish line up
[2:02:33] but there have been recorded times in
[2:02:34] history that people
[2:02:37] were so so long
[2:02:41] that everybody thought they were done
[2:02:42] they got wrong information they took
[2:02:44] this
[2:02:44] finish line down it's a cute story
[2:02:48] there was some people there one time
[2:02:49] this man was in desperate
[2:02:51] situation and people helped him and and
[2:02:54] went out there and walked with him and
[2:02:56] spoke encouraging words he had blood
[2:02:58] squishing out of his tennis shoes from
[2:03:00] blisters that broke and
[2:03:01] and there's no finish line and these
[2:03:03] people went and they found some stuff
[2:03:05] and they found some ribbon and they did
[2:03:06] it
[2:03:07] and they stood like on the tailgate of
[2:03:09] pickups or something and
[2:03:10] they held that because they wanted to
[2:03:12] honor this man
[2:03:14] that would finish as he stumbled across
[2:03:18] the line
[2:03:19] they had a little a little group there
[2:03:21] that gave an ovation
[2:03:22] but i'm here to tell you my brother and
[2:03:24] sister whether you are a little quicker
[2:03:26] than i am as it were whether
[2:03:29] one would pass to the other side we've
[2:03:30] had brothers sisters friends family that
[2:03:33] passed to the other side
[2:03:34] they finished the race already but god
[2:03:36] said you would finish and it doesn't
[2:03:38] matter how long it takes you to finish
[2:03:40] you will receive the same reward
[2:03:45] if you endure oh are we going to endure
