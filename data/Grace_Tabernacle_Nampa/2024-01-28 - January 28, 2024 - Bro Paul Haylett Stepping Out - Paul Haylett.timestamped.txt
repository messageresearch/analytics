[46:10] that we just have to step out uh it it's
[46:14] a two-sided thought in that realm
[46:17] sometimes we just got to step out of the
[46:19] things of this world Amen you got to
[46:22] just detach yourself from that and some
[46:25] times when it comes to the things that
[46:27] God is doing in our presence in our
[46:30] lives we have to step out we step out in
[46:32] faith every day amen and you know if
[46:36] you're not stepping out in faith then I
[46:38] I'm just actually going to pray that God
[46:40] challenges you greater that causes you
[46:42] to step out in faith to claim the
[46:45] promise and and be able to step into
[46:47] that promise that he's given Proverbs
[46:50] the 16th chapter verses
[46:54] 1-9 the preparation of the heart in man
[46:57] and the answer of the tongue is from the
[47:00] Lord all the ways of a man are clean in
[47:04] his own eyes but the Lord weth the
[47:07] spirits commit thy Works unto the Lord
[47:10] and thy thoughts shall be established
[47:12] you know in a day that we're living in
[47:14] that Satan is fighting against the mind
[47:18] in all aspects my brother and sister
[47:20] never an age that so many people and I'm
[47:22] not speaking down on this but it's just
[47:24] a a spirit of the age
[47:26] never been an age like this where we
[47:28] need help to wake up we need help to go
[47:30] to sleep we need help to have Clarity
[47:32] and and people would say well that
[47:34] that's that's that's a bad thing but
[47:36] it's an Evidence of the Battleground
[47:38] that Satan chose amen he chose to to
[47:42] fight against the mind uh and so if
[47:45] we'll just commit our works unto the
[47:47] Lord th thoughts shall be established
[47:50] the Lord hath made all things for
[47:52] himself yay even the wicked for the day
[47:54] of evil everyone that is proud in heart
[47:58] is an Abomination to the Lord uh though
[48:01] hand made uh though hand join in hand he
[48:04] shall not be unpunished but mercy and
[48:07] Truth iniquity by Mercy and Truth
[48:11] iniquity is purged and by the fear of
[48:13] the Lord men depart from Evil when a
[48:17] man's ways please the Lord he maketh
[48:20] even his enemies to be at peace with him
[48:23] better is a little with rightous nness
[48:26] than great revenues without right a
[48:29] man's heart deviseth his way but the
[48:32] Lord directeth his steps Heavenly Father
[48:35] we ask for your blessings upon this
[48:37] thought today bless the Saints father
[48:39] Lord all those who are not here today
[48:42] brother Isaac sister christen's children
[48:44] not feeling well father we ask you to be
[48:47] with them if there be any that were
[48:49] missed today Father we just ask that
[48:51] your Holy Spirit would just go out speak
[48:54] to hearts Lord Lord give us strength to
[48:56] serve you I pray in the name of Jesus
[48:58] Christ amen you may be
[49:03] seated you know the scripture tells us
[49:06] that there is a season for everything
[49:08] under the sun and as we look in the
[49:11] world that we live in today uh I would
[49:14] say this is certainly a season for us to
[49:16] have confidence in God it is a time when
[49:19] the world is so troubled my brother and
[49:21] sister you can go very easily very
[49:24] quickly on the computer and and uh just
[49:27] ask it to give you the results of recent
[49:30] polls and you'll find that they have a
[49:32] poll for almost everything in the world
[49:34] today they have polls on how many
[49:37] Christians uh uh take their Bible to
[49:39] church they have polls on how many
[49:41] people believe the future of our nation
[49:44] is at risk and a poll for everything and
[49:47] often times if we're not careful we get
[49:49] caught up in the the uh atmosphere you
[49:53] might say of the season that we're
[49:55] living in but you know it is there that
[49:59] we are called by the word of God in this
[50:01] season a season that has been prophesied
[50:05] to uh bring about these things uh it's
[50:08] just time for us simply to step out and
[50:10] say you know Lord I'm not going to look
[50:13] at news I'm not going to look at the
[50:15] financial world I'm not going to look at
[50:17] what's going on around us I'm simply
[50:19] going to look at your word and I'm going
[50:21] to have confidence in that word amen and
[50:24] I will say it this way I I know this
[50:25] from a personal point that a little
[50:28] trust in the Lord goes a long way in our
[50:30] life amen we don't have to be some
[50:32] Supernatural super spiritual person you
[50:35] know that's always got a great
[50:37] manifestation of something going on
[50:38] around us but sometimes just a simple
[50:41] trust before you go out the door in the
[50:43] morning to say Lord I give this day to
[50:46] you and ask you to just guide my
[50:47] footsteps and keep me today and you know
[50:51] it actually changes your atmosphere now
[50:54] I I for one like to get up in the
[50:56] morning and at some point in the morning
[50:58] there I I like to go and kind of see
[51:01] what the news is in the world I like to
[51:03] kind of see just a more of curiosity I
[51:06] don't use it to influence what I think
[51:08] or what direction I'm going but I'm
[51:10] really wanting to see just what the
[51:12] world is doing today and you know when
[51:14] you look at that my brother and sister
[51:15] if you take that to heart you walk out
[51:18] the door of your house with a very
[51:19] negative atmosphere about you they're
[51:22] they're projecting the economy to
[51:24] decline they're projecting that this to
[51:26] fail and that to fail but I'll tell you
[51:28] one thing that they don't ever talk
[51:30] about is the fact the word of God cannot
[51:32] fail amen and and as we are there you
[51:35] look at this and realize God's in
[51:37] control the scripture just said that he
[51:40] directs our steps now we make plans I I
[51:43] I'm a firm believer I I don't know where
[51:45] you stand but I trust you should be a
[51:47] firm believer you make plans for
[51:49] tomorrow amen you you work you buy a
[51:52] house you pay for that house you you
[51:54] make a good responsible decisions and
[51:57] you do all of that believing that the
[52:00] coming of the Lord is imminent believing
[52:02] that the coming of the Lord could be
[52:04] this very day but we don't just sit down
[52:07] and we don't just say well the Lord's in
[52:09] control I'll do nothing no if the Lord's
[52:11] truly in control then you will come to
[52:15] him and present your future and then let
[52:18] him guide that future amen so it's time
[52:21] as I said to have confidence in God Amen
[52:25] and in a world we live in today I just
[52:28] looked at a recent poll I found it
[52:30] disturbing less and less Christians are
[52:33] believing the word of God is
[52:39] infallible I want that to soak
[52:42] in if this is not
[52:45] infallible what part do we
[52:48] trust and what part do we
[52:52] distrust some would say well I trust Ed
[52:55] and it didn't
[52:58] work maybe you didn't take the right
[53:01] attitude to the word if God said no and
[53:05] you were sure it should be yes maybe you
[53:07] won't trust the Lord but you see calling
[53:11] back to our scripture you see if we
[53:15] devise our
[53:17] way and we believe that God should
[53:20] follow our footsteps you're going to be
[53:23] disappointed but if you're willing to
[53:26] make plans and then say Lord give me
[53:29] wisdom give me direction Lord guide me
[53:32] then you will find that God will take
[53:34] you through
[53:36] circumstances I I could give so many uh
[53:39] examples in my own life that that uh
[53:42] would just take all of our time but
[53:44] there's been times in my life I was
[53:46] certain of a certain direction and then
[53:49] things didn't go that way things didn't
[53:51] happen the way that I thought and at the
[53:54] time I have to to tell you I was
[53:56] disappointed but just a few short years
[53:59] down the road I realized how much God
[54:03] had had his hand on my life because a
[54:06] few short years down the road I realized
[54:08] if it had worked the way I wanted it to
[54:11] work I had just moved disappointment
[54:14] from there to
[54:16] here I would have just moved struggle
[54:20] from there to here but you see God knew
[54:25] what today would be what we thought 5
[54:28] years ago 10 years
[54:31] ago we can look back now and know what
[54:34] was the perfect will of God to make the
[54:36] right
[54:37] decision
[54:39] amen you know
[54:42] I I look at Luke
[54:45] 24 when you get a look back down the
[54:48] road Luke 24 is speaking of those on the
[54:51] road to
[54:53] emus and here was these
[54:57] brothers they're walking down the road
[54:59] to emus and they're speaking one to
[55:02] another of the struggles that they've
[55:04] had and how that they were sure
[55:10] that Christ would have delivered Christ
[55:14] would have been the
[55:16] answer and the scripture says that they
[55:18] were
[55:20] sad they're reminiscing of what they
[55:22] have just experienced they've just saw
[55:24] their delivered the one they had faith
[55:26] and confidence in they've just saw him
[55:29] crucified and without Revelation my
[55:32] brother and sister the crucifixion is
[55:34] the end without understanding of the
[55:37] plan of God the crucifixion was the
[55:39] Finish they're walking down the road
[55:42] very sad I Can Only Imagine by by human
[55:45] nature that they're saying you know I
[55:46] thought that this would happen and he
[55:49] had said this and I was sure that that
[55:52] meant this and they're walking along
[55:54] there but the emphasis I want to give to
[55:56] you as they were walking along there not
[55:58] in Revelation not in joy not in
[56:02] happiness there was nothing in their
[56:04] hearts that was bubbling over but they
[56:06] were walking truly down the road H as a
[56:09] sad
[56:10] people and you know that you can by
[56:14] human nature just look at people how
[56:17] their body English is now I don't want
[56:20] this to sound creepy but if you ever
[56:21] look into those aspects of what body
[56:24] English means those people who know it
[56:27] very well you know they understand the
[56:30] very subtities of of people's movement
[56:32] and eye movements and hand movements
[56:35] head gesture posture all of these things
[56:38] and I'm telling you these two brothers
[56:40] were walking down the road to emus
[56:42] almost dragging their
[56:44] feet they were walking down that road in
[56:47] such a heavy load of
[56:49] disappointment of what could have been
[56:51] and should have been but did not happen
[56:55] they hardly even notice when one comes
[56:57] from the shoulder of the shadow of the
[57:00] road and comes and starts to walk with
[57:02] them but as he starts to speak to them
[57:06] they start to realize something a little
[57:08] different here something's going on and
[57:11] I I can just see them starting to react
[57:14] to the words that Jesus was speaking to
[57:16] them and as it is it starts to change an
[57:19] atmosphere aren't you glad we have
[57:21] Revelation to understand we can change
[57:24] atmosphere around us we can change
[57:26] atmosphere in our home sometimes as
[57:29] simple as putting on the right music
[57:32] will change the atmosphere sometimes
[57:34] picking up our Bible change the
[57:36] atmosphere picking up you know our
[57:38] praying would change the atmosphere we
[57:41] don't have to sit and dwell in that old
[57:43] sad and disappointed atmosphere but we
[57:46] can live in an atmosphere of joy and
[57:49] happiness and I'm glad today it's not
[57:51] psychology my brother and sister it's
[57:54] not something that man's doing but it's
[57:56] when we call the presence of God or open
[57:59] the door for the presence of God to come
[58:02] down with us in other words if you meet
[58:05] people that have a welcoming Spirit you
[58:09] feel
[58:10] welcome and if you meet people who have
[58:13] an unwelcoming Spirit you know what I'm
[58:16] talking about you don't have to like ask
[58:18] them do you have an unwelcoming Spirit
[58:21] you know that they don't want to talk to
[58:23] you they know you know that there that
[58:25] atmosphere is not
[58:27] conducive but my brother and sister you
[58:30] you can well I'll just give you a little
[58:34] example I was
[58:37] driving on the
[58:39] highway headed out towards our
[58:42] house and I noticed there's a pickup on
[58:45] the side of the road I noticed there's a
[58:47] man on this side of the road I noticed
[58:49] there's a woman on the other side of the
[58:52] road much closer to me and a little dog
[58:56] running down the middle of the
[58:57] road and this couple had been driving
[59:00] down there and and they saw the little
[59:02] dog dodging in and out of the traffic
[59:04] and a couple cars almost hitting it and
[59:07] and they admitted that they have a soft
[59:09] spot for animals so they pulled over
[59:11] they're trying to catch the little dog
[59:13] and and uh so I I put on the flashers
[59:16] and got out and we got the little dog to
[59:18] go over and one of the parking spaces
[59:20] off the side of the lake and and finally
[59:22] the little dog let the man catch him and
[59:24] and uh so we're we're just interacting
[59:27] and uh as we're talking I find out you
[59:30] know a little bit of where they live
[59:32] they were real very open people and
[59:34] where they live and um you know what
[59:37] happening in their life and um just uh a
[59:41] great interaction and as we close this
[59:43] out I don't even know why but something
[59:46] I just uttered God bless you and
[59:48] somebody poured cold water on
[59:53] us love lovely
[59:56] people but at the words of God bless you
[1:00:00] they got all stiff and
[1:00:02] awkward now I'm not judging them by that
[1:00:04] but I'm telling you atmosphere can
[1:00:07] change and just as sure as atmosphere
[1:00:09] can go chill atmosphere can be warmed
[1:00:13] amen and so we realize that the
[1:00:16] atmosphere as they're walking down the
[1:00:18] road to emus that they're talking about
[1:00:21] what could have been and this missed
[1:00:23] opportunity and uh you know they're
[1:00:25] going home to figure out what's
[1:00:28] next they're not going home to hold a
[1:00:30] Revival they're not going home to
[1:00:32] testify of Jesus Christ to their
[1:00:34] neighbor because Jesus Christ has just
[1:00:36] been
[1:00:40] crucified and the atmosphere that must
[1:00:42] have been with
[1:00:44] him but in that time in that atmosphere
[1:00:47] Christ said I'm going to come on the
[1:00:49] scene and that is what we should look
[1:00:51] for my brother and sister not what is
[1:00:53] wrong but we should should look for
[1:00:55] Christ coming on the scene we should be
[1:00:57] saying Lord I know you're real and I
[1:00:59] know you're here and I'm just opening
[1:01:01] myself up to receive you I I want to
[1:01:03] hear from you I need to change this
[1:01:05] atmosphere amen and you know as we look
[1:01:08] at this that's the reason the scripture
[1:01:10] tells us that uh there is uh uh the
[1:01:13] scripture saying without a vision the
[1:01:15] people perish and how many times I'm not
[1:01:19] expecting you to lift a hand but how
[1:01:20] many times has Satan come in and kind of
[1:01:23] tampered with our vision of who we are
[1:01:25] as Sons and Daughters of God and when
[1:01:27] that happens it it drastically changes
[1:01:30] how we see
[1:01:33] everything you
[1:01:36] know the devil Works in such a fashion
[1:01:39] he can take and turn positive things
[1:01:42] into
[1:01:43] negative in a snap of a
[1:01:46] finger but I'm here to tell you that the
[1:01:49] presence of the Lord will take those
[1:01:51] negative things and turn them positive
[1:01:54] and the snap of a finger we see people
[1:01:57] my brother and sister that have not been
[1:01:59] serving God for years the Holy Spirit
[1:02:02] come down and move in their presence and
[1:02:04] they break down and give their heart
[1:02:06] back to Christ my brother and sister
[1:02:08] when people thought this is the same as
[1:02:10] it's always been this will be what it
[1:02:12] will be to the coming of the Lord no my
[1:02:14] brother and sister you ever get someone
[1:02:17] in the presence of Jesus Christ it will
[1:02:20] change the atmosphere it will change
[1:02:22] their point of view it will change the
[1:02:24] direction of their
[1:02:26] lives but we live in a world we become
[1:02:29] so ingrained by the spirits of the age
[1:02:32] that we become a little bit
[1:02:35] cynical I don't expect anyone to raise
[1:02:38] their hand this morning but I believe
[1:02:40] I'm safe to say that if we're not
[1:02:42] careful we can find ourselves moving
[1:02:44] from a position of Faith to a cynic in a
[1:02:52] heartbeat people f fail
[1:02:56] us we fail
[1:02:59] us can someone say Amen we fail us it's
[1:03:04] easy to look at what they did and failed
[1:03:06] us but what about the time we fail
[1:03:09] us and how much that we fail our Lord
[1:03:12] Jesus Christ scripture says that we all
[1:03:15] come short of the glory of God this is
[1:03:18] not comparing us to them me to you you
[1:03:22] to me this is us looking at the word and
[1:03:25] saying you know what I wasn't called to
[1:03:27] fail my Lord amen and if I'm living a
[1:03:29] life that doesn't fail him then I'm not
[1:03:31] going to be living a life that fails me
[1:03:34] or my spouse or my children or my
[1:03:36] parents amen it is a point we have to
[1:03:39] figure out where we want to stand I say
[1:03:43] we have a vision and I'm going to speak
[1:03:45] real blunt this morning Grace Tabernacle
[1:03:47] what is our
[1:03:48] vision what is our vision do we do we
[1:03:51] want to come I I just was speaking to
[1:03:53] the young people a little a little bit
[1:03:54] tied together in thought but you know
[1:03:56] what is our vision today do we want to
[1:03:59] just be a church we come to we got come
[1:04:02] on Sundays we have some activities we
[1:04:04] have some fellowship it's good to beong
[1:04:07] or do we want to be a church that the
[1:04:09] holy spirit is comfortable in the Holy
[1:04:11] Spirit wants to be here with us and we
[1:04:13] want to be with him in his presence and
[1:04:16] and there atmosphere that we actually
[1:04:18] would cry out to God and say Lord when I
[1:04:20] get to church today let me be a
[1:04:22] contributor to the lick of fire let me
[1:04:25] be a contributor to the atmosphere
[1:04:29] positively now I realize Saints don't
[1:04:32] don't misunderstand me there's times
[1:04:35] that we come to church and if I could
[1:04:37] just do this figuratively there's times
[1:04:39] we come to church that we literally just
[1:04:41] need a little
[1:04:44] something but often times that's because
[1:04:47] we haven't dealt with the atmosphere
[1:04:49] before as we come into this
[1:04:52] position you don't don't deal with
[1:04:54] atmosphere Sunday morning you deal with
[1:04:57] atmosphere in the days
[1:04:59] before then you come in there you come
[1:05:02] fortified you come strengthened you come
[1:05:04] filled with the spirit of God come in
[1:05:06] the house of God now look I'm not
[1:05:08] preaching down on you I'm preaching to
[1:05:09] myself this morning amen are you okay
[1:05:12] with me preaching it myself today amen
[1:05:15] but we come and the difference then that
[1:05:17] it makes is we come and we're a
[1:05:19] contributor my lick of Fire tied with
[1:05:21] your lick of Fire tied with your lick of
[1:05:22] Fire tied with your lick of fire we come
[1:05:25] in the house of God and we say boy it
[1:05:26] was a good service today amen what is it
[1:05:29] because our lick of fire is not
[1:05:32] diminished by being in the house of God
[1:05:34] with other Saints but it's reinforced
[1:05:37] it's uh it's influenced to a greater
[1:05:40] calling amen you guys are quiet this
[1:05:43] morning Hallelujah that's all right I
[1:05:46] had a brother tell me we're quiet
[1:05:47] because we're
[1:05:49] eating amen just as long as you don't
[1:05:52] leave cracker crumbs in the church
[1:05:55] amen but you see we need a
[1:06:00] vision I want to ask you kind of
[1:06:02] directly as we're walking our road to
[1:06:05] emus is our conversation about what is
[1:06:07] wrong what is
[1:06:09] missing is our conversation about what
[1:06:11] is wrong here and what is wrong there
[1:06:14] our road to emus what are we talking
[1:06:16] about my brother and sister are we
[1:06:19] talking about how great it was to be in
[1:06:21] the house of God to be in the presence
[1:06:23] of the Lord are we talking about the
[1:06:25] positive things or are we talking about
[1:06:28] what is
[1:06:29] wrong cuz you know you can spoil a
[1:06:32] perfectly good
[1:06:33] conversation with
[1:06:35] criticism with a negative comment even a
[1:06:39] negative thought we can pull the power
[1:06:42] right out right amen the prophet taught
[1:06:45] us that the holy spirit's like a dove it
[1:06:47] it's not going to hang around while
[1:06:49] we're eating Buzzard food it's going to
[1:06:52] fly and sit on a limb and wait for us to
[1:06:54] get correct yes I tell you what I want
[1:06:58] the Holy Spirit to be in every service
[1:07:00] that's in this church I want the power
[1:07:02] of God not to be here that we're begging
[1:07:05] for God to come and do something but
[1:07:07] God's right here in our midst doing
[1:07:10] something amen can you say that's what I
[1:07:12] want to I want the power of God to be
[1:07:15] with me to walk with me and I can tell
[1:07:18] you right now I'll make a public
[1:07:19] confession the preacher sometimes has
[1:07:22] negative thoughts
[1:07:25] are you with me yeah amen none of us are
[1:07:28] exempt but we have the word we know what
[1:07:31] the word said and the word gave us a
[1:07:33] solution how to get our thoughts back on
[1:07:35] track to be thinking on the things of
[1:07:38] God to be coming to a place my brother
[1:07:40] and sister that the holy spirit says
[1:07:42] I'll meet you in there I'll meet you in
[1:07:45] there I'm telling you the song says that
[1:07:48] the cynic's not going to be there and
[1:07:49] the doubter is not going to be there the
[1:07:51] criticizer if I can just add some more
[1:07:53] to the the verses criticizer is not
[1:07:55] going to be there amen the unbeliever
[1:07:57] certainly won't be there the one that
[1:07:59] didn't do anything at all is not going
[1:08:01] to be there I want to be there can you
[1:08:04] say amen amen I want the word of God to
[1:08:07] be so alive in me that I'm not over here
[1:08:10] battling these things oh I I just don't
[1:08:13] even want to go I don't even want to do
[1:08:15] this I don't even want to do that I
[1:08:17] don't even I don't think I don't want to
[1:08:18] go to church I go to church amen there
[1:08:21] there is just uh I don't know there's a
[1:08:23] bunch of Hypocrites in church I seen a
[1:08:26] little deal the other day it's why it's
[1:08:28] why real Believers don't go to ball
[1:08:32] games have you guys seen that
[1:08:37] one do real Believers not go to ball
[1:08:39] games because of
[1:08:42] Doctrine it was a Twist on Words real
[1:08:44] Believers don't go to ball games because
[1:08:46] there's Hypocrites there and there's
[1:08:49] Liars there and the the pitcher and the
[1:08:52] coach didn't come visit me at home no it
[1:08:55] was actually turning this around uh
[1:08:57] throwing it back to people's excuses why
[1:08:59] they don't go to church amen so nobody's
[1:09:03] going to go to the ball games but the
[1:09:04] ball games are clear full yeah while the
[1:09:07] polls say that churches are getting
[1:09:09] emptier and emptier and emptier the ball
[1:09:11] game's getting Fuller and Fuller and
[1:09:13] Fuller now I I I'm just I hope you have
[1:09:16] a little humor this morning the average
[1:09:18] cost of a Major League baseball game in
[1:09:21] the cheap seats is now over
[1:09:24] $75 so we offer you very nice seating if
[1:09:28] you could just go ahead and um buy your
[1:09:31] ticket for this
[1:09:33] morning
[1:09:35] amen come on my brother and sisters see
[1:09:37] the world we're living in is full clear
[1:09:40] full of inequity of thought and emotion
[1:09:44] and reasoning so we find how Satan works
[1:09:48] his way in and he uh blurs the line that
[1:09:51] we feel this way about this but feel
[1:09:53] totally the opposite about something
[1:09:55] else and it is that we ought to have
[1:09:57] consistency amen hallelujah now I wasn't
[1:10:00] really honestly speaking about ball
[1:10:02] games I just wanted to make that point
[1:10:04] amen so as we look at
[1:10:07] this let our conversation be about what
[1:10:10] is right not what is wrong now we don't
[1:10:14] stick our head in the sand as a church
[1:10:15] or men of the church to have proper
[1:10:18] guidance and Direction but the same
[1:10:21] direction same thought Saints we don't
[1:10:24] spend our time focus on what's wrong
[1:10:26] amen you know if you study Moses Israel
[1:10:30] coming out of Egypt it's not very hard
[1:10:33] to come to the conclusion of what
[1:10:35] happened to all the people who only saw
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:40] negative now I'm not okay I don't know
[1:10:43] where this come from probably the devil
[1:10:45] no no you have a
[1:10:48] voice if there's things that ought to be
[1:10:51] in the
[1:10:52] church you have have a voice that's not
[1:10:54] what we're talking about I'm talking
[1:10:56] about everyday conversation everyday
[1:10:58] Spirit everyday attitude if the church
[1:11:00] is out of line Ministries out of line
[1:11:02] something's out of line you don't have
[1:11:04] to remain silent you don't have to feel
[1:11:06] muzzled you have a voice but our
[1:11:08] everyday life amen ought not be about
[1:11:13] what's wrong it ought to be about what's
[1:11:14] right amen amen I've got a promise in
[1:11:18] the word the Lord Jesus said I'll lead
[1:11:20] you and guide you into some of the truth
[1:11:23] some of the time no that's not what my
[1:11:26] Bible says my Bible says he promised he
[1:11:29] would lead me and guide me into all
[1:11:31] truth every single time amen I don't
[1:11:35] have to settle for less you don't have
[1:11:37] to settle for less amen so we look at
[1:11:41] this let's make sure our vision as a
[1:11:43] church is a correct vision amen our
[1:11:47] conversation is a correct
[1:11:51] conversation amen
[1:11:54] but the speaking of the
[1:11:56] word they're walking with this unknown
[1:11:59] character unnamed character this walking
[1:12:02] down the road to
[1:12:04] emus and he starts to speak to them can
[1:12:08] you remember the scripture kind of in
[1:12:09] your mind can you kind of bring that
[1:12:12] up did Jesus soft soap
[1:12:15] them he spoke kind of direct did he
[1:12:19] not you people of little faith
[1:12:25] no
[1:12:26] Revelation no understand have I been
[1:12:29] with you and this is what it
[1:12:32] produced he spoke very strongly he
[1:12:36] didn't cut them any slack he didn't baby
[1:12:38] them he didn't say oh maybe maybe when I
[1:12:40] was speaking The Sermon on the Mount I I
[1:12:43] I didn't express it corre
[1:12:48] right no sorry he spoke the word the
[1:12:51] word changed the atmosphere the the word
[1:12:53] changed their focus and the word started
[1:12:56] uncovering see Revelation was already in
[1:12:58] them but the word started shoveling all
[1:13:00] the doubts and all the fears that are
[1:13:02] trying to
[1:13:04] blanket
[1:13:06] Faith are we doing okay amen okay so
[1:13:10] what was what was the Lord doing amen
[1:13:13] they're Walking In The Presence of
[1:13:15] Jehovah and they in this
[1:13:18] walk as he's speaking the word something
[1:13:21] starts to change amen burdens are taken
[1:13:25] off they realize the word's still living
[1:13:28] the word didn't die at the crucifixion
[1:13:30] of Jesus Christ the word's still living
[1:13:33] it's still alive and they started to
[1:13:35] realize there is still something
[1:13:37] happening God is still doing a mighty
[1:13:39] work and so In The Presence of Jehovah
[1:13:42] they stepped out of the old atmosphere
[1:13:45] into a new atmosphere but it was
[1:13:47] subconscious now look I I I don't know
[1:13:50] if this is striking you today but my
[1:13:52] brother and sister s you don't have to
[1:13:54] lift a hand but how many times we come
[1:13:55] in the house of God we're burdened by a
[1:13:58] burden or we're burdened by an attitude
[1:14:00] or we have an issue with something and
[1:14:02] at the worship and the preaching of the
[1:14:05] word we actually feel our burden
[1:14:09] lightning we actually feel the
[1:14:12] atmosphere in ourself around ourself
[1:14:15] changing what is that that's the
[1:14:18] presence of Christ just as he was on the
[1:14:21] road to emus he's right here with us and
[1:14:24] it's changing our atmosphere on our road
[1:14:28] and as we're walking along he's coming
[1:14:31] now we might actually you might say be
[1:14:33] sitting but it is in this travel this
[1:14:35] road that we're going he comes and says
[1:14:38] I'm going to walk with you aren't you
[1:14:39] glad he'll walk with us amen he's not
[1:14:42] just sitting back as a God in the
[1:14:44] heavens somewhere letting us just labor
[1:14:47] and labor and labor but he comes down
[1:14:49] and he walks with us and he talks with
[1:14:53] us us
[1:14:55] amen you know had somebody one time say
[1:14:57] well I don't think the Lord's everever
[1:15:00] spoke to
[1:15:01] me and I I I me how how are you going to
[1:15:10] answer but we just go on in
[1:15:15] conversation just go on in
[1:15:21] conversation oh yeah let me share this
[1:15:23] with
[1:15:24] you I was in my hometown and I was going
[1:15:27] through there and I just started to go
[1:15:29] in the intersection and I don't know why
[1:15:31] I paused car behind me honked and and
[1:15:33] then I started to go and a car
[1:15:37] completely run that red light went
[1:15:39] through the intersection 50 m an hour if
[1:15:41] I had just been 20 feet farther
[1:15:44] forward I would have been
[1:15:48] broadsided I'm thinking God doesn't
[1:15:50] speak to
[1:15:52] you
[1:15:54] oh you know I the other day my little
[1:15:56] granddaughter got
[1:15:58] sick and you know we were thinking do we
[1:16:00] take her to the doctor or not do we take
[1:16:02] her to the doctor or not and then we
[1:16:04] decided we should just lay hands on her
[1:16:06] we're Believers and we do what believers
[1:16:09] do what do believers do they believe
[1:16:13] amen so we we just you know decided
[1:16:15] we're going to just lay our hands on on
[1:16:18] our little granddaughter and then they
[1:16:20] prayed for their little granddaughter
[1:16:22] and 30 minutes later she's over there in
[1:16:24] the closet tearing the toys out playing
[1:16:26] with them but God doesn't speak to me
[1:16:30] you see what happens is Satan has tried
[1:16:32] to redefine what the voice of God is in
[1:16:35] our life we need some kind of
[1:16:38] outright voice that is echoing booming
[1:16:41] off the walls almost like driving down
[1:16:44] the the freeway and and the sign changes
[1:16:47] and says
[1:16:50] Paul no we don't need that my brother
[1:16:52] and sister we need need to become
[1:16:53] sensitive to the moving of the Holy
[1:16:55] Spirit he's walking with us amen do we
[1:16:58] believe that is a promise today he's
[1:17:00] walking with us if he is walking with us
[1:17:03] my brother and sister we are hearing we
[1:17:06] are directed in our footsteps by him and
[1:17:10] and so Satan will come and say well God
[1:17:12] hasn't spoken to
[1:17:14] you yes he
[1:17:16] has yes he has you read your Bible you
[1:17:19] say Amen to it you sing the songs of
[1:17:21] praise and your heart is stirred God is
[1:17:24] speaking Satan is trying to redefine
[1:17:27] what the voice of God is in our
[1:17:29] generation amen it is not a cultural
[1:17:31] voice my brother and sister it's not
[1:17:33] even a religious voice amen God is Not
[1:17:36] veiled in religion he's veiled in his
[1:17:40] word amen religion as we're speaking to
[1:17:43] the young adults is a covering amen now
[1:17:46] it's one thing you can feel religious
[1:17:48] and not be out of the will of God but
[1:17:50] just cuz you feel religious doesn't mean
[1:17:52] you're in the will will of
[1:17:54] God that silenced
[1:17:58] y'all so they stepped out of the
[1:18:01] presence of the old into the presence of
[1:18:03] the new
[1:18:04] subconsciously you'll see it wasn't
[1:18:06] until he broke bread that they become
[1:18:08] conscious of who was in their presence
[1:18:10] they walked down the road the atmosphere
[1:18:13] being changed
[1:18:15] subconsciously you
[1:18:17] see the atmosphere had to be changed on
[1:18:20] the road so that when they were breaking
[1:18:23] the bread they could receive
[1:18:26] it he didn't come at that moment and
[1:18:28] break the atmosphere and then open their
[1:18:30] eyes he was already opening their
[1:18:33] eyes by the conversation of the
[1:18:37] word see how that shows us how important
[1:18:40] our conversation
[1:18:42] is amen so the Lord was directing their
[1:18:45] steps you know what they didn't receive
[1:18:47] my brother and sisters the crucifixion
[1:18:49] of Christ the preaching of the word The
[1:18:50] Sermon on the Mount and all these other
[1:18:52] oper opportunities what they didn't
[1:18:54] receive there God didn't say well I
[1:18:56] guess you're not mine you didn't get it
[1:18:58] no he said I've got a Divine appointment
[1:19:01] with two brothers on the road to emus
[1:19:03] and I'm going to meet them there because
[1:19:05] they're mine they're sons of God I'm
[1:19:07] going to meet them there and I'm going
[1:19:08] to use them to become a witness or a
[1:19:10] testimony that God will meet you where
[1:19:13] you're at amen God didn't say well I'll
[1:19:16] just wait till they get back in church
[1:19:18] sometime no he went to them aren't you
[1:19:21] glad yes I'm telling you I look at my
[1:19:24] own life and just realize how gracious
[1:19:26] God is to meet you where you're at amen
[1:19:30] it's no less
[1:19:32] significant if he met you on the
[1:19:34] backside of the
[1:19:36] farm he met you in the park he met you
[1:19:39] walking out to a mailbox that's
[1:19:42] irrelevant my brother and sister the
[1:19:44] fact is he met you amen people are like
[1:19:47] I I got saved in this great big church
[1:19:49] here I got saved over here under this
[1:19:51] ministry that's well and good I'm not
[1:19:53] going to fault that but that has no more
[1:19:56] significance than the one who's in the
[1:19:58] cow pasture and God met
[1:20:00] him yeah come on let's be honest with
[1:20:09] ourselves the before during and
[1:20:12] after I think every one of us that's old
[1:20:15] enough to comprehend this sees the
[1:20:18] before the during and the
[1:20:21] after amen
[1:20:23] Corinthians 2 Corinthians
[1:20:26] 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:20:29] he is a new
[1:20:30] creature old things are passed away
[1:20:33] behold All Things become new isn't that
[1:20:36] a lovely scripture I I like that
[1:20:38] scripture it is to me a very significant
[1:20:41] scripture to give us the understanding
[1:20:45] as we walk on our road to emus we get to
[1:20:48] step out in faith that having met Christ
[1:20:53] he's changed our
[1:20:54] life and we get to meet him by privilege
[1:20:58] again and again and again and we're
[1:21:00] constantly being changed the old things
[1:21:02] are passing away and those things are
[1:21:05] becoming new you know it was by the
[1:21:08] opening of the
[1:21:10] word our lives were
[1:21:13] changed now my brother and sister this
[1:21:15] might be subject to
[1:21:18] opinion I don't mind if you view it from
[1:21:20] a different angle I've kind of got
[1:21:22] caught up with the analogy that we
[1:21:24] sometimes struggle that I don't see it
[1:21:26] like you see it well let's just park a
[1:21:28] horse right here in the middle of the
[1:21:29] church okay y'all mind if our imaginary
[1:21:32] AI horse is now standing here in the
[1:21:35] middle of the
[1:21:37] church is that
[1:21:40] okay now you guys on that end he's he's
[1:21:43] facing you tell me what you
[1:21:49] see ears eyes
[1:21:55] nose horse
[1:21:58] lips
[1:22:00] chest but the brother say brother
[1:22:02] Trevor's over here looking at it now
[1:22:04] from the left side and you say well I
[1:22:07] see I see you know certain colored eye
[1:22:10] or something I see a little scar on the
[1:22:12] nose brother Trevor is going to say I
[1:22:14] don't see
[1:22:18] that what I see is a sweat mark from a
[1:22:21] cinch and maybe a a certain little Mark
[1:22:24] on the horse and I see this and I see
[1:22:26] that and I see a a little scar on the
[1:22:29] back of the left
[1:22:32] front and you'll be up there saying I
[1:22:34] don't see
[1:22:35] that now we're going to ask somebody
[1:22:37] that's over here on this side of the
[1:22:38] horse what do you see and it's going to
[1:22:41] be entirely different than what they saw
[1:22:44] and then there's poor old Paul cuz I was
[1:22:46] late to the show I'm looking at the
[1:22:50] tail and you know what your doctor about
[1:22:52] that horse head is not my Doctrine cuz
[1:22:55] there is no horse head on this end of
[1:22:57] the
[1:22:58] horse there is a big fat rump with a
[1:23:02] tail amen that's what I
[1:23:06] see same
[1:23:08] horse but we get so caught up in what we
[1:23:11] see and how we see it that it must be
[1:23:13] the way I see it it's the same
[1:23:17] horse and if you shift your position
[1:23:21] you'll have a different vision
[1:23:23] or if the horse shifts to a different
[1:23:25] position you have a different Vision
[1:23:27] same horse now look at us around the
[1:23:31] message fussing over I see this I don't
[1:23:35] see that I don't know where he's coming
[1:23:37] from that's not what I
[1:23:39] see come on let's have enough Grace for
[1:23:42] one another to say you know Lord maybe I
[1:23:44] need to look at this from a different
[1:23:46] point of view maybe I will see I'm not
[1:23:48] talking about false doctrines and lying
[1:23:51] Spirits I'm talking about good good
[1:23:52] people living Godly lives looking at the
[1:23:55] word and we're judging them because we
[1:23:57] don't see what they see or they don't
[1:23:59] see what we see and it's there that we
[1:24:01] need to stop sometimes and say is this
[1:24:03] not the same God that called you is the
[1:24:06] same God that called them is this not
[1:24:09] the same vision of making a Rapture and
[1:24:11] standing in the presence of God that
[1:24:13] they have that I have and if we would
[1:24:16] have a little more grace for one another
[1:24:18] but stay totally on the word amen I'm
[1:24:22] not talking about
[1:24:25] compromise I'm talking about as it were
[1:24:29] pardon me tying this back to analogy I
[1:24:31] can walk up and I can lay it's not very
[1:24:33] smart actually if you're a horse person
[1:24:35] you know you don't go up and put your
[1:24:37] hand on a horse's rump from behind
[1:24:40] because they have this
[1:24:42] mechanism and you don't want to
[1:24:44] experience that but properly go I I can
[1:24:48] lay my hand on the horse brothers let's
[1:24:50] come together I I can lay my hand it's a
[1:24:52] horse it's a horse it's a horse it's a
[1:24:57] horse we don't argue that it's the
[1:25:01] word but our argument sometimes is
[1:25:04] Anointed of the devil about how we see
[1:25:06] the word it's still the same word are
[1:25:10] you guys able to handle that amen see
[1:25:14] what the devil's trying to do is he's
[1:25:16] coming here the scripture says trying to
[1:25:18] drive a wedge in the body of Believers
[1:25:21] he's trying to drive have a wedge
[1:25:23] amongst it and my brother and sister we
[1:25:25] were taught if you're eating the Cherry
[1:25:29] Pie I draw I always draw my wife into
[1:25:32] this sorry about this folks but you know
[1:25:34] few years ago we had a little Cherry
[1:25:36] Pitter thing there and the cherries were
[1:25:37] extremely small and Paul was pitting
[1:25:41] cherries and Paul wanted to be done with
[1:25:43] this job Paul is pitting cherries
[1:25:44] there's so many cherries I'm tired of
[1:25:46] pitting cherries and I quit really
[1:25:48] looking about what I was actually
[1:25:51] doing
[1:25:53] and
[1:25:54] then down the road ways my wife makes a
[1:25:57] cherry
[1:25:58] pie and I first piece out of the
[1:26:03] pie
[1:26:06] pit second bite out of the
[1:26:08] pie
[1:26:10] pit I think there was like 20 pits in
[1:26:13] one piece of
[1:26:15] pie now get this how we are as Believers
[1:26:19] sometimes
[1:26:21] Jerry what did you do with this
[1:26:24] pie she sits there for a
[1:26:27] moment you pitted the
[1:26:35] cherries I just have a hard time
[1:26:37] admitting this is my
[1:26:39] fault it surely is the one who made the
[1:26:42] Pie's fault she she should have
[1:26:46] known their husband was incompetent at
[1:26:49] pitting
[1:26:50] cherries but but you see my brother and
[1:26:53] sister how the Devil comes
[1:26:55] in I hope you all love me when I'm done
[1:26:58] with this
[1:26:59] statement we just didn't have a very
[1:27:01] good service
[1:27:03] today I wonder what the deal was with
[1:27:05] the
[1:27:10] pastor do a better job of pitting your
[1:27:13] cherries yes
[1:27:15] sir do a better job of
[1:27:17] praying before you come to church bring
[1:27:21] a different atmosphere spere to
[1:27:24] church come on you guys don't want me to
[1:27:26] be the atmosphere
[1:27:28] police amen hallelujah I don't like the
[1:27:31] way you're slouched bad attitude here
[1:27:33] I'm in different Spirit here you just no
[1:27:36] no that's not what it's about it's what
[1:27:37] the holy spirit's doing in our life it's
[1:27:41] God speaking to
[1:27:43] you it's not Paul speaking to you it's
[1:27:46] what God is speaking to you and what we
[1:27:49] bring to church is not the evidence of
[1:27:51] the priest preacher my brother and
[1:27:53] sister what we bring to church is the
[1:27:55] evidence of you pitting your
[1:27:59] cherries don't want pits in your
[1:28:02] pie want the holy spirit in church
[1:28:05] service amen we have to give our
[1:28:08] part
[1:28:10] amen you know Sister
[1:28:13] Jerry she handled that quite well didn't
[1:28:16] she I told her what do we do about it I
[1:28:20] hope you catch my thought here
[1:28:22] she said you can go back through and
[1:28:24] repit every single Cherry no I'll pick
[1:28:26] them out of the pie that's all right
[1:28:28] I'll just pick them out of the pie you
[1:28:30] see often times we actually come to that
[1:28:35] position what I should have took care of
[1:28:39] here we
[1:28:41] choose to just kick the
[1:28:44] can down the
[1:28:46] road I know I made a bad decision I
[1:28:49] could fix
[1:28:51] it I'll fix it
[1:28:54] later now who does that
[1:28:59] influence I don't want to point it at
[1:29:04] You me pushing it down the road and not
[1:29:07] dealing with
[1:29:08] it doesn't just impact
[1:29:12] me it impacts every one of
[1:29:16] you we come to
[1:29:19] church with an attitude
[1:29:24] with things in our lives thinking it's
[1:29:27] just my problem it's
[1:29:31] not it changes the whole
[1:29:33] atmosphere Lord help us are you all
[1:29:35] still in love with
[1:29:37] me is that okay come on it's time for us
[1:29:41] Saints to step out of our old position
[1:29:45] to step into the word and say you know
[1:29:47] what I know a way to deal with this I
[1:29:49] know a way to come to the house of God
[1:29:51] with my fire burning I know a way to
[1:29:54] come into the house of God and be a
[1:29:55] contributor something that will change
[1:29:57] the lives of those around me my
[1:29:59] neighbors on each side and behind and
[1:30:02] whatever is the scripture says that when
[1:30:04] we're I'm interpreting this here when
[1:30:06] we're in our right position it even
[1:30:09] makes our enemies our
[1:30:11] friends that's quite a thing in the
[1:30:14] world we live in today my brother and
[1:30:15] sister to be able to have an atmosphere
[1:30:18] of the holy spirit that will even change
[1:30:20] the atmosphere of people who think they
[1:30:23] don't like you and contain that amen are
[1:30:28] we called the
[1:30:30] chaos we are not called to chaos now
[1:30:33] we're called we're going to have battles
[1:30:36] come on I want you to see the difference
[1:30:37] between you having a battle and you
[1:30:39] living in
[1:30:41] chaos amen there's a lot of difference
[1:30:44] amen how many of
[1:30:46] you would want to end
[1:30:50] job any volunteers to be
[1:30:54] job man we're sure timid this morning
[1:30:57] aren't
[1:31:00] we but see God never even gave job any
[1:31:03] warning God goes over here and opens a
[1:31:06] hedge and job finds
[1:31:09] himself camels stolen oxen stolen
[1:31:13] donkeys stolen sheep stolen children
[1:31:17] crushed and everybody's like you got
[1:31:20] secret sin job
[1:31:22] what would the world say
[1:31:26] today with our hedge
[1:31:29] open boy sure seems like brother so and
[1:31:32] so are that family
[1:31:35] struggling am I getting too close to
[1:31:37] home am I digging too
[1:31:43] deep and it won't do you any good
[1:31:46] remember brother juel that time was
[1:31:47] preaching on patience then he makes a
[1:31:50] statement no no no no no I don't pray
[1:31:53] for
[1:31:55] patience I told him after the service
[1:31:58] brother juel it don't matter whether you
[1:32:00] pray for patience or not God's going to
[1:32:02] give it to you sister Vanessa is like bu
[1:32:05] Paul don't say
[1:32:07] that too late too late because God's
[1:32:10] going to give us patience and do you
[1:32:15] realize well praise God not one of us
[1:32:17] said we wanted God to open the Hedge but
[1:32:20] do you realize it's
[1:32:23] open the Hedge is
[1:32:26] open Satan has full access to assault
[1:32:32] you you know why that you are who you
[1:32:37] are is because when God opened the Hedge
[1:32:40] he already knew what he put in you just
[1:32:44] like job he already poured his Spirit
[1:32:47] into you Satan's doing everything come
[1:32:49] on we know this don't we things that
[1:32:52] happen in life we know Satan's trying to
[1:32:55] destroy us trying to trip us trying to
[1:32:57] knock us down now the word of God I need
[1:32:59] to shorten this but the word of God has
[1:33:02] given us a promise my brother and sister
[1:33:04] why don't we forget about what Satan's
[1:33:06] trying to do out here and step out in
[1:33:09] the promise step out in what God
[1:33:11] promised to you and I he said I've
[1:33:13] sealed you with the holy spirit amen I
[1:33:16] I've made a way for you I believe that's
[1:33:19] like I don't know is it Ezekiel 6
[1:33:21] talking about going into the City and
[1:33:23] destroying everything but yet he says
[1:33:26] stop until we seal every True
[1:33:31] Believer and then when they're sealed
[1:33:34] you can
[1:33:36] destroy you realize what God's done he
[1:33:39] sealed you against the
[1:33:43] Judgment does that make you perfect no
[1:33:46] nothing's perfect but Christ but you see
[1:33:48] when he poured the Holy Ghost into you
[1:33:50] he sealed you to the day of your
[1:33:53] Redemption Can someone say thank you
[1:33:54] Lord amen we're sealed to the day of our
[1:33:57] Redemption every destructive judgmental
[1:34:00] spirit and evil spirit out here can't
[1:34:02] touch you because you've been sealed
[1:34:04] amen hallelujah I'm going to cut my
[1:34:06] sermon a little short here I believe
[1:34:07] we've been long enough amen praise God
[1:34:11] so I just want to read a couple very
[1:34:13] quick they're just very very short amen
[1:34:17] now look at this so flashing red light
[1:34:20] of the sign of his coming
[1:34:22] now if this sounds old and fogy now we
[1:34:25] know that's the term most of you
[1:34:26] wouldn't be using today to somebody
[1:34:28] check back a few years and look what's
[1:34:30] going on now and then imagine a future
[1:34:32] there's no future but the coming of the
[1:34:34] Lord now when I was a boy my brother and
[1:34:36] sister we would ride bicycles from the
[1:34:39] farm all the way to
[1:34:41] town never fear our parents didn't chew
[1:34:44] their fingernails of somebody kidnapping
[1:34:46] our
[1:34:47] children but we live in a present world
[1:34:49] right now where destructive forces are
[1:34:52] everywhere we look at a time I'll put it
[1:34:54] out like this we look at a time that
[1:34:56] when brother brandom spoke about America
[1:34:59] being bankrupt nobody belied that but
[1:35:03] look at our nation right now look at it
[1:35:06] right now you know I I don't recommend
[1:35:08] you do this I almost broke in tears the
[1:35:10] other day I went on the computer and
[1:35:11] looked at the debt
[1:35:13] clock and more money than I'll make in
[1:35:15] my whole lifetime flashed across that
[1:35:18] screen just about that
[1:35:20] long everything I could possibly make in
[1:35:23] my life has become a debt in about 10
[1:35:28] seconds
[1:35:30] trillions it's no longer what our
[1:35:32] children can repay they'll never pay the
[1:35:35] debt but look at this manifestation if I
[1:35:38] could spiritualize this we were in debt
[1:35:41] we could never pay but the coming of the
[1:35:44] Lord Jesus wiped our debt away he became
[1:35:48] sin so that we could become him in
[1:35:52] righteousness Hallelujah aren't you
[1:35:54] excited about that my debt wiped out
[1:35:57] even faster than Satan could wind my
[1:36:00] debt up God eliminated it I say thank
[1:36:04] you Lord praise the Lord today
[1:36:06] hallelujah thank you thank you Lord now
[1:36:09] look one more little short quote I know
[1:36:12] that's
[1:36:13] hard I'm not here to baby you or make
[1:36:16] you laugh or make you shout I'm here to
[1:36:18] tell you the truth in God and you'll see
[1:36:20] someday if you don't believe it now
[1:36:22] someday will come when you'll say that
[1:36:24] was right true you got to get back amen
[1:36:28] he's talking about how Revival they're
[1:36:31] trying to create
[1:36:34] Revival and he says they're trying to
[1:36:36] get
[1:36:39] back brother Brown's talking about in a
[1:36:42] different
[1:36:43] angle get
[1:36:44] back let's get back okay let's quit
[1:36:47] playing Church let's quit having a
[1:36:50] emotional this and conflict there and
[1:36:53] misunderstanding there and offense over
[1:36:56] here let's get back to the word let's
[1:36:57] get back to Christ let's get back to the
[1:37:00] point that it makes a difference in our
[1:37:01] lives my brother and sister not just
[1:37:03] sitting here this whole thing the whole
[1:37:06] thing is in this condition there's
[1:37:08] nothing left for it to come but the
[1:37:10] coming of the Lord Jesus and he won't
[1:37:11] come for Assembly of God he won't come
[1:37:13] for Baptist he'll come for each
[1:37:17] individualise Lord now the point that he
[1:37:19] named out different churches that's not
[1:37:22] really the point he's telling us it's
[1:37:24] not about because I belong here and it's
[1:37:25] not about because I belong there it's
[1:37:27] about who you are and where you belong
[1:37:29] aren't you glad we belong to Jesus
[1:37:31] Christ today I tell you church I want to
[1:37:34] encourage each one of us every one of us
[1:37:36] let's step out in faith and let's come
[1:37:39] to a little higher calling and to a
[1:37:41] little higher position in Jesus Christ
[1:37:43] let's tell ourselves and believe it I'm
[1:37:46] no longer going to live at the level
[1:37:48] I've been living I'm ready to move up
[1:37:51] I'm ready to move out amen I'm ready to
[1:37:53] move on Amen into the presence of
[1:37:56] almighty God cuz I'm telling you it's
[1:37:58] going to take more than just
[1:38:00] average Christian faith to make a
[1:38:05] Rapture it takes rapturing Faith yes
[1:38:08] rapturing Faith doesn't just come
[1:38:11] because you pick your Bible up every so
[1:38:13] often and read it it comes from when you
[1:38:17] immerse yourself in the word of God amen
[1:38:21] immerse our lives in
[1:38:25] Christ Hallelujah I think I'll just stop
[1:38:28] right there amen if our musicians would
[1:38:33] come is it good to be a Christian today
[1:38:36] amen
[1:38:38] amen you know I don't think that well I
[1:38:40] know for a fact nothing wrong with
[1:38:43] getting people to
[1:38:45] laugh amen nothing wrong with getting
[1:38:48] people to
[1:38:49] shout but we need the the truth amen we
[1:38:53] don't need to be
[1:38:54] humored we don't need to have a comedian
[1:38:56] for a
[1:38:57] pastor we need to have the word we need
[1:39:00] a life that's something solid we can
[1:39:03] hook onto I think I shared with you I I
[1:39:05] I kind of got caught up in looking to
[1:39:07] things about
[1:39:08] Everest and um you know quite quite
[1:39:12] interesting because there's this Zone in
[1:39:14] Everest that they call the I forget now
[1:39:16] The Killing Zone or death zone and and
[1:39:19] you know people can a lot L of people
[1:39:21] can make it to that
[1:39:25] point a lot of people make it that
[1:39:28] point but of the percentage that start
[1:39:32] those that actually make it to the
[1:39:34] summit it's quite small percentage and
[1:39:36] what struck me was like that's that's a
[1:39:38] Christian
[1:39:39] experience there comes a point in time
[1:39:42] that we have to die to
[1:39:43] ourself to get any
[1:39:47] further and very
[1:39:50] few
[1:39:52] Summit Lord help us in that article I
[1:39:56] was looking at you know climate change
[1:39:59] has come to Mount Everest
[1:40:02] also snow has melted different storms
[1:40:05] have blowed in different Fashions and
[1:40:07] literally not far from the summit on
[1:40:10] Mount Everest is this gradual slope that
[1:40:13] is deceiving because it goes off and
[1:40:15] keeps falling away at the point you
[1:40:18] can't climb back
[1:40:19] up
[1:40:21] and it's littered with dead
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:26] bodies I know that's a little
[1:40:30] graphic you'll have forgotten about it
[1:40:32] by the time you eat lunch
[1:40:38] today the word of God shows
[1:40:41] us we can't enter into the presence of
[1:40:45] God unless we're
[1:40:48] prepared and almost every one of those
[1:40:51] individuals either had no oxygen or ran
[1:40:55] out of
[1:40:56] oxygen and they couldn't exist in that
[1:41:00] atmosphere I'm telling you Saints God is
[1:41:03] bringing us to a place as Sons and
[1:41:05] Daughters of God place of rapturing
[1:41:08] faith we can't do it on our own we need
[1:41:12] the Holy Ghost we need Christ every
[1:41:16] fiber of our being we need Christ or we
[1:41:19] will be like those people who tried to
[1:41:22] climb the mountain believe they were
[1:41:24] capable on their
[1:41:26] own I pray God would just deal with our
[1:41:29] hearts and let us just see who we really
[1:41:32] are and the fact that when we step out
[1:41:35] in faith it needs to be real faith not
[1:41:39] our idea of Faith or what someone said
[1:41:41] have faith but we need to know where our
[1:41:45] faith is anchored let it be anchored in
[1:41:48] Jesus Christ can we say amen amen
[1:41:51] hallelujah amen we'll sing a song or two
[1:41:55] I got a little itch in the back of my
[1:41:57] throat just probably ask brother Alex
[1:42:00] here to just come and help me amen let's
[1:42:03] just stand and sing a new creation
[1:42:06] Hallelujah are you a new creation today
[1:42:09] Hallelujah I know I am amen by God's
[1:42:13] grace Hallelujah that we're we're not
[1:42:16] the old man we're not going to try and
[1:42:18] do this on our own well let me just put
[1:42:20] it this way I I'll just a moment of
[1:42:23] transparency I
[1:42:25] fail so
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:29] often sometimes I feel the revelation of
[1:42:32] my failure is more real to me than the
[1:42:34] revelation of the
[1:42:36] word do you follow
[1:42:39] me we come face to face with our failure
[1:42:42] over and over and over again but I tell
[1:42:46] you my brother and sister the failure of
[1:42:47] the flesh is the
[1:42:49] revelation of
[1:42:52] Christ that seems a little to struggle
[1:42:54] right the failure of our flesh is the
[1:42:56] revelation of Jesus Christ because
[1:42:58] you're not standing here this morning in
[1:43:01] your flesh you're standing here in the
[1:43:04] revelation of Jesus Christ otherwise we
[1:43:07] wouldn't be here otherwise we wouldn't
[1:43:09] be standing in this hour otherwise we
[1:43:11] couldn't make it to tomorrow but with
[1:43:14] Christ in US amen we're going to make it
[1:43:19] Hallelujah
[1:43:24] Hallelujah he redeemed me can you sing
[1:43:28] this as a
