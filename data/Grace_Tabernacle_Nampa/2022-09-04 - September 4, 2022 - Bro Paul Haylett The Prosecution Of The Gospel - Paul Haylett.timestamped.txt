[42:02] amen also want to greet brother Mike
[42:04] sister Kimberly brother Mitch sister
[42:07] Naomi
[42:09] um you know sometimes Saints oh I don't
[42:12] want to get all gushy here you know and
[42:14] stuff but sometimes you just run into
[42:16] people that
[42:18] if you didn't know better you'd say I've
[42:20] known them forever
[42:22] and they're such a kindred spirit there
[42:24] that you just feel instantly attracted
[42:27] and I just have to say you can pay me
[42:29] later brother Mike but I just have to
[42:32] say when we met brother Mike sister
[42:34] Kimberly sister Naomi and brother Mitch
[42:36] it was just like
[42:38] I feel like I've known these and maybe I
[42:40] did before the foundation from the
[42:42] foundation of the world but just lovely
[42:44] lovely and glad to have them here and we
[42:49] all attended a wedding last night just a
[42:53] lovely time
[42:56] young couple married in a cow pasture
[43:00] and with all the amenities of a cow
[43:02] pasture
[43:03] and but still a lovely time
[43:06] I'm thankful that that they got married
[43:09] so that
[43:11] this family would come and visit us and
[43:13] just uh beautiful
[43:14] and uh
[43:16] last but not least
[43:18] my lovely niece Ruth
[43:21] amen just
[43:23] happy brother Jeremiah and their cute
[43:26] little guy Obadiah just happy they've
[43:29] flown down from Alaska to just spend a
[43:32] oh I could just start kind of a family
[43:35] fight by saying I'm glad they visited
[43:37] God's country
[43:39] but my dear niece Ruth is pretty
[43:42] defensive about Alaska and I'm sure
[43:44] brother Jeremiah is right behind her and
[43:47] they're already taking that little guy
[43:49] mountain biking and mountain climbing
[43:51] and I think probably that there's no
[43:54] hope for him
[43:55] but uh we're just so happy to have you
[43:57] here with us and
[43:59] is it good to be in the house of the
[44:01] Lord today Hallelujah well I I just want
[44:05] to
[44:06] give you a almost controversial title
[44:09] this morning you'll have to just be
[44:11] patient with brother Paul we want to
[44:14] talk about our position of strength you
[44:15] see my brother and sister now we're not
[44:18] contradicting scripture to say God has
[44:21] given us a position of strength he says
[44:23] when you are weak I am strong but you
[44:26] see in him we are strong
[44:28] in him we have the strength to overcome
[44:31] every challenge thank you uh beautiful
[44:33] song service the special song I just
[44:36] love that that was beautiful
[44:37] God has given us everything we need
[44:39] right the prophet of God to paraphrase
[44:41] that said everything you need for the
[44:43] Rapture is already in you so God has
[44:47] already given us a preparation right we
[44:50] don't have to say oh I've got to run out
[44:51] here and get prepared what we've got to
[44:53] do is take what God's already provided
[44:55] and he is through his word provided
[44:58] everything we need we we don't need to
[45:00] come out and and say well we got to
[45:02] start this and got to think this through
[45:04] and you know no my brother and sister we
[45:06] just need to rely on the Lord and trust
[45:09] him and just uh let that come to pass in
[45:12] our life I want to speak to you this
[45:15] morning on the prosecution of the Gospel
[45:20] now some of you are going to take that
[45:22] and say wow we've put the gospel on
[45:24] trial or something here but
[45:27] sometimes there's definitions in words
[45:29] that we don't commonly use or recognize
[45:31] and
[45:32] so if you'll bear with me we'll just
[45:35] kind of talk a little bit on the
[45:37] prosecution and persecution this morning
[45:40] if you will turn in your Bibles to
[45:42] Second Corinthians the fourth chapter
[45:45] verses 1 through 13 is where we'll take
[45:48] our text this morning and uh in that we
[45:52] will then take uh and build on this
[45:57] prosecution of the Gospel amen
[46:04] now as Paul's speaking to the
[46:05] Corinthians
[46:07] he doesn't mince any words
[46:10] but you know these words that he speaks
[46:13] were not for them only but it was for
[46:15] our day it was for our admonition it was
[46:17] for the strengthening of the body of
[46:19] Believers in the day that we live in and
[46:22] so in this we we just take these
[46:24] scriptures to Heart
[46:26] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[46:28] as we have received Mercy we faint not
[46:33] but we have renounced the hidden things
[46:35] of dishonesty not walking in craftiness
[46:39] nor handling the word of God deceitfully
[46:43] but by manifestation of the faith
[46:45] commending ourselves to Every Man's
[46:47] conscience in the sight of God
[46:51] isn't it good we can all live at our own
[46:53] standard
[46:55] but as a Christian Desiring to live the
[46:57] Gospel of Jesus Christ we actually put
[47:01] our own life on trial
[47:03] in front of those around us
[47:07] in other words I don't want to be as it
[47:09] were a secret Christian
[47:11] I want my life to testify God is alive
[47:15] and well today the gospel is living it's
[47:19] changing lives it is our life
[47:22] amen
[47:25] but if our gospel beheaded it is hid to
[47:27] them that are lost
[47:29] in whom the God of this world hath
[47:32] blinded the minds of them which believe
[47:34] not lest the light of the Glorious
[47:37] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[47:40] should shine unto them for we preach not
[47:43] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[47:46] ourselves your servants for Jesus sake I
[47:49] love this just in a conversation a few
[47:51] days ago
[47:52] where is it my brother and sister God
[47:55] and placed Ministry in the scripture
[47:58] placed them in a very high position and
[48:01] then said you're now their servant
[48:05] my ruler
[48:08] in control
[48:10] to be the chief servant
[48:13] not to Lord over God's people
[48:16] but to actually be servants to God's
[48:19] people
[48:20] very humbling the minute you start to
[48:22] think you're important
[48:23] realize you're just the chief of the
[48:26] servants
[48:27] my oh my
[48:29] yeah
[48:31] for God who commanded the light to shine
[48:33] out of Darkness has shined in our hearts
[48:36] can we say Amen to give lie to the
[48:38] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[48:40] face of Jesus Christ but we have this
[48:44] treasure in Earthen vessels the
[48:46] Excellency of the power may be of God
[48:49] and not of us
[48:51] we are troubled on every side yet not
[48:54] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[48:58] despair persecuted
[49:00] but not forsaken cast down but not
[49:03] destroyed
[49:06] oh my
[49:08] my oh my
[49:10] amen
[49:12] I'm going to open the Hedge
[49:14] job didn't know nothing about it
[49:16] but God had no fear
[49:19] because he knew it wasn't job inside the
[49:21] Hedge he knew it was him in job
[49:25] and so he tells them you can do
[49:27] everything you want to job now get this
[49:30] there's a deeper connection here you can
[49:32] do everything you want to do to job but
[49:35] you can't take his life and Satan knew
[49:38] what God was speaking he knew the
[49:40] language and knew in the connection at
[49:42] the coming of the son of man he would
[49:44] try to take his life but he couldn't
[49:46] take his life and so God plays this out
[49:49] in job in the beginning and says you can
[49:51] do anything you want to
[49:53] but you can't take his life now we often
[49:56] read that now I'm not trying to change
[49:58] anything but we often read that as like
[50:01] a commandment of you you can't go to the
[50:04] position of taking his life
[50:06] or we can read this that God made a
[50:08] declaration to the devil and said you
[50:11] can't
[50:12] take his life
[50:16] now we're going to take that any way we
[50:18] please right some would say well that's
[50:20] your view on that Paul I choose to take
[50:22] it that way my brother and sister do you
[50:24] realize that we look in the flesh
[50:27] and we say oh my oh my someone has
[50:30] passed or sister Solas past
[50:32] our hearts are heavy their hearts are
[50:34] heavy satin but do you realize according
[50:37] to the scripture Satan never took her
[50:39] life
[50:43] yeah can't take your life either
[50:48] well I was going to stop but I read past
[50:50] my little check mark that I had to stop
[50:52] so we'll just go ahead and read
[50:54] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[50:57] but not destroyed
[50:58] always bearing about in the body dying
[51:01] of the Lord Jesus that the life also of
[51:03] Jesus might be made manifest in our body
[51:06] for which we which live are always
[51:10] delivered unto death for Jesus sake that
[51:12] the life also of Jesus may be made
[51:14] manifest in our mortal flesh now when
[51:17] you read this scripture I don't mean to
[51:18] keep you but I just when you read this
[51:21] my brother and sister those two
[51:22] scriptures back to back are talking
[51:25] about one in our body in our body right
[51:28] internal
[51:30] and one is about our mortal flesh
[51:33] external
[51:34] so when people have an idea that I can
[51:37] serve God and my soul be saved but my
[51:39] body can yield to the world they are
[51:42] confused my brother and sister God's
[51:43] dealing with the inside and the outside
[51:45] amen he doesn't give us a place to just
[51:48] go immerse ourselves in sin because well
[51:50] he's going to save my soul no my brother
[51:52] and sister the internal and the external
[51:55] so then death worketh in us but life in
[51:58] you
[51:59] we having the spirit of faith
[52:02] according as it is written I believed
[52:06] therefore have I spoken we also believe
[52:09] and therefore speak
[52:12] what is it we will speak what we believe
[52:15] we're claiming healing this morning for
[52:18] our sister
[52:19] amen because that's what we believe God
[52:22] Is A Healer amen if we believe he's a
[52:25] Healer then we can only speak for
[52:26] healing
[52:27] now we put a caveat to that you might
[52:30] say by Lord thy will be done
[52:32] but we must speak what we believe let's
[52:36] just go before the Lord Heavenly Father
[52:38] we ask you this morning Lord just may
[52:40] this be a glorious time to be in the
[52:42] house of God
[52:43] Lord the life Lord that you have given
[52:46] us Lord if we look to the external
[52:48] outside father we see all kinds of
[52:50] politics and Corruptions and all kinds
[52:53] of evil speakings and doings but Lord
[52:56] we're here Lord we're here wrapped in
[52:59] this in the presence of our God lord
[53:02] we're not looking to what's happening as
[53:04] it were in the world but we're looking
[53:05] to what's happening in this body of
[53:07] Believers that's the scripture calls the
[53:09] bride of Christ Lord we're looking to
[53:11] what you're doing in this hour the great
[53:13] work father that's coming down lord the
[53:16] laying in the presence of the son that
[53:18] we would be ready and ripe Lord just to
[53:20] be in a position Lord that we wouldn't
[53:22] have to be afraid of hearing behold the
[53:25] bridegroom cometh but Lord that we could
[53:27] live ready O Lord help us to live ready
[53:30] help us father to be filled with the oil
[53:33] father of your holy spirit that we can
[53:36] come and rise and shine in the day that
[53:38] you called us to bless this time today I
[53:40] pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen it
[53:44] may be seated
[53:55] I just want to drop back for just a
[53:57] moment on a couple scriptures here of
[53:59] verse 4 then whom the God of this world
[54:01] hath blinded the minds of them which
[54:03] believe not lest the light of the
[54:05] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[54:08] image of God should shine unto them and
[54:10] my brother and sister I love how God
[54:13] lays this out he's not excluding anyone
[54:16] but you have to be a believer we cannot
[54:18] just kind of be a fence straddling type
[54:21] of a Christian that we think that maybe
[54:23] over here science said this I believe it
[54:26] was brother Mitch in a conversation said
[54:28] uh you know that science is always right
[54:33] now some of you would say whoa just a
[54:35] second but I agree with brother Mitch
[54:38] science is always right they're just not
[54:40] looking at the facts correctly
[54:43] so when they say they find And when they
[54:45] see and this come from whatever we have
[54:47] these evidences my brother and sister
[54:49] God left that behind but it's there my
[54:52] brother and sister that unless it is
[54:54] interpreted correctly viewed correctly
[54:57] and I want to bring that the reason I
[54:59] brought that up uh was to say if we do
[55:02] not look at the Bible today correctly
[55:05] we'll find that God had provided a way
[55:08] for mankind now this could be a
[55:10] controversial statement to some but God
[55:13] wrote the word of God had it written in
[55:16] such a fashion that it will defend
[55:18] anything you want to defend
[55:21] and the message of the hour came and
[55:23] people can defend anything they want to
[55:26] defend but you see when the light of the
[55:29] Gospel Shines on a son or daughter of
[55:31] God they will see it God's way every
[55:33] time we don't need a new gospel we don't
[55:36] need a new interpretation we just need
[55:38] to have the Revelation or the presence
[55:40] of God in our life to anoint our eyes
[55:42] and our ears and our understanding to
[55:44] see it God's way and so as we come into
[55:47] this it's not that we really need to be
[55:49] educated we need to grasp things in a
[55:52] certain fashion to see the Bible I
[55:54] remember one time watching a little deal
[55:56] on the internet and this man was making
[55:59] an assurance to the people that until we
[56:03] have the original translations of the
[56:06] Hebrew and the Greek we'll never
[56:07] understand God and I thought my old man
[56:10] that guy just set himself up to never
[56:13] understand God
[56:15] you know it's it's such an interesting
[56:18] thing that we can look for proof but
[56:20] what is proof
[56:23] right there's an intrinsic value in
[56:26] truth but how do we mind that value
[56:28] because we only can take truth or
[56:31] analysis of Truth back to the point of
[56:34] what we believe is the foundation so
[56:36] it's there if we miss the foundation
[56:38] then we've missed truth but I'll tell
[56:40] you what God does he comes by anointing
[56:42] of the Holy Ghost because he promises in
[56:44] his word and said I will reveal it to
[56:46] who I'm paraphrase this reveal it to who
[56:49] I will reveal it to and when I reveal it
[56:51] to them then they will know my mind and
[56:53] they'll know my spirit and they'll know
[56:55] my nature amen oh let us not go to a
[56:58] book to find god let's go to his
[57:00] presence and cry out cry out his name
[57:03] and come into that present and not even
[57:05] come in as Beggars my brother and sister
[57:07] but come in as Sons and Daughters of God
[57:10] boldly to the throne of God lord I want
[57:13] to understand you I want to know you and
[57:16] I want to be a participant as it were of
[57:19] the unfolding of the word for the day
[57:21] that I was called to live in amen and so
[57:25] we look here and realize now I want to
[57:27] take this the God of this world so we
[57:29] see uh uh later you know as we look at
[57:31] this the God of this evil age my brother
[57:34] and sister we're seeing the scriptures
[57:35] so clearly says there's a God little G
[57:38] of this world that is not uh Jesus
[57:41] Christ it's not the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:43] it's not all of those names uh
[57:46] Redemptive names of God it doesn't fit
[57:49] in it's another God and my brother and
[57:51] sisters there's people I say today
[57:53] everyone on the face of the earth is
[57:55] serving God today
[57:58] it all depends on who your God is
[58:03] now that's kind of scary to the poor
[58:05] people that don't believe there's a God
[58:07] because then they're not even serving or
[58:09] thinking they're serving the god that
[58:10] they're actually serving
[58:17] now it's one thing my brother and sister
[58:19] to look anyone ever been persecuted
[58:23] you know
[58:24] there's a little 13 year old boy I
[58:26] didn't know the teacher actually wrote
[58:27] things on the chalkboard I just thought
[58:29] they stood up there and waved their arms
[58:32] and in one stroke of a visit to get a
[58:34] driver's license
[58:36] I become a four eyes
[58:39] and for years I went to high school with
[58:41] kids that reminded me
[58:44] you might be better now Paul but you're
[58:46] still four eyes
[58:48] and then by irony I meet them 20 years
[58:51] later and they're wearing glasses
[58:55] but you see little things that convex
[58:57] the soul and Vex our life and that's
[58:59] just a little just a little smattering
[59:01] of that Satan comes my brother and
[59:03] sister and what he's doing is trying to
[59:06] persecute some people don't handle
[59:08] persecution very well you take certain
[59:10] personalities this is why we have to die
[59:12] in the flesh because certain
[59:14] personalities just don't take correction
[59:16] very well and you don't have to say Amen
[59:18] so it's there that it is that God works
[59:21] on us because whether you have that
[59:23] personality type or not does not matter
[59:25] because if God called you as a son or
[59:27] daughter of God he will deal with those
[59:30] physical mental social uh emotional
[59:33] attributes to bring you into the correct
[59:36] position
[59:37] but still we can acknowledge that that
[59:40] sometimes it is hard to take correction
[59:42] amen and so as you look at this we see
[59:45] that we can be persecuted but God said
[59:47] don't worry about it if you're
[59:49] persecuted I'm not going to forsake you
[59:50] in that time you'll face those
[59:52] persecutions you know my brother and
[59:54] sister oh I'll hold that for a little
[59:56] bit just getting ahead of myself amen
[59:59] now having the same Spirit of Faith
[1:00:01] verse 13.
[1:00:04] according as it is written now God is
[1:00:06] actually talking to a special class of
[1:00:08] people
[1:00:09] and some people say well we divide it by
[1:00:12] whether they're Baptist Nazarene
[1:00:13] methodists this that and the other no my
[1:00:15] brother and sister God doesn't care
[1:00:17] about those there's a man's names those
[1:00:18] are man's division those are man's ideas
[1:00:20] those are man's form of Separation but
[1:00:23] God here is speaking to a special class
[1:00:25] of people that having the same Spirit of
[1:00:28] faith
[1:00:29] come to a place that as it is written
[1:00:32] I believed it
[1:00:35] see they didn't have to go back and see
[1:00:37] what it meant in two or three different
[1:00:38] languages and and whatever they just
[1:00:40] believed what the word of God said and
[1:00:43] so by believing it that becomes their
[1:00:45] vocabulary that becomes as a term I like
[1:00:48] to use their verbiage that's how they
[1:00:51] speak my brother and sister now when we
[1:00:53] take this I'll just bring this back to
[1:00:55] our situation here with our sister uh my
[1:00:58] brother and sister we're not here to say
[1:01:00] well you know I don't know it sure
[1:01:02] sounds like she's going to die because
[1:01:04] she has all of these different things my
[1:01:07] Bible says my God Is A Healer and the
[1:01:10] only thing you're going to hear out of
[1:01:11] my mouth is God Is A Healer and I
[1:01:14] believe my sister is healed now I submit
[1:01:17] that to the perfect will of God that if
[1:01:19] she is ready to go and the Lord says I
[1:01:21] have called her home I don't want to be
[1:01:23] found resisting against God saying you
[1:01:25] can't do that but we have to come my
[1:01:27] brother and sister in faith
[1:01:30] because if we let doubt in have you ever
[1:01:33] met doubt
[1:01:34] yes did doubt ever stop which is whether
[1:01:38] the toaster is going to toast the toast
[1:01:41] no sir doubt will creep so far into your
[1:01:43] life that you're afraid to even go out
[1:01:46] the door
[1:01:48] afraid to function
[1:01:51] and then Satan takes that to church with
[1:01:52] you
[1:01:54] and you're afraid to act on the word of
[1:01:56] God because what if it doesn't happen
[1:02:00] I'll tell you this I might speak boldly
[1:02:02] this morning forgive me if it comes
[1:02:03] across strong but my brother and sister
[1:02:06] the devil
[1:02:07] we'll be tormenting those of sister
[1:02:09] solas's family why didn't God raise her
[1:02:12] up
[1:02:16] come on let's just face it let's don't
[1:02:18] try and hide these things
[1:02:20] someone will be having doubt whether God
[1:02:22] really cares or not but I'm telling you
[1:02:24] we ought to look at it God's way we're
[1:02:26] going to look at it what do we labor as
[1:02:28] Christians we labor all these years
[1:02:31] to make it to what
[1:02:35] Knob Hill
[1:02:37] no sir that's not our goal my brother
[1:02:40] and sister our goal is to come into the
[1:02:41] presence of God but yet we in the flesh
[1:02:44] because God placed such a desire for
[1:02:46] life in us that's the very thing that
[1:02:48] attracts you to the gospel is that
[1:02:50] desire for life and God put that desire
[1:02:53] so strong in us that the Devil Couldn't
[1:02:55] keep us away from the word of God but
[1:02:57] yet in the end that desire for life is
[1:03:00] so strong we don't want to see anybody
[1:03:01] die but God said when the season has
[1:03:04] come when the circumstances is right and
[1:03:06] they have fulfilled they've run the race
[1:03:08] and they've finished the race this is
[1:03:10] their time they've crossed their Finish
[1:03:12] Line
[1:03:14] and the devil then comes in and says now
[1:03:16] I have another Avenue to Satan but you
[1:03:19] prayed God would heal them
[1:03:21] you prayed God would save them
[1:03:24] what about it now
[1:03:26] well that's not my department God called
[1:03:28] me to do certain things
[1:03:30] he gave me certain responsibilities gave
[1:03:32] you certain responsibilities let's not
[1:03:34] try to fulfill God's job let's fulfill
[1:03:37] our own job that God called us to and
[1:03:39] God called us to be ready when the voice
[1:03:42] said behold the bridegroom cometh it's
[1:03:44] not to analyze every circumstance in the
[1:03:46] world around us but to trust God that he
[1:03:49] is truly in control
[1:03:51] and you'd be surprised at how big of a
[1:03:54] challenge that is
[1:03:55] for people let's let go and say I'm
[1:03:58] going to let God do what God wants to do
[1:04:00] it's a big challenge my brother and
[1:04:02] sister
[1:04:07] but do you know as we look at this that
[1:04:08] this is very reflective of the life of a
[1:04:10] believer
[1:04:12] this scripture right here
[1:04:14] very reflective
[1:04:16] of the life of a believer
[1:04:18] you see we I'll try not to go back so I
[1:04:20] don't keep you forever today
[1:04:22] you know it's just really hard
[1:04:24] brother Mike we were in our in our
[1:04:26] little bit of Fellowship he's like do
[1:04:28] you know First Cafeteria
[1:04:30] yeah I've been I've been to a First
[1:04:32] Cafeteria then brother Mike perceives to
[1:04:34] say you know it it's tastes just like
[1:04:36] cafeteria food
[1:04:38] oh we're out of potatoes let me get a
[1:04:40] can
[1:04:46] sometimes
[1:04:49] preachers are like cafeterias we got way
[1:04:52] more than you can eat
[1:04:55] and after the second or third plateful
[1:04:57] you've lost your appetite
[1:05:00] but that doesn't stop us from opening
[1:05:02] another can
[1:05:03] yeah
[1:05:06] now look at this what God is doing
[1:05:09] you see the word
[1:05:11] as we look in these verses we see the
[1:05:13] word is already working as I said about
[1:05:16] the flesh the internal external the word
[1:05:19] is already working my brother and sister
[1:05:21] and so it is that the word is already on
[1:05:24] display the words working on the inside
[1:05:25] and it is working to the outside that it
[1:05:28] is on display so here we are as
[1:05:30] Believers of the word of God we're
[1:05:32] standing on the Bible as our absolute
[1:05:34] and we are there and we say well you
[1:05:36] know I I feel bad it just seems like I'm
[1:05:39] not making much progress but then
[1:05:41] someone who hasn't seen you hasn't been
[1:05:44] around you for years goes my you're a
[1:05:46] different person than I remember
[1:05:49] what is Satan doing he's trying to
[1:05:51] manage your life by micro bits
[1:05:55] and you look at every single one of them
[1:05:57] and say I wished I'd have done better I
[1:05:58] wished I could have done better Lord
[1:06:00] forgive me I didn't
[1:06:01] but God's setting back saying my word is
[1:06:04] working mightily
[1:06:06] why because you are actually my brother
[1:06:08] and sister in the visible World
[1:06:11] surrounded by the God of this evil age
[1:06:14] constantly trying to block the light
[1:06:16] coming to you sometimes the light is
[1:06:19] blocked by our own actions but why did
[1:06:22] you have that action because there was a
[1:06:23] spirit of this age anointing you to take
[1:06:26] a certain route or to think a certain
[1:06:28] thought well I would even go to church
[1:06:30] because well I don't know my life is
[1:06:33] just not worthy I'm just got problems
[1:06:36] and I have this trouble in that trouble
[1:06:37] when I am a perfect person I'll go and
[1:06:40] just let God do his work well Hallelujah
[1:06:42] you ain't never going in the house of
[1:06:44] God ever again because you're never
[1:06:46] going to make it to flesh perfect
[1:06:49] so you look at this and realize what
[1:06:51] Satan's doing the attributes the effect
[1:06:54] that is happening but we see and I say
[1:06:57] let's take the word and the word says
[1:06:59] he's already working on the inside and
[1:07:01] the word says he's working on the
[1:07:03] outside and I'm going to say Amen today
[1:07:05] thank you Lord that your word is working
[1:07:08] amen hallelujah now you know we sing
[1:07:12] that song and it says on flowery beds of
[1:07:14] ease
[1:07:15] I always laugh when I hear a preacher
[1:07:17] say yeah some of you thought that when
[1:07:19] you got saved that was the end of your
[1:07:21] problems well what he should do is say
[1:07:23] every one of you fought
[1:07:25] not just somebody but every one of you
[1:07:28] thought when you became a Christian my
[1:07:31] problems are over I'm a Christian now no
[1:07:33] that was just the start of the battle
[1:07:35] you know it never takes much effort
[1:07:39] oh if I could do this hopefully it's not
[1:07:41] too random for you
[1:07:42] but did you know in the right place in
[1:07:44] the right time the right abilities you
[1:07:46] can kayak
[1:07:48] up the waterfall
[1:07:50] I've watched it happen
[1:07:53] there's a little swirl around a rock
[1:07:54] here and it looks to me like it's all
[1:07:56] going downhill but they know if they can
[1:07:58] bring their kayak here the force of that
[1:08:00] then forces their kayak to turn and as
[1:08:03] their kayak turns just a stroke of the
[1:08:06] paddle puts them on top of the water
[1:08:08] that's above that rock and then they can
[1:08:11] come and they can turn into the current
[1:08:13] and do that again and literally have
[1:08:15] seen video of them kayaking up a Rapids
[1:08:18] or a waterfall as it were my brother and
[1:08:21] sister the devil doesn't think you'll
[1:08:23] ever make it Upstream
[1:08:25] but God said I'll give you a technique
[1:08:27] I've given you an ability I'll give you
[1:08:30] discernment I've give you power to go
[1:08:33] Upstream against the spirits of the age
[1:08:35] that we live in and that makes you a
[1:08:37] rarity in the world today and I hope my
[1:08:40] visitor doesn't feel like I'm being too
[1:08:41] judgmental but my brother and sister
[1:08:43] most churches are preaching now hey God
[1:08:46] understands why you can't live this God
[1:08:49] understands no my brother and sister my
[1:08:52] God has empowered me and empowered you
[1:08:55] to go Upstream of the spirit of laodicea
[1:08:58] and to be an overcomer he isn't never
[1:09:01] going to say it's fine just go with the
[1:09:03] flow he's going to tell you I have made
[1:09:06] the way possible for you it's time for
[1:09:08] you to trust me and do as I direct you
[1:09:13] but it's too easy to say let's just go
[1:09:15] with the flow because God understands
[1:09:17] well my brother and sister when our
[1:09:19] understanding becomes in direct conflict
[1:09:21] with God's understanding we need to put
[1:09:24] our understanding down and say Lord I
[1:09:26] submit to your understanding I want to
[1:09:29] be Lord let your will be my will and my
[1:09:32] Will Be Your Will Lord that we can come
[1:09:34] and continue to press forward Amen to
[1:09:37] the mark of the High Calling
[1:09:39] High Calling is not Downstream
[1:09:42] High Calling is Upstream that means
[1:09:44] we're pushing we're having to exert even
[1:09:47] against the laws of nature
[1:09:55] yes
[1:09:59] now look
[1:10:00] I have a lot of respect for the devil
[1:10:03] I don't want anybody to misunderstand
[1:10:05] one must say this morning but have
[1:10:06] tremendous respect for the devil
[1:10:10] because the minute Saint said we get out
[1:10:12] from underneath the boat
[1:10:14] the devil's right there and The Wiles of
[1:10:17] the enemy
[1:10:19] will defeat Us in the flesh
[1:10:22] they'll never get to think the devil's
[1:10:23] there just to kick him around but
[1:10:25] getting ahead of myself I want you to
[1:10:28] make it a practice to kick him around
[1:10:30] while you respect him
[1:10:33] respect the authority as it were that he
[1:10:36] was given
[1:10:37] then anything that would bow to him is
[1:10:39] now under his authority
[1:10:41] oh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego my
[1:10:43] brother and sister look at all of those
[1:10:45] Jews that were there all of them that
[1:10:47] were acquainted with Daniel all of them
[1:10:48] that were acquainted and in the history
[1:10:50] of who they were had been carried down
[1:10:53] with him but in that they had went
[1:10:55] downstream so far that when it come time
[1:10:57] to Bow they didn't have a problem this
[1:11:00] after all is Daniel and he's our prophet
[1:11:05] we're not actually
[1:11:07] bowing down to their gods
[1:11:10] we're bowing down to a God we created
[1:11:13] for ourselves
[1:11:17] the devil's gotta the devil's got a job
[1:11:19] to do
[1:11:20] and you know he anoints labors to work
[1:11:23] for him
[1:11:26] and
[1:11:27] it's a shock to people
[1:11:29] that when some of those laborers appear
[1:11:31] to be very religious
[1:11:33] remember absolutely right
[1:11:36] but but but they they've done all these
[1:11:38] great works hence the words it says
[1:11:41] Lord have we not done many mighty works
[1:11:46] in thy name
[1:11:48] now God didn't say you're lying
[1:11:52] he did not say you're lying
[1:11:55] but you see their work that they were
[1:11:56] doing they were taking the power of God
[1:12:01] it's not even we'll touch on imitation
[1:12:03] in a minute but it's not even really
[1:12:04] through imitation
[1:12:06] but they themselves see coming God
[1:12:09] honoring faith God honoring the word god
[1:12:11] honoring promise
[1:12:14] but they just became a conduit
[1:12:17] you realize a minister standing in a
[1:12:18] pulpit's just a conduit
[1:12:21] but it's got to be a good conduit it's
[1:12:22] got to be a clean conduit it's got to be
[1:12:24] a worthy conduit it's going to be a god
[1:12:26] of proof conduit
[1:12:27] you can't be a man just born with a gift
[1:12:29] to speak
[1:12:31] and then say ah this is of God no my
[1:12:33] brother and sister God uses the lowly
[1:12:35] uses the ignorant to unlearn he uses
[1:12:37] those that spit and stumble he uses all
[1:12:40] these people but if they're a clean
[1:12:41] conduit then God can do Supernatural
[1:12:45] things through that
[1:12:51] so he anoints laborers to work for him
[1:12:53] and you realize that this is an
[1:12:54] imitation
[1:12:56] of the plan of God that's all Satan's
[1:12:59] doing his whole anointing of using
[1:13:01] people to work for him
[1:13:05] you see powerful things happen
[1:13:08] we won't go into this because I'll get
[1:13:09] myself in trouble
[1:13:11] but my brother and sister if you don't
[1:13:13] believe
[1:13:14] that there are certain anointings that
[1:13:16] come out here that Satan has put to work
[1:13:19] I could take you back to a certain
[1:13:20] musician
[1:13:22] not having having uh given all he could
[1:13:26] in this in this uh concert
[1:13:29] almost collapsing goes in the back room
[1:13:33] and he's sitting there
[1:13:35] and the drummer for this band starts
[1:13:37] playing this deal and it sounds like
[1:13:39] African jungle music
[1:13:41] and he starts beating away at this thing
[1:13:43] and as it's there my brother and sister
[1:13:45] you see this man
[1:13:47] who would have perverted many Souls with
[1:13:49] his music you see him there and you see
[1:13:52] him revitalized
[1:13:54] and it's there and a new Fresh anointing
[1:13:57] Falls and you see him get up and go back
[1:14:00] out and give almost as much in a a
[1:14:03] performance as he had before
[1:14:06] and we've seen old dry hided Christians
[1:14:09] I mean Believers that are just
[1:14:12] weary from well-doing
[1:14:15] and we'll see how God will come and
[1:14:17] bring a certain time and a place and His
[1:14:20] holy spirit will come down on people who
[1:14:22] are mentally and physically exhausted
[1:14:24] from the life that they're challenged
[1:14:26] here uh from all that they are assaulted
[1:14:29] with and they are coming to where
[1:14:31] they're coming to the house of God as
[1:14:33] more of a tradition a more of just I
[1:14:36] gotta do this I know I gotta do this but
[1:14:38] we'll see the Holy Spirit Come and move
[1:14:40] in our midst and we'll see them being
[1:14:42] revivalized and raised back up there's a
[1:14:45] spirit bringing that man to finish a
[1:14:48] concert and there's a spirit that's
[1:14:50] coming back in the church to raise up
[1:14:52] Sons and Daughters of God to finish this
[1:14:55] race to make it to the end do not stop
[1:14:58] from exhaustion and being too weary and
[1:15:01] clouded of the mind can you say Amen to
[1:15:03] that amen the devil wants to just get
[1:15:05] our mind so befuddled that we can't even
[1:15:08] think that we can't focus and it's there
[1:15:11] that he hopes he can come and trip you
[1:15:14] to have a spirit of I don't care I just
[1:15:16] I just got to get away from the pressure
[1:15:18] but I'm telling you what we need to do
[1:15:20] is cry out Lord send a fresh wave of
[1:15:24] your Holy Spirit into our presence Lord
[1:15:27] Lift us up
[1:15:29] oh we often have nightly prayers oh I I
[1:15:32] won't say we I'll just say me
[1:15:35] I've come to realize the pattern of
[1:15:38] rhythm of my nightly prayers
[1:15:41] depends on the condition of my daily
[1:15:43] battle
[1:15:46] and when I feel Victorious when I go to
[1:15:48] bed
[1:15:50] I just can pray up a storm
[1:15:54] but if I go to bed
[1:15:56] feeling battered
[1:15:58] beaten
[1:15:59] and the devil they're saying so you've
[1:16:01] been forsaken
[1:16:03] my prayers reflect that Saints
[1:16:06] and someone say Amen I'm not the only
[1:16:09] one am I
[1:16:11] and so this is why we must bring
[1:16:13] ourselves into an atmosphere that no
[1:16:16] matter what is happening around us we
[1:16:19] are able oh I'm not talking about
[1:16:20] fooling yourself
[1:16:22] none of this psychology name it claim it
[1:16:24] oh God said it so we're all supposed to
[1:16:26] be rich I want to know where's your
[1:16:28] Bentley
[1:16:32] God never promised me a Bentley
[1:16:34] God must promise me the Holy Ghost
[1:16:36] he promised me the power of the word
[1:16:39] that would restore me back to my
[1:16:40] rightful position according to the
[1:16:42] scripture
[1:16:43] he never promised us wealth and ease and
[1:16:46] Flowery beds my brother and sister but
[1:16:48] he promised a delivering power that said
[1:16:50] this work I have begun in you I will
[1:16:52] finish and that wasn't the preacher that
[1:16:54] spoke that that was God himself said
[1:16:57] I'll finish this work in you that you
[1:17:00] can come and have a confidence that
[1:17:02] you're walking Amen in the plan of God
[1:17:06] you know so the devil he imitates the
[1:17:09] plan of God so he he anoints people to
[1:17:12] work for him but do you realize what
[1:17:13] this perversion was was an anointing of
[1:17:15] the Holy Ghost he perverted the moving
[1:17:17] of the Holy Ghost and that moving of the
[1:17:19] Holy Spirit was when God come down upon
[1:17:21] us and we then become fellow yoke
[1:17:24] members of fellow laborers in the gospel
[1:17:28] and we feel anointed just to live this
[1:17:31] now I know that the secret we have in
[1:17:35] our church is that
[1:17:36] we're all sent an email
[1:17:39] and if you don't come and you don't sing
[1:17:41] and you don't that there'll be
[1:17:43] consequences
[1:17:50] sorry for warped humor
[1:17:53] we come to the house of God because
[1:17:55] there's something burning
[1:17:57] there's something churning inside of us
[1:17:59] I want to be in the house of God I Want
[1:18:01] To Worship the Lord because when I'm
[1:18:03] there his presence comes right down
[1:18:06] surrounds me now that can happen
[1:18:07] everywhere don't happen to have it have
[1:18:09] to happen in church but God said that's
[1:18:12] one of the places primary places he
[1:18:14] would come to meet us would be in the
[1:18:16] house of God With Us bringing our licks
[1:18:18] of fire together the atmosphere that we
[1:18:21] create and God comes down into that but
[1:18:24] God never threatened you
[1:18:26] right God never threatened you I can
[1:18:28] remember a young man told me one time as
[1:18:30] a young man he kind of backslit and he'd
[1:18:32] find excuses you know to go and really
[1:18:34] what he was doing was running up the
[1:18:36] mountain and going fishing on Sundays
[1:18:39] and one day his relative who happened to
[1:18:42] be the pastor of the church
[1:18:44] told him now here's a kid didn't lie
[1:18:47] cheat didn't do anything read his Bible
[1:18:48] prayed every day
[1:18:50] just didn't go to church on Sunday
[1:18:54] and a relative comes to him and says you
[1:18:55] know you're going to hell
[1:19:00] these are hard words there's a little
[1:19:02] humor in it but these are hard words he
[1:19:03] said you're going to Hellboy
[1:19:07] and he said well hell it'd be preferable
[1:19:09] than being in church with you
[1:19:15] hard words
[1:19:17] that you see there was something about
[1:19:19] atmosphere
[1:19:21] that wasn't right
[1:19:23] honestly Saints why didn't that young
[1:19:26] man
[1:19:27] have an anticipation and burning to be
[1:19:29] in the house of God
[1:19:32] still love the Lord still read his Bible
[1:19:33] prayed
[1:19:34] but there was an atmosphere that wasn't
[1:19:36] there I pray God never lets that
[1:19:38] atmosphere ever even come close to the
[1:19:40] parking lot of this church that we
[1:19:42] create an atmosphere where people say I
[1:19:44] want to be in the house of God I want to
[1:19:46] I want to be a part of what God is doing
[1:19:49] amen and if we're not creating that kind
[1:19:51] of atmosphere then I say God come and
[1:19:54] bring a Revival and a repentance in
[1:19:56] Grace Tabernacle that we create an
[1:19:58] atmosphere where people say I want to go
[1:20:00] to church I want to be a part of what
[1:20:02] God is doing oh I tell you what my
[1:20:03] brother and sister the devil imitates a
[1:20:06] lot of things he makes the world so
[1:20:08] appealing he makes it so attractive my
[1:20:11] brother and sister that everything about
[1:20:13] it just you can't hardly find a fault
[1:20:15] with it I mean they're all having fun
[1:20:19] as I heard a minister say once it's all
[1:20:22] fun until you hear the sizzling of the
[1:20:24] fat
[1:20:27] that goes for like a lead balloon don't
[1:20:29] it
[1:20:30] but there'll come a day
[1:20:32] there'll come a day that it won't be fun
[1:20:35] oh no we don't make this as a threat my
[1:20:37] brother and sister I'm just telling you
[1:20:38] the devil's so clever in his imitation
[1:20:41] of what God is doing
[1:20:43] amen and you know I think it's
[1:20:45] interesting
[1:20:46] did you know that people love imitations
[1:20:53] come on
[1:20:55] because an imitation does not cost
[1:20:58] as much as the original
[1:21:02] do we want an imitation church because
[1:21:04] we're afraid to pay the price
[1:21:06] no sir I want a relationship with my
[1:21:08] Lord that's the original Lord anoint me
[1:21:11] to pay the price whatever it takes Lord
[1:21:14] I want the original I want a life that I
[1:21:16] can lay my life down and Christ will
[1:21:19] raise it right back up again amen I want
[1:21:22] a life that is so filled with the love
[1:21:24] of God that I'm not afraid of pouring my
[1:21:26] love out my brother and sister you see
[1:21:28] people they're stingy with love
[1:21:33] stingy
[1:21:36] they say well that's the way I was
[1:21:38] raised
[1:21:39] well I'm a New Creation in Christ
[1:21:42] and whatever love I pour out the Holy
[1:21:44] Ghost will pour it right back in me why
[1:21:45] don't you try it why don't you try it
[1:21:47] just pour out beyond what you ever have
[1:21:49] seen and felt and what knowledge of in
[1:21:52] your whole life just pour it out and see
[1:21:54] if God doesn't pull it fill it right
[1:21:56] back up again
[1:21:57] Hallelujah Hallelujah now persecute
[1:22:01] is to treat someone cruelly and unfairly
[1:22:03] especially because of race or religious
[1:22:07] or political belief
[1:22:09] constantly annoy now this doesn't count
[1:22:12] concerning the preacher
[1:22:14] okay I'm not persecuting you
[1:22:18] I might annoy you but I'm not
[1:22:19] persecuting you
[1:22:22] so what is this it's tenoi with a
[1:22:24] persistent or urgent approach
[1:22:27] so we see that I think all of us would
[1:22:29] say somewhere in our life there's
[1:22:31] something that little weakness in the
[1:22:33] flesh will be setting sin as it were a
[1:22:36] little something that Satan the fiery
[1:22:37] Dart and he just keeps aiming for that
[1:22:39] same spot and you know it annoys us It
[1:22:42] Bolts us it vexes our spirit but you
[1:22:45] know I'd like to be fair to the devil
[1:22:47] today if you don't mind Amen to just
[1:22:50] give him a chance to have his expression
[1:22:52] today now Brother David Nash on this
[1:22:55] last Wednesday brought out a point that
[1:22:57] there was a time a season when the
[1:23:00] saints would just uh they laid their
[1:23:02] lives down without a single word they
[1:23:04] just submitted and just laid that down
[1:23:06] amen and then there come a time my
[1:23:08] brother and sister that there was a
[1:23:10] change in the anointing and the
[1:23:12] anointing come to where the people rose
[1:23:14] up and fought back and said we are not
[1:23:16] going to allow this to happen in our
[1:23:20] lives any longer but we've got to find a
[1:23:22] balance don't you just love balance amen
[1:23:25] you got to have a balance so you look at
[1:23:28] that see that day they fought violence
[1:23:30] with violence but yet again the gospel
[1:23:33] turned a corner and we'll see in second
[1:23:36] Corinthians 10 3 it's there that it says
[1:23:39] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:23:41] war after the flesh so we are no longer
[1:23:45] in this day dealing with Satan as a
[1:23:48] battle of Flesh against flesh now up to
[1:23:51] time whatever we see there is violence
[1:23:54] on the Earth today religious violence on
[1:23:57] the Earth today the news constantly
[1:23:59] comes out of some of those African
[1:24:00] countries for being killed for being a
[1:24:02] Christian and so it is that there is
[1:24:05] still conflict going on but I'm talking
[1:24:07] in this spiritual realm we're not
[1:24:10] fighting we're not pushing back against
[1:24:12] the flesh because that is not the answer
[1:24:14] and we might have differences you might
[1:24:16] say of opinion of baptisms of these kind
[1:24:19] of things and the difference but we
[1:24:20] should never ever turn it into a battle
[1:24:22] of the flesh it should never became a
[1:24:25] bottle of names and actions of such that
[1:24:27] would be degrading because that defies
[1:24:29] your claim as a Christian
[1:24:32] the devil would love for us to do that
[1:24:35] for the weapons of our Warfare now God's
[1:24:38] once again talking to a special class of
[1:24:40] people you know who I'm talking to amen
[1:24:43] a special class of people amen our
[1:24:46] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:24:48] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:24:50] down of strongholds amen have you ever
[1:24:53] pulled down a stronghold
[1:24:55] oh I'll tell you every one of you
[1:24:57] somebody you didn't shake your head I'll
[1:24:58] shake it for you because if you have
[1:25:00] prayed and asked God to do something
[1:25:02] concerning your life or life of someone
[1:25:05] close to you and you see God come bring
[1:25:07] a Deliverance bring a healing you've
[1:25:09] pulled down a stronghold amen and the
[1:25:12] devil wants you to just get towards just
[1:25:14] calm and well we prayed and and you know
[1:25:16] that went away no my brother and sister
[1:25:17] you just tore down a whole devilish
[1:25:20] stronghold
[1:25:23] amen
[1:25:25] are we doing okay
[1:25:27] see we got a new warfare though
[1:25:31] a new anointing in the land that we live
[1:25:33] in in James 4 6.
[1:25:38] as we look in James 4 6 he says uh but
[1:25:41] he giveth more grace wherefore he said
[1:25:44] God resisteth the proud but give us
[1:25:46] Grace into the humble
[1:25:48] submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:25:52] resist
[1:25:53] amen the devil
[1:25:55] and he will flee from you
[1:25:57] see this no longer
[1:26:00] a Warfare of flesh and blood
[1:26:03] our weapon actually is anointing of the
[1:26:06] Holy Ghost to withstand the onslaught of
[1:26:10] the enemy
[1:26:11] now to withstand the onslaught of the
[1:26:13] enemy first you have to declare that
[1:26:16] you're going to be victorious
[1:26:19] this
[1:26:20] in my love of History
[1:26:22] has been proven again and again and
[1:26:25] again
[1:26:26] through all the writings of History
[1:26:29] men
[1:26:31] who said that they would fight to The
[1:26:33] Bitter End
[1:26:35] not for the hope
[1:26:37] of just a stalemate
[1:26:40] but declaring
[1:26:42] victory
[1:26:48] you know shamgar was out there beating
[1:26:50] on the helmets
[1:26:52] all them Philistines saying I hope I can
[1:26:54] I hope I can I hope I can
[1:26:58] no sir samgar was like
[1:27:01] didn't you guys read
[1:27:03] visitors you might not be able to see it
[1:27:05] but we actually have a no trespassing
[1:27:07] sign right here
[1:27:09] in the church it's posted here for the
[1:27:11] devil to know that this is posted
[1:27:13] property it's not his property and he
[1:27:15] can't trespass
[1:27:17] shamgar got tired of the Philistines
[1:27:19] look at the spiritual type trespassing
[1:27:22] in his life and he didn't grab up an ox
[1:27:25] code going I hope this 25 year old Ox
[1:27:28] goad or this Walmart aux code
[1:27:31] will withstand this battle he went out
[1:27:34] there and said I'm tired of it God this
[1:27:37] is my land this is my food this is my
[1:27:40] family and this is your word and he went
[1:27:42] to work on them Philistines never I do I
[1:27:45] believe once during that time was he
[1:27:48] worried about whether the ox code was
[1:27:50] going to last through the battle he was
[1:27:52] anointed to fight that battle and he
[1:27:55] looked to them and he was living on the
[1:27:58] promise that God had already given and
[1:28:00] he said that promise is my promise and
[1:28:02] as we closed out those scriptures there
[1:28:04] what is uh what it is spoken I believe
[1:28:06] and will speak myself amen and he was
[1:28:09] speaking Victory right into his life
[1:28:11] this is not name it claim it Saints this
[1:28:13] is you speaking the word of God and God
[1:28:16] honoring you making a claim on his word
[1:28:19] hallelujah amen so what happens now he
[1:28:23] doesn't say go out and have a verbal
[1:28:25] Warfare an advertising campaign a smear
[1:28:28] campaign no just resist just resist
[1:28:32] how's the prophet say uh to how to
[1:28:34] overcome just resist
[1:28:40] just resist Saints all through the word
[1:28:43] of God every Prophet through this
[1:28:44] scripture laid out a pattern for us to
[1:28:47] resist evil
[1:28:49] to stand on the promise and not back up
[1:28:51] from that
[1:28:52] and God said I'll be behind you I'll
[1:28:55] stand with you now I tell you what what
[1:28:58] is our defense
[1:29:00] come down we can say devil I'm resisting
[1:29:03] you leave will that do any good
[1:29:07] you got to have something behind it
[1:29:10] you got to have a foundation that those
[1:29:11] words are built on
[1:29:13] you have to have something that the
[1:29:15] devil knows that you know what you're
[1:29:18] talking about
[1:29:19] and then it's no longer when the devil
[1:29:21] knows no this is not intellectual this
[1:29:22] is not the guy who can quote Whole
[1:29:24] scriptures whole chapters no this is not
[1:29:27] that kind my brother and sister this is
[1:29:29] when you know that you know that you
[1:29:30] know that God called you and I am a
[1:29:33] daughter of God I am a Son of God and
[1:29:35] I'm standing in its position and I won't
[1:29:37] be moved from that and Satan I'm going
[1:29:40] to take the same position that my Lord
[1:29:42] Jesus did I'm not going to come and
[1:29:44] quote all kinds of scriptures I'm not
[1:29:46] going to come and threaten you I'm just
[1:29:47] going to tell you it's written it's
[1:29:50] written you are talking to the word now
[1:29:53] my brother and sister you know some
[1:29:55] people can't grasp this in the day that
[1:29:57] we live in that we have become the word
[1:29:59] we have become the word that's what the
[1:30:01] Bible tells us we have become the word
[1:30:04] because it's living it's saturated us
[1:30:07] until our very fiber of our being on the
[1:30:10] cells of our mind amen our whole spirit
[1:30:13] is the word of God it's Christ amen I'm
[1:30:16] not my own I've sold out
[1:30:19] and so now when I come and I stand on
[1:30:22] the word of God and I speak to the devil
[1:30:24] I don't know how your conversation with
[1:30:26] him is mine gets pretty personal
[1:30:28] sometimes
[1:30:30] you know devil I'm offended
[1:30:33] I'm offended that you would actually use
[1:30:35] such a nice person
[1:30:37] with a bad spirit
[1:30:39] to try and cause grief
[1:30:41] to me
[1:30:44] I don't hold the person responsible
[1:30:48] you know the devil knowing something to
[1:30:50] rob the bank and then calls 9-1-1 so the
[1:30:52] police catch him
[1:30:54] that's how he plays the game
[1:30:56] then the one who was trying to serve God
[1:30:59] but got anointed to do something he
[1:31:00] shouldn't have done is now bitter at God
[1:31:02] because he's in a bind
[1:31:04] and the devil sits back and says man
[1:31:06] this works well let me tell you Saints
[1:31:08] it works it will just have the foresight
[1:31:11] and the courage to stop
[1:31:13] look back to the word and say it is
[1:31:15] written
[1:31:16] I'll fall many times but my Lord is
[1:31:19] there and he's going to raise me back up
[1:31:21] amen I have many days of doubts and
[1:31:24] fears but this Prince of Peace has come
[1:31:27] and he now takes and wipes away all the
[1:31:30] anxieties all the fears and well you
[1:31:32] know my doctor says well good for your
[1:31:34] doctor but what about Dr Jesus what did
[1:31:36] he say that ought to be something that
[1:31:39] we hold and say you know what I'm going
[1:31:40] to go to the doctor all right but I'm
[1:31:42] going to go to the doctor Jesus first
[1:31:44] and now look how this is placed
[1:31:48] I find this interesting because I have
[1:31:50] done this
[1:31:53] and I won't be so bold to say you all
[1:31:55] have done it but it's people that look
[1:31:56] just like you have done it
[1:32:00] that we have glorified the persecution
[1:32:05] you know that's the woven to me
[1:32:09] as brother Jewell says
[1:32:11] lousy wowzy woo
[1:32:16] lousy lousy whoa
[1:32:22] I got a plate for work
[1:32:24] that's why they invented the alarm clock
[1:32:29] I couldn't find any cold cereal in the
[1:32:31] house
[1:32:32] it's been on your grocery list for a
[1:32:34] week
[1:32:36] I went out I'm already late for work and
[1:32:38] my car's got a flat tire
[1:32:40] it's been going down
[1:32:42] for a week 10 days
[1:32:45] the devil shirt hard on me
[1:32:49] got no sympathy in my neighborhood the
[1:32:51] grocery stores just down the street
[1:32:54] um tire shops right down there on the
[1:32:56] street you know in fact the tire shops
[1:32:58] are getting so sophisticated in big
[1:32:59] cities they'll come to your company's
[1:33:01] parking lot
[1:33:02] patch your tire right there you can just
[1:33:04] be working away they'll even charge your
[1:33:07] electric car with a diesel generator
[1:33:09] right in your company parking lot
[1:33:12] that's the world we live in it's called
[1:33:13] laodicea
[1:33:16] and then people go around saying well I
[1:33:19] got reprimanded they told me one more
[1:33:20] time I'm gonna get fired at work oh the
[1:33:22] devil's after me no you're just lazy
[1:33:25] you're just lazy you need to just get up
[1:33:27] off of your little tail and you need I'm
[1:33:29] sorry I shouldn't have said it that way
[1:33:38] and that's all they can talk about
[1:33:41] how you doing brother
[1:33:43] I'll tell you what I visited a church I
[1:33:45] hope you find humor in this I visit a
[1:33:48] church sister Jerry and I was there and
[1:33:49] there was a brother that we've we had
[1:33:51] known from the past and there was a
[1:33:53] brother started making a beeline towards
[1:33:54] us and this brother leans over to me
[1:33:56] real quick just leans over he goes
[1:33:58] whatever you do don't ask me man
[1:34:04] anyway it's like God bless you brother
[1:34:06] nice to meet you
[1:34:09] no key in the lock he's like go on find
[1:34:12] somebody else well he did just right
[1:34:13] past us brother how you doing oh brother
[1:34:16] you wouldn't believe was the time of my
[1:34:19] week has been like blah blah blah and
[1:34:21] that Brothers obviously heard it before
[1:34:23] he goes oh that's just like the week
[1:34:25] before and the week before and the week
[1:34:26] before and the week before
[1:34:29] I'll go find somebody else who'll have
[1:34:31] sympathy for me
[1:34:33] look my brother and sister we're not
[1:34:35] here to glorify any persecution our lord
[1:34:38] Jesus do you see him in this scripture
[1:34:40] going on and on and on about oh they did
[1:34:42] this and they spoke this and they spoke
[1:34:44] these evil words you do this it's
[1:34:46] recorded but Jesus didn't record it
[1:34:50] I hope you get my point
[1:34:52] we don't glorify the persecution
[1:34:55] but we do find those that can that's all
[1:34:57] they can talk about now I think I added
[1:34:59] this in the brothers don't have it but
[1:35:00] we're all familiar with Philippians 4 8
[1:35:02] right all of these things that we have
[1:35:05] you know whatever things are true
[1:35:06] whatever things are honest whatever
[1:35:07] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:35:09] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:35:11] whatsoever things are good report if
[1:35:13] there be any virtue if there be any
[1:35:15] praise think on these things
[1:35:18] amen let that be the change and if Satan
[1:35:22] cannot anoint Us in the mind to think on
[1:35:25] the negative my brother and sister then
[1:35:27] the mind will naturally go to the
[1:35:29] positive that's how God created us
[1:35:32] so if you ever start thinking negative
[1:35:34] thoughts I just want to remind you
[1:35:37] it's not of God
[1:35:40] so just say
[1:35:42] devil
[1:35:43] you get it back I don't want it it's not
[1:35:46] from God I don't want it now I wanna I
[1:35:48] want you to can we all
[1:35:50] I I know there'll be some here that will
[1:35:52] catch this little play on words and I
[1:35:54] hope it doesn't
[1:35:55] leave anything but I want to have a
[1:35:57] little sympathy on the devil
[1:36:00] okay is it okay this morning we have a
[1:36:02] little sympathy on the devil you'll bear
[1:36:04] with me
[1:36:05] you imagine
[1:36:07] how the devil feels when a child of God
[1:36:09] goes to the throne in prayer
[1:36:15] everything he's tried to do to keep him
[1:36:18] from that place
[1:36:19] hasn't worked
[1:36:21] and There Before the Throne crying out
[1:36:23] to God
[1:36:24] I I'm almost thinking the devil's
[1:36:27] probably getting just a tad bit
[1:36:28] depressed over this
[1:36:30] you know it it just not working
[1:36:35] and I hope this doesn't
[1:36:38] seem out of place but this was just in
[1:36:41] my notes these are things that we were
[1:36:43] studying out
[1:36:44] I wonder how the devil feels
[1:36:46] when a child of God crosses to the other
[1:36:48] side
[1:36:50] we feel sadness
[1:36:52] but where is the shout of victory
[1:36:55] this is all they have longed for and
[1:36:58] sought for and lived for
[1:37:00] we have sadness but there should be a
[1:37:03] shout of Victory and the devil's
[1:37:05] depressed because that one got away
[1:37:08] I will have no more opportunity to
[1:37:11] persecute him I have no opportunity to
[1:37:14] struggle cause struggle in turmoil in
[1:37:17] their life
[1:37:18] how does the devil feel
[1:37:21] when you praise God in the face of
[1:37:23] adversity
[1:37:25] imagine how the devil feels when you
[1:37:27] have overcome his anointing you've
[1:37:30] overcome his suggestion you've overcome
[1:37:32] his gospel
[1:37:34] and you still Worship in the face of
[1:37:36] adversity
[1:37:38] the devil's like this is not working
[1:37:40] we've got a problem Houston we've got a
[1:37:42] problem
[1:37:44] and this one I think is a real crushing
[1:37:46] blow to the devil how does the devil
[1:37:48] feel when Sons and Daughters of God come
[1:37:52] and repent
[1:37:56] I had evidence against them
[1:37:59] I had an indictment in their life
[1:38:02] and they've just
[1:38:04] wiped it away
[1:38:10] ever wonder why it's so hard to repent
[1:38:13] we're going to do an impromptu poll
[1:38:18] have any of you known you should have
[1:38:20] repented
[1:38:22] and it was like getting teeth pulled
[1:38:26] why
[1:38:28] because you're not a son of God you're
[1:38:30] not a daughter of God
[1:38:31] no sir because the devil's there
[1:38:33] throwing all kinds up and did you ever
[1:38:36] notice the longer you go
[1:38:39] from the moment you know that you should
[1:38:41] repent the harder it is in fact we can
[1:38:44] go so far into this that we start to
[1:38:47] craft the story
[1:38:51] well I really don't need to repent
[1:38:53] because
[1:38:55] they did this
[1:38:57] they said this and then this and then I
[1:38:59] was there thinking I'll I'll kind of say
[1:39:03] I'm sorry but they just walked right by
[1:39:05] me on their way out of church
[1:39:06] well so did 40 other people
[1:39:10] but that anointing is right there
[1:39:13] and another week goes by
[1:39:15] I love the story of two brothers
[1:39:18] in Iowa
[1:39:20] farmed across the creek from each other
[1:39:22] now the one brother actually owned a
[1:39:24] little bit of land on the other side of
[1:39:26] the creek next to his brother there
[1:39:29] and he wanted to make a little Park
[1:39:32] over there on that other side of the
[1:39:33] creek partly to annoy his brother
[1:39:36] but partly because it was a beautiful
[1:39:38] spot
[1:39:39] so he hires a carpenter
[1:39:42] true story
[1:39:45] hires a carpenter to build a nice big
[1:39:47] wide arching Wood Bridge over
[1:39:50] the creek
[1:39:52] so as the Carpenters
[1:39:54] building this bridge he's talking to the
[1:39:56] man and he says well for sure is that
[1:39:58] your property over there who who owns
[1:40:00] the other property my brother well how
[1:40:02] does he feel about you building the
[1:40:03] bridge I haven't talked to him in 20
[1:40:04] years
[1:40:07] I mean he must have done something
[1:40:09] really really serious well actually I
[1:40:11] don't remember why we don't talk
[1:40:15] it's like oh
[1:40:17] okay keeps on building the bridge
[1:40:20] finally one day it comes and hears this
[1:40:22] big beautiful stained or varnished or
[1:40:25] whatever it was big arch bridge over
[1:40:27] there and he built some picnic tables
[1:40:28] and whatever else but what this man
[1:40:30] didn't know is he went to the brother
[1:40:32] the carpenter did
[1:40:35] just a little Carpenter
[1:40:37] just a little Carpenter
[1:40:41] and he went to the other man and he says
[1:40:43] I'm going to be bold sir what is it
[1:40:45] between you and your brother he says I I
[1:40:47] don't know
[1:40:49] it's been so long I've forgotten
[1:40:52] he said I'm going to cut a ribbon on the
[1:40:55] bridge tomorrow
[1:40:59] for your brother and his family
[1:41:05] I think you ought to be there
[1:41:10] that next day
[1:41:12] they have all the family down there
[1:41:15] they go to cut the ribbon
[1:41:17] and the man says wait
[1:41:21] there's somebody over here in the bushes
[1:41:23] in the trees what is this
[1:41:26] and here comes his brother and his
[1:41:27] family
[1:41:30] now think about this this man had
[1:41:33] discernment
[1:41:35] you say hey
[1:41:38] let's not have this a cutting of a
[1:41:40] ribbon
[1:41:41] as a celebration as it were of a bridge
[1:41:46] but let's cut a ribbon
[1:41:48] as a celebration
[1:41:50] of unity
[1:41:52] of a love of a forgiveness
[1:41:55] and face to face in those words those
[1:41:57] two men broke down in tears
[1:42:00] and later on they spent every day they
[1:42:04] spent time together
[1:42:07] and it was only just a handful of years
[1:42:08] before the one brother passed away
[1:42:11] my brother and sister
[1:42:13] how effective Satan can be
[1:42:16] come in and Destroy Fellowship in
[1:42:18] families and destroy all of this and
[1:42:21] people don't even know what it was and
[1:42:24] the reason they don't know is because it
[1:42:26] was the devil and they never saw the
[1:42:28] devil's handiwork as for what it was
[1:42:31] oh my you know what I'm never going to
[1:42:33] be able to read this really long quote
[1:42:35] that I have to finish this if I don't
[1:42:37] get after it
[1:42:38] amen so look what it is my brother and
[1:42:40] sister how the devil you know he he
[1:42:43] feels like he might under these the
[1:42:45] definition of the word persecuted the
[1:42:47] devil actually might think he's
[1:42:48] persecuted for what he believes
[1:42:51] I want you to have some Sympathy for the
[1:42:53] Devil
[1:42:54] when you've got Sons and Daughters of
[1:42:56] God that are holding on to the word of
[1:42:58] God that life has become absolute in the
[1:43:01] word of God what is it you are rejecting
[1:43:03] everything the devil believes amen it is
[1:43:07] not just a battle of right and wrong
[1:43:09] this is a battle of Doctrine and spirit
[1:43:11] of not of flesh and blood but of things
[1:43:14] of a spiritual warfare
[1:43:17] and the devil poor guy out there why
[1:43:20] what happened
[1:43:21] you've rejected his message
[1:43:25] oh come on it's all based off spiritual
[1:43:27] things my brother and sister
[1:43:29] you take it right back to the Garden
[1:43:31] it's all based off of spiritual things
[1:43:33] and so you've got two spirits in the
[1:43:36] framework of the church it's not just
[1:43:37] Spirits it's gospel it's a message
[1:43:40] you've got a message of laodicea that's
[1:43:42] coming and it's converting millions and
[1:43:44] millions and millions of people and
[1:43:46] gaining momentum
[1:43:50] and the devil's so proud of himself
[1:43:51] until he came to you
[1:43:54] Can someone say thank you Lord
[1:43:57] thank you Lord when the devil got to me
[1:43:59] there was just something in me that said
[1:44:00] no sorry I reject the God of this evil
[1:44:03] age I reject your message of the hour
[1:44:07] that's here I reject that because
[1:44:09] there's already been a message that was
[1:44:10] planted in me from the foundation of the
[1:44:13] world and I realized by revelation of
[1:44:15] who I really am I'm not just a person
[1:44:18] wandering to and fro but I am the very
[1:44:20] life seed of Jesus Christ in flesh oh
[1:44:25] hallelujah hallelujah now look see
[1:44:29] if you're going to prosecute something
[1:44:31] now what would you guys say the
[1:44:33] prosecution is would that be like a
[1:44:35] judge and a jury taking someone who's
[1:44:39] committed a crime and they're presenting
[1:44:42] the law
[1:44:43] and the crime
[1:44:45] and they're there to convict him right
[1:44:47] that's kind of what most of us think
[1:44:48] prosecution is well you know what
[1:44:52] brother Mike when you shared with me
[1:44:54] that you love
[1:44:56] I think it was you maybe it wasn't you
[1:44:58] maybe it was someone else
[1:45:00] maybe it was you
[1:45:01] something about understanding
[1:45:03] definitions you know knowing what things
[1:45:05] mean don't don't just read a word oh
[1:45:07] okay that's the word that's that's me
[1:45:09] you guys know that all the time I just
[1:45:11] have to know what words mean now we have
[1:45:14] the actor the process of holding a trial
[1:45:17] amen you know I put every one of you on
[1:45:19] trial before
[1:45:21] when I had a critical spirit
[1:45:27] somebody ought to be able to get an amen
[1:45:28] out of that
[1:45:30] my goodness you guys have I lost you is
[1:45:32] it lunchtime
[1:45:35] no that's usually when we start judging
[1:45:37] everybody is when we've got a critical
[1:45:39] spirit on us I'm telling you Brother Jay
[1:45:42] and I just gave faces to each other
[1:45:44] during the deal here my brother and
[1:45:46] sister because I heard a brother
[1:45:47] Minister he's now you people that get
[1:45:50] all judgmental when you see somebody
[1:45:52] that is not dressed right don't act
[1:45:54] right whatever has tattoos all this
[1:45:56] stuff and you get all judgmental about
[1:45:58] that this brother says I want you to
[1:46:00] know what you're doing is looking at
[1:46:02] yourself before the blood of Jesus
[1:46:03] Christ came on you
[1:46:06] what's there to judge then the only
[1:46:08] thing that makes us different from them
[1:46:09] is the blood of Jesus Christ oh there's
[1:46:12] nothing for us to get high and mighty
[1:46:14] about whoa look at me I'm such a good
[1:46:16] Christian and they're just to say no if
[1:46:18] it wasn't for blood that's you
[1:46:21] now I say thank you for the blood Lord
[1:46:23] thank you for the blood and keep Lord
[1:46:26] just let it come over me over again and
[1:46:28] again and again
[1:46:29] Hallelujah but look at this we'll cut
[1:46:32] through all the definitions that don't
[1:46:33] matter to us persecution
[1:46:37] the act of doing or continuing to do
[1:46:41] something
[1:46:42] this is why
[1:46:44] we're
[1:46:45] I say persecution prosecution
[1:46:48] prosecution this is why my brother and
[1:46:51] sister we're going to prosecute the
[1:46:52] gospel
[1:46:53] because we're going to just keep right
[1:46:55] on doing it we're going to keep on
[1:46:57] living it everybody's going to try and
[1:46:59] get you to quit everybody's going to try
[1:47:01] and get you to go here everybody's going
[1:47:02] to try and get you to water down the
[1:47:03] soup and but no my brother and sister
[1:47:05] we're going to take this gospel and
[1:47:07] we're going to carry it in its original
[1:47:09] condition right on out to the End Amen
[1:47:12] so the world would be like oh you're
[1:47:14] going to prosecute no no no no my
[1:47:16] brother and sister I I'm not Prosecuting
[1:47:18] in the mind out here that we think I'm
[1:47:21] Prosecuting it because whatever happened
[1:47:22] down inside of me is going to take me
[1:47:24] back to the original seed again and
[1:47:27] again and again and finally it becomes
[1:47:29] absolutely I'm Tongue Tied this morning
[1:47:32] absolutely becomes my reference book of
[1:47:36] life
[1:47:37] because I I need the original
[1:47:40] I love how the law in itself has all
[1:47:43] kinds of Latin
[1:47:45] you know you'll see these things and
[1:47:47] you'll get papers and they use all these
[1:47:49] Latin words and that's really good
[1:47:51] that's really good latin's really good
[1:47:54] except for I was raised in Idaho and
[1:47:57] Latin here just doesn't get you very far
[1:48:00] walk in the restaurant all flowery in
[1:48:03] Latin
[1:48:04] and they'll ask you do you want onions
[1:48:06] on your cheeseburger or not
[1:48:09] you know just it won't get you far
[1:48:12] but I tell you what the persecution
[1:48:14] prosecution
[1:48:15] prosecution I don't know why I keep
[1:48:17] saying that I like the online Webster it
[1:48:21] says the continuation of a course of
[1:48:23] action with a view to its completion
[1:48:26] I want to prosecute the gospel
[1:48:28] hey man I don't want to just say it's
[1:48:30] good for my life right for this moment I
[1:48:32] want to take it all the way to the very
[1:48:33] end
[1:48:34] I'll not leave you nor forsake you
[1:48:37] amen okay I wanna I need to hurry along
[1:48:40] amen so you look at this
[1:48:43] you know
[1:48:45] brother Stephen
[1:48:46] preaching Family Camp
[1:48:49] just opened up a can of worms for me
[1:48:52] because now everywhere I look at this
[1:48:54] you know my brother and sister
[1:48:57] some people think it's foolishness
[1:48:59] to be so religious
[1:49:01] had a conversation the other day with a
[1:49:03] young man
[1:49:04] and and we were talking I just had
[1:49:07] opportunity to insert a few things to
[1:49:08] him
[1:49:09] and it surprisingly enough the young man
[1:49:11] responded and he says yeah he said look
[1:49:14] I know what you're talking about he said
[1:49:16] I've spent five six years in the Air
[1:49:18] Force he said and wherever you go the
[1:49:21] word passes quickly you're religious
[1:49:24] you don't want to hear their jokes you
[1:49:26] don't use their language
[1:49:28] he said it passes so quickly and then he
[1:49:31] said it it then
[1:49:33] twists
[1:49:34] and he used this word
[1:49:37] their persecution takes on a different
[1:49:39] form
[1:49:42] it's not oh hey we can drink you under
[1:49:45] the table
[1:49:47] no no takes on a religious twist
[1:49:52] does your God answer your prayers
[1:49:58] hmm
[1:49:59] what if you're a young man
[1:50:01] felt like God hadn't answered some
[1:50:03] prayers you know what kind of a blow
[1:50:04] that would be
[1:50:07] ah
[1:50:09] I don't know if God answers my prayers
[1:50:11] or not
[1:50:12] and the devil's right there to sense the
[1:50:14] hesitation
[1:50:16] and then it becomes a blow
[1:50:18] the day every day hit them with my
[1:50:21] brother Mike spent years in the Marine
[1:50:22] Corps he would know what the culture is
[1:50:24] like unforgiving
[1:50:26] brutal
[1:50:28] and every day
[1:50:34] but praise God we don't have to be the
[1:50:37] one that sits there and says I don't
[1:50:39] know if God answers my prayer we can be
[1:50:42] the one on fire saying I'm going to live
[1:50:44] every day ready for the coming of my
[1:50:47] Lord and my Lord answers my prayers even
[1:50:49] if I didn't see the answer that I
[1:50:52] thought I would see I know because he
[1:50:54] promised to answer my prayer he heard my
[1:50:57] cry and it has come to pass and how you
[1:50:59] can shut up those
[1:51:03] fiery darts
[1:51:06] God answers my prayer amen well have you
[1:51:09] ever seen your God
[1:51:12] where did you see him look at the sun
[1:51:14] where did it come from and if it can be
[1:51:17] recreated by man why haven't we created
[1:51:20] another one
[1:51:23] they all have answers well you know
[1:51:24] methane gas ponscome
[1:51:27] I'm not talking about your relatives
[1:51:30] I'm talking about my God my God said let
[1:51:32] it be and it was your relatives might
[1:51:35] have come that's based off of some silly
[1:51:37] joke I'm sorry but it's there my God
[1:51:39] just said it and it come to pass amen
[1:51:42] why because we have an answer to the
[1:51:45] devil's question we don't have to be
[1:51:47] bullied by the devil we don't have to
[1:51:49] sit back and let him do that now I'm
[1:51:51] sorry I do this all the time don't I
[1:51:53] apologize I have borrowed so far in the
[1:51:55] future you guys realize that I need to
[1:51:57] take a month vacation and then I might
[1:51:59] be caught back up on the time

[1:52:08] this
[1:52:10] as I was with Moses so will I be with
[1:52:12] thee
[1:52:13] so can the Church of the Living God be
[1:52:16] Reckless and fearless in faith

[1:52:42] they can't even jump and Shout they
[1:52:44] can't praise God their idea of thanking
[1:52:46] God for something is mumbling for over
[1:52:49] their gravy and spuds

[1:53:13] might touch somebody amen we were
[1:53:15] preaching in a little city called
[1:53:16] nacionmento Chile and down below them

[1:53:32] husband children lived in Angola they
[1:53:34] lived on the edge of a like a little
[1:53:35] Ravine or whatever and they had a deck
[1:53:37] that went out there on the one edge of
[1:53:38] that deck was about 12 14 feet off the
[1:53:41] ground where that was leveled out there
[1:53:43] anyway that little sister going through
[1:53:45] maybe a postpartum stage of her life or
[1:53:47] whatever that would be and she's there
[1:53:50] she comes to church that day now this is
[1:53:52] not about brother Paul this is about God
[1:53:54] coming and answering a need and using
[1:53:57] whoever he pleases to perform the work
[1:54:00] that he once done
[1:54:01] and we've come that day and I had a
[1:54:04] great burden on my heart and gone moving
[1:54:06] and that little sister had come to
[1:54:07] church and I'll just reveal what the
[1:54:09] situation was in a little bit and it was
[1:54:12] there as that little sister comes into
[1:54:13] the church with this depressed Spirit on
[1:54:15] her and she's sitting there I didn't

[1:54:19] noticed his sister that was just very
[1:54:21] down very pulled into herself and I
[1:54:24] noticed as the service went on she just
[1:54:26] was Freer and Freer and pretty soon a
[1:54:28] hand went up and pretty soon at the end
[1:54:30] of this service is the holy spirit moved
[1:54:33] with great power amongst the people
[1:54:36] I see this little sister just weeping
[1:54:39] and weeping and weeping and she's there
[1:54:41] just trembling and weeping and you think
[1:54:43] oh there's something great going on and
[1:54:45] see after church goes to her pastor and
[1:54:48] her husband and says you will find on
[1:54:50] the deck
[1:54:51] tied to the second post a rope with a
[1:54:55] noose on the end of it where I was going
[1:54:57] home today to hang myself
[1:55:02] and God has delivered me
[1:55:06] God has delivered me
[1:55:08] the husband drove home that day and
[1:55:11] before his wife could even get out of
[1:55:12] the car went and went out on their deck
[1:55:15] and behind the post by a flower pot tied
[1:55:18] to the post already is a rope
[1:55:21] with a hangman's noose
[1:55:24] all coiled up there where all she had to
[1:55:26] do let's put it over her head and step
[1:55:29] off the deck
[1:55:31] now you tell me that we don't serve an
[1:55:33] on-time God Amen you tell me that we
[1:55:36] have a God that doesn't know the needs
[1:55:38] of all
[1:55:40] oh that's just one of thousands I
[1:55:43] believe I could number that I could
[1:55:44] share with you we've seen the power of
[1:55:47] God come on the scene and the problem is
[1:55:49] is
[1:55:50] it's become a little common it's become
[1:55:52] a little what and it just Fades back
[1:55:55] behind us
[1:55:56] until another group of people come
[1:55:59] and God says I guess I have to show
[1:56:02] myself
[1:56:03] again
[1:56:05] I've got to show myself that I'm here
[1:56:07] I'm real I'm alive again
[1:56:12] excuse me
[1:56:14] so can the Church of the Living God be
[1:56:16] Reckless and fearless in faith if we're
[1:56:18] pointed the right way for he said as I
[1:56:20] was with Moses I will be with you I'll
[1:56:23] not fail you nor forsake you he's never
[1:56:25] forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he
[1:56:27] will not fail Joshua he will not fail us
[1:56:30] he'll be with us and as we find Joshua
[1:56:33] to take his commission knowing the
[1:56:35] responsibilities was leading them
[1:56:37] through the lands now that he'd have to
[1:56:40] go over into the other land he'd have to
[1:56:42] set up their Kingdom and he'd have to
[1:56:44] divide the inheritance among them he
[1:56:46] knowed the commission was tremendous
[1:56:50] far more than what Moses had done Joshua
[1:56:52] had more to do than Moses had to do now
[1:56:55] I want you to catch this Saints if we
[1:56:57] think that Joshua just got a commission
[1:56:59] of God
[1:57:00] and then walked out
[1:57:01] and told Israel
[1:57:04] do it
[1:57:05] that it was that easy
[1:57:07] no sir
[1:57:09] no sir
[1:57:10] they were spirits
[1:57:12] there was the negative
[1:57:14] it was anxieties he was a man
[1:57:17] Christ reflected in a man
[1:57:20] but there was flesh
[1:57:23] and he had to say well what am I going
[1:57:26] to do
[1:57:26] God's God's got a great calling on me
[1:57:29] what am I going to do how can I do this
[1:57:32] another thing he was to lead them along
[1:57:34] the border amongst their brethren
[1:57:36] Now put on your spiritual thinking caps
[1:57:41] and they already tasted Blood let's talk
[1:57:43] about Israel had to conquer them
[1:57:46] he had to keep them quiet as they
[1:57:47] marched on and so it is today with this
[1:57:49] new Pentecostal group that's Rising now
[1:57:51] they've tasted denominationalism
[1:57:55] it's hard to keep them down
[1:57:58] see people just wanting we need a form
[1:58:00] come on Saints you don't know how
[1:58:02] privileged you are that you come to the
[1:58:04] house of God with Holy Spirit to lead
[1:58:06] you when the spirit in most religions
[1:58:08] now is people are looking for someone to
[1:58:11] tell them
[1:58:15] come on
[1:58:16] I know this is a little blunt
[1:58:18] hopefully our visitors understand
[1:58:21] this is a little blunt my brother and
[1:58:22] sister but what have people done they've
[1:58:24] come to a place they just want to be
[1:58:26] told well if you're going to just be
[1:58:27] told without any leadership of the Holy
[1:58:29] Ghost we ought to go join a church
[1:58:31] that's really fun and got a great
[1:58:32] welfare program and a great this and
[1:58:34] that and the church will play bank for
[1:58:36] you and blah blah blah blah blah
[1:58:39] and they'll tell you
[1:58:41] you do this this and you'll make it to
[1:58:43] heaven
[1:58:45] strangely enough most of these this is
[1:58:47] is something to do with supporting the
[1:58:49] church
[1:58:51] hope that's not too blunt
[1:58:54] they've tasted denominationalism man's
[1:58:56] control it's so hard to keep them down
[1:58:58] some years ago they said come brother
[1:59:00] Branham when the ministry first started
[1:59:02] we'll start an organization build a
[1:59:04] memorial you a memorial somewhere I'm
[1:59:06] not looking for Memorial I'm looking for
[1:59:08] the coming of the Lord
[1:59:10] amen so they formed a little cold and
[1:59:12] called it the latter rain moved up into
[1:59:14] Canada out into California but it fell
[1:59:16] through Court it couldn't go why was it
[1:59:18] the only thing they know they come out
[1:59:19] of those things and they got a little
[1:59:21] touch of it and they got to have
[1:59:23] something that they've got to do in
[1:59:25] other words they got to be oh I'm on the
[1:59:26] church board for this and I'm on the
[1:59:28] young program for that and I'm on this
[1:59:30] and I'm on that and believing that's a
[1:59:32] form of godliness my brother and sister
[1:59:33] are having the Holy Ghost is a form of
[1:59:35] godliness amen not having a position in
[1:59:38] the church that's not a form of
[1:59:39] godliness
[1:59:40] amen I hope I'm not getting too excited
[1:59:43] for y'all
[1:59:44] amen all the rest of that I spoke this
[1:59:46] morning was just getting me warmed up
[1:59:47] for this
[1:59:48] brother the real Church of the Living
[1:59:49] God has no forms has no Creeds it's led
[1:59:52] by the power of God Can someone say Amen
[1:59:55] in every individual's heart I say Amen
[1:59:58] again amen now he's telling they say he
[2:00:01] told them pass by your brethren don't
[2:00:02] fuss at them we're greater than they
[2:00:04] don't fuss with them just go by now look
[2:00:07] at this oh come on this is specific you
[2:00:10] might say in in our groups
[2:00:14] foreign
[2:00:16] 's a little funny
[2:00:19] they've got this thing over here
[2:00:21] I feel like I need to fuss at them
[2:00:25] I need to sit down the coffee when I
[2:00:27] could be talking about the good things
[2:00:28] of God and tell them where they're wrong
[2:00:31] I believe God called me to set them
[2:00:33] straight
[2:00:36] [Music]
[2:00:37] usually what happens is you created one
[2:00:39] of those riffs
[2:00:42] that nobody knows where it came from but
[2:00:43] you
[2:00:44] because you're the one that created it
[2:00:47] but after a while you realize huh that
[2:00:49] wasn't right I shouldn't have done that
[2:00:51] so you're never going to admit Church
[2:00:53] I just started the whole riff I just
[2:00:56] alienated all these people over here and
[2:00:57] all these people over here and I just
[2:01:00] hey don't paint me with your brush
[2:01:03] you want to do that do it on your own
[2:01:05] time under your own declaration but
[2:01:07] don't paint us with that brush
[2:01:09] amen oh we just love everybody when they
[2:01:12] do what we want
[2:01:14] yeah
[2:01:16] yeah
[2:01:18] don't fuss with them we're greater than
[2:01:19] they don't fuss at them just go by I
[2:01:21] want you to notice a great great big
[2:01:22] thing taking place here there was Esau
[2:01:24] Moab and those that referred to last
[2:01:26] night many of these people many of those
[2:01:28] were actually borderline believers
[2:01:31] come on Saints what are we going to do
[2:01:32] well we're going to faucet the
[2:01:34] borderline believer and tell them you
[2:01:36] know what hey you get the Holy Ghost you
[2:01:38] get the Holy Ghost you'll be a real
[2:01:40] believer like me
[2:01:43] only they look at you and say you're no
[2:01:45] different than me
[2:01:47] so if you've got the Holy Ghost I got
[2:01:49] the Holy Ghost
[2:01:50] and it's all borderline
[2:01:53] what about a real life
[2:01:55] on the inside and on the outside on
[2:02:00] display where the people would say I
[2:02:02] don't know what they've got that we
[2:02:03] don't got but I want to have what they
[2:02:05] got and their life changes because what
[2:02:08] you thought is not what you are but
[2:02:09] you've got what Christ is
[2:02:12] amen
[2:02:14] so the borderline believers they were
[2:02:17] right on the border now you can take
[2:02:18] this in a historical View and go back
[2:02:21] through the scripture and go back
[2:02:22] through history and realize that this is
[2:02:24] a two-edged sword they were living on
[2:02:25] the border
[2:02:27] and their spiritual state was borderline
[2:02:30] hmm
[2:02:40] right on the border I got to stop
[2:02:42] hearing something just for a moment
[2:02:43] won't take me but a minute many people
[2:02:44] refer to the promised land to be the
[2:02:46] Millennium it is not
[2:02:48] I can't believe I've had people tell me
[2:02:50] that
[2:02:51] yep yep
[2:02:53] we're already in the Millennium brother
[2:02:54] Paul
[2:02:57] I said this particular case
[2:03:01] I was like are you serious and he goes
[2:03:03] absolutely it's a revelation of God
[2:03:05] my pastor will pray for you and you'll
[2:03:07] get that revelation it's going to have
[2:03:09] to do more than pray for me to get that
[2:03:10] revelation
[2:03:12] because I'm still fighting
[2:03:13] I still fight my flesh my mind the
[2:03:16] circumstance around me I'm still
[2:03:18] fighting I'm not in the millennium
[2:03:21] we had a little deeper conversation I
[2:03:23] won't go into right here and I said I'll
[2:03:25] prove it to you
[2:03:26] and I did and he wasn't very happy but
[2:03:28] he knew I was right and later I
[2:03:31] regretted
[2:03:32] because I was fussing
[2:03:33] are you with me
[2:03:35] I found out later as it were in my heart
[2:03:38] that my motive wasn't pure
[2:03:40] I was just going to prove him wrong
[2:03:42] right
[2:03:44] hmm
[2:03:46] strangely enough do you know it never
[2:03:47] changed his mind
[2:03:50] all my fussing
[2:03:53] some of you know what I'm talking about
[2:03:55] all our fussing doesn't change a thing
[2:04:01] well I'll give them a piece of my mind
[2:04:03] but you've done that so much one of
[2:04:04] these days you're going to run out
[2:04:06] and you're not going to have anything
[2:04:08] left to give them because you've gave it
[2:04:09] away
[2:04:10] and usually the behavior accounts or the
[2:04:12] fact that instead of operating on a full
[2:04:14] deck
[2:04:15] oh sorry I shouldn't go like that
[2:04:17] but
[2:04:20] many people refer to Promised Land
[2:04:21] Millennium it's not the promised land
[2:04:23] had Wars and killings the Millennium
[2:04:26] will have any wars or killings that
[2:04:27] referred to the Holy Spirit the
[2:04:29] Battlegrounds now look at this my
[2:04:31] brother and sister I want you to just
[2:04:32] catch this I hope you can catch where
[2:04:34] I'm coming from justification they left
[2:04:36] Egypt three stages of their Journey they
[2:04:38] left Egypt under justification believing
[2:04:40] the word they separated themselves from
[2:04:42] the Egyptians and came out they crossed
[2:04:44] the Red Sea and killed the things behind
[2:04:45] them oh Lord help us to kill the things
[2:04:48] behind us what was sanctification
[2:04:50] through the blood that kills all human
[2:04:52] desire of evil second stage of the
[2:04:54] journey but the third stage was when
[2:04:57] they crossed Jordan into the promised
[2:04:58] land was their inheritance laid their
[2:05:01] inheritance never laid in Egypt though
[2:05:03] God bless them in Egypt you Lutheran boy
[2:05:06] calls it right out here you Lutheran
[2:05:08] believe in justification your
[2:05:10] inheritance doesn't lay there if you're
[2:05:12] called if you're just a Lutheran then
[2:05:15] that's all the farther you'll ever get
[2:05:16] you Methodist Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness
[2:05:19] Church of God message believers who
[2:05:22] believe in sanctification the killing of
[2:05:24] the evil that's in you taking out the
[2:05:26] roots of evil you belong across the
[2:05:29] river but to you men and women that
[2:05:32] there is something in you
[2:05:34] oh come on Saints this is who we are
[2:05:36] today there's something in you calling
[2:05:40] out the Deep to unto the Deep there's a
[2:05:43] Jordan yet to cross a land beyond the
[2:05:45] river you're going to pass by your
[2:05:47] brethren you're going to pass by your
[2:05:49] brethren and they're near the Borderland
[2:05:51] and if you pass by them don't say
[2:05:54] nothing to them I have given Esau this
[2:05:56] mountain I have given Moab this country
[2:05:58] I don't want you fussing at them prosely
[2:06:01] lighting move just move through gently
[2:06:04] you know where you're going now look at
[2:06:07] this line right here I'd highlighted if
[2:06:09] I could don't take up their habits their
[2:06:14] habits is what is keeping them where
[2:06:16] they're at
[2:06:17] oh come on my brother and sister I think
[2:06:20] about brother Bud Southwick my brother
[2:06:22] and sister what a man I never met him
[2:06:24] personally but I know brothers that were
[2:06:25] very close to him and and he was quite a
[2:06:28] character but here is a man that wanted
[2:06:30] to live right and there he is out there
[2:06:33] in the wilderness of British Columbia
[2:06:34] and he wants to live right get this now
[2:06:38] sometimes we think well if they wanted
[2:06:40] to they could here's a man who wanted to
[2:06:43] live right and couldn't break his
[2:06:45] cigarette habit
[2:06:49] and before going to bed he needed just
[2:06:51] one last cigarette
[2:06:54] and he said you know what
[2:06:56] I better go
[2:06:58] check the horses one last time
[2:07:03] see there's more to this story than you
[2:07:05] just get out
[2:07:06] listening to it
[2:07:08] those that are heard it firsthand
[2:07:11] step out of the tent
[2:07:13] the rustle of the breeze
[2:07:16] why you're not going to go up stream
[2:07:21] go out by the horses stand out past
[2:07:24] where the horses are tied
[2:07:26] pull out a cigarette
[2:07:29] light it
[2:07:31] brother bud
[2:07:34] yes brother
[2:07:37] when did you quit smoking
[2:07:45] I hope you catch this
[2:07:49] well he can only get delivered if he
[2:07:51] wanted to be delivered and if he wanted
[2:07:52] to be delivered he'd be delivered but he
[2:07:54] wanted to be delivered and he wasn't
[2:07:59] but God wants to give to you more
[2:08:02] than you desire for yourself
[2:08:07] and God said this
[2:08:09] is the moment amen this is the day
[2:08:16] his response
[2:08:18] come on I'm not trying to be hard on
[2:08:19] anybody but most of the time our
[2:08:21] response is well if you understand my
[2:08:25] circumstance
[2:08:28] if you knew why if you were in my shoes
[2:08:33] let's call it a Southwick moment
[2:08:36] maybe we could brand it that way from
[2:08:38] now on
[2:08:39] have a Southwick moment
[2:08:42] right now
[2:08:45] when were you delivered right now
[2:08:49] and I want this church to have a
[2:08:50] Southwick moment my brother and sister
[2:08:52] you got something that just keeps
[2:08:54] playing on you something that eats in
[2:08:56] you this Satan is just pestering you
[2:08:59] over this just constantly picking away
[2:09:02] at you why don't you make it a Southwick
[2:09:05] moment and say Lord there's Deliverance
[2:09:07] for me you've already given it I've
[2:09:09] claimed it and I'm gonna make it right
[2:09:12] now just now Lord just now I'm claiming
[2:09:16] my position on my Deliverance my healing
[2:09:20] revelation of the word to be open to me
[2:09:23] let it be right now Lord not six months
[2:09:26] not a year sometime in the future but
[2:09:29] right now
[2:09:30] oh Hallelujah don't take up their habits
[2:09:34] it's a problem my brother and sister
[2:09:37] you see how it is that we're not careful
[2:09:42] I experienced this years ago
[2:09:49] you start hanging out with people
[2:09:54] I'm not ashamed of this and at the same
[2:09:56] moment I'm very ashamed of it
[2:09:58] I started hanging out with some young
[2:10:00] men I've known him all my life but
[2:10:02] really hanging out with him
[2:10:04] and you know what I found out
[2:10:10] it took a young lady
[2:10:12] that just had some righteous indignation
[2:10:16] I know this just seems out of character
[2:10:17] because I'm just such a fine person
[2:10:20] but I started hanging out in pool halls
[2:10:23] I started coming home on Saturday
[2:10:25] mornings at one and two A.M
[2:10:28] oh I didn't drink I didn't smoke
[2:10:33] well you know what
[2:10:35] if you wrestle with the pig
[2:10:38] you both get dirty and the pig likes it
[2:10:44] and I'd been doing that and Jerry and
[2:10:45] I'd fuss over that she didn't really
[2:10:48] like it she'd tell me I don't care what
[2:10:50] you do now don't misunderstand her she
[2:10:52] was in the right spirit
[2:10:53] I don't care what you do
[2:10:55] I'm going to serve God Amen
[2:10:59] one day I come home I think it was about
[2:11:00] 12 45 in the morning
[2:11:02] you know how it is
[2:11:04] when you're guilty
[2:11:06] you don't ever just
[2:11:08] hey I'm home
[2:11:11] no sir
[2:11:13] it's almost like shoes come off
[2:11:16] WD-40 in the lock
[2:11:19] hinges
[2:11:25] and here is this like five foot one
[2:11:28] girl from Alaska
[2:11:31] visiting our house
[2:11:34] there she is her hair sticking up like
[2:11:36] this in a house coat pulled around she
[2:11:38] puts her little finger under my nose
[2:11:40] Paul hey you're supposed to be a
[2:11:42] Christian what are you doing acting like
[2:11:44] this why are you coming home like a
[2:11:47] thief in the night
[2:11:49] I'm like leave me alone the genius not
[2:11:52] none of your business
[2:11:56] but God made it her business at night
[2:12:01] and I never went back
[2:12:04] to a pool hall
[2:12:07] wow I don't even know where lagina is in
[2:12:10] her life right now
[2:12:12] but I know at that moment
[2:12:14] she looked like she was pretty ferocious
[2:12:17] maybe just to cut right off the block of
[2:12:19] the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:12:21] and she did a lot of roaring at me that
[2:12:24] night right there and I told her to mind
[2:12:25] her business and she said I'm Jerry's
[2:12:27] friend and this is my business and
[2:12:30] it was necessary things
[2:12:32] I needed that
[2:12:35] yeah
[2:12:36] don't take up their habits Moab false
[2:12:39] prophet a bishop by the name of Balaam
[2:12:40] come down got amongst the congregation
[2:12:42] trying to get them to organize and all
[2:12:45] come together because they were Brethren
[2:12:47] but they were not
[2:12:49] that's how he look how he breaks this
[2:12:51] down they were half Brothers
[2:12:53] you know what my brother and sister I'm
[2:12:55] not half Brothers with you I am a full
[2:12:59] brother in Jesus Christ I'm not a half
[2:13:02] brother or not a half a promise there
[2:13:04] and a half a promise here we are one in
[2:13:06] Christ amen we cannot manufacture Unity
[2:13:09] Unity comes from our believing and
[2:13:13] acting upon the word of God and they
[2:13:15] come together because they were Brethren
[2:13:16] but they were not they were half
[2:13:18] Brothers not real brothers if in your
[2:13:20] heart
[2:13:21] oh
[2:13:23] don't disagree with him just go ahead
[2:13:25] leave them alone pay for what you get if
[2:13:27] you have to pass through his country he
[2:13:29] was predestinated to be that if God
[2:13:31] would expect it or predestinated Moab to
[2:13:34] join up with Israel they'd have joined
[2:13:36] up if he had predestinate Esau to go
[2:13:39] with Israel Esau would have jumped in
[2:13:41] and win but he gave him his inheritance
[2:13:43] on the other side of the river so how
[2:13:45] can you try to make all the Lutheran
[2:13:47] seed all the Baptists see it all the
[2:13:49] Presbyterian sea and all the Nazarene
[2:13:51] seed all the pilgrim Holiness all the
[2:13:53] message people don't condemn them that's
[2:13:56] all they know
[2:13:57] that's all that's in then I'm sorry I
[2:13:59] inject that in there it's not really
[2:14:01] good of me to do that
[2:14:02] but to you who believe
[2:14:05] is this word speaking to anyone this
[2:14:07] morning but to you who believe
[2:14:11] called to a higher qualification
[2:14:14] a higher requirement but to you who
[2:14:16] believe oh God to you who know to you
[2:14:20] that's got something in you that's
[2:14:21] calling to the Deep if all the Deep you
[2:14:23] God has been satisfied then stay where
[2:14:26] you're at
[2:14:27] you ever wonder why there's just a
[2:14:29] little constant something inside of you
[2:14:31] that's just wanting a little something
[2:14:33] more from the Lord and the devil tries
[2:14:35] to tell you it's because you don't got
[2:14:36] it
[2:14:37] you don't got it
[2:14:39] but what it's really is that that got
[2:14:42] placed inside of us to never stall out
[2:14:45] just to say well my great-granddaddy
[2:14:47] went to church here and my granddaddy
[2:14:49] went to church here and my dad went to
[2:14:51] church here and I go here and I'm so
[2:14:53] proud now my son and his family goes
[2:14:56] here
[2:14:57] come on
[2:14:58] to the bride of Christ this is what drug
[2:15:00] us my brother and sister from positions
[2:15:03] from places from places being on this
[2:15:06] board and that board and part of a
[2:15:08] church and whatever and drug out and
[2:15:10] people say what's went wrong with them
[2:15:11] what they didn't understand was that
[2:15:13] deep calling that could not be satisfied
[2:15:16] to just sit there and God has come in
[2:15:18] this day and he is being a land beyond
[2:15:21] the river amen oh let me go back up amen
[2:15:24] you've got this has been satisfied then
[2:15:26] stay where you're at but for me and my
[2:15:27] house for me there's something more than
[2:15:29] what we've seen there's a land beyond
[2:15:31] the river somewhere there's still a deep
[2:15:33] calling to the deep and I cannot be
[2:15:35] satisfied with theology
[2:15:38] yeah I cannot be satisfied with a good
[2:15:42] church
[2:15:43] some people left good churches left
[2:15:45] churches that had good pastors that
[2:15:47] loved the people wanted to do but the
[2:15:49] pastor would never preach beyond what
[2:15:51] their Church condoned because that's
[2:15:53] just what you did
[2:15:56] and so it was always just this is where
[2:15:58] we at we are this and we are that and
[2:16:00] you know just so you know one side of
[2:16:03] our family Mormon one side of our family
[2:16:05] Catholic
[2:16:06] but God so anointed my parents
[2:16:09] my sister's parents too she gets to
[2:16:12] claim them
[2:16:17] there's got to be more
[2:16:20] oh David look we'll make you a lay
[2:16:22] Minister don't leave no I'm sorry it
[2:16:25] ain't about staying or leaving I've got
[2:16:27] to find it there's something more
[2:16:30] I've got to find the more
[2:16:33] and years later that same pastor
[2:16:37] oh it's a whole nother story but that
[2:16:39] same Pastor looked me in the face one
[2:16:41] day in a funeral home
[2:16:43] and told me he says I believe your daddy
[2:16:45] made the right decision
[2:16:49] a man that said no you can't leave the
[2:16:50] church David you're going to go out in
[2:16:52] the desert just like those examples in
[2:16:54] scriptures you can't do that David
[2:16:56] and years later after my own fathers
[2:16:58] passed away come and say your daddy made
[2:17:00] the right decision
[2:17:01] because our church I hope this don't
[2:17:03] offend no one but it was a
[2:17:06] Free Methodist Church
[2:17:08] and the man said in our church
[2:17:10] has just seemingly got more liberal and
[2:17:13] more liberal and more liberal
[2:17:17] oh God Hold Us
[2:17:19] Lord Hold Us don't let this Spirit of
[2:17:22] this age come in and cause us to soften
[2:17:26] the gospel water down the gospel let us
[2:17:30] come my brother and sister let's amen
[2:17:35] prosecute this gospel all the way to the
[2:17:38] end
[2:17:39] let's carry this truth and and live it
[2:17:42] out not make it a doctrine that we
[2:17:44] almost whip out of a card
[2:17:47] well we believe
[2:17:54] no sir
[2:17:56] here's my business card
[2:17:58] here's my business scoring
[2:18:00] cannot satisfied with a good church or
[2:18:02] cannot be satisfied with a good campaign
[2:18:04] I cannot be satisfied with a little
[2:18:06] healing service there's something beyond
[2:18:08] that that's calling just let them alone
[2:18:10] go on through don't argue with them
[2:18:12] but we're passing to another land
[2:18:15] oh this sounds harsh Saints and we're
[2:18:17] not judging God's the judge
[2:18:19] amen we're not the judge as I shared
[2:18:21] with you when we look out here if we get
[2:18:24] judgmental we need to remember that's us
[2:18:27] without the blood of Jesus Christ we're
[2:18:30] not no great people it's the blood that
[2:18:32] has changed us and made us what we are
[2:18:35] amen don't argue we're past another land
[2:18:38] that wasn't ordained to go with you they
[2:18:40] won't walk with you how can two walk
[2:18:42] unless they agreed but those who love
[2:18:44] God for those who were called of God
[2:18:46] well they say God give us this church
[2:18:48] God did this that's true
[2:18:51] that's true
[2:18:52] that's true my brother and sister but
[2:18:54] the church ain't taking you in rapture
[2:18:56] amen the church ain't going to heal you
[2:18:58] either
[2:18:59] the church ain't going to deliver you
[2:19:02] that's right God said I give you saw
[2:19:04] this mountain don't touch him but I've
[2:19:06] got something different for you cross
[2:19:07] over
[2:19:09] that's my desire Brethren to see the
[2:19:10] church cross over into another land
[2:19:12] desire to move over to the other side
[2:19:14] and if there's something in you here
[2:19:16] first calling there'll be something to
[2:19:18] respond to that call just settling down
[2:19:20] to cheap raising
[2:19:22] I like that they're settling down to
[2:19:24] sheep raising isn't enough for you
[2:19:26] go into some sort of business not enough
[2:19:29] for you just to join the church and put
[2:19:31] your name on the book it's not enough
[2:19:33] for you because there's something called
[2:19:35] on across the ridge Over Yonder across
[2:19:38] the next Ridge across Jordan until
[2:19:40] you've Fallen to the arms of God
[2:19:42] in a deep calling
[2:19:45] and to the Deep
[2:19:46] oh Hallelujah
[2:19:48] not just what I told myself I wouldn't
[2:19:50] do today Saints I can't apologize for
[2:19:54] this is the gospel but I could use more
[2:19:56] wisdom
[2:19:57] amen Jeremiah 29 11 as we close if the
[2:20:01] musicians would just come
[2:20:03] when you think about what God has for
[2:20:05] you
[2:20:07] we're Prosecuting the gospel
[2:20:09] taking it to the end
[2:20:11] for I know the thoughts that I have
[2:20:13] towards you saith the Lord thoughts of
[2:20:14] peace and not of evil to give you an
[2:20:18] expected
[2:20:21] or purposed
[2:20:24] or provided
[2:20:26] end
[2:20:28] thank you Lord
[2:20:29] let's stand and just lift our hands and
[2:20:31] thank the Lord
[2:20:33] he's got to expected end for us and he's
[2:20:36] providing everything we need Lord
[2:20:40] I sin daily
[2:20:42] it might be
[2:20:44] just a little thought it might be a
[2:20:46] little word that was said it might be
[2:20:48] something
[2:20:49] but I'm so thankful
[2:20:52] let the blood of Jesus Christ is here we
[2:20:54] can just wade into it we don't have to
[2:20:57] just touch a fingertip
[2:21:00] although one Speck one spot of blood is
[2:21:02] sufficient
[2:21:04] the heart of the believer says Lord Wash
[2:21:07] Me
[2:21:08] it's Peter about foot washing and said
[2:21:11] oh Lord don't just wash my feet
[2:21:13] wash my hands and my head also I want to
[2:21:17] wade into the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:21:19] because I have an expected end
[2:21:22] I was able to finish this race I was
[2:21:25] called to finish it you might say in a
[2:21:27] grand fashion
[2:21:28] amen
[2:21:30] not someone's testifying over my casket
[2:21:33] he tried to be a Christian
[2:21:36] they might not agree at all but have
[2:21:38] them be able to say
[2:21:40] I believe if I ever met a Christian
[2:21:43] this individual
[2:21:45] would be a Christian
[2:21:47] oh my brother and sister you've been
[2:21:49] called to carry the gospel to the end
