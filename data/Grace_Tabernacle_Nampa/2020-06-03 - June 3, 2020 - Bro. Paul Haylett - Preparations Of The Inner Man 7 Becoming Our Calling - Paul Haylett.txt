actually sister Donna rynason has invited everyone who can make it for their 50th anniversary party there's a flyer on the board in the back I think that's this Sunday at 7 no the 7th that's the seventh it's not that seven but I think it's right after a morning service so the time is on on that bulletin board if you want to take a look at that amen as we get ready to turn the service to brother Paul let's sing number nine twenty eight [Music] there are some people they cannot whether we are saved or whether all this way Russ but I was there and I get by I've never laid me bearable he forgave me put away my baby burden and it gave me peace with it brain fried baked out but I'm gonna shout it I was there when it happened and I guess I odd I don't care salvation is not free they argue they attend not me and the bowels let's go [Music] I was there when it happened and I guess Sion I would say me very low would be a heavy burden and he gave me peace with a vain tries to make it down but I'm gonna have it I was there when it happened and I guess I I was ever gonna say me very poor but he gave me but where the head burden and he gave me fits with it pay prize fake doubters but I'm gonna shout it probably when it happened and I guess I it saved me very cold he forgave me and he gave me down I was there when it happened dying inside and it's still happening amen he's still on the scene he's still moving he's still changing lives amen god bless you good to see each and every one of you amen well as we would just go once again following up on our preparations of the inner man this evening I want to just talk to you on the subject of becoming our calling amen so the call was made now the word is changing you and I and bringing us to a place we are becoming exactly what the word said we would be Amen don't doubt it just believe it Amen he promised it we experienced it and Lissa believe it it's going to come to its full work or completion amen well let's just stand this evening oh is it not working hmm well be like everything else I come today amen well let's turn in our Bibles to John the 1st chapter starting with verse 11 I believe it's very familiar Scripture to us in fact I kind of if someone was to say what is your favorite Scripture I'd have to say John one would fall right into that category just lovely very enlightening passages of Scripture amen let's just start in verse 11 and it says he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him now the beautiful thing is is we can count ourselves in that number Amen as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God so to those who didn't ever receive him they might have religious spirit they might be faithful in church they might believe there is a God but my brother and sister if they have not received him amen now we could go into a lot of things but I don't want to get sidetracked tonight but he said you know that when they come and said Lord did we not do many mighty works in thy name he says depart from me I never knew you amen and that's because they never truly received him they knew that God was real they knew that all these promises were real but they had never received the person of Jesus Christ amen but as many as received him to them gave he power now you stand here tonight I don't know what your day your week what is going on in your life but I want you to understand he's gave you the power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born hmm I like this because the spiritual DNA my brother and sister is much more important than a natural DNA which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord for your grace for your mercy Lord as we live out our lives father just realizing father that we make mistakes day by day circumstances arise father to know and have that confidence that your blood is more than sufficient Lord the work that you have begun will be finished and we stand Father upon that knowing that you are here present with us the Word made flesh once again we ask you to bless his service father Lord just take father every contrary thought that Satan might come in any spirits any sleepiness anything like that we bind all of that in the name of Jesus Christ thanking you Lord for this time in your name amen you may be seated now my brother and sister just to take a thought out of John one for just a moment as many as received him as they come into that personal relationship when God gives power to sons and daughters of God he didn't come and just hand us as it were a jar he didn't hand us a box he didn't hand us some kind of deal but it is there my brother and sister that some of the very first power that he gives to sons and daughters of God is that power to be able to come and recognize that this flesh must be subdued to recognize that we have to come into repentance and it takes a power my brother and sister I think you would agree with me that sometimes saying Lord forgive me or saying for forgive me to someone else actually takes a tremendous influence upon our life it's easy to just let it go away as though it never happened but to have the power to be able to say forgive me or to look to our Lord Jesus and say Lord I know that wasn't right remember the prophet of God told us you know that when the Holy Spirit comes down you do something wrong the Holy Spirit moves right in upon you starts to deal with you that's the time to repent hey man don't let Satan build up a bulwark around that I know from experience that if you leave it long enough you'll justify it amen you'll finally say well they really deserve this or that or whatever they deserve these words or our actions or whatever it might have been so what we want to do is always keep that slate clean amen so he gave us the power and that power my brother and sister the word shows us how it come down how the Holy Spirit moving upon us he sends his spirit back upon the people now my brother and sister we won't go into this tonight but the prophet of God shows us that the Holy Spirit moving on us is God himself some people you know would say well it's just the Holy Spirit no my brother and sister the Holy Spirit is gone whose spirit is it it's his spirit amen it's not an intermediary he didn't go find someone else and say hey go down there to do that my brother and sister it's God's Spirit on you and I Amen the Holy Ghost amen so it's there that as we recognize and this power starts to come to fruition my brother and sister it's not just a power to overcome the world many people live good godly lives their their dis various religions and and you know they don't smoke they don't drink they don't curse they don't do these things they're kind to their neighbor they're patient all of these virtues my brother and sister but they will not unless they have the Holy Ghost been filled with the Holy Ghost been born again they will not dwell in the presence of Almighty God so this is not just about overcoming a drinking habit of smoking habit a cursing habit uh whatever kind of thing this is the power to become sons of God amen that moves up beyond all of those things and moves into a whole nether realm well which we can come and the very life of Jesus Christ the very word of God comes in dwells in us and starts to guide our lives amen boy Satan sure don't like that does he amen and he will kick and he will scream and he will holler and he will drop every kind of roadblock he can but we have power to go beyond Satan's roadblock amen even to them that believe on his name now my brother and sister the Word of God shows us that you can't even really understand the Bible without the Holy Ghost so and we'll look at this and we say that the scripture says even to them that believe on his name I'm gonna step out you say well do you have something to prove it brother Paul only continuity of the word and that is my brother and sister you can't really believe on his name until revelation has struck you Amen so people are there they say well you know Jesus Christ is a healer but yet when put face to face they actually don't even believe he heals they can say God is present but then they might say where is he and these kind of things now look my brother and sister what we are there is to recognize our DNA to recognize that the pedigree that God has given to you and I now if we could look beyond the curtain of time look beyond the veil we would look out there and we could come and as it were just bear with me this evening please but we could go and step beyond the veil and come in there and they would be a great filing cabinet as it were probably because I'm that far behind on all of this stuff to some of you it might be a database on the computer but for me it's still a filing cabinet and so you could open that filing cabinet and in there you would find your pedigree think about it it would be declaring who your father's father's father's father was but you see in the natural there would be various names but in this spiritual you would open that up and pull out your pedigree and there would be only one name in there as your father amen we didn't have a father here and a father there we had one father from the creation of the earth amen to this moment right now and so we can look back and realize that we always as brother Branham says is what we always was in him he said if he wasn't always in him amen you wouldn't be in him now amen well some people might struggle over that but I just got saved I'm sorry you were always in him amen so it's there that we come to the place and we look at this now some people would disagree with what I'm fixing to say here my brother and sister the prophet of God told us showed us how the description have dual fold or trifold meaning and at the word verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen we beheld his glory the glory as of the only whole only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth the verse 14 can apply right here on this date in 2020 my brother and sister he is right here in the midst of his people being made flesh once again amen it's not you and I as it were a God with authority but we are here I mean God with power we are as God with authority because we come down and what we bind amen that wasn't just for some Minister what we bind on earth would be bound in heaven my brother's sister wasn't just for Martin Luther John Wesley or for brother branham or it was for sons and daughters of God that we can come into a place of authority what is it it's the preparation of the inner man and you know as well as I do it takes time and it takes struggle and if we're a faith is afraid to face the struggle my brother and sister if we're afraid to face the storm then we will not overcome amen you've got to be willing to stand up and say Lord whatever would come my way I might fall down but I will get up hey man I might not understand but I will pray for Revelation I will ask and I will be patient to receive Amen many times we get so impatient I say Lord what happened to us you know always use a telephone as an example you know it might be I won't throw it off on any of you but I think you all will be kind in the same boat you know I call my wife she doesn't answer for like what is wrong with her she has a telephone she needs to answer it she's not smiling but that's symbolic of the age that we've come in they've got a telephone they should answer well you know my brother and sister we approach God this way we ring him up come on answer I want an answer I don't want voicemail I don't want to wait I don't have to ask again I want an answer when a Satan is greatest tools gets us to the place we become impatient with our God all my brother and sister some people might say well you know I asked God for this and I asked God for that but he did not answer he did not come my brother and sister the problem is is we put God on our timetable and we need to get on God's timetable amen when we get on God's timetable we'll find that we will have some peace we will find have some joy because we can just settle down and say you know what I asked my motive was right my objective was right my desire of the depths of my heart was right now I know that God is faith and I'm just gonna sit back and I'm just gonna thank God for what he's going to do I'm gonna thank him for what he's done he's doing today I'm gonna thank him for what he's gonna do tomorrow because I want to be on God's timetable you know I've said this a little bit recently I don't mean to belabor it but that's where some of these doctrines have come in is because people weren't willing to wait for God's timetable so they had to move an important man and they had to give him more authority than the Word of God even gave him give to all these things to him and when that man says this is this then they jump right on that but my brother and sister let God manifest his own word a man as God's heir you know I just hearing brother Branham say you know God will interpret or God does interpret his own word he does not need you and I to interpret it he doesn't need us to come and take the front half of it quote the middle of that one and the last of that put it together and come up with some conclusion my brother and sister now this I say this a little bit in humor but I have seen a cow in a tree hey man I have seen a cow try to climb over a branch and a tree and get stuck there so you know you can get the cow up in the tree my brother and sister the problem is that isn't where the cow belongs no matter what kind of circumstance that you have done it's not for us to try and shift all of this it's for us to sit back and watch God move now when I ask you a direct question tonight is God moving or not amen and if we say God's not moving then my brother and sister it's not God that's got a problem it's you and I that's got a problem amen so as Paul is speaking here in Romans 1 and 11 amen he says for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end he may be established now my brother and sister pardon me but I've just got to you know just kind of bring this as he's coming there he's speaking to them I long to see you then I may impart to you some spiritual gift he was not coming to hand them something he did not come to hand them the teachings of Paul he did not come to give them Scrolls and this and that or some gift my brother and sister reminds me I say this humorous not to get to deeper serious tonight but it reminds me one time many many years ago net we went down to a missionary conference that was in Phoenix and after that they had a tour of Sabino Canyon they had visiting brother branham's house the den and some of those things that took place you know they went down to Tucson to do that brother Perry green and and I just remember we were there brother Lonnie gingka was there and and I thanked the Lord for that not lifting the man up but he had some special feeling for us and and he cared about us come many times to encourage the little group that was here and and was actually a catalyst for housebreaking our are out of our rotten and these sayings but I remember that you know just a pep talks of life I don't believe in double standards but my brother and sisters sometimes things just work in such a way and there was a family there and and you know their kids you know they have the little things you know don't go beyond this you know stay outside of these things here kind of roped off and these kids was up petting you know and trying to handle brother branham's gun and petting the caribou and you know and and brother George he was kind of coming to the end of his wits there and finally he was like you kids out of here and so you know they're like shocked like serious and he's like I said out of here so they they went out and it wasn't two minutes I look over and brother Lonnie's there standing and he's looking at something he just steps over the little barricade and he just walks right up there I think brother George went blind at that moment amen but you know there was like a reverence right he wasn't really trying to break the rules but there was a reverence there but you know these little kids there was a bowl right there on the desk just inside the door of the den and it had all these rocks in and brother George was very clear to tell everybody these are just rocks like brother branham liked to have he and he said these come from such-and-such rock shop downtown Tucson these are brother branham's rocks well a few minutes later here comes one of those little kids he sticks his head in the door and brother George is over there talking to us looking her there but I was on the angle the kid tiptoes in there dips to hands into them rocks gets him these big ol handfuls of rocks and tiptoes out of there and then Here Come his little sister she come right in behind it she got a handful of rock she's on the way out and brother George is like go out and stay out but my brother and sister you see somehow or another they took that rock that was just a common rock it was an anointed rock it wasn't blasted out of a mountain it wasn't prayed over by a prophet but they took that rock and put some kind of special significance to that rock and it becomes some kind of a focal point for them my brother and sister I never even pocketed a single one of them they came from a rock shop somebody would had to bought some more I didn't need to bring it home and add it to my collection amen but you see what happens is is if we come and somebody's imparting something many times if we're not careful as humans we we put a great importance upon what was imparted to us somebody gives a gift my brother and sister if no value I remember many years ago there was a brother I knew for certain that he was kind of struggling too he lived too high of a lifestyle had too many toys and struggling to pay his house payment and he brought a gun bought it bought a pistol for another brother named Anna minister and and I was sitting there as a young man and he gives this gift and that brother leaves and goes away and the Menace minister sitting there and he makes a statement he says well I don't know why he bought me this piece of junk I can buy stuff like this all day long see my brother and sister the gift that was imparted had no value to that individual amen but the man who gave it was doing it out of utmost respect to that individual you see so we have to be careful when we start looking at gifts and imparting zhh and whatever and when Paul come to the Romans my brother and sister he wasn't bringing them something that they could take and go home and put it on his shelf he was coming to impart of life amen he was coming to impart revealed word for their dates he was imparting to them the Spirit of Almighty God now the scripture my brother sister you go back in there and you go back in the Old Testament you don't find no reference of the Holy Ghost amen you come into the new testament of ways before you see reference of the Holy Ghost but you see God in his spirit upon man has always been present so whether you find the words Holy Ghost or not if God's Spirit has always come upon man hey man it was there that very same anointing would have been in the garden with Adam now God didn't come down my brother and sister and just come as a person to excuse me a person to a person God dealt with Adam in the spirit realm also amen he didn't send him a notice he didn't uh you know and videoconference and say hey now look you know that that animal with the long tail with a little hair on the end and all that here around his head you know with them cute little ears and then big aw he's a lion it was by the spirit a man by the anointing of God Adam knew what to speak and he was anointed by the Holy Ghost the very life of God to name the animals and name all specie and all flora and fauna now my brother and sisters will look at this and realize that Apostle Paul now had caught this revelation that he could impart the Spirit of God it wasn't like some free gift but it was imparting the knowledge of what the presence of God was in their life amen in other words how to unlock the door to have a greater portion of God amen how to unlock that and have that personal relationship say Paul wasn't given them a one step or two step or 10 step plan he was actually showing them that beyond the veil is where Christ was amen not out here not in ceremony not in your name being on a book not in the name of your church not in who you knew but to impart Christ himself to the people amen that the end you may be established see he wasn't trying to bring them to the Gospel of Paul even though God by His infinite wisdom chose to have Paul write the majority of the New Testament as an individual writer it was not the testimony of Paul it was the testimony of Jesus Christ and so the word being established to the people that they might recognize my brother and sister if you were shipwrecked tomorrow on an island there would be no reason for us to say I guess God has departed from us it would be for us to stop and say you know what there's a purpose that God has to be in this circumstance and I'm still gonna praise him I'm still gonna worship Him I'm still gonna pray I'm still you know if I don't have a Bible I'm gonna pray that God would bring the scripture back to my remembrance amen so to be able to have that practical outworking as the words brother Branham says now take that and look it up it'd be good because brother Browns talking about line upon line word upon word to take that as a practical outworking or is it something to debate my brother and sister I say we let it become the practical outworking well we hear preached amen I heard I'm not to throw accolades out in that sense but I haven't listened to it but I heard brother creats Kris preached a lovely sermon this Sunday amen we take that and we build that is now part of our foundation and then we add upon that we don't make it our only foundation we don't make it our cornerstone we don't make it all of that belongs to Christ but word upon word amen I read that quote to you the other day what pun word is what we must do see so faith cometh by hearing and we know what we are hearing the word see if we're hearing a map we're hearing a man's idea of man's content my brother and sister when the man runs out of Revelation then you will run out of Revelation but as Paul was wanting to impart to the Romans amen a spiritual gift God has imparted to you and I that very gift today hey men he sent a prophet to our day this is all well and good he spoke the word but my brother and sister just having the message will not mean that you've been imparted the spiritual gift I know that's a little straight but it's the truth people say we've got the message so we've got it no my brothers sister a lot of people got the message button was never imparted with a spiritual gift to understand that the Prophet was saying Amen because you see ultimately at the end my brother and sister it was God speaking amen we have to recognize that now what are we hearing well the word says that faith cometh by hearing the word Amen not just a preacher but the word Amen if we're just going because some men are great speakers my brother and sister flamboyant they can really lay things out good but if it's not anointed to touch you and then it will just be flamboyant preaching but what we want is the Holy Spirit right because the Prophet shows us how that your need and your desire is going to control what the preacher preaches amen that's not verbatim but you know what I'm saying he shows it my brother and sister you actually control the gift that's why I encourage with everything that is within me that we don't just come to church for the sake of coming to church you need to stop somewhere during your day of the previous days or even on Wednesday or if your days been your type in so busy maybe it might even be at the point of driving to church but I encourage you to open your mouth and say Lord I have this need I have this that I do not understand Lord I want to know you more and Lord anoint that man to speak what it is I need hear not what tickles my ears now what makes me happy not even necessarily what I agree with but let it be the truth and then I can take a hold of that and anchor upon that and then I will grow spiritually because there my brother and sister God doesn't come and say well you know what I gotta choose a certain man and he's the only one I impart my gift through my brother and sister that's nonsense but I'll tell you God will use certain people in a certain day a certain service a certain circumstance to impart the Word of Life amen you know you can come and you can have somebody you know this has happened to me I certainly don't put myself in the position of any importance but I've seen this happen that you know that the church and the ministry has been preaching they preach it straight they preach it strong and you know something will happen and then you get up and you just preach something that you think you slaughtered and it calls some little girl to get up and come to the altar and say I ain't been living right and I want to give my heart to the Lord you said this this and this and I can't get beyond that amen my brother and sister wasn't the man that spoke this this and this no it was God appointed the season to impart to that young woman initial anointing oh and why do you say initial brother Paul because you see if you don't follow through on that anointing it will fade away my brother and sister it's happened more than once people cry out go to the altar they repent but they don't follow through on that and they find themselves right back where they were and after a while that becomes the habit come on we've all been there and becomes a habit God moved on I'm so sorry and then we come and we fall right back to that position pretty soon we become calloused if you don't think so you just rub your finger on something long enough and then at first it's no big deal then it starts to hurt and then later it gets calloused come on being a callous Christians nothing to be proud about that's nothing to say all praise the Lord nothing fazes me well if you're talking about the devil's tactics then I say hallelujah but if you're talking of nothing fazes you there's calls of for concern hallelujah so is he doing he we're hearing the word my brother and sister I'll say this man never reveals anything man has never revealed anything revelation comes from the Lord amen thank God for revelation amen because that's God dealing with you my brother and sister that's God sharing himself that's God making us it were the introduction to say you know what this is a picture of me Amen Alleluia now to impart I just want to touch on this before I move on Amen is to give something such as a quality to a thing to make something known to someone to give convey or grant from or as if from a store communicate the knowledge of you see Paul was coming to communicate the knowledge that was necessary for you and I to know we are sons of God Amen not just a religion not just a thought but he come to convey to us by the preaching of the word Amen Paul didn't say now he makes reference in in the in the Bible Paul does about reading scrolls and stuff but my brother and sister we're looking at the very word of God and he come to impart to them or give them the knowledge he wasn't saying now come and listen to this or read that he was preacher Paul was a preacher come on let's not let's not get away from that let's not forget Paul was a preacher Amen God sent a prophet to this day my brother and sister he was a preacher he didn't get up there and make all the heat that he makes references but he didn't get up and make a lot of references now go read this over here and go read this book over here and go no my brother and sister he preached this gospel amen and he preached it with power and authority hallelujah Oh bye you see God give His Word and God sent his men because God has something to impart to you and I hallelujah not just so we got the message my brother and sister now look some people feel like you know and I don't want to ruffle no feathers but I is just too good of example I'm not going to go away from it but you know my brother and sister people say well it appears you're going away from the message they spoke this to brother Paul it seems like you're going beyond brother branham you know when I at the time I answered that and said no we're not but you know the more I think about it Amen I am and I ain't well how's that for a two-sided conversation I am and I ain't God sent him as a prophet to our day it's this word that's restoring us Mac but he said I'm gonna decrease and he's going to increase and so at some point oh if I could put it correctly now you know I don't want to be judged by this because I'm not trying to make it a judgmental thing but at some point brother branham will diminish in our eyesight and Christ Himself will increase amen are you with me Church don't want anybody to misunderstand it doesn't mean that one person is being put away or put down or shoved out of the scene it is showing that the preeminence that was preached which was Christ is rising up in the vision of the people Amen what is happening he's imparting to us who we look to Amen who we admire who we door and to realize my brother and sister now you know this goes into all kinds of other things and people get all upset about it but my brother and sister when the prophet of God stood in the pulpit and said thus saith the Lord who was speaking if they'd been brother branham you said thus saith William Branham but it's thus saith the Lord amen we have to recognize that my brother and sister as a vessel he come and did exactly the same thing Paul was doing he come to impart he come to give that gift wasn't his gift but he was imparting it I say thank you or thank you Lord hallelujah amen see God sent his men God had something to impart to you and I amen what is it the ability to tap into a higher life amen see we don't want to be you know this is a thing I said this once and boy this is a few years ago got all kinds of flack and I made a statement then I was coming to a place where maybe I was going to move on say that I followed or believed the message because I had become such a broad connotation so many people people that would about carjacked you arm rob you people that would lie to you people that would rip you off in business said I believe the message where does that value come in my brother and sister and I was really I have to admit I was really discouraged at that time you know about everybody's I believe the message I believe the message you know what we're really looking for was those that wanted to live the message amen not just talk about it or not just have the title of it because to me it had almost declined to the place of saying I'm a Baptist not picking on no Baptist got some really good friends that are Baptists I'm Nazarene I'm Lutheran I'm Catholic whatever it might have been I'm Pentecostal you see when we come to the place that we start to hang a title on there if there's no life behind the title amen my brother and sister jet fuel should have enough to power the jet if it doesn't have enough to power the jet it can't be called jet fuel now the Word of God coming my brother and sister is God's message so Laodicea and if we diminish the power of the word to Laodicea can we come to the place and it doesn't line up that we say it's the message it's someone's message oh my you know what I think Paul probably preached about this straight I don't think he buttered it up my brother and sister I had an uncle years ago he loved popcorn every night he had a big chair turned on the evening news he eaten supper already and my aunt would just carry this bowl of popcorn in and set it in his lap and my uncle used to say if you're having buttered popcorn and there's no evidence of the butter in the bowl it wasn't buttered popcorn I've seen him as a kid tell my aunt hey Margie you forgot the butter I buttered it no you forgot the butter she'd come get it go in there melt more butter pour all over it my brother and sister if there's no evidence in us then the message wasn't present are you with me there's got to be evidence in the bowl the vessel that the Holy Ghost was present amen we can't just say it was there oh I'll tell you what had good times as a child with my aunt uncle Amen now look my brother and sister what God is asking or giving to us is the ability to tap into the supernatural in second Peter 1:11 he says for so an entrance amen I want you to see this will just take a second it's a little confusing because we had we had another Romans 111 and then we come down here second Peter 111 now I want you to read this for yourself just maybe you can catch the emphasis that we're trying to make tonight as as they bring that up you look at this now I'll read it to you but I want you to read it for yourself in a second second Peter 1:11 for so an entrance shall be recorded transcribed repeated ministered and then for so an entrance shall be ministered why at the preaching of the word faith cometh by hearing hearing the Word of God Amen so there's where it comes from so an entrance shall be ministered unto you in a small portion to show you that there is an everlasting Kingdom no my brother and sister this is the position that God is reaction revealing in many cases people that say we know this brother Paul what are you preaching about we forgot to include the abundant part we forgot to come to the place that this is not just a little dinky entrance that is there my brother and sister we're talking now the world that struggles out here people who aren't sure where they set concerning the Lord and their salvation may they have this where straight is the way and narrow is the gate but my brother and sister do you want to know that the bride of Jesus Christ whose names on the Lamb's Book of Life that a entrance doesn't look like a little sliver of a shadow that entrance to a son or daughter of God looks very big because the revelation that lumen AIT's the way in is so incredible to a son or daughter of God that while it might be very narrow in the life that is lived if one is living the life the entrance is obvious are you with me Amen when you are living the life the entrance is obvious I say thank you Lord we're not going along as it were trying to find some sliver of a way to get in my brother and sister it's so those who are not living the life the gate closes down so narrow they can't find it nobody's just going to stagger into heaven as though they are lost which reminds me how it was when we used to have church out on Garrety Amen there was a bar moved into the at far into that strip mall a bar moved in there and that bar was so much popular we gained one or two people in the church during that time and the bar took over every building right down to us and we would be having church you remember that sister sue we'd be having church and the door would open up and here would be these dudes with a long net beer bottle in their hand they'd stagger and they'd be like sorry stagger out my brother his sister nobody's going to just stagger into heaven but sons and daughters of God that got the Holy Ghost anointed and it's been given to them and abundant Oh hallelujah amen we can see clearly who we are we see clearly that the word has come down this is not just some debate of what this scripture means and what this scripture means this is life poured into the Bride of Christ this is revelation born into this bride and all she can see is Jesus Christ she's now walking to the world she's not walking to wealth and fame she's not walking to popularity all she sees is Jesus Christ but Satan would come when we have good days bad days we sometimes struggle he tries to say this is who you are no I'm telling you who I am when I look up and I see my Lord Jesus that's who I am because an entrance has administered not will be some day it has been ministered hallelujah the prophets spoke heed and God has anointed men to come in the hour we live in catch the revelation of what the prophets spoke and the brother branham even makes a statement he says now you know I hope you get you know just I'm paraphrasing it I hope you get what I didn't say come on why why how can he say that how can I understand what the Prophet did not say because the entrance has been being ministered day after day week after week year after year the men Ennis the entrance has been ministered to us and we come to something my brother and sister and we look at that and we're able to say you know what this is the line upon the line this is the precept upon the precept this is the word upon the word and it's all tied together I'm not gonna argue over it I'm gonna say Amen to it and I'm gonna let it minister unto me abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom I don't want just enough to get to the gate I don't want my vision as time goes on I'll tell you it's funny you talk about vision now I was working a couple days ago on some things and you know it was like okay take my glasses off and I get my face right up here about this close and then I couldn't get my face that close I put my glasses on I still can't see and I take them off I can't see it oh it's like oh it's miserable but I've got something beyond two pieces of glass that's all or plastic that they somehow made it so I can see I've got something that opened up abundantly to me and all I see now is my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hallelujah there's no other vision of this what other vision can we have hallelujah so can we say amen to that abundant Amen I believe it's been ministered unto us abundantly all you have to do you know I find it kind of almost eerie the rising of the Sun you haven't listened to it lately listen to it it was preached yesterday you know or maybe we could say it was preached today come on it's almost eerie it's almost eerie what was preached 1965 and it's I think it's more pertinent right now than it was then oh my brother and sister but this is what God was doing all these years it was all the message that was preached and all the foundation it wasn't to give us this is some little token portion this wasn't come to just give us enough that kind of give our family religion this come to give us an entrance into the presence of Almighty God hallelujah amen let's go to second Timothy 2:20 amen been in a great house there's not only vessels of golden of silver but also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor you see my brother and sister this right here shows us very much that there is a very distinct difference not only of gold and silver and wood and of Earth but of honor and dishonor you see God has given now many people I'm afraid I read a quote the other day I shared it I believe with the church here brother I'm talking about how that people oh that would have been Wednesday night people you know the young lady I still love the Lord but I just can't live this I don't my excuse me ah the problem my brother and sister is you've got to zero in on what you are here now this is not pardon my presumption 'us but this is not us dart going I think I'll try and be oh I'm silver are you with me you know it's like a little joke man put a dart board on the wall gave his wife a dart and said wherever the dart hits it was a dart board but he had it marked he said wherever it hits is where we're going on vacation she said I guess we're spending three weeks behind the fridge come on my brother and sister this is not for us to decide on gold I hope I'm silver for the bride of Jesus Christ she needs to say you know what I am what God made me to be but I'm gonna claim that I am gold amen and if I'm not gold out definitely silver and if I owe the other parts the hard one because if I'm whipped and I'm serving God I'll be okay with that but honor and dishonor are the polar opposites you can't just say well if I'm not honored I guess I'll be all right being Dishonored no doesn't work that way you see we can take this and say you know what these might be levels of God's calling in one's life you know gold silver wood Earth whatever those could be levels it just bear with me no those could be callings in our life of what God called us to do but my brother's sister when it gets down to the honor and the dishonor my goodness he's saying nobody knows me in the whole you know body of the bride of Jesus Christ I'm not known my brother and sister that's irrelevant just be honorable amen show the honor show that Christ is alive and well amen he didn't call us to just kind of blunder along through life and whatever is is is I hear people say that all the time well God's in control and whatever I am I am well my brother and sister what about your voice and what about God saying you know what you bind on earth you can bind in heaven I am gold and I am a vessel of Honor Amen Lord forgive me for the times I would fall short of that but my cry my confession my testimony is I am a vessel of gold and I am here to honor God hallelujah now some people think I'm presumptuous maybe I am but I tell you what my brother and sister I believe God's give us the opportunity to step in to the role as a supernatural being he spoke it before the foundation of the world he opened the door he gave the gift he imparted now it's up to us whether we want to really accept that reminds me one time of a story I read about a young man when he was a kid he told his dad he said daddy I'm gonna I'm gonna be a professional baseball player and the dad side of the story was he said I saw many kids that were much more gifted could judge the ball to hit it throw straighter throw farther run faster and I thought there's no way on earth my son will ever be a professional baseball player but you know he noticed going into junior high and on into high school that his son would ask the coach can I stay in you know use the pitching machine and hit more balls and you'd find him in the backyard using a rebounder and throwing the ball and ground in it and and it seemed like it was obsessed and people started speaking to him like you know your son might be a little obsessive of this you know thing that he confesses and when he went in and finished up high school and was pretty much on par with most everybody went to a regular kind of normal school in college and by his testimony is as it was God's blessing he got a coach that was patient and encouraging and he kept telling his coach I'm gonna be a professional baseball player and the coach looked him right in the face and said ok if you're gonna be a professional this is what you've got to do oh he didn't baby him oh sure you are and he didn't cut him down and say you don't got it come on let's get this come on we're not here to put levels of your more spiritual that one's more spiritual that one's not this one's going to make it not one's not we're here this is what you got to do if you're going to make it hallelu you're gonna keep your eyes upon the goal amen in this case you got to keep your eyes on the ball I don't care if you're playing in the outfield and the ball is in the infield you keep your eyes on the ball and by the time he got halfway through College he was outstanding he was better and then the players he played with and his coach told him you need to go I believe it was in Oklahoma you need to go to to the main university because you have exceeded the level of the rest of your team and you need people to challenge you and he moved over there to that University and that coach was a tyrant and he told him if you ever think you're even going to make this team you've got to improve and he was devastated and he ran more fielded more balls hit more balls worked out in the weight room more because his coach was there what he didn't catch was the reverse of the psychology that was there and the coach saw here is someone who has something but he if you go out of college into the big leagues he's gonna make it up to another level and he didn't baby a problem is my brother and sister we like to be preached that we're all in the rapture want to be preached that we've all got all this revelation and we've got the message how about we come to a place you'd be patient enough for me to tell you you need to move up a level you need to give a little more you need to try a little harder how dare you talk to me that way posture I believe this message I've got the Holy Ghost I don't care what you got I want you to make it so bad I'm gonna goad you I'm gonna push you I'm not gonna beg you and I'm not gonna hand you a candy bar come on Saints because we might be the catalyst that causes a brother or a sister to realize there is a higher plane there is a higher calling I know my brother he's not trying to play spiritual games with us and God's moving on him I want to go where he's going I want to make the team and that young man he almost got discouraged and quit and his dad told him he says son if you quit now you're saying that your dream was a lie you talk about blunt do I say people are like well the Lord revealed to me twenty nine and a half years ago this message was real but this last summer I got to reading some Stafford doesn't appear that that revival in Africa that brother broom talked about ever come to pass it doesn't appear that this over here happened and brother Branham told the story about the same event seven different ways I've been deceived I'm done with the message well you're either lying right now or you are lying twenty nine and a half years ago some part some part you were lying oh you wonder about that revival in Africa now I don't know where they all stand I've only been to the civilized part of Africa but my brother and sister when you go to towns like Consortium and everywhere you go message believers walking the streets Sunday morning there might be somewhere close to fifty thousand believers not all in one church many churches Kinshasa has many large churches I don't know maybe maybe maybe I've got that messed up but there's a revival taking place but wherever there's two well can grace have a revival amen grace can have a revival hallelujah my brother and sisters you see we got to decide who we are and what we are hallelujah I joked with Gary she thought I was using reverse psychology I said I'm gonna preach a long time tonight she's like laughed and said oh I like it I like it thank you Lord now you see my brother and sister we have the opportunity step into being a supernatural being or we can occupy the position of I'm the downtrodden nobody likes me nobody loves me nobody understands me nobody agrees with me we can become in the position of the downtrodden you can be the defeated Christian as long as you want you can decide you know I'm just whooped on I'm beaten or whatever now I've used this reference before so please forgive me it sounds like I'm being redundant but my brother my sister the world had its occupy wallstreet amen they're doing something of the same nature right now that same spirit you know blocked the streets you know I noticed in my computer feed some guy down in Texas they they blocked the freeway and some guy in a dually truck pulling a big stock trailer just plowed through the crowd amen so far as I know they haven't arrested him or anything because actually according to the law those suits stand in the middle of the highway are the ones breaking the law amen now we're not supposed to run over fellow citizens but still my brother and sister you know it's kind of a deal but the world had its Occupy Wall Street you know and they were making their statement that we're going to come and we're going to show you the anti-establishment and we're going to you know express who we are what we're doing and the authority we have but you know when I say my brother and sister I'd like to start a movement amen I like to start a movement right now and that movement would be maybe we just pick a title for it it would be occupy the New Jerusalem amen let that show and let us come together and let's have our crowd let's have our deal and let's show them the authority that we've been given Amen that we could move right into a position we can occupy that position in spite of everything Satan's got to say about it we can occupy that and say this is my position amen I have been given an abundant opening into the kingdom of God amen I don't have to sit back and this hope that I will make it I'm going to start this movement and I'm claiming my spot in the New Jerusalem amen I'll tell you what my brother and sister it won't happen if somebody's going to be hungry enough they'll desire to fill that position hey man I'm gonna occupy the New Jerusalem hallelujah amen now look I want to hurry along Romans 9:22 through 26 amen what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction so this whole class my brother and sister these vessels that are of dishonor that God is still being patient amen might be waiting for you and I and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had afore prepared unto his glory Oh ma'am we've been prepared already my brother and sister even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles as he said also in Oh see I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them you know not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God hallelujah God is opening this up to us right now my brother and sister the people God is patient with these people but the wrath amen the cup of iniquity in my mind it's got to be already overflowing I don't know I've quit trying to decide whether it's the days of Sodom or not it might go on another 10 years I cannot even fathom what that will be like but my brother and sister I'm pretty sure this Sodom was pretty wicked amen it wasn't just a walk in the dark when people start trying to bash your door down to molest the guests in your house come on pretty wicked let's see we're coming to this time jumping back to our original Scripture but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of God amen the word is telling us that there is power that has already been released and there is power that is being released right now hey man we're not sitting here with a powerless message we're not sitting here with a dead message we're not sitting here looking back my brother and sister I love to read I said sometimes in my chair I get tears in my eyes my heart just just palette eights you know just I just like oh my what that would be when you read or hear these things of the prophet of God dealing with spirits and dealing with people giving deliverance to them talking about relatives that are not even there and just as it was in the scripture basically telling them go home they have been healed in the name of Jesus Christ all my brother and sister that publican that man when he come to Jesus and he believed and he went and started home and one from his house meet him and says your child lives my brother and sister he believed and his household believed and there was something supernatural took place come on we don't want to sit back yes and we believe this message yes daughter we believe this message put it on display let it be living let the word come that there is power in house of God there is power in sons and daughters of God reminds me of a story I read recently about a man I don't know what become of it but he was a read a book on day trading and he obviously had a lot more money than you and I cuz he had like had luck up there and there's seven-figure money to start with and he started day trading and he made a series obviously didn't understand what he was doing he made a series of decisions and when they went backwards the Wall Street deal or whatever come to him and I don't remember the number I don't want to exaggerate to you but it was scary they come back to him said you owe us 11 million dollars I'm not worth 11 million dollars that's your problem you owe us I'll have a million dollars my brother and sister you see we've been given a book we don't have to speculate are you with me we don't got to speculate what it's going to take to make a rapture amen we've got the preparation of the inner man we've come to the place my brother and sister we have everything we need to become our calling we have everything and we don't need an excuse well well are our children or teenagers good what a wonderful time to introduce them to the power of Almighty God that God can see it alive in our church that God can see it alive in our home see it mom and dad see it and brothers and sisters see it there what a wonderful time for them at the Lord tarries to be able to go on and say as a young person I met Jesus Christ he's alive he's well he said he would do it and he does it hallelujah we don't have to sit back and say I just hope I just hope how about some confidence amen Oh hallelujah well look I'm gonna disclose right here you see there's a power that's being released you know we've heard and we've preached about the powers of darkness and certainly Satan is a force to be dealt with but what the word say said we would vanquish every enemy not just some of them not just the easy ones every enemy come on my brother and sister every enemy vanquish means to defeat thoroughly hallelujah not call a truce with them oh look there's power that's being released do you know what the greatest powers that I see is that people are struggling with in this hour right now there's the power of repentance amen if we're not careful we'll carry things because it's hard to say Lord forgive me it's hard to say brother-sister husband wife children come on my brother and sister a power to keep us from sinning it's here we don't have to be like the the the waves tossed to and fro amen I was watching a little video clip of a boat out I believe it was maybe our story Oregon and the caption says on that day that there was high surf warnings and recommendation the boats don't leave the harbor but these guys were determined to leave the harbor and as they started to plow out there my brother and sister they didn't even hardly make it out of the harbor gate and they were on the radio Mayday Mayday we're sinking all they had to do is stop heed the warning the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run in - and they are say Oh hallelujah all they had to do is heed the warning that says small boats don't leave the harbour my brother and sister we have the power to become our calling we don't have to sit here and hope we don't have to sit here and guess we don't have to sit here now this is probably going to throw somebody you don't have to sit here and pray are you with me don't wanna I don't want to trip you God's already given it he's already promised already explained to us what would happen we don't even have to if you follow what I'm saying you don't even have to pray oh lord please please please he's already gave it to you receive what he has already given to us hey man I don't want anybody be confused or you'll understand it when I was saying Amen but people are like Oh Lord play I want I want oh please help me look no my brother and sister it's time just what the Prophet said about healing Amen if he was even right here he couldn't do one thing more because he's already healed you hey man he's already given his word and revealed it into the Bride of Christ you say how can you say that brother Paul because the prophet of God said everything this is a paraphrase everything you need for the rapture is already in you amen you don't got to run off somewhere and find it we don't gotta find somebody you know that's down there we got a man down here you know in Puerto Rico that you know claims that he's now the incarnation or whatever the last revealed word it he's got 17 or 18 thousand people that are following him down there they have all kinds of issues everything from child abuse to sexual abuse and this is the revealed word of the hour my brother and sister that's not the revealed word of the hour that's a man who's trying to say you got to look to me to get to God my brother and sister the word has been opened it's been given come on it's been given my brother and sister it's time for us to take the preparation that God has been giving us and stand upon that and say you know what this is what the word said I just simply believe it I might not even be able to tie it all together I might be able to explain it people say well that's a nonsense is it I fly on an airplane every once in a while you can explain the dynamics of how wing works right right you all understand how wing works amen the wind beneath my wings no the song wouldn't be the same if it said the vacuum above my wings come on my brother and sister we've got the word step out and become your calling amen how do you do that brother Paul just line upon line precept upon precept word upon word hallelujah we're not going to have some special flash you're not gonna you know get up in the morning and there'll be a flash and suddenly you have revelation you see God's working how does that song go you know help me sister Emmie why don't you come and then that'll get me to stop preaching the word is working mightily in my church I love that song the word is working mightily in the ministry hallelujah it's working mightily in me amen that's how we become our calling let the word loose amen okay well we made it off the first page in that wonderful amen you know Philippians 2:15 16 says that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation I'm surprised they didn't put United States in there among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth oh I hope you catch this what are we holding forth I'm a message believer know my brother and sister the word of life you see there's that whole troubling thing guy who won't darken the door of a church says I'm a message believer and says say only what the Prophet said [Music] find you good Holy Ghost filled Church go to church be found faithful at your post of duty that's not word for word but that's what he said hypocrites at church [Music] I've done some extensive research everywhere I go I find Hippocrates but the only ones that are important are the ones at church because we can rub shoulders with all the rest of them because you realize that they held that same axiom they'd never go to a grocery store and they'd never go to a gas station never the bank come on I'm being humorous but I want you to catch the reality of this you see Saints holding forth of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain you see the Word of God cannot return void can I say that louder the Word of God can not return void now there's always two sides to every coin my daddy taught me when I was a child he says son there's three sides to every story everybody says they're suicides they're story two sides to every story but I wish you hadn't taught me this it's caused me a lot of grief in my life he says son they're right but they're wrong because there's three sides to every story their side and their side and the absolute truth let's not shoot for their side or our side or someone else's sign let's shoot for the absolute truth hallelujah let's just stand praise the Lord brother Jason come hallelu you got a little bit more pure but I think it's maybe just a tad bit redundant amen can I read the quote real quick I just had one closing quote hey man Jesus on the authority of the word well that's a title isn't it amen you see what I mean others we could refer to but people Christianity and the way they have it today is so shallow no wonder the unbeliever can hardly see how to believe Christianity because it's no more than a form but Christianity is real in its power and if it's just ceremonial any other any other ceremony would take its place now my brother said please don't misunderstand me I've shared with you my friend they tried to talk me into draggin you guys all off some other direction and my pledge that I made to him that if I sigh and find something better than the message I'm gone [Music] don't get nervous don't get nervous amen because it's not until I find something better and better would mean closer to God hmm are you with me amen but look if it's just ceremonial any other ceremony would take its place I have nothing against lodges masonry Oddfellows any of them would be just as well if its ceremony it has it's good and bad just like the church but Christianity is a living being in man kind hallelujah and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us Oh hallelujah that's a proof of the resurrection of God's Son who was God with us oh my lelou you hallelujah we'll just stop right there if you don't mind well hallelujah there is power power miss power power wonder-working power in the love ah there power wonder-working power in the precious love the line Oh we'll give me free from the burden of sin there's power in the blood power in the

ain't out in the precious love [Music] Wow what the line wonderful in the precious blood [Music] allelujah you know that song reminds me of a portion I skipped over here but my brother and sister Satan would just love to come and show you your own personalized yoke of bondage now he'd come to you and he's not lying saying this is your yoke and you wore it for years now you need you lost it along the way back here you misplaced it but I picked it up and I brought it along for a few years for you here because this is your Jochen and I'm just doing you a favor to return your yoke back to you well I'll tell you what my brother and sister when we recognize there's power in the you take a hold to that yoke of bondage you say oh I don't want nothing to do with that no go ahead go ahead take a hold to that yoke of bondage I break it in the name of Jesus Christ you see when you break the yoke all Satan can do is come back to you and say here's the pieces of your yoke of bondage hallelujah well let's give it back to him broken tonight Lord we're cuttin freedom in the name of Jesus Christ for every need physical mental spiritual financial family children we claim it in the name of Jesus Christ and Satan we return back to you the yoke broken never to be worn again hallelujah scripture says they come to spy out our Liberty to try to turn things to get you back to that
