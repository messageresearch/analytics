[0:12] [Music]
[2:58] Thank you.
[3:05] [Music]
[7:37] Jesus my redeemer.
[7:42] There is no more
[7:45] for heaven now to give.
[7:50] He is my joy,
[7:53] my righteousness and freedom.
[7:59] My steadfast love,
[8:02] my deep and boundless peace.
[8:07] To this I hope
[8:10] my hope is only Jesus.
[8:16] For my life
[8:19] is holy bound to him.
[8:24] Oh, how strange and divine.
[8:28] I can sing. All is mine, yet not I, but
[8:35] through Christ
[8:37] in me.
[8:40] The night is dark,
[8:43] but I am not forsaken.
[8:48] For by my side,
[8:51] the Savior, he will stay.
[8:57] I labor on in weakness and rejoiceing.
[9:05] For in my need,
[9:08] his power is displayed.
[9:13] To this I hold.
[9:16] My shepherd will defend me.
[9:23] Deepest
[9:25] valley he will lead.
[9:29] [Music]
[9:30] Oh the night has been one. And I shall
[9:36] overcome
[9:38] yet not I but through Christ
[9:43] in me.
[9:46] No fate I dread.
[9:49] I know I am forgiven.
[9:54] The future sure
[9:57] the price it has been paid.
[10:02] For Jesus bled
[10:05] and suffered for my pardon.
[10:10] And he was raised
[10:13] to overthrow the grave.
[10:18] To this I hope
[10:21] my sin has been defeated.
[10:24] [Music]
[10:27] Jesus now
[10:29] and ever is my plea.
[10:35] Oh the chains are released. I can sing I
[10:41] am free yet not I but through Christ
[10:48] in me
[10:51] with every breath
[10:54] I long to follow Jesus
[10:59] for he has said
[11:02] that he will bring me home
[11:07] and day a by day.
[11:10] I know he will renew me
[11:16] until I stand
[11:19] with joy before the throne.
[11:24] To this I hope
[11:27] my hope is only Jesus.
[11:33] All the gloryy
[11:36] ever more to him.
[11:39] [Music]
[11:41] When the race is complete, still my lips
[11:47] shall repeat yet not I, but through
[11:52] Christ
[11:54] in me.
[11:57] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[12:03] God bless you this morning. It's good to
[12:04] have each one of you here. Amen. I'm
[12:07] going to have us stand. I was thinking
[12:10] of the words of this song this morning.
[12:11] Uh number 649 at the cross.
[12:17] I just sometimes words I don't love
[12:20] words. Words are interesting. But how
[12:25] last and did my savior bleed and did my
[12:27] sovereign die? Would he devote that
[12:28] sacred height? Such a worm.
[12:30] I love that word because it's so
[12:32] descriptive. Amen. What was it? I was a
[12:35] worm, man. Hallelujah.
[12:38] Amen. Alas,
[12:42] and did my savior
[12:45] bleed? And did my sovereign die?
[12:52] Could he devote that sacred head for
[12:59] such a worm as I?
[13:04] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[13:09] saw the light and the burdens of my
[13:12] heart rolled away.
[13:16] It was there by faith I received my
[13:21] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[13:28] Was it for crimes that I have done? He
[13:34] groaned upon the tree.
[13:40] Amazing
[13:42] pity,
[13:43] grace unknown, and love beyond
[13:49] the degree.
[13:51] At the cross, at the cross, where I
[13:55] first saw the light and the burdens of
[13:59] my heart rolled away.
[14:04] There by faith I received my sight and
[14:10] now I am happy all the day.
[14:15] Well might the sun in darkness high and
[14:22] shut his glories in.
[14:27] And Christ the mighty
[14:31] maker died for man the creature sin.
[14:39] At the cross at the cross where I first
[14:44] saw the light and the burdens of my
[14:47] heart rolled away.
[14:51] It was there by faith I received my
[14:56] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[15:03] But drops of grief can never repay the
[15:10] debt of love I owe.
[15:15] Dear Lord, I give myself
[15:20] away is all that I can do.
[15:27] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[15:32] saw the light and the burdens of my
[15:35] heart rolled away.
[15:39] It was there by faith. I received my
[15:44] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[15:52] Amen.
[15:55] Amen. Number 885. In Christ alone my
[15:58] hope is found.
[16:02] You can have your seats. I'm not going
[16:03] to keep you standing. I have to stand,
[16:06] but you guys can sit down.
[16:11] In Christ alone
[16:15] my hope is found.
[16:19] He is my light, my strength,
[16:23] my song.
[16:25] This corner stone,
[16:28] this solid ground,
[16:32] firm through the fiercest drought
[16:35] and storm.
[16:38] What heights of love?
[16:41] What depths of peace?
[16:44] When fears are still,
[16:48] when striving seed,
[16:51] my comforter,
[16:54] my all in all
[16:58] here in the love of Christ
[17:02] I stand.
[17:05] in Christ alone
[17:08] who took on flesh,
[17:12] fullness of God in helpless
[17:16] bab.
[17:18] This gift of love
[17:21] and righteousness
[17:23] [Music]
[17:25] scorned by the ones he came
[17:28] to save.
[17:31] Still on that cross
[17:34] as Jesus died,
[17:37] the wrath of God
[17:40] was satisfied
[17:44] for every sin.
[17:47] On him was laid.
[17:50] Here in the death of Christ
[17:54] I live.
[17:57] There in the ground
[18:00] his body lay,
[18:04] light of the world by darkness
[18:08] slain.
[18:10] Then bursting for
[18:14] glorious day
[18:17] up from the grave he rose
[18:21] again.
[18:23] And as he stands
[18:26] in victory,
[18:29] sin's curse has lost
[18:32] its grip on me.
[18:36] For I am him
[18:39] and he is mine,
[18:42] bought with the precious blood
[18:46] of Christ.
[18:49] No guilt in life,
[18:52] no fear in death.
[18:56] This is the power of Christ
[19:00] in me.
[19:02] From life's first cry
[19:05] till final breath.
[19:09] Jesus commands my destiny.
[19:14] No power of hell,
[19:18] no scheme of man
[19:21] can ever pluck
[19:24] me from his hand
[19:27] till he returns
[19:31] or calls me home.
[19:34] Here in the power of Christ
[19:38] I'll stand.
[19:41] Amen.
[19:44] Amen. I love that last part. No power of
[19:46] man or no scheme of man can ever pluck
[19:48] me from his hands. Praise God for that.
[19:50] Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:53] Amen. Um we haven't sang this song in a
[19:56] while. I just want to sing the chorus.
[19:58] Number 990.
[20:00] God with us. Just the chorus though. I'd
[20:02] tried the rest of it or sister Ruth and
[20:07] wasn't there.
[20:09] These words have just been echoed in my
[20:11] heart lately. All that is within me
[20:12] cries for you alone to be glorified.
[20:14] Praise God. Amen.
[20:18] All that is within me cry for you alone
[20:26] be glorified.
[20:28] Immanuel
[20:31] [Music]
[20:32] God with us.
[20:37] My heart it sings a brand new song. My
[20:42] debt is paid. These chains are gone.
[20:47] Emmanuel,
[20:51] God with love
[20:55] and all that is within me cry. For you
[21:01] alone be glorified.
[21:05] Emmanuel,
[21:09] God with all
[21:12] [Music]
[21:14] my heart it sings a brand new song. A
[21:19] man has played. These chains are gone.
[21:23] Emmanuel,
[21:26] God with us.
[21:29] [Music]
[21:31] More time. And all that is within me
[21:36] cries. For you alone be glorified.
[21:43] Emmanuel,
[21:46] God with all
[21:48] [Music]
[21:52] my heart. It sings a brand new song. My
[21:56] debt is paid. These chains are gone.
[22:01] Emmanuel,
[22:03] [Music]
[22:04] God with us.
[22:07] [Music]
[22:10] Amen.
[22:12] Amen. Is that what your heart's crying
[22:14] for this morning? For him to be
[22:15] glorified, be lifted up. Praise God.
[22:20] Amen. Let's just stand. I don't have any
[22:22] prayer requests written down this
[22:24] morning, but
[22:27] [Music]
[22:28] I remember our brother Paul over there
[22:30] in Monmouth speaking for the saints
[22:33] there.
[22:34] [Music]
[22:38] I want to remember um
[22:41] I think we talked about it on Wednesday
[22:42] night, my nephew Matthew. Amen.
[22:46] Just for Josiah and Michelle trying to
[22:48] decide how to handle this and some
[22:50] leadership in their lives. Amen.
[22:53] I know many others here, Gideon, Brother
[22:56] Trevor, Sister Carrie, your kids, others
[23:00] just they've been on my heart so much
[23:01] lately and just been praying for them.
[23:05] Amen.
[23:07] If you have a need this morning,
[23:11] lift your hands to him.
[23:14] [Music]
[23:16] He's already provided.
[23:19] Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[23:22] Gracious heavenly father, as we come
[23:24] before you this morning, Lord Jesus,
[23:28] Lord, how we love you,

[23:33] in my heart lately, Lord. All that is
[23:36] within me cries for you to be glorified,
[23:38] Lord Jesus.
[23:40] So, Lord, so we lift you up this
[23:42] morning, Lord. How thankful we are,
[23:44] Lord. not just another service, Lord
[23:46] God, but a another opportunity to come
[23:48] together and unite our hearts
[23:52] around your word and around you, Lord
[23:53] Jesus. That you would be praised, Lord
[23:57] God. That you would be glorified amongst
[23:59] us, Lord Jesus, in the singing and in

[24:30] few things I've mentioned this morning,

[24:36] Lord, God,
[24:40] Lord, just pray that you just in each
[24:42] one of their lives,
[24:44] [Music]
[24:45] Lord, I know when I was younger and
[24:49] had these times, Lord Jesus,
[24:52] Lord, the first song we sang, such a
[24:55] worm as I
[24:57] it's pretty much the description I'd
[24:59] use, Lord Jesus.
[25:02] But Lord, you brought me out. You put me
[25:04] here today, Lord Jesus. And I believe
[25:06] that you will do the same for them.
[25:09] Though we don't see it with our eyes,
[25:11] Lord, you're working already. And I just
[25:13] pray in each one of these lives, Lord
[25:15] God, you'd come down and you'd touch
[25:16] that heart.
[25:20] Just draw them to you, Lord Jesus. We
[25:21] pray Lord if there's anything we can do
[25:24] Lord as a body as a family Lord God as
[25:28] brothers and sisters in Christ Lord

[25:31] heart Lord God lead us

[27:03] little uh chorus in his time.
[27:10] [Music]
[27:15] In his time.
[27:21] In his time.
[27:27] He makes all things beautiful
[27:33] in his time.
[27:39] Lord, please show me every day
[27:45] as you're teaching me your way
[27:51] that you do just what you say
[27:57] in your time.
[28:03] In his time.
[28:06] [Music]
[28:09] In his time
[28:13] [Music]
[28:14] he makes all things
[28:18] beautiful
[28:20] in his time.
[28:26] Lord, my life to you I bring. Each song
[28:34] I have to sing
[28:38] be to you a lovely thing
[28:43] in his time.
[28:49] In his time.
[28:52] [Music]
[28:55] In his time
[29:00] he makes all things
[29:04] beautiful
[29:06] in his time.
[29:12] Lord, please show me every day
[29:17] as you're teaching me your way
[29:23] that you do just what you say
[29:29] in your time.
[29:34] In his time.
[29:37] [Music]
[29:40] In his time
[29:45] he makes all things
[29:49] beautiful
[29:51] in his time.
[29:56] Lord to life to you I bring
[30:02] a song I have to sing.
[30:10] the lovely thing
[30:13] in his time.
[30:16] [Music]
[30:19] How many is willing to lay their life
[30:21] down and receive his word this morning?
[30:26] We must do that, shouldn't we? God help
[30:29] us. We haven't come here by chance. You
[30:32] may have thought, "I've come here, I'll
[30:33] do a duty. I come to church, that won't
[30:35] save you." you're here. Either you want
[30:38] more of him or you don't.
[30:40] And God's here to feed those that are
[30:42] hungry.
[30:43] [Music]
[30:44] So don't let the message, don't let the
[30:46] hour, not my what I'm saying, but the
[30:48] message of the hour, don't let it pass
[30:50] you by, go over your head.
[30:53] Don't make it so complicated that you
[30:55] miss it.
[30:57] It's simple. He hides in simplicity. He
[31:01] makes himself known in simplicity.
[31:04] Amen.
[31:06] Amen. So, we know that he's present.
[31:09] He's here. How many is willing to trust
[31:13] him? Say, "Lord, I'm believing that you
[31:16] can speak through a human clay vessel.
[31:20] What that clay vessel doesn't even know
[31:22] about, you can speak through it." Amen.
[31:25] Is that right? Are you expecting him to
[31:27] speak? I hope you're not expecting David
[31:30] to speak because my intellects wouldn't
[31:32] do any good in this. But if Lord help me
[31:35] just get out of the way and he'll speak
[31:39] the word that he's already spoken in
[31:42] this hour for the going home of the
[31:44] bride.
[31:46] Do we believe we have a message like
[31:48] that? He promised it. His word promised
[31:51] it. He said it would be here. Now
[31:53] there's somebody that's going to hear
[31:55] the word just like it's been in every
[31:57] age.
[31:59] Somebody's going to respond to that
[32:01] truth.
[32:02] That's not your works. It's not what
[32:04] you've done. You couldn't produce it.
[32:06] You couldn't works enough works to make
[32:07] it happen.
[32:10] You were chosen in him before the world
[32:12] began.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Even to be sitting right here this
[32:16] morning,
[32:19] I'm expecting to hear from him. I'm
[32:21] expecting him to speak through me to
[32:23] your heart. And while he's speaking to
[32:25] you, he speaks to me also.
[32:28] I'm expecting that. I believe God's able
[32:31] to do that. God has a chosen way of
[32:33] doing things. It may be contrary to your
[32:36] way and my way, but he has his chosen
[32:38] way of doing things in his time. How
[32:42] many is willing to wait then in his
[32:44] time? Say, Lord, I don't understand. And
[32:47] there may be things I say that I say I
[32:49] say it comes through me, but said this
[32:51] morning, you may not understand. Well,
[32:53] don't fret over that. God has his time.
[32:56] God knows what you need. God knows what
[32:58] I need. Right on time.
[33:01] Amen. But we're living in a tremendous
[33:04] hour when the word has become unveiled
[33:09] and it's being revealed
[33:11] to those he chose in him before the
[33:15] foundation of the world. See, you didn't
[33:17] have anything to do with it. So, thank
[33:19] you musicians. God bless you. So, it's
[33:21] in his time. I appreciated that. We want
[33:26] we believe we have his time. So, God
[33:29] bless you all. Amen.
[33:31] Amen. Let's have a let's stand together
[33:33] and we're going to open the word. And
[33:35] before we do that, let's have a word of
[33:37] prayer.
[33:40] Our gracious heavenly father, you knew
[33:44] everyone where they would be this
[33:46] morning, where they would be seated. You
[33:49] knew I would stand here this morning.
[33:53] You know all of that, Lord. Before the
[33:56] world began, you saw us doing it. We're
[33:58] only carrying out what you saw and being
[34:01] manifested. Lord, your word is eternal
[34:07] and there's eternal life in that word.
[34:10] And Lord, you don't you live in your
[34:12] word.
[34:15] Some say God lives in the church. No,
[34:17] God doesn't live in the church. God
[34:19] lives in his word. The Catholic Church
[34:22] says he's in his church. No, he's in his
[34:24] word. Now, if that word's in you,
[34:29] quickened, then where is God? He's in
[34:32] his word in you. So, Lord, it's nothing
[34:35] to do with us. By grace, by divine grace
[34:38] are we saved through the revelation
[34:41] that you give to us, Lord. By
[34:43] revelation, the gift is known, Lord, by
[34:46] faith. And faith is a gift of God. It's
[34:50] God revealed in you and I. And that's
[34:52] grace. And now Lord, we just thank you
[34:55] for your goodness as we open the word.
[34:58] May you minister to every individual
[35:00] heart what that heart needs.
[35:03] I ask this for your glory and blessing
[35:05] upon your word. And those that are not
[35:08] here with us, Lord, could not be here.
[35:11] May you bless them and open the word and
[35:13] bless their souls this morning. those
[35:16] listening online, Lord, I've already
[35:18] heard from some that are hearing online
[35:21] and Lord, that have been prayed and
[35:23] praying for this service. I ask you,
[35:25] Lord, to bless them and open the word to
[35:27] their hearts. Reveal yourself, Lord. We
[35:30] expect that. We expect to leave here
[35:32] raised to a higher plane in Christ
[35:36] Jesus. Our our great hope, our anchor,
[35:43] our
[35:44] value. We have our value in you, Lord.
[35:48] Now, we thank you for this in Jesus
[35:50] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Turn with me
[35:54] to Song of Solomon,
[35:56] the second chapter.
[36:03] the Old Testament, Song of Solomon.
[36:06] That's after Ecclesiastes, Proverbs,
[36:08] Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. Some
[36:11] of these I didn't even mark out. So, as
[36:13] I turn to them, you you will have time
[36:16] to turn to them and can be put on the
[36:19] board if we can get it on the board. My
[36:22] title this morning to this this morning
[36:25] is this, the voice. And I say the voice,
[36:30] let me just say our the voice of our
[36:32] beloved because I'm wanting to include
[36:34] myself with you, but the the voice of my
[36:38] beloved. So I'm saying mine because it
[36:42] includes you. You're the my also. So the
[36:45] voice of my beloved is the title. Christ
[36:48] revealed in his own word.
[36:51] Christ revealed in his own word.
[36:55] the context
[36:57] of the text.
[37:00] That sounds funny, doesn't it? But what
[37:03] are we going to look at here this
[37:04] morning? The context
[37:07] in the text. We're going to read the
[37:09] text.
[37:11] But there remains an element in that
[37:15] is can only be known to his bride. And
[37:18] that's what I want to minister on this
[37:19] morning. So let's turn here to second
[37:22] Song of Solomon verse 8 to8.
[37:30] The voice of my beloved
[37:34] behold he cometh leaping upon the
[37:36] mountains and skipping upon the hills.
[37:39] Verse
[37:41] 10. My beloved spake and said unto me,
[37:45] Rise up. Watch the voice here. Rise up.
[37:49] What did he speak?
[37:51] Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come
[37:56] away.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; All right, so we're moving toward a
[38:00] climax here. We're moving toward a
[38:02] meeting. Amen. Rise up, my love, my
[38:06] beloved. Okay, verse
[38:10] 13.
[38:12] Let's go to the last part where it says,
[38:14] "Arise. Arise, my love, my fair one, and
[38:18] come away. So rise up, arise, and come
[38:22] away. You may be seated. The voice of my
[38:25] beloved saying, So what is that voice?
[38:28] The voice of the resurrection.
[38:33] So Isaiah 60 verse1 said, "Arise and
[38:36] shine." Speaking of our day, "Arise,
[38:39] shine, for thy light is come."
[38:43] and the glory of the Lord, not another,
[38:46] the Lord. The glory of the Lord is risen
[38:48] upon thee.
[38:50] Amen.
[38:52] Amen. So, there's a people today that
[38:56] was a part of him to begin with. We
[38:58] realize that. The Bible says it was.
[39:01] Amen. They were in him before the world
[39:04] began.
[39:05] Amen. Just like if I had my son was in
[39:08] me before he was born. Amen. So, where
[39:13] were you in Christ? See, everything
[39:17] types back to that spiritual.
[39:21] All right. I want to read some things
[39:23] here. And what I read here, I'm laying
[39:24] the foundation. I'm going to read here
[39:27] what I'm wanting to bring forth here.
[39:31] So, if there's something, as I said, you
[39:33] don't agree with, that's all right. Just
[39:35] don't cast it aside. You just go back in
[39:39] the word, feed on the message, and see
[39:41] if it's truth or not
[39:44] before you're ready to cast it away.
[39:47] Just search it out. God God will make it
[39:51] known to you. It's not intellectually
[39:53] conceived. These things aren't
[39:55] theologically taught.
[39:58] They are brought to the bride by
[40:00] revelation.
[40:02] And that not of ourselves. As we said,
[40:04] that faith is not of ourselves. It's the
[40:07] gift of God.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let me read here. The
[40:11] logos,
[40:13] the word in the letter, the word in the
[40:16] book opened.
[40:18] The book contain names. How many believe
[40:21] the book contain names? All right.
[40:24] But the names being the mystery hidden
[40:26] in the letter, a supernatural element or
[40:29] member of the word unsealed.
[40:34] What is the member of the word? It's the
[40:36] member of himself unsealed. Now, I'm
[40:38] just reading this. The message of our
[40:41] the message
[40:42] that is the message of our hour or our
[40:45] day.
[40:47] It's a day that's been decreed for you
[40:49] and I to be here.
[40:51] We didn't live back in when Luther
[40:54] preached. We didn't live back when
[40:55] Wesley preached. We didn't live out here
[40:57] in the opening, you and I, when the when
[40:59] the the Pentecostal message of the
[41:02] restoration of the gifts and the baptism
[41:04] was preached.
[41:06] We didn't live in that time. We live in
[41:08] this time. I'm not saying those things
[41:10] didn't apply. They did in their age. But
[41:12] now, where are we?
[41:14] Somebody is going to be alive and
[41:18] living. And someone's going to have that
[41:21] word revealed in their season,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; in his time.
[41:26] All right. So, but God's unsealed or
[41:29] unwrapped
[41:31] the gift in the bride. You see, we
[41:35] believe Jesus was a wrapped gift.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Wrapped by what? In flesh.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He was ra then he was that
[41:45] he also then what he was
[41:49] he poured into where? His church, his
[41:52] bride. Amen. And they also were vessels
[41:56] that had a wrapped mystery in them.
[42:00] Do you believe that Christ was the
[42:01] mystery of God? And all that Christ was,
[42:05] he poured into his bride.
[42:08] Amen. All right. Then God's unsealed or
[42:12] unwrapped gift is in the bride. There's
[42:14] the message. We're speaking of the hour
[42:19] and the word, the faith of our
[42:21] bridegroom. The word. the word. And I
[42:24] speak the word. I'm speaking of logos
[42:26] here. The word, not letter. The word.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; And I'll we're going to go over that
[42:32] here as we go along. The word, the faith
[42:36] of our bridegroom,
[42:38] which is the son of man, is made flesh
[42:40] in the formation of his bride. Today,
[42:43] not another person is made known.
[42:46] Eve was not another person.
[42:50] Amen. He was another person, but she was
[42:53] not the she was Adam.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; When she was taken out of Adam, she was
[42:59] Adam expressed into another form.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; But her name wasn't another until she
[43:06] fell. Her name was Adam. So she was the
[43:09] expression of Adam.
[43:11] Amen. In another form. And that was the
[43:14] complete revelation of Adam.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; I hope you're learning. That was the
[43:20] complete revelation of Adam.
[43:23] Amen. So, so then God had a family. I
[43:29] won't go any further than that. I want
[43:31] to state a point here because I the
[43:33] time. So,
[43:36] so we see the faith of our bridegroom,
[43:38] the son of man is made flesh now and
[43:41] being made flesh in the formation of his
[43:43] bride.
[43:45] Other words, there's something growing
[43:46] in the bride
[43:48] &gt;&gt; to a complete stature.
[43:52] And that stature is not David's stature.
[43:54] It's Christ.
[43:56] All right. See? So, so the son of man is
[43:59] made flesh
[44:01] in the formation of his bride, which is
[44:03] the message of the seventh angel, which
[44:06] is the seventh seal.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so we've read Solomon.
[44:13] We've heard we're going to hear. So
[44:15] that's what is this faith of our
[44:16] bridegroom? It's the living word in
[44:18] action.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is Hebrews 4:12.
[44:24] His word is sharper than a two-edged
[44:26] sword. So we'll we'll read this down
[44:28] here. I want you to turn with me down
[44:29] now to Revelation 19.
[44:37] Revelations 19. And I'm going through a
[44:39] lot of words. You say, "Well, don't let
[44:41] the devil tell you, well, you know, you
[44:42] know, you don't understand this." Don't
[44:44] you let the devil tell you that. It's
[44:47] not what you understand. It's what God
[44:50] makes known when he wants to make known
[44:52] as you have need of making it known. So,
[44:54] there may be things that goes beyond you
[44:56] a little bit here. That doesn't mean
[44:57] they're wrong.
[44:59] So, don't let don't let the devil tell
[45:01] you you don't. I remember as a young
[45:02] boy, I had to learn that lesson. I was
[45:05] it used to bother me so much. I couldn't
[45:07] understand what was being preached. I
[45:08] thought, "What? I just don't get it. I
[45:10] just don't understand it.
[45:12] And the Lord said, "Quit your trying to
[45:14] figure it out and let me reveal it as I
[45:18] want to reveal it. As I have need of
[45:20] revealing it to you, I'll make it
[45:21] known." How many believe that? You
[45:23] believe he has that control?
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't come here in your own.
[45:28] Who Who brought you here? You never had
[45:29] any You never had any control of how you
[45:32] were born, who you're born through, and
[45:33] how you come here. And you're here
[45:35] today.
[45:37] What brought you here today? Something
[45:39] made you believe that you could get in
[45:41] your car and come drive in here and and
[45:43] arrive here and sit here and listen.
[45:46] He knew that I would be preaching what
[45:48] he's inspired me to preach. And it's not
[45:50] David's words. It's what he wanted to
[45:52] preach to his elect sheep. Now, we've
[45:56] been hearing a lot about the sheep know
[45:58] his voice.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; So, that's what I'm speaking on. The
[46:01] sheep know his voice.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Logos. Now, we're going to come. I'm
[46:06] going to tell you what the log go is
[46:08] here a minute. I I told you, but I'm
[46:10] just laying this out. Okay. Now,
[46:12] Revelations 19 verse 7-9.
[46:17] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[46:19] honor to him. For the scriptures this
[46:23] day, this scriptur is fulfilled. For let
[46:26] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[46:28] him for the marriage of the lamb is come
[46:31] and his wife hath made herself ready.
[46:34] The revealing of the son of man unites
[46:36] the two together.
[46:38] Amen. Proving his word 19 in in
[46:43] Jeffersville. He said the two unite
[46:45] together through that revelation. Then
[46:47] we go to the wedding supper. Amen. A
[46:50] celebration of that union because what
[46:53] we're speaking here is a union
[46:55] &gt;&gt; and it's not an outward
[46:58] public show. It is an it is an invisible
[47:01] union.
[47:04] But it's happening. It's substance. But
[47:06] it's not known to everybody. God didn't
[47:09] God didn't say he would make his word
[47:11] known to everybody.
[47:14] Logos. He doesn't say he makes his word
[47:17] known to everybody. Everybody can hear
[47:19] it spoken.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody can read it,
[47:24] &gt;&gt; but not everybody can receive it.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; So God hid his word.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe, and we're going to come
[47:32] to it in a minute, I believe God's hid
[47:34] his word in vessels right here this
[47:35] morning.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; To be unsealed.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; And when it's unsealed, he's still
[47:42] hidden in vessels.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; When a mystery is unsealed, it just
[47:47] simply becomes a secret.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes the secret can and
[47:54] it's lived out. But others, but unless
[47:56] it's unveiled in you, you hold the
[47:58] secret. when you when it's unveiled in
[48:01] you, that gift is unwrapped.
[48:04] You hold the secret.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Okay? I'm saying that because I want it
[48:08] to I want you to get in the right frame
[48:10] here of thought. All right? Now, so so
[48:13] verse 8. And to her, now she hath made
[48:18] herself ready, and to her was granted,
[48:21] not to another, not to anyone else, not
[48:23] to this church, that church, but to her
[48:26] an individual. We're speaking of the
[48:27] bride. We're speaking of the elect.
[48:30] We're speaking of those that were chosen
[48:31] in him already. And if God chose you in
[48:34] him, who's going to take you out of his
[48:36] hand? He doesn't change his thought
[48:39] &gt;&gt; about you.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Now, I said a big word when I said
[48:42] thought there. So, just hold that word
[48:44] right there. Now, and so he made and to
[48:48] her was granted that she should be
[48:50] arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.
[48:53] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[48:56] of saints.
[48:59] Amen. It's the righteousness.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; The life.
[49:05] We're clothed in his life. The
[49:08] righteousness of saints. Okay. Verse
[49:10] nine. And he saith unto me, type of the
[49:13] bride, John. And he saith unto me,
[49:16] write, blessed are they which are called
[49:20] unto the marriage supper of the lamb.
[49:25] And he, these are the true sayings of
[49:29] God. Verse 11. And I saw heaven opened.
[49:35] Remember, heaven consists of the word.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And I saw heaven opened. And behold, a
[49:42] white horse. That's a power.
[49:45] And he that sat upon him was called
[49:47] faithful and true. Well, there's only
[49:50] one faithful and true.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; And if you're in him, you're faithful
[49:55] and true.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; But you got to be in him to be faithful
[49:58] and true.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so it's not looking at your
[50:02] failures and mistakes. It's whether
[50:04] you're in him or not.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he's already accepted
[50:10] those in him. He's already you've
[50:12] already the Bible said you already
[50:13] received in the beloved. He chose you
[50:15] and you've already received you.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; And he had a time to be bring you to
[50:21] birth. He had a time to show you the
[50:22] truth. And because he showed you the
[50:24] truth, you walked in it. What was that?
[50:26] When others see the same truth and won't
[50:28] walk in it.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; What makes the difference?
[50:31] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about this
[50:33] morning. All right. So,
[50:37] he's called faithful and true. in
[50:39] righteousness he doth judge and make
[50:42] war.
[50:45] Okay, we'll stop it right there. I want
[50:47] you to go with me now to Revelations 10.
[50:50] Just back a couple chapters here, a few
[50:52] chapters. Revelations 10 and we're going
[50:55] to read 1 through 4
[50:58] to start with.
[51:01] I could say a lot on these things,
[51:03] brothers and sister. I'm trying to hold
[51:04] back because I'm wanting to make a point
[51:06] here. trying to get a point across
[51:09] because you could preach this message
[51:10] for the next how many many years and
[51:13] never touch it because it's because to
[51:15] the bride this is all becoming one
[51:17] person.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; The whole revelation of this book is
[51:21] Jesus Christ.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; But we're going to find out you are in
[51:26] the book.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[51:37] Amen. All right. So,
[51:40] I won't get ahead of myself here. And I
[51:41] saw another mighty angel come down from
[51:46] heaven
[51:48] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[51:52] upon his head, and his face as it were
[51:54] the sun, and his feet as pillars of
[51:57] fire. Now, John's seeing his second
[51:59] coming.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right there. Remember Jesus said,
[52:05] "What is that to you, Peter?
[52:08] If he if he remains, if he is if he I
[52:11] show him my coming, what is that to
[52:13] you?"
[52:15] Amen. Well, will this man continue to
[52:17] live? No. They thought he wasn't going
[52:18] to die. He said, "He'll see my coming."
[52:20] He didn't say that. He said, "What is
[52:22] that to you if I show him?" And you know
[52:23] the scripture I'm referring to. All
[52:25] right.
[52:27] Okay. But he did. He did. He was caught
[52:30] up to see it. Now, watch this. Now, what
[52:32] did we see
[52:34] &gt;&gt; unveiled to us? Whose face have we seen
[52:37] that was veiled in a cloud?
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Was that a mighty angel or not?
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The mighty messenger. Who is this
[52:49] in Revelations 10:1? But Christ himself.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; All right. He's the one that holds the
[52:56] mystery.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; He's the one that unveils the mystery.
[52:59] Right.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; All right. So, here we are in Acts
[53:04] chapter 1. You don't have to turn to it.
[53:06] In Acts chapter 1 and verse 11, he he he
[53:09] rose up from them and was hidden in a
[53:13] cloud. And the Bible said he would
[53:15] return the same way.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Gaze you into heaven. This same
[53:19] Jesus you see would like so like come in
[53:22] the same manner. You see him go.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before they saw him go, where was
[53:27] he? hid in flesh.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; They saw him go. That one that they saw
[53:32] go when it was hidden and went up in a
[53:34] cloud hidden from view. Then when he
[53:38] returns, he comes back in the same way.
[53:39] But this time for what purpose?
[53:44] To unite with his people, his bride.
[53:47] What is that that we seen? The
[53:49] headstone.
[53:52] Amen. The headstone. All right. Now, so
[53:55] verse two. And he had he had in his hand
[53:59] a little book open. Notice it was not
[54:02] closed. It was open.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And he had in his little h book had in
[54:08] his hand his hand a little book open.
[54:11] And he
[54:12] see we know we know his hand is a word.
[54:14] And here holds a book that's been
[54:16] opened.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; So something's opened
[54:22] that's been hid.
[54:24] But now it's open. And we find that in
[54:25] Revelations chapter 5, he came who came?
[54:28] The lion.
[54:30] Amen. He came as the lamb.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Same person. When John looked for a
[54:36] lion, he saw the lamb bloody and
[54:38] wounded. That was the lion back there
[54:40] unveiling himself in simplicity. Now
[54:43] coming the same way back in simplicity
[54:45] in the veil of a man. But who's speaking
[54:48] to us? What is the voice now coming to
[54:50] us? It is the lion.
[54:54] himself. All right? And because the
[54:57] king's sword was put in the hands of
[54:59] that prophet. Amen. Put in his hand. Is
[55:01] that right? Nothing to do with that
[55:03] prophet. I'm talking about the king. The
[55:05] king put it in his hand. Put the word in
[55:08] his hand.
[55:10] Then who's stepping forth reveal? Who's
[55:13] who's he speaking through? Who's
[55:14] speaking to us?
[55:16] Was it the intellect of a man William
[55:19] Brandom or was it the king speaking?
[55:22] See,
[55:24] you have to have a revelation of who
[55:25] Jesus Christ is. He's not three persons.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Okay. So, now watch.
[55:34] As I said, if this is deep, this is this
[55:36] is this is so simple. It's deep.
[55:40] That's a strange thing to say, isn't it?
[55:42] Because you and your humanity cannot be
[55:45] that simple.
[55:47] But God hides himself.
[55:50] Theologians think he's got to reveal
[55:52] himself. They look at the word. It's got
[55:53] to be a great big thing. And so in their
[55:55] mind, they make up the fact how he's
[55:57] going to come. And when he does, it was
[55:59] goes right through him because he comes
[56:00] hiding himself as he always did
[56:04] &gt;&gt; in simplicity. Who preached the message
[56:07] to the Andolivian destruction before
[56:09] they were destroyed? Noah, a farmer.
[56:12] Simplicity.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; How many made it? Eight.
[56:19] over the ark
[56:20] &gt;&gt; yet spoke to a to a to a to a system
[56:24] that as intelligent maybe we're just now
[56:27] getting up to their intelligence that
[56:29] they had.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; But God hid himself in a little simple
[56:33] man building something that was
[56:35] absolutely ridiculous and radical to
[56:37] their thinking.
[56:39] Now God doesn't change.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm God and I change not." He
[56:44] can't come along and do one thing this
[56:45] way and come over here and do it another
[56:47] way. He built an ark there, but he's
[56:50] building another ark in another form
[56:52] now. But the way he hides himself
[56:56] is the way he carries out his word. He
[56:59] hid himself in a man called Jesus didn't
[57:01] even have an education. No, no, nothing
[57:03] in the Bible said he went to school.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And yet at 12 years old was astounding
[57:08] those priests by answering question.
[57:10] Why? Because he was the he was God
[57:12] himself manifested in the form of his of
[57:16] the son.
[57:18] made flesh. The Bible said he was the
[57:20] fullness of the godhead bodily. So where
[57:22] was God then? He was manifested as a
[57:25] lamb.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; That died and shed his blood to redeem
[57:30] us that were in him to begin with.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; What's he redeeming? And I'm going to
[57:36] say it right here. He's redeeming the
[57:38] thoughts of himself.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; He comes to redeem. That was his
[57:43] redemption. Now we've turned a corner
[57:45] here. And what's he coming for now?
[57:49] He's got a book in his hand. What's the
[57:51] book got to do with it? He redeemed what
[57:54] was in the book, but what's the book
[57:55] open for? To claim what he has redeemed.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Now his act is claiming what he has
[58:03] redeemed. What were the in his thoughts
[58:05] to begin with? The thoughts of himself.
[58:08] I'm not talking about just everything he
[58:11] knew. I'm talking about the thoughts,
[58:13] eternal thoughts of God himself.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] He comes to redeem those thoughts. They
[58:23] they were lost, but they weren't they
[58:25] weren't cast away. He come to redeem
[58:27] them back. He come to restore it back.
[58:29] And he has. And he is.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, what what is he
[58:36] restoring? Our position.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:41] All right. Now, so verse 11, I've read
[58:44] that. Revelation 10 1-4, second verse.
[58:47] And he had in his hand a little book
[58:49] open. And he set his right foot upon the
[58:51] sea and his left foot upon the earth.
[58:55] Amen. And cried with a loud voice as
[58:59] when a lion roarth.
[59:02] And when he had cried, seven thunders
[59:05] uttered their voices like they were
[59:07] spelling out something. I'm just going
[59:08] to drop this in like R A P T U R E
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Rapture.
[59:18] They're spelling out something.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; What's the message for? What's this
[59:22] being unveiled for?
[59:26] &gt;&gt; To go home.
[59:28] Amen. All right. So, they're spelling
[59:31] out some somebody. Now, watch what the
[59:33] Bible said. And he cried with a loud
[59:35] voice as when a lion roarth. And when he
[59:37] had cried, seven. Now you say, "Brother,
[59:39] what are you pointing at?" I'm pointing
[59:41] this to you that this has been unveiled
[59:43] in our day. This is what's happening.
[59:45] This is our day.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Here's the prophecy. Here's it
[59:49] happening.
[59:51] All right? And cried with a loud voice
[59:53] as when a lion roar. And when he had
[59:55] cried, seven thunders uttered their
[59:57] voices. And when the seven thunders had
[1:00:00] uttered their voices, brother
[1:00:04] Random, Brother Prophet said, he said
[1:00:06] this. He said, "Oh, I just Oh, if there
[1:00:08] be just to be a thousand lived voices."
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; All right. What's that saying? He said,
[1:00:17] "This message has got to drop somewhere
[1:00:19] into a heart of a bride."
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And that same voice is going to be
[1:00:22] voiced.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; All right? Not another voice. All right?
[1:00:26] So, watch. Now, that's scriptural.
[1:00:28] Everything I'm saying is scriptural
[1:00:29] here. It's not just pointing it to some
[1:00:32] idea and some thought.
[1:00:34] See, we didn't know these things were
[1:00:35] hidden in the word. We couldn't know
[1:00:37] them until God through a prophet, as he
[1:00:40] said, he would make himself known. Amos
[1:00:42] 3:7 is the word, and it can't change. I
[1:00:46] will do nothing, but before I do it, I
[1:00:48] will reveal my secrets to my servants,
[1:00:50] the prophets.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; So, a prophet has the has the the word
[1:00:56] of the Lord comes to him and has the
[1:00:58] perfect interpretation for the word of
[1:01:00] that season.
[1:01:02] And that's why we hang to that because
[1:01:05] when a prophet comes with the word and
[1:01:07] God stands behind that and vit and
[1:01:10] vindicates it by the word to be his
[1:01:12] word.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; To disbelieve that is to disbelieve
[1:01:17] Moses when you were in his day. To
[1:01:19] disbelieve that would be disbelieving
[1:01:20] Noah in his day.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; And those that rejected and turned it
[1:01:24] down were destroyed.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; So judgment always followed a major
[1:01:29] major prophet.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's no different now. Why are
[1:01:32] we seeing things happening on the earth
[1:01:34] the way they are? Why are we seeing
[1:01:36] things happen in in LA? Because judgment
[1:01:38] was put on the West Coast. It's already
[1:01:41] begun. He said, "Amen. So what are so
[1:01:44] who was that white wig? What was that
[1:01:46] white standing for? The judge. Who are
[1:01:48] we seeing but the judge?
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; And where's the bride in this? She's
[1:01:53] judged
[1:01:55] free.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Sinless."
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Our judgment isn't at the white throne
[1:02:00] judgment. I'm speaking to the bride
[1:02:02] here. The bride doesn't isn't judged at
[1:02:04] the white throne. She is in she stands
[1:02:07] sits there with her king judging.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Know ye not the Bible said that the
[1:02:11] saints shall judge the earth and even
[1:02:13] angels.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; So when is our judgment? The book's been
[1:02:16] opened. That is our judgment. What what
[1:02:19] is that speaking to you and I?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now we're coming here again into
[1:02:27] that logos. And I'll give you the what
[1:02:29] it is here in just a moment as I move
[1:02:32] forward. Okay. So in verse four, and
[1:02:36] okay, they sound uttered the voices.
[1:02:38] Now, let's slip down here. And the angel
[1:02:41] which I saw, see,
[1:02:45] oh, I'm sorry, verse four, I didn't read
[1:02:47] it yet. And when the seven thunders had
[1:02:49] uttered their voices, watch this now. I
[1:02:52] was about to write. John speaking. I was
[1:02:54] about to write. He was commissioned to
[1:02:56] write what he saw.
[1:02:59] Amen. What was showed him and there that
[1:03:01] those voices spoke something to John and
[1:03:04] he was going to write it. It was a
[1:03:06] speech. It was a voice that was speaking
[1:03:09] and it voiced itself and John was about
[1:03:12] to write what it said
[1:03:16] because God's making himself known here
[1:03:18] through seven ages.
[1:03:20] Amen. And so he's about to write what
[1:03:22] the mystery was sealed up and what that
[1:03:26] was in that book. And watch what the
[1:03:28] Bible said. And and when the seven
[1:03:32] thunders had other voices, I was about
[1:03:34] to write and I heard a voice from heaven
[1:03:37] saying unto me, "Seal up those things
[1:03:40] which the seven thunders uttered, and
[1:03:42] write them not."
[1:03:45] So now we have a word here
[1:03:48] that's sealed.
[1:03:52] I mean at this time it's been sealed up.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; It was unwritten.
[1:03:56] Is that right? An unwritten word. But
[1:04:00] something opened.
[1:04:05] Is that right? Now let's jump here to
[1:04:08] 10:7
[1:04:10] and speak of this mystery that was
[1:04:12] sealed up.
[1:04:14] In Revelation 10:7, we're speaking of
[1:04:16] the seventh angel, messenger to the
[1:04:19] seventh age.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Revelation 107.
[1:04:25] And but in the days of the voice, hello
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; of the seventh angel.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:04:33] angel,
[1:04:35] when he shall begin to sound, what is
[1:04:38] that sound? Declare something. It's a
[1:04:40] voice. It's a declaration. It's a
[1:04:42] revelation. It's a revelation being
[1:04:45] declared that what God thought. Now
[1:04:48] watch what this is. He said you you look
[1:04:51] at that word and said begin to sound the
[1:04:53] mystery. And when he shall begin to
[1:04:55] sound the mystery singular
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God. Who is the mystery
[1:05:03] of? God.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was God.
[1:05:11] In the beginning was the word
[1:05:16] and the word was God
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; and the word was with God.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; So somewhere this has got to be a word
[1:05:27] has if you speak a word
[1:05:31] you think it before you speak it.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; So the word has to be a thought that's
[1:05:37] expressed.
[1:05:39] God then is expressing himself.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God's expressing
[1:05:45] himself.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; You believe that? It's what they said,
[1:05:52] didn't it? Okay. So, we're going to
[1:05:54] bring that word that God was and was
[1:05:57] with him.
[1:06:00] Before it was word, it was with him.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Hello. And the same was with God.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and the Bible said was God.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Verse two said the same was with him.
[1:06:14] Verse one, it said it was with him and
[1:06:15] the word was God and the same was with
[1:06:18] God.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; So he's making it very clear that
[1:06:21] there's something that he's that this
[1:06:23] word is declaring. And the prophet here
[1:06:26] takes this mystery that was unwritten.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. This prophet of our day, his
[1:06:34] message was to take what was unwritten
[1:06:36] and unseal it.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; The message of this prophet today is to
[1:06:42] unseal that hidden mystery
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; That John couldn't write
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; because it kept it he kept it a secret.
[1:06:52] But he said, "But in the days when the
[1:06:54] last angel to the last stage, when
[1:06:56] everything is blind, naked, miserable,
[1:06:59] and don't know it, there's still going
[1:07:00] to be someone there that's going to be
[1:07:02] an overcomer and able to sit with me in
[1:07:05] my throne."
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they're going to hear the
[1:07:10] message.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; They're they're the ones that hear it.
[1:07:15] Now, you say, "Well, by see everybody."
[1:07:17] Let's go now. Drop back here. Now,
[1:07:19] everybody hears it. Right?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; If you want to sit down and listen, you
[1:07:24] can hear it, but not everybody hears it.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Well, brother David, you just said
[1:07:28] everybody hears it, but then everybody
[1:07:30] doesn't hear it. Then we're talking
[1:07:31] about two different hearing here.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; You can hear it spoken, then you can
[1:07:37] hear it and receive it
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; because that hides something. That rema
[1:07:44] that spoken word
[1:07:48] has a logos.
[1:07:52] inside
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; of that
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; the bride
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; only knows
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; because he can only reveal it to his
[1:08:03] own.
[1:08:04] He said he would only reveal it to his
[1:08:06] own.
[1:08:08] Okay, I don't want to jump ahead too
[1:08:10] far. Okay. Now, so we're seeing that in
[1:08:14] verse 7, the mystery of God would be
[1:08:16] finished as he hath declared, or other
[1:08:19] words, prophesied to his servants, the
[1:08:22] prophets. So now we're seeing God's word
[1:08:26] this day being fulfilled.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; But there's also another fulfillment.
[1:08:33] Somebody is going to hear it. And and
[1:08:35] the next verse said, John,
[1:08:38] Amen. Now watch. And the voice which I
[1:08:42] heard, John said, I heard the voice, and
[1:08:45] I was forbidden to write what it said,
[1:08:47] but I heard it from heaven spake unto me
[1:08:49] again, and said, Go and take the little
[1:08:51] book which is open in the hands of the
[1:08:54] angel, which standeth upon the sea and
[1:08:56] upon the earth. And I went unto the
[1:08:58] angel, and said unto him, Give me the
[1:09:00] little book.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; So, there's something in that book that
[1:09:03] pertained to John. He knew it.
[1:09:06] Right. Right.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And when God took the book in
[1:09:09] Revelations 5 and and and was taken the
[1:09:12] book, you'll find the same thing in
[1:09:14] Revelations 4 when when uh when Boaz
[1:09:18] took Ruth.
[1:09:20] So when he took the book, there's a book
[1:09:21] that contains names. That's a section, a
[1:09:24] bride section of the lamb's book of
[1:09:27] life. So that little book, it's a little
[1:09:29] book within the book.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; That is open. And it's only open and the
[1:09:36] mystery has been sealed in earthn
[1:09:38] vessels today. But in this day our
[1:09:41] message those those that mystery has
[1:09:43] been unsealed
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; in that vessel.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that unsealed word becomes
[1:09:53] then no more a mystery. It is a secret
[1:09:56] because the seventh seal revealed itself
[1:09:58] in a secret. Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; How many know that's right?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Because because when it
[1:10:08] sounded when the when the seventh seal
[1:10:10] was unsealed, there was silence. And the
[1:10:13] prophet said the silence denoted the
[1:10:16] secret.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; It's not a public show. It's not public.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You alone have it. The bride alone has
[1:10:23] it. It's not a group affair.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; We're not saved because we come to this
[1:10:28] church. We're not saved. We go to any
[1:10:29] church. It's not church annity anymore.
[1:10:31] It's revealed to individuals. The
[1:10:34] mystery is revealed to individuals. They
[1:10:37] are in a divine relationship of union
[1:10:39] with the bride, with the Christ himself.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I said a lot there and
[1:10:49] kind of jumped ahead, but let's continue
[1:10:51] here. Trying to watch my time now. I
[1:10:54] still got some time. All right. Now,
[1:11:00] so we see verse seven. I went to verse
[1:11:02] eight to show you that. And the word's
[1:11:04] got to be somewhere. And I'll come to
[1:11:06] the rest of that a little later. But he
[1:11:08] went to the angel said, "Give him the
[1:11:10] book." And he said, "Take it and eat it
[1:11:12] up." Now, it's going to c it's going to
[1:11:15] it's going to bring about some pain.
[1:11:16] It's going to bring suffering. It's
[1:11:17] going to be a challenge. It's going to
[1:11:19] be a struggle. There's a reason for that
[1:11:21] because I have opened my purpose in you
[1:11:23] and I am going to do this. I'm going to
[1:11:26] fulfill my purpose.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; You are ordained under eternal purpose
[1:11:30] and I'm going to fulfill that purpose.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing going to stop me
[1:11:34] from doing it. It's going to be hard.
[1:11:36] It's going to be a struggle. But that
[1:11:38] word cannot my purpose will not leave.
[1:11:40] It's been revealed. It's been it's been
[1:11:43] open to you. And you see yourself sealed
[1:11:46] in.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; All right. The new birth is the sealing
[1:11:54] in.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody tell you the ceiling
[1:12:00] comes later. What comes later is the
[1:12:02] full adoption.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; You're already a son. You're already
[1:12:07] born.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to grow into the stature
[1:12:11] of Christ, which is yourself as who you
[1:12:13] are on the inside of that soul. And so
[1:12:15] he's going to do everything he needs to
[1:12:17] do not with by frustration but with a
[1:12:19] purpose to bring you and fulfill that
[1:12:21] eternal purpose that you the individual
[1:12:24] had in his body
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; to minister him in this age. Now that
[1:12:30] was a mouthful but that's the truth. All
[1:12:33] right. Now now watch
[1:12:37] now you see so we just read that. Now
[1:12:39] I'll just I'll drop back to that again.
[1:12:41] I want you to turn me to Daniel 12:9 if
[1:12:44] you want to. Now, I I some of this I'm
[1:12:46] just going to have to read and we'll
[1:12:47] read without you turning. But in Daniel
[1:12:53] Daniel 12, the last chapter, now this
[1:12:56] book was a sealed book. Daniel was
[1:12:59] actually shown what it would be all the
[1:13:01] way down to the end. But he said it's
[1:13:04] for a time further on Daniel, but you'll
[1:13:07] live and you'll come up and you'll re
[1:13:09] you'll you will absolutely minister and
[1:13:12] be with your people. But he said there's
[1:13:15] mysteries here that was shown Daniel and
[1:13:16] he was hard to get over it for several
[1:13:18] days.
[1:13:20] Amen. Are you with me? Remember when the
[1:13:22] prophet was shown these mysteries, he
[1:13:24] said it took him two or three or four
[1:13:26] days to get out of that. See, it was so
[1:13:28] powerful. All right. Now, but go thy
[1:13:32] way. Verse nine,
[1:13:35] but in the end, he's talking about
[1:13:37] Daniel in the end. And he said, "Go thy
[1:13:39] way, Daniel, for the words are closed up
[1:13:43] and sealed till the time of the end."
[1:13:49] Now, we know if we go back to Revelation
[1:13:51] 10, this one that stood on the foot in
[1:13:53] the sea and on the land declared that
[1:13:55] these things would be known. And when
[1:13:57] it's known, the time would be no longer.
[1:14:01] Time would no longer be delayed.
[1:14:04] It's at that time. Now, brother, sister,
[1:14:06] I'm going to ask you, is this the time
[1:14:08] or isn't it?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; We know it is because the opening of
[1:14:12] those seals declares we're at the end.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; We haven't come to that moment, but
[1:14:16] we're at the end. There's not another
[1:14:18] message coming. There's not another
[1:14:20] time. The next thing in in in line for
[1:14:22] the for the bride is the catching away,
[1:14:24] the rapture of our body. But what
[1:14:28] happens before that is a mystery and
[1:14:30] it's revealed only in her. And that's
[1:14:32] that is his coming to that point. He has
[1:14:36] to fulfill that in the catching away and
[1:14:38] the meeting in the air which absolutely
[1:14:41] opens up the third coming
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; because remember he doesn't step the
[1:14:45] Calvary man we meet him that Calvary man
[1:14:48] Jesus our Lord will not step on earth
[1:14:50] until the millennium.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So something's happening right
[1:14:56] here. He's making himself known. And how
[1:14:58] he comes is the mystery that's revealed
[1:15:01] to the bride
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; because nobody else can know that
[1:15:05] mystery. That was what John was
[1:15:07] forbidden to write is the coming of the
[1:15:09] Lord.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; But to the bride, it's open.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Now, you can say, I'll challenge you on
[1:15:17] that. Do whatever you want to do, but
[1:15:19] that's fine. I that doesn't bother me.
[1:15:21] But the point is, stay with the word.
[1:15:23] Something is revealed to the bride
[1:15:25] that's already hidden in the word.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, you say, "What about
[1:15:32] Revelations 10? Was it hidden the word?"
[1:15:34] Yes. Yes. It opened up. It said
[1:15:37] something. So, it's hidden the word. It
[1:15:39] just wasn't time for it to be unsealed
[1:15:41] until the message of the seventh angel.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And where then what happens? Well,
[1:15:46] there's a revelation goes forth.
[1:15:48] Everybody says, "Praise the Lord." Put
[1:15:50] their own thought to it and everything
[1:15:51] else. No.
[1:15:53] What happens is that there's there still
[1:15:55] a supernatural element that still has to
[1:15:59] be there despite the revelation. Despite
[1:16:01] that it was spoken by the prophet,
[1:16:03] there's still a supernatural element, an
[1:16:05] element, a member. There's still a
[1:16:07] member. There's still an individual that
[1:16:08] needs to catch that revelation on the
[1:16:10] inside of the inside. That is that
[1:16:13] supernatural element.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, let's let's go forward.
[1:16:23] All right. Now, Daniel 12:9 said, "The
[1:16:26] words are closed up and sealed till the
[1:16:28] time of the end."
[1:16:31] Okay, you say, "Well, it's got to do
[1:16:33] with us."
[1:16:35] I'll tell you.
[1:16:39] I wasn't going to go to this quite yet,
[1:16:41] but let me just get there
[1:16:44] because the prophet said this. He said
[1:16:47] those words,
[1:16:49] those word, he said you are the words in
[1:16:53] the book.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; That's beyond written.
[1:17:05] And it is written, but it's beyond
[1:17:07] written.
[1:17:09] It's something hidden in that.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. He hid it, didn't
[1:17:14] he? Okay. Now, I may have
[1:17:24] just a moment here. I'm trying to find
[1:17:26] this. Maybe I'll come to it, but I'm
[1:17:28] just trying to see. I thought I'd get to
[1:17:29] it first.
[1:17:33] Anyway, he said, "You are the word in
[1:17:36] the book to be opened." That's exactly
[1:17:39] what he said. And that's what Daniel
[1:17:41] said. So, it had to come to that time.
[1:17:43] And now we're seeing prophecy fulfilled.
[1:17:47] All right. So now
[1:17:49] remember remember the third pull is the
[1:17:53] opening of the word.
[1:17:56] Now I'm going to go forward here because
[1:17:58] that word that's opened is logos.
[1:18:01] What is now we'll find here. Let's I'm
[1:18:04] going to read some scripture and you
[1:18:05] don't have to turn to this. I just want
[1:18:07] to read it. This is something I'm just
[1:18:08] going to read. Hebrews 4:10. For the
[1:18:11] word of God is quick and powerful, and
[1:18:13] sharper than any two-edged sword. The
[1:18:15] word of God is quick and powerful,
[1:18:17] sharper than any two-edged sword,
[1:18:19] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[1:18:21] of soul and spirit, and of the joints
[1:18:23] and marrow, and is a discerner of the
[1:18:25] thoughts and intents of the heart.
[1:18:28] Ephesians 6:17, and take the sword of
[1:18:31] the spirit, which is the word of God.
[1:18:33] Notice in every case here, we're
[1:18:35] speaking of the word. And take the sword
[1:18:37] of the spirit, which is the word of God.
[1:18:38] Revelations 19:13 and 15a. And he was
[1:18:43] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood.
[1:18:45] And his name is called the word of God.
[1:18:48] And out of his mouth goeth a sharp
[1:18:50] two-edged sword. So we see the word his
[1:18:52] name is called the word of God. And out
[1:18:54] of his mouth.
[1:18:57] Hear it again. This is speaking of
[1:18:59] logos. These scriptures are speaking of
[1:19:02] logos. Now I want to bring you what the
[1:19:04] prophet said Logos is referring to these
[1:19:06] scriptures. Now he said and in John 1
[1:19:09] 1-3 in the beginning was the word and
[1:19:13] the word was with God and the word was
[1:19:15] God. The same word
[1:19:18] that's logos was in the beginning with
[1:19:20] God and the beginning was logos and the
[1:19:23] logos was with God and the logos was
[1:19:25] God. I'm reading it that way for a
[1:19:26] purpose. And was in the beginning with
[1:19:29] God. All things were made by him and
[1:19:31] without him was nothing made which was
[1:19:33] made.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. He's creator.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; All right. It's too bad that a lot of
[1:19:41] them being his creation didn't accept
[1:19:43] him because he came to his own creation
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; and his own creation didn't receive him.
[1:19:49] But as many as did receive him
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; to them gave him power to become sons of
[1:19:56] God. To them gave them those that could
[1:20:00] receive him.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; All right. So for there for 1 John 5:7
[1:20:09] for there are three that bear record in
[1:20:11] heaven. The father, the word, and the
[1:20:13] holy ghost. That's not three separate
[1:20:15] people because the very next statement
[1:20:17] and these three are one.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; So there's not three persons here.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; There's only one God manifested in three
[1:20:24] offices.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Father, son, and holy ghost. But what
[1:20:28] was the son? Logos.
[1:20:32] the Father, the Word, and the Holy
[1:20:35] Ghost.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me now? Okay. I don't
[1:20:38] want to lose you here. And this I know
[1:20:40] some, you know, just scratch your head.
[1:20:42] I It's not a problem. It's not a shame
[1:20:43] to scratch your head, okay? Because I
[1:20:46] know this is going, this is brought out
[1:20:48] for a reason this morning,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; and don't worry about whether you
[1:20:52] understand everything. Just get in love
[1:20:55] with Christ. Get in love with his word.
[1:20:58] Depend on him. You've repented. You've
[1:21:00] been baptized in his name. Now expect
[1:21:02] the next thing. He will give you the
[1:21:04] Holy Ghost.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Give you the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; So just don't stop at that. Go on.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; To the full birth
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; and let God be birthed in you. Let his
[1:21:17] word become alive in you. And then when
[1:21:19] that word's become alive in you, you and
[1:21:21] the word are one.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's the difference between
[1:21:28] church entity and the bride word bride.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between that's the
[1:21:34] difference between the real believer and
[1:21:35] the the one that wants to call himself
[1:21:38] believe. I'm not bringing judgment. I'm
[1:21:39] just saying there's going to be that
[1:21:40] because Jesus said himself, "Few there
[1:21:42] be that find it. Straight is the gate
[1:21:44] and narrows the way and few there be
[1:21:46] that find it." But those few will find
[1:21:48] it.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; And who's going to make it known to
[1:21:50] them? By their theology figuring it out?
[1:21:52] No. God's going to reveal it to them
[1:21:54] because they were chosen in him be
[1:21:56] before the foundation of the world and
[1:21:58] would have them to be opened when the
[1:22:01] book was open. They were opened.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Remember the third pull is the opening
[1:22:06] of the word.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; What word? Predestinated word.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word seed is open.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; It takes a Holy Ghost to come upon the
[1:22:18] seed to give you the birth. Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; The birth is the word revealed in you.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; The new birth is Jesus Christ. The new
[1:22:26] birth revealed in you. That is the new
[1:22:28] birth.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Many, and I say this not to be
[1:22:33] judgmental, but many will not have the
[1:22:36] new birth and they will miss the
[1:22:38] rapture. But I don't know how many.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know who that is. By their
[1:22:43] fruit, we know them because the fruit of
[1:22:45] the season and their season will be
[1:22:47] revealed to them. And by that they are
[1:22:49] identified to have passed from death to
[1:22:52] life.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; And they know that.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to stop preaching
[1:22:58] because I think this one know this.
[1:23:00] That's none of my business. My business
[1:23:02] is to preach this this morning. Like
[1:23:04] everybody believed it.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. That's up to
[1:23:12] God what he wants to make known.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; And he'll do it. And you won't have to
[1:23:16] push it up, pump it up, work it up. He's
[1:23:18] going to do it. That's all. You're
[1:23:20] supernaturally led to be where you are
[1:23:22] despite your own thinking and not even
[1:23:24] knowing how could it happen that way.
[1:23:25] And it happens. Who did that? Something
[1:23:28] in you recognized his voice. It wasn't
[1:23:30] what you put there. That eagle was in
[1:23:32] the barnyard in the chicken yard. But he
[1:23:34] wasn't a chicken. He was an eagle. And
[1:23:36] when the eagle flew over and screamed,
[1:23:38] something inside of him recognized that
[1:23:40] voice when the chickens didn't. They
[1:23:42] couldn't. What made the difference?
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; So, it's not big me and little everybody
[1:23:50] else.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; It's no big nothing.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; We with two wings cover our face. Two
[1:23:55] wings cover our feet. And with two wings
[1:23:57] we fly by the energy of in in the
[1:24:00] presence of God himself in humility and
[1:24:03] covering our own face. We're flying
[1:24:05] manifesting him.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; It's a life lived. It's not some story.
[1:24:13] It's not imagination. It is the literal
[1:24:16] life of Jesus Christ, the token lived
[1:24:19] and on display in that bride.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Contrary even to your own thinking,
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; human thinking, but God doing it
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; and he vindicates it. Brings it right
[1:24:30] back to the word and see it. See, see,
[1:24:32] if you have the Holy Ghost, you're not
[1:24:34] going to leave that word. I don't care
[1:24:36] if it takes the hide off of you. You're
[1:24:38] not going to leave that word.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; The husband's not going to leave the
[1:24:41] word. The wife's not going to leave the
[1:24:43] word.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; For your feelings and for your emotions.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; He's going to carry it out. You're going
[1:24:51] to carry it out. I don't care what it
[1:24:52] what everybody else thinks about it.
[1:24:55] What everybody else thinks is not your
[1:24:57] absolute.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Your absolute is that word.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God expects you to to get
[1:25:05] there and and and and take that word and
[1:25:08] be a possessor of the word. There's many
[1:25:10] professors. There's just not many
[1:25:13] possessors.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that?
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That doesn't matter. It doesn't
[1:25:19] mean you. It doesn't mean anybody. I
[1:25:21] don't care about your past. I have a
[1:25:23] past, too. Everybody has a past. But
[1:25:25] it's not what God God's achieved
[1:25:27] something despite your past.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Look at Look at Paul, a murderer.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; What kind of past did he have?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And yet God chose him to carry the
[1:25:37] message of the first age to the
[1:25:39] Gentiles.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Now, did Paul have anything to do with
[1:25:42] that? No. God loved Paul before the
[1:25:44] foundation of the world. Amen. And took
[1:25:47] his own took Paul and bear his his his
[1:25:51] bear beared Paul's mistakes, his errors,
[1:25:54] his failures, and went to Calvary with
[1:25:56] it.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And took it and put it back on the head
[1:25:59] of the devil.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Was Paul sorry for what he did? Yes. He
[1:26:03] never quite got over it. But he also
[1:26:06] said,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; "I know him."
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:10] Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; In the power of his resurrection.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; How would he know him? Who would make it
[1:26:18] known to him?
[1:26:21] See, to know him is life. That's what
[1:26:24] we're talking about this morning. To
[1:26:25] know him is life. Not to know about him.
[1:26:27] Everybody knows about him, but to know
[1:26:30] him is life.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, 1 John 5:7, I just read that.
[1:26:36] Now, let's go back here. Logos quoting
[1:26:39] now the prophet Logos. Now we now we can
[1:26:43] see by those scriptures I just read his
[1:26:46] association with the word. He is the
[1:26:50] word.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; That is who he is.
[1:26:56] We just read in Revelation 19 this one
[1:26:58] riding forth in the power of the
[1:27:00] revealed word. His name is the word of
[1:27:03] God. So the prophet says the word what
[1:27:06] is it? what he is the word that is who
[1:27:08] he is. The word in his name is who he
[1:27:12] is.
[1:27:15] Amen. All right. Now in first John or
[1:27:19] John excuse me John 1:1 where it says in
[1:27:21] the beginning was the word. The root
[1:27:23] from which we get our translation for
[1:27:26] word in first in St. John 1:1 is logos
[1:27:33] which means don't catch this don't miss
[1:27:35] this meaning which means the thought
[1:27:40] or concept
[1:27:42] it has the double meaning of thought and
[1:27:46] speech. So the double meaning of logos
[1:27:50] was thought and speech.
[1:27:54] So before God said it, he had to have a
[1:27:58] thought about what he said.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; He knew all things. Would you agree with
[1:28:07] that? He knows all things.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Knew it before the world began.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Knew what you would be. Know what's in
[1:28:12] you and put within you. Put within you
[1:28:14] what you didn't know was within you.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And he puts it there. And he comes down
[1:28:19] and he opens it by his word. I pray this
[1:28:22] morning God will open up his word to you
[1:28:24] and to your need and give us a good
[1:28:27] shaking to realize where we're at.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me?
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so now we just we want to
[1:28:34] see this.
[1:28:38] So, he goes on to say
[1:28:41] has a double meaning of thought and
[1:28:43] speech. Now, a thought expressed is a
[1:28:46] word or words.
[1:28:49] All right.
[1:28:51] Isn't that wonderful and beautiful?
[1:28:54] Well, brother Brandham, what are you
[1:28:55] talking about here? Wonderful and
[1:28:56] beautiful. Don't we all have this word?
[1:28:58] Don't everybody?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; And yes,
[1:29:03] they got Bibles by the millions.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Well, I have the word. No, you have God
[1:29:11] in written form.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Written form.
[1:29:18] Does God hide himself in something?
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; God hid himself in letters here
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; in a form.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; I believe this Bible. It's every bit the
[1:29:30] truth.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; It's my absolute.
[1:29:33] Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:29:37] Now he says goes on to say
[1:29:42] the double meaning now a thought. Okay.
[1:29:44] Now John says the concept of God was
[1:29:48] expressed
[1:29:50] the thought of God was expressed in
[1:29:53] Jesus. He was the fullness of the
[1:29:56] Godhead bodily. So the thought expressed
[1:29:58] in Jesus was sealed in an earthn vessel.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Okay? So when he came to the earth being
[1:30:09] the fullness and I'm chosen in him, I
[1:30:12] came in.
[1:30:15] When he died, you died with him.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; When he rose, you rose with him.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; What did you do when you rose with him?
[1:30:23] He conquered death, hell, and the grave.
[1:30:25] And when you rose with him, you
[1:30:27] conquered death, hell, and the grave.
[1:30:31] And when he comes down here today and
[1:30:32] unveils himself in you, you've conquered
[1:30:34] death, hell, and the grave because he's
[1:30:36] identified you and him.
[1:30:39] That's your identification.
[1:30:42] Then why would we question what God
[1:30:44] said? Because you're question it by your
[1:30:46] reasoning and your feelings.
[1:30:50] Remember this flesh can't even live
[1:30:52] unless there's a life behind it living
[1:30:55] through it.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in that life, there's also
[1:31:00] something else in that spirit. That's a
[1:31:01] soul. And that soul either came from God
[1:31:04] or didn't.
[1:31:08] Amen. Are you with me now? Because if it
[1:31:10] did, you're going to recognize what you
[1:31:13] what regardless of what you think and
[1:31:15] your past and all your failures and all
[1:31:17] your mistakes. When that word when you
[1:31:19] hear that word spoken inside of you,
[1:31:21] something happens.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you were part of that to
[1:31:27] begin with.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; When you hear the truth,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; it does something to you.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Now, say, "Well, I got it. I got it. I
[1:31:35] got the answer." No, not necessarily.
[1:31:36] Remember the remember the when he made
[1:31:39] himself known to the 70s said why this
[1:31:41] is a deep saying how can he how can he
[1:31:43] come from God and come here to the earth
[1:31:45] and
[1:31:47] this is a hard saying why we know where
[1:31:49] he was born where his mother and father
[1:31:51] was but he turned to his disciples and
[1:31:54] said would you go also seeing that
[1:31:56] they've left because that was a hard
[1:31:57] saying
[1:32:00] they went and cast out devils they were
[1:32:02] given power those 70
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't receive the word being
[1:32:06] manifest for their season.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Turn to his disciples, say,
[1:32:12] will you go also?" And Peter said those
[1:32:14] words.
[1:32:15] He said, "Where would we go?
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; We are certain.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; We we know,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; And he said, "It's revealed to me and I
[1:32:24] can speak for it. You are the son of the
[1:32:26] living Christ, the the son of the living
[1:32:28] God."
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; And we know you have the words of
[1:32:32] eternal life. Yeah,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; we can't go back to those dead
[1:32:36] denominations. They don't have anything.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; I we don't understand what you maybe
[1:32:41] just said, but we know,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; You have the words of eternal life. We
[1:32:46] know this prophet has the perfect
[1:32:48] interpretation of the word. I may not
[1:32:50] understand. And there is things I don't
[1:32:52] understand, he said, but I know,
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; that we're hearing the words of eternal
[1:32:59] life.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Will that man make mistakes? Many
[1:33:03] mistakes. Did he have his ups and downs?
[1:33:05] Plenty of them.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; But the message he brought was the
[1:33:10] logos.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Remma. Rema is the written
[1:33:15] word.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Logos is the hidden word.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Same word. But there's a thought in that
[1:33:23] written word that it can only be known
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; to his people.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now that that brother sister that
[1:33:30] that's that's that's that's a Greek
[1:33:32] interpretation that of the of the logos.
[1:33:35] What logos is it's not something that is
[1:33:38] just patched up.
[1:33:41] That's exactly what it is. It's a
[1:33:43] thought. You can't have a word without a
[1:33:45] thought. So where so what God was
[1:33:48] expressing his word was first a thought.
[1:33:51] And when you're hidden in the word and
[1:33:53] you're expressed in your season by the
[1:33:55] word, you're called by the word. You're
[1:33:58] brought by the word. You're given life
[1:34:00] by the word. Then you are in his thought
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; and he expressed it in the word.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And that's why you can't disbelieve this
[1:34:11] message.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; You can't disbelieve the word because
[1:34:15] you always were a part of that.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; I didn't do anything to merit it. I'm
[1:34:26] coming to that real quick now. 2
[1:34:28] Corinthians 3. And I've got to hurry.
[1:34:31] 2 Corinthians. And you know how I am.
[1:34:33] I'm I go a little longer than the hour.
[1:34:40] I'm not saying that tongue and cheek. I
[1:34:42] I can't. For 40 plus years,
[1:34:46] I've tried my best to keep it down.
[1:34:49] I'm going to do what God wants me to do.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:52] that I know is much better because he's
[1:34:54] perfect in all of his ways. So watch,
[1:34:57] I'm going to close when he says close.
[1:35:01] Amen. All right. I'm not I'm not saying
[1:35:03] that arrogantly. I'm saying that by
[1:35:05] grace.
[1:35:08] 2 Corinthians 3
[1:35:11] verse 6 verse two, excuse me, 2-6.
[1:35:16] You are our writ You are our epistle
[1:35:20] written in our hearts where
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; written in our hearts known and read of
[1:35:28] all men. So something's being manifested
[1:35:31] here that makes you different. You're an
[1:35:33] oddball to a lot of them but makes you
[1:35:35] different because you are a living
[1:35:37] epistle. You're a living word that I'm
[1:35:40] preaching to you. Paul said, "Written in
[1:35:42] my heart, written in our hearts, and
[1:35:44] we're declaring it
[1:35:46] because we're called to declare it." The
[1:35:49] Levites were to carry the message and
[1:35:51] make it move over their hearts, not a
[1:35:53] new cart like they're trying today. Push
[1:35:55] play.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "You shouldn't have said that."
[1:35:57] I'm not afraid to say anything that's
[1:35:59] contrary to the word.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; You know that's not right.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Because you've taken it out of the hands
[1:36:05] of God's ordained way of bringing it.
[1:36:07] Yes.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; And the bride won't stand for that.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; It's not that I don't I don't dislike
[1:36:15] people. I do.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; But the bride's going to stand for that
[1:36:18] word
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; regardless.
[1:36:21] We believe in in standing stay at home
[1:36:23] and listening to tapes. If you don't,
[1:36:25] you need to get into it and start
[1:36:26] feeding it. You need to be pushing play
[1:36:28] some more. But to say you do so and come
[1:36:30] to a meeting and that's all you do and
[1:36:32] controlled by an organization and
[1:36:34] controlled by a head that's trying to
[1:36:36] tell you what to say and play and not
[1:36:37] play
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; is off the word.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It's off of the word. I'm going to tell
[1:36:45] you right now. I'm not You say you're
[1:36:47] pretty bold. I can be bold, but he's
[1:36:48] more bolder than I am. My Lord and he'll
[1:36:51] tell you what's right and not right.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Stay away from it.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Not stay away from people. Stay away
[1:36:58] from that system.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; All right? Because it's not leading you
[1:37:03] down the road.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; All right? Now, verse 2, three. For so
[1:37:08] much, listen to this carefully. Now, for
[1:37:11] so much as you are individually, you are
[1:37:13] manifestly declared to be the word of
[1:37:16] God, the word of Christ, ministered by
[1:37:19] us, written not with ink, but with the
[1:37:23] spirit. You're not, it's not written by
[1:37:25] ink, the rema. It's not by ink. It's by
[1:37:27] the spirit, logos. It's by the spirit of
[1:37:31] the living God. Not in tables of stone
[1:37:35] or table or or upon paper.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to me. Tables of stone, but
[1:37:43] but in the fleshly tables of the heart.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Okay? And such trust, I love this. Such
[1:37:54] trust have we through Christ. Through
[1:37:57] who? Christ to God word. What's going to
[1:38:00] please God? Our faith.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Without faith it's impossible to please
[1:38:03] God. So we have this trust to God. The
[1:38:05] faith trust to God word. In this we
[1:38:09] recognize our place. We recognize our
[1:38:11] position. And in this we have such trust
[1:38:14] to God word. Amen. Amen. This is what he
[1:38:18] wanted. Not that we are sufficient of
[1:38:20] ourselves to think anything as of
[1:38:24] ourselves,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; but our sufficiency is of God.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Watch the next verse. Who hath made us
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; able ministers of the new covenant.
[1:38:37] That's the new testament of the blood.
[1:38:40] Are you with me? New covenant.
[1:38:43] Not of the letter. Hallelujah.
[1:38:46] not of Remma
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; letter.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody reads the letter. Everybody
[1:38:53] has the letter and they misinterpret the
[1:38:55] letter and they misrepresent the letter.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; And they say, "We don't need a prophet.
[1:39:00] We have the letter."
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Or we do need a prophet. Won't take
[1:39:06] anything else. No, take no minister. I
[1:39:08] won't go there. I've already done gone
[1:39:10] there. All right. So
[1:39:13] who also hath made us able ministers of
[1:39:15] the New Testament, not of the letter,
[1:39:17] but of the spirit?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; The spirit of what? The letter.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; The spirit of inside the letter.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; The spirit
[1:39:30] uh the spirit by the spirit we are able
[1:39:33] ministers. For the letter kleth,
[1:39:37] but the spirit giveth life. life to what
[1:39:43] the word.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. All right. Now, so four
[1:39:51] chapter 1 verse chapter 4 verse five.
[1:39:58] For we preach not ourselves but Christ
[1:40:02] Jesus the Lord. Logos
[1:40:07] by the what? Spirit. By the same spirit.
[1:40:09] and ourselves, your servants, ourselves,
[1:40:12] your servants for Jesus sake. Now, I'm
[1:40:16] going to skip six. We preached on six
[1:40:18] here a lot. Let me go on to seven. But
[1:40:20] we have this treasure in earth and
[1:40:23] vessels. What What do you have this
[1:40:25] birth word? Verse six, birth word
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; in earth and vessels that the excellency
[1:40:31] of the power may be of God
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; and not of us. Right.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Then it goes on to say, we're going to
[1:40:39] be struggling, being tested, being
[1:40:40] tried, but not cast down, persecuted,
[1:40:43] but not see, having what? Such trust to
[1:40:48] know that we are himself revealed.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I read to you, Logos.
[1:40:55] Isn't that wonderful and beautiful? John
[1:40:57] says, "The concept of God was expressed
[1:40:59] in Jesus. He calls his sheep by name,
[1:41:02] and he leadth them out." Now, isn't that
[1:41:05] something?
[1:41:06] He calleth. Didn't the Bible say he
[1:41:08] called his sheep by name and leads them
[1:41:10] out?
[1:41:11] What name did he call them by?
[1:41:16] Was it David Dehar? Hey, David. No, it's
[1:41:18] not what he said.
[1:41:20] Remember brother Brandham said when the
[1:41:21] mystery is revealed? It wasn't saying
[1:41:23] like Lord Norman Neville here says not
[1:41:25] his name.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Not your name.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Whose name is it? It's the revealed
[1:41:31] word.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; It's the mystery revealed. That's what
[1:41:35] calls your name.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Who was he? The me, the ministry, the
[1:41:40] word revealed.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; And so what calls your name? That
[1:41:43] mystery revealed.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; The mystery of the book is revealed. And
[1:41:47] it calls your name
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; because you were in the logos to begin
[1:41:52] with.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; You were the word logos to begin with.
[1:41:59] All right. Now, church age book, page
[1:42:03] 163. I'm going to bring out these just a
[1:42:05] real short version of this because I've
[1:42:07] said it before many times. Now,
[1:42:10] according to the word, the bride was
[1:42:12] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:42:13] world. Paragraph 163. And this choosing
[1:42:16] of the bride was purpose in himself.
[1:42:20] Ephesians 1:9. And in ro purpose the
[1:42:23] purpose of purpose in himself didn't
[1:42:25] wasn't yours. It was his purpose.
[1:42:28] I'm trying to hold back on saying so
[1:42:29] much about the and in Romans let it
[1:42:32] speak for itself that the purpose of God
[1:42:35] Romans 9:11 said the purpose of God was
[1:42:37] according to election might stand you
[1:42:40] can't read it any other way the heart
[1:42:43] purpose
[1:42:44] the eternal there's only one eternal
[1:42:47] life that's God
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Satan is not eternal there's only one
[1:42:52] eternal life that's God and he had
[1:42:54] thoughts of himself which we're reading
[1:42:56] right here now watch remember The word
[1:42:58] is a thought. The logos is a thought
[1:43:01] revealed or expressed. I mean, and then
[1:43:04] it being expressed, it's revealed.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; That's that supernatural element.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Because the the expression or the
[1:43:13] message can go out and you hear the
[1:43:15] speech, it's either logos to you or
[1:43:18] remma.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; But if it's logos, then you're hearing
[1:43:24] the word. If it's speech, if it if it's
[1:43:27] rema, the revelation's there, but you're
[1:43:31] not picking it up. Why?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Because you're not a part of the logos.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; If you miss it, you've got to be a part
[1:43:38] of the logos to hear him speak the word
[1:43:40] today.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Because it was sent to those that were
[1:43:43] in him.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Now, you see, begin to see we have a
[1:43:50] text. We have the text. We have the
[1:43:52] revelation. But despite the revelation,
[1:43:55] there still has to be a supernatural
[1:43:56] element here.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; That is the knowing of it to you
[1:44:00] personally.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; It's an element. It's not an idea. It's
[1:44:05] not imagination. It's a substance.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; It's known to you. It's revealed to you.
[1:44:12] You can't explain it. I cannot explain
[1:44:15] to you this morning this thing. I can
[1:44:17] only speak it. It takes God to make the
[1:44:21] revelation. And when it's revealed, it
[1:44:23] won't leave the word. It'll back up the
[1:44:25] word. And you begin to see it here and
[1:44:27] here and here and here and here and over
[1:44:29] here. And the whole word becomes alive
[1:44:31] and personalized
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; to you and I.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Is that what's happening?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; The logos is being personalized. God's
[1:44:44] being personalized. Personalizing
[1:44:46] himself
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; to individuals, to his bride.
[1:44:51] this mystery. Here's the secret. The
[1:44:54] mystery revealed. The mystery is
[1:44:56] revealed in the bride.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; The secret is the word is in her.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:45:06] Praise the Lord. That's it.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; The word is in her.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; It was in you to begin with. You didn't
[1:45:11] put it there.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; I didn't put it there. What makes you
[1:45:15] able to hear that word, to receive it?
[1:45:17] Because God would put it there.
[1:45:21] That's what makes us different. That's
[1:45:22] what makes us yearn for him. That's what
[1:45:24] makes us obey him.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; You know, there's only three physical
[1:45:29] ordinances that God said we had to obey.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; And some of them won't obey that.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; It shows you what's wrong with your
[1:45:37] what's wrong with your your your
[1:45:40] um that's it. That's what I want to say.
[1:45:42] Experience with God.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Three things. Communion, foot washing,
[1:45:48] and water baptism. Yeah.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; After that, it's up to God to do all the
[1:45:51] rest of it. Who brought you to
[1:45:53] repentance? Who put it in your heart to
[1:45:55] to express publicly that I believe that
[1:45:57] Jesus Christ died for my sins? I'm
[1:45:59] willing to take his name and by an
[1:46:02] outward expression show that I died with
[1:46:04] him and I've raised with him.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; In his name.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, did it? Well, that's all right.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. Good landing. All right,
[1:46:18] then my marker.
[1:46:21] Okay,
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; you see what I'm talking about?
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; And he said, if you'll do that, the
[1:46:27] reason more people aren't really born
[1:46:28] again or receive the Holy Ghost because
[1:46:30] there never was a true repentance. You
[1:46:32] just followed somebody else. You just
[1:46:34] had it in your mind. Well, though, and
[1:46:35] so I'll do it. I don't want to make them
[1:46:37] think I'm not religious. You know,
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; there's got to be a true repentance.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not judging it. I'm telling you the
[1:46:46] truth.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; If there is, then you said you would
[1:46:49] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; which is the Holy Ghost unveiled in you.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Showing you're a part of that logos.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Then you're on your way to a full
[1:46:59] adoption, which is a body change.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; And you come to that adoption revealed
[1:47:04] in you that you are Christ and Christ is
[1:47:06] you and we're one.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; That's it, my brother.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's the
[1:47:16] truth.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; So, you know what?
[1:47:19] No, I won't say that. Yes, I will say
[1:47:22] that.
[1:47:24] Shake it off and step up.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Now, some in here know what I just said.
[1:47:30] Shake it off. Shake off that old dirt
[1:47:33] that Satan wanting to put on your back
[1:47:34] and wanting to bury you under your
[1:47:36] troubles and under your past and
[1:47:37] everything else. and shake it off and
[1:47:40] step up on the promised word, the logos
[1:47:42] of the word, and march forward with that
[1:47:44] word, and quit you trying to figure it
[1:47:46] out and make it happen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; You just take God at his word and said,
[1:47:49] "I'm settled in my mind, and my mind is
[1:47:51] made up. I'm going to do what God said
[1:47:53] to do as a wife. I'm going to do what
[1:47:55] God said to do as a husband. I'm going
[1:47:56] to do what God said to do as a child.
[1:47:58] I'm going to do what God said to do as a
[1:48:00] parent."
[1:48:05] and quit putting your reasoning to it
[1:48:07] and putting other voices ahead of it
[1:48:09] because that's nothing but Satan trying
[1:48:11] to get you under a spirit of something
[1:48:14] else above what God said.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; That's idolatry.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you're idolatry. I'm
[1:48:20] saying that's an idolatrous spirit.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] I don't know why I said all that, but
[1:48:30] anyway, I want to get back to what I
[1:48:31] have here.
[1:48:33] And the purpose was himself. He decreed
[1:48:35] it. His any purpose of God would take a
[1:48:38] bride of his own choosing. And the
[1:48:40] purpose was in himself. And being
[1:48:42] eternal was decreed before the
[1:48:43] foundation of the world. Decreed.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before it was ever written, it was
[1:48:51] decreed.
[1:48:55] For in the beginning was the decree.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; What was it before the beginning?
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes, sir.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Where were you when I when the sons of
[1:49:06] God shouted for joy? Where were you when
[1:49:09] I laid the foundations of the earth?
[1:49:12] Where were you? If you see where you are
[1:49:15] and see that you're that eternal, then
[1:49:17] you're his eternal thoughts, which I'm
[1:49:19] going to read right here. He said, "The
[1:49:21] eternal thoughts of God." Let me ask
[1:49:23] you, are the thoughts of God eternal?
[1:49:26] Other words, the thoughts of himself,
[1:49:28] are they eternal? Yes. If you see this,
[1:49:30] you will see many things. God is
[1:49:32] unchangeable in both essence and
[1:49:34] behavior.
[1:49:36] All right? See how he works. See how his
[1:49:40] this works. God always had his thoughts
[1:49:42] for Adam. Adam as his thoughts was yet
[1:49:44] unexpressed. And in Psalm 139, there it
[1:49:48] was. It was in him already to begin. But
[1:49:51] then in the beginning he expressed Adam.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; When did he express Adam?
[1:49:58] When was the open door of Adam? When
[1:50:00] when did the open door open up? Under
[1:50:02] the sixth day.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And in the seventh he
[1:50:06] had his creation. Under the seventh day.
[1:50:10] Amen.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; He brought forth who?
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; And and where was what was the center of
[1:50:18] Eve's? What was the center of Mrs.
[1:50:20] Adam's revelation?
[1:50:23] It was Mr. Adam.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Because he was there revealing God and
[1:50:30] and the center of her revelation was
[1:50:33] him.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; And when that revelation came into her
[1:50:37] being a part of him,
[1:50:40] she was the complete revelation of him.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; She didn't come from another source. She
[1:50:48] came from him.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? All right. Now, so
[1:51:04] once. Okay. Now it says that the now God
[1:51:08] he says now to Jesus was the logos. He
[1:51:12] was the perfect and complete thought
[1:51:13] expressed and he became known as the
[1:51:16] word. That is what he is and forever
[1:51:19] will be logos. All right. Now it says
[1:51:22] that he has chosen us in him. Now then
[1:51:24] brother Dave you say brother David why
[1:51:26] do we read the word? Because you have to
[1:51:28] read it
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; to receive it.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; You have to hear it to have faith.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Because without faith it's impossible to
[1:51:38] please him. And faith comes by hearing
[1:51:40] the word.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; That's what's being preached to you here
[1:51:43] this morning. Is that faith?
[1:51:49] and it's being expressed.
[1:51:51] And faith comes by hearing the word.
[1:51:57] The five-fold ministry doesn't have
[1:51:59] anything that's not anything of the
[1:52:01] selves. They are simply by revelation
[1:52:05] carrying the word, progressing, moving,
[1:52:07] making the word move forward.
[1:52:10] They can't move the word any other way
[1:52:12] but on the hearts of the Levite.
[1:52:15] But it's not for them. It is for them,
[1:52:17] but it's for you.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; It's for the bride. God has a way of
[1:52:23] taking. He said, "You men, take this and
[1:52:26] carry it forth. Bring more light on it."
[1:52:31] And why are they trying to do the
[1:52:33] opposite?
[1:52:35] You see? See what I'm saying? Okay. Now,
[1:52:40] now it says that we were chosen in him,
[1:52:44] Jesus the logos, before the foundation
[1:52:46] of the world. That means we were right
[1:52:48] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[1:52:50] of God before the foundation of the
[1:52:52] world. That gives an eternal quality
[1:52:55] quality to the elect element. That gives
[1:52:57] an eternal quality to the elect. All
[1:53:00] right. Amen. So you can see
[1:53:07] that what that germ that you were to be
[1:53:09] at the beginning. Well, I'll get to
[1:53:11] that. Okay, just give me just a just a
[1:53:14] little bit here and I'll finish.
[1:53:18] Now
[1:53:20] in the message
[1:53:23] because we were already in him, not we
[1:53:25] will be. We are now sitting in Christ
[1:53:27] Jesus. How do we get into it? By one
[1:53:30] Holy Ghost baptism. by one spirit we are
[1:53:32] all baptized or born or birthed into
[1:53:35] Christmen
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; which we are now won't be in Christ we
[1:53:41] are he's the great spiritual king over
[1:53:43] the spirit that's in us because we were
[1:53:45] in him at the beginning
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; see in the beginning he thought of you
[1:53:50] and thought of others like that thought
[1:53:52] of himself of being tangible then what'd
[1:53:54] he do he decreed it
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; he expressed it in a word that was his
[1:53:59] thoughts and so brother Bram He
[1:54:01] expressed his thoughts by word.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; That's why you hear the word. All right.
[1:54:13] The eternal God with eternal thoughts,
[1:54:16] thought and decreed. Word in Romans
[1:54:17] 9:13. Jacob have I loved.
[1:54:22] Have I past tense. Jacob have I loved.
[1:54:26] Esau have I hated.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:30] Now, what did God know that he hated in
[1:54:33] Esau? And what did God know that he
[1:54:35] loved in Jacob?
[1:54:40] And here's the answer.
[1:54:43] And neither of them was born, neither
[1:54:46] had done good or evil.
[1:54:48] Amen.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; But he's saying before they were born, I
[1:54:52] love Jacob
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; and I ate Esau. And he knew they would
[1:54:56] come out of one individual.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Isaac's wife.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Both predestinated
[1:55:04] husband and wife.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; But it's not a natural seed.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; All right. But in the natural seed,
[1:55:12] something else in there.
[1:55:15] All right. Now watch. See, it was here's
[1:55:19] the answer. See, it was the thought.
[1:55:23] And that thought became expressed and
[1:55:26] God brought back Jacob be because Jacob
[1:55:30] alone was seed.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:35] Jacob alone had the seed. That's why he
[1:55:38] had respect to the birthright and
[1:55:40] covenant of God.
[1:55:42] Remember, see the covenant. We're not
[1:55:44] preaching the covenant by a letter. The
[1:55:47] New Testament. If you are true seed, you
[1:55:50] will hear that word.
[1:55:52] You will hear the word. The spirit that
[1:55:55] here is different here. And the spirit
[1:55:58] will baptize you. And it's not these
[1:56:00] ears what I'm saying. You hear with your
[1:56:01] heart. You will hear that word. The
[1:56:05] spirit will baptize you into the body of
[1:56:07] Christ filling you and empowering you.
[1:56:10] And you will receive the word for your
[1:56:13] day
[1:56:15] and age.
[1:56:19] See how clear the truth. He's just
[1:56:21] bringing you the evidence now of the
[1:56:23] birth. See how true the true evidence
[1:56:26] becomes when the word is revealed to you
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; that your seed see how the evidence is
[1:56:33] again note Jesus was the royal seed
[1:56:38] is not the bride the royal seedmen
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the royal seed. Let me say the
[1:56:42] bride is the royal seed. He lived in a
[1:56:44] human body and you live in a human body.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; All right. When the spirit called him,
[1:56:50] the word the word when the spirit called
[1:56:53] to him, watch what he watch what the
[1:56:55] spirit called to him by the word
[1:56:57] manifested thought.
[1:57:00] He called to him by the logos.
[1:57:03] Okay?
[1:57:05] He went to Jordan as was there baptized
[1:57:07] in water and upon obeying the word the
[1:57:09] Holy Spirit came upon him and the voice
[1:57:11] said, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye
[1:57:15] him." What about Revelation 22:17? The
[1:57:19] spirit and the bride say come. And under
[1:57:22] her messenger, she becomes the final
[1:57:24] voice. So what is that voice saying
[1:57:26] again today? This is he. Hear ye him.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; What is the bride? This is he.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; What's the bride saying today? This is
[1:57:41] he.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Here's a revelation of what is happening
[1:57:44] today. Here's the revelation of how I
[1:57:46] come. Here's the mystery of his coming.
[1:57:48] This is he,
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; the son of man revealed. This is he in
[1:57:52] bride form. This is he.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; My
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; what a powerful word we have. What a
[1:58:02] message.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; The voice did not say this has become my
[1:58:08] son.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the son. The bride is the
[1:58:14] wife. The bride is the son. How do you
[1:58:16] know? How do you know you who are who
[1:58:18] you are? Because you are bearing a
[1:58:21] eternal word child inside.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is bearing children.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; And what is that child?
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; The promised word coming forth.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Just as it was Sarah being the type.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:41] She had to be changed before she could
[1:58:44] have that conception.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; So do you.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; You have to come to the birth. You got
[1:58:52] to be changed before you can receive
[1:58:54] that conception before that can be
[1:58:56] revealed to you. And you're bearing his
[1:58:58] child.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; The bride's bearing children. She's
[1:59:02] pregnantated with the word for the hour.
[1:59:04] She's bearing children.
[1:59:07] The veil has been broken and you know
[1:59:09] it.
[1:59:11] Hallelujah.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; And who is this that's coming inside of
[1:59:16] you? It's you, the real you.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; And you know that that's him in you.
[1:59:22] That union is made because you're
[1:59:24] bearing his life. It's a revelation to
[1:59:28] you.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; And it ties right into the word because
[1:59:31] it brings the word to life to you day by
[1:59:34] day, word by word. Here a little, there
[1:59:37] a little.
[1:59:42] I say, "Brother David, this is too hard
[1:59:43] for young people." I reject that. That
[1:59:45] is not too hard for young people to
[1:59:47] understand. They must be born again just
[1:59:49] like you.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; And it's not what you're figuring out.
[1:59:55] It's what he reveals. Listen, I was 14
[1:59:59] years old when God laid this in my heart
[2:00:02] that this message was sent by a prophet
[2:00:03] and that message was truth.
[2:00:07] Now, what's kept me all these years?
[2:00:09] It's the same power that can keep you.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; That same power, that same spirit called
[2:00:18] to me. I respond to that call. Who put
[2:00:20] that in me to respond to that word? I
[2:00:22] was in a chicken yard, but I heard the
[2:00:24] word of an eagle.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; And that inside of me, I didn't
[2:00:30] understand everything, but it responded.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; And I said, that's what I want.
[2:00:37] And from the age of 12, I've never
[2:00:39] turned around. That because of his grace
[2:00:42] and his keeping power has kept me. And
[2:00:44] if it'll keep me, he'll keep you other
[2:00:46] young people.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Have I made mistakes? Have I ired? Have
[2:00:52] I failed? Absolutely. But his power has
[2:00:55] kept me because every time it comes
[2:00:57] right back to the word again, right back
[2:00:59] to the word again. Right back to the
[2:01:01] word again. Why? because I as an
[2:01:03] individual in him as under an eternal
[2:01:05] purpose that must be made manifest of
[2:01:08] himself.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Okay, we're we're close to a closing
[2:01:19] now.
[2:01:20] The voice did not say it's become my
[2:01:22] son. Jesus was the son. The Holy Ghost
[2:01:24] positioned him as the son before them
[2:01:26] all. Then having been filled thus, and
[2:01:28] the same pattern holds at Pentecost and
[2:01:30] ever after down to this day, he went in
[2:01:33] demonstrated power, receiving the full
[2:01:35] revelation of God and from God for this
[2:01:39] day.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; For that day, and it's this day.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; There's your identification.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; There's your seal. Nobody can that devil
[2:01:49] can't come in and take that out of you.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; You're sealed till the day of your body
[2:01:54] change.
[2:01:56] and you rest in it. That's your rest.
[2:01:59] You ceased from your own labor. All
[2:02:01] right.
[2:02:07] Hebrews 10. I'm going to go over this
[2:02:10] quickly. Hebrews 10. I've got to close.
[2:02:12] I know that. Just bear with me. Hebrews
[2:02:15] 10. Because I only have one opportunity
[2:02:17] to preach this.
[2:02:23] I'd love to break it up to about a
[2:02:24] fivepart series,
[2:02:27] but Hebrews 10. So, you get to have to
[2:02:30] put up with me a few times.
[2:02:32] Hebrews 10 verse 5.
[2:02:39] Wherefore he cometh into the world,
[2:02:41] speaking of Christ, he saith, sacrifice
[2:02:44] and offering, thou wouldest not, but a
[2:02:46] body hast thou prepared me?
[2:02:48] Amen. Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; In burnt offerings and sacrifice for
[2:02:52] sin, thou hast had no pleasure. Then
[2:02:54] said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the
[2:02:58] book. There's your log go. There it is.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Behold, I come in the volume
[2:03:05] of Rema
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; in the volume of the book. I there's an
[2:03:11] element in here. In the volume, there's
[2:03:12] an element. There's a supernatural
[2:03:14] element.
[2:03:16] It is written of me to do thy will, oh
[2:03:19] God. It is written of me to do thy will.
[2:03:22] Can you realize it today, Abide? It's
[2:03:23] written of you to do his will.
[2:03:28] The word speaking about you
[2:03:31] speaks of you. And Paul says the very
[2:03:34] same thing in Hebrews 1-3. God who sund
[2:03:36] times in diverse manners spake in times
[2:03:39] past unto the fathers by the prophets
[2:03:41] hath in these last days spoken unto us.
[2:03:44] What's your Bible say? Next word.
[2:03:48] By.
[2:03:50] I I'm sorry. I didn't ask you to turn to
[2:03:52] it.
[2:03:53] Here's what the Here's what this the
[2:03:55] King James says. Hath in these last days
[2:03:58] spoken unto us by his son.
[2:04:01] Brother Brandham said that was the wrong
[2:04:02] interpretation.
[2:04:05] It should have been in.
[2:04:09] And so we read it in the way it's
[2:04:11] supposed to be.
[2:04:13] hath in these last days spoken to us in
[2:04:16] his son. Prophet has in logos or prophet
[2:04:19] has in parentheses logos whom at hath
[2:04:22] his son logos whom he hath appointed
[2:04:25] heir of all things by whom he has also
[2:04:27] made the worlds. Who being in the
[2:04:29] brightness of his glory, what about you
[2:04:31] Isaiah 60? Who be in the brightness of
[2:04:34] his glory and the expressed image of his
[2:04:36] person and upholding all things by the
[2:04:38] word of his power. When he hath by
[2:04:40] himself purged our sins, he sat down on
[2:04:43] the right hand of the majesty on high.
[2:04:45] That is your position.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; God became expressed in the person of
[2:04:52] Jesus Christ. How is he be what's being
[2:04:54] expressed in the bride? The person of
[2:04:58] Jesus Christ. Jesus was the expression
[2:05:02] of himself. Jesus was the express image
[2:05:05] of God. Who's the bride? The expression
[2:05:07] of himself.
[2:05:09] John 1 1:14. And the word was made flesh
[2:05:15] and dwelleth among us.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; What are we holding forth? What are we
[2:05:20] upholding now when he upheld the word of
[2:05:22] his power? In Philippi Philippians 2:16,
[2:05:26] he said he's holding we are to hold
[2:05:28] forth the word of life.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sorry you guys getting to work
[2:05:32] so fast, but I'm reading these things.
[2:05:34] I'm not having you turn to them. Now, 1
[2:05:37] John 1-3. Now I've read that that's in
[2:05:39] the beginning was the word
[2:05:42] for the life was manifested. Now watch
[2:05:44] what he said. That which was from the
[2:05:46] beginning which we have heard logos with
[2:05:48] our eyes have seen which we have looked
[2:05:50] upon our hands have handled the word
[2:05:52] logos of life. For the life was
[2:05:54] manifested we've seen it and bear
[2:05:56] witness and show unto you that eternal
[2:05:57] life which was with I'm sorry this is
[2:06:00] first John 1:13 1-3 not St. John what
[2:06:04] first John
[2:06:06] which was with the father and was
[2:06:08] manifested unto us. That which we have
[2:06:10] seen and heard we declare unto you. That
[2:06:13] which we have that you may have
[2:06:15] fellowship with us and truly our
[2:06:17] fellowship is with the father and with
[2:06:19] his son Jesus Christ.
[2:06:23] So that which is from the beginning
[2:06:24] which we have heard. Logos means speech.
[2:06:26] We have seen with our eyes handled with
[2:06:28] our hands. See okay. When God was
[2:06:32] revealed in revealed, he was manifested
[2:06:35] in flesh. Amen. He hath he that was
[2:06:40] manifested in flesh. He that hath seen
[2:06:43] me, he said, has seen the father. In
[2:06:47] Luke 10, I'm just going to read this
[2:06:48] real quick because I'm coming to a close
[2:06:50] here. In Luke 10,
[2:06:53] I don't want to hurry this, but I've got
[2:06:55] to. So, I'm just going to have to get it
[2:06:57] over to you. You can hear the tape again
[2:06:59] if you want. If you're interested, you
[2:07:01] can always pick it up again.
[2:07:03] Luke 10 on tape. Listen to me back in
[2:07:06] the old age.
[2:07:09] You can pick up the recording
[2:07:12] 10. Luke 10
[2:07:16] and verse 21.
[2:07:18] In the hour in that hour Jesus rejoiced
[2:07:22] in spirit. I thank thee, Father, Lord of
[2:07:24] heaven and earth, for thou has hid. He's
[2:07:28] hiding something from the wise and
[2:07:30] prudent.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Wise theologians,
[2:07:35] prudent them that just got to dress
[2:07:37] certain way. Everything got to be a
[2:07:38] certain way and all prudent. See
[2:07:41] e intellectuals. These things from the
[2:07:44] wise and prudent and hast revealed them
[2:07:47] unto babes. Talk about God in
[2:07:49] simplicity.
[2:07:51] Revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[2:07:53] Father, so it seemth good in thy sight.
[2:07:56] Who's he revealing to? Who's he
[2:07:58] revealing himself to? His seed.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:05] In the hour g in that hour Jesus
[2:08:07] rejoiced in spirit and said, "I thank
[2:08:09] thee, oh father, lord of heaven and
[2:08:11] earth." Oh, I'm sorry. Verse 22, all
[2:08:14] things are delivered to me of my father.
[2:08:16] And no man knoweth the father but the
[2:08:18] son. Knoweth the son, excuse me.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Who the son is but the father. And who
[2:08:23] the father is but the son. and to he to
[2:08:27] whom the son will reveal him.
[2:08:31] And he turned unto his disciples and
[2:08:33] said privately, notice, privately,
[2:08:36] blessed are the eyes which see and the
[2:08:39] things blessed are are the eyes which
[2:08:42] see the things that you see. Understand?
[2:08:46] For I tell you that many prophets and
[2:08:48] kings have desired to see those things
[2:08:50] which you see and have not seen them and
[2:08:52] to hear those things which you hear and
[2:08:54] have not heard them. So is it today
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; because the mystery was hid but now
[2:09:00] opened.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; He said brother Brown speaking here on
[2:09:07] sir is this the sign of the end sir. He
[2:09:10] said the mysteries here the mysteries
[2:09:12] plural here is the mystery. A mystery is
[2:09:16] in scripture is a previously hidden
[2:09:19] truth divinely revealed but which is a
[2:09:23] supernatural element still remains
[2:09:26] despite the revelation. Now this is what
[2:09:29] the prophet said when the super under
[2:09:32] the seventh seal when the supernatural
[2:09:34] comes in that's the mind of Christ.
[2:09:39] He said, 'Now don't ask me to explain
[2:09:41] that because I can't and I won't. He
[2:09:44] said, either you're ordained to receive
[2:09:46] it or you won't receive it.
[2:09:49] What's he speaking of here? The logos.
[2:09:54] When the supernatural comes in,
[2:09:57] first Corinthians 2:16 said, "We have
[2:10:00] this mind of Christ." Who's he speaking
[2:10:03] to here? What is that mind of Christ?
[2:10:06] That's the thought expressed in the
[2:10:10] word.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. Hebrews 3:15.
[2:10:18] I'm just I'm I'm truly I am closing. So
[2:10:20] just hold on tight and I'm thankful you
[2:10:24] have been patient. Three. You see, you
[2:10:26] only have to put up with me certain
[2:10:27] times. So Hebrews 3:15,
[2:10:34] while it is said today, now I'm
[2:10:36] expressing that because we're talking
[2:10:38] about today,
[2:10:40] not only this day, but this hour, this
[2:10:42] time. While it is said today, if you
[2:10:46] will hear his voice, harden not your
[2:10:50] heart as it in the provocation. Amen.
[2:10:53] For some,
[2:10:55] for some, when they heard did provoke,
[2:10:58] how be it not all that came out of Egypt
[2:11:00] by Moses, not all of them provoked, they
[2:11:03] came out by Moses, but with whom was he
[2:11:05] grieved 40 years? Was it not them which
[2:11:08] had sinned? Unbelief, whose carcass fell
[2:11:10] in the wilderness? And to whom swear he
[2:11:13] that they should not enter into his
[2:11:15] rest, but to them that believed not. So
[2:11:18] we see that they could not enter in
[2:11:20] because of unbelief. Chapter 4 verse
[2:11:23] one. Let us therefore fear lest a
[2:11:26] promise being left us of entering in to
[2:11:28] his rest any of you should seem to come
[2:11:31] short of it. For I for unto you for
[2:11:34] excuse me unto us that's you and I was
[2:11:38] the gospel preached as well as unto
[2:11:40] them. But the word, here it is, the word
[2:11:43] preached, logos preached, did not profit
[2:11:46] them, not being mixed with faith in them
[2:11:51] that heard it.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. I could say a lot on
[2:11:55] that, but I'm not going to. All right.
[2:11:57] Jeremiah 31.
[2:12:02] Jeremiah.
[2:12:04] Wonderful book.
[2:12:12] Okay.
[2:12:15] 31
[2:12:18] 31 and verse 33.
[2:12:23] But this shall be the covenant that I
[2:12:25] will make with the house of Israel after
[2:12:27] those days, saith the Lord. Now, what
[2:12:30] was promised, Brother Brham said, to
[2:12:32] Israel applies to us also the same word.
[2:12:36] But we know they're a nation and we're a
[2:12:38] people and we're the queen and they're
[2:12:39] the nation. After those days, sayeth the
[2:12:42] Lord, I will put my law in, watch what
[2:12:44] I'm preaching to. I will put my law in
[2:12:46] their inward parts and write it in their
[2:12:50] hearts. After what days?
[2:12:54] After the law, after it's passed,
[2:12:58] after that grace is taken over, I will
[2:13:00] put my law in their inward parts and
[2:13:02] write it in their hearts, and will be
[2:13:05] their God, and they shall be my people.
[2:13:07] And they shall teach no more every man
[2:13:09] his neighbor, and every man his brother,
[2:13:11] saying, "Know the Lord." For they shall
[2:13:13] all know me. I said to know him is life.
[2:13:17] They shall all know me, from the least
[2:13:19] of them unto the greatest of them,
[2:13:22] sayaeth the Lord. For I will forgive
[2:13:23] their iniquity, and I will remember
[2:13:25] their sin no more. Now, you can find
[2:13:28] that in this in the scripture over in uh
[2:13:33] well, in the New Testament, I won't I
[2:13:35] just won't refer to it right now, but it
[2:13:37] says the same thing.
[2:13:40] All right?
[2:13:42] And said to know him is life, to see St.
[2:13:46] John 10:14 said, "I know my own and am
[2:13:49] known of them. I know my sheep and I'm
[2:13:51] known of them." All right. Then in St.
[2:13:54] John 5:24, he that understands 5:24
[2:13:57] said, "He that heareth my word and
[2:13:59] believeth on him that sent me here. He
[2:14:01] that heareth my rema but then believeth
[2:14:06] on me.
[2:14:08] He that can hear me and believeth
[2:14:10] receive it has what?" pass from and
[2:14:14] believeth on me shall not come into
[2:14:17] condemnation but is passed from death
[2:14:19] unto life. So he that understands
[2:14:22] brother Brandham speaking that scripture
[2:14:23] he that understands knows his place in
[2:14:26] this hour is who Jesus is speaking to in
[2:14:30] in Christ the mystery St. John 5:24
[2:14:33] said, "He that heareth my word
[2:14:35] said,"That isn't just sitting listening
[2:14:37] to it." That's receiving it. See,
[2:14:39] receiving it. You believe it. Something
[2:14:41] inside of you tells you it's right.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Something inside of you tells you it's
[2:14:47] right. You've accepted it. You believe
[2:14:49] it. It's yours.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; You hear with your heart.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Romans 10.
[2:14:58] Romans 10
[2:15:01] and verse 18
[2:15:04] 16. Now talking about preachers, how can
[2:15:07] they hear except a preacher? And how can
[2:15:08] a preacher
[2:15:10] preacher preach unless he's sent?
[2:15:14] Okay. And verse,
[2:15:18] excuse me, I went to eight here. 10.
[2:15:21] Okay. 10:16.
[2:15:24] But have they not all obeyed? But they
[2:15:26] have not, excuse me, all obeyed
[2:15:30] the gospel. For Isaiah said, Lord, who
[2:15:33] hath believed our report?
[2:15:36] And then faith cometh by hearing, and
[2:15:38] hearing by the word of God.
[2:15:44] But I say, have they not all heard?
[2:15:47] See that question there? Have they not
[2:15:49] all heard? Yes, verily. Their sound went
[2:15:51] into all the earth and their words unto
[2:15:54] the end ends of the world. So they heard
[2:15:57] it
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't receive it. Why?
[2:16:00] What was what was the sound they were
[2:16:02] hearing? The sound they were hearing the
[2:16:04] bride was speaking the thought declared
[2:16:06] in in words spoken.
[2:16:09] See the sound was the thought was being
[2:16:11] declared in the word spoken. Make known
[2:16:14] one's voice. So the so the so the sound
[2:16:17] was to make known that voice and that's
[2:16:19] what the bride's doing. She's making
[2:16:21] known that voice under her messenger.
[2:16:24] Okay, I won't go there. Christ in you is
[2:16:26] the mystery of God revealed. You are the
[2:16:28] secret revealed. So if Christ is in you,
[2:16:31] if the mystery is revealed,
[2:16:33] if Christ is in you, then the mystery is
[2:16:36] revealed.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; That's that's it. Christ in you, the
[2:16:42] mystery is revealed.
[2:16:48] The body must follow the head.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Are you with me?
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:16:57] But Eve walked away, she was deceived.
[2:16:59] She was in the transgression. Adam was
[2:17:01] not deceived.
[2:17:04] See, so when Jesus come forth, he came
[2:17:06] to redeem her, which is his body. She
[2:17:09] has to be redeemed in order to come to
[2:17:11] him. Do you see it? Oh my. See it? It
[2:17:13] couldn't have happened then because
[2:17:16] it couldn't have happened then. Other
[2:17:18] words, the redemption, it's not all
[2:17:20] finished yet. The redemption's going on.
[2:17:22] He redeemed them, but the redemption's
[2:17:24] going on. So, you see the seals when he
[2:17:27] was in his mediatorial work back there
[2:17:29] redeeming. But someday he comes forth to
[2:17:31] get this book that he's redeemed. And
[2:17:34] all that's in this book would be him.
[2:17:36] For that's the believer, the words in
[2:17:39] the book. There's where I said the word
[2:17:41] would be sealed. But now it's unsealed,
[2:17:43] unsealed. That's the believer. The
[2:17:46] word's in the book. The word is him, the
[2:17:48] logos. All, and you're that logos. All
[2:17:51] that was in him,
[2:17:54] excuse me, all that's in that he come
[2:17:56] forth for this book of redemption, whose
[2:17:59] names are written in the book before the
[2:18:00] foundation of the world when he was
[2:18:02] slain. And there he is today. And here
[2:18:05] he is today in his word, manifesting the
[2:18:08] same thing he did there. She can't
[2:18:10] recognize another headship. No sir,
[2:18:12] there's no bishop or nothing. She
[2:18:14] recognizes one headship. That's Christ
[2:18:17] and Christ is the word. Oh my, I love
[2:18:19] that. Now, we don't come together. This
[2:18:22] is token. We don't come together to talk
[2:18:25] about the message. We come together to
[2:18:27] get in the message.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; And the message is Christ. He is the
[2:18:31] word.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. We're We're to get
[2:18:36] into it. Get beneath it.
[2:18:41] Yes, sir. That's what we're supposed to
[2:18:44] do.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Can't you see where you're standing?
[2:18:47] Life is in the grain. What is it? Just
[2:18:49] exactly like the same grain that went in
[2:18:52] the ground. The same Jesus in the bride
[2:18:54] form. Same power, same church, same
[2:18:57] thing, same word. The same word sucked
[2:19:00] up through these and come out here and
[2:19:02] come to a head here. The same word
[2:19:05] sucked up through the these what? These
[2:19:06] ages and come to a head here. What head?
[2:19:09] What form is that head in? Bride form
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; and come to a head here. All that life
[2:19:16] that come see because we have the
[2:19:18] message of the hour is the capstone
[2:19:20] ministry. And all that life that suck up
[2:19:23] through here picked up its people. Now,
[2:19:25] now watch what he's saying. Now, this is
[2:19:27] what I said. It's her. Now, it's forming
[2:19:29] up into a head. What's forming up into
[2:19:32] the head? Picked up its people. Now it's
[2:19:35] forming up into the head for the
[2:19:38] rapture.
[2:19:40] That germ, listen to this quotation.
[2:19:43] I've heard this a long time. It just
[2:19:45] really struck me. That germ that was in
[2:19:48] you at the beginning?
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; In what at the beginning? The logos.
[2:19:53] That germ that was in you at the
[2:19:56] beginning
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; found you.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Right here today.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; There's John 1-2. God forces upward. The
[2:20:06] spirit of God, which is the word of God,
[2:20:08] forces upward. My word is spirit and
[2:20:10] life. That will put the bride in her
[2:20:13] place because she'll recognize her
[2:20:16] position in the word. Then she's in
[2:20:18] Christ. Will put her in her place. No
[2:20:22] national force will do it. You can have
[2:20:26] all the national force, the political
[2:20:27] force you want. It'll never put the
[2:20:29] bride in her place. Stand with me,
[2:20:30] please.
[2:20:32] What a resurrection this is. If you
[2:20:34] could come, Ruth and
[2:20:38] What a resurrection this is.
[2:20:41] Amen.
[2:20:42] What'd he say? Arise, my love, my fair
[2:20:46] one, and come away. This message is his
[2:20:50] love letter to the bride. This message,
[2:20:55] his love letter, his voice, his logos,
[2:20:58] his thought expressed to his bride. She
[2:21:00] and she alone is able by his grace to
[2:21:02] read between the lines.
[2:21:08] That's the logos
[2:21:10] in between the lines.
[2:21:13] [Music]
[2:21:14] Why?
[2:21:16] Because you were his to begin with. And
[2:21:19] he expressed that thought. And when he
[2:21:21] wrote that love letter, he was
[2:21:22] expressing his thought.
[2:21:27] So you know what he's saying. Who lets
[2:21:30] you know that?
[2:21:32] He
[2:21:34] is revealing it to you cuz you have his
[2:21:36] mind. You have his thought. You see what
[2:21:40] the word is saying.
[2:21:44] Amen.
[2:21:47] Lord Jesus,
[2:21:49] I've taken a long time this morning.
[2:21:52] That was not my intention. Not what
[2:21:53] never is my intention. But Lord, I
[2:21:56] believe that this was perfectly what you
[2:21:59] had designed.
[2:22:03] Lord, thank you for giving us patience.
[2:22:06] This whole world is filled with
[2:22:07] impatience
[2:22:11] and the things are speeding up because
[2:22:13] technology is speeding up.
[2:22:17] And Lord, we're caught up with such
[2:22:20] ambition that we can't even have
[2:22:21] patience hardly. We must have it right
[2:22:23] now. Right now. Right now. But Lord,
[2:22:25] you're teaching us patience,
[2:22:30] not a man teaching you patience. What is
[2:22:33] going to be revealed will be revealed in
[2:22:35] your time. We think it has to be
[2:22:38] revealed right now, but Lord, it'll be
[2:22:40] in your time concerning us.
[2:22:43] We know what time we're in, but your
[2:22:45] time of revelation to us individually as
[2:22:48] we feed upon the open book will be in
[2:22:50] your time. Then where's that word go
[2:22:53] then, Lord? Then the final voice comes
[2:22:55] out. And you shall prophesy again to
[2:22:59] nations, tongues, and kings.
[2:23:02] Where is that word? Who's hearing the
[2:23:05] voice? Lord, I pray there's many here
[2:23:08] this morning that has heard the voice
[2:23:11] and is hearing the voice.
[2:23:15] Lord, now I commit this service to you
[2:23:17] and every individual set here and I
[2:23:20] appreciate them, Lord. I love them. You
[2:23:22] know, I love them with all my heart
[2:23:25] and I've poured out my heart in this
[2:23:27] today. And I pray that by grace that you
[2:23:29] would continue to unveil yourself to me
[2:23:32] and by grace unveil yourself to them.
[2:23:34] And together we march forward in step
[2:23:40] to the change of our bodies.
[2:23:43] For we're marching out, Lord, you saw
[2:23:46] her and we're a part of that word. We're
[2:23:48] part of that symphony. We're a part of
[2:23:50] that move for it's thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:23:52] The move is on for the bride
[2:23:56] now. Lord, I give thee praise and
[2:23:57] thanks. We give you honor in Jesus name.
[2:24:00] Amen. Amen.
[2:24:04] Amen.
[2:24:06] If that's the last
[2:24:08] message I ever preach,
[2:24:11] I know that I preached the truth.
[2:24:18] You know what? I've got to stand someday
[2:24:22] with him and give an answer for
[2:24:25] everything I've said to you this
[2:24:26] morning. I'm well aware of that.
[2:24:33] It hasn't been said to mix up doctrines.
[2:24:36] Hasn't been said. It's been said to get
[2:24:39] out of you, you out of a rut
[2:24:43] and into freedom.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and in real joy and reality of the
[2:24:49] revealed Christ in you. When Christ is
[2:24:51] revealed, we were just talking about
[2:24:52] that, brother Isaac. When Christ is
[2:24:55] revealed in you and I, the mystery is
[2:24:57] unfolded. That's reality.
[2:25:02] Thank God for the reality
[2:25:04] of seeing our position in Christ.
[2:25:10] I want to sing two songs. Can I sing
[2:25:12] two? Can we sing two songs?
[2:25:15] Let's sing the first one. It's the
[2:25:17] original life.
[2:25:20] Do you believe that? What we've spoken
[2:25:23] here today is the original life. You
[2:25:25] know what the token is? The original
[2:25:27] life
[2:25:29] on display. But he said for us to get
[2:25:31] beneath it. When you get beneath it,
[2:25:33] you've come through it. You've come
[2:25:35] through the blood.
[2:25:37] [Music]
[2:25:39] And you're going to hear. You have an
[2:25:41] ear to hear. He that hath an ear to
[2:25:44] hear, let him hear, and my sheep
[2:25:48] know me, and my sheep hear my voice.
[2:25:53] Amen.
[2:25:55] God's attributes were manifested to his
[2:26:00] bride at this last age. We have caught
[2:26:04] the revelation by the prophets message
[2:26:09] and we know who we are and what we are
[2:26:14] raised up for. Praise the Lord
[2:26:18] for the original life.
[2:26:22] The original lies,
[2:26:25] the original seed,
[2:26:28] the original word
[2:26:31] is what I believe.
[2:26:35] The son of man is revealed. The seventh
[2:26:39] seal is unveiled. The original life,
[2:26:44] the original seed.
[2:26:48] We are the word. Let's start again.
[2:26:51] We are the word made flesh today. This
[2:26:56] is what the scriptures say and our names
[2:27:00] are seen within. Redeemed, perfect
[2:27:03] without sin. Yes, we are anointed
[2:27:09] and inspired by our God logos. Who's the
[2:27:14] original life?
[2:27:17] The original life.
[2:27:20] The original seed,
[2:27:24] the original word
[2:27:27] is what I believe. Amen. Can you say it?
[2:27:31] And a man is revealed. Seventh seal
[2:27:35] personally to you. Original life,
[2:27:40] the original seed.
[2:27:43] Our eyes of understanding. He has opened
[2:27:48] up at last and sweet victory is ours.
[2:27:53] Who were chained down in the path. Oh,
[2:27:56] true jubilee has sounded and we have
[2:28:01] responded to our God
[2:28:05] whose original life.
[2:28:08] The original life token.
[2:28:11] The original seed.
[2:28:14] The original word
[2:28:17] faith is what I believe.
[2:28:21] The son of man in bride form. The seven
[2:28:25] seal is unveiled. The original life,
[2:28:30] the original seed.
[2:28:34] We are called unto adoption, full
[2:28:38] authority. Amen. Hallelujah. Sleeping
[2:28:41] saint, wake and join us. More
[2:28:44] translation in this hour. Gentile days
[2:28:48] soon be over.
[2:28:51] Glory hallelujah to our God
[2:28:56] whose original lie.
[2:28:59] Oh, the original lie that's me. The
[2:29:03] original seed me also. The original word
[2:29:07] that's me is what I believe.
[2:29:12] The son of man revealed through me.
[2:29:15] Seventh seal in me. The original life,
[2:29:21] the original seed.
[2:29:25] Amen.
[2:29:28] Amen. The voice of my beloved. Let's
[2:29:31] sing that before we go. Amen. Can you
[2:29:34] hear the voice of your beloved? Can you
[2:29:37] hear the logos?
[2:29:40] Amen. The voice I don't know what.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Manifesting time.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Manifesting time. Sorry.
[2:29:48] The voice of my beloved.
[2:29:52] Behold, he quickly comes. Sweeping over
[2:29:56] the mountain, over the hills he runs.
[2:30:01] Oh, I long to hear his voice. I long to
[2:30:06] hear him say. You have
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; already. The message has said it. Amen.
[2:30:15] It's manifesting time. The fruits. But
[2:30:20] have you really heard it? Amen. Is
[2:30:23] coming in plain view.
[2:30:27] Oh. to cap God's chosen bride.
[2:30:31] Redemption draweth nigh. He's that
[2:30:35] lovely one. He's coming in plain view.
[2:30:40] The grapes are yours and mine. Little
[2:30:44] foxes, be careful those little foxes,
[2:30:47] for the vineyard blossoms for her
[2:30:50] harvest time.
[2:30:54] Keep your eyes on things above.
[2:30:57] Don't look at me or yourself. See that
[2:31:01] lovely one. He's coming in plain view.
[2:31:06] Oh yes, it's manifesting time. The
[2:31:10] fruits are on the Amen. It's manifested
[2:31:15] through the branch.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:19] Oh, to cap God's chosen bride.
[2:31:23] Redemption draweth nigh. He's that
[2:31:27] lovely one. He's coming in plain view
[2:31:32] while in the cliff of the rock. Hidden
[2:31:36] in the secret place so high. Till the
[2:31:40] day break and the shadows flee away.
[2:31:45] Oh, in that mountain place, a sweet
[2:31:50] smell is coming through. He's that
[2:31:53] lovely one. He's coming in plain view
[2:31:57] more and more because it's manifesting
[2:32:00] time.
[2:32:02] Fruits are on the vine and the lovely
[2:32:05] one is coming in plain view.
[2:32:10] Bride time. Oh, the cap. God's chosen
[2:32:13] bride headstone.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; He's that lovely one. He's coming in
[2:32:21] plain view. Oh, to cap God's chosen
[2:32:26] bride. What form
[2:32:29] today is the bride in the headstone.
[2:32:33] You're a rock in the rock.
[2:32:37] You're that peace in him.
[2:32:41] The formation of himself is revealed
[2:32:45] through the bride form.
[2:32:47] God bless you. Be with you till we meet
[2:32:50] again.
