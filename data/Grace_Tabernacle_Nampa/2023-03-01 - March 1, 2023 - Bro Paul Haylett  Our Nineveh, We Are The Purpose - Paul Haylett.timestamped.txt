[25:47] doing and have that Everlasting Joy
[25:51] bubbling in our soul amen like to
[25:54] welcome tonight our sister clark I
[25:56] believe it was Sister Sophie that spoke
[25:59] to you uh probably there in the store
[26:02] and
[26:03] um so I say God bless you and welcome
[26:05] this evening amen so I want to speak to
[26:09] you
[26:10] tonight on um a continuation of
[26:16] Nineveh of Jonah now Brother David just
[26:20] he sure did a number on my on my thought
[26:24] but I've just decided I'm I've got to
[26:27] preach it anyway amen and so uh we just
[26:31] want to uh remember it's good to see you
[26:34] brother basili amen thought maybe you're
[26:37] still out on the road but it's good to
[26:39] see you in the house of God tonight
[26:42] um let's just stand as we go into the
[26:44] word of God tonight and um
[26:46] amen I I just um
[26:50] you know I love that quotation you know
[26:53] that when Satan comes in and believes
[26:56] he's defeated a son or daughter of God
[26:59] they just rise up
[27:01] and they just press in even harder than
[27:04] before and I thank the Lord for that
[27:06] because some days should be declared
[27:09] Monday and Friday all together mixed up
[27:11] and done but my brother and sister it
[27:13] doesn't matter because we're not living
[27:15] here in the circumstance we're living in
[27:18] the promise of God and let's just turn
[27:20] in the Book of Jonah the third chapter
[27:22] and uh we want to if you go back brother
[27:26] Gideon to the title there I want to make
[27:28] emphasis of that as we look in Nineveh
[27:32] Saints let's not look at just the
[27:35] historical side of what happened there
[27:37] of what was with Jonah but remember
[27:40] when God sends his word there's always a
[27:43] purpose and the purpose is not to build
[27:46] big churches not to build all kinds of
[27:49] Glorious things on earth we are the
[27:50] purpose and so I thank God today that we
[27:54] literally in our generation have had
[27:56] another moving of the Holy Spirit coming
[27:59] down touching lives changing lives and
[28:02] as it is we wouldn't look at it in the
[28:05] way that Nineveh itself responded but we
[28:07] sometimes maybe should to literally come
[28:11] down and say forgive us Lord and and to
[28:15] be as it were that they put on sackcloth
[28:18] and Ashes which was a sign of repentance
[28:20] my brother and sister it was a sign of
[28:22] surrender as a sign of uh being a broken
[28:25] people and uh sometimes today you know
[28:29] if we're not careful we have people go
[28:32] down a dry Sinner and come back out of
[28:34] the water a wet Center and what we want
[28:37] to do is is truly be able to recognize
[28:40] our purpose and to respond to the word
[28:43] of God in the fashion that God would
[28:45] desire us to do so Jonah the third
[28:48] chapter and we will just read uh verses
[28:52] 1 through 10.
[28:54] and the word of the Lord come unto Jonah
[28:57] the second time saying arise go into
[29:00] Nineveh that great City and preach unto
[29:03] it the preaching that I did thee
[29:07] my so God's come back isn't this not a
[29:10] gracious God
[29:12] Jonah ran
[29:14] God said
[29:15] I've chose you Jonah for this job
[29:18] and Saints look at our own lives I
[29:20] certainly can look at my life and my
[29:22] youth and I run and
[29:24] God give me more than two chances and
[29:28] I'm thankful for that
[29:30] arise and go into Nineveh that great
[29:32] City and preach into it the preaching
[29:34] that I bid thee so Jonah Rose and went
[29:37] into Nineveh according to the word of
[29:39] the Lord now Nineveh was an exceeding
[29:41] great city of three days journey and
[29:44] Jonah began to enter into the city a
[29:47] Day's Journey and he cried and said yet
[29:50] 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown
[29:53] so the people of Nineveh believed God so
[29:57] they didn't recognize Jonah for Jonah
[30:00] right they realized this was a message
[30:02] that come from God
[30:04] they believed God and proclaimed her
[30:06] fast and put on sackcloth and from the
[30:08] greatest of them even to the least of
[30:10] them for word coming to the king of
[30:13] Nineveh and he arose from his throne and
[30:15] laid his robe from him and covered him
[30:18] with sackcloth and sat in ashes
[30:22] and he caused it to be proclaimed and
[30:25] published through Nineveh by the decree
[30:28] of the king and his Noble saying let
[30:31] neither man nor Beast heard nor flock
[30:34] taste anything let them not feed nor
[30:37] drink water but let man and beasts be
[30:40] covered with sackcloth and cry mightily
[30:43] unto God yea let them turn everyone from
[30:47] his evil way
[30:48] and from the violence that is in their
[30:51] hands imagine if a president of the
[30:53] United States would stand before a
[30:56] nation and make this kind of Declaration
[31:00] my my brother and sister people say it's
[31:02] impossible
[31:04] but Nineveh was a heathen City
[31:08] my we don't even sometimes want to use
[31:10] the word heathen in our churches anymore
[31:12] because it kind of offends people
[31:15] but my brother and sister there's a lot
[31:16] of heathens around and when it's God
[31:19] doing the work and not man
[31:22] that does not offend
[31:24] that registers in the heart I need God
[31:27] amen
[31:30] but then man and Beast be covered with
[31:31] sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yea
[31:34] let them turn everyone from his evil way
[31:37] and from the violence that is in their
[31:39] hands who can tell if God will turn and
[31:41] repent and turn away from his Fierce
[31:43] anger that we perish not and God saw
[31:46] their works that they turned from their
[31:48] evil way and God repented of the evil
[31:51] that he had said that he would do unto
[31:54] them and he did it not Heavenly Father
[31:57] we're asking you this evening just come
[31:59] make The Word Alive to us father just
[32:01] lead us and guide us in this thought
[32:03] Lord that we could express it correctly
[32:06] the way we ask you father just to walk
[32:08] the aisles of our hearts speak to us
[32:11] individually and as a group tonight I
[32:13] pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen it
[32:17] may be seated
[32:28] I think it's very obvious that God has
[32:31] personalized his message to each one of
[32:33] us we would each tell our testimony our
[32:36] story of our life and the things that
[32:39] have brought us to the place that we are
[32:41] led us to a personal relationship with
[32:43] the Lord Jesus Christ and you know
[32:45] there's nothing like receiving a
[32:47] personalized message my brother and
[32:49] sister I know I've made reference
[32:50] through the years of this but there's
[32:52] nothing like going to a banquet or a
[32:55] wedding reception or uh something like
[32:58] that and you sit and you go there and
[33:01] and uh you are seated at the table and
[33:03] you realize it wasn't a random choice
[33:05] that put you there but literally in
[33:07] front of you is something gold embossed
[33:10] or engraved that has your name on that
[33:12] and you realize that this was a very
[33:14] personalized uh uh invitation or message
[33:17] to you and you know it is meant this
[33:20] personalized message of our Lord Jesus
[33:22] Christ was meant to attract our
[33:24] attention and I think we could all lift
[33:26] a hand tonight and say that it did
[33:28] exactly exactly that amen brought us to
[33:30] a place that we realized it wasn't just
[33:32] a Bible talking about people that were
[33:35] Sinners and needing to repent and and be
[33:38] baptized and and uh filled with the Holy
[33:41] Ghost but we saw our name in there and
[33:44] uh we recognize as we read the Bible uh
[33:47] we recognize that that this is a very
[33:50] personalized message that God is giving
[33:52] because we start to read ourselves into
[33:54] the scripture so it's not a generalized
[33:57] thing that some people need to do this
[33:59] but we start to look at this and say I
[34:02] need to do this and that's what moves us
[34:04] amen and you know God had personalized a
[34:07] message for Nineveh it was there my
[34:09] brother and sister God did not recycle
[34:11] pardon me for using this phrase he
[34:13] didn't regurgitate another message from
[34:16] another city another time or another
[34:18] place but God had personalized this
[34:20] message to Nineveh so personal amen he
[34:24] harnessed now I want you to see how God
[34:26] works God did not come down down there
[34:29] and and uh Jonah come and start talking
[34:31] about your doctor and his faults he
[34:33] didn't go into the City and tell him you
[34:35] got all these gods and all these evil
[34:37] things that you worship and you're lost
[34:39] for money and possessions and your pride
[34:41] he didn't come down there he come down
[34:43] and God harnessed their belief amen God
[34:46] harnessed the very thing they looked to
[34:49] and he harnessed that to bring their
[34:51] attention to this and so there it is
[34:54] they have this belief in a fish God and
[34:56] you know from the moment amen that that
[34:59] Jonah is there on the beach now my
[35:01] brother and sister you can go find all
[35:03] kinds of literature that people say this
[35:05] is impossible it's just a story an
[35:07] allegory analogy whatever it might be
[35:09] but my brother and sister I I don't know
[35:12] many many years ago I guess I just come
[35:14] to a place that I'm just ignorant enough
[35:16] to believe every word of this amen I'm
[35:19] not going to stand here and say I I can
[35:21] explain this away or science says or
[35:24] some very well-educated man come and has
[35:27] proven something my brother and sister
[35:29] if the Bible says it I believe it and
[35:31] you know what it has not failed me yet
[35:34] amen I don't believe there's one of us
[35:36] tonight not very many of us here because
[35:38] of sickness and travel and whatnot but
[35:40] there's not one of us can say that this
[35:42] has come short in our life and so it's
[35:45] there the power of the word that God
[35:47] come and says you know what I'm going to
[35:48] catch their attention now it was the
[35:51] attention he didn't come with the fish
[35:53] God Ministry
[35:55] he come of the ministry of Jehovah
[35:59] amen so he didn't have to compromise to
[36:01] get their attention but God used what
[36:04] was there and what they looked to to
[36:07] catch their attention and then the word
[36:09] of God was preached to them and it
[36:12] become real so real a big city amen I
[36:15] don't know how many people were in
[36:17] Nineveh and it really doesn't matter but
[36:19] it calls them now my brother and sister
[36:21] the word
[36:24] doesn't really give us the full picture
[36:27] of each one of these individuals that
[36:29] were there
[36:31] did it stick
[36:33] could we have went back a year later and
[36:35] found them still serving God we don't
[36:37] know but what we do know is that God
[36:41] will shake heaven and Earth for one soul
[36:45] so there it is in Nineveh there were
[36:48] people in Nineveh regardless if some
[36:51] turn back to their ways people want to
[36:52] argue whether they've all converted my
[36:55] brother and sister I don't care it might
[36:57] have been just one soul but God said I'm
[36:59] going to shake Nineveh for one soul and
[37:02] I know how to get the attention of that
[37:04] one Soul or maybe one family whatever it
[37:07] might have been but it's God knew what
[37:10] to do amen so it was there that every
[37:13] part of this journey of of uh Jonah was
[37:17] to bring him now people would say you
[37:19] know Jonah was backslid well my brother
[37:22] and sister he might have kind of had a
[37:25] different deal will if we can get along
[37:26] to it we'll kind of touch on that we
[37:29] wouldn't necessarily agree I think it'd
[37:31] be safe that we could say tonight that
[37:33] if God asked us to do something we ought
[37:35] to just pick up right there and just go
[37:37] do what he asked but God said I don't
[37:39] need a man to worry about Jonah getting
[37:42] away I've already got the whole plan in
[37:44] place for Jonah in fact let's just
[37:47] entertain the fact that that
[37:49] was the fact that God knew Jonah would
[37:52] do that so he just tailored it that way
[37:56] I build this around the nature
[37:59] come on
[38:00] are you with me got to build his program
[38:03] around our human nature
[38:07] now we would be there raised a certain
[38:10] way having certain fears or complexes
[38:13] and God doesn't say I'll have to crush
[38:15] them to die and rebuild them God says no
[38:17] I'll tell you what I'll do I'll let him
[38:19] run so far and then when they're in that
[38:22] moment I'll just come and I will do what
[38:25] I was going to do all along and at that
[38:27] point they'll agree amen that's called
[38:29] permissible will
[38:33] but God's will will be done
[38:37] and I'm thankful for that
[38:41] so it was designed to bring a focus you
[38:43] know my brother and sister
[38:45] when Jonah went there started preaching
[38:49] he wasn't preaching a generic God
[38:52] and I think that's one of the problems
[38:54] we have in the world today that we can
[38:56] preach a generic God and it sounds like
[38:58] we're talking about Jehovah the Lord
[39:00] Jesus Christ but really we're preaching
[39:02] about a generic God one that's very
[39:05] acceptable to almost every class of
[39:07] people in every circumstance of life
[39:09] that they can all say yes I believe what
[39:11] do you believe amen this word of God is
[39:14] a life-changing gospel it is a word that
[39:18] takes us from the Mind reclaims the song
[39:20] says and lifts us on high we're not
[39:23] looking for just people to acknowledge
[39:24] or sign a name to something we're
[39:26] looking for a life changer amen we're
[39:29] looking for something that would do this
[39:32] see it's a powerful enough message my
[39:34] brother and sister to touch the greatest
[39:37] in the kingdom and the least in the
[39:39] kingdom and so this word my brother and
[39:41] sister a powerful message I don't think
[39:44] of the day we're living in people talk
[39:46] about power but do they really
[39:48] understand the power that is given to
[39:50] the Christian amen it is not power to
[39:53] speak Mighty boastful things but it is
[39:56] the power to live a Godly holy
[39:58] ghost-filled life in one of the most
[40:00] wicked worlds it has ever been that
[40:02] power lifts us up out of that my reclaim
[40:05] and guides us to a life that's clean and
[40:08] holy before God
[40:10] oh people want to say power is I
[40:12] prophesied this or I claimed it I claim
[40:14] my Bentley I claim my Mansion I claim
[40:16] this and that my brother and sister none
[40:18] of that gets us in the Kingdom what gets
[40:20] us in the kingdom is the Holy Ghost and
[40:23] character that is built by the word of
[40:25] God Amen so we find many interesting
[40:28] types in this tonight amen we see the
[40:31] gospel as it came to you and I we see
[40:35] the gospel coming from the Jews to the
[40:37] Gentiles and if you have been as we have
[40:40] been recently you'll realize that the
[40:43] Jews still feel very Superior to
[40:45] Christians they feel like that we had
[40:48] him first
[40:49] and yours is just really actually a
[40:51] copycat
[40:53] if you don't think so go listen to what
[40:55] some of these rabbis are preaching even
[40:57] now in the last 90 days in Israel there
[41:00] is no Jesus there is only Jehovah but
[41:03] they miss the fact that Jehovah of the
[41:06] Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New
[41:08] Testament and they can't see that
[41:10] because it didn't fit their concept
[41:14] but lest not us fall into that absolute
[41:17] of that that we have a concept that it
[41:19] must fit what we need to do is say Lord
[41:22] you are the guide I will follow Lord
[41:25] give me the courage to follow you
[41:27] wherever you would take me Lord
[41:31] um
[41:33] amen you know
[41:36] I won't belabor that but um
[41:41] I've just you know from our trip to
[41:43] Israel I've just been following through
[41:45] on some things and you know it's
[41:47] interesting how they're
[41:50] are so many
[41:52] rabbis
[41:54] listening to around by speak the other
[41:56] day
[41:58] and he said well let me tell it to you
[42:00] straight he's speaking to a good-sized
[42:02] group of people let me tell it to you
[42:03] straight that Mary girl should have been
[42:06] taken out and stoned
[42:08] hmm
[42:09] that's their perspective
[42:13] failing to see
[42:16] that the lamb
[42:18] that was prophesied had come and walked
[42:21] in their midst and they completely
[42:23] failed to see him
[42:25] and the scripture says Their Eyes Were
[42:27] blinded that the word could be opened to
[42:29] you and I and so I look at this and I'm
[42:32] not judging them my brother and sister
[42:33] but realizing the power of the prophecy
[42:37] that they would be blinded so that we
[42:40] could see because here they are today
[42:42] good men righteous men with good
[42:44] reputation and they're saying not Mary
[42:47] should not have been honored she should
[42:49] have been stoned blind
[42:52] blind
[42:53] but the word had to come
[42:56] thank you Lord the word came
[42:59] amen now some people I've heard it said
[43:02] about concerning what happened in
[43:04] Nineveh they called it a Revival
[43:06] but my brother and sister was not a
[43:08] Revival because there was nothing there
[43:09] in the beginning
[43:11] and a Revival is taking back or Reviving
[43:14] to what they had in the beginning so
[43:17] there was nothing so it was not a
[43:19] Revival this was the power of God coming
[43:22] in amongst heathens and absolutely
[43:24] catching their attention and causing
[43:26] them to recognize their position now a
[43:30] powerful move of God have we experienced
[43:32] a powerful move of God my my brother and
[43:34] sister we have seen all kinds of things
[43:36] happen amen we don't glorify we don't
[43:39] want to stop and totally Focus but I
[43:41] tell you you ever watch a broken arm a
[43:44] bent arm come back straight perfectly
[43:46] healthy you have had your attention
[43:49] caught right there God has brought your
[43:51] focus right down and so we see these
[43:54] things now do we run out every day
[43:56] thinking we need to perform that to know
[43:58] God is real and with us no sir I have
[44:01] told you my brother and sister many
[44:03] times I believe that as we look back in
[44:05] our own lives we'll see the Vindication
[44:07] of the word of God because we have been
[44:10] changed Can someone say Amen man amen we
[44:13] are not the creature we once was we have
[44:16] been changed now what does that change
[44:19] does it must change his physical form
[44:21] here on the earth now no my brother and
[44:23] sister God's not redeeming he's not
[44:25] worried about this body he's not
[44:27] investing in flesh he's investing in the
[44:29] soul amen and when you have a heart that
[44:32] was black and God has turned that you
[44:35] recognize the change that the scripture
[44:37] is talking about has taken place and I
[44:40] just want to say thank you tonight thank
[44:42] you Lord for that amen now I just want
[44:46] to keep moving along here
[44:49] did this work do you think
[44:52] that took place in Nineveh suddenly turn
[44:54] everyone in Nineveh into a saint
[44:58] I don't think so
[45:00] the scripture clearly shows us
[45:03] that there's a make-believer
[45:05] an unbeliever and the real believer
[45:08] and so I don't believe God changed the
[45:11] formula just for Nineveh
[45:13] so ultimately
[45:15] if you'd pardon me to say this all of
[45:18] ninama my Nineveh might have had
[45:21] sackcloth and Ashes
[45:23] but some of them never did figure out
[45:25] why
[45:27] and some of them knew why but it was
[45:29] hard
[45:32] isn't it amazing how we can look at this
[45:36] I will agree with individuals they say
[45:38] you know what serving God is hard
[45:40] I agree with him
[45:42] but I don't
[45:46] because a real life-changing event
[45:52] changes that nature it's gone it's done
[45:55] it's finished
[45:58] it's circumstances of life hard
[46:00] can be very hard
[46:02] very very hard
[46:05] but there ought to be something anchored
[46:07] in the soul that says I was called to
[46:10] serve God
[46:11] I was not created and put on the earth
[46:14] and then randomly selected to serve God
[46:16] but from the foundation of the world I
[46:19] was chose to serve God and ultimately
[46:21] the upsets the UPS the Downs the
[46:23] sideways I know I was called to serve
[46:26] God
[46:27] and life can be hard but my brother and
[46:30] sister will look right here and see that
[46:32] the desire that God did we can see the
[46:34] desire for everyone what did what did
[46:37] that happening give Nineveh it gave
[46:39] everyone a time to make their own
[46:41] decision
[46:42] and I believe my brother and sister that
[46:45] the work that God was doing we're not
[46:46] going to dissect that but it was
[46:48] something that was powerful and it gave
[46:50] a people a time to make a decision and
[46:53] and we don't know the decisions that
[46:55] they made nor does it matter because
[46:57] we're looking in history but uh you know
[47:00] what I want to lead up to here is that
[47:03] we shouldn't even judge when God calls
[47:05] us to plant
[47:07] we shouldn't even judge where we're
[47:09] planting
[47:11] if God says speak to that individual
[47:13] pray for that individual invite that
[47:16] person to church it's not our job other
[47:18] than to displant my brother and sister
[47:20] if nothing comes of that that's not our
[47:23] responsibility God just asked us plant
[47:26] amen I go in the spring you know our
[47:29] visitor doesn't know but I'm a farmer
[47:31] and I go in the spring and I don't ask
[47:33] every one of those seeds are you going
[47:35] to grow up to be a good plant I go out
[47:37] there and I plant
[47:39] and I drive and I drive and I drive and
[47:42] I put hundreds actually millions of
[47:44] seeds in the ground in a matter of a few
[47:47] days a few weeks and I am waiting to see
[47:50] but there's something inside of me that
[47:52] says I believe that that seed will grow
[47:55] and when we see men and women Sons and
[47:58] Daughters of God we see the Nineveh of
[48:00] our day God didn't say now go see if
[48:02] they have a seed that will grow he told
[48:04] Jonah go tell them that judgment is
[48:07] coming and let them make the decision
[48:10] what they will do with it but Jonah
[48:12] needed to make that uh decision to
[48:15] present the gospel plant that seed and
[48:18] we're going to touch on something here
[48:19] in a minute then I have to admit I've
[48:22] looked a little bit of commentary on it
[48:23] I've studied in the message you know
[48:25] about this but you look at this my
[48:27] brother and sister and it I'm still
[48:29] perplexed if it's okay to say that don't
[48:32] want to come across like I have an
[48:33] answer for everything because I
[48:35] certainly don't but you know I want to
[48:38] just read Isaiah 15 5 11 first and we'll
[48:41] look at this
[48:43] um
[48:44] Isaiah 55 11 prophecy so shall my word
[48:48] be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[48:50] shall not return unto me void but it
[48:53] shall accomplish that which I please and
[48:56] it shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[48:58] sent it so we have this promise of
[49:01] Isaiah 55 that is telling us that what
[49:04] God has spoken will not return void has
[49:07] God spoken to our Saints amen I sit here
[49:10] tonight and able to say that even in my
[49:13] old sorry conditions sometimes of Life
[49:15] get a little you know as brother Jewell
[49:18] says wowzy wowzy woo you get in those
[49:20] places it doesn't take away from the
[49:23] promise that God gave us we're sitting
[49:26] here as a Jonah running from God having
[49:29] to take the hard way around but God said
[49:32] I've got somebody in Nineveh that needs
[49:34] to hear the word of the Lord for this
[49:36] hour
[49:37] and then the word comes and God has
[49:40] provided now you look at this um
[49:44] there's some other influences involved
[49:46] here though
[49:47] we'll look at this now
[49:50] because Jonah
[49:51] is not a happy camper
[49:54] in fact see I'm Marvel when I read Jonah
[49:58] because I think
[50:00] I'd be terrified to talk to God like
[50:02] this
[50:03] I think I would be like uh you know Lord
[50:06] can I write it down nope that's two
[50:08] that's two I don't know how to do this
[50:10] but it will go into the fourth chapter
[50:13] starting there in the first verse and uh
[50:15] so here's Nineveh is now had a Revival
[50:19] that went all the way to the king's
[50:21] Palace and all the way to the laborer as
[50:24] it were that lives in the back alley the
[50:26] man no one recognizes no one gives any
[50:30] uh Applause or or credibility to he's
[50:34] just a nothing in the back alley and God
[50:36] reached him and reached the king boy
[50:39] that's a pretty broad spectrum when it's
[50:41] all done now all of Nineveh sackcloth
[50:44] ashes a Revival as it were went through
[50:47] town and and it's there it's happened
[50:49] it's tangible it's on the evening news
[50:52] it's in the newspaper all kinds of
[50:54] Flyers have been published and hung up
[50:56] talking about the supernatural now I'm
[50:59] not going to speak ill of this but we
[51:00] have what's happened in in the
[51:02] University or uh College back East here
[51:05] my brother and sister but yet I want to
[51:08] without being negative I don't mean to
[51:10] but when the word of God Goes Forth it
[51:12] can't return void
[51:14] amen and already
[51:18] things are coming out from underneath
[51:20] the rug
[51:22] and
[51:23] we want it to be genuine
[51:26] we don't want it to be to make the news
[51:32] when suddenly
[51:34] people of the religious World showed up
[51:36] to have their picture taken
[51:38] at that University with those young
[51:40] people
[51:42] was that a promotion of the Gospel or
[51:44] was that a promotion of themselves
[51:47] our whole goal should be promoting Jesus
[51:50] Christ that's what we're called to not
[51:53] to make YouTube Tick Tock a Evening News
[51:56] not to and you know suddenly now my
[51:59] brother and sister the reason I'm not so
[52:00] impressed with this now if any of you
[52:02] have been paying attention you realize
[52:04] that they have had a Revival at that
[52:07] college way back I don't remember what
[52:09] year it was but it's been a long time so
[52:11] this is not a new event taking place at
[52:13] this college but this is a time and this
[52:15] is a season that one corner of the whole
[52:18] thing now has got nothing but big
[52:20] cameras for the news and to film it and
[52:22] document it and do whatever what are
[52:24] they documenting what they should do is
[52:26] be documenting the lives that were
[52:28] changed not the big news event to make
[52:31] it to the evening news and say come so
[52:34] what have they done they've tried to
[52:35] commercialize God
[52:37] it's good for Ratings it's good for
[52:39] program it's good for publicities
[52:42] God don't need their publicity my
[52:44] brother and sister God knows how to
[52:46] advertise let me tell you God knows how
[52:49] to advertise and when he wants you and I
[52:52] to see what he's got to offer he will
[52:55] without a doubt present that to you and
[52:58] I he don't need a billboard he don't
[53:00] need a TV commercial he don't need a
[53:02] documentary he needs someone that's got
[53:05] the life of Jesus Christ the fire of God
[53:07] burning in their soul to walk and to
[53:10] live and to do go to work go to a store
[53:13] go to the gas station be in the
[53:16] neighborhood and that's what God's
[53:18] advertisement is not a billboard but a
[53:20] man or a woman that's got the Holy Ghost
[53:23] there is the power of God on display
[53:27] Hallelujah but Jonah in the fourth
[53:30] chapters now
[53:31] and he is not happy
[53:36] we've just saw the power of God sweep
[53:38] through a great City that took three
[53:40] days to travel from side to side
[53:44] and God is moved and we're not happy
[53:50] I look at that and think Jonas got a
[53:52] problem
[53:54] until I recognized I've behaved the same
[53:58] way before
[54:02] see God move and it didn't move like I
[54:04] should I'm not sure that's real I mean I
[54:06] don't know will they last is that a real
[54:08] deal that child went to the altar but
[54:10] sure looks like their little rebellious
[54:11] well I'll tell you what my brother and
[54:13] sister are here in the next few days
[54:14] brother Ron Peterson's going to have in
[54:16] his church a young man I don't know you
[54:18] probably don't know this story but one
[54:20] time they're in Germany
[54:22] that uh God gave brother Ron a vision in
[54:26] the night
[54:26] of a young man to speak out to and tell
[54:29] him to stand up and say I love the Lord
[54:31] and so brother Ron being obedient to
[54:34] what God laid upon his heart is there in
[54:36] the meeting and he recognizes the face
[54:38] of this young man right there in that
[54:40] meeting and he stops at that time and
[54:42] the Holy Spirit says speak it and he
[54:45] says you stand up and say I love the
[54:48] Lord now this kid had been raised in
[54:50] church and he was a ramble rousing
[54:52] Troublemaker the one that secretly
[54:54] behind all the scenes caused all the
[54:56] good Christian kids to stumble and fall
[54:58] and make mistakes and when he stood up
[55:00] and said I love the Lord kids were
[55:02] snickering because they thought there is
[55:04] no way that guy can do that well he'll
[55:07] be preaching he pastors a church in
[55:09] Germany I can't even pronounce the name
[55:11] of the city but he'll be preaching for
[55:13] brother Ron all these years later the
[55:15] most unlikely
[55:17] God didn't say I'm going to choose these
[55:19] that are the smartest the best looking
[55:21] the well-educated I'm going to choose
[55:23] those that seem that uncommonly nothing
[55:25] to be desired about them because that
[55:28] was the nature of Our Lord
[55:30] and so it's there as they look at this
[55:32] and and Jonas
[55:34] he's angry they've had a Revival
[55:37] I use the word Revival just because that
[55:39] fits our vocabulary
[55:41] and you know so if you're there on verse
[55:43] 2
[55:44] amen let's go back a little bit get to
[55:47] verse two so here he is Jonah is not
[55:50] very happy praising to the Lord and says
[55:52] I pray thee O Lord was not this my
[55:54] saying when I was yet in my country
[55:56] therefore I fled uh before unto tarshish
[56:00] for I knew that thou art a gracious God
[56:02] merciful and slow to anger of great
[56:04] kindness and repentance thee of the evil
[56:07] now he is actually saying Lord the
[56:10] reason I didn't is you probably could
[56:12] have sent anybody down to Nineveh you
[56:15] could have sent anybody that would have
[56:16] walked down there and said judgment's
[56:18] coming you've got this short period of
[56:20] time and Jonah is like upset that
[56:22] somehow he's there now why my brother
[56:24] and sister will history might show us
[56:28] that he was a very zealous
[56:31] Jew
[56:33] and he wasn't real fond of these Heathen
[56:36] gentiles
[56:37] I mean
[56:40] they're not even chosen
[56:43] but see he didn't realize that while the
[56:45] New Testament wasn't down on the page
[56:47] yet it had already been written
[56:50] people are like well I just read a
[56:52] commentary the other day just stuns me
[56:53] floors me the man's like well I you know
[56:56] the Bible you know I believe the Bible
[56:58] but I believe possibly the Apostle Paul
[57:01] went too far
[57:04] I'm over here thinking the Apostle Paul
[57:06] did not go far enough
[57:11] hmm
[57:13] so people are believing the Bible needs
[57:16] to either be pruned
[57:19] or fertilized
[57:21] to fit their desire
[57:23] their Outlook
[57:25] they can't accept the word for what the
[57:27] word is
[57:29] so
[57:31] he's saying Lord this is what I've
[57:33] already said this is the reason I didn't
[57:34] want to go down there is because these
[57:37] people are all going to get saved
[57:39] wow
[57:41] that's hard
[57:43] but then again go study the New
[57:45] Testament and see the struggles there
[57:49] concerning Jews and gentiles
[57:52] and how the Jewish
[57:54] Apostles some of them wanted
[57:57] the converts
[57:58] to live like Jews
[58:01] follow these Customs fit into this box
[58:04] that we have prepared
[58:06] what they don't realize is God had
[58:07] prepared a whole new box my brother and
[58:09] sister and that box was not to be
[58:11] limited by the thinking and education or
[58:13] whatever of man but it was God's plan
[58:15] and so we'll see how this has come out
[58:18] he's acknowledging that you're a
[58:21] gracious God a merciful god slow to
[58:23] anger a great kindness and repentance of
[58:25] the evil now therefore now Lord take I
[58:28] beseech you me life my life from me for
[58:31] it'd be better for me to die than to
[58:33] live
[58:35] does this even make sense I ask you I'm
[58:37] not the brightest guy on the Block
[58:40] but does this can we even box this up
[58:42] put a ribbon around this and make any
[58:44] sense how it is that God's done a
[58:46] supernatural work and we want to die
[58:50] that'd be the time we should say thank
[58:52] you Lord let life come let life flow let
[58:55] the liberty of the word flow let life
[58:58] flow my brother and sister in our hour
[59:00] that's what the Holy Ghost is for is not
[59:02] to bring a death into it unless it's to
[59:04] sell but it's to bring life into the
[59:07] church it's a life into the body to
[59:10] raise up a people that will stand before
[59:12] the world and stand before God and
[59:14] declare our God is alive and well amen
[59:17] and so he says beseech take my life
[59:21] it's better for me to die than to live
[59:24] then said the Lord
[59:26] I I'd almost wish I could hear this
[59:28] conversation
[59:29] Jonah
[59:34] look
[59:36] that's how well
[59:38] to be angry Jonah
[59:41] have you found some secret prophet
[59:45] as in gain
[59:48] to be angry
[59:50] well why Jonah
[59:54] now look at this
[59:56] do you see an answer from Jonah
[1:00:00] well we do in a way he just got up and
[1:00:03] went outside the city
[1:00:04] didn't even give enough respect to God
[1:00:06] to give him an answer
[1:00:08] he just gets up goes outside the city
[1:00:10] but you know I'm sure glad that God
[1:00:12] doesn't just throw us away when we do
[1:00:14] stupid silly things
[1:00:16] amen I'm not supposed to use the word
[1:00:18] stupid excuse me
[1:00:20] we have grandchildren
[1:00:23] to do
[1:00:25] things
[1:00:27] and so he goes out to the east side of
[1:00:29] the city and makes a booth and he sat
[1:00:31] down under it in the shadow until he
[1:00:33] might see what would become of this city
[1:00:35] now just forgive me here you know how
[1:00:37] animated I am sometimes imagine now
[1:00:40] here's a little shade he sits down and
[1:00:43] he's like I'm just waiting for this to
[1:00:46] fall apart
[1:00:49] well you know it had to be that way
[1:00:51] otherwise he would have been excited at
[1:00:55] nineveh's response to the preaching of
[1:00:57] the word
[1:00:58] so he is sitting there now in this shade
[1:01:01] I'm waiting for this to come apart at
[1:01:05] the seams I tell you if that's the
[1:01:07] attitude we have towards God's word we
[1:01:09] better find an altar right now because
[1:01:12] our God cannot fail and if he can fail
[1:01:15] what promise and at what date will it
[1:01:18] fail we couldn't trust nothing
[1:01:20] we could never we could never my brother
[1:01:23] and sister just go out and live life
[1:01:25] large amen and testify and knowing that
[1:01:28] at any moment God's going to fail
[1:01:30] we're going to feel led to speak to
[1:01:32] somebody about God washing them wider
[1:01:34] than snow and they say I want to I want
[1:01:37] to I want that I desire that and then we
[1:01:40] would be on eggshells will it happen or
[1:01:43] not can it happen or not uh you know
[1:01:45] God's God's freed this one from an
[1:01:47] addiction but what if God won't come and
[1:01:50] they're sincere from the heart and God
[1:01:51] won't come we we would never we we would
[1:01:54] become a people afraid
[1:01:56] to testify afraid to pray even for our
[1:02:00] own needs in our own lives and our
[1:02:01] families
[1:02:03] much less the assembly and those around
[1:02:05] us
[1:02:07] so what's happened here
[1:02:08] Satan has literally come
[1:02:11] and anointed not say that he got Jonah
[1:02:14] but he's anointed that cloud
[1:02:16] that cloud of doubt and fear is hovering
[1:02:20] over Jonah
[1:02:24] what he needs is a word from the Lord
[1:02:29] and so it's there
[1:02:32] and he comes
[1:02:35] comes to this place
[1:02:38] makes him a booth
[1:02:40] sits down in the shadow
[1:02:42] just to take a wait and see
[1:02:48] I remember one time
[1:02:51] South America
[1:02:54] you have people that have very serious
[1:02:56] needs a lot of young people a lot of
[1:02:58] drugs
[1:03:00] and I remember there was a lovely young
[1:03:02] lady there
[1:03:07] and she said I need Deliverance
[1:03:10] trying to encourage her
[1:03:16] and the response that kept coming was
[1:03:19] I don't think it's for me
[1:03:22] no God will deliver you of this
[1:03:25] situation and of this addiction I I just
[1:03:28] don't know if it's for me
[1:03:32] my brother and sister One Promise of God
[1:03:35] we ought to be all over that we might
[1:03:37] look like we're selfish all over it
[1:03:39] that's my promise
[1:03:40] amen devil get out of the way that's my
[1:03:43] promise it's in the word and I'm a Son
[1:03:46] of God a daughter of God that's my
[1:03:49] promise
[1:03:50] I don't care if you're still addicted a
[1:03:52] year later it's still your promise
[1:03:55] amen but we don't have to set for
[1:03:57] Satan's answer
[1:03:59] so the Lord asked him is it well to be
[1:04:03] angry he goes sits down there makes the
[1:04:05] booth sits under it and the Lord is
[1:04:08] interesting how he can prove things in
[1:04:10] our lives
[1:04:13] have you ever told the Lord no
[1:04:17] I can honestly tell you a time when the
[1:04:20] Lord called me to start ministering I
[1:04:22] told him not a chance
[1:04:25] after a while sitting outside the city
[1:04:28] in my booth
[1:04:34] there's a gourd rose up
[1:04:37] now where'd that seed come from
[1:04:39] God don't need us to go poking seeds in
[1:04:42] the ground he'll grow anything he wants
[1:04:43] to grow anywhere he wants to grow
[1:04:45] anytime he wants to grow it but here is
[1:04:47] this this Gore
[1:04:50] over Jonah the shadow over his head to
[1:04:53] deliver him from his grief and Jonah was
[1:04:55] exceeding glad of this gourd now I don't
[1:04:58] want to just stretch this out too long
[1:05:00] tonight and keep you too long but my
[1:05:02] brother and sister imagine here is a
[1:05:04] City full of thousands and tens of
[1:05:07] thousands of souls that have repented
[1:05:09] for God and Jonah's angry over that but
[1:05:12] here's a gourd growing and it makes him
[1:05:14] happy
[1:05:16] I as I was telling you earlier have no
[1:05:19] answer for this
[1:05:21] I have no understanding of this
[1:05:25] Soul saved
[1:05:27] angry
[1:05:29] a gourd growing
[1:05:31] makes me happy
[1:05:35] but God was proving a point to Jonah
[1:05:39] because then God raised up now you know
[1:05:42] me being a farmer I don't want to sound
[1:05:44] too
[1:05:45] to um
[1:05:51] unfriendly to the environment
[1:05:54] but I'll tell you in years past having
[1:05:57] grown many kinds of crops
[1:06:00] if you go out in a bean crop
[1:06:03] and you see one cutworm
[1:06:07] one
[1:06:08] not a dozen not a hundred not a thousand
[1:06:11] one cutworm
[1:06:13] you go over get back in your pickup you
[1:06:15] drive to the shop you get in the sprayer
[1:06:17] you drive it to the shop you pour all
[1:06:19] kinds of toxic things in there add this
[1:06:21] and add that and you drive out there and
[1:06:23] you
[1:06:25] cutworms are gone
[1:06:29] and God says my answer to Jonah's
[1:06:33] predicament
[1:06:34] is to send this little worm
[1:06:40] and it's going to come
[1:06:42] and it's going to spite
[1:06:46] the gourd
[1:06:51] imagine Jonah lays his head he's happy
[1:06:55] my look how my gourd has grown today
[1:07:00] um
[1:07:01] wakes up in the morning
[1:07:06] foreign
[1:07:08] and then on top of that God said I'm
[1:07:10] going to proved my point with you enough
[1:07:11] Jonah
[1:07:13] and he causes a hot wind
[1:07:15] to come
[1:07:17] and Buffet him
[1:07:21] and the word tells us I'm just going to
[1:07:24] kind of break this down real quick
[1:07:27] the word tells us
[1:07:30] that fiery trials
[1:07:32] are good for us
[1:07:36] the hot wind
[1:07:38] blowing
[1:07:39] on us the fiery trial
[1:07:42] you say but Lord I've served you
[1:07:44] Faithfully why because there's still a
[1:07:46] little Dross he's burning out of us
[1:07:50] and he knew exactly get this saint he
[1:07:53] knew exactly what it would take to get
[1:07:56] the dross out of Jonah
[1:07:58] he didn't throw Jonah away my brother
[1:08:00] and sisters
[1:08:01] Jonah had an attitude problem but God
[1:08:04] didn't take Jonah and throw Jonah away
[1:08:07] God schooled Jonah in the way that God
[1:08:11] wanted Jonah to be able to understand
[1:08:13] and respond
[1:08:15] and I say thank you Lord for that
[1:08:17] because otherwise we'd all got tossed
[1:08:20] away a long time ago but God comes
[1:08:23] that's a hot Wind come and so it is here
[1:08:27] that it come and
[1:08:29] he should be and and Jonah just doesn't
[1:08:31] even know what to do because he's he's
[1:08:34] not happy and verse 10 says the said the
[1:08:39] Lord thou had pity on the gourd
[1:08:41] for the witch that thou Hast not labored
[1:08:44] nor made us it grow which come up in a
[1:08:46] night and perished in a night
[1:08:48] and now he's speaking to them
[1:08:51] and should I not
[1:08:54] I'm going to change this a little bit
[1:08:56] Saints just and you can follow me should
[1:08:59] I not come to the Gentiles
[1:09:01] should I not come to people who don't
[1:09:04] know the right and left hands apart
[1:09:06] should I not come to people that never
[1:09:08] heard the name of Jesus Christ should I
[1:09:10] not come to the weak and the weary
[1:09:12] should I not come to the beggarly and
[1:09:15] should I not come to the richest of the
[1:09:18] rich
[1:09:23] and he's speaking he said and should I
[1:09:25] not
[1:09:26] spare Nineveh the great City
[1:09:30] six score thousand purple cannot discern
[1:09:32] between their right hand their left
[1:09:36] come on even our little ones
[1:09:40] even our little ones are getting old
[1:09:42] enough now to no right and left
[1:09:45] so imagine the nature
[1:09:47] of the people in Nineveh
[1:09:51] none of them is going to sit down with
[1:09:54] their strongs
[1:09:55] and crudence
[1:09:58] and the Bible
[1:10:00] and figure this out
[1:10:02] not one of them had a clue
[1:10:05] but God said I saw you
[1:10:08] before paraphrasing I saw you before you
[1:10:13] were birthed
[1:10:14] I saw you when you were still bloody in
[1:10:17] swaddling clothes I saw you when you
[1:10:20] could do nothing for yourself
[1:10:23] and I loved you
[1:10:25] oh how great is our God
[1:10:28] How Great Is Our God my brother and
[1:10:30] sister I didn't preach this quite the
[1:10:32] way I've been preaching it to myself but
[1:10:35] I'm telling you when I look at this I
[1:10:37] realize the absolute grace of God Amen
[1:10:41] that has come to our life amen it's
[1:10:44] there well you know there's so many
[1:10:47] things
[1:10:48] uh you know I think part of Jonah might
[1:10:51] have had because I just take this from a
[1:10:53] human nature I think Jonah might have
[1:10:56] kind of got a little attitude saints
[1:10:57] that he was there with this little bit
[1:11:00] of an attitude trying to justify why he
[1:11:03] didn't obey God in the beginning so if
[1:11:05] it turns out all these people just in a
[1:11:07] few days get over and go right back to
[1:11:09] their life then it would justify my my
[1:11:11] attitude and my Disobedience but you see
[1:11:14] well look at this in such a fashion
[1:11:17] sometimes my brother and sister that we
[1:11:19] can justify our Disobedience to the word
[1:11:22] of God
[1:11:23] and we say well I didn't hear a voice
[1:11:25] like he did yes we have we read the word
[1:11:27] and the word is his voice amen it's not
[1:11:31] some put together deal it's God speaking
[1:11:34] amen and in this I say Lord help us that
[1:11:37] we will not try to justify uh our own uh
[1:11:41] our own disobedience
[1:11:43] amen
[1:11:50] and they that are sons of God are led by
[1:11:52] the spirit of God then when the human
[1:11:55] element goes out and the spirit of God
[1:11:57] fills that vacancy
[1:11:59] what is that dying to ourselves
[1:12:02] where you empty yourself amen there will
[1:12:05] be when the church and its power of the
[1:12:07] resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk
[1:12:09] in his steps in his power in his
[1:12:12] thoughts in his being in his moving now
[1:12:15] we talk about the moving of the Holy
[1:12:17] Spirit we talked about it on the phone a
[1:12:19] little bit today the moving of the Holy
[1:12:21] Spirit my brother and sister is an
[1:12:23] emotion but it's not
[1:12:25] it's much deeper it'll be the deepest
[1:12:27] emotion man will ever witness in his
[1:12:29] life it won't be just a stirring of a
[1:12:32] little something on the flesh or
[1:12:33] something that catches our sympathies
[1:12:36] and we react to this is when the soul is
[1:12:39] stirred Just Like An Earthquake it is
[1:12:41] shaken and it is brought to a place that
[1:12:44] we say Lord I need you I need you and I
[1:12:47] believe that's the kind of Revival that
[1:12:49] swept through Nineveh that many people
[1:12:51] were there I need God in my life didn't
[1:12:54] even know there was a god
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:58] in his being it is moving you see what I
[1:13:00] mean then your thoughts will become
[1:13:03] words and words will become material
[1:13:04] that's when the church is in its power
[1:13:07] amen not just us talking about it I was
[1:13:10] sharing this with a friend here the
[1:13:11] other day and and I was bearing my heart
[1:13:14] I'll bear it to you I'm slowly and
[1:13:16] steadily getting tired of talking about
[1:13:18] it
[1:13:21] now some people say whoa Brother Paul's
[1:13:23] talking no no
[1:13:26] I want to see it materialized
[1:13:28] I don't want to just talk about it why
[1:13:31] don't we just talk about God will come
[1:13:32] one day and move in people's lives and
[1:13:34] straighten them up and give them faith
[1:13:36] and strength and we'll be able to lay
[1:13:37] hands and we'll oh my brother and sister
[1:13:40] I think we need to move Beyond talking
[1:13:42] about this and see it being materialized
[1:13:45] in our midst
[1:13:47] oh we can speak in tongues my brother
[1:13:49] and sister there's a guy I remember he
[1:13:51] shared a story with me once he said
[1:13:52] there was a man in our church that spoke
[1:13:54] in tongues all the time and if you did
[1:13:56] business with him he'd rip you off every
[1:13:58] time
[1:13:59] did those two go together no my brother
[1:14:01] and sister one didn't prove the other
[1:14:03] but the one did prove he didn't have the
[1:14:04] other
[1:14:05] amen so there's what we want we want the
[1:14:08] life
[1:14:09] then your thoughts will become words and
[1:14:11] words will become material and that's
[1:14:13] when the church is in its power and I
[1:14:15] believe it's on its Road I do believe
[1:14:17] that amen when the church will be so
[1:14:19] wrapped up in Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:14:21] mankind so away from themselves that
[1:14:25] they don't see themselves they don't
[1:14:27] have no uh but to serve no I I think
[1:14:30] that word probably was desire in there
[1:14:31] but no desire but to serve God Amen and
[1:14:35] so he said and their thoughts move on
[1:14:37] they refuse the things of the world now
[1:14:40] you know it's kind of funny because we
[1:14:42] as a Holiness Church and belief in our
[1:14:44] Bible is our standard my brother and
[1:14:46] sister I like to look around I study I I
[1:14:49] kind of do this and we see even just
[1:14:52] almost secular churches doesn't seem
[1:14:56] like that sounds like they go together
[1:14:57] right Church secular but it's true
[1:15:00] there's many of that they talk about
[1:15:01] prosperities and talk about you know if
[1:15:04] God gives you a brand new Mercedes
[1:15:06] that's a sign of God's favor my brother
[1:15:07] and sister that might be your downfall
[1:15:10] and it got nothing to do with entering
[1:15:12] the kingdom of God that's nothing with
[1:15:13] you to come in God's present the car you
[1:15:16] drive or what kind of clothes or values
[1:15:18] that you have none of that matters I'd
[1:15:21] rather be the poorest man on the planet
[1:15:23] and have Jesus Christ than live in a
[1:15:25] mansion and have him absent from my life
[1:15:28] and so you look at that and so it's
[1:15:30] coming a time there's going to be a
[1:15:32] people that don't care about the things
[1:15:33] of this world
[1:15:34] now
[1:15:36] we do need to eat we need a place to
[1:15:38] live we're humans we need a habitation
[1:15:41] but we need God more than that
[1:15:44] they just move in the spirit they live
[1:15:45] in the spirit move in the spirit walk in
[1:15:47] the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ
[1:15:49] then the love of Christ in the human
[1:15:51] heart moving in the Holy Ghost that
[1:15:53] great wonderful church will go forth
[1:15:55] with power and deity because deity will
[1:15:58] be revealed in human beings by the Holy
[1:16:00] Spirit bringing to pass the thought of
[1:16:02] their mind now my brother and sister the
[1:16:05] scripture says that our mind would be
[1:16:07] the mind of Christ amen so it's not
[1:16:10] talking about whatever we was thinking
[1:16:12] about a great scheme our mind won't be
[1:16:15] on a great scheme to make money or a
[1:16:17] great scheme to do this or that our mind
[1:16:20] will be on Christ amen First Corinthians
[1:16:24] the second chapter you can take that
[1:16:26] home as homework first Corinthians 2 11
[1:16:28] 16 amen we don't want to have the spirit
[1:16:31] of the I might as well it's just a few
[1:16:33] verses
[1:16:34] for one man knoweth the things of a man
[1:16:36] save the spirit of man which is in him
[1:16:39] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:16:42] but the spirit of God now we have
[1:16:44] received not the spirit of the world can
[1:16:47] someone say amen amen but the spirit
[1:16:49] which is of god that we might know the
[1:16:52] things that are freely given to us of
[1:16:54] God that's why real Christians are just
[1:16:57] an oddity to this world today my brother
[1:16:59] and sister it's not about how big the
[1:17:01] building is and how fine the choir is
[1:17:04] and all of these other factors that the
[1:17:06] world is doing I think I shared with you
[1:17:08] guys the postcard that I got sent here
[1:17:11] the other day did I share that how that
[1:17:13] they're they're doing they having this
[1:17:15] seminar how to fill your church up at
[1:17:18] Easter
[1:17:20] my brother and sister I don't want
[1:17:22] numbers I want real Christians I want
[1:17:24] God to do the filling I want God to do
[1:17:27] the calling amen and let God come in
[1:17:29] here and let our light as Sons and
[1:17:31] Daughters of God shine that they would
[1:17:33] see there is a difference
[1:17:35] amen we're not here you know this whole
[1:17:38] brochure was about get more people in
[1:17:40] your church your offerings will be
[1:17:42] bigger your tithe will be bigger but
[1:17:44] I'll tell you what they'll be the less
[1:17:46] of the spirit of God when it's just man
[1:17:48] manipulating everything to fill up a
[1:17:51] building
[1:17:52] I'll tell you what God didn't go into
[1:17:55] the Philip the building business he said
[1:17:57] were two or three are gathered in my
[1:17:58] name I'll be there also and I'll tell
[1:18:01] you what even though about half of us
[1:18:03] are gone tonight my brother and sister
[1:18:05] God didn't say well there wasn't enough
[1:18:07] there for me to visit tonight God said
[1:18:09] there's two or three amen and when you
[1:18:11] figure that out it is not a a a
[1:18:14] humanistic thinking it is a word of God
[1:18:17] coming forth and manifesting itself
[1:18:25] we have received not the spirit of the
[1:18:27] world but the spirit which is of god
[1:18:28] that we might know the things that are
[1:18:30] freely given to us can we say that
[1:18:33] together freely given to us of God
[1:18:38] which things also we speak not in The
[1:18:40] Words which man's Wisdom teaches
[1:18:43] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[1:18:45] comparing spiritual things with
[1:18:46] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:18:49] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:18:52] the foolishness to them
[1:18:54] you know what happens when you get a
[1:18:55] church clear full of people by an agenda
[1:19:00] about half of them
[1:19:02] want about 15 or 20 minutes
[1:19:06] and they want to be told that they're
[1:19:07] going to heaven
[1:19:09] and they want to be dismissed
[1:19:15] no asking
[1:19:17] and I'm going to use the word demanding
[1:19:19] but I don't mean that in a nicolaitan
[1:19:20] form
[1:19:22] just give us what we want
[1:19:27] and we'll be happy
[1:19:34] I think I'll leave that one alone
[1:19:41] it's because the natural man can't
[1:19:42] receive the things of the spirit of God
[1:19:45] their foolishness to him
[1:19:48] neither can he know them
[1:19:51] right didn't the scripture say we know
[1:19:54] it did I'm just putting it that way may
[1:19:56] he blind the eyes
[1:19:57] just as Israel was blinded God would
[1:20:01] blind the eyes
[1:20:02] of the carnal-minded man identifying as
[1:20:06] a Christian
[1:20:08] they think
[1:20:10] that if they just go to church
[1:20:12] life don't have to change
[1:20:15] you know I've named it and I shouldn't
[1:20:17] never have done that but I cannot block
[1:20:19] out the image of the summer time
[1:20:22] people pulling up to church
[1:20:26] their big boat behind their pickup and
[1:20:29] they get out this is a true story I'm
[1:20:31] not making this up they get out the
[1:20:34] man's in one of those tank tops it's
[1:20:37] really low and cut out and baggy shorts
[1:20:40] with flip-flops
[1:20:43] and the rest is family is all dressed in
[1:20:45] that similar fashion
[1:20:49] going to church
[1:20:51] so no respect for the house of God
[1:20:55] imagine if this let's just humor me for
[1:20:58] a moment do we have a moment you can
[1:21:00] humor me imagine now we just pulled them
[1:21:02] out of time
[1:21:04] and we took them back
[1:21:06] and took him to the temple
[1:21:12] and they come to walk behind the veil
[1:21:20] done over finished
[1:21:23] but somehow we have this idea that it's
[1:21:24] all changed
[1:21:26] God God's modern now
[1:21:30] God's modern
[1:21:32] you don't mind
[1:21:37] I've joked it's it's been here it's
[1:21:40] happened in this building
[1:21:42] I'm not going to enforce it but I will
[1:21:44] mention it here hopefully you find some
[1:21:46] humor in it
[1:21:47] I think even the flip-flops
[1:21:50] shouldn't make it in the door at church
[1:21:55] and I'm not you wear a pair of
[1:21:57] flip-flops I'm not going to preach on
[1:21:58] you
[1:21:59] I might you know get one of those big
[1:22:01] hands on the sign that's got the finger
[1:22:03] and I might be holding it up you know
[1:22:05] but I won't say a word
[1:22:08] but where's our respect for the house of
[1:22:10] God
[1:22:11] it's withered away like the gourd did
[1:22:16] and then we wonder
[1:22:18] why Christians are just as angry
[1:22:21] as the world
[1:22:24] why Christians are just as messed up as
[1:22:28] the world
[1:22:30] because we have not found
[1:22:32] the right Avenue to approach God
[1:22:36] we took one of convenience we took one
[1:22:39] that made us feel good
[1:22:41] um
[1:22:43] I hear the ice cracking
[1:22:46] I want to be my brother and sister
[1:22:48] as verse 15 is that he the spiritual
[1:22:51] judges all things yet he himself is
[1:22:52] judging no man I want to be that guy why
[1:22:55] not that no one can judge me but that
[1:22:57] I've already judged my life before
[1:22:59] Christ amen I don't need to stand a
[1:23:02] judgment because I've already come
[1:23:03] before God and had my life examined by
[1:23:07] the word of God and let the Holy Spirit
[1:23:09] deal with me to lift a hand and say Lord
[1:23:12] the discern me Lord cleanse me Lord give
[1:23:16] me a clean heart as David did and to be
[1:23:19] able to look at that and say this is
[1:23:21] what I want
[1:23:23] amen I'll skip over a couple things here
[1:23:26] but one thing I want to touch on amen
[1:23:29] sister vika if you'll come
[1:23:32] verse 10 is pretty straightforward then
[1:23:35] said the Lord
[1:23:36] has had pity on the gourd
[1:23:40] you notice he had no pity
[1:23:42] on Nineveh
[1:23:45] he had no pity on them people
[1:23:49] but he had pity
[1:23:50] on a gourd
[1:23:53] I I
[1:23:54] I can't comprehend that yeah
[1:23:57] I can't comprehend that but I'll tell
[1:24:00] you I've witnessed it
[1:24:04] I've witnessed it
[1:24:07] I have literally witnessed young
[1:24:09] children coming to an altar
[1:24:13] and a deacon coming along after a while
[1:24:17] and kind of giving them the boot and
[1:24:19] telling them you've been here long
[1:24:20] enough go back to your seat
[1:24:26] did they know what the conversation was
[1:24:31] oh let me drive it home a little more
[1:24:33] personal
[1:24:34] y'all not looking spiritual enough
[1:24:36] tonight
[1:24:39] would that be fair
[1:24:42] no
[1:24:44] but we'd pick up a stray dog take it
[1:24:46] home and feed it
[1:24:50] and we have not one bit of pity or
[1:24:52] compassion
[1:24:53] on the body of Christ
[1:24:55] Lord help us
[1:24:57] let us not be the net Jonah of that
[1:25:00] condition
[1:25:01] let us have compassion let us have
[1:25:04] encouragement let us lift up those
[1:25:06] around us someone has a need my brother
[1:25:09] and sister don't look on down on them oh
[1:25:11] I wonder what's wrong you know I I come
[1:25:14] across the deal here recently and
[1:25:15] actually smote me right to the very
[1:25:17] depths of my heart
[1:25:19] part of a conversation
[1:25:21] and in that conversation something was
[1:25:23] mentioned about a struggle that a
[1:25:25] certain family was having
[1:25:28] and a man raised his voice
[1:25:30] and said I wonder what their secret sin
[1:25:33] is
[1:25:38] the tires falling off at your car
[1:25:39] meaning or Center
[1:25:42] that struggle with raising children
[1:25:45] mean that God's not present in our home
[1:25:49] the list could go on Saints
[1:25:54] let us
[1:25:55] have compassion let us have pity
[1:25:58] let us not get a hard Spirit let's not
[1:26:00] rather that Nineveh would have been
[1:26:04] struck with fire
[1:26:08] let's have a tender heart
[1:26:12] you see God's brought us Saints to our
[1:26:14] own Nineveh
[1:26:15] he came to our city come to our town he
[1:26:18] come to our family come to our doorstep
[1:26:20] and said judgment's coming
[1:26:22] and we responded
[1:26:24] and it stopped didn't it
[1:26:27] the days the weeks the months the years
[1:26:29] have passed and we're still serving God
[1:26:32] and I have to believe with my heart
[1:26:34] there were those in Nineveh that was the
[1:26:37] years went on were still there
[1:26:39] worshiping
[1:26:40] worshiping Jehovah saying thank you Lord
[1:26:43] for sending the word of the hour
[1:26:45] thank you Lord for sending a message to
[1:26:47] me called me out of the darkness of
[1:26:50] Nineveh into a glorious light to serve
[1:26:53] you
[1:26:54] and recognizing as the word goes my
[1:26:57] brother and sister that it was not just
[1:26:59] promised to them but it was promised to
[1:27:01] their children and their children and
[1:27:04] children and those that are far off what
[1:27:07] a glorious what a glorious blessing that
[1:27:10] we have been given

[1:30:10] I want to see you
[1:30:15] Hallelujah number 250 brother Gideon
[1:30:20] amen
[1:30:23] I just say Amen when I just look at the
[1:30:26] words of this song
[1:30:28] amen he's been my provider he's been my
[1:30:31] healer
[1:30:33] I've shared many things with your church
[1:30:37] there's a lot of them I never Sheridan
[1:30:40] they're just equally impressed upon my
[1:30:43] soul
[1:30:45] of the things that my God has done for
[1:30:47] me
[1:30:50] times of need
[1:30:51] he's always been present
[1:30:54] he has come
[1:30:56] the Midnight Hour
[1:30:58] and he's spoken to me
[1:31:00] and I've watched it come to pass in the
[1:31:02] next day
[1:31:03] do I make anything great out of that no
[1:31:05] it was just God dealing with me on a
[1:31:08] certain issue of my life
[1:31:10] and he made it so personal
[1:31:15] made it personal enough it didn't even
[1:31:17] have to come from someone else God
[1:31:19] himself
[1:31:20] come down laid it right upon our heart I
[1:31:24] say that's personal
[1:31:26] amen I say it's good when someone
[1:31:28] anointed of God comes and tells you the
[1:31:30] Lord has revealed this to me and it's
[1:31:33] the truth but how much more personal
[1:31:35] when God himself comes down
[1:31:39] and says there's a little something in
[1:31:40] your life I want taken out or I want you
[1:31:43] to see something you've never saw before
[1:31:46] look up your redemptions drawing nigh
[1:31:50] and my brother and sister this is the
[1:31:52] God we serve it's so personalized to us
[1:31:55] we have hearts desires and sometimes
[1:31:57] they're not always deep spiritual things
[1:32:00] can you say Amen to that sometimes
[1:32:02] they're just things that are very close
[1:32:03] to your life and you would come and say
[1:32:05] Lord this is important to me I'll share
[1:32:07] this one it might sound silly and
[1:32:10] forgive me if I sound silly but when we
[1:32:13] were in Africa we were driving through
[1:32:15] the deal there and I thought Lord it
[1:32:18] would be so awesome I've saw the
[1:32:19] pictures for years I think it would be
[1:32:22] so awesome to see a leopard draped over
[1:32:25] the tree like they do just totally
[1:32:28] relaxed the tail hanging down their head
[1:32:30] lulled to the side Lord I'd love to see
[1:32:32] that I never mentioned it to my wife I
[1:32:34] never mentioned brother Gideon and we're
[1:32:36] driving along and lo and behold here is
[1:32:39] a leopard sister Jerry's like leopard
[1:32:42] and we look up in the tree and we drive
[1:32:44] up close and here's this great big
[1:32:46] leopard and he's just laying there his
[1:32:48] head his tongue was sticking out I like
[1:32:50] that you know somebody's relaxed when
[1:32:52] their tongue is sticking out and his
[1:32:54] head's load to the side and he's just
[1:32:56] draped over this tree and we sat there
[1:32:58] and looked at that
[1:33:00] and I thought thank you Lord you care
[1:33:02] even
[1:33:03] of the littlest things
[1:33:07] that might sound silly that one would
[1:33:09] ask God
[1:33:11] about to see a leopard
[1:33:13] in that form
[1:33:16] but I tell you I knew God was there with
[1:33:18] us
[1:33:19] I knew it's just everything that had
[1:33:22] taken place in the conversations and
[1:33:24] everything that was there
[1:33:26] and not to be emotional but it means
[1:33:28] that much more to me now of the passing
[1:33:31] of our brother Gideon
[1:33:33] that God knew
[1:33:34] and I'm telling you my brother and
[1:33:36] sister he is our provider
[1:33:46] oh my profile
[1:33:53] you are more just thank him Saints and
[1:33:58] enough
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:00] oh for me
[1:34:06] Jehovah
[1:34:11] oh you're my
[1:34:15] healer
[1:34:18] and by your
[1:34:21] stripes I am
[1:34:25] set free I say thank you Lord
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:38] with me
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:42] you supply
[1:34:47] oh my name
[1:34:53] oh you are more than enough
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:14] foreign
[1:35:16] heavenly father I
[1:35:18] pray tonight that
[1:35:21] or there'd be continuity found in the
[1:35:23] thought
[1:35:27] would speak to a Heart Lord to encourage
[1:35:30] us
