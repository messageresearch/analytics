[3:07] something here real quick before we sing
[3:09] our first song. But u this is from uh
[3:14] and I actually when I when I copied it,
[3:16] I cut off the name of the message. I
[3:18] think it was the infallible
[3:20] proof of Christ or I can't remember
[3:23] exactly but he says now he might act
[3:26] like he might now he might act might
[3:29] have act like that to you when he act
[3:32] like he wasn't going to heal you. He
[3:34] might have act like he was going on. He
[3:37] wanted to see your emotions. He wanted
[3:38] to know just how much you believed him.
[3:41] But notice Cleopus and his friend. They
[3:43] persuaded him to come in. I wonder if
[3:46] that's your attitude towards Christ
[3:47] tonight. Amen. Is that your attitude
[3:50] this morning?
[3:51] Amen. Let's persuade him to come. Let's
[3:53] persuade him to be with us this morning.

[12:02] [Music]
[12:07] Oh, glorious victory.
[12:11] That day he set me free.
[12:16] And he made my heart,
[12:20] his very throne.
[12:24] My life is no longer mine.
[12:29] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[12:34] And now I live
[12:36] [Music]
[12:38] to praise his name.
[12:43] Who I am, Lord.
[12:47] Who I am.
[12:51] I can see now
[12:56] who I am.
[13:00] a part of my savior,
[13:04] part of his word.
[13:08] It's a revelation
[13:12] of who I am.
[13:17] On Calvary,
[13:19] he died
[13:21] to redeem his lost bride.
[13:26] The king of kings
[13:30] became my savior.
[13:35] This is God's great mystery
[13:39] of love expressed to me
[13:44] that Christ and I
[13:48] might be made one.
[13:53] Who I am, Lord,
[13:57] who I am.
[14:01] I can see now
[14:06] who I am.
[14:10] A part of my savior,
[14:14] part of his word.
[14:18] It's a revelation.
[14:23] of who I am.
[14:27] Amen. Amen. It says, "I can see now who
[14:30] I am." Can you see that this morning?
[14:33] Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm glad he's
[14:35] opened my eyes.
[14:37] Glory to God. Amen. Brother Paul, do you
[14:39] want to come?
[14:41] Amen.
[15:03] Good to be in the house of the Lord this
[15:05] morning.
[15:07] Amen. Well, it's just with great joy
[15:10] that uh we are able to um dedicate
[15:16] uh our grandson and uh so good to have
[15:20] brother David, sister Deborah here also
[15:23] and uh uh to I think as brother David
[15:27] put this the other day, our mutual
[15:31] grandchild and uh you know it just uh
[15:35] it's good because whatever he grows up
[15:38] to be, we realize it's not all our
[15:40] fault. And so, uh, there'll be a little
[15:43] bit of that Nash in him. And, uh, they
[15:47] actually put that name on him. So,
[15:49] anyway, but, uh, you know, we're going
[15:52] to commit Little Tig to the Lord today.
[15:55] And we believe by the promise of the
[15:58] word, amen, that he'll grow up for uh as
[16:02] long as this earth endures and his time
[16:04] is here, he'll grow up to be a son of
[16:06] God, serve the Lord with all of his
[16:08] heart. Amen. And it's wonderful to be
[16:11] able to live in a time that we see the
[16:14] the scripture, we see the word opened up
[16:16] entirely uh just revealing who Christ is
[16:20] uh by revealing his bride. Amen. You
[16:23] know, a man is known by a wife that he
[16:25] would choose. And our Lord Jesus Christ
[16:27] is reflecting himself in the body of
[16:30] believers, those who come and and uh
[16:33] serve him and live for him. And so uh
[16:37] obviously we want to invite Sister
[16:39] Christen. I don't know if you're
[16:40] bringing the whole group. Why not?
[16:44] Why not?
[16:46] Yeah.
[16:48] No, the whole group includes the Nashes.
[16:53] Amen.
[16:55] Sister Deborah, I know I saw that quiet
[16:58] like, "Nope, we don't have to go." But
[17:00] uh but it would not be the same without
[17:03] that. and uh brother David if you will.
[17:06] Where's Sister Jerry?
[17:09] Sister Jerry's. She's she's And um you
[17:14] know, at a stage in your life, uh I
[17:18] remember as a young man, you know,
[17:20] hearing the the word preached and
[17:23] realizing that scripture pointing to the
[17:25] end of time. And I I often wondered,
[17:29] Lord, would I even get married? and uh
[17:31] we got married and then it's like well
[17:33] we have time for children and and then
[17:36] you realize that we have no idea what
[17:39] God's doing because we stand here today
[17:42] uh with not only God blessing with a
[17:45] family but all the way down here to the
[17:48] youngest here uh little tig
[17:51] uh the plan of God will be fulfilled
[17:54] when he says it's fulfilled.
[17:57] Amen. I was just reading this morning,
[17:59] brother Brandham saying he said it's
[18:02] when God says it's finished.
[18:05] Amen.
[18:06] Amen. So, we don't want to sit here and
[18:08] say, "Oh, I think this has got to be
[18:09] this and this got to be that." So, we're
[18:11] going to fulfill the word of God
[18:14] all the way to the point that God says
[18:17] it is finished. Amen. And so we're here
[18:20] today to uh uh just dedicate uh little
[18:26] Ty uh Keon Nash. Amen. Uh Ty, definitely
[18:32] um I'm blaming this on some Nash blood.
[18:36] Amen.
[18:37] Cuz if you was to look at Ty here, you
[18:40] would come up with something else. And
[18:44] um but these are Scottish
[18:47] Gaelic.
[18:47] Gaelic. Amen. So uh I equate that to
[18:52] Viking blood. So um Ty is a poet, a
[18:58] philosopher, a storyteller. You imagine
[19:01] what this little boy's going to grow up
[19:03] to be.
[19:05] Keon is the grace of God.
[19:08] So how how wonderful is that? He's going
[19:11] to by God's grace tell of God's grace
[19:16] all the days of his life.
[19:18] And uh I would like to just actually
[19:24] give to my brother David opportunity. I
[19:27] I get to hold little Tig probably a lot
[19:29] more than he does. So, I'm going to just
[19:32] let brother David dedicate his youngest
[19:36] grandson
[19:38] and commit him to the Lord that the
[19:40] grace of God would be with Ty all the
[19:43] days of his life.
[19:45] Amen.
[19:46] Tell him,
[19:49] Gracious heavenly father,
[19:52] we come as you said to let the children
[19:55] come. And again you said except we
[19:58] become as little children can't even see
[20:01] or enter the kingdom of God. So as we
[20:04] pray for little tig I think of tiger
[20:07] Lord may he be a tiger
[20:09] Lord for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[20:12] As we pray for him we pray for the
[20:14] family. Pray for everyone here this
[20:17] morning. And you said that God is love.
[20:20] Let the love of God touch. Let it be
[20:23] with the family. Let it be with the
[20:25] church. Let us be with all those without
[20:27] father that they might see the grace of
[20:30] God
[20:32] and Jesus Christ touch and live in this
[20:34] child as we give him from our hearts our
[20:38] lives to you in Jesus Christ's name from
[20:42] Isaac and Kristen Lord Jesus may see
[20:45] this as truly a blessing in their lives
[20:48] for your honor and glory we ask it in
[20:50] Jesus name. Amen.
[20:52] Amen. Amen.
[20:55] Thank you.
[21:01] [Music]
[21:02] Amen.
[21:07] [Music]
[21:09] Everybody always says how he's such a
[21:11] quiet little or happy little fella. Tell
[21:13] my wife, "Well, it's good to end on a
[21:15] good note." So,
[21:18] we're done.
[21:20] [Laughter]
[21:22] Praise God. Unless well we won't go
[21:25] let's not it's not even it's not even
[21:26] won't go down that road. Amen.

[21:35] you want. I I just feel like standing
[21:36] today and praising God. Amen.
[21:42] Lord, my heart can grow.
[21:48] So far away and cold.
[21:53] And yet for me, your love is still the
[21:59] same.
[22:03] Oh Lord, I bend my knee
[22:08] in awe and fear of thee.

[31:58] If you've been hearing the same old
[32:00] voice, tell the same old lies.
[32:04] If you've been trying to fill those same
[32:07] old holes inside,
[32:10] there's a better life.
[32:13] There's a better life.
[32:17] If you got pain,
[32:20] he's a painaker.
[32:23] If you feel lost,
[32:26] he's a way maker.
[32:29] If you need freom or save on, he's a
[32:33] prison shaking savior. If you got
[32:36] chains,
[32:38] he's a chain breaker.
[32:42] We've all searched for the light of day
[32:45] in the dead of night.
[32:48] We've all found ourselves worn out from
[32:51] the same old fight.
[32:54] We've all run from things we know just
[32:58] ain't right.
[33:00] There's a better life.
[33:03] There's a better life.
[33:06] You got pain.
[33:09] He's a pain taker.
[33:12] If you feel lost,
[33:14] he's a way maker.
[33:18] If you need freom or save on, he's a
[33:22] prison shaking savior. If you got
[33:24] chains,
[33:26] he's a chain breaker.
[33:28] [Music]
[34:10] Heat. Heat.
[34:15] [Music]
[34:33] [Applause]
[34:41] for a song.
[35:19] Praise the Lord.
[35:22] Good to be in your midst. First time
[35:24] being here and uh certainly nice looking
[35:28] congregation.
[35:31] I'm certainly glad to be part of the
[35:34] service this morning.
[35:36] Bring you uh
[35:39] great love
[35:42] song that I wrote years ago.
[35:49] Sometimes I question,
[35:52] [Music]
[35:54] oh Lord, how long
[36:00] will I be waiting
[36:05] to join that throne?
[36:13] His word tells me
[36:17] we're at the end of the end time
[36:24] when the last one is in the fold.
[36:30] It's time to go home.
[36:38] Then I think of the loved ones
[36:42] who keep falling away from grace,
[36:49] just striving to keep up the pace
[36:54] with this sinful world.
[37:03] But Lord, I'm committed
[37:07] to follow through.
[37:13] Whoever may come or go,
[37:19] I'm going with you.
[37:25] He is my Lord and King.
[37:31] Oh, blessed be
[37:34] his name.
[37:37] He has forgiven me
[37:43] of every sin.
[37:48] I'll let his praisees
[37:51] ring.
[37:54] Of Jesus love I'll sing.
[38:00] He is my everything,
[38:05] my eternal flame.
[38:10] And I'll stand and shout his name
[38:17] forever.
[38:19] He's the same.
[38:23] He makes my daily
[38:26] life.
[38:28] Oh, so serene.
[38:34] Just let me praise him more.
[38:39] I have so much to thank him for.
[38:45] He is my only
[38:48] God.
[38:50] Oh, praise his name.
[38:55] Just let me praise him more.
[39:01] I have so much to thank him for.
[39:06] He is my only
[39:09] God.
[39:11] Oh,
[39:13] praise
[39:15] his name.
[39:21] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[39:27] Sometimes a trouble sea.
[39:31] [Music]
[39:33] Sometimes it takes a desert
[39:39] to get a hold of me.
[39:44] Your love is so much stronger
[39:49] than whatever troubles me.
[39:54] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[40:00] to trust you and believe. Do you know
[40:02] the song? Sing it with me. Sometimes it
[40:06] takes a mountain.
[40:10] Sometimes a trouble sea.
[40:15] Sometimes it takes a desert
[40:21] to get a hold of me.
[40:26] Your love is so much stronger
[40:31] than whatever trles me.
[40:36] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[40:41] to trust you and believe.
[40:55] [Applause]
[40:56] Hallelujah.

[41:42] Lord.

[42:38] has followed me.
[42:44] So glad you found me
[42:49] and set me free.
[42:55] So glad I'm yours,

[43:10] As we get ready to change the order of
[43:11] the service. Um number 491. Let's just
[43:14] sing manifesting time. Amen. Brother
[43:17] Paul, were you going to come first or
[43:20] Okay. Amen.
[43:23] The voice of my beloved.
[43:27] Behold, he quickly comes,
[43:30] sweeping over the mountains, over the
[43:33] hills he runs.
[43:37] I long to hear his voice. I long to hear
[43:42] him say,
[43:44] "Arise, my love, my fair one, come
[43:48] away."
[43:51] It's manifesting
[43:53] time. The fruits are on the vine and the
[43:57] lovely one is coming in plain view.

[46:06] time. The fruits are on the vine and the
[46:10] lovely one is coming in plain view.
[46:16] Oh to cap God's chosen bride.
[46:20] Redemption draw with nigh. He's that

[46:30] Hey,
[46:31] but good to be here today. Amen. The
[46:34] Lord just being so kind to us. Lovely
[46:36] music and these special songs. Amen. You
[46:40] know, I just uh I really appreciate what
[46:43] the Lord does for us. Just all kinds of
[46:46] little gifts that he's constantly
[46:47] pouring out to us and and we say thank
[46:50] you. I'd just like to uh greet uh Alex,
[46:54] a friend of brother Vosile's here this
[46:57] morning with us. God bless you. I hope
[46:59] you enjoy yourself today. And uh we're
[47:02] we're making the claim on them that
[47:03] they're family, but it's good to see the
[47:05] Floyd's here with us today. Amen. God
[47:08] bless you guys. And uh so as we would
[47:11] just uh go forward this morning uh we
[47:14] want to mention right now that there is
[47:16] a fellowship and all are welcome after
[47:19] the service in the basement. And uh so
[47:22] let's not forget that. But uh brother
[47:25] Jonah is um my a prince of a man.
[47:30] Amen. and uh Sister Edna, you know, uh
[47:34] it's been a long time since we've been
[47:36] at their place, but um they are uh the
[47:39] picture of hospitality and um you know,
[47:43] it's just so happy to have them here
[47:45] with us and and um uh Brother Al, Sister
[47:51] Art, not Al, Art. Yeah, Sister Jerry's
[47:54] behind.
[47:57] Oh my. Well, you know, uh, and Sister
[48:01] Karen, God bless you. And did you enjoy
[48:03] those special songs? Amen. Hallelujah. I
[48:07] I do believe Sister Karen, according to
[48:09] our agreement at the restaurant last
[48:10] night, was supposed to sing today. And u
[48:14] so uh just saying, just saying. Uh
[48:20] yeah. Well, she has sang. Yes, that's
[48:22] correct. But we just want to um just
[48:25] give our brother Jonah full attention
[48:28] and time and just absorb what it is he's
[48:32] got to share with us. Uh and uh he he
[48:35] just has full liberty uh to just preach
[48:38] whatever God's laid upon his heart. So,
[48:40] Brother Jonah, we just want to invite
[48:42] you to come and uh let's just take a
[48:45] spiritual meal before we would take a
[48:47] natural one and just uh just be filled
[48:50] up. Amen. You know, there's no reason
[48:53] for us to leave with our cup half full,
[48:55] 3/4 full. We can leave today with it
[48:58] overflowing. Amen. And so, let's just uh
[49:01] take in all of the word of God that he
[49:04] has for us today, receive it, say amen
[49:07] to it, and let it change our lives.
[49:10] Amen. Brother Jonah.
[49:12] Amen.
[49:17] Thank you, brother. Appreciate you.
[49:20] Yes. Thank you. Yes, I think so.
[49:25] Well, it's good to be here.
[49:28] Uh,
[49:31] greetings and uh it's glad to partake of
[49:34] a little Idaho hospitality.
[49:37] You know, uh
[49:40] I always say that wherever you go,
[49:43] uh the children of God should be the
[49:45] most hospitable people on earth. And I
[49:49] uh and I will say to you know that my
[49:52] wife is the
[49:56] and she won't like me for saying this
[49:59] but
[50:01] if it's hospitality that you want to
[50:03] take a picture of take a picture of her
[50:06] because um she knows what it's like to
[50:10] be hospitable. She knows how to welcome
[50:14] people into her home and uh I'm so happy
[50:18] to have her
[50:20] and uh so so pleased to uh
[50:25] to know the Lord.
[50:27] Amen. and his people. Yes, sir.
[50:30] You know, I uh
[50:34] I opened up the scripture this morning
[50:36] as I was waiting on the Lord and just uh
[50:40] you know, we can be so full of letter
[50:43] of the letter of the word.
[50:45] Yeah, that's right.
[50:46] That we could kill you.
[50:48] That's right.
[50:48] You know, we can kill you with a letter.
[50:50] That's right.
[50:51] But I don't I said, Lord, I don't want
[50:54] to come with a letter to them. I want to
[50:55] come with the spirit.
[50:59] Amen.
[50:59] I opened up the scripture this morning
[51:01] in Isaiah 40. And you don't have to open
[51:04] up there, but I just said, "Comfort Jay,
[51:06] comfort Jay, my people, saith the Lord."
[51:10] So, you know, how do you get comfort? If
[51:14] you're the people of the Lord, you get
[51:16] comfort from his word.
[51:17] Amen.
[51:18] That is what comforts us.
[51:20] That is the only thing that a child of
[51:23] God brings. It brings peace to them. It
[51:26] brings consolation to them. It brings
[51:30] deliverance to them, salvation to them.
[51:32] It's the word that gives us
[51:35] that comfort. And I'm so happy this
[51:37] morning that I can come uh to you with
[51:40] the word of God.
[51:42] I don't bring anything else but the word
[51:44] because I believe that this end time
[51:47] messenger that we believe in restored us
[51:50] back to the word. And I just want to say
[51:53] one thing as I was thinking on my bed
[51:55] last night. He restored us to the word
[51:58] of God.
[52:00] He didn't preach on every word
[52:04] that's written in the Bible.
[52:05] That's right.
[52:06] Because sometimes I'm I'm contemplating
[52:09] a verse and I'm going, "What does that
[52:10] mean? What does that mean?" And I push
[52:12] it into my little program and there's
[52:15] nothing on it. But you know, he brought
[52:18] us back to Christ.
[52:22] And if you ask him any question,
[52:26] he'll answer you.
[52:28] That's one guarantee. He said, "Seek me
[52:30] and you shall find me.
[52:33] Knock
[52:34] and it shall be opened up unto you. Ask
[52:38] in my name and you shall receive."
[52:42] So that's our promise this morning. It's
[52:43] a three-fold purpose. I write that in
[52:45] every new Bible that I get. If I wore
[52:48] one out, I write that in the leaf
[52:50] because that is our three-fold privilege
[52:53] as children of God. We have that
[52:57] ability. I'm so happy to see brother
[52:59] David and his wife here, Sister Deborah.
[53:03] It's just good to to see you again and
[53:05] be in your presence. And of course,
[53:07] Brother Isaac and and and Sister Kristen
[53:10] and Brother Dave Dinhardt. I met you and
[53:12] your wife at the Living Word, I believe,
[53:17] um, dedication and it's nice to see you
[53:20] again, brother. And
[53:22] I don't know if I know anybody else
[53:23] here, but I was sure impressed with our
[53:25] brother Titus.
[53:27] You know, I play violin, but I don't
[53:28] play it like brother Titus. And I
[53:30] haven't picked it up in 40 years, so I
[53:33] don't think I I even play anything like
[53:35] him. But boy, was I blessed uh by his
[53:38] singing and the song he played. I really
[53:41] enjoyed that big time. So, has he set
[53:46] you free? You know, you know, has he set
[53:48] you free this morning? And and and I,
[53:51] you know, how can you tell if somebody's
[53:54] been set free?
[53:56] Amen.
[53:57] Hallelujah.
[53:59] You know, Jesus said, "They shall know
[54:01] us by the love we have for one another."
[54:06] Not by the amount of quotes you got.
[54:08] That's right. Amen.
[54:10] Not by how religious you act or how how
[54:13] how
[54:15] judgmental you are.
[54:17] Because some people think if they're
[54:18] judgmental that means that they're
[54:21] better than you because they're going to
[54:23] point out the flaws in you before you
[54:25] point them out in the in yourself or
[54:27] whatever. But but you know, it's the
[54:30] love that we have for one another that
[54:32] that really
[54:34] that's the capstone.
[54:36] That's the capstone. So this morning I I
[54:39] want to preach a little bit on on united
[54:41] with the word.
[54:42] Amen.
[54:43] You know, we've we are we we were
[54:46] singing that song, a part of my savior,
[54:48] a part of his word.
[54:52] It's a revelation.
[54:53] Amen.
[54:54] Of who I am. So when we receive that
[54:57] revelation that we are the word, I
[55:00] believe we're going to be raptured.
[55:01] Right?
[55:02] I believe we're going to be raptured.
[55:03] And I was talking I I think with sister
[55:06] Karen and brother Arch and and this
[55:09] morning and you know it's not when we're
[55:12] perfect like we think of perfect.
[55:14] That's right.
[55:17] No, it's when he sees us.
[55:19] Yes.
[55:20] That the word is so dear to us and so
[55:24] precious to us and that our only desire
[55:27] is to be like him.
[55:28] Amen. Our only desire is to be in him,
[55:31] like him, near him, and always with him.
[55:34] He'll come and take us home. And the
[55:36] last one's in, he just goes, "Okay, I'm
[55:38] taking you home. I'm bringing you home."
[55:40] You know, I just love that little
[55:42] illustration, Brother Brandon Brinks,
[55:44] and I didn't write this down. It just
[55:45] came to my heart about Greenfield,
[55:50] the evangelist, coming to the gates. And
[55:54] well, he wouldn't let me in. You can you
[55:57] can appeal to the final throne. And he
[55:59] goes there and he says, "Well, did you
[56:00] ever steal? Did you ever lie?" Oh, he
[56:03] says, "You know, all of a sudden his,
[56:05] you know, we know what we what we are.
[56:08] You know what you are this morning? You
[56:10] know exactly what where you were, what
[56:12] you were thinking, what you were doing."
[56:15] And he says all of a sudden he just he
[56:18] he felt, "Oh my, how am I going to get
[56:20] in?" And then he said the sweetest
[56:22] voice,
[56:24] the sweetest voice said, "He stood for
[56:27] me." Amen.
[56:31] I'll stand for him.
[56:34] He's standing for you this morning.
[56:38] So if you come with to him in the right
[56:40] way this morning, you can be totally
[56:43] delivered.
[56:45] I can't help you. And I love to say that
[56:48] I'm just a piece of dust.
[56:50] That's right.
[56:50] That's all I am.
[56:53] But with Christ in me,
[56:54] Amen. That's right. and with his word in
[56:57] me and you receive the word that he put
[56:59] in me and you touch him by touching his
[57:02] word. I'll tell you what this morning
[57:03] you can be in heavenly places
[57:05] immediately. You can be from sinner to
[57:07] saint.
[57:09] Amen.
[57:10] From death to life, from sick to healed
[57:15] as instantly as that by receiving him.
[57:19] Amen. So let's turn to the word of God
[57:21] this morning.
[57:23] And I want to turn there's two
[57:25] scriptures and you know you can you can
[57:28] do a sermon two ways.
[57:31] And this sermon as I was praying and
[57:34] asking the Lord what could I bring for
[57:36] the Idaho uh saints here. I didn't want
[57:39] to bring uh you know a sermon that I've
[57:42] already brought somewhere. I thought you
[57:43] know what I I'm just going to bring
[57:45] something fresh. I said, "Lord, uh, you
[57:48] know, it's nothing wrong with bringing
[57:50] an older sermon because it's never two
[57:52] sermons the same. I could ask brother
[57:54] Paul and ask brother David and brother
[57:56] Dart, you know, you never you can preach
[57:58] on the same thing and it it can turn out
[58:00] so different
[58:02] because it's the spirit that should be
[58:03] leading us and guiding us." But I said,
[58:05] "Lord, what should I bring?" And and the
[58:08] thought came to me,
[58:11] the bride needs to be one with the word.
[58:13] That's it.
[58:15] and she needs to be one with the word.
[58:17] And you know, it really uh uh touched my
[58:20] heart because uh as soon as we got a new
[58:22] pope and you know, he's an American
[58:25] pope, which is, you know, I think it's
[58:28] that's it. It's the end of the world.
[58:30] Yeah, that's right.
[58:31] Because it's an American pope.
[58:34] [Laughter]
[58:37] But I'm nothing against my good American
[58:40] Christian neighbors. I love them. I love
[58:42] them. But it's an American pope and and
[58:45] brother Brandham said when the American
[58:47] pope comes in the World Council of
[58:50] Churches is going to be united.
[58:52] That's right.
[58:53] So if if the tears are uniting,
[58:57] it must mean the the bride is uniting
[59:01] the bride is uniting around his word and
[59:04] the tears are uniting because the tears
[59:06] will be bound first he said
[59:08] and then the word will be united. So
[59:12] let's stand to read the word this
[59:13] morning. John chapter 1 verse one verses
[59:16] 1-5 and Psalm 86 verses 10 to 12.
[59:22] And you know these are very familiar
[59:26] scriptures
[59:28] and these are the scriptures brother
[59:29] Brandham used in the in the message
[59:33] uh uniting uh
[59:36] uniting time and sign
[59:39] and
[59:42] I just love the word. So let's just bow
[59:45] our heads as before we open the holy
[59:47] scriptures and just ask the Lord to
[59:49] come. He's the only one that can
[59:51] interpret his word and bring clarity to
[59:53] it because it was written by him. So
[59:56] he's the one that clarifies his word. So
[59:58] Lord, we come and stand amazed in your
[1:00:01] presence this morning. I'm so amazed,
[1:00:04] Lord, that you love me.
[1:00:06] I'm so amazed that you care.
[1:00:09] Lord, I'm so happy to be standing in the
[1:00:11] midst of thy bride Jesus here in Nampa,
[1:00:15] Idaho. Lord, they have dedicated this
[1:00:18] house to worship
[1:00:20] and to thy word. And they have come,
[1:00:23] Lord, with a sacrifice of praise and
[1:00:25] worship and thanksgiving in their heart,
[1:00:28] Lord, for the great things that you have
[1:00:29] done for them. How you've revelated
[1:00:32] them, Lord Jesus. Opened their eyes,
[1:00:34] given them light,
[1:00:36] in this dark and evil generation to see
[1:00:40] that you are coming and taking them home
[1:00:43] out of this chaos. Lord, we're so
[1:00:45] thankful for your loving kindness. We're
[1:00:47] so thankful that you have given us life,
[1:00:50] light, peace, joy, deliverance, healing,
[1:00:54] salvation. Everything is from you.
[1:00:57] Everything is by you. And we just give
[1:00:59] you the glory for it. Lord, touch every
[1:01:01] needy individual, all those traveling,
[1:01:04] all those in need of healing, salvation,
[1:01:07] deliverance. You know our needs. You
[1:01:09] know our thoughts. You know our
[1:01:12] Lord Jesus prayer requests. We lay them
[1:01:14] before you, Lord. We don't want to pick
[1:01:16] them up again, but we lay them before
[1:01:18] you and say, Lord, have your way.
[1:01:21] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1:01:23] Amen.
[1:01:25] And it says, "In the beginning
[1:01:27] was the word
[1:01:30] and the word was with God, and the word
[1:01:35] was God." Amen. I I just to me the world
[1:01:40] if they could see this one verse in
[1:01:43] Bible and be open to him.
[1:01:45] Yeah.
[1:01:45] You know what the rapture would take
[1:01:47] place.
[1:01:48] But but he's only given it to those
[1:01:52] babes that desire
[1:01:54] Yes.
[1:01:55] to have it open to them.
[1:01:57] Amen.
[1:01:57] And he says, "And the same was in the
[1:01:59] beginning with God. All things were made
[1:02:02] by him, and without him was not anything
[1:02:06] made that was made.
[1:02:09] In him was life,
[1:02:12] and the life was the light of man, and
[1:02:15] the light shineth in darkness, and the
[1:02:18] darkness comprehended it not. Praise the
[1:02:22] Lord
[1:02:23] that we have comprehended the light,
[1:02:26] seen the light, received the light, and
[1:02:29] now are walking in
[1:02:31] the light.
[1:02:33] Let's just turn to Psalm 86. And this is
[1:02:36] a a wonderful psalm. I know we we
[1:02:39] stopped and and had some fellowship with
[1:02:41] the saints in in in Tri Cities there in
[1:02:44] Kenowick. and and we sang this song at
[1:02:48] the end. And I know they didn't know it
[1:02:49] that well, but this is a a a great psalm
[1:02:52] of David.
[1:02:54] And uh you know, I I just I love this
[1:02:58] psalm.
[1:03:00] And we'll read from verse 10. It says,
[1:03:03] "For thou art great
[1:03:07] and doest wondrous things." Oh my.
[1:03:11] Hallelujah.
[1:03:12] Thou art God alone.
[1:03:16] Teach me thy way, O Lord. I I I just
[1:03:20] pray this morning you would teach me thy
[1:03:22] ways.
[1:03:23] I will walk in thy truth.
[1:03:27] Now just let's read this second part
[1:03:29] together. Unite my heart to fear thy
[1:03:34] name. Amen. To to have reverence for his
[1:03:37] name. not to be afraid of him but to
[1:03:40] reverence his name and to say Lord your
[1:03:43] word in me oh Lord I want to be united
[1:03:46] your word in me
[1:03:49] I will praise thee oh Lord my God with
[1:03:52] all my heart and I will glorify
[1:03:56] thy name forever
[1:04:00] more. Amen. Will you glorify his name
[1:04:02] forever more? You may be seated. May God
[1:04:04] add his blessing to his word this
[1:04:06] morning. And you know, I'm just uh I I
[1:04:08] feel very comfortable. I don't know. I
[1:04:10] just feel like I'm at home here
[1:04:12] preaching to my own. It's about the same
[1:04:14] amount of people
[1:04:16] and I love it. And uh the only thing is
[1:04:19] is when I when I stream Grace Tabernacle
[1:04:22] and and and I'll just say this before I
[1:04:24] get into my message. I don't hear a lot
[1:04:26] of amens on the internet because you
[1:04:30] don't have a mic out there. But I'm
[1:04:32] happy because I can hear some.
[1:04:35] But I love more amens.
[1:04:39] Not because I need to be encouraged,
[1:04:42] but you know what? Brother uh uh Paul
[1:04:46] told us a testimony of a sister, I
[1:04:48] believe, that got her eyesight restored
[1:04:51] here.
[1:04:52] Yeah.
[1:04:53] Now, she didn't get her eyesight
[1:04:55] restored
[1:04:57] because he said he didn't put hands on
[1:04:59] her and pray for her.
[1:05:02] She got her eyesight restored because
[1:05:05] she received the word.
[1:05:07] That's right.
[1:05:08] That's right.
[1:05:09] And you know this morning I opened up
[1:05:10] the scripture another place. The
[1:05:12] centurion said, "Come and heal my
[1:05:14] servant."
[1:05:15] Yeah.
[1:05:17] He said, "I'm I'll come." He said, "No,
[1:05:19] no, no. You don't have to come. Just say
[1:05:20] the word."
[1:05:22] And you know, if if you will receive the
[1:05:24] word of God this morning and you say,
[1:05:26] "That is his word. Amen. I receive it,
[1:05:29] Lord." You can receive whatever you have
[1:05:32] need of
[1:05:34] and he can set you free right there
[1:05:36] where you're sitting. You don't have to
[1:05:37] come in a prayer line. I believe that is
[1:05:41] the bride age we're living in. That's
[1:05:43] how it should happen.
[1:05:45] We don't need prayer lines anymore.
[1:05:47] That's right.
[1:05:47] Oh, they're okay. But you know what? We
[1:05:50] shouldn't need hands laid on one
[1:05:51] another. We should just receive the
[1:05:52] word, believe the word, and receive and
[1:05:55] walk out of here healed.
[1:05:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:58] You believe that? Amen. Let's pray for
[1:06:00] that this morning that God would have
[1:06:02] his way. Can we say this morning, I am
[1:06:06] one with th with the word.
[1:06:08] Amen.
[1:06:09] Amen.
[1:06:09] Amen.
[1:06:10] Now, we all know if we have eyes to see
[1:06:12] and ears to hear that we are in the end
[1:06:15] time.
[1:06:17] Anybody doubt that we're in the end
[1:06:18] time? Anybody want to debate with me
[1:06:21] right now that we are we are in the end
[1:06:23] time? There's not going to be an age
[1:06:25] beyond this generation.
[1:06:27] That's right. Now, I'm not saying that
[1:06:29] to scare you,
[1:06:30] right?
[1:06:32] I'm saying that get ready.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:36] Amen.
[1:06:37] It doesn't take years. It takes moments,
[1:06:40] right?
[1:06:41] Lord, Lord, forgive me, Lord. I confess
[1:06:45] my faults. I I confess my sins. Deliver
[1:06:47] me. And right instantly there with a
[1:06:49] sincere heart and a broken spirit, you
[1:06:52] are instantly set free, delivered, and
[1:06:54] ready to to go to glory.
[1:06:57] That's our God. That's how cuz he's
[1:06:59] already paid the price.
[1:07:01] It's already paid.
[1:07:03] He
[1:07:04] paid it all.
[1:07:06] And we can receive it.
[1:07:07] Amen.
[1:07:09] All of our focus should be, am I ready
[1:07:11] to go?
[1:07:12] That's right.
[1:07:13] When Jesus Christ appears in the air, is
[1:07:15] my eye on him? Is all my attention and
[1:07:17] focus on pleasing him? That's should be
[1:07:20] our attention and focus on pleasing him.
[1:07:23] Lord, am I pleasing to you? Who can I
[1:07:25] speak to today?
[1:07:26] Amen.
[1:07:27] You know, that's my desire every
[1:07:28] morning. And I know you say, "Well,
[1:07:30] Brother Jonah, you're a pastor. You're a
[1:07:32] preacher. You're an outgoing guy." But
[1:07:35] that should be everybody's prayer every
[1:07:37] morning. Who can I speak to today? Who
[1:07:41] can I touch with the presence of the
[1:07:44] Lord? One word.
[1:07:45] Amen.
[1:07:46] And you know, it's not thinking, "Oh,
[1:07:49] what should I say? Do you believe the Do
[1:07:51] you believe we had a prophet this day?"
[1:07:54] No, it's touching them in what they're
[1:07:56] doing. Brother Bram said, you know, he
[1:07:58] was talking about about that that doctor
[1:08:01] and he says, "Well, you think I'm ready
[1:08:03] and blah blah blah." And he says, "Well,
[1:08:05] I see you going out and doing your thing
[1:08:09] where nobody else would go do it." You
[1:08:11] know, it's doing your thing, but with
[1:08:14] the Lord.
[1:08:15] Amen.
[1:08:16] And doing whatever you do as unto the
[1:08:19] Lord. and and whoever, you know, we have
[1:08:22] so many opportunities to sew a seed.
[1:08:26] Yes.
[1:08:26] Amen.
[1:08:27] That's all you got to do because God
[1:08:28] sends uh somebody like Paul to water it
[1:08:31] or somebody like Art to bring a song and
[1:08:34] all of a sudden that seed is is watered
[1:08:36] and all and he's the increase giver.
[1:08:38] See, he's the one that he is the seed
[1:08:41] and he's the increase giver. He's the
[1:08:43] one that germinates it. He's the one
[1:08:45] that brings it to life.
[1:08:50] Brother Brandham says as Israel's chosen
[1:08:52] people of God in majority forfeited
[1:08:55] their rights in the book of life by
[1:08:57] rejecting Jesus.
[1:09:00] So the majority of the gentile church
[1:09:02] will also come into condemnation with
[1:09:04] the resultant removal of their names
[1:09:07] from the book of life by rejecting the
[1:09:10] word thereby entering into the world
[1:09:12] economical movement which is the image
[1:09:15] erected unto the beast. And you know
[1:09:17] what? We're we're right at that
[1:09:19] manifesting time.
[1:09:20] Amen.
[1:09:22] You might say, "Well, what does that
[1:09:23] have to do with your message, brother?
[1:09:24] We're right at that manifesting time.
[1:09:27] were right at that time where the three
[1:09:29] Hebrew boys Daniel wasn't included in
[1:09:31] because the image was of him but they
[1:09:34] were erecting an image and they were
[1:09:36] they had to either bow before this image
[1:09:40] and live exactly
[1:09:41] or not bow before this image and say no
[1:09:45] God is more than able but if he doesn't
[1:09:47] do it we are not bowing and that's the
[1:09:50] time and season we are in folks
[1:09:53] that is the season we are in are Are you
[1:09:57] going to take the word?
[1:09:59] That's it.
[1:09:59] And say, "The word is my
[1:10:02] amen.
[1:10:03] Salvation. The word is my deliverance.
[1:10:06] Lord, you know how weak I am, but Lord,
[1:10:08] I'm standing. I don't care if I got to
[1:10:10] die on this hill, but I'm dying. I will
[1:10:12] not bow to nobody else but Jesus
[1:10:15] Christ."
[1:10:15] And he is the word.
[1:10:17] He is the word. That's what we believe
[1:10:19] as message believers. Jesus Christ is
[1:10:21] the word.
[1:10:23] Yes.
[1:10:23] Jesus Christ is who we preach. We don't
[1:10:26] preach William Brano. We preach Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ because he's the only savior.
[1:10:31] He's the only healer. He's the only one
[1:10:34] that died for you.
[1:10:35] Amen.
[1:10:36] But he uses men.
[1:10:39] But to reject the word, Jesus Christ,
[1:10:41] the one and only true God, we enter into
[1:10:44] the world economical beast movement. But
[1:10:47] to receive the word, we enter and become
[1:10:49] the word. See, I'll tell you what. Those
[1:10:52] three Hebrew boys were one with the word
[1:10:54] because they seen four men in that fire,
[1:10:56] right?
[1:10:57] And when they came out of the fire,
[1:10:59] there was only three. But the fourth one
[1:11:01] was in them. Hallelujah. I want him in
[1:11:04] me.
[1:11:05] I want him in me. I want to be
[1:11:09] the Lord.
[1:11:10] Him.
[1:11:12] Amen.
[1:11:13] You know, we as message people get
[1:11:15] caught up in so many minor controversies
[1:11:18] or sideline things. And you know what a
[1:11:20] sideline thing is?
[1:11:23] It's going off on the off the main
[1:11:25] track.
[1:11:25] Yeah.
[1:11:26] It's going off the main track. And when
[1:11:28] you go off the main track, how far can
[1:11:30] you get?
[1:11:32] Not very far.
[1:11:35] Not very far. You got to stay on the
[1:11:37] main track because the main track takes
[1:11:40] you east and west.
[1:11:42] The sidetrack is just a little drop off
[1:11:45] point, but we've got to get back to the
[1:11:47] mainline.
[1:11:48] Amen.
[1:11:49] And you know, and we get these little
[1:11:51] controversy sideline things from
[1:11:53] preachers.
[1:11:54] Amen.
[1:11:55] You know, that's one thing I loved about
[1:11:56] brother Paul. The first time I heard
[1:11:58] him, he said, "I didn't like preachers
[1:11:59] very much." And I love preachers, but I
[1:12:02] don't like preachers that think more of
[1:12:05] themselves
[1:12:06] and think that if you don't see it their
[1:12:08] way, you're not in.
[1:12:09] That's exactly right. You know, I don't
[1:12:11] care if you see it my way, but if you
[1:12:13] see him, you're in.
[1:12:15] You got to keep your eyes on him.
[1:12:17] Because I can't bring you there, but he
[1:12:19] can.
[1:12:21] See, that's the thing.
[1:12:22] That's it.
[1:12:22] We can't get off on any sideline, any
[1:12:26] church line. We we we It's not about me.
[1:12:30] It's about him.
[1:12:30] Amen.
[1:12:31] It's about him.
[1:12:33] You know, and and and you know, you can
[1:12:36] even it might not even be a preacher so
[1:12:38] much, but it might be his group.
[1:12:41] his group. Yes. His group lifts up the
[1:12:43] man.
[1:12:44] That's right.
[1:12:45] And they keep the man lifted up by,
[1:12:49] you know, I always said my congregation,
[1:12:51] don't ever say Jonah says, Jonah says
[1:12:56] because Jonah says whatever is not going
[1:13:00] to save you. But the word says, I'll
[1:13:02] tell you what, it makes the enemy shake.
[1:13:05] The word says, and I'll tell you what,
[1:13:08] you're healed. you're delivered and set
[1:13:10] free. That's the thing that matters is
[1:13:12] what the word says. So speak stick to
[1:13:15] the word.
[1:13:18] Amen.
[1:13:18] And and you know uh what it is is is is
[1:13:22] people are looking for attention.
[1:13:25] I'm not looking for attention.
[1:13:27] You know, I would have loved to be here
[1:13:29] in in Idaho uh many years ago.
[1:13:33] And I'm not putting my brother Paul down
[1:13:35] for not inviting me. You know what I
[1:13:37] believe? God has his timing.
[1:13:39] That's exactly
[1:13:39] more than I've got
[1:13:42] my desire. I got a desire to be a lot of
[1:13:44] places. You ask my wife around every
[1:13:46] corner I would go.
[1:13:49] But you know what? It's not God's
[1:13:50] timing.
[1:13:51] Amen.
[1:13:53] And you know what? It's it's good to be
[1:13:55] where you got to be when God's timing is
[1:13:57] there because then you're going to say
[1:13:58] the right thing at the right time and
[1:14:00] somebody will be delivered and somebody
[1:14:02] will be healed and somebody will be set
[1:14:03] free. Amen.
[1:14:06] That's what matters.
[1:14:07] That's it.
[1:14:10] So, no person can get you ready.
[1:14:14] No group
[1:14:16] has a franchise sir
[1:14:18] to sell.
[1:14:18] Yeah.
[1:14:21] I'll tell you. You know what? But you
[1:14:23] listen to some people. Oh my. if you're
[1:14:26] not associated with them and if you're
[1:14:28] not in their their little click and if
[1:14:31] you're not in their group chat and if
[1:14:34] you're not you know it's I'll tell you
[1:14:37] what I want to be in his chat
[1:14:39] I want him to say thou thou good and
[1:14:42] faithful servant well done because you
[1:14:44] know what he's my judge
[1:14:46] right
[1:14:47] and if he judges me before I leave this
[1:14:50] earth
[1:14:52] you know what I'll judge with him
[1:14:54] but if you're waiting for him to judge
[1:14:56] you, you're in the wrong side of the
[1:14:58] judgment bar. And I'll tell you what,
[1:15:00] let's judge ourselves.
[1:15:01] Amen.
[1:15:02] You know, you can't. And that's why I I
[1:15:05] I I sometimes, you know, um
[1:15:09] I won't throw anybody under the bus.
[1:15:11] That's why sometimes I always say, don't
[1:15:14] worry what others think.
[1:15:15] That's it.
[1:15:16] Worry what he thinks.
[1:15:17] That's right.
[1:15:18] That's the number one.
[1:15:20] That's right.
[1:15:20] That you got to worry about when he
[1:15:22] thinks what he thinks of you.
[1:15:25] what he what he thinks of his bride.
[1:15:29] That's what matters.
[1:15:31] That's the only thing that matters is
[1:15:33] what he thinks of you. Not what your
[1:15:35] neighbor, not what your best friend, not
[1:15:38] what that preacher, not what that group
[1:15:40] thinks. It's what he thinks. And I'll
[1:15:41] tell you what, when you need help in
[1:15:44] time of trouble, he's the one to go to.
[1:15:47] many people,
[1:15:50] you know, I I'm always and to me this is
[1:15:55] this is this is really how you know a
[1:15:57] real true believer. He sees somebody in
[1:16:00] need and goes and helps them. That's a
[1:16:02] true believer.
[1:16:06] An a really a makebeliever is one that
[1:16:08] sees the need and says, "Well, I'm sure
[1:16:10] that you know, Brother Paul can go help
[1:16:13] them. You know, he's got the means.
[1:16:16] You know, if you got $10 in your pocket
[1:16:18] and that man needs a hundred, give him
[1:16:20] the the 10.
[1:16:22] Give him the 10. So, he's already on his
[1:16:25] way.
[1:16:26] Yeah.
[1:16:26] And you know what? It'll encourage him
[1:16:28] to go get the other 90.
[1:16:30] That's right.
[1:16:31] Because you have you have done
[1:16:33] something. You see, that's that's I I
[1:16:36] just if I could imprint that one thing
[1:16:38] on you,
[1:16:40] do something for the Lord. Because you
[1:16:43] know so many people are in such need
[1:16:47] but they don't realize that when you
[1:16:49] give God gives more.
[1:16:52] When you give, God gives more.
[1:16:56] God loves it. But but he tests you. He
[1:16:59] tests you to see, oh, you need this
[1:17:02] money. Okay. Somebody comes by and says
[1:17:04] he needs something and you've got what
[1:17:06] he needs and you don't give it to him.
[1:17:07] God says, "Oh, you know what? He's not
[1:17:09] ready for what? for for for the for the
[1:17:12] mother load. He's not ready to find the
[1:17:14] pot of gold because he's not willing to
[1:17:16] give up what he has.
[1:17:18] Amen.
[1:17:19] And I I believe that real believers give
[1:17:22] what they have.
[1:17:24] They give from their heart. They give
[1:17:26] from their life. They're they're they
[1:17:29] live for others. That's when you're
[1:17:31] really living for him.
[1:17:33] Amen.
[1:17:33] When you're living for others.
[1:17:34] Yes, sir. That's right.
[1:17:38] So, no person can get you ready. no
[1:17:40] franchise.
[1:17:43] Every one of us has to have a one-on-one
[1:17:45] relationship with Jesus Christ. There's
[1:17:47] no other way.
[1:17:48] Yes, sir.
[1:17:50] And knowing everything we do, he sees.
[1:17:54] Just know that if you know that
[1:17:55] everything you do, everything you think,
[1:17:59] he sees.
[1:18:00] Amen.
[1:18:00] The word is the discerner of every
[1:18:02] thought and intent of your heart. So
[1:18:04] just your thinking, he sees.
[1:18:06] Amen.
[1:18:11] Every thought we think,
[1:18:14] most of us have heard the voice of the
[1:18:16] prophet of this age
[1:18:19] and we recognize it right away, right?
[1:18:22] Amen.
[1:18:23] When somebody turns on a tape or
[1:18:24] message, oh, that's the prophet
[1:18:32] because we've heard it many times and it
[1:18:34] imprinted in our minds.
[1:18:37] But in this age of AI,
[1:18:39] yeah, sir,
[1:18:42] they can duplicate every voice.
[1:18:45] Yes, sir.
[1:18:46] All they need is a sample.
[1:18:49] So, how are you going to know if the
[1:18:51] voice you hear is his voice?
[1:18:53] That's right.
[1:18:55] No, I I I just That's why I'm getting to
[1:18:58] you. Be united with the word.
[1:19:01] I'll tell you, be united with the word.
[1:19:04] Right. Amen. because they're going to
[1:19:07] they're going to duplicate his voice.
[1:19:09] That's
[1:19:09] right.
[1:19:12] And they're going to say, and I was
[1:19:14] expecting to get a sticker this morning
[1:19:18] cuz brother Paul said he's going to put
[1:19:20] a sticker on me that says press play
[1:19:24] and I was waiting for that sticker,
[1:19:30] but he didn't do it. I guess he's not
[1:19:33] I don't know. He was afraid maybe.
[1:19:38] But you know
[1:19:40] AI
[1:19:42] Yeah.
[1:19:44] artificial
[1:19:47] can mimic.
[1:19:48] Yes sir.
[1:19:49] But you know what it can't mimic is the
[1:19:52] word.
[1:19:54] You see AI artificial intelligence will
[1:19:57] never bring you to the word.
[1:19:58] No sir.
[1:20:00] Because artificial intelligence is
[1:20:02] artificial.
[1:20:04] It's not true intelligence.
[1:20:07] It's not the same intelligence that the
[1:20:09] word has.
[1:20:13] And that's what we have. That's why the
[1:20:16] real voice of God is one with his word.
[1:20:19] That's it.
[1:20:19] And if you know the written word, then
[1:20:21] you know if it is the true voice of God.
[1:20:24] Amen. That's right.
[1:20:25] See, then you know if it is the true
[1:20:27] voice of God and the real voice, we have
[1:20:30] to hear the voice of Jesus Christ. You
[1:20:32] have to have heard that voice. You might
[1:20:34] say, "Wow, Brother Jonah, I'm not a
[1:20:36] preacher. I'm I'm not." But you have to
[1:20:38] have heard the voice of Jesus Christ. I
[1:20:40] I think every believer here has heard
[1:20:43] his voice if you've ever been saved.
[1:20:46] Yes.
[1:20:46] And you might say, "Well, I didn't hear
[1:20:48] audible." But I'll tell you what, an
[1:20:50] inner voice. You've got to have heard
[1:20:52] the inner voice because otherwise you
[1:20:53] wouldn't believe you're you're saved
[1:20:55] today.
[1:20:57] How do you know you're saved?
[1:21:00] by the inner peace that that voice has
[1:21:02] told you,
[1:21:04] I've delivered you. I have saved you.
[1:21:07] I've redeemed you. Your sins are gone.
[1:21:09] They're under the blood. As far removed
[1:21:12] as darkness is from dawn. You've got to
[1:21:14] have heard that voice.
[1:21:16] Yes, sir.
[1:21:19] Every church age, the Lord said, "He who
[1:21:21] has an ear, let him hear what the spirit
[1:21:23] says unto the church." So, have you
[1:21:25] heard what the spirit says unto the
[1:21:27] church for this age? Right.
[1:21:30] Now, just to hear is not enough, but to
[1:21:34] receive it and then walk in it.
[1:21:37] Amen.
[1:21:38] You see, I can I can hold a hope hold up
[1:21:41] a bunch of metformin here and you got
[1:21:43] high blood sugars and you can look at
[1:21:46] and say, "Yes, I've received that."
[1:21:49] But if you don't take them, your blood
[1:21:51] sugars don't go down.
[1:21:52] Right?
[1:21:54] And if you have heard the voice and you
[1:21:56] don't apply
[1:21:58] the blood, you don't apply the word of
[1:22:01] God and you don't walk in the word of
[1:22:03] God, it doesn't help you.
[1:22:06] Amen.
[1:22:07] It doesn't do anything for you just to
[1:22:09] know it.
[1:22:10] That's right.
[1:22:10] You've got to do it.
[1:22:13] Amen.
[1:22:14] Brother Jonah, I've heard the voice of
[1:22:16] Revelation 10:7.
[1:22:18] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:22:20] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:22:22] sound, the mystery of God shall be
[1:22:24] finished. He hath declared it to his
[1:22:26] servants, the prophets.
[1:22:29] And you know that is great. And it's an
[1:22:31] important to have heard the voice of the
[1:22:33] seventh angel. He has declared the
[1:22:35] mysteries of God and placed the word in
[1:22:37] the right order of what the original
[1:22:40] apostles preached. He said it in the
[1:22:43] right order.
[1:22:45] You know, when you talk to somebody
[1:22:48] that's a denominational Christian and
[1:22:50] you tell them, "Have you been baptized?"
[1:22:52] Right?
[1:22:54] Because there's been nobody in the
[1:22:56] scripture baptized in the name of the
[1:22:58] titles, "Father,
[1:22:59] Son, and Holy Ghost."
[1:23:01] And they'll go,
[1:23:03] they'll look at you like
[1:23:06] they've never thought of that. But but
[1:23:08] but they don't respond to it,
[1:23:10] right?
[1:23:10] Because that's what their pastor told
[1:23:12] them.
[1:23:12] Yeah.
[1:23:14] But you say, "Well, well, have you read
[1:23:16] Acts, the book of Acts?" They've only
[1:23:18] baptized one way there. And the ones
[1:23:20] that got rebaptized
[1:23:23] baptized in the right baptism.
[1:23:25] That's correct.
[1:23:26] But you see, to know the mysteries and
[1:23:28] not do them
[1:23:30] is of no benefit.
[1:23:31] That's right.
[1:23:33] We have many people that believe the
[1:23:34] message of the hour.
[1:23:36] And I always say, two million people
[1:23:38] left Egypt.
[1:23:40] Two made it in.
[1:23:41] That's right. Because two of them not
[1:23:43] only heard and followed the prophet, but
[1:23:47] they believed what he said.
[1:23:48] Amen.
[1:23:49] They actually believed the words that
[1:23:52] Moses told them. They said, "We are more
[1:23:54] than able
[1:23:56] because they seen it wasn't Moses that
[1:23:58] led him. It wasn't the pillar of fire
[1:24:00] and and and the cloud and but it was God
[1:24:05] reacting and delivering them as they
[1:24:08] believed and walked in the truth. And
[1:24:11] and you know that is the same thing with
[1:24:13] us.
[1:24:14] Why don't we have more healings? Because
[1:24:16] we don't believe.
[1:24:17] That's it.
[1:24:18] Because we don't stand on his word and
[1:24:21] say, "Lord, this is what I need and I
[1:24:23] believe it and Lord, you've healed me."
[1:24:25] And start to confess it.
[1:24:26] Amen. That's it. See, confession brings
[1:24:29] on possession.
[1:24:30] Amen.
[1:24:31] And that's what Joshua and Caleb did.
[1:24:33] They confessed their possession and they
[1:24:36] went on to possess it.
[1:24:37] Amen.
[1:24:38] That's right. Amen.
[1:24:39] And God gave them everything.
[1:24:41] Amen.
[1:24:42] But you have to come to the anointed
[1:24:44] word and receive the person that is
[1:24:47] revealed in the mysteries.
[1:24:48] That's right.
[1:24:49] You see, the person revealed the message
[1:24:51] isn't William Brham. The person revealed
[1:24:53] in the mysteries is Jesus Christ, the
[1:24:55] word made real flesh. bled, died, and
[1:24:58] rose again to live in us. That's who's
[1:25:01] revealed in the mysteries.
[1:25:04] And
[1:25:06] to follow the prophet is not enough.
[1:25:10] You have to possess the very spirit of
[1:25:13] life of God revealed to us in the
[1:25:16] mystery of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:18] That is oh my I I that's what I want
[1:25:21] more than anything.
[1:25:22] That's it.
[1:25:24] That's what I want more than anything to
[1:25:26] know that he lives in me.
[1:25:28] That's it.
[1:25:29] That's right.
[1:25:30] That's the That's the whole
[1:25:32] That's it.
[1:25:33] That's the ticket. The token in.
[1:25:36] That's the absolute That's the token in.
[1:25:39] That's it. That's exactly
[1:25:40] That is it.
[1:25:41] That's right.
[1:25:42] Oh my. I I'll tell you, you know,
[1:25:44] Brother Bram says in the uniting time
[1:25:45] and sign
[1:25:47] paragraph 105, we see the nations
[1:25:49] uniting. We see the world uniting. We
[1:25:51] see the churches uniting. We see the
[1:25:53] bride uniting uniting with the word.
[1:25:55] Why?
[1:25:56] That's right.
[1:25:56] Why is it uniting with the word? The
[1:25:58] word is God.
[1:25:59] That's it.
[1:26:01] And the as the word as the bridegroom
[1:26:03] being the word and the bride being the
[1:26:05] hearer of the word, they come together
[1:26:07] in a union.
[1:26:08] That's right.
[1:26:08] They unite like a wedding.
[1:26:10] That's right.
[1:26:10] He said they are getting ready for a
[1:26:13] wedding.
[1:26:14] That's right.
[1:26:15] And they become one. The word becomes
[1:26:17] you and you become the word. Jesus said
[1:26:20] at that day you'll know it. All the
[1:26:22] Father is, I am. And all I am, you are.
[1:26:27] And all you are, I am. And that day
[1:26:30] you'll know that I'm in the Father and
[1:26:32] the Father in me and I in you and you in
[1:26:35] me. See that day? What day?
[1:26:37] Exactly.
[1:26:38] That's the day we're going home. When
[1:26:40] you know I am Christ and Christ is me
[1:26:43] and I am one with him and I look in the
[1:26:46] mirror, I see Jesus.
[1:26:47] Amen. That's it. When the neighbor looks
[1:26:50] at me, he sees Jesus.
[1:26:52] Amen.
[1:26:53] He might say, "Oh, that religious
[1:26:55] fanatic." But he sees Jesus because
[1:26:57] Jesus was looked on
[1:26:59] the same way.
[1:27:00] Amen.
[1:27:02] Brother and sister, have we been united
[1:27:04] with the word?
[1:27:06] Can we say when we we see you, you see
[1:27:09] Jesus Christ? Because we have become one
[1:27:11] with him.
[1:27:12] What I say, he says.
[1:27:13] Amen.
[1:27:14] See what I say, Jesus says. That's to
[1:27:16] come. I have very much confidence in a
[1:27:18] preacher that preaches the word because
[1:27:20] the word is is the only reality we know.
[1:27:23] That's right. Amen. That's right.
[1:27:25] And what he shows me I do. My father and
[1:27:28] I are one. See, Jesus said, "What he
[1:27:31] shows me I do. What he tells me I do. I
[1:27:33] don't do anything else but what he tells
[1:27:35] me."
[1:27:36] Thomas, what's the matter with you? You
[1:27:38] see me, you see the father. What have
[1:27:41] you been looking at?
[1:27:42] That's right.
[1:27:43] You see, it's that simple. That's right.
[1:27:45] Exactly.
[1:27:46] But you know what? It's that complicated
[1:27:48] for blind for blind people.
[1:27:51] See, blind people can't see it.
[1:27:53] Amen.
[1:27:54] They just they just can't see it
[1:27:57] because God's got to open their eyes.
[1:27:59] And it's the simplicity of the word made
[1:28:02] real to us.
[1:28:06] How can I or or we tell that someone has
[1:28:09] been united with Jesus Christ?
[1:28:12] Is it because every time they speak they
[1:28:14] quote the prophet
[1:28:16] or the scripture?
[1:28:19] They're always are speaking of the
[1:28:21] things of God making you feel guilty.
[1:28:23] You know, I've got I there's there's a
[1:28:25] sister that I know and my wife knows and
[1:28:28] whenever you come together with her, you
[1:28:30] know, I'll tell you what, you almost
[1:28:32] feel like you don't even know the
[1:28:34] message.
[1:28:36] You ever have that feeling when you're
[1:28:38] with somebody and and oh my the prophet
[1:28:41] this the prophet that and oh it's just
[1:28:44] it's just the prophet the prophet and
[1:28:47] and and well what about the word?
[1:28:49] That's right.
[1:28:50] That's right.
[1:28:51] That's it. Well, they just regard they
[1:28:53] just glance over that and it's the
[1:28:54] prophet said this, the prophet said, and
[1:28:56] you feel almost like I said, when you're
[1:28:58] in her presence, you feel like you don't
[1:29:00] even you probably don't I probably don't
[1:29:02] even believe the message, but I know
[1:29:03] it's the truth and I and I believe it as
[1:29:06] the truth, but but yet she makes you
[1:29:08] feel.
[1:29:09] That's it. That's it.
[1:29:11] But, you know, if you would take the
[1:29:12] outside
[1:29:14] that's it
[1:29:14] facade off.
[1:29:15] That's it.
[1:29:16] And you would get right down to the
[1:29:18] heart. She's desperately in need of
[1:29:22] Jesus to come in.
[1:29:23] That's exactly
[1:29:24] because you know what?
[1:29:26] It's not our job to make people feel
[1:29:28] guilty.
[1:29:30] It's our job to bring them to the
[1:29:32] fountain,
[1:29:33] to the well that Jesus brought the woman
[1:29:36] to at the well.
[1:29:37] It's our job to to go to the blind man,
[1:29:41] make a little clay, and put it on his
[1:29:42] eyes and say, "Go wash and be free. Go
[1:29:45] washing and see." That's our job.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:49] It's not the guilt. It's Christ.
[1:29:53] We got to give Christ out
[1:29:55] because the word is in us.
[1:29:57] Amen.
[1:29:58] That's what I want.
[1:29:59] Amen.
[1:30:04] And you know,
[1:30:06] we don't want a religious spirit,
[1:30:09] but you know what? We can get it.
[1:30:12] How do we get a religious spirit? Not
[1:30:14] repenting.
[1:30:15] That's how religious spirit. But you
[1:30:17] want to fit in,
[1:30:19] yeah,
[1:30:19] with a message group. That's how you get
[1:30:21] a religious spirit. Not repenting, not
[1:30:24] confessing your sins, not making things
[1:30:26] right, but just speaking like you you're
[1:30:30] you're the greatest revelated person on
[1:30:32] earth.
[1:30:34] And you know what? God sees through
[1:30:36] everything.
[1:30:37] Amen.
[1:30:37] You know, if we would just realize he he
[1:30:40] sees through every facade. He sees
[1:30:42] through through your bluff. He sees
[1:30:45] through your aggression. and he sees
[1:30:46] through it all. He knows exactly who you
[1:30:48] are, what you are.
[1:30:50] He loves a broken spirit and a humble
[1:30:53] heart, contrite heart. And then he
[1:30:55] blesses you. Then he changes you. Then
[1:30:57] he heals you. Then he delivers you.
[1:30:59] That's all he's looking for.
[1:31:01] Amen.
[1:31:05] It's the love of God in them that proves
[1:31:08] who they are. See, that's our capstone.
[1:31:11] The love of God is our capstone. Perfect
[1:31:13] love.
[1:31:13] Amen. No matter what somebody says to
[1:31:15] you and says about you, you're always
[1:31:18] giving them unto the Lord. See, that's
[1:31:20] the sign of a true believer. You're
[1:31:22] always giving them unto the Lord. Not
[1:31:24] condemning them, not saying something
[1:31:26] worse than they said about you just to
[1:31:28] make yourself feel good. No, no, no, no.
[1:31:30] That's then you're just you're just
[1:31:32] well, you're just an unbeliever.
[1:31:35] When when you're when somebody slings
[1:31:37] dirt and you sling more back, that's a
[1:31:39] that's a sure sign that you need
[1:31:40] salvation.
[1:31:41] Amen. That's right.
[1:31:44] Yeah. But when somebody throws dirt and
[1:31:46] you throw bread.
[1:31:48] That's right.
[1:31:48] See, what is bread? Bread is is
[1:31:50] something to eat. Bread is the living
[1:31:52] word of God. That's what bread is.
[1:31:54] Amen.
[1:31:56] And that's the love of God.
[1:31:58] Amen. That's right.
[1:31:59] See, give them a way out. Give them a
[1:32:01] way of escape. That's what Jesus did. He
[1:32:03] gave us a way of escape.
[1:32:04] That's right.
[1:32:05] And that's what we have to offer those.
[1:32:10] For love covers a multitude of sins.
[1:32:14] You know, brother Brandham says in the
[1:32:16] message uniting time and sign, he says,
[1:32:19] "The church has received a heavenly
[1:32:20] sign."
[1:32:21] Yeah.
[1:32:22] Paragraph 111, an astronaut. Amen. Jesus
[1:32:25] Christ in the form of a pillar of fire.
[1:32:28] He says that he was in the Old Testament
[1:32:31] that he was when he met Saul on the road
[1:32:33] down there in Damascus.
[1:32:36] The same Jesus here today.
[1:32:37] Amen.
[1:32:38] And what does it do? Does it bring fear?
[1:32:40] It brings love.
[1:32:42] A uniting of one another. Amen. A
[1:32:45] feeling for one another.
[1:32:48] It brings the love of God. Oh, uniting
[1:32:50] us and brings us the body of Christ into
[1:32:53] unity as a bride. That's what it's doing
[1:32:56] now. This great union with God. See,
[1:32:59] that's that's how you know you're
[1:33:01] uniting with the word and the word is in
[1:33:03] you is when the love of God is portrayed
[1:33:05] from you.
[1:33:09] They're uniting themselves. One group
[1:33:11] here to fight the other one.
[1:33:14] That's not God.
[1:33:17] One group over here to fight the that
[1:33:19] here the church is standing between
[1:33:21] them. You watch what happens. It'll
[1:33:23] unite with them.
[1:33:25] That's exactly right. But now we find
[1:33:27] out that brings fear and frustrations.
[1:33:30] But the church, the bride is united by
[1:33:33] one God under one spirit, the spirit of
[1:33:36] God in one holy union of God to be one
[1:33:39] holy bride to God. That's right. All
[1:33:42] together unity of the body.
[1:33:44] That's it.
[1:33:45] A body waiting as a bride as it is the
[1:33:48] bride as we call ourselves the bride.
[1:33:50] For the uniting time of the bride, the
[1:33:51] church is coming together.
[1:33:53] Amen.
[1:33:54] It should create such a love among us
[1:33:56] that we could hardly be away from one
[1:33:58] another.
[1:33:59] Yeah.
[1:34:00] That's right. When you just You don't
[1:34:02] have to beg people to pray.
[1:34:04] No. That's right.
[1:34:06] You don't have to beg them to worship
[1:34:08] God.
[1:34:09] Right.
[1:34:10] You don't have to beg them to do what's
[1:34:12] right. That's just so in love with him
[1:34:15] till there's nothing else.
[1:34:18] That's exactly.
[1:34:19] You see, I I I sometimes, you know, I'm
[1:34:21] I sometimes beg for an amen or two. Not
[1:34:24] for me, but for God,
[1:34:26] but I shouldn't. I shouldn't have to.
[1:34:28] Right.
[1:34:29] When you come together as a bride of
[1:34:31] Christ, you know how many here never say
[1:34:33] amen in the service. I want to see how
[1:34:35] many will lift your hands. Nobody. Well,
[1:34:37] that's perfect. Everybody says amen.
[1:34:39] Just say it a little louder.
[1:34:42] Just a little bit louder that God would
[1:34:44] hear you.
[1:34:46] He already sees your thoughts, but just
[1:34:48] say it a little louder so he can hear.
[1:34:50] I'll tell you what, you know, your your
[1:34:52] whole atmosphere in your in your in your
[1:34:54] bench will change.
[1:34:56] That's it. That's right. Exactly.
[1:34:59] You know how to you know how to become
[1:35:01] rich.
[1:35:04] I'm going to give you a tip. Start
[1:35:06] saving money.
[1:35:10] Put a dollar away
[1:35:13] every day. Put a dollar away. You'll get
[1:35:16] rich.
[1:35:18] How do you get closer to God?
[1:35:21] Say amen every day.
[1:35:23] Lord, thy word, it means something to
[1:35:26] me. Thy word is real to me, Lord. Your
[1:35:29] word has saved me. Your word has
[1:35:31] delivered me. Your word is everything I
[1:35:33] need.
[1:35:34] Just just try that and see what happens
[1:35:38] right in your bench.
[1:35:39] Amen.
[1:35:39] See what happens in your life.
[1:35:42] I'll tell you what, it's like saving
[1:35:43] money. It's like it's like work. You got
[1:35:45] a big pile of rocks to move. You got to
[1:35:47] move one rock at a time. But if you
[1:35:49] don't start, the pile stays there.
[1:35:52] That's right.
[1:35:52] The pile stays there. The doubt stays
[1:35:55] there. The guilt stays there. The the
[1:35:58] burden stays there if you don't move it.
[1:36:00] That's right.
[1:36:02] Move it and see what God will do for
[1:36:03] you.
[1:36:04] Amen.
[1:36:07] And then he goes on to say in in in in
[1:36:10] paragraph 114, he says, "What do you
[1:36:13] think about a little girl, a real pretty
[1:36:15] little maid that's going to marry some
[1:36:17] handsome young man
[1:36:20] that she's so madly in love with means
[1:36:23] more to her than her own life? She knows
[1:36:27] the right way that they're going to get
[1:36:30] married. She knows right away that
[1:36:32] they're going to get married." As that
[1:36:33] wedding day approaches, that little
[1:36:35] fella, I'm telling you, she's all
[1:36:38] walking around. She's making her
[1:36:39] everything ready. She surrenders
[1:36:42] completely to him.
[1:36:45] That's right. Everything that pleases
[1:36:47] him. That's just what she wants to do.
[1:36:49] Well, that should be the way of the
[1:36:51] church today,
[1:36:52] right?
[1:36:53] That our life should be so hid in God
[1:36:55] through Christ, sealed in there by the
[1:36:57] Holy Spirit, that all we do is do what's
[1:37:00] pleasing unto God. Lord, if you want to
[1:37:02] hear my amen, I amen today. I give you
[1:37:05] glory. I lift up my hands and praise
[1:37:08] unto thy name.
[1:37:10] Amen.
[1:37:10] I give you the hallelujah.
[1:37:13] You know, look at what those children
[1:37:15] did when Jesus got on that coal, the
[1:37:18] full f full of an ass, and went into
[1:37:21] Jerusalem. Yes, sir.
[1:37:23] And those scribes and those people quit.
[1:37:26] Hosana to the Lord. That's what they
[1:37:29] were saying. He said, "If they wouldn't
[1:37:30] cry out, the rocks would cry out."
[1:37:33] You know, if we don't cry out and say,
[1:37:36] "Hosana to the Lord. Oh Lord God, you
[1:37:39] are worthy of praise, worthy of honor.
[1:37:42] You are the one that we glorify." You
[1:37:43] know what? If we don't do that, he's
[1:37:45] going to go look for another bride.
[1:37:46] That's exactly right. Amen.
[1:37:48] He's going to go find another bride.
[1:37:53] If you wouldn't love your husband and on
[1:37:55] the wedding day, you don't even give him
[1:37:57] any attention. You don't you don't hug
[1:37:59] him. You don't you know he's going to
[1:38:00] say, "Well, I'm not going to get married
[1:38:02] to you.
[1:38:04] I don't want anything to do with this
[1:38:06] cold bride.
[1:38:08] There's nothing that should or can
[1:38:10] separate us from the love of God."
[1:38:13] And the same goes for brothers and
[1:38:15] sisters in the Lord.
[1:38:16] Amen.
[1:38:17] God loved us, so he died for us. John
[1:38:19] says, "If you can't love your brother
[1:38:21] who you can see, how can you love God
[1:38:22] who you can't?"
[1:38:25] You know, now I'm going to get to some
[1:38:27] real nitty-gritty here. I really like
[1:38:31] Brother Paul Hlet. You know, I like him.
[1:38:35] You know, I said something to him once.
[1:38:38] I said there was two preachers that I
[1:38:40] really liked and he was one of them and
[1:38:43] Brother Ken Boyer who God took home. He
[1:38:45] must have completed his journey because
[1:38:47] he preached one perfect sermon and God
[1:38:49] said, "Okay, that's it, Brother Ken.
[1:38:51] You're you're you're fit for the
[1:38:53] kingdom. I'm taking you home.
[1:38:54] And I miss that, brother.
[1:39:00] But I'm not going to get up here for 10
[1:39:02] minutes and tell you how good he is, how
[1:39:05] revealed he is,
[1:39:07] and how much everybody adores brother
[1:39:09] Paul.
[1:39:11] The truth.
[1:39:12] Really, every one of us is just a bit of
[1:39:14] dust. Brother, I'm just going to tell
[1:39:15] you right from my heart. And we are like
[1:39:18] brother Brandham says
[1:39:22] about a spoonful of ocean.
[1:39:24] Yeah.
[1:39:25] You know you take you dip your finger in
[1:39:27] the ocean and pull it back. You don't
[1:39:29] see the dip because
[1:39:36] or a finger mark in the water.
[1:39:40] You're just a a little of the whole lump
[1:39:43] and made of the same hole.
[1:39:46] See, I am nothing. Brother Paul is
[1:39:48] nothing. But the Lord Jesus Christ in us
[1:39:51] is the word of God revealed in us.
[1:39:54] And when he speaks through him or us, it
[1:39:59] is him.
[1:40:00] Yes, sir.
[1:40:01] And when he uses us, it's not us. It's
[1:40:03] him.
[1:40:04] That's right.
[1:40:05] It's him.
[1:40:07] You know, when God used Brother
[1:40:09] Brandham, you know, he would have
[1:40:10] healing campaigns. He didn't say, "I'm
[1:40:13] going to heal you."
[1:40:14] Right. Right. No. Right?
[1:40:16] He preached until faith was raised in
[1:40:18] the building. Then he says, "He's here
[1:40:19] now. Let's have a prayer line now. Let's
[1:40:22] pray for the sick."
[1:40:24] You know, my dad went through a prayer
[1:40:25] line of brother Brandham's in Grand
[1:40:27] Prairie.
[1:40:29] And my dad had a really bad back
[1:40:32] and he was so looking forward to going
[1:40:36] through that prayer line and have
[1:40:37] brother Brandham lay his hands on him.
[1:40:41] And you know how it's it's amazing how
[1:40:43] God does things.
[1:40:46] And so he walked up to the prayer line
[1:40:50] and brother Brandham was there and
[1:40:51] brother Brandham just tapped him on the
[1:40:52] shoulder and says pass on brother.
[1:40:56] So he passed on and he was just oh he
[1:40:58] thought Lord I come for healing of my
[1:41:01] back. And he got to hear when he was
[1:41:03] just stepping down. Brother Bam turns
[1:41:04] around you brother your back is healed.
[1:41:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:08] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:41:10] Wasn't the touch that healed him.
[1:41:12] It was the word that healed him.
[1:41:15] That's it.
[1:41:16] That's exactly.
[1:41:17] And you know what? My dad got the
[1:41:19] revelation.
[1:41:20] It's not the man's touch.
[1:41:22] That's right. Amen.
[1:41:23] It's the word.
[1:41:24] Amen.
[1:41:25] See, it's the word that heals you.
[1:41:28] That's it.
[1:41:29] And he was one with the word.
[1:41:31] Amen.
[1:41:31] And he brought us back to the word. And
[1:41:33] so that same word I hope is in brother
[1:41:35] Paul and hope is in me
[1:41:37] and brother Dinhart and brother David
[1:41:40] when that word comes into us and we
[1:41:42] speak that word the same things can
[1:41:44] happen.
[1:41:45] That's right.
[1:41:46] It has to be cuz he's the same
[1:41:48] yesterday, today and forever. He is the
[1:41:50] same God. He's still on the scene until
[1:41:52] he takes us home.
[1:41:54] And that is God. That is that is what he
[1:41:57] wants to use. So it's not him. It's not
[1:41:59] me. It's God.
[1:42:00] Amen. And when we receive everything
[1:42:03] spoken by the word of God and receive it
[1:42:05] as the word of God, then he will do the
[1:42:08] impossible. That's when we will see more
[1:42:10] miracles happening in our midst than
[1:42:12] ever before because you'll come in and
[1:42:14] you'll sit in that bench and say, "Amen.
[1:42:17] That's the word." And you'll walk out of
[1:42:18] here.
[1:42:19] You'll walk out of here saved.
[1:42:21] You'll walk out of here delivered. But
[1:42:23] you've got to respond to the word
[1:42:25] because you're uniting with the word and
[1:42:28] letting it come in and take you over.
[1:42:32] Amen.
[1:42:33] Have you and like I I'm just going to
[1:42:35] say this because this is what I believe.
[1:42:39] You know, God has no grandchildren.
[1:42:43] You know, our children need salvation
[1:42:45] just like we got salvation.
[1:42:48] Exactly. So just because you raised them
[1:42:51] in the message, you brought them up in
[1:42:52] the church. Doesn't mean they're
[1:42:54] Christians.
[1:42:54] That's right.
[1:42:55] They've got to say, "Lord, come into
[1:42:57] me." That's right.
[1:42:58] Lord, forgive me. Lord, I'm a sinner. I
[1:43:01] need thy salvation. I need thy
[1:43:03] deliverance. Come and save me and set me
[1:43:05] free.
[1:43:06] Amen.
[1:43:06] And then you become a part of Jesus. And
[1:43:10] Jesus becomes a part of you. And then
[1:43:13] you walk with him.
[1:43:14] That's it.
[1:43:14] But until you do that,
[1:43:16] Amen.
[1:43:17] You're just
[1:43:19] full of knowledge.
[1:43:20] That's it.
[1:43:20] Without wisdom. Without wisdom.
[1:43:23] Without wisdom.
[1:43:24] Exactly right.
[1:43:25] Amen.
[1:43:30] Now, I just want to show you something.
[1:43:31] God showed this to me and I there's, you
[1:43:35] know, three preachers here and I don't
[1:43:36] know if you're going to see the same
[1:43:37] thing I see. But you know what I love? I
[1:43:41] love that we can look at the word of God
[1:43:43] and we can all see a little different
[1:43:45] angle and see it just a little different
[1:43:47] way.
[1:43:48] And I want to read this to you.
[1:43:51] Okay, I got a few more minutes.
[1:43:54] Good. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:55] Second Kings 2
[1:43:59] verses 1 to 12.
[1:44:03] Now you know sometimes we we take
[1:44:05] examples from the New Testament and then
[1:44:07] I like to take an example from the
[1:44:09] negative and the positive.
[1:44:13] The negative you know the old pictures
[1:44:15] are black and white
[1:44:17] and the new ones you get full color and
[1:44:19] dimensions and all that but sometimes
[1:44:22] from the old dimension you really it it
[1:44:24] really gives you God's way of doing
[1:44:28] things.
[1:44:30] And here, and it came to pass when the
[1:44:33] Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by
[1:44:36] a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[1:44:39] from Gilgal,
[1:44:41] like you know, he met him and he was
[1:44:45] plowing. See, God can only use those
[1:44:47] that work.
[1:44:49] Amen.
[1:44:50] I just I just want to show you
[1:44:51] something.
[1:44:52] God's not looking for for idol. He's
[1:44:56] always comes to somebody that's working.
[1:44:58] Yeah.
[1:44:58] Amen.
[1:45:00] See, God's not interested in laziness.
[1:45:04] He's looking for people that are
[1:45:05] working. And here, Elisha was was with a
[1:45:08] 12 yolk of oxin. He he was a serious
[1:45:11] farmer like like brother Paul.
[1:45:14] He was a serious farmer.
[1:45:17] And
[1:45:20] you know what? Elisha Elijah didn't
[1:45:22] preach him a message.
[1:45:25] He just took like the shaw the lady has,
[1:45:27] threw his mantle over him, flipped it
[1:45:30] off, and away he went. And Elisha felt
[1:45:33] something.
[1:45:36] He felt something. He said, "Hold it. I
[1:45:38] just want to go home." He said, "Oh,
[1:45:39] what do I got to do with you? Do
[1:45:41] whatever you want to do."
[1:45:43] Yeah.
[1:45:45] So, he sacrificed. You know what? He br
[1:45:48] he he burnt the bridge down.
[1:45:51] That's right. So there was no more
[1:45:53] plowing.
[1:45:54] He burnt the plow,
[1:45:56] sacrificed
[1:45:57] a set of oxen.
[1:46:00] And then he followed Elijah.
[1:46:02] And here we pick it up.
[1:46:06] And Elijah said unto Elisha, "Try here,
[1:46:08] I pray thee, for the Lord has sent me to
[1:46:10] Bethl."
[1:46:11] You know what Bethl is, eh? As as a
[1:46:13] spiritual believers, that's the house of
[1:46:15] God. That's where God first was
[1:46:18] worshiped. And Elisha said unto him, "As
[1:46:21] the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth,
[1:46:22] I will not leave thee." So they went
[1:46:25] down to Bethl. Now get this. And the
[1:46:28] sons of the prophets that were at Bethl
[1:46:30] came forth to Elisha. They didn't go to
[1:46:32] Elijah. They went to Elisha.
[1:46:36] The new convert,
[1:46:38] the new person.
[1:46:40] Yeah.
[1:46:41] Amen.
[1:46:41] And said unto him, "Knowest thou that
[1:46:44] the Lord will take away thy master from
[1:46:46] thy head today?" And he said, "Yeah, I
[1:46:48] know it. hold your your peace. In other
[1:46:50] words, don't give me your opinion. I
[1:46:51] don't care about your opinion. I care
[1:46:54] about what's going to happen.
[1:46:56] Amen.
[1:46:56] I care about what the Lord will say,
[1:46:58] what the Lord will do.
[1:47:00] You know, don't get caught up arguing
[1:47:03] with people.
[1:47:04] That's right. Amen.
[1:47:05] And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, Terry,
[1:47:08] here I pray thee, for the Lord has sent
[1:47:10] me to Jericho.
[1:47:12] You know what Jericho is? Hey, great
[1:47:14] victory in Jericho.
[1:47:16] You know, we can have great victory here
[1:47:18] this morning.
[1:47:21] They got they they broke the walls down,
[1:47:24] right? Amen.
[1:47:25] They didn't shout in the name of the
[1:47:27] Lord. They just praised them.
[1:47:29] Amen.
[1:47:30] That's it.
[1:47:30] That's what'll happen.
[1:47:31] That's right.
[1:47:32] You want You want the walls to fall, you
[1:47:34] want Satan to be defeated, start
[1:47:36] praising.
[1:47:36] That's right.
[1:47:37] Start praising the Lord. Start shouting
[1:47:39] unto him with a voice of triumph and see
[1:47:41] what happens. That's right.
[1:47:42] You know, we get so
[1:47:44] Yeah. Oh, we get so worked up and oh, we
[1:47:47] just want sympathy.
[1:47:50] You want sympathy this morning? You
[1:47:51] won't get it from me.
[1:47:54] I'll give you the word. I'll tell you.
[1:47:55] Repent and seek the Lord and he will
[1:47:58] find him. He will deliver you.
[1:48:00] Amen.
[1:48:01] Amen.
[1:48:04] And
[1:48:06] and he said, "As the Lord liveth, and as
[1:48:07] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee."
[1:48:09] So they came to Jericho.
[1:48:12] And the sons of the prophets that were
[1:48:13] in Jericho came to Elisha and said unto
[1:48:17] him, "Knowest thou that the Lord will
[1:48:19] take away thy master from thy head
[1:48:20] today?" And he answered, "You know,
[1:48:23] yeah, I know it. Hold ye your peace." In
[1:48:25] other words, don't give me your opinion.
[1:48:26] I'm not interested in your opinion.
[1:48:29] You know what? I'm not interested in
[1:48:31] your opinion
[1:48:32] or your opinion. I'm interested in what
[1:48:34] the word says and what the word says.
[1:48:37] Amen.
[1:48:37] You see, that's what we should hold.
[1:48:39] Hold to the word. Hold to the word's
[1:48:41] opinion. Don't care what brother
[1:48:45] so and so says. I won't use any names
[1:48:47] because it might be your favorite
[1:48:49] preacher. Don't matter what brother
[1:48:51] Jonah says. It matters what the word
[1:48:54] says. It matters what God has said. And
[1:48:58] look at this.
[1:49:00] And Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray
[1:49:02] thee here, for the Lord hath sent me to
[1:49:04] Jordan. And he said, as the Lord liveth,
[1:49:06] and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave
[1:49:08] thee. And they too went on. And the 50
[1:49:10] men of the sons of the prophets went and
[1:49:12] stood to view a far off. And they too
[1:49:14] stood by Jordan.
[1:49:16] Yeah.
[1:49:17] And Elijah took his mantle, wrapped it
[1:49:20] together, smoked the waters, and they
[1:49:21] were divided thither and thither, hither
[1:49:23] and thither. So the two went over on dry
[1:49:26] land. And I just want to stop here and
[1:49:29] say
[1:49:31] there was no comment. There's no opinion
[1:49:34] given.
[1:49:36] You know why?
[1:49:39] The word in action.
[1:49:40] Amen.
[1:49:43] You see the word when the word starts
[1:49:47] to part the waters.
[1:49:48] That's it.
[1:49:51] When the word reveals the hidden things
[1:49:53] of the heart, there's no opinions given.
[1:49:56] That's it.
[1:49:58] Because the opinions would be discerned.
[1:50:01] That's it.
[1:50:01] From where they come from.
[1:50:11] And it came to pass when they went over
[1:50:12] and Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask what I
[1:50:15] shall do for thee before I be taken away
[1:50:17] from thee." And Elisha said, "I pray
[1:50:19] thee, let a double portion of thy spirit
[1:50:21] upon me."
[1:50:24] And he said, "Thou hast a hard thing.
[1:50:26] Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am
[1:50:28] taken from thee, it shall be so unto
[1:50:30] thee. But if not, it shall not be so.
[1:50:34] And it came to pass as they still went
[1:50:36] on and talked that behold there appeared
[1:50:38] a chariot of fire and horses of fire and
[1:50:41] parted them both a thunder and Elijah
[1:50:43] went up whirlwind into heaven. And
[1:50:46] Elisha saw it and he cried, "My father,
[1:50:48] my father, the chariot of Israel and the
[1:50:51] horsemen thereof." And he saw him no
[1:50:52] more. And he took hold of his own
[1:50:54] clothes and rent them into pieces. Have
[1:50:58] we rent our own
[1:51:00] garments?
[1:51:02] Have we rent our own thinking right
[1:51:05] there,
[1:51:05] our own denominational thinking? You
[1:51:07] know, so many people have taken their
[1:51:09] Baptist
[1:51:11] their Baptist salvation and added the
[1:51:14] message to it.
[1:51:15] So they've become revealed Baptists
[1:51:20] or revealed Pentecostals or revealed
[1:51:22] Luther.
[1:51:23] Amen. That's exactly
[1:51:24] because there are some people act like
[1:51:25] Luther
[1:51:26] in our midst. They don't they don't
[1:51:28] move. They they don't they don't say
[1:51:30] anything. They don't worship the Lord
[1:51:32] because hey, this is a holy place. We
[1:51:34] got to be quiet,
[1:51:37] right?
[1:51:38] Well, how about the shout?
[1:51:41] Amen.
[1:51:41] There's got to be a shout. There's got
[1:51:43] to be a sacrifice of praise.
[1:51:45] That's what the scripture says. Like, we
[1:51:47] got to do what the word says.
[1:51:48] When you do what the word says, then God
[1:51:50] reveals himself.
[1:51:51] See, then God comes on the scene.
[1:51:54] Praise.
[1:51:54] And so you got to take your old garment
[1:51:56] off.
[1:52:00] And we got to quit listening to the
[1:52:02] voices.
[1:52:02] That's it.
[1:52:03] Quit listening to this opinion, that
[1:52:05] opinion. Just believe what the word
[1:52:07] says.
[1:52:07] Amen.
[1:52:08] Take God at his word. Take the word and
[1:52:10] say, "Lord, that word is my word."
[1:52:11] Amen.
[1:52:12] And I believe it. And I'll stand on it,
[1:52:14] Lord. And I will go through the furnace
[1:52:15] with it. because you'll be the fourth
[1:52:18] one in the fire fanning me so that I
[1:52:20] won't even get touched by the smoke and
[1:52:23] my bondage will go.
[1:52:26] G.
[1:52:26] See, that's what the glory of God can
[1:52:28] do.
[1:52:28] That's right,
[1:52:30] saints. When he saw the prophet go up,
[1:52:33] he rent his own garments. His covering
[1:52:36] that he had was no good. He took the
[1:52:38] mantle of the word that God ordained him
[1:52:41] for
[1:52:42] to receive and went to the Jordan using
[1:52:45] the word and parted it and went on to do
[1:52:47] the will of God. He had seven great
[1:52:50] miracles.
[1:52:52] Yeah.
[1:52:52] More than Elijah.
[1:52:55] And the word of the Lord had become one
[1:52:57] with him. See, he'd become one with the
[1:52:59] word.
[1:53:00] That's it.
[1:53:01] And I'll tell you what, if Elisha could
[1:53:04] become one of the word, we can become of
[1:53:05] the word because God's got to give us a
[1:53:07] double portion so we can make it.
[1:53:09] That's right.
[1:53:10] I want to make it.
[1:53:12] That's right.
[1:53:12] I want to make it more than anything
[1:53:14] else.
[1:53:15] I want to be there.
[1:53:18] I'll tell you what, if you read in
[1:53:20] Revelations and read about the plagues
[1:53:22] coming on Earth, and we were just
[1:53:23] talking, there's going to be three and a
[1:53:25] half years of absolutely no rain. Could
[1:53:28] you imagine?
[1:53:28] That's it. No rain. Your rivers, our
[1:53:33] lake,
[1:53:35] which is a deep lake, which feeds the
[1:53:37] Colombia River,
[1:53:38] the Okanagan River, goes right down
[1:53:40] Washington. It feeds the Colombia River,
[1:53:43] and I'm sure other rivers feed it, too.
[1:53:45] But can you imagine three and a half
[1:53:47] years of absolutely no snow, no rain on
[1:53:49] this earth, what this earth will be
[1:53:51] like?
[1:53:53] You know what? You will come, you will,
[1:53:56] you will become the 51st state or
[1:53:58] province of Canada just so you can have
[1:54:01] some drinking water.
[1:54:02] Yeah.
[1:54:05] Somebody should write Trump a letter
[1:54:08] and tell him it's best for him to join
[1:54:10] Canada.
[1:54:14] I'll tell you
[1:54:15] that's the truth.
[1:54:16] Maybe he should send us a recording of
[1:54:18] this service to him,
[1:54:22] but he might arrest me. Don't do it till
[1:54:24] I'm back.
[1:54:28] Have we come to the parting of the
[1:54:29] Jordan? You know, we are there.
[1:54:31] Amen.
[1:54:31] We're come to the parting. We are so
[1:54:33] close to the end time.
[1:54:35] You know what? Don't be frightened. Just
[1:54:38] say, "Lord, here I am."
[1:54:39] Amen.
[1:54:39] I I just want you to to take me over. I
[1:54:42] just want you to change my life. I want
[1:54:44] you to change my heart. I just If you
[1:54:47] really sincerely tell him that, I'll
[1:54:49] tell you what, he'll come this
[1:54:50] afternoon. He'll come right now. and
[1:54:53] he'll change your life forever. He'll
[1:54:54] change your life forever. That's all it
[1:54:56] takes.
[1:54:58] It don't take, you know, going to
[1:55:00] Jeffersonville or doesn't take going to
[1:55:02] Cloverdale or or to Donnie Regans or or
[1:55:06] to Puitz or or Brother Puitz or or
[1:55:09] anywhere or coming up to Jonah's that
[1:55:11] but just here right now, humble your
[1:55:14] heart. Say, "Lord, I want a change in my
[1:55:16] life. I want the victory. I want the
[1:55:19] word in me to be won. I want Jesus
[1:55:22] Christ in me and only Jesus.
[1:55:26] Amen.
[1:55:27] Amen.
[1:55:30] Amen.
[1:55:31] In the message who is M uh Melchzdc
[1:55:35] when this body receives the spirit of
[1:55:37] God. He says paragraph 71 the immortal
[1:55:41] life inside of you it throws this body
[1:55:44] in subjection to God. Exactly.
[1:55:47] You see, when you receive
[1:55:50] the spirit of God,
[1:55:51] Amen.
[1:55:52] then your body becomes subject to God.
[1:55:55] Then you become a vessel of honor, a
[1:55:58] vessel of obedience.
[1:56:00] Yes.
[1:56:01] Amen.
[1:56:02] A vessel living for the Lord. Not
[1:56:03] nobody. You're not interested in what's
[1:56:06] going on
[1:56:08] in the world. You're interested in
[1:56:09] Christ.
[1:56:10] Amen.
[1:56:10] And I love it. He says, "He that's born
[1:56:13] of God doth not commit sin." Yeah.
[1:56:16] There's no unbelief in you anymore.
[1:56:18] Amen.
[1:56:19] Amen. That's right.
[1:56:20] He cannot sin.
[1:56:21] That's right.
[1:56:22] There is therefore now no condemnation.
[1:56:24] See, you're not condemned.
[1:56:26] Amen. That's right.
[1:56:27] In Christ Jesus, they walk not after the
[1:56:30] flesh, but after the spirit.
[1:56:32] There you are. See, that throws your
[1:56:34] body subject to God.
[1:56:37] We are coming to a time.
[1:56:40] It is a gathering time that tears the
[1:56:42] world council of churches are being
[1:56:44] united. We're being united by the love
[1:56:47] of God.
[1:56:48] Amen.
[1:56:49] To become the word.
[1:56:53] Amen.
[1:56:54] You know what? I'm going to go right to
[1:56:57] the end now.
[1:57:00] I think I put enough hay out.
[1:57:05] You know, there's a joke that goes uh
[1:57:09] went to church and
[1:57:12] the pre preacher sees only one man made
[1:57:14] it to church. So he gets up and he
[1:57:17] preaches an hour and a half and he says
[1:57:20] to the man, he says, "Uh,
[1:57:23] what do you think?" And the farmer says,
[1:57:24] "Well, I'm a farmer." He said, "If it to
[1:57:28] go to the field, there's only one cow.
[1:57:29] There's no use putting the whole load."
[1:57:32] He said the whole Lord for one cow. He
[1:57:37] says he says, you know, you got to use
[1:57:40] your sense. And so I'm going to I'm
[1:57:44] going to close there with just this last
[1:57:45] statement. And I I tell you what, it's
[1:57:47] been I've really felt the liberty of the
[1:57:50] Lord here this this morning.
[1:57:52] And you know, he can help you.
[1:57:55] He can help you. He He He wants to unite
[1:57:58] with you, you know, because he's chosen
[1:58:00] you as his bride.
[1:58:02] You know, when when when when I met my
[1:58:04] wife, she knew that I wanted her. I knew
[1:58:07] I wanted her. And it was a uniting.
[1:58:09] Amen.
[1:58:10] You know, and it and we've been together
[1:58:11] for 42 years this October. 42 years.
[1:58:14] Yes.
[1:58:15] And I know there's some that have been
[1:58:16] longer, but but you know what kept us?
[1:58:19] The love.
[1:58:20] Amen.
[1:58:20] The love kept us. Love. Like there's
[1:58:22] times I'll tell you, we were passionate.
[1:58:26] I always told my kids, "Your mom and dad
[1:58:29] aren't arguing, they're just
[1:58:30] passionate."
[1:58:30] That's right. Well, I'm telling her I'm
[1:58:32] telling her my idea. She's telling me
[1:58:34] her idea. And we don't see it quite that
[1:58:36] way. But it's passion.
[1:58:40] But 42 years later, we're still
[1:58:42] together.
[1:58:44] And praise the Lord.
[1:58:46] You know, but that's even with us and
[1:58:48] God sometimes, you know, we we we we
[1:58:50] complain to him, but we should never
[1:58:52] complain because he's got our best
[1:58:54] interest in in at heart all the time,
[1:58:57] you know.
[1:58:59] He said, "Everything works out for those
[1:59:02] who love the Lord."
[1:59:03] That's it.
[1:59:04] Just love him.
[1:59:05] Amen.
[1:59:05] You know, she loved me for 42 years and
[1:59:07] it's worked out for us.
[1:59:09] And that's the way it is. We We got You
[1:59:11] got to have the love of God. It'll work
[1:59:13] out for you. Love him. and say, "Lord, I
[1:59:16] I don't know what brother Jonah preached
[1:59:17] today, but but give me
[1:59:20] your word in me that we would unite,
[1:59:22] that we would be one, that we would
[1:59:24] all that I only thing that only thought
[1:59:27] I would have is Lord, am I obedient? Am
[1:59:30] I pleasing to you?" And I'll tell you,
[1:59:32] wake up one day like Enoch did
[1:59:35] in heaven.
[1:59:36] That's right.
[1:59:36] Cuz you know what? You kept your eyes on
[1:59:38] him. If you love him, you keep your eyes
[1:59:40] on him. Your focus is on him. And when
[1:59:42] he appears, you'll appear with him. Yes.
[1:59:44] That's that's our desire.
[1:59:46] Yes. Amen.
[1:59:47] So the Lord wants to enter into his
[1:59:49] bride. He wants her to be him
[1:59:52] and to do his will in all she does.
[1:59:54] Amen.
[1:59:54] You know, totally pleasing unto him.
[1:59:57] Just as Enoch never was seen again, for
[1:59:59] he just walked into the presence of the
[2:00:01] Lord. We also will just be taken united
[2:00:04] with those that have gone before us in
[2:00:06] the air. What a glorious day that will
[2:00:08] be. I'll tell you, I'm looking forward
[2:00:10] to it. The worldly church will say,
[2:00:12] "Wasn't Elijah first to come?" And what
[2:00:15] did Jesus tell them? He already came and
[2:00:17] you didn't see it.
[2:00:18] You didn't receive it. Because you know
[2:00:20] what? When Elijah comes, he told them.
[2:00:24] It's not denominationalism.
[2:00:26] It's not doing what your pastor says,
[2:00:28] doing what the word says.
[2:00:30] That's it.
[2:00:30] You see, that's that's the key.
[2:00:32] That's exactly.
[2:00:33] It's doing what the word says. What God
[2:00:35] said is what's important. Amen.
[2:00:37] Hey.
[2:00:38] And Jesus said he's already come.
[2:00:41] You just didn't recognize him in the
[2:00:43] season
[2:00:44] you're in. So, have you recognized him?
[2:00:46] Yes, sir.
[2:00:47] I'll tell you what. I want I want
[2:00:52] to be recognized as one of his.
[2:00:55] Amen, sir.
[2:00:56] I want to be recognized as Jesus Christ
[2:00:58] in skin to the world. Two fellow
[2:01:01] believers.
[2:01:02] Exactly.
[2:01:02] You know what? I I I remember my
[2:01:04] parents, you know, uh we came at a place
[2:01:07] and there was always it seems there was
[2:01:09] I I was raised in a household and that
[2:01:12] they were Holy Ghost fililled parents
[2:01:16] and it seemed there was always trouble
[2:01:20] in church.
[2:01:25] And why was there always trouble?
[2:01:27] Because my dad never stood for anything
[2:01:30] but what the word said.
[2:01:32] Amen.
[2:01:34] And you know the devil loves it when you
[2:01:38] start a church and then he wants to come
[2:01:40] in and he wants to tell you how to do
[2:01:41] it.
[2:01:43] That's right.
[2:01:44] And then people would always, nope,
[2:01:46] can't do that. I'm out of here. You put
[2:01:48] those books in the back there. We don't
[2:01:49] want to have anything to do with this
[2:01:51] church. Well, they're staying back there
[2:01:53] because that's the truth. Amen.
[2:01:56] Away they went.
[2:01:57] Amen.
[2:01:58] You know, but there was always trouble.
[2:01:59] And I always thought, well, how can that
[2:02:01] be? We're supposed to be Christians.
[2:02:03] We're supposed to But you know what?
[2:02:04] Where the love of where the word of God
[2:02:06] is preached, the devil doesn't like it.
[2:02:09] No, he doesn't.
[2:02:10] He does not like the word of God because
[2:02:14] it it exposes him.
[2:02:16] Amen.
[2:02:16] See, the word of God exposes you. The
[2:02:18] love of God draws you in and delivers
[2:02:22] you, but it'll expose your your your
[2:02:26] heart, your life, your your your you
[2:02:29] know, it it it hopefully it preached to
[2:02:31] you today that you say, "Lord, I want to
[2:02:34] be united with the Lord."
[2:02:35] That's right. Exactly.
[2:02:36] And you know what? I was going to sing
[2:02:39] that song. It's manifesting time at the
[2:02:41] end.
[2:02:45] I'm going to pick another one.
[2:02:48] How about do you know this song? And and
[2:02:50] my wife said to make sure I ask before
[2:02:52] so we don't break the spirit. But do you
[2:02:55] know time clock is striking the hour?
[2:02:59] No.
[2:03:01] You know that one art? No. Okay. Well,
[2:03:05] we won't sing that one.
[2:03:07] I'm not good at solo.
[2:03:12] You know what? Can, brother Art, would
[2:03:14] you mind playing that signature course
[2:03:16] of yours one more time?
[2:03:19] I hope you don't mind me asking him to
[2:03:21] come up and doing that. The penis,
[2:03:23] you're you got a very nice piano.
[2:03:26] Yeah, it's beautiful.
[2:03:28] And you got a nice congregation. But
[2:03:30] let's just pray before we sing that
[2:03:32] chorus as Art plays it a little bit. Uh
[2:03:35] let's just pray. Let's stand and pray.
[2:03:39] Lord, we thank you that we could come
[2:03:41] into your place and just
[2:03:45] speak about you, Lord.
[2:03:47] Yes.
[2:03:48] Lord, you know every heart here today
[2:03:50] this morning.
[2:03:52] You know the thoughts of every
[2:03:54] individual. You know the need of every
[2:03:56] heart, Lord. And I know, Lord, if if if
[2:04:00] I spoke according to the spirit of the
[2:04:02] Lord, that it would have touched the
[2:04:04] very need. Because Lord, if we came
[2:04:06] expecting you to speak to us, you spoke
[2:04:09] to us.
[2:04:10] Amen.
[2:04:10] Lord.
[2:04:11] Amen.
[2:04:12] Keep us in unity. Keep us in fellowship.
[2:04:16] And may the love of God touch every
[2:04:19] heart here today. May it speak to those
[2:04:21] that that need deliverance, salvation,
[2:04:24] healing, whatever the need is. Lord,
[2:04:26] speak to the hearts. And Lord, we just
[2:04:29] give you the glory, praise, and honor. I
[2:04:31] thank you for this time that we could
[2:04:33] have together with the saints of God.
[2:04:34] Lord, I know that someday we'll meet up
[2:04:37] there and we'll talk about Lord, how
[2:04:40] good you were to us
[2:04:41] and we'll sing Amazing Grace. Like
[2:04:44] brother Brandham said, I'll make it up
[2:04:46] there. You'll hear me in that little
[2:04:47] cabin singing Amazing Grace. Lord, I
[2:04:50] will be singing Amazing Grace. How sweet
[2:04:52] the sound. Thank you, Lord, and for your
[2:04:55] victory and for your presence. In Jesus'
[2:04:58] name we pray. Amen.

[2:05:10] Sometimes a troubled sea.
[2:05:16] Sometimes it takes a wizard
[2:05:22] to get a hold of me.
[2:05:28] Love is so much more
[2:05:33] than whatever troubles me.
[2:05:40] Sometimes it takes a moment
[2:05:45] to get through and believe.
[2:05:48] One more time. Let's sing it one more
[2:05:50] time. Sometimes it takes a mount.
[2:06:02] Sometimes

[2:09:40] life in it.

[2:11:55] of love.
[2:11:59] For I have nothing.
[2:12:03] I am nothing
[2:12:08] without you.

[2:16:25] Truly a manifested word in this hour.
[2:16:28] Why couldn't she be deceived? She's the
[2:16:31] word. Amen. Thank the Lord. Let's bow

[2:16:36] father,
[2:16:38] it's so good to call you our father.
[2:16:40] Amen.
[2:16:41] Not by some mental conception, but by a
[2:16:44] true revelation of yourself in us. That
[2:16:48] true birth of Jesus Christ in us.
[2:16:53] Lord, we're so thankful that the word
[2:16:55] has become not a a letter. It's become
[2:16:59] your mind expressed.
[2:17:01] We were in that mind living, existing in
[2:17:04] you, made manifest for this hour,
[2:17:07] not for our glory,
[2:17:09] but for your glory and purpose.
[2:17:12] We're so thankful to bees,
[2:17:14] Lord, to be able to see ourselves and
[2:17:16] see yourself personalizing yourself to
[2:17:19] us.
[2:17:20] Yes, Lord.
[2:17:21] Lord, to know that our life is not our
[2:17:24] own. Our life to live is Christ.
[2:17:26] Amen.
[2:17:27] And die is gain.
[2:17:28] Thank you, Jesus. We are so thankful for
[2:17:31] the truth, Lord.
[2:17:33] The truth spoken,
[2:17:34] the truth lived.
[2:17:36] Yes, Lord.
[2:17:37] Lord Jesus, what an hour
[2:17:40] we have, Lord. What an hour
[2:17:42] to see you, to to know you.
[2:17:45] Thank you.
[2:17:46] Where your mind has been poured out,
[2:17:48] your mystery has been ex revealed. And
[2:17:50] then Lord, we say here we are,
[2:17:53] your thoughts expressed.
[2:17:57] Lord, we thank you for this opportunity.
[2:18:00] We thank you for the songs, the specials
[2:18:02] to see a brother that I saw at 16 years
[2:18:05] old, Brother Art. Lord, I I just think
[2:18:08] what time has passed

[2:18:42] the spiritual food that we've that we
[2:18:45] just cannot seem to have a capacity
[2:18:47] enough to receive it. Lord, I just need
[2:18:50] more and more. And we know we're on our
[2:18:53] way,
[2:18:54] little by little, step by step.

[2:19:09] Lord, we thank you for your mercy now as
[2:19:11] we partake of the food that's being
[2:19:13] prepared for us. Lord,
