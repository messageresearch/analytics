work in technology when you set up a trust relation relationship between two servers or whatever it doesn't matter anymore come what may once that relationship is set anything that goes between those two servers is trusted so you know it doesn't matter if what the other server understands what it sees what it feels it doesn't matter I I hope you understand what I'm trying to say but once that trust relationship is set come what may it does not matter what information has passed between there it trusts it 100% it says this is validated this is certified do you trust him this morning

the word weight in that there's different weights there's to T or wait there's to wait as lie in Ambush and the way that the scripture uses here is to bind together to bind together think about that Amen to bind together with the Lord they that wait upon the Lord those that bind together with the Lord amen Allelujah I think that's wonderful I think it's beautiful hallelujah amen amen number 114 I just after Brother Paul's sermon on Wednesday night I just couldn't help but sing this song create in me a clean heart is that your prayer this morning is that your plea this morning Lord take everything that's not of you out of me Lord God create in me a clean heart renew right Spirit Hallelujah let's stand create in me a clean heart oh God [Music] and renew a right Spirit within me create in me a [Music] clean oh God renew a right Spirit Within in [Music] me cast me not away from my presence oh long and take not thy whole Spirit from me Resto For unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right Spirit within [Music] me create in me a clean heart [Music] oh God renew a right Spirit within me create in me a clean heart oh God [Music] and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence oh God take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and right within me I believe that is something we can claim no matter what circumstance surrounds us no matter where we're at and um it's there that we it's there that we can give praise to the Lord at any time any place under any circumstance saying thank you Lord for your grace for your mercy for your kindness to us amen and uh so um interesting my [Music] okay you know I love technology makes life so convenient and at the same time I don't like to use the word hate but um um you know technology is for some of you very natural for me is not very natural at all Amen Let remember our sister Sophie is she is away amen I want to speak to you today I find it remarkable that the songs today's uh at least two of the songs are speaking of eagles and we'll touch a little bit on that today it just uh did my heart good thank you musicians beautiful amen uh Revelations uh the third chapter starting with the 14th verse to the 22nd verse and um in this we want to use this as a reference we'll go back and and uh uh tie this this is all referenced into the church age book and um uh just trust that it blesses you today amen Revelations 3:14 through 22 and un the angel of the Church of the Leo Deans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor and blind and naked I counsel thee buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint mine eyes with isav that thou mayest see my as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches Heavenly Father we have come today Lord some not with us we just ask father that your Holy Spirit would be with them today Lord touch each and every life Lord we ask you let the word just uh speak deep in our spirit father deep in our hearts that father today we would recognize how privileged we are and what a blessing it is father to be amongst your chosen father we don't want to take that lightly we don't want to make it common father we want to lift it up each and every day father as one of the great blessings that you have poured out upon us bless this time together bless the Saints their needs their circumstance their family father most of all the opening of the word to them in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen as we're looking at this I I want to uh kind of put this in the sense that uh touching every Church age Revelation 2 and three uh I I chose to go ahead and just take my thought or the foundation of my thought from Revelations 3 it is our age it is the time that we are living in and it would be the one that we could relate the closest to as we are literally living these scriptures right here and um as we look at this we see that this pattern is through all of the church ages all seven Church ages U the word identifies the age and then it identifies the condition of the age in other words we can look right here in Revelations 2 and recognize the spiritual atmosphere of every Church age from just what's right here in Revelation so it's there that we don't have to let it be a mystery to us we we have the ability to look back and because of our current experience in this day we can look back and say okay when it says this and it says the Deeds of the nicians and all of this we we see it very very readily it's very open to us and so he identifies the age he identifies the condition of the age and the word always identifies the people of the age and and this uh it'll be quite far down in the sermon here that will kind of come in this identification of the people just a little snippet of what the prophet said I think fits it perfectly it also identifies the Judgment of the age and uh as we'll look down through Revelations 2 and three we'll we'll see that every Church age has a a judgment that's been promised to them but it also has a reward that has been promised to them and so you all depends on what part of it you want to read my brother and sister I think that we don't ignore what the judgment is but we are looking at what the reward is amen just as the prophet of God said you know one man walks out of church and says he called me a buzzard he's looking at judgment another man walks out of church and says you know what he called me a saint uh he called me redeemed he called me the bride and and it's all how you look at the word and where you want to identify with that and so as we we uh identify the reward of the age uh it's very clear in every Church age amen then he gives a strong uh admonition at the end to hear what the spirit saith unto the church and so I put it in these words to hear what the spirit is saying in that age amen what is the word for the day amen and so we'll look at this and and uh we we'll follow this very carefully uh it starts off in the church ages there of Paul and and he is then the messenger to Ephesus and irus is there to Samia and Martin is to pergamus and Columbia to thyrus Luther to Sardis Wesley to to Philadelphia brother brandham to Le oysa and as we'll look at that we'll see very clearly how that those men were so suited for the the age that God placed them in God didn't just randomly grab someone and put it there we'll look at uh these each one of these men had something to offer that actually set them apart it wasn't just that they were God's messenger but even in the very natural personality that they had what They carried it set them apart from those around them their contemporaries you might say and and Paul you know uh he he had some disagreements with the brothers right and and uh you know the bin uh those who follow that teaching you know they're proud of the fact that the bines called Paul and and questioned him so strongly they're proud of that but you see my brother and sister if Paul needed set in order for that day it was God that did it it was not some kind of counsel or movement or sect or whatever it was God who set it in order and so we look down in every one of these ages and and we'll see how that irus he come and brother brandham says you know irius actually kind of was a little bit of a compromiser that there was certain things that he backed up on do you think that was because irius wasn't called to the job you think that possibly Iranians didn't have courage enough or God knew exactly what he was doing to leave that door open for those spirits to express themselves and then we see how that Martin one of the greatest examples of him is to take his own sword and cut his own cloak and to share that that was the very nature that that he had it was the very uh uh dispensation that God was pouring out for a man that actually would have compassion upon those around him but he was packing a sword amen so you don't want to think about him just being some kind of well you know I just Mr Nice Guy no my brother and sister I believe that he knew how to use that sword in the appropriate time and place he did use that sword and pergamus being a very unique age uh uh very much a a conflict a time of conflict and you know then we see Columba coming in fyra and and how he he really was a very interesting man if you go back and just refresh your your history on him a very interesting man uh very smart uh very you might intellectual man to come and still it shows that we can be very intelligent uh uh and uh still God deal with us God knowing exactly what it is to come to us and thyra being I I in my own mind kind of put it as a transitional time we see thyra that age as being a time that there's a shifting and we'll touch on these things in just a second but it still fell under that Ox anointing there was still still a lot of persecution a lot of uh uh trouble in the land for the Believers and in the foot uh the tail I mean of that comes Luther who has a great Revelation that uh the just shall live by faith but we know that the just need just more than Faith amen you can have a natural Faith right that's you going out in the morning putting the key in the ignition and turning it we need more than that so in that time as Luther said you know the just shall live by faith uh he he was actually just putting a key brother Bram puts it this way he was just putting a key in and unlocking something greater to come you see up to that point my brother and sister what had been Faith with with the Apostle Paul and uh those had slowly faded away they left their first love and they were cooling down and yet God comes along now and says you know what I'm going to put the key back in the lock and we're going to unlock this so that in future Generations my word can start to be completely uh revealed or unfolded to the people and so as Luther is there in Sardis uh a very you know outwardly uh Brave man but you know um I mean we kind of frown on drinking beer so there was some things you could find fault with him by modern standards but for that day he was on The Cutting Edge of Revelation and so we have to realize that in every age uh God is using that then Wesley comes along the Philadelphia age uh it it's a time of a great explosion of the word and how that it was just being opened up and the printing of the Bible and and uh the Zeal that uh brought the word or spread the word through the Nations and and amongst the people and so Philadelphia a great time and it's very easy if you'll sit and study it's very easy to see why it was hard for people to to shed the atmosphere of the Philadelphian anointing it was a great time of great expectation of word and you might say intellectual in a good sense intellectual approach to the word and and it had quite quite an influence the word being brought forth many things starting to be revealed and then we come out of that into the leodan church age and I just want to put this out to you not one of these Messengers was readily accepted in his day there was always a fault to be found as the word moved forward every age that preceded it looked at the new word coming forth revelation coming forth and found criticism with it they said now what do you mean just shall live by faith you go to church you do this you do that you pack your Rosary you do your indulgences you do all this what do you mean the just shall live by faith and they criticize that and it's been every age and sometimes even through history we'll see how that even amongst the The Messengers and the people ministers you might say of the day you you know Peter didn't always agree with Paul they had kind of a kind of a a little bit of of friction you might say between them but was uh Paul wrong was Peter wrong no it was God bringing his word right in line and fine-tuning or honing it and so as we'll come out of the Philadelphia age where manc come in such an intellectual approach to the word it was very hard for them to move from intellectual in other words the mind of man grasping and breaking it down so many scholars of that day learning the ancient text the ancient language because they believed that's what it would take to understand but we move into the leodan age and a prophet comes and says you in your studies in your uh your uh um schooling in your intellectualism will never figure out God this is the day of Revelation this is the day as the eagle anointing has come down and and the eagle my brother and sister the eagle does not have to go and research if it can fly it does not have to stop and say now if I get too high what will happen if I choose to fly low what will happen if I fly here and fly there what will happen the eagle it's born in them amen so they are not there my brother and sister by an intellectual concept we have the tree there in the yard and every year there is there is whatever you call it uh uh red tail hawk they live there and we get to watch this whole transition sometimes just uh in the springtime it just uh very blustery very cold windy uh hail rain and you'll see and now I I don't remember if it's the male or female that sits on the nest predominantly But whichever one it is my brother and sister you can see them up there the wind blowing so hard they're being battered but they know that their future lies in the Revelation and they know as it would be the principle God gave to Sons and Daughters of God we've been given our children amen and they're willing to set through thick and thin the hard times the easy times the sunny times because there's there uh we've got to watch these little fledglings be be hatched and see them chirp chirp and their little heads barely poking out of the nest and we see them as they trans you know transition into the these full-size Birds but they can't fly and now they're on the edge of the nest they've got their little claws sunk in there they've got their wings out and they they look like they they have no equilibrium because they're flapping their wings and almost falling this way and falling that way but then you see something's coming into them called maturity and there comes a day that literally uh you know you'll see them on the ground and you're thinking oh my it fell out of the nest but as you would walk closer to it you'll see it look at you with a sharp eye and hop up in the air and fly now we didn't see any um well we have drivers training right amen sister Vias graduated to the road and uh brother Sergey sister ulie are now the instructors or the terrified but there's you don't see a a hawk trainer showing up saying this is how you learn how to fly there's something changing in them day by day something that they are recognizing saying I am an eagle or a hawk whatever we'll prefer the eagle and it just comes to them they put their wings out Revelation comes to them These Wings weren't for us to just beat around the nest in these These Wings were given to us to fly they get to watch the example of their parents they get to watch those around them and it clicks one day aren't you glad it clicks one day amen that it's no longer brother bram's Revelation it's no longer this brother that brother's Revelation it's no longer the pastor's Revelation it's no longer Mom or Dad's Revelation it's your Revelation amen something clicks inside that God is real and I'm going to serve him and we're not going to get sidetracked on what happens amen many times we see it the ones we hold up too high as examples God allows them to make mistakes and fail so that we will get our eyes off of them and get them on him amen so our our view should be just simply upon Christ now I I want to come back and revisit this of the church ages here now how many of you would just love to have been as bold as a lion amen come on Saints just to be bold like a lion to go out in the face of the opposition and this is the word of the hour this is what God Said but you also have to remember in that day being as bold as a lion there were certain attributes of that day that you also had to deal with I want to be bold as a lion I don't want to have to deal with the rest are you with me amen so they were bold as a lion in that day you know the Apostle Paul he tells us all that happened he's been beaten Thrice he's been thrown in prison he's been starved he's me all of these things that has happened and if that's what it takes to get boldness that suddenly tempers are thought about being bold and God transitioned right out of being bold as a lion into another anointing and that was the off anointing and that one my brother and sister let's be honest with us this morning that one doesn't sound nearly as exciting if you're going to beat me I'm just going to bear with it if you're going to M mistreat us you're going to do all of this we we're just going to hunker down and we're just going to take it well I tell you there's something I I don't know if I should use myself for an example it's not a great example but I'm telling you my brother and sister in a great portion of humanity when someone comes to misuse you abuse you mistreat you most men something Rises up inside of them and you're not going to do that to me but you see when God deals with a son of God or daughter of God and under the anointing he's got them under it doesn't matter what's going on out there God is anointing them and so in that day there was many a man many a family many a mother subjected themselves to the persecution of the day but yet if it had been without the Holy Ghost which in those days wasn't necessarily term to those people they didn't fully have a grasp of that but without the presence of God in their life they would have fought back like Warriors they would have rebelled they would have had blood on their hands but God anointed them that's not what I called you to do I called you to stand here and bear the reproach to stand here and bear it even at the sacrifice of your life that one doesn't sound quite as exciting as the lion does it and we move out of that anointing into the man age the intellectual time and my brother and sister it would be wonderful now I'm not debasing myself so don't misunderstand it'd be wonderful to us live in that intellectual age unless you're not intellect ual and if you're not the one that can dig into the deep things and explain things and do that suddenly you would kind of feel like you are the one left out but that was an age that they dug into the word and they were able in digging into the word unar nuggets you might say that that are profound even to you and I today we hold to them as as truths and it's there but you see it was manage but man man wasn't able to keep that in balance and man started to move into the position of look how smart we are look how we can learn this look how we can explain this look how we can you know learn the languages and and I listened to a guy sometime back and he was talking about oh they've now and they've now found another sub dialect uh uh and and we're we need to explore the text uh in that dialect to see if it brings more Revelation or understanding of the meaning and you're sitting there thinking okay that's wonderful I still haven't mastered English I I'm probably not going to move on Beyond English my brother and sister because I don't need to move Beyond English what I need is a revelation of what God is saying not what the words were saying the words their words what's God's words manifested to you and I God promised he would open it to us you see now I'm not saying we disregard God's word but you have to understand when they come along there's only a half a dozen different things in the Bible where they're saying we we don't know if that was spoke in Greek we don't know if it was Aramaic we don't know this we don't know because if it means this if it's spoke that way it means if it's spoke this way my brother and sister they'll never figure that one out because they're still trying to open the word in the manage and we're not living in the man age so the intellectual still got to send these guys uh away to theology to to uh all of these schools and they're trying to teach them and and I remember coming across a little deal where a man says I can spot instantly a man who has been uh to a Theological Seminary how they make a sermon how they speak how they pronounce their words it's obvious so this guy's questioning were they trained by God or were they trained by man he said the Apostle Paul was trained by God and he was just fine amen amen see it all went to the backside of the desert and got knocked out of him amen and then God filled him up and then he was effective with the gospel and we come into this stage here which just touched me in the song service amen we're in the eagle age hallelujah we're in the time my brother and sister that we're no longer hopping around in the chicken yard but we're able by God's grace just to catch that little draft of the moving of the Holy Spirit and and just rise up into Revelation and be able to see what they cannot see see further than they can see and understand more now that almost sounds arrogant I've been told before that that is an arrogant approach but I'm sorry my brother and sister if you see more than they see you didn't do it that was God in you that was God opening the word to you God making it alive shining the light on it no man in and of himself can you might say revelate himself he can educate himself but he can't revelate himself and so we're now in that age of Revelation and uh this is all coming in a culmination this has come into a culmination but until the plan of God is completely finished the culmination is still unfolding itself so you know you'll alternate now I just bear with me if you would how many of you have been bold amen you've been bold you've put it right out there straight this is what the word of God says this what God has done very bold and then there's times that we have just settled in and we are the ax amen we are bearing with this you know uh uh uh just uh individuals share with you you know people they have working or business relationships with they just batter them all the time you know you have to be an a cult it takes an ox not to respond to that now if you don't experience that it's a little hard maybe to understand that but if you are bombarded with you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong it takes an ox anointing not to crumble under that kind of pressure amen but we have come here today I hope every one of us that's of age can read and write amen we should be able to amen and it's good to come in this day in in this man anointing to be able to pick up our Bible be able to read our Bible be able to correlate be able to go over here in the message now pardon me I I'm not wanting to sound like a any kind of anti- anointing but my brother and sister you should not blindly follow we have the greatest message on Earth but does it tell you blindly follow no it tells you search the scripture does Amen we should be searching the scripture we should be finding for our own self this is where it's at this is where it's anchored this is why I have such confidence in the word of the hour is because it's right here anchored in my Bible amen now my brother and sister we shouldn't become cynics we shouldn't come to where we question everything that comes around us we should know enough of the word of God by our studies amen to be able to understand and do that a brother years ago preaching down in Arizona I loved his approach uh he he's preaching and he just stops and he says now I'm not going to read any quotes to you today because if you know the message you know I'm quoting the message to you amen now it's only those who have no idea what they believe or what they follow blindly that would be able to go I have to have quote page paragraph I have to have all this my brother and sister that's not going to save us amen it's when the word becomes living to you and I when the word comes alive that we know what God is speaking we've read it we've heard it we've spoke it we've prayed over it amen we've sang about it we've testified of it and when those things come real to us and you hear it spoken you know it's the truth now my brother and sister I don't say this entirely in the natural but I tell you if you come and you have studyed the message like you should studied your Bible like you should and then you get an anointing of the Holy Spirit on top of that there's something in you that Rings true back to the back to the little tuning Forks amen anything added to that tuning fork changes its tune anything added to the word changes the word amen and when you know the word you'll know amen but if you're blindly following there's where the Deception comes you don't know and I say this kind of funny because even even as we're talking about this everybody says Paul you sing an F that's good I don't know what f is but I do know where I sing so if where I sing an F match then I guess I sing an F but my mind doesn't say Now sing an F my mind says Make a Joyful Noise and and I do my best to make the Joyful Noise whether it's an f a d a g or whatever it might be we could just put the whole alphabet out there amen now I'm telling you I say this humorously sometimes when our musicians are playing and brother Paul starts singing at the end of the service I know I'm not in any known key to man I've seen sister via look up kind of roll her eye like what is this but you see whatever it is God corrects that or sometimes our piano players correct that but you get the point amen so that's what we're doing we're searching for absolute truth because we don't want to create our own I don't want to I don't want to you know think that I've got Revelation to rewrite music amen now look at the culmination of the ages you are every one of these spirits brought down in this day every one of the attributes of those ages is right here today and every one of those Natures amen a lion an ox a man an eagle every bit of that lays in you today and you'll find yourself if you don't really understand you'll find yourself almost in a paradox cuz one day you'll be so bold and the next day you've turned into an ox one day you'll understand the word written words and the next something will come to you that is so real you know it's the truth and you don't even know where to go to prove it because that is in you that Spirit of the age all come together every one of these manifested in you I haven't put you to sleep yet have I okay let's go here in the 70th week of Daniel if you have not read amen uh these I I would encourage you to go read about 70 weeks of Daniel now we find out in this age there's a star as we have there we have a Star Messenger we have a person a message that goes forth to the age a people to reject it a people to receive it now if in the age there is this group of people that been sent forth my brother and sister if they're anointed to reject it can you change them you're still required to live it in front of them right none of this well I'll just be whatever because they're heathens anyhow no you're still required to live it in front of them but you must realize many of these people will never be able to receive it they're called they're under an anointing to reject it but I tell you what I like the fact that brother brandham put second place right there there's also a people in the land today that has been called to receive this amen I don't care how Wicked the world out here gets and everything that we see my brother and sister oh our nation falling apart of course it is the scripture has to be fulfilled amen the the whole nation the world you look at this go study in the message brother Bram doesn't say positive thing about the United Nations that was all the way back then that it was established for a purpose and that purpose is now being fulfilled and so you'll see it the people that are here that we care about the most as it were that doesn't really sound too right does it the ones we focus on the most are those that are here to receive it amen you see the movements where where people I just watched one in England the poor preacher got beat up amen he's out on a street corner and he's calling out these people telling them you're a sinner it's obvious how do you know I'm a sinner just look at you what you've done to your own body and look where you stand and what you protest for or against your unbeliever they ended up just beating the poor guy I feel sorry for him but you see now if God ordained that so be it but you see what he was doing was trying to preach the gospel to people not able to receive it so he had put the Pearl this sounds rough before a whole herd of swine and expected someone there to see the value of it but if it's not in them to see the value they'll never see the value and the scripture says don't cast your Pearl before the swine H amen the word is speaking my brother sister can someone agree with that amen the word is speaking in this hour amen it's not dried up Amen in fact it's getting condensed down it's more powerful than ever before and there's a called out people in the land that are hearing and I love that because when you think about what is going on in our world today where where it seems like uh I I just was listening to uh a little bit of um a sermon brother Ron Spencer preached up at the the camp I think brother Sergey sister Julia probably were there and and uh I I love the humor that brother Ron uh brought out cuz he said now uh there were these three brothers that could not receive the word of here I stand of believe the sign they just couldn't read receive it wasn't in them to receive it now he put that because he brought it into this day issues of this day then he reverts back to speaking about Shadrach mesach and Abednego but my brother and sister you look at this and just realize that there's no ability in you to believe the devil's message that ought to give us something to say Thank You Lord at the top of our voice there's no ability in me to even receive the Gospel of leoda Amen the word of the hour of leoda nothing in me to even take a halt of that and say maybe maybe not amen there's something in us that says this is not the original word this is not God speaking this is not God's language amen and it's not producing God's result amen I tell you I just get excited when I think about that amen it sounds a little boastful even message people sometimes stagger over the idea that you cannot fail you cannot fall amen you cannot turn back you say but but but but but no we're talking to real Believers amen we're not talking to churchgoers we're not talking to people that are just packing a Bible in a message book we're talking to those that know down in the depths of their soul that they were called before the foundation of the world to serve God and finish the race amen it's not for us to hope it's for us to know amen the Mysteries are finished we know who we are in Jesus Christ and if we don't we ought to stop and get real serious about sorting that out because if you don't know my brother and sister it can come so close the word says deceive the very elect thank you brother Trevor if come on let's say it together if it were possible amen but I tell you the devil can't make the impossible possible or the possible impossible amen he has no ability to establish the word in the heart of the believer he can establish the word in the heart of the people who are anointed to reject it but my brother and sister he cannot establish the word in the heart of the people that God said they are there predestinated to receive it oh thank you Lord so you know we have the parable of the SE amen this not the same in the soul my brother and sister of Sons and Daughters of God the devil's not going to come in and plant a seed that causes you to fall away that's why we're sealed by the holy spirit amen that's why it's got to be a personal relationship now my brother and sister when you think about that you think about how personal that is is it's not just we we've preached back and forth here in the church about the Holy Ghost and being anointed of the Holy Ghost man be anointed of the Holy Ghost all the days of his life still go to hell that's because it never became personal to him he had an intellectual understanding of the moving of the Holy Spirit and the anointing on the Holy Spirit moved them yeah but it never sealed them amen you know a brother one time in a land that has lots of water asked me if you didn't have any water not enough to immerse someone to baptize them would sprinkling them or splashing them be sufficient and I I'm just like just walked out of a service in fact we ended up down in a baptism I didn't understand what it was but you see if the devil can get us to clip our sentence just leave a little of it out I asked the brother I said is this figuratively spiritual or natural he wasn't sure how to answer that so he just chose natural and I says then you haven't searched far enough cuz in China some of those countries no most of us wouldn't fit in a 55 gallon barrel amen but you know our dear little Chinese Brothers they just have you know this little Barrel right there and I wouldn't even dare try it but you know they just go to baptize them and they just like accordion upon themselves till the waters over their head and they're baptized I told that brother at that time I says if you can't find a water to baptize somebody you haven't traveled far enough you haven't searched hard enough amen see the devil wants to make it convenient the Lord wants it to be his word amen amen hallelujah so the word is speaking calling out a people a called out people's hearing it see what's building up my brother and sister I want to ask you just very direct this might not be the most inspired service ever did but it's what's on my heart today amen I tell you my brother and sister as you ever come to a place that that you just feel like something's building up amen you've heard the word preached I I love it I have to admit I love it when when you preach and after church people say I I just was reading that sermon or just listen to that sermon or just finished that book and what it tells me is that God is building up a people and it's not about the preacher it's about God coming down and meeting a specific need and building us up getting us into a position where we're able not just for the moment but to receive what he's got coming to us you see God's not living in history in fact when this sermon is over here in a little while it will be history and God is preparing you for what he's got for you for maybe later today or tomorrow or the day or the week or the month or the year after God is preparing you for that future because we're coming into a Time of complete maturity amen now Revelation unfolding aren't you glad how Revelation unfolds amen it's never us having 400 pages of notes and suddenly having a aha moment you can have your 400 pages of notes I don't care about that but when you think it's because you studied out all those notes is the reason you got that you've missed it amen it's when you recognize my brother and sister that God is preparing you for something greater amen and what our preparation is today I want to ask you the prophet of God said the Rapture should take place any time and we are 50 60 years beyond that does that mean we've missed the boat well what if I brought you a few preachers that believe you missed the boat would you accept that no way God's timing is perfect his word is perfect and his people to receive the word are perfect amen he didn't call in a bunch of it's a cattle term we call them lepes you know the cats that never Thrive they're always the rough-haired scrawny you know just don't do very good you know lepes he didn't call lepes my brother and sister he called the finest people people on the face of the Earth to be a part of the Bride those amen we might not be great intellectually or or physical or looks or strength or whatever it is but in God's eyes you are the greatest people on the face of the Earth filled with the word amen and the life that he has poured into you is bringing forth the selfsame seed that was poured in amen not another seed hallelujah amen see what happens I don't know how to word this quite I definitely know there was a stage in my life that this happened very regularly there would be a little question mark and I would ponder it and I would look for it maybe you heard a minister speak and maybe you didn't understand it you might even be able to get a cassette you guys know what that is right um and listen to it again and still you realize something's missing I'm not getting this and literally a period of time this is why my brother and sister the prophet of God told us that if you don't understand it you don't Chuck it away you put it up on the shelf and you let that then In God's Time be revealed to you and I'm speaking from personal experience there was times there was questions I had I couldn't I searched for an answer I couldn't find an answer and one day I'm sitting there I pick up a message book and it just kind of opens to a certain Page by accident by accident and I look down on the page and right there on the page is my answer that's right amen God's timing is perfect the season is perfect one I needed to desire the answer not for intellectual concept but a yearning and a hunger of the Soul saying Lord I want that question answered for my own Soul's sake Lord I want that answered and then God says okay you come the day is the day and he lays the right message book now I told sister Jerry I probably shouldn't say this in public I told sister Jerry I'm turning over a new Leaf church I'm turning over a new Leaf I told sister Jerry I'm putting all the message books around our house away and I'm just going to read them one at a time if I sit in that chair I got a message book for that chair if I sit on the couch I got a message book for the couch I hate to say this in public if I'm in the restroom I have a message book for the restroom and then I never know where did I read that and I'm I'm solving that I'm putting everything away and I'm just going to have one book I mean I'm working on putting everything away but you see my brother and sister it doesn't matter if there's 10 books in the house 10 tapes one in your car one in your other car one in your other car one in your bedroom one in your it doesn't matter when God wants to answer the question he put you in the word together amen it's not a man it's not a program it's God putting you and the word together hallelujah amen amen you see we'll look at this let me Focus just a little on the negative we see the spirits of the day we see what's going on out here um I'm not looking my brother and sister at the barroom or the dance hall that's not what we canare for that really fits to those that in many cases have already rejected there but look at this now I'm not saying that there's not people there still to be gleaned amen don't misunderstand me but you see when you look more of a Time piece of the world today is the condition of the Church saints what condition is Grace Tabernacle in it doesn't matter what the nazarenes or Baptists or methodists are doing what condition is Grace Tabernacle in what is what is going on what is the cycle of the word is the word barely alive is it on you know life support or is it vibrant living amen got strength and Power Authority but I'm going to throw this out to you I hope you don't understand amen you see it takes Revelation to understand the depths of the spirit today and that's on both sides when you look out here and you see what's happening in the world it's really easy to say well they don't have the message they don't have this they're you know unless they change their loss but you see we really need to understand what's happening with these people CU that coworker well can I share a real quick testimony a brother shared with me how that he worked with a man that just had a terrible mouth and it just grieved him just to have to listen to this guy sometimes and and one day he's there working and the guy just started speaking these things and they were so horrendous finally he just reached a point he says I didn't realize till later God had his hand in it but to me I just thought I had a temper tantrum come on H you know anybody ever had a temper tantrum you know yeah no no okay good good yeah and the guy actually worked across like a double desk or table thing from him and he said I just told him you need to shut your mouth that's nothing but the devil speaking and the guy was just like few days go by he said hey was you serious and he said I was serious when you talk like that that's nothing but the devil this man says well I don't want to serve the devil this brother talk about bold then don't what do I do about it well he said my wording could have been better he said come to church with me and that'll solve your problem afterwards he thought well it ain't my Church uh but guess what God allowed a man with a filthy mouth his life to be radically changed because someone was anointed with a lion anointing amen my imagine what it'd be like even amongst us if sometimes at the right time the lion anointing raised up I'm not talking about you sister Jerry but when that lion anointing Rises up instead of us saying well that just ain't right that should be if we just be like nope look that ain't according to the word I love you but face up to the fact that's not God speaking but we're all politically correct and we feel warm and fuzzy and we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but why don't we just go ahead and tie a ribbon around the quote where the prophet of God said paraphrased you cannot offend a son or daughter of God Amen well Hallelujah that's not us slapping their head off and embarrassing or shaming them but that would be us not taking the ox approach when we should be a lion [Music] yeah anyway I I want to stay focused I want to stay focus so you have to understand the depth and the moving of the Holy Spirit to understand the things of God but for you to have compassion and understanding on what's going on in our our I say our nation it's in the world you have to have an understanding of the depth of the evil that is out here that anointing the depth of that evil you need to have an understanding in Genesis 6 and fif six and five I mean amen God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually see so right here in in Genesis we're we're seeing that God was giving a a view for us to understand what is happening we're coming to an age my brother and sister I I don't want to go in politics but it just fits into the world we're living in almost everything it's been revealed in the last few years almost everything about our government is corrupt and if people are innocent when they go in they're corrupt when they come out amen and we get all wound up not all of us but some get wound up about that but I want to tell you all that is is a Time piece amen it has to come to this stage that God is looking at this present age the same as he looked here in Genesis 6 and5 amen and we're coming there we're coming there quickly amen But realize even these Wicked people it's not them it's anointing upon them now you have to take that same approach my brother and sister and when you come in your trial and you feel like that you have come short but you are still there and you get down and repent over what you see as this great tragedy a a misfortune of your failure and you'll realize that the very thing that is motivating them on one side amen as the can't believe it there is on the other side causing you to come right back causing you to say I can't quit I won't quit I believe this it changed my life I did come short I did fall down but I got back up again by the grace of God and I will not stay down I will get back up and I will say Lord forgive me and give me the strength to press on that's a bride's response my brother and sister not to call it quit not to say I'm a failure I would do this but I'm a failure that's not the bride's response the bride says there's blood Lord forgive me but there is blood that is covering me right now and that blood is just as fresh right now as it was at Calvary and it's just as powerful right now as it was at Calvary I don't have to go and mope and crawl in a cave and hope that someday God forgives me but when we get that Revelation that's when we become Victorious that's when we rise up and there's joy in our heart to serve God in every situation amen oh Hallelujah we have by God's grace oh let me put it this way I study things so weird sometimes I even think it's weird but you got the world today people coming into church they like their baggage they don't really want Deliverance what they want is the church to accept them as they are well I'll tell you come to church amen if you're sinning come to church amen you've probably seen the deal if you're drinking come to church if you're doing all these got a whole list of things come to church but expect God to change you amen see there's the whole thing but the devil twist this around I lied I can't go to church I did this I can't go to church I did that I can't go to chur church so you just find a church that will accept you as you are no that's not God's recipe amen see we have to understand when we understand the depths of sin this might seem a little weird to you to say you need to understand the depths of sin but when you understand the depths of sin then you understand the depths of God's grace in your life here today amen when you realize where you could have been without him and you see where you are with him it gives you Revelation to understand the depth of the love of Christ amen and when we understand that depth it changes the way our lives are amen now look at this would you guys agree with me today that the signs if if you well Jerry and I used to take a newspaper until it just become trash this been many years back and we just gave up on it so we all get a little news in some form or fashion some way right um and when you look at the end is is the end not upon us yes I mean you take a tour to Israel I don't know I think you guys was standing right there at that time when we was up on the top top world the cave was and the uh horse carved and the metal horse and all these other things and the stone feed troughs and yeah and we're standing up there and looking down in this Valley and the guid's like yep right there between that point and that point is the biblical spot of the battle of Armageddon not even a question whether it's going to be a battle of Armageddon or not they have scripturally figured out it's going to take place right here oh but that's way off in the future we don't have to worry about that well I'm not worried about it I'm going to be prepared for it though amen because I didn't put it in quotations are here today but I just read this morning the prophet of God said I won't go in the whole context but prophet of God says you don't have to worry about that kind of shocking in a way he says you don't have to worry about Seven Seals you don't have to worry about the vials you don't have to worry about all this stuff cuz you're not going to be here oh you mean I don't have to tie this one together with a little string to that one and know how this is all going to come out no my brother and sister we're not going to sit on a hill with our binoculars and Mark one up for those on the left mark one up for those on the right battle Armageddon boy this is interesting look how this is playing out no sir we'll be long gone fact I think I know where we'll be we'll be standing Before the Throne saying oh Lord how we love you how we thank you Father you Grace your mercy your kindness to us oh in case you guys don't know I uh forgot my wrist watch this morning it's almost a perfect excuse let me cut through a little of this the prophet of God shows us very clearly that actually the messenger to the age comes at the end of the age now we can get into all kinds of things and and prove them we can say well okay we've moved from age to age right we're no longer in leoda you realize Sons and Daughters of God sealed with the Holy Ghost are no longer the victims of leoda Amen they're in the bride's Revival the bride's age they're in the presence we're in the presence of the sun getting all of that baked out of us amen we could probably start a Doctrine the baking but it's true Saints we're here come on think about this now I don't want to get too personal with you but how many of you feel like you made a mistake this last week and some of you know you made a mistake this last week yeah we won't go into detail sister Carrie sister car's going to pull her notebook up here in a minute and then the rest of us going to borrow it from her and say I got to put my page in there too but you see my brother and sister knowing we made a mistake is one thing knowing how we fixed and I say that past tense because it should be fixed how we fixed it is a greater Revelation than knowing how you made it that's right because without fixing it you have a problem but fixing it the problem is solved now those of you going through great trials you don't feel like it's fixed those of you that that you know things of the minds things of emotion things of finance things of children things of marriage all of these things you don't feel like it's fixed but I'm here to tell you when you gave it to Christ it's fixed it's fixed you don't look for a solution you look for the results amen if if he said it it's finished amen amen now look you know we see that he knocked on the door and what did you do opened it see that's what's separating the bride from the rest of the world have you guys ever ever done something like this you just live life houses were meant to be lived in right but they're never clean enough when the doorbell rings never so where do you put all that stuff anywhere that's out of sight is good enough vacuum cleaner behind the door in the laundry room how come we can't open the door in the laundry room the vacuum cleaner lives there now papers they go in the stool in the middle of the living room raise the lid that's the anointing of the age no one wants to deal with their housekeeping they want to find an alternate place to put it the bride her response I've got only one place I can put this and that is under the blood amen that's the bride's response I want to cut out a little bit of this amen there's a few things you know Galatians 51 and John 8 and 36 uh you know talking about Liberty but I I want to just focus on this real quick and then we'll be finished you see Saints sometimes we have reoccurring things that happen in our life we get Victory and Satan shows up on Monday morning does his very best to steal that from you because he wants to keep you where you've been not where the word said you're going he wants to landlock you amen so I I encourage you and I'm speaking to Paul here amen get free amen we we look at this you know Galatians 5 uh I I just have to read it stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ is made us free and be not entangled again in the Yoke of bondage see this this is something that's a much stronger scripture than we give it credit for because when we come to the place that we are not entangled and we know that we are free that gives you the Liberty to step forward into the unknown when you have no Liberty my brother and sister you're not going to go out in the unknown come on amen John 8:36 if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed these are foundational scriptures that we need to get free enough and have confidence enough that your voice your voice starts to overpower negative thoughts amen when you stand and say you know what I'm a Son of God maybe thank God it's been a long time but have any of you ever I remember a situation many years ago somebody said something and the answer came out of me so fast I didn't even have brain cells to function on it it was just like no no it wasn't like that but what I answered was a lie how could it come out of us so quickly like they almost hadn't even finished speaking and we're speaking a lie you guys look awfully solemn am I out to lunch or am I too close to home no answer look my brother and sister beyond that your telephone will ring and somebody will say will you pray for me what kind of results can response can we give them no I can't pray for you I'm a liar oh that was inside our head wasn't it and Satan knows that and he sets the stage keep you bound but we're free the word says we're a free people let's live free let's act like we're free let's praise God like we're free amen worship like we're free my brother and sister take the promises of the word we're free we've been set free and we are not only free we're free indeed amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah I've got I've got quite a bit more but I want to just touch in Revelations 22 right here verse 10 because I want you to understand how protected we are as Sons and Daughters of God and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still amen I'm telling you I like the second half of verse 11 because we my brother and sister are righteous and we Are Holy and the word is telling us it will continue amen and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his Works shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter through the gates into the city so here once again just like it is in Revelations 2 and 3 he's giving us the reward he's telling us this is what I've got in store for you amen because he knew that we are not going to be filthy still amen he knew that we were going to be holy and he knew that we were going to be righteous and he's offered a great reward now look what's on the outside this out here my brother and sister that God has sealed you from we talk about being sealed oh I'm sealed with the Holy Spirit well you can put that to a natural tangible ceiling that is there to show you what he sealed you from are you with me amen amen so it's not just talk it's not just language or lingo that he's saying but he's he's pointing out for without our dogs and Sorcerers whoremongers and murderers and idolators and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star and this is the result of Liberty in the word amen this is the result of overcoming life and he says the spirit and you say come without that confidence of the word Saints without the right response what could we say could we testify of overcoming power when we have no Victory we testify of potential when we don't see it surprisingly enough you should then remind your body that it's supposed to obey your confession but the battle that's in the mind tells us I can't witness to that am maybe I've just I always jokingly say this but then I see the looks on people's faces and you realize it's true you know really hard to come to church and worship when you fought with the wife or husband all the way to church you know hard to walk in the door and praise God I feel like praising the Lord today you know down in South America brother down there brother Elias got a great sense of humor he told me one day he says ' brother Paul you know why the altar is so full on our church on Sunday mornings and I was like no I don't know brother he gets this little grin he goes they're repenting of everything that happened between their house and the church I'm like H maybe we need to implement something like that oh I wished I could afford to bring him here you guys would love him but we'd have to bring an interpreter and then we'd have to bring his wife and then his kids would need to come and for without her dogs Sorcerers whoremongers murderers idolators those that love making a lie see that's why God wants you to recognize the spirits of the day he wants you to see what is happening what influence is on you hm can I be bold and ask you guys this question how well are you recognizing the spirits on you oh I I include myself I think sometimes we don't do a very good job or else we wouldn't have some of these issues Lord help us to be able to come and say no wrong spirit not going there what you don't do is say wrong Spirit on you wife that don't work very well but sometimes it literally is about that obvious
