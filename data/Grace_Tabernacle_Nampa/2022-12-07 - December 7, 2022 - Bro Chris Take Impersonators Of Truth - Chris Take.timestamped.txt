[35:37] in our souls
[35:39] the rising of the Sun
[35:41] amen uh Second Timothy chapter three
[35:48] Timothy chapter three
[36:03] three
[36:08] second Timothy chapter 3 verse 1.
[36:12] this know also that in the last days
[36:14] perilous times shall come for men shall
[36:16] be lovers of their own selves Covetous
[36:18] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[36:21] to parents unthankful Unholy without
[36:24] natural affection truce Breakers false
[36:27] accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of
[36:30] those that are good traitors heady
[36:32] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[36:34] lovers of God
[36:35] you see my goodness these people must be
[36:39] you know heathens in the outward
[36:41] expression
[36:42] verse 5 having a form of godliness
[36:46] in other words they look the part of
[36:48] godliness
[36:50] but this is what their spirit is
[36:53] their spirit is
[36:56] they love themselves selfishness they're
[36:59] jealous
[37:00] their boast they proud that's their
[37:02] Spirit that's who they that's who they
[37:05] are on the inside but on the outside
[37:06] they have a form
[37:08] of godliness
[37:10] but denying the power thereof from such
[37:12] turn away so they don't they do
[37:14] everything but accept the power
[37:16] of Christ
[37:18] for of this sort are they which creep
[37:21] into houses and Lead captive silly women
[37:23] Laden with sins LED away with diverse
[37:25] lusts
[37:27] you can apply that
[37:28] naturally or spiritually the woman is
[37:31] always the church the church is always
[37:33] typed as a woman so you have
[37:37] these these men these leaders men women
[37:41] in thin churches
[37:43] but the form of godliness but leading
[37:46] people away leading the church away
[37:49] into diverse lusts of man's opinions of
[37:53] the word of God
[37:54] ever learning and never able to come to
[37:56] the knowledge of the truth so they're
[37:58] always reading they're always finding
[38:00] these quotes always finding all of the
[38:02] stuff but they never come to the truth
[38:05] amen what is the truth Christ amen now
[38:09] as Janice and jamboree's withstood Moses
[38:11] so did these also resist the truth so
[38:13] they're disruptors in the church they're
[38:15] causing problems in relationships all
[38:17] this kind of of thing this is the their
[38:20] behavior pattern their behavior pattern
[38:22] is being laid open for us to see
[38:24] but if it still takes Revelation for us
[38:27] to identify
[38:28] the spirit in the church so so do these
[38:31] also resist the truth men of corrupt
[38:32] Minds reprobate concerning the faith but
[38:35] they shall proceed no further remember
[38:37] the Sunday morning I said but it would
[38:39] seem impossible but
[38:42] they will proceed no further so they are
[38:45] blocked they cannot have the victory
[38:47] they will proceed no further for their
[38:49] fathers shall be manifest unto all men
[38:51] as theirs also was
[38:54] but thou has fully known my Doctrine
[38:56] manner of life purpose Faith
[38:58] long-suffering charity patience
[39:00] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[39:03] me at Antioch at Iconium at lystra which
[39:06] what persecutions I endured but out of
[39:08] them all the Lord delivered me yea and
[39:11] all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus
[39:13] shall suffer persecution
[39:16] it may not be persecution like the the
[39:20] Christians who hid in the catacombs and
[39:22] had to give their lives it's a it's a
[39:24] different but it's still persecution
[39:27] still persecution
[39:31] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[39:33] worse and worse deceiving and being
[39:35] deceived
[39:37] but continue thou so look it's going to
[39:40] get worse
[39:42] the evil man they're going to get worse
[39:44] and worse deceiving and being deceived
[39:47] themselves it's going to get worse he
[39:50] says but this is Paul speaking to
[39:52] Timothy this is this is a seasoned uh
[39:55] this is the prophet for the age speaking
[39:57] to Timothy
[39:59] a son of God
[40:01] and he's saying but continue thou in the
[40:03] things which thou Hast learned
[40:08] don't get itching ears for something new
[40:10] and fantastic that you that dazzles your
[40:13] mind
[40:15] look for that that stimulates the spirit
[40:17] within you stimulates You by Revelation
[40:19] that's right
[40:21] because it's sometimes the things we've
[40:23] heard over and over and over again that
[40:25] we have a mental understanding of but
[40:27] not a true revelation
[40:29] so we could say oh here here the
[40:31] preacher is preaching that thing again
[40:34] but the word of God is like an onion
[40:36] for every Revelation for every scripture
[40:38] there's an onion and there is a deeper
[40:41] and deeper and deeper and deeper and the
[40:44] center of the onion is the sweetest spot
[40:45] just so you know it's my favorite spot
[40:48] uh praise the Lord so ever so so
[40:51] continue which thou Hast learned and has
[40:53] been assured of knowing of whom thou
[40:56] Hast learned them
[40:58] so it's not just what you know what
[41:00] you've been taught but who did it come
[41:01] from who is your father
[41:04] who is your father
[41:06] all scripture is given by inspiration
[41:08] excuse me I skipped verse verse 15 and
[41:11] that from a child thou Hast known the
[41:13] holy scriptures raised in the message
[41:15] I have an affinity with Timothy
[41:18] which are able to make thee wise unto
[41:20] salvation through faith which is in
[41:23] Christ Jesus
[41:25] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[41:27] God all scripture and is profitable for
[41:31] Doctrine for reproof
[41:33] for correction
[41:35] for instruction in righteousness
[41:37] sometimes preaching sometimes Fellowship
[41:40] in conversation is instruction
[41:43] for us along the way not every time when
[41:47] God moves is it an evangelistical moment
[41:50] it can be conversation me and Brother
[41:52] David fishing on the river talking about
[41:56] things of God I was I and I'll I'll let
[41:58] you sit down in a second
[42:00] actually I'll finish then I'll just then
[42:02] we'll go on so for correction for
[42:04] instruction in righteousness that the
[42:05] man of God may be perfect
[42:09] not the flesh
[42:10] the man of God inside of you is the man
[42:13] of God may be perfect thoroughly
[42:16] furnished unto all good works Inspire
[42:19] our heads Heavenly Father we pray that
[42:20] you just add to your word tonight speak
[42:23] to our hearts Lord father I pray you'd
[42:26] bring the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[42:27] Lord that that your people tonight
[42:30] father they would not perceive and they
[42:32] would not think in their hearts that
[42:34] this is something I am trying to to make
[42:36] a point or or I'm trying to have an
[42:38] opinion tonight but God we just want to
[42:40] speak about your word we want to take a
[42:42] portion of your word and talk about it
[42:44] tonight preach about it as you've
[42:46] ordained Lord this is the way you've
[42:48] ordained it I prayed speak to us tonight
[42:50] Lord we're leaning heavily upon you Lord
[42:53] as always father I pray Lord I know I'm
[42:56] leaning heavily upon you I pray your
[42:58] congregation this this evening your
[43:00] people would lean heavily into you that
[43:02] their ears would be tuned to the right
[43:04] channel Lord we thank you Father may you
[43:06] bless your word tonight we pray in Jesus
[43:08] name amen you may be seated
[43:11] may the Lord bless his word
[43:18] so I kind of Ward with this
[43:20] thought I I had a had a kind of this
[43:23] sometimes the Lord stirs on your heart
[43:25] and you don't know exactly what
[43:27] what it is but you have a general theme
[43:29] the God begins to stealth stirring your
[43:31] heart and you begin to look at that
[43:33] theme as Brother David knows you begin
[43:35] to look at that theme and pray and read
[43:37] different things and God Narrows that
[43:39] into a sermon
[43:41] so I began to I begin to meditate it and
[43:44] kind of feel this moving in my spirit
[43:45] around Holiness and
[43:48] um so you know I had I thought well
[43:49] maybe it'll go this way maybe it'll go
[43:51] this way but I just I just want to say
[43:53] tonight that I have no desire to to use
[43:55] the pulpit an opinion I never desire to
[43:57] use the pulpit to make a point I have no
[44:00] desire to to cause dissension while the
[44:02] pastor's away
[44:04] um
[44:05] we have fellowship and we and we have a
[44:08] a relationship there and so we preached
[44:11] the word at Grace Tabernacle and so I
[44:13] just pray tonight that that God can
[44:15] speak to us and um and we can just enjoy
[44:18] his word because his elect no matter
[44:21] what it is his elect takes the word and
[44:23] it blesses them praise the Lord
[44:25] so my title tonight is impersonators of
[44:29] Truth
[44:30] I kept I kept coming on this quote and
[44:32] you know what I don't even think I used
[44:34] the quote
[44:35] um because it just had the line in there
[44:36] but it didn't have the general thought
[44:38] but brother random makes the comment
[44:39] impersonators of Truth and I I saw this
[44:42] a few times and I think I even read the
[44:44] quote on Sunday actually and so I began
[44:47] to sit down to begin to study and make
[44:48] and this this this uh this line from
[44:51] this quote came to me again
[44:53] impersonators of Truth and
[44:55] and so I began to think about this and
[44:58] and uh of uh the these scriptures
[45:01] started to to come and and we just read
[45:04] here in Timothy second Timothy where
[45:06] Paul is is telling Timothy look
[45:10] he warns them of these men that that
[45:13] have a certain Behavior pattern
[45:16] a certain working in their spirits that
[45:20] identify them with Darkness but he says
[45:23] they have a form of godliness so if you
[45:26] have somebody who is in in impersonating
[45:29] truth
[45:32] how can you tell they're not the real
[45:35] thing
[45:36] they have the form of godliness
[45:39] give me give me time here to lay this
[45:41] Foundation out
[45:42] they have a form of godliness in other
[45:45] words they looked apart
[45:47] they act apart they can say the right
[45:50] words
[45:51] well we have a quote here maybe I'll
[45:53] just read this
[45:59] um
[46:01] we have we have a quote here where
[46:03] brother Branham says that they
[46:06] um
[46:10] well we'll read it but he says that they
[46:12] know the Mysteries
[46:14] they know the Mysteries so they can talk
[46:17] about the Mysteries you see all the
[46:19] Mysteries have been revealed and you can
[46:21] hear people talk about this and it lines
[46:22] up directly and that sounds good
[46:25] but there's something there there's
[46:26] something in their lives there's a
[46:28] condition that they have within their
[46:30] spirits that don't line up with the word
[46:33] of God
[46:35] so
[46:37] um Genesis chapter 19.
[46:43] Genesis chapter 19.
[46:47] we're going to read about something
[46:53] that started in the beginning
[46:56] in Genesis Genesis at the beginning
[46:58] Genesis is the start of of the world
[47:01] this Genesis is the start of the
[47:03] Christian Journey
[47:05] God called Abraham out
[47:07] and so begin the story of the Israelites
[47:12] and in chapter 19 we pick up the story
[47:15] here of Abraham and lot lot had decided
[47:18] to go down into Sodom and that's where
[47:19] he wanted to set up and he wanted to
[47:21] live
[47:22] and so if you read the backstory we know
[47:25] Abraham said you know the three men came
[47:27] to him and the Lord and all that thing
[47:29] so now the the two angels have gone down
[47:31] to Sodom so chapter 19 Genesis 19 verse
[47:34] 1 and there came two angels to Sodom at
[47:37] even and lot sat in the gate of Sodom
[47:40] and not seeing them rose up to meet them
[47:43] and he bowed himself with his face
[47:45] toward the ground and he said behold now
[47:48] my lords turn in so lacking revelation
[47:53] first of all lacking revelation
[47:55] so let's just take this for a second
[47:57] here Lots sitting in the gate in other
[48:00] words lot an influential man of the city
[48:03] he was in politics an influential man in
[48:06] the city he was sitting at the gate that
[48:07] was a spot reserved
[48:09] in these times for the people who had a
[48:12] say in what was going on in that City so
[48:14] now we have
[48:15] do you know what that means lot had to
[48:17] do
[48:18] compromise lot had to compromise to be
[48:22] in a position that he was in
[48:24] so we see compromise in law and we see a
[48:28] lack of Revelation
[48:30] but he is the nephew of Abraham
[48:33] so keep that connection so he says come
[48:36] into into your Okay so
[48:39] lack of Revelation but he identifies
[48:41] them
[48:42] as angels he correctly identifies them
[48:46] as Angels he just doesn't have a full
[48:48] revelation
[48:50] they've identified this as the message
[48:54] but they're lacking full Revelation now
[48:58] please stay with me
[48:59] tonight lacking the full Revelation so
[49:02] he says he says Terry all night wash
[49:04] your feet you shall rise up early and go
[49:05] on your ways and they said neighbor we
[49:07] will abide in the street all night and
[49:09] he pressed upon them greatly and they
[49:11] turn in unto him and entered into his
[49:13] house and he made them a feast and did
[49:15] bake unleavened bread and they did eat
[49:17] ha he cooked the right meal unleavened
[49:21] bread
[49:22] you see
[49:24] having a form of godliness
[49:27] having a form of godliness this is just
[49:29] the word tonight Saints
[49:31] and so he he sets forth this meal and
[49:33] and it's all lines up with with with the
[49:36] way it should be with the way the word
[49:38] says and they eat but before they lay
[49:40] down the men of the city even the men of
[49:42] Sodom come past the house around
[49:44] both old and young all the people from
[49:47] every quarter and they called unto lot
[49:50] and said unto him where are the men
[49:51] which came into thee this night bring
[49:54] them unto us that we may know them know
[49:56] them carnally nor them in fornication so
[49:59] you have homosexuality right there at
[50:02] the door of Sodom and God looks as Sin
[50:05] as Sin
[50:07] but this identifies us today what is
[50:11] what is right out in the open today is
[50:13] is is the you know LGBT movement lgbtq
[50:17] so that that we use that as an
[50:19] identification God can still save a gay
[50:21] person God can deliver them God does and
[50:24] does all the time and Sin is Sin but
[50:26] this identifies us with the days of law
[50:29] so Allah went out to the door unto them
[50:31] and shut the door after them so he goes
[50:32] out he shuts the door he says listen
[50:34] Brethren do not so wickedly behold now I
[50:37] have two daughters which have not known
[50:39] man two virgin daughters let me I pray
[50:41] you bring them out unto you and you do
[50:43] to them as it is good in your eyes in
[50:45] other words here's my daughters that are
[50:47] virgins go ahead and rape them
[50:50] this is Brother lot this is not Baptist
[50:54] law this is Brother lot
[50:57] you see the word of God follows
[51:00] the present day
[51:04] years ago
[51:05] lot was the Baptist the Methodist but
[51:09] that Spirit has moved forward with God
[51:12] because it's twins it's always twins
[51:16] there's no issues for a message believer
[51:18] to not accept Catholicism
[51:20] because
[51:23] but today there's a twin every time
[51:26] there's a Revival Revival produces twins
[51:29] why
[51:31] why does that happen the devil slips in
[51:35] to impersonate truth because he cannot
[51:38] so the devil can't the devil couldn't
[51:40] have created his own message his version
[51:43] of the message until brother Branham
[51:46] came and God used him because the devil
[51:48] cannot create anything
[51:50] and he doesn't know the mind of God
[51:53] but but the brand of the message came
[51:55] and the devil's behind he catches up he
[51:59] doesn't there's a portion of the message
[52:01] which is revelation of who Christ is
[52:03] that the devil will never understand and
[52:05] never be able to impersonate
[52:07] okay but you'll never have the wisdom or
[52:10] the ability to see that thing that the
[52:12] devil can't see unless you have the
[52:14] Revelation also so but so so now we have
[52:18] these two things so now today this is
[52:20] Brother lot
[52:21] he's going to give his daughters
[52:24] from the youth group
[52:26] out to these men of the world do with
[52:28] them what you want what is that does
[52:30] that say are we saying that that uh a
[52:33] brother is going to actually physically
[52:35] take his daughters and put them on the
[52:38] streets
[52:39] um dress a certain way as as Pro no
[52:42] spiritual everything we read in this
[52:46] story is a spiritual application today
[52:50] so why do you have good and I and
[52:53] certain situations God has is Sovereign
[52:56] some situations and this is what I'm
[52:58] what I'm addressing is that why do you
[53:01] see people who seem to the parents seem
[53:04] to be good and seem to be serving God
[53:07] but they don't apply that to their
[53:09] children that's right
[53:11] they let their children
[53:13] they don't they don't have curfew they
[53:15] don't have rules they don't apply chores
[53:17] and different things as the young age
[53:19] and raising up they they go do what they
[53:21] want they hang out with what whoever
[53:23] they want they do whatever they want in
[53:25] their room with their door shut why is
[53:27] that and yet those parents in church
[53:29] display godliness but they don't take
[53:32] the word and apply it to their children
[53:36] do you know what they're doing they're
[53:37] doing the same thing that lot did with
[53:39] his daughters
[53:41] I thought I told you tonight that I I
[53:43] Ward with this but I just gonna preach
[53:46] it and let God take care of it so that's
[53:48] what happened spiritually lot casts your
[53:51] spiritually these men and women are
[53:54] casting in the message in the message
[53:56] stop putting it out there
[53:58] no I'm not talking about you
[54:01] people want to put it out there do you
[54:02] know why people want to say the foolish
[54:03] version are into the nominations because
[54:05] it takes the responsibility away from us
[54:06] and we say well we're in the message
[54:07] Church we're safe no we're not
[54:10] we're safe in Christ and go you go look
[54:14] in the message you see over and over
[54:15] again but the Brown says God's pulling a
[54:17] bride from the church
[54:20] and the church from the world
[54:22] so um okay
[54:25] and they said look stand back and they
[54:28] said again this one fellow came into
[54:29] sojourn and he will need to be a judge
[54:31] now we will deal worse with thee than
[54:33] with them so apparently something had
[54:34] just happened where some fellow came in
[54:37] and they just
[54:38] destroyed him
[54:40] and so they're saying look whatever we
[54:42] did to him it's worse with these guys
[54:43] and they press sore upon the man even
[54:45] lot and came near to break the door
[54:51] but the man excuse me the men put forth
[54:54] their hand so they the Angels Reach Out
[54:56] grab lot pull him in slam the door and
[54:59] then they Smite the men outside with
[55:01] blindness both small and great so that
[55:03] they weared themselves to find the door
[55:06] so they blinded them they couldn't find
[55:08] the door
[55:09] and we know that brother bear uses that
[55:11] you know Billy Graham and brother Oral
[55:13] Roberts blinded the eyes of the people
[55:16] but this is today
[55:17] we're looking at lot and his family and
[55:19] what transpired today verse 30 same
[55:23] chapter and lot went up out so he leaves
[55:25] Sodom his wife turns into a pillar of
[55:27] salt and Sodom is destroyed and lot
[55:30] flees the zor but he's scared to stay in
[55:32] zor so he goes up into the caves behind
[55:34] zor and the mountain
[55:36] uh 31 and the firstborn said unto the
[55:39] younger our father is old and there is
[55:41] not a man in the earth to come in unto
[55:43] us after the manner of all the Earth
[55:45] come let us make our father drink wine
[55:47] and we will lie with him and that we
[55:49] perceive excuse me preserve seed of our
[55:52] father and they made their father drink
[55:54] wine that night and the firstborn went
[55:56] in and lay with her father and he
[55:58] perceived not when she lay down nor when
[56:00] she arose and it came to pass on the
[56:02] moral that the firstborn said unto the
[56:03] younger behold I lay yesterday with my
[56:05] father let us make him drink wine this
[56:07] night also and go thou in and lie with
[56:09] him that we may preserve seed of our
[56:11] father and they made their father drink
[56:12] wine that night and also so on verse 37
[56:16] and the firstborn Barry's son and called
[56:18] his name Moab the same as the father of
[56:20] the moabites unto this day
[56:23] and the younger she also buries son and
[56:25] called his name benami the same as the
[56:28] father of the children of Ammon unto
[56:30] this day
[56:31] so we take here so so now a lot look
[56:34] look look what kind of
[56:36] let me tell you something
[56:38] and you and you know this stuff
[56:40] those girls didn't just suddenly become
[56:42] that way
[56:44] they were already anointed by a spirit
[56:46] of fornication
[56:48] they already
[56:49] they already had the level of knowledge
[56:52] and worldly at worldly wise
[56:56] of what to do
[56:58] get him drunk get pregnant they knew it
[57:01] they knew how to do it
[57:02] so who were they hanging out with who
[57:05] was coming to dinner and saying
[57:07] afterwards and playing in the bedroom
[57:08] growing up what was Lot not teaching
[57:11] them
[57:12] what was Lot not doing when he was too
[57:14] caught up with building his own life
[57:17] you see these are this a lot was maybe
[57:19] in in any 10 in in in intentions a good
[57:23] man
[57:24] but his desires were toward his worldly
[57:27] gain
[57:29] more so than the App application of the
[57:33] word of God
[57:34] amen so law doesn't spend the time
[57:37] raising his children
[57:39] he spends the time raising his career
[57:43] there was neglect
[57:46] there was neglect first of all lot
[57:48] should have never even been in Sodom
[57:51] so that's a whole nother sermon
[57:54] but you see what happens is now these
[57:57] two virgins
[58:00] they go and and they commit fornication
[58:03] with their father and bring forth their
[58:05] own children and one of those children
[58:07] is the moabites
[58:10] so we could say well Billy Graham and
[58:12] Oral Roberts went to lot and and then so
[58:15] lot and then the uh the the his
[58:18] daughters and all this so well then
[58:21] moabites must be the denominations right
[58:24] but let's let's let's
[58:26] pause there a second because
[58:29] Moab is Israel's brother
[58:32] Israel is the church
[58:34] not all Israel is Israel but from Israel
[58:37] is coming comes and elect people
[58:40] from the church The Message Church comes
[58:43] and elect bride an elect people so Moab
[58:47] is Israel's brother
[58:49] so now um
[58:50] law the father committed fornication
[58:53] with his own daughters this brought the
[58:55] seed of antichrist
[58:57] because a lot
[58:59] had no revelation
[59:01] so from this man from the nominations
[59:04] come this
[59:06] that's where the devil carries his seed
[59:08] through
[59:09] through this through through you know
[59:11] serpent seat and it's the twin but the
[59:13] devil carries his seed down through time
[59:15] in the denominations but then what
[59:17] happens is that came across and that
[59:20] mixes and brother Branham identified
[59:21] says it's not the Baptist it's not this
[59:23] it's when man's ideas mix with the word
[59:28] of God
[59:30] so
[59:32] God ordained a certain way for the seed
[59:35] to be brought and while this is
[59:37] happening Abraham's on the backside of
[59:39] the desert and shortly after this this
[59:41] time we see Isaac and Rebecca
[59:44] but the seed the child brought forth
[59:46] under the correct conditions according
[59:49] to the word of God Rebecca of Virgin the
[59:52] the lot's daughter's revergence but it
[59:55] was the wrong seat it was the wrong
[59:58] it was the right act perverted so it was
[1:00:00] a perversion so the devil's bringing
[1:00:02] forth so from law the denomination that
[1:00:04] that idea he brings that down now we
[1:00:07] have now we have this this the
[1:00:10] this um parallel here we have Moab and
[1:00:13] Israel
[1:00:14] so um this brings forth the seed of the
[1:00:18] Antichrist
[1:00:20] because Abraham and law came out
[1:00:22] together
[1:00:23] there was a Revival Abraham came out lot
[1:00:26] piggybacked on that the twins out of
[1:00:29] that Revival
[1:00:30] and around the same time you have Isaac
[1:00:32] and Rebecca and Esau and all of that
[1:00:34] happened close to the same time that you
[1:00:36] have lot and and his daughter so one
[1:00:39] brought the seed of redemption and the
[1:00:41] other the the the seed of the Antichrist
[1:00:45] so now moab's doing their own thing and
[1:00:48] Israel is doing their their own thing
[1:00:51] according to the word of God
[1:00:53] so brother Branham says here he says in
[1:00:56] the pergament church age
[1:00:57] he says the story is found in Numbers
[1:00:59] chapter 22 through 25. now we know that
[1:01:02] Israel was the chosen people of God they
[1:01:05] were the Pentecostals of their day they
[1:01:07] had taken a refuge under the blood they
[1:01:10] had all been baptized in the Red Sea
[1:01:12] they came up out of the waters singing
[1:01:14] in the spirit and dancing under the
[1:01:16] energy of the Holy Ghost while Miriam
[1:01:18] the prophetess played her tambourine
[1:01:21] well after a certain time of journeying
[1:01:23] these children of Israel came to Moab
[1:01:27] you remember who Moab was he was the son
[1:01:29] of law by one of his own daughters and
[1:01:31] law in turn was a nephew of Abraham so
[1:01:34] Israel and Moab were related I want you
[1:01:37] to see that he says the moabites knew
[1:01:39] the truth whether they lived up to it or
[1:01:42] not that's right
[1:01:44] that's right they knew the truth having
[1:01:46] the form of godliness
[1:01:52] so now they come to a place for a long
[1:01:55] time it was just Israel and Moab doing
[1:01:59] their thing
[1:02:00] but then there came a Time
[1:02:04] there came a time where Israel came face
[1:02:06] to face with Moab for the first time
[1:02:08] saying to God that's where we are today
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:11] amen for a Time the message Church did
[1:02:13] their thing if you will give me the
[1:02:14] Liberty to say it like this did their
[1:02:16] thing brother Branham all everyone that
[1:02:19] went to Message Church believed brother
[1:02:21] Branham all of this stuff did the thing
[1:02:23] came across the desert had the Red Sea
[1:02:26] experience had all of these things but
[1:02:28] then they came face to face with their
[1:02:29] own brethren moas
[1:02:32] you see it's not people it's a spirit
[1:02:34] that Spirit never leaves
[1:02:38] incidentally
[1:02:39] the spirit of the mo that religion of
[1:02:43] belpure
[1:02:45] a Porsche a section if you want to call
[1:02:47] it was sacrificing children
[1:02:50] and that's what that spirit will do will
[1:02:51] cause you to do like lot did and
[1:02:53] sacrifice your children to the world
[1:02:57] amen so and that's straight to the point
[1:03:00] but that's the word of God tonight and
[1:03:02] and I trust that you just take that to
[1:03:04] heart
[1:03:05] because saying to God
[1:03:07] we have to watch what our kids read
[1:03:11] we have to know what they're eating even
[1:03:13] if you have to sit and read a novel for
[1:03:15] ages 8 through 12.
[1:03:17] to you sit read it
[1:03:20] know what your kids are eating thumb
[1:03:22] through it we go to the library and I
[1:03:24] don't say this to lift myself up I say
[1:03:26] this to to give you maybe an idea we go
[1:03:28] to the library for books all the kids
[1:03:29] they bring their books and I check them
[1:03:31] even kids books amen
[1:03:33] there are there are kids books that have
[1:03:35] descriptions of how to act immorally
[1:03:38] that are for kindergartners
[1:03:42] you have to know what they're reading
[1:03:43] you have to know what they're watching
[1:03:45] one of the rules we have in our house
[1:03:46] unless under certain situations certain
[1:03:49] conditions where we're present there is
[1:03:53] they can only
[1:03:55] VeggieTales or something like that but
[1:03:56] even then you have to check that stuff
[1:03:58] what are they watching
[1:04:00] you know what I it's it's a shameful for
[1:04:02] me to say it but there was a point in
[1:04:03] time as a father where we would put on
[1:04:06] you know say Curious George or something
[1:04:08] on YouTube and leave it until I
[1:04:11] identified commercials
[1:04:13] and the endless playlist on YouTube and
[1:04:18] YouTube has these sneaky algorithms that
[1:04:20] are anointed at the devil that will pull
[1:04:21] in stuff don't leave your kids exposed
[1:04:24] to the internet
[1:04:25] with the device in their hand
[1:04:27] that's just being a good parent that's
[1:04:29] applying the word until your children
[1:04:32] have the ability to say this is wrong
[1:04:34] and this is right you're all their Holy
[1:04:37] Spirit and sometimes that means they're
[1:04:39] going to cry and scream for two hours
[1:04:42] but I'd rather deal with a crying
[1:04:43] screaming kid for two hours then
[1:04:46] hand them over the devil and say go
[1:04:47] ahead rape their spirit because that's
[1:04:49] what happens we have to know this stuff
[1:04:52] saying to God it's and you know what
[1:04:54] people are going to make fun and they're
[1:04:55] going to say oh you were just over
[1:04:56] parenting you are you are too involved
[1:04:58] let kids be
[1:05:00] I believe kids should be kids with a
[1:05:02] safety net
[1:05:03] with a fence around them say hey you're
[1:05:06] not because you're not going to send
[1:05:07] your kid you might give your kid and I
[1:05:09] don't say this directly to anybody just
[1:05:10] an example you might give your kid a
[1:05:12] phone and say you know just you have all
[1:05:13] the access the internet wherever you
[1:05:15] want whenever you want and I'm not going
[1:05:16] to monitor it that's the same thing as
[1:05:19] sending your two-year-old who knows
[1:05:20] nothing about highways out in front of
[1:05:22] your house and say go ahead at my house
[1:05:24] I have that busy road go ahead without
[1:05:25] an offense you would never do that
[1:05:29] you do the same thing when you hand them
[1:05:31] over to the internet
[1:05:35] praise the Lord God the Lord can apply
[1:05:38] that the balm and Gilead
[1:05:40] because saying to God I've had to deal
[1:05:42] with it
[1:05:43] I've had to face it where it's like I
[1:05:45] would rather give them the device and go
[1:05:48] take a nap because I have been up for 48
[1:05:50] hours almost straight
[1:05:52] but I can't
[1:05:54] it's not easy it's hard to do and
[1:05:57] sometimes you have to change your life
[1:05:58] you have to restructure your life okay
[1:06:00] okay you have to use wisdom the Lord
[1:06:04] says be wisest serpents as harmless as
[1:06:06] doves sometimes we have to use wisdom
[1:06:07] and do things maybe there isn't a
[1:06:10] scripture for it but it's the uh it's
[1:06:13] the love letter it's what's between the
[1:06:14] lines and just say you know what the way
[1:06:16] we're running our house
[1:06:18] we're going to do a different you're
[1:06:19] going to go go to bed at this time
[1:06:21] instead of this time and and we're gonna
[1:06:23] not eat this stuff because it affects us
[1:06:25] a certain way
[1:06:28] and you use those things and you apply
[1:06:30] better Behavior patterns in your
[1:06:31] children and I know I'm young and I
[1:06:33] still have a lot to learn I'm not as
[1:06:35] wise and and and as uh decorated as
[1:06:37] brother Mary
[1:06:39] on child raising but these are just
[1:06:42] things that in in my young age that I've
[1:06:44] learned
[1:06:46] um and and you can use that and then you
[1:06:48] don't have to you know I think you
[1:06:50] understand what I'm saying so
[1:06:52] foreign
[1:06:54] says that they um the nephew of Abraham
[1:06:57] so the moabites knew the truth whether
[1:06:59] they lived it lived up to it or not
[1:07:02] he says in um I think it's uh the
[1:07:05] sardisian church age he says another
[1:07:06] illustration that we might take is the
[1:07:08] story of Israel leaving Egypt for Canaan
[1:07:10] land God's purpose in this age was to
[1:07:12] bring Israel out and to take them in to
[1:07:15] the end that they might serve him so out
[1:07:18] and in
[1:07:20] that's what that's where I was I just
[1:07:21] remember my spot before we
[1:07:23] Israel and Moab they're doing their own
[1:07:26] things now they're face to face these
[1:07:28] are the spirits face to face that's
[1:07:29] where we are today they are face to face
[1:07:31] in our church yes our church
[1:07:34] not people these might be Spirits I
[1:07:36] might anoint a person for a season but
[1:07:38] God delivers them
[1:07:40] the only thing that that seals your fate
[1:07:42] is a blasphemy in the Holy Spirit
[1:07:46] because it's Spirits not people
[1:07:48] you could say oh brother Chris is
[1:07:50] talking about that church over there no
[1:07:51] I'm not I'm talking about the spirit
[1:07:54] because that Spirit can live anywhere
[1:07:57] the spirit of Christ
[1:08:00] God brought me out
[1:08:03] but you could look at me at some point
[1:08:04] in time and question me but God brought
[1:08:07] me out
[1:08:09] you do not know what God's doing in a
[1:08:11] church that might be different you don't
[1:08:13] know what goes into the people
[1:08:16] to the people there praise the Lord I'm
[1:08:17] just going to leave it there it's it's
[1:08:19] getting too uh particular not too it's
[1:08:22] getting too uh anyways too obvious so
[1:08:26] another illustration that we might take
[1:08:27] is the story of Israel living Egypt for
[1:08:29] Canaan land so God's calling Israel out
[1:08:31] and into the word of God but the man
[1:08:33] always emphasizes out but in
[1:08:37] because lots of people come out
[1:08:40] as we're looking at tonight lots of
[1:08:42] people come out but they never go in
[1:08:44] Judas came out but he never went in and
[1:08:48] if you don't go in
[1:08:50] you go back out
[1:08:53] only two ways to take them in to the end
[1:08:56] that they might serve him thus when they
[1:08:58] left Egypt they all came out under the
[1:09:01] blood of the sacrificial lamb they all
[1:09:03] went through the waters of baptism in
[1:09:04] the Red Sea they all enjoyed the mighty
[1:09:06] Miracles all eight of the Manna all
[1:09:09] drank of The Rock
[1:09:11] and insofar as obvious external
[1:09:14] blessings and manifestations were
[1:09:18] concerned they all partook in like an
[1:09:20] equal manner
[1:09:23] so they had the physical manifestations
[1:09:26] of the anointing
[1:09:29] they danced with Miriam
[1:09:33] they had this outward expression oh
[1:09:36] hallelujah praise God
[1:09:43] but when they came to Moab those who
[1:09:45] joined in the Feast of belpure they all
[1:09:47] died
[1:09:48] their carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:09:51] that's what I take I just want to take
[1:09:53] this brother Ron told me he mentored me
[1:09:56] as a as a minister for a few years as
[1:09:58] you know he told me he said brother
[1:09:59] Chris when you feel that he says ride
[1:10:01] the wave
[1:10:03] write it out
[1:10:05] when when Bell peor happened and that
[1:10:08] man brought his moabite wife into the
[1:10:10] sanctuary of God
[1:10:12] Phineas took his Spear and chased them
[1:10:16] and ran them through
[1:10:17] Phineas was not Moses
[1:10:20] he was a priest that's right he was of
[1:10:22] the levitical priesthood
[1:10:24] God has ordained fiefold Ministry
[1:10:27] who can identify that Spirit when it
[1:10:31] walks in the church physically
[1:10:33] spiritually and God gives them the
[1:10:36] ability anoints them to speak the word
[1:10:38] of God
[1:10:39] if you go and you look that's how God
[1:10:41] works through the scriptures God doesn't
[1:10:42] just isn't going to take something in
[1:10:44] the New Testament and just change it he
[1:10:47] came to
[1:10:48] how's it amplify
[1:10:50] the Old Testament
[1:10:52] he says this is the type this is how it
[1:10:54] is today but that's God's gonna run the
[1:10:56] same way all the way through
[1:10:58] he's going to run the same way all the
[1:10:59] way through
[1:11:01] and he's never
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] he never changes
[1:11:07] so their carcasses fell in the
[1:11:08] wilderness for it was there that they
[1:11:10] refused the word of God and turned from
[1:11:12] it
[1:11:13] so they confessed the word they
[1:11:15] confessed they believed they had a form
[1:11:17] of godliness but there came a showdown
[1:11:19] that's why the scripture says in in
[1:11:21] Timothy he says it says but they shall
[1:11:24] proceed no further for their Folly shall
[1:11:26] be made manifest unto all men as theirs
[1:11:29] also was so there comes a point where
[1:11:31] that Spirit within them is openly
[1:11:33] identified by all men
[1:11:35] but what damage are they going to do in
[1:11:38] that time to those who aren't aware of
[1:11:40] what's going on to those who aren't
[1:11:42] studious to the word to catch the two
[1:11:45] spirits in the framework of the church
[1:11:48] you say oh well you know you can't you
[1:11:51] can't live life like well I'm seed I'll
[1:11:53] make it
[1:11:55] first of all let me just throw my
[1:11:56] opinion in there in here
[1:11:58] I don't believe seed will ever say that
[1:12:03] so there you have it anyways
[1:12:05] so their carcass fell in the wilderness
[1:12:08] for it was there that they refused the
[1:12:09] word of God and turned from it now this
[1:12:12] is what Hebrews 6 verse 1 to 9 speaks of
[1:12:15] which was brought out so carefully in
[1:12:16] the pergament church pergament age you
[1:12:18] can't go along with just part of the
[1:12:20] word you have to take all the words so
[1:12:23] saints of God this is the burden of my
[1:12:25] heart because why do people sit and
[1:12:27] accept part of the word
[1:12:29] that's right what anoints someone to sit
[1:12:31] in a church that is only part word
[1:12:35] it's a burden
[1:12:37] I I feel the pain and I wonder why
[1:12:42] but the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:12:45] ordered of the Lord and we all have to
[1:12:47] have a testimony
[1:12:50] but it's the preaching of the word the
[1:12:53] preaching of the true word
[1:12:55] through the chosen vessel aligning with
[1:12:58] the word of God that brings forth
[1:13:00] Liberty in the in the camp
[1:13:04] Aiken was the only one
[1:13:06] out of all the capital of Israel
[1:13:08] that denied the word of God
[1:13:11] but it caused the rest of the camp to
[1:13:13] fall
[1:13:16] now that's
[1:13:18] I've had people use that and say whoa I
[1:13:21] had sin in my life so I left the church
[1:13:23] because I didn't want to hinder to
[1:13:24] church
[1:13:25] that's not what that means
[1:13:27] it can willingly sinned and willingly
[1:13:29] hidden had no desire whatsoever to put
[1:13:32] that from him
[1:13:34] though you're fighting something in your
[1:13:36] life and you had the desire and it keeps
[1:13:37] coming back and it keeps coming back and
[1:13:39] God has not yet delivered you that does
[1:13:41] not mean you are hindering the house the
[1:13:43] church
[1:13:44] we are here to to build you up we are
[1:13:47] here to stand with you and walk through
[1:13:49] this with you it's when and there comes
[1:13:51] a point and I've heard I've heard many
[1:13:53] stories from pastors who have had to do
[1:13:55] this where you say look don't bring your
[1:13:57] child to church anymore
[1:13:59] they don't have or excuse me let me let
[1:14:02] me let me back that up
[1:14:04] leave this to the pastor to clarify but
[1:14:06] there are times where it's just you know
[1:14:08] what they have no desire whatsoever and
[1:14:10] they're just being a hindrance that's a
[1:14:11] totally different thing that's Aiken but
[1:14:13] when that person has a desire in their
[1:14:15] heart to serve God
[1:14:16] though they have to drag themselves to
[1:14:19] church sometimes but there's something
[1:14:20] inside there that's that's different
[1:14:22] okay
[1:14:23] praise the Lord so
[1:14:27] yeah you can't go along with just part
[1:14:28] of the word you have to take all the
[1:14:29] word there are people who seem involved
[1:14:31] in the things of God almost 100 percent
[1:14:35] do you realize do you realize how close
[1:14:38] that is
[1:14:39] do you realize how hard that is to
[1:14:41] identify and it can take time
[1:14:44] and prayer for you to identify that
[1:14:48] spirit
[1:14:50] even even if you're seasoned even if
[1:14:53] you've been
[1:14:54] sometimes it's just this little
[1:14:56] funny we we
[1:14:59] express it in the English language as a
[1:15:02] funny feeling
[1:15:03] but really it's the stirring of the
[1:15:05] spirit of God
[1:15:06] that's still small voices saying
[1:15:08] something's not right
[1:15:11] and you just have to apply prayer that
[1:15:14] God would lead you
[1:15:16] right and so Services happen like this
[1:15:18] tonight
[1:15:19] um you okay so there are people who seem
[1:15:22] involved in the things have got almost
[1:15:23] 100 they are like Judas no one but Jesus
[1:15:26] knew exactly what kind of a person Judas
[1:15:28] was no one but Jesus knew exactly what
[1:15:31] kind of a person Judas was
[1:15:33] so who can tell you who Judas is
[1:15:37] the word of God
[1:15:39] that's it
[1:15:41] there's no other way to find out
[1:15:43] there's no other way to find out
[1:15:45] so the day came and same with to find
[1:15:49] out who's Peter
[1:15:50] who's John
[1:15:52] who's
[1:15:55] what all the disciples it takes the same
[1:15:57] Christ to identify within you that
[1:16:00] brother that sister
[1:16:02] okay you see how you see you see how
[1:16:05] important it is to serve God as close as
[1:16:08] possible
[1:16:10] I listened to the sermon today Valley
[1:16:12] making make the valley full of ditches
[1:16:16] and
[1:16:18] brother man talks about this the old
[1:16:19] Scottish guy that was looking for
[1:16:20] someone to take him across the mountains
[1:16:22] in a stagecoach and the first two guys
[1:16:24] says oh I can full Gallop get within six
[1:16:26] inches of the edge and the next I saw
[1:16:28] well I can get in full gasket within
[1:16:29] four inches of the edge and that third
[1:16:31] guy says well I don't know about any of
[1:16:32] that but I can stay as close to the side
[1:16:34] as close as far away from the edge as
[1:16:36] possible and the guy said you can give
[1:16:38] me a ride over the mountains it's not as
[1:16:40] close as you can get to the line and
[1:16:42] still serve God
[1:16:44] it's how far away from it can you get
[1:16:48] it doesn't it's not well this heel is
[1:16:50] two inches three
[1:16:52] is it's the anointing behind that it's
[1:16:54] either a heel or it's not so let's get
[1:16:56] as far away from that as possible I
[1:16:59] heard I was listening to monster preach
[1:17:00] a good friend of mine and and he was he
[1:17:02] was making a comment and he said you
[1:17:04] know some people can get hypocritical
[1:17:05] and they can judge people because they
[1:17:08] see someone doing a certain thing
[1:17:10] and they say well
[1:17:13] you know how dare they you know I but he
[1:17:15] said everyone has their own weaknesses
[1:17:17] and their own struggles so if your
[1:17:19] weakness is high heels
[1:17:21] wear flats
[1:17:23] if you don't have a problem with that
[1:17:26] you don't have to worry you're not going
[1:17:27] to get into the high heels
[1:17:30] you know I don't have a problem with
[1:17:31] dyeing my hair pink
[1:17:34] so I can go in the hair dissection and
[1:17:36] not worry about it
[1:17:37] you understand that's a funny example
[1:17:39] but there's some people that that though
[1:17:41] they're they're the bottle alcohol was
[1:17:43] their weakness they can't even walk in
[1:17:44] that section of the store so they stay
[1:17:46] away from it that's not to say we can't
[1:17:49] walk by that section if we don't have
[1:17:50] you understand what I'm saying to say
[1:17:51] there's everyone has their weaknesses
[1:17:52] that you have to keep guarded so don't
[1:17:54] judge what you are able to do by what
[1:17:57] someone else is able to do judge it by
[1:17:59] your own self
[1:18:00] if you can't do Instagram
[1:18:02] if you if that's your weakness don't
[1:18:05] even go there people people can use
[1:18:07] social media as a tool and it's totally
[1:18:09] fine but there's some people that just
[1:18:10] can't handle it so don't even put don't
[1:18:13] even go there they might be okay they
[1:18:15] might be able to keep it in check and
[1:18:16] just be a tool but if you can't and you
[1:18:19] just you're Doom scrolling till 3am or
[1:18:21] you're looking at stuff you shouldn't be
[1:18:22] looking at don't even bother signing up
[1:18:25] and if you need help permanently
[1:18:26] deleting it come talk to me
[1:18:28] [Laughter]
[1:18:32] right get as far away from the this is
[1:18:34] practical
[1:18:35] sometimes I know what's helped me is to
[1:18:37] hear it's spoken practically like that
[1:18:40] we say you hear a preach all the time
[1:18:42] get as far away from the devil as
[1:18:43] possible but sometimes especially young
[1:18:45] people sitting there you remember when I
[1:18:47] was a young person well what does that
[1:18:48] what does that mean can you give me some
[1:18:49] real life example that's what that means
[1:18:53] don't even go there there's certain
[1:18:54] areas of the story just avoid right
[1:18:57] there's certain things you just avoid
[1:18:59] because
[1:19:00] I I like to avoid malls
[1:19:03] as a man I don't even want to go there
[1:19:07] that's staying as far away from the
[1:19:09] devil as possible but you see people who
[1:19:11] who do that anyways man they struggle
[1:19:14] because they're riding the line
[1:19:17] anyways praise God so
[1:19:19] um he says
[1:19:21] um
[1:19:22] what does he say where are we here so
[1:19:24] the uh the the day came that Judas did
[1:19:27] exactly what Israel did at belpure he
[1:19:29] decided that he wanted to join with the
[1:19:31] false Divine forces enter in to the
[1:19:34] financial political organization of
[1:19:36] anti-word antichrist religion and he did
[1:19:39] so he was fooled
[1:19:42] he was fooled
[1:19:47] the other 11 were not they could not be
[1:19:49] for they were the very elect
[1:19:52] Ed God you don't have to be live in fear
[1:19:56] of being deceived but you do have to
[1:19:59] live in fear of
[1:20:00] am I as close to God as possible that's
[1:20:02] right that's the kind of Godly fear
[1:20:04] Godly fear isn't well what is this true
[1:20:07] is brother Chris is it true is what the
[1:20:10] Davidson what the Paul said Is it true
[1:20:12] that no that's not what it is it's
[1:20:15] saying I don't want that to happen to me
[1:20:17] so Lord please hold me tight
[1:20:20] hold me tight
[1:20:24] they could not be for they were very
[1:20:26] like so when Judas left and betrayed the
[1:20:27] Lord his name was removed from the book
[1:20:29] of life we just heard about that
[1:20:31] beautiful set of sermons about that so
[1:20:34] now I am sure that you have noticed that
[1:20:36] those whose names were in The Book of
[1:20:38] Life were a part of the religious order
[1:20:39] of that day that centered around the
[1:20:41] true God and worship of him though they
[1:20:44] did not worship according to the truth
[1:20:47] so they centered around the true God and
[1:20:49] the worship of him but they didn't
[1:20:51] worship according to the truth
[1:20:56] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:20:59] Liberty
[1:21:01] you want to identify
[1:21:03] you want to identify a church
[1:21:05] look at the women and the young people
[1:21:09] because you're going to identify the
[1:21:10] spirit of that church
[1:21:16] the worship according to the truth is
[1:21:18] there Liberty
[1:21:19] there's times where we struggle with
[1:21:21] things and then we overcome them
[1:21:23] but it shouldn't be years and years and
[1:21:25] years and years and years and years of
[1:21:28] the same thing over and over and over
[1:21:30] again
[1:21:32] if you see that in a church something's
[1:21:34] not quite lining up
[1:21:36] that's right now that person can be in
[1:21:38] in because
[1:21:40] you understand what I'm saying
[1:21:42] so like you just like Judas they didn't
[1:21:44] go all the way see how Judas was chosen
[1:21:46] of God he was instructed in truth he
[1:21:48] shared knowledge
[1:21:50] he shared knowledge of mysteries
[1:21:54] I've read this many times and I I that
[1:21:58] stuck out to me tonight a knowledge of
[1:22:00] the Mysteries
[1:22:01] this is how in in and this is how you
[1:22:04] can hear people who once were of the
[1:22:06] message preaching these things they have
[1:22:08] the knowledge of these Mysteries but no
[1:22:10] true Revelation if they had true
[1:22:13] Revelation they would be here with us
[1:22:17] praise the Lord and that that'll get
[1:22:19] them riled up for me to say that but
[1:22:21] that's just because that's the devil but
[1:22:23] it's the truth show me in the Bible
[1:22:25] where it's not true
[1:22:26] you shall find me a religion that's
[1:22:29] better than this that has is more life
[1:22:31] changing than this that has gives me the
[1:22:33] power to overcome every day of my life
[1:22:35] that is changing me that is making the
[1:22:36] best husband I can be the best father I
[1:22:38] can be the best son I can be the best
[1:22:40] brother I can be show me something
[1:22:43] that gives me liberty
[1:22:45] there's nothing else
[1:22:48] if come too late
[1:22:53] see how Judas was chosen of God
[1:22:58] and and shared knowledge of the
[1:23:00] Mysteries
[1:23:02] he had a Ministry of power granted unto
[1:23:05] him and he healed the sick and cast out
[1:23:07] devils in Jesus name
[1:23:13] but when The Showdown came
[1:23:15] he sold out for gold and political power
[1:23:18] he did not go up to Pentecost to receive
[1:23:20] the spirit of God he was devoid of the
[1:23:23] spirit this is just like the scripture
[1:23:24] was the seven women they want the man's
[1:23:27] name but they don't want their
[1:23:28] relationship they want the name of of of
[1:23:31] of of the message they want the name of
[1:23:33] Christ
[1:23:35] but they don't want relationship
[1:23:39] they want everything that goes with it
[1:23:41] but these these people shall proceed no
[1:23:45] further that should have been my
[1:23:47] subtitle that's right they shall proceed
[1:23:48] no further
[1:23:50] they will do their Folly they will re
[1:23:52] wreak their Havoc for a season but there
[1:23:55] will come a day
[1:23:57] there will come a day where there it'll
[1:23:58] be known
[1:24:00] it'll accommodate when everything will
[1:24:02] be known
[1:24:03] and only shall bow
[1:24:05] he shared knowledge of the mystery he
[1:24:06] had a Ministry of power healed the sick
[1:24:08] cast out devils in Jesus name saying to
[1:24:11] God that's why you can't identify the
[1:24:14] word of God by this kind of stuff
[1:24:17] the signs that's why you can't identify
[1:24:19] the truth by that
[1:24:22] because they do the same thing
[1:24:25] what identifies the truth is the word
[1:24:29] that's right
[1:24:30] what is the word I don't want to see
[1:24:38] exactly I don't wanna I don't care about
[1:24:40] outward manifestations
[1:24:42] as a man sometimes I do I like to see
[1:24:44] you get excited because it encourages me
[1:24:45] when I'm preaching but
[1:24:47] that's not the way God works
[1:24:53] I I don't I'm not trying to to say I'm
[1:24:56] on this side and they're on that side
[1:24:58] I I don't want to be that way no I don't
[1:25:01] be that way one minute because guess
[1:25:02] what
[1:25:03] I've danced
[1:25:05] and I've shouted amen
[1:25:08] amen but are you dancing are you
[1:25:10] shouting because you're revelated
[1:25:11] or you're dancing you're shining because
[1:25:13] the music changed
[1:25:16] and so that's fine
[1:25:19] but don't use that now all I'm saying
[1:25:21] all I'm saying is that's fine that's
[1:25:22] good that's healthy but the member says
[1:25:24] if your Evolution doesn't have emotion
[1:25:25] go bury it it needs emotion
[1:25:30] but don't use that to gauge your
[1:25:32] spiritual
[1:25:33] Journey Don't gauge that to to to to for
[1:25:36] a church because there's churches I've
[1:25:37] been in who who can do that
[1:25:40] but there's something off with the women
[1:25:43] and the youth that's right there's
[1:25:45] something not lining up with the word of
[1:25:48] God
[1:25:48] they get up and they can sing and they
[1:25:50] can do all of these things and they can
[1:25:51] have the hour manifestations and have
[1:25:53] the Miracles but don't use that to say
[1:25:55] that church is on the word
[1:25:57] don't do that don't use that to say that
[1:25:59] person has a revelation
[1:26:02] will it brown before he even really knew
[1:26:04] what was going on in his life he did
[1:26:06] that he was at at a meeting to him he
[1:26:08] didn't he didn't properly identify he
[1:26:10] did this what I'm about to tell you he
[1:26:11] said the meeting he sees two men
[1:26:13] speaking tongues
[1:26:14] carnally says they must I want what they
[1:26:17] have they gotta be so he goes and he
[1:26:20] fellowships with them
[1:26:23] he goes and he talks to them
[1:26:25] and he contacts their Spirit he was a
[1:26:27] prophet operating at different office
[1:26:30] but as a holy ghost filled people you
[1:26:33] have the same ability say God give me
[1:26:35] wisdom and you go and you speak to that
[1:26:38] person or you go and identify that
[1:26:39] situation or you watch you say God I'm
[1:26:41] gonna watch give me
[1:26:43] give me Revelation because sometimes
[1:26:45] people can be saying things I've heard
[1:26:48] this happen some people can be saying
[1:26:49] things preaching a certain way and you
[1:26:51] think you think well they definitely are
[1:26:53] they they definitely say well if we have
[1:26:56] the emotion then we got God but then you
[1:26:58] watch them and you hear them and you say
[1:27:01] no they have a true understanding but
[1:27:03] sometimes we just it comes out the wrong
[1:27:05] way but you watch their life and you
[1:27:07] watch their Ministry and you see go God
[1:27:09] directly this is how this happened to me
[1:27:11] God directly identified they have a true
[1:27:13] understanding of the balance but it took
[1:27:16] me time of prayer and watching to catch
[1:27:20] that so remember does the same thing he
[1:27:21] goes one man's a holy ghost filled
[1:27:23] Christian the other one had two families
[1:27:27] one was a brown-haired woman one was a
[1:27:29] blonde-haired woman he had kids with
[1:27:30] both
[1:27:31] fornication so you can't use that to
[1:27:34] identify but the spirit of God always
[1:27:36] makes known the folly
[1:27:38] praise God
[1:27:40] so
[1:27:41] but when The Showdown came he sought out
[1:27:43] for Golden and political power
[1:27:46] he did not go up to Pentecost to receive
[1:27:48] the spirit of God he was devoid of the
[1:27:50] spirit make no mistake about it a person
[1:27:52] that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost
[1:27:53] into the body of Christ receiving the
[1:27:56] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[1:27:58] word all the way those are capitalized
[1:28:00] in the church age book
[1:28:02] I didn't capitalize him for this quote
[1:28:05] the word all the way this is that is the
[1:28:07] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:28:09] Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right
[1:28:12] there when they fail to go on in that
[1:28:15] word their names are taken off the Book
[1:28:17] of Life
[1:28:19] the power of transformation is that
[1:28:20] right you can cross that line like the
[1:28:22] children of Israel did in their Journey
[1:28:24] coming through the Wilderness Israel did
[1:28:26] the same after they heard Moses's
[1:28:28] message and seen it Vindicated
[1:28:31] listened to a false prophet
[1:28:33] so they saw the signs they were part of
[1:28:37] the signs
[1:28:38] but still they listened to the
[1:28:40] Antichrist
[1:28:41] false prophet that's what false prophet
[1:28:43] is Antichrist
[1:28:44] anything false is Antichrist
[1:28:47] Antichrist isn't this capital a
[1:28:50] automatically the pope it's just
[1:28:52] anything that's not Christ
[1:28:54] the opposite of Christ so smoking a
[1:28:56] cigarette is Antichrist
[1:28:58] false prophet that said uh oh now look
[1:29:01] children we're all the same we should
[1:29:02] marry one among another now you you take
[1:29:05] marriage through the scripture
[1:29:08] marriage spiritually means accepting
[1:29:10] seed
[1:29:13] accepting seed it's not just it's not
[1:29:16] just you maybe hung around the wrong
[1:29:18] people or you you were in the wrong
[1:29:20] church for a while it's not that it's
[1:29:22] that you accepted it
[1:29:25] you accepted that false Doctrine you
[1:29:28] married it and you accepted that seed
[1:29:31] now that seed takes dominance
[1:29:36] that's what that's why that's why God
[1:29:38] God was so upset
[1:29:42] with bell peor with what happened there
[1:29:45] because they married them
[1:29:47] he wasn't upset because they looked and
[1:29:49] they lost it after the women
[1:29:51] he was upset because they took them
[1:29:52] contrary to the word of God brought them
[1:29:55] and then gave seed seed reserved for the
[1:29:59] line of of for the line of Israel seed
[1:30:02] reserved for that and they they gave it
[1:30:03] to those moabites they mixed the word of
[1:30:05] God with man's idea a nation that came
[1:30:09] from fornication that's that's the
[1:30:12] that's the father of the Antichrist is
[1:30:15] fornication
[1:30:16] look what happened with with uh Eve and
[1:30:19] the serpent fornication Eve was reserved
[1:30:22] for Adam Eve was Adam's wife and she
[1:30:25] committed adultery
[1:30:28] with that you'll even see some
[1:30:30] situations where a a person who had
[1:30:33] doesn't uh um say say for example a
[1:30:36] pastor who is not lined up with the word
[1:30:38] of God you can see that Spirit of
[1:30:40] fornication manifest either in him or
[1:30:43] his church
[1:30:44] physically
[1:30:47] so he says okay he says is that right
[1:30:49] you can cross the line the children of
[1:30:51] Israel did in their Journey they cross
[1:30:52] the line which means there's no going
[1:30:54] back but you see that man
[1:30:57] God I just love the word of God it's so
[1:30:59] beautiful because God just takes it and
[1:31:00] he says you know what in two thousand
[1:31:02] three thousand years later there's going
[1:31:04] to be someone who's going to struggle
[1:31:05] with this this this this so I'm going to
[1:31:06] lay it out here and I'm going to bring
[1:31:08] this Edge case we call it
[1:31:10] and I'm going to show hey don't worry
[1:31:12] about that
[1:31:13] the reason they cross the line you say
[1:31:15] well what if I cross the line
[1:31:16] if you're worried about that you haven't
[1:31:18] crossed the line what happened was
[1:31:21] they cross the line because they took
[1:31:22] they crossed the seed
[1:31:25] amen then you see you say okay what kind
[1:31:27] of attributes did they have that man
[1:31:30] brought that woman
[1:31:31] right into the congregation
[1:31:33] all of Israel was weeping before the
[1:31:36] Lord
[1:31:38] asking forgiveness
[1:31:40] not the ones that had taken but asking
[1:31:42] to stay the pestilence from our land
[1:31:44] because of what our brothers did
[1:31:46] and he waltzes in
[1:31:50] with the false word of God
[1:31:52] he's trying to bring it in and what's he
[1:31:54] trying to do Again mix it
[1:31:57] and say look let me sit down with my
[1:32:00] wife mobile wife and be okay in the
[1:32:03] church
[1:32:05] if they would have allowed it
[1:32:08] the pest the plague would have continued
[1:32:10] to Ravish their their people
[1:32:14] that's the problem
[1:32:16] is
[1:32:18] I think you can fill in the blanks there
[1:32:19] but that's why marriage and divorce is
[1:32:21] so important that's right
[1:32:23] because God marriage is God's
[1:32:26] if I can say this other Cardinal way
[1:32:29] it's his thing
[1:32:31] that's what he's all about amen
[1:32:33] because you can't deny that seed
[1:32:36] if a woman gets if my when my wife got
[1:32:39] pregnant with our first child
[1:32:41] there was nothing she could do to say
[1:32:43] that child wasn't mine
[1:32:46] nothing
[1:32:48] why today when we have the full open
[1:32:50] Word of God do we also have DNA testing
[1:32:52] why
[1:32:53] God showing natural types of spiritual
[1:32:57] you cannot deny it
[1:32:59] you cannot deny it
[1:33:01] amen praise the Lord so
[1:33:05] he says
[1:33:06] um
[1:33:07] marry one another we should do this and
[1:33:09] Moses had told them different so the
[1:33:11] message said otherwise
[1:33:13] and seeing God Vindicated
[1:33:16] so Moses told them different God
[1:33:18] Vindicated Moses's word
[1:33:21] because Balaam seemed to be more a more
[1:33:23] instructive man
[1:33:25] than Moses was see he had come from a
[1:33:27] great nation where there was great
[1:33:28] people was all organized together the
[1:33:30] land of Moab you see Israel the true
[1:33:33] church is living out of tense
[1:33:35] went into slavery had all these problems
[1:33:37] as a nation and here is Moab all set up
[1:33:40] fancy
[1:33:41] living their life they look like they
[1:33:43] had their act together
[1:33:47] I know I've said this before but it's
[1:33:49] just one of my my favorites if Mary
[1:33:52] walked through the church doors today
[1:33:54] pregnant would you believe her
[1:33:59] Moab God doesn't do things the way we
[1:34:01] think he should
[1:34:03] God doesn't do things the way we think
[1:34:04] he should
[1:34:06] and sometimes we miss it
[1:34:08] but
[1:34:09] if we stay close to him
[1:34:12] if we stay close to him that's why you
[1:34:14] know what any sermon that's preached me
[1:34:15] Brother David brother Paul you go travel
[1:34:17] somewhere else but the berry wherever
[1:34:19] you go it can all boil down to two
[1:34:21] things
[1:34:24] devotions and prayer
[1:34:29] my wife and I we can we can make money
[1:34:32] we can travel the world we can go over
[1:34:34] here and go over there
[1:34:36] but if we don't have conversation
[1:34:39] and time together there's no
[1:34:42] relationship she might reap the benefits
[1:34:44] of my wallet
[1:34:48] but there's no relationship unless we
[1:34:50] have conversation
[1:34:52] and we have time together
[1:34:54] that's why in any sermon any is remember
[1:34:56] the Brandon priest can boil down to
[1:34:58] those two things devotion and prayer
[1:35:01] that's why they're fundamentally that's
[1:35:04] where your relationship with God is
[1:35:05] built upon amen
[1:35:07] that's where it starts
[1:35:09] I've told the class this
[1:35:11] Sunday morning the youth
[1:35:14] you it's not like
[1:35:17] well today I just didn't get to it no
[1:35:20] you know what
[1:35:22] by God's grace I've learned maybe my
[1:35:25] morning started out like the other
[1:35:26] morning I was up till the other day I
[1:35:28] was up till midnight working and I my
[1:35:30] wife comes in I said she let me sleep
[1:35:32] and and I rolled out of bed right into a
[1:35:34] meeting I didn't have a choice so I
[1:35:36] stopped
[1:35:37] when I could and I said God forgive me
[1:35:40] and I took time with him
[1:35:42] that's how important it is you're gonna
[1:35:43] say oh well I didn't get to it today
[1:35:45] you have to do it
[1:35:47] it's not you can't miss a day
[1:35:51] you do you wonder what why aren't happy
[1:35:54] why you're grumpy we have this joke in
[1:35:56] my in my in my in our house
[1:35:58] we will ask each other you and Kristen
[1:36:00] well did you read your Bible today no I
[1:36:03] didn't that's all told me you go go to
[1:36:05] your room I watch the kid you go read
[1:36:07] your Bible
[1:36:08] that it's unimportant
[1:36:11] the battle is so hot today the battle is
[1:36:14] so hot today so we have to keep on the
[1:36:17] firing line we've got to keep our sword
[1:36:20] we've got to keep our relationship with
[1:36:22] Christ
[1:36:23] amen
[1:36:29] the land of Moab great armies great
[1:36:31] things that the people in them days
[1:36:32] would have feared and here come a
[1:36:33] prophet down a prophet anointed one
[1:36:35] false anointed one see it's not just the
[1:36:38] anointing
[1:36:39] it's not just the anointing the only
[1:36:41] thing is important and everything is
[1:36:43] needed but we can't just focus on the
[1:36:45] anointing that's why brother random
[1:36:46] preached the message false anointed ones
[1:36:49] you know what if you have a question
[1:36:51] about something you know what I do I
[1:36:54] open the table app and I'll search
[1:36:55] sermons I'll put in one word like say
[1:36:58] um the other day what was it the other
[1:37:00] day I don't remember but it was
[1:37:01] something you know let's just say for
[1:37:03] example if I could think of one you
[1:37:05] could say well
[1:37:06] um
[1:37:07] transformation we want to be we want to
[1:37:09] be transformed not conformed what does
[1:37:11] that mean you type in the word transform
[1:37:13] and you'll find sermons
[1:37:15] or search what I'll do is I'll get the
[1:37:17] table and I'll search a line or
[1:37:19] something and I'll look for a sermon
[1:37:20] where he says that a bunch of times and
[1:37:22] I'll listen to that sermon
[1:37:23] God has given us all we need
[1:37:27] everything we need it's right there and
[1:37:28] he's given us the ability to find it
[1:37:34] because Balaam okay we'll get through
[1:37:36] this quote I promise
[1:37:38] see come down to be the to be to an
[1:37:41] anointed one taught the people and many
[1:37:43] of them went after that don't you never
[1:37:45] forget that see went after the thing
[1:37:47] that wasn't the word the Vindicated
[1:37:49] proven word
[1:37:51] it sounded right but it wasn't the word
[1:37:55] so
[1:37:57] praise the Lord now uh we're closing
[1:38:00] here shortly the revelation of Jesus
[1:38:02] Christ now remember this Christ in the
[1:38:04] true church is the continuation of the
[1:38:06] book of Acts what does that mean well we
[1:38:08] can look to the book of Acts for an
[1:38:09] example of how we should be
[1:38:11] but the Book of Revelation shows that
[1:38:14] how that Antichrist Spirit would come
[1:38:16] into the church and defile it would come
[1:38:19] which means today it's happening
[1:38:22] and defile it making it lukewarm formal
[1:38:25] and Powerless
[1:38:28] Aiken
[1:38:30] in the camp
[1:38:33] making the church lukewarm formal and
[1:38:36] Powerless formal that's
[1:38:38] religious
[1:38:41] oh man
[1:38:43] we make fun and we say that some people
[1:38:45] might say it that way that's not what
[1:38:46] I'm talking about I'm talking about dry
[1:38:49] you say brother Chris you just talked
[1:38:50] about it it's not emotions
[1:38:53] you see why it's all things in balance
[1:38:55] there's even there's even laws in this
[1:38:57] in the new in the Old Testament the
[1:38:59] levitical law where it says don't have
[1:39:01] unbalanced weights in your bags
[1:39:03] that's how much God loves balance amen
[1:39:07] amen that's how much he loves balance so
[1:39:10] formally we don't want to be formal and
[1:39:12] Powerless or lukewarm it exposes Satan
[1:39:16] the revelation of Christ exposes Satan
[1:39:19] revealing his works this is a very
[1:39:21] familiar quote I I would hope so anyways
[1:39:23] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:39:24] and the discrediting of God's word so
[1:39:27] undermining well the pastor that's just
[1:39:30] his opinion
[1:39:32] don't ever take somebody's word for
[1:39:34] something
[1:39:35] go find it in the Bible
[1:39:37] you know
[1:39:39] our pastor sometimes says don't read
[1:39:41] ahead and in a sense you know when he's
[1:39:43] when he's preaching
[1:39:45] as as a as a church we ought to already
[1:39:47] be
[1:39:48] catching what he's what's coming next
[1:39:50] because we're in the word we know where
[1:39:53] he's going we and we say Amen you know
[1:39:55] what an amen from somebody who knows
[1:39:56] where you're going as a minister I'm
[1:39:57] going to say this an amen from somebody
[1:39:59] who knows where you're going really has
[1:40:01] a punch to it but anyone amen from
[1:40:03] somebody who's just
[1:40:05] oh cool right but when they know where
[1:40:07] you're going it has a special anointing
[1:40:09] to it it has a punch to it amen you want
[1:40:12] to get the devil a big black guy amen
[1:40:15] revealing his Works attempted
[1:40:17] destruction right down to the time he is
[1:40:18] cast into the Lake of Fire so he's not
[1:40:20] gonna stop until he's destroyed for good
[1:40:21] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:40:24] knows that the people get the true
[1:40:26] revelation of the true church and what
[1:40:29] she is what she stands for that she can
[1:40:31] do the Greater Works she will be an
[1:40:34] invincible Army if they get a
[1:40:36] tribulation of the two Spirits within
[1:40:37] the framework of the Christian church
[1:40:39] are we in the Christian church today
[1:40:42] yes we are the two spirits in the
[1:40:44] framework of the Christian church and by
[1:40:46] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:40:49] Antichrist spirit
[1:40:52] how do you withstand it by God's spirit
[1:40:56] through discernment
[1:40:59] Satan will be powerless before her
[1:41:03] he will be as definitely thwarted today
[1:41:05] as when Christ withstood his every
[1:41:07] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:41:10] desert
[1:41:11] why does he use that example
[1:41:14] there's lots of others examples why did
[1:41:17] he use that example
[1:41:18] because Christ didn't call fire from
[1:41:20] heaven Jesus she just didn't use some
[1:41:23] kind of special power he's quoted his
[1:41:27] own word
[1:41:30] and tell you well you know this is
[1:41:34] this is the thing in like the fitness
[1:41:36] industry right oh yeah this is how I got
[1:41:38] so jacked
[1:41:40] and all they're doing is giving you
[1:41:44] they're telling you that so you'll buy
[1:41:45] their program but how they really got
[1:41:47] jacked is a totally different story
[1:41:51] I don't know where I was going with that
[1:41:55] oh but when they when they used but when
[1:41:58] so when Jesus says look fight the enemy
[1:42:00] with his word with the word of God find
[1:42:02] any with the word of God then if you
[1:42:03] went to Desert and fought the Devil by
[1:42:05] calling fire from heaven how could we
[1:42:07] trust him
[1:42:08] but he said fight the Devil with the
[1:42:10] word of God then when he came on Earth
[1:42:12] and he was put to that same test
[1:42:14] he did the exact same thing amen
[1:42:17] you want to see how to be successful you
[1:42:20] know you have different situations or
[1:42:22] you know you want to see how to be a
[1:42:23] successful Christian watch successful
[1:42:25] Christians
[1:42:28] and follow after after them
[1:42:31] which in turn will cause you to follow
[1:42:33] after Christ I hope you understand what
[1:42:34] I'm saying
[1:42:35] so
[1:42:37] praise the lord we watch the people we
[1:42:40] watch the word of God that talks to talk
[1:42:43] and walks the walk that's right both of
[1:42:45] those things amen musicians want to come
[1:42:48] tonight I don't want to hold you late on
[1:42:49] a Wednesday night
[1:42:52] um
[1:42:53] never thought I had that problem Brother
[1:42:54] David if they get a true revelation of
[1:42:57] the two Spirits then the framework of
[1:42:58] the Christian Church By God's spirit
[1:42:59] desert and withstand the Antichrist
[1:43:01] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:43:02] her he will be thwarted okay yes Satan
[1:43:05] hates Revelation but we love it with
[1:43:08] true Revelation in our lives the Gates
[1:43:10] of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[1:43:13] will prevail over them the Gates of Hell
[1:43:16] might be present in your home tonight
[1:43:20] but you can prevail by God's word and
[1:43:23] sometimes the word of God just takes
[1:43:26] physical application
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:32] you may find this interesting you can
[1:43:34] just
[1:43:36] take it for what it's worth
[1:43:38] sugar negatively affects me and my kids
[1:43:41] so we try to keep
[1:43:42] sugar out of the house because if it's
[1:43:45] out of the house
[1:43:46] I'm not gonna eat it it's easy
[1:43:49] I have no temptation if you're tempted
[1:43:52] with high heels just take them out of
[1:43:55] the house even if you're like huh but I
[1:43:58] paid 150 bucks for these
[1:44:01] just get them out of the house even if
[1:44:03] you don't feel like it
[1:44:05] even if you don't feel like it and then
[1:44:06] maybe you go and you buy another pair
[1:44:08] maybe you did that and you bought
[1:44:10] another pair and you're here tonight
[1:44:12] just do it again
[1:44:14] and eventually God will take that desire
[1:44:16] from you God will show you and give you
[1:44:19] discernment
[1:44:20] amen praise the Lord
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:25] but saints of God
[1:44:27] the story doesn't end there
[1:44:30] God loves a conjunction
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:33] and but
[1:44:36] what was where was Abraham when all this
[1:44:39] chaos was happening to lot and his
[1:44:43] family in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:44:46] oh yeah he was on the back side of the
[1:44:48] desert
[1:44:49] In the Heat of the day
[1:44:56] but he was with God
[1:44:59] you see let's back this hole up we
[1:45:01] talked about how you can avoid becoming
[1:45:03] like lot
[1:45:05] when you're in that situation
[1:45:07] a saints of God we are much better off
[1:45:09] when we never even go there
[1:45:12] if Allah would have never went to Sodom
[1:45:14] he would never have to go through any of
[1:45:16] that
[1:45:17] right but he went to saw him
[1:45:22] in your life in your families
[1:45:24] sometimes there's an opportunity to do
[1:45:26] something
[1:45:28] I believe the ash Downs are annoying I'm
[1:45:31] not saying move right I'm not talking
[1:45:33] about them so don't get that idea in
[1:45:34] your head but there's something you're
[1:45:36] going to do stop and pray about it
[1:45:39] you say it can be as simple as
[1:45:42] well do we want to let you know are our
[1:45:45] kids
[1:45:45] uh participate in this certain activity
[1:45:49] because you know physical energy and
[1:45:51] exercise that's all very important so
[1:45:53] there's certain things but you but says
[1:45:55] we would get in less trouble if we would
[1:45:57] pray about every decision we make
[1:45:59] every decision so if lot would have
[1:46:02] stopped and said
[1:46:03] you know I'm going to pray about this
[1:46:04] Abraham I appreciate the offer um let me
[1:46:06] take a few minutes to go pray he would
[1:46:09] have not went down to Sodom
[1:46:11] it doesn't matter what it is but
[1:46:14] especially if it's something that's
[1:46:15] going to now involve your family in
[1:46:17] something stop and pray say God is this
[1:46:20] the right thing to do amen
[1:46:22] is this you what
[1:46:26] and it could be something that's that's
[1:46:27] good
[1:46:29] but is it taking time away from what's
[1:46:31] important
[1:46:35] I've had you know we we did we did a
[1:46:37] t-ball with with my my son and I coached
[1:46:40] it and everything
[1:46:42] but and some people are going to maybe
[1:46:45] judge this
[1:46:46] but I said
[1:46:49] we stopped it after that and I said I
[1:46:51] don't want to do that again
[1:46:53] it was fine it's t-ball it's it's
[1:46:56] hilarious
[1:46:58] right but why get him involved in
[1:47:02] something 10 years down the road it's
[1:47:04] going to become a burden
[1:47:07] that he's going to have to break
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:11] sure go get him into rock climbing go
[1:47:13] get him into hiking and mountain biking
[1:47:14] because they can do that the rest of
[1:47:15] their life
[1:47:17] in something they're going to become so
[1:47:19] taken with
[1:47:21] that they become a teenager now they
[1:47:22] have to fight that
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:26] we heard something just a while back in
[1:47:28] a sermon our pastor's Ministry talked
[1:47:29] about fishing and hunting people can get
[1:47:32] out of balance with those but that's
[1:47:33] something you can do the rest of your
[1:47:34] life and actually
[1:47:37] greater connected with God
[1:47:40] see what I'm talking about it's physical
[1:47:42] applications it's things that you do
[1:47:44] music
[1:47:46] right before you do things with music
[1:47:48] say is this what I want my kids to to
[1:47:50] play sure there's certain things you
[1:47:54] know like like Beethoven right that's
[1:47:55] not bad
[1:47:57] that's not a Christian song Christian
[1:47:59] music but it's not bad it's Beethoven
[1:48:01] it's Symphony
[1:48:03] but watch be careful that that doesn't
[1:48:05] lead your children deeper because you
[1:48:08] have the Holy Spirit you have
[1:48:09] discernment but do your kids and say
[1:48:12] well we can listen to Beethoven and
[1:48:13] that's not a Christian song why can't we
[1:48:15] listen to this and I'm not talking
[1:48:16] against Beethoven I hope you can have
[1:48:18] this room I understand what I'm saying
[1:48:20] watch where something's going to lead
[1:48:22] your family
[1:48:23] Look Down the Road God has given us that
[1:48:26] eagle anointing in this day and age to
[1:48:28] look down the road say God give me
[1:48:30] wisdom look down lord is this a good
[1:48:31] thing to do is this what I should be
[1:48:33] allowing and you young people
[1:48:35] different things in your life that you
[1:48:37] enjoy look down the road and say can I
[1:48:39] is this something that is sustainable as
[1:48:41] a Christian
[1:48:42] down the road
[1:48:44] it's not sustainable to eat McDonald's
[1:48:45] every day
[1:48:47] but uh Big Mac or a Double Quarter
[1:48:50] Pounder with cheese is okay once in a
[1:48:52] while
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:55] it's not sustainable long term
[1:48:57] you will die physically
[1:49:00] a painful death
[1:49:02] spiritually
[1:49:03] you see what I'm saying it's things that
[1:49:05] you start now that aren't contrary to
[1:49:07] the word of God but look into the future
[1:49:09] where is it going to take you
[1:49:13] what is going to happen you say a little
[1:49:15] split is okay but where does a little
[1:49:17] split take you down the road but the
[1:49:19] runner said split no he didn't say well
[1:49:22] this long or this long or this short he
[1:49:24] said split so then where does that take
[1:49:26] you down the road say well I have
[1:49:28] spirits of discernment I can stop at a
[1:49:29] certain point but what about your
[1:49:30] children how far is it going to take it
[1:49:34] rough
[1:49:36] hey man that's powerheads
[1:49:39] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:49:42] I trust your people tonight would
[1:49:43] receive your word I
[1:49:47] you know My Heart Lord Jesus said let's
[1:49:50] pray you just come Lord we love you Lord
[1:49:53] and we want to serve you and we're
[1:49:54] living in a dangerous time God where
[1:49:56] sometimes we have to say these things
[1:49:58] just straight
[1:50:01] but God I know the true elect of God
[1:50:02] will receive it Lord
[1:50:04] I don't have to worry about the rest
[1:50:08] but got a desire to see everyone come
[1:50:10] higher I desire myself my wife my
[1:50:13] children for us to come higher up
[1:50:15] other things that are are okay but but
[1:50:18] take us from you
[1:50:20] that pull us from holiness
[1:50:23] other things in our life that that are
[1:50:25] that are going to be stumbling blocks in
[1:50:27] two years two months
[1:50:30] Lord help us father
[1:50:32] to have discernment to look down ahead
[1:50:35] and time to plan for the future
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:39] we don't spend all our paycheck as we
[1:50:41] know down a couple of weeks we're going
[1:50:42] to have bills to pay God life is always
[1:50:45] calling on on us to pay dues probably
[1:50:48] want to have you there
[1:50:50] to raise that standard which is us up to
[1:50:53] meet that
[1:50:54] I pray Lord that your words would just
[1:50:57] be accepted tonight Lord I thought that
[1:50:59] we could open our arms as Mary did on
[1:51:01] that day
[1:51:02] and say beat unto me according to your
[1:51:04] word
[1:51:05] it's painful sometimes to apply the word
[1:51:10] apply the word Lord and you stretch your
[1:51:12] arms out on the cross and you took the
[1:51:13] pain
[1:51:14] because you were keeping your word
[1:51:17] God we want to keep your word too
[1:51:19] whether it means being crucified by our
[1:51:21] friends our family
[1:51:23] our closest
[1:51:25] family our closest friend moving him lay
[1:51:28] our desires on the cross
[1:51:31] surrender to you no matter what you call
[1:51:34] upon us to do we will be there to answer
[1:51:37] yes Lord a gift
[1:51:40] Jeff the had a word to keep though it
[1:51:43] cost him dearly
[1:51:45] he kept that word help us Lord
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:50] help me Lord
[1:51:53] to be so tied to you
[1:51:56] and even when the preacher preaches
[1:51:57] something to me that's
[1:51:59] verbatim and obvious that I could accept
[1:52:03] it
[1:52:04] and say God forgive me help me to toe
