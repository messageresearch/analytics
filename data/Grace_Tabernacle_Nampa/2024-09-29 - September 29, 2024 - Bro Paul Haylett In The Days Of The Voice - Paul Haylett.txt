you created us father was to make you God to lift you up to worship you to serve you thank you Father we now have freedom and liberty to do that oh how we love you Lord Jesus just ask you to come speak to our hearts today Lord in the times that we live father we certainly cannot live without you lord we ask you come now speak Lord May every need father in the assembly this morning Lord may they just lift it now from their heart and just lay it upon the throne Lord and give it to you Lord that you could be Supreme in our lives father we thank you for your love your grace and mercy oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen want to welcome our visitors God bless you amen and uh I I I think that uh sister Rachel you're no longer a visitor so amen we just accept you as our own Hallelujah quite a little list uh I brother Alex like I didn't remember that list well I wouldn't if it wasn't all written out here but uh we just have a lot of needs you know Satan certainly is just rising up uh he he just wants to hinder he wants to discourage cuz he knows if he can discourage us we will not enter into the promise amen that's what happened many of those in the wilderness they had not sinned they had come to a place of discouragement and quit and now you could say they they did sin because unbelief is sin but still it was a discouragement that brought them to a place they listened to many voices uh you know as it was those ministers that were there in in the body of Israel at that time is just the same as today there was people that respected them they had maybe been a benefit to their life and when Dayan stood up and made his statement and Kora backed it up these people come in a quandry just as they have in this day of who do I believe Moses talks of a promise but what we have as a Wilderness Dayan and Kora are telling us the reality of it but we don't live in that reality we live in the promis and so it was in that promise God said look to me in my promis and you know those voices of that day caused many to get discouraged and step away and so we just want to you know our sister April uh without going into detail here uh you know where she's at you know the labor she's doing her heart desire and and uh so we just want to remember her in prayer uh I as I get older you know I I find myself with less concern about words sometimes and you embarrass or maybe put your foot in your mouth but I I I don't want to do that intentionally uh but sister ulia uh soon uh to uh bring forth a baby into the world to deliver a baby let's lift her up in prayer amen we want to just hear this lovely news of um unnamed baby uh coming healthy and uh sister Julia healthy and and brother Sergey I'm on your team I want you to be healthy amen I made the mistake once of making a statement to my wife right after she'd had a baby that it was just as hard on me as it was on her I've never lived that statement down and uh so uh it is and I see somebody laughing over here that just we don't normally do this but I'll just put it this way 40 years ago I became a father yeah yeah 40 anyway so anyway let's remember the Saints on the East Coast uh many Believers uh just been tremendously impacted uh Brothers sharing pictures um major highway bridges destroyed and Backcountry Road Bridges completely gone as though there was never an Evidence of of a bridge there ever uh so we want to just remember them not just the Believers but mankind amen are there people are suffering people are dying families are affected and just lift them up before the Lord and this morning um uh we had a wonderful opportunity uh even in the sadness of it to to lay our hands on brother Bob what a paradox of life one of the happiest moments in our lives would be to pass in the presence of God and one of the saddest moments is to see a LED one pass but we were there and and um just had that opportunity I I felt encouraged here's a man that has served God more years than the average man lives think about it what a testimony what a testimony our sister Ruth is there with her grandfather today and so just remember Sister Ruth also now uh we have and it's been mostly Paul looking at too many circumstances but we've always uh in the past tried to do communion on the first Sunday of the month and uh trying to get back on track of that why we chose the sixth but we're going to move that to the 13th because there is uh many families a circumstance uh that they will not be here on the 6th so we're going to move communion to October 13th and uh I I say this with a little humor that is set in stone that one's set in stone so communion 5:00 October 13th here at the church amen hallelujah good to be a Christian amen good to know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior Amen to know that your life is in his hand amen we are secure hallelujah hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles I want to speak to you this morning a a title on the days of The Voice and um it's a a lovely time that we get to just look through the scripture we get to see the day that we're living in my brother and sister if you are living there in in a country uh Ukraine Israel uh the ongoing genocides in Africa and these kind of circumstances you wouldn't think that there would be something to be happy about but the scripture tells us that when we see these signs look look up amen we're not to look down not to be frowning not to be discouraged but that's the time to look up and rejoice because the coming of the Lord is near amen and I we're looking for the coming of the lord we we know it's imminent he promised it he never fails a promise amen Hebrews the 3D chapter verses 1-7 and um just uh trust that today just a little something here might stir the hearts of the people amen Hebrews 3 1-7 I love how the word lays things out the small uh I won't get this correct those of you that you know English makes sense to you um but uh I I just love how the word speaks where therefore holy Brethren amen amen not just a bunch of people assembled in a building calling it church but holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who is faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house see we've seen the skewering of Mankind's thinking today my brother and sister in a world the prophet talked about and said that they're building they're talking about the coming of the Lord and building greater and greater and greater and you'll see this right here the counter type of this that they actually are worshiping what they have built amen not worshiping what God is doing but worshiping what they are doing Lord help us not get caught in that amen and is as much as Heath builded the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is God and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we amen oh my this house being built right now Hallelujah the finished work the the final touches are are being placed upon this house amen and it's God doing it if we hold fast confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm Until the End wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if ye will hear his voice amen Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings today in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I just want to put a a little uh statement for things to come here but you know sometimes as we'll look we'll we'll find that we're we're having a question a little Clarity uh is is always good and uh we have questions and one by one God is answering those questions you know the prophet told us if you would put things on the shelf and leave them there till God chooses to answer it and he is answering one by one and we just look forward as the opening of the word is taking us into the final stretch of time my brother and sister I'm sure that you guys uh uh are aware of that that uh you know Russia Putin said um any country that attacks that is a friend of a country with nuclear power it is considered the same and so we're seeing the bars being removed of of the Restriction as it would be to annihilate mankind it will be that we now consider nuclear weapons as a fair weapon to use in defense and my brother and sister we know that it is total Annihilation it is going to upset the very balance of the earth and and it's there and and we could be so worried about that could look at these things and say uh you know my I'm terrified but my brother and sister it don't matter if you're not here that's right and if we are here you got more to worry about than a nuclear weapon so it's there that we look to the one Refuge that we have and that is our Lord Jesus Christ and when we're in Christ my brother and sister I'm not talking about this natural flesh but when we're in Christ we're balm proof amen amen the the devil can drop every nuclear device that he has he can do everything he can but when we are sealed in Christ Jesus amen he cannot get to you he will not destroy you he can try he can afflict you he can do a lot of things my brother and sister but he's already lost and we say thank you Lord amen so it's there I want to go on into acts 22 and we're talking about the voice and here we're looking at Paul in his journey and starting in verse 7 and he said and I fell into the ground and heard a voice saying unto me Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and I answered see he doesn't even know who he's talking to but there was something there he said who art thou Lord giving preeminence already even though he doesn't know exactly what has happened and he said unto me I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest and they that were with me saw saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me oh my brother and sister I hope today we can actually make the emphasis that will touch your heart and I said what shall I do Lord and the Lord said unto me arise and go to Damascus and there it shall be told thee of all the things which are appointed for thee to do you see God already had the list of Paul's future he already had the appointment book had been over opened already and the appointments had been written in the book and and God is now telling him I have this they're going to come and reveal to you of the things you are going to do now my brother and sister I know this is not foreign to us but we are here today and our book has already been appointed amen and we're not looking or hoping I I I read a little deal well I'm just looking and waiting for for what God would write in my book your book is already written amen as Sons and Daughters of God he already knows you he he knows everything about you he's already appointed the time of your birth and he's appointed the time of your death and we say I got saved in this certain year and we understand that but my brother and sister we were in Christ before the foundation of the world there's not a day that I came to him but it was before the foundation of the world how can I write that on a calendar and say I was saved in this day it was manifested in that day but you were already in Christ amen and so you look at this and as Paul is now speaking he's giving this account and I really want to focus there for a moment on verse N9 and they saw the light indeed they saw the light my brother and sister it's easy enough to see the light there's many people they would look and say I acknowledge Jesus Christ as Savior amen I acknowledge Calvary but my brother and sister there was a voice that came with that light and without that voice they had no idea what was going on with Paul amen they saw Paul fall in the dirt blinded they saw Paul there moving entirely from the course that he was in that journey to fulfill he moved he shifted my brotherr entirely and they must have thought what is Paul doing but you see they saw light they saw the gospel as it were they saw all these things they built a church but if the church is not filled amen then it's just a building and so Paul is there and God is speaking to him and Paul makes this acknowledgement in Acts 22 but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me amen aren't you glad today that you can say there's been a voice my brother and sister it's not a voice of this preacher or of that preacher it's not a voice we can say here today and say yes God has sent a messenger into this day my brother and sister but I want to tell you you can hear that voice and you can see light but not hear the voice you need to hear that's it now some people would think that I was on treading on thin ice right there my brother and sister but if everyone had heard the voice was saved today why we'd all have to build a bigger church because there's a lot of people heard the voice but what voice did they here amen if you hear a voice of a man that's good amen it's scriptural the the the five-fold ministry the offices in the church scriptural but if there's not something deeper in there than just hearing that man's voice it has to be that voice that Paul heard amen and acknowledged amen you see you can see the light and have no depth of understanding in other words acknowledge this Bible is true right but no Revelation to live it in hard times no Revelation to live it that's it I'm not talking about the Great Tribulation but no Revelation to live it in Tribulation no Revelation to live it in almost a more difficult time you know what it's almost more difficult than tribulation live it in the time of prosperity that's right exactly right amen amen people call out cry out to God Lord my children are hungry our elders are suffering help us Lord and God come on this scene but where is that voice am when the coffers are full and the food is full and overflowing and prosperity has surrounded us my brother and sister God didn't call the bride of Christ to only hear his voice in in the hard times he called us to hear his voice when we are doing so well financially better than we ever have in our life amen he called for us to still hear that voice amen that's right desperation my brother and sister brings desperation but what does prosperity bring lukewarm Church lukewarm Believers so they see the light but there's no depth of understanding you don't see a one of those called and revealed to them what their calling was amen just Paul amen but they could testify I saw the light and you could create a whole church a whole movement a whole religion out of I saw the light that's it that's exactly right but where's the voice that's it right exactly got to be a voice amen amen because you see when it comes my brother and sister each one could interpret the light according to what they saw some might describe it as a glow some might say it's an orb some might say it's this and say that my brother and sister but when a voice speaks to you that voice speaks to you amen you will know who you are in Jesus Christ amen there'll be no question there won't be no man interpret that to you if it will be God himself interpreting to you his voice calling you amen amen now we live in a day so many voices if you don't think so just go on the internet you know it just do a little bit of research and type in the right words into something like YouTube and they'll come up and there'll be somebody that that um I don't want to go too deep or get negative on that but you know this person will say God spoke to me but everything about their life and their demeanor is contrary to the word that's it right contrary to the voice and they say God spoke to me and revealing and you know what's interesting is when they speak and they say this is going to happen on this day it shakes people up the people listening to that voice get All Shook Up but those days those times those events pass without being fulfilled and nobody they shrug their shoulder because as you see they've saw light but there's no real voice behind it they want they want my brother and sister but can't really understand that's right but there's a still Small Voice that comes that voice doesn't have to quote Doctrine to you it doesn't have to be deep subjects my brother and sister that voice when it just comes in a midnight hour and says you are my own amen amen you're mine I purchased you and there does something that just settles in the heart and soul that when hard times come you can say I Heard a Voice that told me who I am it wasn't the pastor that told me it wasn't the Evangelist that told me it was God himself speaking to me and I know who I am and I will stand amen amen some people say that sounds boastful but my brother and sister when you heard the voice you know you will stand you're not going to falter and fall away you know that it's God dealing with you amen amen there was so many voices they're calling come calling come I've shared it here in the church before down where my son lives my son even though he claims no no real claim to be serving God right now but I tell you what he can't outrun this the scripture that's right he was raised correct that's right it was taught to him it was placed in position in his life and what's amazing to me is he'll tell me on the phone Dad I was talking to this man over here and he made a statement and I said you got a Bible Well no I don't well I've got one on my phone here let me just show you what there the scripture what it really says and and it's interesting right someone who says I I'm not even I'm not really serving God right now you know I know that and I know I should but I'm not and yet something in him will not let uh uh those things that are not true Prevail he has a friend the man attends a mega church when I talk about Mega I'm talking Mega amen and there's lots of attention placed on on churches in Arizona I mean in Texas and what of Mega but these churches are everywhere my brother and sister some just don't want a great profile but you know if you're going to pick a church without knowing the voice then pick one that's got a soccer team a baseball team a basketball team a football team a golf team a tennis team and a dance yeah you see if you're not going to have truth then go for everything that's represented sounds harsh to some doesn't it but find a golf club in the Bible find the evidence of knowing god because you can bowl a perfect 300 yeah see none of that is even relevant to the gospel it's just a matter of attraction amen amen I don't want to go down that road but see there's a lot of voices some calling saying come and others saying stay and and voices that approved Paul's persecution of the church and no doubt voices that said Lord why is Paul persecuting us Saul persecuting us but you see one day because God is faithful can someone lift a hand and say because God is faithful I Heard a Voice one day that spoke not to my ears but to my heart and my soul because my God is faithful amen he wouldn't leave us begging bread my brother and sister he wouldn't offer us a stone because he is faithful amen amen and one day because God is faithful he was faithful to Paul but he was being faithful to you and I also because the very gospel that he gave to Paul that changed Paul's life revelated Paul gave Paul a bold approach to preach the gospel under persecution was our gospel my brother and sister and God said I'm faithful to you Generations a on a time down the road I'm faithful to you because I'm going to give you a word that stands this test amen amen but they didn't hear God's words to Paul because they couldn't I want to know does it break your heart when you witness to friends you've known for decades yes and they look you in the face and say you know I've seen you change but I just don't get what you see that's it breaks your heart friends that over time turn maybe a tad bit mocking hey preacher Paul what's happening now well last I knew you had a Bible in your house and I don't want to sound like I'm being mocking but you have a Bible in your house if You' read it you know what's happening right now it's right there it's in that book amen it's revealed but you see while they can't hear God's voice to you they cannot hear God's voice I mean God's voice to Paul they can't hear God's voice to you amen you see it's the same circumstance now I want to just this might sound uh like I've went off a left hook here do you know modern medicine has proven how important hearing is to us yes Alzheimer's dementia many other things are all connected to the hearing amen and so when your hearing diminishes I hope you you don't mind just a moment of humor sister Jerry leaned on me very hard here couple years ago and uh I do have a little something you know it's kind of like turning Reverb or something up on my left ear but I went to the hearing doctor and did all these tests and he says Paul's hearing is just fine now this ear doesn't hear the same as this ear if I have a preference I want you to talk to my right ear but he turned to Jerry I found great humor in this I hope you don't mind but he turned to Sister Jerry and said there's nothing wrong with your husband's hearing he just can't hear you and then he said it's a man thing but you see did you know because I've been through this experienced it personally vertigo is not a heart issue vertigo is not uh you know an arthritis or a this or that vertigo is a hearing issue that's right because your hearing has been impaired by various things and your balance is therefore hear me well please and just think spiritually your balance is connected to your hearing amen and we wonder why the churches are out of balance my brother and sister because they're not hearing the word of God Amen they're hearing voices educated voices articulate voices voices that are powerful but they're not really hearing the voice and their balance is out because their hearing is out amen and so it's there that we now have so many conditions in the church today is because there's no balance because there's no correct hearing amen and mental health believe this or not people want to shove mental health under the carpet somewhere and act like it don't exist my brother and sister we'll get if the Lord will get me there we'll get there to understand how this comes my brother and sister mental health today many facets of mental health are connected with hearing amen amen and look where the church is at we can be what we want to be we can name ourselves we can do this and God doesn't care that's because they're not hearing amen because he's already spoke his word and his word says and to a real believer a real Christian that word is absolute and when you hear that word something in you says amen that's what God wants but if your hearing is not hearing that's it correctly amen Mental Health you know what the prophet said about all the pills to wake up pills to go to sleep just go find you a a health journal and read it staggering numbers of people exist by something to wake up and something to go to sleep exactly right we're not speaking don't misunderstand me I'm not speaking down on that that's right but it just shows you the day the time the place that we're coming to amen amen and did you know that social health is also connected to our hearing yes sir amen how you feel in a group of people and because I know that I do have some some kind of hearing thing I hear uh correctly in that and pass all the hearing tests but you know you feel a little bit out when we have a fellowship or we are somewhere and you're constant L asking people will you repeat that yeah what did you say becomes maybe not to them but to you it becomes a stigma amen you know so what you do you know this is why sometimes you might say man why did he nod his head yes to that that's because your response when you didn't understand and you don't want to embarrass yourself you just exactly right that color looks ugly on you yeah cuz we want to get away from the stigma so they say fake it till you make it until yeah you can't fake it anymore and I'll tell you what faking it till you make it there was a missionary went to China many many years ago he was trying to to uh uh evangelize the Chinese and and he was a very smart articulate man and he thought he was catching the words and they're on a rooftop and and he he's pretty sure he's got the words correctly and he just keeps repeating these words because what he thought it meant uh uh was would be beneficial for the people to respond to and and so he just keeps repeating these words and and these Chinese are looking at each other and finally two of them stood up and threw him off the roof and when he come climbing back up the stairs what did you do that for you told us to so it can become a stigma yeah let me give you a brief example be therefore holy yeah because I am Holy but if you don't hear that correctly your version of Holiness is not going to match God's version of Holiness and we could offer up many many many examples my brother and sister but we're not here I don't want to be sounding judgmental today maybe maybe strong or a little forceful but not judgmental amen amen but you see when we take this in the spiritual realm the word of God says Revelation comes by hearing that's right and if you don't hear where's your Revelation that's right what are you going to do when God wants to speak to you but you can't hear right or we interpret what we heard Romans 101 12-18 there's no difference Jew and Greek the same Lord overall is Rich unto all that call upon Him amen Lord amen we're here today to call upon you amen we're not going to stand here and act Pious and we're not going to stand here and act like we are some kind of special the only reason we would be special is because God made us special amen for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved thank you Lord how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him in whom they have not heard Hallelujah see there's got to be a hearing first for there to be a response yes my brother and sister I'm trying to be concise lots of things going through my head I'm sorry whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher you know there's certain doctrines out there that you wonder how they're going down the path they're going down it's because they won't listen to the preacher we don't need him any longer oh did I step off into something that's too squishy for us and how shall they preach except they be sent and it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace being Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our report so then verse 17 our real goal here so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God amen amen we can preach anybody we want to preach into heaven you can declare oh God loves you John 3:16 you can lay all of this out my brother and sister but unless God speaks John 3:16 to them it's just a scriptures a preacher spoke and made them feel good I want God to speak to you and I today and every day lip to ear that there is no interpretation and no misunderstanding of exactly what he is saying to us amen are we okay Amen in the resume of the ages so we conclude the seven Church ages saying only what the spirit said to each age God I love how this all ties together amen God doesn't have to cut the string to wrap it all up amen he just takes it and he puts it in the right place and takes it around until it's all brought together in continuity but he said un age he that hath an ear amen it doesn't say to him that hath an eye or him that hath a hand or him that hath ha an ear Amen Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truth of the ages but he has been Faithfully dealing with hearts that they may turn to him amen right let me tell you I got in tears sorry this might be a little bit much but I got in tears you see in my life starting 15 years old I always put a carrot out on the end of the stick and I said when this happens in my life I'll serve you Lord one of those come that when my dear little daughter is born Lord I'll serve you not too hard to do the math at a point but did you know my beautiful daughter being born didn't do one thing to Paul every problem I had was still there and yet I had told God when my daughter is born I'm going to get faithful and serve you Lord my brother and sister I don't know how many carrots you got on your stick but it's time to get rid of them amen and if you can't quite reach the carrot to get rid of it then start whittling on your stick amen and when you get the stick down to where you can take those carrots and make a salad out of them amen and simply make your mind up I was called to serve God I will serve God I don't need a stick and I don't need a carrot amen we get all kinds of excuses well when I get a little older Lord when I get this and when this happens and whatever happens over here I'll do it then Lord my brother and sister the word has called called for us when we hear the word and we acknowledge the word we are called to do the word amen when we know to do and won't do it we have iniquity in our life amen and let's just Purge that iniquity that's right amen let's just get that out of the way amen I believe the spirit of God's been speaking to us not only teaching us the truth of the ages but he has been Faithfully dealing with hearts Can someone say Amen that they may turn to him that is the reason for all the preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the Sheep see the scripture backs it up and says we don't live by sight that's exactly right CU if we're living by sight my brother and sister I'm going to say God bless you all today and I'm going to go home and I'm going to go to bed because this boy's exhausted and all I see in front of me is more exhaustion and so I need my sleep more than I need anything else but I'll tell you what does away with exhaustion is the presence of the holy spirit amen when you have God dealing with you whether it's in the cab of your truck in your car in your tractor uh wherever it's at when God is present my brother and sister there's no such thing as exhaustion there's inspiration there's anointing there's Revelation but not exhaustion amen amen God knows how to deal with that so if you're suffering from exhaustion today in that s amen what you need to do is just get in the presence of God and let him the Prince of Peace amen will take away everything that's keeping you from accomplishing amen but he's been Faithfully dealing with hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all the preaching teaching for is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the Sheep that's me that's it can someone say that's me amen hallelujah you got to identify with it amen this isn't to look down the Pew to see if there's a sheep on your PE amen and is not to be like greedy and say I'm the only sheep on the Pew but for us to recognize that we are part of a body that's right they hear the voice of God hear the voice of God and follow him for not one moment this is a very familiar uh quote it's been used for a lot of different reasons not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I've never done that and never will do that now amen amen isn't that incredible I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people now look I I I'm just going to Bear my heart maybe speak a little bold I have no other I have no other reason myself personally to be here my brother and sister I have never thought that I could attain some status or some kind of privilege or something by doing this when God caught my heart amen when God spoke spoke to me and I started to realize who I was and why I faced the battle I faced is because Satan hated me because he saw who I was when I couldn't see who I was he saw who you are when you couldn't see who you are and he's fought you over that he's gave you complexes over that he's hindered you over that robbed your confidence over that because if he could do that you'll never step out and take a hold of that promise you'll never go there and stand boldly Before the Throne of God if you're not sure who you are but when you know that God called you before the foundation of the world there's no devil in hell is going to be able to keep you from coming to your promise Hallelujah that's right Allelujah Hallelujah one thing I can accomplish this one thing I'll be Satisfied that one thing is is he established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become new cre creations in Christ filled with his Spirit live according to his word I would invite takes a voice plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time yield your life completely to him that's it that's it my brother and sister the scripture says a double-minded man yes sir I'm not going to identify with that I'm not going to be wavering like the sea my brother and sister that one day I'm I'm a Son of God and the next day I don't even know what I'm doing here I'm going to stand here and say you know what the word says He said that he would call his own he wouldn't lose a one he would not forsake us I stand on that promise call me a fool that's fine amen amen I'll be a happy one amen amen sorry to sound strident I'm just it's just bubbling inside of me am plead and warn to hear his voice yield your lives completely even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him that's it God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart amen you know it's an amazing thing I've met in the last couple years several people that opened up not old people either and we'll tell you I'm afraid of dying yes sir only one reason to be afraid of dying yes sir is that you're not a new creation in Christ that's exactly right and when you're New Creation from Christ you can say thank you Lord for the promotion yes sir thank you Lord for just bringing me into your presence there's nothing to be afraid of amen hallelujah now let's move on here isn't time so fleeting it is I'm going to get brother Isaac to wire up all the clocks so I can adjust them up here amen we should have an appreciation for Spiritual ears you know that yes sir I think every one of us ought to just stop and say you know what thank you Lord yes sir that that I I can hear that I hear your word and it it's not just hearing words as words but you're hearing Christ himself which is the word so I know this might sound a little crazy but imagine we actually have the opportunity to just sit down and say Lord can I talk to you for a moment it Am Lord I'm discouraged today I woke up feeling weak and it's not got any better I don't know if I can make it to the end of the day Lord you know preachers are supposed to always sound like they're the most spiritual in the building maybe it's not the place to talk about carnal things but as humans yeah things happen and one minute you're happy and then next you feel crushed now we can do a lot of things to try and get over that that's why beer wine whiskey all of that kind of stuff they're selling more of it than ever in history because people are coming to the place they're crushed of the stories we could tell oh yes but you're there in the moment and a voice says I am your Refuge that's I am your peace that's it amen come to me that's it amen amen and at the end of the day my brother and sister everything everything is taken care of now when I use the phrase at the end of the day it might not be the end of that 24 hours but at the end of the day God's took care of every drop of it amen you see God knows what he's doing our biggest problem is I I don't know take it any way you please okay I don't mean that aggressively but if you don't want to trust God then don't trust him that's it but don't open your mouth and complain either amen amen that's the trth that's exactly right either trust him that's it or go I don't know yeah one or the other that's it oh boy Hallelujah that's good hopefully I'm not insulting anybody amen we need to have an appreciation for God's blessings to us right amen you know we live in an age of counterfeit religion yes sir we do my brother and sister church after church after church is trying to outdo the next church until now we have zip lines and we have theaters and we have all kinds of nonsense we have marching bands like you would expect to see I'm talking about you know the little boots and the little short thing and they're doing their thing in the church it's not a house of God anymore it's a house of Hollywood exactly amen and so it's there in that realm my brother and sister counterfeit amen amen look what the word of God said about uh uh uh Ahab and Jezebel amen they had uh you know well not Jezebel but Ahab had good roots raised in church let me shift gears a little bit how many's happy that the Lord has brought the carcass to you amen amen cuz where the carcass is the eagle will be gathered amen and God was gracious enough to you and I to bring the carcass to us and placed it right in our laps place it right in our presence and then anointed the seed that was in there to take a bite out of the carcass not to just say that looks like the carcass not to take someone's word that's the carcass but to anoint you and I to go and take a bite out of their carcass and when we took that bite we found something so irresistible in us that we had to take another bite amen hallelujah amen exactly I've decided you know Sister Jerry sorry to throw you on the bus honey but sister Jerry's always like I don't make pies because Paul eats the whole pie well if it didn't taste so good I wouldn't eat the whole pie amen I'm just following an instinct eat it because it's good and when the caret was there and God put that anointing in your heart you took one bite you had to take another bite you had to take another bite and you couldn't stop eating and when you thought you would pick that carcass right down to the bone another carcass appears Hallelujah and then when we take a bite out of that one it's there and it's coming and we're raising up we're raising up and we're doing and pretty soon my brother and sister we realize our life is not in us our life is in the carcass hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my Hallelujah that's right I want to ask you a question here and then we're going to close cut man out of this I tell you my brother and sister I don't know I just maybe I got a complex when something happens something good happens people say oh brother Paul Brother David brother Chris that was my brother and sister they were just the conduit it yeah that's it it was God that's exactly right and God poured it in amen it had to come out that's right amen if you put something in the pipeline and the pipeline goes nowhere the pipeline blows up amen so it's God putting it in the pipeline the conduit and he's sending it out and he's giving distribution to you yes sir amen so how many of you maybe You' just be gracious to me and lift a hand how many of you have come to church not talking about just here talking about going to church serving God and you went to church with a question and God come right down gave an answer I think we have to every one of us lift a hand wasn't that preacher so clever no sorry the preacher didn't have a clue amen and if he does have a clue and he preaches it in some fashion like it's Revelation then run but you see we're talking Faithful Men and God says I'll pour it in and they'll let it out amen and it will answer questions in lives changing those lives now my brother and sister if God deals with you direct I'm sorry this will be a little blunt if God deals with you direct and you fail to respond to it that's your problem that's right don't go blaming the church don't go blame the message don't go blame the preacher that's right that's your problem if you won't let the word work in you amen that's right imagine eating a nice juicy steak and then telling your body to reject everything that's contained in that stake yeah that right there it's just Insanity Insanity Insanity amen look God answers your prayers in times of prosperity he answers your prayers in times of desperation we serve a prayer answering God Can someone say amen amen we serve a God that cares about our life it's the devil that's trying to put the smoke screen up right amen he's the one that's trying to block it all out so that we don't think God cares that's it but God does care and God's not partial God's not Prejudice oh pardon me for saying this but God's not racist that's right amen believer unbeliever every Kindred Nation tongue God in the saving business to those who will let him save them am that's right you know this just happened true story just happened here not that long ago I believe it was California there was a a boat issue and the boat wasn't that far offshore other boats come to help and this one guy says I'll go to shore myself 100 yards from the from the the shore drowns now who can he blame here we're coming close to the shore time is coming to a close and how we are living and the condition of our life and the struggles we're facing if you won't let God help you that's it don't blame him amen don't have the audacity to blame God when he is crying out to you let me save you amen amen it's a time my brother and sister that it needs to be this straight it needs to be that purposeful that we can recognize I can't save myself that's right I can't do this that's right and a voice is saying let me save you that's it let me heal you let me touch you amen let Satan will come and give us a hundred reasons why not God will not justify his word to you you believe it or you don't that's it amen perseverance I like this and we'll close out here real quick here um one man Invasion talking about Moses you couldn't stop him he was persistent why he had heard the voice of God that was enough to make him persistent an old man 80 years old was going to take over the nation and he done it he had heard the voice of God Amen now we know that God is not um Somebody Pray for my brain a respector of persons so what he did for Moses he'll do for you amen that's his promise that's right amen so a promise to take over a nation he done it God will do that for you got ation here oh I'm not talking about the United States of America I'm talking about this Kingdom heard the voice of God he's going to take over with that stick in his hand a trained Army a million men standing there more than a million men had conquered the world in that day and here goes an old man 80 years old wife sitting on a mule sticking his hand going down to take the nation over why people would have thought he was crazy so you know when you hear the voice of God and hear the word of God god well praise God I can now officially call you guys crazy you are kind of crazy to another believer ain't that strange Believer from Believer by God's privilege I've been a huge portion of the world and you don't have to go over there and and start sorting out our different es of how we see God you go there and stand and people say well every nation has culture that's fine but when you start talking about the word it's not this nation amen it's a Heavenly Nation God's kingdom and you go right there and you go right on the same page you can go right into the word and they're right there to say I believe that and you and they're sharing their story you're right there to say I believe that amen so we're kind of crazy to the world but if you hear the voice you know what you're doing amen amen thank you Lord H ain't that awesome I tell you what I thank you God's got one language that's it that's the problem with the whole denominational world is they thought that they had their own language and they give up speaking God's language to speak their language amen but God's only got one language and that is his word hallelujah amen hallelujah look I got a couple more direct statements I want to make real quick sister via plays real softly amen these are pretty direct and I don't know why I'm felt to say them maybe it's time for us to make sure what we're a convert to are we converts to just religion because if we are we'll hear and obey our religion are we converts to Christ amen because then we will hear and obey the gospel amen of Jesus Christ amen yes I admit it I admit it I'm getting crazier every day the Lord hallelujah amen the world we live in if you I'm sorry you guys can't see the world through my lens and of course I can't see it through your lens but when you have grown-ups that give you all kinds of reasons why we should all be afraid [Music] I'm afraid of the direction our nation is going I'm not it's already prophesied couldn't change it if I wanted to I'm not afraid of that no sir if there would be pardon me to put it this way if there was anything to be afraid of is that the devil would keep me from being ready that's right but if I submit myself Hallelujah I'm not going to throw it on you guys okay if I'll submit myself to the word right I don't even need to be afraid of being ready that's it I have no fear of tomorrow that's right amen because he is my tomorrow amen hallelujah amen oh but you see a little crazy to the world but but to Christ the word we've been found faithful that's right well done my good and faithful servant I want to throw a little homework on you not going to even read it but if you would go home Matthew 25: 14- 21 amen amen what are we doing that's it with our talent amen yes sir take it in a English term as a fixture of words not as a weate not an object but a gift what are we doing with our talent amen are we committing it to the Lord with finding a reason not to now don't misunderstand me I stand here today with confidence you might think that I have a little confidence but a lot of that's based on the principle of what brother Lonnie Jenkins told me years ago brother Paul you don't have to be a great preacher to be a good pastor so through the years I've never desired to be a great preacher I just desired to be a good pastor amen let's make a commitment I don't need to be great I don't need to have all kinds of things that I can say look here look there but let us be faithful Amen Let us be faithful to our calling of what God has called us to do I was called to live the life amen doesn't matter what office you hold no Lord help us that's right hallelujah amen amen let's just stand and sing a song or two
