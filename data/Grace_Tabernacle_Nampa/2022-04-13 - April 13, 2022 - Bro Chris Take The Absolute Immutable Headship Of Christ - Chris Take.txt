heart amen and bring healing to him and as i posted today about psy if you just remember him or would just touch his body there'd be no complications you know we get a bad concussion sometimes things can happen upstairs and so we just want to pray lord just completely heal his body and let's remember continue remember sister april for protection north and be upon her for the facility as he's out on the roads and i know our pastor he's still under the weather so let's remember him in prayer or just touch him brother joshua he's at home with a sore throat sister ruth is not feeling well tonight so let's lift these needs to our heavenly father and we have a testimony that's what paul brought up sister dorcas got her test back and there is no inflammation in the heart all the tests came back good she says the lord has answered prayer so we want to thank the lord for that praise our lord amen let's just bow our heads this morning or this evening gracious heavenly father lord what an honor

again you've shown yourself as a healer lord and lord as we as we think of these things we think of these prayer requests so many of them tonight lord god different needs but so many of them lord needing a healing touch lord god the josiah down there in l.a with the concussion lord that our brother joshua here lord jesus sister ruth the different ones here lord and this baby asher lord god i don't remember all of them lord jesus but you do you've heard the requests [Music] lord you've already shown yourself a healer and we're believing for each one of these lord god that they would just your healing hand would once again touch them lord jesus and we'd hear more testimonies lord god we'd hear from the lips of the different ones of a of a living god [Music] that lives through his people lord jesus lord jesus as we turn these things over to you this evening lord god we just ask once again that you'd your spirit would fall fresh on each one of us this evening lord that you would

whatever they might be lord may we just leave here filled with a little more jesus christ than we came tonight lord may you just use us each one lord as we go throughout the rest of the week god may may our lives speak christ to those around us we ask lord may we just be lights testimonies whatever it is lord jesus to those around us fill us each one we pray we ask these things tonight in jesus name amen amen you may have your seats amen and i did forget my wife reminded me if you could remember my wife's mom she was back in the er again today they're finding problems with her heart and different things and she's probably on medications as long as my arm so we just if you could just remember her in prayer the lord would just touch her but most of all i want to touch her soul amen she is familiar with the message and i think this would be give my wife an opportunity just to say the right thing amen and uh so let's if you could just make a note of that just remember emmy's emmy's mom in prayer i know she would appreciate it amen as we get ready to turn the servers to brother chris just one quick announcements grace kids and young peoples this friday so let's be in prayer for that lord would just be with our young people and our little ones let's sing uh number 825. i think i've sung this here i don't know what we have is a pillar of fire do i have a bunch of deer head deer in the headlights perfect okay at least me and sister jerry will sing it you sign it okay all right the pillar of fire let the children of israel let them out of egypt's land let them to the rock of the water and lent them to the man in god's hand let them to god's holy mountain where god chose to speak unto them but he wasn't there yet before he led them to the promised land oh what we have is a pillar of fire it's leading the church of god again for it's leading us back to the bible and it's leading us away from sin and it's showing the resurrected savior showing himself alive again what we have is fire and it's burning in the hearts of man the early church had the pillar of fire leading each and every day and showing to all of the sinners that jesus is the only way without the blood there is no salvation without the spirit there is no life what we have is a pillar of and it's burning in our hearts tonight oh what we have is a pillar of fire it's leading the church of god again and it's leading us back to the bible and it's leading us away from sin showing the resurrected savior and he's showing himself alive again what we have is a pillar of fire and it's burning in the hearts of man [Music] otherwise where would we find our victory amen praise the lord well we thank you for all your prayers over the weekend with the last minute trip up to washington um turned out to be a bit of a blessing under the circumstances um grandma gloria who's kristen's grandma on her mom's side she's doing a lot better than we thought she was she's still on hospice care in her home but we're trusting and believing that god heals her whether his whatever his will is but the ultimate thing that we are asking for is the salvation of her soul um she has two sons that that live with her there and we were able to pick up a bible in uh the first book of the supernatural series and on our way home monday we stopped in and gave it to her and separately me and my wife both had the same thought that her one son brian who has been through a lot um would be the one to read it to her because she can't see very well and then he would get saved too so maybe there's something there just believing believing on that but brother john andes and the church there they send their greetings i saw a million and one people that knew most of you um i said i would try to remember their names so that uh but didier as well since his greetings and uh i was talking with brother daryl ward today just briefly and so he said say hello to for the paul and the saints at grace tabernacle so greetings from brother daryl ward as well amen if you have your bibles tonight want to stand with us we are going to turn to hebrews chapter 7. hebrews chapter seven we're gonna start in verse 23. i'm not asking for forgiveness or apologizing i'm just letting you know i have a lot of scriptures and quotes tonight so bear with me seven hebrews 7 20 i cut out cut things down where i could but i mean it's all good anyway so hebrews 7 verse 23 why don't we have a word prayer first heavenly father lord we are so thankful to be in your house tonight and we know that this is the place you intended father the way your word is the way you are lord there are certain things that you just said in order because and father it is called of us to accept that lord father because you are god and we are not and lord we just thank you for this time to come into your house and worship you your presence is near and we appreciate that lord we don't take that for granted lord jesus and father we are a privileged people to be able to serve you in this crazy world that is around us lord father yet all things are working together for good lord for your glory lord jesus we ask that you take these words tonight that you've laid upon my heart not my words your words lord any words that would be mine or opinions of mine may you move them aside lord jesus that you just have liberty with your word this evening we ask touch your hearts of your people lord we pray in jesus name amen hebrews 7 verse 23 and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood talking about christ wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost leaving none behind that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests who offer a sacrifice sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself for the law maketh key in here for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the sun capitalist who is consecrated forevermore turn to right next door to hebrews chapter 6. before we read that i just have a quick scripture here galatians 2 4 and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty came in secretly snuck in to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage so man brings bondage but christ brings liberty hebrews chapter 6 verse 17 wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath there's another scripture here in hebrews where he says he could swear by none greater so he swore by himself that by two immutable things immutable means unchanging over time or unable to be changed god changes not which it is impossible for god to lie that is immutable we might have a strong so let me restart that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation or encouragement who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us not behind us before us which hope which is christ we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus so he entered into the veil before us made an high priest forever after the order of melchizedek may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated tonight so as spoken of before we're going to speak uh two altars part three tonight um in part one we talked about uh alter the an altar built of lively stones and we took from i think it's second peter or the altar built up of lively stones and and elijah and the mount carmel showdown elijah repaired the altar and there was there's a loud no hewn stone in other words a man can't go and cut the stone it has to be natural ordained of god part two we talked about the sacrificial altar of praise the prayers of the saints are are an incense and an instance for an atonement and for that instance to do its work there is always fire needed typing the holy spirit hezekiah we talk about hezekiah changing the mind of god with his prayers and that you are kings and priests under the order of melchizedek we are under christ as kings and priests in other words we have the ability to offer these incense up so tonight i'd like to take part three and my title would be the absolute immutable headship of christ and the lord's been really dealing with my heart on this subject and this has been kind of marinating if you will for quite a few weeks and jotting down notes and things and and i i felt led um and i even confessed this to the youth group last youth meeting i said we're going to listen to the tape absolute because we've been we've been starting a new thing where there's a new tape every month that they need to listen to and so i said i don't know why yet but i want i feel led to have us listen to an absolute and it's the first one that he that he ministers on and i i began the same time i begin to think about headship and and uh realizing just how beautifully that ties in because christ is our absolute and the only way that christ can be our absolute is if we are under his headship and um so just i hope that they've been listening and they can then can glean the same thing tonight um one more scripture here uh first corinthians chapter 11. so we read here in galatians 2 4 that these men went out privately to spy out our liberty it's your liberty whatever god has given you is now in your possession you have full authority given to you by christ it's yours the promises are yours the liberty is yours and if you do not have liberty all you have to do is step forward under the promise and take that liberty so they they were envious people are the the outside world is envious of the liberty that we have in christ but as we're going to see tonight that liberty only comes when we are underneath the headship of christ so then men desire to bring us into bondage but christ brings us liberty can't talk about headship i suppose without reading this scripture first corinthians chapter 11 be followers of me even as i also am of christ now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god now okay everyone's just assumed i'm gonna just attack women tonight well i have a i have maybe news to you maybe not news to you but did you know a man can have a dominating female spirit yes paul starts out he says he says look follow me as i follow christ right away he brings the church of corinthian into lines hey it's not me you're following it's christ it says the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god so it's all in order underneath the headship of christ in an abs in the absolute 1962. brother says i said if he slay me so let me back up i didn't put the whole quote in here but in this in this sermon brother brown gets down towards the end here and he begins to share the his the story of where he used to go to the grave of his wife and and his daughter sharon rose and he was he would go there a lot and he was going up one time right after the flood and that they had there and the i think it was the mayor stops him and he begins to talk to him and you know say hey you know are you doing okay what are you doing and and he says you know i'd like to go and hear the dove's coup and all this stuff and and different things at the grave side and so it's just a very moving portion of the sermon and and he says i said if he slay me so he says he says brother brother biller or billy what does christ mean to you now he said you've given your heart to to to you your labor of love into into the ministry god has given you and doing all of these things and and and up late at night with sick calls and preaching on the corner and working a full-time job and yet he took your wife and your baby what all these things what does he mean to you now and brother beno says these words he said i said if he slay me yet i trust him why my anchor holds within the veil i had an absolute i tied myself to his word and his word was holding remember we've been talking about that a lot lately it's not that you got the holy ghost is that the holy ghost got you he is my absolute i found out that all these other things may fail but christ can never fail amen what a nice testimony of faith now you look at the definition of lord it means someone or something having power authority or influence a master or ruler if christ is your absolute he has absolute power and authority over you christ was our is is our example we are called to become like christ what did he do i can do nothing except for the father i do the father's business we've been hearing that too amen so he is your master the brother man says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says and the body must follow the head as the wife follows the husband being that adam was not deceived he walked out with eve eve was deceived she was in the transgression or the entire resurrection of the whole body would have come forth at the day of the lord jesus when he came forth from the grave but he had to redeem her which is his body he had to redeem his body she has to be redeemed in order to come to him see adam knew he was sinning when he took eve but her head was redeeming her you see there is victory there is safety underneath the headship of christ there is safety as a as a wife under the headship of your husband if he is under the headship of christ um but i just want to use that as a type of being under the headship of christ so adam was covering eve when he took her and he committed the sin he was covering eve he said well how could this happen in the garden of eden and i have you can go in the church age book and read it it was all part of god's redemption plan you see nothing can happen unless god has foreordained it to happen all things follow underneath god's plan now so so this was a type see christ was christ is christ's blood christ himself is the covering but until he redeemed you redeemed the human race we didn't have access to that covering we didn't have access to that headship so adam took upon the sin christ took upon the sin so that he could redeem the bride of jesus christ and he became the covering christ covered the bride with his blood and this redemption that's the seven seals that is it right there christ redeeming his bride and bringing her to a place where she could come to submission and the underneath the headship of christ because brother brown says he says we step out of the will of god god doesn't push us out we step out when we step out from the will of god then now we're on our own so to speak not really but we're in we're in an unsafe position and things can happen we have to step back into the will of god you cannot be in the will of god unless you are underneath the submission and headship of christ there is no other option it will not work i'm laying a foundation we'll get to what we're going to we'll get to this tonight so headship in its pure form is not control or dictatorship it is a love affair i was just energized saints of god looking at this we look at the scripture of you know oh the the man is the head of the woman and i think sometimes i know sometimes we miss the point the point was about wasn't about a man having rulership over a woman the point is you need christ as your head he was setting an order of the family which is a direct representation of christ the family of god so in the purest form it is a love affair you know the world the people the women in the world today want to deny we don't need men well some of the men they need to get their heads straight i don't blame them but this is a world that we live in it goes both sides both the man and the woman responsible but it's the spirits of the age it's not flesh and blood it's the principalities of the air but when you see what's happening in the natural world you get an understanding for what's happening on the spiritual side but the battle talked about how when they went into space and things that was a direct correlation to the opening of the word the space age so what is it it's the bride coming to a peak a pinnacle under the headship of christ so the devil's going to pervert that he's going to flip that around and he's going to fight against that the devil's always motivated his motivation is always to fight against what god is doing right because he does not want you to be a part of that so as the bride comes to her position now of authority you see the same thing women coming into power but at the same time they're denying headship of any man and the bride is accepting the headship of christ it's just the world that we live in today adam laid down his life to protect eve a man and a woman in in in uh that are married husband and wife that are in harmony with god's word the man underneath the headship of christ the woman under the headship of the man he is her protector he doesn't say oh you figure it out you know you do as i tell you to do and figure no that's not he's holding the door for her opening the car door for her right it's a love affair it's a it's it's a it's a moment where we're all humans i forget to open the door too but in that in that in that perfection it's in what it is in that that line christ the man the woman in that line is is a the purest form of love you want to do everything you can to provide for her protect her and she in turn wants to do everything she can to respect and cherish her head i mean isn't that how we are with christ our desires to do everything we can to please him everything we can our our we wake up in the morning and say how can we please you today lord what can we do how can we give you more of ourselves amen and it's the same thing in that in a in in that relationship between a man husband and wife but man has perverted headship any viewpoint that anyone has that of headship that is negative is because a man had his own say opinion about it i'm talking about when we say headship people from you know outside of the message and you know those men in the message that kind of thing right it's they've seen a perversion of that where it's it's perverted into do as i say or else but that's not the way that god desired it it's god didn't say you know my way or the highway he's a leader he is not going to ask you to go through to go do anything he has not done himself anything you face in life he has faced that's why he came to earth and walked in shoe leather because he's leading you he doesn't ever shove you in front and say you know you open the door or or you shine the light no he is leading you he is the light leading you down the path we follow after christ and in turn we are our representation of christ to this generation but that can only come um when we are underneath that headship the perfect headship what is it the absolute immutable headship of christ in other words you need nothing else and it's unchanging that's it you need nothing else and it's unchanging that's following christ in full submission i don't know if i'm stepping on toes or if y'all are just listening tonight the purest form is harmony between a man christ a man and a woman each in their position which will produce unconditional love 1963 christians god revealed again now we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning that's underlined there coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at first in john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one you see there will be no rapture for an individual who can't accept the headship of christ not a man's idea and this is the this is the two altars part three man has his altar god has his one is an impersonation looks like the thing but god will never the word slips my mind god will never put his stamp of approval on that because man has hewn the stones oh it's a great program and i saw something today i won't say where it was but it was a program and it's just grieving to see what people will do because it's not about a man's program and laid out guess what uh you know you think you have it figured out god's going to come and turn you upside down they say oh i know i know my future i know where i'm going to be in 30 years and i know where i'm going to live who i'm going to be married to and all this stuff and god says um i'm sorry he doesn't apologize he just goes and turns your life upside down but there's a cap on the bottle so you don't get all poured out here's your protection they say what you know job and all that he went through but still underneath god's protection that was a man fully submitted to christ's headship because his wife came along and said just curse god and die and he said well how can i do that how can i do that to do that is is to remove to go against everything even though in the midst of that situation in the midst of that trial so he goes on to say um head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life vindicated by god himself through his promised word for the last days he promised us in the last days now if you're spiritual you catch it how can it be a dictatorship how can headship be dictatorship when christ in this quote whether i'm talking about christ is coming into his bride doing he's doing it the same works that he did already done did his past tense doing his present did his past at the beginning see christ true headship christ living through you what he expects of you but how do you get that continuity how do you get that perfection when you submit to christ when you come underneath full obedience to god's word full and total obedience so he will not ask you to go through something unless he has himself done it and he's not worried about his word coming to pass because he's doing it through you i was i was reading the quote friday night for the didiers he he plucked me from the free service and had me minister but where brother battle says that god christ has faith in his own word you are his word you are his word manifested we'll read another quote here a little bit later about that so he will he will not ask you to go through something unless he has himself done it so what is the vindication then that's the big thing vindication what's you know that's what people like to are getting into what is truth they're trying to get it to a place where there is no truth it's just all opinion and you can just pick and choose how you want your path to go the thing about this is that's in direct that's completely contrary to god's word we don't really get to choose what we want to do with our lives because we're underneath headship of christ you see we have a choice we have free moral agency to choose to submit to christ and when we do that then our life is ordered of the lord predestination though at the same time you will come under headship as a seat of christ that's a beautiful thing so what is the vindication of true headship we have perverted headship with a chris we see it different places you know pastors and and influential men have their own version that's just a man's idea but what where do we what is the vindication of true headship it's christ himself through his promised word amen right christ himself hebrews says vindicated he says he's talking about headship in this quote he says he says vindicated he's at the head and the body becoming one and then he says vindicated by god himself through his promised word for the last days so what does the word say about headship what does the word say about church what does the word say about marriage what does the word say about children what does the word say about these things and you line up with that word and you will find yourself living underneath the headship of christ which is the most beautiful place you can be brother preaches the message letting off the pressure where are you going to find a place to let off the pressure but under the headship of christ so we're defining headship that we're defining headship here anything contrary to that anything contrary to god's word and the headship of christ anything that pulls you from that position is antichrist no matter i want you to pay attention here no matter how small no matter how small it's god's word or it's not i prayed lord i want to come i got i'm preaching this i can't be a hypocrite pray lord i want to come even more under your headship even more submissive and obedient you know over the weekend it's just it's kind of hard for me to explain but it was just it was a very supernatural weekend for us god just just did a lot and uh just it's just special and some of it you know you can share some of it you can't it just you just it had it was for us let me put it that way but i even prayed where we should go for breakfast on monday because i began to think everything we do is according to will of god i had the desire friday night to stay through sunday evening and come back monday but our plan was to drive back sunday so i just prayed i said lord i don't want to do this if it's just my desire if it's yours make it obvious i prayed make it obvious and i kind of just moved on and and we're we got held up a little bit later visiting with my cousin and the next thing you know we got to go you know so we go to drive out of town and there was a funny rattle in the car and so my wife googled it and apparently it was the timing chain the rattle of death they called and i could see a storm over the past and we're just imagining breaking down the middle night with snow all around us so we we had to go return the car and that delayed us and then we said well we're not going to drive now it's too late and we ended up staying he made it obvious and we were we were greatly blessed so just coming into that place where it's like lord what what's your plan what's your program what i want to line up with that in uh 1965 deaf well 1960 but brown says what is the church the mystic body of christ who set it up the lord jesus himself it wasn't set up at rome neither was it set up in england by john wesley neither was it set up by calvin or in america the baptist by john smith neither was it set up in california by the pentecostals it was set up by jesus christ the king of the messianic kingdom that's who was set up by he is the king he wants to be the king he wants to rule us he wants to be lord and you return that expression say lord i want you to be my lord i want you to be my king he's not our president he's our king in other words absolute authority people let him in say i'll let him be my be savior but they won't let him be lord lord means ownership rulership come into my heart lord save me from hell but don't tell me what to do that's the attitude of the people some time ago i had i i i was thinking on this kind of similar thing and it was you know up front vashti wanted to be the king's wife to be the queen she wanted the benefits but when he called upon her she rejected his headship she said you know i want i want the riches and i want to be queen vashti but i don't want you to tell me what to do and so he put her away and got himself esther and we know she's the type of the bride see people they they want to have the you know it's a catastrophe that you know it's nice to have a man in a nice suit get up and pray over the nation until he says hey woman but anyways um right it's you know the catholic church and all this stuff it's pretty but as soon as god says as soon as it comes down to god telling them what to do they don't want any part of it that's what happened in the separation of brother madam's ministry when he lost lost all his contacts and his open doors it came down to the word and as soon as the word began to be preached which was christ himself i said oh we will take the healings but we don't want that that's right john 6 54 who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day who so eateth my flesh and ring of my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day in other words communion communion with christ and if you go in in first corinthians chapter 11 it starts out it lays out and we're gonna did i skip that accidentally no okay we're going to read those more of those scriptures there don't don't don't jump to it just uh john 6 54. but we'll we'll read the rest of this in the first half of of of first corinthians chapter 11 paul lays out headship and and the man you know from the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man and all these things down through and then and then the second half of the scriptures communion for i ever see to the lord verse 23 that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread you think that was by coincidence brother says the bible is perfect up to the periods and calmness what happens when you say lord i submit when you come into the words definition of headship what happens communion with christ that's why we have this scripture here he laid out the line he laid the word out it was time it's coming up to his crucifixion and the close of his ministry on earth and he lays the word out you must have communion with me or you have no part with me he lays it on the line in verse 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him i like how it says it didn't say went away it says they went back they went back they went they they couldn't accept the word which is the headship of christ they couldn't accept it and they turned and walked away from it they rejected the headship of christ but you see as you know communion with christ is such a beautiful thing but to achieve that to come to that place you have to accept the headship of christ you have to be in submission to his word and to the word of god there is no other way does it light up with the word if it does you accept it if it doesn't you move from that but as soon as you take a man's version of the word over christ you step out from the headship of christ but we're not going to end on a negative accepting the headship of christ in following we don't always understand but we should understand to always follow john 6 68 then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life what was that why was peter allowed to say those things in his fallen state as a man vindication that it's the seed within us crying out lord we accept your word we don't understand it you think peter had it figured out right then no he was shocked right church split i mean not even 50 50. 70 12 or whatever right big day eat his flesh drink his blood i don't understand but lord you have eternal life i'll follow you even though don't always understand because i understand to always follow that's where people go off the mark saying to god they just say oh it's it's too hard of a saying how many times has has you ran into something in the word of god or just like that did not make sense but you know what like our pastor says show me something better show me something better there is nothing better and god is always faithful to reveal that to you if you need to know sometimes we don't need to know and i've had to wrestle with that saint to god i've had to wrestle with that questions i want answers i wanted and god spoke to my heart over the course of time and these simple words i i live my life buyer i say them all the time god is god and i am not sometimes we just have to rest right there we just have to put it there and move on so we when we were in part one we talked about elijah's author repair and this scripture came back to my remembrance first kings 18 30 and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near to him and he repaired this is at the mount carmel showdown and he repaired thee a altar the altar of the lord that was broken down now the altar of the lord was broken down in israel or the church in other words the headship had been denied the altar had fallen apart there were they have denied headship ahab was king and jezebel ruled the kingdom right jezebel had a dominating female spirit i mean it's pretty obvious the church was out from under the headship of christ there's quotes i was reading where brother brown says ahab went wrong when he married jezebel jezebel brought in the the the religion of baal and that religion you read the church age book down through it's still here today under the guise of the catholic church and now it's infiltrated into the the denominations but you look at where it started we don't need the headship of christ we don't need the headship of a man that was jezebel they say you know ah did what she said so you see that spirit right it's not people it's a spirit that dominating spirit broke down the altar of the lord that spirit pushed christ right out a man can have the same spirit when he says you know what my life doesn't line up but i'm going to do it anyways it doesn't line up with the word of god i'm going to do it anyways and you see a reflection if it's a pastor you see the reflection in his church that spirit if it's a family a husband you see that reflection in his in his wife and his children they say what's wrong why is she you know why is she like that he's not underneath the headship of christ it's a direct reflection you see but but here's the thing because i wrote this down and and i don't know if i if i copied what i wrote down exactly over but i was sitting in the back there brother our pastor was ministering or i can't remember exactly who and i just was had these notes on headship and and it's a strong subject saying to god it's a strong subject it's the line right it's the it's the drawing of the line and and i begin to think and it's the lord you know you're you're a god that that you desire to to pull us inside of you ever have them days where just you look at your wife and say i wish i could just pull you right inside of me he desires that kind of relationship that closeness and i said you know what there's these negative things about jezebel and the dominating female spirit but what happened in that time saints of god is christ came down under with this elijah anointed of christ came down representing christ to the church and repaired the altar amen he repaired y'all he said it's broken in my home god will come and repair it he said it's broken in this church god will come and repair it all you have to do is surrender to him and pray that god would come and do it because if you as a man go and fix it it's no different than it was before elijah a type of christ under the anointing of christ he repairs the altar testifying of today today sense of god in our midst when we see the two spirits operating within the framework of the church and we see the rejection of the headship of christ in favor of doing it the way of a man god is coming down and the main movement is going to be there and they're going to go off unfortunately they're going to go off but there's real people real families real churches caught in that divide and they might be going off now but god's going to come and repair the altar god has given us a spoken word amen god is going to come and prepare the altar in your family and in the churches praise god that is where you find true unity in the bride of christ you see you can't create unity no meetings nothing is going to create unity because that's a man you say oh i have it figured out this is the perfect location you know you pick some central location in the united states this is it i don't know where that is but this is the place and we'll have a week-long meetings and we'll do a tent because a lot of people agree on a tent and and uh we'll get these ministers because a lot of people agree on these ministers and we'll get these ministers because a lot of people agree on these ministers and we'll bring it all to what are you doing you're hewing stone that's it you're cutting stone now god is going to lay it on on your hearts to have meetings there's nothing wrong with that i'm not saying that i'm saying if you're trying to bring unity bring these people all these people together all you're doing is hewing stones and the bible says that's not going to work praise the lord jezebel had a dominating spirit the church was out from the headship of christ the altar was torn down now the two altars right so what happened another altar rose up in the place of the altar of the lord the altar to baal and you can go back and you can read the sin of jeroboam what did he do he took and he went off and he started his own israel his own church and the sins of jeroboam worked its way down to generation through generation until a man by the name of josiah came up see god came that sin of jeroboam lingered even through good kings but god came up and repaired the altar of the lord underneath the ministry of elijah and josiah when he tore down those altars so the altar of bell had risen in the place but god came down and fixed that and brought the church back under the headship of christ now there's a quote here brother brown says joseph meeting his brother in 1956. he says one man wrote a poet wrote my anchor holds within the veil what is a veil it's something that we're getting to the to the the point that shuts off here from there and the anchor is on the inside of the veil the anchor is on the inside of the veil we read it here in it was in hebrews chapter six which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil acres of the inside of the veil you don't see how it's going to be but you know that there's something that's got a hold of you that's got a hold up there well we know what it is now because the word has been opened unto us we can see we can go inside that veil we're talking about the anchor is it holds within the veil the world can't see it the world doesn't get it how do you do it how does your family stay so strong how do you how do women stay modest how do you young men and young women stay pure up to marriage how do you do it there's an anchor holding that they can't see first corinthians 11 chapter four turn with me there familiar section of scripture about a woman in her long hair but this is not a sermon about modesty like i said sometimes we actually let me say this we are called to look between the lines and see what god's trying to say because we line up on the outside but but it's not it's not necessarily the long hair it's the representation of what that is verse 4 every man praying or prophesying having his head covereth this honoreth his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesy with her head uncovered with her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it would be a shame for for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be cuffed in other words it's a shame for her to be shaven so just don't cut your hair for a woman indeed ought not to cover a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and the glory and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man that's said in order at the beginning of creation he god took eve from adam neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels go read in the message but the brown says that's lowercase a it's men angels is men in the scripture so the for this cause in other words a woman with long hair should have power in her head find power underneath the headship of of her man that god has given her underneath that headship that's where a woman finds her power where do we as the bible jesus christ find our power under the headship of christ you see we've moved now tonight we've moved we're talking about the woman we're talking about the bride you you men you women all included tonight and the women nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord we are nothing without christ christ's desire to have us to make him god he is complete with us and we are complete with him for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god judge in yourself is it calmly that a woman pray unto god uncovered does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering the hair is the covering but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom net of the churches of god i was supposed to stop in verse 15. so covering the hair the long hair is given for to the woman for a covering a covering in this scripture is a mantle of veil a rapper having conferences 1960 so men all down through the age has stumbled at that so simple just accept the blood you can't cover yourself take god's covering you can't learn how to do it there's no learning about it god does it himself it's supernatural it's through life god does the covering you can't do it what happens when a woman say let's use the example leaves a message what is one of the first things that she does she chops her hair off they say almost you know she thinks she's her own person now and all these things but she the spirit within us within her has risen to the surface and you see the very the very thing testifying denying of headship we as children of god as the bride of christ have been given a covering the covering of christ our veil which is where the anchor holds the anchor holds within the veil for the panel says i actually i i came across that and just left out of the page to me obviously the lord it was the heart of the lord's thing and i i i uh what does it use the quotes and i strict word searched anchor holds within the veil and he says he says those exact words 15 times anchor holds within the veil and i just begin to think that covering a woman's long hair is given to her as a covering which is a veil we are given the word of christ and when we're under the headship we're underneath that covering and that's where our anchor holds our anchor holds under the headship of christ we cannot do without the covering we cannot serve god we cannot we cannot lift up our voices in prayer unless we are underneath that cover are your prayers hindered are you under the covering as a man you say well i'm a man you know i gotta have short hair yeah but you're the bride of christ you have to see we're reading between the lines here praise the lord it was within the veil that our anchor holds and what is behind that veil christ you are christ's veil but christ is veiled within you to this generation it's a secret thing was there was there was silence in heaven how does it work how do you do it it's christ anchor holds within the veil the only way to get behind that covering is to come under the headship of christ total submission or obedience the token 1964. and you some of you probably knew this was coming full obedience to the full word of god entitles us to the token what is the token escape from death what is death eternal separation from god full obedience is the full word of god of the full order to the full word of god entitles us to the token no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the token interesting he uses the word entitled there's a lot of entitled people in the world today they have the perverted version but as the bride of christ you have the true version you say lord the situation is like this but you promised the token is mine amen he loves to see you take up that that's that's faith with some skin on it that's a burly man that's a that's a strong woman god yes that's okay to say that's having faith you say lord and he it makes him so proud job said i don't know what's going on i don't know how it's gonna work but i'm gonna follow you peter said lord i don't understand it's your flesh doesn't make any sense to me but where can i go he submitted and god gave christ gave him the keys to the kingdom recognition of his because it went when it came to that peter you know right there submitting but see what happened when peter made his conversion he required an open submission to god's word no i'm just not you know in the closet it's easy to say right i submit in church with like with with other believers easy to say i submit but when it comes down to you acting upon the word of god when there is no music when there is no anointing present so to speak that's when you need faith with muscles in it with muscles he says you can be entitled until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put into it capital i and added to it but what god said about it not a man's idea but what god said about it so full obedience the token the token is what is the holy spirit is that ticket but the only way to come to that position is to full obedience of the word of god full submission to the headship of christ underneath your covering amen now there's a story in the bible very familiar to us about a woman named rahab 2 18 behold when we come into the land the spies now are speaking to ray had the rahab joshua sent the spies across the river jordan he said go spy out the lands or they go to jericho and and um they meet up with rahab right like i think it was paul the spirit's connected there's no fishiness going on there and so they go she hides them and then and then here's the thing that i just jumped out to me they don't even tell her to put the scarlet thread out her window until she's already lowered them down by the said same cord she's already acting on the word to come she's in motion abraham was given circumcision as a sign of his faith he was already in motion and god said i recognize your faith abraham so she's in motion she lowers them down and she says look make a promise that i will my i will be spared and they said behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou that has led us down by and thou shalt bring thy father you see what did that cord do when it let them down it let those servants those men in to freedom full obedience to god's word will lead you into freedom so now they say look go ahead and hang this core it's visible people saw it hang this cord out friend that shall bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren all thy father's household home unto thee in other words whoever's in the house will be saved praise the lord you can reply that to your home whoever's in this house will be saved but to your life this house will be saved and so as the story goes they marched around the walls of jericho and they blew the trumpets and they shouted on the seventh day after walking around seven times and victory came to the children of israel to the church and the walls fell down and here is rahab's home still standing untouched unfazed a dish didn't even fall off the shelf so how do you know that because god doesn't do anything halfway that's right amen chapter 6 25 and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive interesting that it puts there puts that in the scripture nothing is in the scripture by chance joshua is the type of christ joshua saved rahab the harlot alive christ saved you alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out jericho was it the cord no the core didn't save her it was her obedience to the word of god that came from the servant's mouth the obedience to god's word and brother brown says in his quote here fellowship by redemption 1955 and also read in the bible is a covering red is an atonement red is safety you remember when the harlot rahab let the spies down on the red string to safety always safety under red now the blood is red so she came under the headship of christ when she hung that cord out her window and through that submission to god's word she got the token protection and be and through that even as a gentile she found position in the church of god israel at the time so she came under the headship and it was a sign that cord was just a sign that spoke of her heart she was willing for there to be in the to come under the absolute immutable hedgehog of christ she was willing to submit to the word of god so have full obedience to god's word you see long hair alone means nothing it is a woman's glory it's a sign given by the lord it's what god said look i want this this is what i desire in a woman with the right heart doesn't want anything else but that it shows the heart of the woman desiring to be under headship she may not realize it at a young age that that her desire for long hair means she desires to be under the headship of the word but as she matures in christ she'll come to that position where she realized it's that deep calling out to the deep with the deep to respond amen when you live in your life there's been situations and times where you just did something this way and realized later on it was god you just fell right into the headship of christ and he he led you right through that situation but from this victory that rahab has and this is just stirs my heart rahab is delivered and saved by joshua type of christ and if you go and you read later on down in the bible well first of all her submission brought her redemption matthew one verse five and salman begot boaz of roychab rahab and boaz begat obed of ruth and obed begat jesse solem salman means a garment so when rahab submitted to the word of god she found her covering in salman and she went in and she married salman that you have found in christ amen brings a relationship behind the veil a relationship it's hid it's a secret it's you and god and no one else in the middle it's you and god and that brings forth the promised language boaz as a type of christ praise the lord coming down here shortly i i almost said the beginning that this sermon may be the undoing of my short preaching uh reputation but i don't care hey it's short it's long it doesn't matter to me it's just the word of god second kings chapter 2 verse 8. so rahab found her covering a woman finds her covering when she has long hair it all means under the headship that's what the covering means you come into the headship of christ you are covered you're wrapped in his word so second kings chapter 2 verse 8. we're going to read here where elijah follows elijah to the river jordan a promise of a new life so they cross the river well i'm going to get in myself chapter verse 8 and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together the covering mantle amen and smote the waters and they were divided together into there so that they too went over on dry ground now there's some there's 50 men of the sons of the prophets on the other side they stay on the other side they're watching you see it was just elijah and elisha when you cross that river jordan it's just you and god and how do you access the other side of jordan by the covering of god's word god's word has to split the waters for you for you to walk across on dry ground you see there's nothing muddied there in that transition it's clear revelation you know what you're doing you're accepting christ you leave those people behind and it's just you and god across on dry ground now it comes to the other side elisha is the type of the bride elijah is the type of christ and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee ask and it shall be given unto thee before i be taken away from thee and elijah said now if you go and you you read christ he comes vote and he he dies on calvary he's rosen again but he has to ascend up so that the ministry can continue in the disciples they have to go sit and wait in the upper room to receive the holy spirit you see christ had to go up so that the ministry could could continue now elijah has to go up so that the ministry can't continue now elisha you as a right underneath that anointing underneath the anointing underneath the headship of christ the only thing that can come out of your mouth is wherever else should we go he says let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me what does the brother branham say at first he said greater works as in more but then they came and they corrected that he says greater works as in speaking something into existence out of nothing is the third pool so we have a double portion if you will of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me always eyes on christ always your eyes on christ not the prophet christ elisha had to watch the word and the move that the word made it christ made if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold so now they're just walking and fellowshipping on the other side of jordan that's where you find fellowship with christ that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elisha sought and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces all righteousnesses but filthy rags we lay aside our own garment and we accept the mantle the covering of christ headship he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan he stood he stopped he stopped and he's looking at the river jordan and he's saying well i gotta cross the river jordan i've got a cross to get access the word brought me here the word will take you home so elisha elijah takes elisha takes the mantle and he says where is the lord god of elijah and when he had also smitten the water so he says where is the god of elijah and he smites the waters he took action and through entitlement said where's the god of elijah they say that's an arrogant spirit no it's not it's confidence it's confidence that he had faith in god's word and he smites the waters in faith he went into action and then god responded by dividing the waters and he walked across and he went over on dry land you see here's here we go this is just a quote here where banana says well elijah was a type of christ being translated and elijah was a type of the church that was to take his place and finish his ministry with a double portion finished his ministry continuing of the word but the only way for that to happen was if elisha took the mantle of elijah type of christ and clothed himself in the word fully submitted to the word of god then that brought forth a ministry that brought deliverance that brought healing that brought all kinds of things that healed the waters the first miracle he does is he goes back and they say hey the waters are are messed up here they're bitter or whatever it says that they were they were poisoned basically and he just says he didn't he doesn't stop and pray or or go seek no he just spoken word says go get that put that in the water you see he knew who he was he knew who he was but we are called the bride is called to finish the ministry of christ a continuing of the word where is the god of elijah he says not where is elijah see you go and read it and you can preach about that the prophets the sons of the prophets go looking for elijah's body they go back for the return ministry but i just elisha says look i told you you wouldn't find him see it continuing where is the god of elijah the anointing of elijah christ was handed down to the bride praise the lord amen without accepting the covering of the word the crossing of jordan is not possible amen you need if you want to cross into the full promises of god's word god's word if you want to cross the river jordan of death into glory you have to be underneath the headship of christ you have to have the covering of christ full obedience amen i think we have said it already headship amen under christ is the bride's covering god's word true headship of god's word is the covering of the bride amen praise the lord physicians want to come tonight it's a beautiful type of christ and his bride these scriptures of headship and these things about the long hair it's more than just modesty for a young woman or an older woman it's more than that it's god speaking to his bride here's what i want you to do i want you to line up with my word i want you in the full obedience it's a beautiful type of christ in his bride first corinthians 11 7 be if you will the second half of the scripture but the woman is the glory of the man you are the glory of christ you are the glory glorified expression of christ to this generation you as a man with a wife and a family are an expression of christ to them amen the bride is the glory of christ your image is an expression of his glory second corinthians 3 16-17 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away has the word been unveiled without that unveiling there's no receiving of the word seed now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty they're looking and they're crying for a man but what they don't realize is what they want is a man who will come under the headship of christ they think they have freedom you think you have freedom in doing it your way but you're the greatest liberty you can ever come to is when you fall under total headshift to christ that is where you find freedom you see you have to give your freedom away to receive true unperverted freedom you have to give of yourself total surrender to christ and when you do that that is where you find your greatest victory james 1 25 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continue with therein not just look and move on but continue with therein he being not a forgetful hearer you're not a forgetful hero you see justify the positive don't tell yourself oh i'm a loser i'm i'm no good or i'm not submitted enough no begin to speak you are beginning to speak that you are find the scriptures that that talk about how you're an overcomer that find the scriptures that talk about how you have liberty and speak those verbally say this is my liberty this is my freedom he being not you being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work james loves action you read the book of james he loves actions i'll show you my faith by my works he says doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed i chopped that up i'm gonna read it again but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed you see you strive forward you push forward you walk forward and stand galatians 5 1 stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage saints of god be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage step under the headship of christ stepped into your liberty and then stand fast stand fast the world wants to pull you away from that the devil wants to pull you away from that but stand fast screw your feet to the floor glue them to the floor and stand fast in your liberty not anyone else's your liberty stand fast and find that perfection in your in you through the promised word of god underneath the headship of christ find your victory there would you come to full obedience to god's word see it's not it's not a harsh thing it's a separation and god is waiting there with open arms loving his eyes to receive you into your liberty but you have to surrender fully to him amen that altar built of lively stones amen let's bow our heads heavenly father oh god i'm so moved beside myself tonight lord jesus i can't hardly contain myself lord to think lord we find our true liberty when we come under full obedience to your word lord the world is denying headship they need no ruler they don't want any police they don't want anything they don't want no order or rules but you are calling us to a totally different thing lord as your bride rises in or underneath your headship that's where we find our power oh god we
