[43:28] brother Moses God bless you my dear

[43:43] God bless all of you amen uh just uh so
[43:48] happy to have you here and this day of
[43:50] natural Fellowship after the service to
[43:53] be able to just visit
[43:54] amen I bring greetings from Brother Jose
[43:57] sister Sefi and the children they were
[43:59] passing through from Colorado and so we
[44:03] had the privilege to eat lunch with them
[44:05] yesterday and uh just to uh
[44:09] they asked for prayer for them and the
[44:12] church in the Tri-Cities and I don't
[44:14] know one of these days we're going to
[44:15] have to have I I don't know what you
[44:18] call it I know some brothers would call
[44:19] it a missionary trip
[44:21] but I want to take some of our Ukrainian
[44:24] brothers and sisters to the Tri-Cities
[44:25] with me they have been having uh I'll
[44:29] get this number wrong I think it was 14
[44:31] 15 16
[44:33] ukrainians from uh been attending a
[44:37] Pentecostal Church there in the
[44:38] Tri-Cities but by their own admission
[44:42] they've just been hungry they're not
[44:44] being fed they're watching the decline
[44:46] of the church the standards and they're
[44:49] just hungry and uh brother Jose met them
[44:53] and they've been visiting the church for
[44:55] a few Services brother Jose asked
[44:58] yesterday that we would come up here in
[45:00] the near future and and Minister and I
[45:03] thought would be nothing finer than to
[45:05] take some with me that could really
[45:07] really relate and interact and there's
[45:11] there's just a lovely atmosphere there
[45:13] amen let's uh remember our sister April
[45:17] I don't see her this morning I know she
[45:18] has a very convoluted work schedule uh
[45:21] just to lift her up in prayer Also let's
[45:24] turn in our Bibles to the Book of Job
[45:26] And I want to speak to you this morning
[45:28] on things that are to be and a title to
[45:32] see him as he is and to see us as we are
[45:37] now my brother and sister to see us as
[45:40] we are
[45:42] is not to stand in front of a mirror and
[45:45] inspect ourselves in that mirror because
[45:47] I'm sorry to tell you that this flesh
[45:50] will always have something that
[45:52] disappoints you there'll always be
[45:54] something that we have said or done and
[45:57] we would then be focused by the devil
[46:01] would focus us back to that and we'll
[46:03] never be satisfied in this flesh but the
[46:06] most important thing my brother and
[46:08] sister is to see who we are in Jesus
[46:12] Christ and to do that we have to see him
[46:14] as he is we cannot just look him as a
[46:18] God that's in the heavens uh that uh you
[46:20] know died for us but he has personality
[46:23] right the prophet of God and explaining
[46:26] the Trinity uh talking about the godhead
[46:28] says you know what you can't have a
[46:30] person without a personality and what we
[46:33] want to do is see God in his personality
[46:35] my brother and sister you say well
[46:37] brother Paul how is that well the
[46:39] personality is the expression of who
[46:41] that person is Right some people are
[46:44] just naturally quiet uh that's
[46:46] identified as their personality some are
[46:49] a little more boisterous identified in
[46:51] their personality some very humble some
[46:55] not so so we want to see God as he is
[46:58] and I trust today by God's grace we can
[47:00] just kind of bring out or Express this
[47:03] as we look here in the Book of Job
[47:05] starting with the 38th chapter in the
[47:08] first verse
[47:09] now you are very familiar with the Book
[47:12] of Job right I believe every one of us
[47:14] has read the book of Job many times over
[47:16] and studied that because it's in there
[47:19] we see this great trial this great uh uh
[47:22] uh battle that is there and we all know
[47:26] just for a moment of foundation we all
[47:29] know that if job had known exactly
[47:35] who he was and what God thought about
[47:37] him it would have just taken all the
[47:39] sting of the battle away
[47:41] and no
[47:44] because we are in an age
[47:46] that God's been revealed the book has
[47:49] been opened
[47:50] and there's still sting
[47:53] in the battle
[47:54] there's still
[47:56] travail they're still uh uh I don't know
[48:00] there's a hundred words that would
[48:01] describe it but you know what I'm saying
[48:03] it it's still the battle is still real
[48:06] and We Know What God Says About Us
[48:09] now job is in a position that he is
[48:12] obedient to God he is serving God and
[48:15] God's Own testimony says nope this is a
[48:17] man that I have complete confidence in
[48:19] complete trust in he is a faithful man
[48:22] he is serving me and
[48:25] job didn't really know 100 that that's
[48:28] how God felt about him so as we'll read
[48:30] this I just want to do that because we
[48:33] want to come and cover uh 38 chapters in
[48:37] that little discourse right there then
[48:39] the Lord answered job out of the
[48:41] Whirlwind and said
[48:43] who is this that darkeneth counsel by
[48:46] words with all knowledge
[48:49] gird up now thy loins like a man
[48:52] for I will demand of thee and answer
[48:55] thou me this my brother and sister was
[48:57] not a passive interaction
[49:00] this was God speaking directly I just
[49:03] want to take a moment
[49:05] has God spoke directly to us
[49:07] amen sometimes it's not comfortable
[49:10] sometimes it does not feel good
[49:11] sometimes God tells us you know what I
[49:14] can't hardly even feel the heat from you
[49:17] but you are a son of God so therefore
[49:19] I'm going to not judge you I'm going to
[49:22] rekindle the flame aren't you glad he
[49:24] comes to rekindle the flame amen but he
[49:28] tells him gird up now thy loins like a
[49:30] man
[49:31] for I will demand of thee and answer
[49:33] thou me where was thou when I laid the
[49:35] foundations of the earth declare if thou
[49:38] Hast understanding who hath laid the
[49:41] measures thereof if thou knowest or who
[49:44] house stretched the line upon it
[49:46] whereupon are the foundations thereof
[49:49] fastened or who laid the Cornerstone
[49:51] thereof
[49:53] when the morning star sang together and
[49:56] all the sons of God shouted for Joy or
[49:59] who shut up the sea with doors when it
[50:01] Break Forth as if it had issued out of
[50:04] the womb when I made the cloud the
[50:06] Garment thereof and thick Darkness a
[50:09] swaddling ban for it and break up for it
[50:12] my decreed place and set bars
[50:15] and doors and said hitherto shalt Thou
[50:19] come but no further and here shalt thou
[50:22] thy proud waves be stayed hast thou
[50:25] commanded the morning since thy days and
[50:28] calls the day spring to know
[50:31] his place
[50:33] very strong conversation
[50:36] very direct God was tired
[50:39] of the position
[50:41] that job was occupying
[50:44] I wonder Saints if you don't mind me
[50:46] just being a little straightforward
[50:47] today I just wonder if sometimes God's
[50:50] not tired
[50:51] of the position
[50:53] we're occupying
[50:56] some strong words
[50:58] we in the human nature don't like strong
[51:00] words do we we don't rejoice as it were
[51:03] to be spoken strongly to
[51:06] but what if God says it's time Church
[51:10] to move
[51:12] time to come out of your position
[51:15] time to quit looking at your Calamity
[51:17] and recognize this is greater than your
[51:19] calamity
[51:21] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord today
[51:23] for your grace your mercy Lord for a
[51:25] time to come and fellowship around the
[51:27] word of God father for you to speak to
[51:30] our hearts
[51:31] and Lord even though I am just a man
[51:34] and I am here with brothers and sisters
[51:37] just men and women
[51:39] we ask you Lord speak strongly to us
[51:42] move us from our position father if our
[51:44] position is not pleasing
[51:46] father bring us into a greater
[51:48] understanding revelation of you
[51:51] Lord we ask this morning Father Lord
[51:54] come down move in our midst speak to us
[51:56] in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:59] amen you may be seated
[52:13] I trust today that
[52:16] each and every one of us could just
[52:18] simply look at this today and
[52:20] take this as a position that God desired
[52:22] to speak to us amen he's not speaking to
[52:25] the one on the other end of the pew he's
[52:27] speaking directly to us
[52:30] now
[52:33] we'll look in job one you don't need to
[52:36] turn there unless you desire to but we
[52:37] see in Job 1 the first chapter that the
[52:40] sons of God were coming before the Lord
[52:43] to present themselves and it was there
[52:45] that they had come to worship and give
[52:47] praise to God but right there on the
[52:50] tail of that comes Satan also into the
[52:52] presence of God and he comes in there
[52:55] now my brother and sister you talk about
[52:56] bold he didn't try to sneak in he just
[52:59] marched in and sometimes that's what
[53:01] happens you know is the devil he just
[53:03] comes and marches in and has an impact
[53:06] upon us and we we don't maybe understand
[53:08] exactly how he could be so bold but
[53:11] we're seeing that he was bold enough to
[53:13] come into the presence of God so he's
[53:15] just pretty bold amen and you look at
[53:18] this and as the whole chapter starts to
[53:21] break down we don't see God grudgingly
[53:24] offering job up
[53:26] for a test
[53:27] God readily offers job up he he doesn't
[53:30] hesitate he says have you considered
[53:33] my servant job
[53:35] so God was not in the least like will
[53:38] job be able to stand this test well will
[53:41] this work out the way I had planned it
[53:43] but God knew exactly where he stood he
[53:46] knew exactly deep down in the heart of
[53:48] job where he stood and he knew that job
[53:51] would be able to stand this test and he
[53:54] readily offers job up to be as we would
[53:57] say in this day and age the guinea pig
[53:58] and it's there that he come now my
[54:01] brother and sister Satan was so
[54:03] confident that he believed that he could
[54:05] cause by the Affliction of the flesh he
[54:09] could cause job to curse God my brother
[54:12] and sister the devil will come in many
[54:15] times he wants to come in in the age
[54:17] that we're living in we understand that
[54:19] it's a season that many false prophets
[54:21] are testified or prophesied to come in
[54:24] and Satan will deceive some by the word
[54:27] but some people my brother and sister
[54:29] just have travail of Flesh travail of
[54:31] life and they just get weary and well
[54:33] doing and Satan just keeps is wearing
[54:36] away at them till they give up but my
[54:39] brother and sister whenever a son or
[54:40] daughter of God has that true seed down
[54:43] in the soul may give up and then
[54:45] something starts carrying them amen
[54:47] something starts holding them and
[54:49] walking as we see in the footsteps on
[54:51] the sands of time and various examples
[54:54] and songs that it's there my brother and
[54:56] sister in our greatest trials he was
[54:58] there all the time can someone say amen
[55:00] amen we kind of think well what is going
[55:03] on in our life what is happening in our
[55:05] family what is happening in our church
[55:07] but I'm telling you my brother and
[55:08] sister he said he would be here he is
[55:11] here and I'm here this morning to
[55:13] testify to you he is here amen we are
[55:16] not sitting here without a God in our
[55:18] presence today but we are setting him
[55:21] and he is waiting many times my brother
[55:23] and sister for us just to call out his
[55:26] name amen he's just waiting for us to
[55:28] reach out to him and we oftentimes
[55:31] believe my brother and sister that that
[55:33] God should come first and offer to help
[55:35] but his word said that I come I'm
[55:38] paraphrasing I come to those who call
[55:41] out my name Amen in our darkest time on
[55:45] trial we should be calling out the name
[55:47] of Jesus Christ louder than ever before
[55:51] amen and so we look and see how that he
[55:54] comes and and uh job my I wonder what
[55:58] job's reaction would have been if he
[55:59] could have looked beyond the veil and
[56:01] saw this taking place and see his God
[56:05] offering him up saying no problem do
[56:08] anything you want to him just don't take
[56:10] his life now my brother and sister to
[56:12] clarify a little on that you realize
[56:14] that the sea Gene of eternal life is in
[56:16] you Satan can't take your life
[56:19] if he wanted to he can take this old
[56:22] Flash
[56:23] but what is this flash compared to the
[56:25] glory in the presence of God Amen so we
[56:28] see how Satan's already limited and so
[56:31] it's there
[56:32] Satan believed that the trials of this
[56:34] life would cause job to curse God but
[56:37] little did he know how strong the seed
[56:39] that had been planted in job in the
[56:42] beginning my brother and sister Satan
[56:44] believes that and he still believes
[56:47] he still believes that he can take and
[56:51] turn Sons and Daughters of God away from
[56:52] the word of God away from our Lord Jesus
[56:54] Christ by simply uh uh giving them
[56:57] trials that are great and we see many
[57:00] people fail and fall under those trials
[57:03] my brother and sister but I'm speaking
[57:05] to the true word seed of Jesus Christ
[57:08] today amen we're not talking just a
[57:10] human flesh because it's that true word
[57:13] seed that won't allow your flesh to quit
[57:18] because I'm telling you if that wasn't
[57:19] the truth we would have quit already
[57:23] amen we've already come on can somebody
[57:25] lift a hand and say we've already faced
[57:27] trials that would have caused us to quit
[57:30] but there's something that's keeping us
[57:32] amen and that is that word seed Gene
[57:35] that has been placed
[57:37] amen you know what happens is we look at
[57:39] the life of Job and see how Satan
[57:42] started he starts right in in the family
[57:46] takes away children
[57:48] he takes away possessions job wasn't
[57:50] worried about the possessions my brother
[57:51] and sister but he did grieve him about
[57:53] his children and it come to a place that
[57:55] his wife so grieved was there she said
[57:58] I've lost my children why don't you just
[58:01] Curse God
[58:02] and then you'll be lost to me too and
[58:04] then I can just settle down into the
[58:06] deepest pit of despair my brother and
[58:09] sister it's there in that realm she
[58:10] didn't know what she was speaking
[58:12] because she did not see the big picture
[58:14] job as he is dealing with his friends
[58:16] imagine you've got friends that are
[58:18] coming down saying you know what for
[58:20] this to come upon you you must have
[58:23] secret sin
[58:25] I pray that the ministry will never come
[58:28] and take a position that when someone's
[58:30] going through a hard trial that they
[58:32] would automatically assume there has to
[58:34] be sin maybe God said this is my servant
[58:37] I'll open the Hedge Satan I'll let you
[58:40] do everything you want to do because
[58:42] they will not turn their back on me
[58:46] and yet people would say well this
[58:49] happened or that happened I wonder what
[58:50] sin is in their life my brother and
[58:52] sister we need to be careful we don't
[58:54] understand the plan of God if we did
[58:56] we'll we'll touch on that a little later
[58:58] if we did we would be all seeing to see
[59:01] the plan of God but we're not all seeing
[59:03] amen we are just Men In the Flesh as
[59:07] ministers we can be anointed by God to
[59:09] speak truth and speak the word but my
[59:11] brother and sister God still veils the
[59:13] prophet of God said God doesn't show
[59:15] Everything To His prophets
[59:18] so there was a prophet people said well
[59:20] now how could brother Branham have said
[59:22] good words about this individual and
[59:23] that individual considering what they
[59:25] are my brother and sister God chose to
[59:27] hide those things from the prophet or if
[59:30] the prophet knew he never spoke them
[59:32] so it's not always expedient my brother
[59:34] and sister
[59:36] so you look at this
[59:41] friends and family
[59:44] imagine you're sitting now around
[59:48] your fire
[59:52] and boils have come upon you
[59:57] now I think we've all had a blister
[59:59] maybe from work or from hiking or
[1:00:01] something
[1:00:05] does it feel better to break the blister
[1:00:07] to leave it
[1:00:09] neither one feels good
[1:00:13] I've never met a blister yet that I
[1:00:15] liked
[1:00:17] because if you break them
[1:00:19] it's painful and if you leave them it's
[1:00:22] painful
[1:00:23] so job is in this position and the
[1:00:26] scripture shows us clearly how he's
[1:00:28] setting there scraping his boils
[1:00:31] he chose that route
[1:00:35] and his friends come on
[1:00:37] what did you do Joe were your friends
[1:00:40] we go to church together
[1:00:42] we socialize together
[1:00:45] what did you do there has to be there
[1:00:49] has to be job you're scraping boils
[1:00:51] you've lost your children you've lost
[1:00:53] your house your animals you've lost all
[1:00:55] of these things job there's got to be a
[1:00:58] sin in your life but let's go back
[1:01:01] and God said no here's a man who is
[1:01:03] perfect before me
[1:01:06] see no Revelation to the friends and to
[1:01:09] the family they could not see the plan
[1:01:11] of God
[1:01:12] but God was there all the time with a
[1:01:15] plan
[1:01:16] amen they were not just wandering
[1:01:19] they were actually anointed to follow
[1:01:21] this plan of God
[1:01:23] and so they see the struggle they see
[1:01:25] the Calamity and they're sure that
[1:01:28] there's an issue
[1:01:29] my brother and sister you realize that
[1:01:31] Satan's goal he doesn't care about our
[1:01:34] flesh no more than nothing he's trying
[1:01:36] to break our connection that we have
[1:01:38] with God that's all he's interested in
[1:01:40] is breaking the connection we have with
[1:01:42] God and if he can break that connection
[1:01:44] then we are like a ship without a Rudder
[1:01:47] we are just floating aimlessly on the
[1:01:49] sea of life and now the Calamity of Life
[1:01:52] won't change my brother and sister go
[1:01:54] out here in the world they don't
[1:01:55] suddenly have it better when they quit
[1:01:57] serving God Amen it gets worse because
[1:02:00] they're now on the sea of life without a
[1:02:03] sail and without a Rudder amen we ought
[1:02:06] to thank God today what he's doing in
[1:02:07] our life because we have a sail the word
[1:02:10] amen and we have his guiding hand as a
[1:02:13] Rudder and we need to just stick the
[1:02:15] course and say whatever it is Lord let
[1:02:17] me be a job
[1:02:19] amen I might be discouraged I might be
[1:02:22] broken down I might believe God has
[1:02:24] forsaken me but the truth of it is I'm
[1:02:27] in God's plan can we say Amen to that
[1:02:29] today I am in God's plan
[1:02:32] not always maybe in his perfect will but
[1:02:35] I am in his will
[1:02:37] amen
[1:02:39] so you look at this
[1:02:41] sometimes things happen in life
[1:02:45] I want each of you if you would please
[1:02:47] just to look back in your own life and
[1:02:49] there's things that have happened
[1:02:51] we cannot explain
[1:02:59] but you know God's doing
[1:03:03] punishing us
[1:03:06] glad you didn't buy that
[1:03:09] God is molding us
[1:03:14] because without a struggle
[1:03:17] character is not molded
[1:03:21] we've heard that preach like how many
[1:03:23] times
[1:03:24] couple zillion
[1:03:29] but
[1:03:30] did hearing it preached mold character
[1:03:32] in you
[1:03:34] all God was doing was making you aware
[1:03:37] that you are going to face something
[1:03:38] that's going to mold character in you
[1:03:41] now to some the idea of being molded
[1:03:44] that way they say if God was a loving
[1:03:47] God
[1:03:49] if God was a loving God he would bring
[1:03:51] us to this position he wouldn't cause
[1:03:53] this to happen in our life but God is a
[1:03:56] loving God can we say Amen to that this
[1:03:58] morning and God says I know oh I hope
[1:04:01] you don't mind me getting personal today
[1:04:03] but some of you are so stubborn amen
[1:04:06] that just telling you this needs to be
[1:04:08] molten in your life would just be like
[1:04:10] rain on a duck's back amen but God says
[1:04:13] I know exactly what it will take to
[1:04:15] bring you to a place and when you see
[1:04:18] the end of the story you will turn
[1:04:21] around and say thank you Lord amen
[1:04:23] because the end of the story for us as
[1:04:26] the passing of our brother Gideon people
[1:04:27] oh he's gone he's gone no my brother and
[1:04:30] sister it's the start of the real story
[1:04:33] it's the start of the story that down in
[1:04:36] our soul that we long for it's a life
[1:04:39] that we have longed for it's a start
[1:04:42] amen it's only the finished of a past
[1:04:45] house
[1:04:46] and God moving us so we're saying oh how
[1:04:48] can this be Lord my life here this is
[1:04:51] not our life our life is in Jesus Christ
[1:04:55] amen and we look around this world right
[1:04:58] now and we can get caught up is it easy
[1:05:00] to get caught up
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:04] reminds me of a little story I say this
[1:05:06] a little bit in humor reminds me of a
[1:05:08] story of a man once told his wife he
[1:05:10] said they had twins he said I want to
[1:05:12] build bunk beds for the twins
[1:05:15] she said are you sure and he said yeah
[1:05:17] I'll save some money
[1:05:19] about five thousand dollars worth of
[1:05:21] tools later
[1:05:22] they have bunk beds
[1:05:24] and his wife said I had no idea bunk
[1:05:27] beds were that expensive
[1:05:29] but my brother and sister we can get so
[1:05:31] caught up in something I need this I
[1:05:34] need that I got to do this I have to do
[1:05:36] this got to go here got to go there
[1:05:39] we get so focused on that the reality of
[1:05:42] our situation fades
[1:05:44] but God says I'm going to bring you
[1:05:46] focus because this is laodicea the most
[1:05:49] deceptive of Ages it's the blackest of
[1:05:51] times it is the culmination of all of
[1:05:54] these other ages brought together and
[1:05:56] tied together my brother and sister when
[1:05:58] you tie a demon to another demon you've
[1:06:00] got something that's pretty powerful but
[1:06:02] when you tie the holy ghost in a son or
[1:06:05] daughter of God to the Holy Ghost and a
[1:06:07] son or daughter of God you've got
[1:06:09] something more powerful than any demon
[1:06:11] ever amen and so God is coming and he's
[1:06:14] molding us and bringing us to a place
[1:06:16] that we can stand and say you know what
[1:06:18] I don't want to be job
[1:06:20] I don't want to be Joe my brother and
[1:06:22] sister I don't want to be sitting by the
[1:06:23] ash Heap and scraping my boils but I'm
[1:06:26] telling you every one of us will have a
[1:06:28] job experience every one of us will come
[1:06:31] to a place in our life that we'll look
[1:06:33] around family or friends or circumstance
[1:06:36] and we'll deny that for Jesus Christ
[1:06:39] amen we'll take a halt of that and say
[1:06:41] I'm sorry this is who I am
[1:06:44] en
[1:06:45] can you explain
[1:06:48] as the song says how do you explain
[1:06:52] my brother and sister we can't explain
[1:06:54] we sat here today we might be thinking
[1:06:56] oh there's things in my life are not
[1:06:58] good I don't like this I don't like that
[1:07:00] I want this to change change it
[1:07:03] change it don't change it by complaint
[1:07:05] don't change it oh I'm not preaching too
[1:07:08] hard am I
[1:07:14] you know when you got a dog in the back
[1:07:16] seat that constantly whines
[1:07:18] you know what you do
[1:07:22] you throw him out of the back seat and
[1:07:24] you throw him in the back of the truck
[1:07:30] now how much you think you're going to
[1:07:31] change God's mind
[1:07:33] by whining
[1:07:37] at least she was in the cab with him
[1:07:43] amen
[1:07:47] but whining becomes a habit
[1:07:50] hmm
[1:07:51] you know they say 30 days can create a
[1:07:53] habit some of it's been whining for 30
[1:07:56] years
[1:07:58] no wonder God's got to move in such a
[1:08:00] fashion to break those spirits to break
[1:08:02] our our view of what this life is I'm
[1:08:05] going to serve the Lord I'm a Believer I
[1:08:07] believe the message of the hour amen but
[1:08:09] you know what God doesn't want you to
[1:08:11] whine while you're believing he wants
[1:08:13] you to shout amen he wants you to claim
[1:08:15] he wants you to stand up and say if God
[1:08:17] said it I believe it and it will come to
[1:08:19] pass and it don't matter what my
[1:08:21] Calamity is amen hallelujah
[1:08:24] look as we were speaking about job and
[1:08:27] our brother David preached a lovely
[1:08:28] service about job I hope he didn't steal
[1:08:31] too much of my thunder
[1:08:32] but you look at that my brother and
[1:08:34] sister job is there he looks this way he
[1:08:36] sees whale he looks this way he sees
[1:08:38] whale he looks this way sees whale he
[1:08:40] looks this way he sees whale he looks up
[1:08:42] he sees whale he looks down he sees
[1:08:44] whale vomit
[1:08:48] and God anointed him
[1:08:50] anointed him moved Beyond like woe is me
[1:08:53] but anointed him to say I see
[1:08:56] I see I look into the temple I look into
[1:08:59] the Tabernacle I look into the glory of
[1:09:02] God and God said he habits his praise of
[1:09:05] his people and God come right down into
[1:09:07] the belly of that whale and met him
[1:09:09] there and if God would come in the
[1:09:11] praise of of uh uh Jonah in the belly of
[1:09:15] the whale if God would come and meet him
[1:09:17] there my brother and sister if we'll
[1:09:19] lift a hand and lift a heart and say
[1:09:21] Lord I feel like complaining but I'm
[1:09:24] going to praise you instead I'm going to
[1:09:26] lift my hands to heaven and say thank
[1:09:29] you Lord this age 2023 you have called
[1:09:33] me and you have kept me and you'll take
[1:09:35] me through this circumstance too
[1:09:38] I was not called to live in this
[1:09:40] circumstance but I was called to live in
[1:09:42] your presence
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:45] see what happens we can't explain it
[1:09:47] what is happening job thought how can
[1:09:50] this be
[1:09:52] how can this be my enemies have never
[1:09:55] they have never done this before I've
[1:09:57] never had this happen my house has never
[1:09:59] fallen down by strong winds and this and
[1:10:02] this all is why how can this all happen
[1:10:05] but he was there and ultimately deep
[1:10:07] down inside if I could present it to you
[1:10:10] this day this fashion deep down inside
[1:10:13] was a little box that was locked
[1:10:17] what do we call that box
[1:10:20] the soul
[1:10:22] job knew he was a son of God
[1:10:26] there was not a question
[1:10:28] but there was Revelation in that soul
[1:10:32] that had not been released
[1:10:34] and God said now is the season now is
[1:10:36] the time now is the circumstance I'm
[1:10:38] going to unlock the Revelation that's
[1:10:40] already down in that Soul now my brother
[1:10:42] and sister job would have stood in
[1:10:44] church lifted his hands he would have
[1:10:46] praised God he would have prayed for
[1:10:48] healing prayed for deliverance prayed
[1:10:50] for whatever is necessary for those
[1:10:52] around him but there was something that
[1:10:54] was not unlocked there there was
[1:10:56] something in job's experience that he
[1:10:58] had never experienced before and God
[1:11:01] says job I'm going to unlock this in you
[1:11:04] now is the season Satan is here Satan is
[1:11:07] powerful but I'm going to unlock
[1:11:09] something not just for you job but an
[1:11:12] example for ages gone by or I mean going
[1:11:15] coming I mean amen so it's there I'm
[1:11:17] going to unlock this that Believers in
[1:11:19] the future will be able to see this
[1:11:22] and understand that it's there for them
[1:11:24] also and so it's there Satan had beat
[1:11:28] him down
[1:11:31] I like mountain tops
[1:11:34] I love experiencing the Mountaintop
[1:11:38] but I tell you what I am who I am today
[1:11:40] because God has allowed me not only to
[1:11:42] go to the valley but fall off a cliff or
[1:11:44] two on the way down
[1:11:46] I don't like that
[1:11:49] time's way back years and years years
[1:11:51] long before I ever was a minister
[1:11:55] I come to places and I was like I think
[1:11:58] I'm just done I'm just done yep I'm just
[1:12:01] done
[1:12:04] and then find myself calling out to God
[1:12:07] what happened when I had got beaten so
[1:12:09] far that Satan says there I've got him
[1:12:12] right where I want him can someone say
[1:12:14] Amen got him right where I want him but
[1:12:16] something down inside started leaking
[1:12:20] out of the box amen something inside
[1:12:23] started to stir and it started to do and
[1:12:27] then we quit right
[1:12:29] no we didn't because we're here today
[1:12:32] because we couldn't quit because that
[1:12:35] was God himself inside stirring causing
[1:12:39] a rumbling amen causing a reaction amen
[1:12:42] so you look at that and realize my
[1:12:44] brother and sister what was happening
[1:12:45] with job job was a righteous man he was
[1:12:48] a church-going man he paid his tithe he
[1:12:50] was faithful in his posts of Duty but it
[1:12:53] was there when Satan had beat him down
[1:12:55] and it come to a place that him in that
[1:12:58] place even his own wife
[1:13:00] speaking
[1:13:01] has enough courage he didn't call her a
[1:13:04] fool but he says you speak
[1:13:07] as a foolish woman
[1:13:12] and the greatest thing that God can give
[1:13:14] us out of salvation outside of Salvation
[1:13:16] is a good wife
[1:13:18] you realize how defeated that household
[1:13:20] was
[1:13:22] to the point that job's own wife
[1:13:27] said I think God's forsaken us why don't
[1:13:29] you just curse him and just die get it
[1:13:31] over with
[1:13:33] we can't endure this any longer
[1:13:36] and it was in that position that Satan's
[1:13:38] ordering the balloons of the cake all of
[1:13:40] the little Hoots and whatever's for the
[1:13:43] party
[1:13:44] that God says now it's time for me to
[1:13:47] step on the scene
[1:13:49] now I'm going to show you I'm going to
[1:13:52] give you a breakdown
[1:13:56] job I'm going to give you a breakdown of
[1:13:58] what I already deposited in you
[1:14:03] I'm going to show you what's in there
[1:14:05] you knew oh can someone lift a hand and
[1:14:07] say thank you Lord we know there's
[1:14:10] something in there my brother and sister
[1:14:11] but God sometimes has to come and give
[1:14:14] the breakdown of what it really is
[1:14:17] inside of you and I we're not just
[1:14:19] Christians we have come as a prophet
[1:14:22] showed us as minor Gods at part of Jesus
[1:14:26] Christ himself in flesh today this is
[1:14:29] not a human that's buffeted by the winds
[1:14:32] this is God himself walking on the Earth
[1:14:35] today
[1:14:36] amen and we forget that we forget that
[1:14:40] but God wants to teach us that lesson in
[1:14:42] such a fashion we'll never forget
[1:14:45] oh have the trials been hard
[1:14:49] wait till God turns the heat up
[1:14:53] and we say I don't think I can handle
[1:14:55] anymore yes you can
[1:14:57] because you have God's Own nature
[1:14:59] amen as we know he could have on the
[1:15:02] cross called Ten Thousand Angels could
[1:15:05] have come leveled the whole city if he
[1:15:07] had wanted to but he was there and when
[1:15:10] it's a place then it reaches the
[1:15:12] ultimate level he's crying out Lord let
[1:15:16] this pass from me and did God take it
[1:15:19] away from him no sir he gave him
[1:15:21] strength to endure it gave him strength
[1:15:24] to finish the word in fact he himself
[1:15:26] declares it is finished he saw the
[1:15:29] culmination coming and he says it is
[1:15:32] finished I have saw the finish of the
[1:15:35] plan of God and I'm going to speak with
[1:15:37] confidence this morning my brother and
[1:15:38] sister that we will stand in that day in
[1:15:41] that hour and we ourselves will be able
[1:15:43] to speak the words of our Lord Jesus
[1:15:45] when we see that final run see that
[1:15:48] final gate the veil opened before us
[1:15:50] we'll be able to testify it is finished
[1:15:53] thank you Lord I would have quit here
[1:15:56] here here here but I have finished the
[1:15:59] race it is finished
[1:16:01] excuse me excited
[1:16:04] Hallelujah
[1:16:06] see this is not a god of History
[1:16:09] my brother and sister this time goes on
[1:16:12] I don't want to plant the wrong
[1:16:14] fought with you
[1:16:16] but I'm getting tired of us preaching
[1:16:18] the message
[1:16:20] as a message of History

[1:17:02] explain but he's moving amen amen amen
[1:17:06] he's the god of your present
[1:17:07] circumstance
[1:17:08] amen what did he do it comes to a place
[1:17:11] in a Time
[1:17:13] that God says job
[1:17:17] gird up yourself
[1:17:22] now how do we gird ourselves Saints
[1:17:27] the word shows us that we're clothed
[1:17:30] in the word of God
[1:17:35] what is that Christ himself amen amen
[1:17:38] we're not going over here trying to
[1:17:40] build us a paper mache dress
[1:17:46] gird yourself up
[1:17:50] I want answers from you Joe
[1:17:59] I want answers Joe
[1:18:02] I don't want a bunch of mumbling I don't
[1:18:04] want a bunch of complaining I don't want
[1:18:06] whining I want answers
[1:18:12] prophet of God
[1:18:14] gave us a very Stern
[1:18:16] word and indictment to the denominations
[1:18:22] what have you done with this Jesus
[1:18:24] called Christ
[1:18:26] he's coming he's asking a question of us
[1:18:29] what have we done
[1:18:30] with this Jesus called Christ
[1:18:33] are we making him welcome
[1:18:36] or do we call upon him in a time of
[1:18:38] convenience
[1:18:40] I've been guilty of that any of you I
[1:18:42] mean you don't have to admit it but I
[1:18:44] will admit I I have been in my life
[1:18:46] before
[1:18:47] in a time of my life before that I
[1:18:51] called on God out of convenience
[1:18:54] namely a pickup hanging by one rock over
[1:18:56] a large large Canyon
[1:19:00] I desperately wanted God to show up
[1:19:02] right at that moment
[1:19:06] I hadn't thought about him in the
[1:19:07] previous week two or three
[1:19:10] but I sure wanted him to show up
[1:19:12] right then
[1:19:14] and to finish the back story of that is
[1:19:18] when they finally hooked on to State
[1:19:20] snow plow hooked onto the pickup they're
[1:19:22] not supposed to but the guy says well I
[1:19:24] want to see your pickup fall down in the
[1:19:26] canyon while we wait for someone
[1:19:29] and they hooked on that and pulled the
[1:19:30] slack in the rock that was holding the
[1:19:33] pickup fell in the canyon
[1:19:35] to realize we are so close to calamity
[1:19:41] and had given zero attention to God
[1:19:47] but when we called on his name
[1:19:49] he came
[1:19:52] amen amen amen that's the God we serve
[1:19:55] Saints
[1:19:57] amen that's how faithful our God is why
[1:20:00] because he's not here my brother and
[1:20:01] sister we as the bride of Christ can we
[1:20:04] claim that today we as the bride of
[1:20:06] Christ are not here to be judged we're
[1:20:09] here to be purified we're here to be
[1:20:11] washed we're here to be prepared and God
[1:20:14] is anointing us to judge ourselves and
[1:20:17] that we would look in the word and say
[1:20:18] Lord help me to line up to this that's
[1:20:20] who I want to be Lord
[1:20:22] and I believe this was the heart of job
[1:20:24] but he could never maybe he could live
[1:20:26] the life but he couldn't really
[1:20:27] understand why
[1:20:29] that's one of the problems our young
[1:20:31] people have this day there's something
[1:20:32] stirring down in the heart and soul to
[1:20:35] serve God but they don't know why the
[1:20:39] world is so pretty
[1:20:41] the world is so pretty my brother and
[1:20:43] sister
[1:20:45] yeah the world is so pretty
[1:20:48] and yet there's something inside that
[1:20:50] says I want to serve God
[1:20:52] and the devil offers all kinds of
[1:20:55] reasons why we should serve him
[1:20:58] and God just says come follow me
[1:21:05] I'll guarantee you there's not one of us
[1:21:07] today would walk away or even think
[1:21:09] about walking away if we ever had been
[1:21:11] beyond the curtain of time
[1:21:14] one Glimpse beyond the curtain of time
[1:21:17] it would be finished
[1:21:21] but did you know that everything that's
[1:21:23] beyond the curtain of time is already in
[1:21:27] you
[1:21:34] come to with what is happening and I say
[1:21:37] every day that goes by I I can speak for
[1:21:40] myself I trust I'm speaking for you
[1:21:42] every day that goes by what's in the box
[1:21:45] is more real than it was yesterday what
[1:21:47] is it the same thing that happened to
[1:21:50] job is happening to you and I God is
[1:21:52] bringing us face to face with not a
[1:21:55] religion not a message of the hour not
[1:21:58] God's Central Prophet but we are
[1:22:00] starting to see who we are in the plan
[1:22:03] of God and as it opens up the life
[1:22:07] becomes more real to us and there is
[1:22:09] more power put on display you say
[1:22:12] brother Paul where's that power you're
[1:22:14] overcoming aren't you you're still
[1:22:16] standing aren't you you haven't give up
[1:22:18] laid down and died yet have you there's
[1:22:20] power coming to meet the circumstance
[1:22:24] we have the answer my brother and sister
[1:22:27] to the devil's question
[1:22:29] Hallelujah
[1:22:31] amen so God comes he says you know I
[1:22:34] want these answers where were you
[1:22:36] good question but aren't you glad today
[1:22:38] you can answer that question
[1:22:40] where were you
[1:22:42] I was in you Lord
[1:22:44] amen I was already manifested in you
[1:22:47] Lord I was in the palms of your hands I
[1:22:50] was in your heart I was written in the
[1:22:52] Lamb's Book of Life I know where I was
[1:22:55] when the foundation of the Earth was
[1:22:57] laid my brother and sister we have that
[1:23:00] benefit today that job did not
[1:23:02] understand he had not that Revelation
[1:23:04] but God has been gracious in our hour
[1:23:07] and every little thing of the word that
[1:23:09] has come people are there will are the
[1:23:11] Seals open or not is this this what
[1:23:14] about Thunders what about viles how
[1:23:16] about we build relationship and when we
[1:23:19] get relationship the importance of those
[1:23:21] things will be revealed to us and you'll
[1:23:24] find that your key to get into glory is
[1:23:26] not going to be explaining the Thunders
[1:23:28] or the vials my brother and sister
[1:23:30] it's going to be relationship with him
[1:23:33] Hallelujah
[1:23:35] for the word says He never he never
[1:23:38] spoken says uh uh now you didn't receive
[1:23:42] my education
[1:23:44] but he turns them away he says because
[1:23:46] I never knew you
[1:23:50] that's personal
[1:23:51] that's intimate
[1:23:57] well Hallelujah
[1:23:59] amen
[1:24:08] now
[1:24:09] I have the quote of all quotes here
[1:24:14] but the nice thing about it Saints is
[1:24:17] when we get through this quote
[1:24:21] we'll just almost be done
[1:24:25] now we see
[1:24:28] the attribute sons of his spirit
[1:24:32] have not yet entered into the word form
[1:24:35] body
[1:24:37] but a theophany this body is subject to
[1:24:40] the word and Earnest waiting for the
[1:24:43] earnest change of the body
[1:24:45] now the difference between him and you
[1:24:48] as a son see he was at the beginning the
[1:24:51] word in morphe body he came in and lived
[1:24:55] in that in the person of Melchizedek now
[1:24:59] my brother and sister when we realize
[1:25:01] that this person of Melchizedek was
[1:25:04] absolutely none other than our Lord
[1:25:06] Jesus Christ standing there and in that
[1:25:09] he was imparting right he himself no man
[1:25:12] has seen God so God stepped into a body
[1:25:14] though he could reveal himself and then
[1:25:17] people would just be looking on this
[1:25:19] body of Flesh amen thank you Lord
[1:25:22] has anybody seen Jesus Christ here at
[1:25:24] church this morning
[1:25:27] Hallelujah he's sitting all over these
[1:25:29] pews he's been worshiping he's been
[1:25:31] lifting his hands amen man saying Amen
[1:25:34] to the word
[1:25:35] oh God will say Amen to his own word you
[1:25:38] better believe it
[1:25:39] amen so if we understand who we are
[1:25:42] right this is part of the secret that's
[1:25:44] hid in the Box
[1:25:47] this is the part that we need Revelation
[1:25:50] to understand
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:54] now look at this then later we never
[1:25:57] heard no more of Melchizedek because he
[1:26:00] become
[1:26:01] this would be amorphe
[1:26:03] Jesus Christ
[1:26:05] Melchizedek was the priest but he became
[1:26:08] Jesus Christ now you bypass that because
[1:26:12] in that form he knowed all things and
[1:26:15] you have never been able to know that
[1:26:17] yet amen aren't you glad that we don't
[1:26:19] know all things
[1:26:21] oh my brother and sister I'm telling you
[1:26:23] in this human element if we knew all
[1:26:25] things we wouldn't get out of bed we'd
[1:26:28] make one last trip down to Walmart and
[1:26:30] buy thicker curtains bigger pillow
[1:26:31] bigger you know comforter and we would
[1:26:34] just curl up and snug down in there
[1:26:36] because the word of God shows us and the
[1:26:39] hour we live in that oh my Millions upon
[1:26:42] millions of demons have been turned
[1:26:44] loose I don't like the idea of going out
[1:26:46] there and facing those demons because
[1:26:48] you see this flesh man doesn't do well
[1:26:51] with demons but I'm telling you this
[1:26:53] Spirit man when this Spirit man catches
[1:26:56] a revelation of who he is amen we can
[1:26:59] walk out and say you know what I'm not
[1:27:01] afraid of the devil I'm not afraid of
[1:27:03] what he's done he might have a a dad a
[1:27:06] husband he might have a wife a daughter
[1:27:08] Sons whatever he might have I'm not
[1:27:10] afraid of those demons in the season
[1:27:13] that God ordained Amen in the season my
[1:27:16] brother and sister that God ordained
[1:27:21] but we get nervous
[1:27:24] we get nervous
[1:27:27] and a good shepherd can look out upon
[1:27:30] the flock
[1:27:33] and he can see the behavior of the Sheep
[1:27:37] and he don't have to go over there and
[1:27:38] ask him are you feeling all right or is
[1:27:40] there something going he can just see
[1:27:41] the behavior of the Sheep
[1:27:43] and he can recognize
[1:27:45] I have a real life experience of that
[1:27:47] once we were
[1:27:49] young men full of
[1:27:51] energy
[1:27:53] there was Lakes up in the Sawtooth way
[1:27:55] up there lakes that you had to hike for
[1:27:58] miles and miles and miles to get to them
[1:28:00] but the attraction was these great big
[1:28:03] fat fish
[1:28:05] giant fish
[1:28:08] and
[1:28:09] we went up fishing there in the Sawtooth
[1:28:13] one night and we got to the trailhead
[1:28:15] and
[1:28:18] it was dark
[1:28:20] and there was a sheep camp and the
[1:28:22] meadow was just clear full of sheep
[1:28:25] and there was the little trailer
[1:28:28] and uh
[1:28:33] the shepherd he was from Spain young man
[1:28:38] oh he was so excited the old guy just
[1:28:40] went in and went to bed the young guy
[1:28:41] was so excited
[1:28:43] he spoke good English
[1:28:44] and he sat down and we started visiting
[1:28:48] and pretty soon
[1:28:49] one of the dogs
[1:28:51] made a weird little
[1:28:55] and that old guy combusting out of their
[1:28:57] camp trailer
[1:28:59] young guy would stand on his feet
[1:29:02] and we're all like is there something
[1:29:03] there I had a pistol with me
[1:29:06] first thing you think
[1:29:08] a bear
[1:29:09] if you ever watched all those things a
[1:29:11] bear is going to pop out behind that
[1:29:12] little Bush right there with blood on
[1:29:13] its teeth big claws
[1:29:15] it's gonna look like a shadow moving
[1:29:16] across the land
[1:29:18] you know I'm to the pickup I got a gun
[1:29:23] a young man
[1:29:24] bear
[1:29:27] and the dog
[1:29:28] and those two Shepherds went running off
[1:29:31] in the dark
[1:29:33] and I was lying I hope he doesn't yell
[1:29:36] help
[1:29:39] because if he yells help I'm gonna drive
[1:29:42] to the top of the mountain and yell help
[1:29:44] myself
[1:29:48] later
[1:29:50] he had a big old Pyrenees dog there
[1:29:53] and that dog ran so fast now this might
[1:29:57] seem hard to believe
[1:29:58] it ran so fast you can't run through the
[1:30:01] Sheep there's so many sheep you can't
[1:30:03] run around them this dog literally
[1:30:05] leaped on top of the Sheep
[1:30:07] and ran across the backs of the sheep so
[1:30:10] fast the Sheep didn't even have time to
[1:30:12] react
[1:30:13] and then as there was just enough light
[1:30:16] we saw this black object going across
[1:30:18] the far end of the meadow being chased
[1:30:20] by a large white object
[1:30:23] going out
[1:30:24] and they come back
[1:30:28] and we're like that was really a bear
[1:30:30] and he goes oh yeah
[1:30:32] bear like slam
[1:30:38] yeah the bear
[1:30:40] amen the lion he likes lamb
[1:30:45] and God works in such mysterious ways
[1:30:48] it was the lesson I've never forgotten
[1:30:50] my life
[1:30:51] that in our little moment of security we
[1:30:54] were around the fire
[1:30:56] and all is well the sun has gone down
[1:31:00] and all is well
[1:31:02] but the enemy is just beyond the light
[1:31:06] are you with me Saints the enemy is just
[1:31:09] beyond the light the enemy didn't care
[1:31:10] the fire we had because there were sheep
[1:31:13] out there in the darkness and he could
[1:31:16] stay beyond the light and still get to
[1:31:19] sheep but God says I've called you out
[1:31:22] of Darkness into this glorious light
[1:31:24] amen this light is our protection it is
[1:31:27] not here to hurt us it's not here to
[1:31:30] make us feel bad about ourselves it's
[1:31:32] not here to discourage us it's here to
[1:31:34] keep us in this age that we live in this
[1:31:37] dark Wicked age is here to keep us
[1:31:42] and as a side note to that little story
[1:31:44] my brother and sister
[1:31:48] I felt compelled to go to the pickup
[1:31:51] there were several of us there wasn't
[1:31:52] just me
[1:31:53] and I bought this one pound bag of M M's
[1:31:57] peanuts M MS
[1:32:00] and I thought oh how to share
[1:32:03] and that young man
[1:32:05] sitting there across the fire and I
[1:32:06] pulled the top and peeled that back they
[1:32:08] didn't have zip lock back then I peeled
[1:32:11] that open he stood up come around the
[1:32:13] fire
[1:32:14] he didn't put his hand out can I have
[1:32:16] some he's like I love I love
[1:32:22] you know what happened I got a few
[1:32:24] peanuts he finally just took the back
[1:32:25] from me and went on his side the fire
[1:32:27] and ate them all
[1:32:29] now my brother and sister I want to say
[1:32:31] let's get around the fire let's not be
[1:32:33] selfish let's let the word of God be
[1:32:36] something that is so in us oh so
[1:32:38] desirous to us I don't want just a
[1:32:41] little bit I want my hands filled in
[1:32:44] fact just give me all of it
[1:32:46] amen because I have a desire for that
[1:32:49] later he told us he says I apologize I
[1:32:52] feel so bad but he says I sometimes
[1:32:55] dream of them
[1:33:05] you come
[1:33:09] like Adam like me you come from the
[1:33:12] attribute to the flesh to be tempted
[1:33:16] wow
[1:33:18] Lord couldn't I have just took a
[1:33:20] little written test
[1:33:24] hmm
[1:33:26] be tempted
[1:33:30] but when this life is finished here if
[1:33:32] this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:33:35] have one already waiting that's where we
[1:33:38] go that is the word then we can look
[1:33:41] back and see what we've done now we
[1:33:45] don't understand it
[1:33:47] come on my brother and sister we're
[1:33:49] standing here I promise you that every
[1:33:51] one of you of you be honest this morning
[1:33:53] will be sitting here saying Lord I don't
[1:33:56] understand why I don't understand what
[1:33:59] has happened here I don't understand it
[1:34:01] I don't understand how I have a son that
[1:34:04] I raised my wife and I raised in the
[1:34:06] house of God he knows the truth even to
[1:34:09] this day he will tell you I know it's
[1:34:11] the truth Dad but he doesn't live it I
[1:34:14] don't understand that
[1:34:16] but one thing I do know is a prophet of
[1:34:19] God stood on the word and said if I'll
[1:34:21] put the blood on the doorposting on the
[1:34:23] lentil if I will clean my house out if I
[1:34:26] will do these things my God will take
[1:34:29] care of the rest I just have to believe
[1:34:33] Hallelujah
[1:34:35] see we don't have to understand
[1:34:36] everything but I'm telling you when the
[1:34:39] box starts getting broken open it don't
[1:34:41] matter where they're at or what the
[1:34:43] circumstance is and job's position it
[1:34:46] didn't matter when it started to come
[1:34:48] job started to catch a revelation there
[1:34:50] was something there that job had not
[1:34:52] caught before my brother and sister amen
[1:34:55] we don't understand it we've never
[1:34:57] become the word we've just become the
[1:34:59] flesh man not the word
[1:35:01] hmm I'm the word I'm not I'm not
[1:35:05] contradicting the prophet I am the word
[1:35:07] but that word is resident in this flesh
[1:35:10] so the word is sound here in the box and
[1:35:13] the box has got to be opened up and as
[1:35:15] we get farther down the road here
[1:35:18] there's more coming out that we start to
[1:35:20] understand understand
[1:35:22] what is it doing it's bringing us into
[1:35:25] the presence of almighty God it is not
[1:35:29] religion where we sign up and we agree
[1:35:31] and we do and we follow my brother and
[1:35:34] sister this is the word already
[1:35:36] deposited in you taking over your body
[1:35:40] your mind your thoughts your attributes
[1:35:44] oh Hallelujah
[1:35:47] now what is the rapture
[1:35:53] body change
[1:35:55] this actually becoming kind of a
[1:35:57] controversial thing in the message
[1:35:58] believe it or not maybe not out into the
[1:36:01] church realm so much
[1:36:03] but definitely hit the preacher Realm
[1:36:05] some say we're already in the Millennium
[1:36:07] so we can do whatever we want
[1:36:12] when you all leave church today just
[1:36:15] empty your wallet
[1:36:17] really
[1:36:20] nonsense
[1:36:23] nonsense my brother and sister but
[1:36:25] Millennium is not going to have that out
[1:36:27] there
[1:36:29] what are people thinking
[1:36:32] but they have struggled all they can
[1:36:33] struggle they've come to the end of
[1:36:35] their strength and they won't allow the
[1:36:37] Holy Ghost
[1:36:39] to take them further
[1:36:41] God sent a prophet I'm sorry to speak so
[1:36:43] direct it's more than God sent to
[1:36:45] Prophet
[1:36:46] amen the prophet said I want to
[1:36:49] introduce you to Jesus Christ amen there
[1:36:52] is the introduction that matters amen
[1:36:54] there's where the box as it were the
[1:36:57] soul starts to be opened up and what
[1:36:59] God's already placed in there starts to
[1:37:01] come out and take hosts you know you
[1:37:03] realize my brother and sister were just
[1:37:04] a host to the Holy Ghost
[1:37:06] right hey Ben
[1:37:08] yeah just a dwelling place we're just
[1:37:11] the host we open the door we let him in
[1:37:14] amen but when we open the door to let
[1:37:16] him in he's actually coming out
[1:37:24] yeah
[1:37:25] because he already put the seed in there
[1:37:27] it's already there
[1:37:29] we opened it up
[1:37:30] amen free moral agency we say Lord come
[1:37:33] into me sir our Lord I want to serve you
[1:37:36] I need to
[1:37:37] and then the door opens and he comes out
[1:37:40] and the body starts to change a whole
[1:37:41] nother sermon amen
[1:37:44] so but and look clearly it makes it
[1:37:47] clear you'll never be the word unless
[1:37:49] you was a thought at the beginning
[1:37:52] see you you can't suddenly just become
[1:37:54] the word people say oh praise God I got
[1:37:57] saved
[1:37:58] you know yeah you did but you always was
[1:38:01] it just now is an Awakening to who you
[1:38:04] always have been
[1:38:06] there's an Awakening that's taking place
[1:38:09] that's right
[1:38:11] it proves the predestination of God say
[1:38:14] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:38:16] thought you had to be in the thinking
[1:38:18] first but you see in order to stand
[1:38:21] Temptation you had to bypass the
[1:38:24] theophany
[1:38:26] right how glorious that would have been
[1:38:28] just to move right into a theophany form
[1:38:31] but what character would we have
[1:38:34] now if you never had any trials never no
[1:38:37] Temptations you always lived in the
[1:38:38] presence of God that would be wonderful
[1:38:40] but that wasn't the plan
[1:38:47] you see how Satan I just want to
[1:38:49] interject this it's not my notes but I
[1:38:51] want to interject this you see how Satan
[1:38:53] has has fooled us
[1:38:57] we get this mindset ourselves or maybe
[1:39:00] we're judgmental to apply it to someone
[1:39:02] else
[1:39:04] here's a family
[1:39:06] they put a lot of Trials
[1:39:09] what's wrong with them
[1:39:11] well let me present you another chapter
[1:39:13] of this
[1:39:16] here's a family
[1:39:18] many trials
[1:39:20] oh how much confidence
[1:39:23] God must have in them
[1:39:27] now God uses trials to move us
[1:39:30] I'm not taking that away sometimes God
[1:39:32] uses fiery trials to move us amen when
[1:39:36] nothing else will move us the preaching
[1:39:37] of the word won't move us God just says
[1:39:39] okay I'll let's fiery trial we've got to
[1:39:41] be careful about praying oh Lord take
[1:39:43] this family or this person's struggle
[1:39:46] away from them that's not our business
[1:39:47] leave that to God but my brother and
[1:39:50] sister let's not be judgmental either
[1:39:52] because we don't know but what God had
[1:39:54] so much confidence in job if job was in
[1:39:56] our service today amen and we have our
[1:39:59] brother job but if job was here in the
[1:40:02] service today many of us will look and
[1:40:04] say what is wrong with you
[1:40:08] when in reality there was so much that
[1:40:10] was right
[1:40:12] and God was actually just opening the
[1:40:15] word to job
[1:40:18] kind of in a rough way
[1:40:21] can you be handled rough and not be
[1:40:23] offended
[1:40:25] well if it was God doing it
[1:40:28] maybe it is
[1:40:31] you had to come down the flesh to be
[1:40:33] tempted by sin and then if you stand all
[1:40:36] the father hath given me will come to me
[1:40:38] and I'll raise him up in the last days
[1:40:40] see you had to be first and then you see
[1:40:43] he come right down the regular line from
[1:40:46] the attribute to but before the
[1:40:48] foundation of the world his name was put
[1:40:50] on the Lamb's Book of Life then from
[1:40:52] that he became the word this talking
[1:40:54] about our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:40:55] theophany and could appear and disappear
[1:40:57] and then he become Flash and return back
[1:41:00] again resurrected that same body in a
[1:41:02] glorified condition but you you bypass
[1:41:06] the theophany
[1:41:07] and become flesh man to be tempted by
[1:41:10] sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:41:12] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:41:15] we have not yet the bodies right so the
[1:41:18] Tabernacles there
[1:41:20] amen or you understand what the
[1:41:22] prophet's saying but look when this body
[1:41:25] receives the spirit of God The Immortal
[1:41:27] Life inside of you it throws this body
[1:41:30] in subjection to God hallelujah he
[1:41:33] that's born of God does not commit sin
[1:41:35] look at the transition God is bringing
[1:41:37] in US
[1:41:40] amen he who is in Christ my brother and
[1:41:43] sister that sin hath no part it cannot
[1:41:46] be laid to his account and you realize
[1:41:49] this is what's happening it's there well
[1:41:51] we believe but my brother and sister
[1:41:53] there's a level of receiving this that
[1:41:56] causes us to change our Outlook it
[1:41:58] changes how we see things amen and so
[1:42:01] he's born of God does not commit sin he
[1:42:04] cannot sin Romans 8 1. now I want to
[1:42:06] tell you my brother and sister how many
[1:42:08] of us I want you to be self introspect
[1:42:12] to yourself
[1:42:13] how many of us when we do or say
[1:42:15] something wrong
[1:42:16] stop and say
[1:42:18] I didn't do it in the first place
[1:42:22] we talk about it
[1:42:25] but when Satan can come and shoot that
[1:42:28] little Dart of condemnation and you
[1:42:31] still feel that Dart of condemnation you
[1:42:35] don't have a full revelation of that
[1:42:37] right there
[1:42:39] amen
[1:42:41] oh God I want that Revelation I want
[1:42:45] that Revelation to be able to live and
[1:42:47] when I make a mistake stand up and say
[1:42:49] Lord I for ask me Lord please forgive me
[1:42:53] I ask you forgive me Lord and just walk
[1:42:55] off without one second thought about
[1:42:58] that you say boy that sounds pretty that
[1:43:00] sounds pretty far out there brother Paul
[1:43:01] it's the word
[1:43:03] it's a word it's a life amen it's what's
[1:43:06] down in that Soul when you know that you
[1:43:08] know that you know that you are a son or
[1:43:10] daughter of God and there's nothing
[1:43:12] going to draw you away from him
[1:43:15] I'm not too far off in left field for
[1:43:17] you am I
[1:43:18] Hallelujah
[1:43:19] because I didn't bring them but boy I
[1:43:22] can sure produce a whole lot more
[1:43:24] amen so look at this you don't have to
[1:43:26] say if all I could just quit drinking if
[1:43:28] I could just get in Christ and it's all
[1:43:31] gone see because your body is subject to
[1:43:34] the spirit it's no more subject to the
[1:43:36] things of the world they're dead they
[1:43:38] are dead your sins are buried in baptism
[1:43:41] and you're a new creation in Christ and
[1:43:44] your body becoming subject to the spirit
[1:43:46] try to live the right kind of life like
[1:43:49] you women Amen brother Brown gets a
[1:43:51] little strong here like you women
[1:43:52] claiming you got the Holy Ghost uh going
[1:43:55] out there and wearing shorts and things
[1:43:56] how could you do it how could the spirit
[1:43:59] of God in you ever let you do such a
[1:44:01] thing as that it just can't be so
[1:44:03] certainly it can't be he's not a filthy
[1:44:05] Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when
[1:44:08] you become subject to that said Spirit
[1:44:10] it throws your whole being subject to
[1:44:13] that spirit
[1:44:15] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:44:17] but this seed of word made manifest or
[1:44:20] quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and when
[1:44:23] the Bible said don't do this that body
[1:44:25] quickly turns to it there's no question
[1:44:27] just what is it it's the earnest of the
[1:44:29] Resurrection this body will be raised up
[1:44:33] again because it's already started
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:38] Hallelujah can you stand and not stand
[1:44:41] literal with me but can you stand with
[1:44:43] me today amen I've already begun my
[1:44:45] Rapture Journey amen I'm already uh
[1:44:48] going through a body change why because
[1:44:51] the box is fully opened the open word in
[1:44:57] our hour fully opened it my brother and
[1:44:59] sister that we can stand here today
[1:45:01] anointed by the Holy Ghost filled with
[1:45:04] the Holy Ghost led by the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:07] walk in the presence of almighty God
[1:45:11] it's no longer religion it's life it's
[1:45:14] relationship not a religion oh some
[1:45:18] people will be like who are you to say
[1:45:20] we're already in the Rapture that's
[1:45:21] false Doctrine
[1:45:24] well I don't know this whole body is
[1:45:25] changing
[1:45:27] all I can say this whole body is
[1:45:30] changing
[1:45:31] and if it's changing and coming and
[1:45:34] being molded by the presence of almighty
[1:45:36] God my brother and sister something's
[1:45:39] happening because a natural course of
[1:45:41] life
[1:45:42] I've heard a minister one time bring it
[1:45:44] very simple he said all you have to do
[1:45:46] is go stand on the side of a mountain
[1:45:48] to see what human nature is
[1:45:52] okay
[1:45:56] the trees
[1:45:59] they fall down
[1:46:02] they don't go up the mountain they go
[1:46:04] down
[1:46:05] it rains hard or it snows and melts the
[1:46:08] dirt the Rocks don't go up the mountain
[1:46:10] they go down
[1:46:13] the valley gets flatter
[1:46:15] the mountains get lower
[1:46:18] the very nature of humanity
[1:46:20] amen
[1:46:22] it's easy to go down
[1:46:24] it's hard
[1:46:26] to go up
[1:46:29] you know
[1:46:32] we were in Israel
[1:46:35] now I hope you catch this point
[1:46:37] kind of the corner of my mind I just
[1:46:41] in Israel my brother and sister
[1:46:46] people there at Masada
[1:46:52] this might sound morbid but
[1:46:55] I don't know that I could stand on top
[1:46:57] of the cable car or hang underneath the
[1:46:59] cable car and feel the same way
[1:47:02] but I feel very secure in the cable car
[1:47:06] and there was people there Masada
[1:47:08] different group
[1:47:09] and the people were like I had no idea
[1:47:11] we had to get in something like this to
[1:47:12] go up to see Masada
[1:47:15] I'm not doing it
[1:47:17] now is that group right in front of us
[1:47:19] that they had to open the gate and work
[1:47:21] those people out the side and down the
[1:47:23] deal there
[1:47:24] and I understood with it
[1:47:26] how they felt
[1:47:29] and the man turned to his wife and said
[1:47:31] well we can still say we've been to
[1:47:33] Masada
[1:47:36] but can you no
[1:47:45] got right to the base of Masada
[1:47:49] got the brochure
[1:47:51] got a picture in front of the sign
[1:47:53] but that's not Masada
[1:47:59] we can be faithful be in the house of
[1:48:01] God
[1:48:03] but if the soul has never caught the
[1:48:04] full revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[1:48:07] can we say that we have it
[1:48:10] I know say that judgmental
[1:48:19] it's already started it was once again
[1:48:21] subject to sin and mire and Corruption
[1:48:23] but now it's got the earnest it's turned
[1:48:26] Heavenly amen now that's the earnest
[1:48:29] that you're going in the Rapture it's
[1:48:31] the earnest see what's happening my
[1:48:33] brother and sister I did you catch what
[1:48:35] the prophet just laid out right there
[1:48:37] you realize what's being stirred in you
[1:48:39] and I right now
[1:48:41] is the rapture
[1:48:43] amen people would say wait wait wait
[1:48:45] that's the catching away we are we've
[1:48:47] got been caught away from this world
[1:48:49] we've been caught away from the lusts of
[1:48:51] the Flesh and pride of life all we can
[1:48:53] stumble we can have troubles and the
[1:48:54] devil will tell you see you've never got
[1:48:56] it but my brother and sister that's the
[1:48:58] flesh man but God's not looking at the
[1:49:00] flesh man he's looking down in the soul
[1:49:02] and he says I know what I put in that
[1:49:06] Soul amen amen it's almost like oh I
[1:49:08] don't know this silly analogy to bring
[1:49:10] it out this way but my brother and
[1:49:11] sister we've got all that equipment at
[1:49:13] home there I've got a computer program
[1:49:15] and I can go in there and type into
[1:49:17] serial number I can go over into this
[1:49:19] part right here and click on it and it
[1:49:21] tells you exactly every nut and bolt
[1:49:24] that machine had when it came out of the
[1:49:26] factory and I'm telling you I know poor
[1:49:28] analogy but God doesn't even have to
[1:49:30] look you don't need a computer he can
[1:49:31] look at that and he can say I know what
[1:49:34] was in that Soul when it come from the
[1:49:36] foundation of the world I don't have to
[1:49:39] wonder I don't have to hope I know what
[1:49:41] was in that soul I put the seed Gene of
[1:49:44] life and the Sea Gene of life is there
[1:49:47] and it will bear fruit because I have
[1:49:50] never oh the devil thinks it's boasting
[1:49:52] but he say I've never lost a one that
[1:49:56] ought to calls us to lift a hand and say
[1:49:58] thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:50:01] Hallelujah
[1:50:03] oh my worst time call
[1:50:06] amen now look at this
[1:50:09] Joe believed that
[1:50:11] that's how he had lived it all those
[1:50:13] years
[1:50:15] he believed that
[1:50:17] get this now
[1:50:19] believing it and having a full
[1:50:21] revelation of it
[1:50:24] are not one and the same
[1:50:28] Lord give us a full revelation
[1:50:31] full revelation of who we are amen that
[1:50:33] when the Devil comes and says you know
[1:50:35] what you made these mistakes that life
[1:50:37] would be different if you hadn't done
[1:50:38] this this and this and you know you just
[1:50:41] ought to give up and we entertain
[1:50:43] thoughts like that
[1:50:46] but I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:50:47] sister that's not who we are no that's
[1:50:49] right
[1:50:50] the Lord allowed job to live
[1:50:54] an experience he didn't have a full
[1:50:56] Revelation though
[1:50:58] that's happening today
[1:51:00] experiencing hard things
[1:51:03] but he come to the place God dealing
[1:51:06] with him so Direct
[1:51:08] that he moves from this place that's
[1:51:10] almost woven to me he moves to this
[1:51:13] place
[1:51:14] that suddenly the Veil
[1:51:16] pulled from his eyes
[1:51:19] and he sees the whole picture
[1:51:21] and he realizes this whole time
[1:51:25] this whole time
[1:51:28] I've been pleasing God
[1:51:31] and I had my ups and downs I had on fire
[1:51:33] and chilly and I was this and that and
[1:51:36] the whole time though
[1:51:38] God was in complete control
[1:51:40] now what does job do
[1:51:42] stop and start to gripe at god well if
[1:51:45] you look at these going on from these
[1:51:48] scriptures onto the end of job you'll
[1:51:51] see that it is one almost continual
[1:51:54] discourse
[1:51:55] of God driving home to job
[1:52:00] the whole picture
[1:52:01] go study it
[1:52:03] I don't need to preach it to you just go
[1:52:04] study it just you can even just you know
[1:52:06] uh just read it about that fast and
[1:52:09] you'll see God is laying every aspect of
[1:52:12] everything job this is this this is this
[1:52:13] this is it this is this this this this
[1:52:16] this this this this this this and job is
[1:52:19] not contesting it job is now absorbing
[1:52:21] this and he's realizing this whole time
[1:52:24] when I thought oh I even got the Holy
[1:52:26] Ghost
[1:52:27] I had it
[1:52:29] now this is not taking away from the
[1:52:31] fact that we have to come to a filling
[1:52:33] or baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[1:52:35] that's not taking away but this is when
[1:52:37] we have come to that and Satan's coming
[1:52:39] like a pickpocket trying to take it back
[1:52:41] amen
[1:52:43] I don't like pickpockets
[1:52:45] amen see where he was see where he was
[1:52:48] going in essence it was the opening of
[1:52:50] the written and Unwritten word to job
[1:52:53] so it is today my brother and sister
[1:52:55] believe it the Lord has allowed you to
[1:52:58] be tested
[1:52:59] Can someone say amen amen I I just might
[1:53:03] be this might be personal forgive me but
[1:53:05] brother Moses you went through a lot of
[1:53:07] struggles the Hedge is open it's not
[1:53:09] your failure my brother the Hedge is
[1:53:11] open and God said I'll let my brother be
[1:53:14] tested I'll let him go and struggle and
[1:53:17] fight and have to press through these
[1:53:19] things it's not that he has failed it's
[1:53:22] I have confidence in him to give full
[1:53:25] access of Satan to the life and it will
[1:53:28] come and he will overcome
[1:53:31] I know that was kind of blunt forgive me
[1:53:33] brother but I say that to encourage you
[1:53:34] Amen in these struggles that we have
[1:53:37] it's not about the failure Satan focuses
[1:53:40] on failure God is here to tell you I
[1:53:43] have confidence in you you're my son
[1:53:46] you're my daughter and I have given
[1:53:49] everything you need is that not what the
[1:53:52] prophet of God said everything you need
[1:53:54] is to make the Rapture amen that's
[1:53:57] paraphrasing it but everything you need
[1:53:59] is already in you oh what's happening
[1:54:02] the box is being opened and when the box
[1:54:06] was open what God deposited on the
[1:54:08] inside is coming out
[1:54:10] oh Hallelujah
[1:54:13] oh it terrifies us if we really saw the
[1:54:16] whole picture
[1:54:17] I'm telling you we're we still are here
[1:54:19] caught in this realm right here
[1:54:22] you realize when God told the devil
[1:54:25] he had full access to your life
[1:54:30] we'd be there going
[1:54:37] God said don't worry about it
[1:54:40] don't worry about it
[1:54:42] it's already in the Box
[1:54:46] it's already down in your soul
[1:54:48] don't worry about it
[1:54:50] have confidence in me
[1:54:52] trust me
[1:54:54] follow me it's already in you
[1:54:59] oh Hallelujah
[1:55:03] amen sister Ruth if you'll come
[1:55:10] you see
[1:55:16] job comes down to the end of this
[1:55:19] brother Gideon put up Psalms 1.
[1:55:22] I wasn't gonna put it I didn't include
[1:55:24] it but I just want to share it real
[1:55:25] quick
[1:55:27] Psalms 1 amazing Psalms follows job
[1:55:31] and Psalm 1 follows
[1:55:34] job
[1:55:46] who's blessed
[1:55:49] where do we take our counsel
[1:55:52] where are we standing
[1:55:54] and where are we sitting
[1:55:57] amen
[1:55:58] I'm not going to walk
[1:56:00] in Satan's Council
[1:56:02] and I'm not going to stand in the the
[1:56:06] courtyard as it were with Satan's
[1:56:09] Witnesses
[1:56:11] I am not going to sit in the seat
[1:56:14] of the unbeliever do you realize saying
[1:56:16] said we set long enough
[1:56:19] people say well they I sat there long
[1:56:21] enough finally I caught the Revelation
[1:56:23] that the message is wrong
[1:56:26] no you sat there long enough to catch
[1:56:28] the spirit of the devil
[1:56:31] because the scripture is telling you not
[1:56:33] to sit with the seed of the scornful
[1:56:34] amen
[1:56:36] because we're just human we just talked
[1:56:38] about how glorious the word is in us but
[1:56:40] my brothers and sisters God still put it
[1:56:42] in a tabernacle of Flesh and this flesh
[1:56:46] is subject to influence
[1:56:50] and if you don't think so
[1:56:52] nah this is going to be a little
[1:56:53] scathing I'm sorry
[1:56:55] but if you don't think so you just go
[1:56:57] visit some Churches that are constantly
[1:57:00] having pyramid schemes go through them
[1:57:08] I said I'd never ever do anything with
[1:57:10] that brother but you know I might I mean
[1:57:12] there's guys getting rich on this thing
[1:57:13] here's my 500.
[1:57:17] and then it creates such an animosity in
[1:57:20] the house of God
[1:57:25] now imagine if I had pyramids schemed
[1:57:27] you
[1:57:28] and over and over I told you this was
[1:57:31] going to make you money gonna make you
[1:57:32] money easy money you all be rich
[1:57:36] never works
[1:57:39] the devil's only one getting rich on
[1:57:41] this Earth
[1:57:42] you better believe it my brother and
[1:57:44] sister it's the devil that's getting
[1:57:45] rich
[1:57:47] and then that same Spirit comes up here
[1:57:49] and says
[1:57:52] now believe the word believe me trust me
[1:57:56] impossible
[1:57:58] we're not going to walk in the Council
[1:58:01] of the ungodly
[1:58:02] we're not going to stand in the way of
[1:58:05] The Sinner and we're not going to sit
[1:58:07] with this scornful we are going to stand
[1:58:10] true on the word and we're going to
[1:58:13] believe the very word of God that showed
[1:58:15] us job's life and showed I could put it
[1:58:17] to you this way hopefully this doesn't
[1:58:19] come across shocking you know what
[1:58:20] happened to job
[1:58:25] he saw the opening of the seventh seal
[1:58:28] that's exactly
[1:58:30] right Christ himself
[1:58:35] that's what he saw
[1:58:37] all of this led him to an absolute
[1:58:41] personal relationship with God it was no
[1:58:45] longer
[1:58:46] religion it was relationship
[1:58:50] Hallelujah
[1:58:52] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:56] one last comment
[1:58:58] do you know that the opening the true
[1:58:59] opening of the word
[1:59:01] reveals to us exactly Who We Are
[1:59:04] amen
[1:59:07] amen
[1:59:10] reading the Bible now I'm going to throw
[1:59:12] you guys one you guys ready to catch a
[1:59:13] curveball
[1:59:15] reading the Bible never ever calls me to
[1:59:17] want to go to church
[1:59:22] not really trying to trick you
[1:59:24] but just reading the Bible never caused
[1:59:26] me to go to church
[1:59:27] but when the spirit of the word
[1:59:30] Came Upon me
[1:59:32] something told me I need to be in the
[1:59:34] house of God not only is the word say so
[1:59:37] but I want to be it's my desire
[1:59:42] you know what uh maybe a little
[1:59:44] transparent
[1:59:45] but Wednesday night I did not feel good
[1:59:48] sister Jerry did not feel good
[1:59:51] and I had to admit this but I might have
[1:59:54] just
[1:59:55] put my jammies on and sit down in a
[1:59:57] chair
[1:59:58] but when I actually got back to the
[2:00:00] house sister Jerry's like yeah I don't
[2:00:02] feel good and I'm like yeah I don't
[2:00:04] either
[2:00:06] but I asked you this is Jerry I'm going
[2:00:08] to church anyhow

[2:00:24] of God Amen I didn't feel like it I'm
[2:00:28] sorry to admit that
[2:00:30] I didn't feel like it
[2:00:33] but as soon as Jerry said I want to go
[2:00:34] to church anyhow something inside of me
[2:00:36] said we should be in church
[2:00:39] we should be in church I need to go to
[2:00:41] church do you know by the time the
[2:00:42] service is over I felt just fine amen

[2:02:31] thing my brother and sister to see how
[2:02:34] God can come down and we can go for
[2:02:36] years and years and years
[2:02:37] and then one day God just unlocks
