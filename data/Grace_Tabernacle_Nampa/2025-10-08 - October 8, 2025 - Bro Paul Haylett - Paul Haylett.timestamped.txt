[0:00] washed by the water of the word.
[0:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's go to
[0:09] number 651, please. KFC.
[0:13] [Music]
[0:15] I know not why God's wonderous grace to
[0:22] me he hath made known.
[0:28] For why unworthy
[0:32] Christ in love redeemed
[0:37] before his own.
[0:42] But I know who I have believed it
[0:48] and am persuaded
[0:51] that he is aable
[0:55] to keep that which I've committed
[1:01] unto him
[1:04] against that day.
[1:08] Oh, I know not how this saving
[1:14] faith to me he did in part.
[1:21] Or how
[1:23] believing
[1:25] in his word brought peace within my
[1:32] heart.
[1:34] But I know whom I have believed
[1:41] and am persuaded
[1:44] that he is aable
[1:48] to keep that which I've committed
[1:54] unto him
[1:57] against that day.
[2:01] I know not how the spirit moves,
[2:08] convincing
[2:10] men of sin,
[2:14] revealing
[2:17] Jesus
[2:18] through the word, creating
[2:23] faith in him.
[2:27] But I know whom I have believed
[2:33] and am persuaded
[2:37] that he is aable
[2:40] to keep that which I've committed
[2:47] unto him against that day.
[2:54] Oh, I know not what of good or ill may
[3:01] be reserved for me.
[3:07] Of weery
[3:09] ways or golden days
[3:14] before
[3:16] his face I see. Let's sing verse five.
[3:20] Oh, I know not when my Lord may come
[3:27] at night or noon day fair,
[3:33] nor if I I'll walk the will with him or
[3:41] meet him in the air.
[3:46] But I know whom I have believed
[3:53] and am persuaded
[3:56] that he is aable
[4:00] to keep that which I've committed
[4:06] unto him against that day.
[4:14] Amen. number 627 please.
[4:23] I stand amazed in the presence
[4:29] of Jesus the Nazary
[4:34] and wonder how he could love me. A
[4:40] sinner condemned unclean.
[4:46] How marvelous, how wonderful, and my
[4:53] song shall ever be.
[4:57] How marvelous,
[5:00] how wonderful is my Savior's love for
[5:06] me.
[5:09] For me it was in the garden.
[5:14] He prayed not my will but thine.
[5:20] He had no tears for his own griefs but
[5:26] sweat drops of blood for my.
[5:31] Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my
[5:38] song shall ever be.
[5:43] How marvelous, how wonderful is my
[5:49] Savior's love for me.
[5:54] In pity, angels beheld
[5:59] him and came from the world of light
[6:05] to comfort him in the sorrows.
[6:11] He bore for my soul that night.
[6:17] How marvelous, how wonderful, and my
[6:24] song shall ever be.
[6:28] How marvelous, how wonderful is my
[6:35] Savior's love for me.
[6:39] He took my sins and my sorrows.
[6:45] He made them his very own.
[6:50] He bore the burden to Calvary
[6:56] and suffered and died alone.
[7:02] How marvelous, how wonderful, and my
[7:09] song shall ever be.
[7:13] How marvelous, how wonderful is my
[7:20] Savior's love for me.
[7:25] When with the ransomed in gloryy,
[7:30] his face I at last shall see.
[7:36] will be my joy through the ages
[7:42] to sing of his love for me.
[7:48] How marvelous, how wonderful and my song
[7:56] shall ever be.
[7:59] How marvelous, how wonderful is my
[8:06] Savior's love for me.
[8:12] Amen. As we stand together, we'll
[8:14] prepare to go to prayer with the song KF
[8:17] F number 710.
[8:24] The blood
[8:27] that Jesus
[8:30] shed
[8:32] for me

[8:41] [Music]
[8:45] The blood that gives me strength
[8:49] from day
[8:52] to day.
[8:54] It will never
[8:58] lose
[8:59] its power.
[9:04] For it reaches
[9:07] to the highest
[9:10] mountain
[9:14] and it flows
[9:17] to the lowest
[9:20] valley.
[9:24] Oh, the blood that gives me strength
[9:30] from day
[9:33] to day.
[9:35] It will never
[9:38] lose
[9:40] its power.
[9:45] It soothes
[9:48] my doubts
[9:50] and calms
[9:52] my fear. ears
[9:58] and it dries all
[10:03] my tears.
[10:06] The blood that gives me strength
[10:10] from day
[10:13] to day.
[10:16] It will never
[10:19] lose
[10:21] its power.
[10:25] For it reaches
[10:28] to the highest
[10:32] mountains
[10:36] and it flows
[10:39] to the lowest
[10:42] valley.
[10:47] The blood that gives me strength
[10:52] from day
[10:55] to day.
[10:57] It will never
[11:00] lose
[11:02] its power. For it reaches
[11:06] For it reaches
[11:10] to the highest
[11:13] mountain
[11:17] and it flows
[11:20] to the lowest
[11:23] valley.
[11:28] The blood that gives me strength

[12:55] good to be in the house of God.
[12:58] And Lord, this house has been appointed
[13:01] for the house of God to meet. And we're
[13:04] thankful that you're here because
[13:07] your life is here. Your elect is here.
[13:10] Your seed is here, Lord. And Lord, we're
[13:15] so thankful that the life that flowed
[13:17] through that blood, the very love of God
[13:20] abides in our hearts. What a great
[13:24] possession we hold. An eternal
[13:26] possession. We are your possession,
[13:28] Lord. We look forward to receiving from
[13:31] you tonight. We expect you to minister
[13:33] through our brother. And Lord, we expect
[13:36] to receive the word and expect to

[13:42] raised to a higher plane. Lord, we bring
[13:44] these requests before you. Lord, our
[13:46] sister Luba, we give you thanks for

[14:59] Greetings once again to you all.
[15:02] Greetings to our visitors. God bless
[15:04] you.
[15:05] Um,
[15:07] let's see what we have.
[15:13] We'll just sing one more song as we
[15:14] invite brother Paul to come. Number 471.
[15:18] [Music]
[15:25] shackled
[15:27] by a heavy
[15:31] burden
[15:36] and need the load of guilt
[15:40] and shame.
[15:46] Nothing.
[15:48] The hand of Jesus
[15:52] touched me.
[15:56] And now I am no longer
[16:01] the same.
[16:05] For he touched me.
[16:10] Oh,
[16:12] he touched me.
[16:17] And oh,
[16:19] the joy that floods my soul.
[16:28] Something
[16:30] happened
[16:33] and now
[16:35] I know
[16:38] he touched me
[16:42] and made
[16:44] me whole.
[16:50] Since I met this blessed
[16:56] savior,
[17:01] since he cleansed and made
[17:05] me whole,
[17:11] I shall never cease
[17:15] to praise him.
[17:21] I'll shout it while eternity
[17:26] rose.
[17:31] He touched me.
[17:34] Oh,
[17:36] he touched me.
[17:42] And oh
[17:44] the joy that floods my soul.
[17:53] Something
[17:55] happened.
[17:57] And now
[17:59] I know
[18:03] he touched me
[18:07] and made
[18:09] me whole. Oh, let's sing that one more
[18:11] time.
[18:13] For he touched me.
[18:18] Oh,
[18:20] he touched me.
[18:25] And oh,
[18:28] the joy that floods my soul.
[18:36] Something
[18:39] happened
[18:41] and now
[18:43] I know
[18:47] he touched me.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; God touched us again.
[18:54] [Music]
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad tonight we can say the
[18:59] Lord has touched us. Amen. in a time in
[19:02] our life that he just come and we're
[19:04] living in a day and age that we see so
[19:07] much pain and so much you might say em
[19:10] emotional injury spiritual injury from
[19:14] the spirits of the day but we get to
[19:16] stand here tonight and I want to speak
[19:19] to you on the thought of amazing grace
[19:22] uh washed by the water of the word and u
[19:25] brother Alex was just sharing with me
[19:27] because you see when I scroll to the end
[19:30] of My thought tonight, the very song he
[19:33] started with is also right there. And I
[19:36] just thought that was wonderful that God
[19:38] is good. I know our visitors have been
[19:40] greeted, but God bless you and trust you
[19:43] would enjoy yourself here tonight. Amen.
[19:46] And uh we just want to remember I I
[19:50] don't know if y'all remember brother
[19:52] Fabian. They've come before with the
[19:54] saints from Salt Lake City. And uh
[19:56] brother Fabian's in Ecuador sent me some
[19:59] some uh communication, some pictures
[20:01] today and they're there doing a youth
[20:04] deal and some pictures and just a a
[20:06] lovely lovely time. All these young
[20:09] people just worshiping the Lord and you
[20:12] know sometimes we think oh you know how
[20:14] many believers or how many children will
[20:16] be there in Ecuador and places like that
[20:19] but from the looks of that there's a
[20:22] lot. Amen. And so we just want to
[20:24] remember for their rest of their week um
[20:27] that God would just come down, you know,
[20:30] uh Satan would just love to take a hold
[20:32] of our children and put his mark in
[20:35] their life early on. But you know, as we
[20:38] would see, just as the uh blood over the
[20:40] door in Egypt, you know, sealed the
[20:43] household, God is sealing his young
[20:45] people, sealing them their lives. Amen.
[20:48] They don't have to go out there. They
[20:50] don't have to be marked by the world.
[20:52] God just keep his hand upon them and and
[20:55] so we just ask that the Lord would just
[20:57] move mightily in the work that they are
[21:00] doing there. Amen. Let's just stand as
[21:03] we would just go into our thought for a
[21:05] little bit this evening. And uh while I
[21:08] don't have much for notes, I I don't
[21:10] want to say we'll only be a few short
[21:12] minutes because that always backfires.
[21:15] Amen. That always comes back to haunt
[21:17] me. But uh uh who can say go you have
[21:20] experienced God's amazing grace in your
[21:22] life. Amen. And uh I say thank you for
[21:25] that Lord that uh we don't have to be
[21:28] some super people or whatever. We just
[21:30] have to be God's people. Amen. And he
[21:33] makes us super. Hebrews the 4th chapter
[21:37] verses 1-16. We'll read a portion of
[21:40] that and then allow you to be seated.
[21:43] Amen. Hebrews 4:1. Let us therefore
[21:47] fear, lest a promise being left us of
[21:50] entering into his rest, any of you
[21:53] should seem to come short of it. For
[21:55] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[21:58] as unto them. But the word preached did
[22:00] not profit them, not being mixed with
[22:03] faith in them that heard it. Now, I want
[22:06] to just not be too redundant tonight,
[22:08] but I'm telling you, it's amazing grace
[22:11] that the word that you have heard has
[22:14] profited you. that that was God's gift
[22:16] to you. It's not something we did or
[22:19] could do, but God has just poured that
[22:22] into us. And and uh no, we're not happy
[22:25] that it doesn't profit them. But I tell
[22:27] you, I am happy that it profits us.
[22:29] Amen. For we which have believed do
[22:33] enter into rest, as he said, as I have
[22:35] sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter
[22:37] into my rest, although the works were
[22:40] finished from the foundation of the
[22:42] world. For he spake in a certain place
[22:44] of the seventh day on this wise. And God
[22:47] did rest the seventh day from all his
[22:50] works. And in this place again if they
[22:53] shall enter into my rest. Amen. Let's
[22:58] just be go to the Lord here. Heavenly
[23:01] Father, we just ask you father just to
[23:03] speak to our hearts tonight and just
[23:04] help me to be concise Lord and just
[23:07] convey these things Lord that's on my
[23:09] heart. Lord just bless each and
[23:11] everyone. There are many who are not
[23:13] here tonight. We ask you, Father, to be
[23:15] with them, Lord. Whatever their
[23:17] circumstances might be, sickness, work,
[23:20] etc., Father, just be with them, Lord.
[23:22] But bless those that are here tonight,
[23:25] Lord, just to receive a special portion
[23:27] from the ministry of the word, Father,
[23:30] that you would come down and touch our
[23:31] hearts. We ask in the name of Jesus
[23:33] Christ. Amen. You may be seated.
[23:38] Now, I like verse six, and this is why I
[23:40] I really like the break here. Seeing
[23:42] therefore it remainth that some must
[23:45] enter. So, as we'll look and see how the
[23:47] word of God is that this promise is
[23:50] given out and and while there would be
[23:52] many, you know, they quote John 3:16,
[23:55] but my brother and sister, there has to
[23:57] be something there for it to have an
[24:00] effect upon them. And so, it is
[24:02] therefore it remainth that some must
[24:04] enter. The word says there will be a
[24:07] select group of people that will receive
[24:10] or enter into the word. So it remainth
[24:13] that some must. Amen. That word must is
[24:16] like a command. Amen. And uh they to
[24:19] whom it was first preached entered not
[24:21] in because of unbelief. again he limitth
[24:24] a certain day saying in David today
[24:27] after so long a time as it is said today
[24:30] if you will hear if ye will hear his
[24:33] voice and harden not your hearts for if
[24:36] Jesus had given them rest then would he
[24:39] not afterwards have spoken of another
[24:41] day there remainth therefore a rest to
[24:44] the people of God I say Lord let us
[24:47] enter into that rest amen for he that is
[24:51] entered into his rest he als also has
[24:53] ceased from his own works. Now, I think
[24:57] what's really important about this, my
[24:58] brother and sister, is that we as humans
[25:01] constantly uh maybe without even meaning
[25:05] to tend to labor in our own works of
[25:09] what we try to accomplish, what we try
[25:11] to do. And and he's telling us here that
[25:14] uh once we've entered into that rest,
[25:16] we've ceased from our own works as God
[25:19] did from his. and let us labor therefore
[25:21] to enter into that rest, lest any man
[25:24] fall after the same example of unbelief.
[25:28] So I just find that is such a beautiful
[25:31] beautiful uh thought as this is. So
[25:34] let's continue on here the last few
[25:36] verses. For the word of God is quick and
[25:39] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[25:42] sword, piercing even to dividing a
[25:44] sunder of soul and spirit, of joints and
[25:47] marorrow, and is the discerner of the
[25:49] thoughts and the intents of the heart.
[25:52] Neither is there any creature that is
[25:54] not manifest in his sight, but all
[25:57] things are naked and opened under eyes
[25:59] of him with whom we have to do. Seeing
[26:02] then that we have a great high priest
[26:04] that is passed into the heavens, Jesus
[26:07] the son of God, let us hold fast our
[26:10] profession. For we have not a high
[26:12] priest which cannot be touched with a
[26:14] feeling of our infirmities, but was in
[26:16] all points tempted like as we are, yet
[26:20] without sin. Let us therefore come
[26:23] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[26:26] may obtain mercy and find grace to help
[26:30] in time of need. Blessings on the word
[26:33] of God. As we read that, I I just love
[26:36] those those words in Hebrew 4 that uh it
[26:40] really lays out a very clear picture.
[26:43] Now, to the believer, sometimes I I I've
[26:46] read just here again recently another
[26:48] little thing where this person thought
[26:51] that Christians were uh kind of arrogant
[26:54] to believe that they were a special
[26:56] people. But I don't know how that you
[26:58] could read your Bible and and uh in your
[27:01] heart be able to say amen to every word
[27:04] in the Bible and not consider yourself a
[27:08] special person. there there there's just
[27:10] no way that that by God dealing with
[27:13] you, dealing with your heart, changing
[27:16] us, amen, conforming us into his image,
[27:19] that you don't wake up one day and
[27:21] realize that that the word of God has
[27:24] formed me and is forming me,
[27:26] transitioning me into a new creature in
[27:29] Christ Jesus. We can't remain the old
[27:31] man. And I'm glad that we don't because
[27:33] the old man was not all that likable.
[27:36] Amen. You know, it uh is just something
[27:38] that that uh when you get in a certain
[27:41] atmosphere uh you know, say if you're
[27:44] you work in the office, uh the people in
[27:46] the office become your friends. If
[27:48] you're into sports, the people in the
[27:50] sports become your friends. Uh and as it
[27:52] is, but outside of that element, there's
[27:55] no connection. But the thing that I find
[27:57] so beautiful is when we enter into the
[27:59] rest in the presence of our Lord Jesus
[28:01] Christ, we can have this unity, this
[28:04] fellowship across a very broad spectrum.
[28:07] You don't have to uh you know be engaged
[28:10] in all the same activities because we
[28:12] are engaged in Jesus Christ. Amen. That
[28:15] is our connection. And so the what we do
[28:19] as we enter into the word, we find that
[28:22] it slowly changes us. Now, the last
[28:24] thing that Satan wants is for you and I
[28:27] to find rest, to find peace. We live in
[28:30] a day and age that there's all kinds of
[28:32] of anxieties and fears and and these
[28:36] things uh affect people's lives to such
[28:38] that they, you know, brother Brandham
[28:40] said it many years ago. They need a pill
[28:42] to get up in the morning. They need a
[28:44] pill to go to bed at night. They need
[28:46] something to calm their anxieties and
[28:49] fears. But my brother and sister, we're
[28:51] here by the grace of God tonight. Amen.
[28:53] We have a father and he hears our cry.
[28:58] He hears our prayer and he is the
[29:00] greatest thing. Now, does that take away
[29:02] your insomnia? No, it doesn't. I I don't
[29:06] mean to focus this on me, but just the
[29:08] last little while, I've been just
[29:09] dealing with a lot of case insomnia. And
[29:12] you know, I've just been implying the
[29:14] age old uh antidote that God has. and
[29:18] and you know you just roll over, you
[29:20] just start praying and you wake up
[29:22] later. Amen. Cuz the devil would rather
[29:25] let you sleep than you pray. So we say,
[29:29] "I can't sleep." Well, amen. Maybe God
[29:31] is uh giving you an uncction to pray.
[29:34] Amen. So if Satan can keep us in a
[29:38] constant state of unrest and we'll just
[29:40] look I'm not real big on looking into
[29:42] all the news and what is happening uh uh
[29:45] on the computer. But if you look in the
[29:48] world around us it is a in a state of
[29:51] unrest. People are afraid of everything
[29:54] there. They're talking about there's war
[29:56] and there's a rumor of a war. And so if
[29:59] you don't mind me putting this directly
[30:00] into the scripture, we have this
[30:03] conflict in in Europe there with Russia
[30:06] and Ukraine. And not just Russia and
[30:08] Ukraine, but it's kind of spreading out
[30:10] a little bit. And then all of a sudden
[30:13] now we have something happening with
[30:15] South America and we have a little thing
[30:17] here and we have a little thing there
[30:19] and we're seeing the scripture coming to
[30:21] pass and and Satan wants to keep us in a
[30:25] state of unrest. But we want to look at
[30:28] the countertop of that that God wants to
[30:31] keep you in a place where you are
[30:34] yearning where you are seeking his face.
[30:37] He does not want us as Christians, as
[30:40] believers, to become complacent in our
[30:43] position. Amen. Where we just sit down
[30:45] and say, "Well, I'm saved. You know, uh,
[30:47] when God comes, he's going to take me
[30:49] home. I can just relax now." No. God
[30:52] wants you to be diligent. It says, Amen,
[30:55] that we should, Amen, work out our
[30:57] salvation with fear and trembling. Amen.
[31:00] That's not a holiday. That's actually
[31:03] pursuing our position in Jesus Christ.
[31:06] Amen. Now, if Satan can keep us in a
[31:09] constant state of unrest, think about
[31:11] how many steps ahead he is, that he
[31:14] would come, if we're still reacting to
[31:16] yesterday, then he is already moving
[31:19] ahead. And he's got a lot of things to
[31:22] put on your plate. And this is why we as
[31:25] sons and daughters of God have to come
[31:28] and get in the word. We have to study.
[31:30] We have to pray. We have to be prepared
[31:33] for this because then we are covered.
[31:36] And when Satan would come, does that
[31:38] take it away? You know, kind of the
[31:40] analogy. We have full expectation in
[31:43] this world. We get up in the morning. We
[31:45] do breakfast. We go out to get in the
[31:47] car to go to work. We put the key in the
[31:48] ignition. We turn the key. We have full
[31:51] expectation. The car is going to start
[31:53] and we're going to drive away. And what
[31:56] happens to us? A high state of anxiety.
[31:58] The minute the car goes click, click
[32:00] click. Amen. So in that realize if Satan
[32:04] is doing such in our spiritual life,
[32:07] Amen. that when we need the Lord to come
[32:09] on the scene, there's a little accident,
[32:11] there's a little something comes and our
[32:14] spiritual key only brings a click click
[32:16] click because we do not have the right
[32:20] approach. Amen. Now is that right
[32:22] approach saying God's not prepared for
[32:23] us? No, my brother and sister. It is
[32:26] showing that we have not energized
[32:28] ourself by the word to be prepared for
[32:31] whatever situations come in our life.
[32:34] And so Satan's always looking ahead
[32:37] trying to keep that. Now I want to use
[32:39] this simple analogy tonight. Amen. He
[32:42] wants to keep you in, as the phrase
[32:45] says, a constant state of stumble. And
[32:49] that is every day you are stubbing your
[32:52] toe. There's something that keeps that.
[32:54] Now, you know as well as I do, it's
[32:56] easier to keep your balance in the
[32:58] beginning than it is to recover from the
[33:01] stumble. And we've all done that, right?
[33:04] You catch your toe on something and then
[33:06] you have to make all these uncontrolled
[33:09] steps. Now, don't think about those just
[33:11] in a physical realm. Think about it as
[33:13] in your own spiritual life, your family,
[33:16] decisions around you. If Satan can get
[33:19] you to stumble, then you will find
[33:21] yourself stumbling and making
[33:23] uncontrolled or un uh uh not u well
[33:27] uncontrolled will be fine. Amen. Steps
[33:30] that that are not necessarily the steps
[33:32] that you meant to take or you know that
[33:34] is best for you. And so if uh it's
[33:38] easier to keep our balance in the
[33:39] beginning than it is to regain it. And
[33:42] having said that, my brother and sister,
[33:44] as we look at Israel coming out of
[33:46] Egypt, it would have been much easier
[33:48] for them if they had come to the Red Sea
[33:51] and never stopped walking.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; They would have just walked right down
[33:55] into the Red Sea because God said that
[33:58] he would not allow anything to hinder
[34:01] them from fulfilling the promise that he
[34:04] had given them. If they had believed
[34:06] that with all of their heart, they might
[34:08] have walked out in the Red Sea and the
[34:10] water might have been all the way up to
[34:12] their nose. But God would have honored
[34:15] his word, but it was there. We looked
[34:18] too much to the right, too much to the
[34:19] left, too much to our emotion, too much
[34:21] to our circumstance. And before we ever
[34:24] even start, right, look at Israel. They
[34:27] never even walked out in the Red Sea.
[34:30] and they'd already decided that was a
[34:33] obstacle they could not overcome. Amen.
[34:36] Now, I want to ask you this evening
[34:38] politely, of course, have you ever had
[34:40] that circumstance. You never even
[34:42] stopped. You never even prayed because
[34:45] you just saw an impossible circumstance
[34:47] in front of you. But that's not what God
[34:50] called us to do. He called us to believe
[34:52] his word. And when we see an obstacle
[34:55] before us, he wants us to put the word
[34:57] before us. Amen. The word is not to
[35:00] follow us. Amen. The ark was in the
[35:03] front of the people as they come out of
[35:05] Egypt. And that's where God wants us to
[35:08] put the ark is in front of us that we
[35:11] follow the word. Amen. Because the word
[35:13] was inside the ark, right? And so he
[35:16] wants us to just follow the word, not
[35:18] try and decide what's going to go wrong.
[35:21] Amen. But to decide God's in control and
[35:24] he put his word out first and I'm just a
[35:27] follower. Now, people would say, "Oh,
[35:29] oh, you Christians are just a bunch of
[35:30] followers." Yes, I don't want to be the
[35:32] leader.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know what I can do in my own
[35:36] life. I can mess it up royally, left to
[35:38] my own device. But God says, you just
[35:41] follow my word and everything will work
[35:44] out just fine. Because as the scripture
[35:46] said that before the foundation of the
[35:49] world, these things are already dealt
[35:51] with.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; We don't need a new solution. We don't
[35:54] need a new answer. We need to follow the
[35:57] word of God. And I would say today that
[36:00] when we get in that that place, those
[36:03] positions, that we realize just how
[36:05] smoothly God can come. Did that take the
[36:07] problems away? No. My brothers and
[36:10] sisters, we're in uh Brother David's in
[36:12] it also. A prayer connection there. you
[36:14] know, all over the country, not just
[36:17] here in United States, but uh Mexico,
[36:20] Central America, South America, Europe,
[36:23] whatever, there's people cancers and
[36:25] sicknesses and accidents and all kinds
[36:28] of things. So, in Ecclesiastes, it says
[36:30] that these things happen to the rich and
[36:32] to the poor. So, don't say, "I'm a
[36:34] Christian, so I've got an exemption
[36:36] card." But we have an answer. Amen. We
[36:39] don't need an exemption card. We have an
[36:41] answer to every circumstance and that is
[36:44] follow the word.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just follow the word and God's
[36:47] already got it taken care of. Now, as
[36:50] we'll look at this, if Satan can keep
[36:52] you and I in a constant state of
[36:55] stumble,
[36:56] then you're never going to stand solidly
[36:58] in the word.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; You're always going to have turmoil,
[37:02] unrest, right? He promised that we could
[37:05] enter into the rest. But if we don't
[37:07] enter into the rest, then we can't claim
[37:10] that it didn't work because it's us that
[37:12] didn't enter.
[37:16] So if Satan can keep us in a constant
[37:18] state of stumble,
[37:20] then we'll never find rest. There'll
[37:23] always be that thing that we think, "God
[37:25] didn't hear my prayer."
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Now, my brother and sister, let me just
[37:28] put this out real quick. If Satan plants
[37:31] it in your mind that God did not hear
[37:33] your prayer, maybe God's selective,
[37:39] maybe
[37:40] only a certain kind of prayer on a
[37:43] certain day under a certain
[37:45] circumstance.
[37:47] Is that what the word of God says?
[37:49] &gt;&gt; That's not what the word says. The word
[37:51] said he hears the cries of his people.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; He hears our prayer.
[37:58] But the word also says that sometimes
[38:00] our prayers are not answered because we
[38:02] ask them selfishly.
[38:04] And uh so Lord, I would like you to just
[38:06] help me to be a better off financially.
[38:10] I need a bigger house, a better car,
[38:11] nicer clothes. I need, you know, bigger
[38:13] vacation. I need No, no, my brother and
[38:15] sister, that's not the way to approach
[38:17] God.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; We approach it, Lord, you promised
[38:22] &gt;&gt; you'd take care of the sparrow
[38:25] &gt;&gt; that you would take care of me. Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; And the sparrow's needs are met
[38:30] &gt;&gt; and my needs are met.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; It's not worldly wealth
[38:35] &gt;&gt; that we're taking out of here.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; But yet, as humanity, we pursue
[38:41] wealth. We pursue a better life just
[38:44] because I guess you'd say we're human.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; But that's not what we're taking out of
[38:49] here. We're taking our character. We're
[38:51] taking the Holy Ghost anointing us is
[38:53] what we're getting out of here. Now I
[38:55] want to just bring this uh u to to a
[39:00] point here in spiritual amnesia. Uh
[39:03] we'll look at this. Uh he says how about
[39:06] he said if you abide in me and my word
[39:09] in you you can ask what you will and it
[39:12] will be done for you. And I would say
[39:14] right here saints we need to just
[39:16] believe that wholeheartedly. We don't
[39:18] need to have a question mark of whether
[39:20] God's going to honor this. God honors
[39:22] his word. Amen. Are you identified there
[39:25] to believe that this is the truth? Mark
[39:27] 11 when he said, "If you say to this
[39:29] mountain, be moved and don't doubt in
[39:31] your heart, but believe that what you
[39:33] have said, it will come to pass." You
[39:35] can have what you've said. Can you be
[39:38] identified there to believe that is the
[39:41] truth? See, that's very hard for people
[39:43] to look at that in our educated minds
[39:46] today that you would come to a state and
[39:48] say, "Well, that mountain be moved. I
[39:50] mean, it's just impossible." But my
[39:52] brother and sister, God works. Amen. He
[39:55] never never steps away from his own
[39:57] word. And it would be, if I could put it
[39:59] just in a simple analogy, it might be
[40:02] just one rock on the backside of your
[40:04] mountain starts to move. But if you
[40:06] don't doubt, God said he would move the
[40:09] mountain. Now, if you've ever been in a
[40:11] state of high anxiety, high fear,
[40:14] whatever these things are, and when you
[40:17] start to call out on the name of Jesus
[40:19] Christ, Amen. God comes on the scene. I
[40:22] testify this of the truth. Amen. Man, as
[40:25] I've shared, you know, from my youth
[40:27] there, being a backslid state and a
[40:29] pickup there on the edge of the cliff,
[40:31] hanging there. Amen. And crying out to
[40:34] the Lord and having one little rock stop
[40:36] your vehicle from falling in the canyon.
[40:39] My brother and sister, you can't tell me
[40:41] that it won't be just one little rock on
[40:43] the back side of the mountain that
[40:45] works. Amen. Don't look for the whole
[40:48] mountain to shake. Maybe the mountain's
[40:50] in your attitude. Maybe the mountain is
[40:52] in your approach to God. Maybe the
[40:54] mountain is in your fear or your
[40:56] anxiety. And you believe that God's
[40:59] going to deliver you from that. Then you
[41:01] hold on to that. And you'll wake up one
[41:03] day and God has removed it. And
[41:06] sometimes it's not in a huge dramatic
[41:08] fashion. Sometimes God doesn't shake the
[41:10] building, but he moves your mountain.
[41:13] Amen. And we believe that. That's I
[41:15] believe a tenant that we can't believe
[41:17] just a portion of the word. We have to
[41:19] say amen to every word of God.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; And when we say amen to every word of
[41:24] God, amen, does it change God's word or
[41:28] does it change us?
[41:29] &gt;&gt; I say it's us. God's word's
[41:32] unchangeable, unmovable, unshakable.
[41:35] You don't doubt in your heart, but
[41:37] believe it will come to pass. You can
[41:38] have what you said. Can you be
[41:40] identified there to believe that this is
[41:42] the truth? If it hasn't, then you're
[41:45] getting spiritual amnesia, right? We're
[41:47] forgetting what God has said.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, how often we do that. We forget what
[41:51] God's already said. Amen. And you
[41:55] forget. You lose your Christian balance.
[41:58] That's
[41:58] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I think it's good to study the word
[42:04] of God. I do it all the time and look up
[42:06] words to see what what does that word
[42:08] mean? I want to understand it better.
[42:11] But my brother and sister, I I'm not
[42:13] doing that to be educated. I'm doing
[42:15] that just desiring to have
[42:17] understanding. But we'll find in the age
[42:20] that we live in, there's often times,
[42:22] and I don't mean this to be a big dig,
[42:24] but uh often times when there's
[42:27] different ministry around the world, uh
[42:29] you know, they list that they have
[42:31] they're a PhD in theology and these kind
[42:34] of things. My brother and sister, that's
[42:36] not what God said he would do. He said
[42:38] he would reveal it to the babes.
[42:41] I I'd rather be a babe than a PhD. Amen.
[42:45] God promised he would reveal it. So, you
[42:48] lose your Christian balance. You can't
[42:50] tell where you belong. You say, "I'm
[42:51] Methodist. I'm Baptist. That's what I
[42:54] know about it. I'm Pentecostal. I'm
[42:56] this, that, or the other." Watch out.
[42:58] That may mean that the disease sign is
[43:00] showing on you that you've got some
[43:03] spiritual amnesia.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we look at this and and we have
[43:07] to find that balance of of how it is
[43:10] that we identify ourselves. Sometimes
[43:12] it's a convenience thing. But yet if a
[43:15] person will take and hold to what their
[43:19] church believes over what the word of
[43:21] God says then what's happening is is we
[43:24] are actually choosing church over God.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to do that. Amen.
[43:28] Let's move on. He says, "Well, now you
[43:31] say, brother Brandham, I believe this
[43:32] and I don't hardly." Now wait just a
[43:34] minute. If God promised to do these
[43:36] things and said that they would be in
[43:38] the last days and your creed will keep
[43:41] you from it, that's a good sign. I see
[43:43] the disease sign on you. It's spiritual
[43:46] amnesia. You have forgotten to identify
[43:49] yourself with the word.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we don't want to take an
[43:54] identity that's outside of what the
[43:57] original word of Christian
[44:00] like. Amen. not churchlikemen,
[44:04] &gt;&gt; but Christlike.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; And so what we don't want to do is get
[44:08] spiritual amnesia that our our creed or
[44:12] our or things is greater than than the
[44:15] word of God. Amen. So I say it's amazing
[44:19] grace that um we we can stand in this
[44:23] hour and God can take us back to the
[44:25] word and uh we realize the word is
[44:28] completely sufficient
[44:31] &gt;&gt; for what we need today.
[44:33] Now it's been prophesied not just in
[44:35] this day but in in times gone by it will
[44:39] be pro it's been prophesied that every
[44:41] organization that does not put Christ
[44:43] first will fail. So there are men that
[44:46] have have spoke these words many in some
[44:49] cases hundreds of years ago that if it's
[44:52] not identified directly with Christ, it
[44:54] will fail. I think their prophecies are
[44:56] coming to pass now. And thy seed shall
[44:59] possess the gate of the enemy. Uh I did
[45:02] not I did not list that one, brother
[45:03] Alex, but um you see they fail to hear
[45:09] that still small voice of the word.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:14] That's what keeps us balanced.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost that comes to you
[45:20] and keeps you balanced. Amen. Not a
[45:24] church holding you rigidly to a creed,
[45:27] but the Holy Ghost dealing with you and
[45:30] keeping you lined up with the word. That
[45:34] still small voice. It's not a voice to
[45:37] the whole world out here, my brother and
[45:39] sister. It's a voice to you. And that
[45:41] voice to you is what keeps you balanced.
[45:45] Amen. And so we want to just uh get to a
[45:48] place in our life, amen, that the still
[45:51] small voice is present in our lives.
[45:54] It's it's not uh that we ignore it or uh
[45:57] someone tells you it's no longer
[45:59] relevant, but that still small voice is
[46:02] you praying and God speaking. You
[46:04] talking to God, God speaking back. Amen.
[46:07] Always like that analogy. If you don't
[46:09] mind me repeating this. Amen. When
[46:11] Esther come before her husband, the
[46:13] king. Amen. And they told Esther, "Now,
[46:16] if you go in there and go before him
[46:17] without him holding the scepter, you may
[46:20] never see him again. If he does not
[46:22] receive you, you will be banished." But
[46:25] Esther had another thing that they
[46:27] didn't have. And that was she knew that
[46:30] her husband, the king,
[46:33] &gt;&gt; but she didn't just, oh, king, he's king
[46:35] to me. He was husband to her.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And we are here,
[46:40] Revelation 19, and the lamb's wife. So,
[46:43] we've got a husband. Amen. And it's not
[46:46] that he looks down on us as a poor
[46:48] subject, but he looks down on us. My
[46:51] wife loves me, and she loves me enough
[46:54] to bring her problems to me, and I love
[46:57] her enough to be the solution to her
[47:00] problem. And Esther come there. She had
[47:02] that revelation. It's a shame that all
[47:05] these years later, not every Christian
[47:07] has that kind of revelation to know that
[47:10] her husband cares enough, loves her so
[47:12] much that by amazing grace, he's not
[47:15] going to say, "You've got to do this,
[47:17] you got to do that." Now, that's not to
[47:19] say that God does not have an appointed
[47:21] way for us to approach him. None of
[47:24] this, you know, just really loose and
[47:26] sloppy worship. Amen. God wants us to
[47:28] worship him in spirit and in truth. But
[47:31] still he looks down and he sees you and
[47:34] I and says that's my bride. That's my
[47:37] wife. That voice I know that voice.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say thank you Lord that he
[47:44] knows our voice and he hears our voice
[47:46] and he answers. Amen. Now look see God
[47:51] didn't send messengers all through the
[47:53] scripture for it to be explained away.
[47:55] He did he didn't send a messenger down
[47:57] to the ages to just have somebody
[48:00] explain why this is not relevant. He
[48:02] didn't send a messenger to this day for
[48:04] it to be explained away. You say, "But
[48:07] my circumstance says or my emotions says
[48:10] or my lack of understanding says uh that
[48:14] this isn't possible, this isn't
[48:16] relevant." Well, my brother and sister,
[48:18] if God didn't send a messenger to this
[48:20] age, then the word of God's not been
[48:22] fulfilled. And God's not going to leave
[48:24] one word of his word unfulfilled. He's
[48:28] not going to forget it. It's not going
[48:30] to be laid to the side. He didn't come
[48:32] later and say, "This is not relevant.
[48:34] Things have changed." God knows what is
[48:37] happening. Amen. And he spoke the word
[48:41] into the age. And the hidden mana was
[48:44] laid in the scripture. It was laid out
[48:47] for sons and daughters of God in the
[48:49] right season to have the word open to
[48:52] them to realize this is what God wants
[48:55] me to do. Now, my brother and sister, as
[48:58] one man uh brother that builds houses
[49:01] said one time many years ago, he said,
[49:03] you know, God is not here going, "Oh, I
[49:06] forgot to build the walls. I built the
[49:08] roof on the foundation." No, God doesn't
[49:11] do that, my brother and sister. He puts
[49:13] everything in place. And when it's all
[49:15] done, every shingle will be in the
[49:18] correct position. Everything within this
[49:22] house of God, amen, this assembly, Amen,
[49:25] will be in its correct position. And so
[49:29] it's there. Look at the spiritual food
[49:31] in due season that God has given us.
[49:33] Amen. As we read our Bibles, why didn't
[49:36] we see some of these things from
[49:38] scripture 15, 20, 30 years ago? Because
[49:41] God in due season knew the season that
[49:44] we'd be living in. Knew the economics of
[49:46] the day. He knew the politics of the
[49:48] day. He knew the religious spirit of the
[49:51] day. And he opens his word to us in the
[49:54] right season that we can come and when
[49:57] we need answers, there's answers. When
[49:59] we need fed, it's fed. When we need
[50:01] encourage, there's encouragement. When
[50:03] we need healing, there's healing. Amen.
[50:06] Everything that we need. And when we
[50:07] need revelation, there's revelation.
[50:10] Amen. And so it's there to uh the life
[50:13] is in the seed, right? You don't plant a
[50:16] dead or cracked or damaged seed and then
[50:19] expect it to be repaired when it's
[50:21] already in the ground. God planted good
[50:24] seed and that seed is going to bring
[50:26] forth of its kind. And that should
[50:28] encourage us because what Christ has
[50:30] already done in you and I, amen, is
[50:33] already as the scripture says, it's done
[50:35] before the foundation of the world. We
[50:37] don't have to sit here and say, "I hope
[50:38] to be worthy to be a son or daughter of
[50:40] God." He already planted a seed that was
[50:44] worthy before the foundation of the
[50:46] world. That's what the word tells us.
[50:47] And when he planted that seed, he knew
[50:49] that it would bring forth exactly what
[50:51] he planted.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he puts the seed in you and I
[50:55] to be sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[50:57] And that we could come, that the washing
[50:59] of the water of the word would come. And
[51:02] it then germinates that seed and that
[51:04] soil that we're planted in, Amen. And as
[51:06] we see the parable of the sewer, God did
[51:08] not plant you and I on the thistle on
[51:11] the side of the road. He didn't plant us
[51:13] in the gravel out on the borrow pit of
[51:15] the road. He planted you and I in the
[51:18] good soil of his word. And that word is
[51:20] bringing forth and nourishing sons and
[51:22] daughters of God that are going to bring
[51:25] forth a bride of Christ. That is exactly
[51:27] what God says that's what I planted
[51:29] before the foundation of the world.
[51:31] Amen. Let's get over the fear that we're
[51:34] not going to meet up. We're not going to
[51:36] make it. Amen. You can't make it on your
[51:38] own anyhow. It's God's word, God's
[51:41] grace, God's mercy in your life is what
[51:44] brings you to fruition to live this word
[51:46] in this hour. Amen. And God's already
[51:49] bringing that to pass. Amen. In our
[51:51] lives. And we would see how that God
[51:54] would come and he would work upon our
[51:56] life and we would be there. And we would
[51:59] see that in just the right moment.
[52:03] Now, being a farmer, these things, you
[52:05] know, you focus on, you realize there's
[52:08] spots in the state of Indiana.
[52:11] There's actually a little circle down
[52:13] through that part of the world down
[52:14] there that in in 40 years has not
[52:17] suffered a drought.
[52:21] Over here, it's dry as a bone. Crops are
[52:24] burning up. And just a few miles further
[52:28] to this side, it's rained so much the
[52:30] crops have drowned, but there's this
[52:33] little spot right here. We might
[52:36] reference it to go. There's a little
[52:38] spot right here. Rains when it needs to.
[52:42] Amen. The crops are healthy. They grow.
[52:44] They flourish. Now, my brother and
[52:46] sister, God didn't say, "I'm going to
[52:48] put you over here in a drought." And he
[52:50] didn't say, "I'm going to put you over
[52:51] here and drown you." But he said, "I'm
[52:53] going to put you in the good soil of the
[52:56] word." Amen. And that good soil's got
[52:58] everything you and I need to grow into a
[53:01] full, mature, healthy Christian to stand
[53:04] in the day that we're living. So God is
[53:07] the one who planted you. A church. Amen.
[53:09] We've all been led to the Lord. Somebody
[53:11] was part of that experience, right? But
[53:14] they didn't lead you to the Lord.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; No man's come to God. That's what the
[53:19] word says, right? Amen. God's come to
[53:21] man. So we look and there's people in
[53:23] our life that we say, you know, maybe he
[53:25] introduced me or led me to the Lord.
[53:27] Just let that be a figure of speech
[53:28] because it was actually God wooing you.
[53:30] And God then put upon a a man or or
[53:33] somebody to come and be part of the
[53:36] process to put you in the right place.
[53:38] But in this good soil of the word, no
[53:41] man ever placed you in the good soil of
[53:43] the word. It was God who said, "This is
[53:46] where I'm planting you in my word, in
[53:49] this word that you could come and be
[53:51] nourished by the word
[53:53] &gt;&gt; to be what I called you to be."
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "If you're not in our
[54:00] church,
[54:02] you're not with our group, you don't
[54:04] agree with us, I'm sorry. You're trying
[54:06] to plant people when God says he's the
[54:08] one who's planted the seed."
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it won't be God saying, "I'm
[54:13] going to let man decide where to plant
[54:15] you."
[54:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; It's God who plants us.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we look at this.
[54:23] See, the life is in the seed.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Plain and simple.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; We've been given access to all of the
[54:30] message,
[54:32] right? We've got access to all of it.
[54:36] Everyone has access to it.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. But where does the real opening
[54:40] &gt;&gt; of the word come from?
[54:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Man cannot give an opening of the word.
[54:45] Man cannot give you. Man can educate
[54:47] you. Man cannot give you revelation.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; And so when God comes and starts to give
[54:52] revelation, people will question you
[54:54] because you start to see things and they
[54:56] want to know where did you get that?
[54:58] Well, I didn't get it out of a book.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't get it from a seminar. I didn't
[55:02] get it from what podcast. No,
[55:06] &gt;&gt; God gave it to me.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God gives it to you, if
[55:11] God gives you the revelation,
[55:12] &gt;&gt; then it's yours.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; That's it. It's yours. That's a good way
[55:15] to put it, Brother David. It's yours. No
[55:17] man's going to come and say, "I'm going
[55:19] to take that revelation back from you."
[55:21] When God gives that to you, Amen. You
[55:24] talk about amazing grace, saints. You
[55:26] talk about amazing grace cuz we've went
[55:28] to church. We've spent time. We've
[55:30] rubbed elbows with people and we see
[55:32] them go in different directions that is
[55:35] not pulling them closer to God.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; And yet they say, "I believe like you
[55:40] do."
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's it.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; But we are not We cannot boast, right?
[55:45] &gt;&gt; No. No way we can boast of oursel.
[55:47] There's nothing that we can boast of
[55:49] oursel. But we can boast on our Lord
[55:51] Jesus Christ cuz his amazing grace
[55:53] opened our eyes and opened our ears that
[55:56] we could hear and we could see. And that
[55:59] is a great work of God that we should
[56:01] thank the Lord for tonight and say thank
[56:03] you Lord that my eyes are open and that
[56:06] my ears can hear and that my spirit is
[56:09] reacts to you when you speak to me. Now
[56:12] my brothers and sister if I could put
[56:13] this in analogy of a marriage that if a
[56:16] husband would speak words of endearment
[56:18] to a wife and she just ignored him that
[56:22] marriage is not going to flourish.
[56:25] And we as the bride of Jesus Christ,
[56:27] when he speaks to us in the love
[56:30] language of his word and we ignore him,
[56:33] that relationship is not going to
[56:35] flourish. God's looking for a bride that
[56:38] reacts and acts upon his word. And when
[56:40] that is there in the spiritual context,
[56:42] when you read the word and you say,
[56:44] "Amen, Lord, thank you for that. Thank
[56:47] you for that word, Lord. That means so
[56:50] much to me. come in just the right time
[56:52] and the right circumstance that I know
[56:54] you know my circumstance and you've
[56:56] discerned my heart. Amen. That's God
[56:59] speaking to us. Can a man do that?
[57:03] You can have circumstances even right
[57:05] here in the church. We just had some of
[57:07] it here just recently
[57:09] where things preached from the pulpit
[57:11] touch right into people's lives. Even
[57:13] sometimes discerning right to the very
[57:15] words of a conversation.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can this man behind this say,
[57:20] "Look what I did."
[57:22] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost
[57:26] &gt;&gt; using the word and the man to convey the
[57:30] message.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Now, that works two ways, my brother and
[57:33] sister. If it's bad news to you, like
[57:36] God correcting you, you don't shoot the
[57:38] messenger.
[57:40] And if it's good news to you, God
[57:43] healing, delivering, encouraging,
[57:45] whatever, you don't go lift that man up.
[57:48] Cuz all you do when you lift that man up
[57:50] is cause God to have to come along and
[57:52] knock him off the pedestal because God's
[57:54] not going to share his glory
[57:56] &gt;&gt; with anyone.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look how God's amazing grace is.
[58:00] He just brings a balance in our life
[58:02] that even sometimes in our own everyday
[58:05] testimony, we say the right words that
[58:08] encourages someone and strengthens them
[58:10] and they can say, "Oh, that's what I
[58:12] needed to hear." Is it that man? No. It
[58:14] was God that put the words in the man.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or the woman or the sister.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the opening of the word. Amen.
[58:22] There's an opening, but it's got to be
[58:24] in its right season.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] When we look at the light of the
[58:33] scripture in the day that we live in,
[58:35] I'd have to say amazing grace has rained
[58:38] down upon us. Amen. That we can stay you
[58:43] might say out of this radical approach,
[58:47] the church going into almost a rock and
[58:49] roll world. Uh dressing any way you
[58:52] want, just come to church. Come as you
[58:54] are. Leave as you are. My brother and
[58:56] sister, we have expectation. When we
[58:57] come in the house of God, I want to
[58:59] leave changed.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want God to deal with my heart.
[59:02] I want to walk out of church and if
[59:04] there's something that's just not right,
[59:06] that God would come and put a correction
[59:08] to that. And and Amen. We don't want to
[59:10] just go on saying, "Oh, I go to church.
[59:12] I go to church. I want to walk into the
[59:14] presence of almighty God." Now, think
[59:16] for a moment. The priests, amen, when
[59:20] they came and went into the holiest of
[59:21] holies, they didn't just waltz in there
[59:24] any old way. They spent time. Amen.
[59:28] People say, "Well, that's under the
[59:29] law." But Jesus said, "I didn't come to
[59:31] do away with the law. I come to fulfill
[59:33] the law." So, the Old Testament is still
[59:35] the building block of our faith. Amen.
[59:38] It's still there. But look at those
[59:39] priests. They didn't just walt in there
[59:41] and say, "Hey, look, Lord, I made it.
[59:44] I'm here." No, sir. They come and in the
[59:48] mirror of the word put everything in
[59:52] order.
[59:53] Cuz I'll tell you what, as a minister, I
[59:55] don't want to be drugged out by a rope
[59:58] tied around my foot.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't want my life to come to
[1:00:03] knot because I wouldn't prepare myself.
[1:00:06] Lord, help us.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every one of us.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Come in the presence of the Lord. We
[1:00:11] need to come correctly.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; But look at the light of the world we
[1:00:16] live in.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Everything the scripture said, we're
[1:00:20] seeing it come to pass.
[1:00:23] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:00:25] God. Lifting up their own idols, lifting
[1:00:29] up their own priorities, doing
[1:00:32] everything saying that is evil. This is
[1:00:34] good. All of this is coming to pass. And
[1:00:38] there are so many voices. I don't want
[1:00:40] to be critical tonight and start naming
[1:00:41] it off, but my brothers and sisters,
[1:00:43] there there is mainstream voices in the
[1:00:46] land that are basically saying, you know
[1:00:49] what? God loves you so much, he wants to
[1:00:51] make you rich. I can't find that in this
[1:00:54] scripture.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; I do find where he said he would provide
[1:00:57] for me.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; And I do believe that a man that won't
[1:01:01] work shouldn't even hardly even take a
[1:01:03] bite of food. He He's not worthy. He
[1:01:05] needs to work. That's what we were put
[1:01:06] here for. But you see so many uh voices.
[1:01:10] But the thing is I think is so special
[1:01:13] about this bride of Jesus Christ. She
[1:01:16] knows the voice of her beloved.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody's going to fool. It says it
[1:01:21] would deceive the very elect if it were
[1:01:24] possible. But when this bride knows the
[1:01:26] voice of her bridegroom.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to deceive her.
[1:01:31] She knows what voice is speaking to her.
[1:01:34] And when he calls her to a higher life,
[1:01:36] she knows that's him. Amen. And when
[1:01:39] another voice says, "You don't have to.
[1:01:41] You don't need to," she's not going to
[1:01:43] follow that voice because it's not the
[1:01:45] voice of her beloved.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:51] And we know according to Revelations,
[1:01:53] the bride has something testify, right?
[1:01:56] Amen.
[1:01:58] The bride's got a voice.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's not afraid. Oh, no.
[1:02:04] We're not talking about just going out
[1:02:05] and blasting the world. You're all going
[1:02:06] to hell.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; No. No. This
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; voice is going to be a voice that's
[1:02:12] backed up with a life.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, it's empty words. I
[1:02:17] could tell you as many times as you
[1:02:19] would listen to me. I'm going to give
[1:02:20] you a million dollars. I'm going to give
[1:02:22] you a million dollars. I'm going to give
[1:02:23] you a million dollars. What it would
[1:02:24] come down to is if I gave you a million
[1:02:26] dollars. Amen. And they say, well,
[1:02:29] you've got the Holy Ghost, but nothing
[1:02:31] changes in their life.
[1:02:34] Is God welching
[1:02:36] or they're speaking without authority?
[1:02:39] I know that's kind of blunt. Forgive me.
[1:02:41] But you see, God's not going to. He
[1:02:44] promised us the Holy Ghost, but we don't
[1:02:47] live any old way. We are not going to be
[1:02:48] unconverted and filthy. What he's going
[1:02:51] to do, brother Alex and I was just
[1:02:53] chatting for just a moment. Amen. Every
[1:02:55] one of us has had a time in our
[1:02:56] Christian experience where we come to
[1:02:58] the time that I don't know the right
[1:03:00] words to use. I'm just going to use the
[1:03:02] words that we kind of exaggerated. We
[1:03:05] kind of fudged. We kind of left
[1:03:07] something out. You know how easy it is
[1:03:09] when you're telling something, you know,
[1:03:11] how did this get broke? Well, I know
[1:03:13] that some of the guys were right around
[1:03:15] here and one of them must have
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; and that one was you.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; But you don't say, "I broke it."
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Right? And God would come and a real
[1:03:28] believer, God says, "That's not good
[1:03:30] enough."
[1:03:32] Another man, sorry to sound judgmental,
[1:03:36] another man, his conscience says, "Hey,
[1:03:39] if the boss doesn't know I broke it, I'm
[1:03:42] not telling him." But a real Christian,
[1:03:45] a voice starts to speak to him and says,
[1:03:48] "You didn't really tell him the truth."
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the Holy Ghost. Now, that's
[1:03:53] a simple analogy, but when that starts,
[1:03:56] you can't dig into the deep things of
[1:03:58] God without settling the simple things
[1:04:01] of God in our life. Amen. I want more
[1:04:04] revelation. I want this. I want that. My
[1:04:06] brother and sister, start with
[1:04:08] simplicity. Just start cleaning out the
[1:04:10] house. Just start cleaning out the
[1:04:12] closets. Start getting rid of the trash.
[1:04:15] Start dealing with the things of your
[1:04:16] life. And you think, "Oh my, they
[1:04:18] they'll look down on me." I'll tell you
[1:04:20] what from experience, I can tell you.
[1:04:22] You tell them the truth of where you
[1:04:24] stand and they'll look up to you.
[1:04:27] They'll say, "This is an exceptional
[1:04:29] individual because I don't know that I
[1:04:31] could do that. I don't know I could take
[1:04:33] that position." And they're not going to
[1:04:35] look down on you because you standing on
[1:04:37] the word of God and honoring God, God
[1:04:39] will honor you.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean they'll like it, but
[1:04:44] they can't help it.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you look at this. Amen. Now,
[1:04:50] let's look what the word says here for
[1:04:52] just a moment. One, we know the bride,
[1:04:55] the spirit, and the bride say, "Come."
[1:04:56] So, the bride's got a voice. This word
[1:04:59] is alive. It's not a dead letter. Amen.
[1:05:03] It's not dead letter. We don't we don't
[1:05:04] pass it out as a dead letter that you
[1:05:07] possess this library or something of
[1:05:09] these brochures in your home and
[1:05:11] everything will be fine. No, it's got to
[1:05:13] the life's got to come off the page.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's God's amazing grace to
[1:05:18] you and I that this word comes alive to
[1:05:21] us that we're not just saying I read in
[1:05:23] the scripture one time, but it's there.
[1:05:25] God said, I'm going to write it on the
[1:05:27] fleshly table of your heart. And that
[1:05:29] doesn't mean we chunk our Bible out, but
[1:05:31] what God's saying is, I'm going to make
[1:05:32] this so personal that I get to come
[1:05:35] right down into your life, into your
[1:05:38] heart, and I'm going to write my word on
[1:05:40] your heart. This is God's amazing grace,
[1:05:43] my brother and sister. This is not
[1:05:45] something we're forced to obey, but this
[1:05:47] is when you say, "Lord, I volunteer. I
[1:05:50] want the word to correct me. I want the
[1:05:52] word to move me. I want to experience
[1:05:55] the moving of the Holy Spirit."
[1:05:58] And it changes us.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; So, the word being alive,
[1:06:04] Amen. You're bloodbought, right?
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now realize
[1:06:11] Calvary was just an earthly example of
[1:06:13] what God did before the foundation of
[1:06:14] the world.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; We were already chosen and placed in
[1:06:18] Jesus Christ. That's what the word says.
[1:06:21] But that blood, there are some today
[1:06:24] saying the blood is no longer a valid
[1:06:27] thing. And it just stuns me. I'm like,
[1:06:30] where do you get that? It's not coming
[1:06:32] out of the Bible. No, sir. It's coming
[1:06:33] out of some man's thoughts that he
[1:06:36] doesn't really want to have to deal with
[1:06:38] the blood because he wants to live like
[1:06:40] he wants to live and still claim
[1:06:42] Christianity.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister, you ever get
[1:06:45] under that blood, get washed by that
[1:06:48] blood? The word promised we would come
[1:06:50] out whiter than snow.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; So if we're saying we're under the
[1:06:53] blood, been washed by the blood, and
[1:06:54] we're coming out black and blue and
[1:06:56] green and grungy, my brother and sister,
[1:06:58] we weren't really under the blood. Amen.
[1:07:00] But the blood will wash us. Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Does the word say that we're
[1:07:04] called of God?
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Clearly says so. Does the word say
[1:07:09] that he would endure us with power?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say absolutely. Amen. So, does
[1:07:15] the word also declare in so many fashion
[1:07:18] you might say that uh the bride is not
[1:07:20] going to sit on the sideline and just
[1:07:23] watch the world pass her by? No, sir.
[1:07:26] This bride's got something to stand up
[1:07:28] and testify. The Apostle Paul was a
[1:07:30] perfect example of that. I trimmed some
[1:07:32] of this out of my my thought tonight, so
[1:07:35] you'll have to forgive me. I don't mean
[1:07:36] to be vague, but it's there. My brother
[1:07:38] and sister, the Apostle Paul says that I
[1:07:41] was called to this.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't say, "I'm going to be a
[1:07:45] spectator to this." He said, "I was
[1:07:47] called to this."
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; I was called. Some say, "Oh, boastful
[1:07:52] Paul." He says, "I Paul, an apostle of
[1:07:56] Jesus Christ." He was identifying, I
[1:07:59] have a position. Amen. We might not be
[1:08:02] apostles tonight, but we can lift a hand
[1:08:04] and say, I and put your name in there.
[1:08:07] Called to be the bride of Christ. Amen.
[1:08:10] To put myself in there. Oh, where are we
[1:08:13] going to find this bride?
[1:08:15] She's going to be in the word getting
[1:08:17] washed. That's right.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I know it's a terrible analogy,
[1:08:21] Paul and his terrible analogies.
[1:08:24] Um, sometimes I feel so sorry for our
[1:08:26] poor little doggy
[1:08:29] and I eat breakfast and there's maybe
[1:08:31] scraps on the plate
[1:08:34] and my wife is just like, "Don't you do
[1:08:37] it."
[1:08:40] But I have to start slipping the scraps
[1:08:43] to my dear little doggy.
[1:08:47] Amen.
[1:08:48] Do you want to eat after that plate when
[1:08:50] he's done?
[1:08:55] I don't think so. I joked with Sister
[1:08:58] Jerry today. I said, "That plate looks
[1:09:00] pretty clean."
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Hold it up in the light. It's all shiny.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Do you want to eat off of it?
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I don't.
[1:09:17] And I shouldn't do that. It's a bad
[1:09:18] habit. I'm sorry. Hopefully that wasn't
[1:09:20] over the top for you.
[1:09:22] But you see, I use that over-the-top
[1:09:25] example
[1:09:26] because we can clean ourself and be
[1:09:29] pretty happy with what we look like.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; But we want to be washed by the water of
[1:09:36] the word.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; We want the Holy Ghost to come down and
[1:09:40] cleanse us. Not to our satisfaction,
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; but to his satisfaction. And when we are
[1:09:46] washed by the water of the word to his
[1:09:48] satisfaction, my brother and sister, we
[1:09:50] don't sit back and say, "Oh, praise God.
[1:09:52] I'm righteous. I'm holy. I'm" No. What
[1:09:55] it is, though, we can stand with a
[1:09:57] confidence that God has come and proven
[1:09:59] that the word is changing us and
[1:10:02] transforming us and bringing us into the
[1:10:05] image that he said he would bring us
[1:10:06] into.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; But look at this now. Just like work
[1:10:13] clothes, we all have different jobs.
[1:10:16] Some get dirty. There's hardly a day
[1:10:17] goes by that I don't get very grungy.
[1:10:21] Amen.
[1:10:26] You want to wear those same clothes for
[1:10:27] a year?
[1:10:33] Flew into Chac once and our luggage
[1:10:35] didn't make it.
[1:10:36] I wore the same clothes for eight days
[1:10:41] straight
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; and when the clothes showed up, we were
[1:10:44] actually standing in a blizzard on the
[1:10:47] runway. They threw my suitcase off and I
[1:10:50] said, "Sir, can you throw it back on?"
[1:10:53] We flew into Bethl, rented a room, and I
[1:10:57] about broke the hotel cuz I stood in
[1:10:59] that shower forever and ever and ever.
[1:11:02] And it's like, "Oh, this is wonderful."
[1:11:05] Now my brother and sister, if in the
[1:11:07] natural we could be that way, how about
[1:11:09] the need to be washed by the water of
[1:11:12] the word,
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; How about the need for the Holy Spirit
[1:11:15] to come and take those things in our
[1:11:18] life that is there, little things that
[1:11:21] would bother us and plague us. And my
[1:11:23] brother and sister, remember as we spoke
[1:11:25] Sunday, Satan wants you to reach back
[1:11:28] under the blood and pull those things
[1:11:30] out. He's telling you, you did this. And
[1:11:33] my brother and sister, there's no need
[1:11:35] if we've been washed by the water of the
[1:11:36] word. That is under the blood. It is
[1:11:39] settled. It is washed. It is clean by
[1:11:41] God's standard, not by man's standard.
[1:11:44] And we need to have confidence and stand
[1:11:46] on that and say, "I place that under the
[1:11:47] blood of Jesus Christ. And I am clean. I
[1:11:50] am righteous. I am holy because he is
[1:11:53] and I am." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:12:00] Oh, let's see here. You know, I think
[1:12:03] I'll just I think I'll call it quits
[1:12:04] right here. Just very close to my
[1:12:07] thought. Amen. 2 Corinthians 12:9.
[1:12:13] And he said unto me, Amen.
[1:12:18] Now, we don't we can't look hindsight,
[1:12:22] Google. What was the Apostle Paul's
[1:12:25] thoughts? I'm sorry. They might
[1:12:28] speculate, but they don't have an
[1:12:29] answer. that the apostle Paul leaves a
[1:12:33] very clear picture
[1:12:35] that even as a man called of God,
[1:12:39] he had a rough road to hope.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; I mean, he stands there openly and
[1:12:46] honestly and says, "And when I would do
[1:12:48] good, evil is present with me." Now,
[1:12:52] whether some people say, "Oh, Paul was
[1:12:53] doing things nobody knew about." No, no,
[1:12:55] nonsense. Come on. He's a man of God.
[1:12:59] But those spirits were right there to
[1:13:00] buffet him.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Those afflictions as it were in his
[1:13:04] flesh.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. The aches, the pains where he had
[1:13:07] been beaten and mistreated and uh you
[1:13:11] know all of all of the things. We won't
[1:13:13] elaborate.
[1:13:14] And he was there. And he's telling you,
[1:13:17] you do good, evil's going to be present
[1:13:19] with you. It's going to be there. It's
[1:13:21] going to afflict you. Whether it's in
[1:13:22] the mind or in the flesh, whatever it
[1:13:26] is, it's going to be there to afflict
[1:13:27] you.
[1:13:28] And uh so as he's speaking here, he he's
[1:13:33] declaring to the Corinthians. He says,
[1:13:36] "And he said unto me," this is God
[1:13:37] speaking to Paul, "You know, my grace is
[1:13:40] sufficient for thee,
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; for my strength is made perfect in
[1:13:46] weakness, sir."
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Not God's weakness,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Paul's weakness. Now if the apostle Paul
[1:13:53] who God chose to write this great
[1:13:55] portion of the New Testament was uh God
[1:13:58] was made strong in Paul's weakness. Now
[1:14:01] we my brother and sister are of the same
[1:14:04] fabric that Paul was made from cut from.
[1:14:08] And so God is going to be made strong in
[1:14:10] our weakness. Not that we can stand up
[1:14:13] and boast about what we have done but to
[1:14:16] stand here today and say without him I
[1:14:18] can do nothing. Without him, I cannot
[1:14:21] overcome. Without him, I have no
[1:14:24] ability. Everything I have to live the
[1:14:26] word of God is in my Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:30] Amen. So that we cannot boast. Most
[1:14:33] gladly, therefore, will I rather glory
[1:14:36] in my infirmity, that the power of
[1:14:38] Christ may rest upon me. Can we say amen
[1:14:41] to that tonight? I want Amen. not to be
[1:14:44] a boastful Christian. I want to be a man
[1:14:46] that in my own weakness. Recognizing
[1:14:49] that when I would do good, evil would be
[1:14:51] present with me and not be ashamed to
[1:14:54] acknowledge we have mind battles. We
[1:14:57] have physical battles. We have struggles
[1:14:59] in this world around us. We testify to
[1:15:02] somebody and then feel like we fall
[1:15:04] short of the very witness that we
[1:15:06] witness to somebody.
[1:15:08] And we struggle with that. And yet God
[1:15:12] comes and those words that spoke. Now
[1:15:16] the scripture says that God's word will
[1:15:19] never
[1:15:21] return void.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Where's God speaking today?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Right here, you and I.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; God chose us. You say that sounds pretty
[1:15:34] boastful. That's what the word says.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly right.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; That God's got hands. He's got feet.
[1:15:39] He's got a voice.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He chose this bride to stand
[1:15:42] up and speak.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the word speaking in this
[1:15:46] hour. It's not this man right here. It's
[1:15:49] the word coming through us. And when we
[1:15:52] surrender to the Lord and say, "Lord, I
[1:15:54] can't live without you." Then he says,
[1:15:56] "Oh, I can be made strong right here."
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; And he does.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And he lets our life be a light or a
[1:16:04] testimony.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I think we'll just stop
[1:16:08] right there. Amen. Sister Vikica, would
[1:16:11] you come?
[1:16:13] And I'm just going to
[1:16:15] see since how brother Alex is already
[1:16:17] warmed up on that song. Amen. I'm just
[1:16:20] going to invite him to come and and uh
[1:16:23] sing that. I was just amazed. Of course,
[1:16:25] he got to see, you know, the glimpse of
[1:16:28] of the notes for putting them up and he
[1:16:31] come in the back room and he says, "Hey,
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; guess what my first song is." That makes
[1:16:36] me happy, my brother and sister,
[1:16:38] because, you know, we're not just off on
[1:16:39] this limb and we're not just off on that
[1:16:41] limb, but God's speaking and he's
[1:16:44] dealing. He's dealing with us as a
[1:16:46] people. Amen. Bringing each and
[1:16:48] everyone, the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:50] around the world. Amen. Being drawn
[1:16:53] right into a unity, not a man-made
[1:16:55] unity. It's not man saying, "Hey,
[1:16:57] everybody, we're sending out a
[1:16:58] newsletter. Everybody preach on this."
[1:17:00] No, it's the Holy Ghost that is laying
[1:17:03] on the hearts of sons and daughters of
[1:17:05] God and taking them to same scriptures,
[1:17:07] same thoughts, same things and dealing
[1:17:10] with hearts. Amen. I've got connections
[1:17:12] all over the world, men and touch. You
[1:17:14] know, I got brothers call me from
[1:17:15] different places in the world today. My
[1:17:18] brother and sister, what are you
[1:17:19] preaching on, brother Paul? Uh, you tell
[1:17:21] me first.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; You know, not that I think they would
[1:17:24] change their story. They're good men,
[1:17:26] right? But you tell me first. Well, I
[1:17:28] just spoke on this. Oh, so did I.
[1:17:34] Oh, is that a conspiracy?
[1:17:38] It is. If the Holy Ghost is a
[1:17:39] conspiracy, but the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:17:42] conspiracy. He said, "I promise I'll be
[1:17:44] with you
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; and I will be in you." Now, that's not a
[1:17:48] North American promise. That's not a
[1:17:51] South American promise. It's not an
[1:17:53] African promise, a European promise, an
[1:17:56] Asian promise. That's a promise to the
[1:17:58] bride of Jesus Christ, sons and
[1:18:00] daughters of God, the believers, that he
[1:18:03] says, "I'll be with you even in you.
[1:18:05] I'll speak to your hearts. I'll fill
[1:18:07] your mind with my mind, my thoughts,
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; and your desires will be my desires."
[1:18:17] Hallelujah.
[1:18:19] You know,
[1:18:21] let's change this
[1:18:23] more than one song.
[1:18:26] Amen.
[1:18:27] 505, Sister Rachel.
[1:18:30] And I'll just let you sing are you
[1:18:32] washed as a followup if you want to.
[1:18:34] Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you, our
[1:18:37] visitors. I hope tonight that Lord
[1:18:39] speaks something good to your heart and
[1:18:41] you enjoy yourself here. And Amen. God
[1:18:44] bless you all.
[1:18:46] My hope is built on nothing less than
[1:18:52] Jesus blood and righteousness.
[1:18:57] I dare not trust the sweetest frame but
[1:19:03] holy lean on Jesus name.
[1:19:08] On Christ the solid
[1:19:11] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:19:17] sinking sand.
[1:19:20] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:19:26] When darkness seems to highest face, I
[1:19:32] rest on his unchanging grace.
[1:19:37] In every high and stormy gale, my anchor
[1:19:44] holds within the hill.
[1:19:48] On Christ the solid
[1:19:52] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:19:57] sinking sand.
[1:20:00] All other ground is sinking sand. His
[1:20:07] oath, his covenant,
[1:20:10] and his blood support me in the welling
[1:20:16] flood. When all around my soul gives
[1:20:21] way, he then is all my hope and stay.
[1:20:29] On Christ the solid
[1:20:32] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:20:37] sinking sand.
[1:20:40] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:20:46] And he shall come with trumpet sound.
[1:20:52] Oh, may I then in him be found, dressed
[1:20:58] in his righteousness
[1:21:01] alone, fought blessed to stand be for
[1:21:06] the throne.
[1:21:08] On Christ the soly
[1:21:12] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:21:17] sinking sand.
[1:21:20] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:21:28] Amen.
[1:21:30] Well um shall we sing that song again?
[1:21:36] Are you washed by the water? 766.
[1:21:40] Do you know what it is not to have one
[1:21:46] guilty feeling? Not to wonder where
[1:21:49] you're going when you die.
[1:21:54] Not condemned of the past, not afraid.
[1:21:59] Tomorrow holds in store. and know the
[1:22:04] reason why.
[1:22:07] Yes, that's just how it is when you go
[1:22:12] down in the water. Cuz by faith you
[1:22:16] believed in what you heard.
[1:22:20] It's no impossible
[1:22:22] dream. You can start over clean.
[1:22:29] When you're washed by the water of the
[1:22:33] word,
[1:22:35] are you washed
[1:22:38] by the water?
[1:22:43] Washed by the water of the word.
[1:22:48] Oh, are you washed
[1:22:52] by the water?
[1:22:56] washed by the water of the word.
[1:23:01] Oh, it's like being born again with a
[1:23:06] whole new life to live, never having to
[1:23:10] look back to what you've been.
[1:23:15] Cuz according to the Lord, you've just
[1:23:19] started your existence.
[1:23:23] He's concerned there never was no sin.
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:29] When God looks your way, he no longer
[1:23:34] sees a sinner, but a saint who's been
[1:23:38] washed white as snow.
[1:23:42] Not by anything we've done, but by the
[1:23:46] blood of God's own son.
[1:23:51] Are you washed by the water of the word?
[1:23:57] Oh yes, I'm washed
[1:24:01] by the water.
[1:24:05] Washed by the water of the word.
[1:24:11] Yes, I'm washed
[1:24:14] by the water.
