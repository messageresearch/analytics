you how many know he's present Jesus Christ is present with us I'm so glad there's a people today called The Bride that can recognize that that can recognize him here present with us even in us so let

those you've ordained to life may they hear and receive your word today we pray raise us to a higher plane Lord we ask this now For Your Glory bless your word move me aside Lord I'm just clay but I give myself over to you and the gift you put in my life to the ministry of your Saints and for your people this I do for your glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name amen amen if you'll turn with me in the scriptures to 2 Chronicles I appreciate again I appreciate you praying for me this morning can imagine over a 3-month period and the Lord's been so gracious Every Morning has mercies are new I've never seen the fail to do that if you'll go before him humbly and reverently God will reveal himself to you yes faith comes by hearing the word so faith is in the word amen and so I just appreciate this opportunity we have a meeting coming up in we just keep us in prayer we have a meeting coming up at the end of this month for Easter Lord willing it up in calary with brother Barry Johnson so we just would like you to keep us in prayer for that I know that's quite a little ways off but just pray that God will lead us and help us and continue to pray for each other there's nothing greater than power in power but the power of prayer amen Prayer Changes Things amen amen amen so in in chronic several scriptures I just want to feel very free this morning to follow the Lord's leading amen but I this this come to me just I had other scriptures marked out first but I want to read this ver in 2 Chronicles chapter 5 my title this morning is coming in clouds of Glory Glory the glory we're speaking of is the shikina coming in clouds of the shakina now I may say some things it's maybe a little hard to understand for some maybe strangers or those are visiting and I by the way I want to greet those online not only you here but everyone those online that are listening in may God bless you with his word may he reveal himself to us is that what you're wanting you know faith is revelation now Revelation is the substance of things hoped for amen the evidence of things not seen this is our rest this is our strength but coming in clouds of Glory may sound strange you may you may disagree but before you disagree look in the word go back to the things our Prophet said it's all right to disagree and you may disagree but you pray and if you think I'm not right in what I'm saying here this morning then you pray for me that I may be right amen I can only preach what God lays in my heart to minister and as I said over this period of time there's been much much very much if I was to take everything that I put down as sermons we'd be here for a week or two every day maybe two or three times a day so trying to condense it no I'm not trying to condense it really I just this is just laid in my heart very deeply so second chronicles 5:13 and this is where they were Solomon had just finished the house of God we'll break into it here it came to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one I like that were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of Music see music is a voice they lifted up their voice with trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen that then the house I want to put emphasis the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God whose house you are then in seventh chapter I only keep you standing for these two scriptures here and then I'll let you be seated 2 Chronicles 7 one now when Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house yes sir and the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord because the glory shikina of the Lord The Cloud of the Lord had filled the Lord's House you may be seated the bride being his house how many believe that the bride is the body of Christ the house of God the bride is God's place of worship that's his body God has only one provided place of worship and that's in his body and that's in Jesus Christ amen remember Christ is the body and it's made up of many parts is that right amen but every part of that body is one part one Christ they're part of one head and that head is Jesus Christ and unless you Worship in God's provided place your worships in vain then how do we get into that place by one Spirit are we baptized into that one body by one spiritual baptize are we birthed into that body amen so so every member of that body are parts of members of One Glory One Cloud amen that one cloud is our head amen every part of that body is members of one person amen let's turn over with me if you will to Acts chapter 1 and before we do that I'd like to go to Revelations a minute let's just hold that in Acts one a minute but Revelations chapter 1 verse 13 I want to show you here is the coming of Christ up through his bride how much Christ come and what form does he come in today what form is he manifesting himself in in this hour and this day and if we see that then we're if we're seeing what part of the word we are and you can only to be the bride you must see what part of the word you are for the day to be the bride yes you must recognize your position the bride has a position and to some of you you may be as alarmed to believe that God has a bride that God is married to a wife and that wife is himself revealed in another form just as Adam just as Eve was part of Adam and revealed Adam in another form Eve was Adam re revealed so is the bride Christ revealed she's the mystery of Christ revealed she's the Caps cap capping Stone of the whole Revelation amen she's the Capstone part god wasn't finished with Adam but he was complete in Eve Eve was the complete revelation of Adam complete revelation of what God had in his mind amen now we could say a lot about that but we're saying a lot about it this morning as we go forth here but in Revelations chapter 1 and let's just look at him coming up through and see who is this one liken unto the son of man verse 12 and I turned to see The Voice John saying John the type of the Bride I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks we know you know the seven golden candlesticks are The Seven Ages all right and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of one like unto the son of man who' you expect the bride to be one like unto the son of man clothed with the Garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle brother brandom said that was himself son of man himself self in Bride form garment dressed as a woman amen all right then he said he said a gird about the past with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool anybody ever see his picture today it was taken it was taken by the astronomers it was taken by many many people people in 1963 right what was that cloud we look at the picture the right way and turn it to the right who is it why it's himself it's Jesus Christ returning again just like he left us in that form are you with me now he's what is now what is that what was it picture of what was it a what was it a photo of it's him the head all right now that seems strange maybe to some but if you look in the scripture I just said his head and his hairs were lightwe like white like wool and white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass his feet body as if they burned in a furnace and his his voice at the sound of many Waters what is that Ministry body Ministry amen all right now we go on here there we see him then in Acts 111 if you'll turn me me where I said there in Acts 1 and verse 11 we could we could read the verse from verse 9 well let's take it from verse 9 let's just take it from verse eight because I want another scripture coming up here but you shall receive power how many receive power after the after what after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me hallu to be a witness of him has to have a true testimony that's right amen and you're have your testimony is what of him him where him in you the same yesterday today and forever amen is that right all right he hasn't changed his Nature has he he's still it's still him it's still his character where is it what form is it in he say well Brother David are you expecting to see him again you better will but I'll meet him in the air he'll set foot back on the earth in the Millennium that man that died at Calvary amen but he is present here with us right now in the form of the Holy Spirit which is not another person it's himself that's right taking on a form or a morphe God himself putting placing himself as the actor into another actor's garment that's right amen is that right all right so he said here he said and you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost and you be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria even into the Caldwell amen and in Judea and Samaria and unto all uttermost parts of the earth who's going to witness of it where's who's the witness and the Bible said and I'm going to hit this first right here off the bat and the Bible said in St John 15:7 that you shall be Witnesses you are witnesses of me because you were with me from the beginning what was the beginning in the beginning was the word St John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the same was with God how is it with God as his thought because a word is a thought expressed and he expressed the thought of himself and you were included in that because you were with him from the beginning amen all right and so he he said and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel what did they have what did what was their Ministry watch what their Ministry was what will be their Ministry to Israel those two Messengers what will it be he was speaking to them right here but look at what it is to us the seventh seal is the mystery of his coming because it's only known to the bride amen yes and the reason it's silent because it's a mystery amen but the mystery's been opened hello you say no it's been closed no the prophet said it's open amen are you with me all right so he said and he said a cloud he said and two men in white apparel stood by them and said which you men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come shall so come in like manner as you have just seen him in in verse n go into heaven all right so he's come he's coming he's being manifest somewhere where is he and it'll take that manifestation that Revelation to let us be caught up to meet him in the air are you with me so the head is uniting with something and the may let us say this I'll say this right off the bat let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb is come amen and his bride has made herself ready ready through what the word right for what purpose the wedding supper she is now in a Divine Union with her bridegroom right and it's and it's the the and and she's growing into one stature the head amen himself because she is himself in another form all right so I wonder did we see him go or come as he said he left certainly we have all right so in Matthew 6 16 28 verse I'll let's let's okay let's just turn to Matthew and you know I'm kind of walking here lightly because I want to just know that I have God's I want that will and I believe he has his will to speak here this morning very careful in what I'm reading here and the order that is being read in before I do this John 14 very familiar scripture let's go there John 14 and hold that spot in Matthew John 14 verse one let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me verse two in my father's house are many dwell Dwelling Places that's Mansions Dwelling Places my father's kingdom are many Dwelling Places or in my father's kingdom are many mansions are you with me all right if it were so if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again amen and receive you unto myself what's happening bride what took place when the seals opened what was the third pull the opening of the word yes my word will not return to me void Isaiah 5511 my word will not return to me void but it will accomplish what is set to do right and if you be that word heavens and earth will pass away but if you be that word you can't pass away either and he will not allow the word that you are to come to not but it will accomplish you will accomplish what you've been sent to do for whose works are you sent to do his you've been ordained these Works have been ordained before the foundation of the world Amen you come in Union with Jesus Christ and good works which he hath before ordained that you should walk in them whose Works he said he said if if I be in you the works that I do shall he do also then who is it doing the works Jesus said my father worketh hitherto and I work and without him I can do nothing is that right Hallelujah he said he would reveal him himself to you yes amen and show you and lead you and guide you into all truth and so the works that you're caring out by that spirit of God is not your works it's the works of God Amen why because you have his mind all right I'm I'm I'm floating off over here and I got to come back amen but because you have his mind you are spiritual and it's only the spiritual that are able to receive and to hear what is being said in this hour because he said my sheep right hear my voice and a stranger they can't follow for they do not know the voice of strangers they can't receive a strange voice how many know that through the years you kept hearing that strange voice but when you heard the real voice of God something in you said that's what I've been looking for yes sir why because you always were a part of God you always were the thought of God you always were that thought expressed you were in him from the beginning and now you're here to manifest and witness him in this hour and the day that you are meant to be here to recognize that portion of the word which is himself in fullness returning back for the body change to called up to what a wedding supper a celebration of a marriage amen am all right so we look here and said I will return I will I will if I go I will go and prepare a place and I if I go I'll come again and receive you unto myself how how is he going to receive you to himself by the opening of the word he's going to unveil himself completely to you he's kept it secret but now he comes in his complete Revelation and unveils himself to you and makes himself known to you and you see your position as himself in Bride form not another person it's the person not another Glory it's his glory you don't have another husband your maker Isaiah 544 said your 545 said your your maker is your husband amen and he will not sh share the Isaiah 4811 said he will not share his glory with another but we're coming to a scripture that shows us the bride is not another right amen she's him amen the same Glory that he's glorified with and has in himself he said I give to her I give to you amen I've got the scripture on that St John 17 it's there amen all right so let us go and find these great truths out here so he said that he said in in in let's go back over here to Matthew 16 verse 28 verely I say unto you there be some standing here he took Peter James and John up into a mountain apart right separated apart what's he showing here there's a bride that's pulled out of the church apart that is beholding the kingdom of God coming in power amen he said verily I say to you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom amen and it's I think it's in in Matthew uh anyway another scripture in Mark Mark or Luke says you see they see the kingdom of God coming in power amen where is the kingdom of God Luke chapter in Luke 17 verse 20 and 21 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come they demanded him when is the kingdom of God coming he answered and said answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation so therefore the kingdom of God is a secret coming right amen that's right he said it would be a secret coming he said just like Romeo and Juliet yeah and you can't come until he calls you to come right How can any man come to God except he calls him first amen is that right no man can come to me except my father calls him and all that the father has given me brother brand said all that the father has revealed myself to will come amen so we have quite a report don't we yes who ha believed our report other words who's believed Our Testimony being Witnesses right of his majesty and of his power how many are have me your Witnesses of his kingdom coming in power what's the Power Authority amen it's coming in power who power not yours not David I'm a man but that word that's revealed in me is himself it's come and unveiled himself in power Hallelujah and he said I shall also Quicken your mortal body amen is that right bring it subject to the word and if it go in the dust I'll Quicken it again because my quickening power that's quickened you to life shall never leave even those bones I don't care what our mother has put in the grave those qu quickening power doesn't leave those bones right you remember you remember when a a dead man was thrown on the on the grave and where Elisha was buried and that dead man hit that the enemy was coming they threw the dead man in there and he come right back to life and out of it that's right brother because that quickening power was laying on those bones that he landed on hallelujah hallelujah there should be no question of whether he's healed you or not the very quickening power of God that that's in you has identified you in him and in him Is No Death in him is no sin in him is no sickness and you're in him you've been you've been delivered you're freed you say well I might die with sickness that does you can't die with anything like that it may take you into the grave but that's already been conquered you'll move right into a new body that body has no sickness so God has fulfilled his promise it's already a finished work you know that your healing is already a finished work prise the Lord your salvation is a finished work Hallelujah you're free praise the Lord the blood has loosed you it's washed you and loosed you and you pass from Death whose blood his blood therefore he that's come through the blood has life it's life because life's in the blood you're saved by the blood of God that's why the prophet said you're saved by Revelation because it's the revelation of that life in you he's already identified you you're already identified in him revelation of himself living in you which is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ in you has already identified you that you were in him before the foundation of the world so you know where you come from then you know where you're going if you know where you're going amen I mean then you know who you are glory to God Amen now I'd like you to turn with me over here no I yeah I'm sorry I didn't finish that scripture the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say Lo here or there for behold the kingdom of God is within you amen hallelujah you what is the kingdom of God God's word made Power in you sir amen the word of God it's a substance it's not an imagination I'm not preaching to an imaginary word here I'm not preaching to an intellectual gospel this morning I'm preaching to the unveiled word not David's words his word that I'm here to give witness to and I'm not just here standing behind a Pulpit giving witness to when I leave this Pulpit it'll be lived out of me amen you can't keep yourself you can't even defend yourself David I can't even defend myself but because I'm his sheep I have a Shepherd I have a lord I have a hunman right I shall not want amen there will be no lack There Is No Lack I have no lack everything I have need of will be ministered and met to me on time and on purpose for the season and the hour I'm here to testify of him through the little Cloud that I am Hallelujah through a little portion of that Shina that I am Amen on the inside it's got to be made flesh in this hour and it is be becoming flesh the flesh is becoming the word and the word is becoming the flesh am what does that take a spiritual union with Christ himself praise the Lord there's a bride a little group of people today knows who she is knows where she's standing Jus is matured right into the very Christ himself she's not another she is not another that's right she is himself see there's where you have the revelation of which side of the veil I'm talking to you from if I'm boasting that of David my boast is wrong but I bear behind this skin the unveiled word which is being manifested through his quickening power through this skin amen that's what he promised to do amen that's what he's doing Hallelujah all right now I want you to go to Isaiah 59 with me I notice the kingdom of God is not a public show it's not known to the public amen Isaiah 59 verse 19 so there so they so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West that's the Setting Sun and His glory from the rising of the sun it's East his glory from the rising while we're in that very moment there in Isaiah 53 you don't have to turn to this but in Isaiah 53 or 43 excuse me it says I thought it was 43 here just a moment well maybe I'll come back to that I I guess I I wrote down the wrong um just a moment here no it's 435 I was right I think it's 43 no no oh yes here it is fear not for I'm with thee I bring I will bring thy seed I will bring thy seed from the East rising and gather thee from the West amen that is right remember but in the evening time West it shall be light amen that's right Prophet stood up and said it is the rising of the Sun what again the seed coming from the East shall appear again shall come again amen all right so in the evening time it shall be light and from the East and gather thee from the West Gathering Gathering by what the coming of the Lord amen the word amen Paul said we are being gathered together by the coming of the Lord by the coming of the lord we are being gathered I will return again and receive you amen unto who that where I am there you may be also what if we didn't have the opening of those seals we couldn't be where he is amen all right so so back to Isaiah again 60 verse or 59 19 and His glory said I'll gather Fear Thy Name from the West and his glory from the rising of the his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord the word of the Lord revealed the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him and the prophet said are you one of them are you one of those standards that can't return to him void but will accomplish what is sent to do are you the word that's the standard that he raises up is the word and you the bride are the word living and in action amen you can't be anything else right that's who you are you receive his word for the season and the day you receive it today you recognize your position because you were always a part of him the word you couldn't deny the word you can't deny who yourself that eagle in the barnyard wasn't a chicken he was an eagle and he couldn't understand the cluck of the chicken but when the eagle screamed he came to recognize who he was because he was an eagle from the beginning you weren't a chicken from the beginning you weren't uh you weren't something else you were the word from the beginning you his thought you were his substance you were dwelling in him you were alive in him living in him and he expressed it when he did that he expressed himself and you are my Witnesses Hallelujah is that clear all right all right now so we find in verse 20 now or verse let's jump to verse verse one of chapter 60 and I just I'll have to bypass some of this because of the well verse 20 said the Redeemer shall come to Zion you know what Zion is in the Bible the bride and the Redeemer shall come to Zion amen and unto them that turn from transgression in Israel Jacob sayeth the Lord so how's he coming he's come again Oh Brother David now oh yeah yeah he's come again and he's coming we haven't come to the full climax of that coming because what we have received spiritually in faith will bring us to a full reality and realization are you with me it first has to be Faith always has been God's way he spoke the word by faith he created the worlds by faith then what took place when he did that that was the word of God and he created it by faith it wasn't something he just had a whim about it was substance in him and he put the substance into a word and the word became creation glory to God that's exactly what it is and so here he is today now verse 6 chapter 60 verse1 then he saying to us arise shine you're the light of the world didn't Jesus say that in Matthew 5 ye are the light is there any ye in here ye are the light of the world Amen are you not a city a city a city that cannot be set on a hill get be hid where is your Dwelling Place upon this Earth it's upon a mountain and you're that City glory to God what he is you are I'm going to come to that in just a moment all right what time is it I'm not okay okay we're okay now so we see here rise Shine for thy light is come are you ready for the next one and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee Hallelujah who the in here I am a the is risen upon thee Hallelujah for Behold The Darkness covers the earth it's trying to close you in Gross darkness of people but listen that gross darkness of denominationalism was broken you come out of that grave what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is to see Christ in Bride form the bride coming of Christ to fulfill the scriptures and God promis seeing it manifested right before us he who has eyes to see will see he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit sayith to the churches Hallelujah you think I'm by side myself maybe I am but I know exactly where I'm at amen I don't say that boastfully right I say that

Amen you're you're beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord who are you beholding him who's him you glory to God yes that's exactly what's being reflected back and when it turned to the word laying down in your heart to be quickened and be watered when that turned to that wave sheath at the rising of the sun when it turned to that wave sheath waved over you what happened it quickened you out of that dark denomination L it quickened you into a resurrection you have passed from Death to life don't you look at the Affairs and the works of the of the of the mistakes and failures of the

revelation of the whole thing think of that think of your position people and who did that you did it your intellects no Grace you heard the gospel of your salvation the good news which was the resurrection and you just couldn't stay in that thing anymore it brought you out amen praise the Lord he brought me out there is now no therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and you are not going to walk after this flesh this flesh is not your focus it is not your absolute it is not your it's not he himself revealed in you and the position that you are eternal life is your absolute Hallelujah his word is your absolute and you are that word in you you are the word you don't have to try to be something you're not be what you

to you that are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels what who made up the wig who made up his authority where was he revealing himself who made him known he's revealed himself from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking Vengeance those that know the scriptures Isaiah 61 verse two and A2 Vengeance what is our day this day this scripture is fulfilled our Prophet took us right to that second half of chap of verse two of Isaiah 61 Jesus stopped in the middle of the second verse of Isaiah 61 because the rest of it didn't apply to his first coming I mean yeah it applied to his second yes amen and the prophet said this day this second half is fulfilled in your ears that's right what's happening he's taking out a people in a secret capturing a and vengeance is being brought by his word upon those dis unbelief the world the churches the denomination he said life has left the Shu amen they're no longer Twain him and his bride they are one how could bride how you say that because his word already went out and it wouldn't return void he said they're one amen and you know what I am you are it's revealed amen and it's revealed to individuals it's not a group Affair it's not this group that group this church that church has nothing to do with it it's one church one body one Christ one person and every member of that body is that one person that's your identification all right and so he said so in verse 8 and flaming fire taking vengeance upon on them that know not God that obey not the gospel at the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall punish with Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power when he when's this going to be when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints Brother David that's later on no that's right now to get later on amen unless that's revealed to us personally then you're still looking for him to come you're still looking for him to come with a message you're still looking for him to come with the third pull you're still looking for you're still looking for something to happen evidently the prophet didn't bring the message to take you home in a Rapture see what I'm saying oh yes we believe in a return Ministry it's happening am absolutely it's happening it's right here in the bride form who'd the message go to where's the settling where's this peace put my peace I give to you where am I settling where am I United with where am I today what is the promise of my coming what would it look like who would she

of God revealed see if I'm not saying the right this bride has been United and pregnated with life she's here you're here I'm here for one purpose that's the bear his name no other reason we are here to bear that name and everything that name applies to everything the power the glory the Majesty the Dominion everything we're here in we are his wife the glory of our husband right go back to 1 Corinthians 11 see if the wife isn't the glory of the man is that right all right amen okay I won't have to have that scripture made it all right all right now and it says in the next and and and of him the glorify you in him according to the grace of our Lord according to the Grace I love that according to the grace of our what if we didn't have that Grace but his grace is sufficient rest in it bride rest in it who's he speaking to when he said my grace is sufficient he's speaking to you the elect you himself my grace is sufficient for my strength is made perfect when you submit yourself completely to me a weakling that's right my grace is made perfect through weakness Paul said then I'll glory in my weaknesses I'll glory in my mistakes my failures and everything else for my his grace is made perfect that's it why because in your faith I mean in your heart the veil has been removed when it turned when your heart turned to the Lord the veil was removed amen the veil was removed when what was turned to your heart see and in and that Spirit the spirit of Liberty where the spirit of it is you've got Liberty regardless you're not out here to make mistakes and failures you have no reason you have no desire to do that I'm talking to the bride if you have a desire get before the Lord and ask you to remove the desire then if you have a desire to go out and com commit unbelief and do those things that are contrary to what he said go ahead and get right with God that's all I can say get a new birth and you'll have no more to desire right it isn't your desire your desire is to serve him I need more of you Lord I need more of you I want more of you and you come through that word and I've got to have that word then go to feeding on the open word if you intend to be changed in a body change go feed on the open word right amen go feed on the message of the hour go feed on the word that's been open go feed on what God said you are go feed on what he identified you to be go feed on him you want to grow in him go feed on him you must be born again that's not a dance that's not a shout that is absolutely a divine revelation of himself open in you that recognizes the word that follows the word and won't disbelieve the word it can't my all right now Lord help me to get finished all right now so we're being and in verse two chapter 2 verse one Thessalonians now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ I say Amen how many say Amen with me by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ I said his coming not over with it's consummated in our meeting in the air do you not realize where did he start out a baby in a Manger is that right did he grow into the stature of Christ of God himself yes he was God himself God in him made him God God in you makes you a little God that's right that's exactly right so where does God dwell in you amen all right all right so so we we're being gathered we're we beseech you by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or troubled neither by Spirit listen how many times you go out through the day and troubled by Spirit you're troubled by spirit is that right Satan come along trying to get you discourage get your eyes off the word get your eyes on your mistakes and failures and he's not even judging you by that anymore he took your Judgment at Calvary and that's finished and you've got that Spirit of life in you a token that declares that you died with him and you Rose with him there is no such a thing as a birth child of God committing sin he can't do it God he can't do it he that is born of God does not commit sin because the seed of God which he is remains in him and it's been quickened and that quickened seed is Jesus Christ unveiled in you that's who you are that's the real gift that's the real you brother Ram said the real you is the spirit of God that's in you prise the Lord that's who you are he said do we believe what he said or don't believe what he said all right then if you believe what he said what can stand before you because what he said is in the word you see it in the word you're not just saying quotes to be quoting it you're saying what he said in the word the word's revealed to you amen then you say what he said you're not quoting what he said to Swiss people over in this assembly and bring them over here in this one and well bless God he said this and couldn't put it in the word you're not saying what he said he was a word Prophet what did he restore us to the word the faith in the word all right amen now I get on those Trails I'm sorry but I have to just say what the holy spirit says to say so we're being gathered and don't be bothered or troubled by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand at hand means look at if you have a skull field look at that little footnote B now present Lord right sir that's right that's the truth right some of his footnotes weren't necessarily truth but that's truth amen absolutely all right so now and verse seven said for the mystery of iniquity do already work only he who now he Christ who now leth will let until he Christ the bride be taken out of the way how many know I'm quoting exactly what the prophet said there Hallelujah Christ who the bride so what's Israel waiting for her Queen to get out of the way is that right it's a maturity and we're growing into that maturity see we speak another language we speak a new tongue it's not the tongue of the earth no it's a spiritual tongue that the Holy Ghost reveals to us how can we know the things of the Holy Ghost except the Holy Ghost who wrote the word abides in you and if he abides in you then you're spiritual and the prophet said the spiritual will get it and how can you have the Holy Ghost in you if you weren't the seed to begin with if he planted in you that seed put it in there by predestination and planted it and you were here for this hour to hear that word he has to see to it that you hear the word and when you hear the word he has to see to it that it's revealed to you and was revealed to you he'll see to it that you work his work for it's all him it's all him did you hear me it's all him Hallelujah that's the gospel that's the grace of God you are the seed is the reason you could be birthed not everybody is birth repentance isn't birth neither is just just repentance I'm not saying you're not a Believer but repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the gift of God is eternal life is that right the real gift is that Soul down in there that could hear the word and receive it there's the real gift there's eternal life you didn't put that there you had nothing to do with it there but when you heard the word preached in its power there's something inside of you that responded to that regardless of how you feel on the outward Lord is that truth or not truth is that right absolutely right all right now I got to go quickly through some of these things you bear with me can you bear with me about 15 more minutes did that be all right I'm sorry I just haven't preached for three months preach brother but thank God I had opportunity and Tim and I both had opportunity to be with our mother am like we've never been before and my daddy's still living our daddy excuse me Tim I don't mean to do that it's not my or it's it's his too dad is Dad that's all he got a part of dad I don't have and I have a part of dad he don't have and mother too but we're manifesting one person good brother David I like that okay now so and a man that once walked into God and the veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he's in the presence of God and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty is that right all right and the Lord is that spirit amen okay he's in the presence presence of God other words he's in the shakina of God all right eating Mana don't you love to eat Mana yes I do I love the word no wonder 12:00 9:00 or anything he's living in the presence of the king amen no wonder every day is fine for him see look where he's at he's found the secret place he's went behind the veil what a beautiful picture of the believer in the Pres presence of God all things are his then all things was given to Christ and who are you Christ what is Christ that kind of stumbles people doesn't it you think we're making us the the calvary man outward now I'm not saying that Christ is the word anointed right it's the seed of God quickened right and that quickened seed can only reveal Jesus Christ cuz he is Jesus Christ and if that seed that planted in you is birth that's the new birth in your soul it's not an outward birth of Flesh he that is born of the flesh is flesh but he that is born of the spirit is Spirit who spirit so who are you then see the real 's laying inside this will let go someday but that you has to go to a body that's been waiting for you is that right because if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting for us in the heavens that's right Eternal we have one waiting for us that's Eternal that's a theop called in the Bible theophany referred to a Greek I think it's a Greek word theophany okay but that's but then that theophany will someday go pick up the body they once lived in that that person see and then that body raises what's going to happen to it sin can't rise again it died is that right right it it it it finalized right there it'll Rise Again by the quickening power that quickened you to the word will Quicken that body to the Worden and it's got to come right back a young person then we'll eat then we'll build then we'll inhabit then we'll move out into Millennium there will'll dwell on an earth that's had a baptism amen y as the word living on that Earth just like he's living in you in this earth Hallelujah are you with me I didn't stumble anybody when I said that go back to Future home you can see what I've been studying in future home recognizing your day in its message rising of the sun these are all not just not this happy feelings and happy thoughts and just a message no they're him do you realize you're feeding on the body word of the son of man amen I'll take one leave one I'll take two in a housetop take one leave one where Lord where Lord where are they going Lord where are they Lord wheresoever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together do you understand we're feeding on the body word of the son of man that's right and we grow then by what we eat we grow into what we eat that's right amen what we're feeding on is who we are that's why we cannot I cannot get enough of this right I've got to have it right I pray that you feel the same it takes preeminence over everything else amen praise the Lord okay you keep pulling so I can quit all right now well maybe that's the other way around no I don't want to ask you to stop pulling okay now watch what a beautiful picture of the believer in the presence of God all things are his then all things was given to Christ and all things are yours then see it's his then it's me all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was which was God revealed is that right then all that Christ was God revealed has been poured into you right his body his church what is the body of Christ the Flesh and Bones of Christ is that right certainly it is how many believe the words made flesh today amen amen that's it all right then that day you'll know that day this day that day this day St John 14:20 you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you there's not three persons there there's not two persons there that's one person amen are you with me then if the father was in him and he's in the father and I'm in him and he's in me then who am I then if you abide in me and my word abides in you ask what you will see and it shall be done if you abide in me and my word in you then you know who you are are rightl there you are all right okay now look Christ in you makes him the center of Life of this Revelation it's he's the center all right we don't he don't s he don't rotate around us we rotate around him he's the Little Wheel in the middle of the wheel he controls the outer wheel the Little Wheel moves your tire moves the rim moves is that right but it's all depends on the energy given to the Little Wheel okay then then he said then see Christ life in you Christ's life is eternal life in you makes him the center of the Revelation he just repeats that again he said then Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ that's why you cannot I don't you care what you do if you have the true Spirit of Christ it's going to take you back to the word always back to the word always to the word that's right it always comes back to the word it can't leave the word the Holy Ghost will not leave his word all right then see then Christ in you Christ in you he said Christ Christ life in you and Christ in you three times Christ in you here's your third time makes way for something the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for God himself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again amen where is he growing you're growing into his stature amen amen what is it it's a new birth from the beginning you're growing right up into his stature of his headstone Amen to a full adoption all right then he said he said Christ in you makes you now this was on my mind all night I went to sleep with it I woke up with it I had the dream in it everything this right here this is what spurred me and brought me to tie this into this message that God been to Quicken to me he said right here Christ in you makes you individual you the seed you makes you the complete Revelation or unveiling of the whole thing Hallelujah am makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing amen the mystery of God would be finished the seventh Angel's message the seventh SE would finish the mystery of God you say it's the seventh seal yes what the prophet said he said that third PLL the seventh seal was the same the message of the seventh angel was the revelation of Seven Seals which only fulfilled and completed the full Revelation amen we have the fullness of the Revelation it's still it's moving in us I'm not saying there's not more to be revealed there is but as far as a message that take us home in a rapture we've got it and it's taking a bride out of here she's marching right now out of here amen she's in step with the word right out of here don't let any little Spirit come and B you and upset you just remember what we read there in 2 Thessalonians 21 2 22 he's here turn to him go back to him your strength Lays in the revealing of the word your strength lays in the spoken word because it's in you now you even in your mouth the word of what the word of faith Revelation speak it and go forward take it right back the word you don't have to answer you don't have to give an you don't have to reason you don't have to do nothing go back to your feelings or nothing else just take the word stand right there accept it and go on Amen this sister knows it Mr AEL sister I'm sorry sister I don't remember your first name Andrea yes she knows it she knows the power of that spoken word she knows we all know it I know itj listen my mother just passed on but you realized she passed on once before about seven eight years ago oh wait no about about almost 10 years ago died of a heart attack raised up and lived another 10 years here wasn't there time you see you can't change God's time it's in his time he makes all things beautiful in his time I be careful I don't want to preach a funeral service no Brother Paul's doing that so I don't have to do that anyway but anybody needs a funeral it's those that aren't born again you need a birth you need a dying to yourself and be reborn don't take any sensation as your evidence no feelings as your evidence it's got to be a genuine Revelation the genuine revelation of himself in you is your evidence because faith is the evidence right amen all right okay now Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing he said see what God's trying to do it's Christ in you that's the Revelation that the church was build upon what is it it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see see what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ and the true headship then and the true headship watch it now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ's mystery of God revealed paragraph 578 now we see the Promise being fulfilled now we see it Christ the true headship going in clouds I just put that in there parentheses clouds going in his presence going in somewhere going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at the first in John 14:12 he that believeth in me the works that I [Music] do he's the I am I do amen I do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days Vindicated by God himself through his promised word you are the promised word for the last days he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you'll catch it if you want to know I just quoted to you but 1 Corinthians 2:11-12 we won't read it that's those that are spiritual okay there is no such a thing as spiritual death which is eternal separation to a baptized saint of God though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth In Me In Me In Me When were you believing in him didn't just happen to start believing in him you were believing in him before the world began sir that's right and he that believeth you just now recognize that's all because the because because the word open to you and you saw yourself in the word all right then you're recognizing your position okay then watch he said you've got eternal life only thing he said whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die all scripture must be fulfilled you can't die you got eternal life the only thing the Redeemer has made you to recognize it and you were always that and you were always that and that's the reason you see to day the day you're living in how many sees the day they're living in raise your hand thank you see the the day that we're living in you recognize it if you are the bride and the Bride is a part of the husband the only place that you'll ever recognize it it is recognize what part of that husband the word you are or you can't recognize being the bride how many sees that amen you have to recognize your position the message of the hour the the day the time is the bride time the bride coming of Christ the resurrection out of dark denominationalism that seal of dark denominationalism is broken roll back amen what rolled it back what rolled that stone out of the way of that grave where he was buried an angel are you with me an angel a messenger all right then he said the seal had broken what a resurrection that was and now what a resurrection this is the wave sheath the rising of the sun over his predestinated seed quickened you to life the Sun is up now the revelation of himself in the bride form that's what it is it is the complete revelation of himself not another not another person not another Glory not another Cloud she is him his glory not another shikina his shikina his light you are the light of the world no he said that a City I just reiterating excuse me for repeating now now

church nominal organization denomination we see where they are we see where the nations are we see this day these promises fulfilled now he said 151 now he said but in this day there is to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham amen now you see what his message is pointing to what it was for it had to repeat back to Eden again right are you with me okay now he said now we see he said notice he said there's got to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly what it would be would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it will be a spiritual seed there's to be a spiritual bride raised up and will be the Royal seed of the royal Faith Royal seed Royal Faith same thing of Abraham's royal son she's to come up on this in on the scene she's to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise given to her and he goes into some scriptures Revelation 10 mat or uh Malachi 4 these promises given to her amen right okay now I'm going to bypass some of this you are the veil that veils him that's right we are that Veil you are written Epistles or other words you're are written word made manifest amen I'm just going to go past this real quick you are written Epistles see amen you are they don't know the Bible but they'll read your life where was this all revealed it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's what it was it's still in the word you see you can't get out of the word okay the spirit will never leave the word right it's the same God Amen I hope that gets through same God same just a morphe I must decrease John said he must increase amen that's right then all in all comes into him he's fully manifested he he manifest himself through Luther Wesley Pentecost on down on down he's fully manifested you see come down just the manifestation God unfolding it's God unfolding amen the whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in Moses or in Luther didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah Luther Wesley any cost they were only part of the word pointing to it see now notice keep your thought here it comes ases it say the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it now notice he says according he said and today when the word is manifested in human veils vessels it's absolutely the word fulfilled in that day which comes back being baptized according to 1 Corinthians 12 spiritual baptism Holy Ghost baptism she points back to him the fullness she then is him in another Veil and when he come he was the perfect so so he now so is he now in Bride form now notice how many American citizens are here raise your hands all right you're American citizens you're identified with this nation whatever this nation is you must be

him amen I was identified with him all that he was I am all that I am he was amen being dead in him we are identified with him what he is I am amen what is this what this nation is I am I'm proud to be that he said but I'll double that I and I I bear the reproach to be an American that's right but I'll double that to Jesus Christ all that he ever was I am I'm happy to be one of them being identified identified with his word which is him I'm in Christ I am his word for he is the word and what I what he is I am in the beginning was the word that's Alpha what about the end still be the same word won't he right back to the word again amen All Right Now Praise the Lord now breaking you now let us die to self to reveal him to others Oh my he said what a comfort what identification identified in that word where that shakina Glory lays now watch the word manifested or revealed in that Revelation in there where's the word revealed the Revelation in there it's in Christ where is he in you where behind the veil the inner Veil the inside of the inside want to make sure we understand that behind that inter Veil on the holiest of holies there's where the word is opened all right there's where the birth is are you with me all right then he said the word manifested or revealed in that Revelation in there then what does that put me if he's that shakina of Glory I'm part of it amen oh amen that's right the word itself revealed reveals itself the mysteries of God made to known to us this day by the same Heavenly messenger that was made known to them in them days the same Pillar of Fire notice same pillar fire Moses same pillar fire the same pillar fire that Paul met it's the same pillar fire today interpreting the Bible amen how we thank him for that what a comfort what identification I'm so glad to be identified in that identified in that word where that shakina glory and Revelation lays oh in this last days to see the same Pillar of Fire right Among Us speaking the same word not only that but interpreting it by making it manifest and proving it's the truth now I'm going to quickly just run over here to Deuteronomy 30 a minute I'm I'm not far from closing so just bear with me I'm not going to give three closes here I know better than that now maybe you learned something how about a Chris we learned something that we just don't tell people we're closing until we close I got to find Deuteronomy just keep going over I'm still nervous no I'm not really all right now let's go here to verse or Chapter 30 now I want to go back down here you could read verse three and four and through six there and it'll tell you about the Gathering and how we're gathered and etc etc verse 12 verse 11 for this commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should us say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that we should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it notice hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it see I've set before this day before thee this day life and good and death and evil amen and on and on but watch go to Romans 10:8 what is that word that's n this even in our mouth the word of faith that we preach the word of Revelation okay now we broke into that Veil into his presence and when we die to ourself to reveal him to others let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die traditions and things to reveal him to other now breaking into the veil through the veil into his presence where the word not the Creed the word in there seeing the shakina glory the shakina the power the Holy Spirit shining upon the word bringing forth the promise shows your behind the veil look at the evidence all right I broke through that into the shakina of Glory I see the word I see the word I see the pillar of fire moving I see the word made manifest I see in these last days I see it growing I see the children eating the sh bread or excuse me the shakina bread coming from what are they eating amen the revealed revealed the revealed word all right the word he said eating the shakina bread coming from the ripening of that word which believe the ripening of the word that word you are that word which believes it amen what a wonderful hour we're living in the shikina was over the word amen and under there was the bread and there was the blood sprinkled which gives it water the spirit gives life to the word fear not I'll not only be with you I'm in you amen the spirit which opened himself in you will lead you into all truth amen but God is still there to make that just the same the spirit lives by the word notice what did it do finally returns back to the original grain again when he come in the form of Martin Luther John Wesley form of Pentecost he's supposed to
