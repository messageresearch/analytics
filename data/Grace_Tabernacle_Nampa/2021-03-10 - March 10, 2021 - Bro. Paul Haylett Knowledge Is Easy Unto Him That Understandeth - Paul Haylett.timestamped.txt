[29:10] oh
[29:12] [Music]
[29:24] is
[29:32] [Music]
[29:38] oh
[29:40] reminds me of the words of the prophet
[29:42] when he said
[29:43] [Music]
[29:46] that the holy spirit was very timid
[29:50] and he would come and he would dwell in
[29:53] the right atmosphere
[29:55] where we welcomed him and i say lord we
[29:58] welcome you tonight
[30:00] we don't want to just come to say we
[30:02] went to church but
[30:04] we truly want to welcome him
[30:07] into this building into our presence
[30:11] into our lives tonight
[30:13] walk out i don't know about you but you
[30:16] know we live in a world that just the
[30:18] day-to-day
[30:19] stresses and strains some days it just
[30:22] seems like
[30:24] things can be so difficult and some days
[30:27] it can be just
[30:28] so glorious and some days might start
[30:31] off bad
[30:32] but they finish so good i just have to
[30:36] just share with you just a little
[30:38] something of why i feel so happy tonight
[30:41] i
[30:41] had one of those mediocre days looking
[30:44] at
[30:45] pieces of paper and wondering
[30:49] i think you'll all relate to this
[30:51] wondering where did all our money go
[30:54] and uh you know it just wears on you and
[30:58] brother jason bless the service tonight
[31:00] and i felt a presence as he
[31:02] blessed the service and
[31:05] after he stepped out the door i just
[31:09] lifted my hands and just asked the lord
[31:11] let me not speak tonight just words
[31:13] don't let it just be something that was
[31:15] spoken
[31:16] but lord let there be an anointing amen
[31:19] amen on your words let there be a
[31:22] presence that
[31:23] isn't just someone saying oh you spoke
[31:26] something good tonight but someone would
[31:28] go home
[31:29] and say you know what god spoke to me
[31:31] tonight
[31:33] and i'm telling you saints it was a
[31:34] presence just settled in the room
[31:38] and i just went from feeling a little
[31:42] bit
[31:43] you know not glum but just a little bit
[31:47] tired or weary and right now i feel like
[31:50] just running around the outside of the
[31:52] church and
[31:52] scream a couple laps just to make sure
[31:55] we're all awake or
[31:57] something but amen i i just
[32:00] i trust you understand what i'm saying i
[32:02] just just to feel that presence you just
[32:04] settle in around you it's like nothing
[32:07] matters what happens outside around
[32:09] those
[32:10] in this world just nothing else matters
[32:14] amen let's just go to the word tonight i
[32:17] want to speak to you again
[32:18] from the book of proverbs age old
[32:20] proverbs
[32:21] i i'm i don't know about you but i'm
[32:23] finding inspiration as i
[32:25] read the book of proverbs you know we're
[32:27] not reading every chapter
[32:29] i'm i'm just trying to go along and find
[32:32] inspiration
[32:33] in the words uh and some of this as in
[32:36] the case tonight
[32:38] we have 18 verses but it actually
[32:41] i felt to read all 18 of them but my
[32:44] real thought comes and you'll see it in
[32:46] the title
[32:47] here knowledge is easy unto him
[32:50] that understandeth and that's one of the
[32:53] most beautiful things that
[32:55] when god has come and i don't want to
[32:57] spoil my thought tonight but when god
[32:59] has come
[33:00] and anointed us not at the anointing of
[33:03] a great teacher not the anointing of
[33:05] someone
[33:06] who is great at explaining things
[33:09] but when god himself has come and it's
[33:12] there
[33:13] and he has given us revelation which is
[33:16] understanding
[33:19] it just comes we don't have to fight for
[33:22] it
[33:23] it just comes sometimes we don't
[33:24] understand but in the right season
[33:26] the word just manifests itself and
[33:29] becomes alive to us it's no longer just
[33:32] a bible
[33:33] you know the prophet of god you know he
[33:35] tells us and right at the moment i had
[33:37] it on my
[33:38] mind but the words just escaped me but
[33:40] he said you know
[33:41] when we have that revelation let me just
[33:42] paraphrase that when we have that
[33:44] revelation this bible will become a
[33:46] whole new book
[33:48] amen that's when understanding has come
[33:51] to us amen and we know then what god's
[33:54] plan is and what he had for us and
[33:57] i pray tonight this uh will inspire you
[34:00] we want to look at this uh some very
[34:02] direct you know that's one thing i love
[34:04] about
[34:05] some very very direct things very direct
[34:08] scriptures versus uh uh you know god
[34:11] doesn't
[34:13] let me just put it this way god doesn't
[34:15] beat around the bush
[34:17] god's not gonna you know patty cake us
[34:20] god's not going to sugarcoat everything
[34:23] amen brother branham says these words
[34:27] like this he said god didn't
[34:28] ask you if you felt it he didn't ask you
[34:32] if you liked it he asked you
[34:36] believe it oh lord help me
[34:39] you know we use the word believer around
[34:41] the message a lot
[34:42] but lord i want to be a real believer
[34:45] amen not just not just in word not just
[34:47] in
[34:48] that i want to be a real believer
[34:51] amen proverbs 14th chapter
[34:54] start with the first verse every wise
[34:57] woman
[34:58] buildeth her house but the foolish
[35:01] plucketh it down
[35:02] with her hands now
[35:06] we don't want to change the scripture
[35:08] saints but i think we can just change
[35:10] that every wise person
[35:12] you know it isn't just gender specific
[35:15] here
[35:17] he that walketh in his uprightness
[35:18] feareth the lord but he that is perverse
[35:20] in his ways despiseth him
[35:23] in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of
[35:25] pride but the lips of the wise shall
[35:27] preserve them
[35:29] where no oxen are the crib is clean but
[35:32] much
[35:32] increases by the strength of the ox
[35:35] a faithful witness will not lie but a
[35:38] false wiltness
[35:39] will utter lies a scorner seeketh wisdom
[35:42] and findeth it not
[35:44] but knowledge is easy unto him that
[35:47] understanding
[35:48] go from the presence of a foolish man
[35:51] when thou
[35:52] perceive us not in him the lips of
[35:54] knowledge
[35:55] the wisdom of the prudent is to
[35:58] understand his way
[36:00] but the folly of fools is deceit
[36:04] fools make a mock at sin but among the
[36:07] righteous
[36:07] there is favor the heart knoweth his own
[36:11] bitterness and a stranger
[36:15] doth not intermittent with his joy
[36:18] the house of the wicked shall be
[36:22] overthrown but the tabernacle of the
[36:25] upright
[36:26] shall flourish my right there tells you
[36:30] we're not a prosperity gospel but that
[36:32] verse right there
[36:33] tells you my brother and sister what's
[36:34] wrong with a lot of the world
[36:37] amen you see they think because they
[36:39] have increased in goods
[36:41] right right revelation
[36:44] we've increased in goods we have need of
[36:52] nothing
[36:55] there is a way which seemeth right unto
[36:57] a man but the end thereof
[36:59] are the ways of death even in laughter
[37:02] the heart is sorrowful
[37:04] and the end of that mirth is heaviness
[37:07] the backslider in heart shall be filled
[37:09] with his own ways
[37:11] and a good man shall be satisfied from
[37:14] himself the simple believeth every word
[37:18] but the prudent man
[37:20] looketh well to his going a wise man
[37:24] feareth and departeth from evil but the
[37:27] fool rages
[37:28] and is confident he that is soon angry
[37:31] dealeth foolishly and a man of wicked
[37:34] devices
[37:34] is hated the simple inherit folly but
[37:38] the prudent
[37:38] are crowned with knowledge heavenly
[37:42] father we just ask you to bless this
[37:43] time tonight
[37:45] lord as we desire just to lord
[37:48] look into your word let it deal father
[37:51] with each and every heart
[37:53] i ask you lord deal kindly with us
[37:56] lead us and guide us lord into all truth
[37:58] we ask in the precious name of jesus
[38:00] christ
[38:01] amen you may be seated
[38:05] i don't know that i will get to this
[38:08] in its entirety tonight you know sister
[38:10] jerry often
[38:11] has told me in the past when i say oh
[38:13] it's going to be a short service she's
[38:15] like uh-huh but
[38:18] i want to take verse 15 real quick the
[38:20] simple believeth every word but the
[38:21] prudent man looketh well to his going
[38:24] you see saints this is actually a
[38:26] fundamental reason
[38:27] of why brother paul constantly tells you
[38:30] go back
[38:30] to your bible go back to the message do
[38:33] not take a man's word for it
[38:35] the scripture says the simple believeth
[38:38] every word
[38:39] if you do not take what is spoken to you
[38:43] at the word level you take it at man's
[38:46] level you take it an interpreted level
[38:48] you will find yourself in trouble but if
[38:52] you
[38:52] will take and look well to the word of
[38:55] god
[38:55] go look back and to find that and
[38:58] study that and make sure that it is it's
[39:01] only your soul
[39:02] that you're laying upon the line it's
[39:04] only your soul that you are putting up
[39:06] uh in and uh you might say uh
[39:09] uh duty to this and so i just once again
[39:12] want to encourage you
[39:14] when people will say things i i have
[39:17] become
[39:17] resistant to the idea of people just
[39:20] saying well the prophet said
[39:22] and then they go on and ramble on into
[39:24] some kind of
[39:25] explanation and uh you know i'll just be
[39:28] honest with you
[39:29] i don't mind if you do that to me i
[39:32] often times when i've set in places and
[39:35] people said well the prophet said they
[39:36] don't tell you when where how
[39:38] and they ramble off into something i
[39:40] start writing things down
[39:41] and you'd be surprised at the amount of
[39:43] times you cannot find
[39:45] in context what they said the prophet
[39:48] said
[39:49] i don't say that to be negative tonight
[39:51] i'm just telling you
[39:53] it's up to you okay don't assume that
[39:56] everyone speaking to you
[39:57] is going to put things in the correct
[39:59] way
[40:00] you have a duty to you your family
[40:04] amen to make sure the truth is coming
[40:07] over the pulpit amen now let me just go
[40:10] on
[40:11] hallelujah i got you all glum looking
[40:13] now amen
[40:15] now i want to go to verse 1 here you
[40:17] know and this struck me so profoundly
[40:19] and
[40:19] i'm not looking at it just to a woman
[40:21] but i've i thought you know this is
[40:23] interesting in terms of how the
[40:25] scripture
[40:26] speaks it here every wise woman buildeth
[40:29] her house
[40:31] but the foolish plucketh it down with
[40:33] her hands and
[40:34] you know you'd look at that and we would
[40:35] ask our question
[40:37] why would we destroy our own house and
[40:40] we can take that
[40:41] one upon ourself as being a temple of
[40:44] the holy ghost
[40:45] uh you know created in the image of god
[40:47] we are his tabernacle
[40:49] and you know what we desire is not to
[40:52] pluck it down we don't want to just keep
[40:55] destroying
[40:56] the house it is but when you think about
[40:59] how it would be that someone would have
[41:01] something
[41:01] that had been built up or has the
[41:03] potential to be great
[41:05] and yet they would continue to pick away
[41:08] or destroy
[41:09] destroy that to to do things to that
[41:12] that ultimately brings the demise of
[41:14] that house causes it to
[41:16] fall down my brother and sister you have
[41:18] to just question
[41:20] and we'd realize in the age that we're
[41:22] living in there's all kinds of spirits
[41:24] and
[41:24] just a little reading that we've been
[41:26] doing and looking at what's happening in
[41:28] our nation
[41:29] and brother branham talking about how
[41:31] that we have become a nation of
[41:33] neurotics
[41:34] and i believe certainly we are
[41:35] witnessing the fulfillment of that my
[41:37] brother and sister
[41:38] it's here in the political realm i just
[41:40] mentioned to brother jay
[41:42] that the government accounting office
[41:45] has come up with the total and
[41:47] no don't hold me to the exact numbers
[41:49] but the fourteen hundred dollars that
[41:51] the government wants to send you
[41:53] will ultimately add over fifteen
[41:56] thousand dollars
[41:57] in debt to the national debt and my
[41:59] brother and sister the way the
[42:00] government calculates that
[42:02] that baby that was just born is now in
[42:05] debt
[42:06] and so when you think about that they're
[42:09] going to give you 1400 but it's going to
[42:11] cost
[42:11] 15 000 plus to pay it back so you see
[42:14] when the prophet of god
[42:16] said this nation would be broke well you
[42:19] know it's interesting because sometimes
[42:21] people start to look at that and say
[42:23] well yeah united states is really messed
[42:25] up i'll say
[42:26] amen to that but we also look at this of
[42:29] what the
[42:30] prophet have said and you put it in
[42:31] context and realize
[42:33] when america falls it will suck the
[42:36] nations of this world down with it
[42:38] there will be no one exempt there will
[42:40] be no utopia
[42:42] there will no mecca for us to run to our
[42:45] only hiding place is jesus christ
[42:48] amen so you're not going to run uh you
[42:51] know off to the jungles of brazil
[42:53] you're not going to run off to wherever
[42:55] it might be and
[42:57] hide out my brother and sister it simply
[42:58] isn't going to happen when this falls
[43:01] and when that uh spirit comes
[43:03] and starts to take dominion over the
[43:05] governments of the earth
[43:06] and it becomes a truly one world
[43:08] government uh ruled by we know who
[43:11] my brother and sister the only refuge
[43:14] will be
[43:14] will be in jesus christ but thank the
[43:17] lord the prophet of god said at that
[43:19] point in time
[43:20] amen at the full manifestation of that
[43:22] the bride will be gone
[43:24] so while we should look at this with
[43:26] concern because it is a sign of the time
[43:29] don't be getting all fretted and all
[43:31] heated up about the fact that it's all
[43:32] falling apart
[43:33] amen when this happens the scripture
[43:35] says look up your redemption draweth
[43:37] nigh
[43:38] and that tells me our redemption is
[43:39] really really close
[43:42] hallelujah because we see people i
[43:44] listened to just a little clip today
[43:47] of a congressman uh that uh you wouldn't
[43:49] even have to guess what political party
[43:51] was and
[43:52] he says that there's this 1.9 or
[43:54] whatever trillion dollar covet bill
[43:57] you realize there's hundreds of millions
[43:58] of dollars they haven't spent from the
[44:00] last bill they passed
[44:03] but we got to pass another one because
[44:05] they need to give money to their friends
[44:06] and
[44:07] they couldn't get money from the old
[44:08] deal to give to their friends so they
[44:10] had to
[44:10] create a new deal to give money to their
[44:12] friends
[44:15] but this congressman said this is going
[44:17] to be one of the best things that ever
[44:19] happened
[44:20] to the citizens of the united states
[44:24] you talk about being put under a strong
[44:26] delusion to believe a lie
[44:29] not all the delusions will have
[44:30] religious overtones not all
[44:32] the lies will be doing about deceiving
[44:35] people concerning jesus christ
[44:37] see it all ties together so we look at
[44:40] this and why would a woman see now the
[44:42] scripture types a woman as the church
[44:44] so let's just look at that for just a
[44:46] moment why would the church
[44:48] tear down something so beautifully that
[44:51] god has built
[44:53] but they're anointed to do that just as
[44:56] this would be right here with this take
[44:58] this natural spiritual however you want
[45:00] the foolish plucketh it down with her
[45:02] hands
[45:03] oh god anoint us my brother and sister
[45:06] let me just speak this real blunt i hope
[45:07] this doesn't hurt anybody's feelings
[45:09] tonight
[45:09] let me speak this real blunt let's be
[45:11] builders
[45:13] not destroyers let's lift one another up
[45:16] let's lift a husband a wife
[45:18] children the whole church let's lift one
[45:20] another up
[45:21] and be builders not plucking away with
[45:24] our hands tearing it down
[45:26] not tearing it down is an anointing
[45:28] right from the pit of hell
[45:29] we were not called to tear things down
[45:32] and this scripture right here will show
[45:34] us
[45:34] that the wise woman i want to be a wise
[45:36] woman amen i want to be of that
[45:38] anointing
[45:39] to be a builder not a destroyer
[45:43] hallelujah amen going on i want to hurry
[45:46] along tonight i wish i could just
[45:48] labor all of this but that's not her
[45:50] thought he that walketh in his
[45:52] uprightness feareth the lord so you see
[45:54] the direct
[45:55] correlation between one's position and
[45:57] how they walk
[45:58] is in relationship to how they look at
[46:02] god
[46:04] if we look at god as a dodie grandfather
[46:06] then we will live like he's a dodi
[46:08] grandfather that's just going to give us
[46:09] anything we want
[46:10] i want this i want that i want this i
[46:13] want that
[46:14] but if we look at that that our god as
[46:17] we'll take ourselves as sons and
[46:18] daughters of god
[46:20] our god is a responsible parent what do
[46:23] responsible parents do
[46:26] come on parents you know what i'm
[46:27] talking about responsible parents
[46:30] even go against their own feelings for
[46:34] what is
[46:34] good oh let me just throw this in here
[46:37] let me just slip this one under the door
[46:40] sometimes we do things with our children
[46:43] because we feel
[46:47] amen i feel so sorry for my children
[46:52] i just i know i told them to clean their
[46:54] room but
[46:56] they just have so many toys and so much
[46:58] stuff that they've strewn in their room
[47:00] i just feel sorry for them so i'm gonna
[47:02] act like i never told them to
[47:06] okay let's solve the problem throw half
[47:07] of their toys half of their clothes away
[47:09] so they don't have so much to clean up
[47:11] then you won't have to feel sorry for
[47:13] all that they have to clean up
[47:16] come on no what does a real parent do a
[47:18] real parent says if i
[47:19] let my child get away with it today they
[47:22] will want to get away with it tomorrow
[47:24] they will want to get away with it the
[47:25] next day and the next day and the next
[47:27] day
[47:27] and i as a parent will actually ruin my
[47:30] child
[47:31] saying i love them
[47:34] so what does a real parent do corrects
[47:37] his child
[47:38] even though you know isn't it funny my
[47:41] son joel
[47:42] i tell on him joel if you're listening
[47:44] amen i love you son
[47:47] but i used to tell my kids you don't
[47:49] understand i'm fixing to whip them their
[47:52] mother whipped them twice as much as i
[47:53] did so that kind of gives you an idea
[47:56] but i'm fixing it with my kid and i
[47:57] would tell joel's son this is going to
[47:59] hurt me more than it hurt you and
[48:00] my son is like 14 and he's like that's a
[48:03] lie dad but now he's 34 and he's like i
[48:07] think i understand
[48:12] but you see you have to have that and
[48:14] now god's not a dirty grandfather
[48:19] we'll tie that together in just a minute
[48:20] or else i'll get off on this it's not
[48:22] really a rabbit trail it's just
[48:23] a a right turn instead of a left or a
[48:26] left turn instead of a right
[48:28] amen so our direct view
[48:31] and how we walk is how we look at god
[48:33] see the perverse
[48:34] despises god the upright they they
[48:38] fear god but this is not a fear that
[48:40] comes from you know the mad dog trying
[48:42] to bite you this is not a fear that
[48:44] comes from
[48:44] someone bigger a bully trying to hurt
[48:46] you this is a fear that ties back into
[48:49] the hebrew as reverence
[48:51] this is respect this is love this is
[48:54] honor
[48:55] and he that honors respects and loves
[48:58] god walks
[48:59] upright we cannot say we have the holy
[49:02] ghost
[49:02] and live and be a person contrary to the
[49:06] nature of god
[49:14] now if that rubs some hide off of you i
[49:16] say i'm sorry but truth is truth
[49:19] amen we cannot walk contrary to the word
[49:22] of god
[49:24] and say i love the lord amen we've got a
[49:27] warped view
[49:28] of what it is to be obedient and love
[49:30] the lord
[49:32] now in the mouth of the foolish is a rod
[49:34] of pride but the lips of the wise shall
[49:36] preserve them
[49:37] now you look at this my brother and
[49:38] sister in a previous uh and i'm sorry i
[49:41] should have researched it so i could
[49:42] give you something more
[49:44] definitive but but a couple services ago
[49:47] on the proverbs here the scripture said
[49:50] it's pride that bringeth contention
[49:55] isn't it amazing that pride is something
[49:58] that we can hide so well now a certain
[50:00] degree of pride is what keeps us from
[50:02] being slobs
[50:06] right we could have showed up today
[50:09] to church in that shirt that had coffee
[50:12] stains
[50:13] and a little bit of your raspberry
[50:15] croissant
[50:18] but because we have a little bit of
[50:19] pride and respect for the house of god
[50:22] we
[50:22] we dress we dress correctly
[50:26] we we dress in clean clothes nice
[50:28] clothes
[50:30] but you see a rod of pride a rod is
[50:32] something that is stiff
[50:36] so a stiff nature of pride
[50:43] where is it displayed is it displayed in
[50:45] the prudent
[50:47] is it displayed in the life of the wise
[50:50] what does the scripture say that a man
[50:53] has a hard
[50:54] time taming his tongue
[50:59] kind of like a man training a horse
[51:04] now i have a love-hate relationship with
[51:05] horses they eat hay
[51:08] i love them but i used to ride them
[51:11] they've stepped on my feet broke my foot
[51:14] they've done
[51:15] things that caused me to look at horses
[51:17] with very much
[51:18] ill regard
[51:22] but think about a wild bronco a wild
[51:25] horse of the desert brother david's road
[51:27] he's
[51:28] road ranch he's cowboy he knows what
[51:30] it's like to ride a good horse
[51:32] and how difficult it is to do the same
[51:35] job on a horse
[51:37] that's und pardon me with my words i'm
[51:40] not slipping
[51:42] converted an unconverted horse
[51:47] brings nothing but trouble
[51:53] yeah reminds me of a rancher friend that
[51:57] we knew years ago he's passed away now
[51:59] he said i tell you he said i will never
[52:02] never own a horse
[52:04] that will walk away from me i guess when
[52:07] he was young man he was somewhere doing
[52:09] doctor and a calf or something
[52:10] and he looked up and he sees his horse
[52:13] going up over the hill headed back
[52:14] towards the ranch
[52:17] and at that moment he made him he made
[52:18] his mind up i'll never own a horse that
[52:20] will leave me
[52:22] well i want you to think about this my
[52:23] brother and sister
[52:25] that in this we come to a place
[52:28] that a rod of pride could cause us
[52:32] to constantly leave
[52:36] the word you say well
[52:39] what do you mean by that brother paul
[52:41] you see
[52:43] we have the nature of christ
[52:46] but a rod of pride cannot be submitted
[52:50] to the word and
[52:54] exist as a rod of pride
[52:57] stiff the scripture speaks about
[52:59] stiff-necked
[53:01] heart of heart
[53:04] you see somewhere along we have to die
[53:07] can we say amen
[53:09] we have to die and decide we're going to
[53:11] submit to the word of god
[53:13] or we keep our rod of iron
[53:17] pride that's right unbendable no one's
[53:20] going to tell me
[53:22] not the preacher
[53:25] but let me turn that what if it wasn't
[53:28] really the preacher speaking to you
[53:31] what if it was god himself who said i'm
[53:35] going to use
[53:37] this vessel to speak
[53:40] and you say i don't want the words of
[53:42] that preacher and yet it's god
[53:45] speaking the rod of pride will not
[53:48] accept correction but the word of god
[53:52] says
[53:53] those i love
[53:58] what happens somewhere along the line
[54:00] our rod of pride must be broken
[54:03] it must be submitted otherwise we won't
[54:07] even god himself can't chasten us
[54:11] now i pardon me for using these words
[54:13] there's young people here
[54:15] but the scripture says very plainly very
[54:17] direct
[54:18] one that would not receive correction is
[54:20] a bastard child
[54:23] that's not us that is not us we
[54:26] will receive correction from the holy
[54:28] ghost
[54:29] it is not as man-lording we just read
[54:32] this this last sunday it's not as a
[54:33] preacher lording over the house of god
[54:35] yes those people exist
[54:39] my heart goes out to many people that
[54:41] are tape only and and
[54:42] of those things because they have been
[54:44] abused by ministry to the place
[54:47] they trust no man but i tell you what
[54:50] our brother eugene braun
[54:51] up in canada is a man of such a nature
[54:53] with horses he can take a horse that has
[54:55] been abused and will not trust a man
[54:58] and he just sent me a video the other
[54:59] day i'm not saying this horse was such
[55:01] but this is the nature brother eugene
[55:03] has and his desire
[55:05] and his communication with animals is
[55:07] that he's there in a round pin
[55:09] walking and he's got this horse that is
[55:11] following him and he's doubling back
[55:13] and he's doing all of these things and
[55:15] this horse there's no lead rope
[55:17] there's nothing this horse loves him
[55:20] this horse wants to be with him
[55:23] and you can take a horse that's been
[55:24] abused and you put the right man
[55:28] and he can cause that horse to trust
[55:32] again
[55:34] i said my heart goes out to those that
[55:35] have been abused by those that lorded
[55:37] over god's people
[55:38] over god's heritage they had no right to
[55:41] do that
[55:41] and they'll stand accountable one day
[55:43] for that but my brother and sister
[55:45] we have a god we can trust amen and we
[55:48] can stand with his word and he will not
[55:50] forsake us he said i'll never leave you
[55:53] i'll never forsake you we can stand on
[55:55] that
[55:56] amen we can trust god amen
[56:00] so we see in the mouth of the foolish is
[56:02] this rod
[56:04] of pride but the lips of the wise shall
[56:07] preserve him
[56:08] oh my brother and sister let's not let
[56:11] pride bring contention
[56:13] if we find ourselves in contention let
[56:16] us stop
[56:17] and say lord forgive me that my pride is
[56:20] causing me
[56:21] to bring contention my pride is causing
[56:23] me
[56:24] to act and behave and to live like i am
[56:27] lord break me let me come
[56:28] and come tenderly before you humbly
[56:31] before you
[56:33] oh you say well that must be people that
[56:35] have problems no saints tonight i'm
[56:37] talking to you and i
[56:38] am is that okay
[56:42] amen now verse 4 has quite
[56:47] an interesting thing to it that we shall
[56:50] look at here and maybe a tad bit more
[56:52] depth
[56:53] where no oxen are the crib is clean
[56:56] but much increases by the strength of
[57:00] the ox now you look at that and my
[57:03] brother and sister to me
[57:04] that scripture is very plain you see
[57:08] there's an easy way no effort involved
[57:12] you have the the uh
[57:16] crib is what that word is used the corel
[57:19] the pin the enclosure you see if there's
[57:22] no ox
[57:23] in the enclosure there's no ox in the
[57:26] corral there's no ox inside
[57:28] you won't have to feed you don't have to
[57:30] water you don't have to clean
[57:32] you don't have to do nothing but the
[57:35] scripture clearly shows you
[57:37] that you will not have much gain either
[57:43] so you'll find the very nature of an
[57:45] individual
[57:46] that says you know what i think i'm just
[57:48] going to take the
[57:49] easy way
[57:52] you realize whole churches are filled up
[57:54] with preachers
[57:55] that are preaching the easy way
[57:58] but nothing's gained
[58:02] put an ox put an aux in your corel put
[58:06] an aux in your pen
[58:11] old phrase goes way back my father used
[58:14] to speak this to me
[58:15] he'd remind me when i'd be like dad i
[58:17] don't want to do chores i don't want to
[58:19] do this i don't want to do that
[58:21] and you know that i just don't want to
[58:23] do that i don't want to spend my savings
[58:25] buying a trailer load of hogs i don't
[58:27] want to do this
[58:28] my dad would tell me nothing ventured
[58:31] nothing gained
[58:33] now i want you to apply that tonight my
[58:35] brother and sister as a christian
[58:37] i want an easy way i want an easy life
[58:40] as a christian i want things to go
[58:42] smooth i want it my way
[58:44] you've got no aux in your corel you want
[58:46] to come
[58:47] and you want to grow you want to gain
[58:50] you want to do that get an
[58:51] ox in your corel i hope you follow in
[58:54] the spiritual
[58:54] get something in there that you have to
[58:56] labor at you have to give
[58:58] effort into you have to dedicate
[59:00] yourself it might be that you would say
[59:03] well
[59:03] my prayer life is suffering and when i
[59:05] get down all i can do is say
[59:07] woe unto me lord woe unto me change my
[59:10] wife
[59:10] change my pastor change my church change
[59:13] my wife
[59:13] change my husband change my children how
[59:16] about you pray for someone else
[59:18] put that ox in your corel and instead of
[59:21] being there
[59:22] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa is me
[59:25] why don't you put an ox in your corel
[59:27] and you pick someone that you see around
[59:30] you
[59:30] and maybe it's not just someone you love
[59:32] but you start
[59:33] praying until you see god make a
[59:35] difference
[59:38] but no i want it simple i want it easy i
[59:41] want to pray for my family i want to
[59:42] pray for my prosperity i want to pray
[59:44] for the ease of my life
[59:47] oh have i offended anyone yet tonight
[59:51] spurgeon says i'm not doing my job until
[59:53] i offend someone so i'll keep laboring
[1:00:00] you see my brother and sister the manner
[1:00:02] woman that's willing to deal with the
[1:00:03] mess
[1:00:04] not bury it
[1:00:08] not bury it my daughter's been helping
[1:00:11] me i'm embarrassed myself but it's the
[1:00:13] truth
[1:00:14] my daughter's been helping us move and
[1:00:15] doing stuff
[1:00:17] and they went over in my office and
[1:00:18] they're like uh dad we opened the
[1:00:21] doors to the used to be a closet in a
[1:00:24] kid's room it's
[1:00:25] now a place i probably have 150 books in
[1:00:29] there
[1:00:30] and they looked in there and they're
[1:00:31] like dad we're just not touching that
[1:00:34] we can't touch that it's just i said why
[1:00:37] not it's just
[1:00:38] too much
[1:00:42] do you realize with organization that
[1:00:44] same closet could have been nice and
[1:00:45] tidy and probably held everything in an
[1:00:47] orderly fashion but you know paul read a
[1:00:49] book and it just seems like
[1:00:51] it was easier to set a book on top of a
[1:00:53] book to set a book on top of a book
[1:00:57] the easy way out but you know what i
[1:01:00] have today
[1:01:02] a mess and it might seem easier to open
[1:01:06] the closet door
[1:01:08] and put your troubles in the closet and
[1:01:10] close the door again
[1:01:11] i want the easy way out i don't want to
[1:01:14] have to face it
[1:01:15] i don't want to have to deal with it i
[1:01:16] don't want to have to come to conclusion
[1:01:18] i might actually find that i'm at fault
[1:01:23] so i'll put it in the closet and i'll
[1:01:25] close the door
[1:01:27] and then i'll say everyone stay out
[1:01:30] of my closet
[1:01:38] you see it's the manner of the woman
[1:01:39] that's willing to deal with the mess
[1:01:41] that sees the game
[1:01:43] the man or the woman that's willing to
[1:01:45] get down on their knees and submit to
[1:01:47] the holy spirit
[1:01:49] is the one who will see spiritual gain
[1:01:51] in their life
[1:01:53] that person will be the one that people
[1:01:55] will say they are so spiritual they are
[1:01:57] an overcomer
[1:01:58] what is it my brother and sister they
[1:02:00] decided to deal with the mess
[1:02:02] and often times the mass is their self
[1:02:04] that's right
[1:02:07] i'm still working on offending someone
[1:02:09] tonight am i getting closer
[1:02:13] you see if you're not willing to deal
[1:02:14] with the mess you're not willing to see
[1:02:16] you will not see gain
[1:02:19] we're willing to deal with our own
[1:02:21] spiritual position
[1:02:23] and realize that if we put the spiritual
[1:02:26] thermometer
[1:02:26] in there that we're closer to lukewarm
[1:02:28] than we are to red hot
[1:02:30] until we're willing to deal with that my
[1:02:32] brother and sister you'll see no
[1:02:34] gain in your spiritual life
[1:02:37] and then you'll say but is god going to
[1:02:38] answer my prayers well my brother and
[1:02:40] sister
[1:02:41] it's just a matter of how serious you
[1:02:43] are about those things
[1:02:48] please don't get quiet on me tonight
[1:02:54] now look at this dealing with a mess i'm
[1:02:55] going to draw we're going to shift a
[1:02:57] little direction here tonight is that
[1:02:58] okay
[1:02:59] now we're going to just draw from this a
[1:03:01] mess now brother branham says
[1:03:03] in door in the door he says a birth is a
[1:03:06] mess
[1:03:07] i don't care where it's at excuse this
[1:03:09] is expression
[1:03:10] but if a birth is in a pig pen it's a
[1:03:13] mess
[1:03:14] if it's in a cow barn it's a mess if
[1:03:16] it's in a hospital room
[1:03:18] it's a mess if it's at the altar
[1:03:22] it's a mess you see if we're not willing
[1:03:26] to deal with the mess
[1:03:27] we're not going to see any gain brother
[1:03:30] branham talks about this i don't want to
[1:03:32] get sidelined because it's a whole
[1:03:33] nother
[1:03:34] subject but brother branham says we have
[1:03:36] way too many dry
[1:03:37] eyed confessions we have way too many
[1:03:40] dry
[1:03:41] eyed coming i will do and and we'll deal
[1:03:43] with that in a quote here in a minute
[1:03:45] but my brother and sister
[1:03:46] if it's not a mess you didn't break
[1:03:48] through
[1:03:49] it's not a lifting a hand and say i
[1:03:51] believe the message
[1:03:54] it's got to be a birth there's got to be
[1:03:57] a birth my brother and sister
[1:03:59] this message is not exempt that we have
[1:04:02] come to the place
[1:04:03] that people come and they are not truly
[1:04:06] pouring their heart out they're not
[1:04:08] truly giving up a nature
[1:04:10] they're not desiring for god to deal
[1:04:12] with the nature because they look at the
[1:04:13] mess and say it's easier to close the
[1:04:15] closet doors of my mind
[1:04:17] the closet doors of my heart the closet
[1:04:19] doors of my life
[1:04:21] and not deal with it
[1:04:24] you say brother paul why are you
[1:04:26] preaching this way because i want you to
[1:04:27] make a rapture
[1:04:29] and you're not going to make the rapture
[1:04:31] with bitterness and unfounded things and
[1:04:33] anger and
[1:04:34] rebellion and all of these things
[1:04:36] harbored inside that closet
[1:04:38] we've got to open the door saints it's
[1:04:40] it's not that we open it
[1:04:42] to one another and then pour her shame
[1:04:44] out it's not a shame for sons and
[1:04:46] daughters of god
[1:04:47] to stand in front of the sons and
[1:04:49] daughters of god and the word says
[1:04:51] confess your best parts
[1:04:56] confess your utter utter incredibility
[1:05:02] no it says confess your faults
[1:05:07] but you see i'm still working on
[1:05:09] offending someone tonight so i can make
[1:05:11] spurgeon's words come true
[1:05:13] that you haven't truly preached the
[1:05:15] gospel until you preached it to the
[1:05:16] level of
[1:05:17] offending people but you see the reason
[1:05:21] we can't get there it's because we have
[1:05:24] this rod of pride
[1:05:32] and if i was to come to a brother and
[1:05:34] say brother i have this and this issue
[1:05:36] i have this in my life and i need
[1:05:38] delivered
[1:05:41] what will he think of me what will they
[1:05:44] think of me
[1:05:46] what will everyone think of me if they
[1:05:48] realize i'm human
[1:05:52] what is it it's pride
[1:05:56] and our pride is greater than our desire
[1:05:59] to be free
[1:06:05] if it's at the altar it's a mess it'll
[1:06:08] hmm brother branham he just
[1:06:12] is so mean he would not pass
[1:06:17] diversity training in 2021
[1:06:22] because he's me it'll make you rot
[1:06:26] in your own thinking your thinking will
[1:06:29] have to be
[1:06:30] dead and rotting
[1:06:33] it'll make you throw away everything
[1:06:36] things that you once
[1:06:38] cherished with all of your heart
[1:06:41] you give up to let that little still
[1:06:43] knock
[1:06:45] now look at this you think oh the things
[1:06:49] i cherished with all of my heart
[1:06:51] if we're not careful we'll be looking at
[1:06:53] i wanted a nice house i wanted a nice
[1:06:55] car i wanted nice clothes i wanted this
[1:06:57] do you realize the thing that most of us
[1:06:59] cherish most
[1:07:01] is buried within us it's not
[1:07:05] external
[1:07:08] it is our desire for control
[1:07:12] of the world around us
[1:07:15] our desire to control everything
[1:07:20] is a nature of humanity
[1:07:24] and that's why when the scripture says
[1:07:25] cast all your cares unto him
[1:07:27] we have such a struggle i'm gonna fix
[1:07:30] this
[1:07:30] i can fix this i will fix this
[1:07:35] and instead if we're broken and we're
[1:07:39] rotten to our own thinking we're gonna
[1:07:40] say i can't fix this lord i've got to
[1:07:43] give this to you
[1:07:44] not all i'll force to give it to you but
[1:07:47] we'll come to the place we'll say lord i
[1:07:49] have to give it to you i want to give it
[1:07:52] to you i can't do this
[1:07:56] but you see we cherish the ability to
[1:07:59] say
[1:08:00] i fixed my problem
[1:08:13] i don't know if you realize just how
[1:08:16] hard this is for me to preach
[1:08:19] because while i might be pointing a
[1:08:21] finger out there
[1:08:25] i'm facing the very reality of what i'm
[1:08:27] saying to you
[1:08:29] is this not so right that's right
[1:08:33] please no one get an idea that i'm
[1:08:35] trying to pick on somebody
[1:08:37] pick on you in particular i have to face
[1:08:40] what i preach
[1:08:41] my own self amen that's right
[1:08:46] you see now brother brown says here
[1:08:50] where has thy strength go on samson says
[1:08:52] we all know that the bible teaches
[1:08:54] the new birth yes and they substituted
[1:08:56] handshakes
[1:08:58] and everything else for the new birth
[1:09:00] but it'll never take the place of the
[1:09:02] new birth
[1:09:03] it's got to be an experience it's
[1:09:05] aborned again
[1:09:07] now look i don't mean to be negative but
[1:09:09] look i'm not going to be stand before
[1:09:11] god one day
[1:09:12] and not speak against these things and
[1:09:14] do it we have
[1:09:15] not replaced a signing on a book come on
[1:09:20] saints i want you to think about this if
[1:09:21] brother paul
[1:09:22] come on a sunday morning called brother
[1:09:25] ivan he'd probably refuse
[1:09:28] but i said brother ivan now you're going
[1:09:30] to go from row to row
[1:09:32] and you're going to get all the saints
[1:09:33] to sign the membership book
[1:09:38] come on who who would say i'll sign it
[1:09:45] no sir because we don't believe in the
[1:09:46] membership book
[1:09:49] it's not about membership to this church
[1:09:52] and my name's already in the book and
[1:09:54] your name is already in the book we
[1:09:56] don't need to go sign in somebody's book
[1:10:00] but you see my brother and sister in the
[1:10:02] message i don't want to offend no one
[1:10:05] we've settled for god's center prophet
[1:10:08] yes
[1:10:08] god says prophet you're in no my brother
[1:10:12] and sister
[1:10:12] no substitute for a new birth nothing
[1:10:15] will substitute for a new birth
[1:10:18] it don't matter that my grandpappy and
[1:10:20] and my grandma
[1:10:21] and all all sides of our family and my
[1:10:24] parents and
[1:10:25] and my siblings and my children all
[1:10:28] believe
[1:10:29] doesn't matter that's right doesn't
[1:10:31] matter there's got to be a new birth
[1:10:34] and the new birth brings a nature change
[1:10:36] we cannot have the nature of the crow
[1:10:40] oh come on my brother and sister the
[1:10:41] prophet of god teaches he's saying
[1:10:43] we can't have the nature of the crow and
[1:10:45] be a dove we cannot eat
[1:10:47] its food but it can eat ours
[1:10:53] so don't get the idea that we're all
[1:10:55] eating the same food we must all have
[1:10:56] the same revelation and same
[1:10:58] understanding and the same love to the
[1:10:59] lord
[1:11:00] no sir
[1:11:06] we all know that any kind of birth is a
[1:11:09] mess
[1:11:10] when a baby is born if it's on the floor
[1:11:12] if it's in the shock pile
[1:11:13] or a pink decorated hospital room it's a
[1:11:15] mess but it brings life
[1:11:18] anybody crave life i tell you what
[1:11:22] i don't mean to do this and i'll get in
[1:11:24] trouble with some parents that will
[1:11:26] have to whip their kids for me speaking
[1:11:28] things out and their kids turn around
[1:11:30] repeating it
[1:11:31] but there was a song i'll just put it
[1:11:33] that way my childhood
[1:11:38] and the song talked about searching for
[1:11:40] life
[1:11:44] i could sing it to you that some of your
[1:11:47] parents had whipped me next
[1:11:49] and after you whipped your kids for
[1:11:50] singing but in the song they're just
[1:11:52] talking about how they're searching
[1:11:54] they're searching they're searching
[1:11:56] searching for life
[1:12:01] come on part of our human nature
[1:12:05] it's who we are we were made to worship
[1:12:07] we were
[1:12:08] made and we'll search for life but what
[1:12:11] level of life
[1:12:12] will we stop searching at is what's
[1:12:16] important
[1:12:17] we can settle for a denominational
[1:12:19] experience i could i could have just
[1:12:20] plastered you tonight with quotes
[1:12:22] brother brown says some people get just
[1:12:24] enough to join a church
[1:12:28] i don't want to join the church i want
[1:12:29] to go in the rapture i was born to be
[1:12:31] i am the rapture some people all freak
[1:12:34] out over that no
[1:12:35] i tell you i can give you quotes where
[1:12:36] brother branham says that you are the
[1:12:38] rapture and you are moving forward from
[1:12:40] here
[1:12:42] amen hallelujah
[1:12:45] it doesn't matter shuck pile pink
[1:12:47] decorated hospital room it's a mess but
[1:12:49] it brings life
[1:12:50] and that's what the new birth is it's a
[1:12:52] mess
[1:12:53] but it brings life it isn't a style
[1:12:56] it is or a put on or a declaration of
[1:12:59] creeds
[1:13:00] it's baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:13:02] that's the secret
[1:13:04] of the real bible a real oh i put bible
[1:13:07] in there
[1:13:07] sorry because when i think of
[1:13:11] believers i think of the bible
[1:13:15] that's the secret of the real believing
[1:13:17] church
[1:13:18] come on church we want to be that kind
[1:13:20] of church we want to be
[1:13:22] that kind of church that is the real
[1:13:26] believing church we don't want to stop
[1:13:28] anywhere
[1:13:29] short of all of the word of god
[1:13:33] you know i've been criticized you know
[1:13:35] people say well say only what the
[1:13:36] prophet said
[1:13:37] and you know i'm i'm sorry this goes
[1:13:39] into a deal i won't explain it but my
[1:13:41] brother and sister my response to that
[1:13:43] don't just say just what the prophet
[1:13:44] said
[1:13:44] because i can give you quotes right now
[1:13:47] that i could read to you
[1:13:48] that would imply a certain angle and you
[1:13:51] would look at that so i
[1:13:52] say don't just say what the prophet said
[1:13:54] say all
[1:13:56] that the prophet said let's not cherry
[1:13:59] pick some little spot you know how the
[1:14:00] quotation thing is
[1:14:02] dot dot dot dot our favorite quote
[1:14:05] dot dot dot dot
[1:14:09] no let's say all that he said let's take
[1:14:12] every portion of it get it all in
[1:14:14] balance get it all in focus not just a
[1:14:17] part that
[1:14:18] fits well hallelujah
[1:14:23] because we would not only have the cow
[1:14:24] on the top of the tree we would have
[1:14:26] built a nice spiral golden staircase
[1:14:28] our own version of babel
[1:14:32] to get the cow in the tree
[1:14:40] what's the secret church of the real
[1:14:44] believing church
[1:14:47] mourned again
[1:14:51] you say brother paul we are born again
[1:14:55] that's wonderful
[1:14:56] i say amen thank you lord because you
[1:14:59] see the old adage if the shoe
[1:15:01] fits wear it and if it doesn't toss it
[1:15:05] to the one you think it fits
[1:15:09] okay so i messed up the old adage a
[1:15:11] little bit
[1:15:18] a faithful witness will not lie but a
[1:15:20] false witness will utter lies
[1:15:23] a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it
[1:15:25] not but knowledge is easy unto him
[1:15:27] that understand it you see my brother
[1:15:30] and sister when eyes are opened and ears
[1:15:32] are open our understanding which we
[1:15:34] would call revelation
[1:15:36] when that comes to you can we say amen
[1:15:39] we've experienced it
[1:15:40] revelation god's word speaking to us not
[1:15:43] a man's interpretation not
[1:15:45] an explanation not an educational class
[1:15:49] not a tutorial but revelation
[1:15:53] amen when that comes to you how many can
[1:15:56] testify that when revelation has been
[1:15:58] opened to you was to you not someone
[1:16:01] else you start to see
[1:16:03] here here here here
[1:16:06] here here here and it all starts to come
[1:16:08] together
[1:16:09] they don't conflict they don't come and
[1:16:12] start bouncing off of each other and
[1:16:14] pieces flying everywhere and
[1:16:15] something's falling to the floor no sir
[1:16:18] when revelation comes
[1:16:19] it starts to come to you and it starts
[1:16:21] going and if it had an audible
[1:16:23] sound of a click you would be hearing
[1:16:26] click click click click click
[1:16:28] click click and it starts coming
[1:16:32] together
[1:16:36] or we can settle for someone who's very
[1:16:38] articulate would have made a good school
[1:16:40] teacher
[1:16:41] showing us this should fit here
[1:16:44] and if this fits here then this must fit
[1:16:47] here
[1:16:48] well sister ruth was sharing with me
[1:16:51] very interesting i enjoyed that
[1:16:52] conversation sister ruth
[1:16:54] about a puzzle with a picture on both
[1:16:56] sides and pieces
[1:16:58] that are exactly the same
[1:17:01] only they don't belong there
[1:17:05] even if they fit
[1:17:11] but did see the very elect saints
[1:17:15] if it was possible oh
[1:17:18] look it must be right it fits
[1:17:26] but the picture's wrong
[1:17:30] think about it think about it but what
[1:17:33] does revelation do
[1:17:36] revelation allows you before you ever
[1:17:38] try to put that in place in your life
[1:17:41] to say that might fit
[1:17:44] my thinking my emotion
[1:17:48] my reasoning but it doesn't fit the word
[1:17:52] because it's not painting the right
[1:17:56] picture
[1:18:00] so what happens revelation starts to
[1:18:04] come in
[1:18:06] this knowledge my brother and sister is
[1:18:08] not a man's knowledge otherwise we would
[1:18:09] all as believers get a phd
[1:18:12] in religion and make the rapture
[1:18:15] so it's not that kind of knowledge
[1:18:19] so when our eyes and ears are
[1:18:20] understanding revelation starts to come
[1:18:22] it all starts to come together
[1:18:24] and we realize after a while we are
[1:18:27] you might say little walking
[1:18:28] encyclopedias
[1:18:32] you understand what i'm saying we know
[1:18:34] what goes where and we know what these
[1:18:36] things tie together
[1:18:37] and we can say this is what god meant
[1:18:40] get this now saints
[1:18:41] we're not talking about arrogant and
[1:18:43] we're not talking about being assumptive
[1:18:45] we're talking about revelation coming to
[1:18:47] you
[1:18:48] and you can stand there and say this is
[1:18:50] what the word meant
[1:18:51] and the word tied to this and this tie
[1:18:54] together and it produces this right here
[1:18:56] and you stand there and people are like
[1:18:58] how do you you sound
[1:19:00] how why do you think you're that my
[1:19:01] brother and sister they don't understand
[1:19:03] because revelation hasn't come
[1:19:05] that the intellect that you are
[1:19:07] displaying in their terms
[1:19:09] the intellect you display is not your
[1:19:11] intellect
[1:19:12] the mind of christ is in you
[1:19:16] and you are then speaking the word and
[1:19:19] the word
[1:19:19] is coming forth from your lips just like
[1:19:22] it would be the preacher
[1:19:24] but it's not you it's god speaking
[1:19:26] through you
[1:19:27] because it is god in you
[1:19:33] hallelujah and so people will say well
[1:19:36] where do you guys get that how do you
[1:19:38] tie all that together that's not what
[1:19:40] our church believes
[1:19:41] my brother and sister i can't help what
[1:19:43] they believe without revelation
[1:19:45] but when revelations come and i believe
[1:19:48] you can say amen to this when
[1:19:49] revelations come
[1:19:50] you cannot unsee it you cannot just say
[1:19:54] i'm gonna wipe my
[1:19:56] my hard drive and just not see the
[1:19:58] revelation of jesus christ
[1:20:00] you can't do it
[1:20:04] because it becomes your very life
[1:20:08] but knowledge is easy and to him
[1:20:12] that understandeth right aren't you glad
[1:20:15] that's why the prophet of god is saying
[1:20:16] so let me build this foundation for you
[1:20:17] he said pray for revelation first and
[1:20:19] foremost pray for revelation
[1:20:21] because then you can fulfill this
[1:20:23] scripture because then god has filled
[1:20:25] you with his knowledge
[1:20:27] and all the rest of the bible and life
[1:20:32] all start just falling in place
[1:20:35] and before you ever try to squeeze
[1:20:37] something into your life
[1:20:40] the holy spirit speaks to you and says
[1:20:42] that might
[1:20:43] fit but it's the wrong nature
[1:20:48] it's going to paint the wrong picture
[1:20:51] it's not going to produce the desired
[1:20:53] results
[1:20:55] right that's right because those he
[1:20:56] loves
[1:20:58] he chases and some when he chastens them
[1:21:01] it would be as it were with a rod of
[1:21:03] iron but some as he chastens is just a
[1:21:05] nudge
[1:21:07] as i heard a minister once say he said
[1:21:09] there's a reason they put the little
[1:21:11] strip on the side of the road
[1:21:13] where your car goes rumble rumble rumble
[1:21:16] it lets you know you're getting off the
[1:21:19] road
[1:21:20] and the holy spirit has become your
[1:21:22] rumble strip
[1:21:24] that when you start to get off he starts
[1:21:28] warning you you're getting off you're
[1:21:30] getting off you're getting off you're
[1:21:32] getting off
[1:21:34] and if somehow we get past that you
[1:21:36] still have two more wheels
[1:21:39] you're still going to be safe even if
[1:21:41] you're
[1:21:42] part way off the road because you got
[1:21:44] two more wheels and the rumble strip
[1:21:46] speaks the same message get back in line
[1:21:48] get back in line
[1:21:49] get back in line get back in line
[1:21:54] oh can't you thank god holy ghost is our
[1:21:56] rumble strip saints
[1:21:58] amen i thank you lord thank you lord
[1:22:02] because i tell you what a lot of us have
[1:22:03] plowed up a lot of sagebrush without the
[1:22:05] holy ghost in our life
[1:22:07] amen hallelujah you see it's god's
[1:22:10] intelligence showing us when where and
[1:22:12] how
[1:22:13] amen it's always been him and it will
[1:22:16] always be him
[1:22:17] amen oh my the wisdom of the prudent
[1:22:20] verse 8
[1:22:22] is to understand his way but the folly
[1:22:25] of fools is deceit
[1:22:27] you know what
[1:22:30] i say how beautiful it is when the lord
[1:22:32] shows us our way you know there's two
[1:22:34] sides to that
[1:22:35] i've spoke about him loving us and
[1:22:36] chastening us
[1:22:38] there's two sides to that tonight those
[1:22:41] he loves he chastens we all say thank
[1:22:43] you lord you're correct to me
[1:22:45] come on saints let's not push back
[1:22:47] against it let's not say somebody's got
[1:22:49] an axe to grind it's
[1:22:50] to do i'm laboring you might realize it
[1:22:53] tonight i'm laboring to preach this to
[1:22:54] you because i don't want to be
[1:22:55] misunderstood
[1:22:58] but you see we've got to open the closet
[1:23:00] door and we've got to face what we've
[1:23:02] thrown in there for years
[1:23:04] we've got to face it because at some
[1:23:07] point in our life we have to clean out
[1:23:09] that closet
[1:23:11] amen my who would think moving and
[1:23:13] having a closet full of books could be a
[1:23:15] sermon
[1:23:19] those he loves he chastens but the
[1:23:21] scripture says also blessed is a man
[1:23:23] whose eyes can see
[1:23:25] and ears can hear look at the two sides
[1:23:28] of this
[1:23:29] he chastens us corrects us because he
[1:23:31] loves us and then he
[1:23:32] opens our eyes he opens our ears and
[1:23:35] then says oh praise god their eyes are
[1:23:37] open their ears are open i'm going to
[1:23:39] pour blessings and knowledge and wisdom
[1:23:41] and revelation into them and he's the
[1:23:43] one that did it all the time
[1:23:46] and here we are we'd be off power and
[1:23:48] brush in the countryside out through the
[1:23:50] desert
[1:23:51] but god said no i'm going to warn them
[1:23:53] i'm going to bring them back i'm going
[1:23:54] to catch their attention all chasing
[1:23:55] them
[1:23:56] because i love them and i'm going to
[1:23:58] bring them to a place
[1:23:59] not running off the side of the road not
[1:24:01] getting lost in the journey
[1:24:03] not getting lost in laodicea in the
[1:24:05] wilderness of sin isn't it amazing the
[1:24:08] name that was given when israel was
[1:24:10] going from egypt
[1:24:11] into the promised land the wilderness of
[1:24:13] sin well we've got a wilderness of sin
[1:24:16] right here it's on the earth today and
[1:24:19] it's on
[1:24:19] every continent every island every place
[1:24:22] there's a wilderness of sin
[1:24:23] and god says you know what they're going
[1:24:25] to get lost in the wilderness sin
[1:24:27] they're going to get turned around and
[1:24:28] some are going to say nope i'm just
[1:24:30] going to go back to egypt but he says
[1:24:32] nope i love them
[1:24:33] and i want to bring them to the place i
[1:24:35] can pour wisdom and knowledge and
[1:24:36] revelation
[1:24:37] into them so that i can say hey look
[1:24:39] you've got revelation you got wisdom you
[1:24:41] got knowledge
[1:24:42] i'm going to pour more into you god
[1:24:44] bless you my son god bless you my
[1:24:45] daughter and the whole time it's him
[1:24:47] it's him it's him it's him
[1:24:49] it's no man it's no ability we have we
[1:24:52] should lift a hand and say thank you
[1:24:53] lord you love me so much
[1:24:55] that you're going to pour yourself into
[1:24:57] me
[1:25:00] oh hallelujah
[1:25:03] let me hurry along here
[1:25:08] when i pass from this life maybe you
[1:25:10] guys will remember that i consider
[1:25:12] time to be a relenting unrelenting foe
[1:25:20] verse 12 there's a way that seemeth
[1:25:24] right unto a man but the end thereof
[1:25:26] are the ways of death without going on
[1:25:29] further into my notes too deep here
[1:25:31] i want to just bring it to you brother
[1:25:32] branham says in the sermon satan's eden
[1:25:35] he said that that is speaking of an
[1:25:37] intellectual
[1:25:38] reasoning of the word of god a way that
[1:25:42] seems right you know what it makes
[1:25:43] perfect sense brother david brother
[1:25:45] chris
[1:25:45] that we as a ministry ought to leave
[1:25:47] lead the church
[1:25:48] in this fashion right here we can preach
[1:25:51] without talking about the prophet we can
[1:25:54] do this without doing that
[1:25:55] we can come and have church without
[1:25:57] communion because that well that's
[1:25:59] old-fashioned
[1:26:00] we can do these things we can lower a
[1:26:02] standard a little bit fill it up
[1:26:04] build a new building have a nice deal a
[1:26:06] good reputation
[1:26:07] visitors will stay because we're so
[1:26:09] hospitable and we can do this
[1:26:12] and somewhere along the line will make a
[1:26:15] difference
[1:26:18] now without implying of anyone
[1:26:22] when where and how i had a man in the
[1:26:25] message
[1:26:26] a minister sat down
[1:26:29] asked me to sit down with him
[1:26:33] and explain to me that the reason their
[1:26:37] church has taken the stand that it's
[1:26:39] taken
[1:26:40] is someone has to reach out to the
[1:26:43] foolish
[1:26:44] virgin
[1:26:48] well let me just declare it to the
[1:26:50] internet to the world
[1:26:52] i'm here to preach to the bride of jesus
[1:26:54] christ
[1:26:55] i'm not here trying to catch the foolish
[1:26:58] virgin
[1:26:59] because the foolish virgin under that
[1:27:01] anointing is not going to apply
[1:27:04] the word in the fashion that she should
[1:27:06] but this bride
[1:27:07] will take every drop of the word she
[1:27:10] will submit herself to the word
[1:27:12] she will say lord my heart's desire is
[1:27:15] to be
[1:27:16] your word i don't want to just confess
[1:27:19] that your word is true
[1:27:20] i want to be your word i want to be what
[1:27:24] it's talking about
[1:27:26] i want to be that man i want to be
[1:27:29] that woman
[1:27:33] we're not here to say look let's all
[1:27:35] compromise together so
[1:27:37] the foolish virgin will feel comfortable
[1:27:40] i say foolish virgin find an altar
[1:27:43] get the holy ghost get filled up get on
[1:27:47] fire
[1:27:48] don't settle for the lukewarm don't
[1:27:51] settle for
[1:27:51] a human justification i'm justified
[1:27:55] they said this i can say this they did
[1:27:58] this
[1:27:58] i can do this forget about your
[1:28:00] justification
[1:28:02] get into christ get into the word become
[1:28:06] that word
[1:28:07] hallelujah do i care about the foolish
[1:28:10] virgin i have no clue who they are
[1:28:12] i care about them but i rather stand
[1:28:15] knowing i preach the truth
[1:28:17] than to stand saying i compromised that
[1:28:20] they would be comfortable
[1:28:24] look what kind of anointing is that will
[1:28:27] lower the whole
[1:28:28] standard of the church so that this
[1:28:31] person
[1:28:31] will feel comfortable that is nonsense
[1:28:35] my brother and sister
[1:28:37] we are not lowering the standard of the
[1:28:39] word so that we can justify to ourselves
[1:28:42] that we somehow attracted the people of
[1:28:45] our neighborhood
[1:28:45] the prophet of god said in fact when the
[1:28:48] mayor of the city starts coming to
[1:28:50] church
[1:28:50] you have reason to be concerned
[1:28:53] that's right come on i don't mean to
[1:28:55] hurt anybody's feelings
[1:28:57] but we got to deal with the truth saints
[1:29:00] hallelujah
[1:29:01] so brother brown says here a way that
[1:29:03] seemeth right unto a man but the end
[1:29:04] thereof is a ways of death
[1:29:06] brother branham clearly says you can
[1:29:08] find it in the sermon satan's eden
[1:29:10] he says right there see that was
[1:29:11] intellectual that was reasoning
[1:29:16] oh can i have a couple more minutes
[1:29:19] hallelujah
[1:29:21] oh my faith cometh by hearing brother
[1:29:24] brown says here
[1:29:26] now look i'm closing i just want to i
[1:29:28] just want to have a moment to
[1:29:30] it's a fairly long quote i want to have
[1:29:31] a moment to just expound upon this
[1:29:34] not just skip through it now hope will
[1:29:37] agree with the bible
[1:29:41] i hope
[1:29:47] i hope i don't know if any of you
[1:29:50] brother kenny you'll never hear this any
[1:29:53] of you know brother kenny capps
[1:29:55] little fireball all five feet of him
[1:30:01] he makes a comment the other day
[1:30:02] somebody had posted a deal
[1:30:04] can you make it to heaven without
[1:30:05] baptism
[1:30:07] brother kenny made a comment said well
[1:30:10] it's in the scripture boy you talk about
[1:30:14] a firestorm
[1:30:17] that's why saints you won't find brother
[1:30:19] paul commenting on the internet
[1:30:22] because you might as well carry a fire
[1:30:23] extinguisher because there's
[1:30:25] it don't take nothing to turn it into a
[1:30:27] big fireball
[1:30:29] and so they were people and they had
[1:30:31] every crazy
[1:30:32] idea on there i mean it was unbelievable
[1:30:37] what people
[1:30:37] said well our church and i think and
[1:30:40] that can't be
[1:30:41] and brother kenny god bless you but he
[1:30:44] had sense enough he just
[1:30:45] bowed out and the fire raged on without
[1:30:49] him
[1:30:51] i shared a little of that with sister
[1:30:52] jerry
[1:30:54] you have people making absolutely
[1:30:57] unscriptural
[1:30:58] declarations concerning baptism
[1:31:04] couldn't back it up with the bible if
[1:31:05] their life depended on it
[1:31:08] our pastor teaches our church says
[1:31:13] you see these are the very words the
[1:31:14] prophet of god said would come to the
[1:31:16] day
[1:31:18] and he took it back to the scripture to
[1:31:20] show us where the scripture said
[1:31:21] it'll come to that day
[1:31:24] imagine that now hope will agree with
[1:31:28] the bible hope will say
[1:31:29] it's true hope will say i believe every
[1:31:31] bit of it i believe that's the word of
[1:31:33] god
[1:31:33] i believe that god will keep his promise
[1:31:35] hope believes all of that
[1:31:37] but hope then says now i believe that
[1:31:39] god will heal
[1:31:40] but look at my condition
[1:31:49] come on saint you wonder why brother
[1:31:50] paul kind of chastised the church a
[1:31:52] little bit about how you'll stand out in
[1:31:53] the foyer
[1:31:54] talk about your illnesses aches and
[1:31:56] pains and
[1:31:58] you won't bring it up here and put it
[1:32:00] before the body of christ
[1:32:04] hope believes all that
[1:32:07] i believe god will heal me but
[1:32:10] let me tell you about how my hip my knee
[1:32:13] and
[1:32:14] my back and my shoulder and my head
[1:32:22] brother when when was your prayer
[1:32:24] request did i miss it
[1:32:27] when did you ask the body of believers
[1:32:29] which is the manifested body of
[1:32:31] jesus christ when did you bring that to
[1:32:34] them
[1:32:35] that they could lift it to the throne
[1:32:38] i must have missed it and i do sometimes
[1:32:42] the other day i said oh
[1:32:43] brother jason forgot to make an
[1:32:45] announcement and jerry's like no he made
[1:32:46] the announcement
[1:32:47] and i said i must have still been in the
[1:32:49] back and she's like no you were standing
[1:32:50] beside me
[1:32:53] oh i would never do that i'm i'm not
[1:32:55] that old
[1:32:57] i'm not that mentally decrepit yet am i
[1:33:02] thank you for not saying amen
[1:33:05] no look at this my brother and sister i
[1:33:07] believe god will heal but look at my
[1:33:09] condition
[1:33:09] now faith don't look at that faith comes
[1:33:13] around and says i don't care
[1:33:14] nothing about conditions god
[1:33:17] said so and it's mine
[1:33:23] you see faith's burly
[1:33:27] as i once said faith has hair on the
[1:33:29] chest and when it stands up and pulls
[1:33:31] its big muscles out
[1:33:33] everything else vanishes away
[1:33:36] just takes flies away when faith really
[1:33:38] takes a hold
[1:33:39] nothing else stands
[1:33:42] i'm telling you faith but you've got to
[1:33:46] have hope
[1:33:47] let's get this balance right everything
[1:33:49] is about balance
[1:33:51] you've got to have hope and charity
[1:33:55] see let's not substitute hope for real
[1:33:58] faith
[1:34:00] but when you as it were want faith and
[1:34:04] you pursue faith
[1:34:05] you can't throw hope and charity out
[1:34:11] praise god i remember one time
[1:34:15] this is many years ago a prayer line
[1:34:17] they were really
[1:34:18] popular in church when i was growing up
[1:34:21] mind
[1:34:21] times they might have been three or four
[1:34:22] prayer lines in a month
[1:34:25] somebody would come up for prayer and
[1:34:27] somebody else would come
[1:34:29] my sister jerry one time got all
[1:34:31] flustered and
[1:34:32] upset down in chile one time because
[1:34:34] she's like that one sister went through
[1:34:35] the line
[1:34:36] four times what sister
[1:34:39] jerry didn't know is the first time was
[1:34:41] for her second time was for her husband
[1:34:43] third time was for her mother
[1:34:48] sister jerry's like she didn't realize
[1:34:49] how tired you were she could have done
[1:34:51] that all at once
[1:34:53] but look sorry sorry for the humor
[1:34:59] see you've got to have hope and charity
[1:35:02] and if you've got real burly faith and
[1:35:04] no love in it you'll ruin your
[1:35:05] influence before the people if you
[1:35:07] haven't got love
[1:35:09] mixed with it see you've seen people
[1:35:11] real burly
[1:35:12] what we would say excuse the expression
[1:35:14] bulldog faith
[1:35:16] grab a hold but it was so rough with it
[1:35:18] then you see
[1:35:20] when you do that it doesn't it hasn't
[1:35:22] got the kindness here to move with it
[1:35:24] so what we need is hope faith and
[1:35:27] charity
[1:35:28] isn't that right hope faith and charity
[1:35:30] together god
[1:35:31] help our children to have it like that
[1:35:34] can we say amen to that
[1:35:36] god help our children our church i mean
[1:35:39] excuse me
[1:35:40] god help our church to have it like that
[1:35:43] faith hope and charity
[1:35:47] amen that we can stand rugged and strong
[1:35:50] and determined real warriors on the word
[1:35:53] but we can wrap that all in love
[1:35:57] look i remember many years ago sorry i
[1:35:59] don't mean to be nostalgic but i'm going
[1:36:00] to drive this home
[1:36:01] but i can remember many years ago when
[1:36:03] the preachers were proud of the fact
[1:36:05] they would come out
[1:36:06] in the service and say i know that young
[1:36:09] men like you
[1:36:10] are sinning i know that you are not
[1:36:13] living right
[1:36:14] i know and you need to be in that altar
[1:36:16] and if you're not in that altar i'll
[1:36:18] come back and i'll drag you up there
[1:36:22] you know what happened next service he
[1:36:24] was sitting back here
[1:36:28] and when he was 18 he never walked in
[1:36:30] the doors of a church again
[1:36:34] where was the love where was the love
[1:36:37] where he might know
[1:36:39] brother sean will stand as my example
[1:36:41] i'm sure he doesn't mind
[1:36:42] i would know he's sinning
[1:36:47] might even saw him as it were walking
[1:36:50] into the theater
[1:36:52] might have saw him somewhere in the city
[1:36:54] where he didn't belong
[1:36:57] but you see with faith hope
[1:37:00] and charity i would start working my way
[1:37:04] real slow
[1:37:05] just like the hunter and the hunted
[1:37:09] and i would work myself into his
[1:37:10] friendship and i would work myself into
[1:37:12] his confidence
[1:37:14] until i could stand with my arm around
[1:37:16] his shoulders
[1:37:17] and say son been down that road
[1:37:21] there's a better way don't go there
[1:37:25] don't go there come back to the cross
[1:37:30] you see it's not about superiority
[1:37:34] it's about god's heritage it's about
[1:37:38] us loving those
[1:37:41] that we see as sons and daughters of god
[1:37:44] so much
[1:37:46] that we'll do everything we can do
[1:37:47] within our ability to draw them back to
[1:37:50] christ
[1:37:51] not show them not shame them not
[1:37:54] humiliate them
[1:37:57] but draw them back
[1:38:03] hasn't got the kindness here to move
[1:38:05] with it so what we need is
[1:38:06] hope faith and charity isn't that right
[1:38:08] hope faith and charity together
[1:38:10] god help i say this again god help our
[1:38:12] church god help grace tabernacle to have
[1:38:14] it like that the people
[1:38:16] to have that combination but
[1:38:19] if you just rely on hope you hinder
[1:38:21] faith
[1:38:22] now hope looks for something way off but
[1:38:25] faith
[1:38:26] claims it right now
[1:38:30] right here see faith says god said so
[1:38:34] and it's mine that settles it it's done
[1:38:36] see
[1:38:37] i don't care if i'm still crippled i'm
[1:38:39] still blind if i'm still sick
[1:38:41] then i don't have nothing to do with it
[1:38:42] i believe it anyhow
[1:38:44] it's mine right now god said so and that
[1:38:47] settles see that's faith

[1:39:21] the devil's outside the door crying
[1:39:28] because we failed to claim a promise of
[1:39:30] god
[1:39:31] and then we blamed it on the devil
[1:39:36] and he's outside the door saying i
[1:39:37] didn't have nothing to do with it it was
[1:39:39] right there all they had to do is step
[1:39:41] out and claim it
[1:39:42] [Music]

[1:48:33] scary we often talk about how miserable
[1:48:36] the cinder is
[1:48:37] but sometimes god catches people that
[1:48:40] are perfectly
[1:48:41] happy in their sin
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:45] and he draws them out of that because

[1:48:50] much greater than what satan
[1:48:53] can offer i'll tell you what my brother
[1:48:56] and sister

[1:49:09] want to be happy and something down
[1:49:11] inside of them
[1:49:12] sparks and at that moment they realize
