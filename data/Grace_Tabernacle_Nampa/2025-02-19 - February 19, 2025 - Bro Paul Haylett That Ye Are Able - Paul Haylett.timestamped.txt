[30:11] your you know that song actually is our
[30:14] Declaration of ownership amen we're
[30:17] declaring this is who I belong to and uh
[30:21] you know that's actually a very
[30:24] necessary thing we we have to clearly
[30:26] identify our position we see in the
[30:29] scripture uh remember Those portions of
[30:32] scripture concerning at the Jubilee time
[30:35] and the the post and the all and uh you
[30:39] know there were those that valued their
[30:41] security in the natural more than they
[30:46] desired their Liberty
[30:48] spiritually and they would allow their
[30:51] ear to be bored and what they were doing
[30:54] was declaring their ownership and uh
[30:57] we're here
[30:58] the Lord's given us ears to hear amen
[31:01] eyes to see we're
[31:03] declaring our leadership our ownership
[31:07] we're declaring Lord I hear your word
[31:09] and that word means more than anything
[31:11] else to me and that's where I belong
[31:14] amen God bless you brother vile good to
[31:17] see you amen amen let's just stand as we
[31:22] would go thank you brother Alex Amen
[31:24] brother
[31:26] Isaac and um
[31:30] sister Vanessa thank you so much um I
[31:32] want to speak to you
[31:34] tonight um on the thought taken from
[31:37] scripture that ye are able amen and um
[31:41] as we look at this 1 Corinthians the
[31:43] 10th chapter quite a lengthy scripture
[31:45] reading so we'll just break it off after
[31:47] a few verses here to kind of make a
[31:50] little bit of comment uh in that uh 1
[31:54] Corinthians 10 1-4 to start
[32:01] with moreover Brethren I would not that
[32:05] you should be ignorant now if we stopped
[32:08] right there that right there could be a
[32:10] pretty
[32:11] large pretty large subject to preach on
[32:15] because God just doesn't want us to be
[32:17] ignorant to to now remember ignorant is
[32:20] not stupid ignorant is without knowledge
[32:25] so he doesn't want us to be without
[32:27] knowledge God wants you and I to have a
[32:29] knowledge of the Gospel the scripture of
[32:33] the life most of all amen that you
[32:37] should not be ignorant how that our
[32:39] fathers were under the cloud and all
[32:42] passed through the sea and were all
[32:44] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[32:47] the sea and did all eat the same
[32:50] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[32:53] same spiritual drink for they drank of
[32:56] that spiritual rock that f followed them
[32:59] and that rock was Christ Heavenly Father
[33:02] we ask you to bless this service this
[33:04] evening for the needs of each and every
[33:06] one that is here and for those who are
[33:08] not here tonight father we just ask for
[33:11] your presence Lord strengthen us I pray
[33:14] in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may
[33:16] be seated now as we look at
[33:19] this it's it's interesting because this
[33:23] kind of actually has a parallel going
[33:26] back to Cain and Abel because Cain and
[33:28] Abel were both uh set at the same house
[33:31] under the same headship and one had
[33:35] Revelation and one had uh a knowledge
[33:39] but was not Revelation and so it starts
[33:42] off with the same spiritual or religious
[33:45] origin and um here's Christ right in
[33:48] their midst and some saw him and some
[33:52] didn't some left Egypt under law and
[33:56] even though it wasn't really preached in
[33:58] that day it wasn't really the aspect
[34:00] that was presented but some left Egypt
[34:03] under the law and some left Egypt under
[34:08] grace in other words under the blessing
[34:11] of God and so as we'll see how God is
[34:15] working he he is has the same patterns
[34:18] right brother brandham clarified that
[34:20] for us so we don't have to Jumble our
[34:22] thoughts around that God has patterns
[34:24] that he repeats and it's there that he
[34:27] the same yesterday today and forever so
[34:29] these patterns it it was once God's
[34:32] original thought it is still his
[34:34] original thought and so you think about
[34:37] how incredible that is because God's
[34:39] thoughts uh covered a generation that
[34:42] walked everywhere they went or maybe
[34:44] rode a donkey or a camel uh and uh that
[34:47] uh come all the way down to us in the
[34:49] age that we're in a jet and God's
[34:53] thoughts covered every drop of that he
[34:55] he looked at so it was there Christ
[34:58] right in their midst and um you know
[35:00] it's interesting how the gospel is
[35:02] because it is different from Individual
[35:06] to individual we have sit here tonight
[35:09] each one of us hearing the same uh
[35:11] message reading the same scripture and
[35:14] because of who we are and and nothing to
[35:17] be ashamed of there uh of who we are we
[35:21] we receive this differently we have a
[35:24] different teachings and sometimes we
[35:26] think what we think or believe what we
[35:28] believe because of good solid teaching
[35:31] sometimes it comes from incomplete
[35:33] teaching so if we have incomplete
[35:35] teaching that it is there that that will
[35:38] infect our thinking how we live our life
[35:41] how these things would be if you live
[35:43] under a Grace Grace type of a Ministry
[35:45] you know God understands God understands
[35:48] and God does understand but we don't
[35:51] want to take Grace into disgrace and so
[35:54] it's there that we have these different
[35:55] teachings complete or incomplete and uh
[35:58] we we receive things in a different
[36:01] fashion what I think is so beautiful is
[36:04] when God comes and he anoints the
[36:06] ministry to speak on something that he's
[36:08] already anointing the people in that
[36:11] very same pattern those same scriptures
[36:14] those same thoughts and that's what's
[36:15] really incredible because God is then
[36:18] showing that he is working on all sides
[36:21] of the equation it's not just a man
[36:24] standing here preaching his thoughts or
[36:26] what he thinks it should be for the
[36:27] moment but God moving and and then
[36:30] you'll find out many times that while
[36:32] that is going on maybe thousands of
[36:35] miles or even another continent they're
[36:37] preaching the same exact things and
[36:39] that's how wonderful our God is we have
[36:43] different desires now when I say
[36:45] different desires here my brother and
[36:47] sister I'm not talking about in this
[36:49] case right now desires of the flesh
[36:51] desires of leoda but we have different
[36:53] desires just as brother Isaac shared you
[36:56] know with sister St sitting there in the
[36:59] congregation she wanted that baby so bad
[37:02] that she decided that she needed to
[37:05] contribute her desire so strong that she
[37:08] started to put herself into that when as
[37:11] it comes back brother Brown you just
[37:13] need to believe what God said because
[37:15] God said it amen and here's the word I
[37:18] like that thank you brother Isaac
[37:20] because we have thus saith the Lord
[37:22] today my brother and sister and we we
[37:25] don't necessarily have to have a man in
[37:26] the land there's no not going to be
[37:28] another major prophet come and we don't
[37:30] need to look for that because everything
[37:33] that he spoke we have amen not even just
[37:37] in in the biblical sense but also in the
[37:40] message everything that was spoke it was
[37:42] there and you know you think about this
[37:44] I remember one time I was preaching in a
[37:46] place and I I I spoke on a certain
[37:49] subject and the brother afterwards
[37:51] wasn't really being critical but he he
[37:53] come and he says well well you preached
[37:55] on that and I figured out during during
[37:57] the service you know what he was doing
[37:59] uh I figured out during the service
[38:00] brother brandham never preached on
[38:03] that well I challenge you to go study
[38:05] the message and you'll realize just how
[38:08] small a portion of the Bible the prophet
[38:12] actually focused
[38:14] on there's so much of the Bible he never
[38:17] even touched
[38:20] because he gave you the key yeah to open
[38:23] it up amen so he didn't have to come
[38:26] open it and laid it on the table before
[38:29] us he gave us the scriptures gave us the
[38:31] Revelation gave us the key that we can
[38:34] unlock it and whether we unlock it or
[38:36] not is now our responsibility it won't
[38:39] fall back on anyone else won't fall back
[38:41] on the prophet so it's there we have
[38:44] different desires we have different
[38:45] expectations we come my brother and
[38:47] sister and realize that in the religious
[38:50] world today there there are those that
[38:53] come to church because that is their
[38:55] social life that is that is the the
[38:57] realm of their friend circle is in the
[39:00] church and you know they're there many
[39:02] times I I was reading a a little
[39:04] business article and this man's talking
[39:06] about how to he was an insurance agent
[39:08] Brother David and he was talking about
[39:10] how to expand your deal and he said
[39:12] church is a great
[39:14] place well that's why I go to church I
[39:17] want to I want to network with everybody
[39:19] I I want to do you know sounds like a
[39:21] recipe but not a very good one and so
[39:25] you know there's a lot of expectation on
[39:27] that and let me go back into the
[39:30] scripture cuz we don't want to be here
[39:31] too long tonight uh so he he's talking
[39:34] about that and he's saying look they
[39:36] were all in the same position baptized
[39:39] and they ate spiritual meat and they
[39:42] drank of the spiritual drink and so then
[39:45] it comes down that verse 5 says but with
[39:48] many of them God was not well pleased
[39:50] for they were overthrown in the
[39:53] wilderness so having all of that uh uh
[39:57] uh you know that they experienced there
[39:59] being baptized and eating the spiritual
[40:02] meat and the spiritual drink obviously
[40:05] did not keep them from being
[40:08] overthrown boy it sounds like today
[40:11] right amen America still claims to be
[40:14] predominantly America uh a Christian
[40:17] Nation but but there's not a lot of
[40:20] evidence of it many are there in the
[40:23] church overthrown as it were and um so
[40:27] you look at that they they started off
[40:29] good but they weren't well pleased for
[40:32] they were overthrown now these things
[40:34] were our
[40:36] examples see this is not just placed in
[40:38] scripture to to scare us or threaten us
[40:41] or or you know whatever but but it's
[40:44] here to give us an example that uh one
[40:47] we here we shouldn't intent should not
[40:50] lust after evil things as they losted
[40:53] neither be idolators now what's an
[40:55] idolator
[40:57] that's someone that has something
[40:58] between them and
[41:00] God so don't find and don't have
[41:03] anything or allow anything to come
[41:05] between you and God it is written the
[41:07] people sat down to eat and drink and
[41:09] Rose up to play that probably was at
[41:12] church neither let us commit fornication
[41:15] as some committed and fell in one day 3
[41:18] and
[41:18] 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as
[41:23] some of them also tempted and were
[41:25] destroyed of serpents
[41:27] neither murmur ye oh my brother and
[41:31] sister some of this we'd say I would
[41:33] never
[41:35] do not going to go out here and sin like
[41:39] that but
[41:41] murmur oh my we've almost got a PhD in
[41:46] murmur you see how slippery Satan is he
[41:49] come in that we we get this and we look
[41:51] at all what we think are so negative but
[41:54] he's got murmuring right here amongst
[41:56] these things things listed in the word
[41:59] that we should not do amen my some of
[42:03] them murmured and were destroyed of the
[42:06] Destroyer now all these things happened
[42:08] unto them for in samples or example and
[42:12] they were written for our
[42:14] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[42:17] world are
[42:18] come so this is not talking about a
[42:20] different
[42:22] generation it's upon us who the ends of
[42:25] the world has come it's talking speaking
[42:27] bringing this scripture right here right
[42:30] down today to you and I because this is
[42:33] the time this is the place and we need
[42:36] to Market that all of these Spirits have
[42:38] overtaken all of these Spirits are
[42:41] present we battle against every one of
[42:43] these Spirits oh no I'm a Christian I
[42:45] have no problem with that come on lying
[42:48] is also a sin so we find that we have
[42:51] these issues in this day but God said
[42:53] I'm going to give you an example that
[42:55] you can uh come and it's written for our
[42:58] admonition amen whom the end of the
[43:01] Earth you might say is Upon Our
[43:04] shoulders
[43:06] yeah that we are weighted wherefore let
[43:09] him that thinketh he standed take heed
[43:11] lest he fall now the scripture tells us
[43:14] not to think more highly of ourselves
[43:16] than we ought I'm such a fine Christian
[43:19] I'm such a fine I'm I'm such to this I'm
[43:21] such don't mistake that for being the
[43:24] fact that you need to confess that you
[43:26] are an overcome
[43:28] you need to confess that you are
[43:29] victorious in Jesus Christ so don't be
[43:32] silent on those things thinking that
[43:34] you're becoming he and high minded by
[43:36] declaring that you believe God has made
[43:38] you an overcomer amen God did make you
[43:41] an overcomer and you do have a victory
[43:44] in the battle so stand on that but
[43:47] remember as it is that it was Christ in
[43:50] you amen there's a thing we always need
[43:53] to keep balancing is it's Christ in us
[43:56] we we can't do it oursel and the moment
[43:58] we think we can do it ourself we are
[44:00] headed for the
[44:03] fall and now we'll get down to where
[44:06] we'll really draw our thought from verse
[44:09] 13 there hath no temptation taken you
[44:13] but such as is common to
[44:17] man
[44:19] wow think about
[44:22] it every battle you have God looked down
[44:25] and said that's real common
[44:28] you know the common cold the common yeah
[44:31] just real
[44:34] common but God is faithful can we say
[44:37] Amen who will not suffer you to be
[44:39] tempted above that ye are able amen my
[44:44] we've had some fiery trials in our lives
[44:46] we had times that we just felt like
[44:48] utter failure and in that feeling of
[44:52] utter failure God is telling you I'm not
[44:55] even going to tempt you more than you
[44:57] can withstand more than you're able to
[45:00] overcome and come out of now I I think
[45:03] we could all just take a moment and
[45:05] pause and think about times in where our
[45:07] life when we thought we were literally
[45:09] at The Bitter End and it was just too
[45:11] much and I am done I can't go no further
[45:14] and God says no there was still a margin
[45:16] of error there because I would not put
[45:18] more on you than you could handle oh my
[45:22] you know what that says I'll make
[45:23] another sermon out of that it says you
[45:25] can actually handle a lot more more than
[45:27] you think you can handle and a
[45:29] limitating factor there is this here the
[45:32] Battleground in the mind is the limiting
[45:35] factor and when we would realize that
[45:37] we're not fighting a battle in the mind
[45:39] in the whole overall picture but it is a
[45:42] battle for your soul it's a battle for
[45:44] your position it's actually the real
[45:46] battle my brother and sister is not
[45:48] against Satan as we often view it but it
[45:51] is against the fact that he is trying to
[45:53] keep you from rightly claiming your
[45:55] inheritance
[45:57] my some people have fight a lot harder
[45:59] for a natural inheritance than they
[46:01] would for a spiritual one Lord help us
[46:04] Amen to be able to come but he says you
[46:06] know what but with the Temptation also
[46:09] he makes a way of Escape that you'll be
[46:12] able to Bear it oh thank you Lord thank
[46:16] you Lord now I've met those that say
[46:19] that uh serving God is too
[46:23] hard I've known some men Through the
[46:25] Ages since I was a young man they quit
[46:30] serving the lord not leaving a message
[46:32] but just quit serving God because they
[46:35] said it was too
[46:38] hard as though serving Satan was
[46:43] easy think about this I actually believe
[46:46] serving Satan is actually
[46:48] harder than serving God because Satan
[46:52] takes his toll in entirely different
[46:55] fashion people say when I was a serving
[46:57] God I just had so many mind
[47:00] battles but yet now they're caught up in
[47:02] all kinds of things we won't go down the
[47:04] list in their life that they're torn and
[47:07] pulled this way and pulled that way and
[47:09] you know just all these issues and and
[47:11] they they believe that's simpler you
[47:13] talk about Satan being very clever to
[47:15] anoint in a fashion my brother and
[47:18] sister you know uh it's there you know
[47:21] one time I was giving blood or having
[47:23] blood taken and I I made a comment the a
[47:26] young lady really really scrubed my arm
[47:28] and I said I I guess um I guess uh you
[47:31] really want to make sure there's no no
[47:34] bugs or nothing there and she says uh no
[47:38] actually it was a distraction I looked
[47:39] down she already had the needle
[47:41] in you see sometimes what we think is
[47:44] something a certain way is nothing more
[47:47] than Satan coming distracting us because
[47:50] we tend to focus that you know I never
[47:52] wanted to be a p pickpocket but I
[47:54] studied a little bit and do you know the
[47:56] pp Pockets you know I mean hey why not
[47:58] you know something to look at but but
[48:00] you'll find that pickpockets thrive on
[48:05] distraction and so you know I I know a
[48:07] brother was in Mexico City uh and uh it
[48:10] was riding the train and and uh this man
[48:13] kept driving his knee against the side
[48:16] of his leg and it annoyed him so much
[48:19] and he but he didn't speak any Spanish
[48:21] and and it just annoyed him so much and
[48:23] the man just kept kind of pushing up
[48:25] against him and then he gets off the
[48:27] subway and reaches and his wallet's gone
[48:30] you see that's Satan he's here in the
[48:33] distraction to steal in fact the
[48:36] scripture says he kills Steals and
[48:39] destroys and that sounds like a lot of
[48:41] work that's right because to serve God
[48:44] we don't have to climb over any promise
[48:47] of Satan so there it is but you know
[48:51] that greatest battle ever fought is
[48:53] there now Hebrews 11 and 6 it says but
[48:57] without faith it is impossible to please
[48:59] him for he that cometh to God must
[49:02] believe that he is and that he is a
[49:05] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[49:09] him one of the problems we have my
[49:11] brother and sister is people today don't
[49:13] feel like uh my life is too busy my job
[49:17] demands too much my family demands too
[49:19] much all of this and we don't really
[49:21] have time to diligently seek God my
[49:24] brother and sister I think we ought to
[49:26] stop and real evaluate that and we have
[49:29] time to diligently seek God and he
[49:32] promised that he would give us
[49:34] everything else so while we're trying to
[49:37] accomplish on one side I don't have time
[49:39] my job demands my family demands and
[49:41] blah blah blah he says seek ye first the
[49:44] kingdom of God and all of the rest of
[49:47] this will be added there's a promise of
[49:49] God we can live on that promise cuz he
[49:52] won't fail but if we are here trying to
[49:55] take care of all the other first we'll
[49:58] have
[50:00] problems amen now let's look at
[50:03] this Temptations common to man I'll be a
[50:06] little blunt this more this evening
[50:08] Saints these Temptations they're talking
[50:11] about in in previous scripture there
[50:14] that are common to man are just that we
[50:17] won't go down through the list but they
[50:18] are just that there won't be a man alive
[50:21] I'll be just this blunt there won't be a
[50:23] man alive that doesn't look at a woman
[50:25] at some time in his
[50:28] life might not even be in his heart no
[50:31] desire no nothing Satan anoints that you
[50:34] might say that you walked right into the
[50:36] fog
[50:38] bank and you say Lord forgive me as the
[50:41] prophet said now if you look at the
[50:42] wording how brother brandham put that he
[50:44] put that cross on the mirror of his car
[50:48] he didn't put it on the deacon's car the
[50:50] assistant pastor's car or the leoty of
[50:52] the church he put it on his car that
[50:54] should tell you something amen so it's
[50:57] common to
[50:59] man but we don't want to embrace what is
[51:01] common to man but you see serve the Lord
[51:05] or not these Temptations are present
[51:06] it's here in the world we live in today
[51:09] and many in the wilderness they went out
[51:11] there as they left Egypt there they
[51:13] thought oh praise God God's answering
[51:15] his promise to us they got out in the
[51:17] wilderness they got
[51:19] overthrown but many is not
[51:22] all right that's right and we live in
[51:26] the same kind of world this is a
[51:28] Wilderness of
[51:29] sin and many will fall but not all amen
[51:35] so it's there my brother and sister we
[51:37] don't look at this and say oh my
[51:38] goodness why are you talking about this
[51:40] it's kind of negative it's kind of hard
[51:42] to do no we ought to face it face to
[51:45] face we ought to look at this and say
[51:46] you know what there are temptations that
[51:48] are common to humanity that we are
[51:51] warned about here in the scripture look
[51:55] out for this this is not who you are and
[51:58] you can defend by the word of God
[52:01] against this and so it is there we look
[52:04] at verse 6 and verse 11 it says that
[52:07] these things were given example in
[52:09] samples to us and so it's there my
[52:11] brother and sister we can take the
[52:13] example in its negative context or its
[52:16] positive context it doesn't really
[52:17] matter but it shows us that God has
[52:21] promised to provide a way of Escape
[52:24] regardless when they were in the
[52:26] wilderness of sin just like our
[52:28] Wilderness of sin they were there there
[52:30] were shortcomings they were failures oh
[52:32] I'm talking about the leadership
[52:35] am and God still made a way of Escape
[52:38] for them and allowed them to go forward
[52:41] not under a cloud of condemnation but to
[52:44] be able to go forward with confidence
[52:46] they were doing what God wanted them to
[52:47] do not confidence in the flesh but
[52:50] confidence in the word amen so it was
[52:53] there that we recognize some fall some
[52:55] overcome
[52:57] I want to ask you tonight what are
[53:00] you there's a time we ought to be able
[53:02] to say to ourselves I am an
[53:04] overcomer the position I'm going to
[53:07] claim today which will affect my life it
[53:10] may not affect your Eternal
[53:12] destination but it will affect your
[53:18] life I read a story once about a man in
[53:21] a drunken fight thought he killed a man
[53:24] ran away hid changed his name spent like
[53:27] 28 years
[53:29] running finally he decided that he his
[53:32] mother was dying is actually what Drew
[53:33] him back home no communication nothing
[53:37] ran and hid for 28 years comes back home
[53:41] somebody told the sheriff that he was
[53:43] back the sheriff shows up he's like oh
[53:46] well I ran 28 years for nothing they're
[53:48] going to catch me and the sheriff comes
[53:51] and says man I've missed you so much
[53:53] where have you been and he's like like
[53:56] you're not here to arrest me for so and
[53:58] so's death you didn't do
[54:01] that he said no I did I was there no no
[54:06] it was after you did this and this that
[54:10] this person killed
[54:12] him see he
[54:16] ran and hid from his
[54:19] reality that's why God is peeling back
[54:21] the layers of our onion tonight no
[54:23] matter what it is small or large he's
[54:26] peeling it back so we can face the
[54:28] reality of who we are in Jesus Christ we
[54:31] can run we can run we can run and we can
[54:34] say I'm guilty I did this I'm guilty I'm
[54:37] guilty I'm guilty and God says you never
[54:40] did it in the first place and so we can
[54:43] be caught up in our own realm of guilt
[54:46] and our own condemnation and not even be
[54:49] charged by the almighty God the only
[54:52] judge that matters is our Lord Jesus
[54:55] Christ and he says I don't even hold it
[54:57] against you but Satan would like us to
[55:00] think
[55:00] so right amen so verse 12 wherefore let
[55:05] him thinketh he uh standeth take heed
[55:08] lest he fall no temptation taketh you
[55:10] but is common to man but God is faithful
[55:13] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[55:15] above that ye are able I want you to
[55:19] think about that in our everyday life
[55:21] Saints everything that we face today the
[55:24] prophet of God says the real believer
[55:27] doesn't want to do it in the first place
[55:29] but Satan tricks them amen and God comes
[55:33] along and lays it in the word and said
[55:36] I'm not going to lay anything on you but
[55:39] what you will be able to Bear
[55:42] it amen what do we do
[55:45] now trust oursel no or trust
[55:50] God see he says I I won't put it on you
[55:54] that's right we know the thought we have
[55:56] thought we know the Deeds that we have
[55:58] done we know the things of our life past
[56:01] and
[56:02] present and God says I knew it before
[56:04] you ever did it and I still say you
[56:07] never did it in the first place see God
[56:10] wants us to understand Saints of what we
[56:14] are
[56:15] able my you know there's so many stories
[56:18] that are so
[56:20] incredible of of different events
[56:22] through time that show what the ability
[56:26] of of humanity and the flesh is far
[56:29] beyond what man thinks he can do and we
[56:31] see just in natural disasters and things
[56:34] that happen how people rise up and how
[56:37] they're able to just perform above and
[56:39] beyond what is imaginable and and that's
[56:42] just in the natural now please take and
[56:44] bring that over into the spiritual and
[56:47] God has placed in you the seed Gene of
[56:50] our Lord Jesus Christ who himself while
[56:54] embracing the cross
[56:57] went to the Cross knowing anointed that
[57:00] he would rise from that cross because he
[57:02] said so
[57:04] yeah he didn't rise because of any other
[57:07] reason than he said he would redeem you
[57:11] and I he didn't have any point to prove
[57:15] he didn't have to show off to the devil
[57:18] he didn't have to spill one drop of
[57:21] blood to redeem
[57:24] us didn't have to but he says this is
[57:27] how it starts started right here at the
[57:31] Garden that little
[57:33] lamb actually to be correct it started
[57:36] before the foundation of the
[57:41] world and that lamb was brought forth
[57:43] and placed it was placed to Abraham and
[57:47] it's coming right down because that lamb
[57:49] is present
[57:52] today those
[57:54] soldiers if you be this Son of God why
[57:57] don't you just come down off that cross
[58:00] you know if Jesus had gave into that
[58:03] Temptation 10,000 angels would have just
[58:07] cleared a swath across that country and
[58:10] no one would understood even what
[58:11] happened it would just been
[58:15] Annihilation but he knew what he was
[58:17] able I Lay My Life down and I raise it
[58:23] up again amen he knew he was able to do
[58:27] that now if Christ is in you which is
[58:30] what the word says amen then we have the
[58:33] ability tonight to lay our lives down
[58:36] and it isn't always in the fashion we
[58:38] think it might be my brother and sister
[58:40] that we have a grudge or bitterness or
[58:43] something between us and somebody that
[58:45] we literally could lay our life down and
[58:47] take the blame and walk away and say I
[58:49] know it's not my fault but Lord I just I
[58:52] take it am amen that's a nature a spirit
[58:55] of Christ
[58:56] being manifested in us because you see
[58:59] the minute that they abused our Lord
[59:01] Jesus Christ if we had a common human
[59:03] reaction there he would then had a
[59:05] grudge and a retribution against them
[59:08] but he said Lord they don't even know
[59:10] what they do that's right now I I'm not
[59:12] asking you to give an answer might shock
[59:14] me but how many of you actually say
[59:18] that forgive them Lord they don't know
[59:23] what they're even doing
[59:27] and you say but but but no
[59:30] no it might be to their benefit but I
[59:34] can assure you it's to yours that's
[59:36] right that when you lay that down that's
[59:39] right brother Lonnie Jenkins many years
[59:41] ago and I have some of that little
[59:44] research he sent me years ago I don't
[59:45] know where it would be hopefully I still
[59:48] have it the effect of bitterness on
[59:51] people's
[59:52] Health it was actually startling they
[59:55] did all kinds of of research of of
[59:57] bringing up uh old hurts why they have
[1:00:00] all kinds of heart monitor brain monitor
[1:00:01] all this stuff and you know people
[1:00:03] something happened 25 30 years ago and
[1:00:06] it's talked about it and their heart
[1:00:08] rate goes up their breathing changes all
[1:00:10] of these brain waves change to realize
[1:00:13] that unrepented or Unforgiven is there
[1:00:17] to to just destroy people and Satan just
[1:00:20] pushes the button any of you had your
[1:00:22] button pushed yes sir and you know what
[1:00:25] they say button
[1:00:26] pushing it's usually someone Close to
[1:00:29] You y
[1:00:32] wow usually someone
[1:00:38] [Laughter]
[1:00:41] close oh my
[1:00:43] [Laughter]
[1:00:47] goodness sometimes you see things from
[1:00:50] the pulpits you really wish you had
[1:00:53] saw so he's
[1:00:57] declaring there's nothing that you're
[1:00:59] not able to
[1:01:01] handle let's take that thought into our
[1:01:03] next trial our next tribulation our next
[1:01:06] struggle I can handle this do I like
[1:01:10] what someone said what someone did I do
[1:01:12] I like the circumstances do I like the
[1:01:15] fact the wheels fell off the wagon no
[1:01:17] but you know what I'm going to be better
[1:01:19] off if I just allow this to go away to
[1:01:23] be put down now I want to hurry along
[1:01:25] here as the eagle stirreth up her nest
[1:01:28] brother Bram says God is not afraid to
[1:01:31] put you on a
[1:01:34] trial my oh my now you must have
[1:01:42] confidence to just volunteer yourself to
[1:01:44] be put into a
[1:01:46] trial and God must have confidence when
[1:01:49] he takes you and put you in the trial
[1:01:53] that's right God's not specialized Ing
[1:01:56] and giving points to the devil we got to
[1:01:58] play fair we're in the age of everything
[1:02:01] must be fair no my brother and
[1:02:04] sister when he said to Job Satan said oh
[1:02:07] yeah you got him all hedged up said make
[1:02:09] him break that hedge around him and I'll
[1:02:12] make him curse you to your
[1:02:14] face and he said he's in your hands oh
[1:02:18] my God is not afraid to put his Eagles
[1:02:22] to a flight test he's not afraid he's
[1:02:27] depending on you right why isn't that
[1:02:30] something we usually feel like we're
[1:02:32] completely dependent on God and we are
[1:02:35] but God also has made this plan in such
[1:02:38] a fashion and has such faith in his word
[1:02:41] that is in you that you will stand to
[1:02:45] the test because he's already said he'll
[1:02:47] not let anything more than you can
[1:02:49] handle be placed upon you and he knows
[1:02:52] that you will stand with that word amen
[1:02:55] not a afraid to put his Eagles to a
[1:02:57] flight test he's not afraid he's
[1:02:58] depending on you he wasn't afraid to put
[1:03:01] Abraham to a flight test he was
[1:03:04] depending on him now my brother and
[1:03:07] sister if Abraham had not had a voice I
[1:03:11] mean had an ear that could hear the
[1:03:13] voice he would have killed his
[1:03:16] son but he was so in tune with God and
[1:03:19] that's what God knew that he was so in
[1:03:22] tune that when the knife began to plunge
[1:03:25] and God said stop he knew the knife
[1:03:28] would
[1:03:29] stop and so it was there was that an
[1:03:32] ultimate test for Abraham I'm sure
[1:03:35] Abraham would not have readily said Lord
[1:03:38] just take me out there and um I'll I'll
[1:03:40] slay my son for a
[1:03:43] test no but I'll tell you what Abraham
[1:03:46] did have he had such confidence in God
[1:03:48] that promise that God had given on Isaac
[1:03:51] he knew that if he took his life that
[1:03:53] God would raise it back up again
[1:03:57] he didn't promise to have a son named
[1:04:00] whatever Bob or Joe or whatever but
[1:04:02] Isaac was the promised son to fulfill
[1:04:06] this Redemption and Abraham had enough
[1:04:09] faith in God to go and he said whatever
[1:04:12] it is amen now my brother and sister
[1:04:14] I've always marveled how that you could
[1:04:16] have a Ram stuck in a Thicket and no one
[1:04:18] can see it
[1:04:21] until their
[1:04:23] eyes are opened yeah
[1:04:28] could I say something real bold sounds a
[1:04:30] little
[1:04:31] judgy we're sitting here
[1:04:34] tonight and our eyes are not fully
[1:04:37] open there's many promises of God that
[1:04:40] have been promised to us and we're
[1:04:43] looking at those as though they are a
[1:04:44] far
[1:04:46] off well when we get enough faith for a
[1:04:48] Rapture when we get enough faith for
[1:04:50] this and we get enough of this my
[1:04:52] brother and sister it's a matter of our
[1:04:53] eyes being opened and the eyes were open
[1:04:56] because of complete trust amen the world
[1:05:00] calls it blind trust when you have that
[1:05:02] much faith in something so call it blind
[1:05:04] trust I want to be blinded to everything
[1:05:07] but the promise I want to be blinded to
[1:05:10] every circumstance but what God has
[1:05:12] promised to you and I amen let that be
[1:05:15] blind trust but I'm telling you you
[1:05:17] can't have one foot in the world and one
[1:05:19] foot in the in the gospel and expect to
[1:05:21] get anywhere because they're going two
[1:05:23] different directions amen
[1:05:26] he wasn't afraid to put Abraham to a
[1:05:27] flight test he was depending on he was
[1:05:29] not afraid to put Abraham's seed to a
[1:05:31] flight test because he's depending on
[1:05:34] you amen oh my brother and sister in
[1:05:37] Hebrews 11 those all those Patriarchs
[1:05:40] all those Saints all those men of the
[1:05:41] Gospel they are waiting for our
[1:05:45] manifestation they are depending on that
[1:05:49] they will not be made complete without
[1:05:52] you and I and we are here tonight
[1:05:56] sometimes wondering Lord are we gaining
[1:05:58] ground or am I alone on this sometimes
[1:06:00] feel like I don't think I'm growing
[1:06:02] spiritually at all but let me just come
[1:06:05] back to what I mentioned on Sunday my
[1:06:07] brother and sister there's a mantle that
[1:06:08] has fallen been promised to fall in this
[1:06:11] day and it won't be a mantle that's a
[1:06:13] big blanket draping dragging on the
[1:06:15] ground it will be a perfect fit it will
[1:06:18] be the word coming down tailored for you
[1:06:21] and I amen but when I say tailored for
[1:06:23] you and I it's actually God molding you
[1:06:26] and I to the word not the word to you
[1:06:28] and I and we need to have enough
[1:06:30] confidence in God that when he goes to
[1:06:32] trimming away or if he goes to padding
[1:06:35] us up a little bit that we believe that
[1:06:38] is of god that it's the word that is
[1:06:40] changing our life opening our
[1:06:42] understanding giving us Revelation and
[1:06:44] correcting false understandings from the
[1:06:47] past and this is God working my brother
[1:06:49] and sister because we have to come to
[1:06:52] that place where we are the perfect
[1:06:54] representation of the word we can't add
[1:06:57] to it we can't take away from it we have
[1:07:00] to be the absolute perfect fit of the
[1:07:04] mantle of the word in this hour did that
[1:07:07] all make sense amen now look he's not
[1:07:11] fearful for
[1:07:13] us why are we
[1:07:17] fearful that fearful spirit that gets on
[1:07:20] us is not of God that's right and we
[1:07:23] need to come to a point
[1:07:26] recognize this acknowledge this stand on
[1:07:29] this that that fearful Spirit wherever
[1:07:32] it comes from now I'm not talking about
[1:07:34] the natural one where you know you're
[1:07:36] standing on the peak of a roof and and
[1:07:38] uh you know somebody says jump off and a
[1:07:40] little fear comes upon you and Common
[1:07:42] Sense and fear sometimes travel together
[1:07:44] in the natural I'm not talking about
[1:07:46] that kind amen but to be
[1:07:51] literally
[1:07:52] unable inability to grasp the
[1:07:56] word and apply it that's the kind of
[1:07:59] fear that Satan's putting on
[1:08:02] people dealing with people my brother
[1:08:04] and sister they're like well I I I'm
[1:08:06] just Bound by fear I can't do this I
[1:08:09] can't do this I'm just bound I just
[1:08:11] can't do this well my brother and sister
[1:08:13] the word said you can do all things
[1:08:15] through Christ Jesus amen so you don't
[1:08:17] have to worry about stepping out and
[1:08:19] finding that you're in a false promise
[1:08:22] cuz God said that he would not let you
[1:08:24] be C up in a false
[1:08:27] Doctrine now when I say that I'm not
[1:08:29] saying for little season many people
[1:08:32] have did that but if you're a son or
[1:08:33] daughter of God he will bring you back
[1:08:35] out of that it's his promise
[1:08:42] amen if he's not fearful for
[1:08:45] us why should we be fearful for
[1:08:49] ourselves
[1:08:56] now I'm not talking
[1:09:00] about being
[1:09:02] ridiculous if you take everything you
[1:09:05] own and invest it
[1:09:08] in a gold mining expedition to the
[1:09:11] Amazon
[1:09:13] forest you probably should be
[1:09:17] afraid that's
[1:09:20] foolish we're not talking about that
[1:09:22] kind of
[1:09:24] stuff L Circle back to this the word is
[1:09:28] right here amen what is stopping us from
[1:09:32] taking the word amen and doing exactly
[1:09:36] what the word said we should
[1:09:39] do what is stopping
[1:09:44] us
[1:09:48] fear misrepresenting a quote been men
[1:09:51] misrepresented to
[1:09:53] you what are my favorite quotes I have
[1:09:56] to
[1:09:57] admit is a prophet of God saying keep
[1:10:00] planting your
[1:10:03] potatoes get this a brother ins sincere
[1:10:06] asking did Brother brandham mean that
[1:10:14] literally I don't know whether to slap
[1:10:16] him or slap
[1:10:18] me the prophet's talking in a spiritual
[1:10:22] context and now Brothers wanting to know
[1:10:24] if every every real believer is going to
[1:10:26] have potatoes in their
[1:10:28] backyard come on let's use a little
[1:10:30] sense here amen it is not about potatoes
[1:10:35] he's talking if I'm allowed to use that
[1:10:38] word about a
[1:10:39] concept a
[1:10:41] principle apply the principle and when
[1:10:45] we apply the principle we'll get up
[1:10:47] every morning and water the
[1:10:51] word and we'll keep the weeds out of the
[1:10:53] word
[1:10:55] and then we'll keep the weeds out of our
[1:10:57] life because the word is keeping the
[1:10:59] weeds out of our life and the word is
[1:11:03] watering us and we're watering the word
[1:11:05] we're praising God and God is blessing
[1:11:08] us for those
[1:11:09] Praises that's a win-win
[1:11:12] situation we praise God and God blesses
[1:11:15] us amen my in the world my brother and
[1:11:18] sister they would say oh that's like a
[1:11:20] Ponzi scheme or something like that you
[1:11:22] know promising something else God's
[1:11:24] promises are not empty and they're never
[1:11:27] have an end to them it's continually
[1:11:29] going God is continually blessing his
[1:11:32] bride and continually protecting his
[1:11:35] bride he's continually taking care of
[1:11:37] everything in our life you say but I've
[1:11:40] had hard time so
[1:11:45] job he's depending on
[1:11:48] us oh and let's not leave this one part
[1:11:52] out the way of Escape is is already made
[1:11:56] yes sir we're not sitting here waiting
[1:11:59] that's exactly right oh
[1:12:02] my
[1:12:04] waiting do you know there's a phrase
[1:12:06] that has to do with inheritance and old
[1:12:10] people and greedy
[1:12:14] children and these are the people that
[1:12:16] don't really care about their parents or
[1:12:19] grandparents and they are sitting around
[1:12:21] waiting for them to die so they can
[1:12:23] collect their inheritance and they call
[1:12:24] them
[1:12:28] waiters they're
[1:12:31] waiters can't even write a postcard to a
[1:12:34] mom and dad or a grandparent or
[1:12:36] something they're just waiting for the
[1:12:38] reading of the will I'm wondering are we
[1:12:50] waiters say that out loud Brother
[1:12:53] David look louder little louder come on
[1:12:56] the will has already been read thank you
[1:13:00] thank you we are already in our adoption
[1:13:04] we are already in our
[1:13:07] inheritance you see my brother and
[1:13:08] sister we're not waiters amen we're
[1:13:10] living in Heavenly places right here and
[1:13:12] if we're not we need to get down get
[1:13:14] serious with God so that we can live in
[1:13:17] Heavenly places cuz that's what's been
[1:13:19] promised to us amen
[1:13:26] now I'll go ahead John 14
[1:13:29] 1-6 let not your heart be troubled you
[1:13:32] believe in God believe also in me in my
[1:13:34] father's house are many mansions and if
[1:13:36] it were not so I would have told you I
[1:13:39] go to prepare a place for you if I go
[1:13:41] and prepare a place for you I will come
[1:13:44] again and receive you un myself these
[1:13:47] sound like
[1:13:48] promises these sound like
[1:13:52] commitments that where I am
[1:13:55] there ye may be
[1:13:58] also and whether I go ye know now we'll
[1:14:02] see a bigger picture and we'll touch on
[1:14:03] it but I want to remember that whether I
[1:14:06] go ye know and the way ye know and
[1:14:10] Thomas said unto him Lord we know not
[1:14:12] whether thou goest and how can we know
[1:14:15] the
[1:14:16] way now we'll stop shy at verse six but
[1:14:19] look at this my brother and sister how
[1:14:21] when we have a wrong interpretation of
[1:14:24] the word we're looking at the word and
[1:14:27] not comparing it and getting it lined up
[1:14:30] because Jesus has already answered these
[1:14:33] questions to the apostles to the
[1:14:36] disciples all of this down through time
[1:14:38] he's already answered this but the
[1:14:40] humanity comes and says this is too
[1:14:43] simple there's got to be we don't even
[1:14:45] know the way and Jesus has already been
[1:14:48] showing them the way showing them uh the
[1:14:52] proper you know way of of um uh I lost
[1:14:55] my thought right there um uh the already
[1:14:58] the provided place of worship he's
[1:15:00] already showed that to them but they got
[1:15:03] caught up in another thought trying to
[1:15:04] interpret this just like there you know
[1:15:07] which one is the
[1:15:08] greatest we're in the presence of Jesus
[1:15:12] Christ amen and our deepest
[1:15:14] concern is you telling us which
[1:15:18] one is the
[1:15:21] greatest no wonder Jesus rebuked them
[1:15:25] they totally missed the whole
[1:15:29] picture they totally missed the the
[1:15:32] whole thing because they were caught or
[1:15:35] captured in a carnal position and they
[1:15:38] couldn't get out of the carnal position
[1:15:40] because they were not Discerning of the
[1:15:43] spirit if they had discerned the spirit
[1:15:45] they would have realized but Jesus comes
[1:15:48] and says unto
[1:15:49] him I am the way amen we don't even know
[1:15:54] the way Jesus Jesus Jesus I I I'm sorry
[1:15:57] I I Lord I don't mean to be but I I
[1:16:00] wonder if Jesus didn't like do that
[1:16:07] like I'm the
[1:16:09] way did you guys missed this in the
[1:16:11] whole equation I'm the
[1:16:15] way the truth and the life and no man
[1:16:19] cometh into the father but by
[1:16:22] me I want to ask you are we able
[1:16:27] the word says we're able we need to be
[1:16:30] saying we're able you see my brother and
[1:16:33] sister it all comes apart if we sit down
[1:16:36] in that position I'm not
[1:16:39] able I'm not able the whole plan of God
[1:16:43] doesn't put us
[1:16:45] out but we're what's muddying up the
[1:16:49] water we're what when we're
[1:16:52] confessing uh it's a thought to preach
[1:16:54] on future I don't know exactly but um
[1:16:59] Jesus meets our brothers on the way to
[1:17:03] emus and he comes
[1:17:06] up what manner of
[1:17:09] conversation is this that ye are sad in
[1:17:14] the
[1:17:18] way when that struck me studying a
[1:17:21] certain thought future sermon I thought
[1:17:25] Lord Don't Judge Me by my
[1:17:29] conversations I believe this word I
[1:17:32] believe you're here I believe the
[1:17:34] seventh seal is open Christ is in me
[1:17:37] amen but my conversation doesn't always
[1:17:41] project
[1:17:43] that this is wrong that is wrong if he
[1:17:46] was still living if he had done this if
[1:17:48] he hadn't did this and why did this come
[1:17:50] cuz we've come to not
[1:17:52] now why did why didn't the prophet live
[1:17:54] to to be 10 whatever it would be 119
[1:17:57] years and why didn't he somehow able to
[1:18:00] answer everyone's question so he could
[1:18:02] just show all of us to do this well my
[1:18:05] brother and sister you know we say if
[1:18:07] the Lord Jesus was here tonight he could
[1:18:09] do nothing more for you that's right
[1:18:11] then what he's already
[1:18:13] done this might sound like heresy to
[1:18:16] some if the prophet was here tonight
[1:18:19] right he couldn't do any more for us
[1:18:23] than he already he
[1:18:26] did he's given us the key right and we
[1:18:29] are able to take that
[1:18:33] key and open the
[1:18:35] word and live that word oh Lord help us
[1:18:39] that the devil trying to tell us we're
[1:18:41] not able we are more than able amen
[1:18:45] hallelujah amen it's already been
[1:18:49] provided to us in the mark of the beast
[1:18:56] brother Alex if you're playing the piano
[1:18:58] I guess you are please
[1:19:00] come Mark of the Beast brother brandom
[1:19:02] this is a prayer and I'm closing on this
[1:19:06] right
[1:19:06] here brother Bram says our heavenly
[1:19:09] father we approach thy Throne thy great
[1:19:13] Throne of Mercy In The Name Of The Lord
[1:19:15] Jesus our savior we approach that way
[1:19:18] because he told us to come thus and we
[1:19:21] would receive what we asked for
[1:19:25] what this is is putting you and
[1:19:29] I in our correct
[1:19:32] position to
[1:19:34] worship God's provided Place God's
[1:19:37] provided
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:41] way that we come thus and would receive
[1:19:45] what we ask for and we're so glad to
[1:19:48] know that we can rest in our hearts upon
[1:19:50] that
[1:19:52] assurance that what you say you're a
[1:19:54] able to perform for tonight we feel that
[1:19:59] we are by faith Abraham's seed and
[1:20:03] anything contrary to God's word we act
[1:20:06] as though it was not amen realize just
[1:20:11] how important that is yes sir anything
[1:20:14] contrary we don't even give it place
[1:20:16] that's exactly right
[1:20:21] amen because God has said truth and we
[1:20:24] believe he has the truth and he is
[1:20:28] truth you know we would never
[1:20:31] allow a statue of Baal in our
[1:20:36] sanctuary and then just throw a sheet
[1:20:38] over it and act as though it wasn't
[1:20:43] so see God wants us to cast out every
[1:20:47] doubt every fear every spot of
[1:20:52] unbelief and then stand so firm on the
[1:20:55] word and when times get tough remind
[1:20:59] ourselves by the word we are able amen
[1:21:02] we are able God bless you tonight
