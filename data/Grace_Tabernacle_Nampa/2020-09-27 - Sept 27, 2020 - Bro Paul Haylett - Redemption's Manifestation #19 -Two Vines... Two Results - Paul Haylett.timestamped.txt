[31:14] can we say amen to that all glory to his
[31:18] beautiful
[31:18] precious name amen we also want to
[31:21] remember
[31:22] uh brother sergey and his family brother
[31:25] alex i think they're not feeling well
[31:27] today also
[31:28] so a little fin in numbers this morning
[31:30] but just pray that
[31:32] god would just touch each and every one
[31:34] who is not here
[31:36] amen just look around you and if you
[31:39] see someone you normally see in and you
[31:41] don't see them this morning just say a
[31:43] prayer for them amen
[31:45] hallelujah well just good to be in the
[31:48] house of the lord today
[31:50] amen uh thanking the lord for his grace
[31:53] and mercy
[31:54] now i want to just bring forth uh in
[31:56] this thought
[31:58] i often mention uh uh
[32:01] certain things and there are things that
[32:03] resonate with me
[32:04] as we have saw through the years uh you
[32:08] know saints i guess i'd put it this way
[32:09] you know i didn't always serve the lord
[32:11] with all my heart mind body and soul
[32:14] but i was not by god's grace completely
[32:16] oblivious to what was happening in the
[32:18] world around me
[32:20] and you get to see these things and the
[32:21] prophet of god told us
[32:23] that through the ages those spirits
[32:25] don't die right so
[32:26] we're dealing with every spirit right
[32:29] now
[32:30] that's been on the face of the earth
[32:32] through the ages
[32:33] amen and some people say well now you
[32:36] know are we more special than they were
[32:38] you know in that first church age the
[32:40] day of pentecost
[32:41] no but my brother and sister there's
[32:43] been more demons released upon the earth
[32:45] but that word was magnified in the bride
[32:49] of this day amen so it's coming to life
[32:51] christ himself is a full manifestation
[32:54] is here in us
[32:56] we need to have that kind of confidence
[32:57] doesn't matter what's
[32:59] out there we were already predestinated
[33:02] and enabled amen to overcome that
[33:06] you know i just you know i'm not much of
[33:08] a technology person
[33:10] but we recently had bought a machine a
[33:13] harvester and
[33:14] and it wouldn't do certain things and it
[33:16] was beyond us
[33:18] and uh you know we finally had to call a
[33:21] technician and he come and hooked his
[33:23] laptop to it
[33:24] and i hope you see this uh point i'm
[33:26] trying to make
[33:28] and i'm i'm all concerned it's like they
[33:30] sold us something and it's supposed to
[33:32] have this
[33:32] and it doesn't it isn't there and as the
[33:36] technician put his laptop into the port
[33:38] and tied all into it
[33:40] he said oh he said it's all there
[33:44] it just hasn't been enabled
[33:48] and i thought thank you lord right there
[33:51] it's all the
[33:52] prophet of god said everything we need
[33:53] to make the rapture
[33:55] amen he's enabling us amen he's turning
[33:58] it on in the right
[34:00] season now spiritually we could say well
[34:03] why didn't these revelations you know
[34:05] why didn't we see
[34:06] it uh why well there's always a time and
[34:09] a season according to the word
[34:11] and uh god is enabling amen and we have
[34:14] to be able to grasp
[34:15] the basic principles right the word says
[34:18] that we
[34:18] move from the milk amen we don't
[34:21] instantly go from milk
[34:23] to meat right along the way mom starts
[34:26] throwing carrots in the blender
[34:28] and whatever else and we move from milk
[34:30] to carrots to
[34:32] peas to mashed potatoes to whatever
[34:35] and then one day praise the lord praise
[34:38] the lord we grow up
[34:39] to eat meat amen and nothing against
[34:43] vegetarians they just don't know what
[34:44] they're missing
[34:45] amen so anyway um
[34:48] yes so let's remember each and every one
[34:51] in prayer today and and you know many
[34:53] needs in the body of believers around
[34:55] the world many things uh
[34:57] uh happening you know in south america
[34:59] they're they're just
[35:00] right now going through the rampages of
[35:02] this virus
[35:04] uh many of the believers um uh
[35:07] and south america their jobs are not
[35:09] necessarily lost
[35:10] it's just not happening you can show up
[35:13] to work but if the boss says hey we're
[35:14] not selling nothing
[35:16] i can't pay you then it's the same as
[35:19] being unemployed
[35:20] so we just lift up the bride around the
[35:23] world
[35:24] amen and around the world includes the
[35:26] next county over
[35:27] the next state over et cetera amen next
[35:31] street over
[35:32] amen let's just stand as we go into the
[35:33] word today
[35:35] amen now i want today and i just want
[35:37] you to understand i believe
[35:38] very strongly that we have to
[35:42] uh come and deal as
[35:45] ministry we have to make you aware
[35:48] of how spirits and how they are and the
[35:51] foundation that they have
[35:53] and saints i maybe i have a little
[35:55] complex on this because people think i'm
[35:57] just battering
[35:58] something to death but if we don't
[36:01] if we are not aware
[36:04] if we are not aware and walk blindly
[36:07] into it
[36:08] god will protect us but it doesn't mean
[36:10] you won't get beat up along the way
[36:12] but by god's grace if we can be aware
[36:16] of the two spirits this is the prophet
[36:18] speaking the
[36:19] two spirits in the framework of the
[36:21] church so if you're aware of that
[36:23] already then you won't be blindsided
[36:26] because you won't go around now i'm not
[36:28] advocating we go around all nervous
[36:31] oh what if i'm going to be deceived what
[36:33] if i'm going to be deceived
[36:34] no the holy ghost in you will discern
[36:38] the spirits but the way god designed us
[36:41] amen he enlightens us to recognize the
[36:43] spirit
[36:44] amen so god will put a hedge around us
[36:46] just like he had around job
[36:48] but what if god no wait it's not what if
[36:51] god has enough confidence in you
[36:56] to open the hedge and say go ahead satan
[37:03] no wait god loves me he's going to keep
[37:05] the hedge closed not me
[37:07] no sir he's got so much confidence in
[37:09] you
[37:11] that he's going to say let the trials of
[37:12] life come let the discouragements let
[37:14] all of this
[37:15] come they'll stand you know i don't mean
[37:18] to focus this
[37:19] concerning myself but i just the lord
[37:22] brought this back to me this morning had
[37:23] a little tear sitting in my office
[37:25] there was a time in my life that uh
[37:29] it was god moving me right and sometimes
[37:31] god has to use pressure
[37:32] to move us amen uh uh and i
[37:36] i can tell you in the natural life
[37:38] sometimes it takes exceeding pressure to
[37:40] make things move
[37:42] but i remember one time i was antelope
[37:44] hunting a friend of mine just sent me a
[37:46] picture of a beautiful antelope he just
[37:48] just harvested and uh he wanted me to
[37:51] see that and it reminded me took me back
[37:53] to a time
[37:55] when i was just struggling with whether
[37:57] the lord loved me or not and whether i
[37:59] was
[38:00] was even good enough to be a christian
[38:01] and i went antelope hunting over in the
[38:04] pacimilroy region
[38:05] uh by chalice and and uh this
[38:09] friend of mine had said hey i know where
[38:10] this huge antelope is
[38:12] and uh have permission to hunt on the
[38:14] property the morning we were supposed to
[38:16] go
[38:16] he says no i've decided i'm not going
[38:19] so it was this great blow to me and i
[38:23] i just was just struck i was like wow
[38:26] all this preparation and another young
[38:29] man that was there in the camp said hey
[38:31] i'll go with you paul and so we're
[38:32] driving down and we chose this little
[38:34] two track that went up into the mountain
[38:37] and we see this antelope and he's the
[38:39] one that's hanging in my
[38:40] my mud room right now and i thought
[38:44] oh i'm gonna do this and so i got out of
[38:46] the truck and i crawled and i crawled
[38:48] and i crawled and and then i got in this
[38:50] area that was desert cactus if you know
[38:52] what that is it's real
[38:53] fan grows on the ground if you're not
[38:55] paying attention you don't even realize
[38:57] it's got
[38:57] thousands of little quills and i got my
[39:00] forearms
[39:02] my chest was just poked full of holes
[39:05] and i took a shot at this antelope and i
[39:07] missed
[39:09] what i didn't account for was the fact
[39:11] that i was laying in a draw and the wind
[39:13] was blowing where the envelope was and
[39:14] my bullet
[39:15] hit four feet low and four feet in front
[39:17] of it
[39:18] and it turned and it ran out of sight
[39:24] now you say bill paul this is just
[39:27] carnal
[39:28] is it you see i put my head down and
[39:32] started crying
[39:35] and i said lord why is everything
[39:40] in my life going backwards
[39:43] well i can tell you right now why it was
[39:45] because i wasn't serving him
[39:48] he called me i wasn't doing my part you
[39:51] might say
[39:52] i put my head down and tears filled my
[39:55] eyes and i was like lord why
[39:57] now saints this might seem strange to
[39:59] you but i said lord if you just
[40:01] you just let me shoot that antelope i'd
[40:03] serve you
[40:05] sounds pretty phony doesn't it give me
[40:08] the antelope lord and i'll be a good
[40:10] christian
[40:11] but you see sometimes it resonates much
[40:13] deeper down in the heart
[40:17] i needed a sign you might say of god's
[40:20] favor at that moment in my life
[40:23] i needed something tangible that
[40:26] god heard my prayer you know that
[40:30] antelope ran just when i say ran out of
[40:32] sight that wasn't totally accurate he
[40:33] ran
[40:34] probably 150 yards did a u-turn
[40:37] ran right back stopped within 10 feet of
[40:40] where he was standing before
[40:43] and something in my brain says you know
[40:45] the wind's blowing you hit four feet in
[40:47] front of him and four feet low and
[40:49] i took my cross hairs and i put it four
[40:52] feet back and four feet up and pulled
[40:54] the trigger
[40:56] got me an antelope do you know god
[41:00] did not fail to remind me of my promise
[41:07] thank you lord sometimes we need to make
[41:09] a commitment
[41:10] sometimes some of us need to just get a
[41:12] hand or a heart up and say lord
[41:15] i'm making this vow to you i'm i'm
[41:18] making a commitment
[41:19] to you lord amen
[41:22] hallelujah well i got so many things but
[41:24] i'd just like you to repeat with me
[41:26] today my prayer makes a difference
[41:28] because i want that to come from your
[41:29] lips if you would today
[41:31] my prayers make a difference amen
[41:35] hallelujah we closed out last sunday on
[41:39] speaking about the white dog and black
[41:41] dog and i'd like to just turn into
[41:42] exodus
[41:43] the 20th chapter today once again we're
[41:46] still speaking on my little graph we
[41:48] haven't got away from that
[41:50] uh but there's just a lot that goes with
[41:52] each one of these things and
[41:54] we we have to deal my brother and sister
[41:56] we have on both sides you know sold out
[42:00] but you know it's in the middle ground
[42:03] is where the real warfare is at and even
[42:06] when you're sold out you know uh
[42:11] you know
[42:15] oftentimes saints the gospel is
[42:18] convincing enough but there has to be
[42:19] something deep
[42:20] you wonder i was asking the lord lord
[42:22] give me a tangible
[42:24] example of of the carnal
[42:27] with the spiritual bend and you know as
[42:30] paul was there
[42:31] in rome and he's speaking he said paul
[42:35] what was his name there the the
[42:38] ruler that paul was speaking to he tells
[42:42] him he says
[42:43] you've almost convinced me you know what
[42:46] i'm talking about
[42:47] it just my mind is just slipped on that
[42:50] you've
[42:50] almost convinced me
[42:54] see he was carnal man with a spiritual
[42:56] vein and it was right there
[42:58] so close you almost convinced me
[43:03] and on the other side saying sons and
[43:04] daughters of god can go through a valley
[43:06] so deep and so dark and so rough
[43:09] and that will come to a place that we
[43:11] literally could say the devil
[43:13] almost convinced us to quit
[43:16] but you see on those two sides there's
[43:19] not the issue
[43:21] amen now let's just look at this right
[43:23] here
[43:24] exodus the 20th chapter starting with
[43:26] verse 1
[43:28] and god spake all these words saying i
[43:30] am the lord
[43:31] thy god which have brought thee out of
[43:34] the land
[43:35] of egypt out of the house of bondage
[43:39] thou shall have no other gods before me
[43:42] now shall not make unto thee any graven
[43:44] image or any likeness of anything that
[43:47] is in heaven above
[43:48] or that is in the earth beneath or that
[43:51] is in the water
[43:52] under the earth thou shall not bow down
[43:55] thyself to them
[43:57] nor serve them for i the lord thy god
[44:01] am a jealous god visiting the iniquity
[44:05] of the fathers upon the children and to
[44:06] the
[44:07] third and fourth generation of them that
[44:10] hate me
[44:11] see we got to make sure we catch the
[44:13] quantifier there of them that hate me
[44:15] this does not apply to the bride of
[44:17] christ does not apply
[44:18] apply to those that are in love with
[44:20] jesus amen
[44:22] verse 6 and showing mercy unto thousands
[44:24] of them that love me
[44:25] and keep my commandments heavenly father
[44:28] we thank you for this day lord for your
[44:30] grace and your mercy
[44:31] ask for your guiding hand lord once
[44:34] again we bind every spirit of sickness
[44:36] lord that would be upon the saints in
[44:38] this body of believers
[44:40] lord we rebuke that we refuse to accept
[44:42] that
[44:43] box of rattlesnakes lord and we send it
[44:46] right back to the pits of hell
[44:48] where it come from lord there be those
[44:50] that have work in different situations
[44:52] father that have kept them from the
[44:54] house of god today
[44:55] we would ask lord that you would just
[44:57] touch them my own sister father with her
[45:00] uncertainty of her job situation just
[45:02] ask lord that you would just come
[45:04] be merciful to her lord merciful to the
[45:07] body of believers the bride of christ we
[45:09] pray
[45:10] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[45:13] be seated saints
[45:15] now as we're going to be here today like
[45:17] i said i just want to bring clarity
[45:19] we're actually going to do and i felt
[45:21] led to do this saints that it would just
[45:23] be clear
[45:24] why brother paul has uh such a
[45:27] a uh resistance to those false unities
[45:33] that would be brought
[45:34] into uh the body of believers you know
[45:37] that we
[45:37] we all need to love each other uh we got
[45:40] to do this this is a sign
[45:42] of our our love or our unity that we're
[45:45] christians because we do this
[45:47] and i believe those things will come to
[45:49] pass because they are the word of god
[45:51] and therefore they must come to pass
[45:53] but i just feel led of god to bring you
[45:55] through this little
[45:57] a passage that brings you around and
[45:59] shows you
[46:00] how that these spirits would come and
[46:02] the spirits of the ages
[46:04] would come and these spirits as the
[46:06] prophet of god would be in these
[46:07] services and he calls out
[46:08] a woman with cancer and then he calls
[46:12] out another one
[46:13] across the auditorium and he was
[46:16] able to recognize that because this
[46:18] spirit here
[46:19] which the holy ghost pointed out or
[46:21] called out that spirit that was on that
[46:24] individual the spirit of cancer
[46:25] was then crying out to other spirits for
[46:28] help
[46:29] amen and so they exposed both of them
[46:32] amen
[46:32] in their in their in their realm there
[46:35] and so as we look in the day that we're
[46:36] living in these spirits would like to
[46:38] come they like to
[46:40] to gang up as it were right and and uh
[46:43] because they know that they are no match
[46:45] uh for the presence of god
[46:47] amen when the holy spirit is present
[46:49] there the word describes that as a fire
[46:52] amen and it is not just a common fire
[46:55] but it is the
[46:56] most powerful fire there is a cleansing
[46:59] fire amen
[47:00] and so as you look at this you realize
[47:02] that as god is
[47:04] is working in the church in this day he
[47:07] said that he would expose my brother and
[47:09] sister everything
[47:10] that would be a hindrance or everything
[47:12] that would keep you from making a
[47:14] rapture
[47:14] now many times people they don't like
[47:17] that exposure they don't like
[47:18] you know the spirits being pointed out
[47:21] many times people if they feel they are
[47:23] right and i will not exclude myself from
[47:25] that
[47:26] we can become very very resistant
[47:29] to to a correction or being brought to
[47:33] us uh
[47:33] just in the natural things sometimes you
[47:35] know we we will be wrong
[47:38] come on saints you know i'm telling you
[47:40] the truth this morning we can be wrong
[47:42] and it just hurts us to admit it
[47:46] it hurts us i'm not talking about we're
[47:49] just like oh
[47:50] but i'm talking about hurts us it's
[47:53] all we can do to acknowledge that we are
[47:56] wrong
[47:57] amen it might be just as simple as some
[48:00] little natural carnal thing that doesn't
[48:02] matter
[48:02] amen but you know that is just like no i
[48:06] know i
[48:07] saw that on google the other day you're
[48:09] wrong and
[48:10] well maybe not everything on the
[48:11] internet is true my
[48:14] anyway you know you look at this but god
[48:16] working in such a way
[48:18] that he promised to you and i my brother
[48:20] and sister that the word being
[48:21] manifested or christ's coming
[48:23] and manifesting himself in you and i now
[48:26] when christ moves in the house
[48:30] hallelujah when christ moves in the
[48:33] house something else has to be moved out
[48:35] right he's not going to live in the
[48:37] clutter of laodicea
[48:39] amen so when he moves in he starts house
[48:41] cleaning
[48:42] and we might as well come on saints
[48:44] we're predestinated called of almighty
[48:46] god to serve him
[48:48] we might as well open the doors open the
[48:50] windows and start just chucking out
[48:52] everything he doesn't want in the house
[48:55] amen don't hide something in the crawl
[48:57] space or hide something in the attic
[48:59] amen
[49:00] just open the doors and the windows
[49:02] start chucking it out
[49:04] amen just let him move in amen let him
[49:07] claim it is his
[49:08] hey now i want to go right here into
[49:10] john the 14th chapter
[49:12] uh and just lay out just a little
[49:14] foundation of where we're going today
[49:16] philip saith unto him lord show us the
[49:19] father
[49:20] and it i never pronounce this word right
[49:22] suffices
[49:23] us yeah anyway something like that
[49:27] jesus saith in them have i been so long
[49:30] time
[49:30] with you grace tabernacle
[49:34] and yet hath thou not known me philip he
[49:37] that hath seen me hath seen the father
[49:40] how saith thou then show us the father
[49:44] believeth thou not that i am in the
[49:46] father and the father in me
[49:48] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[49:50] not of myself
[49:52] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[49:54] doeth the works
[49:56] amen believe me that i am in the father
[50:00] and the father in me
[50:02] or else believe me for the very work's
[50:05] sake so if you can't recognize it in the
[50:08] scripture
[50:09] then look at the life that the word
[50:13] is producing my brother and sister i'm
[50:16] telling you even today
[50:18] if we set aside our bible set aside our
[50:20] message books
[50:21] all we'd have to do if we just really
[50:23] cared amen
[50:24] would be to look at the life that is
[50:27] being produced
[50:28] what does the life point to
[50:32] amen and you could you could ship a lot
[50:34] of light
[50:35] on a lot of spirits by just simply
[50:37] looking
[50:38] at what they're trying to direct you to
[50:42] oh my i'm telling you my brother and
[50:44] sister i don't know you know the bride
[50:46] of christ
[50:47] said you know uh brother ram said the
[50:49] bride of christ wouldn't be shut down
[50:51] amen should go up
[50:52] hallelujah but there's going to come a
[50:54] time there'll be pressure
[50:56] amen we felt some pressure we felt just
[50:59] a little bit of pressure
[51:00] these last months you know with churches
[51:02] being shut down and
[51:03] issues and things happening and
[51:05] believers getting sick and
[51:07] some believers dying and where a lot of
[51:09] people are like all shook up i thought
[51:11] i thought this couldn't touch us the
[51:12] prophet of god said it couldn't touch us
[51:14] well let me just give you however you
[51:16] want to divide it up and
[51:17] you take the year the month the day the
[51:20] time
[51:20] and if god already ordained to call
[51:23] brother so-and-so home
[51:24] it doesn't matter if there's earthquakes
[51:26] or fires or
[51:28] there's this pandemic or whatever it is
[51:30] when god calls us home
[51:31] they can't keep us here amen so people
[51:34] are like well i thought believers
[51:36] couldn't get these kind of things
[51:37] that the holy spirit would keep them
[51:39] from it i'm sorry my brother and sister
[51:41] but god
[51:41] already had ordained on that day at that
[51:44] time that brother that sister
[51:46] would be promoted to glory don't get
[51:49] trying to connect this here on this
[51:51] carnal side of earth
[51:52] to the great plan of god oh this brother
[51:55] this sister had got covered and they
[51:56] went away
[51:57] my brother and sister if it hadn't been
[51:59] coveted it might have been the heart
[52:00] disease that they had
[52:02] or the lung issue they had or the kidney
[52:04] problem they had
[52:05] god knows amen as the brother donny has
[52:08] said before
[52:09] it don't do much good to ask god to
[52:11] bless your cheetos
[52:13] before you eat them cheetos or cheetos
[52:17] hallelujah lord turn these cheetos into
[52:19] good food
[52:21] come on saints amen so in our season
[52:24] when our time has come
[52:25] it's come but people get to the place
[52:28] that they
[52:28] they question well is the plan of god
[52:30] really working yes it is it's working
[52:32] perfectly
[52:34] amen no nuclear watch no swiss watch
[52:37] nothing keeps better time than the time
[52:38] of the plan of god
[52:40] amen oh hallelujah
[52:44] amen verily verily i say unto you he
[52:46] that believeth on me the works that i do
[52:49] shall he do also
[52:50] so this my brother and sister john 14 12
[52:54] could be used as a stereotypical
[52:57] defining moment of who the true believer
[53:00] is
[53:08] or not
[53:13] you see many believe if
[53:17] god sent a prophet and they acknowledge
[53:18] that
[53:21] but that's not what my bible says that's
[53:23] right
[53:24] he that believeth on me the works that i
[53:26] do shall he do also
[53:28] greater works than these shall he do
[53:30] because i go
[53:31] unto my father and whatsoever ye shall
[53:34] ask in my name
[53:36] that will i do that the father may be
[53:38] glorified in the son
[53:40] and if you shall ask anything in my name
[53:42] i will do it
[53:43] well hallelujah i think i need a big
[53:46] house in miami beach with a pool and a
[53:48] a rolls royce i can take you right to a
[53:52] story that i read where this couple
[53:55] read this scripture talk to their pastor
[53:57] got prayed for
[53:58] started confessing asking anything in
[54:00] god's name they said they prayed three
[54:02] four five
[54:03] six times a day for god to give them a
[54:05] mansion in miami beach
[54:07] and a rolls royce and there they were
[54:09] standing in front of their house in
[54:11] front of their rolls
[54:13] the scripture works but you see god
[54:15] could give that to the bride of christ
[54:17] saints
[54:18] and the reason you're not living in
[54:20] miami beach and driving a rolls royce
[54:22] is because the bride of christ would
[54:24] never abuse the word of god
[54:26] but god will honor his promise so you
[54:28] say well i wasn't god at all
[54:30] well it very well could have been my
[54:31] brother and sister because god will
[54:32] honor he will honor faith
[54:34] and those people believe they ask
[54:35] anything in god's name he would give it
[54:37] to them
[54:38] but i tell you what you and i want we
[54:40] don't want a rolls royce we don't want
[54:42] to live in miami beach
[54:43] we want the holy ghost we want the
[54:45] presence of almighty god
[54:46] we want to come and live in his presence
[54:50] now that's what changes us it's not a
[54:52] carnal possession of this life
[54:54] that motivates the bride of christ but
[54:56] it's him the bridegroom to be able to
[54:58] stand and say
[54:59] you know what i am the bride of jesus
[55:01] christ i am mrs
[55:03] jesus christ that's what stirs the heart
[55:06] of the true believer
[55:07] amen not what we have tangible things
[55:10] out here
[55:10] one of these days when a tidal tsunami
[55:12] storm or something
[55:14] hits miami beach their mansion will get
[55:16] destroyed and their car
[55:17] crushed and washed away my brother and
[55:20] sister it all of that stuff
[55:21] my brother and sister but the word shows
[55:23] us that what we're asking for
[55:25] is incorruptible oh hallelujah aren't
[55:28] you glad
[55:28] no care of this life no saying no
[55:31] circumstance of this life you know
[55:33] it won't change that amen hallelujah
[55:36] now here's kind of a scripture i want to
[55:38] get to right here verse 15.
[55:40] if you love me see now we're coming down
[55:43] to the qualifier who the believer is
[55:45] right if you love me keep my
[55:47] commandments amen
[55:49] oh because this is to those who love him
[55:51] right amen so if you love him you keep
[55:54] his commandments now remember
[55:55] i want to put this out make it very
[55:57] clear that jesus said he did not come to
[55:59] do away with the law but he come to
[56:01] magnify
[56:02] it amen so people are like no no that's
[56:04] the old covenant old testament old
[56:06] covenant
[56:07] that doesn't apply to us no i'm sorry it
[56:09] does apply jesus christ himself said
[56:11] i didn't get rid of it i come to magnify
[56:13] it
[56:14] now my brother and sister you and i both
[56:16] know that in a flesh
[56:17] we cannot live a life that you would say
[56:20] would be
[56:21] legal according to the mosaic law
[56:25] but the revelation of the love and grace
[56:28] of almighty god
[56:31] becomes revelation to us to realize that
[56:34] word right there is a road map
[56:37] but just like gps if you come and you
[56:40] make a little detour
[56:41] it tells you oh okay rerouting
[56:45] and it'll take you down and take you
[56:46] here and bring you right back on the
[56:47] same route again because you can't get
[56:49] there
[56:49] straight as a gate narrow is the way
[56:51] right we ought to say thank you lord
[56:54] otherwise it'd just be a lot of sloppy
[56:56] christians show up at heaven
[56:58] and here you are doing your best to live
[57:00] the word of god and all these sloppy
[57:02] christians get in
[57:03] wow you're not going to be happy about
[57:05] that why i could have lived sloppy no
[57:06] you weren't called to be sloppy
[57:08] you were called according to the word
[57:11] amen and that's what motivates you
[57:13] that's what moves you
[57:14] a lot of sloppy christians out there but
[57:16] we're not called to be sloppy christians
[57:18] hallelujah amen
[57:22] and i will pray the father and he shall
[57:23] give you another comforter which we know
[57:25] is the holy ghost then he may abide with
[57:27] you forever
[57:28] even the spirit of truth okay now we can
[57:30] start making these connections
[57:32] this spirit of truth my brother and
[57:33] sister is in the holy ghost
[57:35] so someone cannot have the holy ghost
[57:38] and live with the spirit of air
[57:41] amen they can't say well i've got the
[57:43] holy ghost just like you
[57:45] no no you see the holy ghost is the
[57:48] spirit of truth
[57:49] whom the world cannot receive because it
[57:52] seeth
[57:52] him not now is that seeing him as a
[57:55] spirit the holy ghost
[57:56] no we the holy ghost my brother and
[58:00] sister you professing that you have the
[58:01] holy ghost
[58:02] is christ in you identifying you with
[58:05] the word
[58:06] amen that's what where you can stand and
[58:08] say i believe i have the holy ghost
[58:10] hey man sister jerry shared a quote with
[58:12] me the other day real beautiful brother
[58:13] brown says now don't you go around
[58:15] saying you got the holy ghost
[58:16] it's the holy ghost has got you
[58:19] hallelujah so it's not for us to boast
[58:21] i've got the holy ghost
[58:23] no it's to come to that position that
[58:25] god identifies
[58:26] i've got you oh hallelujah i want to
[58:29] have that
[58:30] amen in his heart arms i feel
[58:34] protected amen not our arms around him
[58:39] his arms around us can you say amen to
[58:42] that
[58:43] hallelujah amen
[58:48] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[58:51] and shall be in you i will not leave you
[58:54] without the holy ghost
[58:56] amen i will not leave you comfortless
[58:59] i will come to you yet a little while
[59:02] and the world seeth me no more
[59:04] but ye see me because i live ye shall
[59:06] live also
[59:08] at that day you shall know that i am in
[59:10] my father
[59:11] and ye and me and i in you
[59:15] he that hath my commandments and keepeth
[59:17] them he it is that
[59:19] loveth me and he that loveth me shall be
[59:21] loved of my father
[59:22] and i will love him and will manifest
[59:25] myself
[59:27] to him you see we can't come to the
[59:29] place and say we have god without
[59:31] manifesting the nature the life
[59:33] the attributes of god they have to come
[59:36] out
[59:36] they will come out right now brother
[59:38] brown talks about how you know that if
[59:40] he had the spirit of john dillinger
[59:42] amen he wouldn't be an artist
[59:46] right and if you have the spirit of
[59:49] who did to use the artist michelangelo
[59:52] and then
[59:53] michelangelo as far as we know didn't
[59:54] take a machine gun in rob banks
[59:57] right so the very nature when god
[1:00:00] manifests himself to him meaning you and
[1:00:02] i
[1:00:03] then when that's manifested it's going
[1:00:05] to bring forth
[1:00:06] that nature of god it can't bring forth
[1:00:10] a cuckober
[1:00:11] my brother and sister it's got to bring
[1:00:13] forth a grain of wheat
[1:00:14] amen so beautiful as we look at those
[1:00:18] things
[1:00:18] now as we do this i want to just uh
[1:00:22] go forward and here in this point tying
[1:00:25] together manifest himself
[1:00:26] myself to him now remember we're talking
[1:00:29] about the white dog and the black dog
[1:00:31] and i i'm reiterating just a little bit
[1:00:34] from this last sunday
[1:00:35] but you see the chief my brother and
[1:00:37] sister was in a great battle right it
[1:00:38] was which dog he fed the most
[1:00:40] that was what one dominated as it were
[1:00:43] in his world
[1:00:44] now we uh know that when it comes down
[1:00:47] there really isn't
[1:00:48] regardless of the fact that there is a
[1:00:50] make believer uh
[1:00:51] in reality the make believer is an
[1:00:53] unbeliever right because he doesn't have
[1:00:56] the genuine if he had the genuine he
[1:00:58] would be a believer right just so
[1:01:00] what brother branham said about the
[1:01:01] devil uh you know
[1:01:03] said if he come in under the blood he
[1:01:05] would be your brother
[1:01:06] right so he can't get under the blood
[1:01:09] without the effect of the blood taking
[1:01:11] place even upon satan so
[1:01:13] you look at that and realize now that
[1:01:15] these two spirits in the framework of
[1:01:16] the church right and i i guess i kind of
[1:01:19] skipped over my title today
[1:01:21] the two vines bring two results amen and
[1:01:24] so as you look at this and realize that
[1:01:26] that that uh those vines cannot bring
[1:01:29] forth the exact
[1:01:30] same result uh uh they
[1:01:33] they have to bring forth uh different
[1:01:36] and uh so
[1:01:37] you and i i'll just be blunt today i
[1:01:39] hope i'm not too blunt for
[1:01:40] anybody's taste but my brother and
[1:01:42] sister as we move forward in time and
[1:01:45] god has always tested with time
[1:01:48] you can't go forward feeding equal
[1:01:50] portions
[1:01:52] there'll come a time that you will have
[1:01:54] to feed the white dog more or the black
[1:01:57] dog more
[1:01:58] and we speak of it as though it is our
[1:02:00] decision because god has granted to us
[1:02:02] free moral agency
[1:02:07] predestination is not i'm going to throw
[1:02:09] a lasso on you and drag you
[1:02:11] into heaven predestination was god
[1:02:14] acknowledging he saw what
[1:02:15] decision you would make amen
[1:02:18] so we can't go forward feeding these
[1:02:22] equal portions right
[1:02:23] straddling the fence as it were living
[1:02:25] in the world trying to live for god
[1:02:27] uh you know in those framework
[1:02:30] uh but we can make some emphatic
[1:02:32] statements and i'll just make this one
[1:02:34] brief
[1:02:35] this world and its attractions can never
[1:02:38] lead you to god
[1:02:40] i don't care if you're talking religious
[1:02:42] spirits i don't care what kind of
[1:02:44] issues that you are talking or how good
[1:02:46] it sounds or how good it looks
[1:02:48] or how it feels to you the world and its
[1:02:50] attractions can never lead you to god
[1:02:53] amen the world of sin though i made this
[1:02:55] statement to you last sunday
[1:02:57] i want to just touch on it again the
[1:02:59] world of sin
[1:03:01] will magnify the grace of god to you
[1:03:05] when you see just how vile and wicked
[1:03:07] this world is and you see
[1:03:08] what god is doing in your life
[1:03:11] acknowledging maybe this morning it
[1:03:12] would be good if we lift our hand and
[1:03:14] acknowledge and say i know god called me
[1:03:16] hey i know that i am a child of god
[1:03:20] amen not a question in my mind in my
[1:03:23] heart or soul
[1:03:24] of who i am and so the very wickedness
[1:03:27] of sin in this world
[1:03:29] should magnify the grace of god to you
[1:03:32] and i
[1:03:33] to know that we would be that if it was
[1:03:36] not for his grace and
[1:03:38] i say thank you this morning lord for
[1:03:40] your grace and your mercy
[1:03:42] amen hallelujah people go oh well you're
[1:03:45] predestinated to be the bride
[1:03:47] remember now my brother and sister as
[1:03:49] the prophet explains predestination to
[1:03:50] us
[1:03:51] that's not god forcing you that's god
[1:03:54] acknowledging
[1:03:56] who you are hallelujah because if it was
[1:03:59] god forcing then it would just
[1:04:01] be like russian roulette okay we're in
[1:04:04] church
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:08] fourth person in the fifth row one two
[1:04:11] three four five one two three
[1:04:14] four sorry about the rest of you
[1:04:19] it's not how it works god recorded in
[1:04:22] the lamb's book of life
[1:04:24] because he knew the seed that was in
[1:04:27] you would produce the life of
[1:04:30] christ hallelujah
[1:04:36] otherwise we would be called puppets
[1:04:42] a lot of ways we can go from there i
[1:04:44] have to leave that one alone
[1:04:46] amen now look the prophet of god told us
[1:04:49] several different places in different
[1:04:51] ways but it all comes out the same
[1:04:53] that the holy spirit cannot and
[1:04:56] will not lead you away from the word
[1:05:00] so when you hear people saints i'm
[1:05:02] speaking pretty plain
[1:05:03] forgive me but this is my job is to make
[1:05:05] a real plain to you that you recognize
[1:05:07] these things
[1:05:08] so when people would say now the lord
[1:05:10] told me
[1:05:11] to go do this and it's contrary to the
[1:05:14] word
[1:05:15] that was not the holy spirit there is no
[1:05:18] way no matter
[1:05:19] fancy words you do it or how many times
[1:05:21] it's repeated
[1:05:22] it will not change the fact that the
[1:05:24] holy spirit will
[1:05:26] not lead us away from the word
[1:05:30] oh my but i'll tell you what maybe the
[1:05:33] side we should be looking at not
[1:05:35] negative we
[1:05:36] should be looking at the positive church
[1:05:38] young people
[1:05:39] old people everybody in between amen
[1:05:42] when god
[1:05:42] starts to move in your life don't
[1:05:45] back away when the holy spirit comes
[1:05:48] down starts to touch
[1:05:50] you don't back away
[1:05:53] amen don't get afraid and say well i've
[1:05:55] never felt that presence i remember many
[1:05:57] years ago
[1:05:58] dealing with a young person and god come
[1:05:59] down right in the service start dealing
[1:06:01] with them
[1:06:01] and you could just see like the deer in
[1:06:03] the headlights look this young person
[1:06:05] was just scared to death shaking like a
[1:06:06] leaf almost got up and walked out or ran
[1:06:09] out of the church
[1:06:10] but stayed and then later they said you
[1:06:12] know brother paul i
[1:06:13] i didn't know what what was happening i
[1:06:15] didn't understand
[1:06:17] and you know my brother and sister the
[1:06:18] holy spirit had come down that young
[1:06:20] person was not
[1:06:21] uh they were not familiar with the
[1:06:24] moving of the holy spirit
[1:06:25] and you know they got nervous amen they
[1:06:28] started to shy away from that because
[1:06:30] they didn't understand what was
[1:06:32] happening
[1:06:32] and if satan can get us to the place
[1:06:34] that we move away when the presence of
[1:06:36] god comes and we shy
[1:06:38] away from it we get all nervous we got
[1:06:41] to go to the restroom we got to go here
[1:06:42] we got to go to there
[1:06:43] we got to do whatever or we take our
[1:06:45] mind somewhere else my brother and
[1:06:47] sister
[1:06:48] that's what satan wants to do that
[1:06:50] nervous spirit is not of god
[1:06:52] god brings peace we sang of it this
[1:06:54] morning he wants us just to
[1:06:56] not shy away he wants us to just settle
[1:06:58] down
[1:06:59] god you know convince yourself god's got
[1:07:02] our best interest in mind
[1:07:04] hallelujah oh my brother and sister
[1:07:06] reminds me of a sermon that brother
[1:07:08] chris preached here several years ago
[1:07:10] about the bush pilot
[1:07:11] amen you know you'd be thinking okay
[1:07:13] we're flying down a canyon and the fog
[1:07:15] has settled in
[1:07:17] and we can't see where we're going you
[1:07:19] know it wouldn't it makes sense to
[1:07:20] to to fly up higher higher and higher
[1:07:23] but look the cares of life and the
[1:07:25] struggle that we're in
[1:07:26] we can't fly high enough on this earth
[1:07:29] to get out of that you can't fly over
[1:07:31] your problems
[1:07:32] but by leadership amen by having a
[1:07:35] familiar
[1:07:36] understanding of where you're at and the
[1:07:38] path that you're walking as brother
[1:07:40] chris shared that story
[1:07:41] and that bush pilot he just knew and he
[1:07:43] could fly up that valley because he knew
[1:07:46] where he was at
[1:07:47] and he had experienced that before and
[1:07:49] he was able to safely fly that
[1:07:52] my brother and sister he could as
[1:07:53] brother chris shared that story
[1:07:55] he couldn't turn around in the canyon it
[1:07:57] was too small
[1:07:58] so we got nowhere to turn around and go
[1:08:00] back to we got well this is just too
[1:08:02] hard i'm going to go back to where i was
[1:08:04] and maybe another day in my life i'll
[1:08:06] try this again
[1:08:08] no what you got to do is get in the word
[1:08:10] let the holy spirit come down
[1:08:11] he said i will lead you and i will guide
[1:08:14] you what you got to do is trust him
[1:08:17] you're going to just stop and say okay
[1:08:18] i'm living in laodicea
[1:08:20] it's the narrowest darkest canyon i've
[1:08:22] ever been in my life
[1:08:24] it's a wicked place but he said he'd
[1:08:26] lead me and i'm just going to let him
[1:08:27] lead me
[1:08:28] hallelujah but people get nervous they
[1:08:30] start to shy away from that
[1:08:32] i just want to say a word to the parents
[1:08:33] this morning i just felt led this
[1:08:35] morning
[1:08:36] once again just to do this and you
[1:08:38] create an atmosphere
[1:08:40] you create a place where your children
[1:08:42] know the presence of god
[1:08:43] don't leave them to find out when
[1:08:45] they're 25 or 35 or 40 years old
[1:08:48] who god is amen show them
[1:08:51] bring an atmosphere in the home
[1:08:53] atmosphere
[1:08:54] bring the atmosphere to church that your
[1:08:56] children would know the presence of god
[1:08:59] young people growing up in this message
[1:09:01] and they say well i grew up in the
[1:09:03] church and i never ever felt the
[1:09:05] presence of god
[1:09:07] oh i can tell you my brother and sister
[1:09:09] they either grew up in a really messed
[1:09:10] up church
[1:09:11] or no one ever made them aware
[1:09:14] of the moving of the spirit of god
[1:09:18] a lot of conflicting emotions as
[1:09:20] preachers brother david brother chris
[1:09:22] will testify of this you're going to see
[1:09:23] the conflicting emotions
[1:09:24] you're going to see the reactions of
[1:09:26] people sometimes you can see them
[1:09:28] but they just burst out now i want that
[1:09:31] i want you lord
[1:09:32] sometimes they draw back into their
[1:09:34] shell sometimes they look around like i
[1:09:36] don't understand
[1:09:38] my brother and sister it's our job as a
[1:09:40] ministry
[1:09:41] as parents to create the atmosphere that
[1:09:44] our children
[1:09:45] know god is real because if we won't do
[1:09:49] it the world will handily show them
[1:09:51] there's no such thing as a god and
[1:09:53] whatever you want to do to make you feel
[1:09:54] good
[1:09:55] is fair game oh hallelujah
[1:09:58] come on i hope i'm not too blunt to you
[1:10:00] but it's our job
[1:10:02] amen it's our job to promote the word
[1:10:06] promote praise promote worse
[1:10:09] my brother and sister i'm telling you
[1:10:11] there's nothing stirs my heart more
[1:10:13] than to see young people worship the
[1:10:15] lord
[1:10:16] when they start to grasp that to realize
[1:10:18] i you know i don't got to be
[1:10:20] you know 25 years old and have children
[1:10:23] and a job and and just really
[1:10:25] no you can be 10 years old and know that
[1:10:28] presence of god know he's real
[1:10:30] and be here to acknowledge it and say
[1:10:32] lord i know you're real
[1:10:34] i'll lift my hands i'll lift my voice
[1:10:37] oh but my brother and sister i'm sorry
[1:10:39] if this peels a hide off of you
[1:10:41] but it was sitting church and we won't
[1:10:43] sing we won't worship we won't lift a
[1:10:45] hand we won't do nothing
[1:10:47] what kind of signal are we sending to to
[1:10:49] our family to
[1:10:50] not besides what we're sending to god i
[1:10:54] mark my attendance card today
[1:10:57] well i'll tell you what i'd rather mark
[1:10:58] a praise card
[1:11:00] as it were than an attendance card i'd
[1:11:03] rather that god would hear
[1:11:05] amen and my prayers and my worship would
[1:11:07] come as a sweet savor
[1:11:08] before the throne of almighty god that
[1:11:10] he'd go my son and my daughter they're
[1:11:13] worshiping today that's just not a
[1:11:16] church thing
[1:11:19] if you save it for church you sure
[1:11:21] missed out
[1:11:23] amen hallelujah proverbs 22
[1:11:27] 6 says train up a child
[1:11:32] want to ask us parents i know my
[1:11:35] shortcomings
[1:11:36] by the grace of god my daughters
[1:11:39] serve the lord i've got a son that acted
[1:11:41] too much like his dad he's not serving
[1:11:43] god
[1:11:44] i remind him son are you going to do
[1:11:45] just what i did and go all this way
[1:11:48] and then look back and say man i sure
[1:11:49] wished i done something different
[1:11:54] come on let's train up our children
[1:11:56] let's break through the barrier
[1:11:58] these these uh these complexes these
[1:12:02] things that we're like well bro paul i'm
[1:12:03] not vocal
[1:12:04] well hallelujah i don't know what side
[1:12:06] of heaven you're going to hang out in
[1:12:09] i honestly i i don't mean to sound
[1:12:12] facetious but i don't think there
[1:12:14] there's any going to be any signs in
[1:12:16] heaven quiet
[1:12:22] on but you see what happens is
[1:12:25] this process is all bringing about a
[1:12:27] separation
[1:12:28] now we're actually going to get in our
[1:12:29] sermon that my time's all burnt up
[1:12:32] hallelujah we'll just roar right through
[1:12:34] this by god's grace
[1:12:36] so you look at this now we understand
[1:12:38] that abraham and lot were having trouble
[1:12:40] they would have a water hole they'd
[1:12:42] fight over whose sheep got to drink in
[1:12:43] the water hole
[1:12:44] and the land to graze it all of these
[1:12:46] different things now you have to
[1:12:47] understand the world agriculture just
[1:12:49] because you're a son or daughter of god
[1:12:50] doesn't mean
[1:12:51] it rains where you want it to rain and
[1:12:53] when it rains where you want it to rain
[1:12:55] amen so you know you're still we're
[1:12:57] still subject to the things of this life
[1:12:59] amen now god's given us power over those
[1:13:01] things and we have seen prayer stop rain
[1:13:03] amen we've seen a prophet of god stand
[1:13:05] on a mountain we make emphasis that on a
[1:13:07] mountain and rebuke a storm and
[1:13:09] and the whole world bracing for several
[1:13:12] feet of snow
[1:13:13] and a few flurries and the clouds blew
[1:13:15] across and then sunshine come out
[1:13:18] so you look at this now my brother and
[1:13:19] sister so in genesis 13
[1:13:21] 9 it says not the whole land before thee
[1:13:23] separate thy cell
[1:13:24] you see god wants separators not mixers
[1:13:27] amen
[1:13:28] i pray thee from me if thou will take
[1:13:31] the left hand then i will go to the
[1:13:32] right or if thou depart to the right
[1:13:34] hand then i'll go to the left
[1:13:36] and loft lifted up his eyes and beheld
[1:13:38] the plane of jordan
[1:13:39] that was well watered man this is a
[1:13:41] place to grow vegetables and all kinds
[1:13:43] of stuff man what a place to have a farm
[1:13:49] well watered everywhere
[1:13:52] before the lord destroyed sodom and
[1:13:53] gomorrah even as the garden of the lord
[1:13:55] like the land of egypt as thou comest
[1:13:57] into zaur
[1:13:58] then lot chose him all the plane of
[1:14:01] jordan and lot journeyed east and they
[1:14:03] separated themselves
[1:14:04] one from the other abram dwelled in the
[1:14:06] land of canaan lot dwelt in the cities
[1:14:08] of the plain and pitched his tent
[1:14:10] towards sodom so now of all this 360.
[1:14:14] come on saints this is what i was
[1:14:15] talking about you can kind of watch you
[1:14:17] you don't have to do all this sometimes
[1:14:18] you can just watch
[1:14:20] of all the 360
[1:14:23] that lot had to pitch his tent
[1:14:27] he pitched it towards sodom
[1:14:33] i want you to think about it in your own
[1:14:35] life
[1:14:37] we have got the free moral agency to
[1:14:39] choose 360.
[1:14:42] pitch it towards anything you want to
[1:14:43] pitch it towards
[1:14:45] hallelujah lot had to pitch it towards
[1:14:48] sodom
[1:14:52] but the men of sodom were wicked my
[1:14:54] goodness i want to just move down there
[1:14:55] a bunch of months of heathens i want to
[1:14:57] just move into an environment
[1:14:59] you know where god's not even present we
[1:15:00] don't see nothing happening
[1:15:02] and i'm just going to go down there they
[1:15:05] were wicked and sinners before the lord
[1:15:06] exceeding the lord said unto abram
[1:15:08] after that lot was separated from him
[1:15:10] you'll not find my brother and sister
[1:15:12] till later in scripture god's speaking
[1:15:14] to lot at all
[1:15:17] i want you to see this i want you to
[1:15:19] think about this you want to get to the
[1:15:21] place hey i'm not bothered by having to
[1:15:23] pray i'm not bothered by reading my
[1:15:24] bible
[1:15:25] how good is that well if you like that
[1:15:28] or don't like that however you want to
[1:15:29] look at that no big deal
[1:15:31] you can pitch your tent towards sodom
[1:15:33] and never read a bible ever again in
[1:15:34] your life
[1:15:39] hmm am i being too rough
[1:15:45] he tells abram now after lots out of his
[1:15:48] life
[1:15:48] see there was this negative element but
[1:15:51] if we go back in scripture you'll find
[1:15:53] that god had told abram in the very
[1:15:54] beginning
[1:15:55] to separate yourself so he come for a
[1:15:58] season
[1:15:58] and god said no if i'm going to bless
[1:16:00] you buddy you're going to have to get a
[1:16:02] total separation from unbelief
[1:16:05] amen after the law what's up lift up
[1:16:08] thine eyes
[1:16:10] amen yes that's right
[1:16:14] all i have is woe woe here woe there
[1:16:18] whoa whoa whoa no abram
[1:16:22] lift up thine eyes and look from the
[1:16:25] place where thou art
[1:16:26] northward i have a pretty good built-in
[1:16:31] compass if you had one right now
[1:16:32] you would realize i'm pointing north
[1:16:36] i'm blessed of god i don't know how it
[1:16:39] works it works
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:41] northward southward
[1:16:46] eastward westward
[1:16:50] amen that covers everything in our life
[1:16:54] we're back to 360.
[1:16:57] right but of a different 360 now
[1:17:01] lots 360 zeroed him down into a place
[1:17:03] where people were sinners and wicked
[1:17:05] before god
[1:17:07] but god's now got abram up here on the
[1:17:09] plane and tells him i want you to look
[1:17:11] 360
[1:17:12] because i've gave this to you
[1:17:15] you know what it was symbolically
[1:17:17] speaking an entirely different land
[1:17:20] not even the same land oh hallelujah
[1:17:23] aren't you glad there's a land beyond
[1:17:26] the river
[1:17:28] oh hallelujah that they call the sweet
[1:17:32] forever and we only get there
[1:17:36] by love's decree
[1:17:40] what is that love
[1:17:44] right here we get there by the decree
[1:17:47] of god in written form oh hallelujah
[1:17:51] gets me excited saints i hope i hope it
[1:17:54] stirs your heart also
[1:17:55] for all the land which i'll see us to
[1:17:57] thee will i give it unto thy
[1:17:59] seed forever amen so what a what an
[1:18:03] incredible promise
[1:18:04] amen that was given and this all come
[1:18:07] out of a separation
[1:18:08] amen that abram come to the place the
[1:18:12] moved of the holy spirit amen
[1:18:14] because as we read earlier that it would
[1:18:16] be god
[1:18:17] manifest in us and it come to the place
[1:18:20] that the separation was more important
[1:18:23] to
[1:18:24] abram than the fellowship with his
[1:18:26] nephew law
[1:18:27] amen so he's able to separate and he
[1:18:30] moves
[1:18:31] and so the attraction my brother and
[1:18:33] sister comes that there is a time and a
[1:18:35] place and
[1:18:36] you know it wasn't scot-free we see
[1:18:38] abram going off and
[1:18:40] he ends up in places uh abimelech you
[1:18:42] know looks at his wife his
[1:18:44] old old wore out wife hallelujah i don't
[1:18:47] know what was wrong with abimelech a man
[1:18:48] in the prime of his life with the
[1:18:50] kingdom
[1:18:50] and he's out there and he's got spies
[1:18:53] out looking at all the old women
[1:18:56] come on have a little sense of humor
[1:18:59] here
[1:19:00] he said look out spies looking at all
[1:19:02] these old women no my brother and sister
[1:19:03] you know what's happening
[1:19:04] that word that's changing you and i into
[1:19:07] who we really
[1:19:09] are had been working on sarah and
[1:19:11] abraham
[1:19:12] eyes had actually been blinded to that
[1:19:15] he didn't realize he was really looking
[1:19:18] at the very manifestation of the gift
[1:19:21] he hadn't caught the full value of the
[1:19:24] revelation
[1:19:25] and people say well now brother paul is
[1:19:28] the ministry fivefold ministry are these
[1:19:30] people gonna have more revelation than
[1:19:32] the prophet
[1:19:33] no my brother and sister whoever thought
[1:19:35] that has got an inflated sense of their
[1:19:37] value
[1:19:37] but i'm telling you there was revelation
[1:19:40] that was brought
[1:19:41] and revealed in our day that we still
[1:19:44] have not caught it it's still not has it
[1:19:47] been
[1:19:48] manifested to us it's not been enabled
[1:19:51] and that's why the word is not dead to
[1:19:54] us we're not looking back to an old
[1:19:55] message
[1:19:56] it's alive every day and uh more every
[1:19:59] day more every day more every day
[1:20:01] because you see it's coming alive just
[1:20:03] as it was as cyril was walking sarah was
[1:20:07] living
[1:20:07] she was changing from that old woman
[1:20:10] back to a beautiful woman
[1:20:12] so much that a king looked at her and
[1:20:14] abram lies and says whoa oh no no no
[1:20:16] she's my sister
[1:20:18] and uh bimalik wasn't like i need an old
[1:20:20] lady around my house
[1:20:22] come on i don't mean to sound carnal but
[1:20:24] he wasn't looking for an old lady
[1:20:26] he looked down there at her and said
[1:20:28] that is the most beautiful woman
[1:20:30] and i have ever and here's another side
[1:20:33] note just for history
[1:20:34] you'll understand that abimelech god set
[1:20:36] this up abimelech's household was barren
[1:20:39] so of all the wives that he had he had
[1:20:41] not one heir he had not one legacy
[1:20:43] in his household he looked down at sarah
[1:20:46] no doubt he thought oh there's a
[1:20:47] beautiful young woman
[1:20:48] maybe you know i i want to marry her for
[1:20:51] what she is but maybe she could produce
[1:20:53] me an
[1:20:54] heir she could bring forth and we see
[1:20:56] what happened
[1:20:57] and you know bim looks like lord you
[1:20:58] know i'm righteous i'm holy
[1:21:00] lord you know i never do this and he
[1:21:02] says you go ask him to pray for you
[1:21:04] or i'll put a curse on you oh so he goes
[1:21:07] down and the very man who lied to him
[1:21:09] now prays for him
[1:21:10] so what my point is is is uh well let me
[1:21:13] finish
[1:21:14] that thought lately my wife not blaming
[1:21:16] her but she's like you didn't finish the
[1:21:18] story
[1:21:19] sorry um but uh
[1:21:22] he prays for him and the curse comes
[1:21:25] from abimelech's
[1:21:27] and his wives start to have babies
[1:21:32] see god had it all set up
[1:21:35] all had to come right in the right place
[1:21:38] but abimelech said lord you know my
[1:21:39] heart
[1:21:40] remember we were talking the other day
[1:21:41] see it all comes back and not ability
[1:21:44] he knows the heart hallelujah okay i'm
[1:21:47] getting sidetracked
[1:21:48] anyway so you see this is where he comes
[1:21:50] and he lays this all out
[1:21:51] and we see how that god is moving now i
[1:21:54] want to jump down here to genesis 19
[1:21:56] because now we have another side this is
[1:21:58] this is abram up here on this land he
[1:22:00] owns this land god's working with him
[1:22:02] god's blessing him
[1:22:03] gives him a child brings forth a
[1:22:05] promised seed and now here in revelation
[1:22:07] genesis 19
[1:22:09] we see now that two angels now my
[1:22:10] brother and sister people have through
[1:22:12] the ages
[1:22:13] they've looked at this now my brother
[1:22:15] and sister i i look at that and when i
[1:22:17] read what the prophet of god said
[1:22:19] it just all comes together you can hear
[1:22:21] the click
[1:22:22] so loud as it falls in place that it's
[1:22:24] unreal
[1:22:25] come two angels to sodom at even and lot
[1:22:28] set in the gate of sodom lot
[1:22:30] seeing them rose up to meet them and he
[1:22:32] bound himself
[1:22:33] with his face toward the ground and he
[1:22:34] said behold now my lords
[1:22:36] small ill attorney and i pray you into
[1:22:39] your servant's house and terry all night
[1:22:41] wash your feet
[1:22:42] you shall rise up early and go on your
[1:22:43] ways and they said nay but we will abide
[1:22:46] in the street
[1:22:46] all night oh we won't go into all the
[1:22:49] symbolism you might say that's in the
[1:22:51] word here the typology
[1:22:53] but my brother and sister it was there
[1:22:55] you see the word is not going to be hid
[1:22:57] the word is there it's powerful it's
[1:23:00] mighty it's two edges it can abide
[1:23:02] wherever god sends it amen it can do
[1:23:05] what god sends it to do
[1:23:06] but there is something uh uh moving here
[1:23:10] and so there's a little something
[1:23:11] stirring in lot and so they're gonna
[1:23:13] stay in the street all night but he
[1:23:15] pressed upon them greatly
[1:23:18] so there was a there was still a degree
[1:23:20] of good
[1:23:22] you see lot had become you might say the
[1:23:26] mayor of the city sat in the gate that's
[1:23:28] where they that they set to judge that
[1:23:30] was what are they set to do
[1:23:31] and so what has he done he did not even
[1:23:33] attend outside the city any longer
[1:23:36] he's right downtown he's a part of the
[1:23:38] government he's a part of the program
[1:23:40] amen he presses on them they turn in
[1:23:42] entered into his house and he made them
[1:23:44] a feast and did bake unleavened bread
[1:23:46] and they did eat
[1:23:47] but before they lay down the men of the
[1:23:48] city even the men of sodom
[1:23:50] can pass the house around both old and
[1:23:53] young
[1:23:53] all the people from every
[1:23:56] come on saints every quarter
[1:24:00] that means the guy that was a deacon
[1:24:02] down here the guy that was the preacher
[1:24:03] the guy that was this the guy that was
[1:24:05] that
[1:24:05] this is the kind of church that sodom
[1:24:07] had produced
[1:24:08] or the kind of church that produced
[1:24:10] sodom
[1:24:14] come on prophet of god said it was weak
[1:24:17] pulpits
[1:24:20] lord help us amen
[1:24:23] amen not asking for special favor but
[1:24:26] would certainly ask for your prayers
[1:24:28] we don't want a weak pulpit we want
[1:24:30] every spiritual vitamin this word of god
[1:24:32] has got for us
[1:24:34] amen so these people come and they
[1:24:35] called into lot said unto him where are
[1:24:38] the men that come in to see thee this
[1:24:39] night bring them out to us that we may
[1:24:41] know them
[1:24:42] now you know we got mixed company here
[1:24:44] this morning
[1:24:45] but my brother and sister they weren't
[1:24:47] wanting to just say hi my name's fred
[1:24:50] no this is sodom this is a perverse and
[1:24:53] wicked generation of
[1:24:54] amen and they had their own intent oh
[1:24:58] my you know what from every quarter come
[1:25:00] on these weren't back alley people that
[1:25:02] were demanding
[1:25:03] this perversion now you look i'll just
[1:25:06] side note you for a moment
[1:25:08] if you want to do the research you'll
[1:25:09] find it you go look at the denominations
[1:25:11] now that are giving
[1:25:12] in to alternative ideology
[1:25:17] in their pulpits which is a politically
[1:25:20] correct way to say and you know what i'm
[1:25:24] saying
[1:25:29] maybe we're in sodom
[1:25:33] it could possibly be that sodom has
[1:25:35] showed up
[1:25:36] even in conservative idaho
[1:25:40] wow oh it couldn't be in idaho the idaho
[1:25:44] i grew up in
[1:25:45] if your kid was wandering down the
[1:25:46] street somebody might stop not to snatch
[1:25:48] your kid
[1:25:49] but somebody to say does your mama know
[1:25:51] you're here
[1:25:53] it's no longer that kind of place
[1:26:02] reminds me a little story told the boy
[1:26:04] riding a bicycle down the highway
[1:26:05] in wyoming and these two very strange
[1:26:08] looking men
[1:26:09] stopped and said oh son get in the car
[1:26:11] with us we can take you wherever
[1:26:13] and the little boy said well my daddy
[1:26:15] said if you lay a hand on me
[1:26:17] he'll shoot you and they're like where's
[1:26:21] your daddy
[1:26:22] i don't know but he's watching you right
[1:26:24] now
[1:26:26] they got back in their car and drove off
[1:26:29] now my brother and sister
[1:26:34] god would give us some saints would say
[1:26:36] you know what
[1:26:37] you lay your hand on me devil my daddy
[1:26:40] is going to shoot you
[1:26:43] hallelujah there's more to that little
[1:26:45] story or whatever
[1:26:47] because the story goes on the little
[1:26:49] boys in town
[1:26:51] and walking down the sidewalk with his
[1:26:54] daddy
[1:26:55] and the little boy out loud and funny
[1:26:57] daddy them the
[1:26:58] men that wanted me to get in the car and
[1:27:00] go with them i told them
[1:27:02] if they laid a hand on me i'd shoot them
[1:27:05] and the man looks over there and goes
[1:27:06] are you sure that's them son and he goes
[1:27:09] yeah
[1:27:11] he goes did they lay a hand on you
[1:27:14] no daddy good because i left my gun in
[1:27:17] the truck
[1:27:20] now my brother and sister i serve a god
[1:27:24] that knows how to take care of his
[1:27:25] children
[1:27:28] amen so here we are so the men
[1:27:32] they come in there they said again
[1:27:36] they come in he needs to be a judge now
[1:27:38] how he deal worse with thee than with
[1:27:40] them
[1:27:40] so they're threatening lot and they
[1:27:43] press sore upon the man
[1:27:44] lot and come near to break the door but
[1:27:46] the men put forth their hand and pulled
[1:27:48] lot into the house to them
[1:27:49] amen here's god always rich in mercy
[1:27:52] shut the door and they smote the men
[1:27:54] that were at the door of the house with
[1:27:56] blindness both small and great
[1:27:57] so that they wearied themselves to find
[1:28:00] the door amen now this all ties back
[1:28:02] saints to the scripture
[1:28:04] amen that they are blind cannot have
[1:28:07] ears they cannot hear
[1:28:08] amen so they've been smote this is
[1:28:11] actually god's doing this is not an
[1:28:13] unfortunate event amen
[1:28:18] and the man said on a lot hast thou any
[1:28:20] besides son-in-law thy sons that
[1:28:22] daughters and whatsoever the house and
[1:28:24] the city bring them out of this place
[1:28:26] for we will destroy this place because
[1:28:28] the cry of them is waxing great before
[1:28:30] the face of the lord
[1:28:32] and oh did we jump somewhere have i got
[1:28:35] myself lost
[1:28:37] okay okay
[1:28:40] and lot went out
[1:28:44] before the face of the lord oh oh here's
[1:28:46] the verse okay
[1:28:47] excuse me this is this profound and i'm
[1:28:50] just going to put it out parents forgive
[1:28:51] me
[1:28:52] i don't mean it to be a a a
[1:28:55] cross they said in the lighthouse there
[1:28:57] are any besides son-in-law
[1:28:59] and thy daughters and whatsoever the
[1:29:00] house and the city bring them out
[1:29:02] uh and so we're looking here this sets a
[1:29:06] stage now
[1:29:07] they said we're going to destroy this
[1:29:08] place because the cry of them is waxed
[1:29:10] and great before the face of the lord
[1:29:12] and lord now under the spirit of
[1:29:19] [Music]
[1:29:22] compromise
[1:29:24] he goes look son
[1:29:28] there's going to be trouble coming
[1:29:31] and this place is going to get destroyed
[1:29:34] and you you need to just come with us
[1:29:39] what did they do
[1:29:42] they basically were mocked you know why
[1:29:46] parents want to tie this together to you
[1:29:49] because the daughter and son-in-law's
[1:29:50] had never saw
[1:29:52] a move of god in dad's life
[1:29:55] so when dad said no god's talking to me
[1:29:57] we've got to do this they're like what
[1:29:59] are you
[1:29:59] talking about
[1:30:02] what are you what are you talking about
[1:30:04] that's ridiculous
[1:30:06] if god was going to be anywhere in the
[1:30:07] city it would be in our church
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:15] you see also in these scriptures here we
[1:30:18] won't go back and catch that
[1:30:20] but um lot under the spirit of
[1:30:23] compromise this is where i
[1:30:24] got skipped over he says you know what
[1:30:27] don't bother these men
[1:30:28] i got two young daughters that have
[1:30:30] never been touched of a man
[1:30:32] just take them out and do whatever you
[1:30:35] want to them
[1:30:37] i want to i want you to catch how
[1:30:39] depraved
[1:30:40] lot went from being with abram and being
[1:30:43] blessed
[1:30:44] to the place he's now offered his
[1:30:46] daughters to the world
[1:30:48] do whatever you please with them
[1:30:52] i'm sorry my brother and sister that
[1:30:55] just doesn't sit right with me
[1:30:57] that brings me to a place them would be
[1:30:59] what you might call fighting words
[1:31:01] amen that would be the place that you
[1:31:03] call it whatever you want to call it i
[1:31:04] call it
[1:31:05] a righteous indication which means i'm
[1:31:07] going to hurt you
[1:31:09] amen you're not touching my daughters
[1:31:12] there won't be life left in my bones
[1:31:14] before you get your hands on my
[1:31:16] daughters
[1:31:17] that lot under that spiritual condition
[1:31:19] had declined
[1:31:20] a decision that he made up on the plains
[1:31:23] of memory right there in a time and a
[1:31:25] place
[1:31:26] my brother and sister that he could have
[1:31:29] come
[1:31:29] and said you know what nope i'm going to
[1:31:31] stand with god's despised few
[1:31:33] uh you know what i'll tell you if abram
[1:31:35] had went down onto the plains there in
[1:31:37] sodom
[1:31:38] they'd had a revival the devil would
[1:31:40] have drove them people out of there
[1:31:42] and that would have been a godly place
[1:31:43] you see because that was what god was
[1:31:45] going to do he was going to bless
[1:31:46] abram amen but you see how it was it
[1:31:49] didn't matter where abram chose
[1:31:52] or a lot chose he chose up there but if
[1:31:54] his heart was down there
[1:31:56] i want you to get this he could have
[1:31:57] stayed up there on top in the plains and
[1:31:59] the grasslands but if his heart was down
[1:32:01] in sodom he'd have brought sodom to the
[1:32:03] plains
[1:32:06] amen so here it is that his own family
[1:32:08] mocks him
[1:32:09] but when the morning rise the angels
[1:32:12] hastened lots saying garage take thy
[1:32:14] wife and my two daughters which are here
[1:32:16] lest they be consumed
[1:32:17] in the iniquity of the city now this is
[1:32:20] god's grace i want you to catch this
[1:32:22] this is god's grace amen that it is here
[1:32:25] and while he lingered right he was
[1:32:27] dragging his feet
[1:32:28] the men laid hold upon his hand and upon
[1:32:30] the hand of his wife by the hand of his
[1:32:32] two daughters
[1:32:32] and the lord being merciful unto him and
[1:32:35] brought him forth and set him without
[1:32:37] the city
[1:32:37] amen drug him right out of there
[1:32:39] supernatural event took place
[1:32:41] and it came to pass that they brought
[1:32:42] them forth abroad and he said escape for
[1:32:45] thy life
[1:32:45] look not behind thee amen i've told you
[1:32:48] before i'm going to say it again
[1:32:50] that's why i don't really like to see
[1:32:52] people give glory to their past
[1:32:54] right the scripture says look not behind
[1:32:56] thee
[1:32:57] neither stay thou in all the plain
[1:32:59] escape to the mountain
[1:33:01] lest thou be consumed and lot said unto
[1:33:03] them
[1:33:04] oh not so lord now saints i want you to
[1:33:07] catch this here
[1:33:08] what was happening god gave very
[1:33:10] specific instructions through his
[1:33:11] messengers
[1:33:13] god is speaking god's given mercy god
[1:33:15] took him by the hand even and let him
[1:33:17] out of this place
[1:33:18] and now his response to all of this is
[1:33:22] not so my lord
[1:33:25] behold now thy servant have found grace
[1:33:27] in thy sight and now has magnified thy
[1:33:29] mercy
[1:33:30] uh which thou hast showed unto me in
[1:33:33] saving my life and i cannot escape to
[1:33:35] the mountain lest
[1:33:35] some evil take me and i die now i want
[1:33:39] to just
[1:33:39] be here and i might not be able to get
[1:33:41] this finished because i'm not going to
[1:33:42] just keep you forever today and
[1:33:44] we still have quite a bit to go but he
[1:33:46] has
[1:33:47] just received a personal
[1:33:51] invitation from god
[1:33:56] it doesn't get any better than that it
[1:33:59] doesn't get
[1:34:00] any grander or any more magnificent
[1:34:04] or any more glorified than a personal
[1:34:07] invitation from god
[1:34:12] and he says i can't do that because
[1:34:15] something on the mountain
[1:34:17] might get me well i tell you the
[1:34:19] mountain that god was
[1:34:20] wanting him to go back to would have
[1:34:22] been come back lot
[1:34:23] you're straying away come back lot come
[1:34:26] back
[1:34:27] lot and we see symbolically
[1:34:30] uh you find all through the bible amen
[1:34:32] god is on the mountain
[1:34:34] amen you'll find there my brother and
[1:34:36] sister the
[1:34:37] personal invitation to come to the
[1:34:38] mountain because great things happen on
[1:34:40] the mountain
[1:34:41] you think about that god revealing uh to
[1:34:44] moses took place on the mountain
[1:34:46] uh gideon was up on the side of the
[1:34:48] mountain the very rock
[1:34:50] that he was hiding behind with his
[1:34:52] little uh
[1:34:53] thrashing and his little wine press and
[1:34:55] all of that that very rock turned out to
[1:34:57] be
[1:34:58] jesus christ amen that rock was alive
[1:35:00] amen
[1:35:01] it was there all the time
[1:35:06] abraham god's provided ram didn't take
[1:35:08] place in a valley somewhere
[1:35:10] took place on a mountain and god himself
[1:35:13] threw them in it was god speaking amen
[1:35:16] he says i got a provided place for you
[1:35:17] lot come on to the mountain
[1:35:19] and i'll say this if god invites you god
[1:35:22] can keep you
[1:35:24] hallelujah you don't worry about what
[1:35:26] happened well if i get all this
[1:35:28] and i get all that you know if i if i go
[1:35:30] to serve god
[1:35:31] well no god invites you he'll keep you
[1:35:35] amen see now what's the loss alternative
[1:35:38] give me another city verse 20. give me
[1:35:40] another city it's just a little city
[1:35:41] can't be too much sin in a little city
[1:35:43] right
[1:35:44] you obviously didn't grow up in the
[1:35:45] country
[1:35:47] come in the most wicked little cities
[1:35:49] little wicked places
[1:35:50] i should say are these little towns
[1:35:54] and i won't even go into that because i
[1:35:56] don't want to scorch your eyebrows you
[1:35:57] guys will go out to eat and
[1:35:59] everybody like us smell burnt hair
[1:36:03] but these little towns my brother and
[1:36:05] sister might only have 750 people
[1:36:08] they might have 10 churches and 750
[1:36:11] people
[1:36:12] and they'll have 20 bars do the math
[1:36:20] some cases i knew once upon a time
[1:36:24] deacon in the church owned the bar
[1:36:27] that doesn't become any more of a
[1:36:28] paradox than anything you can find
[1:36:32] see we can settle for our own zeor we
[1:36:35] can settle my brother and sister as this
[1:36:37] goes on and
[1:36:38] god grants him gives mercy to him sends
[1:36:40] him out there and lets him go to zayor
[1:36:42] but you see zeor was too wicked and lot
[1:36:45] had learned a little bit of a lesson
[1:36:46] and so here is the mountain still the
[1:36:48] mountain didn't go away saints
[1:36:50] and so here's the mountain and now lot
[1:36:52] starts to work his way back up the
[1:36:54] mountain
[1:36:54] because he liked going to church he
[1:36:56] liked to having this he liked blessing
[1:36:58] his food
[1:36:59] he liked saying little blessings over
[1:37:03] makes it halfway up the mountain now i
[1:37:06] don't want to dwell on this either but i
[1:37:07] want to drive it home enough it's real
[1:37:09] to you
[1:37:09] he gets up on the side of the mountain
[1:37:11] he finds a cave
[1:37:13] amen a hole
[1:37:16] not a place to glorify god not a place
[1:37:19] to lift up
[1:37:20] the cross amen
[1:37:24] so he moves up there moves into this
[1:37:26] cave
[1:37:27] but when he never got rid of saints and
[1:37:29] this is the thing and i just need to
[1:37:31] close probably
[1:37:32] but this is the thing i want to drive
[1:37:34] home to you
[1:37:35] the spirit that was in sodom
[1:37:39] never got delivered from lot
[1:37:42] his wife couldn't help herself she was
[1:37:44] thinking i used to have a nice house i
[1:37:46] had all of this
[1:37:47] i have my social thing i have my i i'm
[1:37:49] the church you know fellowship
[1:37:50] coordinator i'm the
[1:37:52] i'm like this and she had to look back
[1:37:54] to that and poof it was over with
[1:37:56] now i want to paraphrase it or type it
[1:37:57] to you in a slightly different way
[1:37:59] you know she turned into a pillar of
[1:38:01] salt they believe they've identified
[1:38:02] what that pillar is
[1:38:03] amen they say well if it was a pillar of
[1:38:05] salt it would have washed away by now
[1:38:06] but my brother and sister they say that
[1:38:08] is one of the hardest pillars of salt
[1:38:10] that was ever there and time is wearing
[1:38:12] it away but very slowly
[1:38:14] but i'm telling you what let me bring it
[1:38:16] to you in different deal she was walking
[1:38:18] along
[1:38:18] and we've seen this happen she was
[1:38:20] walking along and she thought i used to
[1:38:22] this and i used to that i remember
[1:38:24] i remember remember the prophet of god
[1:38:26] talking about that little girl stopped
[1:38:27] outside the door of the dance hall
[1:38:30] amen and what happened she started
[1:38:31] looking and in this modern day
[1:38:33] lot's wife starts looking back you know
[1:38:36] i
[1:38:37] i enjoyed going to a church that my
[1:38:38] cleavage could show
[1:38:40] i enjoyed going to a church my clothes
[1:38:41] could be true and i could walk
[1:38:43] on my heels and prance as it was i'm
[1:38:46] sorry i'm not picking on your sisters
[1:38:47] i'm just making the example
[1:38:49] and the where the men could go down amen
[1:38:51] i knew a guy was a leadership in a
[1:38:53] denominational church
[1:38:54] and they had a place i believe they call
[1:38:55] it the roost and all the ministry of the
[1:38:58] church is a big church they had like
[1:38:59] eight or nine ministers in that church
[1:39:01] had offices and they would all meet at
[1:39:03] the roost and drink liquor and smoke
[1:39:05] cigars
[1:39:07] that's what i want for a pastor
[1:39:11] come on but they're looking back right
[1:39:13] so they could be what they wanted to be
[1:39:15] with their idea of what god wanted
[1:39:18] and many of them today are lot's wife
[1:39:20] because they're turning
[1:39:21] they're turning they're turning and they
[1:39:24] are going back
[1:39:25] they're not just looking back they are
[1:39:27] going back my brother and sister i can
[1:39:29] tell you right now this sounds harsh and
[1:39:31] i don't mean it because i believe till
[1:39:32] it's not over till it's over
[1:39:34] but i tell you the hearts and souls of
[1:39:36] sons and daughters of god
[1:39:38] call out and crave the word now you can
[1:39:41] get detoured for a season right
[1:39:43] amen amen gps will turn us
[1:39:46] back you know rerouting rerouting so i'm
[1:39:49] saying they're all lost don't
[1:39:51] misunderstand me but that spirit is what
[1:39:53] i'm talking
[1:39:54] about it's there look back look look
[1:39:57] look look don't look look forward
[1:40:01] look to the mountain in fact forget that
[1:40:04] go to the mountain
[1:40:06] amen so here look what's happening here
[1:40:08] so they go and they escape
[1:40:10] and they end up down there in zeor and
[1:40:12] it's too wicked
[1:40:13] right they move on hallelujah you see we
[1:40:16] can settle for that
[1:40:17] we can settle for a cave halfway up the
[1:40:19] mountain but i'll tell you what happens
[1:40:21] that spirit was there
[1:40:23] now i don't want you to take this in
[1:40:24] natural because in the natural it's kind
[1:40:26] of just creepy
[1:40:28] but you look at this now here's lot and
[1:40:30] the two daughters typing church
[1:40:33] amen and they're like god's not in
[1:40:35] control
[1:40:36] we're not ever going to have any seed be
[1:40:38] able to take the seed of our father
[1:40:39] forward
[1:40:40] and we look around as though the only
[1:40:42] man left on earth was their own
[1:40:44] father but the church said you know what
[1:40:46] just give us your name
[1:40:48] and we can take care of it we'll produce
[1:40:50] what we
[1:40:51] think god wants the church to be we'll
[1:40:53] produce the kind of believer
[1:40:56] we think it ought to be because i'm
[1:40:58] telling you what kind of anointing
[1:41:00] saints what kind of anointing caused a
[1:41:02] daughter to look at their daddy
[1:41:03] and say i want to sleep with my daddy
[1:41:08] and you say man that was a horrible
[1:41:09] decision you know it wasn't even a
[1:41:12] decision that was made there
[1:41:14] it was made back when lot was up here
[1:41:17] and given the
[1:41:18] opportunity to take anything
[1:41:21] he wanted
[1:41:27] and he pitched his tent towards otto
[1:41:32] the stage right in his family father
[1:41:35] might sound a little harsh forgive me
[1:41:37] but you will set the stage
[1:41:39] for what happens to your daughters and
[1:41:42] your sons
[1:41:43] well they got to believe for themselves
[1:41:45] that's right but if they see god moving
[1:41:47] inside the four walls
[1:41:48] of your life or your home and they'll be
[1:41:51] more apt to say you know what god is
[1:41:53] real
[1:41:53] and i want to serve a god like that
[1:41:56] because my prayers make a difference
[1:41:58] now i know this is a little blunt
[1:42:00] forgive me amen
[1:42:02] but it has to be dealt with oh my
[1:42:05] what anointing told them there'd be no
[1:42:07] seed
[1:42:09] where did they come to conclusion they'd
[1:42:11] be no seed didn't come from god
[1:42:15] what anointing told them that their
[1:42:16] natural act would bring forth a
[1:42:19] prophesied word
[1:42:22] come on their natural act they did
[1:42:25] something carnal something that's just
[1:42:26] totally against nature
[1:42:29] and believed that that would bring forth
[1:42:31] the prophesied word
[1:42:33] i'm telling you it's happening today
[1:42:34] saints people are doing things that are
[1:42:37] just totally against the word of god
[1:42:38] believing that's going to bring
[1:42:40] about the prophesied results amen
[1:42:44] but look at this now my can i have just
[1:42:47] a few more minutes
[1:42:50] you see in the beginning not complete
[1:42:54] beginning but in the beginning
[1:42:56] lot and his seed
[1:42:59] were an affliction deborah and his seed
[1:43:02] i'm just going to use the word abraham
[1:43:04] because that's really who he was
[1:43:06] so lot seed was an affliction to
[1:43:08] abraham's seed
[1:43:09] then came a separation
[1:43:13] come on go study your church age book
[1:43:16] came a separation
[1:43:17] and it went for a long time the
[1:43:19] separation went for a long time
[1:43:22] but in the end it would come so close it
[1:43:25] would deceive the very leg
[1:43:26] it can't stay separated it's got to come
[1:43:29] back together
[1:43:30] it's got to come back and once again in
[1:43:33] that it would come and it would bring a
[1:43:35] place that people were going to once
[1:43:37] again have to exercise free moral agency
[1:43:39] and the seed of god has the holy ghost
[1:43:42] to guide them
[1:43:43] and they cannot be deceived that is the
[1:43:45] word of god that's a prophet's word
[1:43:48] they can't be deceived amen
[1:43:52] and so look at this now the daughters
[1:43:54] their act
[1:43:55] they bring forth moab and ammon
[1:43:59] and both of those became an affliction
[1:44:02] in the side
[1:44:03] of israel and this was conceived
[1:44:07] oh hallelujah i hope you catch this
[1:44:10] this was not conceived on the mountain
[1:44:13] under the anointing of almighty god the
[1:44:15] holy ghost
[1:44:16] and it was not conceived down here in
[1:44:20] other cities they or in complete sin
[1:44:23] against god
[1:44:24] it was in the middle ground saints
[1:44:27] it was halfway from where the holy ghost
[1:44:30] ruled
[1:44:30] to where carnality and satan ruled it
[1:44:33] was halfway in the middle
[1:44:35] is where the cave was that brought forth
[1:44:38] the seed of moab
[1:44:41] oh hallelujah i hope you see that amen
[1:44:44] it's not just wickedness out here i can
[1:44:46] deal with wickedness
[1:44:48] i've got friends that they come up and
[1:44:50] they start to talk and they're like
[1:44:52] sorry paul i'll i won't use those words
[1:44:55] and they manage to have a whole
[1:44:56] conversation
[1:44:57] but their normal everyday life is you
[1:44:59] know like the cartoon is the blue streak
[1:45:03] just a blue streak i can deal with them
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:10] but it's the one that said hmm
[1:45:15] well symbolically
[1:45:25] we won't need that part
[1:45:28] that's the ones that make me nervous i
[1:45:30] can deal with that wicked guy out here
[1:45:33] because some of them are so honest they
[1:45:35] just make you almost hurt how honest
[1:45:37] they are
[1:45:38] guys they're like well you know i was
[1:45:39] doing that deal with you and i realized
[1:45:40] i shorted you a quarter
[1:45:45] come on halfway up the mountain
[1:45:49] that's where the problem lies
[1:45:54] amen so they become
[1:45:57] an affliction once again because you see
[1:46:00] moab and ammon
[1:46:04] could trace their lineage right back
[1:46:07] to abraham we're all one
[1:46:11] i've heard that so many times in the
[1:46:13] last 10 years it just makes me nervous
[1:46:15] we're all one no i'm sorry i don't think
[1:46:18] so
[1:46:20] i'm sorry i'm sorry let's go here now
[1:46:25] skip right along here now
[1:46:28] here we are and that's why i feel like i
[1:46:30] need to finish just have grace on me if
[1:46:32] you would saints
[1:46:34] in israel abode and them
[1:46:37] and the people had a revival
[1:46:40] no sir
[1:46:44] they begin to commit whoredom
[1:46:47] with who
[1:46:51] lots family
[1:46:54] conceived in a cave under a religious
[1:46:57] spirit
[1:46:58] that we must fulfill the seed
[1:47:02] of god
[1:47:05] we must do it god doesn't have enough of
[1:47:09] a grip on what
[1:47:10] the message is going to do in the 21st
[1:47:13] century
[1:47:14] we've got to make this happen come on
[1:47:17] you know what that is that's a
[1:47:18] domineering female spirit in the church
[1:47:21] that's when the church says god don't
[1:47:23] know what he's doing we've got to draw
[1:47:25] everyone together
[1:47:27] why don't we just sit back my brother
[1:47:28] and sister and pray god bring unity into
[1:47:31] the body of believers
[1:47:32] bring unity to the bride of christ bring
[1:47:35] unity to no we're going to make it
[1:47:36] happen
[1:47:43] boredom with the daughters of moab
[1:47:48] literally family
[1:47:52] and they called the people into the
[1:47:53] sacrifices of their gods
[1:47:55] and the people did eat and bowed down to
[1:47:57] their gods you know what this means oh
[1:47:58] let me drive this home to you
[1:48:00] and then after this i'll give this rest
[1:48:01] saints and we'll find other good things
[1:48:03] to preach about but i've just got to get
[1:48:04] this off the chest
[1:48:06] my brother and sister did you read the
[1:48:07] words right there
[1:48:14] they called
[1:48:18] that means some of them came that's
[1:48:20] right
[1:48:24] come on come on
[1:48:29] oh we're all one
[1:48:34] and they did eat
[1:48:37] and then they bowed down
[1:48:40] now this word eat my brother and sister
[1:48:42] in this scripture i'm not here to
[1:48:43] distort it
[1:48:44] but this word eat taken naturally and
[1:48:48] spiritually
[1:48:48] that's right they ate in their feasts
[1:48:51] natural
[1:48:52] but they also to bow down to their gods
[1:48:54] had to be eating
[1:48:57] what was being preached to them
[1:49:02] they sat down and it was like oh aren't
[1:49:04] we all one we're all family
[1:49:06] we have the same heritage we have we
[1:49:08] have we have we have
[1:49:09] and this is this and you know that's not
[1:49:11] important because
[1:49:12] this person was with the prophet and the
[1:49:14] prophet told them this
[1:49:16] but i'm sorry it's nowhere in the
[1:49:18] prophet's message
[1:49:19] nowhere in scripture but people ate it
[1:49:22] amen
[1:49:25] amen and what happened israel joined
[1:49:29] himself unto beopiore amen
[1:49:33] and god rejoiced
[1:49:36] no no saints he'll never rejoice in
[1:49:39] whoredom
[1:49:40] he rejoice that's why i chose for the
[1:49:42] opening scripture what i chose
[1:49:44] have no other gods
[1:49:48] they forgot it they forgot it
[1:49:51] that there can't be any other god it's
[1:49:53] the word and the word alone
[1:49:55] and i can't tell you depending on how
[1:49:56] you worded the prophet of god
[1:49:58] literally speaks i'm gonna probably
[1:50:01] exaggerate but he speaks in the hundreds
[1:50:04] of the word is our absolute the word is
[1:50:06] our ultimate the word is that go back to
[1:50:08] the word it's the word alone you look it
[1:50:10] up
[1:50:10] study it out the prophet of god's doing
[1:50:12] that you cannot my brother and sister
[1:50:14] eat the word and eat man's idea
[1:50:17] they will go together hallelujah because
[1:50:20] you can't feed both dogs
[1:50:23] you can't feed the religious spirit and
[1:50:25] you can't feed the holy ghost
[1:50:27] from the same trash can
[1:50:38] i think you could take verse two and
[1:50:39] preach for about a year on it
[1:50:42] amen what was their sacrifices
[1:50:45] let me just inject this real quick they
[1:50:48] went out killed the cat
[1:50:49] hung it in the tree and no no no no
[1:50:51] saints
[1:50:52] their sacrifices resembled
[1:50:56] the sacrifice israel was called to offer
[1:51:00] exactly exactly
[1:51:03] exactly i want you to catch the
[1:51:05] significance of this
[1:51:07] every sacrifice was exactly offered
[1:51:10] according to the word
[1:51:12] of the hour
[1:51:16] why didn't it yield the same result
[1:51:19] because the spirit behind the sacrifice
[1:51:22] was not the correct spirit
[1:51:26] god help us and i'm not judging anybody
[1:51:28] saints i just want you as a group of
[1:51:29] believers
[1:51:30] even our visitors i pray you don't walk
[1:51:33] out of here shell-shocked your eyebrows
[1:51:34] burnt off
[1:51:36] but look it's important we know where we
[1:51:38] stand because you see
[1:51:40] it comes so close to deceive the very
[1:51:41] elective possible but i'm telling you
[1:51:43] this word won't let it be possible
[1:51:46] this word won't let deception come and
[1:51:47] rest in our soul
[1:51:49] amen because god will come right through
[1:51:50] there and wash that out of there
[1:51:52] root that out of there cut that out of
[1:51:53] there whatever is necessary
[1:51:55] but you see it was all the same
[1:51:57] sacrifices
[1:51:58] and the people boy they gobbled it up
[1:52:00] i'm telling you don't ever
[1:52:02] be fooled by a church clear full of
[1:52:04] people just jumping up and shout and
[1:52:05] amen and hallelujah
[1:52:06] don't be fooled by people jumping up and
[1:52:08] running around the church
[1:52:09] and people jumping up and speaking in
[1:52:11] tongues don't be fooled by that nonsense
[1:52:13] that same guy will steal the tires off
[1:52:15] your car on monday morning
[1:52:16] amen none of that means nothing it's a
[1:52:19] life my brother and sister
[1:52:20] it's a life hallelujah
[1:52:24] and so it's there the sacrifice what the
[1:52:26] people will do
[1:52:27] and we're all called to bow down the man
[1:52:30] who won't bow
[1:52:33] come on i want him go in there today go
[1:52:36] back to
[1:52:37] daniel amen everybody's called to bow
[1:52:39] down
[1:52:40] it's who you're going to bow down to and
[1:52:43] they bowed down to
[1:52:44] their gods not jehovah
[1:52:47] not lord god almighty not elohim
[1:52:51] the great i am no they're gods and they
[1:52:53] can't even put a big g
[1:52:55] on their gods because they're just a man
[1:52:56] made created crafted
[1:52:58] as the scripture says they took the
[1:53:00] traditions of
[1:53:01] men and not the word of god
[1:53:05] hallelujah so they've got a whole
[1:53:06] process built up
[1:53:08] that was this was said and this must be
[1:53:10] done and this is part of that and this
[1:53:11] is this
[1:53:12] i want the word i want a pure word
[1:53:15] i want any one of you if god called you
[1:53:18] to be able to say look brother paul
[1:53:19] i was reading in my bible this right
[1:53:22] here
[1:53:22] read this oh sister you have no right to
[1:53:25] handle that
[1:53:26] no my brother and sister god speaks to
[1:53:28] sisters she just needs to make sure she
[1:53:30] isn't trying to be the preacher
[1:53:32] and and dominate things but god speaks
[1:53:34] to that that word is alive it needs to
[1:53:36] be alive not as brother branham says
[1:53:38] not just some anointed minister why the
[1:53:40] people just sit there
[1:53:43] hallelujah that's the kind of god i want
[1:53:44] to serve that's the kind to do that
[1:53:46] but look at this see so they bowed
[1:53:48] themselves to it
[1:53:50] but not only that whether they realized
[1:53:52] it or not
[1:53:54] they joined themselves
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:57] now let me throw this at you where's the
[1:53:59] rest of israel
[1:54:01] where's the rest of israel
[1:54:05] not all israel went down there where's
[1:54:07] the rest of israel
[1:54:09] they're over here offering an offering
[1:54:11] on the sacrifice
[1:54:13] amen they are eating
[1:54:16] the word amen and they are bowing
[1:54:20] down to god amen
[1:54:23] because there was a portion that could
[1:54:25] not be deceived one of his name was
[1:54:26] phineas
[1:54:27] i'll tell you what oh some people they
[1:54:30] don't like me oh maybe you're beating on
[1:54:32] this too much brother paul sounds like
[1:54:33] you're just angry about that no i'm
[1:54:34] sorry i'm not
[1:54:35] there's a spirit here and i'm going to
[1:54:37] just drive that thing away because if he
[1:54:39] doesn't leave i'm going to be the
[1:54:40] phineas if i have to be or maybe
[1:54:42] there'll be some other phineas's
[1:54:44] and i'm going to go rip through the
[1:54:45] front door of their tent and i'm going
[1:54:46] to ram them through the belly and pin
[1:54:48] them to the ground and
[1:54:50] stop the curse that's moving through our
[1:54:52] message
[1:54:54] not me not me my brother and sister it's
[1:54:56] god no man will do that
[1:54:57] but it's time we stand up and say well
[1:54:59] in the message we gotta all stand
[1:55:01] together
[1:55:02] because it's all the denominations
[1:55:03] against us no sorry some of you are a
[1:55:05] denomination
[1:55:09] come on and i don't say that mockingly
[1:55:11] that probably did come out a little
[1:55:12] mockingly
[1:55:13] amen god loved this so much
[1:55:17] verse four he says to moses you think
[1:55:20] brother paul's preaching hard
[1:55:24] god said to moses sorry brother trevor
[1:55:27] you're close
[1:55:30] okay so uh brother uh was you
[1:55:33] down there at those meetings yeah
[1:55:40] huh and you think some of the preachers
[1:55:42] in this message are rough
[1:55:45] come on take all the heads of the people
[1:55:49] and hang them up before the lord against
[1:55:50] the sun
[1:55:51] that the fierce anger of the lord may be
[1:55:53] turned away from israel
[1:55:55] there was nothing about this great move
[1:55:57] of unity
[1:55:59] that brought something pleasing to the
[1:56:01] lord
[1:56:03] well you know we're just a small number
[1:56:05] in the message
[1:56:07] the prophet said it'd be even smaller
[1:56:09] than what it is
[1:56:15] moses said unto the judges of israel oh
[1:56:18] no he just recruited a bunch of
[1:56:20] preachers
[1:56:22] oh my goodness we don't need him i just
[1:56:25] want paul's
[1:56:26] writings we don't want no fivefold
[1:56:28] ministry man
[1:56:29] but we're just going to go back to
[1:56:30] paul's writings i want to go back to
[1:56:33] what peter said i want
[1:56:34] james and john i want somebody this
[1:56:36] authority that i can trust what they had
[1:56:38] to say
[1:56:40] moses said to the judges of israel slay
[1:56:42] every one of his men
[1:56:43] that were joined and developed
[1:56:46] oh you talk about rough come on saints
[1:56:50] it was rough there were people i only
[1:56:52] went down there once
[1:56:55] sorry you joined yourself to that
[1:56:59] i only
[1:57:03] hm imagine if god sent them men to
[1:57:08] preach in our message churches today
[1:57:10] what would happen
[1:57:15] come on amen prophet of god said there'd
[1:57:17] come a day that
[1:57:18] the holy spirit would call the sin out
[1:57:20] in the church
[1:57:22] let's repent saints come on i say this
[1:57:25] from my heart let's repent
[1:57:27] come clean before god asks for his mercy
[1:57:30] before it comes to the day that he calls
[1:57:32] it out
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:35] lift it before the lord the blood is
[1:57:37] sufficient his grace is sufficient
[1:57:39] we we don't want to come we don't want
[1:57:41] to be those people that coming right
[1:57:43] down to the cusp of a rapture that god
[1:57:45] says you know what i'm going to force
[1:57:46] you
[1:57:47] if i have to force you to repent of that
[1:57:50] i'll call your name and your sin over
[1:57:52] the pulpit
[1:57:53] that's right when we can just go freely
[1:57:56] and say lord forgive me
[1:57:58] forgive me lord
[1:58:03] now here's where this gets really rough
[1:58:06] we thought them
[1:58:06] guys chomping heads off and hanging them
[1:58:08] face to the sun we're rough crowd
[1:58:11] this comes down real personal
[1:58:14] one of the children of israel come and
[1:58:17] brought
[1:58:19] do you realize what they're saying
[1:58:23] brought a midianite woman
[1:58:27] into the church
[1:58:37] brought that sin not even a
[1:58:40] sacred bone left in their body
[1:58:44] that's what joining that bail pure does
[1:58:48] oh we dress right we walk right we talk
[1:58:51] right
[1:58:52] and we do everything else
[1:58:55] but we don't do it openly
[1:58:59] see how far they went that's right
[1:59:02] come on and then the side of all the
[1:59:05] side of moses side of the congregation
[1:59:07] who were weeping before the door of the
[1:59:09] tabernacle
[1:59:10] right this was not a church that gave up
[1:59:12] this is a church that's calling on god
[1:59:13] oh lord
[1:59:14] oh lord have mercy have mercy lord
[1:59:16] there's a curse upon us
[1:59:17] have mercy o lord right sighing and
[1:59:20] crying
[1:59:21] for the abominations but hallelujah
[1:59:24] my brother phineas hey man he said
[1:59:27] there's something i
[1:59:28] not going to allow beopiore has
[1:59:31] destroyed
[1:59:32] our message amen that's joining together
[1:59:35] this worship together we're all one
[1:59:37] we can draw ourselves together oh this
[1:59:40] is so beautiful
[1:59:41] my brother and sister it come to the
[1:59:43] point that that was there that's what
[1:59:45] was happening there
[1:59:46] but this came a real personal thing and
[1:59:48] phineas
[1:59:49] he didn't sit back and say you know what
[1:59:51] i think the pastor will take care of it
[1:59:52] i think this will take care of it
[1:59:54] we'll let god take care of it the
[1:59:55] anointing of the holy ghost come upon
[1:59:57] him
[1:59:58] and when he saw that man come right
[2:00:00] through the midst of the people
[2:00:01] inside of a prophet amen you know what
[2:00:03] my brother sister now this might seem
[2:00:05] like a different statement but i hope
[2:00:07] you catch the context of it
[2:00:08] this message the prophet of god is still
[2:00:11] on the
[2:00:12] scene are you with me he's still on the
[2:00:15] scene
[2:00:16] these words that he spoke are the life
[2:00:19] that god spoke
[2:00:20] through him and so as a messenger
[2:00:24] he is still on the scene through the
[2:00:27] message he was called to deliver
[2:00:29] there's not here in a physical form and
[2:00:31] we do not expect to see him
[2:00:32] until the resurrection but my brother
[2:00:34] and sister is still
[2:00:36] here this is the word that god used him
[2:00:39] for and that word is a living word and
[2:00:42] the messenger that brought it was
[2:00:43] sanctified to handle
[2:00:45] right off the altar of god and bring the
[2:00:47] word to you and i that would cleanse us
[2:00:50] now somebody will say oh brother paul's
[2:00:52] in some weird doctrine no if you can't
[2:00:54] get that you need to go study your
[2:00:55] message
[2:00:56] amen so it's still alive just like the
[2:00:58] gospel of paul still alive
[2:01:00] amen every one of those gospels and
[2:01:02] through the ages my brother and sister
[2:01:04] the very words that jesus spoke on the
[2:01:06] road to emmaus now if you want another
[2:01:08] sign of it they're proven brother
[2:01:09] branham talks about this
[2:01:10] that every word that was spoken is still
[2:01:12] out here in the atmosphere
[2:01:14] amen right if that don't get any more
[2:01:16] real to you than that
[2:01:18] amen radio waves is a proof of that tv
[2:01:20] you know
[2:01:21] proof of that hallelujah amen
[2:01:25] so we look he comes brings this
[2:01:27] midianite woman parades her
[2:01:29] right through the midst of the people
[2:01:32] right through the midst
[2:01:33] of the church and says hey look the
[2:01:36] church has got lacks enough
[2:01:38] come on saints are you with me no bro
[2:01:41] paul you're putting a spin on it well
[2:01:42] let me put a spin on it you throw it
[2:01:43] away later
[2:01:45] that's it the churches got so lacks
[2:01:49] we can do what we want to do and
[2:01:50] nobody's going to say a word about it
[2:01:53] we're going to just waltz our cute
[2:01:54] little midianite girl
[2:01:56] right down through the midst of the
[2:01:57] church because nobody's going to do
[2:01:59] anything
[2:02:00] but what they didn't know is times and
[2:02:02] seasons and god said the time
[2:02:04] for this to be alive in the midst of
[2:02:06] israel of the bride of christ is over
[2:02:09] amen something happened that day he
[2:02:11] didn't get the memo
[2:02:13] and he waltzes her right down there and
[2:02:14] walks her right through i don't mean to
[2:02:16] be crass
[2:02:16] walks are right through the flap of the
[2:02:18] tent amen and now look
[2:02:20] brother and sister here again i don't
[2:02:21] mean to be crass but he'll tell you
[2:02:24] and and so here's phineas i'm just all
[2:02:26] wowed up here sorry

[2:02:30] priest saw and he rose up from among the
[2:02:32] congregation

[2:02:35] in after the man of israel in the tent
[2:02:37] and thrust them uh both of them through
[2:02:39] amen that means one was on top of the
[2:02:41] other already i don't mean to be crass
[2:02:42] but they they were they were they were
[2:02:44] doing their thing they were
[2:02:46] whatever amen and he goes in there
[2:02:49] amen through the man of israel through
[2:02:52] the woman through her belly so the

[2:03:35] need to bow to the altar of some other
[2:03:37] god
[2:03:38] in the name of unity
[2:03:42] now some people say brother paul you're
[2:03:44] harsh no i'm a realist
[2:03:46] amen i want to take you right back
[2:03:50] prophet of god said those spirits don't
[2:03:52] die
[2:03:54] hallelujah sister emmy come before i go
[2:03:57] to part two
[2:03:59] hallelujah while she's coming we're
[2:04:02] going to go through this real quick
[2:04:04] god this is speaking of jesus christ so
[2:04:06] you'll understand
[2:04:09] god then what was he doing what is that
[2:04:12] attraction up there on the hill
[2:04:14] it's god making history god fulfilling
[2:04:16] prophecy
[2:04:17] and that always causes an attraction
[2:04:19] that brings all the critics up the
[2:04:20] vultures
[2:04:21] now look at this when i read this it
[2:04:23] just stunned me
[2:04:25] parentheses the prophet of god said of
[2:04:28] this morning's message
[2:04:32] he was dealing with the same spirits
[2:04:35] he was dealing with the same thing
[2:04:38] but we have our exemption card that
[2:04:40] allows us to go past
[2:04:42] go and collect 200 right no sorry
[2:04:46] we're pure he was persecuted meaning our
[2:04:48] lord jesus
[2:04:49] will be persecuted we should be saying
[2:04:52] thank you that i could be
[2:04:53] persecuted for your sake it brings all
[2:04:56] the critics up the vultures of this
[2:04:57] morning's message
[2:04:58] i'm sure there'll be a few critics of
[2:05:00] this morning's message
[2:05:02] and the eagles also see they come
[2:05:03] together to find out what's going on
[2:05:05] some come for curiosity some come to
[2:05:06] find fault others coming to criticize
[2:05:08] there's all kinds gathered as we said
[2:05:10] this morning believers make believers
[2:05:11] unbelievers
[2:05:12] what's on the mountain prophecy
[2:05:15] is being fulfilled now we'll see what
[2:05:19] takes place
[2:05:20] now in the book of zechariah in the
[2:05:21] ninth chapter ninth verse zechariah one
[2:05:23] of the prophets spoke in the spirit
[2:05:25] saying this
[2:05:25] rejoice greatly o daughters of zion
[2:05:27] shadow daughters of jerusalem behold thy
[2:05:29] king cometh unto thee
[2:05:31] he is just having salvation lowly riding
[2:05:33] upon an ass
[2:05:34] upon the fall the cult the full of an
[2:05:37] ass
[2:05:40] now what was the matter with those
[2:05:42] scribes what was the matter with those
[2:05:44] priests what was the matter with those
[2:05:46] religious people
[2:05:47] this was wrote 487 years before it
[2:05:50] happened by a vindicated prophet
[2:05:52] and was already put into writings called
[2:05:54] the bible
[2:05:55] the scrolls of the old testament why
[2:05:56] couldn't they see
[2:05:59] that that's prophecy being fulfilled
[2:06:03] why saints the same reason
[2:06:07] they can't see it today
[2:06:10] they had took the word of god and made
[2:06:12] it non-effect
[2:06:14] to the people and i i'm not closing this
[2:06:17] negative note saints but i'm telling you
[2:06:20] it's happening today
[2:06:22] this message is being made non-effect to
[2:06:25] the people
[2:06:27] god help me as long as there's breath in
[2:06:29] this body and i'm pastor of this church
[2:06:31] this message will be alive and well that
[2:06:34] it will have an effect
[2:06:36] by teaching for traditions the doctrine
[2:06:39] the traditions of man
[2:06:41] and if scribe preachers ministers
[2:06:43] spiritual man so-called
[2:06:45] anointed ones would only read the bible
[2:06:47] they wouldn't be wondering
[2:06:49] what's taking place they would know what
[2:06:52] it is
[2:06:53] god fulfilling his word
[2:06:58] hallelujah now i've got some other
[2:07:00] commentary but
[2:07:01] can i just read this scripture let's
[2:07:03] stand and let's just read this scripture
[2:07:04] here
[2:07:06] i believe this is a lovely scripture it
[2:07:08] stirs my
[2:07:09] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[2:07:12] the lord
[2:07:14] and he delighteth in his way
[2:07:17] though he fall my brother and sister do
[2:07:21] you understand
[2:07:22] it wasn't oh i hope you see that
[2:07:27] it wasn't that they made mistakes at
[2:07:31] baal pure
[2:07:33] but the scripture says they joined it
[2:07:36] they didn't make a mistake they made a
[2:07:39] conscious
[2:07:40] decision to embrace
[2:07:44] what midian
[2:07:48] moabites a good old moabite church first
[2:07:51] church of the moabites
[2:07:55] had quotes of abram
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:06] wow
[2:08:09] though he fall that means make a mistake
[2:08:12] he shall not be utterly cast down for
[2:08:14] the lord upholdeth him
[2:08:17] with his hand do you feel his hand this
[2:08:19] morning i tell you every day of my life
[2:08:21] i feel his hand
[2:08:22] it's around me i make sense i make
[2:08:24] enough mistakes to fill a bus
[2:08:27] but i see god's mercy and there's
[2:08:28] something i mean to boast i know i'm
[2:08:30] saying it as a boaster
[2:08:31] there's something that's real to me and
[2:08:33] that is i say sorry lord forgive me lord
[2:08:35] a lot of times a day
[2:08:37] sometimes when i want to jump out of a
[2:08:39] chopper and choke somebody i
[2:08:41] i don't i don't i don't
[2:08:44] but i think it
[2:08:48] and even though i thought it and you
[2:08:49] wouldn't know it except for i told you
[2:08:51] about it
[2:08:52] i still stop and i say oh god forgive me
[2:08:55] forgive me keep me tender lord
[2:08:58] keep me so tender lord
[2:09:03] because you see my brother and sister
[2:09:04] you just look around
[2:09:06] can i give you can i share a hint with
[2:09:08] you
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:14] if it's you in the mirror or someone
[2:09:18] else when you find a christian with a
[2:09:20] hard shell
[2:09:23] something's wrong you find a preacher
[2:09:26] with a hard shell
[2:09:32] i remember from my youth sitting in a
[2:09:34] service
[2:09:37] the preacher's saying y'all don't repent
[2:09:41] i'm gonna write your name on this board
[2:09:45] saints i don't say this as humorous
[2:09:48] nature hard not imploring them if you're
[2:09:52] sinning
[2:09:53] if you're not doing right come to the
[2:09:55] altar come to christ
[2:09:57] threatening hard
[2:10:01] and i look back and i say lord why
[2:10:03] didn't i have courage enough to jump up
[2:10:04] and say start with your sons
[2:10:08] [Music]
[2:10:12] but i was timid i didn't want to be
[2:10:14] ashamed i didn't want to be rejected i
[2:10:16] didn't want to
[2:10:17] do it so i just went with the flow and
[2:10:20] i it happened to be a flow of lemmings
[2:10:23] and we all just marched off a cliff into
[2:10:25] the antarctic
[2:10:27] into the arctic ocean because everyone
[2:10:29] else is doing it
[2:10:31] everyone in the message we know is doing
[2:10:33] it let's find it
[2:10:34] just find a message that everyone is at
[2:10:37] the altar
[2:10:37] crying out to god fill me lord fill me
[2:10:40] lord let's find another example let's
[2:10:42] find another something to look up to
[2:10:43] to find those that are saying lord fill
[2:10:45] us with the holy ghost lord we need you
[2:10:47] we want you lord
[2:10:48] look to a different example if your
[2:10:50] example is something that's empty and
[2:10:52] angry and hard over here
[2:10:54] look to a different example hallelujah
[2:10:57] oh hallelujah oh

[2:11:07] oh the steps of a good man are ordered
[2:11:10] by the lord he delighteth in his way
[2:11:12] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[2:11:13] cast down
[2:11:14] for the lord upholdeth him with his hand
[2:11:17] i have been young
[2:11:19] and now am old yet have i not
[2:11:22] seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed
[2:11:26] begging bread he is ever merciful

[2:14:29] the season of love the time of love
[2:14:31] generation of love

[2:14:38] perversion a next generation
[2:14:41] that raised the next generation that
[2:14:44] raised a generation
[2:14:45] that's burning down their cities
[2:14:48] according
[2:14:49] to the scripture oh hallelujah

[2:17:56] [Music]
[2:18:03] hallelujah
[2:18:04] [Music]
[2:18:07] i just want to close my thoughts saints
[2:18:09] with this
[2:18:14] i don't believe in preaching what's
[2:18:17] wrong
[2:18:18] in the message is the answer i believe
[2:18:20] we preach
[2:18:22] what is right i don't
[2:18:25] believe in spending all our time
[2:18:30] saying don't do this don't fellowship
[2:18:33] there and don't partake in that and
[2:18:35] don't
[2:18:35] don't don't i don't believe in that but
[2:18:38] there comes a time saints in a season
[2:18:41] the prophet of god said these things
[2:18:43] would come in a full circle
[2:18:45] as it was in the beginning scriptural
[2:18:47] right as it was in the beginning so
[2:18:49] shall it be at the end
[2:18:51] this has come a full circle
[2:18:54] and i believe just uh shared this story
[2:18:56] with you the other day you see a coyote
[2:18:58] in the pasture and you sit back and
[2:19:00] watch it kill a sheep
[2:19:01] [Music]
[2:19:02] can you say well god's in control
[2:19:05] no if i've offended anyone
[2:19:09] forgive me it was not my intent
[2:19:13] but my intent my brother and sister is
[2:19:16] to point out the fact
[2:19:18] that the holy ghost unity by bringing
[2:19:21] the bride
[2:19:22] back to the word amen which is christ
[2:19:25] himself
[2:19:27] and when we come back in that all of our
[2:19:29] differences i might have a difference
[2:19:31] with you
[2:19:32] all of our differences are then settled
[2:19:35] because we're both embracing the word
[2:19:39] hallelujah a false sense of if we're
[2:19:42] going to be real message believers
[2:19:44] the prophet said oh my brother and
[2:19:47] sister we can say
[2:19:48] the prophet said but jesus said
[2:19:52] if you love me do my commandments
[2:19:56] and if you can prove to me the prophet
[2:19:58] said something different
[2:20:00] i'll stand corrected
[2:20:03] but you won't find it you can't find it
[2:20:08] because the scripture says change one
[2:20:10] word
[2:20:11] there's curse upon you this word that
[2:20:14] god brought to us
[2:20:16] you realize that same jesus that same
[2:20:19] one that stood in the midst of the
[2:20:20] candlesticks
[2:20:23] is here this morning
[2:20:26] he cannot contradict himself
[2:20:30] oh hallelujah i love you i feel a little
[2:20:32] bit
[2:20:33] bad on one side that i kept you so long
[2:20:36] but now it's off my chest
[2:20:38] hallelujah i love you so much saints i
[2:20:40] want to i want to be in the rapture with
[2:20:42] each one of you i want to
[2:20:43] sit there at the marriage supper across
[2:20:45] the table from you
[2:20:46] and talk of all the things we never had
[2:20:49] time to talk of here
[2:20:50] and to worship together it's my heart's
[2:20:54] cry
[2:20:56] it's it's all that
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:10] it's all that there is to live for
[2:21:14] that's all that's real without that we
[2:21:18] have nothing
[2:21:19] it's life is a vapor an empty shell
[2:21:23] but it is real it is so real
[2:21:28] it just is that day on the side of a
[2:21:30] mountain
