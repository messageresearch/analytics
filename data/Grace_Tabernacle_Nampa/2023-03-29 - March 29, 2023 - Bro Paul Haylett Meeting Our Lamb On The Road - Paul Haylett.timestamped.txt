[35:00] very nice I just appreciated the song
[35:02] service the musicians the Lord has
[35:06] blessed us amen
[35:07] you know I was just sharing with brother
[35:09] Chris in the back that I have lately
[35:11] just very much enjoyed ministering on
[35:15] Wednesday nights it's uh it's been not a
[35:18] great deep Revelation but just as I'm
[35:21] studying looking through the word
[35:23] thinking about as it was what happened
[35:25] when Jesus was traveling the roads what
[35:28] happened not when he was preaching in
[35:30] the synagogue and not when he was there
[35:32] amongst all of the deity minded people
[35:35] that they were so important
[35:38] but he went out and just went down the
[35:40] highway
[35:42] the byway the past the trails
[35:45] and
[35:47] did it just happen
[35:50] no
[35:53] every appointment
[35:54] our lord Jesus has ever made
[35:57] he's kept amen amen and even when we
[36:01] didn't think that something would happen
[36:06] God's there amen all the time
[36:09] I want to title tonight's thought
[36:11] meeting our Lamb on the road
[36:15] and let's turn in Mark 10
[36:18] . amen isn't it wonderful we can be out
[36:20] on the road whether it be traveling I
[36:23] was thinking today that caused my
[36:26] thoughts to go to brother vasili brother
[36:28] Sergey
[36:29] my brother and sister I know the years
[36:32] then I drove a truck every winter
[36:35] I listened to more tapes driving a truck
[36:37] than I probably did it any other time of
[36:39] my life
[36:40] because while I don't want to make truck
[36:42] driving sound like we just keep it
[36:44] between two lines and try and not run
[36:46] over the little cars uh it is still
[36:49] endless miles
[36:51] endless miles
[36:53] and I just remember those times of
[36:55] putting the player on Loop and sometimes
[36:59] listen to the same sermon four five six
[37:02] times in one day
[37:04] and hearing every time something I
[37:07] didn't hear before
[37:10] now to me that's God who is rich in
[37:13] Mercy amen because he didn't want us to
[37:16] just catch the cliches
[37:18] sometimes we get a little judgmental
[37:20] about cliches right well that's just a
[37:22] cliche is it
[37:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[37:26] and forever I pray never becomes a
[37:28] cliche
[37:30] I pray that it is so real to us that we
[37:32] get up in the morning knowing my God is
[37:35] here today and what he did for Enoch
[37:38] he's doing for me amen and just to hold
[37:43] that and so is I I've been studying here
[37:46] and I'm jumping a little bit out of
[37:47] order today because we'll see and we'll
[37:50] catch that scripture in Mark 10 but
[37:52] we're seeing that Jesus on the road up
[37:54] to Jerusalem and he's testifying to the
[37:58] disciples
[37:59] of what's going to happen
[38:01] but there was something else
[38:03] and I say I'm out of work
[38:05] with our lord Jesus traveling amen let's
[38:09] turn Mark 10 verse 46 to 52.
[38:14] and they came to Jericho and as he went
[38:17] out of Jericho with his disciples and a
[38:20] great number of people blind Bartimaeus
[38:22] the son of timis set by the highway side
[38:25] begging
[38:27] and when he heard that it was Jesus of
[38:30] Nazareth he began to cry out and say
[38:32] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
[38:37] and many charged him that he should hold
[38:40] his peace but he cried the more a great
[38:43] deal thou son of David have mercy on me
[38:48] and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him
[38:51] to be called and they called the blind
[38:55] man saying unto him be of good Comfort
[38:57] rise he calleth thee and he casting away
[39:01] His Garment Rose and came to Jesus and
[39:05] Jesus answered said unto him what will
[39:08] thou that I should do unto thee Endless
[39:12] Possibilities there
[39:14] the blind man said unto him Lord that I
[39:18] might receive
[39:20] my sight and I just want to say tonight
[39:23] Saints
[39:27] as I preached this to myself
[39:29] today
[39:30] in the shop by myself
[39:33] working
[39:35] had a little Revival
[39:38] now I don't have perfect eyesight but
[39:40] with glasses I
[39:41] couldn't see 2020.
[39:44] but tonight I would lift my hands in my
[39:46] heart and say Lord
[39:53] I can be so blind
[39:56] Lord I want to receive my sights
[39:59] I want to see you as you are
[40:03] I don't want to see myself in you as you
[40:06] see me in you
[40:08] Lord I want to receive my sight tonight
[40:12] I'm going to receive from you like I've
[40:14] never seen amen before
[40:17] now excuse me for being emotional but
[40:19] I've just had a little Jubilee in the
[40:21] shop by myself today because there's
[40:24] things in my life sometimes that I just
[40:26] think how pardon me for putting it this
[40:28] way but I think how could I be so stupid
[40:32] how could I have done and said and you
[40:36] know what I'm saying
[40:38] Lord I just want
[40:42] I just wonder Saints if
[40:46] Bartimaeus
[40:49] had a little deeper meaning
[40:52] in his life
[40:54] than just natural eyesight a little
[40:56] deeper there's something we'll touch on
[40:59] this if I get going here
[41:03] what will now that I should do unto thee
[41:06] and the blind man said unto him Lord
[41:07] that I might receive my sight and Jesus
[41:10] said unto him go thy way thy faith had
[41:12] made thee whole
[41:14] see this is the part of why saints that
[41:16] I think something more happened because
[41:18] whenever our lord Jesus ever told people
[41:23] that they were made whole
[41:26] he was not always dealing in the flesh
[41:33] here again I say Lord I want to receive
[41:35] my sight tonight but even more than
[41:37] receiving my sight tonight Lord Jesus I
[41:40] want to be made whole
[41:42] I I want I want all
[41:45] I want all the word that you have given
[41:48] for me
[41:50] be completely whole amen Heavenly Father
[41:53] we thank you tonight for your grace your
[41:55] mercy
[41:55] Lord we thank you for our brothers and
[41:58] sisters have traveled so far
[42:00] those Lord tonight are not with us we
[42:03] just want to remember
[42:06] Lord we just ask for your blessings upon
[42:09] this service tonight
[42:10] the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[42:14] seated
[42:19] now we see Jesus is as the scripture
[42:22] said on the road out of Jericho and he's
[42:25] on his way to Jerusalem if we'll turn to
[42:27] Mark 10 we'll just go back 10 and 32
[42:30] we'll go back and catch just a couple
[42:32] scriptures that is there now we see that
[42:35] they were in the way going up to
[42:36] Jerusalem and Jesus went before them and
[42:39] they were amazed and as they followed
[42:41] they were afraid and he took again the
[42:43] twelve and began to tell them what
[42:45] things should happen unto him and my
[42:47] brother and sister will see that what he
[42:50] was speaking to the disciples they were
[42:52] not comprehending they were not
[42:54] believing that it would be possible that
[42:57] uh our lord Jesus would come to a
[43:01] crucifixion that he would lay his life
[43:03] down it was hard for them to Father they
[43:07] knew that there was many people who
[43:09] didn't like him and and had ought
[43:10] against him but still the struggle and
[43:13] the supernatural that was taking place
[43:15] but look at this is saying behold we go
[43:18] up to Jerusalem and the son son of man
[43:20] shall be delivered into the chief
[43:22] priests and unto the scribes and they
[43:24] shall condemn him to death and shall
[43:26] deliver him to the Gentiles and they
[43:28] shall mock him and shall Scourge him and
[43:31] shall spit upon him and they shall and
[43:33] shall kill him in the third day he shall
[43:36] rise again now this thought I wanted to
[43:39] bring as we're coming up into the Easter
[43:41] time here I wanted to kind of tie this
[43:44] together my brother and sister as as we
[43:46] move towards this we we look at this of
[43:49] what is happening God said everything
[43:51] perfectly in order amen so the time that
[43:55] he traveled the throughout Israel the
[43:58] time that he testified and there was
[44:01] healings Deliverance opening of the word
[44:03] was all culminating here in this time
[44:06] and I know this might sound a little
[44:08] strange if you'll forgive me for this
[44:10] way of putting it but it was all leading
[44:13] to the day that they would crucify him
[44:15] but my brother and sister this is just
[44:18] the as far as I'll go in my prelim to
[44:20] this my brother and sister he didn't go
[44:23] to Calvary and he didn't go because he
[44:26] needed to see or needed to have
[44:29] Redemption power
[44:31] he was Redemption power
[44:36] and all that was in Christ was poured
[44:38] into
[44:40] the church
[44:42] we have Redemption power
[44:48] and we have Resurrection
[44:50] power
[44:55] was he proving that he could do it
[44:57] no actually it's an interesting topic
[45:00] when you think about that the near
[45:01] Kinsmen which was Satan
[45:04] was afraid he would mess up his
[45:05] inheritance because he wasn't about to
[45:07] let himself die
[45:09] to see if he could raise again
[45:15] oh you say brother Paul you mixed up two
[45:17] scriptures no same story
[45:19] one in type
[45:21] one in reality
[45:23] now we look at this my brother and
[45:25] sister and realize that as as Jesus is
[45:27] going along out of Jericho
[45:30] he's moving along there with his
[45:32] disciples as a host of people and there
[45:35] was a great talmult as there and and
[45:38] they're they're looking uh many people
[45:40] uh the voices my brother and sister many
[45:44] voices praising him but there was also
[45:47] the voices the jeers and the shouts of
[45:49] the critics and my brother and sister
[45:51] just as it was that he was going for the
[45:54] first crucifixion the prophet of God
[45:56] indicts our generation for the second
[45:58] crucifixion of Christ and we see that
[46:01] it's come to a time that it is okay to
[46:04] shout and to jeer as it were to spit
[46:07] upon my brother and sister all of the
[46:10] prophecy concerning our day it is just a
[46:13] mere image of that day brought into our
[46:16] time for us and so it's there that uh
[46:19] Bartimaeus my brother and sister there
[46:21] was nothing he could do to change his
[46:24] physical need he's now a blind man and
[46:27] as we'll touch on here if in a moment
[46:30] moment he's a blind man and he has been
[46:33] reduced to a position of being a beggar
[46:36] and I I know I can't hardly fathom that
[46:39] well uh what it would be like not able
[46:43] to live a normal life but as we uh we'll
[46:45] touch in a minute the prophet of God
[46:47] talks about his wife and his daughter so
[46:50] we'll look at this and realize here's a
[46:52] man doing now all he can do to to bring
[46:56] a living to bring a a a a support into
[46:59] his household and he's been reduced to
[47:02] begging and I don't know if you guys
[47:04] have ever really been super up close to
[47:07] to Beggars I don't know that you you
[47:10] know have I I don't know your stories
[47:12] but you know you go to South America you
[47:14] go to Argentina you go to Chile uh and
[47:17] and uh in Chile they're they're
[47:19] everywhere and the panhandling people
[47:21] and they will stand in the street you
[47:24] will literally drive up to a stoplight
[47:26] and the guy will come from the side and
[47:30] talented they'll be out there with balls
[47:32] or even little miniature bowling pin
[47:35] looking things and they're juggling and
[47:37] they're doing all of this thing to your
[47:39] attention and when the light is ready to
[47:41] change I don't know how they know it's
[47:42] so perfect but when the light's ready to
[47:45] change they stop that they whip out
[47:47] their deal and they go to your window
[47:48] hoping to receive a payment
[47:51] and they can become quite angry if you
[47:54] don't support them
[47:55] others will come and they will spray
[47:58] your window down and wash your window
[48:00] and then act like you're obligated hey I
[48:03] washed your window pay me I never ask
[48:06] you to wash the window but yet there's
[48:08] something of a compassion in the human
[48:10] element that we would come and say well
[48:12] okay God has blessed us we'll we'll do
[48:16] this and and you know it's there and
[48:18] they use you might say all kinds of
[48:20] vices they will have their children with
[48:23] them they'll have things or what appears
[48:25] to be their children and they're just
[48:27] trying to get that but here's Bartimaeus
[48:30] at a time of his life that has been
[48:32] reduced to a beggar and it's nothing
[48:35] that he can change and as the day is
[48:39] coming my brother and sister there's a
[48:42] throne coming down the road no one made
[48:44] a public announcement that Jesus was
[48:46] coming but there is a great Toma it's a
[48:49] great noise coming up the road to him
[48:51] and brother Branham if you'll study this
[48:53] out you'll see brother Branham talks
[48:55] about well there there's a young lady
[48:56] there and he asked her and says now now
[48:59] what's going on well it's Jesus from
[49:02] Nazareth and he says oh my uh you know I
[49:05] I want to see him I want to and it's
[49:08] there that he talks about brother Brown
[49:10] lays it out that this friend
[49:13] this Friend helps him
[49:15] now my brother and sister we realize
[49:18] that this time this noise going on this
[49:21] deafening sound that is there and so
[49:25] verse 47 is we'll just touch on those
[49:27] not to reread them all but he hears that
[49:29] it's Jesus and he begins to cry out he
[49:32] doesn't just say well if by chance he
[49:35] would come to my side of the road if by
[49:37] chance he would he would notice me or if
[49:40] there would be something that would
[49:42] happen but there was something down in
[49:44] his heart that was in such dire need of
[49:47] a touch from God that he starts to cry
[49:50] out now the prophet of God I'm not going
[49:53] to read all these quotes but I'm just
[49:54] going to preach it to you the prophet of
[49:56] God says that it was there such a large
[49:59] crowd crowd so noisy that Jesus could
[50:03] not have possibly heard him now remember
[50:07] I was speaking to you last Wednesday of
[50:09] Jesus crossing over the sea to hear the
[50:13] hearts Cry of a wild man among amongst
[50:16] the tombs of gadera now there is no
[50:19] possible way that our lord Jesus could
[50:21] hear that but he heard it in the spirit
[50:23] he heard this now I want you to catch
[50:25] this that that man that is there amongst
[50:28] the tombs is so possessed by demons they
[50:31] control his body and they control his
[50:34] voice but I'm here to tell you when the
[50:36] seed of God is down in the soul of a son
[50:39] or daughter of God there's no way Satan
[50:42] can shut down the voice of the Cry of a
[50:46] son or daughter of God
[50:47] there's no way he might possess the body
[50:50] he might possess the the the the voice
[50:53] might possess the eyeballs the hands all
[50:56] of that but he cannot control the voice
[51:00] of the seed and so the seed was there
[51:03] and here I want to take that as a time
[51:06] so here is Bartimaeus and he is crying
[51:10] out amen oh thou son of David but the
[51:14] crowd is so loud whether they're
[51:16] praising or whether they're shouting in
[51:18] derision the crowd is so loud there's no
[51:21] possible way
[51:25] thank you Lord
[51:29] very good
[51:31] when it seemed like there's nothing
[51:35] we can do
[51:37] and our voice cannot be heard
[51:42] he hears
[51:45] oh I tell you we ought to be saying
[51:47] thank you Lord
[51:49] thank you Lord some Midnight Hour
[51:53] if you should find
[51:55] you're in a prison in your mind
[52:01] but the crowd was telling him be quiet
[52:03] be quiet be quiet because you crying out
[52:06] makes no difference I'm here to tell you
[52:09] tonight when our hearts start to cry out
[52:12] to our lord Jesus it doesn't matter my
[52:14] brother and sister what we think is
[52:16] going on around us he hears your cry
[52:20] oh and the Cry of a son or daughter of
[52:23] God just like a mother amen I'll take
[52:25] this back to the animal uh nature here
[52:28] my brother and sister you can have 500
[52:30] cows out on the Range in a pasture and a
[52:33] little old calf go to balling over here
[52:35] and that old mama cow puts her head up
[52:38] that's the sound of her calf amen and
[52:42] when Mama starts lowing the baby says
[52:45] that's the sound of my mama and we as
[52:48] humans just say they're making a lot of
[52:49] noise
[52:50] but oh Hallelujah I'm glad my father
[52:53] knows my voice amen not only does he
[52:56] know my voice naturally knows the voice
[52:58] of my soul and when my soul is crying
[53:02] out he knows who I am
[53:05] oh Hallelujah
[53:07] Hallelujah
[53:11] amen this is the believer when Satan
[53:14] would tell you just hold your peace my
[53:16] brother and sister we should be crying
[53:18] out all the louder the minute that Satan
[53:20] says it makes no difference cry out all
[53:23] the louder
[53:24] oh my Hallelujah
[53:27] and he had his Doctrine right now
[53:29] sometimes I can say that we probably do
[53:31] get a little carried away on Doctrine
[53:33] but my brother and sister if we don't
[53:35] have Doctrine we don't have a church
[53:39] come as you are leave as you are
[53:42] that's what that really means when they
[53:44] say Come As You Are
[53:46] they mean you're free to leave as you
[53:47] are
[53:49] God says Come As You Are
[53:51] expect to be changed
[53:54] amen
[53:55] Hallelujah
[53:58] as I said Satan had control of the
[54:01] physical man
[54:02] amen God had control of the seed
[54:08] so
[54:09] speaking of cliches we often hear this
[54:11] deep call to the Deep
[54:13] and if we're not careful we just put
[54:15] that down towards yep yep you can't hear
[54:17] it without a deep coal well I'm telling
[54:20] you my brother and sister that's just
[54:21] not out here to to just anybody
[54:24] everybody
[54:25] that applies to you and I tonight
[54:28] amen why are we responding to the word
[54:31] tonight
[54:33] because there's something inside of us
[54:36] amen it's not just hey we're Christians
[54:38] and this is what we do
[54:40] no my brother and sister we are
[54:43] believers because of the call
[54:48] and we're able to respond to the word
[54:50] because of the call and the call can
[54:53] only respond because the seed has life
[54:57] if you plant a dead seed you are never
[55:00] going to harvest a crop and my brother
[55:02] and sister I've said this many times in
[55:04] the church I'll say it again tonight I
[55:06] believe the Vindication of brother
[55:08] branham's Ministry was not of healings
[55:11] and deliverances I believe the real
[55:14] honest Vindication of his ministry is
[55:17] the fact that the words that God give
[55:19] him to speak have come to pass just
[55:22] exactly as the word said it would come
[55:25] to pass so we are here as it were of the
[55:28] fruit of the ministry that God put
[55:32] through brother Branham and it proved
[55:34] that that was a true voice
[55:36] otherwise it would produce a spirit of
[55:38] denomination
[55:40] amen if denomination creates it then it
[55:43] will produce what it created now let's
[55:46] look at it just real quick I want to
[55:47] insert this my brother and sister those
[55:50] Israelis those Jews those people that
[55:53] were following Moses through the
[55:55] wilderness
[55:58] do you know that their life
[56:01] followed Moses's life
[56:05] and Moses never went in the Promised
[56:08] Land
[56:09] and because they were not following
[56:12] Jehovah
[56:13] they were following Moses
[56:16] they never
[56:18] went to the promised land
[56:21] now that can be taken any way you want
[56:23] to take it my brother and sister but
[56:25] that's why this message this Moses
[56:27] Ministry was absolutely necessary to
[56:31] break things down and put things in
[56:33] place and Elijah Ministry today
[56:35] absolutely necessary to break things
[56:38] down and put it in its right place and
[56:40] those Ministries are true and they are
[56:42] faithful but those Ministries my brother
[56:44] and sister pointed us to who
[56:47] Jesus Christ amen because when that
[56:51] Ministry comes to an end it can stop
[56:54] right there and people will stop with it
[56:56] but when you have caught the revelation
[56:59] of what God sent the ministry for Amen
[57:03] to grasp Jehovah amen has come the
[57:07] prophet of God lays it out Jehovah has
[57:09] come once again and veiled himself in
[57:13] flesh amen and that flesh is here
[57:15] tonight saying Amen to the word
[57:18] believing the word acting on the word
[57:20] holding on to that word now some people
[57:22] that say now brother Paul you're being
[57:25] negative on brother Branham no I'm not
[57:26] because you can look in the message and
[57:28] you will see what the prophet of God
[57:30] said his ministry was for I never called
[57:33] you to myself
[57:35] amen I call the people out to introduce
[57:39] them to Jesus Christ he himself said it
[57:42] amen and so we hold to that now the very
[57:46] words a man that Bartimaeus is actually
[57:49] seen come to pass in his life is not the
[57:52] words that the priests are preaching
[57:54] down in the temple my brother and sister
[57:56] they're preaching their version of it
[57:58] but here is Bartimaeus with a much
[58:01] deeper Revelation than they understand
[58:04] because he is as we'll hit the backstory
[58:07] in a little bit he is there acting on a
[58:10] conviction that God laid on his heart
[58:12] not on the priest's heart
[58:14] he's there responding to God's call to
[58:17] his life to his need his situation a
[58:21] priest didn't tell him go do this
[58:23] because the priest didn't believe in it
[58:25] right but Martinez did
[58:29] and it didn't matter how many critics
[58:31] were in the crowd
[58:33] God said when bartimaeus's Heart Cries
[58:36] Out
[58:39] I'll be there for him
[58:42] Now isn't that amazing
[58:44] people have their ideas predestination
[58:46] God's going to force something to happen
[58:48] no my brother and sister but God knew
[58:50] Bartimaeus was on the road
[58:52] he knew Bartimaeus that Dame was going
[58:55] to be on the road there amen I'll tell
[58:58] you whether he could see Bartimaeus or
[59:00] not whether he could hear Bartimaeus or
[59:02] not he would stop and be able to say
[59:04] bring the blind man
[59:06] because he knew he would be there
[59:09] well do we believe predestination that
[59:12] strongly I personally do
[59:15] I personally do no God did not force me
[59:17] there's something inside of me calling
[59:19] me there's something inside of me
[59:21] telling me I don't belong in this world
[59:23] out here I don't belong in this I belong
[59:26] somewhere else oh how beautiful Heaven
[59:29] Must Be
[59:32] the home
[59:35] I shouldn't I shouldn't make mockery
[59:38] forgive me
[59:42] so brother Brown
[59:44] says here in the message
[59:46] that the noise was too loud
[59:50] huh look at that
[59:52] I misspelled the word the noise was too
[59:54] lowed
[59:55] uh loud the distraction's too great but
[59:59] it wasn't about that anyway it was his
[1:00:01] heart there's where it was it all come
[1:00:04] down to the heart and so God hears that
[1:00:07] heart's cry just as he heard the man
[1:00:10] amongst the tombs he heard a heart's cry
[1:00:12] he hears it here and so that is you know
[1:00:15] the truth of it is that's how we reach
[1:00:17] the master my brother and sister will
[1:00:19] not be about how many quotes we quote of
[1:00:21] the message how well we can quote
[1:00:23] scripture from memory quote a message
[1:00:25] from memory how we can lay everything
[1:00:28] out just not one drop of that's going to
[1:00:30] get us in a rapture the thing that will
[1:00:32] get us in the Rapture is a heart
[1:00:34] completely sold out and committed to God
[1:00:37] Amen a heart that's why we call it
[1:00:39] communion that's when the heart sold out
[1:00:41] and it's one with God
[1:00:45] well I'll tell you what there's a lot of
[1:00:48] avenues could go off of that one right
[1:00:49] there
[1:00:50] now brother Brown's freaks of this
[1:00:52] friend helping now you know it's there
[1:00:55] you think about this
[1:00:57] I'm just going to take a little liberty
[1:00:59] tonight I hope you'll forgive me
[1:01:01] but I believe maybe this friend brother
[1:01:03] Brown was talking about was the one when
[1:01:05] they said bring him
[1:01:06] was maybe the one that when Bartimaeus
[1:01:09] he casts off his cloak and he stands up
[1:01:11] and I believe maybe it was this friend
[1:01:13] that led him to Jesus I tell you we need
[1:01:16] a friend
[1:01:17] I'll tell you in the natural we need a
[1:01:19] friend
[1:01:20] amen but I'll tell you what a friend
[1:01:21] can't do a friend cannot open the word
[1:01:24] to you amen a friend cannot heal you a
[1:01:28] friend cannot take all of these things
[1:01:31] and provide what we need by brother and
[1:01:33] sister but it's there when we look at
[1:01:35] this and realize how dearly we as humans
[1:01:38] need friends
[1:01:40] but you know we can't explain revelation
[1:01:44] we we can't sit here around the coffee
[1:01:46] table
[1:01:48] eating some nice warm bread
[1:01:52] maybe drinking a
[1:01:54] cup of that
[1:01:56] tea or coffee or something
[1:01:59] now let me explain to you
[1:02:02] what the third pull is
[1:02:05] let me explain to you what the Seven
[1:02:07] Seals are or the Thunders or the vials
[1:02:11] I'll tell you what we can do with words
[1:02:13] we can break it down and paint a picture
[1:02:16] right we can we can lay out all the
[1:02:18] foundation of the third pull
[1:02:20] but just because now we can put it on a
[1:02:23] page and line it all up doesn't mean
[1:02:24] it's Revelation to us and you cannot
[1:02:27] explain the Revelation but I tell you we
[1:02:29] do need teachers we do need friends that
[1:02:31] can say well I think this is what you're
[1:02:33] missing right here there's you know
[1:02:35] don't over complicate the seals don't
[1:02:37] over complicate the Thunders don't over
[1:02:40] complicate this stuff it's God in
[1:02:41] Simplicity and now look at it this way
[1:02:43] brother and then a friend will be
[1:02:46] praying for his friend or a friend you
[1:02:48] know for man or woman to to have their
[1:02:51] eyes opened
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:54] that's what friends are good for
[1:02:57] friends are not good for keep doing what
[1:03:00] you're doing
[1:03:01] and you believe God sent a prophet
[1:03:03] you'll make a Rapture that's not a
[1:03:04] friend
[1:03:06] a friend is actually the one that boosts
[1:03:09] you
[1:03:11] to a higher place
[1:03:14] I'll tell you what
[1:03:16] probably should keep this to myself but
[1:03:18] sometimes the boosting is interesting
[1:03:21] sister Jerry and I was in a conversation
[1:03:23] the other day something about real
[1:03:25] estate
[1:03:27] and she just pops out of nowhere the big
[1:03:30] grin on her face
[1:03:32] you wouldn't have made it where you're
[1:03:34] at without me
[1:03:42] and I
[1:03:43] would not have made it where I'm at
[1:03:46] without you
[1:03:53] hmm
[1:03:56] I'm going to say that God divinely
[1:03:58] placed that friend right there
[1:04:01] as no one else was paying attention
[1:04:03] paying attention to Bartimaeus
[1:04:05] the friend when he said what's happening
[1:04:08] was there to say it's Jesus
[1:04:13] you need Jesus
[1:04:17] you need Jesus
[1:04:18] I'm here
[1:04:20] to lead you to Jesus
[1:04:23] we all need a friend like that we need a
[1:04:26] friend that's not ashamed to say I can
[1:04:28] take you to Jesus I can introduce you I
[1:04:31] cannot explain the revelation of the son
[1:04:33] of man or the son of David but I can
[1:04:36] come and I can introduce you and I can
[1:04:39] give you something to pray about
[1:04:41] something to look at something to look
[1:04:43] forward to
[1:04:45] oh I'll tell you what thank God for
[1:04:48] friends
[1:04:49] but something was happening my brother
[1:04:51] and sister that the crowd knew nothing
[1:04:52] about
[1:04:54] it's there as it is too far to touch
[1:04:56] physically now let's look at how God
[1:04:58] works in this case we see the man
[1:05:02] amongst the tombs way too far
[1:05:06] to be touched physically
[1:05:10] and we see here now that Bartimaeus is
[1:05:13] on the side of the road and the throng
[1:05:15] is surrounded Jesus and it's moving
[1:05:17] along with this loud noise and it's
[1:05:20] there that it's too far to touch but God
[1:05:23] chose a woman with a blood issue to not
[1:05:27] let her stand on the edge of the crowd
[1:05:29] this is why we should never stereotype
[1:05:31] what God is doing with each individual
[1:05:33] and so there God said it's not going to
[1:05:36] be enough for her to stand on the edge
[1:05:39] of the crowd and believe that God was
[1:05:41] here Jesus was there to heal her but
[1:05:44] what does God do he anoints her oh God
[1:05:46] help us to have this kind of Courage
[1:05:48] also to come and move and push through
[1:05:51] the crowd imagine what people were like
[1:05:53] I was this rude person just crawled
[1:05:55] between my legs and you just shoved me
[1:05:57] excuse you and she's going cause nothing
[1:05:59] was going to stop her from getting up
[1:06:01] there and touching the Hem of that
[1:06:03] garment oh my brother and sister the
[1:06:06] prophet chose us so clearly it was not
[1:06:08] the touch but it was her soul drawing
[1:06:12] virtue amen not touching the cloth as
[1:06:15] people today when Pope takes his trip
[1:06:17] and walks through the public and they
[1:06:19] all want to touch him they're going to
[1:06:21] get something from touching that robe my
[1:06:23] brother and sister it's not touching but
[1:06:26] it is the soul coming and drawing from
[1:06:30] the virtue of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:06:33] the word says that we can touch him by
[1:06:35] the feeling of our infirmities we can
[1:06:37] touch him by our need is it just because
[1:06:39] I'm sick I have a physical need I can
[1:06:42] touch him no it's a heart's cry and it
[1:06:45] transcends time and distance and will
[1:06:47] touch him no matter where we're at in a
[1:06:49] hole in the ground working in a truck
[1:06:51] working in an office building working
[1:06:53] whatever it is we can touch him
[1:06:56] and the power of God comes but I'll tell
[1:06:58] you what it takes more than just saying
[1:07:00] oh I think this will be I was just
[1:07:03] reading brother Branham was talking and
[1:07:05] and there is there is a a minister in
[1:07:08] the audience
[1:07:10] and he says now you brother Minister
[1:07:12] brother right there
[1:07:16] Lay Your Hand
[1:07:18] on that lady next to you
[1:07:24] her spirit's crying out
[1:07:28] Lay Your Hand pray God will heal her
[1:07:36] how it is you'd be sitting by there
[1:07:39] me
[1:07:42] you want meat meat
[1:07:46] but the man was Minister I just have to
[1:07:49] believe that
[1:07:51] he said there it is
[1:07:54] and that lady's healed
[1:07:57] God didn't say no
[1:07:59] I just need to raise up all kinds of
[1:08:01] great people
[1:08:03] sometimes he just raises up
[1:08:06] friend
[1:08:07] and the friends there don't give up
[1:08:10] keep pressing on it keep I'm praying I'm
[1:08:13] praying with you this circumstance in
[1:08:14] your life your family your health
[1:08:16] whatever it might be
[1:08:17] I'm praying with you what are we doing
[1:08:20] we're actually I hope you follow me
[1:08:22] we're actually leading them
[1:08:24] to Jesus amen
[1:08:27] when they're down and they're
[1:08:28] discouraged and they might have just
[1:08:30] said on the side of the road and said
[1:08:32] I'm Bartimaeus and I'm blind I'm a
[1:08:34] beggar
[1:08:36] who am I
[1:08:40] but friends I care
[1:08:42] Jesus stops
[1:08:43] and he calls for him to come
[1:08:46] and people said my
[1:08:49] you know
[1:08:50] be of good Comfort he he calls he's
[1:08:53] calling you of all these people
[1:08:55] oh I want you to catch this tonight
[1:08:57] Saints of all these people all these
[1:09:01] people he's calling you he's calling you
[1:09:05] he didn't call the whole crowd he didn't
[1:09:07] call all the disciples and all of
[1:09:09] Jericho he called Bartimaeus and we are
[1:09:14] here in an earth that is now numbered in
[1:09:16] billions and he called us out of that
[1:09:20] oh how glorious I thank you Lord
[1:09:24] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:09:26] oh my
[1:09:29] you know here it is
[1:09:30] there are some there though
[1:09:32] that are encouraging Bartimaeus and the
[1:09:35] beautiful thing about it is he responds
[1:09:37] and I tell you one of the most beautiful
[1:09:39] things that we can do as Sons and
[1:09:40] Daughters of God here again going back
[1:09:42] it's not a matter of explaining all the
[1:09:45] message explaining all scripture
[1:09:47] cross-referencing tying it together one
[1:09:49] of the most beautiful things in this
[1:09:51] message is a bride who is responding to
[1:09:53] the voice of Her bridegroom
[1:09:55] amen she is hearing his call in this
[1:09:59] hour and she's living what he asked her
[1:10:02] to live and has empowered her to live
[1:10:04] I'll tell you what how blessed we are
[1:10:06] when we listen and respond
[1:10:08] amen you know sometimes as married
[1:10:11] people we get bad habits amen sister
[1:10:14] Jerry will send me a text or maybe be
[1:10:16] I'll be in the same room and she'll ask
[1:10:18] a question and in my mind I'm saying yes
[1:10:20] no maybe whatever but I never ever give
[1:10:24] an actual response
[1:10:27] I tell you that spirit's crept into the
[1:10:29] church where God speaks to our hearts
[1:10:31] and we're like yeah yep that's right I
[1:10:34] need a change
[1:10:35] but it all took place
[1:10:38] not here
[1:10:40] it took place right here
[1:10:43] and that is not a response
[1:10:46] well it's looking for a response Saints
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:50] so you know his request as we already
[1:10:52] touched on sorry I'm going to kind of be
[1:10:54] circling back a little bit but you know
[1:10:56] he says unto him Lord that I might
[1:10:57] receive my sight and I already touched
[1:11:00] on this I just got excited there whether
[1:11:02] it was physical or spiritual I come
[1:11:04] tonight to be touched amen you know I've
[1:11:07] got some needs in my own flesh you know
[1:11:09] my blood sugar issue amen I'm down
[1:11:12] because I've got to get serious about
[1:11:13] this I'm down to to eating uh I don't
[1:11:17] even know how to describe it
[1:11:19] because it's not even fair you people
[1:11:21] that like vegetables I don't want to
[1:11:22] demean them to you
[1:11:26] but
[1:11:28] do you know that they have
[1:11:30] done this they've made broccoli
[1:11:32] cardboard
[1:11:36] and my wife feeds me some of that
[1:11:42] do you know you can prepare cauliflower
[1:11:46] a hundred different ways
[1:11:49] but it's still cauliflower
[1:11:57] but God wants us
[1:11:59] to feed on the word
[1:12:01] whether the flesh says it tasted good or
[1:12:05] not it doesn't say eat the book if you
[1:12:08] like the taste it says eat the book
[1:12:13] oh Lord help us to eat the book
[1:12:17] oh my excuse me for getting excited
[1:12:20] hey my now look at this as we're moving
[1:12:23] on here tonight amen verse 52 Jesus says
[1:12:27] unto him go thy way thy faith has made
[1:12:30] thee whole and immediately he received
[1:12:33] his sight and followed Jesus in the way
[1:12:36] now I want you to look at this in
[1:12:38] comparison to the man that Jesus leads
[1:12:40] outside of the city leads him out down
[1:12:43] the road away from everyone else and boy
[1:12:46] I'll tell you what in our modern society
[1:12:48] won't even eat food off the floor
[1:12:53] hmm
[1:12:54] come on I don't mean any ill towards
[1:12:56] anybody who won't do it but you ever set
[1:12:59] in a piece of equipment long enough
[1:13:00] during a day
[1:13:01] you dropped that sandwich on the floor
[1:13:03] you scoop it up you blow it off and you
[1:13:05] chew it up
[1:13:06] because if you don't
[1:13:09] last chance
[1:13:13] Jesus leads this man outside the city
[1:13:15] spits in his eyes
[1:13:20] it says can you see
[1:13:23] and he says I see men
[1:13:25] as trees
[1:13:29] Jesus doesn't say well at least you can
[1:13:32] ditch the walking stick now
[1:13:34] you can park the dog
[1:13:37] or in bartimaeus's case you can park the
[1:13:40] Sheep
[1:13:41] no Jesus repeats the process
[1:13:45] takes two times for him to see clearly
[1:13:49] but look at Bartimaeus
[1:13:51] he has come
[1:13:52] in a sincerity he has come in a heart's
[1:13:56] cry
[1:13:57] Jesus doesn't have to spit in his eye
[1:14:00] he doesn't do anything
[1:14:08] and he's got his side again
[1:14:11] what is it the spoken word manifested
[1:14:16] there's what the word said it would be
[1:14:18] and I pray God returns that kind of
[1:14:20] power in our midst
[1:14:22] but first let him give us character
[1:14:25] to be able to deal with that power
[1:14:29] because without that character pretty
[1:14:30] soon we'd be standing up saying I did
[1:14:32] this and I did that and people would be
[1:14:35] flocking in because we want to be around
[1:14:37] that gift
[1:14:38] my brother and sister the gift that we
[1:14:40] have been given the foremost gift that
[1:14:44] we have been given in this flesh is to
[1:14:47] receive the word there's a gift if we
[1:14:50] never discern never speak in tongues
[1:14:52] never lay hands on for healing none of
[1:14:54] that ever happened to be able to say
[1:14:56] Thank You Lord that you gave me a gift
[1:14:58] to say Amen to the word and receive that
[1:15:01] word
[1:15:02] not just a passing but holding on to it
[1:15:06] amen so he says unto him go thy way thy
[1:15:09] faith had made thee whole and
[1:15:10] immediately he received his sight and
[1:15:13] followed Jesus in the way now I want to
[1:15:15] go here and God has a provided lamb amen
[1:15:18] and we'll touch on this look at this now
[1:15:20] and sometimes you think it's just these
[1:15:22] people up here in the front to get it no
[1:15:25] no I don't care where you are you just
[1:15:27] believe I don't care anywhere in the
[1:15:29] building he knows who you are and where
[1:15:32] you are now see if he is the same
[1:15:35] yesterday today and forever if your
[1:15:38] faith can stop him like Bartimaeus did
[1:15:41] you don't have to be a beggar you don't
[1:15:44] have to scream out like he did the
[1:15:46] scream didn't stop him he didn't hear
[1:15:49] that it's the faith that stopped him thy
[1:15:53] faith he didn't say thy scream has saved
[1:15:56] thee oh come on Saints are we grabbing
[1:15:59] that the scream didn't save thee it's I
[1:16:02] faith has saved thee see thy faith has
[1:16:06] saved thee my brother and sister we can
[1:16:09] cry we can holler we can scream I've
[1:16:12] been in church services where somebody
[1:16:13] come for prayer and the minister grabs
[1:16:16] Somebody by the head and practically
[1:16:18] give them Whiplash and dislocate their
[1:16:20] neck while they're praying for them oh
[1:16:23] we take this demon people are just like
[1:16:26] a rag getting jerked around and they
[1:16:29] scream at the top of their voice as
[1:16:31] though they're going to shout the demon
[1:16:33] out
[1:16:35] well how about we would scream at the
[1:16:38] top of our voice
[1:16:39] thinking somehow that's going to get
[1:16:42] God's attention
[1:16:46] when he heard
[1:16:49] our heart
[1:16:51] can your heart scream
[1:16:56] come on
[1:16:57] maybe you have a need tonight in your
[1:16:59] life Saints
[1:17:01] something that's very very serious to
[1:17:03] you
[1:17:04] I can't
[1:17:06] hear that heart scream
[1:17:09] but my lord does
[1:17:11] right now he's hearing every need
[1:17:14] everything that's in your heart
[1:17:15] everything that's stirring your life
[1:17:17] he's hearing that
[1:17:19] hey man we don't have to have it
[1:17:21] broadcasted in a great big shout to to
[1:17:24] the heavens kind of like when you're in
[1:17:26] Israel and the Muslims are there and and
[1:17:29] they've got their oh I forget what they
[1:17:31] call them the deals that are all
[1:17:34] they got these speakers on there if
[1:17:36] you're within Three City Blocks it is
[1:17:38] just rattling your eardrums
[1:17:43] they're going to make sure you hear
[1:17:45] that prayer
[1:17:48] but it doesn't change the people
[1:17:50] Underneath It All
[1:17:52] no matter how loud that speaker is and
[1:17:55] how they have so many intersecting
[1:17:57] speakers and so wherever you're standing
[1:17:59] in the city there you hear it
[1:18:02] but it doesn't change the people
[1:18:06] only a heart's cry
[1:18:08] only a Hearts cry
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:13] so
[1:18:14] I just love that quote when I read that
[1:18:16] he didn't say that scream has saved thee
[1:18:19] amen you know I'm gonna put this way
[1:18:22] just just like Aiken never got up that
[1:18:24] morning and said you know what I think
[1:18:26] I'll go out today and go into war and I
[1:18:28] think I'll just kill my family
[1:18:32] he got up
[1:18:34] the spirit got on him
[1:18:36] he knew he was doing wrong
[1:18:39] otherwise he might have wore that
[1:18:40] Babylonian garment or presented it to
[1:18:42] his wife in public and he'd never went
[1:18:45] back in his tent and buried the bars of
[1:18:47] gold and silver and the jewels
[1:18:51] he knew
[1:18:55] now it's always interesting because in
[1:18:57] the word god anoints them to call Lots
[1:19:01] but God Anointed The Calling of the Lots
[1:19:05] just calling Lots my brother and sister
[1:19:07] you you no doubt at some point in your
[1:19:09] life somebody said okay we're going to
[1:19:10] draw straws
[1:19:12] maybe just having fun you know who has
[1:19:15] to wash the dishes draw straws
[1:19:19] well that's not going to guide you to
[1:19:21] any spiritual answer
[1:19:23] but God told them
[1:19:25] draw Lots
[1:19:26] and it started narrowing it down
[1:19:28] narrowing went down down down down
[1:19:31] into the tribe into the family into this
[1:19:35] portion of a family right down to this
[1:19:37] one and right down to this one and right
[1:19:39] down to when it come Akins time
[1:19:43] what have you done Aiken
[1:19:46] why have you transgressed the word
[1:19:50] God's very thorough my brother and
[1:19:52] sister and the word promised in this day
[1:19:55] that he because he loves us
[1:19:59] come on can we say because he loves us
[1:20:04] he exposes our sin
[1:20:07] on because he's trying to shame us or
[1:20:09] make light of us or degrade us he's
[1:20:12] accused the sin because he loves us
[1:20:17] oh to be loved like that
[1:20:20] oh
[1:20:21] amen so little did he know that was the
[1:20:24] day that he would meet his provided lamb
[1:20:29] somebody had to get Bartimaeus down to
[1:20:33] the road from Jericho to Jerusalem
[1:20:36] maybe a wife or a daughter guided him
[1:20:38] down there and his job for eight hours
[1:20:41] or ten hours was going to be begging
[1:20:46] and when they walked along
[1:20:48] maybe it was his little girl where do
[1:20:50] you want to be Daddy
[1:20:52] I don't know honey close to where you
[1:20:54] brought me last time and the little girl
[1:20:57] thinking
[1:20:59] I don't even remember where I brought
[1:21:01] dad last time
[1:21:04] I was thinking about playing with my
[1:21:06] friends or
[1:21:08] okay Dad how about right here
[1:21:12] she didn't even know whoever took part
[1:21:14] Emmaus down there didn't know that God
[1:21:17] counted every single footstep every
[1:21:21] stride and said this is the place of the
[1:21:26] time of the appointment for a Bartimaeus
[1:21:30] oh if God would do that for Bartimaeus
[1:21:33] won't he do that for you and I
[1:21:35] won't he guide you and I with such
[1:21:37] Precision that we'd say well I did this
[1:21:40] it was a mistake there is no mistake we
[1:21:43] are the Bride of Jesus Christ he's not
[1:21:46] leaving us out in the cold or letting us
[1:21:48] wandered Wayward he is very precise
[1:21:52] amen so there it was there was a day for
[1:21:55] him a time a place everything specific
[1:21:58] to meet his provided lamb and I'll tell
[1:22:01] you my brother and sister when we start
[1:22:02] our day we cannot know it our day will
[1:22:04] be I get up in the morning I say I need
[1:22:07] to take care of this and I need to do
[1:22:08] this and the day's over and I have not
[1:22:11] hardly done one single thing that was on
[1:22:13] the list but I was busy all day and I
[1:22:15] look back and say well what I did was
[1:22:17] necessary
[1:22:24] but how great is a day
[1:22:27] that regardless of what it's going to be
[1:22:31] Lord thy will be done
[1:22:34] I dedicate commit amen
[1:22:37] give to you this day
[1:22:40] amen Lord that you would be in control
[1:22:43] oh I'd be my brother and sister that's
[1:22:45] what our days ought to be
[1:22:47] Lord I want to go do this but if you got
[1:22:49] something different Lead Me Now I want
[1:22:53] to read to you here
[1:22:55] I want to read to you again from God has
[1:22:58] a provided lamb only this is a little
[1:23:00] earlier in in the uh deal and I I was
[1:23:04] going to quandary you know whether to
[1:23:06] start and work through this but this the
[1:23:08] way I chose felt like the Lord led me
[1:23:10] now
[1:23:11] Bartimaeus had two little turtle doves
[1:23:13] that would make do tumbles like little
[1:23:16] over each other and that entertained the
[1:23:18] people the tourists and they would give
[1:23:20] him money
[1:23:21] so here was his original living
[1:23:25] was with these little turtle doves that
[1:23:26] would do their thing and just like the
[1:23:28] musician people would you could hear the
[1:23:31] coins
[1:23:32] ching ching ching ching
[1:23:36] ching and at the end of the day
[1:23:38] he had his little lamb
[1:23:41] that knew how to take him home
[1:23:44] so then one night his wife got real sick
[1:23:47] and they hadn't had the doctor and the
[1:23:48] doctor said Bartimaeus there's nothing I
[1:23:50] can do I can't break that fever said he
[1:23:53] felt his way around the wall got outside
[1:23:55] of the house and said Jehovah
[1:23:58] it's touched me so much today
[1:24:01] Jehovah I love you
[1:24:04] and I believe you
[1:24:06] and I have I have nothing
[1:24:10] are you with me Saints
[1:24:12] I got nothing to offer to my God
[1:24:15] I got nothing to offer to the Lord
[1:24:18] I got nothing
[1:24:22] I can offer you I got two little turtle
[1:24:25] doves here that'll make my living by but
[1:24:28] if you'll just let my dear wife stay
[1:24:29] with me to help raise my child I'm blind
[1:24:32] I can't see if you'll just let my wife
[1:24:34] get well so she can help me around I
[1:24:37] promise you tomorrow I'll make great
[1:24:38] sacrifice and I'll take my little turtle
[1:24:40] doves up I'm offering for an offering
[1:24:44] for my offering
[1:24:47] you know what part of mass is saying
[1:24:50] Saints
[1:24:52] Lord
[1:24:54] I
[1:24:56] will sacrifice my job
[1:25:00] to serve you amen
[1:25:04] look at the world we live in my brother
[1:25:05] and sister
[1:25:06] how the workplace
[1:25:09] seemingly has more control of our life
[1:25:12] than anything else
[1:25:20] but I'll offer up my job Lord
[1:25:23] all offer up
[1:25:34] they say his wife got all right he took
[1:25:36] the turtle doves and offered them
[1:25:37] sometime after that his little girl got
[1:25:40] sick she was also at the point of death
[1:25:42] so he went out to pray again he said
[1:25:43] Jehovah I don't have nothing left but
[1:25:45] I've got my lamb and in days of lamb led
[1:25:48] the blind like seeing eye dog does now
[1:25:50] and they were trained to lead the blind
[1:25:52] and he had a lamb that led him to his
[1:25:53] post where he begged and he said the
[1:25:55] only thing I've got left Jehovah is this
[1:25:59] lamb he said if you'll just let my
[1:26:01] little girl live yet I yet I've never
[1:26:03] seen but she is such a comfort and when
[1:26:06] I stroke her hair see my brother and
[1:26:08] sister we have no clue what it's like to
[1:26:10] have a child
[1:26:12] I got to raise my children got to raise
[1:26:14] my two daughters I cannot imagine life
[1:26:17] what it would be like not to to even
[1:26:20] know what they looked like
[1:26:24] it's part of the whole identity of how
[1:26:26] we process
[1:26:31] and he says
[1:26:32] Lord I'm willing to give you
[1:26:34] I hope you follow this
[1:26:37] I'm willing to give you my sight
[1:26:44] my natural function
[1:26:54] just heal my little girl
[1:26:58] excuse me
[1:27:06] well I don't know what happened there
[1:27:16] that was a really big frog
[1:27:20] the only thing I've got left Jehovah is
[1:27:22] Islam
[1:27:23] if you'll just let my little girl live
[1:27:25] yet I've never seen her but she's such a
[1:27:27] comfort when I stroke her hair with my
[1:27:29] hands
[1:27:30] she loves me and I love her said Jehovah
[1:27:33] if you let her live I'll give you my
[1:27:35] lamb for a sacrifice
[1:27:37] now look at this
[1:27:39] amen well they say his wife got all
[1:27:41] right oh we're on the next one oh
[1:27:45] hit it back to the right place sorry and
[1:27:47] his his girl got all right and here she
[1:27:50] was going here he was going down to the
[1:27:52] temple with the lamb and the priests
[1:27:54] come out stand on the balcony said blind
[1:27:56] Bartimaeus where goest thou this morning
[1:27:58] and he said I'm going to the temple to
[1:28:00] offer this lamb for a sacrifice he said
[1:28:04] oh Bon Bartimaeus thou cannot do that
[1:28:08] I said I'll give you some money you go
[1:28:10] to the Stalls and buy a lamb and offer
[1:28:12] it he said I never promised God a lamb I
[1:28:14] promise God this lamb
[1:28:16] oh my brother and sister I never
[1:28:18] promised God that I would be a Christian
[1:28:21] are you with me
[1:28:23] I never promised him I'd be a Christian
[1:28:26] I told him I promised him that I would
[1:28:29] be his
[1:28:32] not just a Christian but I promised I
[1:28:35] would sell myself out and be his
[1:28:39] Soul possession
[1:28:42] oh there's a lot of difference would
[1:28:44] throw just any old lamb out there we can
[1:28:46] throw it out there make a term out of it
[1:28:48] amen make her cliche out of it my
[1:28:50] brother and sister God doesn't want us
[1:28:53] to offer something else he's wanting in
[1:28:55] this hour for us to offer ourselves
[1:28:59] a lot simpler to offer something else
[1:29:05] I never promised God Alam I promise God
[1:29:07] this lamb
[1:29:11] cannot give that lamb for that lamb is
[1:29:13] your eyes and he said if I obey my
[1:29:16] promise to Jehovah
[1:29:17] he will provide
[1:29:20] amen a lamb for my eyes amen
[1:29:24] and he had this cold October morning
[1:29:27] a lamb had been provided for blind
[1:29:30] bartimaeus's eyes said bring him here
[1:29:33] ladies hands upon his eyes and the
[1:29:36] provided Lamb of God opened his eyes
[1:29:40] he could have stayed with his own
[1:29:43] understanding he could have stayed with
[1:29:45] his own thoughts and he could have stood
[1:29:47] back and said well Lord you understood
[1:29:49] what I meant but when he made that he
[1:29:52] had a revelation my brother and sister
[1:29:54] that the word was his absolute and The
[1:29:57] Vow he made to God was over all other
[1:30:00] vows that he had made and even though
[1:30:03] that left him if you don't mind me
[1:30:05] demonstrating that left him sitting on
[1:30:07] the side of the road as a beggar with no
[1:30:10] lamb no turtle doves a plain old
[1:30:13] everyday beggar but he had a promise I
[1:30:17] obeyed the word for my hour I believe
[1:30:21] the word for my hour and I've acted on
[1:30:24] that word
[1:30:26] and he held down in his heart God would
[1:30:29] give him a lamb and I believe because of
[1:30:32] very words my brother and sister he
[1:30:34] didn't go up to Jesus and say I need you
[1:30:36] to provide me another lamb he said I
[1:30:40] need sight in these eyes I need to
[1:30:43] understand the word of God for this hour
[1:30:45] I need to be able to see it for myself I
[1:30:49] don't want a second-hand religion I want
[1:30:52] to see it for myself I want it to be
[1:30:55] real
[1:30:56] I want to be able to testify I've met
[1:31:00] God face to face
[1:31:01] amen I know this word
[1:31:05] oh he had this old October morning a
[1:31:08] lamb had been provided for blind
[1:31:10] bartimaeus's eyes said bring him here
[1:31:12] ladies hands upon his eyes and that
[1:31:15] provided Lamb of God opened his eyes I
[1:31:18] say tonight Lord touch me
[1:31:20] Touch Me Lord tonight I'm here to
[1:31:24] receive from you Lord my heart's desire
[1:31:26] is to receive from you Lord Jesus

[1:31:45] us amen we're not the same people
[1:31:48] my brother and sister my heart breaks so
[1:31:51] I see people quit serving God go back to
[1:31:53] the world
[1:31:55] but I'll tell you what I realized in my
[1:31:57] troubled times of life
[1:32:02] pay now

[1:32:07] yeah

[1:32:53] and I say thank you Lord
[1:32:55] you led me
[1:32:57] to the place
[1:32:58] I could meet you
[1:33:00] face to face
[1:33:03] I didn't have to rely on a second-hand
[1:33:05] testimony
[1:33:07] and yes
[1:33:09] I think I would probably have qualified
[1:33:11] as a blind beggar
[1:33:13] but God in his grace and mercies opened
[1:33:15] my eyes
[1:33:17] open my eyes that I could see him
[1:33:20] see him in his glory
