[34:06] [Music]
[34:09] to those that are married i believe you
[34:13] can remember
[34:15] the feeling that we had in the natural
[34:18] a day set before us a day
[34:23] that all is set in a ray
[34:27] i don't know how a person could come
[34:30] into the day
[34:31] to marry the one they love and not be
[34:34] just
[34:34] thrilled big measure there's probably
[34:37] been someone you know
[34:38] got married for money got married for
[34:41] prestige whatever
[34:42] they see this bride is not approaching
[34:46] that way it's not about what god can
[34:49] give us
[34:50] you know that too many christians are
[34:52] caught up in what god can give
[34:54] us and they have failed to miss
[34:58] that we have been ordained of god
[35:02] just in the natural to love him in
[35:05] return for his love to us
[35:07] now people say that sounds like work and
[35:09] obligation etc
[35:11] i'd sure hate to be in your marriage
[35:14] amen
[35:15] it is a marriage that is something that
[35:18] stirs our hearts and
[35:19] yes we get caught up in the things of
[35:21] life sometimes and we have to have
[35:23] reminders
[35:24] amen natural and spiritual amen i'd like
[35:27] to speak to you this evening thank you
[35:29] so much god bless you
[35:31] amen so happy to see each and every one
[35:33] of you here
[35:34] uh and uh i want to speak to you this
[35:37] evening on standing
[35:38] on the promise amen and so we have my
[35:42] brother and sister ben given a very
[35:44] beautiful promise
[35:46] god speaking to us and so as we will
[35:48] turn uh stand and turn in our bibles to
[35:51] second peter the first chapter
[35:53] just four verses because i believe these
[35:55] four verses here
[35:56] will convey to us adequately the thought
[35:59] uh tonight as we would move forward uh
[36:02] to to touch upon this thought and i told
[36:05] sister jerry i won't be very long and
[36:07] she's like don't
[36:08] say that
[36:12] amen it's not my fault that the bible
[36:16] opens up like it does amen aren't you
[36:19] glenn
[36:20] i'm glad the bible opens up you know it
[36:22] is the original zip file and when you
[36:24] open it up there's no i want to stop now
[36:28] it just keeps opening and keeps opening
[36:30] and keeps opening
[36:31] amen how beautiful second peter the
[36:34] first chapter verses one through four
[36:36] amen now i don't like to give glory to
[36:39] man
[36:40] or to to do that but did we not enjoy
[36:43] sunday's sermon i i it really spoke to
[36:46] my heart amen
[36:47] i was actually uh physically exhausted
[36:51] and thought it was going to be just a a
[36:53] little cakewalk weekend
[36:55] to relax but the lord saw fit that we
[36:58] would
[36:58] be home and as i was sitting there if
[37:01] you looked at me
[37:04] you might have thought brother paul just
[37:05] looks tuned out but
[37:07] amen i had just forgot to let my face
[37:10] know i was happy
[37:12] and as brother chris is singing that
[37:14] song you know our hands our feet our
[37:16] soul praise god
[37:18] sometimes we need to get our face to do
[37:20] that too
[37:21] amen so ii peter
[37:24] 1 1 simon peter a servant and an apostle
[37:28] of jesus christ to them
[37:30] oh my look at this saints very narrow
[37:33] focus they have
[37:34] in the world we live in today it would
[37:37] be completely
[37:38] unacceptable for him to write this in
[37:40] this fashion
[37:43] to them that have obtained like precious
[37:46] faith with us
[37:47] through the righteousness of god and our
[37:50] savior
[37:51] jesus christ grace and peace be
[37:53] multiplied unto you through the
[37:55] knowledge of god
[37:56] and of jesus our lord according
[38:00] as his divine power has given
[38:03] unto us all things that pertain unto
[38:06] life
[38:07] and godliness through the knowledge of
[38:09] him
[38:10] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[38:14] now i don't have this in my notes so i
[38:17] just want to touch on this real quick

[38:37] let our hearts our souls rejoice today
[38:40] because by god's grace and mercy we

[38:48] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[38:51] great and precious promises that by
[38:55] these you might be partakers of the

[39:28] they might be tonight lord in the
[39:30] precious name
[39:31] of jesus christ amen you may be seated
[39:38] now i want to take out of this thought
[39:40] tonight
[39:44] i want to keep it as i i say as concise
[39:47] as possible
[39:49] but we're talking about standing on the
[39:52] promise tonight and
[39:54] you know my brother and sister it's by
[39:56] the very nature of humanity
[39:58] we experience broken promise is that not
[40:00] true
[40:01] i mean we look through life and even if
[40:03] we have the
[40:04] best intentions sometimes we don't
[40:07] fulfill them and
[40:08] sometimes people can take that so
[40:10] personally as though it is a
[40:12] insult or a slight and uh you know the
[40:15] scripture
[40:16] shows us and and we won't go into all
[40:18] these corresponding scriptures
[40:19] but the scripture shows us that let our
[40:22] yea be
[40:23] yay in our navy nay and we're better off
[40:25] to say
[40:26] i will by god's grace right the
[40:28] scripture tells us
[40:29] uh if god's will uh that we would
[40:32] quantify things but people say you know
[40:34] what i
[40:35] this brother he always says well uh lord
[40:37] willing
[40:38] and yet the prophet of god told us that
[40:40] that is something we should apply to
[40:42] ourselves
[40:42] because we don't want to get into a
[40:44] habit of of saying we will do
[40:47] something and then when circumstances
[40:49] come to be
[40:51] identified as the one who never fulfills
[40:53] what they say they will do
[40:55] and oftentimes we'll see this uh uh
[40:58] definitely in marriage uh that uh things
[41:01] are promised you know you're
[41:02] marrying the love of your life and you
[41:04] tell her oh honey you know if you'll
[41:06] marry me
[41:07] i i'll build you a nice house and you'll
[41:10] drive
[41:10] nice cars uh just to cut right to the
[41:13] chase when
[41:14] um uh sister jerry and i were courting
[41:16] you know she liked the
[41:18] mercedes sl 450 convertible
[41:21] and um you know i told her honey i will
[41:23] buy you a mercedes someday and i did it
[41:26] just happens to look like a truck
[41:28] and so it's there my brother and sister
[41:30] that we got to be careful because every
[41:32] once in a while we'll be driving down
[41:33] the road
[41:34] in a promise from many years ago she
[41:36] reminds me you promised to buy me one of
[41:38] those and
[41:39] i don't know i found one it happens to
[41:41] be up on blocks but it looks like it's
[41:43] in
[41:43] reasonably good condition for an
[41:45] abandoned car but you look at that and
[41:48] see
[41:48] i i hope you just catch where i'm going
[41:50] with this that that those promises
[41:53] unfulfilled are still remembered
[41:57] they don't just fade away as we would
[41:59] and you know it reminds me one time i
[42:01] was
[42:02] on a telephone with a brother and uh we
[42:04] were discussing some
[42:05] church or you know message believer
[42:08] business i guess if you would call it
[42:10] that
[42:11] anyway i hear a voice in the background
[42:13] and he says you know
[42:14] paul i'll have to call you tomorrow and
[42:16] i said oh something's come up he says
[42:18] yes
[42:19] my son has my children have come to
[42:22] redeem
[42:23] the promise that dad made them to buy
[42:25] them ice cream tonight
[42:26] and he said i'm sorry our conversation's
[42:28] going on on hold because i
[42:30] will fulfill this promise to my child
[42:33] now i don't want anyone to feel guilty
[42:35] and don't raise any hands but how many
[42:37] of us have told our kids
[42:38] if you clean your room you do this you
[42:39] do that we'll buy you an ice cream or
[42:41] we'll go eat a pizza
[42:42] and then we don't ever do it now if you
[42:45] ask these children
[42:46] they actually can remember you we think
[42:48] oh it just fades away
[42:50] they remember these same saints and so
[42:52] as we look at this by the very nature of
[42:54] humanity we experience
[42:56] broken promises and so it's there if we
[42:59] are not careful
[43:00] we will find ourselves taking
[43:03] experiences of this nature
[43:05] broken promises and we will somehow end
[43:08] up
[43:09] defining or trying to define god in the
[43:12] same fashion
[43:13] so the word of god has many promises to
[43:15] us we all see the scripture
[43:17] we read the scripture i'm not going to
[43:19] just go through the list is extensive
[43:21] talking of the promises of god
[43:23] and you go through there and one of
[43:24] those that i think comes up a lot and
[43:26] i'll just
[43:27] try and touch on that is the promise of
[43:29] our healing and many times i i have
[43:32] as a minister encountered people who
[43:34] feel like god has not come
[43:36] on the scene for them has not delivered
[43:38] on the promise of their healing
[43:40] and so in that they have come to the
[43:42] place that while they still suffer
[43:44] afflictions
[43:44] they no longer are calling on the lord
[43:47] for their healing
[43:48] they're no longer calling upon the lord
[43:50] for these various needs of their life
[43:52] because they've reached a point that
[43:54] they're actually believing god's not
[43:56] going to fulfill that
[43:57] but that's why my brother and sister we
[43:59] have to balance everything in the word
[44:01] of god
[44:02] we have to come and balance the whole
[44:04] picture
[44:05] and the scripture tells us there is a
[44:07] time and a season for everything
[44:09] and so we don't want to miss our time or
[44:12] season because we have given up hope
[44:14] and no longer believe in the promise now
[44:17] it is one thing to say you know what god
[44:19] is my healer
[44:20] but it's another for you and i to
[44:22] actively pursue
[44:24] our healing and you say brother paul how
[44:26] do we pursue our healing
[44:27] by getting up every day the prophet of
[44:29] god said and testifying i'm healed in
[44:31] the name of jesus christ
[44:33] don't ever let a negative word come
[44:35] don't ever come to the place and say
[44:37] well
[44:37] i guess this is what god has for me
[44:40] well if it is what god has for you then
[44:43] rejoice
[44:44] amen because you're in god's will
[44:47] might not be your will might not be your
[44:49] desire but it would be god's will
[44:52] but don't sit here and say well i'm just
[44:54] gonna say then with this condition i
[44:56] have it must be god's will
[44:57] you are conditioned by the word to claim
[45:01] the promise amen not a claim a promise
[45:04] if it looks like it's going to happen
[45:06] right now i sat down with a man today
[45:09] hapless be a landlord of a farm that we
[45:11] farm
[45:12] and he's telling me he says i have two
[45:13] forms of cancer
[45:15] he said here a a a time back he didn't
[45:18] actually define it so i don't know where
[45:19] he's at in this picture
[45:21] at one point the doctor says and this
[45:23] man himself
[45:24] is a very renowned surgeon in this
[45:26] valley
[45:27] and so is there he says the doctors told
[45:30] me you have less than a year to live go
[45:32] get everything in order
[45:33] and then he said as a time their seventh
[45:35] day adventists he said my wife and i
[45:38] family my children we pray we claim what
[45:40] god has given
[45:42] and he said you know time goes on and he
[45:44] said i go in for another checkup after
[45:46] all the treatment and regimen
[45:48] and he says well the doctor says you you
[45:50] look so good
[45:51] you know i'm going to extend this i
[45:53] believe that you could live now
[45:54] between a year and five years and he
[45:57] says i'm beyond the five years
[45:59] but what it caused me to do was stop and
[46:02] look
[46:02] what is truly important in my life
[46:06] he said i could see the end of my life
[46:08] coming
[46:10] and i had to stop and say what is truly
[46:13] important in my life and i won't
[46:17] i won't go into the whole conversation
[46:19] but i thought it was very interesting
[46:21] because you see my brother and sister it
[46:23] was in that
[46:24] as a surgeon he is an orthopedic surgeon
[46:27] well known in the city
[46:28] of nampa and around this country for
[46:31] 40 years or so and has just a stellar
[46:35] reputation
[46:36] has done many good deeds many times of
[46:39] of uh those that were poor unable to pay
[46:42] has just written off his
[46:43] his part of things and just the kind of
[46:46] character that we like to see in
[46:47] humanity
[46:48] but it took something like that he said
[46:51] to cause him to slow down
[46:53] and realize what is important
[47:01] see we don't want to start defining god
[47:06] by the disappointment of our life
[47:13] you seem people are like god's angry at
[47:16] me
[47:17] give me scripture for that god's
[47:20] forgotten me
[47:21] give me scripture for that god has this
[47:24] god has that give me scripture for these
[47:27] things you see
[47:28] those are expressed from the depth of
[47:31] disappointment
[47:32] those are expressed from the depth of
[47:35] things we
[47:36] thought god would do in a particular
[47:38] fashion
[47:40] but god had a different idea now
[47:43] remember
[47:44] that we should rejoice in the fiery
[47:47] trials
[47:49] sometimes the things that we are sure
[47:51] god will come and change
[47:52] happens to be the trial that god wants
[47:55] you
[47:56] to rejoice in amen and maybe the trial
[47:59] won't go away until you come to the
[48:01] place you decide i'm going to rejoice
[48:04] because after all if i give
[48:08] this body to be burned and i give
[48:11] all my wealth and i do all of these
[48:14] things but i
[48:14] have not
[48:20] problem is is we're looking at the wrong
[48:21] have-not
[48:27] come on saints are you with me tonight
[48:34] so it's from those experience we try to
[48:37] define god that's why god's constantly
[48:39] working on you and i
[48:40] because he's changing our definition now
[48:42] that's where one thing my brother and
[48:44] sister that our mind
[48:46] and wikipedia have and that is we're
[48:47] going to change the definition at will
[48:52] i've done that i've looked up things on
[48:54] wikipedia and go back later and look
[48:56] them up again and it's like this
[48:57] definition is not the same one that was
[48:59] here
[49:00] a month or two ago but somebody who's a
[49:03] certified editor has went in there and
[49:05] decided i don't like that definition
[49:07] well i'm here this evening if you by
[49:09] god's grace would have let me
[49:10] i don't like some of your definitions
[49:14] so i want you to go and we've got a
[49:16] master guide
[49:17] the master dictionary as it were and we
[49:20] want to go back
[49:21] and not judge god or define god by what
[49:24] we have experienced
[49:26] that is negative or hold us back but my
[49:29] brother and sister the word
[49:30] says that we have to get into heavenly
[49:33] places
[49:34] now you realize that's the reason
[49:36] sometimes we go through the struggles
[49:37] that we go through
[49:38] it's because the devil comes amen
[49:41] brother trevor sister kerry just keep
[49:42] insisting on sitting on the front row
[49:44] amen i don't know what's wrong with them
[49:47] but look at that see what happens is
[49:49] is we come and things in our life and we
[49:51] have a hearts desire amen
[49:53] to be in heavenly places and so the
[49:56] devil doesn't have to cause you
[49:58] to backslide saints he's just got to get
[50:01] you in an
[50:01] atmosphere that we're not entering into
[50:04] the heavenly places
[50:06] so it can be a little a customer it can
[50:08] be a little circumstance it can be
[50:10] whatever it is
[50:11] comes and what it does is causes us you
[50:13] might say to be bound up a little bit
[50:15] brother chris when he hit that i thought
[50:17] there it is there it is
[50:18] get loosened up get loosened up we are
[50:20] not the heavenly place
[50:21] sitting in our hands our hands in our
[50:23] pockets our mouth clothed with a frown
[50:26] on our face we're not going to get into
[50:27] heavenly places like that we're not
[50:29] going to get into heavenly places
[50:30] when we start reciting to someone else
[50:33] or to ourself
[50:34] all is wrong in life that's why i tell
[50:37] you i i just say this is a side note for
[50:40] just my self expressing people say oh
[50:42] how's it out there on the farm i usually
[50:44] just say
[50:45] it's okay because i'm sure you all want
[50:48] to hear
[50:51] every little thing that's wrong
[50:54] right you do
[50:58] no you don't but you see it's not good
[51:01] for me and it's not good for you
[51:03] for us to come and start defining what
[51:06] our world
[51:07] is by all of our perceived problems
[51:10] when we have a promise of god that is
[51:13] sitting right here in front of us
[51:15] waiting for us to reach out take a hold
[51:18] of that promise and say
[51:19] i don't care about what i see i'm going
[51:22] to stand on this promise i'm claiming
[51:25] and confessing this promise amen so it's
[51:28] there that we see how satan
[51:30] would then work right amen just picking
[51:33] up brother trevor here
[51:34] just one bad customer one of them that
[51:36] just breaks the atmosphere
[51:38] and we got to fight my brother and
[51:40] sister when they got a haircut
[51:42] and they walked out the door the
[51:43] atmosphere doesn't just immediately go
[51:45] back to what it was before
[51:46] we have to fight is that not right
[51:48] brother trevor we have to fight
[51:50] to reset the atmosphere
[51:58] but what if you're the one that's guilty
[52:01] of breaking the atmosphere god help us
[52:05] amen so he's telling us you know what
[52:08] get into heavenly places
[52:09] i'm not i don't want to go off on that
[52:11] it's just such a big topic but you get
[52:13] into heavenly places
[52:14] if my brother and sister it takes every
[52:16] bit of energy you
[52:18] have today push yourself amen as it
[52:21] would be
[52:22] push yourself into heavenly places don't
[52:24] let the atmosphere of laodicea because
[52:27] what will happen the atmosphere of
[52:29] laodicea
[52:30] is like the boa constrictor and it comes
[52:33] and at first
[52:34] it just slithers up and it lays there
[52:36] until it's sure that the prey is not
[52:38] going to move
[52:39] and then if it can get itself wrapping
[52:42] around it might be just an arm or a leg
[52:44] it just slowly comes and starts to choke
[52:47] the life
[52:48] out that's what satan wants to do he
[52:50] wants to take sons and daughters of god
[52:52] that have the greatest promises on the
[52:55] face
[52:55] of the earth and he wants to squeeze the
[52:58] life
[52:58] out of the promise until we become
[53:04] bound until we become
[53:08] ineffective until we become
[53:12] tired and unwilling to fight
[53:18] and then the world swallows him amen
[53:22] you see because the word of god says
[53:24] that we can't even call him the christ
[53:26] without the holy ghost
[53:28] amen so i'm going to just take a step
[53:30] because i don't have as it were a direct
[53:32] scripture
[53:33] that would just lay it out word for word
[53:35] where somebody say oh i get that
[53:37] but look my brother and sister it's by
[53:39] the spirit
[53:40] we enter into the promises of god we
[53:43] cannot mechanically
[53:45] take these promises well he promised me
[53:47] healing so he's got to heal me
[53:50] no you've got to come in the right
[53:52] atmosphere in the right approach to god
[53:55] and step out and say you know what satan
[53:58] now i i go back to that little
[54:00] uh song that brother chris had us uh
[54:02] doing up there at camp you know
[54:04] and we're gonna step forward i don't
[54:06] remember how those words go brother
[54:07] chris
[54:08] hey
[54:11] i went to the enemy's camp and took back
[54:13] what he stole from me
[54:14] now i thought this was great my brother
[54:16] and sister now brother adam when you
[54:18] hear this just forgive me
[54:19] but i looked over and even my brother
[54:21] adam is there doing that and you know
[54:23] brother adam i mean he's just like kind
[54:25] of stoic
[54:26] but look it's something in the heart
[54:28] it's something in the soul that we
[54:29] respond to this
[54:31] my brother and sister i'm going to take
[54:33] back what's been promised to me
[54:34] this moment is not a promise for me to
[54:37] hand to the devil
[54:38] this is not a promise for me to leave on
[54:40] a shelf somewhere
[54:41] this is not a promise that whatever it
[54:43] might be but this is a promise for me to
[54:46] actively and if i recognize satan has
[54:48] somehow
[54:49] started to pull that promise out it's
[54:52] for me to actively pursue it
[54:54] and go back and take it out of the hands
[54:57] of the devil amen now if you just sit
[55:01] there and say wow that
[55:02] that's the devil that wiley character is
[55:04] just stole my
[55:06] joy i guess i get to live
[55:09] until the lord comes with no joy
[55:16] well the way some of you are looking at
[55:17] me right now you believe that
[55:20] come on let your face know you're
[55:22] rejoicing tonight
[55:28] i'll have to make that one of those
[55:29] unspoken prayer requests
[55:35] but you see my brother and sister we
[55:37] have to get into the spirit
[55:40] to enter into the promise because
[55:43] mechanically taken promises from the
[55:45] bible
[55:46] don't work
[55:49] now i've heard testimonies of people say
[55:51] you know i was there i was in this
[55:52] situation and i just said lord
[55:54] you need to change this and he come and
[55:55] he changed it but don't count on it
[55:58] don't live your life in this sub-par
[56:01] region that you're
[56:02] there just expecting god to come and
[56:04] continually make up the difference for
[56:05] you
[56:06] it's a time the word of god says that we
[56:08] need the spirit to enter in
[56:10] and so my brother and sister it's by the
[56:12] spirit that we enter into revelation we
[56:14] use those terms together
[56:16] spirit revelation and we come but you
[56:18] see you have to get into the spirit
[56:21] first
[56:22] it's not just a spirit of revelation
[56:23] comes and just comes upon you
[56:25] god's looking for a people that will get
[56:27] into the spirit
[56:29] and it happens to be strangely enough
[56:31] those
[56:32] people that god gives revelation to and
[56:35] so if we just stoically
[56:37] mechanically present ourself and say
[56:39] well you know god promised to do this
[56:41] i'm just waiting for it to do it you
[56:43] might wait a long time because he's
[56:45] going to move you into the spirit
[56:47] to be able to reach out and claim what
[56:50] has been given to you
[56:52] oh hallelujah now look my brother and
[56:54] sister the word of god says here
[56:56] that we get the spirit of revelation by
[56:59] the holy ghost
[57:00] amen it is not something that is taught
[57:03] people before i've heard these
[57:04] have these words spoke to me well you
[57:06] couldn't explain this
[57:08] well my brother and sister i'll tell you
[57:09] right now that i could explain
[57:12] that but god laid upon my heart leave it
[57:13] alone
[57:15] because you see revelation of the word
[57:17] of god i'll put it in a closer term here
[57:20] revelation of the message does not come
[57:22] by explanation
[57:24] it comes by revelation and revelation
[57:26] only comes
[57:28] to those who have entered even by the
[57:30] spirit of the holy spirit of god
[57:33] and come into that place and god says i
[57:35] pour it out upon you
[57:37] now i'm just summarizing that because i
[57:39] i don't want to be here all night and
[57:41] and keep you all night but you see so
[57:44] it's there
[57:45] it is his divine power if we go back
[57:48] into the scriptures and just look here
[57:50] uh you look at this now my brother and
[57:52] sister according as
[57:54] his divine power has given
[57:58] unto us all things that pertain into
[58:01] life
[58:02] and godliness you see there's a divine
[58:05] power that has been released upon the
[58:07] bride of christ in this hour
[58:09] it is a season let me let me just use it
[58:12] this way it is a seasonal thing
[58:15] you don't go in december looking for
[58:17] apples on a tree
[58:19] it's a seasonal thing and the prophet of
[58:21] god i'll just paraphrase this back to
[58:23] you the prophet of god said see
[58:25] we could not go and noah couldn't come
[58:28] and say you know what moses
[58:29] i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and preach
[58:32] your
[58:32] message you see it wasn't the season for
[58:35] noah it wasn't the message for noah
[58:37] and so it had to be in season and the
[58:40] word of god's come
[58:41] and we look at this my brother and
[58:43] sister how that in the hour we
[58:45] are god didn't send a seventh age
[58:48] messenger
[58:48] to philadelphia he sent it to laodicea
[58:51] because laodicea is the
[58:53] inn it would be as it were the final
[58:56] season
[58:56] and so the word had to be restored and
[58:58] put back together
[59:00] and this season because it is the final
[59:03] season
[59:04] and there had to be a bride that would
[59:06] come in this season
[59:08] anointed of the holy spirit to
[59:10] understand the restored word
[59:12] it wouldn't do any good to have the word
[59:14] restored and the promises laid back out
[59:17] before the
[59:18] church untarnished unfettered
[59:20] unscrambled
[59:22] and there not be a people ordained of
[59:24] god by revelation to be able to
[59:26] take those restored promises and apply
[59:29] them to their life
[59:32] are we making sense okay i just don't
[59:35] want to get lost in the way
[59:37] you see my notes are very bare here
[59:41] just not much here and i want to i don't
[59:43] want to get lost in the
[59:45] so we look at this it is his divine
[59:48] power
[59:54] i hope every one of us here tonight can
[59:57] say i know what it's like
[59:59] to be anointed with divine power
[1:00:03] the moving of almighty god in your life
[1:00:08] you know that doesn't even have to take
[1:00:09] place in church
[1:00:12] in fact oftentimes those
[1:00:15] things take place outside of the church
[1:00:20] in our time our time in the wilderness
[1:00:24] as it were and i'm not necessarily
[1:00:26] meaning like the wilderness of laodicea
[1:00:28] i'm talking about our times
[1:00:30] you know i think that's why camp was fun
[1:00:32] it was good sitting around the fire
[1:00:34] and you know hearing all of you happy
[1:00:36] and whatever
[1:00:37] but you see there's just something about
[1:00:39] sitting there and looking off and
[1:00:40] watching the breeze
[1:00:42] move and just to be there there's
[1:00:45] something special you know what i'm
[1:00:46] talking about
[1:00:47] there's just something that stirs our
[1:00:48] heart
[1:00:53] not to say god didn't meet people in the
[1:00:55] big city but you look through your bible
[1:00:56] and you often find that god made his
[1:00:58] prophets in the wilderness
[1:01:00] because he had to cut everything else
[1:01:02] out so you look at that and realize my
[1:01:05] brother and sister it's by
[1:01:06] this divine power that he declares unto
[1:01:10] us he's given us all things that pertain
[1:01:11] into life and godliness
[1:01:13] now i'm going to just interject this
[1:01:15] here when people argue whether this
[1:01:17] seventh seal is open or not we have to
[1:01:20] go back
[1:01:20] and look and see what is defined as the
[1:01:23] seventh seal
[1:01:24] and my brother and sister brother
[1:01:26] branham lays this out that the seventh
[1:01:28] seal
[1:01:28] is the book of redemption so if we open
[1:01:31] the book of redemption close the book of
[1:01:33] redemption put the book of redemption
[1:01:35] back on the shelf
[1:01:36] then you and i will not know where we
[1:01:38] fit in this so when he has released to
[1:01:41] you
[1:01:41] and i everything given unto us
[1:01:44] all things that pertain into life and
[1:01:46] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:01:48] that's called this and
[1:01:50] to glory and virtue we must recognize
[1:01:53] that before this bride can be raptured
[1:01:55] she has to come into a clear view
[1:01:58] of who she is there cannot be one bit of
[1:02:01] confusion there cannot be one bid
[1:02:04] now am i saved or not saved i i did this
[1:02:06] and i don't know why
[1:02:08] you know as it were i've been saved for
[1:02:10] 20 years and today i told a lot
[1:02:11] i don't understand what's going on i
[1:02:13] must be backslid the devil's right there
[1:02:15] yes yes yes yes
[1:02:17] and you have to be able to realize that
[1:02:19] the devil's right there
[1:02:20] dumping every evil spirit he can round
[1:02:23] up on you
[1:02:24] trying to get it but the difference is
[1:02:26] my brother and sister that god would
[1:02:27] move upon the bride
[1:02:29] and she would say lord forgive me amen
[1:02:31] she's not going to hold that she's not
[1:02:33] going to sweep it under the rug she's
[1:02:34] going to say lord forgive me
[1:02:36] and as she moves into that we realize
[1:02:39] what's happening
[1:02:40] here is that this knowledge of god
[1:02:43] now this knowledge of god is not how
[1:02:46] many times we've read the bible
[1:02:49] this knowledge of god is not how much we
[1:02:51] can quote the message
[1:02:53] this knowledge of god is that
[1:02:56] personal intimate experience
[1:03:00] that where we have confidence
[1:03:11] i won't go into that but it's actually
[1:03:13] quite a funny story how these people
[1:03:15] went to las vegas to get married in one
[1:03:16] of those marriage chapels
[1:03:19] they were tad bit intoxicated
[1:03:23] the lady had already walked out and got
[1:03:24] in a taxi when she realized that she
[1:03:26] said vows with the wrong man
[1:03:30] bride's not going to do that she knows
[1:03:33] who she's wed to
[1:03:35] she knows who's giving their name
[1:03:38] to her you see my brother and sister
[1:03:41] it's not something that just happens
[1:03:45] so by spirit we enter in and he's given
[1:03:48] divine power to us
[1:03:50] i want to know i'm speaking to paul
[1:03:52] tonight too so don't think i'm just
[1:03:53] speaking down how many of us have been
[1:03:56] exercising that divine power
[1:04:00] it's not for us to talk about it it's
[1:04:02] not about to say well brother branham
[1:04:04] had
[1:04:05] my brother and sister brother branham
[1:04:07] did what god called him to do can we say
[1:04:09] amen to that
[1:04:10] and he has now transferred because
[1:04:13] all that was in christ was poured down
[1:04:16] through and i'm going to just put it
[1:04:17] this way
[1:04:18] so it's been poured down through a
[1:04:20] prophetic ministry
[1:04:21] but the ultimate goal was not for it to
[1:04:24] stop in a prophetic ministry and the
[1:04:26] ultimate goal was for it to come down
[1:04:28] into a people that one day woke up and
[1:04:31] said you know what every promise is in
[1:04:33] that book
[1:04:34] has been given to me and i have
[1:04:36] authority
[1:04:37] of the word of god to exercise that
[1:04:40] amen i don't have to sit back and just
[1:04:42] hope i
[1:04:43] have a knowledge and i can speak and i
[1:04:47] can claim
[1:04:48] and i can go forward amen in the sermon
[1:04:51] uh why christ speak brother branham
[1:04:53] deals with that if you want to go and
[1:04:55] confirm that
[1:04:56] you know he didn't want moses to just
[1:04:58] stop my brother and sister and say
[1:05:00] my i don't know what we should do here
[1:05:02] in fact he kind of chided or faulted
[1:05:04] moses
[1:05:05] that he didn't just come right down and
[1:05:08] just claim that and walk right through
[1:05:09] the red sea
[1:05:10] but we also can see how that god allowed
[1:05:13] moses
[1:05:14] to come as though it seemed like a
[1:05:16] little confusion upon him
[1:05:18] because the test wasn't so much for
[1:05:20] moses
[1:05:21] as it was for a whole nation
[1:05:26] because the promise wasn't to moses
[1:05:27] alone
[1:05:29] do you know the promise was to every boy
[1:05:32] and girl
[1:05:33] mother and father that was following
[1:05:35] moses just as much as it was
[1:05:37] to moses now moses hesitated
[1:05:41] but what if the men following moses at
[1:05:44] that point
[1:05:44] you know behind the priests and all of
[1:05:46] that but what if my brother and sister
[1:05:48] moses coming down to the red
[1:05:50] sea and kind of come there and the
[1:05:52] hesitation and a faltering
[1:05:53] and people are like what are we going to
[1:05:55] do what if there had been some men
[1:05:57] that were so filled with the power of
[1:05:59] god so
[1:06:00] filled with the promise of god they
[1:06:02] would have come up there and said moses
[1:06:04] speak to this water then we might move
[1:06:07] on
[1:06:08] amen moses would have stood right up
[1:06:10] filled his pride
[1:06:11] fulfilled the promise that god had put
[1:06:13] through him and they would have gone
[1:06:14] forward but you see my brother and
[1:06:16] sister just because you have strong
[1:06:18] leadership won't get us in a rapture
[1:06:23] we follow the ministry of brother
[1:06:25] branham he's a pro prophet to the
[1:06:27] laodicean or seventh age
[1:06:29] praise god we're going in a rapture no
[1:06:31] you're not
[1:06:32] you're going to go in a rapture because
[1:06:34] you have reached out and possessed the
[1:06:36] promise
[1:06:37] and you have taken that promise and said
[1:06:39] devil this
[1:06:40] is my promise the word gave it to me and
[1:06:43] i'm
[1:06:43] claiming this now my brother and sister
[1:06:47] you see the prophet of god
[1:06:48] had to be a true word prophet to
[1:06:51] put it everything in order so all we got
[1:06:54] to do as it were is walk in those
[1:06:56] footsteps
[1:06:56] and we'll have it but there has to be
[1:07:00] getting in the spirit to make it work
[1:07:08] amen once again i want to just move
[1:07:10] forward
[1:07:11] look how the scripture has put calling
[1:07:15] into play again in our lives see without
[1:07:18] calling none of it means anything
[1:07:23] otherwise we could just take and print
[1:07:25] this message by the millions and
[1:07:27] leave them in every truck stop every bus
[1:07:29] stop
[1:07:30] whatever and the whole world be saved
[1:07:32] but you see
[1:07:34] the world's interpretation of john 3 16
[1:07:37] is not god's interpretation of john 3
[1:07:40] 16.
[1:07:42] amen well clearly
[1:07:46] because the word says that he hid it
[1:07:47] from him lest they would believe and
[1:07:49] he'd have to save them
[1:07:53] but you see this is a promise to the
[1:07:56] partaker
[1:07:58] now my brother and sister we got young
[1:08:00] children here so i don't want to go
[1:08:02] too deep into this but you see the
[1:08:04] promise to the partaker
[1:08:06] is not of the carnal because the word
[1:08:08] carnal itself
[1:08:09] in the dictionary has a connotation to a
[1:08:12] sexual
[1:08:14] it's not to the carnal we cannot come
[1:08:16] yes the prophet of god said
[1:08:18] that all through the ages all the
[1:08:20] prophets all of this come
[1:08:22] and there was always an another
[1:08:25] impersonation
[1:08:26] but it always had a carnal element so
[1:08:29] we're not looking to the continent we're
[1:08:30] not looking to what a man can do
[1:08:32] we're not looking to this but you see
[1:08:35] it's of the divine nature
[1:08:37] look at this what defines us now i know
[1:08:39] it's not you but it's people like you
[1:08:41] come to church with a little aggravation
[1:08:44] a little attitude a little something
[1:08:46] and it might not be uh you know it might
[1:08:48] not be a big deal
[1:08:50] but let's just be honest with ourselves
[1:08:52] does that not hinder us when we come
[1:08:54] with kind of a wrong attitude it only
[1:08:58] have to be a big thing we're not talking
[1:08:59] about we thought about killing the
[1:09:00] husband collecting life insurance
[1:09:04] it can just be a little something even
[1:09:06] to the point you've been
[1:09:07] so busy in the day that basically it's
[1:09:10] like go home
[1:09:11] do this do this do this get ready out
[1:09:13] the door family
[1:09:14] we're in church
[1:09:19] what do you preach about uh
[1:09:23] from the bible come on we've all been
[1:09:27] there
[1:09:28] let's be honest with ourselves you see
[1:09:31] that's what
[1:09:31] satan's desiring to do
[1:09:34] but when we can get
[1:09:38] into this divine nature we can
[1:09:42] be that rattled i think we could testify
[1:09:44] of this tonight you can be that
[1:09:46] rattled come in and sit down and say oh
[1:09:49] lord
[1:09:50] i need you to speak to me tonight i
[1:09:53] need you lord not just make me feel good
[1:09:57] tonight so i can go home and say i went
[1:09:59] to church but lord i truly need you
[1:10:02] and tell me if god ever disappoints tell
[1:10:05] me that when we come
[1:10:06] in that divine nature god said i
[1:10:10] as it was in this uh in this prophetic
[1:10:13] words that come forth when people argue
[1:10:14] over them and i'm not here to argue the
[1:10:16] point
[1:10:16] but when the vision come of the tent uh
[1:10:19] the holy spirit speaks to brother
[1:10:21] branham
[1:10:21] and says i will meet you in there
[1:10:27] was that the doors of a tent somewhere
[1:10:29] some people believe so
[1:10:31] was it in the doors of a building
[1:10:32] somewhere some people believe so
[1:10:36] but when you enter in to a divine nature
[1:10:41] it can be here there your car
[1:10:44] on the mountain at work on your worst
[1:10:47] day
[1:10:49] and you create an atmosphere and you
[1:10:52] invite him in
[1:10:53] and he comes in and where and sits down
[1:10:56] and communes with you and you can go
[1:11:00] and say the wheels fell off the wagon
[1:11:02] today praise god and people think this
[1:11:04] guy's nuts but what it is see
[1:11:06] is you broke the carnal and got into the
[1:11:10] spiritual or divine
[1:11:12] and he says i will meet you in there
[1:11:15] now look my brother and sister if we're
[1:11:17] looking for something
[1:11:19] in laodicea that is going to be our
[1:11:21] escape
[1:11:22] it's going to be our refuge here
[1:11:25] in laodicea uh we're in a world hurt
[1:11:30] amen we might be here but we're in
[1:11:32] christ
[1:11:34] you see your your physical location it
[1:11:36] might be right here
[1:11:38] in this world but as sons and daughters
[1:11:40] of god we
[1:11:41] are in christ not in laodicea
[1:11:45] you know when i first heard a brother
[1:11:47] put it that way he said well praise god
[1:11:48] i'm not even in this world
[1:11:51] i thought now brother if i went over
[1:11:53] there and punched you you'd sure know he
[1:11:54] was here
[1:11:55] but you come along to the point what he
[1:11:57] was making was
[1:11:59] is this might be my current physical
[1:12:02] body location
[1:12:04] but i the real me the son of god the
[1:12:08] son of redemption amen is
[1:12:11] in christ hallelujah so that's how i can
[1:12:15] go through this world and be happy
[1:12:17] gentlemen that comes some of you might
[1:12:18] have saw him tonight come here
[1:12:20] he's wanting to collect money to build
[1:12:23] a sanctuary uh underground with food
[1:12:27] storage
[1:12:28] and all of this stuff when when
[1:12:30] basically the tribulation comes and
[1:12:32] i in so many nice words told him i
[1:12:35] thought that was nuts
[1:12:38] there's only one sanctuary and that's in
[1:12:40] jesus christ amen
[1:12:41] we're not gonna build a warehouse
[1:12:44] underground that's going to store
[1:12:46] hundreds and hundreds of semi loads of
[1:12:48] food
[1:12:49] for christians
[1:12:55] but i tell you what i've got more
[1:12:58] shelves in this soul than you can
[1:12:59] imagine
[1:13:00] and i have got food stored up lying
[1:13:04] upon line and oh
[1:13:07] hallelujah amen just completely
[1:13:10] filling it up riding on the soul
[1:13:13] writing and writing and writing until
[1:13:16] the word is no longer
[1:13:17] something in print it is no longer oh we
[1:13:20] revere these pages
[1:13:22] my brother and sister that word amen the
[1:13:25] message of this hour
[1:13:26] been written upon me it's been written
[1:13:28] upon you
[1:13:30] hallelujah and if they burn all the
[1:13:32] pages it won't take that word away from
[1:13:35] us
[1:13:36] hallelujah now i'll make a point here in
[1:13:39] just a little bit i'll read a quote to
[1:13:41] you
[1:13:41] now here i don't know what's happened to
[1:13:43] our screen we'll have to get the
[1:13:44] brothers to work on that
[1:13:46] it's no longer a touch screen
[1:13:50] it's not my business to ask the
[1:13:52] questions brother brown
[1:13:53] 1961 the comforter it's not your
[1:13:57] business
[1:13:57] to ask the question it's our business to
[1:14:01] believe him
[1:14:02] and obey him now see this is look at
[1:14:05] look real careful here i don't get
[1:14:07] sidetracked
[1:14:08] but look here what is the spirit of the
[1:14:09] very day that we live in
[1:14:11] well brother branham says there was so
[1:14:13] many people got baptized here where's
[1:14:15] our proof
[1:14:15] i need proof brother branham said that
[1:14:18] there was all these buses and
[1:14:20] and trucks filled with wheelchairs and
[1:14:22] where's the proof
[1:14:23] oh oh oh we found a pitcher in the
[1:14:26] newspaper
[1:14:27] in south africa okay so we kind of have
[1:14:30] some proof but we don't know that was
[1:14:31] really brother branham's
[1:14:36] you see what the devil do he'll anoint
[1:14:38] us to ask so many questions
[1:14:40] until and i'm thinking of a certain
[1:14:42] young man that breaks my heart
[1:14:44] until we end up pushing the message off
[1:14:48] so hard we push ourselves right beyond
[1:14:51] the bible
[1:14:52] to the place there is no god
[1:14:56] and end up with nothing
[1:15:01] now i've said this phrase many times
[1:15:02] i'll say it again tonight
[1:15:05] it's okay to ask god a question
[1:15:10] it's not good to question god
[1:15:14] now how do you ask a question god you
[1:15:16] got to give me an answer no sir
[1:15:18] you come lord i don't understand i would
[1:15:21] like to see
[1:15:22] and father if you would be so kind to
[1:15:25] open my eyes to understand

[1:15:30] god and if you have to go ahead put it
[1:15:32] on the shelf

[1:15:36] someone say amen that worked for you
[1:15:38] i tell you i've had questions before and
[1:15:40] not even two three days later
[1:15:42] pick up my bible and it fall open and
[1:15:44] right there the verse that my eyes are
[1:15:46] drawn to is the answer to my question
[1:15:48] my god's a faithful god
[1:15:52] that settles it god said so
[1:15:56] amen let me go back it's a business to
[1:15:59] believe him and obey him
[1:16:01] and feel comfortably while we are
[1:16:03] resting upon
[1:16:04] his promise not be a lancy saying if the
[1:16:07] devil's got you all antsy about
[1:16:09] the deal then you need to stop and say
[1:16:11] lord i'm putting this in your hands
[1:16:14] i'm going to believe what the prophet of
[1:16:15] god said and i'm going to feel
[1:16:17] comfortably while we're resting upon his
[1:16:19] promise god said so that settles it
[1:16:21] someone said to me once brother branham
[1:16:23] aren't you afraid when you go to the
[1:16:25] pulpit there and are called to a
[1:16:26] showdown
[1:16:27] aren't you afraid sometimes standing in
[1:16:28] that line there will be a mistake
[1:16:30] no sir i'm not afraid because i solemnly
[1:16:34] rest upon his word you know when we
[1:16:38] should be nervous about that now i'm not
[1:16:39] talking about the natural brother david
[1:16:40] knows brother chris
[1:16:41] knows amen brother jason would know
[1:16:43] anyone that's a you know
[1:16:45] you can just come behind the pulpit and
[1:16:47] and kind of feel nervous
[1:16:49] now it's not because we're not certain
[1:16:50] of what we believe or certain of what
[1:16:52] we're doing it's just the human deal
[1:16:54] that we're standing in front of a whole
[1:16:55] bunch of people who are not smiling
[1:16:59] okay not so many now but look at this
[1:17:02] you see
[1:17:03] standing there will there be a mistake
[1:17:05] no sir i'm not afraid because i
[1:17:06] solemnly rest upon his word amen now
[1:17:10] is this word only to the prophet oh he
[1:17:13] says i'll
[1:17:14] be with you now the prophet had this
[1:17:18] experience that he's recounting right
[1:17:19] there
[1:17:20] of the holy spirit speaking to him and
[1:17:22] says go
[1:17:23] i'll be with you amen but the word
[1:17:26] amen we could turn to it tonight but i
[1:17:29] don't need to you know
[1:17:30] amen he says i'll be with you even
[1:17:33] in you amen so we don't have to sit here
[1:17:36] and say i feel so abandoned
[1:17:38] you know sometimes you just recognize
[1:17:40] there's a complex when you go and say
[1:17:41] well
[1:17:42] nobody loves me i feel so alone
[1:17:46] come on witness stop and say devil shut
[1:17:48] up
[1:17:49] devil shut up he said he'd be with me in
[1:17:52] me amen
[1:17:54] oh hallelujah a guy could preach a whole
[1:17:56] sermon tonight over that
[1:17:58] amen because this only responds i'll be
[1:18:00] with you
[1:18:01] when he said that to me that night no
[1:18:03] man shall stand before you all the days
[1:18:05] of your life he said
[1:18:06] i'll be with you and he has cut off
[1:18:09] every enemy now i'm telling you tonight
[1:18:12] saints
[1:18:12] that you can stand this might have been
[1:18:14] god's word amen to brother branham
[1:18:17] but we have scriptural foundation for
[1:18:19] this and you
[1:18:20] and i can stand on this kind of promise
[1:18:23] right now
[1:18:24] that he will cut off our enemy and he
[1:18:26] will be
[1:18:27] with us every day of our life
[1:18:31] this is god's promise to us he stood by
[1:18:34] me when i wasn't deserving
[1:18:37] to be no surely
[1:18:40] certainly he wouldn't have said that
[1:18:44] they misunderstand the mic went
[1:18:48] no sir aren't you amazed at how god
[1:18:52] allowed all of these mistakes
[1:18:57] to be testified from brother branham's
[1:19:00] lips i tried to kill myself
[1:19:07] i was so nervous tell them
[1:19:11] i'm not here
[1:19:15] all these things that go on i'm not here
[1:19:17] to recount all of those things
[1:19:18] why did he do that
[1:19:22] because god knew you and i we need
[1:19:25] an example that when these things come
[1:19:29] upon us we could look and say you know
[1:19:31] what
[1:19:32] i'm not the only one god made a promise
[1:19:36] and he stood by me when i wasn't
[1:19:39] deserving
[1:19:40] to be stood by but because that he
[1:19:43] promised it because of his grace
[1:19:46] i've rested this is past tense saints
[1:19:49] this is not i'm in the future going to
[1:19:51] try and rest upon this
[1:19:53] he's declaring i've rested solemnly upon
[1:19:56] that word right
[1:19:57] because he
[1:20:00] promised it hallelujah now
[1:20:04] if it's paul amen that's making the
[1:20:06] promise
[1:20:07] move to the next portion please brother
[1:20:09] amen if it was paul that made that
[1:20:11] promise and paul never delivered on his
[1:20:12] promise
[1:20:14] then you'd have a right to question that
[1:20:16] but if we sit here tonight and say you
[1:20:17] know what god
[1:20:19] does what god says he
[1:20:22] will do and if god doesn't do what god
[1:20:24] said he would do
[1:20:25] then my we might as well just leave
[1:20:28] because we'll never know what day he
[1:20:29] decides not to fulfill his word
[1:20:32] imagine living like that i'll be with
[1:20:35] you
[1:20:36] even in you except
[1:20:40] when you have a fiery furnace in front
[1:20:42] of you
[1:20:44] except when there's lions
[1:20:49] no would never work we couldn't we
[1:20:51] couldn't be stalwart faithful christians
[1:20:54] not knowing that god was standing right
[1:20:56] there with us not knowing
[1:20:57] that even as it would as we go and i
[1:20:59] always mispronounce this and my wife
[1:21:01] just
[1:21:02] gets a terribly fun time out of it but
[1:21:04] to fox's book
[1:21:05] of martyrs amen
[1:21:08] how could any of them imagine standing
[1:21:11] saints
[1:21:12] volunteering i am a believer in jesus
[1:21:15] christ
[1:21:16] i will stand at that fiery stake
[1:21:19] they're either insane or they don't see
[1:21:23] a fiery stake they see a
[1:21:25] promise and they have revelation
[1:21:29] that i was called to fulfill
[1:21:33] this promise now i want you to see this
[1:21:36] picture before i move on
[1:21:39] one side raptured into the glorious
[1:21:43] presence of god
[1:21:45] the other side a lion's den
[1:21:49] coliseum a fiery
[1:21:56] need i ask you which one you would
[1:21:57] choose
[1:22:00] come on are you with me
[1:22:04] but what if you have revelation that
[1:22:07] this is the hour
[1:22:08] this is the season this is my calling
[1:22:12] this is me fulfilling the word and i
[1:22:15] will stand here
[1:22:16] don't even chain me
[1:22:20] you know why they never let another one
[1:22:23] volunteer to not be
[1:22:24] chained because when they lit that
[1:22:26] brother
[1:22:27] on fire that the flames were
[1:22:31] licking up around him and his hair was
[1:22:35] singing and he should have been
[1:22:37] screaming and
[1:22:38] wreathing in pain he lifted his hands
[1:22:43] and started praising god and there was
[1:22:46] nothing they could do about it they took
[1:22:48] sticks and long poles and tried to knock
[1:22:51] his arms down
[1:22:52] but they couldn't stop him praising god
[1:22:55] and from that day forward they chained
[1:22:57] everyone to the fiery state
[1:23:00] because it tormented them that in that
[1:23:03] a man oh he must have been an awesome
[1:23:06] physical specimen no sir
[1:23:11] he was a man with a promise
[1:23:14] and he said if this is what god has
[1:23:16] called me to
[1:23:17] i shall fulfill it
[1:23:20] hallelujah oh
[1:23:24] the devil's always trying to find a way
[1:23:25] but what he doesn't realize is god's
[1:23:27] already
[1:23:28] got a provided way amen
[1:23:32] oh hallelujah keep what he's promised
[1:23:35] that's right
[1:23:36] how are you going to cross the sea moses
[1:23:38] said i don't know
[1:23:40] but he promised that he would be with me
[1:23:45] he didn't whip out his sat phone and say
[1:23:47] i'd like to order about
[1:23:49] 400 barges no sir
[1:23:54] did he display some confusion this is an
[1:23:57] interesting thing
[1:23:58] can i can i deviate for one second this
[1:24:00] is an interesting thing about how
[1:24:02] god works he will let you and i in the
[1:24:05] physical
[1:24:06] realm mental realm experience confusion
[1:24:10] amen we think oh praise god i'm a
[1:24:14] christian i'll have just clarity
[1:24:16] i will know what to do in this situation
[1:24:21] no sir
[1:24:24] i had a little situation sometime back i
[1:24:27] was in
[1:24:28] confusion a brother come to me
[1:24:31] and says brother paul i feel like the
[1:24:34] lord spoke to me and this is what you
[1:24:36] should do
[1:24:37] and the minute he spoke those words i
[1:24:39] had clarity amen
[1:24:41] that was from the lord but
[1:24:44] you know i'm a pastor i should have an
[1:24:46] answer for everything
[1:24:51] yes so

[1:24:59] that he would be with me

[1:25:52] and it just all goes away and we've got
[1:25:57] well most of you don't chew your thumbs
[1:25:59] but some of you do
[1:26:00] i've watched you
[1:26:04] why let god be god amen
[1:26:08] don't try and cross the bridge before
[1:26:11] stay with god's word and god will open
[1:26:14] up the way because he is the way yes
[1:26:17] moses was comforted by the word that god
[1:26:19] spoke to him
[1:26:21] and i knew this wouldn't be short
[1:26:28] now look second peter 3 1
[1:26:32] this second epistle beloved i now write
[1:26:35] unto you in both which i stir up your
[1:26:37] pure minds by way of remembrance
[1:26:39] that you may be mindful of the words
[1:26:41] that were spoken before by the holy
[1:26:43] prophets
[1:26:43] and of the commandment of us the
[1:26:45] apostles of the lord and savior
[1:26:48] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:26:50] in the last days scoffers
[1:26:52] walking after their own lust and saying
[1:26:55] where is the promise of his coming
[1:27:00] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:27:02] things continue
[1:27:03] as they were from the beginning of
[1:27:06] creation so we have the word declaring
[1:27:09] to us
[1:27:10] the scoffers are ordained to be here
[1:27:14] you're not ordained to listen to them
[1:27:17] amen you're not ordained to say god has
[1:27:19] forsaken us
[1:27:20] and this must be what you know you hear
[1:27:22] a preacher preaching well you know the
[1:27:24] things that happen in the world
[1:27:25] we thought god was going to elect donald
[1:27:27] trump and going to just turn this nation
[1:27:29] back to god
[1:27:30] and we were going to do this and do that
[1:27:32] and i guess god has forgotten us
[1:27:34] god has left us and you know this must
[1:27:36] be what
[1:27:37] they felt in the wilderness
[1:27:43] listen to yourself sir
[1:27:46] listen to yourself you're declaring
[1:27:50] this disappointment you're declaring
[1:27:54] unfulfilled promise is now what defines
[1:27:58] you
[1:27:59] in your relationship with god
[1:28:04] though all hell
[1:28:07] assail me i shall not be moved
[1:28:12] because i have a promise of the word of
[1:28:15] god
[1:28:16] amen i have a promise and i'll tell you
[1:28:18] where the promise of his coming is
[1:28:21] oh you can say it's in the bible it's in
[1:28:22] the bible the there's the promise of his
[1:28:24] coming
[1:28:25] i'll tell you where the promise of his
[1:28:26] coming is in this laodicean age
[1:28:28] it's right down here in the hearts and
[1:28:32] souls of sons and daughters of god
[1:28:34] that it doesn't matter what looks around
[1:28:36] us my brother and sister
[1:28:38] it doesn't matter what it is that we're
[1:28:40] going to stand and say you know what
[1:28:42] i know in whom i believe
[1:28:46] oh hallelujah and saying where's the
[1:28:48] promise of his coming for since the
[1:28:49] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[1:28:51] as they were from beginning
[1:28:53] of creation we're certainly living in
[1:28:55] that day you know that
[1:28:57] his promise is his word can we can we
[1:28:59] say amen to that
[1:29:00] and his promise is in his word so
[1:29:04] we look at this and now i want to i want
[1:29:06] to
[1:29:07] just close with this right here uh
[1:29:10] anointed ones in the end time
[1:29:12] amen now you want to see how we can
[1:29:14] stand so solid upon this
[1:29:16] so it is the promise is his word and the
[1:29:19] promise is in his word right
[1:29:21] now look what the prophet of god says
[1:29:23] here look at the last days
[1:29:25] it'd be so close to deceive the very
[1:29:27] elect if it was possible
[1:29:28] oh my the reason the elected won't be
[1:29:31] deceived you know why
[1:29:33] is because they
[1:29:36] are the word
[1:29:39] they're not hearing the word they're not
[1:29:42] speaking the word
[1:29:43] someone's not telling them about the
[1:29:46] word they
[1:29:47] are the word hallelujah and that is what
[1:29:52] is defining in the moment we live in
[1:29:55] saints
[1:29:56] people are like well you know we believe
[1:29:57] brother brown was a prophet but there
[1:29:59] are certain things we can't reconcile
[1:30:01] that's good you focus on those things
[1:30:03] that can't be reconciled
[1:30:04] i'm going to focus on being the word
[1:30:07] amen i'm not going to be focused on
[1:30:09] whether this person
[1:30:10] that was famous in the message or that
[1:30:12] family that was famous in the message
[1:30:14] or this church this that and the other
[1:30:16] no sir i'm going to focus
[1:30:17] on the fact that i am the word and the
[1:30:20] word has a season i left the quote out
[1:30:23] tonight wished i'd put it in now
[1:30:25] that brother branham is talking about
[1:30:27] how the season comes and it is in
[1:30:29] that season my brother and sister this
[1:30:32] word could not be manifested in you
[1:30:35] even six months ago not a year ago not
[1:30:40] five years ago today is the day
[1:30:43] for us to be able to stand up and say i
[1:30:46] am the word
[1:30:47] and the very promise of my future
[1:30:50] is in the word which if you'll give me
[1:30:52] this liberty
[1:30:53] the very promise of my future is already
[1:30:56] in me
[1:30:57] and i base that statement on the fact
[1:30:59] the prophet of god said
[1:31:00] what you need for the rapture is already
[1:31:04] in you why because you have the word in
[1:31:06] you you're not just a person
[1:31:08] trying to live the message you
[1:31:11] are the message of this hour you were
[1:31:14] predestinated for this season
[1:31:17] this circumstance this time this trial
[1:31:21] this victory hallelujah
[1:31:24] not to just sit back and say oh my hope
[1:31:27] the lord comes quickly yes we can pray
[1:31:29] that but it better not be your
[1:31:31] plan to escape
[1:31:36] hallelujah lord you've got to come in
[1:31:39] the next 30 days or we're toast
[1:31:42] really lord you come
[1:31:46] oh let me put it this way lord you come
[1:31:50] when we the bride are ready
[1:31:55] because you see you can't take an
[1:31:56] immature wife
[1:31:58] he's not taking a baby to raise her up
[1:32:02] he wants if i can put it this way he
[1:32:05] wants
[1:32:05] a wife that he's not ashamed
[1:32:09] to put his name on
[1:32:13] not one that he's like yeah i know she
[1:32:16] can't cook she can't clean she just
[1:32:17] wants to play with dolls
[1:32:21] no sir he wants a wife he wants a wife
[1:32:24] that says you know what
[1:32:26] i have a promise i have the word
[1:32:29] i have a situation i'm going to claim
[1:32:31] the promise and i'm going to apply the
[1:32:33] word to the situation
[1:32:35] well did you call your pastor i didn't
[1:32:37] need to did you call your husband
[1:32:38] i didn't need to why well because
[1:32:42] i am the word and so as it is my brother
[1:32:45] and sister i just want to make this
[1:32:46] example little vanessa's right here
[1:32:48] she looked like she'd been in an alley
[1:32:50] fight just a day or two ago
[1:32:51] but god's come on the scene amen look at
[1:32:54] this cute little thing i love the little
[1:32:55] girl with all of my heart
[1:32:56] but my brother and sister you see it's
[1:32:58] not that we have to
[1:32:59] rally all the troops and have everybody
[1:33:01] drive to our house 100 miles an hour
[1:33:03] with horns and flashers going
[1:33:05] a mama can just come and lay your hands
[1:33:09] on this darling little girl and say lord
[1:33:12] in your precious name amen i claim this
[1:33:17] why we have a promise
[1:33:20] hallelujah and that promise is no good
[1:33:23] saints
[1:33:24] if we don't stand on it right we can
[1:33:27] quote it
[1:33:28] we can reference it for scripture but
[1:33:31] unless we stand on it
[1:33:33] it won't do us any good hallelujah
[1:33:37] see i do have a little side note here
[1:33:42] and we are finished if the musicians
[1:33:44] would come
[1:33:46] the season of the word now i took these
[1:33:50] from statement that the prophet of god
[1:33:52] said and i kind of
[1:33:54] you might say put a little spin on it if
[1:33:56] that would bother somebody because
[1:33:57] what he said i realized what he was
[1:34:00] meeting
[1:34:01] and you see the season of the word now i
[1:34:03] take that from the fact that brother
[1:34:05] brown
[1:34:05] says noah couldn't preach moses's
[1:34:08] message
[1:34:10] so the season of the word had to be
[1:34:14] noah's message in noah's season
[1:34:18] moses's message in moses's season
[1:34:21] and the bride's message in the bride's
[1:34:24] season oh hallelujah aren't you glad
